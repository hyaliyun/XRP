He was the eldest surviving son of John Bathe, Chancellor of the Exchequer of Ireland, and his first wife Eleanor Preston, daughter of Jenico Preston, 3rd Viscount Gormanston and Lady Catherine Fitzgerald; his paternal grandfather was James Bathe, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, whose second wife, William's grandmother, was Eleanor Burnell of BalgriffinO Math√∫na, Se√°n P.: William Bathe, S.J. 1564‚Äì1614. A Pioneer in Linguistics (John Benjamins, 1986). His brother John Bathe was an Irish representative at the Royal Court in Madrid in the early 1600s. When William's father died in 1586 the family were among the biggest landowners in Dublin, although their wealth and influence notably declined in the next generation. William inherited the family estates on his father's death, but on entering the priesthood he transferred them to John, the next brother in age, in 1601.Ball, F. Elrington: History of Dublin (Alexander Thom and Co., 1920), vol. 6. Bathe was trained as a musician and linguist at Oxford, where he wrote A Brief Introduction to the Art of Music, published in 1584. Following a long- standing family tradition, he also studied law at the Inns of Court in London. For a time he enjoyed the favour of Queen Elizabeth I, to whom he presented a harp of his own design. The Queen made him a number of grants of land, thus adding further to the extensive Bathe holdings: but royal favour ceased after 1598, on the discovery that William had entered the priesthood. The decision of a third Bathe brother, Luke, to become a priest did nothing to restore the family to favour (under the name Fr Edward Bathe, Luke became a prominent member of the Capuchin order). Apart from the religious issue, the close friendship between Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone and Sir William Warren, who married William's widowed stepmother Jenet Finglas, raised questions about the family's loyalty to the English Crown during O'Neill's rebellion, popularly known as the Nine Years War. William is not known to have visited Ireland after 1601. He taught languages in Europe, and wrote one of the world's first language teaching texts, Janua Linguarum (The Door of Tongues, 1611), a juxtaposition of words and pictorial representations of them. It proved so popular that it was translated into nine languages within twenty years. The Czech educator Comenius based his work Janua linguarum reserata on this text. For a period of time he was Director of the Irish College in Salamanca. He should not be confused with his cousin Sir William Bathe of Athcarne Castle (died 1597), who was a judge of the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland).

A recipient of the Distinguished Flying Cross in World War II, Nutter served in the Montana Senate and as the chair of the state Republican Party prior to being elected the 15th Governor of Montana in 1960. After a year in office, he was killed in an airplane crash during a blizzard in January 1962. Biography=Early life Donald Nutter was born November 28, 1915, in Lambert, Montana, the second of three sons born to Chesley E. Nutter and Anne Grant (Wood) Nutter. The family moved to Sidney in 1918. Nutter attended the North Dakota State School of Science in Wahpeton for two years before transferring to University of Montana in Missoula in 1935. He left school after his father became ill to return to Sidney, where he entered public service in 1937 as the deputy clerk of the Richland County District Court. He held that position for a year, then served for another year as the undersheriff of Richland County. Marriage and children Nutter met his wife, Maxine Trotter, at an ice cream shop where she worked with her parents. They were married in Lewistown on April 16, 1938 and had one son, John. Career Following their wedding, Nutter entered the farm equipment business in Sidney. He did well and moved his young family to Glasgow, where he managed a farm equipment sales company for two years. With the outbreak of World War II, Nutter joined the Army Air Forces. As a B-24 bomber pilot, he flew 62 combat missions, logging more than 500 hours of combat time. He spent 13 months in the China-Burma-India Theater and was discharged at the rank of captain after 39 months of service. He returned to eastern Montana and opened his own farm implement dealership in Sidney and in 1948 began working toward a law degree. Nutter was elected to the Montana State Senate in 1950, serving his eastern Montana constituents while attending law school in western Montana. In 1954, he was admitted to the Montana Bar and re-elected in the state senate. During his time in the statehouse, his position changed from \\"a cautious reactionary to a conscientious, business-minded liberal with a host of friends and supporters throughout the state\\". After defeat as the incumbent seeking a third term, he served as the chairman of the Montana Republican Central Committee from 1958 to 1960. He secured the Republican gubernatorial nomination and was elected governor in November 1960. During his tenure, state spending was reduced and new industrial developments were promoted. Death and legacy On the night of January 25, 1962, Nutter was en route to a speaking engagement in Cut Bank when the C-47 Skytrain he was a passenger in crashed. Winds exceeding 100 mph sheared off one of the wings of the plane, causing the aircraft to go down in Wolf Creek Canyon north of Helena. Also killed in the crash were Dennis Gordon, his executive secretary; Edward Wren, commissioner of agriculture; and three members of the Montana Air National Guard: Maj. Clifford Hanson, Maj. Joseph Devine and Master Sgt. Charles Ballard. Nutter's casket lay in state in Montana's Capitol House Chambers, flanked by the caskets of Wren and Gordon and under watch by two Montana National Guardsmen, prior to being interred in the Sidney City Cemetery in Sidney, Montana. Elsewhere in Sidney, Nutter is remembered with a statue in Central Park and by the Donald G. Nutter Building, which is home to the Richland County Extension Office. At the Montana State Capitol in Helena, a bronze plaque outside the south entrance to the statehouse remembers Nutter and the others lost in the 1962 air crash. Works=Letters Nutter's correspondence, press releases, and speeches are included in the Montana Governors records collection at the Montana Historical Society Research Center Archives in Helena, Montana. Dennis Gordon, his executive secretary had a bright career ahead. As a young 28-year military officer in the U.S. Army, he had been appointed the interim Military Governor of Korea. He had returned to Montana after the War to enter a career in Gordon Construction of Missoula Montana. After a brief time, he resigned a partnership in this company to pursue a legal degree and then one of politics.

The Peabody action was an early form of breechloading firearm action, where the heavy breechblock tilted downwards across a bolt mounted in the rear of the breechblock, operated by a lever under the rifle. The Peabody action most often used an external hammer to fire the cartridge. Peabody action History The Peabody action was developed by Henry O. Peabody from Boston, Massachusetts, and was first patented on July 22, 1862. While the Peabody was not perfected in time for the American Civil War, a few were entered in the trials of 1864 with favorable reports. Peabody carbines and rifles were made by the Providence Tool Company, Providence, Rhode Island; c. 1866‚Äì1871. The total production was, 112,000 for all models.

Liberian Studies Journal The Peabody rifle was one of a half dozen different rifles that took part in the 1866 Swedish-Norwegian rifle trials, where it lost out to the Remington rolling block (which became the Remington M1867 in Swedish and Norwegian service) because of its greater complexity, with more parts than the Remington design. The Swiss gunsmith Friedrich von Martini created an action that somewhat resembled Peabody's, but incorporated a hammerless internal striker and used a toggle moved by the striker to lock the action during firing. Mated to a barrel with rifling designed by Alexander Henry, the 1871 Martini‚ÄìHenry would become the British Army's standard rifle for twenty years.

Like the Massagetae to the south, the Issedones are described by Herodotus as similar to, yet distinct from, the Scythians. __TOC__ Location Issedones seen on Ancient Greek world map. The exact location of their country in Central Asia is unknown. The Issedones are \\"placed by some in Western Siberia and by others in Chinese Turkestan,\\" according to E. D. Phillips.Phillips, \\"The Legend of Aristeas: Fact and Fancy in Early Greek Notions of East Russia, Siberia, and Inner Asia\\" Artibus Asiae 18.2 (1955, pp. 161-177) p 166. Herodotus, who allegedly got his information through both Greek and Scythian sources, describes them as living east of Scythia and north of the Massagetae, while the geographer Ptolemy (VI.16.7) appears to place the trading stations of Issedon Scythica and Issedon Serica in the Tarim Basin.Ptolemy's information appears to come at several removes from a Han guide of the first century CE, according to Phillips (Phillips 1955:170); it would have been translated from Persian to Greek by the traveller Maes Titianus for his itinerary, used by Marinus of Tyre as well as Ptolemy. Some speculate that they are the people described in Chinese sources as the Wusun.Golden (1992), p. 51 J.D.P. Bolton places them further north- east, on the south-western slopes of the Altay mountains. Another location of the land of the Issedones can be inferred from the account of Pausanias. According to what the Greek traveller was told at Delos in the second century CE, the Arimaspi were north of the Issedones, and the Scythians were south of them: Description The Issedones were known to Greeks as early as the late seventh century BCE, for Stephanus ByzantinusUnder \\"Issedones\\". reports that the poet Alcman mentioned \\"Essedones\\" and Herodotus reported that a legendary Greek of the same time, Aristeas son of Kaustrobios of Prokonnessos (or Cyzicus), had managed to penetrate the country of the Issedones and observe their customs first-hand. Ptolemy relates a similar story about a Syrian merchant. The Byzantine scholiast John Tzetzes, who sites the Issedones generally \\"in Scythia\\", quotes some lines to the effect that the Issedones \\"exult in long flowing hair\\" and mentions the one-eyed men to the north. According to Herodotus, the Issedones practiced ritual cannibalism of their elderly males, followed by a ritual feast at which the deceased patriarch's family ate his flesh, gilded his skull, and placed it in a position of honor much like a cult image.As Herodotus tells us (IV.26): \\"The Issedonians are said to have these customs: when a man's father is dead, all the relations bring cattle to the house, and then having slain them and cut up the flesh, they cut up also the dead body of the father of their entertainer, and mixing all the flesh together they set forth a banquet.\\" Similar practices obtained among the Massagetae (Herodotus I.217) and the Scythians (Plato, Euthydemus 299, Strabo 298), Phillips notes, mentioning \\"similar customs in medieval Tibet\\" (Phillips 1955:170). In addition, the Issedones were supposed to have kept their wives in common. This may indicate institutionalized polyandry and a high status for women (Herodotus IV.26: \\"and their women have equal rights with the men\\"). Cannibalism controversy The archeologists E. M. Murphy and J. P. Mallory of the Queen's University of Belfast have argued (Antiquity, 74 (2000):388-94) that Herodotus was mistaken in his interpretation of what he imagined to be cannibalism. Recently excavated sites in southern Siberia, such as the large cemetery at Aymyrlyg in Tuva containing more than 1,000 burials of the Scythian period, have revealed accumulations of bones often arranged in anatomical order. This indicates burials of semi-decomposed corpses or defleshed skeletons, sometimes associated with leather bags or cloth sacks. Marks on some bones show cut-marks of a nature indicative of defleshing, but most appear to suggest disarticulation of adult skeletons. Murphy and Mallory suggest that, since the Issedones were nomads living with cattle herds, they moved up the mountains in summer, but they wanted their dead to be buried at their winter camp; defleshing and dismemberment of the people who died in summer would have been more hygienic than allowing the corpses to decompose naturally in the summer heat. Burial of the dismembered remains would have taken place in fall after returning to winter camp, but before the ground was frozen completely. Such procedures of defleshing and dismemberment may have been mistaken for evidence of cannibalism by foreign onlookers. Murphy and Mallory do not exclude the possibility that the flesh removed from the bodies was consumed. Archeologically these activities remain invisible. But they point out that elsewhere, Herodotus names another tribe (Androphagi) as the only group to eat human flesh. On the other hand, Dr. Timothy TaylorTaylor, \\"The Edible Dead\\", British Archaeology, 59 (June 2001) on-line points out: *1. Herodotus reports that the so-called \\"Androphagoi\\" are the \\"only\\" people in the region to practice cannibalism. However, a distinction should be drawn between \\"aggressive gustatory cannibalism\\" (i.e., hunting humans for food) and the ritualized, reverential practices reported among the Issedones and Massagetae. *2. Scythian-type peoples were renowned embalmers and presumably would have no need for funerary defleshing to delay decomposition of the corpse. *3. Herodotus specifically describes the removal of the meat and mixing it with other foodstuffs to make a funerary stew. Dr. Taylor concludes: \\"Inferring reverential funerary cannibalism in this case is thus the most academically cautious approach\\".

At common law it is equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge. Originating in Roman law, a hypotheca was essentially a non- possessory pledge over a person's entire estate, but during the Renaissance the device was revived by civil law legal systems as a hypothecatory security interest taken strictly over immovable property and, like the late medieval obligatio bonorum, running with the land (Latin jus persequendi, French droit de suite, Dutch zaaksgevolg, German Folgerecht). However, under a handful of mixed legal systems, the hypothec was imported as a non-possessory real security over movable property (in opposition to the common-law chattel mortgage). Whereas a pledge operates by bailment and transfers possession on delivery and a chattel mortgage operates by conveyance and transfers title, a hypothec operates by hypothecation and transfers neither possession nor title. This real right in security operates by way of hypothecation, often arises by operation of law (generally statute), and gives a creditor a preferential right to have claims paid out of the hypothecated property as last recourse when the debtor is in default. In the hypothec, the property does not pass to the creditor, nor does he get possession, but he acquires a preferential right to have his debt paid out of the hypothecated property; that is, he can sell it and pay himself out of the proceeds, or in default of a purchaser he can become the owner himself. The name and the principle have passed into Scotland's civil law system, which distinguishes between conventional hypothecs, as bottomry and respondentia, and tacit hypothecs established by law. Of the latter the most important is the landlord's hypothec for rent (corresponding to distress in the law of England), which extends over the produce of the land and the cattle and sheep fed on it, and over stock and horses used in husbandry. Scotland The law of agricultural hypothec long caused much discontent in Scotland; its operation was restricted by the Hypothec Amendment (Scotland) Act 1867,Hypothec Amendment (Scotland) Act 1867 and by the Hypothec Abolition (Scotland) Act 1880Hypothec Abolition (Scotland) Act 1880 it was enacted that the landlords right of hypothec for the rent of land, including the rent of any buildings thereon, exceeding two acres (8,000 m¬≤) in extent, let for agriculture or pasture, shall cease and determine. By the same act and by the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1883 other rights and remedies for rent, where the right of hypothec had ceased, were given to the landlord. The Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007, section 208 abolishes the common law diligence of sequestration for rent. Under Scots law, Landlord's hypothec is a common law right of security enjoyed by landlords over any goods sited on the leased premises, regardless of who owns those goods. The hypothec does not secure all sums which happen to be due to the landlord, only a portion of the rent. Landlord's hypothec is enforced by court proceedings known as sequestration for rent. The Scottish Executive felt that such a mechanism had no part to play in a modern enforcement system, not least because a landlord is able to use other diligences to recover unpaid rent, such as attachment Sequestration for rent can now be used to sell only goods that are secured by a right known as the landlord's hypothec, which arises automatically whenever there is a qualifying lease. The Act makes some changes to the hypothec, even though it is not a diligence. For example, it completes the process of abolishing the hypothec over goods in dwelling-houses that was initiated by the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002 (section 208(3) of the 2007 Act). It also abolishes the hypothec over goods owned by a third party (section 208(4)). The Act also states that, notwithstanding the abolition of sequestration for rent, landlord's hypothec does continue as a right in security (section 208(2)(a)). Quebec In Quebec law, the word is nevertheless used in translations as an equivalent of hypoth√®que, which has a much broader meaning and encompasses the common law equivalents of, inter alia, mortgages, non-possessory liens over movables or immovables, and legal or equitable charges. Thus, art. 2660 of the Quebec Civil Code defines hypothec, providing as follows: : A hypothec is a real right on movable or immovable property made liable for the performance of an obligation. It confers on the creditor the right to follow the property into whomsoever's hands it may come, to take possession of it, to take it in payment, to sell it or to cause it to be sold and thus to have a preference upon the proceeds of the sale, according to the rank as determined in this Code. The Quebec hypoth√®que, essentially equivalent to an American non-possessory lien or English legal charge, is an elastic, hypothecatory security interest that has all the rights of recourse (jus exigendi) of an American lien-theory mortgage or English mortgage by way of legal charge, may also be taken over movable and/or immovable property alike, and must be perfected (i.e. registered). The types as set forth in the Civil Code are: * hypoth√®ques conventionnelles (art. 2681) - mortgage lien or legal charge (acting as a mortgage) ** hypoth√®que immobili√®re - American real estate mortgage (REM) or English mortgage of land ** hypoth√®que mobili√®re (art. 2702) - Australian personal property security (PPS) ** hypoth√®que mobili√®re sur une cr√©ance (art. 2710) - credit mortgage ** hypoth√®que ouverte (art. 2715) - American floating lien or English floating charge (in Europe, hypoth√®que ouverte refers to an open-end mortgage) * hypoth√®ques l√©gales (art. 2724) - involuntary lien or equitable charge ** equivalent to the American tax lien, mechanic's or construction lien, home owner's association lien, and judgment lien. The Qc. Civ. Code also provides for another real security called a priorit√©, formerly known as a privil√®ge (as it is still known in France, Louisiana, etc.), defined as follows: :A preferential right allowing a creditor to rank prior to all other concurrent creditors, even prior secured creditors [...] (art. 2650) More specifically, a Quebec priorit√© is a non-possessory, indivisible, unregistrable (i.e. un- perfectable) real security arising by operation of law alone merely providing a priority right over the security subject. When attaching to movable property, this security interest most closely matches the hypothec as defined at the head of this article. The primary priorit√©s correspond to the American vendor's lien, lien for court costs, municipal lien, and possessory lien (over movables).

In Latin the knights were known as being a smaller part of the much bigger and older Fratres Milites Christi (de Prussia, de Dobrin, de Dobrzy≈Ñ, de Mazovia), and they were nicknamed the Prussian Cavaliers of Jesus Christ. The Order was created by Christian of Oliva, the first Bishop of Prussia (1216-1228), to protect Masovia and Kuyavia against raids from the pagan Prussians who defied Duke Konrad I of Masovia's attempts to subjugate them. The creation of the Order was confirmed by Pope Gregory IX (1227-1241) in 1228. Duke Konrad granted the Knights the town of Dobrzy≈Ñ (Dobrin) and the surrounding Dobrzy≈Ñ Land (), territory located south of and adjacent to Prussia. The Order of Dobrzy≈Ñ was the only military order created in the territory of Poland. At first the Order was composed of 15 German knights from Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg led by Master Brunon. The Order of Dobrzy≈Ñ provided assistance to the Cistercian missionaries in Prussia and protection from the raids of the pagan Prussian tribes. Their ideology was represented by their clothing - over their armor they had white cloaks, with symbols of a red sword raised up and a red star representing the revelations of Jesus to non Christians. The rules of their orders were based on those of the Livonian Order and the Knights Templar. In the face of the Order's lack of success in battle against the Prussians, as well as their small number (at its highest, 35 knights), in around 1235 the majority of the Knights joined the Teutonic Order, as allowed by a papal document, the Golden Bull of Rieti. In 1237 the rest of the Brothers were moved by Konrad to Drohiczyn to increase the military strength of that outpost. The Brothers of Dobrin were last mentioned when Drohiczyn was captured by Prince Daniel of Kiev in 1240.

Demographics  Flagstaff is the largest city in Northern Arizona. Other cities include Prescott, Sedona, Page, and Williams. Much of the territory is National Forest Service land, parkland, or other BLM-administered lands. In the north-east are large Hopi and Navajo reservations, parts of which overlap, leading to occasional territorial disputes. Native Americans make up the average of 48% of the population in Coconino County, Navajo County, and Apache County. Ruins of the ancient Anasazi, Sinagua, and other Puebloan people can be found in Northern Arizona.  Geography  The region features several mountain ranges, including the state's highest, the San Francisco Peaks. It also contains most of the state's natural lakes. In the east lies the White Mountain range. The Grand Canyon is in the west. The central portion of Northern Arizona has the Painted Desert. The area is known for its rugged landscape and variety of environment. Northern Arizona is home to millions of acres of Ponderosa Pine, Aspen, and mixed-conifer forests, including the largest Ponderosa Pine forest in North America. Attractions in addition to the Grand Canyon include Monument Valley, Canyon de Chelly, the Painted Desert, and Meteor Crater. The major highway is Interstate 40 (roughly following the historic Route 66) which connects the larger cities of this region. Northern Arizona also goes by the name Alta Arizona, which means \\"Upper Arizona\\" in Spanish. Northern Arizona has a large Mormon population, with a temple in Snowflake. Northern Arizona has various points of interest.

Juan de J√°uregui (1562 ‚Äì March 18, 1582) was killed trying to assassinate Prince William I of Orange. He was a Biscayan by his birth in Bilbao. In 1582, he was in the service of a Spanish fur merchant, Gaspar de A√±astro from Vitoria, who resided at Antwerp. De A√±astro had lost three ships and was tempted by the supposed reward of 80,000 ducats and the habit of the Order of Santiago offered by Philip II of Spain for the assassination of William the Silent, prince of Orange, and being himself without courage to undertake the task, De A√±astro (with the help of his cashier Antonio de Venero, a 19-year-old also from Bilbao, and the Dominican friar Antonio Timmerman, from Dunkirk) persuaded his poor accounting assistant J√°uregui to attempt the murder for the sum of 2877 crowns. J√°uregui had been convinced not only that heaven would smile on his attempt, but that he would become invisible immediately afterwards, and thus escape easily. On Sunday, March 18, 1582, as the prince came out of his dining-room, J√°uregui offered him a petition, and William had no sooner taken it into his hand than J√°uregui fired a pistol at his head. Although the pistol was badly designed and malfunctioned, one bullet pierced the neck below the right ear and passed out at the left jaw-bone, but William ultimately recovered. J√°uregui was pierced on the spot by the sword of a knight in the retinue and finally killed by the halberdiers. Upon a search on the corpse, he was found to carry two pieces of castor fur, several crosses and amulets, a green wax candle (typical accoutrements of wizardry), and several papers written in Spanish. When William recovered, he asked a merciful execution for the survivors: Venero and Timmerman were garotted on March 28, then decapitated and quartered for public exhibition. De A√±astro had left for Wallonia on March 13. He claimed the reward before Alessandro Farnese. In this case, the reward was the 25,000 escudos, nobility title and pardon actually promised by Philip II in June 1580. Although William suffered severe injuries, he survived thanks to the care of his wife Charlotte of Bourbon and his sister Mary. While William slowly recovered, Charlotte died on May 5. William was finally shot dead by the French Catholic Balthasar G√©rard on 10 July 1584. The case was published in French, Flemish and Spanish by Christopher Plantin as Bref recueil de l'assassinat, commis en la personne du Tr√®s Illustre Prince, Monseigneur le Prince d'Orange, Conte de Nassau, Marquis de la Vere, etc par Iean Iauregui Espaignol, Antwerp, 1582. Among the published writings, there was a religious vouch promising donations to Jesus Christ, Our Lady of Bego√±a, Our Lady of Arantzazu, Our Lady of Guadalupe at Hondarribia, and the Christ of Burgos. There also was a letter appealing to the goodwill of the Antwerpers.

Whereas meningitis is inflammation of the meninges (membranes that cover the central nervous system), meningism is caused by nonmeningitic irritation of the meninges, usually associated with acute febrile illness, especially in children and adolescents. Meningism involves the triad (3-symptom syndrome) of nuchal rigidity (neck stiffness), photophobia (intolerance of bright light) and headache. It therefore requires differentiating from other CNS problems with similar symptoms, including meningitis and some types of intracranial hemorrhage. Related clinical signs include Kernig's sign and three signs all named Brudzinski's sign. Although nosologic coding systems, such as ICD-10 and MeSH, define meningism/meningismus as meningitis-like but in fact not meningitis, many physicians use the term \\"meningism\\" in a loose sense clinically to refer to any meningitis-like set of symptoms before the cause is definitively known. In this sense, the word implies \\"suspected meningitis\\". The words \\"meningeal symptoms\\" can be used instead to avoid confusion between the word senses, thus reserving the term \\"meningism\\" for its strict sense. Readers of the medical literature should remain aware that the words are used in more than one sense.  Signs and symptoms  Positive Kernig's sign in cerebrospinal meningitis The main clinical signs that indicate meningism are nuchal rigidity, Kernig's sign and Brudzinski's signs. None of the signs are particularly sensitive; in adults with meningitis, nuchal rigidity was present in 30% and Kernig's or Brudzinski's sign only in 5%. Nuchal rigidity Nuchal rigidity is the inability to flex the neck forward due to rigidity of the neck muscles; if flexion of the neck is painful but full range of motion is present, nuchal rigidity is absent. Kernig's sign Kernig's sign (after Waldemar Kernig (1840‚Äì1917), a Russian neurologist) is positive when the thigh is flexed at the hip and knee at 90 degree angles, and subsequent extension in the knee is painful (leading to resistance). This may indicate subarachnoid hemorrhage or meningitis. Patients may also show opisthotonus‚Äîspasm of the whole body that leads to legs and head being bent back and body bowed forward. Brudzinski's signs Jozef Brudzinski (1874‚Äì1917), a Polish pediatrician, is credited with several signs in meningitis. The most commonly used sign (Brudzinski's neck sign) is positive when the forced flexion of the neck elicits a reflex flexion of the hips, with the patient lying supine. Other signs attributed to Brudzinski: * The symphyseal sign, in which pressure on the pubic symphysis leads to abduction of the leg and reflexive hip and knee flexion. * The cheek sign, in which pressure on the cheek below the zygoma leads to rising and flexion in the forearm. * Brudzinski's reflex, in which passive flexion of one knee into the abdomen leads to involuntary flexion in the opposite leg, and stretching of a limb that was flexed leads to contralateral extension.

Union forces under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks attacked Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson near Cedar Mountain as the Confederates marched on Culpeper Court House to forestall a Union advance into central Virginia. After nearly being driven from the field in the early part of the battle, a Confederate counterattack broke the Union lines resulting in a Confederate victory. The battle was the first combat of the Northern Virginia campaign. Background On June 26, Maj. Gen. John Pope was placed in command of the newly constituted Union Army of Virginia. Pope deployed his army in an arc across Northern Virginia. Its right flank, under Maj. Gen. Franz Sigel, was positioned at Sperryville on the Blue Ridge Mountains, its center, under Maj. Gen Nathaniel P. Banks, was located at Little Washington and its left flank under Maj. Gen. Irvin McDowell was at Falmouth on the Rappahannock River. Part of Banks's corps, Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford's brigade and Brig. Gen John P. Hatch's cavalry, were stationed beyond the Union line, at Culpeper Court House.Salmon, pp. 125‚Äì126. General Robert E. Lee responded to Pope's dispositions by dispatching Major General Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson with 14,000 men to Gordonsville on July 13. Jackson was later reinforced with another 10,000 men by Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's division on July 27.McPherson, p. 525. On August 6, Pope marched his forces south into Culpeper County with the objective of capturing the rail junction at Gordonsville, in an attempt to draw Confederate attention away from Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's withdrawal from the Virginia Peninsula.Henderson, p. 402. In response to this threat, Jackson chose to go on the offensive, attacking Pope's vanguard under Banks, before the entire Army of Virginia could be brought to bear on his position at Gordonsville.Salmon, p. 127. After defeating Banks, he then hoped to move on Culpeper Court House, north of Gordonsville and the focal point of the Union arc about Northern Virginia, to keep Pope's army from uniting. This would allow Jackson to fight and hopefully defeat each of the Union Corps separately, as he had done during the Valley Campaign. Accordingly, Jackson set out on August 7 for Culpeper.Henderson, p. 403. The cavalry under Brig. Gen. Beverly Robertson was sent ahead to dispatch the Federal cavalry guarding the fords of the Rapidan River and occupying Madison Court House, threatening the Confederates left flank as they marched northward. This task was easily accomplished by Robertson on August 8.McDonald, p. 80. Jackson's march on Culpeper Court House was hindered by the severe heat wave over Virginia at the beginning of August, as well as by his characteristic secrecy about his plan, which caused confusion among his divisional commanders as to the exact route of advance. As such, the head of his column had only progressed by the evening of August 8. The Federal Cavalry, though easily dispatched by Robertson, quickly returned to Pope and alerted him of the Confederate advance. In response, Pope ordered Sigel to Culpeper Court House to reinforce Banks, and Banks was ordered to maintain a defensive line on a ridge above Cedar Run, south of Culpeper Court House.Henderson, pp. 405‚Äì407. Opposing forces=UnionConfederate=Battle=Confederate position Sketch of Battle of Cedar Run On the morning of August 9, Jackson's army crossed the Rapidan River into Culpeper County, led by Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's division, followed by Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder's division, with Maj. Gen. A.P. Hill's division in the rear. Just before noon, Brig. Gen. Jubal Early's brigade, the vanguard of Ewell's division, came upon Federal cavalry and artillery occupying the ridge above Cedar Run, just to the north-west of Cedar Mountain. Early brought up his guns and an artillery duel began between the opposing forces as Early's infantry formed a line on the eastern side of the Culpeper- Orange Turnpike (present day U.S. Route 15) on the high ground on the opposite bank of Cedar Run.Henderson, p. 407. As the rest of Ewell's division arrived they formed on Early's right, anchored against the northern slope of the mountain and deployed their six guns on its ridge. Winder's division formed to Early's left, on the west side of the Turnpike, with Brig. Gen. William Taliaferro's brigade closest to Early, and Col. Thomas S. Garnett's on the far Confederate left in a wheat field at the edge of a woods. Winder's artillery filled a gap on the road between the two divisions. The Stonewall Brigade, led by Col. Charles R. Ronald, was brought up in support behind the guns. A.P Hill's division, still marching up the Turnpike, was ordered to stand in reserve on the Confederate left.Salmon, p. 132. Union position The Federals formed a line on a ridge above Cedar Run, with Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford's brigade forming the Union right in a field across from Garnett and Brig. Gen. Christopher C. Augur's division on the Union left to the east of the Turnpike. Brig. Gen. John W. Geary's brigade was anchored on the Turnpike opposing Taliaferro, while Brig. Gen Henry Prince's brigade formed the far left opposite Ewell. Brig. Gen. George S. Greene's understrength brigade (only two regiments) was kept in reserve in the rear.Salmon, p. 134. Cedar Mountain battlefield, facing south from the approximate southwestern corner of the wheat field Union attack A little before 5:00 p.m. as the artillery fight began to wane, Confederate Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder fell mortally wounded. He had been ill that day and was taken onto the field in an ambulance wagon. While attempting to direct his troops, he was struck by a shell fragment. Winder's left arm and side were torn to pieces, and he died a few hours later. As a result, command of the division devolved on William Taliaferro, who was completely ignorant of Jackson's battle plan. Dispositions on his part of the field were still incomplete; Garnett's brigade was isolated from the main Confederate line, with its flank dangerously exposed to the woods. The Stonewall Brigade was to have come up to support them, but remained a half mile distant behind the artillery.Henderson, pp. 408‚Äì409. Before leadership could properly be restored to the division the Union attack began. Geary and Prince were sent against the Confederate right. The Federal advance was swift and threatened to break the Confederate line, prompting Early to come galloping to the front from Cedar Mountain where he was directing troop dispositions. Early's stabilizing presence and the raking fire of the Confederate guns halted the Union advance on the Confederate right. On the left Crawford attacked Winder's division, sending one brigade directly at the Confederate line and another brigade through the woods on a flanking movement. The Federals came from the woods directly into the flank of the 1st Virginia Infantry, who under the pressure from attack on two fronts broke for the rear. The Federals pushed on, not waiting to reform their lines, rolling through the outflanked 42nd Virginia until they found themselves in Taliaferro's and the artillery's rear. The Stonewall Brigade came up and was swept aside by Crawford's troops before it had a chance to react. Jackson ordered the batteries withdrawn before they were captured, but Taliaferro and Early's left were hit hard by the Union advance and threatened to break.Henderson, pp. 409‚Äì410; Wood, pp. 64‚Äì65. Confederate counterattack At this dire point, Gen. Jackson rode to that part of the field to rally the men and came upon his old brigade finally being brought up to reinforce the line. Intending to inspire the troops there, he attempted to brandish his sword; however, due to the infrequency with which he drew it, it had rusted in its scabbard and he was unable to dislodge it. Undaunted, he unbuckled the sword from his belt and waved it, scabbard and all, over his head. He then grabbed a battle flag from a retreating standard bearer and yelled at his men to rally around him.NPS Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park website. The Stonewall Brigade, heartened by their commander, launched into the Union troops and drove them back. By this point, Banks's men were becoming tired and disorganized, with their ammunition nearly gone. Without any support, his men had been unable to follow up on their initial success. In their zeal, the Stonewall Brigade pursued the Federals as they fell back, but soon found themselves beyond the Confederate line and without support. The Federals reformed and attacked, driving the 4th and 27th Virginia back. But the actions of the Stonewall Brigade gave the Confederate line time to reform and A.P Hill's troops to come up and fill the gaps from Winder's broken regiments.Henderson, p. 411. Jackson ordered Hill and Ewell to advance. He encountered Brig. Gen. Lawrence O'Bryan Branch (a career politician) making a lengthy speech to his troops, and urged him to press forward. The Union right immediately collapsed. Ewell, having difficulty silencing his guns, was delayed, but the Union left began to waver at the sight of Crawford's retreat and were finally broken by a charge down Cedar Mountain by Brig. Gen. Isaac R. Trimble's brigade.Salmon, pp. 134‚Äì135; Robertson, pp. 531‚Äì33. Confederate pursuit Despite bringing up Greene's reserve brigade in support, by 7:45 p.m. the Union line was in full retreat. In a last-ditch effort to help cover his infantry's retreat, Banks sent two squadrons of cavalry at the Confederate line. They were met with a devastating volley from the Confederate infantry posted behind a fence on the road, allowing only 71 of 174 to escape. The Confederate infantry and Brig. Gen William E. Jones's 7th Virginia Cavalry hotly pursued the retreating Federals, nearly capturing Banks and Pope, who were at their headquarters a mile behind the Federal line.Salmon, p. 135. After a mile-and-a-half of pursuit, Jackson grew wary as darkness set in, as he was unsure of the location of the rest of Pope's army. Finally, several Union infantrymen captured by the 7th Virginia informed the Confederates that Pope was bringing Sigel forward to reinforce Banks. Accordingly, Jackson called off the pursuit and by around 10 p.m the fighting had ceased. By this point, Brig. Gen. James Ricketts's division of McDowell's corps was arriving, which effectively covered Banks's retreat.McDonald, p. 81; Welcher, p. 919. Aftermath Losses were high in the battle: Union casualties of 2,353 (314 killed, 1,445 wounded, 594 missing), Confederate 1,338 (231 killed, 1,107 wounded). Crawford's brigade had lost over 50% of its total strength, including most of its officers. Prince's and Geary's brigades suffered 30‚Äì40% casualty rates. Both generals were wounded, and Prince was also captured.Wood, p. 68. Confederate Brig. Gen. Charles S. Winder was mortally wounded by a shell. For two days, Jackson maintained his position south of Cedar Run on the western slope of the mountain, waiting for a Federal attack that did not come. Finally, receiving news that all of Pope's army had arrived at Culpeper Court House, on August 12, Jackson fell back on Gordonsville to a more defensive position behind the Rapidan River.Henderson, p. 414. Weather and poor communication with his divisional commanders had robbed Jackson of the initiative in the fight. Still expecting to face the same cautious opponent from the Valley, he was taken by surprise and very nearly driven from the field. Excellent commanding by the Confederates at the crucial moment of the battle and the fortuitous arrival of Hill staved off defeat, eventually allowing their numerical superiority to drive the Federals from the field. For his part, Banks, having been soundly defeated by Jackson in the Valley, was anxious to make up for previous losses. Rather than fighting a defensive battle from a strong position because he was outnumbered 2 to 1, giving time for the rest of Pope's army to arrive, he decided to take the initiative and attack Jackson before he could fully form his lines. The bold move very nearly paid off, but in the end he was again defeated by his old foe.McPherson, p. 526. With Jackson on the loose, wreaking havoc against Union forces, General- in-Chief Henry W. Halleck became apprehensive and called off Pope's advance on Gordonsville, thereby giving Lee the initiative in the Northern Virginia Campaign. The battle effectively shifted fighting in Virginia from the Virginia Peninsula into northern Virginia.

Most of the already preserved land sits near the intersection of Virginia State Routes 15 and 657 (the latter of which is known as General Winder Road). It includes the area where Crittenden Gate once stood, along with the wheat field in which some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle took place. The Trust preserved a plot of land there in 1998, added two more to that total twelve years later and ten more by 2013. A local organization known as the Friends of Cedar Mountain Battlefield proved instrumental to implementing these preservation efforts. The ten acres saved in 2012 are close to Crittenden Gate site and included the area of the battlefield where General Winder was mortally wounded, along with the locations of Jackson's command post and his desperate effort to rally Confederate troops at the climax of the battle.\\"Save Cedar Mountain,\\" Civil War Trust, 2012 See also *Culpeper National Cemetery NotesReferences *National Park Service battle description * CWSAC Report Update * Hearn, Chester.

Wright attended Christ School (North Carolina) in Asheville for his junior and senior years where he helped coach football, served as vice president of his class, and became a member of the honors program. While at Christ School, he enveloped himself in the literature that would inspire him to write. By the time he graduated in 1953 he had read everything William Faulkner had written. He then matriculated at Davidson College and graduated with a BA in history in 1957. He received a master's degree from the University of Iowa in 1963, and attended the University of Iowa Writers' Workshop. He was a Fulbright Scholar at the Sapienza University of Rome and at the University of Padua.  Teaching career  From 1966 to 1983, he taught at the University of California, Irvine. Fellow Colleagues poets Robert Peters and James L. McMichael and novelist Oakley Hall shared during this time directorship of the university's well- known Master of Fine Arts program. He went to the University of Virginia in 1983, where he stayed until he retired in 2010. He was a Chancellor of The Academy of American Poets and Souder Family Professor of English at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.  Poet  Wright began writing poetry while stationed in Italy during his army service, from 1957 to 1961, in the United States Army Intelligence Corps in Verona. On June 12, 2014, the Library of Congress announced that Wright would serve as Poet Laureate of the United States beginning on September 25, 2014. He retired from the position in May 2015. Works Beside the award-winning books Country Music (1982) and Black Zodiac (1997), Wright has published Chickamauga, Buffalo Yoga, Negative Blue, Appalachia, The World of the Ten Thousand Things: Poems 1980-1990, Zone Journals and Hard Freight. His work also appears in Blackbird: an online journal of literature and the arts. Wright has published two works of criticism, Halflife and Quarter Notes.  Recognition  His translation of Eugenio Montale's The Storm and Other Poems won him the PEN Translation Prize in 1979. In 1993, he received the Ruth Lilly Poetry Prize for his lifetime achievement. In 1996 he won the Lenore Marshall Poetry Prize from the Academy of American Poets for the collection Chickamauga (1995).

Examples in science Some quantities in scientific theory are set arbitrarily according to measured results rather than by calculation (for example, Planck's constant). However, in the case of these fundamental constants, their arbitrariness is usually explicit. To suggest that other calculations may include a \\"fudge factor\\" may suggest that the calculation has been somehow tampered with to make results give a misleadingly good match to experimental data. Cosmological constant In theoretical physics, when Albert Einstein originally tried to produce a general theory of relativity, he found that the theory seemed to predict the gravitational collapse of the universe: it seemed that the universe should either be expanding or collapsing, and to produce a model in which the universe was static and stable (which seemed to Einstein at the time to be the \\"proper\\" result), he introduced an expansionist variable (called the Cosmological Constant), whose sole purpose was to cancel out the cumulative effects of gravitation. He later called this, \\"the biggest blunder of my life.\\" Expected error margins A common feature of \\"fudge factors\\" in science is their arbitrariness, and their retrospective nature. However, in project management it is common to build a certain error margin into the predicted \\"resource cost\\" of a project to make predictions more realistic: there are many unforeseen factors that may delay a project or make it more costly, but very few factors that could result in it being delivered before time or under the calculated budget ... so to some degree, \\"unexpected\\" overruns are to be expected, even if their precise nature can't be predicted in advance. Experienced planners may know that a certain type of project will tend to overrun by a certain percentage of its calculated resource requirements, and may multiply the \\"ideal\\" calculations by a safety margin to produce a more realistic estimate, and this margin may sometimes be referred to as a fudge factor. However, when planning ahead for expected unpredictabilities, these \\"error margins\\" are usually assigned other, more specific names: for instance in warehouse stock control, where a certain amount of stock is expected to disappear naturally through damage, pilfering or other unexplained problems, the discrepancy is referred to as shrinkage.

Union pickets at Rappahannock Station, Virginia photographed here in August 1862 will be driven away by Confederates under James Longstreet Background In early August, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee determined that Union Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan's army was being withdrawn from the Virginia Peninsula to reinforce Maj. Gen. John Pope. He sent Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's wing from Richmond to join Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's wing of the army near Gordonsville and arrived to take command himself on August 15. On August 20 and 21, Pope withdrew to the line of the Rappahannock River. Skirmishes Throughout the day on August 20, Pope spread his army along the northern bank of the Rappahannock from Kelly's Ford northward to just above the railroad bridge at Rappahannock Station (present day Remington, Virginia) and prepared to defend the river crossings. On that day the head of Longstreet's right wing of Lee's army reached Kelly's Ford. Lee had intended to cross the river above Pope's army to flank it but Pope was expanding northward too quickly. On August 21 and 22 the northern ends of the two armies \\"waltzed\\", first Pope and then Longstreet expanding northward along the river. Each army kept its southern end anchored at Kelly's Ford. Lee then changed his strategy and ordered Jackson's left wing to move much further upriver in order to cross above Pope. On August 23, Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's cavalry crossed the Rappahannock at the northern end of Jackson's line and made a daring raid on Pope's headquarters at Catlett Station, thus showing that the Union right flank was vulnerable to a turning movement. Rappahannock Station Lee now needed to protect his own right flank from a possible enemy attack. Upriver storms on August 22nd had caused the river to rise enough to make most of the fords useless, but Lee needed to take the railroad bridge at Rappahannock Station where Union artillery on the high northern bank plus a small troop and gun emplacement on the south bank controlled the crossing. On the afternoon of August 22, two Confederate artillery units arrived in the vicinity of Rappahannock Station. They were under orders from Maj. Gen. James Longstreet to drive the enemy from his positions on both sides of the river. Nathan G. Evans' South Carolina Brigade and George T. Anderson's Georgia Brigade were ordered to support the artillery. At daylight on the 23rd the 19 guns of the Washington Artillery of New Orleans began the duel. One historian characterized this three-hour action involving nearly fifty cannon as \\"one of the fiercest small artillery duels of the war\\". The first Confederate artillery target was the small Union battery on the knoll just south of the river. This position was an easy target for the artillery of both armies. It was quickly abandoned by Union forces, who blew up the railroad bridge as they retreated. Evans then sent his small Macbeth Artillery battery and the Holcombe Legion infantry to occupy the knoll, but they were quickly dislodged by Union artillery fire from across the river. About noon some of the Union artillery units on the north bank moved slightly upriver in order to be able to fire on the bottomland where the Confederate infantry brigades were concealed. The Confederate infantry retreated under fire as best they could, but they suffered substantial casualties. At mid- afternoon additional Confederate artillery units arrived to shell the Union forces, which then set fire to the buildings in the small town and retreated. On August 25 Jackson's wing rose at 3 am to begin marching further upriver to cross the Rappahannock at Hinson's Mill Ford, flanking Pope on his right. On the 26th he marched via Thoroughfare Gap to capture Bristoe Station and destroy Federal supplies at Manassas Junction, far in the rear of Pope's army. A few days later Longstreet's wing of the Army of Northern Virginia followed the same route to join Jackson's wing, setting the stage for the Second Battle of Manassas. Union forces retreat from Rappahannock Station Reinterment of a soldier A Smithsonian Institution archaeological team uncovered the remains of a Confederate soldier in 1989 while excavating the ruins of St. James Episcopal Church to access the site's eligibility for the National Register of Historic Places. The team identified the soldier as a native of New Orleans and member of the Washington Artillery killed during the Battle of Rappahannock Station on August 23, 1862. The reinterment of the soldier was conducted at the St. James Cemetery, Brandy Station, Virginia.

He edited an Encyclopaedia Americana. He was the author of the Lieber Code during the American Civil War, also known as Code for the Government of Armies in the Field (1863). The Lieber Code is considered the first document to comprehensively outline rules regulating the conduct of war, and laid the foundation for the Geneva Conventions.Sheehan-Dean, Aaron. The American Civil War: Total or Just?. Teachinghistory.org, accessed 18 December 2011. Biography Franz Lieber was born in Berlin, the capital of the Kingdom of Prussia. While still in Germany, Lieber joined the Colberg Regiment of the Prussian Army in 1815 during the Napoleonic Wars, and was wounded during the Battle of Waterloo. The year of his birth has been debated because he lied about his age in order to enlist.Francis Lieber. Hermenutics and Practical Reason. John Catalano University Press of America. 2000 Education in Germany Lieber did not receive a normal gentleman's education. Returning to Berlin after the Napoleonic wars (post 1815), he studied hard and passed the entrance exams for the University of Berlin. However, he was denied admission because of his membership in the Berliner Burschenschaft, which opposed the Prussian monarchy. Moving to Jena, Lieber entered the University of Jena in 1820 and within four months finished writing a dissertation in the field of mathematics.Francis Lieber. Hermenutics and Practical Reason. John Catalano University Press of America. 2000. p. 2. As the Prussian authorities caught up with him, Lieber left Jena for Dresden to study topography with Major Decker (briefly). As soon as the Greek Revolution of 1821 broke out, Lieber volunteered his services. European activities John Neal Lieber fought briefly in the Greek War of Independence, and then spent one year, 1822‚Äì1823, in Rome tutoring the son of the Prussian ambassador, historian Barthold Georg Niebuhr. While there, Lieber wrote about his experiences in Greece. The result was published in Leipzig in 1823 and also in Amsterdam under the title The German Anacharsis. Lieber returned to Germany on a royal pardon, but was soon imprisoned once again, this time at K√∂penick. There he wrote a collection of poems entitled Wein- und Wonne-Lieder (Songs of wine and bliss), which on his release, with Niebuhr's help, were published in Berlin in 1824 under the pen name of \\"Franz Arnold.\\" Lieber fled to England in 1825, and supported himself for a year in London by giving lessons and contributing to German periodicals. In London he met American writer and critic John Neal, who was studying gymnastics from Carl Voelker and intent on bringing the movement to the US. Neal published an article in the American Journal of Education recommending Lieber as \\"qualified, almost beyond example\\" as a teacher of gymnastics, and \\"the chief personage with professor Jahn himself.‚Äù Lieber also wrote a tract on the Lancasterian system of instruction, and met his future wife, Mathilda Oppenheimer. He left England upon receiving an offer to manage a gymnasium and swimming program in Boston. American educator and writer Lieber moved to Boston in 1827. He came with recommendations from Jahn, as well as from General Pfuel who ran a swimming program in Berlin. Lieber was also acquainted with the outgoing gymnasium administrator, Charles Follen, both believing thoroughly in the importance of training the body along with the mind. Follen had established the pioneer gymnasium in 1826. Lieber's Boston swimming school of 1827, a new departure in the educational field in the United States, became such a feature that John Quincy Adams, then President of the United States, went to see it.Albert Berhardt Faust, The German Element in the United States (2 vols.), Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1909, v. 2, chap. 5, p. 216. The gymnasium had a difficult time once the novelty had worn off and in the face of caricatures in the newspapers. It closed its doors after two years. In Boston, Lieber edited an Encyclopaedia Americana, after conceiving of the idea of translating the Brockhaus encyclopedia into English. It was published in Philadelphia in 13 volumes, between the years 1829 and 1833. At this time, he also made translations of a French work on the revolution of July 1830 and of Feuerbach's life of Kaspar Hauser. He was also a confidant to Alexis de Tocqueville on the customs of the American people. In 1832, he received a commission from the trustees of the newly founded Girard College to form a plan of education. This was published at Philadelphia in 1834. He resided in Philadelphia from 1833 until 1835. He soon became a professor of history and political economics at South Carolina College (now the University of South Carolina), where he remained until 1856. During his 20 years at the College, he produced some of his most important works. Such writers and jurists as Mittermaier, Johann Kaspar Bluntschli, √âdouard Ren√© de Laboulaye, Joseph Story and James Kent, recognized in him a kindred mind.Betsy [Baker] R√∂ben, Johann Caspar Bluntschli, Francis Lieber und das moderne V√∂lkerrecht 1861-1881, Nomos Press, Baden-Baden 2003, with English summary: Johann Caspar Bluntschli, Francis Lieber and Modern International Law, 1861-1881, xii, 356 pp. The spirit of Lieber's work is indicated in his favorite motto, Nullum jus sine officio, nullum officium sine jure (\\"No right without its duties, no duty without its rights\\"). From 1856 until 1865, he was professor of history and political science at Columbia University (then Columbia College). His title was chosen by himself, and made him the first officially designated political scientist in the United States. In 1860, he also became professor of political science in the law school, which post he held until his death. His inaugural address as professor at Columbia, on \\"Individualism and Socialism or Communism,\\" was published by the college. Civil War activities Lieber sided with the North during the American Civil War, even though he had been a resident of South Carolina. As early as 1851, he delivered an address in South Carolina warning the southern states against secession. One of his sons, geologist Oscar Montgomery Lieber (see below), joined the Confederate army and died at the Battle of Eltham's Landing. During the conflict, Francis Lieber was one of the founders and served as the head of the Loyal Publication Society of New York, compiling news articles for dissemination among Union troops and Northern newspapers. More than one hundred pamphlets were issued by it under his supervision, of which ten were by himself. He also assisted the Union War Department and President Abraham Lincoln in drafting legal guidelines for the Union army, the most famous being General Orders Number 100, or the \\"Lieber Code\\" as it is commonly known. The Lieber Code would be adopted by other military organizations and go on to form the basis of the first laws of war. Lieber's contributions and legacy are detailed in the 2012 non-fiction account entitled, ironically, Lincoln's Code. An abridged version of the Lieber Code was published in 1899 in The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies in 1899.United States. War Department. The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. Series 2. Vol. 5. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1899, pp. 671-682. Preserving Confederate documents After the Civil War, Lieber was given the task of accumulating and preserving the records of the former government of the Confederate States of America. While working in this capacity, Lieber was one of the last known people to possess the infamous Dahlgren Affair papers. Shortly after obtaining them, Lieber was ordered to give them to Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, who likely disposed of them, as they have not been seen since. Diplomacy From 1870 until his death in New York City, aged 72, Francis Lieber served as a diplomatic negotiator between the United States and Mexico. He was chosen, with the united approval of the United States and Mexico, as final arbitrator in important cases pending between the two countries. This work was not completed at his death. Lieber was a member of the French Institute and of many learned societies in the United States and elsewhere. Family His son Oscar Montgomery Lieber was a geologist. During the Civil War, he was killed in action as a member of the Confederate army. A second son, Hamilton Lieber (7 June 1835, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - 18 October 1876, Baden-Baden, Germany), entered the volunteer army at the beginning of the civil war as 1st lieutenant, 9th Illinois Regiment, and was badly wounded at Fort Donelson. Afterward, he was appointed a captain in the veteran reserve corps, and served during the draft riots in New York City in 1863. In 1866, he was made a captain and military storekeeper in the regular army, and was retired on account of disabilities contracted in the line of duty. A third son, Guido Norman Lieber, was a United States Army lawyer and jurist. During the Civil War, he served in the Union army and later became a career officer.  Influence  In 2015, the United States Department of Defense published its Law of War Manual. Francis Lieber is cited after Hugo Grotius and Emer de Vattel and before Hersch Lauterpacht as a subsidiary means and an authority in determining the rules of law of war.

Life and work Bert Hardy rose from humble working class origins in Southwark, London. The eldest of seven children, he left school at age 14 to work for a chemist who also processed photos. His first big sale came when he photographed King George V and Queen Mary in a passing carriage, and sold 200 small prints of his best view of the King. Hardy freelanced for The Bicycle magazine, and bought his first small-format Leica 35 mm. He signed on with the General Photographic Agency as a photographer, then founded his own freelance firm Criterion. Picture Post and World War II In 1941, Hardy was recruited by the then editor Tom Hopkinson of the leading picture publication of the 1930s to the 1950s, Picture Post. Founded in 1938 and funded by publisher Edward Hulton, the magazine's first editor was Hungarian √©migr√© Stefan Lorant (1901‚Äì97) assisted by Hopkinson, who took over as editor from 1940. The picture-centric, left-leaning and reasonably-priced publication was highly successful and circulation soon rose to over a million. Hardy's photographer colleagues included Felix H. Man (aka Hans Baumann), John Chillingworth, Thurston Hopkins, Kurt Hutton, Leonard McCombe, Francis Reiss, Humphrey Spender, Grace Robertson and Bill Brandt, who went out with the writers on stories together, working as colleagues, not competitors. Hardy was self-taught and used a Leica ‚Äîunconventional gear for press photographers of the era‚Äî but went on to become the Post's Chief Photographer, after he earned his first photographer credit for his 1 February 1941 photo-essay about Blitz- stressed fire-fighters. Hardy served as a war photographer in the Army Film and Photographic Unit (AFPU) from 1942 until 1946: he took part in the D-Day landings in June 1944; covered the liberation of Paris; the allied advance across the Rhine; and was one of the first photographers to enter the liberated Belsen to record the suffering there. He also saved some Russian slaves from a fire set by German police in the city of Osnabr√ºck, before photographing the aftermath. Near the end of World War II, Hardy went to Asia, where he became Lord Mountbatten's personal photographer. He later went on the cover the Korean War along with journalist James Cameron for Picture Post, reporting on atrocities committed by Syngman Rhee's police under the United Nations flag at Pusan in 1950, and later on that war's turning point, the Battle of Inchon, photojournalism for which he won the Missouri Pictures of the Year Award.David J Marcou (2013) Crucial collaborations : contexts, departures, arrivals in the first UN-fought war (Korea) via the courageous coverages and shining deeds of Picture Post's Bert Hardy and James Cameron, and some superb UN troops, La Crosse, Wis. Late Career Hardy stayed on until Picture Post ceased publication in June 1957. It succumbed to the rise of television and falling circulation, and its increasingly unpopular identification with Labour‚Äôs ‚ÄòNew Britain and ‚ÄòFair Shares for All\\"; the party being defeated in the 1951 election. There being no other outlets for photojournalists, Hardy became an advertising photographer before giving the medium up altogether to become a farmer in 1964.  Recognition  Three of Hardy's photos were used in Edward Steichen's famous The Family of Man exhibition and book; two were taken in Burma, including one of a monk at his desk in deep thought. Another shows a young couple, much in love and relaxing by the window of a tiny basement flat, photographed for part of a feature in Picture Post magazine 'Scenes From The Elephant' published 8 January 1949, on everyday life in the Elephant and Castle district of South London. According to Hardy, the man in that portrait was a Canadian recently released from prison who had just spent a night with the prostitute in the photographer's image. One of his most famous, and Hardy long claimed his favorite, photo, shows two street urchins off on a lark in Gorbals, an image which has come to represent Hardy's keenest documentary skill. He said he liked it so much, because it represented his own rough-and-tumble upbringing, with Glasgow's Gorbals very much resembling London's Elephant & Castle District. Hardy himself was photographed many times, including during the war; three very good photo-portraits of him are currently in the Photographs Collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Having written an article for amateur photographers suggesting that you didn't need an expensive camera to take good pictures, Hardy staged a carefully posed photograph of two young women sitting on railings above a breezy Blackpool promenade using a Box Brownie in 1951, a photograph which has since become an iconic image of post-war Britain.Mystery of the Blackpool Belles finally rings true. Telegraph. Retrieved on 28 July 2016. Just before Picture Post closed, Hardy took 15 photos of the Queen's entrance at the Paris Opera on 8 April 1957, which were assembled as a photo- montage by the magazine's technicians. It was one of the most challenging photo-montages ever created, because there were a sizeable live crowd, guards, and other dignitaries, in front of his camera. After leaving Picture Post Hardy became one of the most successful advertising photographers until his retirement in 1964 to his farm in Oxted. His second wife, Sheila, was a photo researcher for Picture Post and still holds the copyright to his private collection of photos; Getty Images holds the copyright to his Picture Post works. A memorial plaque honouring him is in the journalists' church, St Bride's, Fleet Street, London. In October 2008, London Borough of Southwark unveiled a Blue Plaque on Bert Hardy's family home at The Priory, Webber Street, Southwark. The plaque was erected following a popular vote.John Prendergast (17 October 2008) BIG FAMILY TURNOUT FOR THE SNAPPER WHO DOCUMENTED THE ELEPHANT. southwarkweekender.co.uk Bibliography * Bert Hardy.

It can be found along the southern side of the Moelwyn mountain range and dates to around 1750. It joins onto the semi-urban area of Blaenau Ffestiniog, and is in the community of Ffestiniog; located between and above sea level. it is in the electoral ward of Bowydd and Rhiw which had a 2011 census population of 1878.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=W05000051 Geography The Moelwyns protect the village from much of the wind from northerly gales in the winter and give the village a pleasant southerly aspect with relatively mild weather considering its location high in Snowdonia. However rainfall in the upper end of the Ffestiniog valley can be very high all year around. Industrial Past and Present Tanygrisiau, or more properly 'Tan y grisiau', is Welsh for \\"below the steps\\", referring to the stepped cliffs above the village. Tanygrisiau was famous for its slate mining, producing a high quality black slate that was used across the world. The major quarries above the village were Cwmorthin, Wrysgan and Conglog. Tanygrisiau railway station is on the Ffestiniog Railway, a narrow gauge railway built to carry slate from the mines down to the sea at Porthmadog where it was shipped all around the world, mostly for use in roofing. The nearby Ffestiniog power station, the high Stwlan Dam and Llyn Ystradau, colloquially known as Tanygrisiau Reservoir, are part of a pumped storage hydroelectricity installation. Much nearer the railway station is a waterfall on the Afon Cwmorthin and below the falls, and powered by a different water source, is a very small hydro-electric power station. The closure of the slate mines during the late 1970s led to massive depopulation of the area from which it has only recently (2005) begun to recover. Tanygrisiau has close links with the regiment of the Royal Welsh Fusiliers. Language Welsh is the predominant language of the area and the medium of instruction in all local schools. Leisure The village is a starting point for walks into the Moelwyns, especially if the intention is to climb Moelwyn itself. Care should be taken as there are numerous mine shafts in the area. As a result of the slate mining, when the Snowdonia National Park was created, Tanygrisiau, Manod and Blaenau Ffestiniog were left outside, thus creating a doughnut-shaped area excluded from the National Park.

He was mayor of Baltimore from 1860 to 1861, professor in University of Maryland School of Law, and 2nd Chief Judge and Supreme Bench of Baltimore City. He was founder and president of the Bar Association of Baltimore City and the Library Company of the Baltimore Bar. Career Brown was admitted to the bar in 1834. Brown was a founder of the Library Company of the Baltimore Bar (1840) and from 1861 to 1874, he was its president. He was a founder of the Maryland Historical Society in 1844. The first digest of Maryland Court of Appeals decisions was compiled with his assistance and published in 1849. Brown was mayor of Baltimore, Maryland from 1860 to 1861 and a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Baltimore in 1867. From 1871 to 1873, he was a University of Maryland School of Law professor from 1871 to 1873. He was elected in 1872 to serve as 2nd Chief Judge, Supreme Bench of Baltimore City, a position he held from 1873 to 1888. He was founder (1880) and 11th president of the Bar Association of Baltimore City from 1889-1890. Pratt Street Riot Brown played an important role in controlling the Pratt Street Riot, where the first bloodshed of the Civil War occurred, on April 19, 1861. During the riot, Brown accompanied a column of the Sixth Massachusetts regiment through the streets. When the column he was leading was assailed by the mob, \\"the mayor's patience was soon exhausted, and he seized a musket from the hands of one of the men and killed a man therewith.\\" Immediately following the Riot, Baltimore saw much lawlessness, as citizens destroyed the offices of pro-Union German newspapers and looted shops in search of guns and other weapons. Mayor Brown and Maryland businessmen visited the White House to urge President Abraham Lincoln to reroute Union troops around Baltimore city to Annapolis to avoid further confrontations that they felt would result from additional troops passing through the city. In the few days following the Pratt Street Riot, Governor Hicks likely assented to Mayor Brown's decision to dispatch the Maryland militiamen to destroy the railroad bridges over the rivers north of the city, to prevent more troops from passing through Baltimore. This was an act both Hicks and Brown would later deny‚Äîthough Isaac R. Trimble, commanding Baltimore militia companies immediately following the Riot‚Äîlater claimed that Brown authorized destruction of the railroad bridges, which may explain Brown's later arrest and imprisonment by federal authorities. Shortly thereafter, a Maryland militia captain and Baltimore County farmer, John Merryman, was arrested, held at Fort McHenry and later denied a writ of habeas corpus, on grounds that President Lincoln had suspended the writ (but only along rail lines in Maryland). This arrest sparked the case of Ex parte Merryman. President Lincoln agreed to reroute Union troops around Baltimore to Annapolis, so they could then travel to Washington. Northern troops (state militia companies) were able to arrive in Washington, thus avoiding further bloodshed in Baltimore. Imprisonment On May 13, 1861, the Union army entered Baltimore, occupied the city, and declared martial law. Mayor Brown was arrested on September 12, 1861 at his homeMarcotte, F. B. (2005).

He was imprisoned at Fort McHenry for one night. He was transported to Fort Monroe in Hampton Roads, Virginia, and held for two weeks. Next, he was moved to Fort Warren in Boston Harbor and held for fourteen months. He was released on November 27, 1862. He returned to Baltimore and resumed his law practice. Francis Key Howard, the grandson of Francis Scott Key was also made a prisoner. Later life While speaking at St. John‚Äôs College in Annapolis, MD, in 1869, Brown made reference to ‚ÄúA great university hereafter to be established in Baltimore ‚Ä¶ planned ‚Ä¶ by the wealthiest of her citizens, a native of this county [ Anne Arundel County ].‚Äù While Brown did not name the individual, he was referring to Johns Hopkins, who in 1867 had announced his intention to found a university and a hospital upon his death. Brown and Hopkins were contemporaries and respected each other, so it was not surprising that Brown should be named one of the twelve original trustees of the Johns Hopkins University. After Hopkins‚Äô death on December 24, 1873, and the settling of his estate, the trustees began in earnest to plan the new university. While it was Daniel Coit Gilman‚Äôs idea to found the first research university in the United States, based on the German model, Brown heartily supported the idea. Brown also took part in debates over how much of the old classical curriculum should be preserved in the new scheme. Should Greek and Latin be replaced by modern languages? Should students be allowed to choose elective courses, or should their classes be prescribed by their course of study? How was religion to be integrated into a sectarian institution? Brown offered his own ideas, one of which was that the university should send into the world ‚Äúupright, refined, and highly cultivated young men.‚Äù He also declared that the aim of the new university should be ‚Äúto bring together a competent corps of professors, some of whom, if possible, should be teachers in the largest sense, that is, should have the ability and the leisure too, to add something by their writings and discoveries to the world‚Äôs stock of literature and science‚Ä¶.‚ÄùHugh D. Hawkins, \\"George William Brown and His Influence on the Johns Hopkins University,\\" Maryland Historical Magazine, Volume 52, No. 3 (September 1957), pp. 173-186 This idea was paraphrased and endorsed by President Gilman in his Inaugural Address delivered on February 22, 1876.https://www.jhu.edu/about/history/gilman-address/.

Economic nationalists oppose globalization or at least question the benefits of unrestricted free trade, favoring protectionism. To economic nationalists, markets are subordinate to the state, and should serve the interests of the state (such as providing national security and accumulating military power). The doctrine of mercantilism is a prominent variant of economic nationalism. Economic nationalists tend to see international trade as zero-sum, where the goal is to derive relative gains (as opposed to mutual gains). Economic nationalism tends to emphasize industrialization (and often aids industries with state support), due to beliefs that industry has positive spillover effects on the rest of the economy, enhances the self-sufficiency and political autonomy of the country, and is a crucial aspect in building military power.  History  While the coining of the term \\"economic patriotism\\" has been attributed to French parliamentarian Bernard Carayon, there is evidence that the phrase has been in use since earlier. In an early instance of its use, William Safire in 1985, in defending President Reagan's proposal of the Strategic Defense Initiative missile defense system, wrote, \\"Our common denominator is nationalism ‚Äì both a military and economic patriotism ‚Äì which inclines us to the side of pervasive national defense.\\"  Modern examples  As a policy is a deliberate system of principles to guide decisions and achieve rational outcomes, the following list of would be examples of an economic nationalistic policy, were there a consistent and rational doctrine associated with each individual protectionist measure: * Proposed takeover of Arcelor (Spain, France and Luxembourg) by Mittal Steel Company (India) * French governmental listing of Danone (France) as a 'strategic industry' to pre-empt a potential takeover bid by PepsiCo (USA) * Blocked takeover of Autostrade, an Italian toll-road operator by the Spanish company Abertis * Proposed takeover of Endesa (Spain) by E.ON (Germany), and the counter-bid by Gas Natural (Spain) * Proposed takeover of Suez (France) by Enel (Italy), and the counter-bid by Gaz de France (France) * United States Congressional opposition to the takeover bid for Unocal (USA) by CNOOC (PR China), and the subsequent takeover by Chevron (USA) * Political opposition in 2006 to sell port management businesses in six major U.S. seaports to Dubai Ports World based in the United Arab Emirates * Limits on foreign participation and ownership in Russia's natural resource sectors and selected Russian industries, beginning in 2008 The reason for a policy of economic protectionism in the cases above varied from bid to bid. In the case of Mittal's bid for Arcelor, the primary concerns involved job security for the Arcelor employees based in France and Luxembourg. The cases of French Suez and Spanish Endesa involved the desire for respective European governments to create a 'national champion' capable of competing at both a European and global level. Both the French and US government used national security as the reason for opposing takeovers of Danone, Unocal, and the bid by DP World for 6 US ports. In none of the examples given above was the original bid deemed to be against the interests of competition. In many cases the shareholders supported the foreign bid. For instance in France after the bid for Suez by Enel was counteracted by the French public energy and gas company Gaz De France the shareholders of Suez complained and the unions of Gaz De France were in an uproar because of the privatization of their jobs. More recently, the economic policies advocated by Steve Bannon in the wake of the 2016 United States presidential election have been considered by some scholars and political commentators as a (partial) return to the economic nationalism of the Theodore Roosevelt Era.M. Nicolas J. Firzli : 'Understanding Trumponomics', Revue Analyse Financi√®re, 26 January 2017 ‚Äì Supplement to Issue N¬∞62  Criticism  Consumer preference for local goods gives local producers monopoly power, affording them the ability to lift prices to extract greater profits. Firms that produce locally produced goods can charge a premium for that good. Consumers who favor products by local producers may end up being exploited by profit-maximizing local producers. For example; a protectionist policy in America placed tariffs on foreign cars, giving local producers (Ford and GM market) market power that allowed them to raise the price of cars, which negatively affected American consumers who faced fewer choices and higher prices. Locally produced goods can attract a premium if consumers show a preference towards it, so firms have an incentive to pass foreign goods off as local goods if foreign goods have cheaper costs of production than local goods.

It took place August 25-27, 1862, in Prince William County, Virginia, as part of the Northern Virginia Campaign of the American Civil War. On the evening of August 26, after passing around Union Maj. Gen. John Pope's right flank via Thoroughfare Gap, Confederate Maj. Gen. Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson's wing of the army struck the Orange & Alexandria Railroad at Bristoe Station and before daybreak August 27 marched to capture and destroy the massive Union supply depot at Manassas Junction. This surprise movement forced Pope's Army of Virginia into an abrupt retreat from his defensive line along the Rappahannock River. On August 27, Jackson routed a Union brigade near Union Mills (Bull Run Bridge), inflicting several hundred casualties and mortally wounding Union Brig. Gen. George W. Taylor. Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Confederate division fought a brisk rearguard action against Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker's Union division at Kettle Run, resulting in about 600 casualties. Ewell held back Union forces until dark. That night, Jackson marched his divisions north to the Bull Run battlefield, where he took position behind an unfinished railroad grade. Background In mid-August 1862, Confederate General Robert E. Lee attempted to cut the supply and communications lines of the Union Army of Virginia, commanded by Major General John Pope, but the Confederate offensive was stalled following the First Battle of Rappahannock Station. To break the stalemate, Lee sent the Left Wing of the army under Major General Thomas J. Jackson around the right of the Union army, through Thoroughfare Gap, and cut the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, breaking the Union supply line. The other Confederate wing commanded by Major General James Longstreet would hold Pope's attention along the Rappahannock and then follow Jackson after thirty six hours. Jackson started his march at 3 a.m. on August 25.Hennessy, pp. 92-96. Jackson's movement was observed by the Union army about 9 a.m. but Pope thought Jackson was marching to the Shenandoah Valley. Consequently, he turned his attention to Longstreet's wing, which was demonstrating along the Rappahannock River during the day. Pope's orders throughout the day were contradictory and the Union army was unable to mount an attack across the river as Pope intended. When Union cavalry spotted Jackson coming through Thoroughfare Gap, Pope pulled his forces back from the river and attempted to locate Jackson's force.Hennessy, pp. 103-110. Operations at Manassas Station Positions of forces at sunset on 26 August Jackson reached Bristoe Station on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad during the afternoon of the 26th, where his troops proceeded to wreck two trains and tear up several miles of tracks. When he learned that there was a Union supply depot at Manassas Junction several miles to the northeast, Jackson detached the brigade of Isaac R. Trimble along with cavalry support to capture the junction. After a night march Trimble launched an attack which overran the small Union garrison, capturing over 300 prisoners and eight cannons, at the loss of four men.Hennessy, pp. 110-115; Naisawald, p. 64. After receiving word of the Confederate attack on Manassas Junction during the night, Pope tried to launch several Union columns against Jackson's wing in order to surround the Confederates. He started the Army of Virginia marching northeast towards Manassas and ordered detachments from the Union forces in Washington to move by railroad westward to Manassas. The brigades of George W. Taylor and E. Parker Scammon started on the morning of August 27. Meanwhile, Jackson left Richard S. Ewell's division at Bristoe's Station to watch for Union forces and moved A. P. Hill's and William B. Taliaferro's divisions to reinforce Trimble's brigade.Hennessy, pp. 116-122. Just as Hill's division arrived at Manassas Junction, Trimble was attacked by the 2nd New York Heavy Artillery, but the attack was quickly repulsed with Hill's help. At this time, Taylor arrived by train and, unaware that he was outnumbered, proceeded to deploy his brigade for an attack. Heavy Confederate fire, especially from the artillery, caused Taylor's brigade to rout and Taylor himself was mortally wounded. Scammon's two regiments arrived and served as a rear-guard to cover the Union retreat. Union losses totaled nearly 450 (including over 200 prisoners), while the Confederates lost only twenty-five men.Hennessy, pp. 123-127; Naisawald, pp. 66-69. To the west, Ewell deployed his division along Kettle Run to serve as protection for Jackson's rear against Pope's forces. Joseph Hooker's division of the Union III Corps first encountered Ewell's skirmishers about 2:30 p.m. Ewell was able to hold his position for over an hour but Hooker then brought up his own artillery and tried to outflank the Confederate line. Shortly after 4 p.m., Ewell received orders from Jackson to retreat to Manassas Junction and successfully disengaged; Hooker was unable to pursue due to the bridge across Broad Run to the north which was burned. Ewell lost less than 150 men in the fight, while Hooker lost 400 men.Cheeks, pp. 52-55; Hennessy, pp. 129-135. Aftermath Now aware that Pope was nearby, Jackson decided to move north to the scene of the First Battle of Bull Run, where he could link up with Longstreet or retreat further north towards Aldie as circumstances dictated. After allowing the soldiers to take as much supplies as they could carry, Jackson had the rest of the supplies burned at midnight and started his troops north.Hennessy, pp. 135-138. Pope saw the fires at Manassas Junction but believed that it meant Jackson was desperate; he ordered his corps to march on Manassas from the south, east, and north. Pope knew that Longstreet was moving north towards Thoroughfare Gap but did not detach any force to delay him, believing that the Union army could defeat Jackson before Longstreet could arrive.Hennessy, pp. 138-141. The defeat of Taylor's force convinced George B. McClellan, commanding the Union forces in Washington, not to send any further reinforcements to Pope unless they had artillery and cavalry.Hennessy, pp. 127-129.

Traditional genealogies trace the ancestors of the Mackenzie chiefs to the 12th century. However, the earliest Mackenzie chief recorded by contemporary evidence is Alexander Mackenzie of Kintail who died some time after 1471. Traditionally, during the Wars of Scottish Independence, the Mackenzies supported Robert the Bruce, but feuded with the Earls of Ross in the latter part of the 14th century. During the 15th and 16th-centuries the Mackenzies feuded with the neighboring clans of Munro and MacDonald. In the 17th century the Mackenzie chief was made Earl of Seaforth in the peerage of Scotland. During the Scottish Civil War of the 17th century the Mackenzies largely supported the Royalists. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the chief and clan of Mackenzie supported the Jacobite cause. However, during the Jacobite rising of 1745 the clan was divided with the chief, Kenneth Mackenzie, Lord Fortrose, supporting the British-Hanoverian Government and his relative, George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie, supporting the Jacobites. History=OriginsTraditional origins= The surname Mackenzie in Scottish Gaelic is MacCoinneach which means son of the fair bright one. The Mackenzies are believed to have the same ancestry as the Clan Matheson and Clan Anrias. All three are said to be descended from Gilleoin of the Aird, a Gaelic dynast who lived in the early 12th century. Another theory is that all three are descended from the thirteenth century Kermac Macmaghan. The chiefs of the Clan Mackenzie are said to have been settled at their great stronghold on Eilean Donan by 1297. All of the earliest traditional Clan Mackenzie histories claim descent from a Fitzgerald progenitor. These histories include those by John Mackenzie of Applecross (died c.1684/5), George Mackenzie first Earl of Cromarty (died 1714) and the unpublished Letterfearn, Ardintoul and Allangrange manuscripts. It is believed that all of these histories ultimately derive from a single manuscript created by William MacQueen, Parson of Assynt in 1576, now lost. Alexander Mackenzie followed the Fitzgerald scheme for the first edition of his History of the Mackenzies in 1879, but abandoned it in his later 1894 edition based on the intervening publication of genealogies contained in MS 1467. MS 1467 was compiled 200 years before the earliest surviving Mackenzie traditional history. The Mackenzie and Matheson genealogies in MS 1467, which end c.1400, both derive from a Gilleoin of the Aird, but make no mention of Fitzgerald. The genealogies in MS 1467 have been interpreted as in part a census of the military resources available to Domhnall lord of the Isles in a period when he was seeking to make good his wife's claims to the earldom of Ross, culminating in the battle of Harlaw in 1411. Based on MS 1467 and a series of charters associated with Beauly Priory, it has been suggested that the Mackenzies and Mathesons were junior branches of the Del Ard family, heirs to Gilleoin of the Aird. The senior line of this family, prominent in the 13th and 14th centuries, terminated in the heiress Margaret del Ard, the Lady of Erchless, who married Alexander Chisolm of Cromer c.1350. In the 14th century during the Wars of Scottish Independence the Clan Mackenzie is said to have been among the clans who fought on the side of Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Inverurie (1308) against the forces of the Clan Comyn who were rivals to the throne. Chief Iain Mac Coinnich is said to have led a force of five hundred Mackenzies at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 where the English were defeated. Later in the 14th century the Mackenzies are said to have become involved in battles against their powerful neighbour the Earl of Ross and his allies. This resulted in the capture and subsequent execution of chief Kenneth Mackenzie in 1346. Soon after this it appears that his successor as chief of the clan Mackenzie was living in an island castle in Loch Kinellan near Strathpeffer in Easter Ross and it was from this base that the clan was to advance westward once again to Kintail. =Recorded origins= The earliest likeness of a Mackenzie - the effigy of Kenneth Mackenzie, 7th of Kintail (d. 1491/ 1492) located at Beauly Priory. An early genealogy of the Mackenzies appears in MS 1467, but the earliest contemporary record of a living Mackenzie is of Alexander Mackenzie of Kintail (Alexandro McKennye de Kintaill) who appeared in two supplications for papal dispensation in 1465 and 1466, and was listed as a witness to a charter by John of Islay, Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles on 4 November 1471. The earliest known likeness of a Mackenzie is that of Sir Kenneth Mackenzie (d. 7 February 1491/1492), whose effigy can be seen at Beauly Priory. He is the first Mackenzie to be buried at Beauly Priory. There is no reliable evidence to support the traditional assertion that previous members of his family were buried at Iona. 15th century and clan conflicts In 1452 a force of tribes loyal to Mackenzie of Kintail took hostage a relative of the Earl of Ross. This resulted in the Battle of Bealach nam Broig which was fought to the north-west of Ben Wyvis. The Clan Munro and their septs the Dingwalls rescued the Ross hostage but won a hollow victory, with a great loss of their own men. In 1488 the Clan Mackenzie fought at the Battle of Sauchieburn led by Hector Roy Mackenzie but after the defeat of the King's forces there, Hector narrowly escaped, returning to Ross-shire where he took Redcastle from the Clan Rose, for the rebels. In 1491 the Battle of Blar Na Pairce was fought between the Mackenzies and the MacDonalds. This was followed by the Raid on Ross also in 1491 when the Clan Mackenzie clashed with a number of clans including the Clan MacDonald of Lochalsh, Clan MacDonald of Clanranald, Clan Cameron and the Chattan Confederation of Clan Mackintosh. In 1497 Alexander MacDonald of Lochalsh and his clan rebelled against the King. MacDonald invaded the fertile lands of Ross-shire where he was defeated in battle by the Mackenzies at the Battle of Drumchatt (1497), after which he was driven out of Ross-shire. 16th century and clan conflicts During the Anglo-Scottish Wars John Mackenzie, 9th of Kintail led the clan at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. John was lucky enough to escape but many of his followers lost their lives. John Mackenzie also fought at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 where he was captured by the English. However, his clan paid a ransom of cows for his release. The growing importance of the Clan Mackenzie was vividly demonstrated in 1544 when the Earl of Huntly, the Lieutenant of the North, commanded chief John Mackenzie to raise his clan against Clan Ranald of Moidart. The Mackenzie chief refused and Huntly's supporters, the Clan Grant, Clan Ross and Clan Mackintosh declined to attack the Mackenzies. From that time the Mackenzies were recognised as a separate and superior force in the north-west. On 13 December 1545 at Dingwall, the Earl of Sutherland entered into a bond of manrent with John Mackenzie of Kintail for mutual defence against all enemies, reserving only their allegiance to the youthful Mary, Queen of Scots. At the Battle of Langside in 1568 the Mackenzies fought on the side of Mary, Queen of Scots, against the forces of her half-brother James Stewart, Earl of Moray. Their chief, Kenneth Mackenzie, 10th of Kintail died soon afterwards. In 1570 a feud broke out with the Munros over the Castle Chanonry of Ross. Andrew Munro of Milntown defended it for 3 years against the Clan Mackenzie, at the expense of many lives on both sides. The feud was settled when the castle was handed over to the Mackenzies by an \\"Act of Pacification\\". In 1597 the Battle of Logiebride took place between the Mackenzies and MacLeods of Rassay against the Munros and the Bain family of Tulloch Castle. 17th century and Civil War Commemorative stone to the Mackenzies of Seaforth on the Isle of Lewis. The Mackenzie chief's title of Earl of Seaforth took its name from Loch Seaforth between the Isles of Lewis and Harris By the beginning of the 17th century the territory of the Mackenzies extended from the Black Isle in the east to the Outer Hebrides in the west. They took over the Isle of Lewis from its former Clan MacLeod of Lewis rulers and also Loch Alsh from the MacDonells. The Battle of Morar in 1602 was fought between the Clan Mackenzie and Clan MacDonell of Glengarry. In 1623, the clan chief Colin Mackenzie was made Earl of Seaforth, a title in the peerage of Scotland, taking his title from a sea loch on the Isle of Lewis. In 1645, Lord Seaforth, fighting as a Covenanter, led a force against the royalist James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose, at the Battle of Auldearn where the Covenanters were defeated. Montrose followed up his success by destroying many houses that belonged to people who had opposed the royalist cause, including that of Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine. Later in 1649 Thomas Mackenzie of Pluscardine adopted the royalist cause and led his own uprising in the Siege of Inverness (1649). In 1672, the Mackenzies were granted a commission of \\"fire and sword\\" against the MacLeods of Assynt who were a branch of the Clan MacLeod of Lewis and were seated at Ardvreck Castle, which was attacked and captured by the Mackenzies, who took control of the lands of Assynt. In 1688, Kenneth Mackenzie of Suddie was killed leading a Government- backed Independent Highland Company in support of Mackintosh of Mackintosh against the Clan MacDonald of Keppoch who were supported by the Clan Cameron at the Battle of Mulroy. During the Williamite War in Ireland the Clan Mackenzie (led by their chief Kenneth Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Seaforth) are believed to have supported King James at the Siege of Derry and the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. 18th century and Jacobite risings During the Jacobite rising of 1715 chief William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth led the Clan Mackenzie in support of the Jacobite rebels. However, during the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Clan Mackenzie was divided: The chief, Kenneth Mackenzie, Lord Fortrose, did not support the Jacobites and raised several Independent Highland Companies from the Clan Mackenzie to support the British Government. However, during the 1745 rising a large part of the Clan Mackenzie followed the chief's cousin, George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie who was a Jacobite. =1715 and 1719 Jacobite risings= In what is known as the Skirmish of Alness in 1715 the Earl of Seaforth, chief of Mackenzie led a force of 3000 men that forced the retreat of a smaller force loyal to the British Government, which was commanded by the Earl of Sutherland and included the clans Sutherland, Munro, Ross and Mackay. Much of the Ross's and Munro's lands were ravaged, but they retaliated by raiding the Mackenzie lands in what is known as the Siege of Brahan. The Siege of Inverness (1715) came to an end when the town, which was being held by the Mackenzies was surrendered to Simon Fraser of Lovat. Soon after this Colonel Sir Robert Munro, 6th Baronet of Foulis marched into the town of Inverness with 400 Munros and took over control as governor from Fraser. Government troops arrived in Inverness towards the end of February, and for some months the process of disarming the rebels went on, led by a Munro detachment under George Munro of Culcairn. The clan rivalries which had erupted in rebellion were finding an outlet in local politics. The Mackenzie's position as Earl of Seaforth came to an end in 1716, and it seems to have been arranged that while the Clan Ross held the county seat the Munros would represent the Tain Burghs. To secure the burghs, control of three out of the five was necessary. Ross ascendancy was secure in Tain, and from 1716 to 1745 the Munros controlled Dingwall. The Clan Mackenzie fought at the Battle of Glen Shiel in 1719 where they were defeated by Government forces and the Mackenzie chief was wounded, afterwards retreating to the Western Isles and from there to the Continent. In 1721 the Clan Mackenzie, led by Donald Murchison, defeated Government supporters from the Clan Ross at the Battle of Glen Affric. This was followed by the Battle of Coille Bhan where again, led by Donald Murchison and also his relative Kenneth Murchison, the Clan Mackenzie defeated Government forces. General Wade's report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 3,000 men. =1745 Jacobite rising= George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie led the Jacobite Mackenzies at the Battle of Falkirk (1746) where they were victorious in helping to defeat British Government forces. The Mackenzies then went on to lay waste to the lands of the Munros who supported the Government and burn down Foulis Castle. They also went on to lay waste to the lands of the Clan Sutherland and the Earl of Sutherland who also supported the Government, and captured Dunrobin Castle, although the Earl of Sutherland himself escaped through a back door. However, soon after this as the Earl of Cromartie and his forces were travelling south to meet Charles Edward Stuart they were attacked by the Mackay and Sutherland Independent Highland Companies who supported the British Government in what became known as the Battle of Littleferry and the Jacobite Mackenzies were prevented from joining the Jacobite army at the Battle of Culloden. Soon after George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie and his son were captured at Dunrobin Castle. The Earl of Cromartie's titles were then forfeited. Other Mackenzies took the side of the British Government: the chief, Kenneth Mackenzie, Lord Fortrose had in fact raised three Independent Highland Companies to support the British Government. In one of the Independent Highland Companies under Captain Colin Mackenzie it is recorded at Shiramore in Badenoch in June 1746 and it included many of them from Kintail as well as more than sixty men from the Clan MacRae. =War, France, and India= A number of famous regiments have been raised from the Mackenzie clan, including the Highland Light Infantry (raised in 1777), the Seaforth Highlanders (raised in 1778), and the second battalion of the Seaforth Highlanders, known as the Ross-shire Buffs (raised in 1793). All those regiments wore the MacKenzie tartan. Born in 1754, Chief Francis Mackenzie, 1st Baron Seaforth, the last Lord Seaforth raised a regiment for the British Army in 1778, the 72nd, and the clan produced another the 78th in 1793. Both had distinguished records fighting against Napoleon and were later amalgamated into the Queen's Own Highlanders. The 78th Regiment, as it was first called, was raised in 1778 from men on the Seaforth and other Mackenzie estates. The Earl of Seaforth, having raised his men, sailed with them to India in 1781, but died there a few months later. During the Wars in India, Colin Mackenzie (1754‚Äì1821) was Surveyor General of India, and an art collector and orientalist. He produced many of the first accurate maps of India, and his research and collections contributed significantly to the field of Asian studies. In 1799, he was part of the British force at the Battle of Seringapatam. He also fought in the Napoleonic Wars. Modern history Clan Mackenzie tent at the 2005 Bellingham Highland Games Throughout the 19th century Clan Mackenzie was without a chief that was recognised by the Lord Lyon King of Arms. In 1979, Roderick Grant Francis Blunt-Mackenzie, 4th Earl of Cromartie, legally changed his surname to Mackenzie and was widely recognised as Chief of the clan (for example by Clan Mackenzie Societies around the Commonwealth). Although not descended from a Mackenzie in the male line (his father was born a Blunt and later changed to Blunt-Mackenzie after marrying Sibell Lilian Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, Countess of Cromartie) he inherited his titles and Mackenzie descent through his mother (even she only claims a Mackenzie descent as a great-great-great-great-granddaughter of George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie). On his death in 1990 his son John Ruaridh Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Cromartie succeeded as chief of Clan Mackenzie.McKenzie, Alan. History of the Mackenzies , pp. 176‚Äì177. (link to chapter 11 ) The Earl of Cromartie still owns lands in clan country however, the largest remaining Mackenzie landowner by some margin is Mackenzie of Gairloch, with an estate which extends to over 50,000 acres (like the clan chief, Mackenzie of Gairloch has inherited his clan name and lands through the female line).Moncreiffe of that Ilk, pp.150‚Äì154.Gairloch (Flowerdale & Shieldaig) & Conon .

The chief has leased the unoccupied old tower to the Clan Mackenzie Charitable Trust (CMCT) for 99 years. In 1991 it was announced that the castle was planned to be restored. The restoration was to include a clan genealogical centre that would be open to the public. During the 1990s there was extensive work done on the tower. In 2002 the Highland Buildings Preservation Trust (HBPT) was contacted, to carry out a feasibility study to investigate the potential for the re-use of the upper floor space of the tower, which deemed public funding to be sought to cover the costs of restoration. Because of concerns of physical and legal separation between the clan chief and the tower, the chief decided that the conditions of public funding were too onerous.Castle Leod .

This Gaelic title is derived from the stag's head charge on the former chief, the Earl of Seaforth's Coat of Arms. Castles Castle owned by the Clan Mackenzie have included: *Eilean Donan Castle was long held by the Mackenzies of Kintail and it may have been given to them after they helped to defeat the Norsemen at the Battle of Largs in 1263. William Mackenzie, 5th Earl of Seaforth had the castle garrisoned with Spanish troops during the Jacobite rising of 1719, although the castle was battered into submission by three frigates, and it was then blown up from within with barrels of gunpowder. The ghost of one of the Spanish soldiers who was killed is said to haunt the castle. The castle was left very ruinous before being completely rebuilt in the twentieth century. *Brahan Castle, about three miles south-west of Dingwall has now been completely demolished except for one wall. It was held by the Mackenzies of Brahan who were patrons of the Brahan Seer. *Castle Leod which is a few miles west of Dingwall is an L-plan tower house that dates from the seventeenth century with later additions. The current Castle Leod was built by Sir Roderick Mackenzie of Coigach in about 1610. His descendant was George Mackenzie, 3rd Earl of Cromartie who was forfeited for his part in the Jacobite rising of 1745 after being captured at Dunrobin Castle. *Ardvreck Castle was built by the MacLeods of Assynt but it later passed to the Mackenzies who sacked the castle in 1672. *Fairburn Tower was built for Murdo Mackenzie in the 1540s. It is a ruin and the Landmark Trust plans to restore it. *Kilcoy Castle near Muir of Ord, Ross and Cromarty, is a Z-plan tower house that was held from 1618 by Alexander Mackenzie, son of the eleventh baron of Kintail, chief of the clan. It was once ruinous but has now been restored and is still occupied. *Redcastle near Muir of Ord, near Ross and Cromarty, is a ruined L-plan tower house that was held by the Mackenzies from 1570 to 1790. It was burned in 1649 and later passed to the Ballies of Dochfour. The castle is now a shell. *Tarbat House was erected by John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod with work starting in 1784. It was built on the site of a previous mansion which had been built for George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie in the late 17th century, replacing Milntown Castle. When George Mackenzie bought the Milntown estate in 1656, he renamed it New Tarbat after Tarbat Castle, the family's original seat near Portmahomack.Tarbat Castle in Portmahomack, which still exists as a ruin, is more commonly known as Ballone Castle. See RCAHMS. Site Record: Ballone Castle Some of the remains of George Mackenzie's mansion were incorporated into the new one. Concurrent with the construction of the new house, Lord MacLeod planted thousands of new forest and fir trees on the estate. Some of the final building work on the house was unfinished when he died in 1789 after a year-long illness. The remaining work was completed to his plans by his cousin and successor, Kenneth Mackenzie. Tartan The Mackenzie dress tartan is a modern tartan.

The name is an Anglicised form of the Gaelic Mac Coinnich, which is a patronymic form of the personal name Coinneach meaning \\"comely\\" or \\"handsome\\".McKenzie Name Meaning and History Retrieved 2008-03-14 (the website cites: Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, ).Kenneth Name Meaning and History Retrieved on 2008-03-16 (the website cites: Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, ). Today personal name Coinneach is generally Anglicised as Kenneth however Kenneth was originally used as an Anglicisation of different Gaelic personal name ‚Äì Cionaodh. The Anglicised Mackenzie had originally been pronounced \\"Mackaingye\\" ‚Äì with a modern English Y sound represented with the letter yogh . In the 18th century it became popular to write and pronounce the name with what is the equivalent of a modern English Z sound, because of the similarity of the letter yogh and letter Z. There are Lowland Scots words and Scottish names that have been affected in a similar way (example: the surname Menzies).Menzies Name Meaning and History Retrieved on 2008-03-16 (the website cites: Dictionary of American Family Names, Oxford University Press, ). In fiction Fictional Mackenzies appear in the Outlander series of books by Diana Gabaldon. The Seat of the Clan Mackenzie, Castle Leod is widely considered to be the inspiration behind Castle Leoch, the home of the Clan Mackenzie, in Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. It was considered as a filming location for the TV series, however, Doune Castle was selected due to its ease of location. This may be surprising to viewers who know Castle Leod as the seat of the Clan Mackenzie and accurately represents the historical period which Diana Gabaldon seeks to portray. Diana Gabaldon told STV that \\"When the TV show began scouting locations, I suggested Leod as a possibility. It's entirely accurate as to period, of course, and has magnificent grounds, with a park of enormous, exotic trees planted by centuries of MacKenzies and their visitors. (Diana herself planted a \\"very modest\\" rowan, as her \\"own wee contribution\\" to the history). In the Emberverse series by S.M. Stirling, otherwise known as the 'Change' world, the founder of the Clan Mackenzie, Juniper Mackenzie, is descended from this Scottish clan.

Confederate forces under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet successfully drove back Union forces under Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts and Col. Percy Wyndham, allowing his corps to unite with that of Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson prior to the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas). Background Longstreet's troops march through the Gap On August 26, Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson led his corps of the Army of Northern Virginia through Thoroughfare Gap, on his way to raiding the Union supply depot at the Manassas Junction. In response to the raid, the following day Union Maj. Gen. Irwin McDowell set out from Warrenton to Manassas Junction to engage Jackson. In order to protect his army's left flank, he dispatched Brig. Gen. James B. Ricketts's brigade and the 1st New Jersey Cavalry under Sir Percy Wyndham towards the Gap. Ricketts stopped at Gainesville, to the east, while Wyndham occupied the gap. Maj. Gen. James Longstreet's corps, meanwhile, followed in the path of Jackson's march and was approaching the gap from the west late on the evening of August 27.Hennessy, pp. 148, 153-54. Battle Map of Thoroughfare Gap Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program At 9:30 a.m. on August 28, Wyndham's troopers encountered Longstreet's vanguard while attempting to fell trees across the road on the east side of the gap. Wyndham immediately dispatched a courier to Ricketts at Gainesville. Ricketts's advance was slow, however, and he had only reached Haymarket, to the east, by 2 p.m. By that point, Wyndham had been driven from the Gap and Longstreet took possession of it. The Federal position was still strong though, as a series of low-lying ridges east of the gap provided an excellent ground for defending the road to Gainesville, and the Confederates had not occupied the hills to the north and south of the gap.Hennessy, pp. 154-55. In order to meet this Union threat, Longstreet developed a plan, whereby he would command the gap from the high ground on either side and then outflank the Union position on the eastern ridge. The 9th Georgia from Col. George T. Anderson's brigade was sent to Chapman's Mill on the east side of the gap to repulse a Federal attack by the 11th Pennsylvania, who ironically, to reach the gap, had to remove the trees felled by Wyndham earlier that morning. The impediment allowed Anderson to send half of his brigade up to the slope to the north of the gap to occupy the high ground while still having sufficient men to repulse the 11th Pennsylvania. To the south of the gap, the 2nd and 20th Georgia regiments from Henry Benning's brigade raced up the slopes on the west against the 13th Massachusetts, climbing up the east side. The Georgians won out and drove the 13th Massachusetts back down the steep slopes.Hennessy, pp. 155-58. With the gap firmly in Confederate control, Col. Evander M. Law's brigade was ordered up and over the ridge to the north of the gap to attack the Federal right. At the same time, Brig. Gen. Cadmus M. Wilcox was sent with three brigades to the north, through Hopewell Gap, to outflank the Federal position and attack its rear. When Law's brigade came down the eastern slope of the mountain and attacked the Federal right, Ricketts sent the 84th New York against them, temporarily checking Law's advance. The 2nd and 20th Georgia, however, pressed down the slopes to the south and soon attacked the Federal left. With his position rapidly becoming untenable, Ricketts decided to fall back on Gainesville, leaving the gap to the Confederates before Wilcox could cut off his line of retreat.Hennessy, pp. 158-60. Aftermath In terms of casualties, the battle was small, with only 100 casualties on both sides combined, but had major strategic consequences. Ricketts failed to fully comprehend the importance of keeping the two wings of the Confederate army apart. Rather than entrenching his force in a strong defensive position at the gap, the easiest and quickest crossing of the Bull Run Range, he left only cavalry there while he sat a half-day's march away at Gainesville, protecting the railroad, a job much more suited for his cavalry. As such, he lost the advantage and the only hope his small force had in seriously hindering Longstreet's advance. His failure to do so allowed the two wings of the Confederate army to unite at Manassas and virtually ensured Pope's defeat during the Second Battle of Bull Run on August 29.Hennessy, pp. 160-61.

Photograph of a meniscus of polyvinyl alcohol in aqueous solution showing a fibre being electrospun from a Taylor cone. Electrospinning is a fiber production method which uses electric force to draw charged threads of polymer solutions or polymer melts up to fiber diameters in the order of some hundred nanometers. Electrospinning shares characteristics of both electrospraying and conventional solution dry spinning of fibers.Ziabicki, A. (1976) Fundamentals of fiber formation, John Wiley and Sons, London, . The process does not require the use of coagulation chemistry or high temperatures to produce solid threads from solution. This makes the process particularly suited to the production of fibers using large and complex molecules. Electrospinning from molten precursors is also practiced; this method ensures that no solvent can be carried over into the final product. Process When a sufficiently high voltage is applied to a liquid droplet, the body of the liquid becomes charged, and electrostatic repulsion counteracts the surface tension and the droplet is stretched; at a critical point a stream of liquid erupts from the surface. This point of eruption is known as the Taylor cone. If the molecular cohesion of the liquid is sufficiently high, stream breakup does not occur (if it does, droplets are electrosprayed) and a charged liquid jet is formed.High speed video of the taylor cone formation and electrospinning. youtube.comSingle nozzle electrospinning process nanofiber formation video. youtube.com As the jet dries in flight, the mode of current flow changes from ohmic to convective as the charge migrates to the surface of the fiber. The jet is then elongated by a whipping process caused by electrostatic repulsion initiated at small bends in the fiber, until it is finally deposited on the grounded collector.High speed video of the whipping instability. youtube.com The elongation and thinning of the fiber resulting from this bending instability leads to the formation of uniform fibers with nanometer-scale diameters. { How the distribution of charge in the fibre changes as the fibre dries during flight Diagram showing fibre formation by electrospinning } Parameters * Molecular weight, molecular-weight distribution and architecture (branched, linear etc.) of the polymer * Solution properties (viscosity, conductivity and surface tension) * Electric potential, flow rate and concentration * Distance between the capillary and collection screen * Ambient parameters (temperature, humidity and air velocity in the chamber) * Motion and size of target screen (collector) * Needle gauge Apparatus and range The standard laboratory setup for electrospinning consists of a spinneret (typically a hypodermic syringe needle) connected to a high-voltage (5 to 50 kV) direct current power supply, a syringe pump, and a grounded collector. A polymer solution, sol-gel, particulate suspension or melt is loaded into the syringe and this liquid is extruded from the needle tip at a constant rate by a syringe pump. Alternatively, the droplet at the tip of the spinneret can be replenished by feeding from a header tank providing a constant feed pressure. This constant pressure type feed works better for lower viscosity feedstocks. { Electrospinning/electrospraying schematic with variations for different processing outcomes.

Electrospun fibers can adopt a porous or core‚Äìshell morphology depending on the type of materials being spun as well as the evaporation rates and miscibility for the solvents involved. For techniques which involve multiple spinning fluids, the general criteria for the creation of fibers depends upon the spinnability of the outer solution. This opens up the possibility of creating composite fibers which can function as drug delivery systems or possess the ability to self-heal upon failure. Coaxial electrospinning A stainless steel coaxial spinneret manufactered by ram√©- hart instrument co., Succasunna, NJ. A coaxial setup uses a dual-solution feed system which allows for the injection of one solution into another at the tip of the spinneret. The sheath fluid is believed to act as a carrier which draws in the inner fluid at the Taylor Cone of the electrospinning jet. If the solutions are immiscible then a core shell structure is usually observed. Miscible solutions however can result in porosity or a fiber with distinct phases due to phase separation during solidification of the fiber. For more advanced setups, a triaxial or quadaxial (tetra-axial) spinneret can be used with multiple solutions. Emulsion electrospinning Emulsions can be used to create core shell or composite fibers without modification of the spinneret. However, these fibers are usually more difficult to produce as compared to coaxial spinning due to the greater number of variables which must be accounted for in creating the emulsion. A water phase and an immiscible solvent phase are mixed in the presence of an emulsifying agent to form the emulsion. Any agent which stabilizes the interface between the immiscible phases can be used. Surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, Triton and nanoparticles have been used successfully. During the electrospinning process the emulsion droplets within the fluid are stretched and gradually confined leading to their coalescence. If the volume fraction of inner fluid is sufficiently high, a continuous inner core can be formed. Electrospinning of blends is a variation of this technique which uses the fact that polymers are generally immiscible with each and can phase segregate without the use of surfactants. This method can be simplified further if a solvent which dissolves both polymers is used. Melt electrospinning Electrospinning of polymer melts eliminates the need for volatile solvents in solution electrospinning. Semi crystalline polymer fibers such as PE, PET and PP, which would otherwise be impossible or very difficult to create using solution spinning, can be created. The setup is very similar to that employed in conventional electrospinning and includes the use of a syringe or spinneret, a high voltage supply and the collector. The polymer melt is usually produced by heating from either resistance heating, circulating fluids, air heating or lasers. Due to the high viscosity of polymer melts, the fiber diameters are usually slightly larger than those obtained from solution electrospinning. The fiber uniformity upon achieving stable flow rates and thermal equilibrium, tends to be very good. The whipping instability which is the predominant stage in which the fiber is stretched for spinning from solutions can be absent from the process due to the low melt conductivity and high viscosity of the melt. The most significant factors which affect the fiber size tend to be the feed rate, the molecular weight of the polymer and the diameter of the spinneret. Fiber sizes ranging from ~250 nm to several hundreds of micrometers have been created thus far with the lower sizes being achieved using low molecular weight polymers. History In the late 16th century William GilbertGilbert, W. (1628) De Magnete, Magneticisque Corporibus, et de Magno Magnete Tellure (On the Magnet and Magnetic Bodies, and on That Great Magnet the Earth), London, Peter Short. set out to describe the behavior of magnetic and electrostatic phenomena. He observed that when a suitably electrically charged piece of amber was brought near a droplet of water it would form a cone shape and small droplets would be ejected from the tip of the cone: this is the first recorded observation of electrospraying. In 1887 C. V. Boys described ‚Äúthe old, but little known experiment of electrical spinning‚Äù. Boys‚Äô apparatus consisted of ‚Äúa small dish, insulated and connected with an electrical machine‚Äù. He found that as his stock liquid reached the edge of the dish, that he could draw fibers from a number of materials including shellac, beeswax, sealing-wax, gutta-percha and collodion. The process of electrospinning was patented by J.F. Cooley in May 1900Cooley, J.F. Patent GB 06385 \\"Improved methods of and apparatus for electrically separating the relatively volatile liquid component from the component of relatively fixed substances of composite fluids\\" 19th May 1900 and February 1902Cooley, J. F. et al. \\"Apparatus for electrically dispersing fluids\\" Issue date: February 4, 1902 and by W.J. Morton in July 1902.Morton, W.J. et al. \\"Method of dispersing fluids\\" Issue date: July 29, 1902 In 1914 John Zeleny, published work on the behavior of fluid droplets at the end of metal capillaries. His effort began the attempt to mathematically model the behavior of fluids under electrostatic forces. Further developments toward commercialization were made by Anton Formhals, and described in a sequence of patents from 1934Formhals, Anton et al. \\"Process and apparatus for preparing artificial threads\\" Issue date: October 2, 1934 to 1944Formhals, Anton et al. \\"Method and apparatus for spinning\\" Issue date: May 30, 1944 for the fabrication of textile yarns. Electrospinning from a melt rather than a solution was patented by C.L. Norton in 1936Norton, C.L. \\"Method and apparatus for producing fibrous or filamentary material\\" Issue date: July 21, 1936 using an air-blast to assist fiber formation. In 1938 Nathalie D. Rozenblum and Igor V. Petryanov-Sokolov, working in Nikolai A. Fuchs' group at the Aerosol Laboratory of the L. Ya. Karpov InstituteFiber Materials Electrospinning Laboratory (FMEL) . electrospinning.ru in the USSR, generated electrospun fibers, which they developed into filter materials known as \\"Petryanov filters\\". By 1939, this work had led to the establishment of a factory in Tver' for the manufacture of electrospun smoke filter elements for gas masks. The material, dubbed BF (Battlefield Filter) was spun from cellulose acetate in a solvent mixture of dichloroethane and ethanol. By the 1960s output of spun filtration material was claimed as 20 million m2 per annum.Filatov, Y. Budyka, A. Kirichenko, V. (Trans. D. Letterman) (2007) Electrospinning of micro- and nanofibers: fundamentals and applications in separation and filtration processes, Begell House Inc., New York, USA, . Between 1964 and 1969 Sir Geoffrey Ingram Taylor produced the theoretical underpinning of electrospinning. Taylor‚Äôs work contributed to electrospinning by mathematically modeling the shape of the cone formed by the fluid droplet under the effect of an electric field; this characteristic droplet shape is now known as the Taylor cone. He further worked with J. R. Melcher to develop the \\"leaky dielectric model\\" for conducting fluids. Simon, in a 1988 NIH SBIR grant report, showed that solution electrospinning could be used to produced nano- and submicron-scale polystyrene and polycarbonate fibrous mats specifically intended for use as in vitro cell substrates. This early application of electrospun fibrous lattices for cell culture and tissue engineering showed that various cell types would adhere to and proliferate upon the fibers in vitro. Small changes in the surface chemistry of the fibers were also observed depending upon the polarity of the electric field during spinning. In the early 1990s several research groups (notably that of Reneker and Rutledge who popularised the name electrospinning for the process) demonstrated that many organic polymers could be electrospun into nanofibers. Since then, the number of publications about electrospinning has been increasing exponentially every year. Since 1995 there have been further theoretical developments of the driving mechanisms of the electrospinning process. Reznik et al. described the shape of the Taylor cone and the subsequent ejection of a fluid jet. Hohman et al. investigated the relative growth rates of the numerous proposed instabilities in an electrically forced jet once in flight and endeavors to describe the most important instability to the electrospinning process, the bending (whipping) instability. Uses The size of an electrospun fiber can be in the nano scale and the fibers may possess nano scale surface texture, leading to different modes of interaction with other materials compared with macroscale materials.Ajayan P. M., Schadler, L. S. and Braun, P. V. (2003) Nanocomposite Science and Technology, Weinheim, Wiley-VCH, , . In addition to this, the ultra-fine fibers produced by electrospinning are expected to have two main properties, a very high surface to volume ratio, and a relatively defect free structure at the molecular level. This first property makes electrospun material suitable for activities requiring a high degree of physical contact, such as providing sites for chemical reactions, or the capture of small sized particulate material by physical entanglement ‚Äì filtration. The second property should allow electrospun fibers to approach the theoretical maximum strength of the spun material, opening up the possibility of making high mechanical performance composite materials. Filtration Lycopodium club moss spores (diameter about 60 micrometers) captured on an electrospun polyvinyl alcohol fiber The use of nanofiber webs as a filtering medium is well established. Due to the small size of the fibers London-Van Der Waals forces are an important method of adhesion between the fibers and the captured materials. Polymeric nanofibers have been used in air filtration applications for more than seven decades.Donaldson Nanofiber Products Because of poor bulk mechanical properties of thin nanowebs, they are laid over a filtration medium substrate. The small fiber diameters cause slip flows at fiber surfaces, causing an increase in the interception and inertial impaction efficiencies of these composite filter media. The enhanced filtration efficiency at the same pressure drop is possible with fibers having diameters less than 0.5 micrometer. Since the essential properties of protective clothing are high moisture vapor transport, increased fabric breath-ability, and enhanced toxic chemical resistance, electrospun nanofiber membranes are good candidates for these applications. Textile manufacturing The majority of early patents for electrospinning were for textile applications, however little woven fabric was actually produced, perhaps due to difficulties in handling the barely visible fibers. However, electrospinning has the potential to produce seamless non-woven garments by integrating advanced manufacturing with fiber electrospinning. This would introduce multi-functionality (flame, chemical, environmental protection) by blending fibers into electrospinlaced (using electrospinning to combine different fibers and coatings to form three- dimensional shapes, such as clothing) layers in combination with polymer coatings. Medical Electrospinning can also be used for medical purposes. The electrospun scaffolds made for tissue engineering applications can be penetrated with cells to treat or replace biological targets. Nanofibrous wound dressings have excellent capability to isolate the wound from microbial infections. Other medical textile materials such as sutures are also attainable via electrospinning. Through the addition of a drug substance into the electrospinning solution or melt diverse fibrous drug delivery systems (e.g., implants, transdermal patches, oral forms) can be prepared. Cosmetic Electrospun nanomaterials have been employed to control their delivery so they can work within skin to improve its appearance. Electrospinning is an alternative to traditional nanoemulsions and nanoliposomes. Pharmaceutical manufacturing The continuous manner and the effective drying effect enable the integration of electrospinning into continuous pharmaceutical manufacturing systems. The synthetized liquid drug can be quickly turned into an electrospun solid product processable for tableting and other dosage forms. Composites Ultra-fine electrospun fibers show clear potential for the manufacture of long fiber composite materials. Application is limited by difficulties in making sufficient quantities of fiber to make substantial large scale articles in a reasonable time scale. For this reason medical applications requiring relatively small amounts of fiber are a popular area of application for electrospun fiber reinforced materials. Electrospinning is being investigated as a source of cost-effective, easy to manufacture wound dressings, medical implants, and scaffolds for the production of artificial human tissues. These scaffolds fulfill a similar purpose as the extracellular matrix in natural tissue. Biodegradable polymers, such as polycaprolactone, are typically used for this purpose. These fibers may then be coated with collagen to promote cell attachment, although collagen has successfully been spun directly into membranes. { Optical image of epoxy resin impregnating an electrospun polyvinyl alcohol reinforcing fiber mat SEM image of the fracture surface of a polyvinyl alcohol long fiber ‚Äì epoxy matrix composite ‚Äì the section thickness is about 12 micrometers } Catalysts Electrospun fibers may have potential as a surface for enzymes to be immobilized on. These enzymes could be used to break down toxic chemicals in the environment, among other things.  Mass production  Thus far, at least eight countries in the world have companies which provide industrial-level and laboratory-scale electrospinning machines: three companies each in Italy and Czech Republic, two each in Iran, Japan, and Spain, and one each in the Netherlands, New Zealand and Turkey.

The band have described their music as \\"alien-black-hard/industrial\\", whilst Allmusic described them as playing \\"a truly original brand of futuristic black metal [with] jagged samples, electronic drums, and industrial overtones, mak[ing] Aborym's peculiar sound very hard to pin down or define\\". The name of the band derives from Haborym Sadek Aym, overseer of the twenty- six legions of Hell in a seventeenth-century grimoire.  History = Early years and Kali Yuga Bizarre (1993‚Äì1999)  Aborym were originally formed in 1991Biography 1991-2011, accessed on 13 June 2013. or 1992A B O R Y M [official], accessed on 13 June 2013. by bass player and vocalist Malfeitor Fabban, who also played bass for Funeral Oration and keyboards for M.E.M.O.R.Y. Lab. At the beginning the three piece line-up performed covers of bands like Sodom, Celtic Frost, Mayhem, Sepultura, Sarc√≥fago, Morbid, Rotting Christ and Darkthrone. Along with Alex Noia (guitars) and Mental Siege (drums), Fabban recorded the first Aborym demo, the five-track Worshipping Damned Souls, in 1993. The band split up shortly afterwards and were reformed by Fabban in Rome in 1997. With the new members Yorga SM and Sethlans, the second demo (Antichristian Nuclear Sabbath) was recorded that same year. The band struck a deal with the Italian Scarlet Records for two albums.Biography, accessed on 13 June 2013. Their first full-length album, Kali Yuga Bizarre, was released in March 1999. The album featured guest vocals from Attila Csihar, well known in the black metal scene for his work with Mayhem, Tormentor and Plasma Pool. During the recording session, the band added a second guitarist, Nysrok Infernalien Sathanas, of the band Satanikk Terrorists. Csihar joined the band full-time after the recording, replacing Yorga SM. The album was well-received, with the caveat that was to become their trademark: one has to be open-minded when listening to it. Metalion of Slayer Magazine commented about the album: \\"Well, most of the Black Metal releases today don't rise anyone's attention, still there is a never-ending quest to find interesting bands. And this time we have come up with a winner. Aborym from Italy. This is what Black Metal should be all about. Ugliness, rawness, destruction, scary...\\"  Fire Walk with Us (1999‚Äì2002)  In 2001, Aborym released their second album Fire Walk with Us, with Csihar fulfilling vocal duties and the band including a cover of Norwegian band Burzum's \\"Det som en gang var\\". The album was extremely well received. Terrorizer awarded it album of the month with a maximum score of 10/10, commenting: \\"Most black- heads will hate it, others will be curiously offended by it, and a fearless few will call it their own and use it as their very lifeblood. You can almost see the majority snicker at Aborym's psychedelic time-travel-meets-corpse- paint image, but these visuals serve to underline specifically where band and record belong: the outer reaches of the cosmos.\\"Birk, Nathan T. Terrorizer No. 95, page 60, December 2001. The album also made Terrorizers Albums of the Year for 2001, at position 39.Unknown. Terrorizer No. 96, page 69, January/February 2002. Eduardo Rivadavia of Allmusic highlighted the potentially divisive nature of the record, stating: \\"Is it any good? Well, it really comes down to how the listener positions himself along the digital divide. Those who prefer their Metal stripped down and straightforward will likely find Aborym too Industrial and chaotic. Yet for fans of truly unique new directions in Metal, Fire Walk With Us is a full-course meal.\\"Eduardo Rivadavia: Fire Walk With Us - Aborym, accessed on 13 June 2013. Again, Metalion, of Slayer Magazine, said:\\"Aborym brought a new level of unexpected disturbance to Black Metal.\\"  With No Human Intervention (2003‚Äì2005)  2003 saw Aborym release With No Human Intervention through Code666 in Europe and Mercenary Musik/WEA/Arista in the United States. The album continued to expand on the band's experimentation with Electronica, with Aborym citing influences from drum and bass, jungle, techno, classical, EBM and industrial. The album featured guest appearances from B√•rd Eithun, Roger Rasmussen Nattefrost, Matt Jarman (of Void), Mick Kenney and Richard Szabo (of Timewave Zero). The album, again, achieved Album of the Month in Terrorizer, with Stuart Banks remarking: \\"With No Human Intervention shows a band pulling out all the stops to push the extreme and avant-garde to new depths and, quite frankly, making it look easy. Aborym have made Black Metal more than just relevant, they have given the genre a visceral vividness. Their ability to master forces of primitive rawness, cosmic elementals, cold machinery and ritualistic pounding, blending them into decadent layers of speed, dark grooves of hate and reality warping sounds which comprise this album, dismembers sanity\\". Opinion, again, was mixed, however, with Dave Ling, of Metal Hammer UK commenting: \\"Aborym have somehow found a way of effectively mutating Black Metal's original strain with blasts of industrial noise and electronic effects.\\" Nathan Pearce also said: \\"Aborym has solidified their sound and reputation with the release of the OUTSTANDING 'With No Human Intervention'. With the success of the genre defining Fire Walk With Us, Aborym was being looked to as the answer to the somewhat stagnant Black Metal scene.\\" In a 2009 retrospective on black metal, Ciaran Tracey reflected: In 2004, Aborym played at the Inferno Metal Festival in Oslo, with Eithun guesting on drums for the track \\"Alienation of a Blackened Heart\\".  Generator (2006‚Äì2009)  In 2005 Csihar left Aborym to return to Mayhem and was replaced by Preben \\"Prime Evil\\" Mulvik of Mysticum and Amok. Faust joined the band on drums as a permanent member, and guitarist Set Teitan moved to Sweden to join Dissection. Aborym signed with a bigger label in the form of Season of Mist to release their fourth record, Generator. Chad Bowar of About.com praised the album's atmospheric elements and the vocals of Mulvik, noting also that Csihar returns to appear on one track (\\"Man Bites Dog\\"). Jeremy Garner of Metal Reviews commented: \\"I'll be fucked if any Black Metal band tops this effort for a while. Any fan of Black Metal regardless of subgenre preferences should take the opportunity to delve into this. Pure excellence\\". Nathan Pearce of Ultimatemetal.com comment that: \\"Aborym is now a band that should appeal to a wider audience without alienating their already solid fan base\\". In July 2007, Nysrok Infernalien Sathanas, Aborym's long-term guitarist, left the band, stating that his \\"approach to our way of working, living and thinking\\" was out of sync with the rest of the band. Mulvik also departed the band to concentrate on other priorities in his life.  Psychogrotesque (2010‚Äì2012)  In 2010, Aborym became a trio: Fabban, B√•rd G. Eithun and new guitarist Paolo \\"Hell:IO:Kabbalus\\" Pieri. Recording the fifth album commenced on 20 February, at Fear No One Studios, under the supervision of sound engineer Emiliano Natali. The band announced that the album would consist of a single track, which they described as \\"a harsh sonic monolith of sickness and depravity\\". The album featured sound consulting by Marc Urselli Shrarer at Eastside Sound Studios, New York. As usual, the album was announced to be featuring a number of guest appearances, in this case Narchost (of Fabban's other band, Malfeitor), Karyn Crisis (Crisis), Davide Tiso (Ephel Duath), Marcello Balena, and Richard Szabo (of Timewave Zero), amongst others yet to be revealed. In August 2010, Aborym announced that the title of the fifth album was to be Psychgrotesque and was to be released on 8 November in Europe (23 November in the USA). The band described the album as a \\"realistic story about the horrific human aridity and its fragile impotence. A social metaphor, uncomfortable but very current, treated cynically by bassist-singer Fabban through a story set in a mental hospital, which suggests that he used his pen with an absolute commitment and the determination to keep off ABORYM from the banality and clich√©s both ideological/aptitudinal and musical that saturate the extreme metal scene.\\" The band described the album as: \\"a realistic story about the horrific human aridity and its fragile impotence. A social metaphor, uncomfortable but very current, treated cynically by bassist/singer Fabban through a story set in a mental hospital, which suggests that he used his pen with an absolute commitment and the determination to keep off Aborym from the banality and both ideological/aptitudinal and musical clich√©s that saturate the Extreme Metal scene\\". Alex, from Archaic Magazine commented: \\"The very aptly named Psychogrotesque once again manages to make most Black Metal acts sound like Lady Gaga: the suffocating levels of abject perversion are scarily palpable, drenched in truly malignant horror and overt twistedness\\". Peter Loftus, from Norway's Eternal Terror, said: \\"There is so much to love here, and it speaks lots that such an intense and insane album can be crafted to have such a wide appeal. Definitely recommended\\". Pier Marzano of Italy's Grindzone wrote:\\"Citare se stessi √® un lusso che si concede ai soli maestri del genere; reinventarsi pur riferendosi palesemente al proprio passato, non ha prezzo. Imperdibili, anche questa volta\\".  Dirty (2012‚Äì2013)  In October 2012, Aborym entered Fear No One studios to record their sixth album, the follow-up to Psychogrotesque. The new album is planned to be released in 2013 through Agonia Records. The band are also working on a special song in order to celebrate the anniversary of the first 20 years of their career - an assembly of riffs, ideas, lyrics, loops and grooves sent by fans. Furthermore, a big fanwall poster is under construction with hundreds of photos from fans. After many years since their last live appearances, Aborym are to officially announce their collaboration with The Flaming Arts booking agency. They have signed an exclusive worldwide contract. Aborym have planned live shows with a digital drum-machine, as the band did in their previous shows, so the drummer, B√•rd G. Eithun \\"Faust\\", will not be part of the live line-up. Alongside vocalist Fabban and guitarist Paolo Pieri, Aborym will be on stage with the addition of a second guest guitarist and a guest bass player. Details of Dirty, their 6th full-length album, have been announced.

This crater lies across the eastern rim of the huge walled plain Leibnitz, and the rim and outer rampart intrudes into the interior floor of Leibnitz. To the east-northeast of Davisson is the walled plain Oppenheimer, a formation only somewhat smaller than Leibnitz. The rim of Davisson has been somewhat eroded from impacts, but it retains some detail from its original formation. Particularly along the western face, the interior wall displays some terraces. The rim is more worn along the northeastern face, and the rim is more irregular to the north and south. The interior floor is relatively level and featureless, with a low central peak offset slightly to the southwest of the crater midpoint. This crater is named after Clinton Joseph Davisson (1881‚Äì1958) a US physicist who in 1927 made the first experimental observation of the wave nature of electrons, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1937. With Lester Germer (1896‚Äì1971), Davisson discovered that electrons can undergo diffraction, in accordance with French physicist Louis de Broglie's theory that electrons and all other elementary particles can show wavelike behaviour.

Oil on canvas attributed to Meredith Janvier, c. 1910-1920 John Merryman (August 9, 1824 - November 15, 1881) of Baltimore County, Maryland, was arrested in May 1861 and held prisoner in Fort McHenry in Baltimore and was the petitioner in the case \\"Ex parte Merryman\\" which was one of the best known habeas corpus cases of the American Civil War (1861-1865). Merryman was arrested for his involvement in the mob in Baltimore, specifically for his leadership in the destruction of telegraph lines, but was not charged, a right normally ensured by the writ of habeas corpus. The case was taken up by the federal circuit court and its current presiding judge who happened to be Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, a Democrat-leaning Marylander. The reading of Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution was in question. Taney believed that the phrase ‚Äúwhen in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it‚Äù applied solely to Congress because of its location in Article 1. In Ex Parte Milligan, Chief Justice Taney writes, ‚ÄúIf the high power over the liberty of the citizens now claimed was intended to be conferred on the President, it would undoubtedly be found in plain words in this article (Article I of the Constitution) ‚Ä¶ He certainly does not faithfully execute the laws if he takes upon himself legislative power by suspending the writ of habeas corpus.‚Äù Lincoln asserted that his \\"war powers\\" gave him authority to act on this power to preserve the Union, especially since Congress could not be in session to suspend the writ. Lincoln largely ignored Taney's ruling, asking Congress when they reconvened for a special session on July 4, 1861, ‚ÄúAre all the laws, but one, to go unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that one be violated?‚Äù Had the destruction of public property been allowed to continue in Maryland, Lincoln would have had to fight an insurrection in the north as well as the seceding states' armies. Thus, he concludes that suspending the writ of habeas corpus was essential to preserving the government. The executive branch could not enforce laws if people were damaging its infrastructure. The case never reached the Supreme Court, partly because in 1861 Congress passed a law which \\"approved and in all respects legalized and made valid ... all the acts, proclamations, and orders of the President of the United States respecting the army and navy ... as if they had been done under the previous express authority and direction of the Congress.\\" Merryman was also a state militia officer during the Civil War, and a Maryland politician. Biography=Early life Merryman began his work life as an employee in Richard Norris' hardware store in Baltimore City. The following year he moved to Guayama, Puerto Rico to work for his uncle, Samuel N. Gott. Merryman returned to Maryland in 1842 to manage farms and raise Hereford cattle. Merryman married Ann Louisa, daughter of Elijah Bosley Gittings, in 1844. John and Ann Louisa had eleven children. Merryman, a Democrat, served as member and president of the Board of County Commissioners, Baltimore County, in 1857.Maryland State Archives At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, he was a farmer in Cockeysville, Maryland. Civil War Prior to the Civil War, Merryman was a 3rd lieutenant in the Baltimore County Troops. By 1861 he was a 1st lieutenant in the Baltimore County Horse Guards. Following the Pratt Street Riot in Baltimore, the Maryland legislature voted against secession. However, concerned about further unrest from pro-Southern elements, they voted to keep the railways closed so Union troops could not travel through Maryland on their way to defending Washington, D.C. and other federal enclaves. While carrying out this policy, Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks allegedly ordered Merryman to aid in the destruction of several bridges north of Baltimore. On May 25, 1861, Merryman was arrested at his home in Cockeysville by Union troops acting under orders of General William H. Keim. Merryman was then taken and confined in Fort McHenry. Merryman petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus, which was granted, in part, by Chief Justice Roger B. Taney. Taney's May 26, 1861 order directed General George Cadwalader, commander of Fort McHenry, (1) to produce (but not release) Merryman for a hearing before Taney to be held the very next day, on May 27, 1861, and (2) to explain on what legal basis the Army had seized Merryman. General George Cadwalader did not produce Merryman. Instead, Cadwalader delivered a response which was read to the court. Cadwalader's response explained that he was acting under orders from President Lincoln, who had delegated authority to the military to suspend habeas corpus. Because Cadwalader failed to produce Merryman, Taney cited Cadwalader for contempt, and ordered the U.S. Marshal to serve an attachment order on Cadwalader. The U.S. Marshal was unable to serve the attachment order, as he was denied entrance to Fort McHenry. Thus, the contempt citation was never adjudicated. Furthermore, Taney declared Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus unconstitutional (see Ex parte Merryman). While Merryman was in jail awaiting a hearing, Taney had furniture and home-cooked meals brought to him in his cell. Merryman later named one of his sons Roger B. Taney Merryman in the Chief Justice's honor.The Politics of Continuity. Merryman was State Treasurer of Maryland from 1870 to 1872.

Early life Born in 1948 in Bridgemary Hants, Gent was raised in Gosport, Hampshire. He attended Tenison's School, then a grammar school in Kennington. His father, who had served in the Royal Navy, died when he was at school. He is one of four brothers (Rod, Chris, Jeremy and Pete). Career He first worked for the National Westminster Bank in 1971 as a management trainee, then as a computer services manager at Schroders. In 1979 he became the managing director of Baric, a company owned by ICL and Barclays. In 1985 Gent joined Racal Electronics' Vodafone subsidiary as managing director of British operations as Vodafone prepared to launch its retail mobile phone operations. Vodafone Gent was widely credited with transforming Vodafone from a small subsidiary of Racal, a British electronics company, into a global giant, and with engineering Vodafone's 178 billion pound ($212 billion) purchase of Germany's Mannesmann in 2000. He became its managing director in January 1985 and its chief executive officer (taking over from Sir Gerald Whent) in January 1997. In 2001, Gent was an advocate of the United Kingdom joining the euro. After retiring from Vodafone in July 2003, Gent was awarded the honorary title of Company's President for Life on his departure as a mark of his achievement in developing the company, until his resignation from that position in March 2006. The title carried no salary, nor any advisory responsibilities, but was a symbolic link to the business. He was formerly Chairman of GlaxoSmithKline, a British multinational pharmaceutical company, joining in June 2004, becoming chairman on 1 January 2005, a position he held until May 2015. From October 2005 to October 2006 he served on the Tax Reform Commission, established by the then Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne MP.

The cost for them is going to be astronomically high.\\" Gent is an avid sports fan and enjoys golf, skiing and tennis. However, his real passion is cricket, having grown up next door to The Oval and he is well-known to travel long distances to attend matches. He famously instigated the deal with Airtouch whilst on his mobile phone at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Vodafone sponsored the England cricket team for many years until 2007.

February 13, 1925), better known as Floyd Collins, was an American cave explorer, principally in a region of Central Kentucky that houses hundreds of miles of interconnected caverns within Mammoth Cave National Park, the longest cave system in the world. In the early 20th century, in an era known as the Kentucky Cave Wars,Cave Wars - Mammoth Cave National Park (U.S. National Park Service) commercial cave owners and explorers in Kentucky entered into a bitter competition to exploit the bounty of caves for commercial profit from tourists, who paid to see the caves. In 1917, Collins had discovered and commercialized Crystal Cave on Flint Ridge (now part of the Mammoth Cave System but at the time an isolated cave). But the cave was remote and visitors were few. Collins had an ambition to find another cave he could open to the public closer to the main roads, and entered into an agreement with a neighbor to open up Sand Cave, a small cave on the neighbor's property. On January 30, 1925, while working to enlarge the small passage in Sand Cave, Collins became trapped in a narrow crawlway below ground. The rescue operation to save Collins became a national newspaper sensation and one of the first major news stories to be reported using the new technology of broadcast radio. The rescue attempt grew to become the third- biggest media event between the world wars. After four days, during which time rescuers were able to bring water and food to Collins, a rock collapse in the cave closed the entrance passageway, stranding him in the cave, except for voice contact, for more than two weeks. Collins died of thirst and hunger compounded by exposure through hypothermia after being isolated for 14 days, just three days before a rescue shaft reached his position. Collins' body would be recovered two months later. Although Collins was an unknown figure in his lifetime, the fame he gained from his death led to him being memorialized on his tombstone as the \\"Greatest Cave Explorer Ever Known\\". Early life William Floyd Collins was born in Auburn, Logan County, Kentucky, the son and third child of Leonidas Collins and Martha Jane Burnett. Collins had five brothers, James, Floyd (a brother with same name), Andy Lee, Marshall Everett and Homer Larkin, as well as two sisters, Anna and Nellie. Crystal Cave Sand Cave, in the \\"Cave Country\\", of Central Kentucky In the period of Kentucky history known as the \\"Cave Wars,\\" the Floyd Collins family owned their own cave called Crystal Cave, a tourist show cave in the karst region of Mammoth Cave. Crystal Cave attracted a low number of tourists due to its remote location. Collins hoped to find another entrance to the Mammoth Cave or possibly an unknown cave along the road to Mammoth Cave and draw more visitors and greater profits. He made an agreement with three farmers, who owned land closer to the main highway. If he found a cave, they would form a business partnership and share in the responsibilities of operating this tourist attraction. Working alone, within three weeks, he had explored and expanded a hole that would later be called \\"Sand Cave\\" by the news media. 1925 cave accident On January 30, 1925, after several hours of work, Floyd Collins managed to squeeze through several narrow passageways; he claimed he had discovered a large, grotto chamber, though this was never verified. Because his lamp was dying, he had to leave quickly before losing all light to the chamber, but became trapped in a small passage on his way out. Collins accidentally knocked over his lamp, putting out the light, and was caught by a rock from the cave ceiling, pinning his left leg. The falling rock weighed 26 pounds; rescuers were unable to reach the rock to remove it. Floyd Collins was trapped 150 feet (50 m) from the entrance. After being found the next day by a friend, crackers were sent to him and an electric light was run down the passage to provide him lighting and some warmth. Collins survived for more than a week while rescue efforts were organized. On February 4, the cave passage collapsed in two places. Rescue leaders, led by Henry St. George Tucker Carmichael, determined the cave impassable and too dangerous and began to dig a shaft to reach the chamber behind Collins. The 55-foot (18 m) shaft and subsequent lateral tunnel intersected the cave just above Collins, but when he was finally reached on February 17, he was already dead from exposure. Because he could not be reached from behind, the rescuers could not free his leg. They left his body in place and filled the shaft with debris. A doctor estimated he had died three or four days before he was reached, with February 13 the most likely date. Media attention Newspaper reporter William Burke \\"Skeets\\" Miller from The Courier-Journal in Louisville reported on the rescue efforts from the scene. Miller, of small stature, was able to remove a lot of earth from around Collins. He also interviewed Collins in the cave, receiving a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage and playing a part in Collins' attempted rescue. Miller's reports were distributed by telegraph and were printed by newspapers across the country and abroad, and the rescue attempts were followed by regular news bulletins on the new medium of broadcast radio (the first broadcast radio station KDKA having been established in 1920). Shortly after the media arrived, the publicity drew crowds of tourists to the site, at one point numbering in the tens of thousands. Vendors set up stalls to sell food and souvenirs, creating a circus-like atmosphere. The Sand Cave rescue attempt grew to become the third-biggest media event between the world wars. (The biggest media events of that time both involved Charles Lindbergh ‚Äî the trans-Atlantic flight and his son's kidnapping ‚Äî and Lindbergh actually had a minor role in the Sand Cave rescue, too, having been hired to fly photographic negatives from the scene for a newspaper.) Since the nearest telegraph station was in Cave City, some miles from the cave, two amateur radio operators with the callsigns 9BRK and 9CHG provided the link to pass messages to the authorities and the press.DeSotto, Clinton: 200 Meters & Down - The Story of Amateur Radio, 1936 - American Radio relay League p.162 Burial and exhibition of body Floyd Collins' grave, with epitaph With Collins's body remaining in the cave, funeral services were held on the surface. Homer Collins was not pleased with Sand Cave as his brother's grave, and two months later, he and some friends reopened the shaft. They dug a new tunnel to the opposite side of the cave passage and recovered Floyd Collins's remains on April 23, 1925. The following day, the body was buried in the burial ground of the Collins family's farm, near Crystal Cave, now known as \\"Floyd Collins Crystal Cave.\\" In 1927, Floyd Collins' father, Lee Collins, sold the homestead and cave. The new owner placed Collins' body in a glass- topped coffin and exhibited it in Crystal Cave for many years. On the night of March 18‚Äì19, 1929, the body was stolen. The body was later recovered, having been found in a nearby field, but the injured left leg was missing. After this desecration, the remains were kept in a secluded portion of Crystal Cave in a chained casket. In 1961, Crystal Cave was purchased by Mammoth Cave National Park and closed to the public. The Collins family had objected to Collins' body being displayed in the cave and, at their request, the National Park Service re-interred him at Mammoth Cave Baptist Church Cemetery, Mammoth Cave, Kentucky in 1989. It took a team of 15 men three days to remove the casket and tombstone from the cave. Later exploration The attention over the rescue attempt of Collins created interest in the creation of Mammoth Cave National Park, of which Sand Cave is now a part. Fear and superstition kept cavers away from Sand Cave for decades. The National Park Service has sealed the entrance with a steel grate for public safety. Expeditions into Mammoth Cave showed that portions of Mammoth actually run under Sand Cave, but no connection has ever been discovered. In the 1970s, cave explorer and author Roger Brucker and a small group entered Sand Cave to conduct research for a book about Collins. The team surveyed Sand and discovered an opening in the collapsed tunnel through which a smaller caver can crawl, showing that it would have been possible to feed and heat Collins after February 4, 1925. They proceeded as far as the passage where Collins was trapped; it was choked with gravel and unsafe to excavate. In April 1983, George Crothers led an archaeological investigation that documented many 1925 artifacts in the cave. These were removed for future preservation. In popular culture The life and death of Collins inspired the musical Floyd Collins by Adam Guettel and Tina Landau, as well as one film documentary, several books, a museum and many short songs. Ace in the Hole (alternative title, The Big Carnival) is a 1951 film by Billy Wilder based on the media circus surrounding the attempted rescue of a man stuck in a cave. The film depicts a fictional incident, but Collins is mentioned by name in the dialogue. He is mentioned in two novels by Kentucky writers Robert Penn Warren and James Still: The Cave and River of Earth. In 2006, actor Billy Bob Thornton optioned the film rights to Trapped! The Story of Floyd Collins and a screenplay was adapted by Thornton's writing partner, Tom Epperson. However, Thornton's option expired and the film rights were acquired by producer Peter R. J. Deyell in 2011. Fiddlin' John Carson and Vernon Dalhart recorded \\"The Death of Floyd Collins\\" in 1925. Kentucky-based rock band Black Stone Cherry has a song titled \\"The Ghost of Floyd Collins\\" on their 2008 album, Folklore and Superstition. John Prine and Mac Wiseman released a song titled \\"Death of Floyd Collins,\\" written by Andrew Jenkins, on their 2007 album Standard Songs For Average People. Floyd Collins is mentioned in Mark Z. Danielewski's postmodern novel House of Leaves (p 334 of the Pantheon Books 2nd edition). The story of Floyd Collins is also included in the novel Supernatural: The Usual Sacrifices by Yvonne Navarro. The poet Clark Coolidge's 1978 book Own Face (United Artists) features a photo of Floyd Collins on the cover and a number of poems in the book make reference to Collins, caving, and related matters. Sun & Moon Press published an edition of Own Face in 1993. The story of Floyd Collins' death is mentioned on the television show The Blacklist.

Theology and cosmology=Sedi and Keyum In the Donyi-Polo belief, the fountain god that begets the universe (God or the Godhead) is referred to as Sedi by the Minyong and Padam, Jimi by the Galo.Rikam, 2005. p. 117Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48 All things and beings are parts of the body of Sedi:Rikam, 2005. p. 119Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48 in creation, the hair of Sedi becomes the plants of the earth, his tears become rain and water, his bones become rocks and stones, and his two eyes become Donyi (the Sun) and Polo (the Moon).Rikam, 2005. p. 119Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48 Sedi, after creation, is a deus otiosus but continues to observe creation through his eyes, his double aspect veiling-unveiling-revealing himself.Rikam, 2005. p. 119Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48 In Galo beliefs, Jimi manifests as Melo (Sky) and Sidi (Earth), out of the interaction of which all things and beings are born, including Donyi and Polo.Rikam, 2005. p. 119 There are other myths explaining the meaning of the duality Donyi and Polo.Rikam, 2005. p. 119Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. pp. 47-48 According to Talom Rukbo's theology, all celestial bodies including Earth, all things, originate from one source, Keyum (nothingness or the vacuum).Rikam, 2005. p. 120 Donyi-Polo is the polar force that generates all stars; the physical Sun and Moon (respectively, Bomong and Boo) near the Earth and humanity, are bodily manifestations of the universal unseen power Donyi-Polo, with Bomong carrying out the centralising power of Donyi, and Boo the Polo power of life-giving.Rikam, 2005. p. 120 Donyi and Polo Donyi (Sun) and Polo (Moon)‚Äîwhich are, respectively, female and male in the Tibeto-Burman tradition; called Ane Donyi (\\"Mother Sun\\") and Abo Polo (\\"Father Moon\\")Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 48‚Äîconstitute a notion similar to the yin and yang of Chinese culture.

providing harmony and balance to the universe, for example in the alternation of light and darkness, heat and cool, or unity (analogically, the Sun of the daily sky) and multiplicity (analogically, the stars of the night sky).Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264 The practical expression of the faith in Donyi- Polo can be found in the daily life and actions of people: they call themselves \\"Donyi O, Polo Ome\\", meaning \\"children of the sun and the moon\\".Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50 When a believer is distressed he invokes \\"Donyi-Polo\\".Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50 If a man is falsely accused of lying he invokes \\"Donyi-e!\\", \\"oh Sun!\\".Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50 All these are expressions of faith in Donyi-Polo upholding providently the world, rewarding the righteous and punishing wrong-doers.Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50 The divine pair is revered as the highest holy figure governing fate.Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 50 \\"Donyi-Polo\\" is also used in the sense of \\"truth\\" in sacral speech.Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51 \\"Donyi-Polo\\" is an epitome for wisdom, enlightenment, right conscience, truthfulness, and selflessness.Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51 Aware people are called \\"Donyi- Polo Ome\\", which means \\"children of truth\\".Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51 Elders are regarded as \\"Donyi-Polo Abu\\", \\"representatives of the truth\\".Mibang, Chaudhuri, 2004. p. 51 Gods The followers of Donyi- Poloism worship a variety of gods and goddesses that enliven nature.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 These gods are believed to partake in the universal balance of Donyi and Polo, and to be multiple manifestations or identities of Sedi‚ÄîDonyi- Polo, each with specific functions and roles.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270 It is believed that they take care of the earth and humanity.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 The main deities in Donyi-Polo are Donyi and Polo, Kine Nane, Doying Bote, Pedong Nane and Guumin Soyin.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270 ABOTANI Tani-speaking peoples (Lhoba, Tagin, Galo, Nishi, Na, Apatani, Mishing, Adi) share a myth telling of their descendance from the progenitor Abotani.Rikam, 2005. p. 118 Other Tibeto-Burman peoples of Arunachal Pradesh who share the Donyi-Polo faith don't subscribe to the descendance from Abotani.Rikam, 2005. p. 118 Abotani is thought to represent the evolution of the human being from the source Donyi, Sedi,Rikam, 2005. p. 126 the eye of the universe as important to man as the eye of the body.Rikam, 2005. p. 126 The Divinity has projected man showing him the right way to go.Rikam, 2005. p. 126 Conscience and ethics Donyi-Poloists describe the \\"Donyi-Polo\\" nature of the universe as the eyes of human conscience.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 Happiness is given through right action, and right action is that which follows the order of nature (Donyi-Polo).Rikam, 2005. p. 127 Oshang Ering, a philosopher of the religion, has written that as the two objects in the sky (Bomong and Boo) focus light to enable us to see what is what, Donyi-Polo makes us aware of what is wrong and right.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 Right conscience naturally prevails.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 When a person does wrong things (acts against the natural order) and tries to hide it, or masks it as good, then the force of conscience (Donyi-Polo) imposes a psychological pression, and the wrong doer loses happiness.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 Right conscience naturally guides man.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 According to the traditional belief, love, compassion, equality and selflessness are naturally ordained by Donyi-Polo; they are inscribed in nature.Rikam, 2005. p. 127 The ethical dimension of Donyi-Polo also means purity, beauty, simplicity, and frankness.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264 Institution On 28 August 1968, a meeting of Adi intellectuals was held in Along, West Siang, to discuss countermeasures to be taken against the gradual erosion of indigenous identity and traditions attributed to India's policy of integration of Arunachal Pradesh, and particularly the spread of Christianity in the area since the 1950s which has caused an enduring crisis in the cultural mosaic of the north-eastern state.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 261 The meeting's aim was also that of uniting the Tibeto-Burman folks under a collective identity and values for a good life.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 263Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270 Talom Rukbo emerged as the father of Donyi-Poloism, a term that was coined for the institutionalisation of the Tibeto-Burman folk religion.Chaudhuri, 2013. pp. 263-264 According to Rukbo, the main reason of the easy erosion of the traditional culture was that it lacked a written literature.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 263 So, with the aim of recovering the endangered rituals, prayers and hymns, within 1986 three major cultural organisations were founded: the Tani Jagriti Foundation, the Donyi- Polo Youth Federation and the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264 Rukbo expressed the need for institutionalisation of the traditional faith in these terms:Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264 :¬´Tradition means the way of living of a society practicing its socio-religious culture, economic life, the way of preserving history, literature and all other norms of social life inherited from time immemorial which may be called social character and identity¬ª. Many Adi and Tani intellectuals reflected Rukbo's ideas, and these gradually spread across the tribes and even beyond the Tani people.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 264 The 31 December, the day of establishment of the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang in 1986, has been made the \\"Donyi-Polo Day\\" celebrated each year.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 Since then, templar areas () have been consecrated, religious literature and prayer hymns have been collected and published.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267 To meet the growing number of adherents in the revival, the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang established orientation courses‚Äîwhich take place twice a year‚Äîand trained groups of youth to send back with books and icons to their home village, to encourage people to construct temples and conduct prayers.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 268 During the last two decades the spiritual revival has spread all over Arunachal Pradesh.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 269 Supporters of the revival have coined the slogan ¬´Loss of culture is loss of identity¬ª which has become very popular. The indirect implication is that those who convert to Christianity lose their culture and hence their identity.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 274 Gangging A is a general name for a prayer place of the Donyi-Poloist faith, and especially in the Adi areas.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 The as a sacred enclosure is a concept popularised by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang since 1996.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 According to Talom Rukbo, the word is derived from Gangging Siring, the concept of a land or holy tree that mediates between the spiritual and the natural worlds,Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 and from which any thing, living or non-living, comes into existence.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 265 Gangging congregants have to follow certain rules: for example, male members must sit on the left in rows, and female members on the right, cross-legged.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267 Within the prayer place, there should not be any noise during prayer except the sound of the hymns.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267 Prayers are organized in the prayer place on Sundays, and all of the branches established in each of the villages under the Siang district are centrally regulated by the Donyi-Polo Yelam Kebang.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267 Through the prayer place, codified rituals and practices, and iconographies of the Gods and Goddesses have been introduced.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 267 Ethnic variations In Galo areas, the prayer place and community halls (dere) have come up under the patronage of the Donyi-Polo Welfare Association and they are being built since the 2000s.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270 Priests (nyibu) conduct prayers in the prayer place on Sundays.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 270 In Apatani areas, the religion is called \\"Danyi-Piilo\\" and prayer place are called meder nello (\\"purified place\\"), the first of which was built in 2004Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271 Songs and prayers are collected in a prayer book called Lyambope.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271 Donyi-Poloist prayer place in Nishi areas are called (\\"pure place\\"), and also among them the movement has been started only in the early 2000s.Chaudhuri, 2013. p. 271 More recently, the success of Donyi-Polo has crossed the Tani cultural borders inspiring the rise of Rangfraism among the Tangsa, and of Intayaism among the Mishmi, respectively in Changlang and Dibang Valley.Chaudhuri, 2013. pp. 274-275 See also * Tribal religions in India * Bathouism * Sanamahism * Sarnaism NotesReferencesSources * Sarit Kumar Chaudhuri.

The school is located in Creve Coeur, in west St. Louis County, Missouri. The school offers 7-day, 5-day, and temporary boarding. Students come from throughout the United States and from countries throughout the world. Canning Hall, the name of the dormitory, accommodates up to sixty-five residents. The school bears the name of Father William Joseph Chaminade, a priest who lived during the era of the French Revolution and who founded the religious order known as the Society of Mary (Marianists). The school maintains an active relationship with the Society of Mary through governance structures and the employment of lay and religious Marianists and maintaining this charism. History Chaminade was founded by the Society of Mary in 1910, less than one hundred years after the school's namesake, Blessed Father William Joseph Chaminade, had founded the order, and only sixty years after the Marianists had established themselves in the United States. Originally it was a boarding and day school, with most of its students residing in the open dormitories that were located on the third and fourth floors of the main building; the priests and brothers of the Society of Mary resided in rooms on the north and south ends of each floor. When the school opened in 1910, only one building, which later would be named \\"Chaminade Hall,\\" existed on campus, besides the original farmhouse that existed when the land was purchased. In 1919, however, the school built a gymnasium north of the school building. The main building, the farmhouse, and the gymnasium were for many years the only permanent structures on the campus until the 1950s, when the school built new dormitories for students, a new residence building for the members of the Marianist order, and a new chapel. These buildings were connected to the main building and the gymnasium by a network of tunnels that allowed the priests and brothers to move between buildings without going outside. In 1970, the school constructed a new athletic facility named the Athletictron, and the school added the \\"West Wing\\" onto the back of Chaminade Hall in 1981. In 2002, the West Wing was expanded again, adding middle school classrooms, a cafeteria, and a new library. In 2011, construction was completed on the new Skip Viragh Center for the Arts. Rev. Ralph A. Siefert has been President of Chaminade since 1987. He is the longest serving President in the school's history. The 1000 seat auditorium in the Skip Viragh Center for the Arts was named in his honor. Facilities Chaminade Hall is the main administrative and classroom building. It houses offices for the president, principal, and assistant principals, as well as the admissions office, the advancement office, and the business office. Most high school classrooms are in Chaminade Hall as well, spread over four floors and the basement. The original gymnasium is Juergens Hall. It houses the middle school gym, football offices, trainor's room, one of Chaminade's exercise rooms, and middle school locker rooms. Canning Hall is the student dormitory and can house up to 65 students. Residence hall prefects also live in Canning Hall. Frische Hall is a former residence for religious members of the Society of Mary. Chaminade converted the building for use as faculty offices, the campus ministry center, faculty lounge, the activity club rooms, and Chaminade's student center. There is also a courtyard (originally a cloister garden) where the Bar-B-Que team's smoker sits. The Immaculate Conception Chapel is the religious center of the campus. While the chapel is too small for the entire school to have mass together in it, it is still used for smaller masses and reconciliation services. The sacristy is inside Frische Hall. The Athletictron is the athletic center for the school. It houses a basketball/volleyball court, a commons area, a concessions stand, locker rooms for men, women and faculty, and a swimming pool. The pool is not only used by Chaminade students but by other swim and dive teams in the area, such as St. Joseph's Academy and De Smet Jesuit. Other athletic facilities on campus include eight tennis courts, a football stadium and track, a baseball diamond, a soccer stadium, and two multi-purpose practice fields, one of which has an all-weather turf field. The West Wing or New Wing has a cafeteria, an Atrium, a library and media center, 16 middle school classrooms, and weight lifting facilities. The Skip Viragh Center for the Arts, a performing and fine arts facility, opened in August 2011. This building houses a 1000-seat auditorium, four art classrooms, three music rehearsal rooms, several individual practice rooms, a smaller black box theatre, and an art gallery. This building was endowed by the family of Skip Viragh, a Chaminade alumnus who graduated in 1959. Academics Chaminade offers a demanding academic program for students with superior, above average, or strong average ability. In recent years, Chaminade has expanded its college credit offerings to include, besides 23 Advanced Placement courses, 59 semester-long courses through Saint Louis University and the University of Missouri‚ÄìSt. Louis. Fine Arts/Activities Canning Hall (left), Immaculate Conception Chapel (center), and Frische Hall (right). Over 150 students participate in the school band which has won numerous regional and national awards, including First Place in the 2010, 2011, and 2012 Midwest Festival of Music. In 2009, the Drama Club was selected to participate in the International Fringe Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland. Only a select number of schools throughout the United States are chosen for this honor. Chaminade offers over 25 clubs for its middle school and high school students. One of the most popular clubs is the online webstream program called CSPN (the Chaminade version of ESPN) in which sporting events and other activities are livestreamed on the web. Students participate as commentators, analysts, cameramen, and the tech crew. Community Service Chaminade requires all students to participate in community service projects annually. Middle school students (grades 6‚Äì8) complete 10‚Äì20 hours annually while high school students complete 25‚Äì50 hours each year. Students help numerous groups throughout the St. Louis area. Recent Spring Break community service trips have been to \\"Coal Country\\" (West Virginia), as well as Mexico, Africa, and Haiti. It also boasts a Global Citizens Club, and membership in the St. Louis Mosaic Ambassador School program. The House System Chaminade began The House System in 2003. Chaminade has five houses, and each student belongs to one of the five Houses: Gray, Lamourous, Mauclerc, Meyer and O'Donnell. * Gray House is named after C. Vincent Gray, the first African American Marianist in the St. Louis Province of the Society of Mary. * Lamourous House is named after Marie Therese de Lamourous. She and her family were close friends of Blessed Chaminade and provided shelter for him during his persecution at the time of the French Revolution. Marie Therese and her family were closely involved in the Blessed Chaminade's early Sodalities and his work to re-Christianize France after the revolution. * Mauclerc House is named after Reverend Francis Xavier Mauclerc, S.M., who was the first Marianist to be ordained in the United States. Originally from France, Rev. Mauclerc joined the Marianists as a seminarian in 1850, and was ordained in 1852. * Meyer House is named after Father Leo Meyer, S.M., who was the first Marianist in the United States. Father Meyer arrived from Switzerland in 1849, settling in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati where he founded St. Mary's Institute, which later became the University of Dayton. * O'Donnell House is named after Brother John O'Donnell, S.M., a working brother for the Society of Mary. He died in 1973 at the age of 90. Athletics Chaminade offers over 60 teams in 18 different sports. Sports offered include baseball, basketball, bocce, bowling, cross country, football, golf, hockey, lacrosse, racquetball, rugby, soccer, swimming/diving, tennis, track/field, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, water polo, and wrestling. Chaminade is part of the Metro Catholic Conference with Christian Brothers College High School, De Smet Jesuit High School, St. John Vianney High School (Kirkwood, Missouri), and St. Louis University High School.

Early life and education Tydings was born in Havre de Grace, located in Harford County, and was the son of Mary Bond (O'Neill) and Millard Fillmore Tydings.http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-04-08/news/0704070290_1_tydings- havre-de-grace-harford-county He attended the public schools of Harford County and graduated from Maryland Agricultural College (now the University of Maryland, College Park) in 1910. He engaged in civil engineering with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in West Virginia in 1911. He studied law at the University of Maryland School of Law, in Baltimore, and was admitted to the bar; he started practice in Havre de Grace in 1913. In 1916 Tydings was elected to the Maryland House of Delegates; he was elected as Speaker of the House by his colleagues from 1920 to 1922. He served in the Maryland State Senate during 1922-1923. Tydings served in the U.S. Army during World War I and was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and Division Machine-gun Officer in 1918. He served on the Western Front with the American Expeditionary Forces and received the Distinguished Service Cross and Army Distinguished Service Medal. House and Senate career In 1922, Tydings was elected as a Democrat to the 68th session of the US Congress, and was re-elected to the 69th session, representing the second district of Maryland (March 4, 1923 ‚Äì March 3, 1927) in the House of Representatives. He was not a candidate for renomination in 1926, having become a candidate for the United States Senate. He was elected to the Senate in 1926, 1932, 1938 and 1944, and served from March 4, 1927, to January 3, 1951. With Alabama Representative John McDuffie, he co-sponsored the Philippine Independence Act, commonly known as the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, which established an autonomous 10-year Commonwealth status for the Philippines. It was planned to culminate in the withdrawal of American sovereignty and the recognition of Philippine Independence. In January 1934, Tydings introduced a resolution \\"condemning Nazi oppression of Jews in Germany, and asking President Roosevelt to inform the Hitler government that this country was profoundly distressed about its antisemitic measures.\\" His resolution was bottled up in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\\"Legitimating Nazism: Harvard University and the Hitler Regime, 1933‚Äì1937\\", American Jewish History 92.2 (2004) 189-223 In 1936, Senator Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico, but it was opposed by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, an influential leader of the Liberal Party. All the Puerto Rican parties supported the bill. Tydings did not gain passage of the bill.Frank Otto Gatell, \\"Independence Rejected: Puerto Rico and the Tydings Bill of 1936\\", Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 38, No. 1 (Feb., 1958), pp. 25-44, accessed 15 December 2012 (The US senator had co-sponsored the Tydings‚ÄìMcDuffie Act, which provided independence to the Philippines after a 10-year transition under a limited autonomy.) During his time in the Senate, Tydings was well known for taking principled, controversial, often unusual stands on various issues. He opposed the New Deal due to his fiscal conservatism, and proposed a constitutional amendment requiring the federal budget to be balanced at all times. He was a strong critic of Prohibition prior to its repeal in 1933. Following the end of World War II, when the US dropped two atomic bombs on Japan, Tydings sponsored a bill calling for the U.S. to lead the world in nuclear disarmament. In March 1950, Tydings was appointed to head a committee, generally known as the Tydings Committee, to investigate Joseph McCarthy's early claims of Communist penetration of the federal government and military.Keith 2 The hearings revolved around McCarthy's charge that the fall of the Kuomintang regime in China had been caused by the actions of alleged Soviet spies in the State Department, and his allegation that the Sinologist Owen Lattimore was a \\"top Russian agent.\\" The hearings, held from March to July 1950, were stormy as charge was met with counter-charge. In McCarthy's first 250 minutes on the stand, Tydings interrupted him 85 times with questions and demands for substantiation,Evans 208 enraging McCarthy who condemned Tydings as an \\"egg- sucking liberal\\" Stone 1395. As such, the trial attracted much media attention, especially after Louis F. Budenz entered the proceedings as a surprise witness supporting McCarthy's charges. In July, the committee published its report, concluding that McCarthy's accusations were spurious and condemning his charges as an intentionally nefarious hoax. When Tydings ran for re-election in 1950, McCarthy's staff distributed a composite picture of Tydings with Earl Browder, the former leader of the American Communist Party. Tydings had never met him before Browder testified in July 1950. The composite photo merged a 1938 photo of Tydings listening to the radio and a 1940 photo of Browder delivering a speech; the text under the composite photo stated that when Browder had testified before Tydings's committee, Tydings had said, \\"Thank you, sir.\\" Although the quote was technically accurate, it was generally held to be misleading, as it implied a degree of amity between Browder and Tydings that did not exist. In the 1950 election, Tydings was defeated by John Marshall Butler. In 1956, he was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate but withdrew before election due to ill health. During his congressional service, Tydings was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Territories and Insular Affairs (73rd through 79th Congresses), the Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees (\\"Tydings Subcommittee\\") (81st Congress), and the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services (81st Congress). Death and legacy Millard E. Tydings died at his farm, \\"Oakington\\", near Havre de Grace, Maryland. He was buried in Angel Hill Cemetery. His gravestone incorrectly gives his Senate election year (1926) as the start of his Senate service, which began in 1927. *The Millard E. Tydings Memorial Bridge, which carries Interstate 95 across the Susquehanna River, is named in his honor. *Millard E. Tydings Hall at the University of Maryland, College Park, which houses the departments of Government & Politics and Economics, is also named for him. His adopted son, Joe Tydings, was elected to a term as a U.S. Senator from Maryland in 1964, but was defeated for re-election in 1970, serving from 1965 to 1971. His wife was Eleanor Tydings Ditzen. Her father was Joseph E. Davies, who served as US Ambassador to the USSR, Belgium and Luxembourg.\\"From Roosevelt to Truman: Potsdam, Hiroshima, and the Cold War,\\" by Wilson D.

The Indians suffered a severe loss and withdrew on Sept. 12. A vast force under Gen. William Henry Harrison arrived later that day to relieve the fort, ending the siege. The victory was one of two (the other being the battle of Fort Harrison which ended on the same day) which secured Indiana Territory for the United States in the war. Background Since 1811, after the severe defeat at the Battle of Tippecanoe, Native American tribes on the Northwest frontier had been growing bitter at the U.S. presence there. Encouraged by other British/Native American victories at places such as Fort Dearborn and Detroit, native tribes began to undertake campaigns against other smaller U.S. outposts. Fort Wayne, in northeast Indiana Territory, had fallen into disrepair in the years leading up to 1812.Allison, 200 As a frontier outpost stationed in a busy Native American town, the garrison was often insubordinate, and Captain James Rhea had allowed many of the buildings to deteriorate. The walls, once strong enough to withstand cannonballs, had not been maintained. Although there was a good well inside the fort, the food stores had gotten low by September. The garrison first learned of the fall of Fort Dearborn on 26 August, when Corporal Jordan returned after escaping the massacre.Poinsatte, 61‚Äì63 On 28 August, Stephen Johnston, the assistant trade factor at Fort Wayne, was killed a mile away from Fort Wayne.Allison, 201 The news was met with alarm, and John Johnston sent Shawnee Captain Logan to help evacuate women and children to the relative safety of Ohio.Poinsatte, 63 In September 1812, Indians from the Potawatomi and Miami tribes, led by Chief Winamac, gathered around Fort Wayne. Captain James Rhea sent letters to John Johnston and Ohio Governor Return Meigs to ask for assistance. The growing Indian threat outside the fort led Rhea to begin drinking heavily. On several occasions Rhea invited Indian delegates into the fort to discuss terms of peace with the Indians.Edmunds, 189-90 On 4 September, Potawatomi chiefs Winamac and Wannangsea approached the fort under a flag of truce and asked to speak to Captain Rhea. Rhea, who had been drinking, met them at the gate and asked if they were meeting for peace or war. Winamac replied \\"I don't know what to tell you, but you know that Fort Mackinac is taken, Detroit is in the hands of the British, Fort Dearborn has been taken, and you must expect to fall next, probably in a few days.\\"Allison, 202 Siege right  British expedition  After the British had successfully captured the city of Detroit, they had received the news that the Indians had surrounded an American Fort. Around 200 men under the command of Adam Muir marched towards the Fort from Detroit, eventually encamping near Fort Defiance. In the night, six Indians and an interpreter entered the camp and stated that they had found an American camp that evening and had taken the five soldiers there prisoner. Whilst marching them off, the interpreter overheard the officer say to his men \\"Kill four of the Indians, and make your escape\\". The Indians proceeded to kill all of the soldiers and presented five scalps, the officers ears and a silver dagger to he British as proof. The next morning, the Indians brought an American prisoner to camp. The prisoner stated that he was a quartermaster- sergeant of an American regiment, and was out hunting for honey. He also stated that they had around nine thousand soldiers in their camp. Upon hearing of the much superior American numbers, Captain Muir ordered a retreat and sailed back to Fort Malden.  Siege  Morning 5 September, the siege began when Chief Winamac's forces attacked two soldiers returning from an outhouse.The soldiers made it back inside the fort, but were badly wounded and died by early afternoon. Allison, 202 The Native Americans assaulted the fort from the east side and burned the homes of the surrounding village. The Indians constructed two wooden cannons and were able to trick the garrison into thinking they had artillery besieging the fort as well. Captain Rhea was again drunk, and \\"took to his quarters, sick.\\" The Indian Agent at Fort Wayne, Benjamin Stickney, was recovering from an illness, but took command of the fort with Lieutenants Daniel Curtis and Phillip Ostrander organizing the defense.Allison, 203 Chief Winamac came to the gate again, that evening, and was admitted- unarmed- with thirteen of his men. As they talked, Winamac revealed a knife that he had hidden, and a fur trader, Antoine Bondie, jumped forward to save the life of Stickney. Winamac left the fort, and the Native American forces opened fire at about eight o'clock PM.Allison, 204 Winamac's forces tried to set the fort on fire, and while the garrison- about 70 soldiers and some civilians-Allison, 205 tried to keep the walls wet, they returned fire with muskets and howitzers. The battle lasted until three o'clock in the afternoon on 6 September, when the American Indian forces retired to a safe distance from the fort. The fighting resumed at nine o'clock that night. Relief Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison led the relief effort to Fort Wayne. Efforts were already underway to reinforce Fort Wayne after the news of Fort Detroit reached Newport Barracks. General James Winchester was commander of the Northwestern Army, but Kentucky Governor Charles Scott had just appointed Indiana Territory Governor William Henry Harrison as Major General of the Kentucky Militia and authorized him to relieve Fort Wayne, and Harrison was at Newport Barracks to assume command of the militia.Allison, 206 Harrison wrote a letter to Secretary of War William Eustis explaining the situation and apologizing for taking unauthorized action,Allison, 208 then quickly organized a militia force of 2,200 men and marched North to the fort. A small scouting party led by Fort Wayne settler William Oliver and Ohio Shawnee Captain Logan arrived at Fort Wayne during a lull in the fighting, and raced through Winamac's army into the fort. They delivered the news that a relief effort was underway, and again rode through Winamac's siege to report to Harrison that the Fort was still under U.S. control.Allison, 207 Although the scouting party came with welcome news, Harrison also received a report that a force of 400 Native Americans and 140 British regulars under Tecumseh was marching towards Fort Wayne. Harrison now raced North in an attempt to beat Tecumseh to Fort Wayne. By 8 September, Harrison had reached the village of Simon Girty on the St. Marys River, and was joined by 800 men of the Ohio militia under Colonel Adams and Colonel Hawkins at Shane's Crossing. On 11 September, Winamac attempted one last attack on Fort Wayne, and suffered severe casualties. Suddenly, on 12 September, the attack was broken off, and Winamac's forces crossed the Maumee River and disappeared into the woods.Allison, 209 Harrison's relief army marched towards the fort, uncontested by Winamac.Allison, 211-12 The Potawatami/Miami force retreated into Ohio and Michigan Territory. Aftermath The siege of Fort Wayne prompted Harrison to order punitive expeditions against the Miami which culminated in the Battle of the Mississinewa in December, 1812. Influential Miami Chief Pacanne had remained neutral in this latest war, but after the destruction of so many Miami villages (many were also neutral), he openly declared for the British. The defeats at Fort Harrison and at Fort Wayne caused many Native Americans to lose confidence in their chiefs. Many of them turned instead to the influential leadership of Tecumseh and joined his confederacy. No major Indian attacks occurred in the Indiana Territory for the rest of the war, but it was not until Tecumseh's defeat at the Battle of the Thames that the Indian threat was really eliminated. Three active battalions of the current 3rd Infantry (1-3 Inf, 2-3 Inf and 4-3 Inf) perpetuate the lineage of the old 1st Infantry Regiment, which had a detachment at Fort Wayne.

He painted a series of famous coaching inns, and also a series of 80 metropolitan inns, in which he exploited the picturesque and historical aspect of his subject, to which his talent was best suited. Other subjects he painted include Newmarket Races, Robbing the Mails, The News of Waterloo, The Market Place at Bath. The period he illustrated spans about two centuries; from the days before Hogarth, to the end of the reign of William IV. His work enjoyed great popularity at a time when there was much interest in such vivid reconstruction of the 'romantic past'. John Maggs' father, James, is recorded as an artist at Bath 1837‚Äì1841 and his uncle as a portrait painter 1846‚Äì1848. His daughter also assisted at his studio, known as the Bath Art Studio.

A Harrington jacket (originally known only as a Baracuta jacket or a G9) is a lightweight, waist-length jacket made of cotton, polyester, wool or suede. Designs often incorporate traditional Fraser tartan or checkerboard-patterned lining.  History  1950s Harrington jacket designed as workwear for truckers. Note the external pockets similar to an ike jacket. The first Harrington-style jackets were claimed to be made in the 1930s by the British clothing company, Baracuta. Baracuta's original design, the G9, is still in production. The British company Grenfell, previously known as Haythornthwaite and Sons, also claims to have invented an identical jacket around the same time based on their golf jackets which is also still in production using their own signature cotton. The Harrington from either original source is based on lightweight, roomy jackets worn to play golf hence the G in the G4 or G9 naming convention for Baracuta. Both versions were originally made in Lancashire, England. Baracuta originally manufactured their jacket in Manchester whereas Grenfell were based in Burnley then London. Elvis Presley popularized the Baracuta G9 in his 1958 movie King Creole. The jacket got the nickname \\"Harrington\\" from a character in the 1960s prime time soap opera, Peyton Place. The character in question, Rodney Harrington (played by Ryan O'Neal), is often depicted in a Harrington jacket. It is often claimed that British menswear retailer John Simons christened the jacket originally on a tag casually when for sale in his shop with its name based temporarily on the TV character. Steve McQueen, James Dean and Frank Sinatra were photographed wearing Harrington-style jackets in films and their personal lives. In the US, the McGregor produced Drizzler jacket was an alternative jacket in the same design. The lower-cost version by Van Heusen was also highly popular in the mid 20th-century era within the US though it is no longer produced. This is also true of a version by London Fog. The jacket was seen on visiting USA servicemen after World War II and was adopted as a light, modern jacket by the emerging style-conscious youth during the 1950s. As the Mod scene became more casual and widely adopted, the jacket became popular amongst those identifying as part of that style subculture. When guitarist Eric Clapton felt that The Yardbirds Rhythm & Blues Mod band he played in was becoming long-haired and foppish, he cut his hair short, wore a classic Harrington and rolled-up jeans inspired by the USA casual college look he had seen on USA servicemen when visiting his mother in Germany. This look was seen on TV in July 1964 and is referenced widely as a key subcultural style moment prior to his leaving the band. The jacket became part of Mod wear as that scene became increasingly casualised and stripped down in its mid-1960s later adoptees wearing more polo tops and t-shirts with the jacket. This look became known informally as the 'Peanut' and was part of the progression towards the early skinhead look. This trend carried the adoption of the jacket on through the Mods and Skinheads, including their short-lived Suedehead later smart incarnation. The jacket became fashionable in the United Kingdom in the 1960s among mods and skinheads. These subcultures adopted it as a USA jacket broadly seen in popular media and were largely unaware of its British origins. They enjoyed a resurgence in the late 1970s and early 1980s with skinhead and mod revivalists, as well as old and new fans of Northern soul and scooterboys which had both evolved in part onwards from the original Mod scene as specialist areas of focus that became their own subculture. Within those subcultures, Harringtons are often, though in no way exclusively, worn with Fred Perry or Ben Sherman shirts. By the mid-1970s it may be seen more with bowling and polo shirts than its original wear. Its adoption was carried onwards by Punks in the late 1970s, fans of Indie rock in the 1980s and 1990s. A further revival of the jacket was associated with the mid-1990s rise of Brit Pop with it worn by Damon Albarn of Blur, Oasis and other bands. Britpop style combined Mod fashion with casual sport streetwear. Following the Britpop revival the jacket featured prominently in a light blue version worn by the lead character Gavin played by Matthew Horne on Gavin and Stacey in British BBC TV during the late 2000s. The jacket is an enduring style staple, seen regularly on Mod rock artist Paul Weller through his career and worn by such as the actor Martin Freeman who is a Mod style advocate. Inspired by such as Paul Weller, Liam Gallagher of Oasis co-founded menswear label Pretty Green based on 1960s style originally which includes their version of the Harrington jacket. Most jackets in the style worn by subcultures were not the original manufacturers with cheaper versions available by high street retailers, on market stalls, in Army & General stores and later on the internet. General USA menswear retailers such as Gap, L L Bean or Lands End will usually have a generic version of the jacket. In France, HARRINGTON has been a registered trademark since 1985. though in key markets such as UK, USA and Japan the term 'harrington' is used by many companies. In 2007, Baracuta released three special edition G9 jackets with quotes by Presley, McQueen, and Sinatra printed on the lining to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the brand. In Canada and the US, this style and fabric type of lightweight jacket has traditionally been referred to for well over half a century by most shoppers as the quintessential \\"spring jacket\\", and it has thus been marketed by mass retailers like K-Mart, Bi-Way, Target, Zellers, Eatons, Sears and their contemporaries as simply \\"the spring jacket\\". Advocates of USA 'Ivy League' style clothing are fans of the jacket which is part of its staple wardrobe. Books such as Take Ivy covering USA university campus wear in the mid-1960s show the jacket. The association with American Ivy League and classic British menswear has also made the Harrington popular in Japan, especially in the original heritage brands of Baracuta, Brooks Brothers and Grenfell plus British original brands such as Paul Smith and Aquascutum (now Japanese owned) who are popular there in addition to Harringtons from local companies including Uniqlo and Beams. Over time the jacket has become merged to a degree with the generically collared windcheater, so the jacket may not always have the raised double button collar, ribbed cuff and waist or internal Tartan pattern that is intrinsic to the original design. These will likely not be considered truly as a 'Harrington' by those looking for the original form. The popular version sold by USA menswear outdoor clothing retailer London Fog had a combined form with the upper raised collar but the windcheater body. The collared version often called a Windcheater is the version sold by popular USA companies such as Ralph Lauren, Gant, Woolrich and Tommy Hilfiger. Brooks Brothers make their own version. O'Connell's sell a US-made 'Baracuta' Harrington in their own name. Ben Silver sells the original Grenfell. Luxury British clothier Burberry also uses both the Harrington and windcheater style with the Harrington name. The term Harrington may be used interchangeably leading to some confusion. The jacket was worn by Daniel Craig as Agent 007 in the James Bond film Quantum of Solace in a new black design by Tom Ford. The British clothing company Barbour has been inventive with the jacket introducing versions with elements from their traditional country clothing and incorporating motorbike rider styling in their Steve McQueen inspired collections. Similarly, many modern interpretations now use different materials, treatments, colours and patterns to update the classic jacket with a bespoke version. However, it is the original style in navy blue or stone/beige that endures beyond fashions as the style reference point. There are many hundreds of variants available from companies such as Orvis in the US, Fred Perry, Ben Sherman, Private White VC (based in Manchester and one of the original makers of the Harrington for various brands), Lacoste, Levis, Lyle & Scott, Viyella, Le Coq Sportif, Farah Clothing, Sunspel, Gloverall (famous for their duffle coats), Peter Christian, French Connection and new high-end in-country manufacture companies. additionally, there are many low- cost imitators online that have the look superficially but often at far lower quality than the original basis of production. The subcultural association continues with a range of heritage labels mentioned already plus own label productions from such as Tootal, Jump The Gun, Gabicci, Merc, Original Penguin, Mapcap, Ben Nevis and many others. The Harrington in both its original and windcheater related form remain popular for golf with many specific brands producing versions for the sport. Of note in this area is enduring British heritage brand Wolsey who have produced versions made in Leicester, England for decades that are popular for both menswear and golf. Scottish knitwear companies Lyle & Scott and Pringle also have developed their own Harringtons based on earlier golf jackets from their heritage. Many Harringtons evolve from sporting heritage as seen in tennis jacket origins of Harringtons rather than golf at Fred Perry, Lacoste and Le Coq Sportif. Over time the pure cotton basis of the original jacket has often given way to include become a polyester mix at lower customer prices to enhance the water resistance of the jacket, although the dense cotton count of the originals meant they already had this quality at a higher price point. Fans of the original jacket in its various brands may search out new old stock or vintage items via online marketplaces or vintage shops. Baracuta, Grenfell, and McGregor, in particular, all have loyal fans who seek out their original jackets. The Harrington is a recurring reference point for enduring style and subcultural cool that endures beyond fashions after four decades. It continues to be interpreted and reproduced continually with new versions issued every year. Its comparable simplicity, lightness, ability to be reinterpreted and variation at differing cost points produces opportunities for it to reconnect across successive decades and trends. Even if its origins can sometimes be lost after the length of time it has been produced, the original form and two manufacturers of Baracuta who are most known about and Grenfell remain the original reference point for them all.

It is one of the three main venues within the Scottish Event Campus. Since the opening of the original buildings in 1985, the complex has undergone two major expansions; the first being the SEC Armadillo in 1997, and then the SSE Hydro in 2013. The venue's holding company SEC Limited, is 91% owned by Glasgow City Council and 9% owned by private investors. It is probably best known for hosting concerts, particularly in Hall 4 and Hall 3. Development history The Scottish Development Agency first supported the construction of an exhibition centre in Glasgow in 1979. A site at the former Queen's Dock on the north bank of the Clyde at Finnieston, which had closed to navigation in 1969, was selected.Glasgow Harbour 1932 (Burrell Collection Photo Library), The Glasgow StoryGlasgow, general view, showing Queen's Dock and Yorkhill Hospital. Oblique aerial photograph taken facing north (1934), Canmore Land reclamation works started in 1982 using rubble from the demolished St Enoch railway station. The construction of the SECC buildings began on the site in 1983. Main Building The Main Building was completed and opened in 1985, with a concert by the Royal Scottish National Orchestra in Hall 1. It later held the Grand International Show in Hall 4 as part of the 1988 Glasgow Garden Festival. In 1990, the SECC was one of the hubs of Glasgow's year as European City of Culture. Upon its opening, the Centre quickly gained its nickname from the local press and thus to general usage, \\"The Big Red Shed\\", owing to its outward appearance, which resembled a giant red painted warehouse. The nickname became redundant after the Main Building was expanded and painted grey in 1997. The SECC occupies 64 acres (260,000 m2) of land ‚Äì most of which is surface car parking space ‚Äì and hosts numerous music concerts, exhibitions and professional conferences. The SECC also has its own railway station, Exhibition Centre, on the Argyle Line of Glasgow's suburban railway network. The 16 storey Forum Hotel (now part of the Crowne Plaza chain) was opened on the site in 1989. In September 1996, a new exhibition hall, Hall 3, was opened. SEC Armadillo The Clyde Auditorium with the main SECC building behind it In September 1995, construction began on a new building ‚Äì the Clyde Auditorium ‚Äì to become part of the SECC complex. Designed by award-winning architect Sir Norman Foster and often called \\"the armadillo\\" by Glaswegians, this new 3,000 capacity building was completed in August 1997. Queens Dock 2 expansion In April 2004, the owners SEC Ltd again commissioned Foster and Partners to design a ¬£562 million regeneration of the Queen's Dock area, under the name QD2 ‚Äì so called as this is the second regeneration of the former Queen's Dock area since the centre's inception. This project incorporated SSE Hydro, a 12,500 seat, ¬£50 million concert arena for the SECC, which opened in September 2013. Shows and events The venue hosted the Eurovision Dance Contest 2008. The SECC hosted the Girls' Day Out Show in 2009, 2010 and 2012. It staged The Scottish Golf Show in 2009 and 2010. The venue annually stages the popular BBC Good Food Show. On 15 November 2015, it played host to Insane Championship Wrestling's biggest show of the year, Fear & Loathing VIII. It also was the biggest selling show in British wrestling history since Big Daddy fought Giant Haystacks at Wembley Arena in 1981. The SECC hosted the World Science Fiction convention twice, as Intersection, the 53rd World Science Fiction convention in 1995, and Interaction, the 63rd World Science Fiction Convention in 2005 (including the SEC Armadillo). In June 2012, Irish pop band Westlife were honoured with four specially commissioned bar stools (to be a permanent fixture at the venue) to mark 49 performances at the SECC where they entertained over 380,000 fans over the years, selling more tickets than any other act.Scottish tribute to Westlife's signature bar stool move, Evening Standard, 20 June 2012  NHS Louisa Jordan  The SEC Centre was planned to host the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference.

It concerned the nature of so-called spiral nebulae and the size of the universe; Shapley believed that distant nebulae were relatively small and lay within the outskirts of Earth's home galaxy, while Curtis held that they were in fact independent galaxies, implying that they were exceedingly large and distant. The two scientists first presented independent technical papers about \\"The Scale of the Universe\\" during the day and then took part in a joint discussion that evening. Much of the lore of the Great Debate grew out of two papers published by Shapley and by Curtis in the May 1921 issue of the Bulletin of the National Research Council. The published papers each included counter arguments to the position advocated by the other scientist at the 1920 meeting. In the aftermath of the public debate, scientists have been able to verify individual pieces of evidence from both astronomers, but on the main point of the existence of other galaxies, Curtis has been proven correct. Arguments Shapley was arguing in favor of the Milky Way as the entirety of the universe. He believed that \\"spiral nebulae\\" such as Andromeda were simply part of the Milky Way. He could back up this claim by citing relative sizes‚Äîif Andromeda were not part of the Milky Way, then its distance must have been on the order of 108 light years‚Äîa span most contemporary astronomers would not accept. Adriaan van Maanen was also providing evidence to Shapley's argument. Van Maanen was a well-respected astronomer of the time who claimed he had observed the Pinwheel Galaxy rotating. If the Pinwheel Galaxy were in fact a distinct galaxy and could be observed to be rotating on a timescale of years, its orbital velocity would be enormous and there would clearly be a violation of the universal speed limit, the speed of light. Shapley also backed up his claims with the observation of a nova in the Andromeda \\"nebula\\" that had briefly outshone the entire nebula, constituting a seemingly impossible output of energy were Andromeda in fact a separate galaxy. Curtis on the other side contended that Andromeda and other such \\"nebulae\\" were separate galaxies, or \\"island universes\\" (a term invented by the 18th-century philosopher Immanuel Kant, who also believed that the \\"spiral nebulae\\" were extragalactic). He showed that there were more novae in Andromeda than in the Milky Way. From this he could ask why there were more novae in one small section of the galaxy than the other sections of the galaxy, if Andromeda were not a separate galaxy but simply a nebula within Earth's galaxy. This led to supporting Andromeda as a separate galaxy with its own signature age and rate of nova occurrences. He also cited dark lanes present in other galaxies similar to the dust clouds found in Earth's own galaxy. Curtis stated that if van Maanen's observation of the Pinwheel Galaxy rotating were correct, he himself would have been wrong about the scale of the universe and that the Milky Way would fully encompass it. After the debate Later in the 1920s, Edwin Hubble showed that Andromeda was far outside the Milky Way by measuring Cephid variable stars, proving that Curtis was correct. It is now known that the Milky Way is only one of as many as an estimated 200 billion () to 2 trillion () or more galaxies, proving Curtis the more accurate party in the debate. Also, astronomers generally accept that the nova Shapley referred to in his arguments was in fact a supernova, which does indeed temporarily outshine the combined output of an entire galaxy. On other points, the results were mixed (the actual size of the Milky Way is in between the sizes proposed by Shapley and Curtis), or in favor of Shapley (Curtis's galaxy was centered on the Sun, while Shapley correctly placed the Sun in the outer regions of the galaxy). It later became apparent that van Maanen's observations were incorrect‚Äîone can not actually see the Pinwheel Galaxy rotate during a human lifespan.  Other Great Debates  The format of the great debate has been used subsequently to argue the nature of fundamental questions in astronomy. In honor of the first \\"Great Debate\\", the Smithsonian has hosted three more events.

The shock occurred in the northern region of Armenia (then part of the Soviet Union) which is vulnerable to large and destructive earthquakes and is part of a larger active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps to the Himalayas. Activity in the area is associated with tectonic plate boundary interaction and the source of the event was slip on a thrust fault just to the north of Spitak. The complex incident ruptured multiple faults, with a strike-slip event occurring shortly after the initiation of the mainshock. Between 25,000 and 50,000 were killed and up to 130,000 were injured. Seismologists thoroughly studied the effects of the Spitak event, including the mainshock and aftershock fault rupture mechanisms and were on site setting up temporary seismometers before the end of 1988. Earthquake engineering experts scrutinized building construction styles and found fault in the poorly constructed apartments and other buildings that were built during the Era of Stagnation under the rule of Leonid Brezhnev. The cities of Spitak, Leninakan (Gyumri) and Kirovakan (Vanadzor) were greatly affected with large losses of life and devastating effects to buildings and other structures. A number of the smaller outlying villages away from the larger population centers were also severely affected. Despite the tensions of the Cold War, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev formally asked the United States for humanitarian help within a few days of the earthquake, the first such request since the late 1940s. One hundred and thirteen countries sent substantial amounts of humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union in the form of rescue equipment, search teams and medical supplies. Private donations and assistance from non-governmental organizations also had a large part of the international effort. While transporting some of these supplies to the region, a Soviet aircraft carrying 9 crew members and 69 military personnel, and a transport plane from Yugoslavia, were both destroyed in separate incidents. In support of the relief effort, recording artists united to produce several music-related contributions for the victims of the quake. A song was produced by a duo of French composers (including Charles Aznavour) and a studio album that featured songs donated by mainstream rock bands was released from the Rock Aid Armenia effort by the British music industry. Preface Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus region was experiencing a surge in political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held in the capital of Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee and Gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took a turn for the worse in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a mass movement of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing ethnic violence arrived from Azerbaijan. Earthquake USGS shakemap showing the December 7 mainshock intensity The source of the event was a fault rupture south of the Caucasus Mountains, a mountain range that has been produced by the convergence of the Arabian and the Eurasian tectonic plates. The range is situated along an active seismic belt that stretches from the Alps in southern Europe to the Himalayas in Asia. The seismicity along this belt is marked by frequent major earthquakes from the Aegean Sea, through Turkey and Iran, and into Afghanistan. Though the recurrence of seismic events in Armenia does not reach the high frequency that is seen in other segments of this zone, rapid crustal deformation there is associated with active thrust faulting and volcanic activity. Mount Ararat, a dormant volcano, lies to the south of the quake's epicenter in Turkey. The earthquake occurred along a known thrust fault striking parallel to the Caucasus range and dipping to the north-northeast. Bruce Bolt, a seismologist and a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, walked the length of the fault scarp in 1992 and found that the vertical displacement measured along most of the length with the southwest end reaching . During the earthquake, the northeast-facing side of the Spitak section rode up and over the southwest-facing side. Waveform modeling established that the faulting originated at a depth of with the epicenter on the Alavar thrust fault on the slopes of the Lesser Caucasus mountains north of Mount Aragats. The mainshock produced surface rupture and propagated to the west with a separate strike- slip sub-event occurring two seconds later that propagated to the southeast. Going westward the fault split into two branches, a north-dipping reverse fault (north branch) and a right slip fault (south branch), but neither produced surface rupture. A total of five sub-events occurred in the first eleven seconds and an aftershock measuring 5.8 (local magnitude) occurred four minutes and twenty seconds later. Damage Building damage in Leninakan Some of the strongest shaking occurred in industrial areas with chemical and food processing plants, electrical substations, and power plants. The Metsamor Nuclear Power Plant, around from the epicenter, experienced only minor shaking and no damage occurred there, but was eventually closed for a period of six years due to vulnerability concerns. It was reopened in 1995 amid criticism of lack of training, political instability in the Caucasus region, and accusations that the plant was of inadequate design. At that time the International Atomic Energy Agency's assistant director general Morris Rosen said of the situation \\"... you would never build a plant in that area, that's for sure, with what's known now.\\" Many buildings did not hold up to the shaking of the earthquake and those that did collapse often lacked any survival space, but lack of effective medical care and poor planning also contributed to the substantial scope of the disaster. Buildings that didn't collapse featured well-maintained masonry and skeletal components that were joined together adequately in a way that allowed for the building to resist seismic waves. Most bridges and tunnels and other public infrastructure withstood the earthquake but hospitals did not fare well. Most collapsed, killing two-thirds of their doctors, destroying equipment and medicine, and reducing the capacity to handle the critical medical needs in the region. The Soviet news media and government officials soon began to discuss the apparent substandard construction styles that had caused so many of Armenia's buildings to collapse. Gorbachev, in a TV interview several weeks after his expedited return from New York City, said that the concrete blocks had been built with more than enough sand but too little concrete, and suggested that the concrete had been stolen. Leonid Bibin, deputy chairman of the state building committee, stated that many newer homes collapsed as well and that he was beginning an investigation into the matter and that criminal charges would be brought. The official communist party newspaper Pravda said that poor construction, like other issues of neglect in the Soviet system, could be blamed on the Era of Stagnation from the era of Leonid Brezhnev. A team of earthquake and engineering experts from the United States spent a period of time in Armenia in December 1988 and January 1989. The group, including a structural engineer who specialized in seismic-resistant designs, agreed that building inadequacies were the primary reason why the strong (but not huge) earthquake was so damaging, although the freezing temperatures also played a role in the unusually high death toll. The earthquake death toll was by far the highest worldwide in the 1980s and third-highest worldwide in the period 1971‚Äì2003 (33 years). The engineers who scrutinized the damaged buildings and the rescue workers who had dismantled the buildings while extricating survivors ascribe both design shortcomings and improper construction methods for the failure of the buildings. The Soviets had modified their construction style to accommodate the known seismic risk in the area, but they acknowledged to the team that many of the buildings were not built to withstand an earthquake of that magnitude. An engineer with the team stated that the regulations for the area mandated that buildings be required to stand up against events measuring seven or eight on the twelve degree Medvedev‚ÄìSponheuer‚ÄìKarnik scale. The earthquake's effects were assessed at ten on that seismic scale. Severely damaged masonry buildings in Spitak The three cities closest to the fault rupture experienced different levels of damage. Both Leninakan and Kirovakan were roughly equidistant from the shock, yet Leninakan had greater damage. This may be explained by a sedimentary layer that is present beneath the city. The Earthquake Engineering Research Institute's team compared building damage in each city and observed similar results when comparing stone buildings four stories or less in height, but for taller frame-stone buildings, 62% were destroyed at Leninakan while only 23% collapsed at Kirovakan. While on site during aftershock monitoring, the US research team verified the presence of soil amplification effects when pronounced difference in readings were observed when compared with nearby rock sites. Uneven distribution of the seismic energy may have also contributed to the fluctuation in damage. In late December the last of the survivors that were able to be extricated were pulled from the fallen buildings, rescue operations ceased, and the cleanup began, beginning with the destruction of buildings that were too heavily damaged to be repaired. Six friends were in the basement of a nine-story building relocating barrels when it came down around them on December 7. Their injuries were minor, but one person did suffer a broken arm. They supposedly sustained themselves on the food supplies‚Äîfruit salad, pickles, and smoked ham‚Äîthat were available in the basement for 35 days before their rescue in January, but this turned out to be a hoax. Aftershocks The area where Armenia lies is of interest to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively early stage of continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1,500 km2. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units. The instrumentation included ten smoked paper analog seismometers that were configured to allow for 48 hours of continuous single-component data recording. Six digital recorders built by the Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg were also used to record signals from three-component seismometers. Eight of the selected sites were equipped with a vertical component velocity transducer along with an FM telemetry link to transfer data back to a central station where a three-component unit was stationed. There the seismic signals were digitized, along with an internal time signal and an external DCF77 time signal, and stored on magnetic tape. The tapes were then played back and the P-wave and S-wave arrival times were used to automatically determine aftershock locations. Approximately two hundred aftershocks were recorded each day for the first several days of the expedition and at the end of the recording period in February the equipment was still picking up around 100 shocks per day. The team then set out to determine an accurate velocity model using data from the more accurate telemetry network. The soviet geophysicists detonated 100 kilograms of TNT in a hole drilled near the mainshock epicenter and the resulting shock waves were detected and used to help pinpoint a more accurate crustal velocity value of 5.3 to 5.4 km/s. The epicenters of the recorded aftershocks formed a relatively narrow band. On the east end the events were shallow while the western side, where the majority of the larger aftershocks were concentrated, the hypocenters were up to deep. The shocks at the southeastern segment indicated right-lateral strike-slip movement along a nearly vertical fault, and may have been related to the Alavar fault. Moving westward closer to the central segments though, a transition of the fault type was becoming apparent, where an almost equal distribution of reverse fault mechanisms were observed as the strike-slip type. The east-central segment coincided with the surface breaks between Spitak and Gekhasar, while the west- central portion's break was concealed under an anticline and was not visible at the surface. Along the western segments the fault split into two branches with one to the southwest and the other to the northwest. Liquefaction Buildings and other structures were extensively damaged during the earthquake, but roadways and railways also experienced disturbances. Many case histories pertaining to liquefaction in sandy soil exist, but few exist with respect to gravel and gravelly sands. In certain situations gravelly sands may liquefy in similar fashion as saturated sands. The first well-documented case of liquefaction in gravelly sands was in regard to the 1983 Borah Peak earthquake in the United States. Several investigations of that event took place in the 1980s and early 1990s and the primary conclusions were that a critical condition for liquefaction to occur in that type of soil was the presence of a low permeable crust that did not allow pore water pressures to subside and that the assessment method and associated standard penetration test values used with sandy soils also applied to gravelly soils. Three locations between Spitak and Nalband (to the west) that were within several kilometers of the fault were examined for ground disturbances and each site was scrutinized for the effects of liquefaction. The first site was on the highway that linked the three most damaged cities and was adjacent to a tributary of the Pambak river where the water table was close to the surface. The highway's embankment failed, and though the site was repaired immediately, the resulting damage to the highway caused considerable delay in getting people and supplies into and out of the area following the disaster. Numerous sand boils were seen in the region northwest of Spitak including within of the failed embankment. A second site that was close to the fault, also near the Pambak river and with similar soil deposits, did not experience liquefaction, though it would have experienced the same high peak ground accelerations as the failed highway embankment. Aftermath Holy Saviour's Church in Gyumri after the earthquake Avant-garde musician Pierre Schaeffer led a 498-member French rescue team to look for survivors in Leninakan, and worked there until all foreign personnel were asked to leave after the plan to bulldoze what was left of the ruins was formulated. The total number of volunteer rescue personnel in Leninakan totalled 2,000, with teams from Austria, Canada, Switzerland, the United States and Yugoslavia. Nikolai Ryzhkov, the then Chairman of the Council of Ministers, was awarded the National Hero of Armenia for his work in rebuilding the city following the earthquake. Seventy-eight people were killed while on a relief mission to Leninakan when a Soviet Ilyushin Il-76 crashed on approach to the airport there. Nine crew and 69 military personnel were on board the plane that struck a helicopter in foggy conditions at the small airport that was overrun with rescue flights. In the days following the earthquake, the normally quiet airstrip was receiving up to 180 flights per day carrying food, medical supplies, and disaster management experts. Those who were killed on the plane were planning to join an estimated 20,000 soldiers and 85,000 civil defence workers in rescue efforts by searching for survivors, supplying food and water, and setting up sanitation facilities in the region. At the Yerevan airport, western pilots reported a breakdown in air traffic control communications, with flight controllers not delivering the necessary flight navigation instructions, allowing for a critical lack of separation as foreign planes made their way into the area. A second air transport incident occurred the following day at Yerevan (capital of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic) when an Antonov An-12 from Yugoslavia crashed, killing all seven crew on board. The crash was blamed on the pilots' failure to properly adjust the altimeter following a miscommunication with the air traffic controllers. A group of French recording artists and actors came together with the French writer and composer Charles Aznavour to record the 1989 song \\"Pour toi Arm√©nie\\" (For you Armenia). Aznavour, together with Armenian-French composer Georges Garvarentz, formed a foundation called \\"Aznavour for Armenia\\" and composed the song as a call for help for the Armenians. It took six weeks from the creation of the song to completion of the disc and with almost two million copies sold, the foundation was able to build 47 schools and three orphanages for the victims of the disaster. Rock Aid Armenia, also known in earlier stages as Live Aid Armenia, was a humanitarian effort by the British music industry to raise money to help those affected by the earthquake. A monument, Armenian Earthquake, expressing the appreciation of the Armenian people for assistance from the U.S. was erected in Washington, D.C. in 1990. Response A French search and rescue worker searches for buried people with the aid of a detection dog Gorbachev set aside 5 billion rubles (about US$8 billion) in funds for a start on what would likely be a recovery cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that may have had a positive effect on Soviet Union‚ÄìUnited States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for economic restructuring. Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan. The world responded rapidly to the disaster in Leninakan and Spitak, with much of Europe sending cargo aircraft loaded with medical supplies, rescue equipment, and trained personnel to assist in the recovery, and even more reinforcement came in from Latin America and the Far East. Mikhail Gorbachev was in New York on his first day of visits with Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush at the time of the earthquake, and once the scale of the disaster was realized, a quick departure was made back to Armenia, with the Kremlin formally asking for American help. Washington immediately responded with offers of doctors, medical equipment, and rescue teams, and by the first weekend the first US plane arrived in Yerevan with search and rescue teams and detection dogs. The French arrived in Armenia in the late evening on Friday, December 9 and relieved the exhausted Armenian workers who then returned to Yerevan. Japan sent a monetary gift of $9 million while Italy had plans to build a prefabricated village for the victims, and West Germany offered to send more than a dozen heavy cranes. The Americans donated generously as well, with Washington dispatching eight official planeloads of official relief aid plus a Lockheed C-141 Starlifter from Italy. Private donations from the United States were also significant. Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca arranged for a fund drive, and in Chicago (one of five major Armenian population centers in the US) the community raised $800,000 and donated of supplies. Mikhail Gorbachev with Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush in New York on the day of the earthquake American businessman and philanthropist Armand Hammer, well known to the Soviet Union for his financial pursuits and humanitarian ties, left Los Angeles for Armenia on board a Boeing 727 loaded with of medical supplies that were provided by the American Red Cross. Hammer, known for his decades of work with the Occidental Petroleum Corporation, had spoken with Gorbachev prior to leaving and was carrying with him $1 million in relief funds. Half of those funds were from World Vision International, a California-based relief and development umbrella organization, and the other half were his own personal donation. The flight also carried Robert Seiple (president of World Vision) and a UCLA doctor who had worked in the aftermath of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Red tape inevitably held up some of the rescue efforts and criticism of the perceived flawed processes soon followed. The newspaper Pravda complained that the lack of cranes meant that \\"seconds and hours are being lost‚Äîthat means lives.\\" The paper also stated that too many Soviet personnel were giving advice and not enough people were actually searching. The daily newspaper Sotsialisticheskaya Industriya noted that there were families living out in the open even while there were an abundance of tents available. Health minister Yevgeniy Chazov urged the creation of a governmental body to assist with disaster management. Baxter International, an American health care company with headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, designed and built a flying medical lab set up with 20 dialysis machines to be used with victims suffering from crush syndrome (trauma associated with building collapses), but were unable to get started for four days until the visas were available. With the hospitals destroyed, and their limited knowledge of the care requirements, the Soviets were not well-equipped to deal with the cases of crush syndrome. Author and professor of geopolitics Pierre Verluise detailed in his 1995 book Armenia in Crisis: The 1988 Earthquake, how a French doctor and director of a Leninakan hospital described that he had seen one hundred victims suffering from the syndrome each day during the first three days. In order to prevent kidney failure or death, the treatment requires prompt hospitalization, and, according to the doctor, the victims were not receiving adequate medication and dialysis and, as a result, most died before the arrival of the first foreign dialysis machines. Rebuilding In February 1989 one hundred construction workers were assembling temporary housing for themselves in Leninakan with a plan to start on the local population's housing by the end of the month, though schools and factories were also on the list of facilities to be rebuilt. Deputy chairman of a city building and architecture council said that updated building codes like those in the United States were being drafted (along with a strict requirement that the new protocols be respected) and that the new buildings would be no taller than four stories and would be located away from areas with the highest seismic risk. Other officials decided that the town would be relocated several kilometers to the southwest. As of July 1989 about $500 million in donations had been delivered to the Armenians from 113 countries. Most of those funds went into the initial relief work and medical care plus the beginning portion of the rebuilding phase. Yuri S. Mkhitarian, an Armenian State Building Committee official, gave an updated damage report that included some of the outlying communities away from the population centers stating that 342 villages were damaged and another 58 were destroyed. The negative effect the earthquake had on the economy of Armenia was apparent. Mkhitarian said that 130 factories were destroyed and 170,000 people were out of work. Officials acknowledged that the work to complete the rebuilding may take up to five years or longer, a supposition that more than doubled Gorbachev's estimate of two years. At that time 20 projects had completed the planning process and some had been approved and construction started. In Leninakan there was a need for 18 new hospitals, 12 of which could be funded with the assistance of the republics of the Soviet Union, but foreign help would be required to build six additional facilities. Boris Karapetyan, director of earthquake studies at the Yerevan Polytechnical Institute, said of the difficult rebuilding process \\"Coordination is a major, major problem. This is a massive undertaking, and foreign involvement is both a necessary and a complicating factor. We need foreign assistance‚Äîand there is no doubt about that‚Äîbut our friends do not know the local conditions and propose things that cannot or should not be built in an earthquake-prone region.\\" The Soviets and an American group of architects each devised separate outlines for rebuilding the town of Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that were found to be rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to not take into account the hillside at the new city's location, and the American plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.

The station is served by the District line and is between Turnham Green and Acton Town stations. It is located at the junction of Bollo Lane and Acton Lane about 150 m north of Chiswick High Road (A315) and is in Travelcard Zone 3. It is the only station on the Ealing Broadway branch to be served exclusively by the District line. The station is located in the west of Chiswick, near Acton Green common. History A westbound Piccadilly line train overtakes a District line train calling at Chiswick Park The station was opened on 1 July 1879 by the District Railway (DR, now the District line) on its extension from Turnham Green to Ealing Broadway. The station was originally named Acton Green after the adjacent Acton Green Common to the east. It was renamed to Chiswick Park and Acton Green in March 1887. Following the electrification of the DR's tracks north of Acton Town in 1903, services between Acton Town and central London were electrified on 1 July 1905. In 1910 the station was given its present name. Between 1931 and 1932 the station was rebuilt, in preparation for the western extension of the Piccadilly line from Hammersmith. Although the Piccadilly line has never served the station, its trains run non-stop through the station on the centre tracks, and the reconstruction was required to enable the addition of two fast tracks for those services to be located between the District line's stopping service tracks. The new station was designed by Charles Holden in a modern European style using brick, reinforced concrete and glass. Holden's design was inspired by Alfred Grenander's underground station Krumme Lanke in Berlin. Similar to the station at Arnos Grove that Holden designed for the eastern Piccadilly line extension, Chiswick Park station features a tall semi-circular ticket hall adjacent to the embankment carrying the tracks. Externally the brick walls of the ticket hall are punctuated with panels of clerestory windows and the structure is capped with a flat concrete slab roof which abuts the cantilevered concrete canopy of the westbound platform. A similar canopy shelters the eastbound platform accessed through the embankment. To make the station's location visible from Chiswick High Road the station was also provided with a square brick tower surmounted by the UNDERGROUND roundel and the station's name. The station has been a Grade II listed building since 18 February 1987. Trivia Immediately to the south of the station entrance, on the other side of the road junction, the tracks of the District line's Richmond branch cross under the road and about 100 m to the east of the station, the eastbound track crosses under the four District and Piccadilly line tracks on its way towards Turnham Green station. Chiswick Park station is closer to Turnham Green (on the south side of Chiswick High Road) than the station of that name. The station appears on the cover of Caspa's Ave It Volume 1 EP. The station is located on the site of the Battle of Turnham Green (1642), during the First English Civil War.

He is often referred to as the \\"Godfather of Ska\\". Career Born in Cuba of mixed Cuban and Jamaican descent, Aitken and his family settled in Jamaica in 1938. After an early career working for the Jamaican Tourist Board singing mento songs for visitors arriving at Kingston Harbour, he became a popular nightclub entertainer. His first recordings in the late 1950s were mento tunes such as \\"Nebuchnezer\\", \\"Sweet Chariot\\" (aka the gospel classic \\"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot\\") and \\"Baba Kill Me Goat\\".Thomspon, Dave, Reggae & Caribbean Music, 2002, Backbeat Books, Aitken's 1958 single \\"Boogie in My Bones\\"/\\"Little Sheila\\" was one of the first records produced by Chris Blackwell and the first Jamaican popular music record to be released in the United Kingdom.Moskowitz, David V. (2006), Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p. 6-7 Other more Jamaican rhythm and blues orientated singles from this period include \\"Low Down Dirty Girl\\" and \\"More Whisky\\" both produced by Duke Reid. Aitken moved to Brixton, London, in 1960 and recorded for the Blue Beat label, releasing fifteen singles before returning to Jamaica in 1963. He recorded for Duke Reid, with backing from the Skatalites on tracks such as \\"Zion\\" and \\"Weary Wanderer\\",Oxford Dictionary of National Biography 2005-2008 0199671540- 2013 p. 9, \\"including 'Zion' and 'Judgement Day' for Duke Reid, and 'What aWeeping' and 'Zion CityWall' for Leslie Kong.\\" before returning to the UK, where he began working with Pama Records. He recorded hits such as \\"Fire in Mi Wire\\" and \\"Landlord and Tenants\\", which led to a wider recognition outside of Jamaica and the UK. This cemented his position as one of ska's leading artists and earned him the nicknames The Godfather of Ska, and later Boss Skinhead. He gained a loyal following not only among the West Indian community, but also among mods, skinheads and other ska fans.Larkin, Colin: The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, 1998, Virgin Books, He had hit records in the United Kingdom and other countries in the 1950s through to the 1970s on labels such as Blue Beat, Pama, Trojan, Rio, Dr. Bird, Nu-Beat, Ska-Beat, Hot Lead and Dice. Some of his singles featured B-sides credited to his brother, guitarist Bobby Aitken. Aitken also recorded a few talk-over/deejay tracks under the guise of 'King Horror', such as \\"Loch Ness Monster\\", \\"Dracula, Prince of Darkness\\" and \\"The Hole\\". Aitken settled in Leicester with his wife in 1970. His output slowed in the 1970s and during this period he worked as an entertainer in nightclubs and restaurants in the area including the popular 'Costa Brava Restaurant' in Leicester under his real name Lorenzo. In 1980, with ska enjoying a resurgence in the wake of the 2 Tone movement, Aitken had his only success in the UK Singles Chart with \\"Rudi Got Married\\" (No. 60) released on I-Spy Records (the label created and managed by Secret Affair.Laurel Aitken and the Unitone, Official Charts Aitken's career took in mento/calypso, R&B;, ska, rock steady, and reggae, and in the 1990s he even turned his talents to dancehall. He performed occasional concerts almost until his death from a heart attack in 2005. After a long campaign, a blue plaque in his honour was put up at his Leicester home in 2007.

The interplanetary medium (IPM) consists of the mass and energy which fills the Solar System, and through which all the larger Solar System bodies, such as planets, dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets, move. The IPM stops at the heliopause, outside of which the interstellar medium begins. Before 1950, interplanetary space was widely considered to either be an empty vacuum, or consisting of \\"aether\\". Composition and physical characteristics The interplanetary medium includes interplanetary dust, cosmic rays, and hot plasma from the solar wind. The temperature of the interplanetary medium varies. For dust particles within the asteroid belt, typical temperatures range from 200 K (‚àí73 ¬∞C) at 2.2 AU down to 165 K (‚àí108 ¬∞C) at 3.2 AU. The density of the interplanetary medium is very low, decreasing in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from the Sun. It is variable, and may be affected by magnetic fields and events such as coronal mass ejections. At about 5 particles per cubic centimeter in the vicinity of the Earth, it may rise to as high as 100 particles/cm. Since the interplanetary medium is a plasma, or gas of ions, the interplanetary medium has the characteristics of a plasma, rather than a simple gas. For example, it carries the Sun's magnetic field with it, is highly electrically conductive (resulting in the heliospheric current sheet), forms plasma double layers where it comes into contact with a planetary magnetosphere or at the heliopause, and exhibits filamentation (such as in aurorae). The plasma in the interplanetary medium is also responsible for the strength of the Sun's magnetic field at the orbit of the Earth being over 100 times greater than originally anticipated. If space were a vacuum, then the Sun's tesla magnetic dipole field would reduce with the cube of the distance to about tesla. But satellite observations show that it is about 100 times greater at around tesla. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) theory predicts that the motion of a conducting fluid (e.g., the interplanetary medium) in a magnetic field induces electric currents which in turn generate magnetic fields, and in this respect it behaves like an MHD dynamo. Extent of the interplanetary medium The outer edge of the heliosphere is the boundary between the flow of the solar wind and the interstellar medium. This boundary is known as the heliopause and is believed to be a fairly sharp transition of the order of 110 to 160 astronomical units from the Sun. The interplanetary medium thus fills the roughly spherical volume contained within the heliopause. Interaction with planets How the interplanetary medium interacts with planets depends on whether they have magnetic fields or not. Bodies such as the Moon have no magnetic field and the solar wind can impact directly on their surface. Over billions of years, the lunar regolith has acted as a collector for solar wind particles, and so studies of rocks from the lunar surface can be valuable in studies of the solar wind. High-energy particles from the solar wind impacting on the lunar surface also cause it to emit faintly at X-ray wavelengths. Planets with their own magnetic field, such as the Earth and Jupiter, are surrounded by a magnetosphere within which their magnetic field is dominant over the Sun's. This disrupts the flow of the solar wind, which is channelled around the magnetosphere. Material from the solar wind can \\"leak\\" into the magnetosphere, causing aurorae and also populating the Van Allen radiation belts with ionised material. Observable phenomena of the interplanetary medium The interplanetary medium is responsible for several optical phenomena visible from Earth. Zodiacal light is a broad band of faint light sometimes seen after sunset and before sunrise, stretched along the ecliptic and appearing brightest near the horizon. This glow is caused by sunlight scattered by dust particles in the interplanetary medium between Earth and the Sun. A similar phenomenon centered at the antisolar point, gegenschein is visible in a naturally dark, moonless night sky. Much fainter than zodiacal light, this effect is caused by sunlight backscattered by dust particles beyond Earth's orbit. History The term \\"interplanetary\\" appears to have been first used in print in 1691 by the scientist Robert Boyle: \\"The air is different from the √¶ther (or vacuum) in the... interplanetary spaces\\" Boyle Hist. Air. In 1898, American astronomer Charles Augustus Young wrote: \\"Inter-planetary space is a vacuum, far more perfect than anything we can produce by artificial means...\\" (The Elements of Astronomy, Charles Augustus Young, 1898). The notion that space is considered to be a vacuum filled with an \\"aether\\", or just a cold, dark vacuum continued up until the 1950s. Tufts University Professor of astronomy, Kenneth R. Lang, writing in 2000 noted, \\"Half a century ago, most people visualized our planet as a solitary sphere traveling in a cold, dark vacuum of space around the Sun\\". In 2002, Akasofu stated \\"The view that interplanetary space is a vacuum into which the Sun intermittently emitted corpuscular streams was changed radically by Ludwig Biermann (1951, 1953) who proposed on the basis of comet tails, that the Sun continuously blows its atmosphere out in all directions at supersonic speed\\" (Syun-Ichi Akasofu, Exploring the Secrets of the Aurora, 2002) See also * Interplanetary space * Interplanetary dust cloud * Interplanetary magnetic field * Interstellar space * Interstellar medium * Interstellar dust * Intergalactic space * Intergalactic medium * Intergalactic dust * List of plasma (physics) articles ReferencesExternal links * Bill Arnett's The Nine Planets page about the interplanetary medium Outer space Plasma physics Planetary systems Solar System Space plasmas ","title":"Interplanetary medium"},{"id":"1352323","text":"Jan Saudek (born 13 May 1935) is an art photographer and painter. He and his twin brother Kaja Saudek are holocaust survivors. Jan Saudek's art work represents a unique technique combining photography and painting. In his country of origin, Czechoslovakia, Jan was considered a disturbed artist and oppressed by authorities. His art gained more prominence during the 1990s, thanks to his collaboration with the publisher Taschen. During the 2000s, Saudek lost all his photo negatives in matrimonial dispute and his pictures are now displayed on internet for free. Jan claims they were stolen from him. Jan is the author of many ‚Äúmise en scene‚Äù that were re-taken and copied by other artists. The clich√© of a naked man holding a naked new born baby with tenderness became a picture that was reproduced so many times that the composition became as commonplace as posing for a graduation picture. During his life in communist Czechoslovakia, Jan was labeled by the totalitarian regime as a pornographer. He lived in poverty using the only room in his basement as his studio. A disintegrating wall and a window giving a glimpse into the backyard became the witnesses of his fantasies and collaborations with models of all different sizes and origins. Life Jan Saudek and his twin brother Karel (also known as K√°ja) were born to a Slavic (Czech) mother and Jewish father in Prague in 1935. Their mother's family came to Prague from Bohemia, and their father from the city of Dƒõƒç√≠n in the northwest part of that area. During World War II and after the invasion of the German Nazis, both sides of his family were racially persecuted by the invaders. Many of his Jewish relatives died in Theresienstadt concentration camp during the war. Jan and his brother Karel were sent to a children's concentration camp for Mischlinge (mixed-blood in German, as Nazis classified Jews as a race distinct from \\"Aryans\\"), located in Silesia near the present Polish-Czech border. Their father Gustav was deported to Theresienstadt concentration camp in February 1945. Although their mother and many other relatives died, both sons and father survived the war. A Communist-dominated government gained power after the war to rule the country, enforced by the Soviet Union and considered to be behind the Iron Curtain. According to Saudek's biography, he acquired his first camera, a Kodak Baby Brownie, in 1950. He apprenticed to a photographer, and in 1952 started working in a print shop; he was restricted to this work by the Communist government until 1983. In 1959, he started using the more advanced Flexaret 6x6 camera, and also engaged in painting and drawing. After completing his military service, he was inspired in 1963 by the catalogue for American photographer Edward Steichen's The Family of Man exhibition, and began to work to become a serious art photographer. In 1969, Saudek traveled to the United States, where he was encouraged in his work by curator Hugh Edwards of the Art Institute of Chicago. Returning to Prague, Saudek had to work at his photography clandestinely in a cellar, to avoid the attentions of the secret police. With his work turning to themes of personal erotic freedom, he used implicitly political symbols of corruption and innocence. From the late 1970s, he became recognized in the West as the leading Czech photographer, and also developed a following among photographers in his own country. In 1983, the first book of Saudek's work was published in the English-speaking world. The same year, he became a freelance photographer; the Czech Communist authorities allowed him to stop working in the print shop, and gave him permission to apply for a permit to work as an artist. In 1987, the archives of his negatives were seized by the police, but later returned. Saudek lives and works in Prague. His brother K√°ja Saudek was also an artist, the best-known Czech graphic novelist. Work Poster for a film by Adolf Zika: Jan Saudek: Bound by Passion (2008). His best-known work is notable for its hand-tinted portrayal of painterly dream worlds, often inhabited by nude or semi-nude figures surrounded by bare plaster walls or painted backdrops. He frequently re-uses elements (for instance, a clouded sky or a view of Prague's Charles Bridge). In this his photographs suggest the studio and tableaux works of mid-19th century erotic photographers, as well as the works of the 20th- century painter Balthus, and of Bernard Faucon. Saudek's early art photography is noted for its evocation of childhood. His later works often portrayed the evolution from child to adult (re-photographing the same composition/pose, and with the same subjects, over many years). Religious motifs and the ambiguity between man and woman have also been some of Saudek's recurring themes. During the 1990s, his work at times generated censorship attempts in the West because of its provocative sexual content. Saudek's imagery has sometimes had a mixed reception internationally. He gained early shows in 1969 and 1970 in the United States and in Australia. In 1970 his work was shown at the Australian Centre for Photography and was welcomed by curator Jennie Boddington at the National Gallery of Victoria. Decades later, by contrast, his photograph Black Sheep & White Crow, which features a semi-naked pre-pubescent girl, was removed from the Ballarat International Foto Biennale in Victoria, Australia just before the opening on 21 August 2011; objections had been made related to allegations of child prostitution for his subject.Photo withdrawn after child prostitution claim, The Age Saudek's photographs have been featured as covers for the albums of Anorexia Nervosa (New Obscurantis Order), Soul Asylum (Grave Dancers Union), Daniel Lanois (For the Beauty of Wynona), Rorschach (Remain Sedate), and Beautiful South (Welcome to the Beautiful South).

Large parts of it were built on the former right-of- way of the Overseas Railroad, the Key West Extension of the Florida East Coast Railway. Completed in 1912, the Overseas Railroad was heavily damaged and partially destroyed in the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. The Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the destroyed sections, so the roadbed and remaining bridges were sold to the state of Florida for $640,000. Since the 1950s the Overseas Highway has been refurbished into a main coastal highway between the cities of Miami and Key West, offering travelers an exotic roadway through a tropical savanna environment and access to the largest area of coral reefs on the U.S. mainland. Many exotic animals such as the American Alligator, American Crocodile and Key Deer inhabit the tropical islands of the Florida Keys. History SR 4A, former designation for the Overseas Highway While the Overseas Highway today runs along the former Overseas Railroad right of way, portions of the highway came into existence earlier in a different alignment while the railroad was still operational. The concept of an Overseas Highway began with the Miami Motor Club in 1921. The Florida land boom of the 1920s was underway and the club wanted to attract tourists to easily reached fishing areas, which could only be reached by boat or train at the time. The land boom also attracted real estate interests who sought vehicular access to the upper keys where there were thousands of acres of undeveloped land. The completion of the railroad further proved a highway through the keys was feasible.History of Overseas Highway Construction of the original highway next to Matecumbe railroad station Construction on the original Overseas Highway, designated State Road 4A (an extension of a route running from Miami to Homestead), lasted through most of the mid 1920s. Officially opening for traffic on January 25, 1928, the original highway existed in two segments at its greatest extent. One segment ran from the mainland via Card Sound Road to Key Largo and extended as far as Lower Matecumbe Key, while a segment in the lower keys existed from No Name Key to Key West. An automobile ferry service connected the 41 mile gap between Lower Matecumbe and No Name Keys. State Road 4A mostly ran alongside of the Overseas Railroad in the upper keys but in the lower keys, it followed a much different path than the railroad and current highway. The ferry landing on No Name Key was located at the end of what is now Watson Boulevard, which carried State Road 4A across No Name Key and Big Pine Key before it crossed to Little Torch Key. On Little Torch Key, it turned south and rejoined the railroad. It would continue along the north side of the railroad to Upper Sugarloaf Key, where it turned south and ran along the current route of County Roads 939 and 939A over Lower Sugarloaf Key and the Saddlebunch Keys. From the Saddlebunch Keys, State Road 4A crossed onto Geiger Key, continuing along what is now Geiger Road and Boca Chica Road. On Boca Chica Key, it followed the shoreline south of Naval Air Station Key West's airstrip to Boca Chica Beach before crossing to Stock Island. On Stock Island, it followed Maloney Avenue and MacDonald Avenue where it rejoined the Overseas Railroad heading into Key West. Most of the State Road 4A bridges in the Lower Keys were of wooden construction and had been in use by the early 1920s. By the early 1930s it was clear that the ferries were insufficient for the travel needs of the keys, and Monroe County and the State Road Department began making plans to connect the two portions of State Road 4A to make a continuous highway. By 1931, the ferries would also service a 13-mile road built through Marathon on the Vaca Keys with terminals at Hog and Grassy Keys. In 1933, the state legislature created the Overseas Road and Toll Bridge District to seek federal funding to extend the roadways. Funding was scarce as the country was in the midst of the Great Depression, but funding would eventually come through the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Hundreds of disgruntled World War I veterans seeking early payment of wartime pensions were employed for construction on the roadway and bridges as part of a government relief program. Eight bridge piers that would have carried the original alignment of the Overseas Highway which can be seen at Mile Marker 73. They serve as a memorial to the veterans who were killed in the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935. Construction on a bridge connecting Lower Matecumbe Key and Long Key was already underway when the Category 5 Labor Day Hurricane struck Islamorada on September 2, 1935. The hurricane caused widespread damage throughout the area and destroyed much of the Overseas Railroad in the upper keys. Of the over 400 fatalities from the hurricane, more than half were veterans and their families. Their deaths caused anger and charges of mismanagement that led to a Congressional investigation. Just west of Lower Matecumbe Key at Mile Marker 73 on the current highway, eight concrete bridge piers and a small dredged island are all that remains of the veterans' work. The dredged island is now known as Veteran's Key and the piers remain as a tribute to the veterans with a memorial plaque on Craig Key. Many of the railroad bridges, such as the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge, were retrofitted to accommodate automobile traffic for the Overseas Highway. These bridges were replaced by more modern bridges in the early 1980s. After the hurricane, the Florida East Coast Railway was financially unable to rebuild the damaged sections of the Overseas Railroad. Seizing a rare opportunity, the state purchased the railroad's entire right of way and remaining infrastructure for a price of $640,000. The Overseas Road and Toll Bridge District abandoned its original highway plans and made new plans to build the highway on the old rail bed from Lower Matecumbe Key to Little Torch Key, effectively connecting the two segments of State Road 4A. The railroad's bridges, which withstood the hurricane and were in good condition, were retrofitted with new two-lane wide concrete surfaces for automobile use. In the case of the Bahia Honda Rail Bridge, which was a truss bridge, the concrete road surface was built on top of the trusses. The conversion of the railroad bridges to automobile use was accomplished by Cleary Brothers Construction Co. of West Palm Beach, and the entire route to Key West was opened to the public in 1938.Crestview, Florida, \\"To Build Highway\\", Okaloosa News-Journal, Friday May 1, 1942, Volume 28, Number 15, page 5. Portions of the road were tolled until April 15, 1954; toll booths were located on Big Pine Key and Lower Matecumbe Key. Pigeon Key, roughly the midway point of the Seven Mile Bridge, served as the headquarters for the \\"Overseas Road and Toll District.\\" The toll for automobiles was $1, plus 25 cents per passenger. The full highway from the mainland to Key West was officially opened for traffic on March 29, 1938 and upon completion, the route became the southernmost segment of U.S. Highway 1, which previously terminated in Miami (State Road 4A would remain as a hidden designation until the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering, when the hidden designation became State Road 5). President Franklin D. Roosevelt toured the road in 1939. The beginning of U.S. 1 in March 1951; U.S. 1 has since been extended to the Monroe County Courthouse in downtown Key West At this time, the Overseas Highway only ran along the old railroad route in the middle keys; the original highway segments were still in use in the upper and lower keys. As the United States entered into World War II, the U.S. Navy sought improvements to the highway to improve their access from the Naval Air Station on Boca Chica Key to the mainland for national security purposes. The 1920s-era lower keys segment was less than ideal with its winding road and rickety wooden bridges. This resulted in completing the rest of the highway throughout the keys on the former railroad right of way, which the state already owned and was a more direct route with smoother curves that would allow for higher speeds. Also included in this project was the construction of the highway from Florida City to Key Largo on the old railroad route via Jewfish Creek, which shortened the route from Key Largo to the mainland by 17 miles. The new alignments were officially completed on May 16, 1944, with Florida Governor Spessard Holland presiding over ribbon-cutting ceremonies. The original Card Sound Bridge was closed after the Jewfish Creek alignment opened, and its remains were subsequently destroyed by a fire (the Card Sound route would be restored as a secondary route in 1969 with the opening of the current bridge). Today, some segments of the original highway remain as side and frontage roads for the current highway. Seven Mile Bridge, the longest bridge on the Overseas Highway. The original span crosses over Pigeon Key. The original highway through Key Largo and Tavernier would once again become part of the Overseas Highway in the early 1970s when it was expanded to a four-lane divided highway. Here, the northbound lanes run along the route of the original highway and the southbound lanes along the route of the railroad, which is especially evident in area where the route splits into two one-way streets. The widening was the beginning of a much larger project to rebuild much of the Overseas Highway, which included replacing the aging repurposed railroad bridges with more modern bridges; some of which are able to accommodate more than two lanes of traffic. This included the Seven Mile Bridge, the Bahia Honda Bridge and the Long Key Bridge (although these three original bridges are no longer open to vehicular traffic, except for part of Seven Mile Bridge, they became listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and are currently used as fishing piers). The more modern bridges were completed in the early 1980s. In recent years, Pigeon Key was used by the University of Miami as an oceanography laboratory, but current efforts to restore the buildings on the island have resulted in the establishment of a railroad museum there. The newer Seven Mile Bridge does not have direct access to Pigeon Key; people going there must walk on of the original Seven Mile Bridge from its northern end on Knight's Key, take a shuttle bus, or take a boat ride to reach the island. Mile markers Locations along the Overseas Highway from Key West to Key Largo are commonly given as mile markers. The Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) maintains mile marker signs every mile along the highway. Numbering starts in Key West, and increases towards the east and northeast up the path of the highway over the keys. Businesses along the highway began listing their locations by mile markers, adding decimal parts to more precisely indicate locations between mile marker signs. Outside of Key West and the city of Marathon, street addresses along the highway are based on the mile markers, using a four- to six-digit number (with no decimal point); the numbering pattern is as follows: *The first three (or four) digits denote the approximate mile marker; the first two (or three) digits denote the mile while the last digit denotes the nearest 0.1 (tenth of a mile) *The last two digits denote a particular address; an even digit denotes an address on the Atlantic Ocean side while an odd digit denotes an address on the Florida Bay/Gulf of Mexico side As an example, the Tropical Research Laboratory of Mote Marine Laboratory has a physical address of 24244 Overseas Highway. The first three digits indicate that it is near mile marker 24.2 (corresponding to an address on Summerland Key), while the last two digits indicate that it is located on the Atlantic Ocean side of the highway. Trail In 2001, the Monroe County Commission, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection's Office of Greenways and Trails, and FDOT entered into a Memorandum of understanding to create the Florida Keys Overseas Heritage Trail (FKOHT). The trail will be a multi-use bicycle and pedestrian facility that will traverse the Florida Keys from Key Largo to Key West. Upon completion, the FKOHT will include an integrated system of educational kiosks, roadside picnic areas, scenic overlooks, fishing piers, water access points, and bicycle and jogging paths. The development of the trail will provide a mechanism for the preservation and use of the historic Flagler Railroad Bridges, 23 of which still exist and are mostly intact. Several alternatives exist for trail alignment, including cutting down the , 1940s-era roadway to its original spandrel width, or using the roadway as is, particularly in multi-use areas. In all cases, original bridgework will be repaired or rebuilt, and the breaks created during the 1980s and 1990s fishing pier conversion will be reconnected. Where the original roadway no longer exists, the trail will be temporarily cantilevered on the side of the current US 1 highway bridge, until new trail bridge sections can be built. The new sections will be built to match the historical character of the original bridges. In popular culture One of animated television's Wacky Races was The Overseas Hi-Way Race, which first aired on December 28, 1968, on CBS, covering the entire actual route from Key Largo to Key West. While Long Key was correctly portrayed, most of the other in-between keys were given fictional names, and Sombrero Key was actually five miles south of the highway in open water, according to the Florida Keys‚ÄìEast map. The Overseas Highway is depicted in a screenprint by American artist Ralston Crawford.Overseas Highway Whitney Museum of American Art. An action scene involving a car and fighter jet was filmed on a portion of the old Seven Mile Bridge for the 1994 James Cameron film True Lies. No part of the bridge was destroyed during filming; instead, an 80-foot model of the bridge built off Sugarloaf Key was blown up instead. http://articles.sun- sentinel.com/1994-08-07/travel/9408020385_1_lower-keys-seven-mile-bridge-keys- bound Major intersections Mileposts are taken from US 1, which begins approximately south at an intersection with Whitehead and Fleming streets in Key West.

The volume of the container follows the quantity of stored gas, with pressure coming from the weight of a movable cap. Typical volumes for large gas holders are about , with diameter structures. Gas holders now tend to be used for balancing purposes, to ensure that gas pipes can be operated within a safe range of pressures, rather than for actually storing gas for later use.  Etymology  Antoine Lavoisier devised the first gas holder, which he called a gazom√®tre, to assist his work in pneumatic chemistry. It enabled him to weigh the gas in a pneumatic trough with the precision he required. He published his Trait√© √âl√©mentaire de Chimie in 1789. James Watt Junior collaborated with Thomas Beddoes in constructing the pneumatic apparatus, a shortlived piece of medical equipment that incorporated a gazom√®tre. Watt then adapted the gazom√®tre for coal gas storage. The anglicisation \\"gasometer\\" was adopted by William Murdoch, the inventor of gas lighting, in 1782, as the name for his gas holders. Murdoch's associates objected that his \\"gasometer\\" was not a meter but a container, but the name was retained and came into general use. Gas holders were marked as gasometers on the large-scale maps issued by the British Ordnance Survey and term came to be used to label gas works, even though there may be several gas holders at any one gas works. However, the term \\"gasometer\\" is still discouraged for use in technical circles, where \\"gas holder\\" is preferred. The spelling \\"gas holder\\" is used by the BBC, among other institutions, but the variant \\"gasholder\\" is more commonly used. The meter used to measure the flow of gas through a particular pipe is a gas meter.  History  A two-lift braced column-supported gas holder in West Ham, East London Before the mid-20th century coal gas was produced in retorts by heating coal in the absence of air, the process being known as coal gasification. Coal gas was first used for municipal lighting, the gas being passed through wooden or metal pipes from the retort to the lantern. The first public piped gas supply was to thirteen gas lamps installed along the length of Pall Mall, London, in 1807. The credit for this installation goes to the German inventor and entrepreneur Fredrick Winsor. Digging up streets to lay pipes required legislation, and this delayed both further installation of street lighting, and the installation of gas for domestic illumination, heating and cooking. Many people experimented with coal distillation to produce a flammable gas, including Jean Tardin (1618), Clayton (1684) Jean- Pierre Minckelers, Leuven (1785) and Pickel (D)(1786). William Murdoch was successful. He joined Boulton and Watt, at the Soho manufactory in Birmingham in 1777, and in 1792 he built a retort to heat coal to produce the gas that illuminated his home and office in Redruth. His system lacked a storage method until James Watt Junior adapted a Lavoisier gazom√®tre for this purpose. A gasometer was incorporated into the first small gasworks built for the Soho manufactory in 1798. William Murdoch and his pupil Samuel Clegg went on to instal retorts in individual factories and other workplaces. The earliest was in 1805, at Lee & Phillips, Salford Twist Mill, where eight gas holders were installed. This was shortly followed by one in Sowerby Bridge, constructed by Clegg for Henry Lodge. The first independent commercial gas works was built by the London and Westminster Gas Light and Coke Company in Great Peter Street, Westminster, in 1812, with wooden pipes laid to gas lights on Westminster Bridge on New Year's Eve in 1813. Public gas lights were seen as a means to reduce crime and until the 1840s they were regulated by police authorities. Because of safety concerns expressed by the Royal Society the size of gas holders was limited to and they were enclosed in gasometer houses. In fact any small leak from an enclosed gas holder created a potentially explosive build- up of air and gas within the building, presenting a far greater danger, and the practice was discontinued in the UK. In the United States, however, where gas needed to be protected from much more extreme weather, gasometer houses continued to be built and were architecturally decorative. The telescopic gas holder was first invented in 1824. The cup and dip (grip) seal was patented by Hutchinson in 1833, and the first working example was built in Leeds. Gas holders were then built all around the UK in great numbers from the 1850s. The first were the two-lift column-supported type; later they could have four lifts, being frame-guided, and they could be retrofitted with an additional flying lift. The large gas holders at Kings Cross, London, were built in the 1860s. William Gadd of Gadd & Mason in Manchester invented the spirally guided gas holder in 1890. Instead of external columns or guide frames, his design operated with spiral rails. The first commercial design was built in Northwich, Cheshire, in the same year. By the end of the 19th century most towns in Britain had their own gas works and gas holders. The years between the two world wars were marked by improvements in storage, especially the waterless gas holder, and in distribution, with the advent of steel pipes to convey gas at up to as feeder mains to the traditional cast-iron pipes. Municipal gas works became superfluous in the later 20th century, but gas holders and production plant were still in use in steel works in 2016.  Function  A gas holder provided storage for purified, metered gas. It acted as a buffer, removing the need for continuous gas production. The weight of the gas holder lift (cap) controlled the pressure of the gas in the mains and provided back pressure for the gas-making plant. Gas holders hold a large advantage over other methods of storage. They are the only storage method that keeps gas at district pressure (the pressure required in local gas mains). Once the district low pressure switch falls and the booster fans come on, the gas in these holders can be at homes, being used, in a very short period of time. Gas is stored in the holder throughout the day, when little gas is being used. At about 5 p.m. there is a rise in demand for gas and the holder comes down. Types There are two basic types of gas holder: the water-sealed and the rigid waterless. The water-sealed gas holder consists of a tank of water that rises and falls to take the gas. A watered gas holder consisted of two parts: a deep tank of water used to provide a seal, and a closed vessel (the lift) that rises above the water as the gas volume increased. Rigid waterless gas holders were a very early design that neither expanded or contracted. There are modern versions of the waterless gas holder, e.g. oil-sealed, grease-sealed and \\"dry seal\\" (membrane) types. They consist of a fixed cylinder capped by a moving piston.  Water-sealed gas holders  Gas holder schematic The tank with an internal cone, or dumpling The earliest Boulton and Watt gas holders had a single lift. The tank was above ground and was lined with wood; the lift was guided by tripods and cables. Pulleys and weights were supplied to regulate the gas pressure. Brick tanks were introduced in 1818, when a gas holder would have a capacity of . The engineer John Malam devised a tank with a central rod-and-tube guide system. Telescoping holders fall into two subcategories. The earlier of the telescoping variety were column-guided variations and were built from 1824. To guide the telescoping walls, or \\"lifts\\", they have an external fixed frame, visible at a fixed height at all times. A refinement was the guide frame gas holder, where the heavy columns were replaced by a lighter and more extensive framework. Vertical girders (standards) were intersected by horizontal girders and cross-braced. This could be bolted onto an underground or above-ground tank. The Cutler patented guide frame dispensed with the horizontal girders using diagonal triangulated framing instead. Cable-guided gas holders, invented by Pease in 1880, had a limited use, but were useful on unstable ground where the rigid systems could buckle and jam the lift. Spiral-guided gas holders were built in the UK from 1890 until 1983. These have no frame, and each lift is guided by the one below, rotating as it goes up as dictated by helical runners. Both telescoping types use the manometric property of water to provide a seal. The whole tank floats in a circular or annular water reservoir, held up by the roughly constant pressure of a varying volume of gas, the pressure determined by the weight of the structure, and the water providing the seal for the gas within the moving walls. Besides storing the gas, the tank's design serves to establish the pressure of the gas system. With telescoping (multiple-lift) tanks, the innermost tank has an approximately lip around the outside of the bottom edge, called a cup, which picks up water as it rises above the reservoir water level. This immediately engages a downward lip on the inner rim of the next outer lift, called a dip or grip, and as this grip sinks into the cup, it preserves the water seal as the inner tank continues to rise until the grip grounds on the cup, whereupon further injection of gas will start to raise that lift as well. Holders were built with as many as four lifts. An extra flying lift could be retrofitted into column or frame gas holders. This was an additional inner tank that extended above the standards, when the infrastructure would support the extra shear forces and weight. Though not exclusively, spiral guides were used.

Dry-seal-type gas holder  A dry-seal Wiggins- type gas holder Dry-seal gas holders have a static cylindrical shell, within which a piston rises and falls. As it moves, a grease seal, tar/oil seal or a sealing membrane which is rolled out and in from the piston keeps the gas from escaping. The MAN (Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-N√ºrnberg AG) was introduced in 1915: it was polygonal and used a tar/oil seal. The Klonne dry seal gas holder was circular: it used a grease seal. The Dry-seal Wiggins gas holder was patented in 1952: it used a flexible curtain that was suspended from the piston. The largest low-pressure gas holders built was the Klonne gas holder built in 1938 in Gelsenkirchen. It was high and in diameter, which gave it a capacity of . There was a MAN type, built in 1934 in Chicago with a capacity of .  By location = Europe  The pollution associated with gasworks and gas storage makes the land difficult to reclaim for other purposes, but some gas holders, notably in Vienna, have been converted into other uses such as living space and a shopping mall and historical archives for the city. Many sites, however, were never used for the production of 'town gas', therefore the land contamination is relatively low. Gas holders have been a major part of the skylines of low-rise British cities for up to 200 years, due to their large distinctive shape and central location. They were originally used for balancing daily demand and generation of town gas. With the move to natural gas and construction of the national grid pipework, their use steadily diminished as the pipe network could both store gas under pressure, and eventually satisfy peak demand directly. London, Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, Leeds, Newcastle, Salisbury and Glasgow (which has the largest gasometers in the UK) are noted for having many gas holders. Some of these gas holders have become listed buildings. The gas holders behind King's Cross station in London were specially dismantled when the new Channel Tunnel Rail Link was being created, with Gas holder No 8 being re-erected on a nearby site behind St Pancras station as part of a housing development. It has been fashioned into a park. Most gas holders are no longer used, and a program of dismantling is underway to release the land for reuse. A gasworks in South Lotts, Dublin, Ireland, was converted into apartments. In the past, holder stations would have an operator living on site controlling their movement. However, with the process control systems now used on these sites, such an operator is obsolete. The tallest gasometer in Europe is tall and is located in Oberhausen. In the UK as well as other European countries, a movement to preserve classic gasometers has emerged in recent years, especially after Britain's National Grid announced in 2013 their plans to remove 76 gas holders, and soon afterwards, Southern and Scottish Gas networks announced that they would demolish 111 others. Christopher Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society, a leader in the campaign to preserve the gasometers said: The gasholder in Amsterdam is notable for its Awakenings techno parties.

The most notable of these were erected in St. Louis by the Laclede Gas Light Company in the early 20th century. These gasometers remained in use until the early first decade of the 21st century, when the last one was decommissioned and abandoned in place. The most recently used gasometer in the United States was on the southeast side of Indianapolis, but it has been demolished along with adjoining the Citizens Energy Group coke plant. Another pair of holders at the Newtown Holder Station, in Elmhurst, Queens, in New York City, was a popular landmark for traffic reporters until they were demolished in 1996 and became Elmhurst Park. The demolition of two larger \\"Maspeth Tanks\\" in nearby Greenpoint, Brooklyn, was described by The New York Times at length. A large MAN-type gas holder was erected just east of Baltimore, Maryland, by Koppers Inc. in 1949 and operated by Baltimore Gas and Electric for 32 years. The , structure, which could hold , was a landmark due to its unusual marking scheme, which had a red-and-white checkerboard pattern from up. The structure was demolished in July 1984. As of 2019, efforts were under way to save a gas holder building in Concord, New Hampshire. It is unusual because the cap is still in place.Concord Monitor: \\"Collapse of entrance roof at historic gasholder building reflects its problems\\" (March 29, 2016Concord Monitor: \\"Gasholder future still uncertain\\" (Jan. 6, 2019) PG&E; operated gas holders at its gasification plants in California before natural gas pipelines were built. The San Francisco Beach Street Plant was built in 1899. The gas plant operated until 1931, but its associated gas holder was used with natural gas into the 1950s, when the property was redeveloped. Gas holders also previously existed at Chico (demolished 1951), Daly City, Eureka, Fresno, Merced, Monterey, Oakland, Redding (gas holder demolished early 1960s), Redwood City (gas holder built early 1900s, demolished 1959), Salinas, San Francisco Potrero Plant, Santa Rosa, St. Helena, Stockton, Vallejo, Willows; and likely existed at their other gasification plants in Colusa, Hollister, Lodi, Madera, Marysville, Modesto, Napa, Oakdale, Oroville, Red Bluff, Sacramento, San Luis Obispo, Santa Cruz, Selma, Tracy, Turlock, Watsonville and Woodland.  Australia  Gasometer and Arden St Oval, North Melbourne, in 1928 Gasholders, though once common, have become rare in Australia. Most gasworks within the country were demolished or repurposed, and few gasometers remain because of this. A good example of a largely intact gasometer is located at the Launceston Gasworks site in Tasmania. Though the gas bell has been removed, all other components are intact. The remains of two older 1860s gasometers are also visible on site but only the foundations remain. Gasworks Newstead is a commercial, residential, and retail development adjoining the river at Newstead, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, opening in 2013, built around a now heritage listed 1887 gas holder. Only the frame remains, inside of which is a plaza used as a public recreation zone and for occasional special events such as markets or concerts. At dusk each day a dynamic lighting display illuminates the frame. The former industrial site on the inner-city fringe became an urban renewal zone for upmarket housing centred on the Gasworks zone. For many years, a huge gasholder towered over the Arden Street Oval, the home ground of the North Melbourne Football Club in the Victorian Football League. Television coverage of Australian Rules football matches played at the famous ground showed the gasholder dominating the landscape. It was demolished in late 1977/early 1978.  Other storage systems  Gas more recently was stored in large underground reservoirs such as salt caverns. In modern times, however, line-packing is the preferred method. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s it was thought that gas holders could be replaced with high-pressure bullets (a cylindrical pressure vessel with hemispherical ends). However, regulations brought in meant that all new bullets must be built several miles out of towns and cities, and the security of storing large amounts of high-pressure natural gas above ground made them unpopular with local people and councils. Bullets are gradually being decommissioned. It is also possible to store natural gas in liquid form, and this is widely practised throughout the world.

History The society was founded in 1845 at Trenton by intellectual and business leaders of New Jersey including Joseph C. Hornblower, Robert Gibbon Johnson, Peter D. Vroom and William Whitehead. In 1846, the society relocated to Newark and has been there ever since. Its original headquarters in Newark were located on Market Street. In 1931 it left Downtown Newark for a large colonial-style building partially paid for by Louis Bamberger at 230 Broadway, east of Branch Brook Park. In 1997 the Historical Society returned downtown, to 52 Park Place, on Military Park. The new home is a Georgian style building vacated by the Essex Club that was designed by Guilbert & Betelle. The building was built in 1926 and had been added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1991. In its first year in the downtown location visits increased almost fivefold.

H√≥lar Agricultural College was founded 1882, and was renamed Holar University College in 2003.H√≥lar universitetsh√∏yskole (H√≥lar University College) Monument of bishop Gu√∞mundur Arason  History  Near the end of the 10th century, King Olaf I of Norway convinced his subjects to accept Christianity, then sent Christian missionaries to Iceland, where they were quickly accepted; around 1000 Icelanders made a peaceful decision that all should convert. Despite this, the godar, Iceland's ruling class, maintained their power. Some built their own churches; others were ordained. Holar was the Episcopal see for northern Iceland (whereas Sk√°lholt served the same function for southern Iceland), and a cultural and educational centre for almost seven centuries (1106-1798). It was founded as a diocese in 1106 by bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson and soon became one of Iceland's two main centers of learning. It played an important part in the medieval politics of Iceland, and was the seat of Gu√∞mundur Arason in his struggle with Icelandic chieftains during the time of the commonwealth. Under J√≥n Arason, H√≥lar was the last remaining stronghold of Catholicism in Iceland during the Reformation. The religious conflict was brutally resolved in 1550 when the last Catholic bishop, J√≥n Arason, was taken to the south of Iceland and beheaded, with his two sons, in Sk√°lholt. The best known Lutheran bishop of H√≥lar was Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson. The construction of the present church is believed to have been completed in 1763.

It is the largest park in Estonia and one of Europe's biggest national parks. Its charter calls for the preservation, research and promotion of North-Estonian landscapes, ecosystems, biodiversity and national heritage. History The name Lahemaa originates from the most thoroughly studied and visited part of the North Estonian coast, where four large peninsulas (Juminda, P√§rispea, K√§smu and Vergi) are separated from each other by four bays (Kolga, Hara, Eru and K√§smu). Lahemaa translates roughly as \\"Land of Bays\\". The national park, established in 1971, is one of the main tourism drawcards in Estonia. Several companies offer day tour packages from Tallinn, while many people drive themselves. Viru Bog in winter With forests covering more than 70 percent of Lahemaa, the area is rich in flora and fauna. The landscape has many raised bogs, including the 7,000-year- old Laukasoo Reserve. The park, marked by several trails, teems with wildlife, including a population of boar, red deer, wolves, bear and lynx.

In addition to a solo career, he was a member of the hip hop group Fila Fresh Crew and later collaborated with gangsta rap group N.W.A‚Äìwhere he co-wrote many of their releases‚Äìas well as Eazy-E's solo debut album Eazy-Duz-It. He has also worked with Dr. Dre, co-writing his solo debut album, while Dre produced Curry's solo debut album, released by Ruthless Records. He was one of the founders of Death Row Records along with Dr. Dre and Suge Knight. After Fila Fresh Crew split up in 1988, The D.O.C. went on to pursue a successful solo career. In 1989, he released his debut album, No One Can Do It Better, which reached number-one on the US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart for two weeks and spawned two number one hits on the Hot Rap Songs chart: \\"It's Funky Enough\\" and \\"The D.O.C. & The Doctor\\". The album went platinum five years after its release. In late 1989, months after the release of No One Can Do It Better, The D.O.C. suffered a serious car crash that resulted in the crushing of his larynx, permanently changing his voice. Since his recovery, he has released two more albums, Helter Skelter in 1996 and Deuce in 2003. Early life and education Tracy Lynn Curry was born on June 10, 1968 in Dallas, Texas. As a teenager, Curry began his career as a member of Fila Fresh Crew, a hip hop trio that originated in Dallas, Texas. While in the group, Curry was known as Doc-T. Fila Fresh Crew In 1987, Fila Fresh Crew had four songs featured on the compilation album N.W.A and the Posse which featured various other artists; the same four tracks would later appear on the group's album Tuffest Man Alive, which was released in 1988. Though the album would produce three singles, the group disbanded not long after its release. By this point, Curry had moved to Los Angeles and become acquainted with members of N.W.A and Ruthless Records. Ruthless Records and No One Can Do It Better Curry would begin using the name The D.O.C. after he was signed to Eazy-E's Ruthless Records. The D.O.C. contributed lyrics to N.W.A's debut studio album, Straight Outta Compton, and performed the opening verse on \\"Parental Discretion Iz Advised\\". Curry also wrote for Eazy-E's debut studio album, Eazy-Duz-It and co-wrote \\"Keep Watchin'\\" from Michel'le's self-titled debut album. In 1989, The D.O.C. released his solo debut, the Dr. Dre-produced No One Can Do It Better. The album was very well received by critics, and sold well, peaking at no. 20 on the Billboard 200 for two consecutive weeks; by 1994, the album reached Platinum status. Allmusic gives the album a five-star rating and describes it as \\"an early landmark of West Coast Rap\\" as well as \\"an undeniable masterpiece\\". No One Can Do It Better produced five singles and four music videos. Automobile accident and move to Death Row In November 1989, five months after the release of No One Can Do It Better, Curry was involved in a near-fatal car crash. Driving home from a party, he fell asleep at the wheel and his car veered off the freeway. Curry, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown out the rear window, slamming face-first into a tree. His injuries required 21 hours of plastic surgery, and he spent 2¬Ω weeks in the hospital. He could not speak for about a month, and he was left with a different, raspier voice. The D.O.C. continued to write for N.W.A and contributed lyrics and minor vocals to their 1990 EP 100 Miles and Runnin', where he co-wrote all the songs except for \\"Just Don't Bite It\\" and \\"Kamurshol\\", and their final album Niggaz4Life. In 1991, The D.O.C left Ruthless Records along with Dr. Dre and Michel'le to sign with newly founded Death Row Records. Dr. Dre also used his talents as one of the writers for his debut solo album The Chronic, contributing to the tracks \\"Lil' Ghetto Boy\\", \\"A Nigga Witta Gun\\", and \\"Bitches Ain't Shit\\". He also appeared on the skit track \\"The $20 Sack Pyramid\\". He is referenced by name in \\"Nuthin' but a G Thang\\", and appears in the song's video as well. The liner notes to The Chronic say, \\"I want to give a special shout out to The D.O.C. for talking me into doin' this album.\\" His name is mentioned by Snoop Dogg in the intro of the album. (\\"Peace to da D.O.C., still makin' it funky enough\\"). In addition to The Chronic, The D.O.C. worked on Snoop Dogg's debut album Doggystyle, and added some vocals on the song \\"Serial Killa\\". The D.O.C. continued to be a ghostwriter for various songs on Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg albums. \\"Real Muthaphuckkin G's\\", from Eazy-E's 1993 extended play It's On (Dr. Dre) 187um Killa, includes lyrics sampled from \\"It's Funky Enough\\" in the song's hook. Feud with Dr. Dre and Helter Skelter In 1996, The D.O.C attempted a comeback following the car crash which severely damaged his vocal cords. The album, titled Helter Skelter, produced two singles with music videos. Helter Skelter was widely ignored and even somewhat discredited by The D.O.C himself. The name of the album is a reference to Charles Manson's idea of The Beatles' \\"Helter Skelter\\" prophesying the end of the world. The title and concept behind this album were originally developed by Dr. Dre as a collaborative effort between him and Ice Cube, titled Heltah Skeltah. At that time, however, The D.O.C. had become disillusioned with Death Row Records and Dre, having received no payment for his work ghostwriting at Death Row. So in late 1994, D.O.C. decided to leave Death Row and headed to Atlanta. Taking lyrics he had already written for Heltah Skeltah, he recorded Helter Skelter, keeping the name to spite Dre. His lyrics were inspired by the writings of Milton William Cooper. Especially noticeable in songs Secret Plan and Welcome to the New World. Silverback Records and Deuce In 1997, The D.O.C. founded his own Dallas-based record label, Silverback Records. The D.O.C. introduced Dallas rapper 6Two to Dre, who featured him on his 1999 comeback album 2001; Curry and also provided lyrics for the album. On July 20, 2000, The D.O.C. appeared on stage with Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg at The Centrum in Worcester, Massachusetts during the Up in Smoke Tour. In 2003, The D.O.C released his third album entitled Deuce on Silverback Records. The album was originally meant to be a 6Two album, completely produced by Dr. Dre and released through Aftermath Entertainment. However, D.O.C. and Dre argued over whether D.O.C. should be rapping on the album. The D.O.C.'s presence on this album is minimal however, making an appearance to introduce tracks or perform in skits such as \\"My Prayer\\" and \\"Souliloquy\\". The only single released from Deuce was \\"The Shit\\", which features former-N.W.A members MC Ren and Ice Cube, along with Snoop Dogg and 6Two. Deuce focuses primarily on showcasing other artists on D.O.C.'s Silverback Records label, including U.P.-T.I.G.H.T., El Dorado, and in particular, 6Two. Later career The D.O.C. wrote lyrics for Snoop Dogg's album Tha Blue Carpet Treatment. In December 2006, The D.O.C. revealed that he was working on his fourth album, entitled Voices, and stated that it would be released after Dr. Dre's upcoming fourth album Detox, which has since been scrapped in favor of Compton. In a May 2008 interview, The D.O.C. stated that he and Dre were working on the album, explaining \\"There is an album, and you got the title, but that's also because that's the title Dre likes. Dre and I decided to do another D.O.C. album after this Detox record. We decided to do one more together and end our story the right way.\\" According to a 2009 interview, Snoop Dogg assisted The D.O.C. in seeking a voice therapist. It was found that The D.O.C.'s vocal cords are not irreparably severed or crushed, and that his voice could still be surgically restored by up to 70%. After the release of the biopic Straight Outta Compton, the D.O.C. revealed that his natural voice had returned if he had concentrated, and that he recorded new music, although he was not ready to release anything yet. Although he is not mentioned in the songwriting credits, the D.O.C. claimed that he helped write Dr. Dre's third album Compton. Media appearances *The song \\"It's Funky Enough\\" has appeared on popular video games Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, True Crime: Streets of LA and Madden 2005.

Public-access television was created in the United States between 1969 and 1971 by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and has since been mandated under the Cable Communications Act of 1984, which is codified under 47 USC ¬ß 531. PEG channels consist of: # Public-access televisionGenerally quite free of editorial control, a form of non-commercial mass media where ordinary people can create television programming content which is transmitted through cable TV The channels are reserved free or at a minimal cost. The local origination television content revolves primarily around community interest, developed by individuals and nonprofit organizations. # Educational-access televisionIs distance education, a curated form of educational television, it is a synchronous learning educational technology unique to cable television systems and transmit instructional television, on Time Warner Cable channel 21, programming within city limits. Educational-access channels are generally reserved for educational purposes and are not for government-access or public- access television. Many schools have adapted educational access channels to enhance school curriculum. Some schools have done this better than others. Although the use of television in schools can be traced to those schools serving the bedroom communities of Manhattan in the 1960s, where executives and technicians of early television lived, the creation of PEG channels expanded the value of television as a school or community resource. Students produced and aired community stories in part to serve community stakeholders and in part to engage in active learning. These schools developed school-based community television as a storytelling laboratory. # Government-access televisionCable channel capacity for the local government bodies and other legislative entities to access the cable systems to televise public affairs and other civic meetings. Government channels are generally reserved for government purposes and not for education-access or public-access television. # Leased accessCable television channels that are similar to commercial television where a fee is paid-for-services of reserved channel time. # Municipal-access televisionor \\"Community Access television\\" are ambiguous terms that usually refer to a channel space assigned on a Cable TV System intended to provide the content to all or some of the above listed access channels, and may contain other \\"access\\" programming such as \\"religious access\\" or the TV programming of a local institution, such as a college or a library. These channels are usually created as cost saving measures for the Cable TV company if their franchises or governing authorities allow it. # Hybrid Often, one channel will take on the role of another channel type on a regular basis. An example of this would be a college with a strong television production curriculum assumes the roles of educational access and public access. Beyond the typical curated educational access programming, a public access television element would be added where public access television producers would make shows using college owned ( or shared) equipment and college students as crew. This can be very beneficial to both entities, as the students earn credits for the work while contributing to the public access channel. However, difficulties can arise when the programming made for public access is of a type that does not reflect the values or tastes of the supporting college, and in such situations, colleges often make the decision to downplay or abandon the public access element of the channel, depending on how much funding is earned by assuming the public access television duties. The channel numbering, signal quality, and tier location of these channels are usually negotiated with a local authority, but often, these choices are made with the intention of one or more of the parties involved to marginalize one channel and emphasize another, such as placing Government access on channel 3 or 10, Educational access on a channel numerically near a PBS station, and Public Access in the high 90's or higher on a digital-only service tier. Various Cable TV companies have marginalized PEG programming in other ways, such as moving some or all of them to a sub-menu on the cable box, giving subscribers limited bandwidth access (and limited picture quality) to the channel, while also separating the PEG channels from the commercial channel lineup in an effort to fulfill their franchise obligations while discouraging the channels use, and hopefully eliminate the PEG channels that have the least political power.. In the United States, the state of California has taken over the franchising of cable television, but left the regulation of PEG to the local government.

The building was completed in 1931 after three stages of construction. It was built exclusively for the Sun Life Insurance Company. Although the then-new head office of the Royal Bank of Canada at 360 Saint Jacques Street in Montreal was taller by several floors, the Sun Life Building was at the time the largest building in square footage anywhere in the British Empire. The Sun Life Building went through three different stages of construction, the first one starting as early as 1913, but it was not until 1931 that its main 24-storey tower was erected, thus completing the project.  Construction  Building in 1948 The stages of construction were as follows: * 1913‚Äì1918: 7-story southern part of base; * 1923‚Äì1926: extension of base eastward and northward; and * 1929‚Äì1931: 16-story set-back tower. Today, the \\"Sun Life\\" is Montreal's 17th tallest building and stands in the middle of the central business district centred on Dorchester Square, dwarfed by neighbouring Place Ville-Marie and the nearby CIBC building. Previous structure The first Sun Life Building, designed by Buffalo architect Richard Waite, was built in 1889 and expanded by Robert Findlay in 1890. The red brick building was home to Sun Life until 1913, when the company moved to the first stage of the newer building. Operation Fish During the Second World War, during Operation Fish, Britain's gold reserves and negotiable foreign securities were secretly packed in crates labelled 'Fish' and shipped across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada. The securities, arriving at Halifax on July 1, 1940, were locked in an underground vault three stories beneath the Sun Life Building, guarded around the clock by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The gold was shipped on to Ottawa. The extremely secretive United Kingdom Security Deposit, operating in the vault, arranged for the sale of Britain's negotiable securities on the New York Stock Exchange over the next few years to pay for Britain's war expenses. The 5,000 Sun Life employees never knew what was stored away beneath them.

A stotra can be a prayer, a description, or a conversation, but always with a poetic structure. It may be a simple poem expressing praise and personal devotion to a deity for example, or poems with embedded spiritual and philosophical doctrines. Many stotra hymns praise aspects of the divine, such as Devi, Shiva, or Vishnu. Relating to word \\"stuti\\", coming from the same Sanskrit root *stu- (\\"to praise\\"), and basically both mean \\"praise\\". Notable stotras are Shiva Tandava Stotram in praise of Shiva and Rama Raksha Stotra, a prayer for protection to Rama. Stotras are a type of popular devotional literature. Among the early texts with Stotras are by Kuresha, which combine Ramanuja's Vedantic ideas on qualified monism about Atman and Brahman (ultimate, unchanging reality), with temple practices. Etymology Stotra comes from the Sanskrit root stu- which means \\"to praise, eulogize or laud\\". Literally, the term refers to \\"poems of praise\\". The earliest trace of Stotras are Vedic, particularly in the Samaveda. Example A seated Ardhanarishvara with both the vahanas The following is a Peterson translation of a Stotra by the Tamil poet Appar for Ardhanarishvara, the Hindu concept of a god who incorporates both the masculine and the feminine as inseparable halves.

Early career Labine was born in Jacksonville, Florida on June 28, 1934. She attended the University of Kentucky where her major was journalism, but later she switched to playwriting major at Columbia University's School of Dramatic Arts (now Columbia University School of the Arts). After graduating, she joined the writing staff of Captain Kangaroo. After writing for the show for two years, she was fired in 1968. Her first foray into daytime was as a script writer for the CBS Daytime soap opera Where the Heart Is. After only a year at the show, she was promoted to the co-head writer in 1971. The show ended in 1973 when CBS chose to take the show off the air. Shortly after, Labine became head writer for another CBS soap, Love of Life. The ratings for the show rose, which brought them to the attention of rival network ABC. In late 1974, ABC Daytime approached Labine about creating a new soap opera. The network wanted a soap opera similar to General Hospital. Ryan's Hope was created. While writing it, Ryan's Hope won six Daytime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Writing and two Daytime Emmys for Outstanding Program. In addition to this, Labine won a Writers Guild of America Award for each year that she wrote the show. After ratings began to sag, Labine was replaced by associate head writer, Mary Ryan Munisteri. ABC asked Labine back in early 1983 when it became apparent that Munisteri was not improving the ratings. Labine was fired once again, later that year. During her absence from Ryan's Hope, Michael Brockman, former president of CBS Daytime, asked Labine to develop a new serial in 1986. Her proposal was entitled Celebration but never made it to the air. In 1987, Labine was asked by ABC to come back to Ryan's Hope. She accepted ABC's offer and remained with the show until 1989, when the show was cancelled. 1990s In 1993, Labine returned to daytime as head writer of ABC's General Hospital. She brought the show much critical acclaim, and won her seventh Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Writing for her work on the show. She chose to depart the show in early 1996. During this time, she created a proposed General Hospital spin- off, Heart and Soul, about two families, one black, one white, both show business families. The black family was three generations of jazz musicians. Next door was a theatrical family. The show was not picked up by ABC or NBC; Wendy Riche's competing Port Charles was ABC's choice instead. Labine co- wrote, with Judith Pinsker, the 1995 New York Times bestseller General Hospital tie-in novel Robin's Diary, based in the AIDS storyline between characters Stone Cates and Robin Scorpio. In 1996, Labine was offered the head writer role at As the World Turns but turned it down because she and her son Matthew Labine were trying to get HEART & SOUL [aka Union Place] on the air. \\"I had to turn it down because we were in the middle of that development. I said to Procter & Gamble, 'I am gratified by this offer, but if I have any chance at all...' I didn't think there was much chance but I thought it was worth a go to do our own show. And they were very lovely about it.\\" In late 1996, she was made head writer of ABC's One Life to Live because she had a year and a half left on her contract with ABC. She remained with the show until early 1998. 2000s Most recently, Labine had a short stint at CBS' Guiding Light. She was head writer of the show from 2000 through 2001. Labine shared the reins of GL with her children, Matthew Labine and Eleanor Labine. Rumors abounded throughout Labine's tenure at GL that she, Executive Producer Paul Rauch, and Executive in Charge of Production Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin had frequent arguments about the show's direction. At one point, it was announced in the soap press that the Labines were departing, only to have the announcement recanted a week later. P&G; did eventually replace the Labines the following year with writers Lloyd Gold and Christopher Dunn. In November 2009, Labine gave WeLoveSoaps.net an exclusive interview during which she discussed her struggles with ABC during Ryan's Hope, her enjoyment of writing General Hospital, and her less enjoyable experiences on One Life to Live and Guiding Light. She discussed details about her aborted project, Union Place, and insights into her illustrious career.

Origin The Italian honey bee is thought to originate from the continental part of Italy, south of the Alps, and north of Sicily. The subspecies may have survived the last Ice Age in Italy.Franck, P; Garnery, L.; Celebrano G.; Solignac M.; Cornuet J. Hybrid origins of honeybees from Italy (Apis mellifera ligustica) and Sicily (A. m. sicula) Article first published online: 25 December 2001; Molecular Ecology Volume 9, Issue 7, pages 907‚Äì921, July 2000 It is genetically a different subspecies than that from the Iberian peninsula and from Sicily. It is the most widely distributed of all honey bees, and has proven adaptable to most climates from subtropical to cool temperate, but it is less successful in humid tropical regions. Italian bees that originate from the Ligurian alps in northern Italy are often referred to as the Ligurian bee. Italian bees, having been conditioned to the warmer climate of the central Mediterranean, are less able to cope with the \\"hard\\" winters and cool, wet springs of more northern latitudes. They do not form such tight winter clusters. More food has to be consumed to compensate for the greater heat loss from the loose cluster. The tendency to raise broods late in autumn also increases food consumption. The noted beekeeper, Thomas White Woodbury, first introduced the Italian bee to Britain in 1859 and regarded it as vastly superior to the Old British Black bee (A. m. mellifera). Anatomy * Color: Abdomen has brown and yellow bands. Among different strains of Italian bees, there are three different colors: Leather; bright yellow (golden); and very pale yellow (Cordovan). * Size: Their bodies are smaller and their overhairs are shorter than those of the darker honeybee races. * Tongue length: 6.3 to 6.6 mm * Mean cubital index: 2.2 to 2.5 Characteristics Italian honey bees bearding outside the hive entrance Italian honey bees swarming Italian honey bee carrying pollen from flowers Brother Adam, a bee breeder and developer of the Buckfast bee, characterized the Italian bee in his book Breeding the Honeybee: While the Italian bee has many strong points, among the A.m. ligustica it has a large number of weak points: Strengths *shows strong disposition to breeding and very prolificTarpy, David R.; Lee, Jeffrey A comparison of Russian and Italian Honey bees [North Carolina State University] Extension Service *cleanliness/excellent housekeeper (which some scientists think might be a factor in disease resistance) *uses little propilis *excellent foragers *superb comb builder (writing in Switzerland in 1862, H. C. Hermann stated the comb of an Italian bee-cell occupied only 15 cells for every 16 of the common black bee, and the cubic content was larger by 30%) *covers the honey with brilliant white cappings *shows lower swarming tendency than other Western honey bee races *for areas with continuous nectar flow and favorable weather throughout the summer *industry *gentleness *a willingness to enter supers *tendency to collect flower honey rather than honey dew (of value only in countries where the colour of the honey determines the price)Brother Adam, \\"Breeding the Honeybee\\" (Northern Bee Books: Mytholmroyd, 1987), pp. 96‚Äì98. Weaknesses *lacks vitality *inclined to excessive brood rearing *susceptibility to disease *high consumption of stores *more prone to drifting and robbing than the other principal races of Europe. *the strong brood rearing disposition often results in large food consumption in late winter or early spring that causes spring dwindling and hence slow or tardy spring development *brood rearing starts late and lasts long into late summer or autumn, irrespective of nectar flow *tends to forage over shorter distances than either carnica or mellifera, and may therefore be less effective in poorer nectar flows *for cool maritime regions *for areas with strong spring flow *for areas with periods of dearth of nectar in the summer Foraging behavior A. m. ligustica are more concerned with nectar processing behaviors, honey storage, and adult maintenance over brood expansion when compared to the African honey bee, A. m. scutellata. Selective breeding Breeders of Italian bees, as well as other honey bee races, look for certain beneficial characteristics. Depending on the breeding goal, one or more of the following characteristics may be emphasized: #Gentleness or excitability #Resistance to various diseases including tracheal mite and Varroa mite #Early spring buildup in population #Wintering ability #Tendency to limited swarming #Ability to ripen honey rapidly #Honeycomb cappings are white #Minimal use of propolis #Availability and queen cost #Color Source: George Imrie's pink pages Worldwide distribution *1853 introduced to Germany *1854 introduced into the Poland by Dr. Jan Dzier≈ºon *1859 introduced into the United Kingdom *1859 introduced to the United States *1862 introduced to Australia, on 9 December into Victoria aboard the steam ship Alhambra There is strong evidence this introduction failed as the emerging Italian virgin queens hybridised with the English 'black' bee (source: Barrett, P. \\"The Immigrant Bees, 1788 to 1898\\", Vol. IV).

It was fiercely criticized when first published, but since then has gained the status of one of the most prominent works of Czech literature; in the Czech Republic, the poem is usually on must-read list for students and is said to be one of the most often published original Czech books with over 250 editions. Setting According to the author's epilogue, the poem is a homage to the beauty of spring. It is set in a bucolic landscape, inspired by such features as a lake then called Big Pond (), and now called Lake M√°cha (), after the poet. The poem's action takes place near the town of Hir≈°berg. Castles such as Bezdƒõz, Karl≈°tejn, and K≈ôivokl√°t (M√°cha was an avid walker and knew Central Bohemia intimately) also influence the setting of the poem.Marcela Sulak, \\"Introduction,\\" in Dramatis personae As a dramatic poem (in the byronic sense), the poem has a cast of characters: Vil√©m, a bandit, in love with Jarmila; Jarmila, a girl in love with Vil√©m but dishonoured by Vil√©m's father; and Hynek, the narrator. Plot A young girl, Jarmila, has been seduced by a man who is killed by his own son, Vil√©m; the latter is a robber known as the \\"terrible forest lord\\". On the evening of 1 May, sitting on a hill by a lake, she awaits his coming, but is instead told by one of Vil√©m's associates that her lover sits across the lake in a castle, to be executed for the murder. While he waits, he ponders on the beauty of nature and his young life. The next day, he is led to a hill where he is decapitated; his mangled limbs are displayed in a wheel fastened to a pillar, and his head is placed on top of the pillar. Seven years later, on 31 December, a traveler named Hynek comes across Vil√©m's pallid skull and the next day is told the story by an innkeeper. Years later, on the evening of 1 May, he returns and compares his own life to the month of May. Example Byl pozdn√≠ veƒçer ‚Äì prvn√≠ m√°j ‚Äì Veƒçern√≠ m√°j ‚Äì byl l√°sky ƒças.

Translation (artistic) Late evening, on the first of May‚Äî The twilit May‚Äîthe time of love. Meltingly called the turtle-dove, Where rich and sweet pinewoods lay. Whispered of love the mosses frail, The flowering tree as sweetly lied, The rose's fragrant sigh replied To love-songs of the nightingale. In shadowy woods the burnished lake Darkly complained a secret pain, By circling shores embraced again; And heaven's clear sun leaned down to take A road astray in azure deeps, Like burning tears the lover weeps. Structure M√°chovo jezero / Macha's lake. The poem consists of four cantos and two intermezzos. First canto The poem opens with a description of the lake and the night sky on the evening of 1 May; everything speaks of love‚Äîthe turtle-dove, whose call ends Cantos 1, 3, and 4; the silent moss; and the nightingale. Jarmila awaits her lover anxiously under an oak tree, but instead is met by a boatman, a man she knows and presumably a member of Vil√©m's gang of robbers, who tells her that her lover is to be executed and curses her for having caused his death. The turtledove, closing the canto, cries \\"Jarmila! Jarmila!! Jarmila!!!\\" Second canto Bezdƒõz Castle On the same night, the lake is described from the other side, now with images of dying stars and the pale face of the moon prevailing. Vil√©m, locked in a tower overlooking the lake, is chained to a stone table and bewails his fate. Remembering his youth, he quickly recalls how his father drove him from that joyful place \\"to grow up in the midst of thieves\\"; he became the leader of their band, and was called the \\"terrible forest lord.\\" He falls in love with a \\"wilted rose\\" and kills her seducer, not knowing it is his father. In his complaint, he claims the guilt was not his own; his curse is his father's. The clanking chains wake the prison guards, who goes to the cell and finds Vil√©m motionless and senseless at the table. Vil√©m whispers the story in the guard's ear‚Äîthe tearful guard never retells the story and \\"no one ever saw a smile / on his pale face again.\\" First intermezzo Midnight, in the countryside. A chorus of ghosts awaits the coming of a new dead soul, and especially the \\"guardian\\" of the burial site: as the author explains in a note, the last one buried stands guard over the graves at night until a newly buried person can take their place. Personified elements of the poem, such as the gale over the lake, the pillar with wheel, night, and the moon speak out on what they will contribute to the funeral. The mole under the earth, for instance, will dig his grave. This continues until the break of day. Third canto On the morning of 2 May, Vil√©m is led from his prison to the place of execution. The setting is as beautiful as the spring‚Äîthere is a sweet morning wind, and \\"every living creature celebrates young May.\\" A crowd accompanies Vil√©m to the hillock where the stake and wheel stand; many pray for him. The convict, overlooking the beauty of the landscape, bewails how he will never see Nature's bounty again and apostrophizes the clouds, and calls out to earth, whom he calls \\"my cradle and my grave, my mother / my only homeland.\\" In short order the executioner's sword flashes, the dead man's head \\"drops--bounces-- bounces again,\\" and his head and limbs are displayed on the pillar and the wheel. The canto ends with the turtledove crying \\"Vil√©m! Vil√©m!! Vil√©m!!!\\" Second intermezzo In the forest, under oak trees, Vil√©m's gang silently sits in a circle, in the middle of the night. All of nature whispers \\"Our leader's dead,\\" the forests in the distance quake and echo the complaint, \\"Our lord is dead!\\" Fourth canto On the last day of the year, a traveler, seven years after these events, comes across the knoll where the stake and wheel still display Vil√©m's bones and skull. Fleeing to the town, he asks, the next morning, about the skeleton, and his innkeeper tells him the story. Returning many years later, on 1 May, he sits on the hill; nature has awoken again and again the nightingale sings while the wind plays through the hollow skull. He sits until nightfall, meditating on Vil√©m's life as well as his own, decrying \\"humanity's lost paradise, ... my lovely childhood.\\" The poem ends with the turtledove, who \\"invites to love: / 'Hynek'!--Vil√©m!!--Jarmila!!!'\\" Rhyme and meter The basic metrical unit is the iamb, unusual for the Czech poetry at that time, and probably inspired by English romanticism, particularly by George Gordon Byron. Czech medieval and folk poetry did not yet use word stress count as an element of prosody, while their Renaissance poetry was mainly dactylic. Most of the poem rhymes in an abba pattern, and while most of the lines are tetrameters, some of the longer non-narrative lyrical descriptions consist of longer lines. Sometimes the poet uses longer dashes to indicate stops that are nonetheless part of the line, such as in the second canto, where the dripping of water measures out the convict's time: \\"zn√≠--hyne--zn√≠ a hyne-- / zn√≠--hyne--zn√≠ a hyne zas--\\" (\\"sound--die--sound and die-- / sound--die--sound and die again\\"). Reception and criticism M√°cha's grave in Prague M√°cha correctly estimates, in the opening remarks of his poem, that the poem is unlikely to be well received by his contemporaries: it \\"met with indifference and even hostility\\". Contemporary poet Josef Kajet√°n Tyl satirized M√°cha's persona in \\"Rozervanec\\", and Franti≈°ek Palack√Ω, a leading figure in the Czech National Revival, likewise criticized the poet's talent (commentary that M√°cha himself referred to in an 1835 diary entry). As with many poets, of particular interest to scholars is the relationship between M√°cha himself and his poetic work, which is \\"intensely personal, almost confessional.\\" P. 133 Roman Jakobson, for instance, published an essay called \\"Co je poesie?\\", focused on M√°cha and his M√°j, in which he \\"calls attention to the stark contrast between the devotional reverence of Macha's love poem and the cynically coarse references to its heroine in the poet's diary.\\" This problem is \\"solved\\" in reference to the demands of literary genre: \\"The formulae of love poetry encouraged, indeed urged upon the poet, the tone of adoration, of worship.\\" Movie version The Czech short Vid√≠≈°-li poutn√≠ka ... made in 1966 by Ji≈ô√≠ Gold and Vladim√≠r Skalsk√Ω is an experimental film about M√°j quoting the poem, the poet's diary and his critiques. In 2008, Czech director F. A. Brabec made a movie, also called M√°j, based on the poem. References External links  * May by K.H.

Considered highly influential, Edwards was one of a handful of key curators, along with Alfred Stieglitz, Edward Steichen and John Szarkowski, who worked to gain the acceptance in the United States of fine art photography and documentary photography as art forms. Early life and education Hugh Logan Edwards Jr was born as the only child of his parents in the river city of Paducah, Kentucky, at the confluence of the Tennessee and Ohio rivers.David Travis, \\"Hugh Edwards: A Gentleman from Kentucky\\", Art Institute of Chicago, 2017 His family was deeply attached to the rivers of the American South: his father was an engineer on a steamboat and his grandfather was a river pilot. A great uncle had fought on the Confederate side of the Civil War, taking a family slave to act as valet, and fighting in the Battle of Shiloh. Although Edwards did not have formal education beyond high school, he became a highly cultured, self-taught man who was fluent in French and Italian, the better to read literature of those countries in the original languages. He became known for his love of music and collection of American and European literature. Career Edwards's first job after high school was as a librarian in Paducah at the McCracken County Public Library. His parents encouraged him to continue his study of piano and he moved to Chicago, which opened a larger world to him. He became an assistant at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1959, he was appointed as Curator of Prints & Drawings, serving until 1970. He was responsible for the significant collection of photographs there and expanded the collection, acquiring some three thousand prints. He also organized seventy-five shows during his time at the Art Institute.Elizabeth Siegel, \\"The Photographer's Curator\\" (Hugh Edwards), Art Institute of Chicago, 2017 In many cases, Edwards led the Art Institute to be the first museum to offer a solo show to young photographers who later became important in the field, such as Robert Frank, Raymond Moore, and others. Edwards struggled to curate in the small, cramped gallery space and without the financial resources to produce accompanying exhibition catalogs. Shy and retiring, and without a college education, Edwards did not become a public champion of photography and rarely wrote about it beyond reviewing. But in the years before the art world's acceptance of photography, Edwards offered vital support and encouragement to many emerging photographers, including Jan Saudek, Duane Michals, Algimantas Kezys, Danny Lyon and others. According to Lyon, \\"Edwards ushered in what is known as the Golden Age of Chicago Photography. He expressed himself mostly in conversation and through the photographers he chose to exhibit.\\"Danny Lyon, \\"Hugh Edwards: Curator, Mentor, Friend\\", New York Books Daily, 11 November 2017 Edwards was also a practicing photographer; during the 1950s he worked on a decade-long project to document the people of a roller rink in Harvey, Illinois. He ceased photographing in 1961. When asked why he no longer photographed, he responded, \\" 'Why should I?' Hugh answered.

Dual Monitors Boost Productivity, User Satisfaction show that, depending on the type of work, multi-head may increase the productivity by 50‚Äì70%. Measurements of the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social Accident Insurance showed that the quality and quantity of worker performance varies according to the screen setup and type of task. Overall, the results of physiological studies and the preferences of the test persons favour a dual-monitor rather than single-monitor setup. Physiologically limiting factors observed during work on dual monitors were minor and not generally significant. There is no clue that office work with dual-monitor setups presents a possible hazard to workers.  Implementation  Analog Monitor Splitter for VGA cable Multiple computers can be connected to provide a single display, e.g. over Gigabit Ethernet/Ethernet to drive a large video wall.  Display modes = USB  One way to extend the number of displays on one computer is to add displays via USB. Starting in 2006, DisplayLink released several chips for USB support on VGA/DVI/LVDS and other interfaces.  Adoption = In the office  A Bloomberg Terminal market making In many professions, including graphic design, architecture, communications, accounting, engineering and video editing, the idea of two or more monitors being driven from one machine is not a new one. While in the past, it has meant multiple graphics adapters and specialized software, it was common for engineers to have at least two, if not more, displays to enhance productivity.Bill Gates. April 7, 2006. How I Work. Fortune.  In video gaming  AMD Eyefinity-driven multi-monitor system for gaming Multi-monitor gaming/simulation is also becoming more common; however, the hardware expense can be a limiting factor. The rising popularity of using multiple monitors to game is leading to websites being introduced which allow for smooth and easy configuration from outside sources from the original one screen option given by developers to a new multiple screen option. = Computer games that support multi-monitor set-ups = Early versions of Doom permitted a three- monitor display mode, using three networked machines to show left, right, and center views. More recently, games have used multiple monitors to show a more absorbing interface to the player or to display game information. Various flight simulators can use these monitor setups to create an artificial cockpit with more realistic interfaces. Others such as Supreme Commander and World in Conflict can use an additional monitor for a large scale map of the battlefield.Supreme Commander Hardware Performance Guide , AU Game Spot, February 2007 A large number of older games support multi-monitor set-ups by treating the total screen space as effectively a single monitor to the game, a technique known as spanning. Many games without inherent multi-monitor support such as Guild Wars and World of Warcraft can also be made to run in multi- monitor set-ups, with this technique or in conjunction with addition of third- party software A larger list of games that support dual/multi-screen modes is available at WSGF. = Arcade machines and handheld console games = The concept of \\"multi-monitor\\" games is not limited to games that can be played on personal computers. As arcade technology entered the 1990s, larger cabinets were being built which in turn also housed larger monitors such as the 3 28\\" screen version of Namco's Ridge Racer from 1993. Although large screen technology such as CRT rear projection was beginning to be used more often, multi-monitor games were still occasionally released, such as Sega's F355 Challenge from 1999 which again used 3 28\\" monitors for the sit-down cockpit version. The most recent use of a multi-monitor setup in arcades occurred with Taito's Dariusburst: Another Chronicle game, released in Japan in December 2010 and worldwide the following year. It uses 2 32\\" LCD screens and an angled mirror to create a seamless widescreen. Nintendo demonstrated the feasibility of playing multi-monitor games on handheld game consoles in designing the Nintendo DS and its successor, the Nintendo 3DS, which both became successful consoles in their own right. Games on these systems take advantage of the two screens available, typically by displaying gameplay on the upper screen, while showing useful information on the bottom screen. There are also a number of games, mostly for the Nintendo DS, whose gameplay spans across both screens, combining them into one tall screen for a more unique and larger view of the action.  Developing software for multiple monitor workstations  Ordinary software does not need special support for multiple screens even if it uses the graphic accelerator. At the usual application level, multihead is presented just as a single larger monitor spanning over all screens. However, some special approaches may increase the multithread performance. With multiple monitors present, each screen will have its own graphics buffer. One possible scenario for programming is to present to OpenGL or DirectX a continuous, virtual frame buffer in which the OS or graphics driver writes out to each individual buffer. With some graphics cards, it's possible to enable a mode called \\"horizontal span\\" which accomplishes this. The OpenGL/DirectX programmer then renders to a very large frame buffer for output. In practice, and with recent cards, this mode is being phased out because it does not make very good use of GPU parallelism and does not support arbitrary arrangements of monitors (they must all be horizontal). A more recent technique uses the wglShareLists feature of OpenGL to share data across multiple GPUs, and then render to each individual monitor's frame buffer.  In Android  Android supports an additional monitor as of version 4.2 but additional software is needed to multi-task/use both at once.

Cutdowns were popular amongst skinheads and scooterboys during the mod revival of the 1970s and 1980s. While the style-obsessed British mod youth subculture of the 1960s prized the glamorous, metropolitan image of scooters, many skinheads and scooterboys viewed their bikes as simply a form of transportation. This \\"naked\\" Lambretta has been cut down and customized. While some scooter enthusiasts have focused on the stripped-down look, with just a bare frame and visible engine and mechanical parts, some scooterboys put back almost as much hardware as they had taken off, by adding customized chrome-plated accessories and racks. Modifications Many cutdowns have unneeded parts removed to improve power- to-weight ratio. Typically the front mudguards, leg shields, floors, rear section and side panels are removed. Cutting away body parts is the easiest with Lambretta scooters, because they are built on a tubular frame, which means that the body parts do not have a structural role. Vespa scooters, on the other hand, are usually built with a unibody design, so the body panels give the bike its structure. This means that when Vespas are cut down, they cannot be made as bare-bones as a Lambretta. The body panels of a Vespa are modified by slimming them down or giving them a different shape, in such a way that the structural soundness of the bike is not compromised. Cutdowns are often tuned ‚Äì much like a four-wheeled hot rod ‚Äì by overboring the cylinders to increase engine power or adding performance exhausts, modified carburettors, or aftermarket shock absorbers. Some enthusiasts replace the standard drum front brakes with hydraulic disc brakes or add water cooling radiators. Lambretta owners may replace existing parts with a Nikasil plated aluminium barrel with radical porting, large Dell'Orto or Mikuni carburettors and bespoke (custom-made) expansion chambers, hydraulic clutches, and modern low-profile tyres. Some scooterists use aluminum Fabrizi racing barrels, because they use a rotary induction mechanism. Stock gas tanks may be replaced with increased capacity tanks, which put the weight of the fuel further forward. Some riders install a small fairing to reduce wind resistance and enable higher speeds and stability. To reduce weight, some scooterists use lighter-weight aftermarket parts, such as carbon fibre sports seats and other parts made from carbon fibre, carbon kevlar and fiberglass. Some cutdowns have been used for drag racing. At scooter races, cutdowns often race in a separate category called the \\"specials\\", which is for cutdown and heavily modified racing scooters. The other scooter race categories include stock races with relatively unmodified larger scooters (152 to 250 cc) and \\"small frame\\" races for scooters with 136 cc or smaller engines. For races, scooters usually have to have accessories removed, such as center and side stands, mirrors, turn signals that stick out, and luggage racks. Scooter races often disallow performance-enhancing fuel additives such as octane booster. Related scooter types A Baja 150cc scooter. A cutdown scooter resembles a \\"naked scooter\\", which is a scooter designed without panels covering the engine and with little or no bodywork. The difference between the two types is that while a cutdown scooter started as a regular scooter with body panels and bodywork, before it was customized, a \\"naked scooter\\" is designed and manufactured as a \\"bare- bones\\" vehicle. In the 1960s, Lambretta models A through D were in this category. In the 1990s, Italjet produced a stripped-down scooter called the Dragster. In the 2000s Honda produced the Ruckus, which had the motor mounted in a skeleton-style metal frame. The Honda Ruckus uses a skeleton-style frame without body paneling Another scooter type which is related to cutdowns is the \\"chopper\\", which is an extreme cutdown scooter with extra-long front forks. These bikes are mostly made using Lambrettas, because when the bodywork is removed from their tubular frame they resemble smaller custom style motorcycles. \\"Rats\\" are cutdowns which are made by putting together old parts to create a rough-looking, unpainted bike. In contrast to many other scooter enthusiasts, \\"rat\\" builders view blemishes and unrepaired dents as attractive. The \\"rat\\" approach to scooter customizing is similar to the rat rod style of hot rodding, in which old cars often have original paint with rust patches, or even just bare rusty metal. Major scooter rallies which give prizes to scooters sometimes put \\"chopper\\" and \\"rat\\" scooters in a separate category from the rest of the cutdowns.

The first school in H√≥lar was founded in 1106. It was renamed H√≥lar Agricultural College in 1882 and became H√≥lar University College in 2007. This long history of education at H√≥lar makes it one of the oldest schools in Europe. History H√≥lar in Hjaltadalur has a long history of schools and education. Bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson‚Äôs cathedral school was founded in 1106, and after the Reformation in 1550 the school was converted to a Latin school that remained in operation until 1801. In 1882, an agricultural school was established at H√≥lar, and H√≥lar University College traces its roots to that institution. During the past 15 years, the school at H√≥lar has developed from a conventional agricultural school to a modern university-level institution. Architecture On campus the architectural history of Iceland can be traced from traditional turf houses to the present day and the school has a policy of safeguarding this heritage through sustainable use. The main building, which houses the department of tourism, is the work of two of the first architects in Iceland and dates from 1910 and 1927 respectively. Among the most important architectural landmarks in Iceland is the cathedral consecrated in 1763. Early Settlement Although H√≥lar is not mentioned in the Icelandic sagas, it is thought that it was settled by people from the early settlement of Hof, which is about 2,5 km south of H√≥lar. Hof, which is mentioned in the sagas, was settled by Hjalti √û√≥r√∞arson whose sons became famous for their generosity and gallantry. The story tells that when they buried their father they gave the largest known burial feast in heathen times. Twelve hundred guests were invited and after the feast all men of distinction were sent on their way with valuable gifts. There is no doubt that their nobility and that of their descendants helped establish the fame and prosperity of H√≥lar. In the middle of the eleventh century a kinsman of the Hof family named Oxi Hjaltason, who lived in H√≥lar, built a great church there. Around the year 1100, H√≥lar was owned by Illugi Bjarnason who, when a bishop's seat was established in northern Iceland, gave H√≥lar to the Church for that purpose. Bishop's seat and the bishops During Catholic times, H√≥lar accumulated great wealth and was densely populated. During the peak of the bishop's seat era, H√≥lar owned 352 estates that accounted for about a quarter of all the estates in the north of the country. Apart from that it enjoyed the privilege of driftwood (a valuable resource) along with rights to other advantages in several surrounding areas. The first printing press in Iceland was installed here around 1530 and H√≥lar was the last stronghold of the Catholic Church during the Reformation. The present cathedral, consecrated in 1763, is the oldest stone church in Iceland. H√≥lar remained a bishop's seat for almost seven centuries from 1106 until 1802 when H√≥lar was sold. During that era H√≥lar was the true centre of northern Iceland and one of the major cultural centres of the area. This status was partly due to the school that was around there for most of this time. Of the thirty six bishops who resided at H√≥lar, twenty three were Catholic and thirteen Lutheran. Many of these have left their mark in Icelandic history. Among the most well known are J√≥n √ñgmundsson, the Sacred (1106-1121), Gu√∞mundur Arason the Good (1203-1237), J√≥n Arason (1524-1550) and Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson (1571-1627). The first bishop in H√≥lar was J√≥n √ñgmundsson the Sacred, who was ordained in 1106. He established and ran a seminary at H√≥lar and became very well known for this as well as his management of the church. The commonly used phrase \\"heim a√∞ H√≥lum\\" or \\"back home to H√≥lar\\" dates back to him. Gu√∞mundur Arason the Good was famous for his rivalry with some of the most respected chieftains in northern Iceland. Gu√∞mundur went on to lead a band of followers in what became a semi vagrant life. J√≥n Arason was the last Catholic bishop, he fought strongly against the Reformation and was finally beheaded along with his two sons in Sk√°lholt in November 1550, and the resistance against the Reformation came to an end. J√≥n was a well known poet and it was he who brought the first printing press to Iceland in around 1530. Gu√∞brandur √ûorl√°ksson was famous for his active book publishing, among of them was the first translation of the Bible into Icelandic, which was printed in 1584. The printing of this Bible is thought to have played a crucial role in the preservation of the Icelandic language. H√≥lar became a vicarage after the bishop's seat was abolished until 1861 when the vicarage was moved to Vi√∞v√≠k. In 1952 H√≥lar was re- established as a vicarage and in 1986 it became the residence of the ordained bishop of the H√≥lar benefice. The present bishop at H√≥lar is Solveig L√°ra Gu√∞mundsd√≥ttir. Cathedral school - Latin school - Agricultural school - University H√≥lar in Hjaltadalur has a long history of schools and education. Bishop J√≥n √ñgmundsson‚Äôs cathedral school was founded in 1106, and after the Reformation in 1550 the school was converted to a Latin school that remained in operation until 1801. In 1882 an agricultural school was established at H√≥lar, and H√≥lar University College traces its roots to that institution. During the past 15 years, the school at H√≥lar has developed from a conventional agricultural school to a modern university-level institution. In 2003, the College was granted permission to graduate students with an undergraduate degree, and on 1 July 2007 H√≥lar University College formally commenced operations. Departments There are three departments in the University. Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology Veri√∞ - The main building for the Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology. Located in Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur. The objective of the Department of Aquaculture and Fish Biology is to gather and disseminate knowledge in the fields of aquatic biology, aquaculture, and fish biology. The department is an international centre for research, instruction, and continuing education in aquatic biology, aquaculture, and fish biology. The department promotes the professional development of aquaculture in the spirit of sustainable development. The department has approached its objective through a good relationship between research and teaching, a strong collaboration with other higher education institution, strong rooting in the industry and through flexibility for students in controlling their own studies. Department of Equine Studies The objective of the Equine Science Department is to provide professional education in the fields of horse breeding, horse training, horsemanship, as well as in teaching and coaching riding. Furthermore, the department works towards development and innovation within the field of equine science, through research activities. It also promotes increased profitability in the sector, the spread of equestrian activities, and the welfare of horses. The department is an international centre for education and research in the fields of horse breeding, horse training, horsemanship, and riding instructions. H√≥lar College has a formal collaboration agreement with The Icelandic Horse Trainers Association regarding further development of the programs and quality control of the education provided by the college Department of Tourism Studies It is the department‚Äòs mission to train students to be professionals and prepare them for active participation in policy making and development of the tourism sector and for research based graduate programs. The department provides the industry with well educated people who will improve the professionalism and quality of Icelandic tourist services. This is achieved by two main emphases: An emphasis on teaching methods based on student involvement and training communication skills, analytical thinking and critical evaluation. Students are expected to participate in the on-line educational community in a professional manner, and they are expected to participate actively in the quality measures and course development. An emphasis is placed on providing practical education that leads to employment opportunities. Many of the courses have practical components. The diploma programs both have an extended practicum (15 and 30 ECTS respectively) where students are expected to be reflective practitioners in the field under supervision of faculty as well as a workplace mentor. In the program offerings these aims are addressed by course offerings on four foundations of tourism: Infrastructure and development; Management, marketing and business skills; tourist experience ‚Äì demand, expectations and experiences; Supply of services, events and products. Quality, sustainability and professionalism are the underlying principles of the programs. Each of those four streams offers both general courses as well as courses focused on more specific matters. Tourism is a very diverse sector and offers range of opportunities to engage in specialized fields. The aim of the diploma programs is to give the students a broad overview of the sector and insight in topics of relevance. Specific subjects are more common during the second half of the BA program, in particular with a focus on various types of niche tourism. The programs progress from the general to the specific. The diploma programs open with an overview course; Tourism and Festivals and events, respectively. There the practicum and for the Event management, the final project are the in-depth, individual study components. The first year offers the overview and in years 2 and 3 more specific issues are raised and the demand for personal input and individual research increases. Living at H√≥lar The community at H√≥lar has grown in tandem with the growth of H√≥lar University College. The ecclesiastical site, community and farm-land at H√≥lar is operated by H√≥lar University College, whose objective is to maintain the dignity and sanctity of the site. To that end, an ambitious environmental policy has been set. The community at H√≥lar is small and close knit. The campus at H√≥lar in Hjaltadalur has excellent residential housing, both for individuals and for families. There is a primary school and a pre-school on campus, serving H√≥lar and the neighbouring rural area. There are diverse opportunities for outdoor activities in the area. H√≥lar forest borders the campus so it is easy to walk, jog, or go cross-country skiing and there are various longer hiking trails in the immediate area. There is also a sports hall and swimming pool. Facilities for horse riding are excellent. Most of the students and employees of H√≥lar University College and other institutions located at H√≥lar live in the area. H√≥lar is a popular destination and tourist services are operated there in the summer months. At H√≥lar the cafeteria where students and employees can purchase lunch is operated year-round. The nearest town and service centre is Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur, 30 km from H√≥lar. In the Sau√∞√°rkr√≥kur campus there is a large dining room with a kitchen for students and employees, as well as easy access to the town shops and restaurants.

Background After the Battle of Antietam, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia prepared to defend against a Federal assault that never came. After an improvised truce for both sides to recover and exchange their wounded, Lee's forces began withdrawing across the Potomac River on the evening of September 18 to return to Virginia. Lee left behind a rearguard of two infantry brigades and 44 or 45 guns under his chief of artillery, Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, to hold Boteler's Ford.Kennedy, p. 121, cites 45, McGrath, np., 44. Battle Map of Shepherdstown Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Shortly before dusk on September 19, Union Brig. Gen. Charles Griffin sent two regiments, the 1st U.S. Sharpshooters and the 4th Michigan, across the Potomac River at Boteler's Ford. They attacked Pendleton's rearguard, capturing four artillery pieces before being recalled. Pendleton incorrectly reported to Gen. Robert E. Lee that he had lost all 44 guns of his artillery reserve. Early on September 20, Porter sent two brigades across the Potomac on a reconnaissance-in-force. Major Charles Lovell's brigade of Regulars encountered Maj. Gen. A. P. Hill's \\"Light Division\\" about a mile from the river. While withdrawing back to the ford Hill's men attacked under a withering hail of federal artillery fire, which inflicted tremendous casualties. Col. James Barnes's brigade was ordered to the top of the bluffs to cover the retreat, and two more Federal brigades were ordered to cross to the Virginia side of the river. After a violent clash along the heights bordering the river, Porter ordered a withdrawal. However, the colonel of the inexperienced 118th Pennsylvania (the \\"Corn Exchange\\" Regiment) refused to retire until orders were received through the proper chain of command. In this engagement, their first time under fire, the 118th Pennsylvania were driven in by four Confederate brigades and suffered 36% losses. Aftermath The total Union dead and wounded at Shepherdstown makes it the bloodiest battle fought in what would become the state of West Virginia. The battle convinced both army commanders that the Maryland Campaign was over. George McClellan decided that an active pursuit of the enemy was not possible at this time and established a defensive posture along the Maryland bank. And for the Confederates, Robert E. Lee chose to abort his army's movement back into Maryland. With the Confederates driven from Northern soil, President Abraham Lincoln used the opportunity to issue the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, 1862.

The wheel and axle is a machine consisting of a wheel attached to a smaller axle so that these two parts rotate together in which a force is transferred from one to the other.The wheel and axle can be viewed as a version of the lever, with a drive force applied tangentially to the perimeter of the wheel and a load force applied to the axle, respectively, that are balanced around the hinge which is the fulcrum. History The Halaf culture of 6500‚Äì5100 BCE has been credited with the earliest depiction of a wheeled vehicle, but this is doubtful as there is no evidence of Halafians using either wheeled vehicles or even pottery wheels. One of the first applications of the wheel to appear was the potter's wheel, used by prehistoric cultures to fabricate clay pots. The earliest type, known as \\"tournettes\\" or \\"slow wheels\\", were known in the Middle East by the 5th millennium BCE. One of the earliest examples was discovered at Tepe Pardis, Iran, and dated to 5200‚Äì4700 BCE. These were made of stone or clay and secured to the ground with a peg in the center, but required significant effort to turn. True potter's wheels, which are freely- spinning and have a wheel and axle mechanism, were developed in Mesopotamia (Iraq) by 4200‚Äì4000 BCE. The oldest surviving example, which was found in Ur (modern day Iraq), dates to approximately 3100 BCE. Evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared by the late 4th millennium BCE. Depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk, in the Sumerian civilization of Mesopotamia, are dated between 3700‚Äì3500 BCE. In the second half of the 4th millennium BCE, evidence of wheeled vehicles appeared near-simultaneously in the Northern Caucasus (Maykop culture) and Eastern Europe (Cucuteni‚ÄìTrypillian culture). Depictions of a wheeled vehicle appeared between 3500 and 3350 BCE in the Bronocice clay pot excavated in a Funnelbeaker culture settlement in southern Poland. In nearby Olszanica, a 2.2 m wide door was constructed (2.2 wide doors were constructed) for wagon entry; this barn was 40 m long and had 3 doors. Surviving evidence of a wheel‚Äìaxle combination, from Stare Gmajne near Ljubljana in Slovenia (Ljubljana Marshes Wooden Wheel), is dated within two standard deviations to 3340‚Äì3030 BCE, the axle to 3360‚Äì3045 BCE.Velu≈°ƒçek, A.; ƒåufar, K. and Zupanƒçiƒç, M.

Ljubljansko barje v 2. polovici 4. tisoƒçletja pr. Kr. Opera Instituti Archaeologici Sloveniae 16. Ljubljana. Two types of early Neolithic European wheel and axle are known; a circumalpine type of wagon construction (the wheel and axle rotate together, as in Ljubljana Marshes Wheel), and that of the Baden culture in Hungary (axle does not rotate). They both are dated to c. 3200‚Äì3000 BCE.Fowler, Chris; Harding, Jan and Hofmann, Daniela (eds.) (2015). The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe. OUP Oxford. . p. 109. Historians believe that there was a diffusion of the wheeled vehicle from the Near East to Europe around the mid-4th millennium BCE. An early example of a wooden wheel and its axle was found in 2002 at the Ljubljana Marshes some 20 km south of Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. According to radiocarbon dating, it is between 5,100 and 5,350 years old. The wheel was made of ash and oak and had a radius of 70 cm and the axle was 120 cm long and made of oak. In Roman Egypt, Hero of Alexandria identified the wheel and axle as one of the simple machines used to lift weights. This is thought to have been in the form of the windlass which consists of a crank or pulley connected to a cylindrical barrel that provides mechanical advantage to wind up a rope and lift a load such as a bucket from the well.Elroy McKendree Avery, Elementary Physics, New York : Sheldon & Company, 1878. The wheel and axle was identified as one of six simple machines by Renaissance scientists, drawing from Greek texts on technology.Wheel and Axle, The World Book Encyclopedia, World Book Inc., 1998, pp. 280‚Äì281 Mechanical advantage The simple machine called a wheel and axle refers to the assembly formed by two disks, or cylinders, of different diameters mounted so they rotate together around the same axis. The thin rod which needs to be turned is called the axle and the wider object fixed to the axle, on which we apply force is called the wheel. A tangential force applied to the periphery of the large disk can exert a larger force on a load attached to the axle, achieving mechanical advantage. When used as the wheel of a wheeled vehicle the smaller cylinder is the axle of the wheel, but when used in a windlass, winch, and other similar applications (see medieval mining lift to right) the smaller cylinder may be separate from the axle mounted in the bearings. It cannot be used separately.Prater, Edward L. (1994), Basic Machines, Naval Education and Training Professional Development and Technology Center, NAVEDTRA 14037Bureau of Naval Personnel, 1971, Basic Machines and How They Work, Dover Publications. Assuming the wheel and axle does not dissipate or store energy, that is it has no friction or elasticity, the power input by the force applied to the wheel must equal the power output at the axle. As the wheel and axle system rotates around its bearings, points on the circumference, or edge, of the wheel move faster than points on the circumference, or edge, of the axle. Therefore, a force applied to the edge of the wheel must be less than the force applied to the edge of the axle, because power is the product of force and velocity.J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, Theory of Machines and Mechanisms, Oxford University Press, New York. Let a and b be the distances from the center of the bearing to the edges of the wheel A and the axle B. If the input force FA is applied to the edge of the wheel A and the force FB at the edge of the axle B is the output, then the ratio of the velocities of points A and B is given by a/b, so the ratio of the output force to the input force, or mechanical advantage, is given by :MA = \\\\frac{F_B}{F_A} = \\\\frac{a}{b}. The mechanical advantage of a simple machine like the wheel and axle is computed as the ratio of the resistance to the effort. The larger the ratio the greater the multiplication of force (torque) created or distance achieved. By varying the radii of the axle and/or wheel, any amount of mechanical advantage may be gained.Bowser, Edward Albert, 1890, An elementary treatise on analytic mechanics: with numerous examples. (Originally from the University of Michigan) D. Van Nostrand Company, pp. 190 In this manner, the size of the wheel may be increased to an inconvenient extent. In this case a system or combination of wheels (often toothed, that is, gears) are used. As a wheel and axle is a type of lever, a system of wheels and axles is like a compound lever.Baker, C.E.

Because it always halts, such a machine is able to decide whether a given string is a member of a formal language. The class of languages which can be decided by such machines is exactly the set of recursive languages. However, the halting problem, determining whether an arbitrary Turing machine halts on a given input, is itself an undecidable problem.  Functions computable by total Turing machines  In practice, many functions of interest are computable by machines that always halt. A machine that uses only finite memory on any particular input can be forced to halt for every input by restricting its flow control capabilities so that no input will ever cause the machine to enter an infinite loop. As a trivial example, a machine implementing a finitary decision tree will always halt. It is not required that the machine be entirely free of looping capabilities, however, to guarantee halting. If we restrict loops to be of a predictably finite size (like the FOR loop in BASIC), we can express all of the primitive recursive functions (Meyer and Ritchie, 1967). An example of such a machine is provided by the toy programming language PL-{GOTO} of Brainerd and Landweber (1974). We can further define a programming language in which we can ensure that even more sophisticated functions always halt. For example, the Ackermann function, which is not primitive recursive, nevertheless is a total computable function computable by a term rewriting system with a reduction ordering on its arguments (Ohlebusch, 2002, pp. 67). Despite the above examples of programming languages which guarantee termination of the programs, there exists no programming language which captures exactly the recursive functions, i.e. the functions which can be computed by a Turing machine that always halts. This is because existence of such a programming language would be a contradiction to the non-semi-decidability of the problem whether a Turing machine halts on every input.  Relationship to partial Turing machines  A general Turing machine will compute a partial function. Two questions can be asked about the relationship between partial Turing machines and total Turing machines: # Can every partial function computable by a partial Turing machine be extended (that is, have its domain enlarged) to become a total computable function? # Is it possible to change the definition of a Turing machine so that a particular class of total Turing machines, computing all the total computable functions, can be found? The answer to each of these questions is no. The following theorem shows that the functions computable by machines that always halt do not include extensions of all partial computable functions, which implies the first question above has a negative answer. This fact is closely related to the algorithmic unsolvability of the Halting problem. :Theorem. There are Turing computable partial functions that have no extension to a total Turing computable function. In particular, the partial function f defined so that f(n) = m if and only if the Turing machine with index n halts on input 0 with output m has no extension to a total computable function. Indeed, if g were a total computable function extending f then g would be computable by some Turing machine; fix e as the index of such a machine. Build a Turing machine M, using Kleene's recursion theorem, which on input 0 simulates the machine with index e running on an index nM for M (thus the machine M can produce an index of itself; this is the role of the recursion theorem). By assumption, this simulation will eventually return an answer. Define M so that if g(nM) = m then the return value of M is m + 1. Thus f(nM), the true return value of M on input 0, will not equal g(nM). Hence g does not extend f. The second question asks, in essence, whether there is another reasonable model of computation which computes only total functions and computes all the total computable functions. Informally, if such a model existed then each of its computers could be simulated by a Turing machine. Thus if this new model of computation consisted of a sequence M_1,M_2,\\\\ldots of machines, there would be a recursively enumerable sequence T_1,\\\\ldots T_2,\\\\ldots of Turing machines that compute total functions and so that every total computable function is computable by one of the machines Ti. This is impossible, because a machine T could be constructed such that on input i the machine T returns T_i(i)+1\\\\,. This machine cannot be equivalent to any machine T on the list: suppose it were on the list at index j. Then T_j(j)=T_j(j)+1\\\\,, which does not return an integer result. Therefore, it cannot be total, but the function by construction must be total (if total functions are recursively enumerable, then this function can be constructed), which is a contradiction. This shows that the second question has a negative answer.  The set of indices of total Turing machines  The decision problem of whether the Turing machine with index e will halt on every input is not decidable. In fact, this problem is at level \\\\Pi^0_2 of the arithmetical hierarchy. Thus this problem is strictly more difficult than the Halting problem, which asks whether the machine with index e halts on input 0. Intuitively, this difference in unsolvability is because each instance of the \\"total machine\\" problem represents infinitely many instances of the Halting problem. See also: Termination analysis.  Provability  One may be interested not only in whether a Turing machine is total, but also in whether this can be proven in a certain logical system, such as first order Peano arithmetic. In a sound proof system, every provably total Turing machine is indeed total, but the converse is not true: informally, for every first-order proof system that is strong enough (including Peano arithmetic), there are Turing machines which are assumed to be total, but cannot be proven as such, unless the system is inconsistent (in which case one can prove anything). The proof of their totality either rests on some assumptions or require another proof system. Thus, as one can enumerate all the proofs in the proof system, one can build a Turing machine on input n that goes through the first n proofs and look for a contradiction. If it finds one, it gets into an infinite loop and never halts; otherwise, it halts. If the system is consistent, the Turing machine will halt on every input, but one cannot prove this in a strong enough proof system due to G√∂del's incompleteness theorems. One can also create a Turing machine that will halt if and only if the proof system is inconsistent, and is thus non- total for a consistent system but cannot be proven such: This is a Turing machine that, regardless of input, enumerates all proofs and halts on a contradiction. A Turing machine that goes through Goodstein sequences and halts at zero is total but cannot be proven as such in Peano arithmetic.

It was initially introduced into mathematics in the context of modular arithmetic by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1801. Since then, the term has gained many meanings‚Äîsome exact and some imprecise (such as equating \\"modulo\\" with \\"except for\\"). For the most part, the term often occurs in statements of the form: :A is the same as B modulo C which means :A and B are the same‚Äîexcept for differences accounted for or explained by C. History Modulo is a mathematical jargon that was introduced into mathematics in the book Disquisitiones Arithmeticae by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1801. Given the integers a, b and n, the expression a ‚â° b (mod n) (pronounced \\"a is congruent to b modulo n\\") means that a ‚àí b is an integer multiple of n, or equivalently, a and b both share the same remainder when divided by n. It is the Latin ablative of modulus, which itself means \\"a small measure.\\" The term has gained many meanings over the years‚Äîsome exact and some imprecise. The most general precise definition is simply in terms of an equivalence relation R, where a is equivalent (or congruent) to b modulo R if aRb. More informally, the term is found in statements of the form: :A is the same as B modulo C which means :A and B are the same‚Äîexcept for differences accounted for or explained by C. Usage=Original use Gauss originally intended to use \\"modulo\\" as follows: given the integers a, b and n, the expression a ‚â° b (mod n) (pronounced \\"a is congruent to b modulo n\\") means that a ‚àí b is an integer multiple of n, or equivalently, a and b both leave the same remainder when divided by n. For example: : 13 is congruent to 63 modulo 10 means that : 13 - 63 is a multiple of 10 (equiv., 13 and 63 differ by a multiple of 10). Computing In computing and computer science, the term can be used in several ways: * In computing, it is typically the modulo operation: given two numbers (either integer or real), a and n, a modulo n is the remainder of the numerical division of a by n, under certain constraints. * In category theory as applied to functional programming, \\"operating modulo\\" is special jargon which refers to mapping a functor to a category by highlighting or defining remainders. Structures The term \\"modulo\\" can be used differently‚Äîwhen referring to different mathematical structures. For example: * Two members a and b of a group are congruent modulo a normal subgroup, if and only if ab‚àí1 is a member of the normal subgroup (see quotient group and isomorphism theorem for more). * Two members of a ring or an algebra are congruent modulo an ideal, if the difference between them is in the ideal. ** Used as a verb, the act of factoring out a normal subgroup (or an ideal) from a group (or ring) is often called \\"modding out the...\\" or \\"we now mod out the...\\". * Two subsets of an infinite set are equal modulo finite sets precisely if their symmetric difference is finite, that is, you can remove a finite piece from the first subset, then add a finite piece to it, and get the second subset as a result. * A short exact sequence of maps leads to the definition of a quotient space as being one space modulo another; thus, for example, that a cohomology is the space of closed forms modulo exact forms. Modding out In general, modding out is a somewhat informal term that means declaring things equivalent that otherwise would be considered distinct. For example, suppose the sequence 1 4 2 8 5 7 is to be regarded as the same as the sequence 7 1 4 2 8 5, because each is a cyclicly-shifted version of the other: :: \\\\begin{array}{ccccccccccccc} & 1 & & 4 & & 2 & & 8 & & 5 & & 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow & & \\\\searrow \\\\\\\\\\\\ & 7 & & 1 & & 4 & & 2 & & 8 & & 5 \\\\end{array} In that case, the phrase \\"modding out by cyclic shifts\\" can also be used.

It is also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, and, when first exhibited in 1891, was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening (Caf√©, le soir). Van Gogh painted Caf√© Terrace at Night in Arles, France, in mid- September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in three letters. Visitors to the site can stand at the northeastern corner of the Place du Forum, where the artist set up his easel. The site was refurbished in 1990 and 1991 to replicate van Gogh's painting. He looked south towards the artificially lit terrace of the popular coffee house, as well as into the enforced darkness of the rue du Palais which led up to a building structure (to the left, not pictured) and, beyond this structure, the tower of a former church which is now Mus√©e Lapidaire. Towards the right, Van Gogh indicated a lighted shop as well and some branches of the trees surrounding the place, but he omitted the remainders of the Roman monuments just beside this little shop. The painting is currently at the Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum in Otterlo, Netherlands. Genesis Preparatory study for the painting, September 1888. (F1519) Dallas Museum of Art, The Wendy and Emery Reves Collection. After finishing Caf√© Terrace at Night, Van Gogh wrote a letter to his sister expressing his enthusiasm: He continues, in this same letter, The caf√© terrace, now 'Le Caf√© La Nuit', at Place du Forum, Arles, July 2016 This excerpt forms the basis of the Van Gogh Museum's curators' opinion that the painting is a depiction \\"of drinkers in the harsh, bright lights of their illuminated facades\\" from Maupassant's novel Bel Ami, however, they also note that Maupassant makes no mention of a 'starry sky.' In 1981, Bogomila Welsh- Ovcharov argued that since it \\"displays not only a night scene but also a funnel-like perspective and dominant blue-yellow tonality\\" it was at least partially inspired by Louis Anquetin's Avenue de Clichy: 5 o'clock in the evening.Welsh-Ovcharov, Bogomila: Vincent van Gogh and the Birth of Cloisonism (!), Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto, 24 January - 22 March 1981 and Rijksmuseum Vincent van Gogh, Amsterdam, 9 April - 14 June 1989 An academic paper presented at IAFOR's 2013 European Conference on Arts & Humanities, however, advanced the theory that van Gogh intended the painting to be a uniquely innovated Last Supper. The paper was subsequently published by The Art Histories Society in the January, 2014 Art History SupplementSee Art History Supplement vol. 4, issue 1 and the July, 2014 fourteenth volume of The Anistoriton Journal of History, Archaeology and Art History. Briefly, the paper examines the myriad artistic influences van Gogh was parsing the summer of 1888: his lifelong devotion to and imitation of Jesus Christ; synthesizing Japonism and Cloisonnism with his own plein air techniques; colorizing Jean- Fran√ßois Millet's pious genre scenes with Eug√®ne Delacroix's luminous palette (see Boats du Rh√¥ne); \\"search-for-sacred-realism\\" correspondence with his artist friend √âmile Bernard; Thomas Carlyle and Boccaccio's examples of dressing old ideas in new clothes; an √âmile Burnouf article claiming Buddhist missionaries sowed the seeds Essenes later reaped as Christianity; failed attempts creating his own Christ in the Garden of Olives; two proximal Last Supper studies (Interior of a Restaurant in Arles and Interior of the Restaurant Carrel in Arles) featuring straw-bottomed chairs he'd just purchased by the dozen (hoping to start a commune of twelve \\"artist-apostles\\" at his Yellow House); culminating with his composition of twelve diners drenched in a yellow halo surrounding a Rembrandtesque server framed by a crucifix at the vanishing point of the picture; it's concluded his original starry night is a Symbolist's Last Supper. Although van Gogh never explicitly mentioned his intent in any existing letter, he did write his brother Theo two weeks later, \\"That doesn't stop me having a terrible need for - dare I say the word - for religion. So I go outside at night to paint the stars and I always dream a painting like that with a group of living figures of the pals.\\" Night effects When exhibited for the first time, in 1891, the painting was entitled Coffeehouse, in the evening (Caf√©, le soir). This is the first painting in which he used starry backgrounds; he went on to paint star-filled skies in Starry Night Over the Rh√¥ne (painted the same month), and the better known The Starry Night a year later. Van Gogh also painted a starlight background in Portrait of Eug√®ne Boch. Van Gogh mentioned the Cafe Terrace painting in a letter written to Eug√®ne Boch on October 2, 1888, writing he had painted \\"a view of the caf√© on place du Forum, where we used to go, painted at night\\" (emphasis van Gogh's). The constellations are depicted with such fidelity to be able to precisely date the creation of the painting to 16-17 September 1888. In popular culture The painting and the caf√© were both featured in the 1956 film Lust for Life starring Kirk Douglas and later in \\"Vincent and the Doctor\\" (2010), the tenth episode in the fifth series of British science fiction television series Doctor Who, and in the fully painted film Loving Vincent (2017).

In archaeology, survey or field survey is a type of field research by which archaeologists (often landscape archaeologists) search for archaeological sites and collect information about the location, distribution and organization of past human cultures across a large area (e.g. typically in excess of one hectare, and often in excess of many km2). Archaeologists conduct surveys to search for particular archaeological sites or kinds of sites, to detect patterns in the distribution of material culture over regions, to make generalizations or test hypotheses about past cultures, and to assess the risks that development projects will have adverse impacts on archaeological heritage. The surveys may be: (a) intrusive or non-intrusive, depending on the needs of the survey team (and the risk of destroying archaeological evidence if intrusive methods are used) and; (b) extensive or intensive, depending on the types of research questions being asked of the landscape in question. Surveys can be a practical way to decide whether or not to carry out an excavation (as a way of recording the basic details of a possible site), but may also be ends in themselves, as they produce important information about past human activities in a regional context. A common role of a field survey is in assessment of the potential archaeological significance of places where development is proposed. This is usually connected to construction work and road building. The assessment determines whether the area of development impact is likely to contain significant archaeological resources and makes recommendations as to whether the archaeological remains can be avoided or an excavation is necessary before development work can commence. Archaeologists use a variety of tools when carrying out surveys, including GIS, GPS, remote sensing, geophysical survey and aerial photography. Research and planning Survey work may be undertaken in response to a specific threat (such as proposed or pending development project) to an area of known or unknown archaeological interest or as part of a program addressing specific research topics. In either case actual fieldwork is most likely to be preceded by a phase of desktop research (reviewing existing data in the form of maps, formal and informal written records, photographs and drawings) or in the modern age internet research using search engines, ancestry and birth or property records online. Consideration should be given to the nature of the landscape (vegetation coverage, existing settlement or industry, soil depth, climate) before a range of techniques is selected to be applied within an appropriate overarching method. Rationale An area may be considered worthy of surveying based on the following: *Artifacts found: Locals have picked up physical artifacts, sometimes held by the local museum but more often collected in private homes or old buildings such as churches and synagogues, and it is unclear where they are coming from. *Literary sources: Old literary sources have provided archaeologists with clues about settlement locations that have not been archaeologically documented. Sometimes the texts may be quite recent; for instance, a book on local history may mention an interesting area. *Oral sources: In many locations, local stories contain some hint of a greater past, and often they have a basis in history. For instance, someone may remember that a grandfather who used to walk the hills as a shepherd used to talk about columns from an old temple, although the descendant never saw the ruins. *Local knowledge: In many cases, locals know where to find something of interest to archaeologists. They may not have reported it because of taking it as part of their world, or because of fearing intrusions on their land or community. *Previous surveys: In some places, a past survey may have been recorded in an academic journal. The use of more recent technologies and finds from other sites may provide reason to re-examine the site. *Previous excavations: Excavations carried out before the middle of the 20th century are notoriously poorly documented. They were often carried out by methods that left behind much of the evidence the modern-day archaeologist is looking for. Early excavators were often interested only in fine pottery, jewelry and statues and referred to as rescue archaeologists. *Lack of knowledge: Many areas of the world have developed limited knowledge about the nature and organization of past human activity at the regional level. (Although one or more sites may be known from an area, often little is known about the wider distribution of contemporary settlements, and how settlement patterns may change over time.) An archaeological field survey is the primary tool for discovering information about previously uninvestigated areas. *Archaeological hypotheses: Some kinds of archaeological theories ‚Äî about changes in agricultural strategies or population density for example ‚Äî are investigated or tested through the use of archaeological surveys of areas that should or should not contain particular kinds of archaeological materials if the theory is true. Map regression Map regression, comparing maps from different periods of the same area, can reveal past structures that were recorded but are no longer visible as surface features. Using modern maps to transcribe or re-project earlier maps can help to locate these features with contemporary survey controls and techniques. Aerial photography Aerial photography is a good tool for planning a survey. Remains of older buildings often show in fields as cropmarks; just below the topsoil, the remains may affect the growth of crops or grass. There should preferably be photographs of the same area at different times of the year, allowing the analyst to find the best time to see cropmarks. Previous work in the region If the indicator that started the process was not a record of previous work, the archaeologists will need to check if any work has been done prior to commencement of the pending project. As many older surveys and excavations were published in papers that are not widely available, this may be a difficult task. A common way to handle this is through a visit to the area, to check with local museums, historians and older people who might remember something about the former activities in a particular locale. Permissions It is usually a simple matter to gain permission to perform a cultural field survey, especially a non-intrusive one. If the area is privately owned, the local laws may or may not require the landowners' co-operation. Permission for an intrusive form of survey may be more difficult to acquire, due to the fear of destroying evidence or property values and the threat of lawsuit for said damages from the property owner. Intrusive vs. non-intrusive surveys In a non-intrusive survey, nothing is touched, just recorded. An accurate survey of the earthworks and other features can enable them to be interpreted without the need for excavation. An intrusive survey can mean different things. In some cases, all artifacts of archaeological value are collected. This is often the case if it is a rescue survey, but less common in a regular survey. Another form of intrusive research is bore holes. Small holes are drilled into the ground, most often with hand-powered bores. The contents are examined to determine the depths at which one might find cultural layers, and where one might expect to strike virgin soil. This can be valuable in determining the cost of an excavation - if there is a build-up of several meters of soil above the layers the archaeologist is interested in, the price will obviously be much higher than if artifacts are found only centimeters below ground. Extensive vs. intensive survey One way to classify archaeological field surveys is to divide them into two types: intensive and extensive. The former is characterised by the complete or near-complete coverage of the survey area at a high resolution, most often by having teams of survey archaeologists walk in a systematic way (e.g. in parallel transects) over parcels of the landscape in question, documenting archaeological data such as lithics, ceramics and/or building remains. However, variations in artifact visibility related to topography, vegetation, and soil character, not to mention the imperfect detection abilities of human observers, bring into question the very concept of complete coverage. An extensive survey, on the other hand, is characterised by a low-resolution approach over targets within a study area (sometimes including hundreds of km¬≤). Sometimes this involves a random sampling or some other kind of probability sample to gain a representative sample of the study area. Extensive surveys may be designed to target the identification of archaeological sites across a large area, whereas intensive surveys are designed to provide a more comprehensive picture of the location of sites and the nature of off-site data (e.g. field systems, isolated finds, etc.). An intensive survey is the more costly, timely, and ultimately informative of the two approaches, although extensive surveys can provide important information about previously unknown areas. Purposive vs. sampling survey Archaeological field surveys can also be characterized as either purposive or sampling surveys. The former, sometimes also called \\"archaeological prospection\\", involves cases where archaeologists are searching for a particular site or a particular kind of archaeological material. For example, they might be searching for a particular shipwreck or an historic fort whose exact location is no longer certain. However, they may also be searching for archaeological materials in particular locations to test hypotheses about past use of those spaces. Sampling surveys, on the other hand, have the goal of obtaining a representative sample of some population of sites or artifacts in order to make generalizations about that population. This involves some probability sampling of spatial units, such as random or stratified random sampling of geometrical (often square) or irregular spatial units. Fieldwalking (transects) Conventionally, fieldwalking in grids or along lines called transects has formed the backbone of archaeological survey fieldwork, at least where visibility is fairly good. A single researcher or team will walk slowly through the target area looking for artifacts or other archaeological indicators on the surface, often recording aspects of the environment at the time. The method works best on either ploughed ground or surfaces with little vegetation. On ploughed surfaces, as the soil is turned regularly artifacts will move to the top. Erosion and soil loss on uncultivated and lightly vegetated soil (e.g., in semi-arid environments) may cause artifacts to also 'rise' to the surface. Even with optimal surface conditions the efficacy of fieldwalking varies according to long-term land use, topography, weather conditions, the skill and experience of the fieldwalkers, and other factors. Intensive arable agriculture on hilltops will first expose and then pulverize artifacts such as pottery and even chipped stone (typically flint, chert or obsidian) flakes. Conversely, the plateau and upper scarp or valley side soils will move down slope, forming a deep seal over low-lying archaeological deposits, rendering them inaccessible to surface survey. Even artifacts on the surface and with relatively high visibility (i.e., little obscuring vegetation), however, are not consistently detected by surveyors. Consequently, it is unrealistic to expect 100% recovery of artifacts or even sites. We can evaluate surveyors' effectiveness at detecting artifacts with \\"Sweep width,\\" which is the theoretical width of a transect in which the number of artifacts detected outside the sweep is identical to the number missed within the sweep. The poorer the visibility, the poorer the contrast between the artifact \\"targets\\" and their surroundings, or the poorer the surveyor's skill or attention, the narrower the sweep width will be. Modern technology such as GPS has made survey recording much easier, as positions of artifacts or artifact clusters (\\"sites\\") can be taken well within the limits of accuracy and precision necessary for survey work. Recording the position and attributes of archaeological features has been expedited by customizable portable computing interfaces or mobile Geographical Information Systems (GIS). Databases containing existing regional archaeological data as well as other landscape GIS layers such as soils, vegetation, modern features, and development plans can be loaded on a mobile GIS for referencing, for sampling purposes, and for groundtruth updating directly in the field, resulting a more informed archaeological survey process. Visible above- ground structures and Subsurface Testing Fieldwalking involves picking up scattered artefacts in ploughed fields. In heavily wooded areas such as Scandinavia or the North American Northeast, or deeply alluviated areas as in the Netherlands, fieldwalking is not always a practical method. Humus and fallen leaves in forested areas, silt on alluvial fans, or turf in built-up neighbourhoods may render near-surface artifacts and sites invisible even at short distances. In such instances, archaeological surveyors may concentrate on above-ground structures such as burial cairns, collapsed field walls and rock art panels, look for unnatural changes in the vegetation and landscape to decide what may be hidden under the vegetation, or survey by subsurface testing (SST). SSTs can consist of a series of shovel-test pits that penetrate the humus layer or turf or, where substantial later sediments may cover archaeological materials, series of auger or core holes. SSTs are much more costly than fieldwalking, and surveys by SST usually have very low probability of intersecting and detecting archaeological remains unless intensity (density of SSTs), and thus cost, is prohibitively high. The various Scandinavian sites and monuments registers mainly list above-ground monuments, not ploughed-out sites with scattered pottery. Narrowing it down Because of the high costs involved in some kinds of surveys, it is often helpful to use \\"predictive modelling\\" to narrow down the search for archaeological materials. This is particularly important for purposive surveys, but can also be used to guide sampling surveys by eliminating the need to survey areas where, for geological or other reasons, we can reasonably expect all ancient traces to be destroyed (e.g., by erosion) or far too deeply buried (e.g., by alluvium) to be detectable. Modern predictive models in archaeology employ Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Geophysical survey A geophysical survey is used for subsurface mapping of archaeological sites. In recent years, there have been great advances in this field, and it is becoming an increasingly useful and cost-effective tool in archaeology. Geophysical instruments can detect buried archaeological features when their electrical or magnetic properties contrast measurably with their surroundings. In some cases, individual artifacts, especially metal, may be detected as well. Readings taken in a systematic pattern become a dataset that can be rendered as image maps for interpretation. Survey results can be used to guide excavation and to give archaeologists insight into the patterning of non-excavated parts of the site. Unlike other archaeological methods, geophysical survey is not invasive or destructive. For this reason, it is often used where preservation (rather than excavation) is the goal for project preservation and compliance with applicable laws. The geophysical methods most commonly applied to archaeology are magnetometers, electrical resistance meters, ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic (EM) conductivity. These methods provide excellent resolution of many types of archaeological features, and are capable of high sample density surveys of very large areas and of operating under a wide range of conditions. While common metal detectors are geophysical sensors, they are not capable of generating high-resolution imagery. Other established and emerging technologies are also finding use in archaeological applications. Although geophysical surveying has been used in the past with intermittent success, good results are very likely when it is applied appropriately. It is most useful when it is used in a well-integrated research design where interpretations can be tested and refined. Interpretation requires a knowledge both of the archaeological record, and of the way it is expressed geophysically. Appropriate instrumentation, field survey design, and data processing are essential for success, and must be adapted to the unique geology and archaeological record of each site. In the field, control of data quality and spatial accuracy are critical to a successful mission completion. Analysis and evaluation The most important parts of the survey are analysis and evaluation. The types of questions that archaeologist often ask of survey data include: what is the evidence for first occupation of an area; when was this area occupied; how are sites distributed; where are sites located; what evidence is there for a settlement hierarchy; what sites are contemporary with each other; how has the modern landscape interfered with the visibility of archaeological remains; what sorts of activities can be recognized (e.g. dwellings, tombs, field systems); how many people lived in this area at any given time or how did population density change over time; why did people choose to live where they did; how has the landscape changed over time; what changes in settlement patterns have there been? However, answering such questions depends on the quality of the evidence, which is why it is important to evaluate the effectiveness and thoroughness of the survey or surveys that contribute that evidence. At times, one part of the survey may not have yielded the evidence one wanted to find. For instance, very little may have been found during a field walk, but there are strong indications from geophysical survey and local stories that there is a building underneath a field. In such a case, the only way to decide if an excavation is worth the cost is to carefully analyze the evidence to determine which part to trust. On the one hand, the geophysics might just show an old and forgotten water-pipe, but it might also show the wall of just the building the archaeologists were looking for. The analysis therefore includes careful examination of all the evidence collected. A method often used to determine its value is to compare it to sites of the same period. As the number of well-documented surveys grow, this becomes a slightly easier task, as it is sometimes easier to compare two survey results than to compare a survey result with an excavated site.

Henry of Bracton, also Henry de Bracton, also Henricus Bracton, or Henry Bratton also Henry Bretton (c. 1210 ‚Äì c. 1268) was an English cleric and jurist. He is famous now for his writings on law, particularly De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (\\"On the Laws and Customs of England\\") and his ideas on mens rea (criminal intent). According to Bracton, it was only through the examination of a combination of action and intention that the commission of a criminal act could be established. He also wrote on kingship, arguing that a ruler should be called king only if he obtained and exercised power in a lawful manner. In his writings, Bracton manages to set out coherently the law of the royal courts through his use of categories drawn from Roman law, thus incorporating into English law several developments of medieval Roman law.Stein (1999), p. 64. Life Bracton came from Devon and held circuit courts there. Plucknett describes Bracton in this way: \\"Two generations after Ranulf de Glanvill we come to the flower and crown of English jurisprudence ‚Äì Bracton.\\"Plucknett (1956), p. 258. Bracton was born around 1210 in Devon and had a great deal of preferment in the Church. He either derived from Bratton Fleming or Bratton Clovelly. Both villages are in Devon. It was only after his death that the family name appears as Bracton; during his life, he was known as Bratton, or Bretton. This originally may have been Bradton, meaning \\"Broad Town\\". Bracton first appeared as a justice in 1245. From 1248 until his death in 1268 he was steadily employed as a justice of the assize in the southwestern counties, especially Somerset, Devon and Cornwall. He was a member of the coram rege, also called the coram ipso rege, later to become the King's Court. He retired from this in 1257, shortly before the meeting of the Mad Parliament in 1258 at Oxford. It is unknown whether his retirement was related to politics. His leaving coincided with the onset of the notorious Second Barons' War in 1264. At that time Bracton was ordered to restore to the Treasury the large store of plea rolls (case records from previous trials) that had been in his possession. He was also forced to surrender the large number of rolls from his predecessors Martin Pateshull and William Raleigh, also known as William de Raley. It cannot be determined whether he disgraced the King or the barons in this affair, but it is speculated that some kind of political intrigue was involved. The practical result was that his major work, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (\\"The Laws and Customs of England\\"), was left unfinished. Even so, it exists in four large volumes today. He continued to follow the assizes in the southwest until 1267. In the last year of his life he filled another prominent role, as member of a commission of prelates, magnates and justices appointed to hear the complaints of the \\"disinherited\\" ‚Äì those who had sided with Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester.Pollock & Maitland (1956), pp. 206‚Äì210. Bracton apparently had access to the highest stations of Church and State. He was an ecclesiastic. In 1259 he became the rector of the Devonshire parish of Combe-in-Teignhead and in 1261, the rector of Bideford. In 1264 he was made the archdeacon of Barnstaple and in the same year, chancellor of Exeter Cathedral. In 1245 he enjoyed a dispensation enabling him to hold three ecclesiastical benefices. He was buried in the nave of Exeter Cathedral, in front of an altar bearing his name. He had established a chantry (a continuous set of prayers in perpetuity) for his soul that was endowed from the revenues of the Manor of Thorverton.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1953 edition, \\"Bracton\\"Plucknett (1956), pp. 258‚Äì265. Bracton chose the words of Ulpian (Pandects 1.1.1) to describe the legal profession: \\"Ius dicitur ars boni et aequi, cuius merito quis nos sacerdotes appellat: iusticiam namque colimus et sacra iura ministramus.\\" (Law is called the good and just art, whose priests we are deservedly called: for we worship Justice and minister the sacred laws.)Bracton f. 2b, 3 Ulpian was an influential Roman jurist in the second century, whose writings were revered in medieval Europe. Bracton felt himself to be, metaphorically, a priest of the law, \\"a priest forever in the order of Ulpian,\\" a playful allusion to the Melchizedek priesthood. Influences on Bracton ‚Äì Pateshull and Raleigh Two legal predecessors directly influenced Bracton. The first was Martin de Pateshull, one of John of England's clerks, who became justice of the bench in 1217, and in 1224 was one of the itinerant justices whom Falkes de Breaut√© attacked. Bracton esteemed Pateshull highly, and remarked, \\"In any list of regular justices, Pateshull's name so constantly precedes all others that he must have enjoyed some pre- eminence, though perhaps not of a definitive kind.\\"Bracton's Note Book I, 45 Pateshull was archdeacon of Norwich Cathedral and dean of St. Paul's Cathedral. His capacity for hard work was such that a brother justice asked Hubert de Burgh to excuse him from going on circuit with Pateshull on the ground that he wore out his colleagues by his incessant activity. Of his abilities as a lawyer, Bracton's appreciative citations speak eloquently. He appears to have gained his reputation as a lawyer, pure and simple. He died in 1229.Holdsworth (1922), p. 230. The second great influence on Bracton's thinking was William Raleigh, also known as William de Raley, a native of Devon. He was a resident in and around Bratton Fleming in 1212, when Bracton was born there. Raleigh was a justice of the bench in 1228. In 1234 he pronounced reversal judgment of Hubert de Burgh, 1st Earl of Kent's outlawry. Though he was not a justicier, he was regarded as the chief among judges. In 1237 he was appointed treasurer of Exeter Cathedral. He was elected to the See of Winchester in 1238 and passed from legal history. His election to this position was violently opposed by the King who favoured William of Valence. In 1239 Raleigh was elected to the See of Norwich. In 1244 he was elected to the See of Winchester for a second time. He died in 1250. He had much to do with the passage of the Statute of Merton. Raleigh defended the refusal of the barons to change the law of bastardy and legitimation. He invented the writ Quare ejecit infra terminum and was influential in the writing of several other novel writs. It is from Bracton that we get the majority of the history of the law at this time. Bracton is thought to have had a notebook with 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh. Raleigh granted lands to Bracton in Flemmings of Bratton who held it through his wife's family. Her name was Beaupre. Raleigh was Pateshull's clerk. Later, Bracton became Raleigh's clerk.Holdsworth (1922), p. 232. Bracton: cosmopolitan outlook Bracton was influenced by the Decretum of Gratian. Bracton imbued the courts of his day with a broad, Continental or cosmopolitan outlook. The incorporation of Roman Law began with Ranulf de Glanvill 140 years before. This is demonstrated in Leges Henrici Primi (Laws of Henry I). There is some controversy about the true nature of Bracton's Romanism. Henry Maine regarded Bracton as a complete fraud, who tried to pass off sheer Romanism as legitimate English law. For this, in his view, Bracton should be completely dismissed as a figure of substance in the formation of English law.Maine, H. \\"Ancient Law\\", chap. iv, 1861 Frederic William Maitland held the opposite view, positing that Bracton had no real knowledge of Roman law, and the portion which he did proclaim was incomplete and shallow.Maitland, F. \\"Bracton and Azo\\", Seldon Society, 1895Guterbock, Carl, \\"Bracton\\", 1861, translated by Brinton Coxe, 1866 These were of the opinion that most, if not all the Romanism of Bracton was derived directly from Azo of Bologna, written before 1211. It has proven to be difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of Romanism in Bracton.Kantorowizc, H. \\"Bractonian Problems\\", Glasgow, 1941 When England was conquered by the Normans in 1066, it came under the influence of the most progressive and best governed system in Europe. It also brought a connection with the entire intellectual life of the Continent that had been absent in the Anglo-Saxon days. Foreigners came to England to study. English youth attended European universities. The only English Pope in history, Pope Adrian IV was elected in 1154. This can be attributed to Norman influence. On the Continent in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, there was a renaissance in all learning, especially in legal concepts and writing. In Europe, Irnerius, the Four Doctors and Accursius revived the study of civil law. These established the school of the Glossators (writers of a \\"gloss\\" or short description of the case). Gratian systematised canon law. The Lombard Libri Feudorum and the French Beaumanoir reduced to some sort of order the customary feudal law of Europe. Ranulf de Glanvill and Bracton did this same thing for England, following the spirit of the Continent.Holdsworth (1922), p. 146. Bracton was influenced by an early 12th- century lawbook entitled Leges Edwardi Confessoris.Liebermann, vol. 1 pp. 627‚Äì672Thorpe, vol. 1, pp. 242‚Äì262Polock & Maitland (1956), pp. 81‚Äì82. It is a collection that purportedly recorded the laws and customs current in the time of Edward the Confessor at the behest of his successor William the Conqueror. William reorganised the land structure in a piecemeal fashion, following the reduction of resistance in various parts of England. His major lords were granted new titles of the land. But the Anglo-Saxon legal structure was left largely intact, including the traditional sheriff (shire reeve) and courts of shire and hundred. Maitland is of the opinion that the law of William I and his successors was biased in favour of all things West Saxon (Wessex) and the Church, while eschewing and denigrating all things Danelaw.Holdsworth (1922), p. 154. Bracton freely intermixes the Middle English terms such as sac (sake), soc (soke), toll and term, infangthef, utfangthef, thane, dreng, sokeman, hide, geld, hundred, wapentake, bote, wite and wer with Norman French terms such as baron, count, viscount, vavasor, villein, relief, homage, manor. Writings De legibus & consuetudinibus Angli√¶ (The Laws and Customs of England, 1569). Bracton's book was never completed because of the Second Barons' War De legibus Angliae, 13th-century manuscript, Wren Library, Cambridge. His written work, De Legibus et Consuetudinibus Angliae (The Laws and Customs of England), was composed primarily before c. 1235.Henry de Bracton. (2009). In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 17 March 2009, from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76746/Henry-de-Bracton Most of the text was likely written by William of Raleigh and was then passed along to Bracton, who was his clerk. Bracton's contribution was largely to update the text to include, for example, changes made in the provisions of Merton in 1236. However, the true nature of Bracton's work is not clear. Pollock, Maitland, and Plucknett credit the work more to Bracton and less to the influence of Raleigh. These scholars date the work to a later time, closer to 1260. The work was never completed. According to these authors, the Second Barons' War ended the writing.Paul Brand, \\"'The Age of Bracton'\\" in John Hudson, ed. The History of English Law: Centenary Essays on 'Pollock and Maitland' Bracton had access to (or actual possession of) many rolls of recorded law cases from the King's court. These were called plea rolls and were usually not publicly available. It is probable he was forced to surrender these before his book was finished. Even in its unfinished state, it is the most thorough English medieval law book. He also likely had access to the cases of Martin Pateshull and William Raleigh, his mentors in the law. A notebook containing 2000 cases from Pateshull and Raleigh has been deemed to be Bracton's. This book contains notes written in the margin that are in Bracton's handwriting. He incorporated the information from these cases in his book. Bracton also studied noted Italian lawyer Azo of Bologna. He was familiar with Corpus Iuris Civilis (Body of [Latin] Civil Law), the Decretum and the Decretals, as well as the works of the canonist Tancred of Bologna. He became familiar with, and an advocate of the Latin concept of Universal Law or Natural Moral Law, based on his reading of these sources. Bracton would have been familiar with the description of natural moral law applied in the Decretals:Decretals, Dist. v \\"The natural law dates from the creation of the rational creature. It does not vary with time, but remains unchangeable.\\" He also was familiar with Isidore of Seville or Isidorus Hispalensis (c. 570‚Äì636) who wrote of law: \\"In determining the nature of law, there must be three conditions: the fostering of religion, in as much as it is proportionate to the Divine law; that it is helpful to discipline, in as much as it is proportionate to the natural law; and that is further the common weal, in as much as it is proportionate to the utility of mankind.\\"Isidore of Seville, \\"Originum sive etymologiarum libri xx\\" Bracton used these works as a basis for his legal philosophy. Certain Latin terms, such as \\"corpus et animus\\" (body and soul) being necessary for possession under the law, are seen in Bracton that would appear to be ecclesiastical in origin. Based on Bracton's notes and writing, Pollock and Maitland believe that he was neither a courtly flatterer nor a champion of despotic monarchy. At other times, he may be accused of distorting: \\"sed et quod principi placuit.\\"Pollock & Maitland (1956), p. 209. Bracton's work became the basis for legal literature of Edward I of England. Gilbert Thornton, the chief justice of the king's bench made an epitome of it. This has been lost. The earliest mention of Roman Law in the Common Law of England is found in 1237‚Äì1238,Note Book 1227 in which a question of whether a palatinate can be partitioned among co-heirs. The justices could find no precedent for such a thing in English law, nor in the Magna Carta, nor in Roman Law (in iure scripto), therefore, they adjoined (delayed) their decision. In Bracton's time, it had been determined that the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was deemed to be a subject of the King of England while in England: Ricardus Rex Alemanniae (Rex Romanorum semper augustus) was impleaded for novel disseisin.Placit, Abbrev. p. 145 Bracton studied the form of the original writs. He procured, for his own use, complete transcripts of the pleadings in selected cases. These were used to write his treatise on the law. He was also the first to offer commentary on the cases he wrote about. In this way Bracton was modern; he criticised and praised various decisions. He called those who were a generation before him, his \\"masters\\". The cases he wrote about were at least twenty years older than his book. His writing is not like a modern legal treatise comparing case results. There is no concept of case law as one would find in a modern text book. He selected cases and wrote a general description of what the law should be in a given set of circumstances. There was no real stare decisis. He gave descriptions of what the decision should be in hypothetical fact situations, without mention of actual cases. He also included many sample writs for various situations. Bracton chose cases based on his admiration for the judges involved, and wanted to make exemplars of their logic. The inclusion of case law was important, because it was the first time this had occurred in English legal writing. Lawyers for two centuries (thirteenth and fourteenth centuries) were introduced to the concept of case law and legal logic by Bracton's book. A new and modern course was set. Later manuals, based on Bracton's example contained actual case law, with the captions removed. The ability to read actual cases and decisions, as well as the logic behind them was revolutionary in Bracton's time. The rolls from the court records would not have been available for inspection to anyone. His treatise changed this, forever. The ability to read cases, even if they were more than twenty years old, proved popular, leading directly to publication of the Year Books The first Year Book (compilations of court cases for the year) extant was published the year that Bracton died, 1268. Bracton on church and state=Common law and ecclesiastic courts During Bracton's time the common law was separate from the canon law of the Church. The former had come to mean all that was not exceptional or special. It was distinguished from Church law, as well as peculiar local customs and royal decrees, and represented the general law of the land. There were some legislative acts, such as the Statute of Merton (1236) and the Statute of Marlborough (1267), however the mass of new law introduced during the reign of Henry III of England, was by novel creative writs and new forms of action invented in the Court of Chancery and sanctioned by the common law courts. Bracton knew many writs that were unknown to Ranulf de Glanvill. It was generally perceived that there had to be a limitation on the number of new writs coming out of chancery, or the king would become an uncontrollable law-maker. Chancery was under the control of the Church and ecclesiastic lawyers.Stubbs, W. H., Select Charters and Illustrations of English Constitutional History, Clarendon Press, 1903Pollock & Maitland (1956) Writs for calling religious clergy to royal courts Bracton was concerned with the interaction of Church and State. Since the time of the Norman Conquest, the relation between church and state was always tendentious. There were two parallel legal systems, one under the aegis of the church, the other under the crown, that continuously vied for jurisdiction and power. Bracton gave samples of writs that could be used in the case of a recalcitrant Bishop who refused to produce a witness for the common law or king's court. These indicate difficulties in defining jurisdiction, as well as recalcitrance on the part of Church officials to partake in civil and common law matters outside the Church court structure. Example 1: \\"Henry by the grace of God, etc. to the venerable Father in Christ \\"B\\", by the same grace bishop of London, greeting. We order you to cause to come before our justices etc. at such a day, such an archdeacon, to answer [the questions proposed in] \\"C\\", with respect to such a plea [as stated above], etc. And then let this clause be added: \\"as to whom our sheriff of Middlesex has sent word to our aforementioned justices that the aforementioned archdeacon (or such other clerk) has refused to find pledges and has no lay fee by which he can be destrained. And have this writ [brought with you]. Witnesses signed, etc. If the bishop does nothing with regard to the king's order, let the enrolment then be as follows: 'A' offered himself on the fourth day against 'B' with respect to such a plea, and 'B' did not come, and at another time the sheriff was ordered to attach him, and the sheriff sent word that he was a clerk, etc., whereupon such a bishop was ordered to cause him to come and to send the writ, who did nothing therein. Therefore let the bishop be summoned to appear on such a day and to have there the aforementioned 'B' to answer the aforementioned 'A' as to why etc. as described in the original writ, and offer an explanation why he ignored the original order to appear.\\"Bracton, Vol. 4, p. 374 Example 2: \\"The king to the sheriff, greeting. Summon 'F' bishop of London by good summoners to be before the aforesaid justices on such a day, etc. And show why he did not cause him to come forward [in accord with the order in the previous writ].\\" Example 3: \\"The king to the sheriff, greeting, We order you to distrain 'F', bishop of London, by the lands that he holds in barony in your county, to appear before the justices, etc., on such a day and to have there such a clerk to answer to such a one with respect to such a plea etc. and also to have such a clerk to answer to such a one with respect to such a plea, etc., and also to hear his judgment because he did not have the aforesaid clerk on such a day as he was ordered. And have, etc. If neither the bishop nor the clerk come forward on that day, let action be taken against the bishop for contempt, by counsel of the court, and lest the misdeeds remain unpunished, let the king, on the bishop's default, apply his hand, by virtue of his jurisdiction, that the clerk be arrested and held until the bishop claims him, that he either be delivered to him or remain arrested, nor will the sheriff or his bailiffs incur any penalty on that account since execution of the law involves no wrong. For even a bishop and those higher still may be arrested for injuries and crimes. A bishop could expel with impunity a thief who had fled to a church and not be guilty of irregularity, if the thief refused to come out and stand to the judgment of the king and the kingdom. For the sword ought to aid the sword, and thus there are two swords, the spiritual and the temporal.\\"Bracton vol. 4, p. 375 Bracton on the King of England Bracton on the King of England: ‚ÄúThe king has a superior, namely, God. Also the law by which he was made king. Also his curia, namely, the earls and barons, because if he is without a bridle, that is without law, they ought to put the bridle on him.‚Äù Bracton, vol 2, p. 110 \\"The king has no equal within his realm. Subjects cannot be the equals of the ruler, because he would thereby lose his rule, since equal can have no authority over equal, not a fortiori a superior, because he would then be subject to those subjected to him. The king must not be under man but under God and under the law, because the law makes the king . . . for there is no rex where will rules rather than lex.\\"Bracton, vol 2, p. 33 Papal supremacy asserted Pope Innocent III represented the absolute zenith of papal power in the Middle Ages. Among the many reforms he established was the banning of any ecclesiastic to have income from more than one church or parish. Bracton had received a dispensation to receive the proceeds from three. This indicates his special position within the Church political structure. Innocent III exercised more power than any of his predecessors, or his successors. He famously placed England under interdict during the reign of John of England. During and after the Fourth Lateran Council, Innocent III proclaimed that all tithes to the Church should take precedence over any taxes imposed by a state. This was controversial. He also excluded all lay interference (including matters of civil and criminal law). He affirmed the right of Rome to review any and all important legal cases. This made appeal to the Pope more attractive and easier to obtain than in previous generations. He gave the Chancery an improved and more efficient organisation. All this occurred in the generation before Bracton, and still was rancorous in his time.Latourette, K. \\"A History of Christianity\\", Eyre and Spottiswoode Ltd, London, 1955 pp. 483‚Äì486 It has been argued and unsettled whether any English Churchman in the 13th century would have disputed that the Pope was the head of the Universal Church. It was admitted that the canon law of the great councils was binding upon all members of the Church. Bracton, being both a lawyer and a cleric wrote of the Pope \\"in spiritualibus super omnibus habet ordinariam jurisdictionem\\" (In spiritual things he has an ordinary jurisdiction over all men in his realm.) Not only was the Pope a law giver, but he was also a judge, and in his Curia, could enforce his decrees. Papal legislation was defined and circumscribed by \\"ius divinium et naturale\\" ‚Äì law divine and natural.Kirkalfy (1962), p. 212. Dying intestate The issue of dying intestate (without a will) attracted the attention of Bracton. The Church had long asserted the role of interpreting wills. If a person died without making a last will and testament, it was tantamount to dying without making a last confession. Bracton wrote: \\"nullam enim meretur poenam quis, quamvis decedat intestatus.\\"Bracton, f. 60b There was a notion that dying without a will, while not exactly a sin, was often God's judgment on sin. To die intestate was to die unconfessed. The law of \\"personal property\\" became divorced from the law of \\"real property\\" by this, and remains so to this day.Pollock & Maitland (1956), p. 128. Contract and the writ of prohibition The development of contract law began in the Church courts, following Roman law. These courts claimed (with some validity) to enforce all promises made by oath, or by \\"pledge of faith\\". The man who pledges his faith, or on his soul, arguably has pawned his soul, and in so doing, has left his salvation to actions of another. Henry II of England asserted his jurisdiction over such cases. Thomas Becket claimed concurrent jurisdiction for the Church. Henry won. From that time onward, the royal court was always at the ready to prohibit ecclesiastical judges from entertaining a breach of faith, unless both parties were clerks (church clerics) or the matter lay outside the realm of the temporal. The method was to issue a writ of prohibition, prohibiting the church court from hearing and ruling on the case. The practice developed whereby a contractor would seek relief in a church court and renounce all right to a writ of prohibition. Sometimes the litigant would not receive the decision he wanted in the ecclesiastic court, and then would renounce his pledge, and seek a writ of prohibition from the common law court. Bracton explained that it was a terrible sin to seek a writ of prohibition when one had promised not to seek one. This was a crime that deserved imprisonment.Bracton f. 401b, 402 Jurisdiction over such matters, as well as marriages and wills remained contentious in Bracton's day.Pollock & Maitland (1956), p. 129. Frankalmoign and the writ of prohibition In Bracton's time, the question frequently arose about land held in frankalmoign (land donated to the Church). Writs were common prohibiting Church courts from meddling into the title of land, even if it were to be held in frankalmoign. The question was that of lay fee, which was the equivalent of secular lands, even though it may have been held in free, pure and perpetual alms.Statute 13 Edward 1, c. 24 Bracton posited that land which is sacred (housing Churches and the like) was within the jurisdiction of the Church. To this could be added lands donated in the form of a dower.Bracton f. 407 A glance of the plea rolls demonstrates them to be covered with writs of prohibitions directed at ecclesiastical judges in a continuous battle over jurisdiction of Church lands.Bracton f. 412, ff.Pollock & Maitland (1956), p. 251. Despite these problems, Pollock and Maitland comment that by the end of the reign of Henry III of England, the royal and church courts functioned in relative harmony, despite certain disputes over jurisdiction.Pollock & Maitland (1956), p. 479. Modern liability traced through Bracton Modern liability can be traced from ancient Anglo-Saxon law through the time of Bracton. From Alfred the Great: \\"A man acts at his own peril. If a man have a spear over his shoulder, and any man stakes himself upon it, that man will pay the wer but not the wite... if he be accused of wilfulness in the deed, let him clear himself according to the wite, and with that, let the wite abate. And let this be: if the point be three fingers higher than the hindmost part of the shaft; if they both be on the level, the point of the hindmost part of the shaft, be that without danger. If a man leaves his arms about, and another knocks them over so that they kill or injure a man, the owner is liable. If a man lend his horse to another and the borrower is injured, the lender is liable.\\"Ine c. 42; Alfred c. 24 This is similar to the modern concept of strict liability in tort. Liability, at that time, was not dependent upon negligence, but the act.Holdsworth, W. \\"A History of English Law\\", vol. 2, p. 52. A Borough Customs proclaimed that a defendant must swear an oath that he had done nothing to a slain person that had put him \\"nearer to death than from life.\\"Borough Customs S. S. ii, xl Ancient law could not discuss the question of intent because it had no mechanism to do so. Offences that were not criminal could be made the ground for appeal of homicide, if they could be put forward as conducing, however indirectly, to death. This idea persisted to the time of Bracton. An oath was required of a man accused of a homicide. Judge Brian wrote in 1466 (200 years after Bracton): \\"In my opinion, if a man does a thing he is bound in such a manner that by his deed no injury or damage is inflicted on others. As in the case where I erect a building, and when the timber is being lifted a piece of it falls upon the house of my neighbor and bruises his house, he will have a good action, and that, although the erection of my house was lawful and the timber fell without my intent. Similarly, if a man commits an assault upon me and I cannot avoid him if he wants to beat me, and I lift my stick in self-defense in order to prevent him, and there is a man behind me, although my lifting my stick was lawful to defend myself and I injured him without intent [he would have a cause of action against me].\\"Anonymous King's Bench, 1466, Year Book 5 Edward IV, f. 7, pl 18Prosser, W., Wade, J., and Schwartz, V., \\"Torts\\", University Casebook Series, Foundation Press, 1982 In the laws of Cnut the Great it was said that concerning stolen property, an infant was as guilty as if he had discretion. Under Henry I of England, \\"The man whose conduct has only remotely caused death or injury is liable, it is true, but 'in hiis et similibus, ubi homo aliud intendit et aliud evenit, ubi opus accusatur non-voluntas, venialem pocius emendacionem, et honrificenciam judices statuant, sicut acciderit'\\"Leg. Henry 90, II The man who has killed by misadventure or in self-defense is liable to pay the wer but his wrong is emenable.Holdsworth, W. \\"History of English Law\\" vol. 2, Methuen & Co. Ltd. p. 53 Under Henry I of England \\"who sins unwittingly shall knowingly make amends\\" though the lunatic and infant were not liable in criminal acts, which was a change from Anglo-Saxon law. Bracton wrote of homicide, \\"the crime of homicide, be it either accidental or voluntary, does not permit of suffering the same penalty, because on one case the full penalty must be exacted and in the other there should have been mercy.\\" It is the first signs of discrimination in the law leading to the development of the concept of mens rea (a guilty mind being necessary to be guilty of a crime). Bracton stressed the animus furendi in theft, that is the intention to steal. Felony is according to intent, a concept that has its foundations in Bracton.Kirkalfy (1962), p. 357. Other examples from Bracton's book=Sanctuary and abjuration If a criminal could make it to a church, he was given sanctuary. This was a recognition that the Church was a separate jurisdiction. Some law allowed for the criminal to be housed and fed by the clergy for seven days. Bracton recommends 40 days. After this, the reeve would knock on the door of the church and demand that the criminal surrender himself or take the shortest road to a seaport and leave England never to return. If he did not leave the church, he was to be starved. If the criminal stayed on the road to the seaport, he was to be left unharmed. If he went off the road, he could be killed by the population at large. Condemned criminals and those found with stolen goods were not to be given sanctuary. The wife of such was declared a widow and all lands owned by him were escheated to the Crown.Kirkalfy (1962), p. 364. Bracton on the writ of appeal \\"In every criminal case, which embraces a felony, [the writ] must mention on the appeal the year, the place, the day and the hour in which the case is heard. [The defendant] must speak of his own accord, and sight and hearing, and must be consistent in what he says and in all circumstantial details. [It should be written like this]: 'A' appeals 'B', by such words for the death of his brother and should he fail, by such a one, and so on, so that there are several appealing him to one and the same deed.\\" Equity Bracton wrote of equity (circa 1258) that it required in equal causes an even- handed justice and a true equality in all things.Bracton f., 3a This appears to have been taken directly from Azo's \\"Gloss of Roman Law\\".Maitland VIII, S. S. p. 23Holdsworth (1922), p. 570. Executor of an estate The executor of an estate could only sue in ecclesiastical courts. At law it was the heir who had to be sued. This was changed in the time of Edward I of England, allowing that he sue in the common law courts.Bracton, f. 407bHoldsworth (1922), p. 554. Murder fines The reason for devising the murder-fine was this: in the days of Cnut the Great, King of the Danes, when at the prayer of the English barons he sent his army back to Denmark after he had conquered and pacified England, the barons of England offered themselves as sureties to the said King Cnut that, whatever the force the king kept with him in England they would have form peace in all things so that, if anyone of the English should slay any of the men whom the king kept with him and that man could not make his defence against the charge by the judgment of God, that is by water and iron, justice would be done upon him. If he fled away and could not be arrested they would pay on his behalf sixty-six marks, to be collected in the village where he was slain, because the inhabitants did not produce the slayer. And if the marks could not be collected because of poverty, they would be collected in the hundred for deposit in the king's treasury.Bracton, vol. 2 p. 379 This represents a curious anachronism, since trial by ordeal (\\"water and iron\\") had been outlawed in England by the Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. (See subpoena ad testificandum for details.) Influence Bracton was chancellor of Exeter Cathedral, where he is buried. The reign of King John of England (1199‚Äì1216) was a time of great turmoil that produced, among other things, Magna Carta and the Papal interdict of Pope Innocent III against John. Henry III of England (1216‚Äì1272) was a child of nine years when he ascended the throne. A few great nobles, encouraged by Pope Honorius III (1216‚Äì1227) spared the nation the turmoil that would have been expected when a child becomes king. Henry de Bracton arose as one of the greatest judges of all time during the middle part of the reign of Henry III. His case books would soon dwarf even the great work of Ranulf de Glanvill in both quantity and quality.Plucknett (1956), p. 20. The Barons' War against Henry III began in 1258 with similar grievances as the previous revolt against King John in 1215. The Barons aimed to reduce the King's power, but they failed as they also had in 1215. An indirect result of this war was that Bracton failed to complete his great legal treatise. The forms of action in trespass \\"vi et armis\\", among other forms of action in trespass and seisin were developed at this time. The phrase of Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester was, \\"Wars are the result of extra-judicial distress.\\" This is an important observation to understand the time of Bracton. The use of war was another tool, beside the rule of law, for the powerful to attain their ends. The barons' grievances resulted in the Statute of Marlborough in 1267.Plucknett (1956), p. 26. Plucknett writes \\"It was the mediaevalists in England, armed with Bracton and the Year Books who ended Stuart statecraft. The Constitution of the United States was written by men who had Magna Carta and Bracton, and Coke and Littleton before their eyes. Could anything be more medieval than the idea of due process or the insertion in an instrument of government a contract clause? 'Pacta sunt servanda' (Pacts should be kept) became a motto of Edward I.Plucknett (1956), p. 40. The result can be traced directly to the work and writings of Bracton. It was Machiavelli who gave us the modern word \\"state\\" and fleshed it out to our present conception of it. In Bracton's time a state was defined by a king, based on the rule of law, which ultimately must end in and lead to the will of God. This is different today. The right is based on the will of the state.Plucknett, T., \\"Words\\", Cornell Law Quarterly, xiv. 263‚Äì273Dowdall, \\"The Word 'State'\\", Law Quarterly Review, xxxix, 98 Bracton was popular in his day. Several contemporaneous copies of his book are still in existence. However, several scholars, including Plucknett and Holdsworth believe that few actually followed Bracton's doctrine as defined by his writings. The growth of procedure overwhelmed the general (and genial) view and wide learning of Bracton. For a time, he fell completely out of favour. The printing press restored Bracton to prominence in English legal literature. The edition published in 1569 was described by PlucknettPlucknett (1956), p. 263. as \\"...perhaps the best printed law book we have ever had.\\" Bracton's work appeared at an important time during the reign of Queen Elizabeth. Bracton's liberal interpretation of the law (as expressed in portions of his book) were slow in taking root in English law. The decline of Bracton's influence in the middle of the fourteenth century coincides with Parliament's first assertions of its powers. Already, it had come to be the principal and only legislative body, and the dominant interest in it was that of the common law lawyers. This had become a narrow profession. The Crown adopted the practice of appointing judges from the leading practitioners of the bar. These also controlled legal education. There was no liberal outlook on the law. To these, Bracton's treatise must have seemed impractical and academic. Justice became more centralised.Plucknett (1956), pp. 264‚Äì265. Prior to Bracton, there was little use of stare decisis. This was because the rolls containing the court records were largely unavailable for scrutiny, even by judges sitting on the bench. Bracton's use of the rolls led to promulgation of recorded cases in the form of a gloss. This had been an important innovation based on the glossator's practice from the Continent. The availability of previous decisions, even if 20 or more years old proved to be of great interest to nearly all practitioners of the law. This led directly to the Year Books. A single unique decision did not make precedent. Custom began to be dictated when several cases of similar fact pattern were decided by different courts in the same way. This was the beginning of stare decisis.Plucknett (1956), pp. 342‚Äì345. Sir Thomas Smith, the Secretary of State for Queen Elizabeth wrote \\"De Republica Anglorum\\" in 1583. In it he set forth the truly fearful powers of the Crown and Parliament, which can make and unmake law, change rights and possessions of private men, legitimate bastards, establish religions, condemn or absolve (by attainders) whomever the Prince wills. Smith was no advocate of tyranny, but he clearly enjoyed enumerating an imposing list of powers of the Tudor state. In Bracton, on the other hand, the emphasis was not upon the power of the Crown, but in responsibility. The monarch was subject to God, to the law of the land, and to his feudal court. In Bracton, the king owed some responsibility to listen to his lords. (Recall that Bracton had observed and experienced the turmoil from the Barons' War, and lived in the backwash of the problems of John.) Bracton's writings became a de facto antidote to the absolutism of the Tudors and the Stuarts. Bracton brought an air of clarity, from his study of Roman order, to the confusion that followed the English Reformation. The anonymous re-publisher of Bracton recommends him as worthy of emulation, since the other books of the day were \\"indigesta confusio\\". The law under Elizabeth was medieval. The trend of the day was toward Romanism. Bracton was popular in the time of Elizabeth because he was available through the printing press. In later times, he was read because he was Roman. He was popular because he was medieval. Bracton was commonly read by lawyers in Great Britain's American colonies in the 18th century,Imogene Brown, American Aristides: A Biography of George Wythe (Fairleigh Dickinson Univ.

Evans Biography and Photograph Collection at the University of Utah Biography Evans was born in Salt Lake City. He attended the University of Utah and studied electrical engineering; he earned his Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1949 and his Doctorate in Physics in 1953. Evans first worked at the Bendix aviation electronics company, where he acted as project manager in 1955 to develop what some describe as an early personal computer that ran on an interpretive operating system. The Bendix G-15 was a bulky unit about the size of a two-door refrigerator. He stayed with the company just long enough to manage the G-20 project. Evans became a faculty member of the University of California, Berkeley. His first important work with graphics dates from that period, when he did several experiments on an IDIOM display hooked up to a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-5. In 1963, he was co-Principal Investigator (with Harry Huskey) for project Genie to produce an early multi-user timesharing system. Students from this period include Butler Lampson and L. Peter Deutsch. The system, which included key developments in the field of virtual memory, was sponsored by the US Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency. In 1965, the University of Utah recruited him back to start their own computer science department. When he was building up the University of Utah department in 1968 he managed to convince Ivan Sutherland (who had funded Evans' DARPA research) to come to Utah, accepting the condition that they start a computer graphics company together. Evans retired from the company in 1994. Evans's students at Utah included Alan Kay, Edwin Catmull, James H. Clark, John Warnock, Alan Ashton, Frank Crow, Jim Blinn, Bui Tuong Phong, Gary Hodgman, and Henri Gouraud. Evans was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He served as a branch president, a counselor in bishoprics and stake presidencies, and as a scout master for a total of 27 years.Church News, October 26, 1996. Evans was awarded the Silver Beaver for his role in scouting. Evans married Joy Frewin. They had ten children, only seven of which lived to adulthood. One of these is David F. Evans, who became a general authority in the LDS Church. From 1984 to 1990, Joy Evans was a counselor in the general presidency of the Relief Society to Barbara W. Winder. At the time of his death on October 12, 1998, Evans had 39 living grandchildren and great grandchildren. In 1996, Brigham Young University established the David C. Evans Chair of Computer Engineering and Graphics. Evans was at the ceremony where the founding of a chair in his honor was announced, but due to his suffering from Alzheimer's disease, did not make any remarks at the ceremony.

He was a prominent figure in the English Mod subculture of the early 1960s. He is sometimes referred to as the \\"Mod Father\\" or \\"Mod God\\"; either way his influence has left a mark on the Mod subculture. Life and career Meaden was born to Stanley and Rosina Meaden (n√©e Alexander) on 11 November 1941. He had one brother, Gerald. As a teenager, Meaden worked in a restaurant before embracing the mod subculture and establishing himself as a face (a trend- setter within the mod scene). Meaden was involved with Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones, and was roommates with Mick Jagger. He was often seen around The Scene, a night club in Ham Yard, Soho, London. Meaden was business partner to Andrew Oldham, who was for a while the Rolling Stones manager. Meaden also managed the band Arrows in the early 1970s. After becoming manager of The Who, Meaden reinvented the band to attract a mod following, changing their name to The High Numbers. He wrote The High Numbers' first and only single, \\"I'm the Face\\"; the B-side of which was \\"Zoot Suit\\". The songs are set to the tunes of \\"Got Love If You Want It\\" by Slim Harpo and \\"Misery\\" by the Dynamics, respectively. Meaden wrote new lyrics, incorporating mod-related themes such as fashion and dancing. The single didn't become a hit, and most of the copies that sold were bought by Meaden in a chart fix. After losing control of the band, he went on to manage Jimmy James & The Vagabonds, and worked as a publicist for the Crystals, Chuck Berry and the Rolling Stones. In January 1968, Meaden briefly represented the American rock musician Captain Beefheart and his group the Magic Band. The group was visiting London for their first United Kingdom performances. Because Meaden had not obtained the necessary work permits in advance, the musicians were detained at customs and denied entry to the country. After temporarily returning to Germany the group was able to work out their immigration status and return to Britain a few days later. By that time they had severed their relationship with Meaden. This incident is fully detailed in the 2002 book Captain Beefheart: The Biography. After years of drug abuse and a nervous breakdown, Meaden died at his parents' home in Edmonton, London, of a barbiturate overdose in 1978. He is buried in Southgate cemetery, North London, and his funeral was fully paid for by the Who, even though they were unable to attend. Three years before his death he gave an interview with Steve Turner of NME, in which he made the legendary quote, \\"Modism, Mod living, is an aphorism for clean living under difficult circumstances.\\" Meaden's parents are also deceased, but he is survived by a brother, Gerald, who lives in Brighton.

The old 12th-century 278x278px Kingsbury is a large village and civil parish in the North Warwickshire district of the county of Warwickshire, in the West Midlands region of England. The civil parish population at the 2011 census was 7,652. The village is situated between Birmingham and Tamworth, which is to the north, and overlooks the River Tame. The A51 to Chester starts from here; as does the A4097, which runs through Curdworth and Minworth before joining the A38. This continues to Junction 6 of the M6 (Spaghetti Junction) giving access to the motorway network of the Midlands and the City of Birmingham. Kingsbury is notable for the Kingsbury Water Park, a shooting range and a large oil storage depot to the north-east. The church of SS Peter and Paul dates from the 12th century and is a grade II* listed building. History The name Kingsbury is derived from the Saxon Chinesburie meaning 'royal fortified house' or 'Kings Fort'. The 'bury' part of the name means 'fort' or 'defensive work'. The location of the church and remains of a medieval home (Kingsbury Hall) above the river suggest a good location for a 'defensive' work. Kingsbury Hall (or Bracebridge Hall as it was their family home for many years) is now only part lived in as a farmhouse. It was a fortified manor house and the remains of a curtain wall can still be seen. Kingsbury was founded by the same Angles tribe that established Curdworth and Minworth. The village is mentioned in the Domesday survey. Two priests are recorded, so the church must have existed. So is Hemlingford Mill, which still exists. It was originally a water mill, used for many purposes including milling corn into flour and grinding gun barrels for muskets during the Napoleonic Wars. Later it was used as a garden centre. A bridge was built across the River Tame near to the mill in 1783. This was single carriageway so traffic lights were installed later on, until it was bypassed by a new road to serve the oil terminal in the 1960s. The centre section of the old bridge was swept away by a flash flood in the early 1980s and was replaced with modern concrete. It is now used for pedestrians only. In 1473‚Äì74 during the Wars of the Roses there was a family dispute involving the Bracebridges and their distant relations, the Ardens (William Shakespeare's maternal ancestors) of Park Hall in Castle Bromwich. John Arden had fallen in love with Alice Bracebridge. John's father, Sir Walter, did not approve. John was kidnapped and taken to Bracebridge Hall. Sir Walter appealed to King Edward IV, who appointed Sir Simon de Montford of Coleshill and Sir Richard Bingham of Middleton to arbitrate. John and Alice were married in February 1474. In 1502 John inherited Park Hall in Castle Bromwich, while his younger brother Thomas settled at Wilmcote near Stratford-upon-Avon. Thomas had a son Robert who was the father of Mary Arden, William Shakespeare's mother. The stones of the church porch show evidence of arrow-sharpening grooves, sometimes said to have been done by soldiers but more probably by hunting parties or locals waiting their turn for the nearby village butts, as all males had to be proficient with a longbow. In 1686, Thomas Coton established one of the first poor schools in Kingsbury. Until the 19th century Kingsbury was a small hamlet, and the main landowner in the area was the Prime Minister Sir Robert Peel. The Birmingham and Derby Railway was built through Kingsbury in 1839 and industry was soon established, most notably coal mining and gravel extraction, which fuelled the expansion of the village. Governance The village of Kingsbury forms part of a larger civil parish of the same name which includes the nearby settlements of Hurley, Hurley Common, Piccadilly and Wood End. In the 2001 census, the parish had a population of 7,523. The urban area of Kingsbury village itself had 4,168 inhabitants. Kingsbury today The mine, Kingsbury Colliery, has now gone and the railway station was closed in 1968 under the Beeching cuts. although the station building has gone, the station master's house (built by LMS in 1926) still exists alongside the site. The large oil storage depots, which serve the whole of the Midlands, were established in the late-1960s to the north-east of Kingsbury. Kingsbury Water Park, which is situated between Kingsbury and Bodymoor Heath, is a series of 15 lakes, situated in of land. It was reclaimed from the old gravel pits. It is now home to a camp site, children's play areas, a sailing club, model boat club and jet ski and power boat racing clubs. Kingsbury is now mainly a large commuter village. Although relatively small, the village has facilities and services including a primary school, a secondary school, a swimming pool (situated at the secondary school but open to the public), two public houses, the Swan and the Royal Oak, a country club, churches, a doctors' surgery and shops. Its population is close to 8000 inhabitants and is frequently referred to as a small town rather than a village.

In 2019, the festival is set to be held for the 50th time. In 2015, 1700 students did volunteer work, while 90,000 event tickets were sold. The name \\"UKA\\" translates to \\"the week\\", although it now lasts for the better part of a month, with events including concerts, theatre, seminars and more. History Festival area of UKA 2015 UKA was established in 1917 by students studying at the Norwegian Institute of Technology (NTH, now part of NTNU) in an attempt to improve the financial situation within the students' community in Trondheim. In 1917 the festival mainly consisted of a revue, which was arranged every other year except the mid-war years. Starting with scarce resources UKA has been in constant growth and is today the largest Norwegian cultural festival with more concerts and entertainment than ever before. Although the festival now features big-name artists, the organizers still consider revue, UKErevyen, as the \\"heart\\" of the festival. Volunteer work It may seem hard to believe, but Norway's largest cultural festival is run entirely by volunteers, from top to bottom. Trondheim's tradition for volunteer work is well known, and a trademark for UKA. In 2009, 1400 volunteers made sure everything ran smoothly. 6500 spectators jumped up and down in Death Valley, 90 000 litres of beer were sold during the festival, activities spanning from juggling courses to crime night to wrestling were held in Death Valley and The Student Society in Trondheim, and commercial partners contributed with events like ‚ÄúUKA robot challenge‚Äù, where the contesters competed in building and programming Lego robots. The festival itself is a celebration of intellectual prowess and passionate commitment shown by the students. Consisting mainly of students recruited from Trondheim, the main audience is young people within the proximity of the city. There are events and lectures however, that targets a more mature audience, such as UKErevyen. Names Every UKErevyen revue is given a name, which also becomes the name of the entire festival. The name is decided by the writers and is a well-kept secret all the way up to the opening of the festival and the play, and only a handful people outside of the writers' collegium knows it before it's officially revealed. This is a big event where the name is physically uncovered at midnight in front of the student society, with several thousand attendants. The writers aren't entirely free in choosing the name either. A more or less strict set of rules applies, never written down, but followed from one festival to the next. The most important ones are that the name should consist of three syllables, and that it should have several meanings, either in splitting up the word(s) or rearranging the letters. The rules aren't always followed, as seen with the name of UKA-03; Glasur, that had only two syllables. It did, however, supply different interpretations, first of all with the word itself, meaning glaze, then \\"Gla' sur\\" which means \\"happy sad\\", and \\"gla'rus\\" (a rush of happiness). UKA-05 restored the rule of three syllables with the name Origo.

It has evolved into various styles and silhouettes, including the \\"letterman\\" jacket and the fashionable \\"bomber\\" jacket that is known today. The flight jacket= Early history  World War I Richard Byrd in flight jacket, 1920s In World War I, most airplanes did not have an enclosed cockpit, so pilots had to wear something that would keep them sufficiently warm. The U.S. Army officially established the Aviation Clothing Board in September 1917 and began distributing heavy-duty leather flight jackets; with high wraparound collars, zipper closures with wind flaps, snug cuffs and waists, and some fringed and lined with fur. World War II B-17 bomber in WWII Leslie Irvin first designed and manufactured the classic sheepskin flying jacket. In 1926 he set up a manufacturing company in the United Kingdom, and became the main supplier of flying jackets to the Royal Air Force during most of World War II. However, the demand during the early years of the war was so great that the Irvin company engaged subcontractors, which explains the slight variations of design and colour that can be seen in early production Irvin flying jackets. As aerospace technology improved, the altitudes at which aircraft operated increased. Some heavy bombing raids in Europe during World War II took place from altitudes of at least 25,000 ft, where ambient temperatures could reach as cold as ‚àí50 ¬∞C (‚àí58 ¬∞F). The cabins of these aircraft were uninsulated, so a warm, thick flight jacket was an essential piece of equipment for every member of the crew.  Flight jackets in the United States  The two most historical American flight jackets are the A-2 jacket and the G-1. Although General ‚ÄúHap‚Äù Arnold cancelled the original A-2 after twelve years because he wanted \\"something better\\", the A-2 remains the most recognizable and sought- after American flight jacket. The G-1, designed by the U.S. Navy to parallel the Air Corps‚Äô A-2, lasted until 1978, when U.S. Congress cancelled it due to its tremendous popular appeal, which was overwhelming the Navy's supply system. Their popularity evolved into symbols of honor, adventure, and style. Hollywood films like Top Gun boosted sales of the G-1 tremendously, making bomber jackets collector and fashion items. In addition to the A-2 and G-1 jackets, shearling jackets, originally lined with fur, are recognized for being the warmest flight jackets. Even when the fur was replaced with wool, this coat was warm enough to keep Lt. John A. Macready warm when he set a world record in April 1921, reaching an altitude of 40,000 feet in his open- cockpit airplane. Styles range from the B-3 \\"bomber jacket\\", to the M-445, the U.S. Navy's shearling jacket. Also popular in the military were, and still are, synthetic jackets. These jackets first gained esteem after General Hap Arnold rejected the A-2 jacket in 1942. Styles range from the cotton twill B-series to the standardized jacket of the U.S. Navy, the CWU-series. Both synthetic and shearling jackets are worn and collected by army buffs today, but neither has the historical status of the A-2 jacket or the G-1. Today, flight jackets are usually associated with the MA-1, a now-obsolete U.S. military jacket, which is mostly found in sage green. It is made with flight silk nylon and usually has a blaze orange lining, with the specification tag in the pocket, though earlier models had a sage-green lining and the specification tag on the neck area. It has two slanted flap pockets on the front, two inner pockets, and a zipped pocket with pen holders on the left sleeve. The lighter weight version of the MA-1 is known as the L-2B flight jacket, which in turn, replaced both the original L2 and L2A jackets, which all three differentiate from the MA-1 as they have snap-down epaulets and no inside pockets. The military flight jackets currently used today are the CWU-45P (for colder weather) and the CWU-36P (for warmer weather); both are made from Nomex.  Civilian uses  Baseball bomber jacket 80s-style summerBomber Jackets were first introduced to the pilots during World War-I to save their lives from the adverse climatic conditions. Later, these jackets were also used by the various government agencies, defence and military department too. And now these jackets are in trend in the fashion industry because of the casual & special look these jackets give during their bike riding and parties. In the 1970s flight jackets became popular with scooterboys and skinheads. In the 1980s, a variant jacket made of wool became popular (see letterman jacket below). In the early 2000s, the bomber jacket was popular casual wear in hip-hop fashion. The jacket has also caught on with several police departments across the United States for its sturdy design and heavy insulation. Flight jacket has had a resurgence in popularity during the 2010s in street fashion, and is a notable staple of celebrities such as Kanye West.  The letterman jacket = Background and history  The varsity letters were first customized by Harvard University in 1865 and originally designed to reward baseball players on their teams as a token for exceptional performance. The term \\"letterman\\" comes from the letter, which is the initial or signature icon, that is placed on the front or back of these sweaters and jackets. These \\"letterman\\" (also known as \\"varsity\\") sweaters or jackets were worn to represent the social identities of athletes and reflect a strong sense of team spirit, pride of belonging to a particular school, and values of collectivism. The letters on the jackets represented the school and were therefore placed with the intention of acknowledging scholastic achievement of the wearer. As the trend of letterman jackets spread among colleges and teenagers after WWII, the concept was expanded to award the performance of students in aspects other than sports. With the increasing number of university students due to the popularization of high school education in the US, these jackets are no longer specialized for athletic players but represent a student's identity through their school/college's initials. Similar to the flight jacket, letterman jackets have a loose-fitted silhouette that is genderless in style, although they may include a banded collar for men or a top-buttoned hood that unbuttons into an expanded collar for women.  Materials and techniques  The body of the jacket is usually made of boiled wool which provides warmth and the sleeves are generally made of leather with banded wrists and waistbands. The letter of the belonging school is mostly constructed in chenille and felt materials and made in the school's signature color. The \\"moss stitch\\" creates the chenille look of the letter with a chain stitch to provide an outline to the letter.  Colors  Since the letterman jackets represent the student's identity according to which school they come from, they are usually designed according to the school's signature color. Mostly, the school's primary signature color is applied on the body of the jacket while the sleeves are the school's secondary signature color. For example, the Harvard letterman jackets are usually crimson on the body color and white on the sleeves.  Influences  Besides serving as an identity of university/college students, the letterman jacket was modified and became a popular casual wear in the hip-hop fashion segment during the early 2000s and started to evolve into the bomber jacket. Led by Kanye West, bomber jackets became an iconic hip-hop fashion item instead of being associated with the military or colleges. Teenagers often enjoy customizing their own bomber jackets with their favorite colors and own initials to represent themselves. With the global trend of hip hop in recent years, bomber jackets have become an essential fashion item that includes varied design elements.  The bomber jacket = Background and history  The bomber jacket originates from military clothing which trickled down into subcultures such as punk and has recently made its way into high fashion. The military bomber jacket was made to be versatile for functionality as it was a lightweight jacket that kept aircrews warm. The B-15 jacket consisted of a fur collar made of cotton which was later changed to nylon after 1945 since it was considered more suitable because it is water resistant and kept perspiration out (Cruz, 2016). Bomber jackets appeared in Europe during the late 1950s and in 1963, the jackets were popularized by European Air Forces and eventually the commercial consumer. Japan was also greatly influenced by the American fashion sense after the Second World War. Notably in 1951, Kensuke Ishizu established his brand VAN that gave Japanese youth culture stylish clothing not found locally such as oxford shirts and slim trousers. The bomber jacket still remains popular during the twentieth century as a part of the grunge and street-wear subculture, whilst the ‚ÄúKanye effect‚Äù further influenced its popularity.  Silhouette  The silhouette of the bomber jacket has not altered a lot compared to the original, although it has an athletic and masculine silhouette with a fitted waist and more generous fit, like the bulky sleeves and extra pockets so as to be functional. The bomber jacket trend inspired a vast majority of fashion designers to reinterpret and revisit the silhouette of menswear today. For instance, the S/S 2000 collections from Raf Simons which changed the original design into a more symmetrical form, the elongated bombers from Rick Owens, floral printed versions from Balenciaga, Dries Van Noten and many more. The bomber jacket is a neutral fashion item with no limitations when it comes to genders, ages or styles. Shapes of the bomber jackets are modified into dress-like jackets or even one-piece dresses.  Materials  Due to high altitudes and breakneck speeds in less advanced airplanes compared to modern day, Royal Flying Corps in Belgium and France started to wear heavy leather flying jackets in the 1910s as leather was considered as the heaviest and strongest material for jackets. Since then, original bomber jackets were made in heavy-duty leather in order to provide warmth for military pilots. The A2 which was released by the US Army Air Corps was made with high wraparound collars, cinched cuffs and waists, and zipper closures protected by wind flaps and fur linings and had a high durability. Since then there have been various versions of the bomber jacket, from having fur collars, cotton outers and leather straps to knit collars and orange lining in the bomber jacket to aid in visibility in case an incident were to occur. Materials of the bomber jacket are continuously changed each season to bring unconventional styles that cater to customer's needs. Not only do designers use leather and wool, but fabrics such as silk, neoprene, satin and gauze are used. Decorative elements like ruffles, embroidered patchwork, lace- ups are also added on the bomber jackets, making them an essential fashion item that comes in a variety of colors, fabrications, and styles.  Colors  Bomber jackets originally appeared in a midnight blue hue, which was later switched to a sage green after the Korean and Vietnamese wars since it was easier for soldiers to camouflage themselves amongst the forests or countryside during the 1960s. Bomber jackets became popular in the non- military audience in the late 1960s to 1980s, especially when the English punks and skinheads started taking over the trend and changed the color into burgundy in order to distinguish themselves and their bomber jackets from the original military flight jackets. Brown is also a classic color for leather flight jackets. Due to the popularity of the jacket, both high street and high end brands have designed the bomber jacket in a variety of hues. Other than the standard navy blue, army green and black, the bomber can be found in pastel tones such as baby pink, blue, mint, or even gold and silver.Many designers and fashion brands have taken inspiration from bomber jackets, featuring them in magazines and on the runway See also * A-2 jacket * Blouson * Eisenhower jacket * G-suit * Leather jacket * MA-1 bomber jacket * MA-2 bomber jacket * Sukajan ReferencesExternal links * Manufacturer A-2 Leather Flight Jacket 1910s fashion 20th-century fashion Jackets Military aviation Military uniforms Aircrew clothing ","title":"Flight jacket"},{"id":"1352699","text":"San Juan Island National Historical Park, also known as American and English Camps, San Juan Island, is a U.S. National Historical Park owned and operated by the National Park Service on San Juan Island in the state of Washington. The park is made up of the sites of the British and U.S. Army camps during the Pig War, a boundary dispute over the ownership of the island. Both of these camps were set up in 1859 as response to a border controversy triggered by the killing of a pig. The camps were occupied for 12 years, until the islands were awarded to the United States by Kaiser Wilhelm I in an arbitration agreed by the parties in the 1872 Treaty of Washington. The British abandoned their camp in November 1872, while the American camp was disbanded in July 1874. The camp sites were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961, and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. The park was created by an Act of Congress in 1966. Setting and historical context San Juan Island is located in Puget Sound, the westernmost of the main islands of the San Juan Islands group. This island group is separated from Vancouver Island (part of British Columbia in Canada) by the Haro Strait, and from the Washington mainland by the Rosario Strait. These two channels defined the competing territorial claims of the United States and Great Britain after the Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled most of the northwestern border. Both sides pursued their territorial claims, with Americans homesteading on San Juan Island, and the British Hudson's Bay Company establishing a farm on the southern tip of the island. In 1859, an American killed a stray British-owned pig, sparking the international dispute known as the Pig War. The American homesteaders requested military protection, resulting in the establishment of the American camp, while the British sent Royal Navy ships. Cooler heads prevailed, and an agreement was reached whereby both sides would maintain camps on the island until the dispute could be resolved through diplomacy. From 1860 to 1872, British Royal Marines occupied a camp on the northwestern part of the island. The period of military occupation was peaceful; a road was built between the two camps, and Americans in the village of San Juan engaged in commerce with both encampments. In 1871, the two countries negotiated the Treaty of Washington, in which the matter of the islands was to arbitrated by the German Kaiser. His decision the following year declared the boundary to be the Haro Strait, thus awarding the islands to the United States. The British withdrew from their camp soon after, and the American camp was reduced in size and scope. The buildings and properties were sold as surplus or abandoned. The British camp was homesteaded in 1876 by William Crook, a farmer and carpenter, whose son built a house in the camp area in the early 20th century. The Crooks donated their property to the state beginning in the 1950s, and the state also acquired land around the American camp beginning in 1951. These properties formed the core what became this park in 1966. British Camp The British Camp site is on Garrison Bay on the islands northwestern shore. Today the Union Jack still flies there, being raised and lowered daily by park rangers, making it one of the very few places without diplomatic status where US government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country. Surviving buildings from the British occupation include a commissary, barracks, blockhouse, and hospital; the latter building was one that was sold and moved from the site, but was later acquired by the park and returned. American Camp The American Camp site is on the islands southernmost peninsula, and partially overlaps the original Hudson's Bay Company farm. The park property also includes the original site of San Juan village on the north shore of the peninsula, which was abandoned after the dispute ended and was entirely burned in 1890. The camp site includes two surviving buildings from the American military occupation: an officers' quarters, and the house and working quarters of the camp laundress.

Its original members were J. Robbins (vocals, guitar), Kim Coletta (bass guitar) and Adam Wade (drums). Bill Barbot (vocals, guitar) later came on board and Zach Barocas (drums) joined the group replacing Wade.  History  Robbins had played in the final incarnation of Government Issue, which was the longest lived of the original Washington, D.C. punk bands. After Government Issue called it quits, Robbins formed Jawbox with Kim Coletta and Adam Wade. The trio recorded a demo cassette and their first, self-released single (this was also the beginning of their use of the Desoto Records rubric, which went on to become a formal, successful independent record label); inclusion of the song \\"Bullet Park\\" on the Maximumrocknroll compilation They Don't Get Paid, They Don't Get Laid, But Boy Do They Work Hard (1989) was their most widespread early exposure. They also recorded a four-song EP, Jawbox (1990), which was incorporated into the CD release of their first album, Grippe (both released by Dischord Records). Shortly afterwards, Bill Barbot joined the band as second guitarist and second singer. Not long after, they recorded Novelty with Iain Burgess, and toured the USA. Wade then left the band to play drums with Shudder to Think, and their friend Zach Barocas was called upon to play the drums. Barocas' adoption of various stage-names caused some confusion at the time; he used the monikers Jim Schortz, El Jefe and even borrowed the name of the Japanese actor Takashi Shimura. Barocas' unique drumming style is central to what became recognized as the band's signature studio and live sound following their major label debut. Jawbox gained some notoriety in the indie music community by becoming one of only two bands to move from legendary record label Dischord Records to a major label, when they signed to Atlantic Records for 1994's For Your Own Special Sweetheart (the other band was Shudder to Think, which signed to Epic Records). The band had a minor MTV hit with \\"Savory\\" in 1994. A second single, \\"Cooling Card\\", was issued and received some MTV and radio play, but it wasn't as popular as \\"Savory\\". In 1995 Jawbox released a split-live-album with Leatherface on Your Choice Records, produced by Tobby Holzinger with cover- artwork designed by Chris Scheuer. The band recorded a second album for Atlantic, produced by John Agnello, but during the sessions, Atlantic started a vanity label for alternative artists, TAG Recordings, which had the band Fountains of Wayne signed to it, and they transferred Jawbox to the new label. In 1996, they released the album, which was surprisingly successful and had a college radio hit with \\"Mirrorful\\" and a cover of Tori Amos' \\"Cornflake Girl\\", but Jawbox was eventually dropped by the label due to a perceived lack of singles on the album. In early 1997, at the completion of the tour supporting the self-titled record, Barocas decided to move back to New York, and Jawbox called it a day. After the split, Robbins and Barbot, along with former Government Issue drummer, Pete Moffett, formed the band Burning Airlines, which itself broke up after releasing two albums. Barbot and Coletta continue to run DeSoto Records. Barbot is owner of Threespot, a web agency in Washington, DC. Coletta is also currently a substitute teacher at Landon School in Bethesda, MD. Barocas became a part of The Up on In which, like Burning Airlines, broke up quickly thereafter. Barocas currently lives in Brooklyn and plays in the band Bells‚â•. Barocas also writes poetry and publishes the online literary journal The Cultural Society. Robbins is currently part of the bands Channels, Office of Future Plans, and Report Suspicious Activity with Articles of Faith frontman Vic Bondi and has continued to be a successful producer. On October 7, 2009 it was announced that Jawbox would reform for a one-night-only performance of \\"Savory\\" on the December 8, 2009 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. This was their first show since early 1997 and was done to mark the reissue of their 1994 album For Your Own Special Sweetheart. In addition to taping \\"Savory\\" for their Jimmy Fallon appearance as planned, Jawbox also performed \\"68\\" and \\"FF=66\\" during their rehearsal. Footage of the extra songs was then released online. J. Robbins had also put to rest rumors of a full-fledged reunion, saying that the band will not play any concerts outside of the Late Night appearance. In January 2019, the band announced their official reunion with a 12 date summer tour. This was followed up by various other tours and shows.  Desoto Records  In December 2006, Desoto Records bought the rights of Jawbox's Atlantic Records albums and put them on iTunes and eMusic, along with the Dischord albums and EPs. They also released the albums in stores under the Desoto print and put the videos for all of the major label albums on their site, including their rendition of a Tori Amos song, Cornflake Girl, originally released as a hidden track on 1996's Jawbox.

The two co-founders combined parts of their first names, the \\"TO\\" from Tom and \\"GO\\" from Gordon.

Fountain moved the Marquette business twice, settling in its current location at 1000 North Third Street. A second location in nearby Harvey was opened in the mid-1990s, but closed in April of 2019 Reed moved to San Jose, California and in 1968 again opened a shop named Togo's, this time at 336 East William Street near San Jose State University.

ENS Paris-Saclay is one of the most prestigious and selective French grandes √©coles. Like all other grandes √©coles, this elite higher education institution is not included in the mainstream framework of the French public universities. Along with the √âcole normale sup√©rieure (Paris), ENS Lyon and ENS Rennes, the school belongs to the informal network of French √©coles normales sup√©rieures, forming the top level of research and education in the French higher educational system. In 2014, ENS Paris-Saclay became a founding member of the Paris-Saclay University, an initiative to integrate and combine resources from a number of different grandes √©coles, public universities, and research institutions. The school moved in 2019 to a new campus located in the commune of Gif-sur-Yvette on the Saclay plateau, France's \\"Silicon Valley,\\" where it will be near other members of the Paris-Saclay research-intensive and business cluster. Overview Former location of ENS Paris-Saclay in Cachan, d'Alembert building The main mission of ENS Paris-Saclay is to train world-class academics, but it is also a starting point for public administrative or private executive careers. It recruits mostly from the very competitive \\"classes pr√©paratoires\\" (see also Grande √âcole). Students of the ENS Paris- Saclay who passed the entrance exam are civil servants and are known as \\"normaliens\\". Normaliens are paid a monthly salary (around 1300 ‚Ç¨) by the French government, and are required to work for a French public administration for six years after their four-year curriculum at the ENS is completed. ENS Paris-Saclay also recruits other university students; the latter are not required to work for a French public administration but are not paid either. Students follow the standard university curriculum (Licence, Master, and most of the time PhD). They are encouraged -though it is not mandatory- to take then the Agr√©gation competitive examination. There are 17 departments : the scientific departments of Biology, Mathematics, Computer Science, Fundamental Physics, Chemistry; the engineering departments of Electronics, Mechanical Engineering, Civil Engineering; Economics and Management, Social Sciences, Languages, Design. ENS Paris-Saclay cooperates with many foreign universities, for example in student exchange programs. One of them is MONABIPHOT developed in cooperation with Wroc≈Çaw University of Technology in Poland, Complutense or Carlos III University of Madrid in Spain, MIT, Oxford, Humboldt. Admission The admission to the ENS Paris-Saclay as normalien is made through a highly competitive entrance examination, and requires at least two years of preparation after high school in Classes Pr√©paratoires (Scientific (BCPST, MPSI, PCSI...), Literary (B/L) and Business sections (Economics and Management)). The ENS Paris-Saclay recruits every year 360 normaliens and 800 degree seeking students. Curriculum Though normaliens follow the standard university curriculum, they have the opportunity to pursue their studies in other grandes √©coles such as Sciences Po, HEC, √âcole Polytechnique and the ENSAE without having to take an entrance exam (or only a part of it). Normaliens can join the Grands Corps techniques d'Etat or prepare the ENA entrance exam.

He was the younger brother of Ethan Allen. Biography The Great Seal of the State of Vermont Ira Allen was born in Cornwall in the Connecticut Colony (in present-day Litchfield County, Connecticut), the youngest of six sons born to Joseph and Mary Baker Allen. In 1771, Allen went to Vermont (then part of the British colonial Province of New York) with his brother Ethan as a surveyor for the Onion River Land Company. The Allen brothers established the company in order to purchase lands under the New Hampshire Grants. Through this, Ira Allen became involved in a dispute with the Province of New York over conflicting land claims in the region. During the American Revolutionary War, Allen was a leading figure in the declaration of the Vermont Republic in 1777, which was originally intended to be independent of both the British colonies and the newly founded United States. Late in the war, he and his brother Ethan, along with Thomas Chittenden and others, were involved in the Haldimand Affair by their discussions with Frederick Haldimand, the British Governor of the Province of Quebec, about the possibility of reinstating Vermont as a British province. An alternate explanation is that the Allen brothers were not actually interested in returning Vermont to the British but merely used the Haldimand negotiations to both stave off a British invasion of Vermont from Canada and prod the Continental Congress into recognizing Vermont as separate from New York and New Hampshire and admitting it to the United States. Vermont was granted statehood in 1791. Allen designed the Great Seal of Vermont. Over two days at Windsor in 1778, Allen drew the seal and Reuben Dean, a local silversmith, made it. The two men were each paid ten shillings for their work.\\"Dean, Reuben\\" in The Vermont Encyclopedia (eds. John J. Duffy, Samuel B. Hand & Ralph H. Orth: University of Vermont Press, 2003), p. 103. Monument of Ira Allen on the University of Vermont campus in Burlington In 1780, Allen presented to the state legislature a memorial for the establishment of the University of Vermont. He contributed money and a fifty-acre (20 ha) site at Burlington. He was called the \\"Metternich of Vermont\\" and the \\"Father of the University of Vermont\\". Ira Allen pledged 4,000 British pounds sterling to the University of Vermont, but never donated the money. In response, the Trustees of the University of Vermont secured a Writ of Attachment on his title to the town of Plainfield to try to extract payment of his original 4,000-pound pledge. Allen was Vermont's first Treasurer and held office from 1778 to 1786, when he was succeeded by Samuel Mattocks.Vermont Secretary of State, Legislative Directory, 1981, page 105 He also served as the first Surveyor General of Vermont from 1779 to 1787. In 1789, Allen married Jerusha Enos, the daughter of Roger Enos and Jerusha Hayden Enos. Members of the Allen and Enos families were the original proprietors of Irasburg, Vermont, which was named after Ira Allen. Allen subsequently acquired all the proprietary rights to Irasburg and deeded the town to Jerusha Enos as a wedding gift.Vermont Development Commission, Vermont Life magazine, Volumes 41‚Äì42, 1986, page 45Hamilton Child, Gazetteer and Business Directory of Lamoille and Orleans Counties, Vt., 1883, page 288Ethan Allen, Ethan Allen and His Kin: Correspondence, 1772‚Äì1819, Volume 1, 1998, page 334 Allen also owned undeveloped land, including a stake in Barton, Vermont. Ira Allen Chapel at the University of Vermont On October 25, 1790, Ira Allen was commissioned Major General of the Third Division of the Vermont State Militia by Governor Thomas Chittenden. He went to France in 1795 and sought French army intervention for seizing Canada in order to create an independent republic called United Columbia. Chapter 1 He bought 20,000 muskets and 24 cannons but was captured at sea, taken to England, placed on trial, and charged with furnishing arms for Irish rebels. He was acquitted after a lawsuit which lasted eight years. Allen died in Philadelphia, where he had gone to escape imprisonment for debt. He was originally buried in Philadelphia's Arch Street Presbyterian Cemetery, but his remains were lost when that site was destroyed. There is a cenotaph in his memory at Wetherills Cemetery in Audubon, Pennsylvania, and another at Greenmount Cemetery in Burlington, Vermont. The Ira Allen Chapel on the University of Vermont's main campus was also named after him.

In 1967, Ray was in a motorcycle accident and broke his wrist. While in a cast, he relearned to play the guitar with a flat pick. The years from 1963 to 1971 were prolific for Koerner, Ray and Glover. Either solo or in some combination of the trio, they released at least one album a year. The group never rehearsed together or did much at all together. Ray liked to call the group, \\"Koerner and/or Ray and/or Glover\\".Blues, Rags and Hollers: The Koerner, Ray & Glover Story. 1995. Latch Lake (Video documentary) In 1969, Ray teamed up with Will Donicht as the band Bamboo, to record an electric folk- rock album in New York for Elektra Records. The album featured original and creative lyrics and instrumentals. Ray became disillusioned with Elektra and the commercial recording industry in general and was determined to set up his own recording studio and become a record producer. With funding from his first wife's aunt, Jane Westley, Ray created a recording company, \\"Sweet Jane Ltd.\\" Their first project was recording the debut album of Bonnie Raitt, which also featured Junior Wells. Sweet Jane built a recording studio outside of Cushing, Minnesota in the early 1970s. The Minneapolis-based Willie and the Bees recorded an album there with Ray. At this point, Ray had already released a number of albums both solo and with Koerner and Glover. Ray released his own solo album, Kidman, on SJL in 1977. In the late 1970s, playing and recording music became a less viable option for Ray. As a stopgap measure, he bought into his father's insurance business, James Ray Associates. Determined to continue playing music, Ray lined up steady gigs at local bars and restaurants for after hours. Glover joined him on many of these jobs. For almost a decade, Ray led this double life of insurance agent and blues musician. He released a few live recordings and studio albums during this time. In the late 1980s, Ray sold the insurance business to a large underwriter. Ray played gigs and festivals around the country. Willie Murphy said after Ray's death, \\"It's too bad he had to die when he did, he was kind of getting the hang of it.\\"Collins, Cy; West Bank Boogie; Triangle Park Creative, 2006 Ray devoted many hours to diligent practice, running through the paces of guitar greats like Charlie Christian and Freddie Green. In 1998, Ray and Glover joined with Camile Baudoin and Reggie Scanlan of the Radiators to form a short-lived band, the Back Porch Rockers, which released the album By the Water in 2000. Ray's last album, which he sold on his website, was A Hollowbody Experience, by the 6L6 Band, which featured Ray on guitar and vocals, Jeff Dagenhardt on guitar and Dave Kasik on bass. Dagenhardt and Kasik both reside in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The 6L6 CD was released in 2002, the year Dave Ray died. Fittingly, the last track was \\"It's All Over Now.\\" Death Ray was diagnosed with lung cancer in May 2002. He died on Thanksgiving day, November 28, at his home in Minneapolis, Minnesota. He had chosen not to take any aggressive treatment for his cancer. He continued playing until shortly before his death, notably at a blues folk conference in Princeton, New Jersey. Awards and honors First Avenue In 1983 the Minnesota Music Academy named Koerner, Ray and Glover \\"Best Folk Group\\" and in 1985 inducted them into the MMA Hall of Fame. In 2008, Koerner, Ray & Glover were inducted into the Minnesota Blues Hall of Fame under the category Blues Recordings for Blues, Rags and Hollers. In October 2014, a segment of Franklin Avenue near his father's insurance office was named Dave Ray Avenue. Koerner, Ray & Glover has been honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star \\"might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,\\" according to journalist Steve Marsh.

It has been a local landmark since its construction in 1879.Cartier Square Drill Hall, City of Ottawa The drill hall is long and has two tall mansard towers. The hall is located on the bank of the Rideau Canal just south of Laurier Avenue. The area to the west was once a large open field used for drilling, but today is the location of the Ottawa City Hall and courthouse. Architecture The building was designed by Thomas Seaton Scott, first Chief Architect of the Dominion of Canada. The building is a rare surviving example of a military training facility built in the immediate post- confederation era when establishing a military presence and asserting the role of the federal government were important government aims. Lieut. Paul Weatherbee (1869-1925), who was appointed Chief Architect and Engineer from 1897-1905, was responsible for overseeing the design and construction of militia and defence buildings in Canada which were not designed by the Dept. of Public Works, for which Thomas Fuller, Chief Dominion Architect, was responsible. Weatherbee supervised and inspected militia buildings, and designed Munitions Stores buildings, often erected adjacent to Drill Hall buildings. The largest of these works was located at the rear of the Cartier Square Drill Hall, measuring 150 feet by 70 feet, and was used for the storage of weapons, uniforms, and ammunition.

In the Canadian Forces, an armoury is a place where a reserve unit trains, meets, and parades. Today the Drill Hall remains home to the GGFG and The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Duke of Edinburgh's Own). Both of these units are active components of Canada's Primary Reserve, providing trained volunteer soldiers to augment the Regular Army in peace and war. Each day during the summer months, it is from the Drill Hall that the Ceremonial Guard departs to initiate the Changing the Guard ceremony on Parliament Hill. The 2784 Governor General's Foot Guards Army Cadets (RCAC), also parade at Cartier Square Drill Hall on Wednesday evenings from 6:00 PM to 9:00 PM. RCSCC Falkland holds their annual review ceremony at Cartier Square Drill Hall. History For over 125 years, the Drill Hall at Cartier Square has been at the centre of military mobilization and training for soldiers recruited from the Ottawa-Carleton area, overseeing soldiers deployed for service in: * North-West Canada, 1885 * South Africa, 1899‚Äì1902 * The Great War, 1914‚Äì1918 * The Second World War, 1939‚Äì1945 * Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953 * Several peacekeeping operations including Cyprus, Sierra Leone, and the former Yugoslavia. * Afghanistan War, 2001‚Äì2014 During Ottawa Race Weekend each year, Cartier Square Drill Hall is converted into a satellite site of The Ottawa Hospital to provide medical services for runners.

It is believed that the village was founded in about the tenth century, presumably on the strength of its having a Norse name, possibly R»≥√∞s - by \\"farm settlement at a clearing\\" and identical to Ryssby in Sweden.Ekwall, Eilert, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names Oxford 1980, etc. The traditional division or Hundred in which it stands is Thingoe,from Old Scandinavian √æinghaugr, assembly mound, Ekwall, as above also a Norse name. The village now has a population of 840, increasing to 866 at the 2011 Census. History Risby was recorded in Domesday as Rasbi and Risbi and Resebi. The Black Ditches are on the western edge of the parish and are believed to be the most easterly of a series of early Anglo-Saxon defensive earthworks built across the Icknield Way. Saxham and Risby Station, south of the village, opened in 1854 and closed in December 1964, though passenger traffic ceased in 1967. Present day Risby Church of England Primary School operates in the village which also has a village hall and pub. St Giles Church lies opposite Quay's Farm behind a wall of flints and pink bricks and consists of nave, chancel and porch with traceried windows and one of the East Anglian round towers, in flint,notes made at the church, August 2003 containing three bells. The tower is plain up to above roof level, where a number of lancets appear below a shallow battlemented parapet. This tower has a texture of varicoloured flints, black, white, brown, glassy, dull, orange, not usually chipped or knapped, set in a buff-coloured mortar, and it rises with a slight taper from ground level and without obvious signs of coursing, as if built in one campaign. It is similar to the round tower at neighbouring Little Saxham. Inside the church, the tower arch seems rather tall for its width, and has roll mouldings about the arch and capitals marked with simple lozenge designs, as if Anglo-Saxon, but it may be from the Norman period in a style archaic for its time. The church guide suggests a date about 1000 to 1066. The space inside the round tower is surprisingly small, suggesting very thick walls.notes made at the church August 2003 The interior of the church contains tablets to the Danby, Wastell, and Spark families; also a carved screen.

Lee for his role in the Mountain Meadows massacre. Lee's blood was shed on the ground where the massacre had taken place 20 years earlier; nevertheless, Brigham Young said that Lee \\"has not half atoned for his great crime\\" . Blood atonement is a disputed doctrine in the history of Mormonism, under which the atonement of Jesus alone does not redeem the eternal sin. Instead, to atone for this sin, the sinner should be killed in a way that allows his blood to be shed upon the ground as a sacrificial offering, so he does not become a son of perdition. The largest Mormon denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), has denied the doctrine since 1889, with early church leaders referring to it as a \\"fiction\\" and later church leaders referring to it as a \\"theoretical principle\\" that had never been implemented in the LDS Church. The doctrine arose among early Mormon leaders and it was significantly promoted during the Mormon Reformation, when Brigham Young governed the Utah Territory as a near-theocracy. Sins that Young and other members of his First Presidency mentioned as meriting blood atonement, since they fall under the category of the eternal sin, included apostasy, theft, fornication (but not sodomy), and adultery. Young taught that sinners should voluntarily choose to practice the doctrine, but he also taught that it should only be enforced by a complete theocracy (which has not existed in modern times). Young considered it more charitable to sacrifice a life than to see them endure eternal torment in the afterlife. In Young's view, in a full Mormon theocracy, the practice would be implemented by the state as a penal measure. The blood atonement doctrine was the impetus behind laws in the territory and state of Utah, which allowed capital punishment by firing squad or decapitation. Though people in Utah were executed by firing squad for capital crimes under the assumption that this would aid their salvation, there is no clear evidence that Young or other top theocratic Mormon leaders enforced blood atonement for apostasy. There is, however, some evidence that the doctrine was enforced a few times at the local church level without regard to secular judicial procedure. The rhetoric of blood atonement may have contributed to a culture of violence leading to the Mountain Meadows massacre. Blood atonement remains an important doctrine within Mormon fundamentalism. Within mainstream Mormonism, the LDS Church has informally opined, since 1978, that the doctrine is no longer in force. LDS apostle Bruce R. McConkie, speaking on behalf of church leadership, wrote in 1978 that while he still believed that certain sins are beyond the atoning power of the blood of Christ, the doctrine of blood atonement is only applicable in a theocracy, like that during the time of Moses. Nevertheless, given its long history, up until at least 1994 potential jurors in Utah have been questioned on their beliefs concerning the blood atonement prior to trials where the death penalty may be considered. Stack, Peggy Fletcher, Concept of Blood Atonement Survives in Utah Despite Repudiation, Salt Lake Tribune November 5, 1994 notes that \\"In the past decade, potential jurors in every Utah capital homicide were asked whether they believed in the Mormon concept of 'blood atonement.'\\" In 1994, when the defense in the trial of James Edward Wood alleged that a local church leader had \\"talked to Wood about shedding his own blood\\", the LDS First Presidency submitted a document to the court that denied the church's acceptance and practice of such a doctrine, and included the 1978 repudiation. Stack, Peggy Fletcher, 1994. The article also notes that Arthur Gary Bishop, a convicted serial killer, was told by a top church leader that \\"blood atonement ended with the crucifixion of Jesus Christ.\\" Historical and doctrinal background In its early days, Mormonism was a Restorationist faith, and leaders such as Joseph Smith and Brigham Young frequently discussed efforts to re-introduce social, legal, and religious practices described in the Bible, such as temple building, polygamy, and a patriarchal, theocratic governing structure. The term \\"blood atonement\\" does not appear in Mormon scripture. However, in the Book of Mormon there are verses which clearly detail that \\"the law of Moses\\" requires capital punishment for the crime of murder and that Jesus' death and Atonement \\"fulfills\\" the law of Moses such that there should be no more blood sacrifices.Alma 34:11-17: \\"Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay. But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world. Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away. And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.\\" The concept of blood atonement for adultery was less clearly articulated in LDS scripture. In Doctrine and Covenants 132, Joseph Smith wrote that people who break the \\"New and Everlasting Covenant\\" (Celestial marriage) would be \\"destroyed in the flesh\\" and be punished until they received their exaltation at the Last Judgment.Doctrine and Covenants 132, verses 26 and 27: \\"Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God. The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord.\\" The requirement that blood should be shed as an atonement for capital crimes grew into the idea that salvation would be blocked unless this penalty was adhered to, because the \\"law\\" would remain \\"unfulfilled.\\" The belief in the necessity of spilled blood and death in order to make restitution for adultery and murder was aided by a generally favorable view of capital punishment, the idea that spilled blood \\"cries out\\" for retribution, the \\"blood for blood\\" doctrine that says crimes of bloodshed should be punished by the spilling of blood, and the concept that repentance requires restitution. Although the scriptures in Alma 34 of the Book of Mormon speak of the \\"requirement\\" in terms of a legal obligation, Brigham Young described blood atonement-worthy crimes as precluding Eternal Progression offered to the faithful, stating that a sinner's crimes \\"will deprive him of that exaltation which he desires.\\"Journal of Discourses Vol. 4, p. 215-221 In Mormon theology, Salvation is not the same as Exaltation which has more to do with \\"where in heaven\\" whereas Salvation is \\"being in heaven.\\" Capital punishment in Mormon scripture and ritual Mormonism's teachings regarding capital punishment originated in older Jewish and Christian teachings. For example, in 1 Corinthians 5:5, Paul discusses a man who copulated with his father's wife and commands church members to \\"deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.\\" The Book of Mormon also has passages favoring capital punishment, saying \\"And now, behold, I speak unto the church. Thou shalt not kill; and he that kills shall not have forgiveness in this world, nor in the world to come. And again, I say, thou shalt not kill; but he that killeth shall die.\\"Doctrine and Covenants 42:18-9 Elsewhere, though, people are portrayed as having been forgiven for murders.Book of Mormon, Alma 24:10Book of Mormon, Alma 54:7 Underlying the blood atonement concept is the idea that spilled blood \\"cries out\\" for retribution, an idea that is advocated in several passages of Mormon scripture. In the Bible, the blood of Abel ascended to the ears of God after he was killed by Cain.Bible, King James Version, Genesis 4:10 In the Book of Mormon, the \\"blood of a righteous man\\" (Gideon) was said to \\"come upon\\" the theocratic leader Alma \\"for vengeance\\" against the murderer (Nehor).Book of Mormon, Alma 1:13 Mormon scripture also refers to the \\"cry\\" of the blood of the saints ascending from the ground up to the ears of God as a testimony against those who killed them.Book of Mormon, 2 Nephi 26:3 After the death of Joseph Smith, Brigham Young added an Oath of Vengeance to the Nauvoo Endowment ritual. Participants in the ritual made an oath to pray that God would \\"avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation.\\" The prophet was Smith and \\"this nation\\" was the United States. (This oath was removed from the ceremony during the 1920s.) In 1877, Brigham Young noted what he viewed as a similarity between Joseph Smith's death and the blood atonement doctrine, in that \\"whether we believe in blood atonement or not\\", Joseph and other prophets \\"sealed their testimony with their blood.\\"Journal of Discourses 18:361 (May 6, 1877) The LDS temple rituals formerly provided an example in which capital punishment is contemplated for violations of historical blood oaths in the Endowment ritual. The blood oaths in the ceremony were intended to protect the ritual's secrecy. In keeping with the idea that grievous crimes must be answered with bloodshed and that blood atonement should be voluntary, participants made an oath that rather than ever revealing the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would rather have \\"my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots\\"; \\"our breasts ... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field\\"; \\"your body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out\\" showing an entire refusal to accept the promises made in the washing and anointing ordinances. The gory wording was removed early in the 20th century and changed to a less explicit reference to \\"different ways in which life may be taken.\\" Vestigial accompanying suggestive gestures were removed by the LDS Church in 1990. There are no documented instances of a person who has been killed for violating these oaths of secrecy. \\"Blood for blood\\" doctrine and retributive capital punishment Joseph Smith did not teach blood atonement, but taught a \\"blood for blood\\" law of God's retribution, stating that if he could enact a death penalty law, \\"I am opposed to hanging, even if a man kill another, I will shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground and let the smoke ascend thereof up to God...\\" Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, was a strong proponent of capital punishment, and favored execution methods that involved the shedding of blood as retribution for crimes of bloodshed. In 1843, he or his scribe commented that the common execution method in Christian nations was hanging, \\"instead of blood for blood according to the law of heaven.\\"This statement is found in , which was written by Willard Richards in 1843. Years before making this remark, however, Smith was quoted as saying that the hanging of Judas Iscariot was not a suicide, but an execution carried out by Saint Peter. In a March 4, 1843 debate with church leader George A. Smith, who argued against capital punishment,George A. Smith later changed his views on capital punishment, and would write the first criminal code in Utah which allowed execution by firing squad and decapitation. Joseph Smith said that if he ever had the opportunity to enact a death penalty law, he \\"was opposed to hanging\\" the convict; rather, he would \\"shoot him, or cut off his head, spill his blood on the ground, and let the smoke thereof ascend up to God.\\" In the church's April 6, 1843 general conference, Smith said he would \\"wring a thief's neck off if I can find him, if I cannot bring him to justice any other way.\\"first manuscript version, minutes of general conference, LDS Archives. See . Sidney Rigdon, Smith's counselor in the First Presidency, also supported capital punishment involving the spilling of blood, stating, \\"There are men standing in your midst that you can't do anything with them but cut their throat and bury them.\\"April 6, 1844 statement compiled on April 24, 1844 by Thomas Bullock, LDS Archives. See . On the other hand, Smith was willing to tolerate the presence of men \\"as corrupt as the devil himself\\" in Nauvoo, Illinois, who \\"had been guilty of murder and robbery,\\" in the chance that they might \\"come to the waters of baptism through repentance, and redeem a part of their allotted time.\\" Brigham Young, Smith's successor in the LDS Church, initially held views on capital punishment similar to those of Smith. On January 27, 1845, he spoke approvingly of Smith's toleration of \\"corrupt men\\" in Nauvoo who were guilty of murder and robbery, on the chance that they might repent and be baptized. On the other hand, on February 25, 1846, after the Saints had left Nauvoo, Young threatened adherents who had stolen wagon cover strings and rail timber with having their throats cut \\"when they get out of the settlements where his orders could be executed.\\" Later that year, Young gave orders that \\"when a man is found to be a thief,...cut his throat & thro' him in the River.\\"Diary of Thomas Bullock, 13 December 1846 Young also stated that decapitation of repeated sinners \\"is the law of God and it shall be executed.\\"Diary of Willard Richards, December 20, 1846; Watson, Manuscript History of Brigham Young, 1846-1847, p. 480. There are no documented instances, however, of such a sentence being carried out on the Mormon Trail. In the Salt Lake valley, Young acted as the executive authority while the Council of Fifty acted as a legislature. One of his main concerns in the early Mormon settlement was theft, and he swore that \\"a theif [sic] should not live in the Valley, for he would cut off their heads or be the means of having it done as the Lord lived.\\"Diary of Mary Haskin Parker Richards, 16 April 1848. In Utah, there existed a law from 1851 to 1888 allowing persons convicted of murder to be executed by decapitation. Being \\"destroyed in the flesh\\" for violation of celestial marriage covenants The most immediate precursor to the blood atonement doctrine stems from a controversial section of Mormon scripture dictated by Smith in 1843 commanding the practice of plural marriage (D&C; 132). This revelation stated that once a man and a woman enter the \\"New and Everlasting Covenant\\" (a celestial marriage), and it is \\"sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise\\" (which Smith later taught was accomplished through the second anointing ritual)\\" If a sealed person shed innocent blood, they would suffer the fate of David, who was redeemed, but fell short of his exaltation, and did not become a joint- heir with Christ (D&C; 132:39), since a murderer is not forgiven in the sense that he will enter the Celestial kingdom.Art. \\"Murderers\\", in: Bruce R. McConkie: Mormon Doctrine, 2nd ed., Salt Lake City 1966. But although, regarding his extent of religious enlightment, his sins fall under the category of the unpardonable sin, he is not considered a son of perdition because he sought repentance at the hand of God carefully with tears all his life afterward.Kimball: The Miracle of Forgivness. Therefore, he got a promise that he has to went through hell, but his soul should not be left there. However, if a sealed and anointed person broke their covenants to any extent short of the unpardonable sin, they could possibly still gain their exaltation and become gods and goddesses (aka, joint-heirs with Christ who inherits The Father has) in the afterlife, conditional upon the utmost efforts possible being given to repentance, up to and possibly including forsaking one's life for forgiveness. but would be \\"destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption\\" (D&C; 132:26). The revelation did not, however, specify the mechanism by which such people would be \\"destroyed in the flesh,\\" and it did not indicate whether that \\"redemption\\" would be the result of the sinner's own blood or the result of the atonement of Jesus. Blood atonement teachings during the Brigham Young administration=Teachings by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve As far as scholars can tell, the author of the blood atonement doctrine was LDS Church president Brigham Young, who first taught the doctrine after the death of Joseph Smith. The doctrine first began to be taught, however, during the period when Brigham Young was Governor of the Utah Territory a period also known as the Mormon Reformation (1856‚Äì1858), particularly by Jedediah M. Grant of the First Presidency. Public talk of blood atonement diminished substantially by the end of the Mormon Reformation in 1858 when Young was replaced as territorial governor by Alfred Cumming. The subject of blood atonement remained largely dormant until the 1870s, when the issue was revived by the national media during the John D. Lee trials for his role in the Mountain Meadows massacre. =Development of the doctrine in the 1840s and early 1850s= When Brigham Young led the Saints from Nauvoo, Illinois to the Salt Lake valley beginning in the mid-1840s, he and his followers intended to establish a theocracy independent of the United States, where there would be no distinction between church and state. (For Mormon theocratic political theory, see Theodemocracy). Brigham Young's first recorded teachings on the blood atonement doctrine were in 1845, when Young had stepped into the shoes of Joseph Smith, the previous theocratic leader who had been killed in 1844. That year, he was said to have approved of a Mormon being killed by an unknown assailant in Nauvoo, Illinois, an act he characterized as \\"a deed of charity\\" because \\"he might now possibly be redeemed in the eternal world\\" . In the Salt Lake valley, Young maintained a Council of Fifty composed of religious leaders as a kind of legislature, but this body's power was limited . In 1849, as Young and the Council of Fifty were drafting a plan for a proposed State of Deseret, Young spoke to the Council about what to do with thieves, murderers, and adulterers, and said, \\"I want their cursed heads to be cut off that they may atone for their crimes\\".John D. Lee Diary, March 3, 1849. The Council voted the next day that an imprisoned man \\"had forfeited his head\\" and to \\"dispose of him privately\\" (March 4 entry). Two weeks later, Young recommended decapitation for the man and a fellow prisoner, but the Council decided to let them live.John D. Lee Diary, March 17, 1849. Later in 1851, the General Assembly of the State of Deseret, picked by the Council of Fifty, adopted a capital punishment provision allowing decapitation as a means of execution, which would remain in force until 1888 . In a speech before the Utah Territory's legislature on February 5, 1852, Young appeared to advocate the passage of a law that required decapitation for whites who were \\"condemned by the Law\\" for miscegenation with black people .Earlier, when Young had heard that a black Mormon in Massachusetts had married a white woman, he told the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles that he would have them killed \\"if they were far away from the Gentiles.\\" Minutes of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, 3 December 1847, 6, LDS archives, cited in . He told the legislature that miscegenation was a grave sin that would bring a curse upon a man and all of his children that were produced as a result of the union . He said that if a white Mormon \\"in an unguarded moment should commit such a transgression\\", decapitation \\"would do a great deal towards atoning for the sin...it would do them good that they might be saved with their Bre[theren]\\" . He said, \\"It is the greatest blessing that could come to some men to shed their blood on the ground, and let it come up before the Lord as an atonement\\" . =Impending theocratic blood atonement for \\"covenant breaking\\" Mormons= During the Mormon Reformation, church leaders began to criss-cross Mormon communities in a dramatic call for greater orthodoxy and religious purity. Brigham Young, who was then a theocratic leader, began preparing church members for what they thought was the quickly- approaching Second Coming, and a time of \\"Celestial law\\" in the Utah Territory. According to Young: \\"The time is coming when justice will be laid to the line and righteousness to the plummet; when we shall take the old broadsword and ask, Are you for God? And if you are not heartily on the Lord's side, you will be hewn down.\\" The most vocal proponent of the blood atonement doctrine was Jedediah M. Grant, Young's second counselor in the First Presidency from 1854 to 1856. Grant, a firebrand preacher, rose to the First Presidency after the death of Willard Richards in 1854 and became the main force behind the Mormon Reformation . His teachings in 1854 related to \\"covenant breakers,\\" people who had broken their covenants made in the Endowment or Celestial marriage. At a meeting in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on March 12, 1854, Grant asked, \\"What disposition ought the people of God to make of covenant breakers?\\" In answer to his question, he stated that they should be put to death . However, he lamented on the difficulty in applying this in a secular democracy, stating, \\"I wish we were in a situation favorable to our doing that which is justifiable before God, without any contaminating influences of Gentile amalgamation, laws, and traditions.\\" Arguing for a purer theocracy, he stated that it is the right of the church \\"to kill a sinner to save him, when he commits those crimes that can only be atoned for by shedding his blood.... We would not kill a man, of course, unless we killed him to save him.\\" Parley P. Pratt, a prominent member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, was also a proponent of the blood atonement doctrine. On December 31, 1855, Pratt pressed the Utah Territory legislature to \\"[m]ake death the penalty for fornication and adultery.\\" He cited 1 Cor. 5:5, calling on early Christians \\"[t]o deliver [an adulterer] unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus,\\" as a Biblical justification for the blood atonement doctrine . Pratt stated, \\"This destruction of the flesh must have had reference to the death of the body; the man having justly forfeited his life in accordance with the law of God.\\" On March 16, 1856, Young acknowledged that it might seem, based on rhetoric from the pulpit, that \\"every one who did not walk to the line was at once going to be destroyed,\\" but thus far, he said, nobody had been killed . He warned them, however, that the time \\"is not far distant\\" when the LDS Church would enforce the law of blood atonement against covenant breakers . One of the temple covenants at the time was, \\"I will never have anything to do with any of the daughters of Eve, unless they are given to me of the Lord.\\" Though the \\"strict penalty of the law\\" dictated death to atone for breaking this covenant, Young said that the church would \\"not yet\\" enforce it . On January 11, 1857 Heber C. Kimball, a member of the First Presidency, spoke about the adulterers within the church and warned that \\"[t]hey are worthy of death, and they will get it. That time is near by, and God has spoken from the heavens, and when certain things are about right, we shall make a public example of those characters, ...and the time is just at our doors.\\" In the meantime, rather than atoning for sins with blood, Kimball taught that it was possible to at least partially atone for sins by means other than blood, and encouraged covenant breakers to \\"pay all you can, that there may not be much against you when the accounts are settled up.\\" Echoing Kimball's words, on February 8, 1857, Young warned the church that institution of the \\"celestial law\\" requiring mandatory blood atonement was \\"nigh at hand,\\" and that under this law, covenant breakers guilty of adultery would be \\"hewn down.\\" In the meantime, he said, \\"if this people will sin no more, but faithfully live their religion, their sins will be forgiven them without taking life.\\" =Voluntary blood atonement and enforcement by individuals= In addition to talk about blood atonement as a theocratic form of capital punishment whose time was \\"nigh at hand,\\" church leaders also discussed unofficial blood atonement. According to one interpretation of Brigham Young's sermon on March 16, 1856, the sermon encouraged enforcement of the doctrine by individuals in certain situations. He said that if \\"you found your brother in bed with your wife, and put a javelin through both of them, you would be justified, and they would atone for their sins, and be received into the kingdom of God.\\" He said, \\"under such circumstances, I have no wife whom I love so well that I would not put a javelin through her heart, and I would do it with clean hands.\\" But he warned anyone who intended to \\"execute judgment\\" that he or she \\"has got to have clean hands and a pure heart, ...else they had better let the matter alone.\\" If the adulterous couple were not actually caught in the act, Young recommended to \\"let them live and suffer in the flesh for their sins.\\" According to Young, when any person violates a covenant with God, \\"The blood of Christ will never wipe that out, your own blood must atone for it\\" either in this life or the next . At a meeting on September 21, 1856 attended by both Young and Grant, Grant stated that there were a great many covenant-breaking members in the church \\"who have committed sins that cannot be forgiven through baptism.\\" These people, Grant said, \\"need to have their bloodshed, for water will not do, their sins are too deep a dye.\\" Therefore, Grant advised these people to volunteer to have a committee appointed by the First Presidency to select a place and \\"shed their blood.\\" () Brigham Young spoke in agreement, stating: \\"There are sins that men commit for which they cannot receive forgiveness in this world, or in that which is to come, and if they had their eyes open to see their true condition, they would be perfectly willing to have their blood spilt upon the ground, that the smoke thereof might ascend to heaven as an offering for their sins, and the smoking incense would atone for their sins.\\" Indeed, Young claimed that men had actually come to him and offered their blood to atone for their sins . For these sins, which Young did not specify, the shedding of blood is \\"the only condition for which they can obtain forgiveness,\\" or to appease the wrath that is kindled against them, and that the law might have its course.\\" The atonement of Jesus, Young said, was for \\"sins through the fall and those committed by men, yet men can commit sins which it can never remit.\\" On February 8, 1857, Brigham Young stated that if a person \\"overtaken in a gross fault\\" truly understood that \\"by having his blood shed he will atone for that sin, and be saved and exalted with the Gods,\\" he would voluntarily ask to have his blood shed so he could gain his exaltation . He framed blood atonement as an act of selfless love, and asked the congregation, \\"Will you love that man or woman well enough to shed their blood?\\" As a matter of love, he said, \\"if [your neighbor] needs help, help him; and if he wants salvation and it is necessary to spill his blood on the earth in order that he may be saved, spill it.\\" =Blood atonement for apostasy= Most discussion of blood atonement during the Mormon Reformation concerned the killing of \\"covenant breakers.\\" The greatest covenant breakers were thought to be \\"apostates,\\" who according to early Mormon doctrine would become sons of perdition and for whom \\"there is no chance whatever for exaltation.\\" Nevertheless, Brigham Young believed that blood atonement would have at least some benefit. Young's first discussion of blood atonement in 1845 concerned a man who may have been considered an apostate in Nauvoo, Illinois . On February 8, 1857, Young said, regarding apostates, that \\"if their blood had been spilled, it would have been better for them.\\" Young warned these apostates that although \\"[t]he wickedness and ignorance of the nations forbid this principle's being in full force, ...the time will come when the law of God will be in full force,\\" meaning that apostates would be subject to theocratic blood atonement. In August 1857, Heber C. Kimball echoed Young's statements about apostates, stating that \\"if men turn traitors to God and His servants, their blood will surely be shed, or else they will be damned, and that too according to their covenants.\\" According to the 12th LDS president Spencer W. Kimball, the extent of the religious enlightment of the apostates during the lifetime of Joseph Smith is not known, and they cannot be identified individually.Spencer W. Kimball: The Miracle of Forgivness, p. 122 - 123. According to the 10th LDS president Joseph Fielding Smith, a member who leaves the church does not become son of perdition, \\"unless he has had enough light\\" to become one.Bruce R. McConkie (publ.): Doctrines of Salvation Volume 1. Sermons and Writings of Joseph Fielding Smith, p. 29. Properly-practiced blood atonement Blood atonement as taught above was not to be used as a way to punish, but as a way for the sinner to make restitution for his sins. One hearsay account was given by John D. Lee, who was killed for his involvement in the Mountain Meadows massacre (see below). Lee stated in his memoirs that he had heard of only one person who had properly received death by blood atonement - by willingly atoning for the crime: :Rosmos Anderson was a Danish man who had come to Utah...He had married a widow lady...and she had a daughter that was fully grown at the time of the reformation... :At one of the meetings during the reformation Anderson and his step-daughter confessed that they had committed adultery, believing when they did so that Brigham Young would allow them to marry when he learned the facts. Their confession being full, they were rebaptized and received into full membership. They were then placed under covenant that if they again committed adultery, Anderson should suffer death. Soon after this a charge was laid against Anderson before the Council, accusing him of adultery with his step-daughter...the Council voted that Anderson must die for violating his covenants. Klingensmith went to Anderson and notified him that the orders were that he must die by having his throat cut, so that the running of his blood would atone for his sins. Anderson, being a firm believer in the doctrines and teachings of the Mormon Church, made no objections, but asked for half a day to prepare for death. His request was granted. His wife was ordered to prepare a suit of clean clothing, in which to have her husband buried, and was informed that he was to be killed for his sins, she being directed to tell those who should enquire after her husband that he had gone to California. :Klingensmith, James Haslem, Daniel McFarland and John M. Higbee dug a grave in the field near Cedar City, and that night, about 12 o'clock, went to Anderson's house and ordered him to make ready to obey the Council. Anderson got up, dressed himself, bid his family good-bye, and without a word of remonstrance accompanied those that he believed were carrying out the will of the \\"Almighty God.\\" They went to the place where the grave was prepared; Anderson knelt upon the side of the grave and prayed. Klingensmith and his company then cut Anderson's throat from ear to ear and held him so that his blood ran into the grave. As soon as he was dead they dressed him in his clean clothes, threw him into the grave and buried him. They then carried his bloody clothing back to his family, and gave them to his wife to wash, when she was again instructed to say that her husband was in California .... The killing of Anderson was then considered a religious duty and a just act.Confessions of John D. Lee, photomechanical reprint of the original 1877 edition, pages 282-284 Lee refused to be killed in the same manner for his conviction, requesting instead that he be executed by firing squad, rejecting the notion that he needed to atone for the Mountain Meadows massacre.  Mountain Meadows massacre  The Mountain Meadows massacre of September 11, 1857 was widely blamed on the church's teaching of blood atonement and other anti-United States rhetoric by LDS Church leaders during the Utah War. The widely publicized massacre was a mass killing of Arkansan emigrants by a Mormon militia led by prominent Mormon leader John D. Lee, who was later executed for his role in the killings. After escalating rumors that the emigrants participated in early Mormon persecution, the militia conducted a siege, and when the emigrants surrendered, the militia killed men, women, and children in cold blood, adopted some of the surviving children, and attempted a cover-up. Though widely connected with the blood atonement doctrine by the United States press and general public, there is no direct evidence that the massacre was related to \\"saving\\" the emigrants by the shedding of their blood (as they had not entered into Mormon covenants); rather, most commentators view it as an act of intended retribution. Young was accused of either directing the massacre, or of bearing complicity after the fact. However, when Brigham Young was interviewed on the matter and asked if he believed in blood atonement, he replied, \\"I do, and I believe that Lee has not half atoned for his great crime.\\" He said \\"we believe that execution should be done by the shedding of blood instead of by hanging,\\" but only \\"according to the laws of the land.\\" Rumors of blood atonement enforcement by Utah-era Danites Many of these rumors were centered around a group called the Danites. The Danites were a fraternal organization founded by a group of Latter-day Saints in June 1838, at Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri. The Danites operated as a vigilante group and took a central role in the events of the Mormon War. Although the organization ceased to formally exist in Missouri, the name \\"Danites\\" may have been used in both Nauvoo and Utah. It is not certain whether the Danites continued to exist as a formal organization in Utah . During the 1860s and 1870s, there were widespread rumors that Brigham Young had a Danite organization that was enforcing the blood atonement doctrine. Evidence of this, however, never rose above the level of rumor . Responding to this, Brigham Young stated on April 7, 1867: > Is there war in our religion? No; neither war nor bloodshed. Yet our enemies > cry out \\"bloodshed,\\" and \\"oh, what dreadful men these Mormons are, and those > Danites! how they slay and kill!\\" Such is all nonsense and folly in the > extreme. The wicked slay the wicked, and they will lay it on the Saints. Disaffected Mormon Fanny Stenhouse, a Godbeite dissenter and prominent critic of Brigham Young, described the Danites as \\"Avenging Angels\\" who murdered disaffected Mormons and blamed their disappearance on Indians. Tell it All, page 169 Ann Eliza Young, an ex-wife of Brigham Young and author of the expos√© Wife No. 19, also described the Danites as still being organized after reaching Utah, and murdering dissenters and church enemies. Wife No. 19, page 274 While their claims remain controversial among Mormon historians, their writing does indicate that the concept of Danites remained in currency as late as the 1870s. =Thomas Coleman murder= An example used by some to illustrate the alleged practice of blood atonement is the 1866 murder of the former-slave, Thomas Coleman (or Colburn), who was in good standing as a member of the LDS Church. As Mormon historian D. Michael Quinn has documented, Coleman was apparently secretly courting a white Mormon woman, contrary to both territorial law and contemporaneous Mormon teachings regarding people of African descent. At one of their clandestine meetings behind the old Arsenal (on what is now Capitol Hill in Salt Lake) on December 11, Coleman was discovered by \\"friends\\" of the woman. The group of vigilantes hit Coleman with a large rock. Using his own bowie knife, his attackers slit his throat so deeply from ear to ear that he was nearly decapitated, as well as slicing open his right breast, in what some believe was a mimicry of penalties illustrated in the temple ritual. Not all of Coleman's wounds correlated with the temple ritual, however, since he was also castrated. A pre-penciled placard was then pinned to his corpse stating \\"NOTICE TO ALL NIGGERS - TAKE WARNING - LEAVE WHITE WOMEN ALONE.\\" Even though it was the middle of winter, a grave was dug and Coleman's body was buried. The body was disposed of in less than three hours after its discovery. Less than twelve hours after that, Judge Elias Smith, first cousin of Joseph Smith, appointed George Stringham (a Mormon ruffian and vigilante with ties to Porter Rockwell, Jason Luce, and William Hickman) as the foreman of the Coroner's Jury; they briefly met and summarily dismissed the case as a crime that was committed by either a person or by persons unknown to the jury, abruptly ending all official enquiry into the bizarre murder.Quinn, Extensions of Power, p. 256 and Daily Union Vedette, 15 December 1866. The ritualistic elements involved in the execution of Coleman‚Äôs murder may have been in response to a public sermon made three years earlier by Brigham Young on March 3, 1863. In this sermon, Young states, ‚ÄúI am a human being, and I have the care of human beings. I wish to save life, and have no desire to destroy life. If I had my wish, I should entirely stop the shedding of human blood.‚Äù Following this statement, however, Young makes a statement regarding interracial relations in which he continues, \\"Shall I tell you the law of God in regard to the African race? If the white man who belongs to the chosen seed mixes his blood with the seed of Cain, the penalty, under the law of God, is death on the spot. This will always be so.\\" Young continues his sermon by condemning whites for their abuse of slaves with the proclamation, ‚Äúfor their abuse of that race, the whites will be cursed, unless they repent.‚Äù Young also declares that he is ‚Äúneither an abolitionist nor a pro-slavery man‚Äù but that if he had to choose, he would ‚Äúbe against the pro-slavery side of the question.‚Äù With regard to Coleman's murder, LDS apologetics point out that the practice of \\"blood atonement\\" is said to apply to endowed Mormons who apostatized. Coleman was a member in good standing and was not endowed, suggesting that his death may have actually been the result of racism. The LDS apologist organization FAIR has claimed that Young's statement was not made out of racist leanings but rather \\"Brigham Young's comments were a condemnation of abuse and rape of helpless black women, and not an overtly racist statement condemning interracial marriage.\\" =Other killings= One of the examples cited by critics of the church is a set of murders in Springville, Utah of individuals who, according to historical documents and court records, were \\"very questionable characters.\\" Judge Elias Smith stated in regard to the case: \\"We have carefully examined all the evidence furnished by a remarkably accurate stenographic reporter, and can only conclude that evidence before the court goes to show that Durfee, Potter and two of the Parrishes got into a row about matters best, if not only, known to themselves, and for that Potter and two Parrishes were killed.\\" - Records published in the Deseret News, April 6, 1859. In 1902, the police and press initially speculated that blood atonement might have been a motive for the New York City \\"Pulitzer Murder\\" committed by William Hooper Young, a grandson of Brigham Young. This speculation was largely fueled by the fact that a notebook belonging to Hooper Young had been found at the scene of the crime, and \\"blood atonement\\" and supporting scriptural references was scrawled on one of the pages. Because Young pleaded guilty to murder, his exact motive for the crime was never determined, but medical experts and the judge were of the opinion that Young was medically‚Äîthough probably not legally‚Äîinsane. Hooper Young's case and contemporary blood atonement are discussed in detail in Brian Evenson's 2006 novel The Open Curtain. Blood atonement after Brigham Young By 1877, when Brigham Young died, the blood atonement doctrine, whether or not it was properly understood by the public, had \\"done more than any other thing save polygamy to bring Mormonism into disrepute\\". In response, church leaders and journalists took an active interest in explaining and justifying the doctrine, and in countering the negative press. John Taylor, Young's successor, acknowledged in North American Review the \\"we believe some crimes can only be atoned for by the life of the guilty party\\"; however, he said, \\"all culprits worthy of death...should be executed by the proper civil officer, not by any exercise of the lex talionis or the intervention of ecclesiastical authority\\". Chief among the Latter-day Saint writers defending the doctrine in the late 19th century was Charles W. Penrose, editor of the church-owned Deseret News, who would later become a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles and the First Presidency. Blood atonement for murder Prior to the death of Brigham Young, blood atonement doctrine was taught primarily as a means for Mormon \\"covenant breakers\\" (usually adulterers and apostates) to pay for their sins, but a full list of sins requiring blood atonement was never given. In at least one instance, Heber C. Kimball suggested that the principle would apply to the sin of murder.JD 7:236 (August 28, 1859) After Young's death, blood atonement continued to be taught as a necessary means to pay for the sin of adultery,Redirect URL however, blood atonement teachings largely ignored the penalty for apostates and lesser \\"covenant breakers\\", and focused primarily on the sin of murder, emphasizing that it was intended to be operative only within the context of legal capital punishment. According to Penrose, \\"Murder is a 'sin unto death,' which prayers and repentance and ordinances will not wash away\\". Therefore, \\"the only valid offering that the criminal can make is his own life's blood poured out upon the ground in willing expiation.\\" That is why, Penrose said, the Utah Territory gave convicted murderers a choice between hanging and shooting (id.) As Mormon thinkers recognized, application of the blood atonement doctrine to the sin of murder seemingly created some difficulties. The Book of Mormon states that murderers can receive forgiveness by repentance.Alma 24:10, 54:7 Nevertheless, a passage in the Doctrine and Covenants says that murder is unpardonable.D&C; 42:18 Attempting to resolve this seeming conflict in a Deseret News article on July 4, 1883, Apostle Charles W. Penrose taught that in some cases such as murder done in anger or provocation, murder might be forgiven, but only after the guilty party atones for the murder by the shedding of blood. Repudiation of allegations of the practice by the LDS church in 1889 The practice of ‚Äúblood atonement‚Äù was formally denied and repudiated by the church in a statement issued in 1889: > MANIFESTO OF THE PRESIDENCY AND APOSTLES \\"SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 12th, 1889. > To Whom It May Concern: In consequence of gross misrepresentations of the > doctrines, aims and practices of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day > Saints, commonly called the 'Mormon' church, which have been promulgated for > years, and have recently been revived for political purposes and to prevent > all aliens, otherwise qualified, who are members of the 'Mormon' church from > acquiring citizenship, we deem it proper on behalf of said church to > publicly deny these calumnies and enter our protest against them.

Evans, a former member of the First Presidency of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints who had left the church, wrote a book titled Forty Years in the Mormon Church: Why I Left It!. Evans accused both the RLDS Church and the Utah-based LDS Church of advocating ‚Äúblood atonement‚Äù and he also associated the alleged practice with the ‚ÄúDanites.‚Äù In response to denials that the practice had ever been implemented by both churches, Evans wrote: > Thus we have the President of the Reorganized Church and son of Joseph Smith > admitting, as well as apologizing for the rash statements of his father and > other leaders in the old church, and then we have Joseph F. Smith of the > Utah church using about the same argument to excuse the language and > murderous conduct of the Danites in Utah. All we care to say is reply to > both of these descendants of the original prophet and organizer of the > Danite Band is, that when the leading members and officers of the church for > many years teach and practice, by threats and murders, ascribed to the > Danite Band, then we believe the public is justified in denouncing such > language and conduct, and affirming it to be the doctrine of the church. Response by Joseph Fielding Smith Responding to Evans‚Äôs accusations regarding the alleged implementation of the practice of ‚Äúblood atonement‚Äù, Joseph Fielding Smith restated the doctrine, but denied that it had ever been practiced by the church, claiming that any such accusation was a ‚Äúdamnable falsehood.‚Äù Smith wrote, > Through the atonement of Christ all mankind may be saved, by obedience to > the laws and ordinances of the gospel...Man may commit certain grievous sins > - according to his light and knowledge -that will place him beyond the reach > of the atoning blood of Christ. If then he would be saved he must make > sacrifice of his own life to atone - so far as the power lies - for that > sin, for the blood of Christ alone under certain circumstances will not > avail...But that the Church practices ‚ÄúBlood Atonement‚Äù on apostates or any > others, which is preached by ministers of the ‚ÄòReorganization‚Äô is a damnable > falsehood for which the accusers must answer. Statements in the late twentieth century Like several teachings enunciated by Brigham Young (see, e.g., Adam-God theory), blood atonement has been widely criticized by Latter Day Saints. The status of the teaching has been addressed by modern leaders in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. As late as 1970, the church's First Presidency authorized a church publication that interpreted D&C; 132:26 (Joseph Smith's written revelation authorizing plural marriage in 1843) as saying that even after repentance, \\"some sins may call for a most dreadful punishment even then--the destruction in the flesh and being turned over to the buffetings of Satan until the day of redemption. This punishment is most severe.\\"LDS Church (1970), The Doctrine and Covenants Containing Revelations Given to Joseph Smith, Jr., the Prophet With an Introduction and Historical and Exegetical Notes, Revised Edition, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, p. 829. In 1954, church historian Joseph Fielding Smith taught the following about blood atonement: > Man may commit certain grievous sins--according to his light and knowledge-- > that will place him beyond the reach of the atoning blood of Christ. If then > he would be saved, he must make sacrifice of his Own life to atone--so far > as in his power lies--for that sin, for the blood of Christ alone under > certain circumstances will not avail.... Joseph Smith taught that there were > certain sins so grievous that man may commit, that they will place the > transgressors beyond the power of the atonement of Christ. If these offenses > are committed, then the blood of Christ will not cleanse them from their > sins even though they repent. Therefore their only hope is to have their own > blood shed to atone, as far as possible, in their behalf. In addition, Apostle Bruce R. McConkie agreed with Brigham Young and Joseph Fielding Smith that \\"under certain circumstances there are some serious sins for which the cleansing of Christ does not operate, and the law of God is that men must then have their own blood shed to atone for their sins.\\"Mormon Doctrine at 92 McConkie's repudiation of the need to practice the doctrine In 1978, Bruce R. McConkie, acting under the direction of President of the Church Spencer W. Kimball and the First Presidency, repudiated the blood atonement doctrine: > You note that I and President Joseph Fielding Smith and some of our early > church leaders have said and written about this doctrine and you asked if > the doctrine of blood atonement is an official doctrine of the Church today. > If by blood atonement is meant the atoning sacrifice of Christ, the answer > is Yes. If by blood atonement is meant the shedding of the blood of men to > atone in some way for their own sins, the answer is No. We do not believe > that it is necessary for men in this day to shed their own blood to receive > a remission of sins. This is said with a full awareness of what I and others > have written and said on this subject in times past. In order to understand > what Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, Charles W. Penrose and others have > said, we must mention that there are some sins for which the blood of Christ > alone does not cleanse a person. These include blasphemy against the Holy > Ghost (as defined by the Church) and that murder which is the unlawful > killing of a human being with malice. However, and this cannot be stressed > too strongly, this law has not been given to the Church at any time in this > dispensation. It has no application whatever to anyone now living whether he > is a member or a non-member of the Church. Blood atonement in a theocracy In McConkie's letter, he suggested that the doctrine could, in fact, be valid, but only in a pure theocracy, although he also stated that \\"Brigham Young and the others were speaking of a theoretical principle that operated in ages past and not in either their or our day.\\" He further stated: > There simply is no such thing among us as a doctrine of blood atonement that > grants a remission of sins or confers any other benefit upon a person > because his own blood is shed for sins. Let me say categorically and > unequivocally that this doctrine can only operate in a day when there is no > separation of Church and State and when the power to take life is vested in > the ruling theocracy as was the case in the day of Moses. Regarding \\"blood atonement\\" in a theocracy, the Encyclopedia of Mormonism states: > Several early Church leaders, most notably Brigham Young, taught that in a > complete theocracy the Lord could require the voluntary shedding of a > murderer's blood-presumably by capital punishment-as part of the process of > Atonement for such grievous sin. This was referred to as \\"blood Atonement.\\" > Since such a theocracy has not been operative in modern times, the practical > effect of the idea was its use as a rhetorical device to heighten the > awareness of Latter-day Saints of the seriousness of murder and other major > sins. This view is not a doctrine of the Church and has never been practiced > by the Church at any time. Relationship to capital punishment in Utah The execution chamber in Utah State Prison. The platform to the left is used for lethal injection. The metal chair to the right is used for execution by firing squad. Joseph Fielding Smith stated: > [T]he founders of Utah incorporated in the laws of the Territory provisions > for the capital punishment of those who wil[l]fully shed the blood of their > fellow men. This law, which is now the law of the State, granted unto the > condemned murderer the privilege of choosing for himself whether he die by > hanging, or whether he be shot, and thus have his blood shed in harmony with > the law of God; and thus atone, so far as it is in his power to atone, for > the death of his victim. Almost without exception the condemned party > chooses the latter death. This is by authority of the law of the land, not > that of the Church. In addition, in his first edition of the book Mormon Doctrine, McConkie opined that because blood atonement requires the \\"spilling of blood upon the ground\\", execution by firing squad was superior to execution by hanging, which would not suffice to create a blood atonement. Regarding this, McConkie commented: > As far as I can see there is no difference between a firing squad, an > electric chair, a gas chamber, or hanging. Death is death and I would > interpret the shedding of man's blood in legal executions as a figurative > expression which means the taking of life. There seems to me to be no > present significance as to whether an execution is by a firing squad or in > some other way. I, of course, deleted my article on \\"hanging\\" from the > Second Edition of Mormon Doctrine because of the reasoning here mentioned. In an interesting contradiction, author Sally Denton in her book American Massacre, states that execution by firing squad was not considered a valid method for performing ‚Äúblood atonement,‚Äù claiming instead that ‚Äúbeheading was the preferred method.‚Äù Denton recounts the execution of John D. Lee for his role in the Mountain Meadows massacre. When offered a choice of execution by hanging, firing squad or beheading, Denton claims that Lee‚Äôs ‚Äúchoice of execution by firing squad sent a clear signal to the faithful that he rejected a spiritual need to atone for any sins.‚Äù Execution by firing squad was banned by the state of Utah on March 15, 2004, but because the law was not retroactive, four inmates then on Utah's death row could still opt for this method of execution. Ronnie Lee Gardner, who had been sentenced to death in October 1985, cited his \\"Mormon heritage\\" for choosing to die by firing squad and fasted for two days before his execution. He felt that lawmakers had been trying to eliminate the firing squad in opposition to popular opinion in Utah because of concern over the state's image during the 2002 Winter Olympics. On the day before Gardner's execution in June 2010, the LDS Church released the following statement: > In the mid-19th century, when rhetorical, emotional oratory was common, some > church members and leaders used strong language that included notions of > people making restitution for their sins by giving up their own lives. > However, so-called \\"blood atonement,\\" by which individuals would be required > to shed their own blood to pay for their sins, is not a doctrine of The > Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We believe in and teach the > infinite and all-encompassing atonement of Jesus Christ, which makes > forgiveness of sin and salvation possible for all people. The practice of \\"blood atonement\\" by Mormon fundamentalist groups In modern times, the concept of \\"blood atonement\\" has been used by a number of fundamentalist splinter groups as an excuse to justify the murder of those who disagree with their leaders or attempt to leave their churches. These groups all claim to follow the \\"original\\" teachings of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young, and they also claim that the LDS Church has strayed from the proper path by banning these practices. This concept is attributable to a tendency towards extreme \\"literalism\\" that exists with regard to the interpretation of early doctrines. ‚Äú[M]any of Joseph Smith‚Äôs followers have to outdo the Prophet himself in the pursuit of literalism, a trend which has led to many doctrinal distortions and ecclesiastical abuses.\\" Warren Jeffs and the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Warren Jeffs, leader of the LDS splinter-group Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (FLDS), a polygamous sect based in Arizona and Utah, USA, has allegedly indicated his desire to implement the doctrine in his church. Former FLDS member Robert Richter reported to the Phoenix New Times that in his sermons, Jeffs repeatedly alluded to blood atonement for serious sins such as murder and adultery. Richter also claims that he was asked to design a thermostat for a high temperature furnace that would be capable of destroying DNA evidence if such \\"atonements\\" were to take place. Dougherty states: ‚ÄùThere is a credible report that Jeffs wants to begin practicing a 19th-century Mormon doctrine calling for the ritualistic human sacrifice of \\"apostates\\" who dissent from his rules.‚Äù Ervil LeBaron and the Church of the Lamb of God Ervil LeBaron, the leader and prophet of the Church of the Lamb of God, initiated a series of killings which ultimately resulted in his being sentenced to life in prison. Before his death in prison, LeBaron wrote a document which he called The Book of the New Covenants. This document listed a number of people who had been disloyal and \\"deserved to die.\\" Copies of this list fell into the hands of LeBaron's followers, who proceeded to administer what they called \\"blood atonement\\" to the individuals listed. One of LeBaron's daughters, Lillian Chynoweth, related an account of some of these killings in the film The God Makers II. Chynoweth discussed the murder of her husband, her brother-in-law and his 8-year-old daughter by her half brothers on 27 June, the 144th anniversary of the death of Joseph Smith. She stated that their names were ‚Äúon the list to be atoned for‚Äù because her father believed that they were ‚Äútraitors to God‚Äôs cause.‚Äù Not explicitly named in the film, this list was Ervil LeBaron's ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Book of the New Covenants‚Äô‚Äô. Chynoweth added that if anything happened to her, the ‚ÄúMormon‚Äù church would be responsible. Shortly after the interview, according to the film, she was found dead in her home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.The Los Angeles Times (September 20, 1992) listed her death as ‚Äòsuicide‚Äô. References to \\"blood atonement\\" in modern works A number of modern authors refer to \\"blood atonement,\\" usually in association with \\"Danites.\\" These references often appear in works which are critical of the LDS Church, and rumors of \\"Danites\\" practicing some form of \\"blood atonement\\" often play a significant role in these accounts. In her book Leaving the Saints, Martha Beck postulates the existence of a \\"Danite\\" band \\"disposing\\" of people who opposed Brigham Young: > Brigham Young formalized and anointed these assassins as the Danites, whose > mission included espionage, the suppression of information, and quietly, > permanently disposing of people who threatened the Mormon prophet or the > Latter-day Saint organization. Again, not many Mormons know this detail of > Church history, but every now and then, Utah papers record murders with > uniquely Mormon flavoring (death by temple-sanctioned methods, for example), > and the word that goes out on the Latter-day grapevine is Danite. LDS > scholars note a contradiction between the existence of a \\"Latter-day > grapevine\\" that is aware of \\"Danites\\" and the statement that \\"not many > Mormons know this detail of Church history\\" In her book American Massacre, Sally Denton claims that the Danites and \\"blood atonement\\" played a prominent role in 19th century Utah society. Denton attributes the creation of the Danites to Joseph Smith and believes that he considered them to be his ‚Äúsecret group of loyalists.‚Äù She also suggests that they became ‚Äúone of the most legendarily feared bands in frontier America.‚Äù According to Denton, this ‚Äúconsecrated, clandestine unit of divinely inspired assassins‚Äù introduced ‚Äúthe ritualized form of murder called blood atonement- providing the victim with eternal salvation by slitting his throat.‚Äù Denton claims that ‚Äúblood atonement‚Äù was one of the doctrines which Mormons held ‚Äúmost sacred‚Äù and ‚Äú[t]hose who dared to flee Zion were hunted down and killed.‚Äù Denton implies that large numbers of such ‚Äúatonements‚Äù occurred during the Mormon reformation of 1856, although ‚Äúnone of the crimes were ever reported in the Deseret News,\\" and the ‚Äúbloody regime...ended with [Jedediah] Grant‚Äôs sudden death, on December 1, 1856.‚Äù Blood atonement has been a part of works such as Levi S. Peterson's The Backslider (1986) and Richard Dutcher's \\"Expiation\\" (2013).

Its local government area is the City of Whittlesea. At the 2016 Census, South Morang had a population of 24,060. The winner of several ‚ÄòTidy Town‚Äô awards, South Morang is known as ‚ÄòThe Jewel In The Crown That Is The Northern Suburbs‚Äô. Originally known as Morang South,Australian Places - Morang South South Morang grew from a country area on the outskirts of Melbourne in the late 1990s/early 2000s to a suburban area with new estates being developed. History Before the arrival of European explorers and farmers, the area now called South Morang was inhabited by the Wurundjeri balug and Wurundjeri Willam clans. In 1824, William Hovell and Hamilton Hume were the first Europeans to set foot in what is now the City of Whittlesea when they were going from Sydney to Port Philip Bay. On 14 December 1824, they wrote in their journals: Having passed through the first plain... myself and Mr Hume ascended a high but single hill. In front from which we saw a very gratifying sight. This was a very extensive plain extending from west to south east for several miles with patches of forest which appear to separate one plain from another. But the whole appeared in front, say south, to be level but in parts in the plains some hills arose of a conical shape, with only here and there a few trees upon them. And all the soil of best quality. https://www.whittlesea.vic.gov.au/media/1759/city-of- whittlesea-heritage-study-volume-1.pdf The description showed that the land was good for farming, and it was settled by John Batman's pastoral group in the 1830s. Robert Hoddle surveyed the land in 1837. The land failed to sell at first and was opened to pastoral leases. It was leased by William Forlonge in 1846. Sign at Quarry HillsBy 1840, the area was owned by rich landowners. By the 1850s, the area was used for farming. Much evidence of the farming, such as dry stone walls, can still be seen today.In 1852, William Ford Cleeland bought 256 hectares and sundivided and sold the land, doubling his money. Individual land holdings have decreased in size over time. Morang South Post Office opened on 24 November 1873. The post office has now moved to Westfield Plenty Valley. The railway from Melbourne to here was finished in 1889. The old South Morang railway station served the Whittlesea steam railway line until the 1950s. It was further north than the current station.  Facilities  Mill Park Library is the nearest public library and is managed by Yarra Plenty Regional Library. The South Morang Farmers & Makers Market was launched in May 2019. Carome Homestead is home to Two Beans and a Farm cafe and the Mernda Community Garden at Carome. The Plenty Road car park is a 11km stretch of road.

From all the current Road works being implemented to improve the northern gate way. From the Ring Road Plenty Road exit in Bundoora to Bridge Inn Road in Mernda. Today South Morang's ethnically diverse surrounding suburbs (such as Mill Park and Epping) have added to its ethnic diversity as residents of those suburbs move to South Morang. The most common ancestries in South Morang (According to the 2016 census) were Australian born 17.0%, English 16.3%, Italian 12.8%, Indian 6.2% and Macedonian 5.4%.

His academic major was geology. The jobs he worked to pay for school included a sales agent for the Saturday Evening Post and a summer on the road with the Barnum and Bailey Circus (which later became the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus). Professional life Champion experienced wild swings in fortune throughout his long life. In addition to various business ventures and investments, he held full or partial interest in a gold mine in Colorado and the Champion lead mine in Niranda, Ontario, Canada. A local newspaper obituary calls him a \\"radio pioneer\\" saying that after graduating from Yale, Champion moved to the Boston area and went to work with Lee DeForest, inventor of the vacuum tube, and goes on to say that he \\"helped set up and operate Boston's first radio transmitters\\". Kalah Champion invented the board game of Kalah in 1940 and worked for years to popularize the game in the United States. He long held that the game has intrinsic educational value and held other benefits. Family history has it that in 1910 he first read about ancient mancala games, on which he based Kalah. He started manufacturing Kalah game sets in Mystic, Connecticut, about 1940 and later in Salem, Massachusetts, Brockton, Massachusetts, and finally Holbrook, Massachusetts, in around 1960.

Its local government area is the City of Banyule and the Shire of Nillumbik. At the 2016 Census, Eltham North had a population of 6,805. Eltham North is a residential suburb 20 km north- east of central Melbourne. Originally an outlying rural part of Eltham, it became a separate locality with the opening of the Eltham North Primary School in 1925. At that time the locality was known as Glen Park, and the name was recorded in street directories until the 1960s. Nevertheless, the postal district was Eltham North. Diamond Creek separates Eltham North from Eltham and was the dividing boundary between municipalities. Eltham North was thus in Heidelberg city and, from 1964, in Diamond Valley Shire. In 2001 Eltham North's western boundary moved from Ryans Road into St Helena. As a result, Eltham North has St Helena secondary college within its boundary. Eltham North shares the same postcode as Eltham (3095). History Eltham North Post Office opened around 1934 and closed in 1966. The graveyard was founded by Glen and Katherine for whom which the local Glen Katherine Primary school is named. Eltham North, once known as Northern Eltham, was renamed in 1934 to Eltham North by The Mayor at the time. Facilities The State primary school (538 pupils, 2014) is in the east of the suburb, adjacent to the Glen Park Gospel Hall and local shops. There is a kindergarten in Glen Park Road. Eltham North has numerous bushland reserves and playgrounds. In May 2020 the Victorian State Government announced that a new off-leash park will be established in Eltham North. The suburb is home to the North Eltham Wanderers Cricket Club, the Eltham Redbacks Football Club, and the Eltham North Jets Basketball Club.

Aurora has 69 storeys comprising four floors of 18 penthouses, 54 skyhomes (two-storey luxury apartments) and 408 apartments. It features a heated pool, entertainment area and cinema for residents. Aurora Tower opened to the public on 5 May 2006. Aurora was designed to use iris recognition technology for security purposes, however this technology has not yet been put into use. Along with the intercom system and lifts, it has had problems functioning correctly. Another criticism has been the lack of car parks. The Tower is near central transport links such as the Central railway station. The Tower is also close to shopping areas such as QueensPlaza, Queen Street Mall, Wintergarden and Elizabeth Street all of which feature shopping, restaurants, bars, and nightclubs. Other Brisbane landmarks such as the Story Bridge, Central Plaza 1 and Brisbane City Hall are visible from inside the tower. To ensure occupant comfort at the top of the building wind tunnel testing was conducted by the structural designers. Other innovative design and construction measures were needed due to the slender form of the building. In January 2008, the body corporate informed owners that the building's management rights were acquired by the Oaks Group. At the same time an application with the Brisbane City Council to change the class of the building to short-term accommodation by the Oaks Group, raised concerns by residents that the building's facilities may be overwhelmed by hotel guests. The site of Aurora Tower was proposed in 1992 to be the site for the Brisbane 2000 tower. The proposed tower was to be 250 m (820 ft) tall, which at the time would have made it one of the tallest buildings in Australia.

Described to be from \\"the bush\\", Ansell became famous in 1977 after he was stranded in extremely remote country in the Northern Territory, and the story of his survival for 56 days with limited supplies became news headlines around the world. Consequently, he served as the inspiration for Paul Hogan's character in the 1986 film Crocodile Dundee. In 1999, he was killed in a shootout by policemen of the Northern Territory Police.  Early life  Ansell was born in Murgon, Queensland, to George William Ansell and Eva May Ansell, the third of four children. He then moved to the Northern Territory at the age of 15. As a young man, he made a living hunting feral water buffalo in the Top End, the meat being exported to foreign markets.  Ordeal  In May 1977, shortly after completing a buffalo catching job in Kununurra, Western Australia, Ansell decided to travel to the Victoria River on what he claimed was a fishing trip. He was not specific about his plans, only telling his then-girlfriend Lorraine he would be back in a few months. When Ansell's motorboat was capsized and sunk by \\"something big\\" (he sensationally claimed it was a whale), no one knew where to find him. Ansell managed to board his tender, a small dinghy with only a single oar, and retrieve his two 8-week-old bull terriers and a small amount of equipment (a rifle, a knife, some canned food, and bedding). But with no fresh water, Ansell was in a perilous situation, stranded almost from the nearest permanent human settlement, and one of his dogs had a broken leg. During the night, Ansell's dinghy drifted out to sea, eventually washing up on a small island at the mouth of the Fitzmaurice River, north of the Victoria. Over the next 48 hours, Ansell travelled up the Fitzmaurice on tidal flows, becoming severely dehydrated but eventually finding fresh water above the saltwater tidal range. Ansell subsisted on wild cattle and buffalo, hunting by day to feed himself and his dogs. He sometimes resorted to drinking cattle blood as a substitute for water, the fluids helping to maintain his body's electrolyte balance. He was also able to follow bees to their hive to retrieve honey. During the night, Ansell slept in a tree fork out of reach of crocodiles, although he shared the tree with a brown tree snake. At one point, he shot a crocodile, whose head he kept as a souvenir. Ansell never counted on being rescued; he had told others he would be away for months, and any search parties would be combing over the Victoria River, not the Fitzmaurice. He rested his hope on walking overland to a pastoral station when the wet season began. One day, Ansell heard the distinctive tinkling of horse-bells, which drew him to two Aboriginal stockmen and their cattle manager, Luke McCall. Although he was somewhat emaciated, Ansell was otherwise healthy. Once back home, he apparently kept his seven-week ordeal to himself, fearing he would upset his mother with his recklessness. He later claimed the experience was hardly a big deal, explaining: > All the blokes up in this country, who work with cattle, ringers, stockmen, > bull-catches, whatever, all of them, have really narrow shaves all the time. > But they never talk about it...I think the opinion is that if you come > through in one piece, and you're still alive, then nothing else really > matters. It's like going out to shoot a kangaroo. You don't come back and > say you missed by half-an-inch. You either got him or you didn't. So that is > how I looked at it. Until the paper got hold of the story, and that changed > a lot of things. Newspapers dubbed Ansell the \\"modern-day Robinson Crusoe\\" and he was making headlines by August 1977.  Media attention  In 1977, after becoming a sensation in the Australian media following his harrowing ordeal in the Outback, Ansell met Joanne van Os, 22, a radio operator originally from Melbourne who was then working at the remote Aboriginal community of Wadeye. The two fell in love and married, having two sons: Callum (born 1979) and Shawn (born 1981). The family spent much of their early years living \\"under just a canvass sheet.\\" With no electricity or running water, they cooked by campfire and communicated by radio. In 1979, filmmaker Richard Oxenburgh asked Ansell to relive his adventures in the documentary film To Fight the Wild, which the following year was published as a book. Although both accepted Ansell's version of events uncritically, his story was frequently treated with skepticism by locals in the Top End. Some believed it was a publicity stunt and others wondered why Ansell did not follow the river downstream to the nearest town. When Ansell was asked in interviews what he was doing in the remote Australian wilderness by himself, he claimed he was on a fishing trip. Privately, however, he confided to friends that he was actually poaching crocodiles. In 1981, Ansell was invited to Sydney where he was interviewed by English journalist Michael Parkinson for his television program Parkinson. Ansell attended the interview barefoot. While staying at the famous five-star Sebel Townhouse Hotel, he slept in his sleeping bag on the floor rather than on his bed, and was reportedly mystified by his room's bidet. Ansell's interview and curious city antics sparked Paul Hogan's interest, inspiring him and co-writers Ken Shadie, and John Cornell to create the character Mick \\"Crocodile\\" Dundee. Following the unexpected blockbuster success of Crocodile Dundee, Ansell unsuccessfully took Hogan to court. His inability to profit from the films remained a source of bitterness in his life. According to Ansell's friends, he was \\"at one\\" with Arnhem Land's Indigenous Australians, and like the film character, he spoke Urapunga fluently, having become a \\"fully initiated white man.\\" An \\"unassuming achiever\\" who embodied \\"the spirit of the Territory,\\" Ansell was named Territorian of the Year in 1987 for helping to put Top End on the world map. Journalist Chips Mackinolty, who met Ansell in the 1980s, described him as \\"articulate and likable, if somewhat intense.\\" However, Ansell's new-found fame alienated him from his peers, and he later lamented of his rejection back home: > Proving the point about the story being true or not wouldn't matter that > much. Because the people it would affect, who affect me, are the people who > live where I work, and know me. And people up here have a phobia about > appearing on the media. So that was detrimental to my standing in their > eyes...they thought it was a terrible thing to do.  Later life  In 1985, Ansell borrowed money and secured a pastoral lease in northern Arnhem Land. He started up Melaleuca, a cattle station east of Darwin, near Kakadu National Park, named after the Melaleuca paper bark trees which dot the landscape. The Ansells built their homestead on the station, not far from the Mary River. In the 1980s, he found himself in a protracted dispute with the Northern Territory government over the controversial Bovine Brucellosis and Tuberculosis Eradication Campaign (BTEC). To comply with BTEC, Ansell was forced to kill 3,000 head of feral buffalo on his property. He had originally planned to capture and domesticate the animals, creating a pastoral herd that would have afforded his family a comfortable lifestyle. Arguing that money spent on the BTEC program \\"would be better spent on research on AIDS,\\" Ansell considered the destruction of the animals an outrageous waste of good livestock. Three neighboring graziers were eventually awarded $100,000 in government loans, but Ansell was never compensated for his losses. Mimosa pigra weeds also began taking over the floodplain, rendering it useless. With no money to fight the invasive weeds, the Ansells were forced to sell their cattle station in June 1991. The couple's 15-year marriage soon disintegrated and the Ansells divorced. Depressed, unemployed, and cash-strapped, Ansell began growing marijuana, later becoming a user of amphetamines. In June 1996, he began dating Cherie Hewson. The couple lived at Urapanga Station, an Aboriginal outstation on the Roper River about south of Darwin. Over the next several years, the couple's drug addiction became more destructive, culminating in a psychotic episode that ultimately claimed Ansell's life in a shootout with police.  Death  Ansell was killed following a police shootout on 3 August 1999. The deadly altercation began at approximately 10:45 a.m. on the roadblocked intersection of Stuart Highway and Old Bynoe Road, near Acacia Hills. Ansell had ambushed Sergeant Glen Anthony Huitson and his partner, Constable James O'Brien, with a shot from Ansell's .30-30 lever- action rifle deflecting off a police car and fatally striking Huitson in the abdomen, below his bulletproof vest. A gun-battle immediately erupted involving numerous officers of the Adelaide River Police Station. About five minutes into the fight, Ansell was shot dead. O'Brien killed Ansell with a shotgun after unloading on Ansell's position with his Glock pistol, having missed all his previous shots. The battle ended the authorities' 12-hour search for an attacker who shot at two nearby residences the previous night. Ansell's girlfriend Hewson was with him but escaped before the gun-battle occurred; she fled, eventually turning herself in to Brisbane police on 7 August 1999. Although police were at a loss to explain Ansell's motive (he could have easily escaped the roadblock had he chosen to), it was later determined that Ansell had been raving about Freemasons prior to his death; he was distraught, apparently convinced that Freemasons had kidnapped his two sons and were now stalking him. During the coroner's inquest, psychiatrist Robert Parker made the following observations on Ansell's mental state before his death: > There is no doubt that Ansell was affected by amphetamine intoxication prior > to his fatal interaction with Sergeant Huitson...Ansell's behaviour prior to > the initial shots being fired is consistent with amphetamine intoxication > with restlessness, hypervigilance, anxiety, anger and impaired judgement > (DSM IV). He was also affected by a paranoid psychotic state which is > typical of chronic amphetamine use. Parker also determined that Ansell and Hewson had developed a shared psychosis, stating: > ...the two of them developed a shared delusional state or folie a deux...It > is possible, therefore, that one or both parties had an underlying > vulnerability to mental illness which was enhanced and sustained by their > regular use of amphetamines. An autopsy of Ansell's remains showed he had suffered 30 entry wounds or grazes, all caused by shotgun pellets; the fatal injury was caused by a pellet that had perforated his aorta. The cause of death was determined to be \\"haemorrhage from multiple gunshot wounds involving various parts of the body.\\" Following the request of his sons, Ansell was given a full Aboriginal burial at Mount Catt, Arnhem Land. His funeral was attended by his sons and parents.

It was often called a Palmtop PC, and it was notable that it was, with some minor exceptions, a MS-DOS-compatible computer in a palmtop format, complete with a monochrome graphic display, QWERTY keyboard, serial port, and PCMCIA expansion slot. Description Size comparison with 2007 Apple iPhone Input is accomplished via a small QWERTY-keyboard with a numeric keypad, enclosed in a clamshell-style case, less than about 25% of the size of a standard notebook computer. The palmtop runs for about 30‚Äì40 hours on two size AA alkaline or Ni-Cd rechargeable cells and can charge batteries (both Ni-Cd and NiMH) via a 12 V DC wall adapter. The HP 200LX has an Intel 80186 compatible embedded central processing unit named \\"Hornet\\", which runs at ~7.91 megahertz (which can be upgraded or overclocked to up to 15.8 MHz) and 1, 2 or 4 MB of memory, of which 640 KB is RAM and the rest can be used for expanded memory (EMS) or memory-based storage space. After-market updates can bring the memory chips to up to 64 MB, which frees the PCMCIA slot for modem or ethernet card use. The Silicom, Accton 2212/2216, Netgear FA411, and Sohoware ND5120 network cards were compatible. Being IBM PC/XT compatible and running MS-DOS 5.0 from ROM, the HP 200LX can run virtually any program that would run on a full-size PC compatible computer as long as the code is written for the Intel 8086, 8088 or 80186 CPU and can run using CGA graphics. It can also run programs written for the 80286 CPU, provided they do not require the use of protected mode. It has a 16-bit PCMCIA Type II expansion slot that supports 5 V at 150 mA maximum, a SIR compatible infrared port and a full serial port (but with a proprietary mini connector for space constraint reasons). The built-in software suite runs from ROM and includes the Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.4 spreadsheet, a calendar, a phone book, a terminal, Lotus cc:Mail and a capable scientific/business calculator (among other applications). With a large compactflash storage card and a serial mouse, even Microsoft Windows 3.0 can be run on the palmtop. Running Windows was limited by the hardware, and the maximum version that could be run was Windows 3.0 in Real Mode. However, Word 1.x and Excel 2.x for Windows would run (since they could run in Real Mode), allowing for the authoring of MS Office format- compatible files. The 640√ó200 resolution CGA compatible 4-shade gray-scale LCD screen has no back light. An electroluminescent technology back light installation is available from a third party since 2004, but keen eyesight is still required to use the small palmtop effectively without resorting to using its 2√ó and 4√ó zoom modes. While true CGA displays do not allow for redefinable fonts in text mode and support a hardware code page 437, the HP 95LX supports code page 850 instead. Starting with the HP 100LX the LX series even supports user-switchable text mode ROM fonts for both code page 437 and 850 as well as software-definable RAM fonts (for codepages 437G, 437T, 852, 866 via KEYBEZ). Lotus 1-2-3 internally uses the Lotus International Character Set (LICS), but characters are translated to code page 850 for display and printing purposes. Model variants=HP 100LX The HP 100LX Palmtop PC (F1020A for the 1 MB, F1022A for the 2 MB model), also known as project Cougar, is the direct predecessor of the 200LX. It was released in 1993 and available in International English, U.S. English, French, German and Spanish variants with localized keyboard and messages. It is almost the same, including the Hornet CPU and MS-DOS 5.0, but with earlier built-in application versions. HP Palmtop FX The HP Palmtop FX is a variant of the HP 100LX with up to 2 MB flashable memory in 1993.http://www.hpl.hp.com/hpjournal/pdfs/IssuePDFs/1996-06.pdf FAT flash disk images could be created and written to drive F: by a special FLASHDSK.EXE utility.http://oilman.new21.net/zero/zboard.php?id=LXAP&page;=3&sn1;=&divpage;=1&sn;=off&ss;=on‚âª=on&select;_arrange=headnum&desc;=asc&no;=1234 According to one source, it was developed for a Korean insurance company.http://www.hpmuseum.org/therest.htm HP 200LX AIA The HP 200LX AIA was a 2 MB double-speed variant of the HP 200LX manufactured for the insurance company American International Assurance (AIA).http://jimmyauw.com/2012/06/19/restoring-vintage-gear-hp-palmtop-200lx/ HP 1000CX The HP 1000CX Palmtop PC (F1203A for the 1 MB in March 1995, F1222A for the 2 MB model in February 1997), also known as project Puma, is an economy version of the 200LX with its Hornet CPU but without any built-in software except the MS-DOS 5.0 operating system in ROM. It was in widespread use among, for example, Coca-Cola warehouse managers, who loaded their own logistics software onto the machine. It has a black clamshell, while the 200LX has a dark green casing. HP OmniGo 700LX The HP OmniGo 700LX Communicator Plus (F1206A), codenamed \\"Columbia\\", was a project of the HP calculator branch in Singapore. The HP OmniGo 700LX is essentially a 2 MB HP 200LX including its Hornet CPU redesigned to piggyback a Nokia 2110 GSM mobile telephone for wireless mobility. The HP 200LX motherboard was factory-modified to support a second PCMCIA slot for a Nokia Data Card. Owing to the relatively large size of the Nokia telephone, the HP OmniGo 700LX has a large, pebble- shaped casing, making it a handheld with a phone attached. It was announced in late 1995 as part of plans for a collaboration between HP and Nokia. Shipment starting in March 1996. http://www.palmtoppaper.com/ptphtml/24/pt240021.htm The production of the HP OmniGo 700LX ceased after the Nokia 2110 mobile telephone was rendered obsolete by later telephones. The device can be seen as a forerunner to the first smartphone, Nokia's Communicator 9000. Related models=HP 95LX The HP 95LX Palmtop PC (F1000A for the 512 KB, F1010A for the 1 MB model) introduced the basic design in April 1991. It was known internally as project Jaguar. It had a NEC V20 CPU (an enhanced Intel 8088 clone with Intel 80186 instruction set compatibility and an additional Intel 8080 emulation mode, running at 5.37 MHz), but was hampered in running PC applications because of its quarter-CGA resolution LCD screen and MDA compatible (instead of CGA) graphics chip. The HP 95LX for the most part only displayed graphics in a special LX graphics mode. It ran MS-DOS 3.22 and had Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2 built in. It also included a CR2032 battery for memory backup when the AA mains ran out. HP OmniGo 100 The HP OmniGo 100 Organizer Plus (F1305A/F1310A) was designed as a more sophisticated successor to the LX series, and incorporated the HP-12C calculator functionality. It was GUI based, controlled by pen input or keyboard. However, it lacked the versatility of running unmodified DOS programs. The normal operation mode was with DOS-based PEN/GEOS 2.1 and Graffiti handwriting recognition running on Datalight ROM-DOS 6.22. It was not widely accepted as a calculator replacement, and Palm and Pocket PCs became acceptable as PDAs. Equipped with 1 MB of RAM, it was based on the Vadem VG230/V5H,http://www.palmtoppaper.com/ptphtml/24/pt24001e.htm a highly integrated system controller with 16 MHz NEC V30HL CPU, instruction set compatible with the Intel 80186. Current usage Although this product line was discontinued by HP in order to introduce their Windows CE product line (starting with the HP 300LX), a strong interest in this hardware continued. It was the last palmtop from HP which ran the MS-DOS operating system, for which there is much software from desktop PCs, and it came with a useful bundle of software including 1-2-3 and Quicken. Compared to machines with Windows-based operating systems such as CE, DOS programs are more compact and efficient and, with programs such as Software Carousel, many applications programs could be loaded at once. Third-party upgrades, repairs and renovations are available to maintain and extend the device.hermocom.com offers professional repair service in Germany. Rundel Datentechnik also offers professional repair service in Germany.Thaddeus Computing offers professional repair service in USA.Michel Bel can help with repairs in the Netherlands. Japan Because of its small size, the HP 200LX was very popular in Japan, so much so that its demise prompted an open-source initiative to design and market an AMD Elan SC400-based replacement to fill its place. This 'Morphy One' club organization created blueprints for the device but no prototype was ever built for reasons which remain unclear. Some argue it was a scam scheme as hundreds of people lost deposits they placed on the new palmtop in advance. The project leaders argued that key electronic components were unavailable due to strong demand from the mobile telephone manufacturing industry. Common problems *A common problem with the HP 200LX case is related to the injected-molded case top. The right hinge to case blend had poor flow in the process, resulting in the formation of a crack which propagates across the hinge under stress, causing failure. This can be reinforced and repaired using super glue, among other methods. * Another weakness of the design is the failure of the case opening latch. This problem can easily be repaired by placing a thin slice cut from rubber eraser within the latch as a \\"spring\\". * Only high quality AA rechargeable batteries should be used in the HP 200LX, as battery leaks can destroy the LCD's flat video cable. * Aging models may lose pixel columns from the display. This is caused by detachment of one or more pins of one of the SMD (Surface Mounted Device) chips in the display itself. In many cases this may be repaired by reflowing (resoldering) of the pins on the offending chip, either with an SMD reflow tool, or a soldering iron with a very fine (0.2 mm) tip. * Under heavy use, the space bar and enter bar can become detached. This requires keyboard replacement. * Fixing unresponsive keyboard keys. Inside the HP 200LX, the keyboard connects to the main board via a \\"ribbon\\" that has graphite pads which make physical contact to gold pads plated onto the main board. Unresponsive keys occur when this connection grows weak. This can be fixed by applying conductive silver paint (such as from a circuitwriter pen) to each graphite pad on the \\"ribbon\\". This is delicate work, and putting the HP 200LX back together after disassembly may be problematic for those who have little experience with electronics repair. However, the conductive silver paint will fully fix the problem if applied with care. Exceptions to 100% IBM PC compatibility * The HP 100LX/HP 200LX's digital-to-analog converter cannot play audio tones; instead, it monitors battery life and charging. * The device does not provide the BIOS service (INT 13h) for reading from a hard disk. Drivers have been partially written for this purpose (to boot MINIX 2.0). Other notes * The HP 200LX was used on board the NASA Discovery OV103 Mission STS-95 (the last mission of Senator John Glenn) in an Electronic Nose (E-Nose) experiment (the device was developed jointly by Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech)). The experiment, as managed by Dr. Dan Karmon of JPL, was successful. * The HP 200LX can play video, and sound files using software from Stefan Peichl in relatively low quality. It is also capable of sound recording, though this is, again, in relatively low quality. There is no known compatible PCMCIA sound card for the HP 200LX. * Software and hardware is available which will allow the HP 200LX to surf the Internet. *The serial numbers printed on the HP machines 100LX, 200LX, 1000CX and OmniGo 700LX have the following meaning: : XXYWWNNNNN : XX = the country of manufacturing (e.g., SG = Singapore etc) : Y = the year of manufacturing; last digit (e.g., 6 = 1996) : WW = the week of the year of manufacturing : NNNNN = the number of the specific unit manufactured in specified week Easter eggs There are many easter eggs built into the HP 200LX. The known ones are listed as follows: Hidden gallery This easter egg is on the HP 200LX in the built in game, \\"Lair of Squid\\". During the startup screen of the game, if the user types the word \\"gallery\\" (\\"gallerie\\" on a French palmtop; \\"siegergalerie\\" on a German palmtop; \\"galeria\\" on a Spanish palmtop) he/she is placed in a \\"part\\" of the maze that contains photographs of the primary software developers that worked on the HP 200LX. The user may exit from this gallery by exiting through the door at the end of the corridor. The software developers in the photographs are listed starting from left to right, then left to right and so on as follows: * Andy Gryc * Pat Megowan * Everett Kaser * Bill Johnson * Lynn Winter * Susan Wechsler * Eric Evett The last panel on the right of the corridor contains a thank you message: The photographs of the developers have been described as \\"a-maze-ing\\".

After World War II, major traffic congestion occurred in the area around Richmond and Petersburg along U.S. Route 1 and U.S. Route 301. This was particularly true where these two major routes shared the same roadway for much of the distance between the two cities, as well as bridges across the James River and Appomattox River. To help alleviate the problems, in 1955 the Virginia General Assembly created a political subdivision, the Richmond Petersburg Turnpike Authority. The authority was administered by a board of directors. Its members were appointed by the local governing bodies of the jurisdictions through which the turnpike passed, one member from each locality. It was given the mission to sell toll revenue bonds to build and operate a new toll highway parallel to the existing US 1 and US 301 between Henrico County just north of Richmond and Dinwiddie County just south of Petersburg, with new bridges over the two major rivers. Opened in 1958, and funded through toll revenue bonds, it was conceived prior to the creation of the Interstate Highway System. Tolls were removed completely in 1992. Today, the former Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike forms of Interstate 95 in central Virginia as well as the northernmost of Interstate 85 in Petersburg and Dinwiddie County. The of Interstate 64 which overlap Interstate 95 in Richmond were also part of the turnpike. History In 1826, a privately operated toll road known as the Manchester and Petersburg Turnpike opened that extended through Chesterfield County between Richmond and Petersburg. At some point it became known as the Richmond and Petersburg Turnpike.http://www.hmdb.org/results.asp?County=Colonial%20Heights&State;=Virginia In 1922 much of that route was renamed Jefferson Davis Highway and in 1926 was also designated U.S. Routes 1 and 301. Some Chesterfield County and Colonial Heights land deeds still reference the name Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike for properties along Jefferson Davis Highway. Historical accounts of 1864 Civil War events mention that name as well.Chesterfield Heritage Alliance: Bermuda Hundredhttp://www.colonial- heights.com/HistorySwiftCrk.htm#The%20Battle%20of%20Swift%20Creek,%20May%209,%201864. Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike Authority The Richmond-Petersburg turnpike under construction, as it passes through Jackson Ward. After World War II, the busy north-south corridor in central Virginia shared by US 1 and US 301 and the Jefferson Davis Memorial Highway through the cities of Richmond, Colonial Heights and Petersburg and along the Jefferson Davis Highway between the cities was heavily developed commercially. With only four traffic lanes and long stretches of undivided roadway, it became a major area of traffic congestion, as well as the site of occasional spectacular and deadly head-on collisions.Richmond Interstates and Expressways In 1955, prior to the creation of the U.S. Interstate Highway System, the Virginia General Assembly created the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike Authority as an independent state agency to administer (design, finance, acquire right-of-way, construct, operate, collect tolls, and maintain) the new Turnpike of the same name. The new toll road was planned with only 15 exits, and most of these were well away from the highly developed commercial areas along parallel US 1 and US 301\\\\. Funded with proceeds from toll revenue bonds sold by the Authority, the -long road cost $76.7 million to build, including new bridges over the James River in Richmond and the Appomattox River between Colonial Heights and Petersburg. It featured six lanes from the northern entrance to just south of the new James River Bridge in Richmond, and four lanes from that point south. At Petersburg, the new Turnpike split into two branches, one leading to US 301 south towards Emporia and Weldon, North Carolina, and the other to US 1 south, which led to South Hill and Raleigh, North Carolina. The new expressway opened on July 1, 1958, and in August, the State Highway Commission designated it as part of Interstate 95. A piece near Petersburg was designated Interstate 85, and the turnpike became a grandfathered part of the Interstate Highway System even though no federal aid was used to build it. The new roadway achieved the intended diversion of long distance traffic. As earlier feared, hotels, motels, tourist homes and cabins, and restaurants along the bypassed highways suffered tremendous loss of business, and many failed. However, due to the relatively high rate of tolls on the Turnpike, the blow was softened by a continually increasing traffic flow and patronage of motorists wanting to avoid the tolls, who continued to use the old roads. This practice of avoiding roads and bridges with tolls is known as \\"shunpiking\\". Jackson Ward The construction of the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike in the 1950s led to the destruction of many blocks of homes and businesses in Jackson Ward, Richmond's oldest historically African-American community. The highway bisected the neighborhood and has had irreparable effects on its fabric. As was common in mid-century planning practices, lower class or black neighborhoods were often targeted and destroyed. This highway, along with the construction of Richmond's Downtown Expressway, were large factors in the decline and subsequent decay in many urban areas of the city. Expansion View south along the former Richmond-Petersburg Turnpike in Colonial Heights The original toll revenue bonds were retired in 1975. However, in 1973, the General Assembly passed legislation which transferred the Authority's duties to the Virginia Department of Highways, the predecessor agency to the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT). The Authority as an independent entity ceased to exist and the Board of Directors disbanded. In December 1973, additional bonds were issued to provide much-needed improvements to the heavily traveled highway. Unlike the original toll revenue bonds which were backed only by toll revenue, the new bonds were backed by the Commonwealth of Virginia. They were still funded by toll revenue but the bondholders had more security with state backing and thus offered lower interest rates. A primary factor in turning the turnpike over to the Virginia Department of Highways was to obtain full state control since the state was taking the risk on the bonds. The improvements included widening to six lanes of from just south of the James River Bridge at Richmond and complete reconstruction of the I-85 and I-95 interchange in downtown Petersburg. Several other major interchanges including Chester/Hopewell and Broad Street at downtown Richmond were also reconstructed. Once the bonds were paid off, toll revenue funded safety improvements on the entire turnpike which included sign and guardrail replacements as well as replacing most of the median guardrail with Jersey style concrete median barriers. Toll money was also spent on nearby road projects such as the Temple Avenue extension (State Route 144). Since interstate travelers were paying most of the tolls that was then being spent on other projects, toll removal became a local political issue that the General Assembly eventually decided to approximately coincide with the opening of the parallel Interstate 295. Tolls removed, modernization Miami (Florida) and Atlanta (Georgia) are signed. Tolls were removed from all portions of the former Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike in 1992, although the road now connects with several newer locally oriented toll facilities, including Richmond Metropolitan Authority's Downtown Expressway (State Route 195) which interchanges with the former Turnpike on the I-95 James River Bridge, and the Pocahontas Parkway (State Route 895) which connects I-95 at exit 67 with Interstate 295 and the Richmond International Airport. An old office building built for the Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike is still in use by VDOT as the Chester headquarters office and still has the lettering \\"Richmond Petersburg Turnpike\\" displayed on the building which faces the interstate, it is located at exit 61A on southbound Interstate 95. Today, the former Richmond‚ÄìPetersburg Turnpike with the I-95 designation, and parallel Interstate 295 (which forms an eastern bypass of Richmond and Petersburg) carry some of the heaviest traffic flows of any portion of the busy eastern U.S. corridor between Florida and New England.

Historian says Varadkar has breached letter and spirit of the Belfast Agreement, irishtimes.com, 19 July 2019 He studied at TCD, where he was elected a Scholar in 1986, before completing his doctoral dissertation, Anglo- Prussian relations, 1804‚Äì1806: The Napoleonic Threat, at Cambridge under the supervision of Tim Blanning in 1993. A Fellow of Peterhouse, he lectures and leads seminars on international history since 1945.Brendan Simms' webpage at the Department of Politics and International Studies, Cambridge University In addition to his academic work, he also serves as the president of the Henry Jackson Society, which advocates the view that supporting and promoting liberal democracy and liberal interventionism should be an integral part of Western foreign policy. He is President of the Project for Democratic Union, a Munich-based student-organised think tank.Brendan Simms , theguardian.com He has advocated that the Eurozone should create a United States of Europe. Family Brendan Simms is a grand-nephew of the leading Church of Ireland ecumenist and scholar, former Archbishop of Dublin and Armagh, George Otto Simms. He is also a grand-nephew of Brian Goold-Verschoyle, a member of the Communist Party of Ireland, who became a Soviet spy and died in a Soviet gulag in 1942. Simms himself was raised in the Catholic faith. Reviews=Europe: The Struggle for SupremacyRichard Evans review= Richard J. Evans was critical of Europe: The Struggle for Supremacy saying that Simms had overly favoured observations by A. J. P. Taylor of a Hobbsean view of European history, focusing on periods of strife while neglecting periods of cooperation between European states. Evans described the book as a \\"one-sided picture\\", adding that even Simms has to acknowledge that there were periods of cooperation. Evans also criticised Simms' emphasis on the primacy of foreign policy, noting that it leads Simms to odd conclusions such as the revolt against Charles I being driven by failure to protect Protestant German princes - the cause was domestic religious conflict. Evans also cites counterexamples to Simms' assertion that conflict and foreign policy drove democratisation and the development of civil liberties: the Reign of Terror, the limitations on civil liberties in Britain during the Napoleonic Wars, and the rise of Mussolini in Italy. He also points out that Simms rarely mentions economic factors, saying that when he does \\"it is often breathtakingly wrong-headed\\", citing Simms blame of the great depression in Germany on the French government rather than blind adherence to the gold standard and the withdrawal of U.S. loans after the Wall Street Crash. Evans criticises Simms for obsessing with Germany as the driving force in European history, pointing out that Simms ignores periods when French expansionism was the motor for war. =Norman Stone review= Norman Stone praised the book as \\"lively and erudite\\". He also praised the book for the focus on Germany and Simm's knowledge of it though he qualifies it by saying Simms is stronger on the 18th century than the 20th century due to the volume of material to be covered in the latter. =Noel Malcolm review= Noel Malcolm praised Simms as \\"a historian of unusual range and ability\\", saying that \\"knowing what he wants to say is one of Simms‚Äôs strengths\\". On the whole Malcolm praised the book, though regarding Simms' emphasis on the primacy of foreign policy in European affairs, Malcolm did wonder if there may be counterexamples, such as those where the foreign/domestic distinction is less clear. Hitler: Only the World Was Enough Richard Evans was also critical of Hitler:Only the World Was Enough, arguing that Simms' claim of Hitler embracing socialism does not stand up to examination. Simms cited violence of Nazi stormtroopers against conservatives, but Evans noted that socialists and communists were the overwhelming majority of the 200,000 Germans thrown into concentration camps during Hitler's first year in power. Simms claimed that Hitler's rhetoric was more anti-capitalist than anti-communist, but Evans shows that the anti-communist rhetoric dominated the political portion of Mein Kampf. Simms claims that Hitler had managed \\"to nationalise German industrialists by making them instruments of his political will\\" which Evans disputes - the reason Thyssen and Krupp supported him was that Hitler's rearmament policies were profitable for them. Simms claimed that Kristallnacht was caused by \\"Roosevelt‚Äôs hostility to Hitler and his defence of the Jews\\", that Operation Barbarossa \\"was to be a campaign of conquest and annihilation, for reasons more to do with Anglo- America than the Soviet Union itself\\" and that The Holocaust was \\"primarily driven ‚Ä¶ by his fear of Britain and the United States\\". Evans comments \\"All this is nonsense, and indeed, Simms is forced to contradict himself by the sheer weight of the evidence against his thesis.\\" As an example of where Simms is forced to contradict himself Evans points to Operation Barbarossa, which Simms concedes to have been \\"part of a much broader ideological war against Bolshevism\\". Evans also points out that Hitler's genocidal anti-Semitism was based on a paranoid view that Jews were inherently disposed to subversion and conspiracy. Evans summarizes the book with \\"In the end, Simms hasn‚Äôt written a biography in any meaningful sense of the word; he has written a tract that instrumentalises the past for present-day political purposes. As such, his book can be safely ignored by serious students of the Nazi era\\". Books Simms's research focuses on the history of European foreign policy.

Its business model focuses on buying patents and aggregating those patents into a large patent portfolio and licensing these patents to third parties. The company has been described as the country's largest and most notorious patent trolling company, the ultimate patent troll, and the most hated company in tech. In 2009, the firm launched a prototyping and research laboratory, Intellectual Ventures Lab,\\"Bellevue lab is an inventor's real dream\\" by Brier Dudley, The Seattle Times - 27 May 2009 which attracted media controversy when the book SuperFreakonomics described its ideas for reducing global climate change.

Overview In 2000, Intellectual Ventures was founded as a private partnership by Nathan Myhrvold and Edward Jung of Microsoft, later joined by co-founders Peter Detkin of Intel, and Gregory Gorder of Perkins Coie. The Intellectual Ventures Management Company is owned 40% Nathan Myhrvold, 20% Peter Detkin, 20% Gregory Gorder and 20% Edward Jung. They reportedly have raised over $5.5 billion from many large companies including Microsoft, Intel, Sony, Nokia, Apple, Google, Yahoo, American Express, Adobe, SAP, Nvidia, and eBay, plus investment firms such as Stanford, Hewlett Foundation, Mayo Clinic, and Charles River Ventures. In December 2013, the firm released a list of approximately 33,000 of the nearly 40,000 assets in their monetization program. Issue 66. July/August 2014 Licenses to patents are obtained through investment and royalties.\\"Ubuntu: Microsoft is Patent Pal\\" by Matthew Broersma, PCWorld - 23 May 2007 In March 2009, the firm announced expansion into China, India, Japan, Korea and Singapore to build partnerships with scientists and institutions in Asia. Investment funds The company operates three primary investment funds: * Invention Investment Fund (IIF), purchasing existing inventions and licensing them * Invention Development Fund (IDF), partnering chiefly with research institutions to file descriptions of new inventions * Investment Science Fund (ISF), focused on internally developed inventions Intellectual Ventures Lab In 2009, Intellectual Ventures launched a prototyping and research laboratory, Intellectual Ventures Lab, hiring scientists to imagine inventions which could exist but do not yet exist, and then filing descriptions of these inventions with the US Patent Office. Notable participants include Robert Langer of MIT, Leroy Hood of the Institute for Systems Biology, Ed Harlow of Harvard Medical School, Bran Ferren and Danny Hillis of Applied Minds, and Sir John Pendry of Imperial College. The Sunday Times reported that the company applies for about 450 patents per year, in areas from vaccine research to optical computing and, as of May 2010, 91 of the applications had been approved. Mark Harris, The Sunday Times, May 16, 2010 Internally developed inventions include a safer nuclear reactor design (which won the MIT Technology Review Top 10 Emerging Technologies in 2009) that can use uranium waste as fuel or thorium which is plentiful and poses no proliferation risk,\\"TR10: Traveling-Wave Reactor\\" by Matt Wald, Technology Review - March/April 2009 a mosquito-targeting laser,\\"Mosquito laser gun offers new hope on malaria\\" by Tony Allen-Mills - 15 March 2009 and a series of computer models of infectious disease.\\"Mathematics, Mosquitoes, and Malaria\\" by Philip Eckhoff, Hertz Foundation Biennial Symposium - Spring 2009, Volume 11 Their efforts to promote a method to reverse or reduce the effects of global climate change by artificially recreating the conditions from the aftermath of a volcanic eruption gained media coverage following the release of the book SuperFreakonomics, whose chapter about global warming proposes that the global climate can be regulated by geo-engineering of a stratoshield based upon patented technology from the company. The chapter has been criticized by some economists and climate science experts who say it contains numerous misleading statements and discredited arguments, including this presentation of geoengineering as a replacement for CO2 emissions reduction. Among the critics are Paul Krugman, Brad DeLong, The Guardian, and The Economist. Elizabeth Kolbert, a science writer for The New Yorker who has written extensively on global warming, contends that \\"just about everything they [Levitt and Dubner] have to say on the topic is, factually speaking, wrong.\\"\\" In response, Levitt and Dubner have stated on their Freakonomics blog that global warming is man- made and an important issue. They warn against claims of an inevitable doomsday; instead they look to raise awareness of less traditional or popular, methods to tackle the potential problem of global warming. Lowell Wood, an \\"inventor in residence\\" at Intellectual Ventures, became the most-patented inventor in US history in 2015, breaking the record held by Thomas Edison for over 80 years.  Global Good  Global Good is collaboration between the firm and the Gates Foundation to develop solutions for pressing problems in the developing world. It's technologies include: Arktek, a passive vaccine storage device that allows vaccines to be transported to parts of the world that lack reliable refrigeration. It uses a small amount of ice for cooling and requires no external power supply, relying on extraordinary insulation. The device has been used to transport vaccines around the world, and Myhrvold believes the device may be useful for transporting organs. The firm produced a modified version of the Arktek to transport newly developed Ebola vaccines to Sierra Leone and Guinea during the 2014 Ebola outbreak at the required much colder temperature. The Photonic Fence is a device to identify and kill mosquitos with lasers to prevent malaria, suggested by Lowell Wood, a company researcher. The device uses a non-lethal laser to track insects and monitor their wing-beat frequency. If it detects a female mosquito, the device fires a kill laser. It has an effective range of 100 feet and can purportedly kill up to 100 mosquitoes per second. The device has not yet been mass-produced,. The Autoscope uses artificial intelligence to diagnose malaria. The device has been field-tested in Thailand and reportedly outperformed the average human diagnostician. It too is not yet scheduled for mass-production. Mazzi is a milk jug designed for farmers in the developing world. The firm partnered with Heifer International to design the jug, which is cheap, sturdy, and easy to clean with features a funnel that results in decreased spillage. Companies created Intellectual Ventures has created a number of independent companies to bring its discoveries to mass market. Examples include Kymeta, a satellite technology company, TerraPower, which seeks to improve nuclear power, Evolv, which applies metamaterials to imaging, and Echodyne, a metamaterials-based radar communications company. Controversy Publicly, Intellectual Ventures states that a major goal is to assist small inventors against corporations. In practice, the vast majority of IV's revenue comes from buying patents, aggregating these patents into a single portfolio spanning many disparate technologies and tying these patents together for license to other companies under the threat of litigation, or filing lawsuits for infringement of patents, a controversial practice referred to as \\"patent trolling.\\" Intellectual Ventures' purchased patents have largely been kept secret, though press releases with Telcordia and Transmeta indicated some or all of their patent portfolios were sold to the company. It reports that its purchasing activity as of spring 2010 has sent $350 million to individual inventors, and $848 million to small and medium size enterprises as well as returning \\"approximately $1 billion\\" to investors before filing any lawsuits, but IV's assistance to individual inventors has been contested. Investigative journalism suggests that the company makes most of its income from lawsuits and licensing of already-existing inventions, rather than from its own innovation. Intellectual Ventures has been described as a \\"patent troll\\" by Shane Robison, CTO of Hewlett Packard and others, allegedly accumulating patents not in order to develop products around them but with the goal to pressure large companies into paying licensing fees. Recent reports indicate that Verizon and Cisco made payments of $200 million to $400 million for investment and licenses to the Intellectual Ventures portfolio. On December 8, 2010, in its 10th year of operations, Intellectual Ventures filed its first lawsuit, accusing Check Point, McAfee, Symantec, Trend Micro, Elpida, Hynix, Altera, Lattice and Microsemi of patent infringement. In September 2016, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that all the relevant patent claims in the lawsuit were invalid, because \\"the patent merely applies a well- known idea using generic computers\\". The company has been accused of hiding behind shell companies for earlier lawsuits,\\"Nathan Myhrvold's Intellectual Ventures Using Over 1,000 Shell Companies To Hide Patent Shakedown\\" an accusation consistent with the findings of NPR's Planet Money in July 2011. Alex Blumberg, NPR, July 22, 2011 The episode, which also aired as the This American Life episode \\"When Patents Attack\\",When Patents Attack!. This American Life. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. was dedicated to software patents, prominently featuring Intellectual Ventures. It includes sources accusing Intellectual Ventures of pursuing a strategy encouraging mutually assured destruction, including Chris Sacca calling Myhrvold's argument that Intellectual Ventures is offering protection from lawsuits in a \\"mafia-style shakedown\\". @48:44 However, the firm's internal research, development, and commercialization activities have softened this image. Following a series of research project announcements by Intellectual Ventures, intellectual property columnist Jack Ellis wrote, \\"Although licensing is bound to remain a big part of what it does, the more agreements of the kind signed this week IV is involved in, the harder it will be to label as a troll.\\" Intellectual Ventures staff are active in lobbying and testifying in court on United States patent policy.

He first established a career in art photography and has exhibited widely around the world. Biography Faucon was born in Apt, in Provence, southern France. He attended the lyc√©e in Apt, then studied at the Sorbonne, graduating in Philosophy in 1973. Until 1977 he worked as a fine art painter, and thereafter discovered photography. His photographic work expresses a love of youth and dreamy beauty, using saturated colour, natural settings, rooms, and often tableaux of mannequins. His major photographic series are, in date- order: Les Grandes Vacances (1977‚Äì1981); Evolution probable du Temps (1981‚Äì1984); Les Chambres d'amour (1987‚Äì1989); Les Idoles et les Sacrifices (1989‚Äì1991); Les √©critures (1991‚Äì1993); and La Fin de L'image (1993‚Äì1995). Faucon has won numerous awards from his work, including the Grand Prix National (1989) and the Prix Leonard de Vinci (1991). Since 1977 he has had nearly 300 solo exhibitions, many held outside France. He developed a popular following in Japan in particular. In 1997 Faucon decided to cease his photography practice. In 1999 he published his first book of writing, La peur du voyage (The Fear of Travel). He is represented by the French agency Agence Vu. The mannequins which he had frequently used in his photographs were acquired by the Nanasai Company and are held in its corporate art collection in Kyoto, Japan. In 2002, the Moscow House of Photography in Russia held a Bernard Faucon Festival. Two years later, he was invited to officially open the Moscow Biennale. Books and films Almost all of Faucon's photography books have been published in France or Japan. The most recent and most available retrospective of his photographs is Jours d'Image, 1977-1995.

It is of the cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge type and is also a swing bridge, but somewhat unusual in its asymmetrical arrangement. It has a single mast with cables suspending a portion of the bridge which rotates 90 degrees in order to allow water traffic to pass. When it swings to allow watercraft passage, the far end comes to a resting point on a stabilizing pylon. History Designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava on a plan very similar to a 250-metre bridge over the Guadalquivir River in Seville, Spain (1992) and a 213-metre bridge over the Sacramento River in Redding, California (2004), it has a forward-, rather than a reverse-angled cantilever, as is seen in those bridges. Started in 1998, it was inaugurated on December 20, 2001, and is the first of only two Calatrava structures in Latin America. The architect has described the design as a synthesis of the image of a couple dancing the tango. The 170-metre pedestrian bridge weighs 800 tonnes, is 6.20 m wide and is divided into two fixed portions, 25 m and 32.50 m long respectively, and a middle section of 102.5 m that rotates on a white concrete pylon, allowing vessels to pass in less than two minutes. This central section is supported by a steel \\"needle\\" with a concrete core, about 34 m high. The \\"needle,\\" inclined at a 39¬∞ angle, anchors suspension cables which support the central span. A computer system at the eastern end of the bridge operates the turning mechanism when required.

The work was conceived by businessman Alberto L. Gonz√°lez, who donated money for its construction. Costing about US$6 million, the bridge was manufactured by the Urssa steel fabrication conglomerate in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz in the Basque Country of northern Spain. According to business executive Bob Schmetterer, the bridge was not part of the original Puerto Madero project. Jorge Heymann, a Buenos Aires advertising executive, had been hired to develop an advertising campaign for Puerto Madero, but his analysis showed that the biggest challenge of the site was access, not public awareness. A landmark footbridge, Heymann suggested, while certainly more costly than an initial advertising campaign would have been, would be more practical and lasting. The developer agreed with the assessment, and he built the structure.Bob Schmetterer, Leap: a revolution in creative business strategy, John Wiley and Sons, 2003, p. 148-151.

Prior to municipal amalgamation in 1995, it was an incorporated town and the shire town of Northumberland County. Situated on the north bank of the Miramichi River, the former town is sometimes referred to as Miramichi West. Being a former shire town, Newcastle is the location of several government offices and the county court house. It was an important transportation centre as it was located at the head of navigation on the Miramichi River and had wharves for the export of lumber and other forest products. During the mid-1870s the Intercolonial Railway was built through the town, placing it on the mainline between Halifax and Montreal. The town's most prosperous days are considered to be the years prior to World War I. It later reached a peak population of about 6,500. Communities amalgamated in 1995 to form the City of Miramichi, New Brunswick History Newcastle was first settled by Scottish settlers, led by William Davidson (lumberman) in the late 18th century, and was originally called Miramichi. Early settlers changed the name due to pronunciation and spelling troubles. Throughout its history, the town's economy was largely based around the forest industry. A shipbuilding industry developed in the area during the late 18th century, largely to facilitate overseas lumber exports, including masts for the British navy. The 1825 Miramichi fire, the advent of steel-hulled ships, and perhaps over-cutting of White Pine, contributed to a long-term decline in the town's economy. Pulp and paper production eventually replaced lumber exports as the mainstay of the town's economy. Newcastle remained the industrial heart of the Miramichi valley, its large pulp and paper mill employing hundreds. While many of the early settlers were employed in the forest industry, others participated in the salmon fishery. As transportation improved and the commercial fishery waned, a valuable sports fishery developed, attracting \\"sports\\" initially from adjacent New England, and subsequently from all parts of the world. The 1952 discovery of base metal deposits and the development of Heath Steele Mines, 60 km northwest of Newcastle, allowed the economy to diversify and strengthen through the 1960s. The mine closed in 1999 as metal prices declined and the ore bodies were depleted. Notable people The famous British newspaper owner and Minister of Aircraft Production during World War II, Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook), moved to Newcastle at an early age and considered it home. A noted philanthropist, Lord Beaverbrook, contributed much to his home town and province. He established the Old Manse Library in his boyhood residence, built the town hall, and established a park (the historic Town Square) for the community. The picturesque park includes the town's war cenotaph, a stone fountain (with water supplied by an artesian well), an Italian stone gazebo and other monuments of local historic importance such as shipbuilding and folk music. The park was once well known for its graceful and elegant stand of elm trees, since stricken by the deadly Dutch elm disease. A bust of Beaverbrook, containing his ashes, stands in the square. Newcastle is also the hometown of David Adams Richards, one of Canada's pre-eminent authors. He has been recognised via many awards, including two Governor General's Awards.

History = Founding  Machliniec was founded in 1823 by German-speaking settlers from the southern Egerland region of Bohemia, notably the parishes of Plan and Pfraumberg. The original settlers were attracted by a publicly distributed notice from the Lord of the Manor of Daszawa, Felix, Count of Dobrzanski, \\"He will reasonably sell a quantity of his best land to people who want to settle on his manor.\\" The settlers cleared the land and established their own farms on it.  Austrian era, 1823‚Äì1918  Machliniec was the principal village in what is known as the German language island of Machliniec. The language island comprised the following seven villages, followed by their respective populations in 1934: * Machliniec 431 * Neudorf (Nowesiola) 473 * Kornel√≥wka 235 * Dr√∂sseldorf (Wola Oblaznica) 203 * Kontrowers 170 * Lubsza 145 * Izydor√≥wka 102 There were four other Bohemian- German language islands, or colonies, in eastern Galizien‚ÄîFelizienthal, Ludwik√≥wka, P√∂chersdorf and Mariahilf. In January 1837, the inhabitants of Machliniec petitioned for the construction of their own church. Dobrzanski provided only the clay for the foundation; the parishioners had to contribute the rest of the building material in addition to all the labour. The small wooden church, dedicated to the Most Holy Trinity, could hold 80 people and was completed in 1842. On 19 August 1862 a new larger stone church was completed. Each landowner donated on average twenty-five Guilders in cash, thirty-seven cart-loads of material and six full days of labour towards construction. Machliniec found itself in the middle of the eastern front during the First World War. The village was occupied by Russian troops in 1914 and many families fled south across the Carpathian Mountains toward Austria. The Austrians regained the territory in the summer of 1915, only to be pushed back again by Russian forces in their offensive of 1916‚Äîthe colony of Mariahilf was completely burned down at this time.  Polish era, 1918-1939  Following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of 1918, the area around Machliniec suffered from further conflicts first in the Polish-Ukrainian War of 1918-1919, and then in the Polish-Soviet War of 1919-1921. Many people emigrated to North and South America at this time. Under Polish rule, the people of Machliniec lost many of the freedoms they had enjoyed when they were part of Austria. Instruction in the German language was no longer permitted in public schools and lessons were conducted by independent teachers who moved from town to town, often under the watchful eye of the local authorities. An organisation known as the Association of German Catholics (V.d. K) was established in 1923 to promote cultural and social links between the isolated German settlements. When the Second World War broke out in September 1939, the Polish authorities jailed sixteen members of the V.d. K. from the Machliniec area. They were released a month later when Poland surrendered.  Population transfers  As per Article II of the secret protocol of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, all land to the east of the Narev, Vistula, and San rivers was to fall into the Soviet sphere of influence. As part of the Nazi-Soviet population transfers, all Volksdeutsche were to be granted German citizenship and resettled in Germany. In November 1939, Soviet and German officials arrived and prepared detailed lists of property and livestock which each family would have to leave behind. Each person was allowed to take a wagon with a limited amount of personal belongings and one team of horses. : \\"The women and children went by train in boxcars, in December 1939. The men, with their teams of horses, went in January 1940 first to Przemy≈õl (in present-day Poland) to cross the bridge over the San River towards Germany. It took us two days in that very cold winter to arrive at the bridge. Crossing the bridge was very strictly controlled by the Russians. After we crossed over the bridge, we were loaded on a train with the team of horses and travelled west towards Posen, Poland.\\" : ‚Äî Leo Merz 1988. Many children and older people died from the bitter cold, or from typhus and other diseases that were prevalent in the cramped conditions of the resettlement camps. The inhabitants of Machliniec were resettled throughout the Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany on farms that had been taken from Polish or Jewish families. Most of the men were conscripted into the German army and sent to the Eastern Front. In 1945, ahead of the advancing Red Army, the women and children were evacuated yet again.  1940 to the present  Since 1940, Machliniec has been inhabited solely by ethnic Ukrainians. In 1990, descendants of the original settlers realized that the stone church was badly damaged and that the roof had caved in. Inside the church is a small metal plaque with the following words engraved in Ukrainian and German: :\\"The church was established in 1862 by German settlers, who had to leave their homeland in 1940, and who now live scattered throughout the world. In the subsequent decades the church has become dilapidated. The descendants of the German settlers have financed its reconstruction with their donations.\\" :: 16.10.1994  External links  *Language Islands and the Development of Folklore *Memories of Leo Merz, born in Machliniec in 1912 Villages in Lviv Oblast ","title":"Makhlynets"},{"id":"1352868","text":"Trojan Records is a British record label founded in 1968. It specialises in ska, rocksteady, reggae and dub music. The label currently operates under the Sanctuary Records Group. The name Trojan comes from the Croydon-built Trojan truck that was used as Duke Reid's sound system in Jamaica. The truck had \\"Duke Reid - The Trojan King of Sounds\\" painted on the sides, and the music played by Reid became known as the Trojan Sound. History Trojan Records was founded in 1968 when Lee Gopthal, who operated the Musicland record retail chain and owned Beat & Commercial Records, pooled his Jamaican music interests with those of Chris Blackwell‚Äôs Island Records. Trojan was instrumental in introducing reggae to a global audience and by 1970 had secured a series of major UK chart hits. Successful Trojan artists from this period including Tony Tribe, Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's Upsetters, Bob and Marcia, Desmond Dekker, Jimmy Cliff, Harry J All Stars, The Maytals, The Melodians, Nicky Thomas and Dave and Ansel Collins. The bulk of the company‚Äôs successes came via licences for Jamaican music supplied by producers such as Duke Reid, Harry Johnson and Leslie Kong. While the company‚Äôs focus was firmly on the sale of 7‚Äù singles, it also launched a series of popular, budget-priced compilations such as Tighten Up, Club Reggae and Reggae Chartbusters. In 1972, Chris Blackwell decided to withdraw Island Records interests in Trojan. By this time, the company was trying to broaden the appeal of reggae by re-mastering and overdubbing string arrangements on the original recordings. While the move initially paid dividends, the costs involved began to take their toll on the company's finances. In 1975, the company was liquidated and its assets acquired by Marcel Rodd's Saga Records, which had previously largely focused on releasing budget LPs. In 1985, record collector and accountant Colin Newman purchased Trojan Records. Over the years that ensued, the company mainly concentrated on re-releasing much of its back catalogue, issuing numerous ska, rock steady and reggae recordings. Among their most popular releases were the Trojan Box Set series, each featuring 50 songs on a three-CD (or vinyl record) set in a \\"clamshell\\" box. In addition, Trojan licensed reggae classics for a number of TV commercial campaigns, most notably for TDK, Adidas and the 2000 UEFA European Football Championship. The Sanctuary Records Group purchased Trojan Records in 2001 and continued to focus on the label's back catalogue. In 2002, Trojan's new owners acquired former UK rival record company, Creole Records, previously owned by Bruce White and Gary Himmelfarb's US-based RAS Records. In August 2007, Universal Music Group (UMG) had acquired 90% of Sanctuary Records after announcing in June a share offer that valued Sanctuary at $US87.68 million.UMG Seals Sanctuary Buyout Deal - Billboard Website - Article by Lars Brandle (2 August 2007).

Retrieved 5 May 2013. In 2018, the company celebrated 50 years in the business. Influence on skinheads Trojan skinheads, influenced by traditional 1960s skinhead culture, are named after Trojan Records, to stress the influence of black Jamaican music and the rude boy style to the skinhead subculture. This designation emphasizes differences from the punk rock-influenced Oi! skinheads of the 1980s. The logo of Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP) is based on the Trojan Records logo, although the Corinthian helmet is reversed to face the opposite direction.

In 2010 he was elected a fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. He described himself as a naturalist, an atheist, a materialist, a metaphysical libertarian, and a positivist. His published books include Becoming a Critical Thinker; The Skeptic's Dictionary; The Skeptic's Dictionary for Kids; The Critical Thinker's Dictionary; Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!; The Commonsense Philosophy of Religion of Edward Stillingfleet; Student Success Guide: Writing Skills and Student Success Guide: Reading Skills. He was a professor of philosophy at Sacramento City College from 1977 until his retirement in 2007.  Life  Carroll was born in Joliet, Illinois, on May 18, 1945. His father worked in a coal processing plant. In 1954 the family moved to San Diego, where Carroll grew up. He described his early years in Ocean Beach as an ideal childhood. He was raised Catholic. Carroll went to the University of San Diego High School and then received a Catholic education in the University of Notre Dame. He went into seminary in Notre Dame, but after a short time he left, in 1965, and went back to San Diego. Carroll earned his Ph.D. in philosophy in 1974 at the University of California, San Diego, writing his doctoral thesis under the direction of Richard H. Popkin on the religious philosophy of Edward Stillingfleet, who had defended the Anglican church passionately against Catholics, deists and atheists before becoming Bishop of Worcester. Carroll's thesis was published in 1975. By then Carroll was married, with two daughters. The new family moved to Susanville, California, where he started teaching philosophy at Lassen Community College. He later moved to the Sacramento area and from 1977 lived in Davis. Carroll said he never went through a religious deconversion moment but instead had a long journey to disbelief. He first started doubting Catholicism, he said, when he went into seminary in Notre Dame. After leaving the seminary he became intrigued by eastern religions and, inspired by Alan Watts, started looking at their holy books. Carroll became interested in Paramahansa Yogananda and attended meetings of his Self-Realization Fellowship to do yoga and chanting. At the time, he identified as agnostic. After leaving the Fellowship, he said, he spent years thinking about his religion. He later said, \\"The more I thought about religious ideas, the more false and absurd they seem to me.\\" Carroll took up Kierkegaard's idea that religious beliefs require a leap of faith because they cannot be rationally proven. But Carroll decided to leap in the other direction. He said he \\"found many reasons for disbelief and absolutely no reasons for belief.\\" In May 2014, Carroll was diagnosed with stage IV pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer and liver metastasis. In May 2016 he announced he would no longer be able to write the Skeptic's Dictionary monthly newsletter on account of his illness. On August 25, 2016, Carroll died in a local hospital in Davis, California. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters and two grandchildren.  Career = Professor  Carroll started teaching philosophy part time at Lassen Community College. Then he taught philosophy of religion at American River College for two years. Thereafter he taught full time at Sacramento City College, where from 1977 through 2007 he taught introductory philosophy; logic and critical reasoning; law, justice, and punishment; and critical thinking about the paranormal. For several years he served as chairman of the philosophy department.  Writer  Drawing on his classwork, Carroll wrote Becoming a Critical Thinker: A Guide for a New Millennium, an introductory textbook for logic and critical thinking. Pearson Educational published the first edition in 2000. A second edition was published in 2005. In 2003 John Wiley & Son published a paperback edition of The Skeptic's Dictionary, derived from Carroll's website of the same name. The book provides essays on subjects Carroll considered supernatural, occult, paranormal, or pseudoscientific. He assumed that something is false until proven otherwise. In the last chapter, Carroll offered ways to improve critical thinking and skepticism. The book is also available in Dutch, English, Japanese, Korean, and Russian. In 2011 Carroll published online a children's version of The Skeptic's Dictionary. In 2013, it came out as a book under the title Mysteries and Science: Exploring Aliens, Ghosts, Monsters, the End of the World and Other Weird Things. Carroll also wrote Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!, which was published as an e-book in 2011 by the James Randi Educational Foundation. A paperback version is available from Lulu. In 2013 Carroll also published The Critical Thinker's Dictionary, which features short articles about cognitive biases and logical fallacies.  Skeptic  Carroll said he had been investigating controversial beliefs since he was seven years old when he had doubts about Santa Claus. Carroll described the importance of critical thinking and open-mindedness thus: \\"If you are willing to be open minded, accept that reasonable probabilities rather than absolute certainties are the best information in many things that matter, and hold your most precious beliefs tentatively, then you can overcome some of the hindrances to critical thinking at least some of the time. And also that one's world view can be a major hindrance to being fair-minded. The minimum requirement of fair- mindedness is a willingness to take seriously viewpoints opposed to your own. In other words, you have to be willing to admit that you are wrong. Or that you might be wrong.\\" Carroll started writing skeptical content in 1992, when both his best friend and his father-in-law died within the same week. He later said, \\"It was like the deaths of these two people had forced me to start looking at everything and not take anything for granted.\\" After Carroll and his wife attended free training in 1994 in which they learned about the Internet and HTML code, Carroll started the Skeptic's Dictionary website (skepdic.com) with ten articles written for his students and expanded it from there. Although the website was a one-man project, volunteers later assisted in editing it and translated it into more than a dozen languages. The Skeptic's Dictionary, Carroll said, was inspired by Pierre Bayle's Historical and Critical Dictionary in both its name and its biased stance. Carroll created skeptical blogs such as Mass Media Bunk and Mass Media Funk (they were replaced by Skeptimedia in 2007). In addition to skepdic.com, he also maintained blogs at Skeptimedia and Suburban Myths. On March 27, 2012, Carroll began a regular segment on the podcast Skepticality entitled Unnatural Virtue in which he commented on topics in critical thinking and skepticism. The segment ran for thirty-one episodes, until April 29, 2014. Carroll spoke at several skeptic conferences. In 2003 he spoke at the first Amaz!ng Meeting and at a conference of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal on frauds and hoaxes. In 2004 he spoke to the Irish Skeptics in Dublin. In 2007 he conducted a critical-thinking workshop at the 5th Amazing Meeting. In 2011 he led a discussion on \\"Five Myths About Skeptics\\" at the second annual SkeptiCalCon event, held in Berkeley, CA. He was also interviewed by groups promoting scientific skepticism, such as the New England Skeptical SocietyPerry DeAngelis, \\"Interview with Robert Todd Carroll\\", New England Skeptical Society Journal. and Media Man Australia. In January 2010 he was elected a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry. In an interview with Point of Inquiry's Karen Stollznow, Carroll said he did not earn much money from his skeptical work: \\"If we talk about the money we make from skepticism we might set a record for the shortest interview ever.\\" But everybody should be a skeptic, he said, because it is a healthy way of approaching life. He said that skeptics' meetups and conferences, as well as the positive feedback he received on his work, were his main motivations.  Criticism = Jon Barron After Carroll wrote a Skepdic.com entry about Jon Barron, criticizing his \\"Barron Effect,\\" Barron replied with a piece on his website titled \\"Rebutting a Skeptic\\" in which he replied to Carroll's Skepdic.com entries concerning alternative medicine such as \\"Cellular energy's relation to cancer,\\" \\"Mercury, thimerosal, vaccines, and chelation,\\" \\"The need for supplements,\\" and \\"Fecal matter in the colon.\\" He accused Carroll of deliberately misinterpreting evidence and took issue with a distorted personal picture Carroll had posted on skepdic.com.  Richard Milton  After Carroll published a piece online labelling Richard Milton's writings on alternative science \\"Internet Bunk,\\" Milton responded by accusing Carroll of being a \\"pseudo-skeptic\\" and said that Carroll had fabricated quotations and misrepresented his arguments. Carroll replied to these accusations in an addendum to his piece.  Rupert Sheldrake  Carroll wrote two Skeptic's Dictionary entries that criticize Rupert Sheldrake's ideas. The first criticized Sheldrake's N'kisi Project, a set of experiments meant to test the possibility of a telepathic link between N'kisi (a grey parrot) and its owner, Aimee Morgana. Carroll charged that when calculating the statistical significance of the parrot's responses, Sheldrake had omitted 60% of the data. Carroll also criticized Jane Goodall for her involvement in the Project. The second entry challenged Sheldrake's morphic resonance idea, in which Sheldrake proposed that, in addition to genetic influences, a \\"morphogenetic field\\" for each species evolves similarly to how the species' genes might evolve, that these fields organize the nervous system's activity and can act as a collective memory for the whole species, and that these fields get passed down into the species. Sheldrake replied to Carroll's criticism by defending his own arguments and accusing Carroll of committing several logical fallacies, including using false dilemmas and misrepresenting Sheldrake's position. He also criticized The Skeptic's Dictionary, claiming that it would not survive had it been subject to independent peer reviews.  Views on religion  Carroll did not believe in an omnipotent, omniscient, omnipresent God. However, in his essay \\"Why I am not an atheist,\\" Carroll said he disliked the term \\"atheist\\" because he felt it was being exploited by theists and used in straw-man arguments. He preferred the term \\"Brights.\\" After Carroll abandoned Catholicism, he said, the only religion he found attractive (though he never followed it) was Buddhism as taught by the Dalai Lama. Carroll always maintained that people have to be more skeptical of religion. Religion, he said, is an area skeptics do not target enough, and so, he said, pure faith was winning the race against critical thinking. Carroll said he believed that religion has a role to play in people's lives and he did not condemn religion for terrorism. He did not believe religion causes wars, he said, but believed that it serves as an excuse for people who will go to war regardless of religion's existence. He said that he could not recall anything negative about his religious upbringing and that maybe Catholicism can provide more good than harm. However, he found it distressing that some people are unable to find meaning in their lives without religion. In an interview with Beyond a Doubt he said, \\"There is nothing dull about a life without fairies, Easter bunnies, devils, ghosts, magic crystals, etc. Life is only boring to boring people.\\"  Publications  * Becoming a Critical Thinker ‚Äì A Guide for the New Millennium, 2nd ed., . * \\"Unnatural Acts: Critical Thinking, Skepticism, and Science Exposed!\\", Los Angeles: James Randi Educational Foundation, 2011, . * the Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions, New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2003, . * The Common- sense Philosophy of Religion of Bishop Edward Stillingfleet 1635‚Äì1699, .

The distillery is owned by Glasgow founded and based Whyte and Mackay, which in turn is owned by Philippines-based Emperador Inc. History  The distillery was founded by the Laird of Jura, Archibald Campbell in 1810. The distillery fell into disrepair but was restored in 1884. Around 1900 it was again in disuse and dismantled. In the 1950s two local estate owners Robin Fletcher and Tony Riley-Smith keen to revive the local economy had the distillery rebuilt and expanded by the architects Lothian, Barclay, Jarvis & Boys with input from whisky and distillery expert William Delm√©-Evans. The work was completed in 1963, and included the installation of taller stills, allowing the distillery to create a mix of malts.

In the early 1700s, the Campbells of Jura evicted a man who prophesied that the last Campbell to leave the island would be one-eyed with his belongings carried in a cart drawn by a lone white horse. In 1938 Charles Campbell, blind in one eye from a war injury, fell on hard times and led his white horse to the old pier for the last time. The location Jura Two-One-Two whisky was named after the 212 inhabitants of the island of Jura. The island of Jura is seven miles (11 km) wide and thirty miles (48 km) long and it has only one road, one pub and one distillery. There are seven estates on Jura: Ardfin, Inver, Jura Forest, Ruantallain, Tarbert, Ardlussa, and Barnhill. Less than 200 people live on the island (while it has a red deer population of around 5000). The inhabitants of Jura are known as Diurachs, which is their Gaelic name. \\"Extremely unget-at-able\\" was how George Orwell described the location of the Isle of Jura in 1946, and it was here in 1948 he completed his novel Nineteen- Eighty-four: the island remains difficult to reach today. Most travellers to Jura go by CalMac car ferry from Kennacraig on the Kintyre Peninsula to Islay, and then cross to Jura from Port Askaig on Islay by the MV Eilean Dhiura, a small vehicle ferry which is run by ASP Ships on behalf of Argyll and Bute Council. Islay can also be reached by air: Islay Airport is served by daily flights from Glasgow. From March to October there is also a passenger ferry from Tayvallich on the west coast of Scotland. Brand ambassadors Whisky Rover is one of two brand ambassadors. He began working at the distillery in 1975, and worked as a tunroom man, mash, stillman under manager, distillery manager and master distiller, before taking the role of brand ambassador. In 2011 he was awarded a lifetime Achievement Award from Malt Advocate magazine.MaltAdvocate.com. Retrieved 2011-03-07. Willie Cochrane, the other brand ambassador, started at the Jura distillery as a mash & still operator in 1976. Soon after, he was promoted to the dual roles of brewer and engineer. After thirty years, he became the distillery manager.

Chris Lea is a designer, politician and political activist in Canada. He was the leader of the Green Party of Canada from 1990 to 1996. Lea is notable for being the first openly gay political party leader in Canadian history. Biography Lea is a graduate student in theory and policy studies at the Ontario Institute for Studies in Education. He was formerly a professional architect. During the 1980s, he volunteered for The Body Politic, a periodical focusing on gay issues, sitting briefly on its editorial collective, and serving on the committee that set up Xtra!, Canada's most successful gay newspaper. Lea worked on the committee that organized the Summit Citizen's Conference, the counter-summit to the G-7 meetings taking place in Toronto in 1988. With Frank de Jong, Lea organized a successful viral campaign against McDonald's use of disposable styrofoam clamshell packing containers and as well a series of protests which stalled the expansion of nuclear power in Ontario in the early 1990s by bringing light on the massive debt that the province's nuclear programme had created. Lea, who hails from a family of entertainers that includes the 1950s Canadian TV icon Shirley Harmer, began a side career as an opera performer in 2002, and in February 2005 undertook his first on-stage solo in a performance of Gioacchino Rossini's The Barber of Seville. He was the director of facilities at Hart House at the University of Toronto, where as part of a team he won a Green Innovation Award in 2010, for a project to utilise electrical power generated from exercise bikes.Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, University of Toronto News, May 11, 2010, Retrieved 2013-05-21. For many years he was vice- President of the Toronto Opera Repertoire, and is now President of Toronto City Opera. Lea lives in Toronto. Green Party leadership Lea was the leader of the Green Party of Canada from 1990 to 1996. The Green Party of Canada's internal organization was very decentralized in the early 1990s, and its leadership position was seen as a nominal title. In his time as leader though, Lea worked to create a more usual party structure. Lea started Green Canada, the party's internal members' newspaper (which later became Green Canada Vert before it was absorbed into the Green Party of Canada web pages). Lea initiated the practice of having regular teleconference meetings of the party's council. Aided by de Jong and Steve Kisby, Lea was the first to compile a comprehensive Green Party policy document for electronic distribution. Lea was the first Green Party of Canada leader to do a national tour (from Halifax to Clayoquot Sound, by bike, rail and air, during the 1993 federal election) and was the first to represent the party in a nationally televised debate. Lea created TV commercials and print advertising for elections and the 1992 Meech Lake Accord referendum. He advocated for a unified corporate identity for the party, and designed the first Green Party logo to be used nationally. As leader, Lea made presentations to royal commissions on electoral reform and on financing the CBC, sometimes in French. As well Lea helped to organize party conferences and took part in legal challenges against the broadcast consortium that regulates the televised debates during the election period. In 1994, to settle an impasse between the U.S. Committees of Correspondence (the national green party) and the California Green Party over representation to the 1995 World Green Coordination meeting in Mexico City, Lea organized an international election covering Canada, the U.S and the Caribbean, electing Ontario's Ella Haley and New Jersey's Anila Walkin. As party leader, Lea campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada in the 1993 federal election, and received 623 votes in the Toronto riding of Trinity--Spadina for a sixth-place finish. He also campaigned for the Ontario legislature in the 1995 provincial election as a candidate of the Green Party of Ontario, and received 241 votes in the Toronto riding of St. George--St. David. He has not sought federal or provincial office since this time, though he remains active within the Green Party. In 1998, he volunteered to be the party's chief agent to relieve Steve Kisby from these duties. Lea has long been an ally of Jim Harris in the Toronto Green community, and supported Harris's bid for re-election as party leader in 2004.

Big Dumb Face was formed by brothers Wes and Scott Borland in 1998, serving for the former as a side project of the American band Limp Bizkit. Big Dumb Face released its debut album, Duke Lion Fights the Terror!! in 2001, followed by a second album, Where Is Duke Lion? He's Dead... in 2017. History=Formation and Duke Lion Fights the Terror!! (1998-2004) In 1998, Wes and Scott Borland formed Big Dumb Face, serving for Wes Borland as a side project of Limp Bizkit. In 2001, Big Dumb Face released its debut album, Duke Lion Fights the Terror!!, through Flip/Interscope and Flawless Records, a vanity label formed as a Geffen subsidiary by Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst, who is credited as an executive producer on the album. Reviews were mixed. Allmusic writer Kieran McCarthy dismissed Duke Lion Fights the Terror as \\"a mediocre Ween rip-off\\" while Entertainment Weekly writer Robert Cherry wrote, \\"Dumb? Check. Big? Not likely.\\" However, a positive review appeared in the Deseret News in which writer Scott Iwasaki, giving the album three stars, stated, \\"Duke Lion Fights the Terror!! captures Borland, as Big Dumb Face, at his most spontaneous\\". Bloody Good Horror writer D.M, in a mixed to favorable review, wrote, \\"The album‚Äôs concept is so scattershot that it‚Äôs unfathomable to call the album a cohesive whole.\\" After the release of the band's debut album, Wes Borland began developing a video game sequel to the album, which fell through. Big Dumb Face was sporadically active until 2004. Where Is Duke Lion? He's Dead... (2017-present) Big Dumb Face was inactive for 13 years while Wes Borland was active with other projects, most notably Black Light Burns, rejoining Limp Bizkit, and becoming the touring guitarist for Queen Kwong. In June 2017, Borland hinted on Instagram that he would revive Big Dumb Face. On October 13, a new Big Dumb Face song, \\"He Rides The Skies\\", was released. The band's second album, Where Is Duke Lion? He's Dead... was released on October 31 through Borland's own label Edison Sound. The album consists of newly written songs alongside one song written in 2001 and another written in 2003. Borland described it as \\"the most metal record I‚Äôve ever made\\". In March 2018, he revealed that he was working on a Christmas album for release on Black Friday 2018.  Style and influences  Wes Borland cited the music of Ween and Mr. Bungle as an influence on Big Dumb Face's music. Wes Borland stated that the band's music is \\"really silly and idiotic and bizarre. [...] It's nothing but stupid [...] just all these retarded songs.\\" Metal Hammer referred to the band's music as \\"death country\\". NME describes the band's music as encompassing \\"death metal, electronic noise, steel pan samples and grindcore\\". Allmusic describes the band's music as ranging from \\"Dr. Demento-esque variety-show pop to alternative country √† la Ween.\\" Blabbermouth described the band's song \\"Whipping the Hodeus\\" as combining \\"grotesque southern country, [...] cinematic rural soundscape, disco funk, and finally, grind/deathcore.\\" Bloody Good Horror described the band's music as comedy metal, and New Noise magazine described the band's music as \\"joke metal\\", stating, \\"one minute it‚Äôs grindcore and the next it‚Äôs reggae.

The historic depot and surrounding buildings house a retail and entertainment center. The complex also contains a stop for SunRail, the commuter rail service of the Greater Orlando area. The station building was constructed in 1889 by South Florida Railroad. It served several different railroads until 1926, when passenger services transferred to what is now the Orlando Health/Amtrak station. In the 1970s, the station and nearby buildings were bought and developed into an entertainment center. After its original owner sold the development in 1989, Church Street Station experienced a period of decline. In 2013, St. Petersburg businessman Mark Ferguson signed a 20-year lease with an option to purchase. Ferguson opened a sports bar/restaurant in 2017. It closed and was sold in 2018. The property has been divided into sections. Lincoln Property bought the majority of the property. The southbound station is planned to be moved to a new high rise nearby. Station=Atlantic Coast Line Railroad The Depot, as it appeared circa 1910. The station was originally built by the South Florida Railroad in 1889 (although some sources say it was built in 1890) to serve Orlando. The South Florida Railroad was bought out by the Plant System in 1893, which in turn was taken over by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1902. The station also served the Tavares, Orlando and Atlantic Railroad and the Orlando and Winter Park Railway. In 1926 passenger operations were transferred to a new station built by the Coast Line. The Church Street depot still survives to this day on the National Register of Historic Places. SunRail The SunRail commuter rail project uses the historic Church Street Rail Depot as one of three stops in downtown Orlando. A new platform on the same side of the tracks was built down the block from the Church Street Station, within walking distance of Orlando City Hall. Church Street Station is typical of most SunRail stations featuring canopies consisting of white aluminum poles supporting sloped green roofs and includes ticket vending machines, ticket validators, emergency call boxes, drinking fountains, and separate platforms designed for passengers in wheelchairs. The station is located along the former CSX A-Line (originally constructed by the South Florida Railroad) and is one of two located in the central business district, providing easy access to the new Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and hotel development within the same block; Camping World Stadium, which recently underwent a complete renovation; Orlando City Stadium, home of the Orlando City Lions MLS soccer club; and the Amway Center and proposed entertainment complex, home of the Orlando Magic NBA team Night club complex Entrepreneur Bob Snow opened Rosie O'Grady's Good Time Emporium on July 19, 1974. Based on the Rosie O'Grady's/Seville Quarter complex he opened in Pensacola, Florida in the late 1960s, Rosie O'Grady's Good Time Emporium/Church Street Station in Orlando saw great popular success in the 1970s and 1980s, It operated as an attraction offering admission to multiple nightclubs of various formats facilitating \\"club hopping\\" for a single price in a monolithic location. The 1970s and 1980s Started in the 1904 Hotel Orlando building it grew to span both sides of Church Street and both sides of the railroad tracks and include the Old Orlando Railroad Depot. At one time it was the fourth largest attraction in Florida. Ken Ibold in 2002 wrote in Florida Trend that Church Street Station, \\"once hosted more annual visitors than anywhere else in Florida\\". It was a joint venture with John Hankins and was sold by Snow in 1989. Walt Disney World emulated the successful formula, opening its own Pleasure Island club district amidst Church Street Station's peak years of success, as did Universal Studios Orlando with its \\"City Walk\\" complex. Snow proceeded to develop a similar venue in Las Vegas, \\"Main Street Station\\" that at inception shared many club concepts with the Orlando facility. One of the popular attractions was the Cheyenne Saloon and Opera House. Fashioned after a western saloon the three story bar, restaurant and entertainment venue was a filming location for the Nashville Network every Friday for seven years in the 1980s. Country music artists including Garth Brooks and Alan Jackson appeared there before they became famous. Snow was among the investors in the Church Street Station in 2007 when he planned to reopen the Cheyenne Saloon. After reopening in 2008 Snow was unable to come to an agreement with the new owners of the property and it closed again in 2009. Rosie O'Grady's Flying Circus offered balloon rides providing views of downtown Orlando and the nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. Joseph Kittinger was vice president of air operations. Balloon rides were still available in 1994 for . Decline As an entertainment, drinking and dining complex, Church Street Station eventually experienced a steep decline in attendance and had largely closed as a club-hop by the end of the 1990s. The demise of the attraction as a leading nightlife complex has been directly attributed to Walt Disney World's opening of a competing complex featuring multiple clubs with a single entry fee. The addition of a large retail complex in 1985 failed to reinvigorate the location. =Baltimore Gas and Electric= Besides competition in the entertainment and retail business, owner Baltimore Gas and Electric (BGE) increased overhead for retailers as much as 55% while not providing support and promotion. BGE invested 25% of the cost of building the retail complex in 1985 and purchased the Church Street Station property in 1989 but was not willing to make the needed investments to keep the property competitive and viable. BGE wrote off $12M to reflect the decline in the value of the property in March 1997. In 1991 the complex had 50 shops and specialty stores. A event venue, the Presidential Ballroom was built in 1994. That year in addition to the ballroom/banquet facility, the Church Street Station complex consisted of three restaurants, five showrooms, private parlor rooms, a wine cellar, a shopping complex, the train depot with convenience store, shops and corporate office space. The Church Street Station had 800 employees in 1994. With foreclosures and serial disappointments duplicating the successes of the past, the property has struggled. BGE revised the decline in value to $18.5M in October 1997 and wrote off an additional loss in value of $15.4M in 1998. Several attempts have been made by multiple owners to re-create the success of the 1970s and mid-1980s. One included a planned, in 2004, Paris Hilton branded nightclub. Church Street station was the fifth largest entertainment complex in Orlando in 1998, attracting 550,000 thousand visitors. That year revenue was $20.8M but it had an operating loss of about $1M. Enic PLC of London bought the property for $11.5 million in 1999 and reportedly lost $2M a year for two years before selling it for $15.9M in 2001. =F.F. South & Co.= A local real estate partnership F.F. South & Co, bought the Church Street Station in 2001 and promptly closed two of the oldest remaining attractions, Rosie O' Grady's Good Time Emporium and the haunted house, The Terror on Church Street. The property bought by F.F. South & Co was including of building improvements and vacant land. That year long time tenant Buffalo Trading Co closed its store after almost 20 years. In December the catering business which operated in the Presidential Ballroom venue that had been added in 1994 was closed by F.F. South & Co., at that time only a single, just opened, restaurant was operating in the complex. The ballroom had been popular since opening and the company walked away from as much as $1M of business when closed with no advance notice. Church Street Station had been listed as the sixth largest meeting facility if central Florida in July 2001. =Haunted?= Local restaurateurs who had signed a $14,175 a month lease for the building which housed Lili Marlene's Aviator's Pub and Restaurant in the 1980s backed out claiming the building was haunted in 2005. A letter from their lawyer alleged construction workers had seen ghosts and the owner's had failed to inform them. The letter cited their Jehovah's Witness faith. The landlord offered to have an exorcism performed and sued stating there were no ghosts in, on, above, below or around the property. A ghost tour operator asserted the building was haunted by the ghosts of slain illegitimate children of prostitutes who worked in the Strand Hotel upstairs which had been a de facto brothel. =Lou Pearlman= President of F.F. South & Co Robert Kling became involved with Lou Pearlman, who came to own the property. Pearlman's legal troubles led to a foreclosure lawsuit. Pearlman's corporate offices for Trans Continental Airlines Inc. in the Church Street Station were seized in February 2007 and its assets went into receivership. Bank of America sought to foreclose on the station property. Pearlman had been running an investment scam alleging access to investment in the employee retirement plan of Trans Continental Airlines, while transferring the money to his other businesses and using it for loan payments. When Pearlman was involved the owner of the property was identified as FF Station LLC, the company filed for bankruptcy protection in February 2007. Also in February 2007 Pearlman's Church Street offices were raided by agents from the FBI, IRS, FDIC and Florida Office of Financial Regulation. Miscellaneous belongings left behind by Pearlman were auctioned off at the Church Street Station on June 12, 2007. When he purchased the property in 2003 Pearlman received a $1.5M economic development loan from the city. City Commissioner Daisy Lynum gave him a key to the city in 2004 and even as his fraud was revealed felt he still deserved it stating, \\"It was Lou Pearlman who jump started all the downtown development\\". A 2007 article in the St. Petersburg Times stated he was, \\"unable to revive the night life that once made the Church Street complex a major attraction\\". The only bidder Cameron Kuhn purchased the site for the minimum bid of $34M at a bankruptcy auction about what was owed to creditors of FF Station. The 21st CenturyBob Snow returns= In 2007 a group of investors including founder Bob Snow, developer Cameron Kuhn and Ceviche tapas bar owner Gordon Davis planned a revitalization of the property. The Cheyenne Saloon & Opera House reopened in 2008 under Snow's direction at the time Kuhn retained ownership of much of the property. By 2009 a new high rise condominium, 55 West, had been built at the Church Street Station, when another foreclosure was started. =Trains go and come= In creating the attraction Snow had brought a historic locomotive and train cars to the station. The locomotive Frisco 0‚Äì6‚Äì0 No. 3749, built in 1913 by Baldwin, worked as switcher in Pensacola, the southernmost extension of the St. Louis‚ÄìSan Francisco Railway. The rail cars included a Union Pacific Dome, a Seaboard Air Line Diner and a 10 section Monta Rosa Pullman lounge observation car. In 2012 these were moved to the Florida Railroad Museum in Parrish, Florida to make room for construction of the SunRail platform. Another rail car was donated to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Museum by original partner John Hankins. SunRail revived the station in 2014 as a commuter rail stop. =MoJo and Ferg's come and go= The former Rosie O‚Äô Grady's Good Time Emporium restaurant and entertainment venue was sold in June 2010 for $2.2M to downtown commercial property owners Frank Hamby and Margaret Casscells. The new owners planned to transform the building into the New Orleans-style MoJo Bar & Grill. In 2013 Mark Ferguson bought the property and opened (in 2017) a dining and entertainment venue and bar, Ferg's Depot, as a second location of his popular St. Petersburg sports bar the venue was with air-conditioned. Four years in the making it consisted of three buildings, the old waiting room for the train station was a 100-person dining room, the St. Petersburg sports bar was emulated in a section called Ferg's Tap House, the third section was an indoor/outdoor oyster bar. The restaurant became a nightclub after 10:30 at night, restrooms were in shipping containers that looked like trains and a Tiki bar was open to the street. Ferguson began renovations with an ad campaign, \\"We've been working on the railroad\\", saying, \\"It's something we're going to build and have for a long time\\". It was listed for sale in 2017 for $4.7M. This venture closed on August 4, 2018. =Recent developments= Passenger rail service returned in 2014 when SunRail revamped the station as a commuter rail stop. A New Orleans themed event venue, The Orchid Garden, in the Church Street Station complex was renovated for $2M and open in 2014. Lincoln Property purchased most of the property of the Church Street Station in November 2017. Plans for large scale redevelopment are underway in 2020. Today in the immediate vicinity there are a number of restaurants and bars, an event venue, high-rise apartments and condominiums, and a franchise of the gay-themed restaurant Hamburger Mary's.

From 1945 until his death, he worked for Radio-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise as a broadcaster of Spanish-language programmes. Bacarisse composed for the piano, mixed chamber ensembles, operas including El tesoro de Boabdil which won a French radio award in 1958, and orchestral works including four piano concertos and a violin concerto.

A related practice is ice swimming. Some consider cold water dousing to be a form of asceticism.  Cold water dousing  Cold water dousing is used to \\"shock\\" the body into a kind of fever. The body's reaction is similar to the mammalian diving reflex or possibly temperature biofeedback. Several meditative and awareness techniques seem to share similar effects with elevated temperature, such as Tummo. Compare cold water dousing with ice swimming. The effects of dousing are usually more intense and longer-lasting than just a cold shower. Ending a shower with cold water is an old naturopathic tradition. There are those who believe that this fever is helpful in killing harmful bacteria and leaving the hardier beneficial bacteria in the body.  National traditions = Burma  * Thingyan (Water Festival) was celebrated from 13 to 17 April in 2001 and the rituals included dousing.  Japan  * Some Japanese ascetic practices, as with Shinto misogi practices, include dousing. This is seen, for example, with some Aikido martialists. Morihei Ueshiba was known to practice cold water misogi. * Kamakura, Japan has a temple whose Nichiren Buddhist priests in training practice a ritual of 100 days of fasting, meditation and walking which ends with stripping to loincloths and dousing with ice cold water.  Russia  Jumping in freezing lakes, ice swimming, is an old Russian tradition that goes hand in hand with going to banya, a sauna-like bath. Some douse with a bucket of cold water. The bucket is filled with water and left out overnight. They then walk with it outside and spill it over themselves. Preferences include being barefoot outside on the earth, and performing dousing at certain times and more frequently when ill. For some, dousing accompanies fasting (absence of all food and water) as an alternate means for the body to obtain water. Some follow cold water dousing with air- drying outside or in wintertime taking a \\"snow bath\\" by rubbing handfuls of snow on the body or lying/moving in it. * Porfiry Ivanov's health system includes cold water dousing. * Cold water dousing is practiced by some Systema martialists.

First settled in 1881, Fairbank was the closest rail stop to nearby Tombstone, which made it an important location in the development of southeastern Arizona. The town was named for Chicago investor Nathaniel Kellogg Fairbank who partially financed the railroad, and was the founder of the Grand Central Mining Company, which had an interest in the silver mines in Tombstone. Today Fairbank is located within the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area (San Pedro RNCA). History A USGS map of southeastern Arizona, including Fairbank, 1910. Originally the location of a Native American village known as Santa Cruz in the 18th century, the area was later settled around the time the railroad came through in 1881, and developed further when the local railroad station was built in 1882. It was originally known as Junction City, then Kendall, then Fairbanks, and was formally founded as Fairbank on May 16, 1883 on the same day that the local Post Office opened. Due to its proximity to Tombstone, and the fact that it boasted the nearest railroad station to what was one of the largest cities in the western United States, Fairbank acted as a way point between Tombstone and the rest of the country, bringing supplies into the bustling town, and also acting as the departure point for the ore pulled from Tombstone's silver mines on its way to the mills in Contention City and Charleston. Fairbank was also home to a stage coach station on the Butterfield Overland Mail line which opened in 1885. At its height in the mid-1880s, the town housed approximately 100 residents, and boasted a steam quartz mill, a general store, a butcher shop, a restaurant, a saloon, a Wells Fargo office, the railroad depot, and a stage coach station. When the Tombstone mines closed after flooding in 1886, Fairbank's prominence declined as the nearby mills shutdown, and the rail depot it offered became increasingly unnecessary. Subsequent droughts drove away area farmers and ranchers, further isolating the town. Fairbank was reprieved from a possible extinction when the railroad linked nearby Bisbee to Fairbank's train depot in 1889, making Fairbank an important leg in the transit of copper mined from the highly productive Copper Queen Mine. However, the flooding of the San Pedro River in September 1890 caused significant property damage, thinning down the population further. On February 15, 1900, Fairbank was the scene of an attempted train robbery of the express car on the Benson-Nogales train by the Burt Alvord gang. Express Messenger and former lawman Jeff Milton, drove off the bandits despite a serious bullet wound sustained to his arm. The robbery was unsuccessful, and gang member \\"Three Fingered Jack\\" Dunlop was mortally wounded, later to die in Tombstone after confessing to the attempted robbery. In 1901, the Mexican land grant on which the town was situated was purchased by the Boquillas Land and Cattle Company who extended the leases on only the commercial building and several residences into the 1970s. Remnants An abandoned railroad bridge built in 1927 By the mid-1970s Fairbank was all but deserted. The final remaining residents left when the buildings were deemed unsafe. After that, the post office closed, and the side roads became overgrown and largely impassable. Some years later, in 1986, the former Mexican Land Grant was acquired by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the town was incorporated into the San Pedro Riparian NCA as the \\"Fairbank Historic Townsite\\". What remains of the town of Fairbank is now open to the public. The remaining structures include: * A commercial building, an adobe structure that used to house the general store, the post office, and the saloon. The structure has been stabilized by the BLM. * The Montezuma Hotel which was built in 1889 to the south of the Commercial Building. The hotel was torn down to make way for highway construction, and only portions of its foundation remain. * A small wooden house, built in 1885, in a style common in the 1880s. * The schoolhouse, built of gypsum block manufactured in nearby Douglas, AZ, was constructed in 1920, and was a functioning school through the 1930s. * A larger wooden house, built in 1925. * A stable and an outhouse, which were built in the early 1940s as part of a Works Progress Administration project based in Fairbank. * A railroad bridge, northwest of the townsite along the San Pedro River, built in 1927. * A railroad platform, west of the townsite, along the former railroad line In March 2007, the BLM restoration of the schoolhouse was completed, and the structure was opened to the public as a museum and information center for Fairbank. Geography Fairbank is located east of the San Pedro River, just off of Arizona State Route 82 at (31.7231456, -110.1884107). Demographics Shortly after its founding, the 1884 population estimate for Fairbank was roughly 100 people. US Census figures, taken every ten years, show the town's population peaking in 1890 at 478 residents, then shrinking to 171 by 1900, and then increasing again to a high of 269 in 1920 before entering a steady decline which ended with the abandonment of the town in the 1970s.

Typical causes of vasocongestion in humans includes menstruation, sexual arousal, REM sleep, strong emotions, illnesses and allergic reactions. Illnesses Menstrual cramps are one of the most common side effects of vasocongestion in adult females. Although pain and discomfort varies among individuals, vasocongestion is an essential part of the shedding of the lining of the uterus. Abnormal vasocongestion during the menstrual cycle can lead to irregular bleeding, severe and debilitating cramps and anemia caused by increased menstrual flow. The temporary vasocongestion of the cheeks of the face is called blushing. It may be caused by the emotions of anger or embarrassment. The illness of rosacea is a chronic vasocongestion condition of the face that primarily affects the cheeks and nose, but may include other areas such as the eyes and chin. Vasocongestion of the area around the human anus can lead to the formation of hemorrhoids. Human sexual behavior Vasocongestion is essential for sexual procreation in mammals since this is the force that causes the hardening of a penis during an erection. The same force leads to the hardening of the clitoris and vaginal lubrication during sexual arousal. Vern L. Bulloch, Science in the Bedroom , 1994 . (Accessed October 10, 2006) The decrease in vasocongestion in post-menopausal women may require some women to use artificial sexual lubricant to avoid pain during sexual intercourse.

Legal issues On September 17, 2011, Fabolous tweeted about Ray J playing his song \\"One Wish\\" on a piano inside Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s house during a documentary on Mayweather and Victor Ortiz. Ray J confronted Fabolous in Las Vegas just before he was set to take stage at the Palms Casino and is alleged to have punched him in the face. He was arrested following the incident and in an interview with Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club, he explained why he took offense to Fabolous's tweets, stating that he played on the piano \\"every day\\" and referred to Mayweather as his \\"big brother\\" since the pair grew up together. Ray J demanded an on-air apology from Fabolous and threatened him, stating that he would \\"smack\\" him again. A number of celebrities were present during the incident, including 50 Cent, Mayweather and Kevin Hart. Three years later Ray J took full responsibility for the incident. He acknowledged that he had learned from the experience and felt terrible about it as well.

Police were called and deemed the touching incidental but he was asked to leave by the hotel staff. Ray J became angered because he contends he spent tens of thousands of dollars at the hotel over the last year. At some point, he allegedly became belligerent and according to the police, spat at an officer and kicked out a police car window in the process of being arrested. The charges against him included vandalism, resisting arrest and battery against a police officer. Ray J posted $20,000 bail and was released. The Los Angeles County district attorney on July 21, 2014 filed charges against Ray J and a police spokesman said his initial hearing would take place on July 25. On July 22, 2014, prosecutors stated the arrest had turned into four criminal charges. He was charged with sexual battery, vandalism of a police car, battery against a police officer and resisting arrest. They claimed he willfully touched the woman's \\"intimate part\\" for the \\"specific purpose of sexual arousal, sexual gratification and sexual abuse.\\" On August 19, Ray J pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges. He was stopped by two police officers on August 6, 2014 in the San Fernando Valley. The officers claimed he was using his cell phone while driving, Ray J insisted that he was struggling to connect his Bluetooth. He was given a warning about texting and driving. The officers reportedly wanted him to step out of his vehicle, which he did, but Ray J claims they simply wanted to take a couple of photographs with him.

The term typically refers to a specific type of upper garment common in Europe during the 16th to the 18th century, or to the upper portion of a modern dress to distinguish it from the skirt and sleeves. The term comes from pair of bodies (because the garment was originally made in two pieces that fastened together, frequently by lacing). History Countrywoman's bodice, 19th century (detail of The Hay-Harvest by Joseph Julien) In modern usage, bodice typically refers to an upper garment that has removable sleeves or no sleeves, often low-cut, worn in Europe from the 16th century to the 18th century, either over a corset or in lieu of one. To achieve a fashionable shape and support the bust, the bodice was frequently stiffened with bents (a type of reed), or whalebone. The bodice was different from the corset of the time because it was intended to be worn over the other garments. In earlier periods, bodices and corsets were laced in spiral fashion, with one continuous lace. In later periods, both were laced like the modern tennis shoe, with eyelets facing one another. This was more convenient for women who had to dress themselves. In historical usage, particularly in Victorian and early 20th century fashion, a bodice (in earlier sources, body) instead indicates the upper part of a dress that was constructed in two parts (i.e., with separate skirt and bodice, such as a ballet tutu), but of matching or coordinating fabric with the intention of wearing the two parts as a unit. In dressmaking, the term waist (sometimes given as \\"dress waist\\" to distinguish it from a shirtwaist) was also used. During wear, the parts might be connected by hooks and eyes. This construction was standard for fashionable garments from the 18th century until the late 19th century, and had the advantages of allowing a voluminous skirt to be paired with a close-fitting bodice, and of allowing two or more bodices to be worn with the same skirt (e.g., a high-necked bodice and a low-necked bodice allowed the same skirt to serve for both daywear and evening wear). One-piece construction became more common after 1900 due to the trend for looser, more simply-constructed clothing with narrower skirts. One mid-19th-century style included the Agnes Sorel bodice, named after 15th-century royal mistress Agnes Sorel. This style was a day wear bodice, with a square cut neckline that had a high front and back and bishop sleeves. Bodice continues in use to refer to the upper portion (minus the sleeves) of a one- or two-piece dress. The bodice of a dress was called the corsage in the 19th century. Today A woman wearing a dirndl Bodices survive into modern times in the traditional or revived folk dress of many European countries (see, for example, Austrian dirndl or the Aboyne dress worn by Scottish highland dancers). They are also commonly seen today at Society for Creative Anachronism events or a Renaissance Fair.

It measured around long and wide, with a surface area of ‚Äîlarger than the whole island of Jamaica. Calved from the Ross Ice Shelf of Antarctica in March 2000, Iceberg B-15 broke up into smaller icebergs, the largest of which was named Iceberg B-15A. In 2003, B-15A drifted away from Ross Island into the Ross Sea and headed north, eventually breaking up into several smaller icebergs in October 2005. As of 2018, a large piece of the original iceberg was steadily moving northward, located between the Falkland Islands and South Georgia Island. History Iceberg B-15A four-year journey, July 2002 to March 2006 Iceberg B-15Z route 2014-2018 In the last weeks of March 2000, Iceberg B-15 calved from the Ross Ice Shelf near Roosevelt Island, Antarctica. The calving occurred along pre- existing cracks in the ice shelf. The iceberg measured around long and wide, with a surface area of ‚Äînearly as large as the island of Jamaica (). Scientists believe that the enormous piece of ice broke away as part of a long-term natural cycle, which occurs every fifty to one hundred years. In 2000, 2002, and 2003, Iceberg B-15 broke up into several pieces, the largest of which, B-15A, covered of the sea surface. In November 2003, after the separation from B-15J, B-15A drifted away from Ross Island on the open waters of the Ross Sea. In December 2003, a small knife-shaped iceberg, B-15K (about 300 km¬≤), detached itself from the main body of B-15A and started drifting northward. By January 2005, prevailing currents caused B-15A to drift toward the Drygalski Ice Tongue, a long extension of the land-based David Glacier, which flows through the coastal mountains of Victoria Land. A few kilometres from the ice tongue, the iceberg became stranded on a shallow seamount before resuming its northward course. On 10 April 2005, B-15A collided with the ice tongue, breaking off the tip of the ice tongue; the iceberg seemed unaffected by the collision. Iceberg B-15A continued to drift along the coast leaving McMurdo Sound. On 27‚Äì28 October 2005, the iceberg ran aground off Cape Adare in Victoria Land and broke into several smaller pieces, generating seismic signals that were detected as far away as the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station MacAyeal, D., Okal, E., Aster, R., Basis, J., Brunt, K., Cathles, L.

Iceberg B-15A then moved farther up north and broke up into more pieces. These were spotted by air force fisheries patrol on 3 November 2006. On 21 November 2006 several large pieces were seen just 60 km off the coast of Timaru, New Zealand‚Äîthe largest measured about , rising from the surface of the ocean. As of 2018, four pieces remain that are large enough to be tracked by the National Ice Center (at least 20 square nautical miles). One piece, B-15Z, measures 10 nautical miles by 5 nautical miles. It was located in the southern Atlantic ocean, about 150 nautical miles northwest of South Georgia Island. As it continues its move northward, the speed of melt increases. Most icebergs do not last long this far north. Effect on Antarctic ecology Researchers installing weather and GPS instruments on Iceberg B-15A, 29 January 2001 On 29 January 2001, researchers from the University of Chicago and the University of Wisconsin installed weather and Global Positioning System instruments on Iceberg B-15A. It was the first time an iceberg had been monitored in this way. The data gathered led to an unprecedented understanding of how giant icebergs make their way through the waters of Antarctica and beyond. Iceberg B-15A collided with the Drygalski Ice Tongue on 10 April 2005, breaking off an section of the ice tongue. Antarctic maps needed to be redrawn. B-15A prevented ocean currents and winds from assisting in the 2004‚Äì2005 summer break-up of the sea ice in McMurdo Sound, and was an obstacle to the annual resupply ships to three research stations. The floe was expected to cause a catastrophic decline in the population of Ad√©lie penguins, as it added considerable distances which parent penguins must travel back from the sea to their chicks. Weddell seals and Skuas are also inhabitants of McMurdo Sound and their populations may have been affected as well. In October 2006, a study showed that a large storm in the Gulf of Alaska generated a trans-Pacific ocean swell that may have contributed to breaking B15-A into many pieces on 27 October 2005. The swell travelled from Alaska to Antarctica over six days. Scientists are studying this event as an example of how weather in one area can have effects in other parts of the world, and with concern over the effects on global warming. A more detailed study in 2010, however, shows that the iceberg breakup was principally caused by repeated grounding with near-coastal bathymetry near Cape Adare, Victoria Land.

He is a 1981 graduate of Wilton High School, and a 1985 graduate of Tufts University. In 1985 he moved to New York City to work for ABC News, where he spent two years before joining the Dukakis for President Campaign in Des Moines, Iowa. After Dukakis‚Äô loss in 1988, he moved back to New York to work as a writer/producer for Linda Ellerbee‚Äôs Lucky Duck Productions. He left Lucky Duck in late 1991 to join the early Bill Clinton for President campaign in New Hampshire. He went on to play a major role in the general election campaign, serving in the famous War Room. In 1993 he moved from Little Rock, Arkansas to Washington, DC to work at the Democratic National Committee. He left the DNC in the fall of 1993 to join the Democratic Leadership Council, where he worked until starting the New Democrat Network in 1996. The New Democrat Network ceased operating in late 2004 and evolved into NDN and the New Policy Institute, the organization Rosenberg runs today. In 1993, Rosenberg oversaw the placement of the first American political party on the Internet, putting the DNC on Compuserve. Rosenberg helped found the Congressional Caucus the New Democrat Coalition in 1996. A project he founded and led from 2003 through 2005 eventually became The Democracy Alliance. Rosenberg was a member of the Democratic Platform Committee in 2004, and a leading candidate for Chair of the Democratic National Committee in 2005. He was a high level outside advisor to the Obama White House and Administration more broadly, working on issues from TPP to Immigration Reform to economic policy. Rosenberg is on the Board of the Jonathan M. Tisch College of Civic Life at Tufts University. In the fall of 2016 Rosenberg was a senior fellow at Tisch, teaching a class for undergraduates on American politics. Rosenberg is a member of the Department of State's Advisory Committee on International Communications and Information Policy (ACICIP). Rosenberg is an Advisory Board Member of the non-partisan Open Source Election Technology (OSET) Foundation.

NDN and the New Policy Institute Having founded the New Democrat Network in 1996, he currently serves as president of NDN, which has become committed to modernizing left-wing politics and building a persistent Democratic majority. The NDN eschews political orthodoxy when promoting candidates. Additionally, the NDN claims that it uses a more technologically modern and grassroots participatory approach to its activities than the DLC. Rosenberg is a member of the Aspen Institute‚Äôs 2001 Class of Henry Crown Fellows and served on the 2004 Democratic National Convention Platform Committee. Rosenberg has worked on the ground to help elect Democrats in 12 states across the country. Rosenberg has become known for his focus on modernizing and developing the party's organization and communications infrastructure, especially through the use of new technologies such as the internet.

It is a measure of leverage, and of how risky, or volatile, a company's operating income is. Definition There are various measures of operating leverage,Operating and Financial leverage which can be interpreted analogously to financial leverage. Costs One analogy is \\"fixed costs + variable costs = total costs ..similar to.. debt + equity = assets\\". This analogy is partly motivated because (for a given amount of debt) debt servicing is a fixed cost. This leads to two measures of operating leverage: One measure is fixed costs to total costs: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{FC}}{\\\\text{TC}}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{FC}}{\\\\text{FC}+\\\\text{VC}} Compare to debt to value, which is :\\\\frac{\\\\text{Debt}}{\\\\text{Assets}}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Debt}}{\\\\text{Debt}+\\\\text{Equity}} Another measure is fixed costs to variable costs: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{FC}}{\\\\text{VC}} Compare to debt to equity ratio: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{Debt}}{\\\\text{Equity}} Both of these measures depend on sales: if the unit variable cost is constant, then as sales increase, operating leverage (as measured by fixed costs to total costs or variable costs) decreases. Contribution [Contribution margin] is a measure of operating leverage: the higher the contribution margin is (the lower variable costs are as a percentage of total costs), the faster the profits increase with sales. Note that unlike other measures of operating leverage, in the linear Cost-Volume-Profit Analysis Model, contribution margin is a fixed quantity, and does not change with Sales. Contribution = Sales - Variable Cost DOL and Operating income Operating leverage can also be measured in terms of change in operating income for a given change in sales (revenue). The Degree of Operating Leverage (DOL) can be computed in a number of equivalent ways; one way it is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in Operating Income for a given percentage change in Sales : :\\\\text{DOL} = \\\\frac{\\\\%\\\\text{ change in Operating Income}}{\\\\% \\\\text{ change in Sales}} This can also be computed as Total Contribution Margin over Operating Income: :\\\\text{DOL} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total Contribution}}{\\\\text{Operating Income}} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Total Contribution}}{\\\\text{Total Contribution} - \\\\text{Fixed Costs}} = \\\\frac{(\\\\text{P}-\\\\text{V})\\\\cdot \\\\text{X}}{(\\\\text{P}-\\\\text{V})\\\\cdot \\\\text{X} - \\\\text{FC}} The above equivalence follows as the relative change in operating income with one more unit dX equals the contribution margin divided by operating income while the relative change in sales with one more unit dX equals price divided by revenue (or, in other words, 1 / X with X being the quantity). Alternatively, as Contribution Margin Ratio over Operating Margin: :\\\\text{DOL} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Contribution Margin Ratio}}{\\\\text{Operating Margin}} For instance, if a company has sales of 1,000,000 units, at price $50, unit variable cost of $10, and fixed costs of $10,000,000, then its unit contribution is $40, its Total Contribution is $40m, and its Operating Income is $30m, so its DOL is :\\\\frac{\\\\$\\\\text{40m}}{\\\\$\\\\text{30m}} = 1 \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\approx 1.33 This could also be computed as 80%=$40m/$50m Contribution Margin Ratio divided by 60%=$30m/$50m Operating Margin. It currently has Sales of $50m and Operating Income of $30m, so additional Unit Sales (say of 100,000 units) yield $5m more Sales and $4m more Operating Income: a 10% increase in Sales and a 10% \\\\times 1 \\\\frac{1}{3}= 13% increase in Operating Income. Assuming the model, for a given level of sales, the DOL is higher the higher fixed costs are (an example): for a given level of sales and profit, a company with higher fixed costs has a lower Operating Income, and hence its Operating Income increases more rapidly with Sales than a company with lower fixed costs (and correspondingly lower contribution margin and higher Operating Income). If a company has no fixed costs (and hence breaks even at zero), then its DOL equals 1: a 10% increase in Sales yields a 10% increase in Operating Income, and its operating margin equals its contribution margin: :\\\\frac{\\\\text{Operating Income}}{\\\\text{Sales}}=\\\\frac{\\\\text{Unit Price} - \\\\text{Unit Variable Cost}}{\\\\text{Unit Price}} DOL is highest near the break- even point; in fact, at the break-even point, DOL is undefined, because it is infinite: an increase of 10% in sales, say, increases Operating Income for 0 to some positive number (say, $10), which is an infinite (or undefined) percentage change; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is zero, so its DOL is undefined. Similarly, for a very small positive Operating Income (say, $.1), a 10% increase in sales may increase Operating Income to $10, a 100x (or 9,900%) increase, for a DOL of 990; in terms of margins, its Operating Margin is very small, so its DOL is very large. DOL is closely related to the rate of increase in the operating margin: as sales increase past the break-even point, operating margin rapidly increases from 0% (reflected in a high DOL), and as sales increase, asymptotically approaches the contribution margin: thus the rate of change in operating margin decreases, as does the DOL, which asymptotically approaches 1. Industry-specific Examples of companies with high operating leverage include companies with high R&D; costs, such as pharmaceuticals: it can cost billions to develop a drug, but then pennies to produce it. Hence from a life cycle cost analysis perspective, the ratio of preproduction costs (e.g. design widgets) versus incremental production costs (e.g. produce a widget) is a useful measure of operating leverage. Outsourcing Outsourcing a product or service is a method used to change the ratio of fixed costs to variable costs in a business. Outsourcing can be used to change the balance of this ratio by offering a move from fixed to variable cost and also by making variable costs more predictable.

The advent of the First World War delayed development of the organisation, however.  World War I  During the First World War, Rabbi Dr. Pinchas Kohn and Rabbi Dr. Emmanuel Carlebach (both from Germany),\\"The legal publishers of this new daily were the German rabbis Pinchas Kohn and Emmanuel Carlebach of the FVIOJ...\\"\\"At the wedding of Rav Emmanuel Carlebach zt\\"l of Cologne, all the married women (in the picture) wore shaitels.\\" were appointed as the rabbinical advisors to the German occupying forces in Poland. In this position, they worked closelyhttp://www.stevens- tech.edu/golem/llevine/rsrh/carlebach/german_rabbi_goes_east.pdf with the Grand Rabbi of Ger, Rabbi Avraham Mordechai Alter. As a result of this collaboration, they formed Agudath Israel, whose aim was to unify Eastern European and Western European Orthodox Judaism. Agudath Israel gained a significant following, particularly among Hasidic Jews. It had representatives running in the Polish elections after the First World War, and they won seats in that country's parliament (Sejm).\\"Agudath Israel... In time it became a political party represented in the Sejm (Polish Parliament).\\" \\"... between the wars, none was more effective than the Agudath Israel. ... in the Polish government and was represented in the Sejm (Polish Parliament).\\" \\"Agudas Yisroel succeeded in electing deputies to the Polish Sejm.\\" Among the elected representatives were Alexander Zusia Friedman, Rabbi Meir Shapiro, Rabbi Yosef Nechemya Kornitzer of Krak√≥w, and Rabbi Aharon Lewin of Reysha. Prominent Torah scholars who led Agudath Yisroel included the Gerrer Rebbe, the Radziner Rebbe, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Elazar Leiner, and the Chafetz Chaim. In Latvia between 1922-1934, members of the Agudath Israel faction, led by Mordechai Dubin, were elected to Saeima (The Parliament). Another prominent member of Agudath Israel was Michoel Ber Weissmandl. In the United Kingdom, the Agudath Israel movement was represented by the Adath Israel Synagogue, formed in 1909, and the Union of Orthodox Hebrew Congregations, formed in 1926. By 1943 Agudath Israel represented approximately 5000 families and was led by Rabbi Dr Solomon Schonfeld. The British secretary of the Agudath Israel World Organization, the political wing of the movement, was Harry Goodman, publisher and editor of Jewish Weekly. He played a key part in maintaining the Agudath Israel organization through World War II.Pamela Shatzkes (2002) Holocaust and Rescue: Impotent or Indifferent? Anglo-Jewry 1938-1945 Basingstoke: Palgrave, pp. 13-14 Prior to World War II and the Holocaust, Agudath Israel operated a number of Jewish educational institutions throughout Europe. After the war, it has continued to operate such institutions in the United States as Agudath Israel of America, and in Israel. Agudath Israel is guided by its Moetzes Gedolei HaTorah (Council of Sages) in Israel and the USA.  Post World War II  In the post-War period, Agudath Israel was active in Europe to provide aid for Holocaust Survivors. There was a branch in the World Agudath Israel World Organization in England located att 37/38 Mitre Street in London. Another branch was located in Switzerland, located at 59 Lavaterstrasseled which was led by Dr. Shlomo Ehrman. In allied-occupied Germany there were branches as well.

Agudath Israel and the State of Israel When Israel was founded, Agudath Israel reached a modus vivendi with the State of Israel, which was predominantly led by secularists. It helped secure an agreement between Ashkenazi Rabbinical leaders and David Ben-Gurion which ensured Ashkenazi rabbinical co-ordination with the state, as well as the implementation of such guarantees as public observance consistent with the laws of the Sabbath and Kashrut. It has established itself as an Israeli political party winning seats in the Knesset either as the Agudat Israel or in coalition with other Orthodox groups running under the name United Torah Judaism.\\"... list made up of the ultra-Orthodox parties Agudat Israel and Degel HaTorah ...

The Phoenicians and the West, Politics, Colonies, and Trade. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001. The exact founding date of Utica is a matter of controversy. Several classical authors date its foundation to around 1100BC. The archaeological evidence, however, suggests a foundation no earlier than the eighth centuryBC. The inland settlement used Rusucmona (\\"Cape Eshmun\\") on Cape Farina to the northeast as its chief port, although continued silting has rendered the present-day settlement at Ghar el-Melh a small farming community. Although Carthage was later founded about 40 km from Utica, records suggest \\"that until 540BC Utica was still maintaining political and economic autonomy in relation to its powerful Carthaginian neighbor\\". Carthaginian rule By the fourth century BC, Utica came under Punic control, but continued to exist as a privileged ally of Carthage.Walbank, F. W., Astin, A.E., Frederiksen, M.W., Ogilvie R.M. and Drummond, A., eds. The Rise of Rome to 220 BC. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VII of The Cambridge Ancient History. Soon, commercial rivalry created problems between Carthage and Utica. This relationship between Carthage and Utica began to disintegrate after the First Punic War, with the outbreak of rebellion among mercenaries who had not received compensation for their service to Carthage. Originally, Utica refused to participate in this rebellion, so that the Libu forces led by Spendius and Matho laid siege to Utica and nearby Hippocritae.Polybius. \\"The Histories.\\" Book 1 Loeb Classical Library.

Roman rule Utica again defied Carthage in the Third Punic War, when it surrendered to Rome shortly before the breakout of war in 150 BC. After its victory, Rome rewarded Utica by granting it an expanse of territory stretching from Carthage to Hippo.Walbank, F. W., Astin, A. E., Frederiksen, M. W., and Ogilvie R. M., eds. Rome and the Mediterranean to 133 BC. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. Vol. VIII of The Cambridge Ancient History. As a result of the war, Rome created a new province of Africa, and Utica became its capital, which meant that the governor's residence was there along with a small garrison. Over the following decades Utica also attracted Roman citizens who settled there to do business. Utica museum During the Roman Civil War between the supporters of Pompey and Caesar, the remaining Pompeians, including Cato the Younger, fled to Utica after being defeated at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. Caesar pursued them to Utica, meeting no resistance from the inhabitants. Cato, who was the leader of the Pompeians, ensured the escape of his fellow senators and anyone else who desired to leave, then committed suicide, unwilling to accept the clemency of Caesar. Displaying their fondness for Cato, \\"the people of Utica...called Cato their saviour and benefactor... And this they continued to do even when word was brought that Caesar was approaching. They decked his body in splendid fashion, gave it an illustrious escort, and buried it near the sea, where a statue of him now stands, sword in hand\\".Plutarch.

Vol IV 2 May 2007 Utica obtained the formal status of a municipium in 36 BCPaul Lachlan MacKendrick, The North African Stones Speak (UNC Press Books, 1 Dec. 2000) p46. and its inhabitants became members of the Quirina tribe. The city was chosen by the Romans as the place where the governor of their new Africa Province was resident, but the silting of the port (because of the Medjerda River) damaged the importance of Utica. During the reign of Augustus, however, the seat of provincial government was moved to a since rebuilt Carthage, although Utica did not lose its status as one of the foremost cities in the province. When Hadrian was emperor, Utica requested to become a full Roman colony, but this request was not granted until Septimius Severus, a native of the Province of Africa, took the throne.Bunson, Matthew. \\"Utica.\\" Encyclopedia of the Roman Empire. New York: Facts on File, Inc., 1994. The city and all the area east of the Fossatum Africae was nearly fully romanised by the time of Septimius Severus. According to historian Theodore Mommsen, all the inhabitants of Utica spoke Latin and practised Christianity in the fourth and early fifth century.Mommsen, Theodore.

Statue of Trajan from Utica ruins Indeed, there are more than a dozen bishops documented in Utica. The first, Aurelius, intervened at the council held at Carthage in 256 AD by St. Cyprian to discuss the question of the \\"lapsi\\". Maurus, the second bishop, was accused of apostasy during the persecution of 303 AD. The third, Victorius, took part in the Council of Arles in 314 AD along with Cecilianus of Carthage; he is mentioned in the Roman Martyrology on 23 August. Then the fourth, Quietus, assisted at the Council of Carthage (349) proclaimed by Gratus. At the Conference of Carthage (411) which saw gathered together the bishops of Nicene Christianity and of heretical Donatism Victorius II took part for the Church and Gedudus for the Donatists. The historian Morcelli added the bishop Gallonianus, present at the Council of Carthage (419), who, according to J. Mesnage, instead belonged to the Diocese of Utina. Then the Bishop Florentinus, who intervened at the Synod of Carthage (484), was met by the Vandal king Huneric, after which he was exiled. Faustinianus participated at the Council of Carthage (525). He was followed by the bishop Giunilius, an ecclesiastical writer, who dedicated his works to Primasius of Hadrumetum. In the seventh century was the bishop Flavianus, who assisted at the Council of Carthage (646) against Monothelitism; and Potentinus, who was exiled in Spain and intervened at the Council of Toledo (684). With the Arab conquest, Utica was destroyed and disappeared even as an independent diocese. Only during the early Renaissance Utica was again a diocese, when the Spanish Empire conquered the region for some decades and Pedro del Campo was named bishop of the recreated Diocese of Utica in 1516 AD.Dioceses Uticiensis Ruins The site of the ruins of Utica is set on a low hill, composed of several Roman villas. Their walls still preserve decorative floor mosaics. To the northwest of these villas is a Punic necropolis, with Punic sarcophagi below the Roman level. Currently, the site is located about 30 km from Tunis and 30 km from Bizerte and near cities with four other historical sites: * Zhana: village two kilometers from the site and has some important monuments; * Ghar El Melh : city located on a narrow strip of land between the mountains and the sea and welcoming several fortresses; * El Alia : city which houses monuments Andalusian style; * Metline : coastal town of Andalucian style.

Origin Boris is first found in written records in the case of the Bulgarian ruler Prince Boris I (852‚Äì889), who adopted Christianity in 864 AD and introduced it to his people. His name came to be known in Europe in relation to this particular act. Moreover, after his death in 907 AD he was proclaimed the first Bulgarian saint, and traces of his Orthodox sainthood during this period can be found as far away as Catholic Ireland.

However, Prince Boris was purportedly not a Slav. He descended from the Bulgars. Among the Bulgars the name was known in its two forms: Boris and Bogoris.Boris ‚Äì Name Meaning and OriginThe etymology and history of first names. History Boris started its worldwide spread with its adoption by Rus' Slavs from the First Bulgarian Empire. Bulgarian cultural missions intensified in the 10th century, during the reign of Tsar Petar and with them the spread of Bulgarian culture to what would become Ukrainian and Russian lands continued. It is speculated that the name of the Bulgarian saint Tsar Boris I reached the Rus in the late 10th century, likely during the reign of Boris II of Bulgaria (969‚Äì977), great-grandson of Boris I. In 967 the Byzantines instigated the Rus to attack the First Bulgarian Empire and it is probably around this campaign that the marriage of Vladimir I of Kiev to a Bulgarian noblewoman, who is assumed to be a daughter of Peter I, i.e., sister of Boris II, was arranged.–ú–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏.–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ –º–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—ã –¥–ª—è –∏–∑—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–π –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∏.–ö–ò–ï–í–°–ö–ò–ô –ö–ù–Ø–ó–¨ –Ø–†–û–°–õ–ê–í –í–õ–ê–î–ò–ú–ò–†–û–í–ò–ß.–ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –†—É—Å—å –∏ –µ–µ —é–∂–Ω—ã–µ —Å–æ—Å–µ–¥–∏. –ö–∏–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞—è –†—É—Å—å –∏ –ë–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä–∏—è. One of the sons of Vladimir I was given the name Boris. As evidenced by the Rus' Primary Chronicle, Boris and Gleb were sons of Vladimir I, born to him by the Bulgarian princess. During Vladimir's reign in 988 the conversion of the Kievan Rus' to Christianity took place. In this conversion, both ordinary priests and prelates from Bulgaria played a significant part.–ü–û–ö–†–™–°–¢–í–ê–ù–ï–¢–û –ù–ê –ö–ò–ï–í–°–ö–ê –†–£–° –ò –ë–™–õ–ì–ê–†–ò–¢–ï, –¥-—Ä –ì–æ—Ä–∞–Ω –ë–ª–∞–≥–æ–µ–≤, –ë–ù–¢. Also, with the adoption of the Byzantine calendar and the Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar, the cult of St. Boris entered the Rus' Orthodox Church. –°–≤—è—Ç–æ–π –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–≤–µ—Ä–Ω—ã–π –∏ —Ä–∞–≤–Ω–æ–∞–ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ü–∞—Ä—å –ë–æ—Ä–∏—Å –ë–æ–ª–≥–∞—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π. In 1015, the princes Boris and Gleb were killed by their stepbrother Sviatopolk I of Kiev, who usurped the throne. Within a short time, Boris and Gleb were canonized and ever since, they have been the native soldier-saints most revered among the Ukrainians, Russians and Belarusians. Spreading In addition to Kievan Rus the name Boris went over to other neighbours of Bulgaria as well. An example of this is the case of the Hungarian prince Boris Kalamanos (1112‚Äì1155), son of the Magyar king from his marriage with Euphtimia, daughter of the Kievan prince Vladimir II Monomakh. For a fairly long period men named Boris were found predominantly in the courts and among the nobility, but eventually the name became popular among all strata in the Russian Empire, including Siberia and Alaska.

I-Drive is located several miles southwest of proper Downtown Orlando in the southernmost limits of the city. The International Drive area serves a similar purpose to that of the Las Vegas Strip in Las Vegas as the core of the tourism area. Route description International Drive stretches approximately 11.1 miles, with the northern part extending into the southernmost city limits of Orlando and the remainder of the central and southern portion located in unincorporated Orange County. An additional extension which does not directly intersect with the main section of International Drive is known as International Drive South, partly located in the northern portion of Osceola County. Surrounding cross-roads include Sand Lake Road, Kirkman Road, SR 536, and Universal Boulevard, which runs parallel to the midsection of International Drive. I-Drive has four lanes, two in each direction, from its north end at Oak Ridge Road to Pointe Plaza Dr. (former Universal Blvd. south end; see below), and again between the northern and southern intersections with Westwood Blvd. It has six lanes, three in each direction, from Pointe Plaza Dr. to the Beachline Expressway (the eastbound ramps to the Beachline tie into the northern intersection with Westwood Blvd.), and again from the southern intersection with Westwood Blvd. to its end at SR 536. The entirety of International Drive South, from SR 535 to US 192, is entirely six lanes. The section of I-Drive from Universal Blvd. to Sand Lake Road has no median or center turn lane, and frequently has heavy traffic and gridlock in the evenings in the tourism corridor, affecting Carrier Dr. and Sand Lake Road. The International Drive area is home to the wax museum Madame Tussauds, the Orange County Convention Center complex, the Pointe Orlando entertainment complex, major hotels, SeaWorld Orlando, Aquatica (SeaWorld's water park), Fun Spot America amusement park, the ICON Orlando Ferris wheel, the world's tallest StarFlyer (opened June 1, 2018), the world's tallest Slingshot, the World's Largest Entertainment McDonald's, CoCo Key Hotel & Water Resort, the I-Drive 360 entertainment complex, museums, themed restaurants, bars, outlet malls, mini golf courses like Pirate's Cove Adventure Golf and other tourism- related commercial properties and tourist attractions such as Air Florida Helicopter Inc, Wonder Works and The Magical Midway. The major theme park resort Universal Orlando is also located in the area. Wet n' Wild was a water park opened on March 13, 1977, formerly located on International Drive, considered to be America's first water park until it closed on December 31, 2016 to make way for a new water park built by Universal called Volcano Bay that opened up on May 25, 2017.  Public transportation  The I-Ride Trolley system operated by the International Drive Master Transit & Improvement District provides bus transportation along the I-Drive Resort Area primarily for tourists, convention attendees, and locals alike. Several Lynx public bus routes also serve the I-Drive area with routes to Orlando International Airport, Downtown Orlando and other parts of the city.  History  The first section of I-Drive was laid out in the 1960s by attorney Finley Hamilton to serve his Hilton Inn South, opened in May 1970. He imagined that once Walt Disney World opened in October 1971, tourists would spot the hotel when traveling to the park along Interstate 4. \\"They called the hotel 'Finley's Folly' - everyone, all of my friends,\\" Hamilton said. \\"They said it was in the boondocks. ...But it turned out to be highly successful. ...I came up with International Drive,\\" he recalled, \\"because it sounded big and important.\\" International Drive was eventually extended to its current north point (where Prime Outlets is now) and southward past the Beachline Expressway. The International Drive Master Transit and Improvement District was created in 1992 to provide growth management, transportation, and infrastructure development for the area with collaboration between the local governments and I-Drive businesses. One of the most critical projects presented to the organization is to create an efficient transportation system for tourists on the I-Drive strip; this prompted the creation of the I-Ride bus trolley system.  Universal Boulevard  Universal Boulevard runs roughly parallel to International Drive from the Beachline Expressway north, then crosses I-Drive and intersects I-4 via an overpass into the Universal Orlando Resort. Originally built as Republic Drive, it originally stopped at International Drive and fed into ramps onto and off I-4 eastbound. In 1998, the extension north into Universal Studios was opened (in preparation for the opening of Islands of Adventure in 1999), and the road was renamed to Universal Blvd. The intersection at I-4 still only has ramps onto and off I-4 eastbound; the ramps on westbound I-4 connect not to Universal Blvd., but to Hollywood Way, necessitating a right turn to get to Universal Blvd. Southbound, it originally fed into International Drive just north of the Orange County Convention Center (the current West Building). The north corner of the intersection is now the Pointe Orlando shopping district. When the North Building (then Phase V) of the OCCC was planned, it was also planned to extend Universal Boulevard along its current alignment on the north side of the North Building. Plans were made in conjunction with the Williamsburg subdivision to design the intersection at the Beachline Expressway so that traffic would not inadvertently clog Orangewood Boulevard, which already met the Beachline at that point (Exit 2). The extension was opened in early 2003, and the old connector to I-Drive at Pointe Orlando was renamed Pointe Plaza Avenue. An electric sign system on the Beachline directs convention-goers to the proper road so as to avoid unnecessary traffic on I-Drive. Universal Boulevard has fewer businesses, thus much less traffic serving as an overflow exit road for the Orange County Convention Center during major events. Several planned communities and extended-stay business apartments are planned for the corridor, including the Village of Imagine, across from the OCCC North Building. The University of Central Florida opened the off-campus Rosen College of Hospitality Management, funded by local hotelier Harris Rosen, in 2005 at Universal Blvd. and the Beachline. Universal Blvd. is currently six lanes from Vineland Rd. southbound to International Drive, then four lanes southbound to Pointe Plaza Ave., then six lanes again to the Beachline. Only one lane in each direction passes under the Beachline to connect to Orangewood Blvd., which is four lanes on the other side.

A scroll wheel is a wheel used for scrolling. The term usually refers to such wheels found on computer mice (where they can also be called a mouse wheel). It is often made of hard plastic with a rubbery surface, and on a mouse is usually located between the left and right mouse buttons and is positioned perpendicular to the mouse surface.  Functionality  Most often, rolling the upper side of the wheel away from your body is to scroll \\"upward\\" or \\"forward\\", and the reverse direction is to scroll \\"downward\\" or \\"backward\\". In a graphical user interface, the \\"upward\\" motion moves contents of the window downward (and the scrollbar thumb, if present, upward), and vice versa. In other configurations (sometimes called \\"natural scrolling\\") the effect is inverted. On a mouse, the scroll-wheel can often also be used as a third mouse button by pressing down on it. Some mice can scroll horizontally as well as vertically, using a tilting scroll-wheel, or additional wheel on a perpendicular axis located elsewhere on the mouse. The wheel is often, but not always, engineered with detents to turn in discrete steps, rather than continuously as an analog axis, to allow the operator to more easily intuit how far they are scrolling. Trackwheel (1) on a BlackBerry Scroll wheels are prevalent on modern computer mice and have become an integral part of the hardware interface. However, non- wheeled mice are still available.  History  The scroll wheel on a mouse has been invented multiple times by different people unaware of the others' work. Other scrolling controls on a mouse, and the use of a wheel for scrolling both precede the combination of wheel and mouse. The earliest known example of the former is the Mighty Mouse prototype developed jointly by NTT, Japan and ETH Z√ºrich, Switzerland (Kunio ≈åno, Ken'ichi Fukaya and J√ºrg Nievergelt) in 1985. It had a thumb-operated combined analog button/toggle switch on the side for smooth scrolling. At the ACM SIGCHI conference in 1989, Gina Danielle Venolia from Apple presented a mouse prototype with a horizontal thumb-wheel for scrolling and for moving along the Z-axis. In her patent application from 1992 wheels were on both sides and vertical wheels. Jack McCauley claims to having developed an early mouse prototype with a top- mounted wheel for the Z-axis, at about the same time. Jack McCauley's top mounted Scroll wheel prototype, supposedly circa 1987. In 1995, the Taiwanese company KYE Systems released the first commercial mouse with scroll wheel. It was named Genius EasyScroll and was also available as Mouse Systems ProAgio.topdesignmag.com ‚Äì Mouse History In Photosfuntrivia.com ‚Äì Quiet As a Mouse ‚Äì Fun Facts, Questions, Answers, Information The scroll wheel was popularized by the Microsoft IntelliMouse in 1996 along with support for the mouse wheel in Microsoft Office 97. It had been based on ideas developed by Eric Michelman since 1993 with input from Chris Graham.Coding Horror: Meet The Inventor of the Mouse WheelThe History of the Scroll Wheel Scroll wheels can also be found on such handheld devices such as PDAs, or mobiles phones such as early Sony models and BlackBerry devices. They have also appeared on keyboards, particularly on Logitech and Microsoft models, usually located to the left of the caps lock key.  Alternatives  Instead of a scroll-wheel, some mice (and other devices) use an alternative but similar component. Laptop computers often include a touchpad programmed with a pointing device gesture that mimics a scroll-wheel (either by dedicating an edge of the pad for scrolling, or activating scrolling through a multitouch gesture). Many Linux distributions offer a method of scrolling using the touchpad where the user will first activate scroll-mode by pressing in a corner of the pad, and then dragging in a circle around the center of the pad; letting go of the touchpad will switch back to the default mouse-mode. In mice, alternatives include scroll balls (similar to trackballs, such as on Apple's Mighty Mouse and some serial/PS/2 mice, which combine horizontal and vertical scrolling), pointing sticks, integrated touchpads (as on Apple's Magic Mouse) or optical sensors,. Unusual examples include a joystick-style hatswitch present on an early Saitek mouse,, and a central 4-way switch-pad found on the Cherry Power Pad Mouse M-1000.  Other applications  Scroll-wheel motion is often used to control other aspects of a system. For instance, it can allow the user to switch between a series of options, zoom in or out, or increment/decrement any value. In first person shooter computer games, scroll-wheels are often used to switch between weapons, zoom in/out a telescopic sight, or even to allow the player to lean left and right if horizontal scrolling is available. CAD applications such as AutoDesk's AutoCAD use the mouse wheel to navigate the space in which the user is drawing. This has also become a de facto standard in 3D applications such as Trimble's SketchUp where the wheelscroll is zoom, and wheelclick with a mouse drag is orbit.

By 2008 the unit was responsible for investigating all non-fatal shootings for the Metropolitan Police, and in February 2012 the unit's remit was again expanded: the new Trident Gang Crime Command was launched, incorporating responsibility for tackling wider gang crime. In 2013 the unit gave up responsibility for investigating fatal shootings, which was taken over by the Homicide and Serious Crime Command. Trident is currently led by Detective Chief Superintendent Dean Haydon, who joined the team from the Counter Terrorism Command in 2012. The Chairman of the Trident Independent Advisory Group (IAG) is no longer Claudia Webbe, who was a founding member of the IAG. The perceived importance of Trident's mission was such that it was established as a dedicated Operational Command Unit, called the Trident Operational Command Unit, within the Metropolitan Police Specialist Crime Directorate. The campaign uses gun amnesties and advertisements encouraging people to phone Crimestoppers with information related to gun crime. These advertisements appear in the media, nightclubs, on petrol pumps, telephone boxes, and on the radio. As part of Specialist Crime and Operations Directorate, Trident is also known as SC&O8.; As the timeline of the police unit and program has roughly paralleled the development and growth of the rap-styled UK Grime urban music scene, Trident and Grime have had numerous and varied interactions that have mirrored early controversy and conflict around American Gangsta Rap. While some artists like Giggs have spoken out against what they claim is heavy- handed censorship and attempts to sabotage their careers by applying pressure to venue owners, radio stations, and record labels, others like the Roll Deep Crew have worked with Trident to create anti-violence messaging packaged in ways more likely to reach marginalized urban youth. Prominent artist JME, particularly known for his conscious lyrics which are dismissive of content that relies on excessively violent hyperbole, released a short film via VICE Magazine, entitled \\"The Police vs Grime Music\\", investigating the legal details of the phenomenon of police suppression of grime events. In 2006, Trident officers raided the home of vintage gun enthusiast Mick Shepherd, seizing much of his collection.. At the time, press reports claimed a \\"huge gun-smuggling racket\\" had been uncovered, and that guns sold by Shepherd were linked to a number of murders. After being held in Pentonville and then the high-security Belmarsh prisons on remand for 10 months awaiting trial,. Shepherd was acquitted of all 13 firearms offences with which he was charged.

It passes underneath the National Mall near the U.S. Capitol and ends at a junction with US 50 at New York Avenue, roughly north of the 3rd Street Tunnel. Despite its proximity to I-395 in Maryland, the route is unrelated and unconnected. I-395 is known by three different names over its various segments. The Virginia portion is part of the larger Shirley Highway that continues southward on I-95 beyond the terminus of I-395. In the District of Columbia, it is known as the Southwest Freeway from the 14th Street Bridge to the Southeast Freeway interchange (I-695), the Center Leg or Center Leg Freeway from the Southeast Freeway interchange to New York Avenue. Route description= Virginia  The intersection where I-395, I-95, and the I-495 (Capital Beltway) meet is called the Springfield Interchange. Unofficially, this interchange is referred to as The Mixing Bowl. This moniker causes confusion, because the intersection of I-395, Washington Boulevard, and Columbia Pike several miles north was historically known by that name, and continues to be recognized by the Virginia Department of Transportation as such. I-395 contains a third roadway: reversible, barrier-separated Virginia HOT lanes with their own entrances and exits, also known locally as the \\"express lanes\\", between South Eads Street near the Pentagon in Arlington County and State Route 610 (Garrisonville Rd.) in Stafford County, Virginia. During morning and evening rush hour, traffic on this roadway flows in the direction of rush-hour traffic. At these times, the road may only be used by vehicles containing three or more passengers and by motorcycles, alternative-fuel cars, hybrids registered in Virginia before July 1, 2006, and law enforcement vehicles. At other times, the road is either open to all traffic in one direction or closed to all traffic. In 2012, the exemption was modified to be \\"open-ended\\" rather than year-to-year. This third roadway was built as a single-lane busway, the first in the United States, before being expanded and converted to HOV use. A 2007 survey found that during the morning rush hour, the HOV lanes carry about 65% of travelers on I-395 (61,000 commuters), including 32,000 in transit buses and 29,000 in private vehicles with two or more people. The other 33,000 commuters (35% of total users) drove alone. I-395 and US 1 cross the Potomac River from Virginia to Washington, D.C., on three parallel four-lane bridges, together known as the 14th Street Bridge. Potomac River crossings for the Washington Metro's Yellow Line and for a major CSX railroad line are immediately downstream here. This site has long been a major Potomac River crossing, with the first bridge constructed here in 1809. Of the present highway spans, the eastern one was built in 1950, the western one in 1962, and the central one in 1972.  District of Columbia  After crossing the 14th street Bridge, the freeway has a left-side exit allowing access to US 1 (exit 1). The southbound side of I-395 has no access to northbound US 1 here. I-395 crosses Potomac Park (exit 2) and a second bridge, the Francis Case Memorial Bridge over the Washington Channel. Here, the route bends from a generally northeast direction to a due east direction, interchanging (exit 3) with the 9th and 12th Street Expressways, two tunnels that carry traffic under the National Mall. A series of complex interchanges (numbered 4, 5, 6, and 7) provide partial access to Maine Avenue and C Street SW, as well as connections to Interstate 695. Immediately after I-695, the freeway makes a hard turn to the due north to follow the Third Street Tunnel immediately under Union Square and just to the west of the United States Capitol Building. Emerging from the tunnel, I-395 follows a depressed roadway (the Center Leg Freeway) that has three more partial interchanges (exits 8, 9, and 10) with local streets before terminating at New York Avenue/US 50.

History=Shirley Highway The portion of Interstate 395 between the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and the interchange with Interstate 95 and the Capital Beltway in Springfield is part of the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway, named for a Virginia Highway Commissioner who died on July 16, 1941, just a few weeks after approving work on the new expressway. Originally State Route 350, the full length of the Shirley Highway was opened on September 6, 1949, from south of the Pentagon to Woodbridge, Virginia, along what is now better known as the Interstate 95 corridor. The Shirley Highway featured the nation's first reversible bus lanes, a precursor to today's HOV lanes. During an evening rush-hour snowstorm in 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed on take-off from Ronald Regan Washington National Airport, hitting the easternmost of the three highway bridges known as the 14th Street Bridge. The oldest span, formerly named the Rochambeau, is now named the Arland D. Williams, Jr. Memorial Bridge, in honor of a passenger of Flight 90 who survived the crash, escaped from the sinking aircraft, and perished in the Potomac River while saving others from the icy waters. The center span is now called the Rochambeau Bridge, and the western span, the George Mason Memorial Bridge. Interstate Highway through Washington Original plans called for I-95 to travel through Washington, D.C., and Prince George's County, Maryland, toward the northeastern portion of the Capital Beltway, from which I-95 presently continues its northbound route. However, neighborhood opposition in the District halted this plan in 1977, diverting planned funding toward construction of the Washington Metro. The only remnant of the Maryland extension is a series of ramp stubs near College Park, which now lead to a Park & Ride. The portion of I-95 within the Beltway became I-395, while the eastern half of the Beltway was re-designated I-95 (and, later, co-signed I-95/I-495). I-395 currently terminates in Washington, D.C., at a traffic signal at U.S. Route 50, which is New York Avenue, near Mount Vernon Square. Center Leg Freeway development / Capitol Crossing The District government finalized a deal in 2010 with the Louis Dreyfus Group to construct a mixed-use development in the airspace over the Center Leg Freeway portion of Interstate 395. The $425 million office, residential, and retail project at the east end of the Judiciary Square neighborhood will also restore the area's original L'Enfant Plan street grid by reconnecting F and G Streets over the freeway. The project was awaiting final regulatory approval and expected to be complete by 2016. In 2015, work began on I-395 in conjunction with the Capitol Crossing, a major real estate project in D.C, part of which lies on top of the highway. The work involves adding a $200 million concrete platform that connects neighborhoods that have been severed by the freeway, creating a better community atmosphere in the eastern edge of downtown. DDOT expected the work would take up to four years. Future In 2015, the Commonwealth of Virginia announced that the HOV lanes between the Turkeycock Run bridge and Eads Street (at The Pentagon) will be converted to toll lanes as part of the I-395 Express Lanes Extension project. The existing HOV lanes, which run in both directions in some areas, became reversible HOT lanes for the entire scope of this project, spanning . Part of the project involved the reconfiguring of the Pentagon interchange to provide greater access to Army Navy Drive, as well as the closing of the on-ramp‚Äîfrom the southbound HOV lanes to the mainline Interstate southbound‚Äîlocated just west of the Pentagon interchange. All existing HOV interchanges within the project's scope became tolled, except for the northbound exit and southbound entrance at Seminary Road, which remains toll-free while retaining its HOV- only restriction. Vehicles carrying three or more passengers are still be able to use the former HOV lanes for free. The express lanes opened on November 17th, 2019. Exit list Exits in Washington, D.C. were unnumbered until 2008. In 2014, in conjunction with the rebuilding of the 11th Street Bridges and the Southeast Freeway, some exit numbers were converted to a mileage-based numbering system.

The screenplay was adapted from a novel by Roy Chanslor. In 2008, Johnny Guitar was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \\"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\\". Plot On the outskirts of a wind-swept Arizona cattle town, an aggressive and strong-willed saloonkeeper named Vienna (Joan Crawford) maintains a volatile relationship with the local cattlemen and townsfolk. Not only does she support the railroad being laid nearby (the cattlemen oppose it), but she permits \\"The Dancin' Kid\\" (Scott Brady) (her former amour) and his confederates to frequent her saloon. The locals, led by John McIvers (Ward Bond) and egged on by Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge), a onetime rival of Vienna, are determined to force Vienna out of town, and the hold-up of the stage (they suspect, erroneously, by \\"The Dancin' Kid\\") offers a perfect pretext. Vienna faces them down, helped by the mysterious and just arrived Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden). McIvers gives Vienna, Johnny Guitar, and \\"The Dancin Kid\\" and his sidekicks 24 hours to leave. Johnny turns out to be Vienna's ex-lover and a reformed gunslinger whose real name is Johnny Logan. A smouldering love/hate relationship develops. The Dancin' Kid and his gang rob the town bank to fund their escape to California, but the pass is blocked by a railroad crew dynamiting a way in, and they flee back to their secret hideout behind a waterfall. Emma Small convinces the townsfolk that Vienna is as guilty as the rest, and the posse rides to her saloon. Vienna appears to be getting the best of another verbal confrontation when one of the wounded bank robbers, Turkey (Ben Cooper), is discovered under a table. Emma persuades the men to hang Vienna and Turkey, and burns the saloon down. At the last second Vienna is saved by Johnny Guitar. Vienna and Johnny escape the posse and find refuge in The Dancin' Kid's secret hideaway. The posse tracks them down, and the last two of Kid's men are killed by infighting. A halt is called to the bloodbath by the posse's leader, McIvers. Emma challenges Vienna to a showdown and shoots Vienna in the shoulder; The Dancin' Kid calls to Emma but is killed by a bullet to the head by an angered Emma. Vienna then shoots Emma in the head. The posse allows Johnny and Vienna to leave the hideout in peace, watching them go.

Crawford held the film rights to the book, which author Roy Chanslor had dedicated to her, brought the script to Republic and had them hire Ray to direct it.Bette and Joan: The Divine FeudJoan Crawford: The Ultimate StarJoan Crawford, The Essential BiographyProduction Files Crawford wanted either Bette Davis or Barbara Stanwyck for the role of Emma Small, but they were too expensive.Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud, page 266. Claire Trevor was next in mind for the role but was unable to accept because she was tied up with another film.Johnny Guitar production files Finally, Nicholas Ray brought in McCambridge. Most people claimed Crawford was easy to work with, always professional, generous, patient and kind.Johnny Dearest, www.sedonamonthly.com, October 2003Interview with Ernest Borgnine, Issues between the two women cropped up early on, but Ray was not alarmed ‚Äì at first. He found it \\"heaven sent\\" that they disliked each other and felt it added greatly to the dramatic conflict. The reasons for the feud appear to date back to a time when Crawford had once dated McCambridge's husband, Fletcher Markle. According to some of the other co-stars, McCambridge needled Crawford about it. McCambridge also appears to have disliked that Crawford and Ray were in the midst of an affair. Crawford, on the other hand, disliked what she perceived to be \\"special attention\\" that Ray was giving to McCambridge. Making things worse was that McCambridge was battling alcoholism during this period, something she admitted later contributed to the problems between her and Crawford.Mercedes Mccambridge: A Biography And Career Record After filming, McCambridge and Hayden publicly declared their dislike of Crawford, with McCambridge labeling Crawford, \\"a mean, tipsy, powerful, rotten-egg lady\\". Hayden said in an interview, \\"There is not enough money in Hollywood to lure me into making another picture with Joan Crawford. And I like money.\\" Crawford for her part said of McCambridge, \\"I have four children ‚Äì I do not need a fifth.\\" Later, Ray claimed that Crawford, during a rage, drunkenly threw McCambridge's costumes into the street.Interview with Nicholas Ray Crawford later laughingly admitted she had thrown McCambridge's own clothing into the street. Ray also said of that time, \\"Joan was drinking a lot and she liked to fight,\\" but that she was also \\"very attractive, with a basic decency.\\" Bette and Joan: The Divine Feud Release On September 20, 2016, Olive Films released the film on 4K Blu-Ray, Blu-Ray, and DVD as part of its lineup, Olive Signature. The release features an archival introduction from Martin Scorsese, an audio commentary from Geoff Andrews, and several featurettes. Reception=Box office During its initial theatrical run, Johnny Guitar had grossed $2.5 million in North American rentals. Critical reaction Variety commented, \\"It proves [Crawford] should leave saddles and Levis to someone else and stick to city lights for a background. [The film] is only a fair piece of entertainment. [The scriptwriter] becomes so involved with character nuances and neuroses, all wrapped up in dialogue, that [the picture] never has a chance to rear up in the saddle... The people in the story never achieve much depth, this character shallowness being at odds with the pretentious attempt at analysis to which the script and direction devotes so much time.\\" Bosley Crowther of The New York Times singled out Crawford's physical appearance, stating \\"no more femininity comes from her than from the rugged Heflin in Shane. For the lady, as usual, is as sexless as the lions on the public library steps and as sharp and romantically forbidding as a package of unwrapped razor blades.\\" He further commented that the film was no more than a \\"flat walk-through ‚Äî or occasional ride-through‚Äîof western cliches...The color is slightly awful and the Arizona scenery is only fair. Let's put it down as a fiasco. Miss Crawford went that away.\\" Harrison's Reports praised the film as \\"one of the better pictures of its type. Filmed in what is without question the best example of Trucolor photography yet shown, its mixture of romance, hatred and violence grips one's attention throughout, in spite of the fact that it is overburdened with a number of 'talky' passages. This, however, is not a serious flaw and could be corrected by some judicious cutting of the rather overlong running time.\\" Critical re- evaluation According to Martin Scorsese, contemporary American audiences \\"didn't know what to make of it, so they either ignored it or laughed at it.\\" European audiences, on the other hand, not having the same biases as American audiences, saw Johnny Guitar for what it was: \\"an intense, unconventional, stylized picture, full of ambiguities and subtexts that rendered it extremely modern.\\" During its release overseas, the film found acclaim by then-critics Jean-Luc Godard and Fran√ßois Truffaut who wrote reviews in the French film magazine Cahiers du Cin√©ma. Truffaut further described the film as the \\"Beauty and the Beast of Westerns, a Western dream\\". He was especially impressed by the film's extravagance: the bold colors, the poetry of the dialogue in certain scenes, and the theatricality which results in cowboys vanishing and dying \\"with the grace of ballerinas\\". In his 1988 release Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Spanish director Pedro Almod√≥var paid homage to the film. His lead character Pepa Marcos (Carmen Maura), a voice artist, passes out while dubbing Vienna's voice in a scene where Johnny (voiced earlier by Pepa's ex-lover Iv√°n) and Vienna banter about their conflicted past. Almod√≥var's film also ends with a chase and an obsessed woman shooting at his lead character. In 2012, Japanese film director Shinji Aoyama listed Johnny Guitar as one of the Greatest Films of All Time. He said, \\"Johnny Guitar is the only movie that I'd like to remake someday, although I know that it's impossible. It's probably closest to the worst nightmare I can have. I know for sure that my desire to remake this movie comes from my warped thought that I want to remake my own nightmare.\\" On the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 93% with an average score of 8.52/10 based on 45 critics. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Johnny Guitar confidently strides through genre conventions, emerging with a brilliant statement that transcends its period setting -- and left an indelible mark.\\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2003: AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains: ** Emma Small ‚Äì Nominated Villain * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Western Film Adaptations Johnny Guitar was adapted into a stage musical, which debuted Off-Broadway in 2004, with a book by American television producer Nicholas van Hoogstraten, lyrics by Joel Higgins, and music by Martin Silvestri and Joel Higgins.

It was published in the United States by Doubleday in January 1935. A shorter version of the novel had previously been published in the September 1934 issue of The American Magazine. The Saint in New York was the 15th book chronicling the adventures of Simon Templar (alias The Saint), an anti-hero character patterned after Robin Hood. The book is considered the most popular Saint volume. Saint expert Burl Barer in his history Saint: A Complete History in Print, Radio, Film and Television 1928‚Äì1992, indicates that The Saint in New York was the first \\"bestseller\\" of the Simon Templar series, and was the book that established Charteris as a literary celebrity in America and Britain. Due to the book's popularity, it became the first Simon Templar story to be adapted for film. Up until this point, Charteris had published at least two (sometimes more) Saint books in any given calendar year. The Saint in New York broke the pattern by being the only series entry published in 1935. Plot During a visit to Europe, Simon Templar (alias \\"The Saint\\") befriends a rich American whose son was recently murdered in New York City; the culprit went free due to police and courtroom corruption. Templar is given an offer he can't refuse: $1 million if he goes to New York and deals out his unique brand of justice to evildoers in that city. The book begins with the New York Police Department receiving a letter of warning from Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Claud Eustace Teal, indicating that Templar, after being inactive for six months (presumably since the events of The Saint Goes On), has relocated to the United States. The letter is accompanied by a dossier on Templar's career thus far (Charteris proceeds to give new readers a brief summary of past adventures dating back to the first Saint novel, 1928's Meet - The Tiger!). When an accused cop-killer is found shot to death, the NYPD knows the Saint has arrived in New York. After Templar rescues a child who has been kidnapped by a mob boss (assassinating the gangster in the process), the whole city learns that the Saint is on the job. Templar's ultimate goal is to discover the identity of the city's main kingpin who is known only as \\"The Big Fellow\\". Templar is abducted by one of the remaining crime lords and two corrupt, high-ranking New York City officials offer him $200,000 to reveal who is backing him. Templar claims to be working on his own, and the crime lord orders Templar to be taken for the proverbial \\"ride\\". Templar is taken to a remote location in New Jersey but manages to escape his fate thanks to the intervention of Fay Edwards, a beautiful young woman who happens to be a cold-blooded killer, and who claims to be working for The Big Fellow. Simon Templar and Fay Edwards fall in love with each other, in a completely Platonic way (they exchange only two kisses and exchange only a few words) which seems nevertheless very deep and poignantly emotional. (On his return to London, in the last page of the book, Templar would refuse to tell Patricia Holm about his American experiences.) The Saint eventually learns that he is being manipulated into killing off certain crime bosses in order that The Big Fellow will not have to split a $17 million cache of blood money that was going to be shared among the gangsters. In effect, rather than being a daring and idealistic vigilante, as he thought of himself, Templar finds that he had been made into a gangland hit man ‚Äì and very much dislikes to see himself in such a role. And when the Big Fellow's identity is finally revealed, he ends up being the last person Templar would suspect. Film adaptation It was this book that RKO Radio Pictures purchased and made the basis for their first Saint film, which was released in 1938. William Sistrom was the producer. Louis Hayward was cast as Simon Templar. A minor change was made to the character of Inspector Fernack; the spelling of his name was changed to Farnack and remained so for all future film appearances. In 1987, a television pilot for a potential new Saint TV series was broadcast on CBS. Entitled The Saint in Manhattan, the pilot was not directly based upon the novel but did feature the character of Inspector Farnack. Cultural references A copy of the novel The Saint in New York was featured prominently in an episode of the Canadian sitcom Corner Gas in 2004. In the episode \\"Comedy Night\\", the show's lead character, Brent Leroy, attempts to sway a local ladies' reading club away from examining Oprah's Book Club-style titles like The Life of Pi and into adventure fiction such as Don Pendleton's The Executioner and The Saint in New York. Brent compares The Saint in New York's plot with the \\"fish out of water\\" plot of The Life of Pi. According to the book Tales from Dog River: The Complete Corner Gas Guide by Michele Sponagle, the show's prop department had to obtain multiple copies of the novel for filming, but found it difficult to do so since it is out of print; they had to order copies from as far away as Florida. (Ultimately, however, only one copy of the book actually appeared on screen, specifically the 1980s reprint edition by Charter Books.) In the film Inglourious Basterds, the character Shosanna Dreyfus can be seen reading The Saint in New York while sitting in a Paris caf√©. The same book is present in a scene where Shosanna and her lover Marcel are planning to kill all the top Nazis in Chapter Five (\\"Revenge of the Giant Face\\").

Biography Born in Johannesburg, Louis Hayward lived in South Africa and was educated in France and England, including Latymer Upper School in Hammersmith, London.Latymer Upper School; A History of the School and Its Foundation, Nigel Watson He spent some time managing a night club but wanted to act and bought into a stock company. English career He became a prot√©g√© of No√´l Coward and began appearing in London in plays such as Dracula and Another Language. He was in the Sir Gerald du Maurier stage play, The Church Mouse. He started being cast in some British films of the early 1930s, such as Self Made Lady (1932) and The Man Outside (1933). He had the lead role in Chelsea Life (1933) and supporting parts in Sorrell and Son (1933), The Thirteenth Candle (1933) and I'll Stick to You (1933). He appeared in a Coward musical Conversation Piece (1934) and had the lead in The Love Test (1935), directed by Michael Powell. Move to United States Hayward came to Broadway in 1935 with a production of Coward's Point Valaine working with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne. The play, described as one of Coward's worst and poorly received critically and popularly, only ran for a short time. The play ran six weeks and was considered a failure, but Hayward won the Donaldson award, a precursor to the Tonys and as a consequence signed a four- picture contract with MGM. U.S. movie career After the debacle, however, he received an offer from MGM to play a supporting role in The Flame Within (1935), written and directed by Edmund Goulding and starring Ann Harding. Hayward followed that film with A Feather in Her Hat for Columbia, billed after Basil Rathbone. Back at MGM he had support parts in Absolute Quiet (1935) and Trouble for Two (1936). Hayward's career started to gain momentum when he was cast in the prologue of Warner Bros' expensive blockbuster Anthony Adverse (1936), playing the father of the title character. His profile also was raised by marriage to Ida Lupino. At Universal, he was the male lead in The Luckiest Girl in the World (1936) with Jane Wyatt, then he went to RKO to support Paul Muni and Miriam Hopkins in The Woman I Love (1937). Universal cast him in the lead of Midnight Intruder (1938), directed by Arthur Lubin. He also was the male lead in RKO's Condemned Women (1938). Hayward was cast as the first screen incarnation of Simon Templar in Leslie Charteris' The Saint in New York (1938) at RKO. The film was a hit and would eventually lead to a long-running series. However, the next five films in the series starred George Sanders as Templar. Hayward would eventually reprise the role in The Saint's Return in 1953. Hayward supported Danielle Darrieux and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in The Rage of Paris (1938) at Universal. Edward Small In 1938 Hayward starred in The Duke of West Point (1938) for producer Edward Small, who signed him to make three films over the next five years, meaning he was unable to reprise his part as the Saint. However, Small started building Hayward into a star, casting him in a dual role in The Man in the Iron Mask (1939) under the direction of James Whale, co-starring with Joan Bennett. The film was a notable success. Small put Hayward into My Son, My Son! (1940) with Madeleine Carroll and Brian Aherne. RKO borrowed him for Dance, Girl, Dance (1940) where he appeared with Maureen O'Hara and Lucille Ball. Small then put him in The Son of Monte Cristo (1940), another swashbuckler with Bennett and a sequel to the 1934 The Count of Monte Cristo. Hayward was loaned to Columbia to co-star with Ida Lupino in Ladies in Retirement (1941). War service During World War II, Hayward enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in July 1942.

Hayward made a thriller for Eagle Lion, Repeat Performance (1947), then did The Black Arrow Strikes (1948), another swashbuckler. Eagle Lion used him in Ruthless (1948) with Zachary Scott, then he did Walk a Crooked Mile (1948) for Small. Hayward went to Italy to make The Masked Pirate (1951) for United Artists.

William Henry Harrison. It was a staging point for Harrison to encamp his forces just prior to the Battle of Tippecanoe a month later. The fort was the site of a famous battle in the War of 1812, the siege of Fort Harrison in Sept. 1812 that was the first significant victory for the U.S. in the war. The fort was abandoned in 1818 as the frontier moved westward. Fort Harrison Background In 1811, while General William Henry Harrison marched his army north From Vincennes to meet the Indians at the Battle of Tippecanoe, the army encamped on the high grounds of Terre Haute and constructed a fort overlooking the Wabash River. Harrison had long advocated building a fort in the strategic location.Derlath, 178 The fort protected the army's supply lines, as well as the capital of the Indiana Territory downstream in Vincennes. The site, located in present-day Vigo County, Indiana, at the northern edge of Terre Haute, was only two miles from the Wea village of Weauteno. It was said to be the location of a historic battle involving the Illiniwek, and was initially called Camp Bataille des Illinois.McCormick, 17 Major Joseph Hamilton Daveiss proposed that the stockade be named Fort Harrison in General Harrison's honor. The fort was finished October 28, 1811, and had a stockade encircling the post. Leaving the fort and a small garrison under Colonel James Miller, Harrison led his army to the Tippecanoe battleground, where it confronted an army led by the Shawnee prophet, Tenskwatawa. When the army returned, Harrison left Captain Josiah Snelling in command of Fort Harrison, in reward for his performance at Tippecanoe. Snelling served as commandant of the fort from November 11, 1811 until . During that winter, the fort was shaken by the 1811‚Äì12 New Madrid earthquakes. Snelling was later transferred to Fort Detroit. After the outbreak of the War of 1812, Captain Zachary Taylor, future President of the United States, was ordered by Harrison to leave Fort Knox and assume command of Fort Harrison.Allison, 181 The United States had suffered a series of defeats immediately after war was declared, at the hands of the British, Canadians, and Indians. These victories helped motivate other native tribes to take up campaigns against remote American outposts. Siege of Fort Harrison The Siege of Fort Harrison was an engagement that lasted from September 4 to 12, 1812. it was won by an outnumbered United States force garrisoned inside the fort against a combined Native American force near modern Terre Haute, Indiana. It was the first American land victory during the War of 1812. On September 3, 1812, a band of Miami arrived and warned Captain Taylor that they would soon be attacked by a large force of Native Americans.Allison, 182 That evening, shots were heard, but Taylor was hesitant to send out a scout party. He only had 50 men in his garrison, and sickness had reduced the number of effective soldiers to only 15. In the morning, a party was dispatched and discovered the bodies of two white settlers, the Doyle brothers. The brothers were buried, and the party reported back to Fort Harrison. Captain Taylor, with his 15 able soldiers and about 5 healthy settlers, made ready for the expected attack. Each of the 20 men was issued sixteen rounds to fire.Allison, 183 That day, September 4, a force of 600 Potawatomi (under Chief Pa-koi-shee- can),Allison, 185 Wea (under War Chief Stone Eater), Shawnee, Kickapoo and Winnebago warriors approached Fort Harrison. A party of 40 men under command of Kickapoo Chief Namahtoha approached under a flag of truce and asked to parley with Taylor the next morning. Taylor agreed, and the Indian force retreated to camp for the night. right That night, a warrior crawled up and set the blockhouse on fire. When the sentries opened fire on the arsonist, the 600-strong Indian war party attacked the west side of the fort. Taylor ordered the fort's surgeon and a handful of defenders to control the fire. The blockhouse, which was attached to the barracks, had a store of whiskey, which soon ignited, and the fire raged out of control. Taylor admitted in his report that the situation looked hopeless, and two of his healthy men fled the fort.Allison, 184, 187. One of the men later returned to the fort with a broken arm. The other was found dead. Warning the fort that \\"Taylor never surrenders!\\", the captain organized a bucket brigadeKaufmann, 160 to fight the fire before it destroyed the fort's picket walls. One woman, Julia Lambert, even lowered herself down into the fort's well to fill buckets more quickly. The fire did serve one purpose, in that it illuminated the night, revealing the attackers. The fire left a gap in the outer wall, which the garrison temporarily sealed with a breastwork. The remaining few of the garrison returned the fire of the Indians so fiercely that they were able to hold off the attack. All remaining invalids were armed to maintain defense, while healthy men were put to work repairing the hole left in the fort's walls. The fort was repaired by daybreak of September 5. The Indian force withdrew just beyond gun range and butchered area farm animals within sight of the fort. The garrison and settlers inside the fort, meanwhile, had lost most of their food in the fire, had only a few bushels of corn, and faced starvation.Allison, 186 right News of the siege arrived in Vincennes as Colonel William Russell was passing through with a company of regular infantry and a company of rangers, on their way to join Ninian Edwards, governor of Illinois Territory.Derleth, 182 Colonel Russell's companies joined with the local militia and 7th Infantry Regiment and marched to the relief of Fort Harrison. Over 1000 men arrived from Vincennes on September 12, and the Indian force departed. The next day, however, a supply train following Colonel Russell was attacked in what became known as the Attack at the Narrows in modern Sullivan County, Indiana. Attacks at the Narrows Following the relief army to Fort Harrison was a party of thirteen soldiers under Lieutenant Fairbanks of the Seventh Infantry escorting a supply wagon loaded with flour and meat. On September 13, 1812, the supply wagon was ambushed by a Potawatomi war party at a section of the trail known as The Narrows, an area near modern Fairbanks, Indiana, which has many ravines that serve as tributaries to Prairie Creek.Allison, 188 When the ambush was launched, the draft horses panicked and ran away with the wagon. Only two men ‚Äì the wagoneer, John Black, and Private Edward Perdue ‚Äì managed to escape back to Fort Knox alive, although Perdue was discharged due to the severe wounds he received.Allison, 189 Luckily for the two survivors, the Potawatomi gave chase to the runaway supply wagon. Eleven soldiers and all the provisions were lost to the United States,Dunn, 142 and several Potawatomi warriors had been killed or wounded.Allison, 190 A second column of two supply wagons and fifteen soldiers under Lieutenant Richardson set out from Vincennes two days after the first wagon, following the same trail, and unaware of the fate of the first. When the Potawatomi learned that a second supply train was approaching, they set up the same ambush. On September 15, after the initial attack, Richardson realized he was out-manned, and ordered a retreat. The wagons were left behind to be plundered, which may have saved the lives of the retreating soldiers. Even so, seven men had been killed, and another had been badly wounded. A battalion under Major McGary discovered the bodies a few days later, and proceeded to Fort Harrison to inform Colonel Russell of the attacks and ‚Äì more importantly to the half-starved survivors at Fort Harrison ‚Äì the missing supply wagons.Allison, 191 The Potawatomi party left the Narrows, and attacked the house of a settler named Issac Hutson on September 16, in what became known as the Lamotte Prairie Massacre. Hutson was away, but his wife and four children were all killed. Aftermath Fort Harrison March,\\" a campaign song for Zachary Taylor's successful 1848 presidential campaignLibrary of Congress The Battle of Fort Harrison is considered the first land victory of the United States during the War of 1812. The same day, Gen. Harrison's forces relieved Fort Wayne, which eliminated the last Indian threat to Indiana Territory for the remainder of the war. In retaliation for the attack on Fort Harrison and the Pigeon Roost Massacre, Colonel Russell continued on to Illinois with the Indiana Rangers and led an expedition against the Kickapoo on Peoria Lake. For his services at Fort Harrison, Zachary Taylor received a brevet promotion to major. The fort was rebuilt in 1815/16 with a blockhouse at each corner, and abandoned in 1818 after peace was established in Indiana territory. Since both William Henry Harrison and Zachary Taylor commanded Fort Harrison, Indiana historians later referred to it as \\"The Fort of Two Presidents.\\" In 1970, the cemetery of the fort was discovered 200 yards south of where the fort was believed to have been sited. Many years after the battle, a man found Lieutenant Fairbanks' sword stuck in a log. It was given to the Indiana State Museum. Two active infantry battalions of the Regular Army (1-1 Inf and 2-1 Inf) perpetuate the lineages of detachments the old 7th Infantry that were at the Siege of Fort Harrison.

It marks the second cinematic incarnation of the antihero crimefighting character Simon Templar, alias \\"The Saint\\". George Sanders replaced Louis Hayward, who had played the Saint in The Saint in New York. The movie was produced by RKO and also featured Wendy Barrie as female gang leader Val Travers. Barrie would appear in two more Saint films, playing different roles each time, though not in the next film in the series, The Saint in London. This was the second of eight films in RKO's film series about The Saint. In the film The Saint foils an assassination attempt by a member of Val Travers' gang, but is arrested by the police for the murder of the gang member. He persuades them to let him assist in apprehending a shadowy criminal mastermind. The script was based on the Leslie Charteris novel She Was a Lady (Hodder and Stoughton, 1931) which was also published as Angels of Doom and The Saint Meets His Match. The screenplay was by John Twist, who set the story in San Francisco (the book is set in England). Robert Sisk produced and John Farrow directed. Plot While dancing at a New Year's party, the Saint spots an agent of Valerie Travers preparing to shoot someone, so Templar guns him down first at the stroke of midnight. Templar is placed by witnesses at the scene, so the San Francisco police request the assistance of Inspector Henry Fernack (Jonathan Hale) of the NYPD. Before Fernack can leave, the Saint arrives in New York and accompanies him to the West Coast. Travers' father had been a police inspector whose efficiency caused trouble for a mysterious criminal mastermind named Waldeman. When a large sum of money was found in his safe deposit box, however, he was fired on suspicion of working for Waldeman and committed suicide. Travers is determined to clear his name by any means necessary. The Saint takes up her cause, despite her hostility for his interference in her plans and her suspicions about his motives. Templar gets the cooperation of the police commissioner, over the objections of Chief Inspector Webster and criminologist Cullis, who wonder if the Saint is Waldeman himself. Templar and Travers cross paths again when the trail leads to Martin Eastman, a noted philanthropist and seemingly-irreproachable citizen, whom they both suspect is linked to Waldeman in some way. Templar forces Travers and her gang to drive away, all except her burglar, Zipper Dyson. Templar gets Dyson to open Eastman's safe and takes the money inside. The serial numbers confirm that it was stolen in a robbery perpetrated by Waldeman. When Eastman contacts Cullis instead of reporting the theft, Templar knows that Cullis is also working for Waldeman. With that information, not only does the Saint exonerate Travers' father, he also identifies Waldeman.

In July 1938 they announced they would make the second in the series, The Saint Strikes Twice. A.C. Edington was assigned to write the script and Louis Hayward was announced as star with filming to start in August 1938. Hayward was reluctant to reprise his role and was not under contract to RKO. He had just played the lead in The Duke of West Point (1938) and wanted assurances the new film would be more of an \\"A\\" movie. Hayward ended up signing a long-term contract with Edward Small and making The Man in the Iron Mask (1939). RKO ended up casting George Sanders, who they borrowed from 20th Century Fox. The title was changed to The Saint Strikes Back and it was to be made alongside The Saint in London. John Farrow was assigned to direct in December 1938. The script was written by John Twist.

Early life Abel was born in 1969 in Chicago, Illinois,Biography page at Jessica Abel's official site and raised in the Chicago metropolitan area. She graduated from Evanston Township High School. She attended Carleton College for in 1987‚Äì88, and then transferred to the University of Chicago, where she published her first comics work in 1988, in the student anthology Breakdown. Additionally, she worked for three years in the administration at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She graduated with a BA degree. Career Abel at Delcourt Festival in Paris, France in 2006 Abel started in the world of minicomics, self-publishing the photocopied, hand-sewn and embellished comic book Artbabe in 1992; four annual issues followed, with Abel having won a Xeric Foundation grant to self-publish and distribute issue #5. This was the first professionally printed Artbabe, and was subtitled The Four Seasons. She appeared as a character in the back-cover story of Hate #10 (Fall 1992) by Peter Bagge. Abel has stated that her major work Artbabe is not autobiographical. With the publication of the Xeric issue of Artbabe, Abel came to the attention of Fantagraphics publisher Gary Groth, who offered to publish Artbabe. Each issue of Artbabe contained one or more complete stories; Abel did not begin any longer sequential work until La Perdida in 2000. The character Artbabe, who appears on every cover, does not actually appear in any of the stories. In 1998, Abel moved to Mexico City with her boyfriend, now husband, comics artist Matt Madden. She went on hiatus from Artbabe in 1999. From 1996‚Äì2005, Abel did a series of one-page journalistic comics for the University of Chicago Magazine, and also embarked on Radio: an Illustrated Guide for the radio program This American Life. This book depicted how an episode of the show is made, with behind-the-scenes reportage and a how-to guide to creating a radio show at home. After two years in Mexico City, Abel moved to Brooklyn, New York. Abel created the five-issue, 250-page series La Perdida. Published by Fantagraphics Books between 2000 and 2005 as a five-part mini-series. Abel revised the text for its compilation and publication in 2006 as a hardcover volume by Pantheon Books. The book has received a positive critical response. The central character is a Mexican-American woman, Carla, raised by her Anglo mother, who moves on a whim to Mexico City to search for her identity. Abel taught an undergraduate cartooning courses at the School of Visual Arts for a number of years, and gave workshops at other locations, such as Ox-Bow Summer School of Art. In 2008, Abel and Madden produced Drawing Words and Writing Pictures for First Second Books. The book is a product of the years Abel and Madden have spent as teachers, and is a comprehensive manual on creating comics. That same year, Abel also collaborated on Life Sucks, written with Gabe Soria and Warren Pleece. Abel and Madden produced a second comics teaching textbook together called Mastering Comics, a sequel to Drawing Words and Writing Pictures, published in May 2012. Abel and Madden then both moved to France for a one-year artists‚Äô residency at La Maison des Auteurs in Angoul√™me in 2012, that became an extended 4-year stay. In 2015, Abel published a sequel to her 1999 comic Radio: An Illustrated Guide called \\"Out On The Wire: The Storytelling Secrets of the New Masters of Radio\\". On June 7, 2016 Abel announced that she was returning to the United States to accept a position as chair of the brand-new illustration department at PAFA, The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Exhibitions Abel's one-person exhibitions include \\"Corridoio Altervox\\" in Rome, the Phoenix Gallery in Brighton; the Oporto International Comics Festival in Portugal, Vi√±etas desde o Atl√°ntico in A Coruna, Spain, and the Naples Comicon.

Politics and feminism in her work  Abel affirmed during an interview on Swedish TV with her partner Matt Madden and Fredrik Str√∂mberg that she, and her work is \\"implicitly feminist, but not explicitly political\\". Her stories tend to depict the lives of female and minority characters including at times aspects that could be considered political, but she seldom goes out of her way to make that the main thrust of the work, treating it instead as simply a natural aspect of life.

In the film, a doddering vampire hunter and his bumbling assistant travel to a small mountain village where they find the tell-tale traces of vampirism. The assistant becomes enchanted by the local tavern keeper's daughter, before she is promptly abducted. Determined to save the buxom maiden, they confront the undead Count in his castle. The film has been adapted into a musical, Dance of the Vampires (first adapted in German under the translated title \\"Tanz der Vampire\\"). Plot The film is set \\"deep in the heart of Transylvania\\" and the story appears to take place sometime during the mid-19th century. Professor Abronsius, formerly of the University of K√∂nigsberg, and his apprentice Alfred are on the hunt for vampires. Abronsius is old and withering and barely able to survive the cold ride through the wintry forests, while Alfred is bumbling and introverted. The two hunters come to a small village seemingly at the end of a long search for signs of vampires. The two stay at a local inn full of angst-ridden townspeople who perform strange rituals to fend off an unseen evil. While staying at the inn, Alfred develops a fondness for Sarah, the overprotected daughter of the tavern keeper Yoine Shagal. Alfred witnesses Sarah being kidnapped by the local vampire lord Count von Krolock. Crazed with grief and armed only with a bunch of garlic, Shagal attempts to rescue her but does not get very far before he is captured, drained of his blood and vampirised. After Shagal rises and attacks Magda, the tavern's beautiful maidservant and the object of his lust when he was still human, Abronsius and Alfred follow his trail in the snow, which leads them to Krolock's ominous castle in the snow- blanketed hills nearby. They break into the castle but are trapped by the Count's hunchbacked servant, Koukol. They are taken to see the Count, who affects an air of aristocratic dignity while questioning Abronsius about why he has come to the castle. They also encounter the Count's son, the foppish (and homosexual) Herbert. Meanwhile, Shagal, no longer caring about his daughter's fate, sets up his plan to turn Magda into his vampire bride. Despite misgivings, Abronsius and Alfred accept the Count's invitation to stay in his ramshackle Gothic castle, where Alfred spends the night fitfully. The next morning, Abronsius plans to find the castle crypt and destroy the Count by staking him in the heart, seemingly forgetting about the fate of Sarah. The crypt is guarded by the hunchback, so after some wandering they attempt to climb in through a roof window. However, Abronsius gets stuck in the aperture, and it falls to Alfred to complete the task of killing the Count in his slumber. At the last moment his nerve fails him and he cannot accomplish the deed. Alfred then has to go back outside to free Abronsius, but on the way he comes upon Sarah having a bath in her room. She seems oblivious to her danger when he pleads for her to come away with him, and informs him that a ball is to take place this very night. After briefly taking his eyes off her, Alfred turns to find Sarah has vanished into thin air. After freeing Abronsius, who is half-frozen, they re-enter the castle. Alfred again seeks Sarah but meets Herbert instead, who first attempts to seduce him, and then, after Alfred realizes that Herbert's reflection does not show up in the mirror, reveals his vampire nature and attempts to bite him. Abronsius and Alfred flee from Herbert through a dark stairway to safety, only to be trapped behind a locked door in a turret. As night is falling, they become horrified witnesses as the graves below open up to reveal a huge number of vampires of various past centuries at the castle, who hibernate and meet once a year only to feast upon any captives the Count has provided for them. The Count appears, mocking them and tells them their fate is sealed. He leaves them to attend the ball, where Sarah will be presented as the next vampire victim. The hunters escape by firing a cannon at the door‚Äîsubstituting steam pressure for gunpowder‚Äîand come to the ball in disguise, where, although exposed by their reflections in a huge mirror, they are able to grab Sarah and escape. Fleeing in a horse-drawn sleigh, Abronsius and Alfred are unaware that it is too late for Sarah, who has already been transformed into a vampire. She awakens in mid-flight as a vampire and bites Alfred, thus allowing vampires to be released into the world.

The fact that we were filming in Italy entailed the employment of a certain number of Italian technicians and that, in turn bred some international friction. Gene Gutowski (the film's European producer) rightly suspected that the Italians were robbing us blind.\\"Hallenbeck 2009: 83 Cinematographer Douglas Slocombe said: \\"I think he (Roman) put more of himself into Dance of the Vampires than into any other film. It brought to light the fairy-tale interest that he has. One was conscious all along when making the picture of a Central European background to the story. Very few of the crew could see anything in it‚Äîthey thought it old-fashioned nonsense. But I could see this background....I have a French background myself and could sense the Central European atmosphere that surrounds it. The figure of Alfred is very much like Roman himself‚Äîa slight figure, young and a little defenseless‚Äîa touch of Kafka. It is very much a personal statement of his own humor as he used to chuckle all the way through the scenes.\\" This film was the source material for the European stage musical Tanz der Vampire. It is peppered with numerous references to King Richard III of England, who even appears in the ball scene. When the film was first released in the United States, MGM wanted to market it as a \\"farce\\". MGM Head Editor Margaret Booth and Head of Theatrical Post Production Merle Chamberlain cut 12 minutes' worth of material, and along with adding the animated prologue among other changes, the character of Professor Abronsius was re dubbed to give him a goofy, cartoony voice that would suit the \\"kooky\\" tone of the film. This version was slightly retitled as The Fearless Vampire Killers, or Pardon Me, But Your Teeth Are in My Neck. This was the version most commonly seen in the U.S. until it vanished from circulation in the mid-1970s. In the early 1980s, MGM unearthed a print of Roman Polanski's original cut and sent it to various repertory & revival houses for screenings. Polanski's cut has garnered new interest and reevaluated opinions from critics and fans of Polanski's works, who have previously bashed the film in its mutilated U.S. cut. Since then, the original version of the film is the one more commonly available today and has been released on VHS, LaserDisc, DVD and Blu-ray, and occasionally airs on TCM. Style and themes The Fearless Vampire Killers was Polanski's first feature to be photographed in color using a widescreen 2.35:1 aspect ratio. The film is also notable in that it features Polanski's love of winter sports, particularly skiing. Animated opening sequence= USA  The sequence begins on a sunny day where a bird is minding his own business when the sun behind him sinks and the crescent moon rises in its place, starting night. The bird becomes alarmed and speeds away. Zooming out, the camera reveals the setting of a graveyard where Professor Abronsius and Alfred bump into each other. The two shake hands and a green vampire pops out from a grave behind them. After the successful scare, the vampire laughs as the camera zooms in on him. This process is repeated twice. A bag falls from the sky; Abronsius reaches in and takes out a box containing garlic, which he and Alfred eat. They sneak up to the vampire (who has no idea where they are), tap his shoulder and breathe garlic breath on him, causing him to shrink and run off. The bag drops to them again and Alfred brings out a gold crucifix and gives it to Abronsius. They sneak up on the now plugged-nose vampire, show him the crucifix, and again he shrinks and run off. He hides behind the tree and tries to scare them again, but the sun replaces the moon, signaling the vampire to run, and Abronsius and Alfred chase him to a coffin. The bag appears one last time and Abronsius takes out a mallet and a wooden stake. With Alfred's help he kills the vampire, then places the lid on the coffin. In the pitch-black backdrop Professor Abronsius and Alfred congratulate each other until the MGM logo appears, startling them. The lion in the logo roars as its fangs grow longer. Frightened, Abronsius and Alfred run away, and blood drips out of the lion's mouth.  UK  The comedy mask disappears and the MGM lion turns into a cartoon vampire with blood dripping from its mouth in the logo. Soundtrack The score was provided by Krzysztof Komeda, who also scored Rosemary's Baby. Reception The Fearless Vampire Killers holds an approval rating of 69% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: \\"This uneven but amiable 1967 vampire picture is part horror spoof, part central European epic, and 100 percent Roman Polanski, whose signature sensibility colors every frame.\\" DVD The Fearless Vampire Killers was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on September 13, 2005 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD, and later in other territories. This version of the film is Roman Polanski's original cut bearing \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers\\" title card. There is a region-free Brazilian DVD by Cinemagia that, while using a dated 4:3 letterbox master of the original cut, has the U.S. prologue as an extra. Outside of 16 mm or 35 mm prints, no known official releases of the re-edited U.S. cut exist. Blu-ray release The film, using the same version as the 2005 DVD, was released by Warner Home Video in France on December 20, 2013. This Blu-ray is locked to Region B and does not play on most North American Blu-ray players. In September 2019, Warner Archive announced a U.S. Blu-ray for The Fearless Vampire Killers. Released two months later, it utilizes a new 2019 HD re- master of Polanski's original cut, along with the extras from the DVD release and the addition of the U.S. animated prologue.

Founded by Semie Moseley, Mosrite guitars were played by many rock and roll and country artists. Mosrite guitars were known for innovative design, high-quality engineering, very thin, low-fretted and narrow necks, and extremely hot (high output) pickups. Moseley's design for The Ventures, known as the \\"Ventures Model\\" (later known as the \\"Mark I\\") was generally considered to be the flagship of the line. Mosrite also made a very limited number of acoustic guitars that are somewhat rare. They are the Serenade and Balladere models. The Balladere models were made between 1968‚Äì1969, while the Serenade was an earlier model made between 1965-1969. History=Apprenticeship In Bakersfield, Semie Moseley started playing guitar in an evangelical group at age 13.Thompson, Art, \\"Mosrite 40th Anniversary\\", Guitar Player magazine, January 2007. Semie and his brother Andy experimented with guitars from their teen-age years, refinishing instruments and building new necks.Price, Robert, \\"The Man Behind the Mosrite\\" (archived 2008 copy), The Bakersfield Californian. Has biographical notes on Semie Moseley. Semie Moseley began building guitars in the Los Angeles area around 1952 or 1953. He began by apprenticing at the Rickenbacker factory, where he learned much of his guitar making skills from Roger Rossmeisl, a German immigrant who brought old-world luthier techniques into the modern electric guitar manufacturing process. One of the most recognizable features on most Mosrite guitars is the \\"German Carve\\" on the top that Moseley learned from Rossmeisl. During the same time, Moseley apprenticed with Paul Bigsby in Downey, California, the man who made the first modern solid-body guitar for Merle Travis in 1948, and who invented the Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, which is still used today. Mosrite founded In 1954, Semie built a triple-neck guitar in his garage (the longest neck was a standard guitar, the second-longest neck an octave higher, the shortest was an eight-string mandolin.) He presented a double-neck to Joe Maphis, a Los Angeles-area TV performer of country music. By 1956, with an investment from Ray Boatright, a local Los Angeles Foursquare Gospel minister, Semie and Andy started their company, Mosrite of California. In gratitude to Reverend Boatright, Moseley named the company by combining his and Boatright's last names; the name is properly pronounced MOZE-rite, based on the pronunciation Semie Moseley used for his own name. Semie, who built guitars for the L.A.-based Rickenbacker company, said to his co-workers that he was making his own product, and he was fired by Rickenbacker. Joe Maphis's double-neck by Mosrite When they began, their production was all custom, handmade guitars, built in garages, tin storage sheds, wherever the Moseleys could put equipment. In 1959, Andy moved to Nashville, Tennessee, for a year to popularize the Mosrite name and sold a few, including to Grand Ole Opry entertainers and road musicians. Andy said: \\"And that‚Äôs how we kept the factory going at the time: custom guitars\\". Moseley made guitars in Los Angeles until 1959, when he moved to Oildale, California, just north of Bakersfield. In 1962, he moved his shop to Panama Lane where he designed and produced the first Joe Maphis model guitars, one model of which would eventually evolve into the \\"Ventures model\\" guitar and bass (Joe Maphis would later get a model of his own, similar to a Mosrite Combo model but without the F-hole). At this time, Mosrite made everything in-house, except for the tuners. Mosrite pickups after the 50s usually came in several ways through Mosrite's history, none with metal casing; 1: the large single coil similar to (but not as long as) a P90, 2: a cheaper version of the first pickup that showed on cheaper models (Celebrity III, Mark V,) 3: a cheaper pickup only found on the first iteration of the Ventures II and 4: a Mosrite Humbucker mostly found on some 1970s models. The full \\"The Ventures\\" line consisted of the Mark I, Ventures II (of several versions,) Mark V, Mark X (bass) and Mark XII (12 string). \\"The Ventures\\" line started in 1963 and ran through 1967 when the licensing agreement with The Ventures ended. At the peak of production, in 1968, Mosrite was making around 600 guitars per month. Bankruptcy and restart Mosrite of California went bankrupt in late 1968 after they contracted with the Thomas Organ Company to market their guitars. After this, they tried to deal directly with stores, and they sold 280 guitars in 1969 before they came to the shop one day in February and found their doors pad- locked. Two years after his bankruptcy, Semie was able to get back the Mosrite name, and in 1970 he started making guitars again in Pumpkin Center near Bakersfield. He moved his factory three times in the next 20 years, to Oklahoma City in the mid-1970s, to the township of Jonas Ridge, in Burke County, North Carolina, in 1981 (where a factory fire destroyed the operation,) and to Leachville, Arkansas, in 1991. Only one guitar was produced in Leachville and is now on display at the town's Melody Theater. Though an acknowledged genius at guitar design and construction, Moseley lacked many basic skills necessary to be a good businessman, and thus the company fell on hard times repeatedly in the late 1960s and 1970s, but continued to produce Mosrite guitars until 1993 in North Carolina and Arkansas. Most of them were exported to Japan, where their popularity remained very strong. The quality of the instruments always remained very respectable. Semie Moseley died in 1992. His wife Loretta continued to produce Mosrites a year or so after his death, and since 2008 has been selling custom Mosrites via their website. The company now has recently released the Semie Moseley Model '63 and '65, based on the Ventures models made in those two years. Both models are made to the exact specifications as the original models; they are 100 % hand-made and were created to commemorate Semie Moseley. Semie's daughter, Dana Moseley, is also a luthier and continues to build Mosrite guitars. She also helps kick off the monthly \\"Mosrite Jam\\" in Bakersfield.Munoz, Matt, \\"Mos-rite-teous! Lovers of Bakersfield guitar ready to jam\\" , Bakotopia.com, Wednesday, Feb 17 2010 List of models Note that there are exceptions to this list of models where perhaps a 1960s model has white paint for the headstock logos or a 1970s 350 model has a basswood body and maple neck instead of a mahogany body and mahogany neck. Mosrite is a company where outliers aren't unheard of. Mosrite also used other names occasionally; \\"Gospel\\" was often a name associated with guitars given away to churches although it was also used during Mosrite's bankruptcy period when they didn't have their Mosrite name (1969‚Äì1970,) Semie also used his last name \\"Moseley\\" for guitars built during the same period. 1950s :* One double neck guitar built for Joe Maphis, :* A triple-neck guitar built for Semie Moseley personally, :More various guitars though none in commercial production. 1960s ;Pre-1963: :* Joe Maphis model -- Same general body shape as the later Ventures model; This was to be Joe Maphis' model before Semie Moseley and The Ventures settled on a contract and the body shape became the Ventures model. This is not the same as the later Joe Maphis model which is similar to the Combo model. ;1963‚Äì1968: :* The Ventures Model -- Also came as a bass and later on, A 12-string. Post Ventures, 1968 and 1969 it was named the \\"Mark I\\". The first Ventures Models came with a set neck, bound body and a large Ventures and Mosrite logo, less than 250 of these were made before settling on the standard Ventures Model sometime in 1964, without body binding and the neck became bolt on. The Mosrite logo and Ventures model logo were slightly reduced. :* Ventures Bass (AKA \\"Mark X\\") :* Mark XII Twelve-String Guitar -- Most of these have stoptails although some have tremolos. ;1965: :* The Ventures II (\\"Slab Body\\" Type) Model -- Only built as a six-string guitar in 1965. Production started in mid-1965 and ended several months later with small production numbers not exceeding 150 (possibly under 100.) This Slab Body Model was replaced with the second Ventures II design, reportedly because Semie Moseley was disappointed in this original design, thinking it looked too cheap for Mosrite. The \\"Slab Body\\" name is not official, it was coined by Mosrite enthusiasts to differentiate the two Ventures II guitars. This Ventures \\"Slab Body\\" is the model that Johnny Ramone of the Ramones was mostly known to play. ;1965‚Äì1966: :* The Ventures II (German Carve Body Type) Model -- Replaced the earlier Ventures II; Same body design as the Mark V model. Only came as a six-string guitar. Some of these, mostly earlier models with a few exceptions, have longer pickguards than later models; the neck pickup on the long pickguard models is slightly farther from the bridge, possibly to utilize older shorter Ventures II \\"Slab Body\\" necks. Re-named the \\"Ventures Mark V\\" in 1966. The \\"Ventures II German Carve\\" name is not official, it was coined by Mosrite enthusiasts to differentiate the two Ventures II guitars. ;1965‚Äì1968/1969: :* Joe Maphis models -- These are similar in body shape to the later Combo model without F-holes and are painted in a natural finish.

Durabrand is a private label tradename of Walmart which was introduced in early 1999. It is currently available in the UK through ASDA, where it was previously known as Pacific. Introduction Durabrand was first started in early 1999 as a brand only made for Wal-Mart stores as a generic brand for electronics, but has grown to be available near-internationally (due to Wal-Mart's global reach). Wal-Mart Germany was the first country to introduce the private label with a lineup in Consumer Electronics. Responsible for the first launch in 1999 were Uwe Bremeyer (Senior Buyer Dept. 5) and Michael Werry (Buyer Dept. 5), since 2002 Martin Schulz (Senior Buyer Dept. 5) & Frank Mades (Divisional Merchandise Manager Electronics) for Wal-Mart Germany. The very first product launched was a 120 min Videocassette produced at RAKS in Manisa (Turkey). The products are marked for only Wal-Mart stores and available in very few other stores than Wal-Mart. Like most generic brands, Durabrand is a chain of different manufacturers. Durabrand is chained with Lenoxx Sound, Alco, Funai (which would also include Emerson, Sylvania, and Symphonic), Orion, Maxell, Resonance, Initial Technology, and many other different companies. The prices of a majority of their products are often considered loss leaders. Durabrand does have some \\"company rivals,\\" despite the low prices, their products are matched up between other in-house brands like Wal-Mart's iLo brand (considered as an upmarket brand, offers MP3 digital audio players and plasma video displays), Target's TruTech brand; and to an extent, K-Mart's former Curtis Mathes/White-Westinghouse (in the mid-to-late 1990s) now Home Essentials brand. Due to the fact that all of these are store brands, the stores are often competitive to get buyers to their store brand. Aside from store brands, Durabrand is matched up to Coby Electronics, Jwin, GPX, and other low-cost electronics brands. Durabrand offers audio equipment (CD players, alarm clocks, boomboxes, theater systems) and video equipment (VCRs, DVD players, televisions). However, it has also been lately focused on home appliances such as kitchen equipment, telephones, vacuums, and other general home appliances. Products * Media (CD-R, CD-RW, DVD-R, DVD-RW, and blank VHS tapes) * VCRs * Home minisystems and home-theater-in-a-box systems * Boomboxes: Durabrand sells a variety of boomboxes. The offerings range from an AM/FM radio with a single-deck cassette player to models featuring CD players and some models with MP3-CD compatibility. * CD players (with and without ESP): Durabrand has variety in portable CD players. Ranging from the basic models without anti-skip protection to models with a built in radio tuner, MP3 CD compatibility, or come supplied with a car kit - consisting of a 12 Volt DC adapter and signal-to-cassette adapter. * DVD Players: There are three different types of DVD player that Durabrand sells. One type is the component DVD player that is connects to a TV with A/V inputs (due to being a fire hazard, this product was recalled on August 20, 2009). Another design is a clamshell design portable DVD player (similar to a notebook computer). And a car DVD player \\"system\\" that can have up to two screens mounted on rear seats. * Televisions: Durabrand used to sell monochrome portable televisions (sourced from Lenoxx Electronics Corporation) but now can only be purchased under the Lenoxx Sound name. Durabrand currently sells moderately sized color televisions (13-inch to 27-inch) manufactured by Funai Electric. * Home Appliances: Home appliances include vacuums, hand mixers, coffee makers, wine coolers and other general home equipment. * Telephones: Basic models, models with Caller ID and answering systems. * Car audio: speakers and sets * Computer speakers * Coffee makers * Two-way radios * Cordless Vacuum Cleaners Brand identification A large D is often found on the front of their products.

The movie is a sequel to Lang's silent film Dr. Mabuse the Gambler (1922) and features many cast and crew members from Lang's previous films. The film features Rudolf Klein-Rogge as Dr. Mabuse who is in an insane asylum where he is found frantically writing his crime plans. When Mabuse's criminal plans begin to be implemented, Inspector Lohmann (played by Otto Wernicke) tries to find the solution with clues from gangster Thomas Kent (Gustav Diessl), the institutionalized Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) and Professor Baum (Oscar Beregi Sr.) who becomes obsessed with Dr. Mabuse. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was based on elements of author Norbert Jacques' unfinished novel Mabuse's Colony. It was Lang's second sound film for Nero-Film and was his final collaboration with his wife and screenwriter Thea von Harbou. To promote the film to a foreign market, a French-language version of the film was made by Lang with the same sets but different actors with the title Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse. According to Siegfried Kracauer, Lang deliberately intended the film to suggest the Mabuse- like qualities of Adolf Hitler, who was on his rise to become Chancellor of Germany while the film was being written. When Hitler came to power, Joseph Goebbels became Minister of Propaganda and banned the film in Germany, suggesting that the film would undermine the audience's confidence in its statesmen. The French-language and German-language versions of the film were released in Europe while several versions of the film were released in the United States to mixed reception with each re-release. The sequel The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse (1960) was also directed by Lang. Modern reception of the film is favorable with critics, while the film has influenced filmmakers including Claude Chabrol and Artur Brauner. Plot In a noisy print shop, a disgraced police detective named Hofmeister (Karl Meixner) escapes from pursuing criminals' attacks. Hofmeister telephones his former superior Inspector Karl Lohmann (Otto Wernicke) and explains frantically that he has discovered a huge criminal conspiracy. Before he can disclose the identity of the responsible criminal, the lights go out, shots are fired, and Hofmeister becomes mad. Hofmeister vanishes only to be found later singing every time he feels watched, and he is institutionalized at the asylum run by Professor Baum (Oscar Beregi Sr.). Professor Baum introduces the case of Dr. Mabuse (Rudolf Klein-Rogge), the criminal mastermind and hypnotist who ten years earlier went mad. Mabuse spends his days frantically writing detailed plans for crimes while a criminal gang is committing them according to \\"the plans of the Doctor\\", with whom they confer only from behind a curtain. When Baum's colleague Dr. Kramm (Theodor Loos) by chance discovers that recent crimes implement Mabuse's writings, Kramm is shot by the gang's execution squad, Hardy (Rudolf Sch√ºndler) and Bredow (Oskar H√∂cker). A clue scratched in a glass window pane at Hofmeister's crime scene causes Lohmann to suspect Mabuse. On arrival at the asylum, Baum reveals that Mabuse has died. When Lohmann disparagingly talks about \\"Mabuse the criminal\\", Baum emphatically speaks about \\"Mabuse the genius\\", whose brilliance would have destroyed a corrupt world. Baum continues to study Mabuse's writings and communes with the ghost of Dr. Mabuse. The spirit of Mabuse speaks about an \\"unlimited reign of crime\\" and merges with the Professor's silhouette. During the same night, a hidden figure confers with sections of his organisation, preparing various crimes such as an attack on a chemical plant, robbing a bank, counterfeiting, poisoning water and destroying harvests. One of the gang members, Thomas Kent (Gustav Diesel), is conflicted between his criminal work, which he needs to do for money, and his affection for a young woman named Lilli (Wera Liessem). Lilli, devoted to Kent, begs him to confide in her. Kent finally confesses his past and his current situation to her. The two decide to inform the police but are abducted and locked in the strange meeting room with the curtain. The hidden figure announces their death when they discover that the curtained alcove contains only a loudspeaker and that there is a time bomb. After several escape attempts have failed, they flood the place to lessen the impact of the explosion and break free when the time bomb goes off. Meanwhile, the police are besieging a flat where several gangsters, including Hardy and Bredow, are staying. After a shootout, Hardy commits suicide while the other gangsters surrender. As Bredow testifies that they assassinated Dr. Kramm in the vicinity of the asylum, Lohmann arranges a confrontation between the gangsters and the Professor, which proves inconclusive. On Kent and Lilli's arrival, Baum's shocked reaction to Kent makes Lohmann suspicious. Lohmann and Kent visit the asylum, where they discover that Baum is the mastermind and has planned an attack on a chemical plant that night. Lohmann and Kent go to the exploding plant, where they discover Baum watching from afar. Baum flees to the asylum with Lohmann and Kent pursuing. Mabuse's spirit leads Baum to Hofmeister in his cell where he introduces himself as Dr. Mabuse, ending Hofmeister's shock. Baum tries to kill Hofmeister but is stopped by guards, just as Lohmann and Kent arrive. The final scene shows the insane Baum in the cell, tearing Mabuse's writings to shreds.

Production=Development Norbert Jacques wrote the original Dr. Mabuse books in the style of other popular thrillers in Europe at the time, such as Nick Carter, Fantomas, and Fu Manchu. Jacques expanded the traits of these books to include critiques on Weimar Germany. In 1930, Jacques was approached by a film producer to develop a story for a new Dr. Mabuse film with a female villain. This caused Jacques to start writing a new novel called Mabuse's Colony. In the novel, a character named Frau Kristine obtains a copy of Mabuse's testament which outlines plans for a future world of terrorism and crime that she uses. At this time, Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou were developing the film M. Von Harbou and Lang were friends with Jacques since creating the first Mabuse film Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, and they went on vacation with each other. Lang asked Jacques for help with the screenplay for M and asked for suggestions for a new Mabuse project. Jacques sent Lang his unfinished work for Mabuse's Colony. Lang used the idea of Mabuse's will from the story and began working on an outline to what would become The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. Using the outline that Lang proposed, Jacques signed a contract in July 1931 for the movie to be written by von Harbou and directed by Lang based on Lang's own outline.Kalat, 2005. p. 80 The film was released in tandem with Jacques's book. Jacques' contributions are not mentioned in the film. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse is a direct sequel to Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and is related to the film M which features the Inspector Lohmann character. Pre- production Many members of the cast and crew had worked with Lang on his earlier films. Rudolf Klein-Rogge returned to play Dr. Mabuse as he did in Dr. Mabuse the Gambler. Klein-Rogge acted in Lang's earlier films including Destiny, Die Nibelungen, Metropolis and Spies. Otto Wernicke reprises his role as Inspector Lohmann from Lang's M. Klaus Pohl plays Lohmann's assistant M√ºller. Pohl acted in Lang's Woman in the Moon and in an uncredited role in M. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was Lang's second film for the company Nero-Film and producer Seymour Nebenzal. The film would be the last film collaboration between Lang and his wife Thea von Harbou, who had worked with Lang on all his directorial efforts since Destiny. Lang's relationship with von Harbou was ending and the two would file divorce papers during 1933. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner returned to work with Lang. Their film credits together include M, Spies and Destiny. Filming A ghostly Dr. Mabuse announces his testament of crime. After the film's release, director Fritz Lang felt these supernatural scenes should not have been included. Lang filmed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse at the end of 1932 and the beginning of 1933, desiring to have the film viewed worldwide. In his film, where gun-play, fires, or explosions are needed, Lang often used real weapons. In the opening scene during a power outage, a stunt actor did the gun play. Cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner stated that he spent most of the production in a state of panic due to the way Lang would endanger his crew. The film is generally filmed in a realistic style with the exception of Mabuse's ghostly appearances throughout the film. Lang admitted later in interviews that if he could re-do the film, he would not have included these supernatural scenes. Wagner filmed the explosion scenes at the factory on location during nighttime. These explosion scenes were the first scenes of the film to be filmed before returning to the studio to film the rest of the film. The film crew had three weeks to prepare for the factory scene by clearing trees and bringing in some artificial trees to match Lang's idea for the scene. The explosion was triggered by Lang himself. During the early years of sound films before dubbing and subtitling, one way to present a film to a foreign audience was to record the film with a translated screenplay with foreign-language cast. As this was a time consuming and expensive procedure, most filmmakers who did this tended to only make one alternative language feature. Producer Seymour Nebenzal felt that creating this alternative version would enhance international sales for The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. The French-language screenplay was adapted by Ren√© Sti. Lang was fluent in French and directed The Testament of Dr. Mabuse in both French and German. Actor Karl Meixner played Hofmeister in both versions of the film as he was bilingual. Rudolf Klein-Rogge also features as Mabuse in the French version with his lines being dubbed. The French version, titled Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse, was edited by Lothar Wolff in France while the film was still in production. Post-production For the film, Lang commissioned a composer for the first time. Hans Erdmann created the opening theme and the music played during Professor Baum's madness. The soundtrack in the film is deceptive. As in Lang's M, the film's music and sound are a subtle mix of actual silence with accompanying music and more or less realistic sound effects. Lang worked with his German editor Conrad von Molo directly on the post-production process. Lang was known for making very long films and to suit foreign fashions, editor Lothar Wolff was contracted to shorten the French- language version. This version deletes parts from the romantic sub-plot between Lilli and Kent. Release Joseph Goebbels (pictured) withheld the release of Testament of Dr. Mabuse, stating that the film \\"showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence\\". The film was scheduled for release on March 24, 1933, at the UFA-Palast am Zoo, the same theater that hosted the original premiere of Dr. Mabuse the Gambler in 1922. Adolf Hitler came to power at the end of January 1933, and on March 14 he established the new Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda headed by Joseph Goebbels. Lang had not finished editing the film, and would not have a print for Goebbels to view until March 23. After a screening for Goebbels, he declared that the premiere would be delayed for technical reasons. Goebbels hosted a meeting at his home between himself, Lang and several other German filmmakers on discussions on what films would be permitted by Nazi censorship. Goebbels referred to Lang's films as the style that Hitler wanted for Nazi Germany. By March 30, the Ministry of Propaganda banned The Testament of Dr. Mabuse as a menace to public health and safety. Goebbels stated that he would not accept the film as it \\"showed that an extremely dedicated group of people are perfectly capable of overthrowing any state with violence\\". During the 1940s, Lang stated that a meeting occurred between Goebbels and himself, in which, in particular, Goebbels expressed his admiration for Lang's 1927 film Metropolis. Goebbels expressed the desire for Lang to work for him to create films for the Nazis. This offer caused Lang to leave Germany to France that very night. Goebbels' diary makes no mention of such a meeting and Lang's passport also shows that he did not leave until June and made repeated trips between France and Germany throughout 1933. The German version of The Testament of Dr. Mabuse premiered on April 21, 1933, in Budapest, Hungary with a playing time of 124 minutes. The French- language version was distributed through Europe. The French with English subtitles was released in the United States in 1943 with the title The Last Will of Dr. Mabuse. In 1951, the German version was released in a 75-minute version with the title The Crimes of Dr.Mabuse which featured an English dub. The English subtitles for the 1943 release and the 1952 dub added allusions to Adolf Hitler that were not part of the original script. The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was first shown publicly in Germany on August 24, 1961 with a 111-minute running time. In 1973, the unedited German version of the film was released in the United States with the title The Testament of Dr. Mabuse with English subtitles. Lang wrote a \\"Screen Forward\\" for the American release, stating: > The film was made as an allegory to show Hitler's processes of terrorism. > Slogans and doctrines of the Third Reich have been put into the mouths of > criminals in the film. Thus I hoped to expose the masked Nazi theory of the > necessity to deliberately destroy everything which is precious to a people. > ... Then, when everything collapsed and they were thrown into utter despair, > they would try to find help in the 'New order.' Siegfried Kracauer comments that Lang's comment \\"smacks of hindsight,\\" but his own analysis of the film indicates that it \\"foreshadows Nazi practices,\\" and retroactively reveals Dr. Mabuse the Gambler, Lang's first Mabuse film, to be \\"one of those deep-rooted premonitions which spread over the German post[-World War I] screen.\\" Still, despite the Nazi ban of the film, Kracauer is dubious that the average German film-goer would have seen the analogy between Baum/Mabuse's elaborate criminal organization and the Nazis. Reception In 1938, Goebbels wrote that on looking at the film that he was \\"struck by the dullness of its portrayal, the coarseness of its construction, and the inadequacy of its acting.\\" Despite Goebbels' statement, he would present the film uncensored from time to time in private screening rooms for close personal friends. On the French release, The New York Times wrote that \\"It is the French version of Fritz Lang's production, \\"Le Testament du Dr. Mabuse\\" (\\"Dr. Mabuse's Will\\"). It is a hallucinating and horrifying story, depicted with great power and the extraordinary beauty of photography that Lang has led his admirers to expect.\\" At the Hungarian premiere of the German-language print in 1933, Variety wrote that the film \\"...certainly shows the influence of American mystery pictures. The story is very long-winded and even an ingenious director like Fritz Lang could not prevent its being rather slow-moving in places.\\" Bosley Crowther wrote a negative review in The New York Times on the film's 1943 release, stating \\"it is a good, old film, well played and beautifully directed - but a battered antique, none the less.\\" On the 1973 re-release, the same newspaper wrote a positive review of the film, stating that it \\"yields a sensational torrent of images that almost make the early nineteen-seventies seem tame.\\" and \\"While this \\"Mabuse\\" lacks most of the surrealistic effects and the dazzling hallucinations that gave its predecessor such magic, it's rich in the images and the shocks at which Lang excelled.\\" Several years later, in 1947, German cultural critic Siegfried Kracauer, writing in his book From Caligari to Hitler, accuses the film of \\"repetitious shock effects [which] tend to neutralize each other, [resulting in] monotony rather than an increase in suspense.\\" He deems the film to be inferior to Lang's 1931 film M. Nevertheless, he goes on the describe several sequences in the film which illustrate Lang's \\"'uncanny genius for evoking terror out of the simplest things.'\\" He also finds fault with the lack of any strong positive character the audience can identify with, since the police captain who destroys the criminal organization is a colorless bureaucratic official whose \\"victory lacks moral significance\\". If any in the film's audience was aware of any allegorical connection between the criminals and the Nazis, there is no-one for them to turn to as an alternative to the Nazis. \\"As so often with Lang,\\" Kracauer writes, \\"the law triumphs and the lawless glitters. This anti-Nazi film betrays the power of Nazi spirit over minds insufficiently equipped to counter its peculiar fascination.\\" Modern critical reception of the film has been generally positive. Channel 4 gave the film a four stars out of five rating describing the film as a \\"Sensational crime drama\\" and \\"some of the dialogue is clunky, much of the acting...is alien to modern audiences...The final sequence involving the destruction of a huge chemical works and a car chase through eerily lit woods, round hairpin bends and over a closing level crossing is one of the triumphs of early cinema.\\" TV Guide gave the film a five out of five star rating terming it \\"a haunting, suspenseful sequel\\". Critic Leonard Maltin gave the film three and a half stars out of four and compared it to Dr. Mabuse The Gambler stating that it is \\"less stylized but no less entertaining\\". The online film database Allmovie rated the film four stars out five, stating that by \\"mixing several genres including cop drama, mystery, and horror, Lang created a rare hybrid picture full of striking characters and images.\\" Legacy After the film's initial release, producer Seymour Nebenzal used scenes from the car chase in The Testament of Dr. Mabuse for his own production of Le roi des Champs-√âlys√©es (1934) featuring Buster Keaton. Producer Artur Brauner cited the Dr. Mabuse films as the reason he went into the film industry, noting that he left his parents out in the middle of the night and returned after seeing what he described as \\"the most exciting film I've ever seen\\". Brauner later bought the rights to the Dr. Mabuse films and hired Fritz Lang to film a sequel titled The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. The film was released in 1960 and was Lang's final film as a director. In 1962, a remake of The Testament of Dr.Mabuse was released by director Werner Klingler. Brauner produced several other Mabuse films after the release of The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse. Director Claude Chabrol identified The Testament of Dr. Mabuse as his primary inspiration to become a filmmaker. Chabrol made his own Mabuse-inspired film that was released in 1990 titled Dr. M. The 2008 film The Dark Knight features a version of The Joker inspired by Mabuse. Throughout the film, the character recites monologues promoting chaos & disorder which borrow heavily from Mabuse's own in 1933's The Testament of Dr. Mabuse. Director Christopher Nolan has stated: \\"I think I made Jonah (Nolan's brother) watch Fritz Lang‚Äôs Dr. Mabuse prior to writing the Joker.\\" Home media A Region 1 DVD of The Testament of Dr. Mabuse was released by The Criterion Collection on May 18, 2004. This DVD release consists of two discs and contains both the German- language and French-language versions of the film. Film critic Dave Kehr wrote the German print is \\"the definite version\\". The German print of the film on the DVD is missing small parts of the film and runs at 121 minutes. A Region 2 DVD of the film was released by Eureka! in a box set titled The Complete Fritz Lang Mabuse Box Set. This set included the two other Mabuse films directed by Lang, Dr. Mabuse the Gambler and The Thousand Eyes of Dr. Mabuse.

(1992). Film Noir: An Encyclopedic Reference to the American Style (3rd ed.). Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press. crime drama film co-written and directed by Sidney Lumet based on Robert Daley's 1978 book of the same name about an NYPD officer who chooses to expose police corruption for idealistic reasons. The character of Daniel Ciello, played by Treat Williams, was based on real-life NYPD Narcotics Detective Robert Leuci. The large supporting cast also featured actors Jerry Orbach, Bob Balaban, and Lindsay Crouse. Prince of the City was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, but lost to On Golden Pond. Plot Danny Ciello is a narcotics detective who works in the Special Investigations Unit of the New York City Police Department. He and his partners are called \\"Princes of the City\\" because they are largely unsupervised and are given wide latitude to make cases against defendants. They are involved in numerous illegal practices, such as skimming money from criminals and supplying informants with drugs. Danny himself has a drug addict for a brother and a cousin in organized crime. After an incident in which Danny beats up a junkie to supply another junkie with heroin, his conscience begins to bother him. He is approached by internal affairs and federal prosecutors to participate in an investigation of police corruption. In exchange for potentially avoiding prosecution as well as federal protection for himself, his wife, and his children, Ciello wears a wire and works undercover to expose the inner workings of illegal police activity and corruption. He agrees to cooperate as long as he does not have to turn in his partners, but his past misdeeds and criminal associates come back to haunt him. One of his partners commits suicide during interrogation, and his cousin in the Mafia, who saves his life on one occasion and warns him of a contract on his life at another point, winds up dead. While confessing three crimes he committed in the 11 years he worked for the SIU, Danny perjures himself by denying the many other offenses he and his partners have committed. Despite repeated professions of loyalty, he finally gives up all of his partners, one of whom shoots himself as a result of this betrayal. Most of the others turn against him. In the end, the chief government prosecutor decides not to prosecute Ciello and he returns to work as an instructor at the police academy. Cast *Treat Williams ... Daniel Ciello *Jerry Orbach ...

Beach Player (uncredited) Production When producer and screenwriter Jay Presson Allen read Robert Daley's book, Prince of the City (1978), she was convinced it was an ideal Sidney Lumet project, but the film rights had already been sold to Orion Pictures for Brian De Palma and David Rabe. Allen let it be known that if that deal should fall through, then she wanted the picture for Lumet. Just as Lumet was about to sign for a different picture, they got the call that Prince of the City was theirs. Allen hadn't wanted to write Prince of the City, just produce it. She was put off by the book's non-linear story structure, but Lumet wouldn't make the picture without her, and agreed to write the outline for her. Lumet and Allen went over the book and agreed on what they could use and what they could do without. To her horror, Lumet would come in every day for weeks and scribble on legal pads. She was terrified that she would have to tell him that his stuff was unusable, but to her delight the outline was wonderful and she went to work. It was her first project with living subjects, and Allen interviewed nearly everyone in the book and had endless hours of Bob Leuci‚Äôs tapes for back-up. With all her research and Lumet's outline, she eventually turned out a 365-page script in 10 days. It was nearly impossible to sell the studio on a three-hour picture, but by offering to slash the budget to $10 million they agreed. (When asked if the original author ever has anything to say about how their book is treated, Allen replied: \\"Not if I can help it. You cannot open that can of worms. You sell your book, you go to the bank, you shut up.\\") Supposedly, Bruce Willis has a role as a background actor in this film, and Treat Williams tipped him off about The Verdict. Orion Pictures had bought Daley's book for $500,000 in 1978. Daley was a former New York Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Affairs who wrote about Robert Leuci, an NYPD detective whose testimony and secret tape recordings helped indict 52 members of the Special Investigation Unit and convict them of income tax evasion. Originally, Brian De Palma was going to direct with David Rabe adapting the book and Robert De Niro playing Leuci but the project fell through. Sidney Lumet came aboard to direct under two conditions: he did not want a big name movie star playing Leuci because he did not \\"want to spend two reels getting over past associations,\\" and the movie's running time would be at least three hours long. Lumet cast Treat Williams after spending three weeks talking to him and listening to the actor read the script and then reading it again with 50 other cast members. In order to research the role, the actor spent a month learning about police work, hung out at 23rd Precinct in New York City, went on a drug bust and lived with Leuci for some time. By the time rehearsals started, Williams said, \\"I was thinking like a cop.\\" Lumet felt guilty about the two-dimensional way he had treated cops in the 1973 film Serpico and said that Prince of the City was his way to rectify this depiction. He and Jay Presson Allen wrote a 240-page script in 30 days. The film was budgeted at $10 million but the director was able to bring it in for under $8.6 million. Distribution Orion decided to open the film initially in select theaters in order to allow good reviews and word-of-mouth to build. They were unable to buy television advertising because of the cost and relied heavily on print ads, including an unusual three-page spread in the New York Times. Reception=Response from subjects The film was considered authentic enough by the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration that he called Lumet for a copy of the movie for the DEA training program. Some law enforcement officials, however, criticized the film for glamorizing Leuci and other corrupt detectives while portraying most of the prosecutors who uncovered the crimes negatively. John Guido, Chief of Inspectional Services said, \\"The corrupt guys are the only good guys in the film.\\" Nicholas Scoppetta, the Special Prosecutor who helped convince Leuci to go undercover against his fellow officers, said, \\"In the film, it seems to be the prosecutors who are disregarding the issue of where real justice lies and the prosecutors seem to be as bad or worse than the corrupt police.\\" In fact, only two of the five prosecutors the film focuses on were portrayed negatively. In particular District Attorney Polito, played by James Tolkan, is shown as petty and vindictive. The character is based on Thomas Puccio, the assistant United States Attorney in charge of the Federal Organized Crime Strike Force in Brooklyn, and Robert Daley agrees that he was treated unfairly in the screenplay. One of the prosecutors who befriended the Ciello character and is shown in a very positive light was based on then rookie federal prosecutor Rudolph Giuliani. The character, Mario Vincente, played by Steve Inwood, is portrayed as threatening to resign if the U.S. Attorney's office indicts Ciello (Leuci) for past transgressions. In general, the prosecutors who argued against the prosecution of Leuci are treated sympathetically, while those who sought his indictment are shown as officious and vindictive. Critical reception The initial release of Prince of the City garnered both positive and negative reviews, some of the latter complaining of what was considered its excessive length, or comparing Treat Williams' performance unfavorably with that of Al Pacino in Serpico, Lumet's previous film about police corruption. , Prince of the City holds a 91% approval rating on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 23 reviews with an average rating of 7.4/10. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times called it \\"a very good movie and, like some of its characters, it wants to break your heart. Maybe it will.\\" Janet Maslin of the New York Times praised its \\"sharply detailed landscape\\" and states that its \\"brief characterizations are so keenly drawn that dozens of them stand out with the forcefulness of major performances.\\" She concludes that it \\"begins with the strength and confidence of a great film, and ends merely as a good one. The achievement isn't what it first promises to be, but it's exciting and impressive all the same.\\" The film was not commercially successful in its theatrical release, earning only $8.1 million of its $8.6 million cost.

Background The city now known as the Ukrainian Lviv () was before the dissolution of the Austrua-Hungary known as Lemberg, the capital of one of the Habsburg dominions, the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Poles were the prevailing ethnic group in the province overall, but in the eastern Galician territories, Ukrainians were a majority (65%), with Poles a significant minority (22%) and dominating the cities along with Jews.Timothy Snyder. (2003). The Reconstruction of Nations. New Haven: Yale University Press. pg. 123 In Lemberg, according to the Austrian census of 1910, 51% of the city's population were Roman Catholics, 28% Jews, and 19% Ukrainian Greek Catholics; 86% of the city's population spoke Polish and 11% Ukrainian.New International Encyclopedia, Volume 13. 1915. Lemberg'.' pg. 760 In the final days of the collapsing Habsburg empire, on November 1, 1918, Ukrainian soldiers from Austrian army units occupied Lemberg's public buildings and military depots, raised Ukrainian flags throughout the city and proclaimed the birth of a new Ukrainian state. While the Ukrainian residents enthusiastically supported the proclamation, the city's significant Jewish minority remained mostly neutral towards it and the Polish residents, the majority of the city's inhabitants, were shocked to find themselves in a Ukrainian state.Orest Subtelny, Ukraine: a history, pp. 367‚Äì368, University of Toronto Press, 2000, Reacting to this military revolution, Poles rose up throughout the city. Polish forces, initially numbering only about 200, organized a small pocket of resistance in a school at the western outskirts, where a group of veterans of the Polish Military Organization put up a fight armed with 64 outdated rifles. After initial clashes, the defenders were joined by hundreds of volunteers, mostly boy scouts, students and youngsters. More than 1000 people joined the Polish ranks in the first day of the fighting. Description Among them were many young volunteers, who became known as the Lw√≥w Eaglets. Initially, the term was confined to those who had participated in the fights within the city between November 1 and November 22, 1918, and the following siege by the Ukrainian army between November 23, 1918, and May 22, 1919. With time, however, the term's application was broadened, and it is now used for all the young soldiers who fought in the area of Eastern Galicia for the Polish cause in the Polish-Ukrainian War and the Polish-Bolshevik War. In addition to the young Polish nationals of Lviv, those fighting in the Polish-Ukrainian battle for Przemy≈õl are also frequently referred to as Przemyskie Orlƒôta ('\\"Przemy≈õl Eaglets\\"). Cemetery Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw√≥w After the Polish- Ukrainian conflict, the Lw√≥w Eaglets were interred at the Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw√≥w (Polish popular name: Cmentarz OrlƒÖt Lwowskich), part of the Lychakiv Cemetery. The Cemetery of the Defenders held the remains of both teenaged and adult soldiers, including foreign volunteers from France and the United States. The Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw√≥w was designed by Rudolf Indruch, a student at the Lviv Institute of Architecture, himself an Eaglet. Among the most notable Eaglets to be buried there was the 14-year-old Jerzy Bitschan, the youngest of the city's defenders, whose name became an icon of the Polish interbellum. Also resting in the Eaglet's pantheon is the six-year- old Oswald Anissimo who was executed, together with his father, Micha≈Ç, by the Ukrainian soldiers. M. Ga≈Çƒôzowski, Na wz√≥r OrlƒÖt lwowskich , Biuletyn IPN, nr 11-12/2008, p. 99. Ukrainian military leader Dmytro Vitovsky threatened summary execution to all men living in houses from where shots were fired. After the annexation of Eastern Galicia with the city of Lw√≥w by the Soviet Union in World War II during the Soviet invasion of Poland and then the expulsion of the Polish population from the city, the graves were destroyed in 1971, and the Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw√≥w was turned into a municipal waste dump and then a truck depot. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the formation of an independent Ukraine, work began on the restoration of the cemetery despite obstruction from local nationalists. Polish support of Ukraine's Orange Revolution (2004) mase the opposition decline, and the cemetery was officially reopened in a Polish-Ukrainian ceremony on June 24, 2005. The last surviving Lw√≥w Eaglet, Major Aleksander Sa≈Çacki (born 12 May 1904), died in Tychy, on April 5, 2008.

Types When the primary beam consists of accelerated electrons, the probe is termed an electron microprobe, when the primary beam consists of accelerated ions, the term ion microprobe is used. The term microprobe may also be applied to optical analytical techniques, when the instrument is set up to analyse micro samples or micro areas of larger specimens. Such techniques include micro Raman spectroscopy, micro infrared spectroscopy and micro LIBS. All of these techniques involve modified optical microscopes to locate the area to be analysed, direct the probe beam and collect the analytical signal. A laser microprobe is a mass spectrometer that uses ionization by a pulsed laser and subsequent mass analysis of the generated ions. Uses Scientists use this beam of charged particles to determine the elemental composition of solid materials (minerals, glasses, metals). The chemical composition of the target can be found from the elemental data extracted through emitted X-rays (in the case where the primary beam consists of charged electrons) or measurement of an emitted secondary beam of material sputtered from the target (in the case where the primary beam consists of charged ions). When the ion energy is in the range of a few tens of keV (kilo-electronvolt) these microprobes are usually called FIB (Focused ion beam). An FIB makes a small portion of the material into a plasma; the analysis is done by the same basic techniques as the ones used in mass spectrometry. When the ion energy is higher, hundreds of keV to a few MeV (mega-electronvolt) they are called nuclear microprobes. Nuclear microprobes are extremely powerful tools that utilize ion beam analysis techniques as microscopies with spot sizes in the micro-/nanometre range. These instruments are applied to solve scientific problems in a diverse range of fields, from microelectronics to biomedicine. In addition to the development of new ways to exploit these probes as analytical tools (this application area of the nuclear microprobes is called nuclear microscopy), strong progress has been made in the area of materials modification recently (most of which can be described as PBW, proton beam writing). The nuclear microprobe's beam is usually composed of protons and alpha particles. Some of the most advanced nuclear microprobes have beam energies in excess of 2 MeV. This gives the device very high sensitivity to minute concentrations of elements, around 1 ppm at beam sizes smaller than 1 micrometer. This elemental sensitivity exists because when the beam interacts with the a sample it gives off characteristic X-rays of each element present in the sample. This type of detection of radiation is called PIXE. Other analysis techniques are applied to nuclear microscopy including Rutherford backscattering(RBS), STIM, etc. Another use for microprobes is the production of micro and nano sized devices, as in microelectromechanical systems and nanoelectromechanical systems. The advantage that microprobes have over other lithography processes is that a microprobe beam can be scanned or directed over any area of the sample. This scanning of the microprobe beam can be imagined to be like using a very fine tipped pencil to draw your design on a paper or in a drawing program. Traditional lithography processes use photons which cannot be scanned and therefore masks are needed to selectively expose your sample to radiation. It is the radiation that causes changes in the sample, which in turn allows scientists and engineers to develop tiny devices such as microprocessors, accelerometers (like in most car safety systems), etc. References Microscopes Measuring instruments Spectroscopy Microtechnology ","title":"Microprobe"},{"id":"1353138","text":"≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province (, ) or simply Urfa Province is a province in southeastern Turkey. The city of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa is the capital of the province which bears its name. The population is 1,845,667 (2014). The province has a Kurdish majority, with a significant Arab minority.  Districts  ≈ûanlƒ±urfa province is divided into 13 districts (capital district in bold): * Urfa (Central district. In 2014 it was split into three districts: Eyy√ºbiye, Haliliye and Karak√∂pr√º.) * Ak√ßakale * Birecik * Bozova * Ceylanpƒ±nar * Halfeti * Harran * Hilvan * Siverek * Suru√ß * Viran≈üehir  Geography  ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province is in Turkish Kurdistan. It has an area of 18,584 km¬≤ (7,173 sq. miles), making it the largest province of Southeast Anatolia. It borders Adƒ±yaman to the north, Syria to the south, Mardin and Diyarbakƒ±r to the east, and Gaziantep to the west; ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province includes several major components of the Southeastern Anatolia Project (in Turkish G√ºneydogu Anadolu Projesi (GAP)). This large- scale, state-sponsored development project involves the damming, redirecting, hydroelectric tapping, and other utilization of rivers in this broad, semi- arid region. The remainder of the water then flows into Syria and Iraq. Even before GAP, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa Province had the largest share of cultivated and cultivable land in the GAP region, due to its flatness and highly fertile, agricultural land. The ≈ûanlƒ±urfa and Harran Plains extend over an area of about 1,500 km¬≤ (579 sq. miles). Irrigating these plains is one of the most important components of GAP.  Politics  On 1 January 1928 the province was included into the First Inspectorate-General over which an Inspector-General ruled according to the policies recommended in Report for Reform in the East. The Inspectorate was governed with martial law and span over the provinces of Hakk√¢ri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, Bitlis, Sanlƒ±urfa, Elaziƒü and Diyarbakƒ±r. The office of the Inspector General was dissolved in 1952. ≈ûanlƒ±urfa once being a relatively competitive province between the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and the True Path Party (DYP), it is now one of the most solid AKP provinces. While the AKP managed to win ≈ûanlƒ±urfa with a comfortable 43.04% during the 2004 local elections, it has since then increased its margins of victory here. Following the diminishing popularity of smaller parties such as the DYP, ≈ûanlƒ±urfa heavily shifted towards the AKP, winning the November 2015 election with 64.55% of the votes. ≈ûanlƒ±urfa once again showed its status as an AKP stronghold in the 2017 referendum, with the Yes vote winning with a wide margin of 41.8%. The Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) came in second with 38.1 in the general elections in June 2015, and with 28.2% the HDP was also second in the November 2015 general election. The far-right Nationalist Movement Party (MHP) scored an exceptional 7.18% in the 1999 local elections. Its vote share eventually ebbed to a more usual 2.97% in the 2004 local elections. The MHP showed a significant recovery in the indecisive June 2015 election by winning 5.56% of the votes. However, the MHP went on to suffer from a nationwide loss in the upset November 2015 election, with its vote share declining to 2.75% in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa. The centre-left Republican People's Party (CHP) usually maintains a modest share of slightly below 5%. Similar to the other two opposition parties, the CHP suffered a loss in ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, going from 4.10% in the June 2015 election to 2.70% in the November 2015 election. The current Governor of Sanliurfa is Abdullah Erin. Places of interest The province is famous for its Abrahamic sites such as Balƒ±klƒ±g√∂l, where Prophet Abraham was cast by Nimrod into fire that is believed to have turned to water. Also the Mevlid-i Halil Mosque, where Abraham is believed to be born in the cave next to the mosque is well known. Within the province, approximately 12 km (7 mi) northeast of the city of ≈ûanlƒ±urfa, is the pre-historic site of G√∂bekli Tepe, where continuing excavations have unearthed 12,000-year-old sanctuaries dating from the early Neolithic period, considered to be the oldest temples in the world, predating Stonehenge by 6,000 years.

He married singer Rose Lee Maphis in 1953. One of the flashiest country guitarists of the 1950s and 1960s, Joe Maphis was known as The King of the Strings. He was able to play many stringed instruments with great facility. However, he specialized in dazzling guitar virtuosity. Biography=Early life Maphis was born in Suffolk, Virginia, United States. Joe's family moved to Cumberland, Maryland, in 1926 when his father Robert Maphis landed a job with the B&O; Railroad. Joe's first band was called the Maryland Rail Splitters. He also played in the local (Cumberland) Foggy Mountain Boys as well as The Sonnateers before Maphis hit the road in 1939. He played across Virginia until he became a regular featured performer on the \\"Old Dominion Barn Dance,\\" broadcast live on radio WRVA-AM and aired in 38 states. In 1944, Joe went into the U.S. Army. His musical skills landed him a gig entertaining the troops around the world. Maphis was discharged from the Army in 1946. On his return to the states, he began playing on WLS radio in Chicago. In the late 1940s he returned to Richmond, Va. and the Old Dominion Barn Dance until the early 1950s. During this period Maphis met many country music stars of the day who played the same circuit including Merle Travis. While in Virginia, he also met the musically talented Rose Lee (Doris) Schetrompf, his future wife. Maphis and Schetrompf, of Clear Spring, Md., were married in 1953. A talented vocalist and rhythm guitarist, Rose backed Joe onstage throughout the remainder of his career. Recording career Maphis' recording career took off in 1951 when he was invited to Los Angeles by Merle Travis and country music entertainer Johnny Bond. He made two LPs with Travis, recorded for countless country and pop stars and worked on many themes for television programs and movie soundtracks. Maphis recorded for Columbia Records and other labels. Later based in Bakersfield, California, he rose to prominence with his own hits such as \\"Dim Lights, Thick Smoke (And Loud, Loud Music)\\" as well as playing with acts like Johnny Burnette, Doyle Holly, The Collins Kids, Wanda Jackson, Rose Maddox and Ricky Nelson. \\"Dim Lights\\" has become a honky-tonk standard with numerous artists recording versions of the tune including Flatt and Scruggs, Vern Gosdin, Daryle Singletary and Dwight Yoakam. Maphis was a band member and featured soloist on the Town Hall Party radio (and later television) program broadcast throughout the 1950s. Emanating from the Los Angeles area, Maphis was a regular on the program which including many recording stars of the day including Tex Ritter, Johnny Cash, Gene Autry, Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys and many others. \\"Town Hall Party,\\" was later syndicated under the name \\"Ranch Party,\\" and seen in most parts of the country. He was also a regular guest on the Jimmy Dean television show in the 1960s. Joe and Rose performed on the PBS television broadcast \\"Austin City Limits,\\" in 1984 as part of the programs, \\"Legends Series.\\" Fellow music industry insiders and fans had begun calling Joe and Rose, \\"Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.\\" Death Maphis was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1985. He died on June 27, 1986. His guitar hero was Mother Maybelle Carter, matriarch of the Carter Family. Maybelle's daughter June Carter Cash and June's husband Johnny Cash so admired Maphis that he was laid to rest in the Cash and Carter family Hendersonville, Tennessee burial plot next to Maybelle, her husband, Ezra Carter, and her daughter, Anita Carter. Maphis family Joe and Rose Lee had three children: Dale, Lorrie and Jody. Dale died in an automobile accident in 1989. Jody Maphis is an active musician. He has played drums or guitar for Earl Scruggs, Johnny Rodriguez, Johnny Cash, Gary Allan, Marty Stuart and many others.

He is currently a board member of SpaceX and Tesla, among others. He later co-founded the firm Future Ventures with Maryanna Saenko, who worked with him at DFJ. Early life and education Jurvetson's father T√µnu J√ºrvetson fled Estonia through Germany just before Soviet re-occupation in 1944. T√µnu was married to another Estonian immigrant, Tiiu Tia J√ºrvetson. Even though within the family, the Estonian language was used, Steve never learned it and his parents used it as a secret language between themselves. Steve Jurvetson was the first non-European to become an e-resident of Estonia. Jurvetson grew up in Dallas, where he graduated from St. Mark's School of Texas in 1985. At Stanford University, Jurvetson finished his degree in electrical engineering in 2.5 years and graduated No. 1 in his class. He then earned an M.S. in electrical engineering and an M.B.A., also from Stanford. His first job out of Stanford was working as an R&D; engineer at Hewlett- Packard (HP). After two years at HP, he moved on as a product marketer at Apple and then NeXT Software. Jurvetson was named to the MIT TR35 in 1999 for \\"recognize young entrepreneurs who can deliver\\", including making the first investment in Hotmail. Career The first production Tesla Model S (with owner Tesla Board member Steve Jurvetson) in June 2015, three years after the car's market release. As a consultant with Bain & Company, Jurvetson developed executive marketing, sales, engineering and business strategies for a wide range of companies in the software, networking, and semiconductor industries. He first joined DFJ after his second year of business school, and became a partner after proving his talent on several investments. At DFJ, Jurvetson was involved in lucrative investments with Hotmail, Interwoven, Kana, Tradex, and Cyras. Cyras in particular was acquired for 8 billion USD.

Alternative name and spellings include Kumarikkandam and Kumari Nadu In the 19th century, a section of the European and American scholars speculated the existence of a submerged continent called Lemuria, to explain geological and other similarities between Africa, Australia, India and Madagascar. A section of Tamil revivalists adapted this theory, connecting it to the Pandyan legends of lands lost to the ocean, as described in ancient Tamil and Sanskrit literature. According to these writers, an ancient Tamil civilization existed on Lemuria, before it was lost to the sea in a catastrophe. In the 20th century, the Tamil writers started using the name \\"Kumari Kandam\\" to describe this submerged continent. Although the Lemuria theory was later rendered obsolete by the continental drift (plate tectonics) theory, the concept remained popular among the Tamil revivalists of the 20th century. According to them, Kumari Kandam was the place where the first two Tamil literary academies (sangams) were organized during the Pandyan reign. They claimed Kumari Kandam as the cradle of civilization to prove the antiquity of Tamil language and culture.  Etymology and names  The Tamil writers were introduced to the concept of Lemuria in the 1890s, they came up with the Tamilized versions of the continent's name (e.g. \\"Ilemuria\\"). By the early 1900s, they started using Tamil names for the continent, to support their depiction of Lemuria as an ancient Tamil civilization. In 1903, V.G. Suryanarayana Sastri first used the term \\"Kumarinatu\\" (or \\"Kumari Nadu\\", meaning \\"Kumari territory\\") in his work Tamil Mozhiyin Varalaru (History of the Tamil language). The term Kumari Kandam (\\"Kumari continent\\") was first used to describe Lemuria in the 1930s. The words \\"Kumari Kandam\\" first appear in Kanda Puranam, a 15th-century Tamil version of the Skanda Purana, written by Kachiappa Sivacharyara (1350-1420). Although the Tamil revivalists insist that it is a pure Tamil name, it is actually a derivative of the Sanskrit word \\"KumƒÅrika Kha·πá·∏ça\\". The Andakosappadalam section of Kanda Puranam describes the following cosmological model of the universe: There are many worlds, each having several continents, which in turn, have several kingdoms. Paratan, the ruler of one such kingdom, had eight sons and one daughter. He further divided his kingdom into nine parts, and the part ruled by his daughter Kumari came to be known as Kumari Kandam after her. Kumari Kandam is described as the kingdom of the Earth. Although the Kumari Kandam theory became popular among anti-Brahmin anti- Sanskrit Tamil nationalists, the Kanda Puranam actually describes Kumari Kandam as the land where the Brahmins reside, where Shiva is worshipped and where the Vedas are recited. The rest of the kingdoms are described as the territory of the mlecchas. The 20th century Tamil writers came up with various theories to explain the etymology of \\"Kumari Kandam\\" or \\"Kumari Nadu\\". One set of claims was centered on the purported gender egalitarianism in the prelapsarian Tamil homeland. For example, M. Arunachalam (1944) claimed that the land was ruled by female rulers (Kumaris). D. Savariroyan Pillai stated that the women of the land had the right to choose their husbands and owned all the property, because of which the land came to be known as \\"Kumari Nadu\\" (\\"the land of the maiden\\"). Yet another set of claims was centered on the Hindu goddess Kanya Kumari. Kandiah Pillai, in a book for children, fashioned a new history for the goddess, stating that the land was named after her. He claimed that the temple at Kanyakumari was established by those who survived the flood that submerged Kumari Kandam. According to cultural historian Sumathi Ramaswamy, the emphasis of the Tamil writers on the word \\"Kumari\\" (meaning virgin or maiden) symbolizes the purity of Tamil language and culture, before their contacts with the other ethnic groups such as the Indo- Aryans. The Tamil writers also came up with several other names for the lost continent. In 1912, Somasundara Bharati first used the word \\"Tamilakam\\" (a name for the ancient Tamil country) to cover the concept of Lemuria, presenting it as the cradle of civilization, in his Tamil Classics and Tamilakam. Another name used was \\"Pandiya nadu\\", after the Pandyas, regarded as the oldest of the Tamil dynasties. Some writers used \\"Navalan Tivu\\" (or Navalam Island), the Tamil name of Jambudvipa, to describe the submerged land.  Submerged lands in ancient literature  Multiple ancient and medieval Tamil and Sanskrit works contain legendary accounts of lands in South India being lost to the ocean. The earliest explicit discussion of a katalkol (\\"seizure by ocean\\", possibly tsunami) of Pandyan land is found in a commentary on Iraiyanar Akapporul. This commentary, attributed to Nakkeerar, is dated to the later centuries of the 1st millennium CE. It mentions that the Pandyan kings, an early Tamil dynasty, established three literary academies (Sangams): the first Sangam flourished for 4,400 years in a city called Tenmadurai (South Madurai) attended by 549 poets (including Agastya) and presided over by gods like Shiva, Kubera and Murugan. The second Sangam lasted for 3,700 years in a city called Kapatapuram, attended by 59 poets (including Agastya, again). The commentary states that both the cities were \\"seized by the ocean\\", resulting in loss of all the works created during the first two Sangams. The third Sangam was established in Uttara (North) Madurai, where it is said to have lasted for 1,850 years. Nakkeerar's commentary does not mention the size of the territory lost to the sea. The size is first mentioned in a 15th-century commentary on Silappatikaram. The commentator Adiyarkunallar mentions that the lost land extended from Pahruli river in the north to the Kumari river in the South. It was located to the south of Kanyakumari, and covered an area of 700 kavatam (a unit of unknown measurement). It was divided into 49 territories (natu), classified in the following seven categories: * Elu te√±ku natu (\\"Seven coconut lands\\") * Elu Maturai natu (\\"Seven mango lands\\") * Elu munpalai natu (\\"Seven front sandy lands\\") * Elu pinpalai natu (\\"Seven back sandy lands\\") * Elu kunra natu (\\"Seven hilly lands\\") * Elu kunakarai natu (\\"Seven coastal lands\\") * Elu kurumpanai natu (\\"Seven dwarf- palm lands\\") Other medieval writers, such as Ilampuranar and Perasiriyar, also make stray references to the loss of antediluvian lands to the south of Kanyakumari, in their commentaries on ancient texts like Tolkappiyam. Another legend about the loss of Pandyan territory to the sea is found in scattered verses of Purananuru (dated between 1st century BCE and 5th century CE) and Kaliththokai (6th-7th century CE).Kalittokai 104:1‚Äì4Purananuru 6:1‚Äì2, 17:1, 67:6. According to this account, the Pandyan king compensated the loss of his land by seizing an equivalent amount of land from the neighboring kingdoms of Cheras and Cholas. There are also several other ancient accounts of non- Pandyan land lost to the sea. Many Tamil Hindu shrines have legendary accounts of surviving the floods mentioned in Hindu mythology. These include the prominent temples of Kanyakumari, Kanchipuram, Kumbakonam, Madurai, Sirkazhi and Tiruvottiyur. There are also legends of temples submerged under the sea, such as the Seven Pagodas of Mahabalipuram, the remains of which were discovered after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The Puranas place the beginning of the most popular Hindu flood myth - the legend of Manu - in South India. The Sanskrit-language Bhagavata Purana (dated 500 BCE-1000 CE) describes its protagonist Manu (aka Satyavrata) as the Lord of Dravida (South India). The Matsya Purana (dated 250‚Äì500 CE) also begins with Manu practicing tapas on Mount Malaya of South India. Manimeghalai (dated around 6th century CE) mentions that the ancient Chola port city of Kaverippumpattinam (present-day Puhar) was destroyed by a flood. It states that this flood was sent by the Hindu deity Indra, because the king forgot to celebrate a festival dedicated to him. None of these ancient texts or their medieval commentaries use the name \\"Kumari Kandam\\" or \\"Kumari Nadu\\" for the land purportedly lost to the sea. They do not state that the land lost by the sea was a whole continent located to the south of Kanyakumari. Nor do they link the loss of this land to the history of Tamil people as a community.  Lemuria hypothesis in India  In 1864, the English zoologist Philip Sclater hypothesized the existence of a submerged land connection between India, Madagascar and continental Africa. He named this submerged land Lemuria, as the concept had its origins in his attempts to explain the presence of lemur- like primates (strepsirrhini) on these three disconnected lands. Before the Lemuria hypothesis was rendered obsolete by the continental drift theory, a number of scholars supported and expanded it. The concept was introduced to the Indian readers in an 1873 physical geography textbook by Henry Francis Blanford. According to Blanford, the landmass had submerged due to volcanic activity during the Cretaceous period. In late 1870s, the Lemuria theory found its first proponents in the present-day Tamil Nadu, when the leaders of the Adyar-headquartered Theosophical Society wrote about it (see the root race theory). Most European and American geologists dated Lemuria's disappearance to a period before the emergence of modern humans. Thus, according to them, Lemuria could not have hosted an ancient civilization. However, in 1885, the Indian Civil Service officer Charles D. Maclean published The Manual of the Administration of the Madras Presidency, in which he theorized Lemuria as the proto-Dravidian urheimat. In a footnote in this work, he mentioned Ernst Haeckel's Asia hypothesis, which theorized that the humans originated in a land now submerged in the Indian Ocean. Maclean added that this submerged land was the homeland of the proto-Dravidians. He also suggested that the progenitors of the other races must have migrated from Lemuria to other places via South India. This theory was also cursorily discussed by other colonial officials like Edgar Thurston and Herbert Hope Risley, including in the census reports of 1891 and 1901. Later, Maclean's manual came to be cited as an authoritative work by the Tamil writers, who often wrongly referred to him as a \\"scientist\\" and a \\"Doctor\\". The native Tamil intellectuals first started discussing the concept of a submerged Tamil homeland in the late 1890s. In 1898, J. Nallasami Pillai published an article in the philosophical-literary journal Siddhanta Deepika (aka The Truth of Light). He wrote about the theory of a lost continent in the Indian Ocean (i.e. Lemuria), mentioning that the Tamil legends speak of floods which destroyed the literary works produced during the ancient sangams. However, he also added that this theory had \\"no serious historical or scientific footing\\".Nallasami Pillai, J. 1898. Ancient Tamil Civilization. The Light of Truth or Siddhanta Deepika 2, no. 5: 109‚Äì13.  Popularization in Tamil Nadu  In the 1920s, the Lemuria concept was popularized by the Tamil revivalists to counter the dominance of Indo-Aryans and Sanskrit. Tamil revivalist writers claimed that Lemuria, prior to its deluge, was the original Tamil homeland and birthplace of Tamil civilization. They often misquoted or miscited the words of Western scholars to grant credibility to their assertions. During the British era, the loss of small patches of lands to cyclones was cataloged in several district reports, gazetteers, and other documents. The Tamil writers of the period cited these as evidence supporting the theory about an ancient land lost to the sea. = In curriculum = The books discussing the Kumari Kandam theory were first included in the college curriculum of the present-day Tamil Nadu in 1908. Suryanarayana Sastri's book was prescribed for use in Madras University's Master's degree courses in 1908-09. Over the next few decades, other such works were also included in the curriculum of Madras University and Annamalai University. These include Purnalingam Pillai's A Primer of Tamil Literature (1904) and Tamil literature (1929), Kandiah Pillai's Tamilakam (1934), and Srinivasa Pillai's Tamil Varalaru (1927). In a 1940 Tamil language textbook for ninth-grade students, T. V. Kalyanasundaram wrote that Lemuria of the European scholars was Kumarinatu of the Tamil literature. After the Dravidian parties came to power in the 1967 Madras State elections, the Kumari Kandam theory was disseminated more widely through school and college textbooks. In 1971, the Government of Tamil Nadu established a formal committee to write the history of Tamilakam (ancient Tamil territory). The state education minister R. Nedunceliyan declared in the Legislative Assembly that by \\"history\\", he meant \\"from the time of Lemuria that was seized by the ocean\\".Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly Debates 24 (1972): 76. In 1971, the Government of Tamil Nadu constituted a committee of historians and litterateurs, headed by M. Varadarajan. One of the objectives of the committee was to highlight \\"the great antiquity\\" of the Tamils. A 1975 textbook written by this committee detailed the Kumari Kandam theory, stating that it was supported by \\"the foremost geologists, ethnologists, and anthropologists\\". As late as 1981, the Tamil Nadu government's history textbooks mentioned the Kumari Kandam theory.  Characteristics  Tamil writers characterized Kumari Kandam as an ancient, but highly advanced civilization located in an isolated continent in the Indian Ocean. They also described it as the cradle of civilization inhabited solely by the speakers of Tamil language. The following sections describe these characteristics in detail.  Isolated  Kumari Kandam is theorized as an isolated (both temporally and geographically) land mass. Geographically, it was located in the Indian Ocean. Temporally, it was a very ancient civilization. Many Tamil writers do not assign any date to the submergence of Kumari Kandam, resorting to phrases like \\"once upon a time\\" or \\"several thousands of years ago\\". Those who do, vary greatly, ranging from 30,000 BCE to the 3rd century BCE. Several other writers state that the land was progressively lost to the sea over a period of thousands of years. In 1991, R. Mathivanan, then Chief Editor of the Tamil Etymological Dictionary Project of the Government of Tamil Nadu, claimed that the Kumari Kandam civilization flourished around 50,000 BCE, and the continent submerged around 16,000 BCE. This theory was based on the methodology recommended by his teacher Devaneya Pavanar. The isolation resulted in the possibility of describing Kumari Kandam as a utopian society insulated from external influences and foreign corruption. Unlike its description in the Kanda Puranam, the Tamil revivalists depicted Kumari Kandam as a place free of the upper-caste Brahmins, who had come to be identified as descendants of Indo-Aryans during the Dravidian movement. The non-utopian practices of the 20th century Tamil Hindu society, such as superstitions and caste-based discrimination, were all described as corruption resulting from Indo-Aryan influence. A land lost to the ocean also helped the Tamil revivalists provide an explanation for the lack of historically verifiable or scientifically acceptable material evidence about this ancient civilization. The earliest extant Tamil writings, which are attributed to the third Sangam, contain Sanskrit vocabulary, and thus could not have been the creation of a purely Tamil civilization. Connecting the concept of Lemuria to an ancient Tamil civilization allowed the Tamil revivalists to portray a society completely free of Indo-Aryan influence. They could claim that the various signs of the ancient Tamil civilization had been lost in the deep ocean. The later dominance of Sanskrit was offered as another explanation for the deliberate destruction of ancient Tamil works. In the 1950s, R. Nedunceliyan, who later became Tamil Nadu's education minister, published a pamphlet called Marainta Tiravitam (\\"Lost Dravidian land\\"). He insisted that the Brahmin historians, being biased towards Sanskrit, had deliberately kept the knowledge of the Tamil's greatness hidden from the public.  Connected with South India  The Kumari Kandam proponents laid great emphasis on stating that the Kanyakumari city was a part of the original Kumari Kandam. Some of them also argued that entire Tamil Nadu, entire Indian peninsula (south of Vindhyas) or even entire India were a part of Kumari Kandam. This helped ensure that the modern Tamils could be described as both indigenous people of South India and the direct descendants of the people of Kumari Kandam. This, in turn, allowed them to describe the Tamil language and culture as the world's oldest. During British Raj, Kanyakumari was a part of the Travancore state, most of which was merged to the newly-formed Kerala state after the 1956 reorganization. The Tamil politicians made a concerted effort to ensure that Kanyakumari was incorporated into the Tamil-majority Madras State (now Tamil Nadu). Kanyakumari's purported connection with Kumari Kandam was one of the reasons for this effort.  Cradle of civilization  According to the Kumari Kandam proponents, the continent was submerged when the last ice age ended and the sea levels rose. The Tamil people then migrated to other lands, and mixed with the other groups, leading to the formation of new races, languages and civilizations. Some also theorize that the entire humanity is descended from the inhabitants of Kumari Kandam. Both narratives agree on the point that the Tamil culture is the source of all civilized culture in the world, and Tamil is the mother language of all other languages in the world. According to the most versions, the original culture of Kumari Kandam survived in Tamil Nadu. As early as 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri, in his Tamilmoliyin Varalaru, insisted that all the humans were descendants of the ancient Tamils from Kumari Kandam. Such claims were repeated by several others, including M. S. Purnalingam Pillai and Maraimalai Adigal. In 1917, Abraham Pandithar wrote that Lemuria was the cradle of human race, and Tamil was the first language spoken by the humans. These claims were repeated in the school and college textbooks of Tamil Nadu throughout the 20th century. M. S. Purnalingam Pillai, writing in 1927, stated that Indus Valley Civilization was established by the Tamil survivors from the flood-hit Kumari Nadu. In the 1940s, N. S. Kandiah Pillai published maps showing migration of the Kumari Kandam residents to other parts of the world.1945\\\\. Namatu Natu [Our nation].

N.p.: Progressive Printers. Page 12. In 1953, R. Nedunceliyan, who later became the education minister of Tamil Nadu, insisted that the civilization spread from South India to the Indus Valley and Sumer, and subsequently, to \\"Arabia, Egypt, Greece, Italy, Spain and other places\\".Nedunceliyan, R. 1953. Marainta Tiravitam [Lost Dravidian land]. Madras: Manram Patippakam. They presented modern Tamil as a pale remnant of the glorious ancient Tamil language spoken in Kumari Kandam. Some Tamil writers also claimed that the Indo-Aryans were also descendants of proto- Dravidians of Kumari Kandam. According to this theory, these Indo-Aryans belonged to a branch which migrated to Central Asia and then returned to India. Similar explanations were used to reconcile the popular theory that proto-Dravidians migrated to India from the Mediterranean region. A 1975 Government of Tamil Nadu college text book stated that the Dravidians of Kumari Kandam had migrated to the Mediterranean region after the submergence of their continent; later, they migrated back to India via the Himalayan passes.Government of Tamilnadu. 1975. Tamilnattu Varalaru: Tolpala√±kalam [History of Tamilnadu: Prehistoric times]. Madras: Tamilnadu Aracu. Page 127.  Primordial but not primitive  The Tamil revivalists did not consider Kumari Kandam as a primitive society or a rural civilization. Instead, they described it as a utopia which had reached the zenith of human achievement, and where people lived a life devoted to learning, education, travel and commerce. Sumanthi Ramaswamy notes that this \\"placemaking\\" of Kumari Kandam was frequently intended as a teaching tool, meant to inspire the modern Tamils to pursue excellence. But this pre-occupation with \\"civilization\\" was also a response to the British rulers' projection of the Europeans as more civilized than the Tamils. Suryanarayan Sastri, in 1903, described the antediluvian Tamils as expert cultivators, fine poets and far-traveling merchants, who lived in an egalitarian and democratic society. Savariroyan Pillai, writing a few years later, described Kumari Kandam as a seat of learning and culture. Sivagnana Yogi (1840-1924) stated that this ancient society was free of any caste system. Kandiah Pillai, in a 1945 work for children, wrote that Kumarikandam was ruled by a strong and just emperor called Sengon, who organized the sangams. In 1981, the Government of Tamil Nadu funded a documentary film on Kumari Kandam. The film, personally backed by the Chief Minister M. G. Ramachandran and directed by P. Neelakantan, was screened at the Fifth International Conference of Tamil Studies in Madurai. It combined the continental drift theory with the submerged continent theory to present Lemuria as a scientifically valid concept. It depicted Kumari Kandam cities resplendent with mansions, gardens, arts, crafts, music and dance.  Alleged lost works  The Tamil revivalists insisted that the first two Tamil sangams (literary academies) were not mythical, and happened in the Kumari Kandam era. While most Tamil revivalists did not enumerate or list the lost Sangam works, some came up with their names, and even listed their contents. In 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri named some of these works as Mutunarai, Mutukuruku, Mapuranam and Putupuranam. In 1917, Abraham Pandithar listed three of these works as the world's first treatises of music: Naratiyam, Perunarai and Perunkuruku. He also listed several rare musical instruments such as the thousand-stringed lute, which had been lost to the sea. Devaneya Pavanar printed an entire list of the submerged books. Others listed books on a wide range of topics, including medicine, martial arts, logic, painting, sculpture, yoga, philosophy, music, mathematics, alchemy, magic, architecture, poetry, and wealth. Since these works had been lost to the sea, the Kumari Kandam proponents insisted that no empirical proof could be provided for their claims. In 1902, Chidambaranar published a book called Cenkonraraiccelavu, claiming that he had 'discovered' the manuscript from \\"some old cudgan leaves\\". The book was presented as a lost-and-found work of the first Sangam at Tenmadurai. The author of the poem was styled as Mutaluli Centan Taniyur (\\"Chentan who lived in Taniyur before the first deluge\\"). The work talked about the exploits of an antediluvian Tamil king Sengon, who ruled the now- submerged kingdom of Peruvalanatu, the region between the rivers Kumari and Pahruli. According to Chidambaranar, Sengon was a native of Olinadu, which was located south of the Equator; the king maintained several battleships and conquered lands as far as Tibet. In 1950s, Cenkonraraiccelavu was declared as a forgery by S. Vaiyapuri Pillai. However, this did not stop the Tamil revivalists from invoking the text. The 1981 documentary funded by Government of Tamil Nadu declared it as the \\"world's first travelogue\\".  Extent  The medieval commentator Adiyarkunallar stated that the size of the land south of Kanyakumari, lost to the sea was 700 kavatam. The modern equivalent of kavatam is not known. In 1905, Arasan Shanmugham Pillai wrote that this land amounted to thousands of miles. According to Purnalingam Pillai and Suryanarayana Sastri, the number was equivalent to 7000 miles.Subramania Sastri 1915‚Äì16, 420‚Äì21; Swaminatha Aiyar 1978, 14. Others, such as Abraham Pandither, Aiyan Aarithan, Devaneyan and Raghava Aiyangar offered estimates ranging from 1,400 to 3,000 miles.Abraham Pandither 1984, 55; Aiyan Aarithan 1904‚Äì5, 274; Devaneyan 1940, 50; Raghava Aiyangar 1938, 91. According to U. V. Swaminatha Iyer, only the land amounting in area to only a few villages (equivalent to the Tamil measure of two kurram) was lost. In 1903, Suryanarayana Sastri suggested that Kumari Kandam extended from the present-day Kanyakumari in North to Kerguelen Islands in South, and from Madagascar in the West to Sunda Islands in the East. In 1912, Somasundara Bharati wrote that the continent touched China, Africa, Australia and Kanyakumari on four sides. In 1948, Maraimalai Adigal stated that the continent stretched as far as the South Pole. Somasundara Bharati offered an estimate of 6000‚Äì7000 miles.  Maps  The first map to visualize Lemuria as an ancient Tamil territory was published by S. Subramania Sastri in 1916, in the journal Centamil. This map was actually part of an article that criticized the pseudohistorical claims about a lost continent. Sastri insisted that the lost land mentioned in Adiyarkunallar's records was barely equivalent to a taluka (not larger than a few hundred square miles). The map depicted two different versions of Kumari Kandam: that of Sastri, and that of A. Shanmugam Pillai (see above). The lost land was depicted as a peninsula, similar to the present-day Indian peninsula.Subramania Sastri 1915‚Äì16, 466‚Äì67. In 1927, Purnalingam Pillai published a map titled \\"Puranic India before the Deluges\\", in which he labeled the various places of Kumari Kandam with names drawn from ancient Tamil and Sanskrit literary works. Pulavar Kulanthai, in his 1946 map, was first to depict cities like Tenmaturai and Kapatapuram on the maps of Kumari Kandam. Several maps also depicted the various mountain ranges and rivers of Kumari Kandam. The most elaborate cartographic visualization appeared in a 1977 map by R. Mathivanan. This map showed the 49 nadus mentioned by Adiyarkunallar, and appears in the Tamil Nadu government's 1981 documentary. A 1981 map published by N. Mahalingam depicted the lost land as \\"Submerged Tamil Nadu\\" in 30,000 B.C.Mahalingam 1981b, 136‚Äì37. A 1991 map, created by R. Mathivanan, showed a land bridge connecting Indian peninsula to Antarctica. A few Tamil writers also depicted Gondwanaland as Kumari Kandam.  Criticism of the concept  Kumari Kandam is a mythical continent, and therefore, the attempts to mix this myth with Tamil history have attracted criticism since the late 19th century. One of the earliest criticisms came from M Seshagiri Sastri (1897), who described the claims of ante-diluvial sangams as \\"a mere fiction originated by the prolific imagination of Tamil poets.\\" CH Monahan wrote a scathing review of Suryanarayana Sastri's Tamilmoliyin Varalaru (1903), shortly after its publication, accusing the author of \\"abandoning scientific research for mythology\\". K. N. Sivaraja Pillai (1932) similarly stressed on the need to closely examine the historical authenticity of Sangam works and their commentaries. In 1956, K. A. Nilakanta Sastri described the Kumari Kandam theory as \\"all bosh\\", stating that geological theories about events happening millions of years ago should not be connected to the human history of a few thousand years back. Historian N. Subrahmanian, writing in 1966, described the Lemuria myth as the most characteristic example of \\"anti- history\\" in Tamil Nadu. He noted that these myths persisted in the minds of Tamil people despite modern education. According to him, the land lost to sea, as described in the ancient Tamil legends, was a small area comparable to a present-day district, and submerged around 5th or 4th century BCE. The same view is also shared by historian K. K. Pillay. He writes In popular culture Kandam (2016) is a Tamil Canadian/Sri Lankan film directed by Pras Lingam. The film is based on the premise of the existence of the continent of Kumari Kandam and the prevalence of Tamil civilization in antediluvian times. Kumari Kandam appeared in The Secret Saturdays episodes \\"The King of Kumari Kandam\\" and \\"The Atlas Pin\\". This version is a city on the back of a giant sea serpent with its inhabitants all fish people. Kumari Kandam appeared on Season Two, Episode Three of the History Channel television show Ancient Aliens. See alsoReferences ; Further reading Jayakaran, S. C.

He also received a religious education and eventually could recite the entire Qur'an from memory. He spoke both Arabic and English fluently. He concentrated his efforts on the Qur'an and studied the Qur'anic commentaries beginning with those written in the early days of Islamic history. Ali took a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature at the University of Bombay in January 1891 aged 19 and was awarded a Presidency of Bombay Scholarship to study at the University of Cambridge in England. Ali first went to Britain in 1891 to study Law at St John's College, Cambridge and after graduating BA and LL.B in 1895 he returned to India in the same year with a post in the Indian Civil Service (ICS), later being called to the Bar in Lincoln's Inn in 1896 in absentia. He received his MA and LL.M in 1901. He married Teresa Mary Shalders (1873‚Äì1956) at St Peter's Church in Bournemouth in 1900, and with her he had three sons and a daughter: Edris Yusuf Ali (1901‚Äì1992), Asghar Bloy Yusuf Ali (1902‚Äì1971), Alban Hyder Yusuf Ali (1904‚Äì), and Leila Teresa Ali (1906‚Äì).The Family of Abdullah Yusf Ali - Ancestry.com - pay to view His wife and children settled variously in Tunbridge Wells, St Albans and Norwich while Ali returned to his post in India.Famous Muslims of London on the British Muslim Heritage website He returned to Britain in 1905 on a two-year leave from the ICS and during this period he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and the Royal Society of Literature.Abdullah Yusuf Ali - 'Making Britain: Discover how South Asians shaped the nation, 1870-1950' - Open University Ali first came to public attention in Britain after he gave a lecture at the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1906, organised by his mentor Sir George Birdwood. Another mentor was Lord James Meston, formerly Lieutenant Governor of the United Provinces, who, when he was made Finance Member of the Government of India appointed Ali to positions in various districts in India which also involved two short periods as acting Under Secretary (1907) and then Deputy Secretary (1911‚Äì12) in the Finance Department of the Government of India.Abdullah Yusuf Ali - Biographical Dictionary on salaam.co.uk Family and career Abdullah Yusuf Ali in 1911 Khizar Humayun Ansari, his biographer on the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, wrote of Ali: > Yusuf Ali belonged to the group of Indian Muslims from professional families > who were concerned with rank and status. In pursuit of his aspiration for > influence, deference, if not outright obsequiousness, became a central > feature of his relationship with the British. During the formative phase of > his life he mingled mainly in upper-class circles, assiduously cultivating > relations with members of the English √©lite. He was particularly impressed > by the apparently genteel behaviour and cordiality of those with whom he > associated, and, as a result, became an incorrigible Anglophile.

His constant travelling between India and Britain took its toll on his marriage and his wife Teresa Mary Shalders was unfaithful to him and gave birth to an illegitimate child in 1910, causing him to divorce her in 1912Divorce of Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Teresa Mary Yusuf Ali (1912) - Ancestry.com - pay to view and gaining custody of their four children, whom he left with a governess in England. However, his children rejected him and on future visits to London during the 1920s and 1930s he stayed at the National Liberal Club.Ian Richard Netton, Encyclopedia of Islamic Civilisation and Religion, Routledge (2008) - Google Books pg 42 In 1914 Ali resigned from the ICS and settled in Britain where he became a Trustee of the Shah Jehan Mosque in Woking and in 1921 became a Trustee of the fund to build the East London Mosque. With the outbreak of World War I, unlike many Muslims in Britain who felt uncomfortable with supporting the British war effort against fellow Muslims of the Ottoman Empire, Ali was an enthusiastic supporter of the Indian contribution to the war effort, to that end writing articles, giving public speeches and undertaking a lecture tour of Scandinavia and was awarded a CBE in 1917 for his services to that cause. In the same year he joined the staff of the School of Oriental Studies as a lecturer in Hindustani. He married Gertrude Anne Mawbey (1895‚Äì1984) in 1920, and she having taken the Muslim name 'Masuma' returned with him to India to escape the harassment the couple suffered from Ali's children from his first marriage, who resented him and his new wife. In his will Ali specifically mentioned his second son Asghar Bloy Yusuf Ali who \\"has gone so far as to abuse, insult, vilify and persecute me from time to time.\\"M.A. Sherif, The Abdullah Yusuf Ali Memorial Lecture, Islamic Book Trust, Kuala Lumpur (2008) - Google Books pg 11 With Mawbey he had a son, Rashid (born 1922/3), but this marriage too ended in failure. He was a respected intellectual in India and Sir Muhammad Iqbal recruited him to be the Principal of Islamia College in Lahore, serving from 1925 to 1927 and again from 1935 to 1937. He was also a Fellow and syndic of the University of the Punjab (1925‚Äì8 and 1935‚Äì9) and a member of the Punjab University Enquiry Committee (1932‚Äì33). Among his publications were Muslim Educational Ideals (1923), Fundamentals of Islam (1929), Moral Education: Aims and Methods (1930), Personality of Man in Islam (1931), and The Message of Islam (1940). However, his best known scholarly work is his translation into English and commentary of the Qur'an, the Holy Qur'an: Text, Translation and Commentary (1934‚Äì8; revised edition 1939‚Äì40), which remains one of the two most widely used English versions (the other being the translation by Marmaduke Pickthall). He served on the Indian delegation to the League of Nations Assembly in 1928. Later years Grave of Abdullah Yusuf Ali in Brookwood Cemetery In December 1938 while on tour to promote his translation, Ali helped to open the Al-Rashid Mosque, the third mosque in North America, in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Canadian Islam Centre - History In 1947 Ali was among many Indians who returned to India after Independence to take up political posts. However, for him the move was not a success and he returned to London where he became increasingly frail in mind and body, living in isolation ignored by both his family and the British establishment who no longer had a use for him. Of no fixed abode, Ali spent most of the last decade of his life either living in the National Liberal Club, in the Royal Commonwealth Society or wandering about the streets of London and living in poverty despite having ¬£20,578 16s 3d in the bank.Probate Record for Abdullah Yusuf Ali (1954) - Ancestry.com - pay to view On 9 December 1953 Ali was found destitute and in a bewildered condition in a doorway in Westminster by the police who took him to Westminster Hospital. He was discharged the following day and was taken in by a London County Council home for the elderly in Dovehouse Street in Chelsea. Here he suffered a heart attack on 10 December and was rushed to St Stephen's Hospital in Fulham where he died alone the same day. No relatives claimed the body but Ali was known to the Pakistan High Commission; they arranged his funeral and burial in the Muslim section at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking, not far from the burial place of Marmaduke Pickthall. His estate, after various small legacies including one to his son Rashid Yusuf Ali, he bequeathed to the University of London for the benefit of Pakistani students studying at that institution. Ali's Quran translation There has been 30 printed versions of his Quran translation. Ali was a Shia in the Dawoodi Bohra tradition. The Ahlul Bayt Digital Islamic Library Project, whose \\"particular emphasis [is] on the Twelver Shi'ah Islamic school of thought\\", has analysed printings of Ali's translations to ascertain whether they have maintained Ali's understandings of the original Arabic text. They have determined there have been changes. In Saudi Arabia, The Presidency of Islamic Researches, has modified the original Yusuf Ali translation.

He was raised in Santa Monica, where he attended Mirman School\\"Where Bright Minds Can Shine\\", Elaine Woo, Los Angeles Times, November 22, 2000 and Santa Monica High School, graduating in 1974, and began college at age 14.Oversight Testimony ‚ÄúPatent Quality and Improvement‚Äù before the Subcommittee on the Courts, the Internet and Intellectual Property, House Committee on the Judiciary, United States Congress, April 28, 2005 Transferring from Santa Monica College, he studied mathematics, geophysics, and space physics at UCLA (B.Sc., Masters). He was awarded a Hertz Foundation Fellowship for graduate study and studied at Princeton University, where he earned a master's degree in mathematical economics and completed a Ph.D. in applied mathematics after completing a doctoral dissertation titled \\"Vistas in curved space-time quantum field theory\\" under the supervision of Malcolm Perry. For one year, he held a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Cambridge working under Stephen Hawking.  Career = Early career  Myhrvold left Cambridge to co-found a computer startup in Oakland, California. The company, Dynamical Systems Research Inc. (DSR), sought to produce Mondrian, a clone of IBM's TopView multitasking environment for DOS. Myhrvold served as DSR's president. Microsoft purchased DSR in 1986 for $1.5M in stock. Myhrvold worked at Microsoft for 13 years in a variety of executive positions, culminating in his appointment as the company's first chief technology officer in 1996. At Microsoft he founded Microsoft Research in 1991.  Intellectual Ventures  After Microsoft, in 2000 Myhrvold co-founded Intellectual Ventures, Wall Street Journal, September 15, 2008 a patent portfolio developer and broker in the areas of technology and energy, known as \\"the ultimate patent trolls,\\" by many in the business world, which has acquired over 30,000 patents. Mark Harris, The Sunday Times, May 16, 2010 Intellectual Ventures exploits the market for inventions and patents, buying patents from companies and inventors under the assumption the patents will be more valuable in the future. IV also files patents through the work of a team of on-site inventors. Startup companies spun out of IV, including Kymeta, Echodyne, and TerraPower, have developed commercial products from IV's inventions. Through its Global Good unit, which Myhrvold founded in collaboration with Bill Gates, IV has also invented and produced commercial products, such as improved vaccine coolers and milking cans, aimed at low-income markets in Africa and Asia. However, in most cases, IV's inventions are limited to the descriptions provided in their patents, which are bundled into portfolios for licensing. Myhrvold has described his goal for Intellectual Ventures as helping to create a market for patent-backed securities. Nathan Myhrvold, Intellectual Ventures, March 2010 The company's business practices have caused controversy, however, with some deprecating the firm as a patent troll. Ira Glass, NPR, July 24, 2011 Myhrvold has publicly defended his firm's practices, arguing that they foster innovation by serving as a marketplace for intellectual property. He has noted that many of the largest companies in Silicon Valley, including Google, Apple, and Facebook, have also bought large patent portfolios and used litigation to protect them, but he has criticized them as focusing too much on creating \\"tools or toys for rich people.\\"  Nuclear power  Myhrvold is vice chairman of TerraPower, a spin-out of Intellectual Ventures that is developing a new kind of nuclear reactor, known as a traveling-wave reactor, that is designed to be safer, cheaper, and cleaner than current nuclear power plants. In 2017, the company launched a joint venture with the China National Nuclear Corporation to build and operate a prototype reactor of this kind in Hebei province.  Science  In addition to his business activities, Myhrvold is a working scientist who has published original, peer-reviewed research in the fields of paleobiology, climate science, and astronomy. A prize-winning nature and wildlife photographer, he has also been involved with paleontological research on expeditions with the Museum of the Rockies. His work has appeared in scientific journals including Science, Nature, Paleobiology, PLOS One, and the Physical Review, as well as in Fortune, Time, Scientific American, National Geographic Traveler, and Slate. He and Peter Rinearson helped Bill Gates write The Road Ahead, a book about the future that reached No. 1 on the New York Times bestseller list in 1995 and 1996. Myhrvold has contributed $1 million to the nonprofit SETI Institute in Mountain View, CA, for the development of the Allen Telescope Array, which was envisioned to be the most powerful instrument for SETI. After the Science Museum in London successfully built the computing section of Charles Babbage's Difference Engine #2 in 1991, Myhrvold funded the construction of the output section, which performs both printing and stereotyping of calculated results. He also commissioned the construction of a second complete Difference Engine #2 for himself, which was on display at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, from May 10, 2008 to January 31, 2016 and currently resides in the Intellectual Ventures Laboratory.Difference Engine Leaves Computer History Museum, Mark Moack, Mountain View Voice, January 28, 2016 In research presented at scientific conferences and published in the astronomy journal Icarus, Myhrvold has been a vocal critic of procedures and results about asteroid diameters published by the NEOWISE team.Myhrvold, Nathan P. \\"An Empirical Examination of WISE/NEOWISE Asteroid Analyses and Results\\".

Cooking  Fistful of liquid nitrogen; Nathan Myhrvold magical science dinner While working as chief technology officer at Microsoft, Myhrvold took leave to earn his culinary diploma from √âcole de Cuisine La Varenne in France. Myhrvold's early culinary training was as an observer and unpaid apprentice at Rover's, one of Seattle's leading restaurants, with Chef Thierry Rautureau. Myhrvold is the principal author of a culinary text entitled Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking, released in March 2011, on the application of scientific research principles and new techniques and technology to cooking. That book, which earned a James Beard Foundation Award for \\"cookbook of the year\\" in 2012, was followed by the books Modernist Cuisine at Home, The Photography of Modernist Cuisine, and Modernist Bread: The Art and Science, all self-published by Myhrvold and with him as lead author. Myhrvold was part of a team that won first place at the world barbecue championships in Memphis. He has appeared as a guest judge on Top Chef.  Advocacy  In interviews with CNN, SuperFreakonomics author Stephen Dubner, and Scientific American, Myhrvold has discussed ways to reverse some of the effects of global warming/climate change by using geoengineering. Myhrvold and other inventors working with Intellectual Ventures have proposed several approaches, including one that would use hoses, suspended from helium balloons above the Earth at high latitudes, to emit sulfur dioxide, which is known to scatter light. Another approach would stimulate the formation and brightening of marine clouds to reflect more sunlight back into space. Controversy In the popular press, Myhrvold and Intellectual Ventures have been repeatedly accused of acting as patent trolls and stifling innovation by buying patents and then forcing inventors to license their ideas by means of litigation. Walt Mossberg interviewed Myhrvold about Intellectual Ventures' role as a \\"patent troll\\" during the 10th annual All Things Digital conference. This American Life's Laura Sydell ran an investigative story about patent trolling and Intellectual Ventures' role in that business. According to The New York Times, Intellectual Ventures at one point controlled nearly 70,000 intellectual property assets (patents and patents pending) that it has used to generate approximately $3 billion in revenues, primarily in the form of license fees from large corporations. The company responds that it has returned more than $500 million to individual inventors and most of the remaining revenues to its investors.

Originally a branch of the Taira clan and descended from Taira no Takamochi, they fell victim to political intrigue in 1205, when Hatakeyama Shigeyasu, first, and his father Shigetada later were killed in battle by H≈çj≈ç forces in Kamakura. After 1205 the Hatakeyama came to be descendants of the Ashikaga clan, who were in turn descended from Emperor Seiwa (850‚Äì880) and the Seiwa Genji branch of the Minamoto clan. History The first family being extinct in 1205, Ashikaga Yoshizumi, son of Ashikaga Yoshikane, was chosen by H≈çj≈ç Tokimasa to revive the name of Hatakeyama. He married Tokimasa's daughter, the widow of Hatakeyama Shigeyasu (the last Hatakeyama of the first branch), and inherited the domains of the Hatakeyama (1205). Thus the new family descended from the Minamoto (Seiwa Genji). The clan was an ally of the Ashikaga shogunate against the (Imperial) Southern Court during the wars of the Nanboku-ch≈ç period, and was rewarded by the shogunate with the hereditary position of shugo (Governor) of the provinces of Yamashiro, Kii, Kawachi, Etch≈´, and Noto, at the end of the 14th century. During the 15th century, the members of the Hatakeyama clan held, although not exclusively, the title of kanrei (Sh≈çgun's Deputy), holding great influence over the Imperial Court at Kyoto. Around 1450, there was a split in the clan, and the internal conflict weakened the clan as a whole, causing it to lose the position of kanrei to the Hosokawa clan. This split began with a feud between Hatakeyama Masanaga and Hatakeyama Yoshinari over succession to the position; it quickly grew, as each side gained allies, and was one of the sparks that ignited the ≈ånin War. Nevertheless, the Hatakeyama maintained enough strength and unity to become some of Oda Nobunaga's chief adversaries in Kyoto, a hundred years later. Sengoku period By the time of the Sengoku period, the Hatakeyama clan had split into many scattered branches. The most notable of these resided in Kawachi, Mutsu, and Noto provinces. The Kawachi-Hatakeyama were split into two main rival branches descended from Hatakeyama Masanaga and Hatakeyama Yoshinari. The Mutsu-Hatakeyama held Nihonmatsu Castle saw its power gradually diminish over the course of the Sengoku period, becoming vassals of the Ashina clan. The Mutsu-Hatakeyama frequently clashed with the Date clan until they were largely destroyed by Date Masamune in 1586 following the Battle of Hitotoribashi. The Noto-Hatakeyama were based at Nanao Castle and fell from power as an independent house in the 1570s due to internal strife.

The game was included in the compilations: Mega Games 2, Mega Drive 6 Pak, Sega Classics Arcade Collection (for the Sega CD), and Sega Smash Pack (for the PC and Dreamcast). It was also re-released for the Wii Virtual Console in 2009, on the PlayStation 3 via PlayStation Network and Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade download services in 2012, and for iOS and Android devices in 2017 via Sega Forever.  Plot  Taking place three years after the first game, the criminal organization Zeed from the original game has since reformed and have renamed themselves \\"Neo Zeed\\". They decide to have their revenge on the Oboro Ninja clan and Joe Musashi by killing his master and kidnapping Joe's bride. Joe, having reached the clan too late, manages to learn about Neo Zeed's plot by his dying master. Joe decides to travel the world to gain his revenge on Neo Zeed as well as try to save his bride before it's too late.  Gameplay  The game is a traditional side-scrolling platform game. The player controls Joe Musashi and must complete eight districts before the final confrontation with the head of Neo Zeed. Each district consists of three scenes, two of which are platforming levels and the third being a battle against a unique boss character. The directional pad moves Joe around while the A, B, and C buttons are used to perform ninjutsu techniques, attack and jump, respectively. A key move in The Revenge of Shinobi is the somersault, which maximizes Joe's jumping height and enables him to throw eight shuriken at once in mid-air. Additionally, some stages consist of multiple layers, such as the first scene of the Military Base and the freeway in Area Code 818. Switching between layers is also done with the somersault move. Alongside his standard moves and attacks, Joe has the ability to do four special ninjutsu techniques. Only one can be performed in each level, unless a ninjutsu item was picked up, or the ninjutsu of Mijin was used. A variety of bonus crates can be found in each level, some hidden in the scenery. These include simple powerups such as extra shuriken or health packs, as well as special items to gain lives or extra ninjutsu attacks. Besides powerups, some crates may contain time bombs: explosives that detonate when their fuse runs out or if Joe comes too close (though he can walk out of the blast radius if the player is quick enough). The game is divided into four difficulties. As difficulty increases, more enemies appear per stage; on Hardest, Joe takes twice as much damage and the number of starting lives decreases from 10 to 1. From the options menu, the player can also choose the number of starting shuriken from 0 to 90 (though a technique does exist that allows infinite shuriken). The game has two different endings, depending on whether Joe rescues his bride or not. Batman in The Revenge of Shinobi  Development  The game's director Noriyoshi Ohba intended Revenge of Shinobi to be a showcase for the then-new Genesis hardware as well as to adapt the series to something better suited for a home console. As a result, the game is more story-driven with Joe Musashi not rescuing multiple hostages in each level as in the original game, but a single hostage at the end. A life bar was introduced as being more appropriate for a console game of that scope. Ohba intended Revenge of Shinobi to have a high level of difficulty to get the player to think about how they could best beat the game. The game's ninja magic was intended to be helpful in particular situations or boss encounters, making certain parts of the game much easier if the player knew which ninja magic to use at what time. Some of the game's enemies are notably too similar to various characters from film and comic books, a fact that Ohba attributes to his own lack of creativity. He made rough sketches of these characters based on what he had in mind at the time, expecting that the character designer would modify them and add their own creative touches for the final game. However, they did not, resulting in some enemy characters who were similar to the likes of Sylvester Stallone, Batman, Spider-Man, and Godzilla. Release Because of copyright issues regarding certain enemy characters (many of which were based on cultural icons) there were at least four versions of the game in Japan and North America, with the later two also appearing in Europe. * Software revision 1.00 (1989): Enemy characters resembling Rambo called \\"Rocky\\", Jackie Chan, The Terminator called \\"Hercules\\" in Japan and \\"Master Attacker\\" in the West, Spider-Man, Batman, and Godzilla called \\"Monster-G\\" are present. Both Spider-Man and Batman are actually fake representations of the characters conducted by a shapeshifter named \\"Metamorpher\\" who alters his appearance after sustaining a certain amount of damage. Additionally, Joe Musashi's face on the title sequence resembled that of actor Sonny Chiba dressed as his character Hattori Hanz≈ç from the Japanese TV series Shadow Warriors (Kage no Gundan). * Software revision 1.01 (1989): The fake Spider-Man is now redesigned into the licensed character from Marvel Comics. Since he is now the real Spider-Man, he does not morph into Batman. Instead, Spider-Man leaves the battle when enough damage is inflicted and Batman is replaced by a winged Devilman-like creature. Monster-G remains unmodified. The \\"Gunner\\" enemy soldiers with flamethrowers are also changed to bald men with headbands, altering their original likeness to Rambo (although Sega had the license to the character for their Rambo III console games, they did not use it for this game). * Software revision 1.02 (1990): A new copyright screen is made to acknowledge the license to Spider-Man (Sega already had the license to the character for their game The Amazing Spider-Man vs. The Kingpin) and the music composition by Yuzo Koshiro. Monster-G still remains intact. * Software revision 1.03 (1990): Monster-G is redesigned into a skeletal dinosaur. Everything else remains intact from the previous revision, including the licensed use of Spider-Man. This version was used in the Genesis 6-Pak cartridge along with the \\"Sega Classics\\" edition of the game. * Software revision 1.04 (2009/2012): Since the licensed use of the boss Spider-Man was for a limited period of time, the game was subsequently prevented from being re-released years later. The 2009 release for the Virtual Console as well as the Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network 2012 releases feature a new software revision (1.04) that omits the Marvel copyright notice and replaces Spider-Man with a pink palette swap of the character that still behaves the same as the licensed Spider-Man. Joe Musashi's design in the title screen was also altered to remove his likeness to Sonny Chiba. The credit roll, shown when achieving a \\"good\\" ending, was removed from the non-Japanese versions of the game. In versions 1.00 and 1.01, \\"¬©SEGA 1989 / MUSIC ¬©1989 YUZO KOSHIRO\\" would be shown at the bottom of the title screen like normal; when the Spider-Man copyright notice was added to the game, all copyright bylines were moved to a screen displayed before the intro. Sega Smash Pack The version included in volume 1 of the PC Smash Pack collection appears to be a prototype version. The internal ROM date says March 1989, and the product number is filled with zeroes. In the notes section of the ROM header (at 0x1C8), there is the string, \\"A0115 Sega_Channel\\", whereas all other releases have that area filled with ASCII space characters. The header is also only marked as being a Japanese release, while all other versions are marked as Japanese, US, and European. The title screen always uses The Super Shinobi regardless of the console region. The game has an invincibility mode in the options screen, and a level select at the main menu. Enabling invincibility also gives infinite lives from falling offscreen, going out open doors, and using Mijin (it also prevents the player from gaining lives). There are other changes found in the options menu: the shuriken option is spelled \\"syurikin\\" (in other versions, it is spelled \\"shurikin\\"), and the sound test option lacks music titles, showing only a hex number (in other versions, sound effects are numbered in decimal). There is no copyright screen. The introduction uses the final version Round 1 music (The Shinobi) instead of its own theme. The sound effect when Musashi changes his grip does not play, and the sparks when shuriken hit the sword stay on screen longer. There are no demos other than the opening animation (i.e. no plot text or gameplay demos). Using Mijin uses up ninjutsu; in other versions, ninjutsu is still available after using Mijin. Mijin also remains selected after it has been used, instead of switching to Ikazuchi. There is also no shouting sound effect when ninjutsu are activated. The final game has 19 music tracks, but this version only has the first seven (the order of music in the sound test is unchanged). Because of this, there are differences in what music is used for what round, but even when the music is in all versions, different tracks are used. The music used in 1-1 is China Beat, and 1-2's music is \\"Make Me Dance\\" while, in the final version, both stages use The Shinobi. The game over screen has no music and is missing the Masked Ninja's laughter. The drum samples used throughout the game are also different. For the most part, the enemies resemble the REV00 versions including the two-phase fight with Metamorpher, appearing as an imposter Spider-Man and Batman. Some bosses appear incomplete. Monster-G, the boss of Round 7, seems to be invincible, and the fight ends after the boss goes through a few attacks. The Round 3 and 8 bosses appear to be missing completely (although the maps themselves are there); the game switches to the end of the level screen shortly after starting. There is no ending either: the game loops back to Round 1 after 8-3. Reception The game received 5 out of 5 stars in Dragon; the final boss battle was criticised, however, for being too difficult. MegaTech magazine praised the \\"smart gameplay, graphics and sound\\". Mega placed the game at #18 in their Top Mega Drive Games of All Time.Top 100, Mega magazine issue 1, page 76, Future Publishing, Oct 1992 Reviewing the game's appearance in Sega Arcade Classics, Glenn Rubenstein said it \\"was one of the first Genesis games released, and it shows how far Sega has come since then.\\" In 1997 Electronic Gaming Monthly ranked Revenge of Shinobi the 83rd best console video game of all time, saying it \\"packs fantastic level design and even better gameplay.\\" They also praised the novelty of battling obvious clones of Spider-Man, Batman, the Terminator, and Godzilla. Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. Sequel A sequel to The Revenge of Shinobi, titled Shinobi III: Return of the Ninja Master, was released in 1993. Legacy A suite of music from the game was performed live by an orchestra at the Fourth Symphonic Game Music Concert in 2006 at the Gewandhaus zu Leipzig, Germany. The arrangement was done by original composer Yuzo Koshiro. Music from The Revenge of Shinobi was also performed at two concerts of PLAY! A Video Game Symphony in Stockholm, Sweden in 2007. It was also played during the encore as the most voted song when PLAY! A Video Game Symphony was performing in Singapore (June 2007). Sound effects from the game were also used in the Heavy Shinobi fight in Sonic Mania.

Their debut full-length album, No Fools, No Fun, was released on July 15, 2014, through Blue Note Records. History=Formation (2008-2013) The group formed in 2008 when Jones began playing Brooklyn venues to practice guitar, with the help of Dobson. They were then joined by Popper, and the three began working together to expand creatively. Some of the group's early shows were in front of friends and done just for fun as they covered songs they loved. In an interview with The Boston Globe published July 17, 2014, Jones describes the first shows as \\"never stressful because it was loose and nobody was coming but our friends.\\" Dobson adds, \\"We were just playing shows and coming together as our schedules went along. It was just about playing music and not having an agenda of any kind.\\" In a July 2014 interview with SiriusXM, they described the formation of the band: > \\"Sasha booked a gig at a pool hall for us to learn guitar on ... So, that‚Äôs > how we started playing guitar, because Sasha and I, we were already > singers,\\" said Norah. \\"We learned enough chords on guitar to get Catherine > here to play with us ... We played a lot of gigs when we were all in town > just kinda to get together and have fun. And then finally we sounded like a > band enough to where we thought we‚Äôd make a record.\\" Since the group came together each member has made attempts at trying new instruments they weren't previously accustomed to. For Jones and Dobson it was guitar (and also drums for Dobson), and for Popper it was pedal steel guitar. No Fools, No Fun (2014-present) After years of playing small and occasional shows around New York City, the band decided in early 2014 to make a full-length album. On April 21, 2014, a Blue Note Records press release announced that the band would release its debut full-length album, titled \\"No Fools, No Fun\\", on July 15, 2014. In support of the album, Puss n Boots toured during the summer and fall of 2014.

Overview The duration gap is a financial and accounting term and is typically used by banks, pension funds, or other financial institutions to measure their risk due to changes in the interest rate. This is one of the mismatches that can occur and are known as asset‚Äìliability mismatches. Another way to define Duration Gap is: it is the difference in the price sensitivity of interest-yielding assets and the price sensitivity of liabilities (of the organization) to a change in market interest rates (yields). The duration gap measures how well matched are the timings of cash inflows (from assets) and cash outflows (from liabilities). When the duration of assets is larger than the duration of liabilities, the duration gap is positive. In this situation, if interest rates rise, assets will lose more value than liabilities, thus reducing the value of the firm's equity. If interest rates fall, assets will gain more value than liabilities, thus increasing the value of the firm's equity. Conversely, when the duration of assets is less than the duration of liabilities, the duration gap is negative. If interest rates rise, liabilities will lose more value than assets, thus increasing the value of the firm's equity. If interest rates decline, liabilities will gain more value than assets, thus decreasing the value of the firm's equity. By duration matching, that is creating a zero duration gap, the firm becomes immunized against interest rate risk. Duration has a double-facet view. It can be beneficial or harmful depending on where interest rates are headed. Some of the limitations of duration gap management include the following: * the difficulty in finding assets and liabilities of the same duration * some assets and liabilities may have patterns of cash flows that are not well defined * customer prepayments may distort the expected cash flows in duration * customer defaults may distort the expected cash flows in duration * convexity can cause problems. Duration \\\\ gap = duration \\\\ of \\\\ earning \\\\ assets \\\\ - \\\\ duration \\\\ of \\\\ paying \\\\ liabilities \\\\ \\\\times \\\\ \\\\frac{paying \\\\ liabilities}{earning \\\\ assets} When the duration gap is zero, the firm is immunized only if the size of the liabilities equals the size of the assets. In this example with a two-year loan of one million and a one-year asset of two millions, the firm is still exposed to rollover risk after one year when the remaining year of the two-year loan has to be financed. 0 = 1 - 2 \\\\times \\\\frac{1,000,000}{2,000,000} See also * List of finance topics * Bond convexity * The duration difference is also shown by sorting into maturity buckets as in the table How the example bank manages its liquidity References Banking Insurance Liability (financial accounting) Asset management Fixed income analysis ","title":"Duration gap"},{"id":"1353258","text":"Upton Park is an area of the East London borough of Newham, centred on Green Street which is the boundary between West Ham and East Ham. West Ham United Football Club formerly played at the Boleyn Ground, commonly known as Upton Park. The term ‚ÄòUpton Park‚Äô first applied to a housing estate developed to the east of West Ham Park in the 1880s. The estate took its name from the adjacent village of Upton with the suffix ‚ÄòPark‚Äô added for marketing reasons. The estate's developers paid for a new station to be built which was named after the estate. As a consequence, the area surrounding the station became known as Upton Park rather than the term being limited to the original housing estate. Football The southern end of Green Street runs alongside the western edge of the former Boleyn Ground, the original home ground of West Ham United FC. The club initially rented the land from Green Street House, known locally as Boleyn Castle because of its imposing nature and an association with Anne Boleyn. The football stadium was commonly known as Upton Park. After the 2015‚Äì16 season, West Ham relocated to the former Olympic Stadium in Stratford and the Boleyn Ground has now been demolished. An unrelated football club of the area, Upton Park FC, were early pioneers in the game, and represented Great Britain at the 1900 Summer Olympics football tournament, where they won the gold medal. They played their home games at West Ham Park, which was host to the first ever FA Cup goal, scored by Jarvis Kenrick for Clapham Rovers in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Upton Park on 11 November 1871. Upton Park F.C was founded in 1866, and is believed to have folded for the second and last time around 1911, while West Ham United were founded as Thames Ironworks F.C. in 1895, before reforming as West Ham in 1900, playing their first games at Upton Park, the Boleyn Ground, from 1904. Transport On the London Underground network, the southern area near the Boleyn Ground is served by Upton Park tube station, in Green Street, on the District and Hammersmith and City lines. On the overground rail network, Forest Gate railway station on the Great Eastern Main Line served by TfL Rail, and Wanstead Park railway station on the Gospel Oak to Barking Line served by the London Overground, are both near the northern end of Green Street. On the road network, Green Street itself runs on a north- south axis, linking the A118 Romford Road in the north and the A124 Barking Road in the south, both major arterial routes linking central London to the eastern counties. Retail Many shops in the area cater for east London's large Asian community. Queens Road Market is a covered food and clothing market on Queens Road, off Green Street near the tube station. It was formerly a large open-air street market until the current structure was built in the 1980s. Priory Park Upton Park also contains a green space, Priory Park , extending from the north east corner of the Boleyn Ground. Administration Green Street is a former tramway which divided the former Essex County Boroughs of East Ham and West Ham. The Upton Park area is in the London Borough of Newham, but it is not the name of any of its electoral wards. It is roughly encompassed by the wards Green Street East/West in the north, and Plaistow North/South and Boleyn in the south.Ward Profiles, Newham Information Management System, accessed 6 May 2010 ReferencesExternal links Districts of the London Borough of Newham Areas of London East Ham West Ham de:Upton Park ","title":"Upton Park, London"},{"id":"1353277","text":"King of Kings is a 1961 American Biblical epic film made by Samuel Bronston Productions and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Directed by Nicholas Ray, the film is a dramatization of the story of Jesus of Nazareth from his birth and ministry to his crucifixion and resurrection, with much dramatic license. In November 1958, the idea for King of Kings began as a proposed film project based on the life of Jesus between Samuel Bronston and John Farrow following their collaboration on John Paul Jones (1959). However, by the next year, Farrow left the project due to creative differences, and Nicholas Ray was shortly after hired as director. Ray then hired screenwriter Philip Yordan to write a new script. Prominent actors were considered to portray multiple roles. Filming commenced in April 1960, and wrapped in October 1960. Financing of the film was initially provided by Pierre S. du Pont III, but Bronston appealed for more funding from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer who was interested in the film following their success with Ben-Hur (1959). With MGM involved, mandatory rewrites and additional scenes were added to the film. Reshoots were shot in December 1960 and again in May 1961. The film premiered at Loew's State Theatre in New York City on October 11, 1961. It received mixed reviews from film critics, but was a box office success. Plot In 63 BC, Pompey conquered Jerusalem and the city was sacked. He entered the Temple to seize the treasure of Solomon and massacred the priests there. He discovered that the treasure is only a collection of scrolls of the Torah. These Pompey held over a fire until an old priest reached for them imploringly. Pompey relented and handed them to the old man and left to carry out massacres of enemy villages and towns. Many years later, a series of rebellions break out against the authority of Rome, so the Romans crucify many of the leaders and place Herod the Great on Judea's throne. A carpenter named Joseph and his wife Mary, who is about to give birth, arrive in Bethlehem for the census. Not having found accommodation for the night, they take refuge in a stable, where the child, Jesus, is born. The shepherds, who have followed the Magi from the East, gather to worship him. However, Herod, informed of the birth of a child- king, orders the centurion Lucius to take his men to Bethlehem and kill all the newborn male children. Mary and Joseph flee to Egypt with the child. The Massacre of the Innocents occurs, Herod dies, killed in his death throes by his son Herod Antipas, who then takes power. In Nazareth, Jesus, who is now twelve years old, is working with Joseph when soldiers arrive under the command of Lucius, who realizes that Jesus escaped the massacre of the infants. But Lucius does nothing and only asks that Mary and Joseph register their son's birth before the year's end. Years pass and Jewish rebels led by Barabbas and Judas Iscariot prepare to attack a caravan carrying the next governor of Judea, Pontius Pilate and his wife Claudia. The ambush fails, partly due to the diligence of Lucius, and Barabbas and Judas flee for their lives. Pilate and Herod Antipas meet on the banks of the River Jordan, where John the Baptist preaches to the crowds. Jesus arrives here, now 30 years of age. He is baptized by John, who recognizes that he is the Messiah. Jesus goes into the desert, where he is tempted by Satan. After forty days, Jesus travels to Galilee, where he recruits his Apostles. In Jerusalem, Herod Antipas arrests John the Baptist, who is visited by Jesus in prison. Judas leaves the rebel Barabbas and joins the Apostles. Jesus begins to preach and gather crowds, among which are Claudia, Pilate's wife, and Lucius. Herod reluctantly beheads John on a whim of his stepdaughter, Salome, who despises him. Herod, Pilate and the High Priest Caiaphas are terrorized by the works and miracles of Jesus. Barabbas plots a revolt in Jerusalem during Passover, during which time Jesus enters the holy city in triumph and goes to the Temple to preach. The rebels storm the Antonia Fortress, but the legions of Pilate, having learned of the plot, ambush and crush the revolt, massacring the rebels. Barabbas ends up arrested. Jesus meets the disciples on the evening of Thursday, having supper one last time with them and afterwards goes to pray at Gethsemane. In the meantime, Judas wants Jesus to free Judea from the Romans, and, to force his hand, Judas delivers him to the Jewish authorities. Jesus is brought before Caiaphas and then brought before Pilate. Pilate starts the trial, but sensing that the issue is one of Jewish sensibilities, sends him to Herod Antipas, who, in turn, sends him back. Pilate is infuriated by Antipas' returning of Jesus and commands his soldiers to scourge Jesus. The people demand the release of Barabbas, and Pilate bows to their pressure and sentences Jesus to be crucified. Jesus, wearing a crown of thorns on his head, carries his cross to Golgotha where he is crucified with two thieves, one of them being the penitent thief Dismas. Desperate because he has betrayed Jesus to his death, Judas hangs himself and his body is found by Barabbas. Jesus dies in front of his mother, the apostle John, a few soldiers, Claudia (Pilate's wife), and Lucius (who utters the fateful words: \\"He is truly the Christ\\"). His body is taken down from the cross and is carried to a rock tomb. Two days later, Mary Magdalene finds the tomb empty, and encounters the Risen Jesus. The film ends on the shores of Lake Tiberias when Jesus appears to the Apostles for \\"a final time\\" according to the narration, and tells them to bring his message to the ends of the world. Only his shadow is visible, forming the shape of a cross where it falls on the stretched-out fishing nets. The apostles then leave, and, as the shadow of Jesus falls across the screen, it could be assumed that he is ascending to Heaven.

Production=Development In November 1958, it was reported that Samuel Bronston and John Farrow were collaborating on a film project based on the life of Jesus, with Farrow's script being titled Son of Man. In May 1959, it was reported that Sonya Levien was hired to do a script polish. However, by October 1959, Farrow had left the project over creative differences. Farrow later explained that in the context of Jesus's trial, Bronston wanted him to \\"whitewash the Jewish leaders, and lay blame entirely on the Romans. I refused to make these changes. I quit.\\" Additionally, according to associate producer Alan Brown, he stated that \\"his script was not really a script, it was the Four Gospels put down, and Sam called me and said, 'I cannot even understand this, it's all Thee and Thou and everything else.'\\" In November 1959, Nicholas Ray signed on to direct the project. With set construction nearly complete, Ray then asked screenwriter Philip Yordan whom he previously worked with on Johnny Guitar (1954) to rewrite the script. Ray also explained, \\"I asked for him and made concessions to have him. They had asked me to write it. I didn't feel up to the responsibility; I am as impatient with the other writer on my own screenplay as with others.\\"Scheuer, Philip K (December 21, 1960). \\"Ray Tells Directing of 'King of Kings'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part III, pg. 9 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. Yordan recalled, \\"I didn't want to go to Spain, but he asked me to just come over there for the weekend. The picture was called Son of Man. Terrible title, and someone had taken chapters of the Bible and sort of tried to make it play.\\" He then recommended re-titling the script to King of Kings. Yordan wrote a new script in six weeks which Bronston liked so much that he encouraged him to stay in Madrid, in which Yordan later went to co-write the script for El Cid (1961). Throughout the writing process, Yordan felt he did not find writing the movie to be difficult, in which he argued that \\"Christ was a loner. He's not much different than my usual character. The Western character. It's the same character. The man alone.\\" Furthermore, Bronston hired several Biblical scholars in order for the script to adhere to the Gospels, which included playwright Diego Fabbri and theologian professor George Kilpatrick who wrote the books The Origins of the Gospel According to St. Matthew (1946) and The Trial of Jesus (1953). In March 1960, Bronston received approval of the script from Pope John XXIII, who met with the producer at the Vatican. Casting Jeffrey Hunter as Jesus in King of Kings Several actors were considered to play the role of Jesus. In May 1959, it was reported that Alec Guinness had met with Bronston to discuss playing the role of Jesus. With Nicholas Ray as director, he considered Peter Cushing, Tom Fleming, Christopher Plummer, and Max von Sydow (who would later play the role in The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965)) for the role of Jesus. Ultimately, on April 21, 1960, Jeffrey Hunter was cast as Jesus. The idea to hire Hunter for the role came from John Ford, who suggested him to Nicholas Ray after directing him on The Searchers (1956). Ray also knew Hunter as he had directed him in The True Story of Jesse James (1957). Bronston agreed to the casting mainly because of the actor's striking eyes explaining that \\"I really chose him for his eyes. It was important that the man playing Christ have memorable eyes.\\" After he finished filming for Hell to Eternity (1960), Hunter was approached for the role after being given the script to which he agreed. Other prominent actors were pursued for supporting roles. In April 1960, it was reported that Orson Welles and Richard Burton were cast as Herod the Great and Herod Antipas respectively. Alternately, on April 21, on the same day as Hunter's casting, it was reported that Burton was attached to play a centurion and James Mason was being considered for Pontius Pilate.Scheuer, Philip K. (April 21, 1960) \\"Harvey Says Show Business Kids Itself\\" Los Angeles Times. Part III, pg. 11. ‚Äì via Newspapers.com However, in the following month, Burton left the role when he was refused to be given top billing. In May 1960, Grace Kelly had turned down the offer to portray Mary, mother of Jesus, in which the role later went to Siobh√°n McKenna while Hurd Hatfield was cast as Pontius Pilate. That same month, it was announced that Viveca Lindfors, Rita Gam, Frank Thring, and Ron Randell had joined the cast. Filming and post- production In 1959, Bronston had established his eponymous production studio in Spain where he observed the rugged countryside resembled Judea. Principal photography began on April 24, 1960 at the Sevilla and Charmartin studios, near Madrid, Spain where 396 sets were constructed for the film. Unfortunately, the Temple of Judea set at the Sevilla studios was blown down during a major windstorm. Bronston surveyed the site and ordered for the set to be rebuilt which was completed in three months. The film was shot on multiple locations throughout Spain, one of which included the Venta de Frascuelas near the rocky terrains of Chinch√≥n for the Sermon on the Mount scene where 7,000 extras were used. The El Fresno was used to represent the Jordan River, as well as the Rambla de Lanujar in Almer√≠a for the wilderness where Jesus was tempted. The A√±over de Tajo within the province of Toledo was substituted for the Mount of Olives. The municipalities of Manzanares el Real and Navacerrada were shot for the scenes set in Nazareth and Golgotha, the site where Jesus was crucified respectively. The film's shoot faced numerous complications. As with John Paul Jones (1959), Bronston secured the financing backing from business executive Pierre S. du Pont III, but months into the shoot, the production had run out of money. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer became interested in investing as they saw the film as a potential rival to Ben-Hur (1959), which was still in wide release. MGM studio president Joseph Vogel visited the set in Madrid and viewed dailies of the unfinished film. Coming away impressed, he alerted production head Sol C. Siegel of the production in which he also visited the set. Siegel recommended various changes feeling the film was too long, needed more action, and had a weak ending. An original Jewish Zealot character named \\"David\\" portrayed by Richard Johnson was written into the film who was function as a bridge between the film's plot threads. Due to the heavy deviations being made to the film's shooting script, Nicholas Ray and Philip Yordan were no longer on speaking terms communicating only through walkie-talkies. Midway during filming, in July 1960, cinematographer Franz Planer had fallen ill. Manuel Berengeur, who had worked with him since the start of production, replaced him, but MGM sent out contract cinematographer Milton R. Krasner to take over. In September, an automobile accident resulted in the death of Arthur Resse, who had been serving as a horse trainer, while also injuring actor Harry Guardino (who was portraying Barabbas) as the two were en route from a location outside Aranjuez, Spain.\\"Film Worker Killed, Actor Hunt in Spain\\". (September 18, 1960) Los Angeles Times. Section A, pg. 2 ‚Äì via Newspapers.com Around the same time, Ray, who was overwhelmed with the production woes, was temporarily replaced by Charles Walters. In October 1960, filming wrapped after 122 days. During the film's post-production, the editing was done at the MGM studios in Culver City, California. At the studio's requests, certain scenes were re-shot and added, and among of the edits made was the deletion of Richard Johnson's scenes. Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa was hired to compose the score, which was recorded using a 74-piece symphony orchestra and a choir of 50 people. Ray Bradbury was brought in to construct a new ending as well as write narration in order to connect the disparate elements together. Bradbury wrote an ending in which the resurrected Jesus commissions the disciples to preach the Gospel. Then, he elevates as he walks towards the horizontal shores of Galilee leaving only his visible footprints to be covered with blowing dust. The disciples would also leave footprints in all four directions to be covered with dust. However, the ending was deemed too expensive to be filmed. Orson Welles was hired to provide the voice-over narration, which was recorded in London. Welles insisted on pronouncing the word 'apostles' with a hard 't', instead of the normally silent 't'. Following a sneak preview, the studio felt another scene between Siobh√°n McKenna and Carmen Sevilla was needed, in which the scene was shot on the MGM's Boreham Wood studios in London on May 8, 1961. Release In June 1960, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had acquired the distribution rights to the film with their intention to distribute the film for a roadshow theatrical release as a follow-up to Ben-Hur (1959). Home media King of Kings was released to DVD by Warner Home Video on February 6, 2003 and Blu-ray by Warner Home Video on July 28, 2009 and on March 29, 2011, respectively as a Region 1 widescreen disc. It has since been available for online streaming and download through Amazon, Apple iTunes Store and Vudu. At present, WB/Turner is the rights holder via its pre-1986 MGM holdings. Reception=Critical reaction Time wrote a negative review describing the film as \\"[i]ncontestably the corniest, phoniest, ickiest and most monstrously vulgar of all the big Bible stories Hollywood has told in the last decade\\". Bosley Crowther of The New York Times felt that the movie had \\"the nature of an illustrated lecture\\" and was a \\"peculiarly impersonal film that constructs a great deal of random action around Jesus and does very little to construct a living personality for Him.\\" Variety, which praised the film as \\"a major motion picture by any standard\\" that not only \\"succeeds as spectacle\\" but also \\"succeeds in touching the heart.\\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times wrote, \\"It is not great art, nor is it the definitive photoplay about Jesus (will there ever be one?), but it is at least permeated by a soberness of purpose that, allowing for ordinary human fallibility, can be tacitly felt and respected. Technically, of course, it is far glossier than the C. B. DeMille movie of 1927, and very probably at least its equal in effectiveness. Dramatically, I think, it falls somewhere between the theatrical entertainment that was Ben-Hur and the spiritual but spiritless Francis of Assisi.\\"Scheuer, Philip K. (October 13, 1961). \\"Reverence Shines in 'King of Kings'\\". Los Angeles Times. Part I, p. 29. ‚Äì via Newspapers.com. Harrison's Reports awarded its top grade of \\"Excellent\\" and declared that the film \\"will not only stamp its enduring imprint on the glorious history book of the motion picture industry, but will leave its memorable impact on the minds of all those millions who see it.\\" Richard L. Coe of The Washington Post, however, panned the film as \\"a picture which never should have been made\\" due to the filmmakers' decision to present Jesus as \\"a universal, non-controversial figure,\\" explaining that \\"to excise His dynamic, revolutionary concepts is to make His journey on earth a hollow ritual, a pointless fairy tale, an essay on How to Live Dangerously and Still Win.\\"Coe, Richard L. (November 5, 1961). \\"Mammon Is King In Film at Warner\\". The Washington Post. G25. The Monthly Film Bulletin stated: \\"As, simply, a version of the infinitely well-known story, it has some curious interpolations (Christ's visit to John the Baptist in his cell) and omissions. The overwhelming failure, though, is in finding any kind of style, in imagery, dialogue or music, which goes beyond the most insipidly conventional kind of Bible illustrations.\\" Among later reviews, Leonard Maltin's home video guide awarded the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, and Geoff Andrew called it \\"one of the most interesting screen versions of the Gospels, adding that \\"some of the performances appear to lack depth, but one can't deny the effectiveness of Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa's fine score, and of Ray's simple but elegant visuals which achieve a stirring dramatic power untainted by pompous bombast.\\" Musicians such as Grammy Award-winning Art Greenhaw have cited the movie as being an influence in their work and even their favorite film of all time.Mesquite News (Texas) newspaper, 1994 Volume As of July 2019, the film holds a \\"fresh\\" 85% on Rotten Tomatoes. King of Kings music score, composed by Mikl√≥s R√≥zsa, was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.Awards for King of Kings. Hollywood Foreign Press Association. R√≥zsa's most recent work at the time was the score for MGM's hugely successful religious epic Ben-Hur (1959), for which he won his third Oscar. R√≥zsa composed the scores for many of MGM's epic films, including Quo Vadis (1951). Box office According to MGM records, the film earned $8 million in North America and $5.4 million overseas, earning a profit of $1,621,000. Legacy Most films at the time, except for the 1935 French film Golgotha, did not show Jesus' face, preferring to do shots of his hands (as in Ben-Hur) or over-the-shoulder views.

He named himself after George \\"Old Chocolate\\" Godfrey, a Black Canadian boxer from the bare-knuckle boxing days who had been a top name during the John L. Sullivan era. Old Chocolate had been the fourth fighter to reign as World Colored Heavyweight Champion while the second George Godfrey was the 20th fighter to hold the colored heavyweight title. The colored heavyweight title was recognized due to the color bar in pro boxing in the 19th and early 20th centuries, when white champions drew the color line and would not defend the title against a black man. In the heavyweight division, the color bar was adamantly defended by Old Chocolate Godfrey's contemporary, \\"The Boston Strong Boy\\", John L. Sullivan. Ironically, it remained in force even after colored heavyweight title holder Jack Johnson won the world's heavyweight title in 1908. Johnson never fought black opponents either, allegedly because such top promoters as Tex Rickard believed that a fight between two black boxers would not draw at the gate. He was also the only man to ever defeat the 7 foot 9 inch giant Gogea Mitu. Because of the color bar in the heavyweight division that continued until the rise of Joe Louis in the 1930s, the second Godfrey Williams never fought for the world heavyweight championship, like the man he had named himself after. He did win the International Boxing Union's version of the world heavyweight championship in 1935, two years before Louis became the second black man to become the universally recognized world heavyweight champ. Boxing career Boxing's second George Godfrey fought ring legend Sam Langford three times. Godfrey, who was 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) tall and weighed between 220 and 260 lb (118 kg) during his career, dwarfed the 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) Langford. Despite his advantage in size, height and weight, Godfrey was knocked out in two of the three matches in 1920 and 1921. He did manage a draw in his first bout with Langford in 1920. Godfrey is said to have been instructed by promoters on a number of occasions to carry opponents if he wanted to receive more important fights. He was outpointed over 10 rounds by future champion Jack Sharkey in 1926, was also outpointed by contender Johnny Risko in 10 rounds in 1928, but outpointed Paolino Uzcudun in 1928. World Colored Heavyweight Championship Godfrey twice won the World Colored Heavyweight Championship. When Harry Wills was stripped of the title after losing by disqualification to Jack Sharkey on 12 October 1926, Godfrey defeated Larry Gains on 8 November 1926 in Buffalo, New York on a TKO in the 6th round. Godfrey made three defenses of the title, which was retaken by Gaines on 15 August 1928 in Buffalo when Godfrey was disqualified. The title was later vacated, and Godfrey won it a second time on 24 August 1931 in Toronto, Canada when he defeated Seal Harris, whom he knocked out in the 2nd round. He defended it three more times before losing to Obidiah \\"Obie\\" Walker on points in a 10-round fight held in Philadelphia on 9 October 1933. In the interim between the two titles, he fought Bearcat Wright for the \\"Black Heavyweight Championship\\" on 19 December 1930 in Atlanta, Georgia, but the 10-round fight was a draw. Carnera Fight He was disqualified against future champion Primo Carnera in 1930. Many observers considered the 1930 Carnera fight to be fixed. Godfrey was disqualified in the sixth round when he was clearly getting the better of Carnera. Time Magazine, in an October 5, 1931 cover story on Carnera before he won the heavyweight title, commented on his odd career. > \\"Since his arrival in the U. S., backed by a group of prosperous but shady > entrepreneurs, Carnera's career has been less glorious than fantastic.... > Suspicion concerning the Monster's abilities became almost universal when > another adversary, Bombo Chevalier, stated that one of his own seconds had > threatened to kill him unless he lost to Carnera. Against the huge, lazy, > amiable Negro George Godfrey (249 lb.), he won on a foul. But only one of 33 > U. S. opponents has defeated Monster Carnera‚Äîfat, slovenly Jim Maloney, whom > Sharkey beat five years ago. In a return fight, at Miami last March, Carnera > managed to outpoint Maloney.\\" Godfrey had knocked out Maloney (who went on to beat Carnera after the latter's defeat of Godfrey in 1927). IBU Title Godfrey would go to Europe later in his career and win the International Boxing Union World Heavyweight title. In late 1934, the IBU had ordered world champion Max Baer to defend his title against the reigning European champion, Pierre Charles of Belgium. When Baer instead opted to fight James J. Braddock, they withdrew recognition of him as champion. Subsequently, the IBU matched Charles with Godfrey for their version of the title with the fight taking place in Brussels, Belgium on 2 October 1935. Godfrey won a fifteen round decision on points, but did not press any claim to the championship and it was inactive for the next two years. The IBU then recognized Baer's successor Braddock, as champion. Death and Honors Godfrey died on August 13, 1947 in his home and was found a week later, aged 50. His funeral was attended by many boxers, including former heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, former light heavyweight champion Jack Root, former middleweight champion Gorilla Jones, and others included footballer Dick Donald and boxing manager Mike McNulty.https://ladailymirror.com/2018/08/21/black-l-a-1947-heavyweight- fighter-george-godfrey-the-black-shadow-of-leiperville-dies-at-50 In 2003, Godfrey was named to the Ring Magazine's list of 100 greatest punchers of all time. In 2007, he was elected into the International Boxing Hall of Fame. Godfrey had a brief career in movies making five motion pictures from 1926 to 1937. His most famous role was as the cook in Paramount Pictures's 1926 Old Ironsides (film). His final role was as himself in MGM's Big City which starred Spencer Tracy.

Ratchet & Clank is the first game in the series and precedes Going Commando. The game follows the anthropomorphic character Ratchet meeting the robot Clank on his home planet. Clank discovers that the villainous Chairman Drek of the Blarg race plans to create a new planet for his species, destroying other planets in the process. Clank convinces Ratchet to help him in his mission to gain the help of the famous superhero Captain Qwark.

The game also includes several mini-games, such as racing or hacking, which the player must complete to proceed. The game was very well received by critics, who praised the graphics, gameplay, voice acting, audio, soundtrack and comedic approach to the story; some criticism was levelled at the camera, the characterization of the lead characters and the low level of difficulty in early stages.

As missions are completed across the game's various planets, more weapons and gadgets become available, including the Blaster, an automatic pistol; the Pyrocitor, a flamethrower; and the Suck Cannon, a vacuum gun, which sucks up smaller enemies and converts them into projectiles. Weapons are either found, or can be bought with bolts, the game's form of currency. The OmniWrench remains the standard melee weapon for close combat, with its own button, as all other weapons assume the role of secondary weaponry and can only be equipped one at a time, though all weapons can be carried in the player's inventory. Bolts can be found in crates, along with ammo, or dropped from defeated enemies. The player also needs to buy ammo for most weapons, but a small number can function without the need for ammo. Vendors, which sell weapons and ammo, are situated at strategic points throughout levels. After completing the game, the player may choose to enter \\"challenge mode\\", in which the game's difficulty level rises considerably, but all bolts and weapons acquired the first time are carried through. There is also the option to buy \\"gold weapons\\", more powerful versions of existing weapons. The game's health system, Nanotech, starts at four health bubbles equivalent to be able to take four hits, but upgrades can be purchased, giving the player a total of five hit points with the first upgrade and eight hit points with the second. Normally, Clank rides on Ratchet's back, acting as a jet-pack or similar device. Occasionally, however, Clank becomes a playable character when Ratchet is unable to explore certain areas. Clank can control \\"Gadgebots\\", smaller robots similar to Clank, who perform certain actions for him. Racing, in the form of hoverboard races, appears in the game. Some racing missions are necessary to progress in the game, while others are optional. One level of space combat and a level of flying through the air shooting tankers is also present. Mini-games that unlock doors, extend bridges, or elevate platforms appear in most levels.  Plot  In a warbot factory on planet Quartu, a defective but intelligent robot escapes and crash-lands on Veldin, the homeworld of the mechanic Ratchet (Mikey Kelley) (a feline-like humanoid known as a Lombax). After being repaired, the robot, nicknamed \\"Clank\\" (David Kaye), reveals that he is on a mission to stop Chairman Drek (Kevin Michael Richardson), a corrupt Blargian business tycoon who harvests inhabited planets to create a new one for his race, the Blarg, due to theirs having been overpopulated and severely polluted. However, by doing so, the selected planets are destroyed in the process. Joining forces, the two take out several of Drek's operations one-by-one while gathering gradual information on his plans. This move enrages Drek, who launches a manhunt for the duo. Ratchet and Clank enlist the help of Captain Qwark (Jim Ward), the Solana Galaxy's most popular superhero/celebrity; after Ratchet and Clank complete Qwark's \\"superhero\\" course they agree to meet at Qwark's private headquarters on Umbris. After surviving his obstacle course, Ratchet and Clank are betrayed by Qwark, who reveals that he was working for Drek the entire time as a highly paid spokesperson for the Chairman's new planet. Qwark leaves the duo to die in the lair of a Blargian Snagglebeast, which is easily dispatched by Ratchet. Determined on getting revenge for Qwark's deception, a bitter Ratchet liberates more Blarg-conquered planets, eventually coming across a Blargian moonbase. Qwark, attempting to make sure that the duo does not interfere in Drek's plans, engages them in a gruelling space battle that ends with Qwark being shot down and Ratchet and Clank leaving in satisfaction, their vengeance finally laid to rest. Ratchet and Clank fly to Quartu in order to find out about the Blarg's next move. Immediately after realizing that Drek intends to destroy Veldin with a planet-destroying weapon called the Deplanetizer and allow his already-completed planet to take its place of orbit, Ratchet swears revenge on Drek for his mercilessness. The Blarg and Drek are pursued to Veldin by a vengeful Ratchet, and soon a vicious battle ensues. Halfway through the fight, Drek reveals that he was the one who polluted the Blargian homeworld, and did so as an attempt to make a profit from creating and selling the artificial planet to the Blarg. He intends to repeat the whole process over-and-over again until he becomes the richest person in the galaxy. Ratchet launches Drek to his new planet, which is destroyed when Ratchet fires the Deplanetizer at it, killing Drek. Chunks of the planet begin to hit Veldin causing the duo to nearly fall to their death. Clank takes damage and Ratchet seems to leave the scene. A distraught Clank then prepares to leave Veldin however Ratchet returns to take Clank home and repair him. The duo then walk home together, their bond as friends now cemented. In a post-credits scene, Qwark advertises his \\"Personal Hygienator\\", much to Ratchet and Clank's disgust and discomfort, and Clank turns off the Holovision (TV) ending the game.  Development and release  After finishing work on the Spyro the Dragon series on the PlayStation, Insomniac originally intended to launch a game codenamed I5 (Insomniac game #5) for the PlayStation 2. The developers, however, were never enthusiastic about it, and the idea was dropped after six months. Ratchet & Clank was based on an idea by Brian Hastings, which would feature a space-traveling reptile alien who would collect various weapons as he progressed through the game; Ratchet's final form was decided upon after Insomniac considered a space lizard with a tailTed Price: Collected Works  GamesRadar and various terrestrial creatures, including dogs and rats; feline features stood out to the developers because of the associated sense of agility. Another early idea was to have three small robots attached to Ratchet, which would perform different functions. However, Insomniac realized that having the robots was both complicated and created confusion about Ratchet's appearance, leading them to have only one robot, Clank. According to an interview, not much was cut but that (according to Insomniac) \\"Interestingly, we really didn't cut anything except for a few weapons and gadgets that just weren't fun when we prototyped them. There was the Revolverator ‚Äì a drill gun which would spin enemies around once Ratchet impaled them and the Mackerel 1000 ‚Äì basically a fish that took the place of the wrench. Both of these got cut because they were either too hard to use or just didn't add anything to the game.\\" Shortly after changing the game from I5 to Ratchet & Clank, Naughty Dog asked Insomniac if they would be interested in sharing the game technology used in Naughty Dog's Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, asking that Insomniac in turn share with them any improvements that were made. Insomniac agreed, resulting in most of the Ratchet & Clank engine technology being developed in-house by Insomniac, but some very important renderers were those developed by Naughty Dog. Looking back on the agreement, Ted Price said that \\"Naughty Dog's generosity gave us a huge leg up and allowed us to draw the enormous vistas in the game.\\" Some years later, Ted Price clarified Insomniac's stance on engine technology while obliquely mentioning the shared renderers: Pre-production of the game began in late March 2001, with a team of approximately 35 people. The game went into production in November 2001, and by the end of the project, the team had grown to 45. The game was first released in North America on November 4, 2002, and then in Australia on November 6, 2002. It was later released in PAL regions on November 8, 2002, and in Japan on December 3, 2002. In November 2003, Sony added Ratchet & Clank to their Greatest hits series of games for the PlayStation 2 when Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando was released at that time, and the game was similarly added to Sony's Platinum Range used in the PAL region on August 22, 2003. The game was added to Japan's The Best range on July 3, 2003; it was also the only game to be bundled with the PlayStation 2 in Japan.  Reception  By July 2006, Ratchet & Clank had sold 1.1 million copies and earned $31 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 49th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country. Combined sales of the Ratchet & Clank series reached 4 million units in the United States by July 2006. Ratchet & Clank was met with positive reviews from critics upon release. After playing a preview of the game, GameSpot described it as having \\"excellent graphics, varied gameplay, and tight control[s]\\". The game's use of weapons, rather than simple melee attacks, was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games; Computer and Video Games said that \\"Going berserk with your giant ratchet ... is seriously satisfying ... Every time you thump an enemy with the hefty tool, it looks, sounds and feels remarkably solid. ... What's more, the same can be said for all the other weapons you collect and use over the course of your intergalactic adventure\\". GameSpot noted that the player does not need to follow the same paths multiple times, as was common in platformers at the time. Gameplanet said that it was \\"Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format!\\" Reviewers praised the game's graphics, specifically pointing out the character and background designs as being high-quality for PS2 games of the time. GameSpy called the graphics \\"mind-blowing\\", and GameSpot praised the game's smooth frame rate. GameZone noted the animation of Ratchet, praising the details in his animation. Reviewers found that the game's voice overs and other audio elements were generally well-done. IGN commented on the game's artificial intelligence, saying that it was not as well-done as that of Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy, but still \\"purposefully comic and somewhat sophisticated\\" in others. Gameplanet felt that the game's levels were well laid-out. Criticism was aimed at the game's camera angles, which Eurogamer felt were \\"idiotic\\" at times, giving the example of boss fights in which the camera centers on the boss rather than being freely movable. Allgame found that it was hard to form an emotional bond with Ratchet & Clanks main characters, saying that Ratchet is \\"your typical teenager ... who desires nothing more than excitement and adventure\\" and that Clank is \\"the stereotypical intellectual; stuffy and almost prudish to a fault\\", feeling instead that the characters of Jak and Daxter from Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy were \\"infinitely more likeable.\\" Some criticism was also aimed at the story, with GameSpy saying that the game became predictable, boring, and \\"just bland\\". Reviewers also noted that the first half of the game was \\"yawn inducing\\", but once the player reaches planet Rilgar, it becomes much more intense and difficult; GamePro found that the player does not \\"engage a single thought process\\" for the first parts of the game.  Legacy  In June 2014, it was announced that the game would be re-imagined for the PlayStation 4, with the intention of remaking the original game as if Insomniac Games were to make the game again today. The re-imagining is also tied-in with the 2016 film. The game was originally planned to be released on the PlayStation 4 in 2015, but was delayed along with the film to April 12, 2016.

Owned by iHeartMedia, the station covers the Nashville metropolitan area. The WLAC studios are located in Nashville's Music Row district, while the station transmitter resides in the city's Northside neighborhood. In addition to a standard analog transmission, WLAC broadcasts an HD Radio signal utilizing the in-band on- channel standard, is simulcast over a digital subchannel of WSIX-FM and on low-power FM translator W252CM (98.3 FM), and is available online via iHeartRadio. History=Early years WLAC first signed on the air on November 24, 1926. After a few years on several frequencies, WLAC was heard on 1470 kilocycles, powered at 5,000 watts.Broadcasting Yearbook 1935 page 56 The call letters were chosen to contain an acronym for the first owner of the station, the Life and Casualty Insurance Company of Tennessee. Studios were located on the fifth floor of the Life and Casualty building in downtown Nashville. In 1928, it became Nashville's CBS Radio Network affiliate. Its main competitor, WSM, was affiliated with the NBC Red Network. The early years of the station, WLAC provided local news, studio-orchestra musical features (accompanied by an in-studio pipe organ), farm reports, and some educational programming. Its main competitor in that era, WSM, became known as the radio station where country music essentially developed and became a national phenomenon. When country music became a big business in the late 1940s, WLAC added early-morning and Saturday-afternoon country and western shows in an attempt to steal some of WSM's thunder. Otherwise, the station prided itself as a pillar of the community and placed emphasis on general full-service programs. In 1941, with the enactment of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA), WLAC moved to 1510 kHz.Broadcasting Yearbook 1942 page 176 The following year, the station boosted its power to 50,000 watts, becoming the second clear-channel station in Tennessee after WSM. While WSM was a Class I-A station, using a non-directional antenna at all times, WLAC was a Class I-B outlet, required to use a directional antenna after sunset to protect other stations on the frequency. In 1953, WLAC added an FM adjunct, WLAC-FM (105.9),Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-197 then signed on WLAC-TV (Channel 5) the following year; owing to WLAC's affiliation with the CBS Radio Network, WLAC-TV took the CBS TV affiliation from WSIX-TV (Channel 8). WLAC-TV was sold to the Hobby Family of Houston in 1975, changing the call sign to WTVF, and is now owned by the E. W. Scripps Company. Late night rhythm and blues In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, WLAC was legendary for its quartet of nighttime rhythm and blues shows hosted by Gene Nobles, \\"John R.\\" (John Richbourg), Herman Grizzard, and Bill \\"Hossman\\" (or simply \\"Hoss\\") Allen. Thanks to the station's clear channel designation, the signal reached most of the Eastern and Midwestern United States. WLAC described itself as the nighttime station for half the nation with African-American listeners, especially in the Deep South as the intended audience of the programs. Further, several foreign countries, particularly islands in the Caribbean and southern Canada, were within range of the station's nighttime signal; the music heard on WLAC played a notable role in the development of ska music as a result. WLAC was also popular with some young white teenagers. Radio historians believe that the nightly \\"Rhythm and blues\\" WLAC shows, in part, laid the foundational audience for the rock and roll phenomenon that began in the late 1950s. Nobles began the move, in 1946, to play what were considered at the time \\"race\\" records, a euphemism intended to deter supposedly respectable audiences. But he and the others reached large numbers of African- American listeners in places like the Mississippi Delta, the Carolina Lowcountry, Louisiana, Chicago, and Detroit, people whom practically no other radio stations were serving. Gradually phasing in artists like Amos Milburn, Chuck Berry, and Fats Domino in the early 1950s to supplement the big-band artists of the era such as Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller, the WLAC announcers presided over the development of what became \\"rhythm and blues\\" music. They did this mainly to attract advertisers who serviced the African-American community, such as hair-care products like Royal Crown Hair Pomade or chicken hatcheries, which packaged baby scrub roosters and other undesirable stock in large quantities for sale. The disc jockeys developed a reputation for colorfully pitching those products on-air; some product slogans lent themselves to sexually suggestive double entendres, which only increased the announcers' popularity among teen listeners. The deejays conducted the advertising sales on a \\"per inquiry\\", or commission, basis, meaning that the station did not rely on traditional ratings to gauge the programs' successes. WLAC Sales Manager E.G. Blackman sought to hire the nation's first African- American news radio broadcaster employed by a major, white-owned radio station, Don Whitehead. Whitehead, a graduate of Tennessee State University, began his career shortly after the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Whitehead started in the nighttime slot, announcing the news at the top of the hour. He traveled around WLAC's listening area to promote the historically black colleges and universities and played a big role in increasing enrollment of African-Americans attending college. Performers of later years, such as Johnny Winter, and the Allman brothers, Duane and Greg, have credited the station as being a valuable source of inspiration for their artistic development. According to Levon Helm, Robbie Robertson listened to WLAC at night while in Toronto. As a teenager, Robertson would stay up all night to hear blues from deejay John R. A strange irony about the phenomenon was unknown to most listeners of that time: all four disc jockeys were in fact middle-aged white men, not African-Americans, as their Southern, gravelly, drawling voices suggested. Richbourg and Allen in particular made frequent use of colloquialisms most familiar to their audience, thereby convincing many that they were \\"soul brothers,\\" as a common expression of that day. Other regular sponsors of the four shows included Randy's Record Shop of Gallatin, Tennessee, Ernie's Record Mart, and Buckley's Record Shop, the latter two of Nashville, all of which conducted mail order business selling the recordings featured on the shows, and had affiliations with record companies in Middle Tennessee. Buckley's Record Shop folded in the early 1970s; Randy's Record Shop ceased operations in the late 1990s, although as of January 2019 its former building still stands. Allen and Richbourg also had financial interests in recording companies, artist management, and recording studios at varying points in their careers. Each deejay's program lasted from one to two hours per evening Mondays through Saturdays, occupying roughly (with adjustments over the years) the period between 8 p.m. and 2 a.m. Central Time. On Sunday nights, Richbourg or Allen hosted programs featuring black gospel recordings. Richbourg and Allen took credit for helping to start or boost the careers of artists like James Brown, Ray Charles, B. B. King, Otis Redding, Jackie Wilson, Aretha Franklin; Nobles helped the likes of Little Richard. Other than the famous late-night shows, WLAC followed a fairly conventional news/talk and middle of the road music format in the daytime until the early 1970s, when new management attempted to program a Top 40 format, competing against ratings leader WMAK (1300 AM) for the Nashville-area teenage audience. This move in particular is believed to have prompted Richbourg and Nobles to retire, as they had no interest in conforming to a predetermined, pop-oriented playlist arranged by an outside consultant. In addition to this, most markets in WLAC's night-time coverage area now had black oriented stations of their own, most of which attracted the demographic groups that formerly listened to Allen, Richbourg, and Nobles' shows as their only source for R&B; and soul music. Furthermore, musical tastes among younger listeners in particular changed as the 1970s approached, as white youth began to prefer the hard rock that initially modeled itself on the blues (especially on the upstart FM stations that began playing it), while African-American kids gravitated toward the grittier edges of funk or early disco and, eventually, rap. This made the Motown, Muscle Shoals, and Memphis sounds favored by the DJ trio seem pass√©, and the hosts' audience, unsurprisingly, began to age. Changing tastes also brought about the end to record labels such as Stax, which were major suppliers of music heard on the R&B;/Soul shows. To replace the retiring jocks, the station recruited young Spider Harrison, a native New Yorker who at the time was an afternoon urban air personality and program director at WTLC- FM in Indianapolis. Harrison steered the nighttime format into a blend of soul and rock, in an attempt to target an entire new generation of young night-time listeners throughout the country. However, WLAC appeared to gain little Arbitron ratings improvements from local listeners, despite frequent promotional events staged throughout the Nashville area. Only Hoss Allen kept his program, which he converted to an urban gospel format, by moving it to the overnight/early morning slot. Talk radio era The station finally pulled the plug on its unsuccessful run as a Top 40 outlet and changed formats to full time news and talk in 1980, making it one of the first stations in the Southern U.S. to adopt that format exclusively. In 1986, WLAC pioneered sports talk in Middle Tennessee, when it began a two-hour-long afternoon drive-time sports show hosted by record company executive and sports fan Rick Baumgartner, along with former WSMV-TV sportscaster Charlie McAlexander. Also, former WSM, WSMV and WKRN-TV personality Teddy Bart launched his critically acclaimed \\"Roundtable\\" interview program on WLAC's morning schedule in 1985. The show, which featured newsmakers in Tennessee politics, later moved to several other Nashville stations before discontinuing production in 2005. Much in the same manner as in years past when network programming gave way at sunset to R&B; music for a different audience, for many years after WLAC changed to news and talk, the station abruptly switched, at 8 p.m. Central Time (when the clear-channel signal settled into place) to a Christian talk and teaching format. The nighttime line-up included paid broadcasts of many evangelical, fundamentalist, and Pentecostal preachers, seeking donations for their ministries, with the news/talk format resuming at daybreak (after the Hoss Allen show). This practice was discontinued shortly after the station's purchase by AMFM, Inc. in 1999.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2000 page D-420 AMFM was later merged into San Antonio-based Clear Channel Communications, which became iHeartMedia in 2014. WLAC's longtime logo used from the late 1990s up until 2017. For many years until 2010, WLAC was the Nashville home of the University of Tennessee Volunteers. Since 2012, WLAC serves as the flagship of the Vanderbilt Commodores IMG Sports Network. On September 21, 2018, translator station W252CM dropped its classic country format The Big Legend and began to simulcast WLAC on FM, with the station's branding changing to TalkRadio 98.3. Along with the translator, WLAC is also simulcast on WSIX- HD2. In 2018, the station announced the addition of a new morning show, The Tennessee Star Report with Steve Gill, beginning September 24. Gill ran into legal problems the following year; according to The Tennessean, Gill failed to pay $170,000 in child support, resulting in his arrest. He spent more than a week in the Williamson County Jail, and resigned his position with the conservative news website \\"The Tennessee Star.\\" Programming Weekdays begin with a local morning show from 5 to 8 a.m. known as the Tennessee Star Report. The rest of the day, WLAC carries mostly nationally syndicated conservative talk hosts, including Glenn Beck, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Clyde Lewis and Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, from the co-owned Premiere Networks. Other syndicated shows include Nashville-based Dave Ramsey, Houston-based Michael Berry and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal.WLAC.com/schedule Weekends hosts include Joe Pags and Leo Laporte, in addition to Vanderbilt University Commodores football and basketball games.

It was one of the few Mega Drive/Genesis first person shooters, besides Bloodshot and the Duke Nukem 3D port. Plot In the future, mankind has made great advances in interstellar travel and subsequently colonised the Solar System. The extrasolar settlements, research outposts, mines, commercial colonies, and spacecraft and space stations throughout the Solar System are protected over by a mighty, interstellar military conglomerate named the Planet Defense Corps. When Europa-1, the flagship of the Planet Defense Corps, is attacked by an unknown yet lethal aggressor of apparently extraterrestrial nature, the Planet Defense Corps call in Zero Tolerance, an elite strike squad of five speciality-trained commandos. A recording of the last transmission from Europa-1 reveals extensive fire damage to the warship, almost total casualties and otherworldly creatures hunting the few remaining survivors of the attack. Also, the nuclear cooling system of Europa-1 has been damaged by small arms fire, and core breach caused by overheating will destroy the starship in a matter of hours. As a member of the Zero Tolerance squad, the player character is ordered during the crisis briefing to infiltrate Europa-1 before it explodes. Their mission is to completely eliminate the mysterious alien aggressor from within, and also the transformed humans of Europa-1 they have \\"infected\\", in the next few hours to erase all evidence of the attack and the alien intruders. Gameplay Zero Tolerance's first stage. Zero Tolerance is made up of 40 levels spanning three separate areas: the space warship Europa-1, an abandoned merchant freighter, the heavily fortified central command building for the Planet Defense Corps, and the sub-basement areas of that building. The object of the game is to kill all of the enemies on a level and then proceed to the exit, which is either a staircase or elevator leading down to the next level. However, nothing prevents the player from heading straight towards the exit without killing all of the enemies. If this is done, the player is simply not given any passwords until the entire area is finished. Once a character is killed that character will be listed as \\"deceased,\\" and becomes unavailable for playing. The player can choose from a total of five different characters; once they are all deceased the game is over. Link cable support The game supported connecting two Genesis/Mega Drives via a special link cable using the second joypad ports for a multiplayer mode. The cable was originally supposed to be shipped as a pack-in with the game. However this was changed in a last-minute decision and a coupon for ordering a free cable was added instead. Reception GamePro gave the game a mostly positive review, commenting that \\"First-person games like Zero Tolerance really put pressure on a system's processor, but Accolade has done a good job here: The anxiety caused by an adversary careening around a corner or the twitching body of a gunned-down spider is severe.\\" They additionally praised the large and labyrinthine levels, cooperative multiplayer ability, and limited but effective sound effects, though they criticized a few elements such as how slowly the player character turns. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly had varying reactions to Zero Tolerance, but generally agreed that it was an effective substitute for Wolfenstein 3D and Doom on the Genesis. They scored it a 7.5 out of 10. Sequel A sequel called Beyond Zero Tolerance (or Zero Tolerance 2) was in development by Technopop for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis, but it was cancelled. A letter- writing campaign for Accolade to release the game was started, with no success. The ROMs of the game and its sequel were offered by the owner for free download later.www.technopop.net/ \\"Randel Reiss, the owner of the Zero Tolerance copyright and trademark, has made the original Zero Tolerance Sega Genesis ROM image royalty-free for distribution.\\" The story of Beyond Zero Tolerance involves the player character traveling to the alien homeworld to eradicate all life there. 2005 trademark issues with Eidos In October 2005, Eidos Interactive announced a game titled Zero Tolerance: City Under Fire for PS2 and Xbox. Technopop's former president and owner of its assets, Randel B. Reiss, made a statement in which he held the copyright for the title Zero Tolerance, and also announced that he was working on an updated version of the classic Zero Tolerance under the same title which was being developed for the PSP; the statement alleged trademark infringement on Reiss' trademark and sent a \\"cease and desist\\" notice to Eidos Interactive in using the title Zero Tolerance.

He is best known as a writer of epic historical novels which span long periods of history but are set in particular places. His debut novel Sarum set the pattern for his work with a ten-thousand-year storyline. Biography Rutherfurd attended the University of Cambridge and Stanford Business School, where he earned a Sloan fellowship. After graduating he worked in political research, bookselling and publishing. He abandoned his career in the book trade in 1983 and returned to his childhood home to write Sarum, a historical novel with a ten-thousand year story, set in the area around the ancient monument of Stonehenge and Salisbury. Sarum was published in 1987 and became an instant international best-seller, remaining for 23 weeks on the New York Times Bestseller List. Since then he produced seven more New York Times best-sellers: Russka, a novel of Russia; London; The Forest, set in England's New Forest which lies close by Sarum; two novels, Dublin: Foundation (The Princes of Ireland) and Ireland: Awakening (The Rebels of Ireland), which cover the story of Ireland from the time just before Saint Patrick to the twentieth century; New York; and Paris. His books have sold more than fifteen million copies and been translated into twenty languages. Rutherfurd settled near Dublin, Ireland in the early 1990s, but currently divides his time between Europe and North America. New York: The Novel, won the Langum Prize for American Historical Fiction in 2009 and was awarded the Washington Irving Medal for Literary Excellence, by the Saint Nicholas Society of the City of New York, in 2011. In 2015 Edward Rutherfurd was the recipient of the City of Zaragoza's International Historical Novel Honor Award \\"for his body of work in the field of the historical novel.\\" Style Rutherfurd invents four to six fictional families and tells the stories of their descendants. Using this framework, he chronicles the history of a place, often from the beginning of civilisation to modern times - a kind of historical fiction inspired by the work of James Michener. Rutherfurd's novels are generally at least 500 pages and sometimes even over 1,000. Divided into a number of parts, each chapter represents a different era in the area of the novel's history. There is usually an extensive family tree in the introduction, and each generational line matches with the corresponding chapters. Rutherfurd was not the first to write a successful novel about a place through history with connected stories through time. One notable forerunner was John Masters' \\"The Rock\\" (1970) which does essentially the same for Gibraltar.

He is the current head football coach at the University of Iowa, a position he has held since the 1999 season. From 1990 to 1992, Ferentz was the head football coach at the University of Maine, where he had a record of 12‚Äì21. He has also served as an assistant coach with the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens of the National Football League (NFL). Ferentz played college football as a linebacker at the University of Connecticut from 1974 to 1976. Since 2017, he has been the longest tenured FBS coach with one program, and as of September 2018, is the all-time wins leader at Iowa. Background After playing football at Upper St. Clair High School near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Ferentz played linebacker for the University of Connecticut. He was a football captain and an academic all-Yankee Conference linebacker at Connecticut. He served as a student assistant at Connecticut in 1977 and graduated in 1978. Ferentz spent his next two seasons as defensive coordinator at Worcester Academy, where he taught English literature. He then spent one season in 1980 as an assistant offensive line coach at the University of Pittsburgh. The 1980 Pittsburgh Panthers football team, coached by Jackie Sherrill, finished with an 11‚Äì1 record and a number two national ranking. Ferentz was the offensive line coach at the University of Iowa under head coach Hayden Fry for nine seasons, from 1981 to 1989. Eleven Hawkeyes coached by Ferentz went on to play in the National Football League (NFL). Three of them were first round picks in the NFL draft, and five of his players were first team All-Big Ten Conference selections. Six of those players played over 100 games in the NFL: OG Ron Hallstrom, OG Mark Bortz, OT Brett Miller, C Joel Hilgenberg, OT John Alt, and OG Bob Kratch. OG Mike Haight played in 63 games as well. Ferentz left Iowa to coach at the University of Maine in 1990. After three seasons of coaching the Black Bears to a combined 12‚Äì21 record, he was named the offensive line coach of the NFL's Cleveland Browns. Ferentz served under Bill Belichick in Cleveland and followed the franchise to Baltimore when they became the Baltimore Ravens. Iowa head coaching career On December 2, 1998, Ferentz was hired as Iowa's 26th head football coach to replace the retiring Hayden Fry. The team struggled during Ferentz's first two seasons with a combined 4‚Äì19 record, but the Hawkeyes earned their first bowl bid of the Ferentz era after a 7‚Äì5 season in 2001. They beat Texas Tech in the Alamo Bowl, 19‚Äì16. The 2002 season would prove to be memorable for Ferentz and the Hawkeyes. The team finished the regular season with an 11‚Äì1 record; its only loss coming to Iowa State. They shared the Big Ten Conference championship with Ohio State, as both teams finished 8‚Äì0 in conference play. Quarterback Brad Banks won the Davey O'Brien Award for best quarterback and finished second in the Heisman Trophy balloting to Carson Palmer of USC. Tight end Dallas Clark was that season's John Mackey Award winner, and placekicker Nate Kaeding was the Lou Groza Award winner. Ferentz was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press for his efforts. Iowa received its first-ever BCS invitation, losing to USC in the 2003 Orange Bowl, 38‚Äì17. Despite losing several seniors to graduation, the Hawkeyes compiled a 9‚Äì3 regular season record in 2003. They defeated Florida 37‚Äì17 in the Outback Bowl on January 1, 2004, for their first January win since 1959. This earned the Hawkeyes a #8 national ranking in both the AP Poll and Coaches Poll at the end of the season. Offensive tackle Robert Gallery was that season's Outland Trophy winner; after the season, the Oakland Raiders chose him with the second overall pick in the 2004 NFL Draft. Ferentz had to deal with multiple injuries to the Hawkeyes' running backs and the death of his father, John, during the 2004 season. Nevertheless, the Hawkeyes compiled a 9‚Äì2 regular season record, sharing the Big Ten Conference championship with Michigan after a 30‚Äì7 victory over Wisconsin on November 20. For the second time in three seasons, Ferentz was named the Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year. On January 1, 2005, they defeated LSU, 30‚Äì25, after a thrilling 56-yard touchdown pass from Drew Tate to Warren Holloway as time expired in the Capital One Bowl. This gave Ferentz his third straight ten-win season with the Hawkeyes and another #8 national ranking. The Hawkeyes went 7‚Äì4 during the 2005 regular season. After early-season losses to Iowa State and Ohio State and close losses to Michigan and Northwestern, they finished the season with wins over Wisconsin and Minnesota to earn a second trip to the Outback Bowl to face Florida on January 2, 2006. This time, however, the Gators got a measure of revenge for their loss two years earlier, as the Hawkeyes lost to Florida, 31‚Äì24. Much was said about the officiating in this game, as there were 13 missed or bad calls made against the Hawkeyes that directly influenced the outcome. The NCAA made an official acknowledgment of this issue. Iowa started the 2006 season strong, winning their first four games before losing to top-ranked Ohio State. After a 5‚Äì1 start, however, the Hawkeyes collapsed down the stretch, losing five of their last six games. Iowa suffered shocking losses to Northwestern and Indiana and lost rivalry games with Wisconsin and Minnesota. The Hawkeyes finished the regular season with a 6‚Äì6 record and accepted an invitation to the 2006 Alamo Bowl, Iowa's sixth straight bowl game. Playing as nine-point underdogs to defending national champions Texas, Iowa lost the Alamo Bowl by a score of 26‚Äì24. In 2007, Ferentz' Hawkeyes started 2‚Äì4 and lost their first three conference games. An upset victory over Illinois ended a nine-game conference losing streak for Iowa, and the Hawkeyes closed out the Big Ten season by winning their last three conference games. However, a disappointing loss in the season finale to Western Michigan dropped the Hawkeyes' season record to 6‚Äì6. Though Iowa was bowl-eligible, the Hawkeyes did not receive a bowl bid, snapping Iowa's streak of six consecutive bowl appearances. In 2008, Ferentz and the Hawkeyes started out strong with victories over his old team, Maine, Florida International, and rival Iowa State, but close losses to Pitt, Northwestern, and Michigan State left Iowa with a 3‚Äì3 record. Iowa then went on to win five of their next six games, including a 24‚Äì23 upset of #3 ranked and undefeated Penn State. After finishing the regular season at 8‚Äì4, Iowa accepted an invitation to the Outback Bowl where they defeated the South Carolina Gamecocks, 31‚Äì10. alt=Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz and Ohio State coach Ferentz and Ohio State coach Jim Tressel talk on the field before their teams played on November 14, 2009. The 2009 Hawkeye football team got off to the best start in school history up to that point. Narrow home victories over Northern Iowa and Arkansas State coupled with double digit road wins over Penn State and Wisconsin fueled a 7‚Äì0 start. Ferentz' 2009 Hawks became the first Iowa team to win eight games to start a season by winning at Michigan State, 15‚Äì13, with a touchdown pass on the final play of the game. After defeating Indiana to run their record to 9‚Äì0, the Hawks lost quarterback Ricky Stanzi to injury in an upset loss to Northwestern. Iowa then lost the de facto Big Ten championship game at Ohio State, 27‚Äì24, in overtime. The Hawkeyes shut out Minnesota, 12‚Äì0, to finish the regular season with a 10‚Äì2 record and were selected for their second BCS bowl game under Ferentz by being invited to the 2010 Orange Bowl. Iowa defeated Georgia Tech, 24‚Äì14, to earn the school's first BCS bowl win and their first victory in a BCS-level bowl since the 1959 Rose Bowl. Iowa finished with an 11‚Äì2 record that tied the school record for victories in a season and the Hawkeyes earned #7 rankings in both the AP Poll and Coaches Poll, their highest finish since the 1960 season. Following three mediocre seasons in which Iowa went just a combined 19-19 and a humbling defeat in the Taxslayer Bowl, the 2015 season proved to be one of the best in university history. The program had become stagnant and predictable. Ferentz implemented new, spontaneous play calls and techniques that were dubbed \\"New Kirk\\" by fans and media alike. Iowa went undefeated in the regular season and recorded 12 wins, the most in school history. Additionally, a team that went 0‚Äì4 in trophy games the year before, went 4-0 and won the Big Ten Conference West championship, the first in school history. Ferentz was also named Big Ten coach of the year for the fourth time while at Iowa. The Hawkeyes fell 16‚Äì13 in the 2015 Big Ten Football Championship Game against Michigan State. Despite the loss, the Hawkeyes accepted an invitation to the 2016 Rose Bowl, Ferentz's third Rose Bowl with Iowa, first as head coach, and it marks the first trip to Pasadena for the Hawkeyes in 25 years. In the Rose Bowl, the Hawkeyes were throttled, 45‚Äì16, by a Christian McCaffrey led Stanford team. With their latest Rose Bowl defeat, the Hawkeyes fell to 0‚Äì4, with a combined score of 164‚Äì78, since their last victory in 1959. In 2016, Iowa suffered numerous injuries which derailed them in the earlier part of the season. However, they finished strong beating #3 Michigan, and prevailed over #16 Nebraska, finishing with an 8‚Äì4 record. The Iowa offensive line was awarded the Joe Moore Award. This award was especially significant because Moore was a lifelong mentor to Ferentz, and the team had to overcome a great deal to win it. Iowa was selected to play in the Outback Bowl for the fifth time under Ferentz, where they lost to the Florida Gators 30‚Äì3. Following the loss to the Gators the Hawkeyes fell to 0‚Äì5 in their last five bowl games, getting outscored 172‚Äì75 in those contests. The 2017 season was almost a carbon copy of the previous season. Iowa got off to a great start but was again plagued with several injuries. The team went undefeated in non-conference play and all but two of their Big Ten losses were by just one score (38-14 vs. Wisconsin, 24-15 vs. Purdue). Like the prior season, Iowa went 3‚Äì1 in trophy games, and finished with eight wins. They were also able to beat #3 Ohio State for the first time since 2004. Iowa played in the Pinstripe Bowl, the 15th bowl under Ferentz. After trailing early, the Hawkeyes dominated the second half and won their first bowl game since 2010. The victory tied Hayden Fry in Iowa career wins (143), and surpassed his number of bowl wins at the university. The 2018 season will be remembered for close Big Ten Conference losses that cost the Hawkeyes another trip to Indianapolis. Iowa started strong, winning its three non-conference games, and once again was able to keep three of the four rivalry trophies in Iowa City. However, losses to Penn State, Purdue and Northwestern in consecutive weeks defined the season. Iowa played in the Outback Bowl for the sixth time, holding on to defeat Mississippi State 27-22 for Ferentz's fifth January bowl win and eighth overall bowl victory. 2019 was overall a great year for Iowa. The Hawkeyes started 4‚Äì0, and went undefeated against non-conference opponents. After back-to-back losses against Big Ten powerhouses Michigan and Penn State it looked like it could be a lost season for the team. Iowa rallied, winning five of their last six games but yet another loss to archrival Wisconsin meant that a Big Ten West division title eluded the program. The Hawkeyes played in the Holiday Bowl against USC. In the first match-up between the Trojans and Hawkeyes since the 2003 Orange Bowl Iowa outplayed USC in a shootout 49‚Äì24. The victory gave the program ten wins for the sixth time under Ferentz. The team was also able to accomplish a distinction that hadn't been done since 1991, they both started and finished the season in the top 25 national rankings without dropping out. As of November 2019, Ferentz is 15-6 versus Big Ten rival Minnesota and 12-9 versus in-state rival Iowa State, though his predecessor went 16‚Äì4 against their in- state rival. Ferentz notched his 100th career win at Iowa with a double- overtime victory over the Michigan State Spartans in East Lansing on October 13, 2012. He became the all-time wins leader in school history, (144) with a victory over Northern Illinois on September 1, 2018, and has led Iowa to 17 bowl games, more bowls than any other Iowa coach. Later that season Ferentz recorded his 150th Iowa career win with a blowout triumph over Big Ten foe Illinois on November 17, 2018. When Joe Paterno was fired from Penn State in 2011 Ferentz became the dean of Big Ten football coaches, as the longest tenured coach in the respective sport. With the retirement of Virginia Tech coach Frank Beamer after the 2015 season, Ferentz became tied with Bob Stoops for the longest tenured head coach at the FBS level. In June 2017, Ferentz became the longest tenured coach with the sudden retirement of Bob Stoops. On June 6, 2020, Ferentz placed strength coach Chris Doyle on paid administrative leave after a number of former players identified Doyle and Brian Ferentz as contributing to a program culture that was hostile toward black student- athletes. On June 15, Doyle was released from the program after a 21 year stint. On July 27th, 2020, ESPN published an article citing instances of racial inequities levied against black players throughout Kirk Ferentz tenure as a head coach. One former player, Dace Richardson, was quoted saying \\"I've talked with guys and they talked about how they were made to conform to what Coach Ferentz wanted or what they expected white players to be like, we had a lot of guys on our team that had personalities and they weren't allowed to be their natural selves. I never had issues with that because I kind of just conformed to what the team wanted.\\" Professional football opportunities Several major college and NFL teams have considered Ferentz as a candidate for their head coaching jobs. However, Ferentz has publicly declined any interest in other coaching positions, opting to stay at Iowa. On February 12, 2009, Ferentz and Iowa athletics director Gary Barta agreed to a new contract extension that keeps Ferentz at Iowa until 2020.Kirk Ferentz gets contract extension from Iowa Hawkeyes ‚Äì ESPN.

There was renewed speculation that Ferentz would be offered a head coaching job with one of those professional franchises. But such speculation was soon put to rest when Ferentz stated that he was still happy with his job at Iowa, and that he had no plans to leave.Topic: Article by Hlas posted by Thaihawk on Time for a change part 2. .

Following the 2006 NFL season, rumors circulated that Ferentz may have been in consideration for the Pittsburgh Steelers' head coaching job after Bill Cowher stepped down. However, before Cowher's departure, Ferentz was asked about his possible interest in the position, and stated: \\"I know that staff pretty well and they've got some good guys in that building. My guess is that's where they would go. But I‚Äôm not interested, and I doubt they are, either. I‚Äôve got a great job right here.\\"San Antonio Express-News The Steelers job eventually went to Mike Tomlin. In 2008, Ferentz was again rumored to be a candidate for an NFL head coaching job, particularly as successor to Romeo Crennel for the Cleveland Browns. In January 2009, rumors surfaced citing Ferentz as a potential candidate to be hired as head coach in place of Herman Edwards soon after the hiring of former New England Patriots VP of Player Personnel Scott Pioli as the new GM of the Kansas City Chiefs. However, the Chiefs eventually hired Todd Haley, and Ferentz received a contract extension to remain at Iowa through 2020. In December 2011, rumors again surfaced citing Ferentz as a potential candidate to replace Haley. Similar rumors surfaced a year later in December 2012. Ferentz has said that there was no reason to leave Iowa as Iowa has everything he needed. In 2016 he signed an extension through the 2026 season. He is currently the 18th highest- paid coach in college football. Personal life Ferentz and his wife, Mary, have five children: Brian, Kelly, Joanne, James, and Steven. Brian was a starting offensive lineman on the 2005 Iowa football team, a practice squad player for the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. Since the 2012 season, Brian has served as the offensive line coach for Iowa. In January 2017, Brian was named the offensive coordinator.Iowa hires Ferentz, Woods as assistants. wcfcourier.com.

Steven graduated in 2017 and was a member of the football team he is now an offensive quality control coach with the Miami Dolphins.  Player development  Ferentz has developed a reputation as a developer of talent during his tenure at Iowa. Since 1999, Iowa has routinely taken walk on, two, and three star talent and developed them into NFL prospects. During his tenure, Iowa has had 70 players drafted into the NFL, including nine first round picks, all while consistently recruiting high school players who are not desired by more prominent college programs. Iowa offensive linemen and tight ends are highly sought after by NFL teams, citing their work ethic and technical proficiency as being highly developed.

Early life and education Sopinka was born in Broderick, Saskatchewan and lived there until his Ukrainian Canadian family moved to Hamilton, Ontario. He completed secondary school at Saltfleet High School in Stoney Creek. He earned Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Laws degrees at the University of Toronto. While studying law, he also played professional football. He was drafted in the sixth round of the 1955 CFL draft. He played with the Toronto Argonauts (1955 to 1957, 29 games) and then the Montreal Alouettes (1957, 8 games) of the Canadian Football League. Career He was called to the bar of Ontario in 1960 and practiced law at Fasken & Calven before becoming a senior partner at Stikeman Elliott. He was designated Queen's Counsel in 1975 and was also a lecturer at both the Osgoode Hall Law School and the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. He authored several books on the law, including a leading text on the law of evidence. Sopinka was involved with several high-profile cases, including acting on behalf of Susan Nelles when she sued the government of Ontario and the Toronto police for malicious prosecution after the withdrawal of charges against her for murdering babies at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. An inquiry into her case exonerated her and she won damages from the government for her ordeal. In 1986 he represented the Civil Liberties Commission of the Ukrainian Canadian community, the CLC at the Desch√™nes Commission of Inquiry on War Criminals and argued against the deportation of suspected war criminals to their native lands, particularly the Soviet Union. He also served as counsel to the William Parker Inquiry that looked into the conduct of former cabinet minister Sinclair Stevens. Appointment to the Supreme Court of Canada A noted trial lawyer, he was appointed directly to the Supreme Court of Canada on May 24, 1988 without ever having been a judge. At the time it was highly unusual for a Supreme Court of Canada appointee to have had no prior judicial experience. Following Sopinka's death, the court's next appointee, Ian Binnie, also came directly from private practice. The John Sopinka Courthouse named for the first Ukrainian-Canadian justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. Death Sopinka died in Ottawa on November 24, 1997 of a blood disease. Posthumous recognition In 1999, a new courthouse in downtown Hamilton was named in his honour. The John Sopinka Courthouse has 18 courtrooms, accommodating Hamilton's civil, criminal, and small claims courts. The government of Canada had purchased and renovated the Dominion Public Building for an estimated $64-million. The building was erected in 1935-36 and served as the main post office until 1991. Also in 1999, the Sopinka Cup was established. This is a national mock trial competition open to law students from law faculties all over Canada. In 2000, the volume Ruled by Law: Essays in Memory of Mr. Justice John Sopinka was published as a special edition of the Supreme Court Law Review (volume 12, second series). Many of the contributors were former law clerks of John Sopinka who had gone on to become law professors. The collection was reprinted by Butterworths Canada as a free- standing volume in 2003.

Early life Johnson was born in Charleston, South Carolina on October 31, 1905, to Margaret Moultrie and William Johnson. When he was 10, his older brother Willie was accused of killing a white man. Afraid of a possible lynch mob, his parents mortgaged their tiny home to raise money to send Willie up north to live with relatives.Harlem Godfather: The Rap on My Husband, Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson Johnson's nickname \\"Bumpy\\" is derived from a bump on the back of his head. As Johnson grew older, his parents worried about his short temper and insolence towards whites, and in 1919 he was sent to live with his older sister Mabel in Harlem. Johnson dropped out of high school and begin working unruly jobs. Gangster William Hewett started to notice him. Johnson then began working for him and this was a beginning to his life of crime. Criminal career Johnson was an associate of numbers queen Madame Stephanie St. Clair. He became St Clair's principal lieutenant in the 1930s. Johnson and St. Clair aimed to start a war against New York mob boss Dutch Shultz. The fight resulted in more than 40 murders and several kidnappings. Eventually the fight on their end was lost, ending with a deal for Johnson. In 1952, Johnson's activities were reported in the celebrity people section of Jet. That same year, Johnson was sentenced to 15 years in prison for a drug conspiracy conviction related to heroin. Two years later, Jet reported in its crime section that Johnson began his sentence after losing an appeal. He served the majority of that sentence at Alcatraz Prison in San Francisco Bay, California as inmate No. 1117, and was released in 1963 on parole. Johnson was arrested more than 40 times and served two prison terms for narcotics-related charges. In December 1965, Johnson staged a sit-down strike in a police station, refusing to leave, as a protest against their continued surveillance. He was charged with \\"refusal to leave a police station\\" but was acquitted by a judge.p.103+ Death Johnson was under a federal indictment for drug conspiracy when he died of congestive heart failure on July 7, 1968, at the age of 62. He was at Wells Restaurant in Harlem shortly before 2 a.m., and the waitress had just served him coffee, a chicken leg, and hominy grits, when he keeled over clutching his chest. Friend Frank Lucas claims to have been present (yet this has been refuted), and someone ran down the street to the Rhythm Club to get his childhood friend, Junie Byrd. When Byrd arrived, Lucas cradled Bumpy in his arms, and Johnson briefly opened his eyes and smiled, then fell into unconsciousness. He was taken, by ambulance, to Harlem Hospital where he was pronounced dead. He is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in The Bronx, New York City.  Personal life  Johnson married Mayme Hatcher just six months from their first time meeting each other. They were married in October 1948. Johnson had two daughters, Ruthie and Elease, one of which is from another relationship. His wife died in May 2009 at the age of 94. In popular culture=Film * In the 1971 film Shaft, Moses Gunn portrays \\"Bumpy Jonas\\", a character based upon Johnson. * In the 1972 film Come Back Charleston Blue, the title character is loosely based on Bumpy Johnson, a criminal who is looked upon as a positive role model among the people. * In the 1979 film Escape from Alcatraz, Paul Benjamin plays a character based on Bumpy Johnson, \\"English\\". * In the 1984 film The Cotton Club, Laurence Fishburne plays a character based on Bumpy Johnson, \\"Bumpy Rhodes\\". * In the 1997 film Hoodlum, Johnson is again portrayed by Fishburne. * In the 1999 film Life, musician Rick James plays a Harlem gangster, \\"Spanky Johnson\\", who was loosely inspired by Bumpy Johnson. * In the 2007 film American Gangster, Johnson is portrayed by Clarence Williams III . Television * In an episode of Unsolved Mysteries, it is reported that Johnson allegedly helped the three escapees of Alcatraz get to the shores of San Francisco. It is said that he arranged for a boat to pick the three men up out of the bay. The boat then dropped the escapees off at Pier 13 in San Francisco's Hunters Point District. * In the second episode of the third season of HBO's The Wire, \\"All Due Respect\\", Bumpy is mentioned just before Tree (dealer for Cheese Wagstaff) kills Jelly over a dog fight in which Cheese's dog lost. Three low-level gangsters discuss an incident when Bumpy allegedly attacked a police station single-handedly. This is expanded upon in Richard Price's audio commentary for that episode. * Cable network Epix premiered the crime drama television series Godfather of Harlem in Fall 2019. Forest Whitaker plays Johnson. The series was created by executive producers Markuann Smith, Chris Brancato and Paul Eckstein, who are producing with ABC Signature Studios.

Born in Porsgrunn, Norway, Capaldi won 22 caps for Northern Ireland at full international level, 21 of which were as a Plymouth Argyle player, a total that made him the club's most-capped international. He played in the Football League for Plymouth Argyle, Cardiff City, Leeds United, Morecambe and Oxford United. Capaldi can play in defence as a left back or as a left-sided midfielder. Club career Capaldi began his career at Birmingham City, where he came through the youth ranks as a trainee. During his time at Birmingham he spent time on loan at Hereford United before signing for Plymouth Argyle near the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season without making a first- team appearance for Birmingham. Capaldi sat out for much of the first part of the 2004‚Äì05 season after breaking a leg during a game, but in December 2004 he signed a two-year extension to his contract, to run until June 2007. Cardiff City Capaldi rejected a new contract with Plymouth and on 25 May 2007 he signed a three-year contract with Cardiff City, joining on a Bosman free transfer. He began the season as first-choice left back but after struggling to perform consistently found himself dropped from the side, being replaced by Chris Gunter. Following the sale of Gunter on 1 January, he returned to the first-team squad and began to settle more comfortably into the side, including playing in all six of the club's matches on their run to the 2008 FA Cup Final. The start of the 2008‚Äì09 season saw Capaldi sidelined due to a knee problem. After sitting out the first fortnight of the season, he returned to first-team action on 26 August in a 2‚Äì1 League Cup victory over Milton Keynes Dons, only for him to suffer a recurrence of the problem. Capaldi spent over three months on the sidelines with the injury and, after being named on the bench for several games, made his return as a substitute for Chris Burke during a 0‚Äì0 draw with Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup on 25 January. He featured in just five matches for the club throughout the season. On 18 August 2009, Capaldi was sent off for a second bookable offence away to his old club Plymouth Argyle. Cardiff won the match 3‚Äì1 with Michael Chopra scoring a hat-trick. Capaldi returned to the side in a 3‚Äì2 loss to South Wales rivals Swansea City, playing on the left of midfield in place of the injured Peter Whittingham. However, due to a lack of appearances, Capaldi stated that he might need to look elsewhere for first-team football. Loan to Leeds United On 26 November 2009, Capaldi joined League One leaders Leeds United on loan until 4 January 2010, with a view to a permanent move, and was given permission to play for Leeds in the FA Cup. Having been recommended a move to Leeds by the club's assistant manager Glynn Snodin and Cardiff teammate Warren Feeney, he made his debut in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Kettering Town in the second round of the FA Cup, before making his league debut against Oldham Athletic. After playing against Huddersfield Town, Capaldi reiterated his desire to join Leeds permanently in January. Capaldi was dropped for the replay against Kettering, being replaced by Aidy White, but White suffered an injury during the game and Capaldi came on to replace him. With White still out injured in the next game Capaldi came back into the starting line-up for a 0‚Äì0 draw with Brentford. However, with the return of Andy Hughes from injury, Capaldi was dropped from the squad for four consecutive games before being an unused substitute for the final game of his loan spell, a 1‚Äì0 win over Manchester United in the FA Cup. Return to Cardiff City Capaldi returned to Cardiff on 5 January 2010 after Leeds decided against extending his loan spell. He made nine appearances during the final five months of the season before being released at the end of the year. Later years Following his release, Capaldi spent time on trial with Plymouth Argyle, Crystal Palace and Heart of Midlothian before signing a short-term deal with Morecambe on 16 September 2010, reuniting him with former Northern Ireland manager Sammy McIlroy. Capaldi had a trial with Scottish Premier League club Aberdeen in early 2011 and featured in two friendly matches. In June 2011, Capaldi joined Oxford United and signed a two-year contract. Injury kept him out of the first-team squad for almost the whole 2011‚Äì12 season: he finally made his Oxford debut in a 3‚Äì0 defeat to Port Vale on the final day of the season. Capaldi was released by Oxford when his contract expired at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 season; he made 39 appearances for the club in league and cup competitions. He spent time on trial at Tamworth that summer and signed in August ahead of the club's new season in the Conference Premier. International career Although born in Norway to a Scottish father and raised in Birmingham, Capaldi chose to represent Northern Ireland. He was eligible because his grandmother was born in Limavady. Capaldi has represented Northern Ireland 22 times at senior level, making his debut in March 2004 in a 1‚Äì0 victory over Estonia as well as playing in their famous 1‚Äì0 victory over England in September 2005. Capaldi broke Welshman Moses Russell's 78-year-old record for international appearances made by a Plymouth Argyle player when he was awarded his 21st cap in a friendly against Wales. Personal life Capaldi was born in Porsgrunn, Norway, while his Scottish father, John Capaldi, was playing for the local team Pors Grenland. His father also played for Aston Villa and Motherwell and had a spell managing Bolehall Swifts.

In primates, the thumbs and big toes have two phalanges while the other digits have three phalanges. The phalanges are classed as long bones. Structure The phalanges in a human hand The phalanges are the bones that make up the fingers of the hand and the toes of the foot. There are 56 phalanges in the human body, with fourteen on each hand and foot. Three phalanges are present on each finger and toe, with the exception of the thumb and large toe, which possess only two. The middle and far phalanges of the fourth and fifth toes are often fused together (symphalangism). The phalanges of the hand are commonly known as the finger bones. The phalanges of the foot differ from the hand in that they are often shorter and more compressed, especially in the proximal phalanges, those closest to the torso. A phalanx is named according to whether it is proximal, middle, or distal and its associated finger or toe. The proximal phalanges are those that are closest to the hand or foot. In the hand, the prominent, knobby ends of the phalanges are known as knuckles. The proximal phalanges join with the metacarpals of the hand or metatarsals of the foot at the metacarpophalangeal joint or metatarsophalangeal joint. The intermediate phalanx is not only intermediate in location, but usually also in size. The thumb and large toe do not possess a middle phalanx. The distal phalanges are the bones at the tips of the fingers or toes. The proximal, intermediate, and distal phalanges articulate with one another through interphalangeal articulations. Bone anatomy Each phalanx consists of a central part, called the body, and two extremities. * The body is flat on either side, concave on the palmar surface, and convex on the dorsal surface. Its sides are marked with rough areas giving attachment to fibrous sheaths of flexor tendons. It tapers from above downwards. * The proximal extremities of the bones of the first row present oval, concave articular surfaces, broader from side to side than from front to back. The proximal extremity of each of the bones of the second and third rows presents a double concavity separated by a median ridge. * The distal extremities are smaller than the proximal, and each ends in two condyles (knuckles) separated by a shallow groove; the articular surface extends farther on the palmar than on the dorsal surface, a condition best marked in the bones of the first row. In the foot, the proximal phalanges have a body that is compressed from side to side, convex above, and concave below. The base is concave, and the head presents a trochlear surface for articulation with the second phalanx. The middle are remarkably small and short, but rather broader than the proximal. The distal phalanges, as compared with the distal phalanges of the finger, are smaller and are flattened from above downward; each presents a broad base for articulation with the corresponding bone of the second row, and an expanded distal extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe. =Distal phalanx= In the hand, the distal phalanges are flat on their palmar surface, small, and with a roughened, elevated surface of horseshoe form on the palmar surface, supporting the finger pulp. The flat, wide expansions found at the tips of the distal phalanges are called apical tufts. They support the fingertip pads and nails. The phalanx of the thumb has a pronounced insertion for the flexor pollicis longus (asymmetric towards the radial side), an ungual fossa, and a pair of unequal ungual spines (the ulnar being more prominent). This asymmetry is necessary to ensure that the thumb pulp is always facing the pulps of the other digits, an osteological configuration which provides the maximum contact surface with held objects. In the foot, the distal phalanges are flat on their dorsal surface. It is largest proximally and tapers to the distal end. The proximal part of the phalnx presents a broad base for articulation with the middle phalanx, and an expanded distal extremity for the support of the nail and end of the toe. The phalanx ends in a crescent-shaped rough cap of bone epiphysis ‚Äî the apical tuft (or ungual tuberosity/process) which covers a larger portion of the phalanx on the volar side than on the dorsal side. Two lateral ungual spines project proximally from the apical tuft. Near the base of the shaft are two lateral tubercles. Between these a V-shaped ridge extending proximally serves for the insertion of the flexor pollicis longus. Another ridge at the base serves for the insertion of the extensor aponeurosis. The flexor insertion is sided by two fossae ‚Äî the ungual fossa distally and the proximopalmar fossa proximally. Development The number of phalanges in animals is often expressed as a \\"phalangeal formula\\" that indicates the numbers of phalanges in digits, beginning from the innermost medial or proximal. For example, humans have a 2-3-3-3-3 formula for the hand, meaning that the thumb has two phalanges, whilst the other fingers each have three. In the distal phalanges of the hand the centres for the bodies appear at the distal extremities of the phalanges, instead of at the middle of the bodies, as in the other phalanges. Moreover, of all the bones of the hand, the distal phalanges are the first to ossify. Function Thumb and index finger of right hand during pad-to-pad precision grasping in ulnar view. The distal phalanges of ungulates carry and shape nails and claws and these in primates are referred to as the ungual phalanges. History of phalanges=Etymology The term phalanx or phalanges refers to an ancient Greek army formation in which soldiers stand side by side, several rows deep, like an arrangement of fingers or toes. In animals Most land mammals including humans have a 2-3-3-3-3 formula in both the hands (or paws) and feet. Primitive reptiles usually had the formula 2-3-4-4-5, and this pattern, with some modification, remained in many later reptiles and in the mammal-like reptiles. The phalangeal formula in the flippers of cetaceans (marine mammals) varies widely due to hyperphalangy (the increase in number of phalanx bones in the digits). In humpback whales, for example, the phalangeal formula is 0/2/7/7/3; in pilot whales the formula is 1/10/7/2/1.Cooper et al, \\"Review and experimental evaluation of the embryonic development and evolutionary history of flipper development and hyperphalangy in dolphins (Cetacea: Mammalia)\\", ResearchGate, doi: 10.1002/dvg.23076. October 2017 In vertebrates, proximal phalanges have a similar placement in the corresponding limbs, be they paw, wing or fin. In many species, they are the longest and thickest phalanx (\\"finger\\" bone). The middle phalanx also a corresponding place in their limbs, whether they be paw, wing, hoof or fin. The distal phalanges are cone-shaped in most mammals, including most primates, but relatively wide and flat in humans. =Primates= thumbMorphological comparisons of pollical distal phalanges in African apes, extant humans and selected hominins. Note that, although with several morphological differences, all the features related to refined manipulation in modern humans are already present in the late Miocene Orrorin. The morphology of the distal phalanges of human thumbs closely reflects an adaptation for a refined precision grip with pad-to-pad contact. This has traditionally been associated with the advent of stone tool-making. However, the intrinsic hand proportions of australopiths and the resemblance between human hands and the short hands of Miocene apes, suggest that human hand proportions are largely plesiomorphic (as found in ancestral species) ‚Äî in contrast to the derived elongated hand pattern and poorly developed thumb musculature of other extant hominoids. In Neanderthals, the apical tufts were expanded and more robust than in modern and early upper Paleolithic humans. A proposal that Neanderthal distal phalanges was an adaptation to colder climate (than in Africa) is not supported by a recent comparison showing that in hominins, cold-adapted populations possessed smaller apical tufts than do warm-adapted populations. In non-human, living primates the apical tufts vary in size, but they are never larger than in humans. Enlarged apical tufts, to the extent they actually reflect expanded digital pulps, may have played a significant role in enhancing friction between the hand and held objects during Neolithic toolmaking. Among non-human primates phylogenesis and style of locomotion appear to play a role in apical tuft size. Suspensory primates and New World monkeys have the smallest apical tufts, while terrestrial quadrupeds and Strepsirrhines have the largest. A study of the fingertip morphology of four small-bodied New World monkey species, indicated a correlation between increasing small-branch foraging and reduced flexor and extensor tubercles in distal phalanges and broadened distal parts of distal phalanges, coupled with expanded apical pads and developed epidermal ridges. This suggests that widened distal phalanges were developed in arboreal primates, rather than in quadrupedal terrestrial primates. =Other mammals= Skeleton of orangutan, dog, swine, cattle, tapir, and horse In ungulates (hoofed mammals) the forelimb is optimized for speed and endurance by a combination of length of stride and rapid step; the proximal forelimb segments are short with large muscles, while the distal segments are elongated with less musculature. In two of the major groups of ungulates, odd- toed and even-toed ungulates, what remain of the \\"hands\\" ‚Äî the metacarpal and phalangeal bones ‚Äî are elongated to the extent that they serve little use beyond locomotion. The giraffe, the largest even-toed ungulate, has large terminal phalanges and fused metacarpal bones able to absorb the stress from running. The sloth spends its life hanging upside-down from branches, and has highly specialized third and fourth digits for the purpose. They have short and squat proximal phalanges with much longer terminal phalanges. They have vestigial second and fifth metacarpals, and their palm extends to the distal interphalangeal joints. The arboreal specialization of these terminal phalanges makes it impossible for the sloth to walk on the ground where the animal has to drag its body with its claws.

The film is set in and around a state secondary school in the Abronhill district of Cumbernauld. Gregory's Girl was ranked No. 30 in the British Film Institute's list of the top 100 British films and No. 29 on Entertainment Weeklys list of the 50 best high school movies. Plot Gregory Underwood (John Gordon Sinclair) is an awkward teenager who plays in his school football team. They are not doing very well, so the coach (Jake D'Arcy) holds a trial to find new players. Dorothy (Dee Hepburn) shows up and, despite the coach's sexist misgivings, proves to be a very good player. She subsequently takes Gregory's place as centre forward, and Gregory in turn replaces his friend Andy (Robert Buchanan) as goalkeeper. Gregory is all for her making the team, as he finds her very attractive. However, he has to compete for her attention with all the other boys who share the same opinion. Gregory initially confides in his best friend Steve (William Greenlees), the most mature of Gregory's circle of friends, and asks him for help in attracting Dorothy. Steve, however, is unable to assist him. Acting on the advice of his precocious 10-year-old sister Madeleine (Allison Forster), he awkwardly asks Dorothy out on a date. She accepts, but Dorothy's friend, Carol (Caroline Guthrie), shows up at the rendezvous instead and informs Gregory that something had come up; Dorothy will not be able to make it. He is disappointed, but Carol talks him into taking her to the chip shop. When they arrive, she hands him off to another friend, Margo (Carol Macartney), and leaves. By then, Gregory is rather confused, but goes for a walk with the new girl. On their stroll, they encounter a waiting Susan (Clare Grogan), another of Dorothy's friends, and Margo leaves. Susan confesses that it was all arranged by her friends, including Dorothy. She explains, \\"It's just the way girls work. They help each other.\\" They go to the park and talk. At the date's end, Gregory is more than pleased with Susan, and the two kiss numerous times on his doorstep before calling it a night and arranging a second date. Madeleine, who had been watching from the window, quizzes him on his date and calls him a liar when he claims he did not kiss Susan. Gregory's friends, Andy and Charlie (Graham Thompson), are even more inept with girls but see Gregory at various times with three apparent dates, and are envious of his new success. They try to hitchhike to Caracas, where Andy has heard the women greatly outnumber the men, but fail at that as well.

After casting, Hepburn was given six weeks of intensive football training at Partick Thistle F.C. Filming of exterior scenes at Gregory's school took place at Abronhill High School. As the film had a small budget, the actors supplied many of their own clothes; Hepburn's white shorts were borrowed from her sister. A person in a penguin costume is seen at various points in the film for no apparent reason. Inside the suit was Christopher Higson, son of production supervisor Paddy Higson. The film was re-dubbed with rather Anglicized Scottish accents for the original American theatrical release. Both versions are available on the American DVD release from MGM Home Entertainment. The film's cast reunited for the 30th anniversary of its release in 2010, and a clip from the film featuring Hepburn was part of the opening ceremony at the London 2012 Summer Olympics. Release There was a charity premier in Glasgow on 3 May 1981. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 5 May 2014. Reception=Critical response Film critic Roger Ebert liked the film's direction, and wrote \\"Bill Forsyth's Gregory's Girl is a charming, innocent, very funny little movie about the weird kid. ... The movie contains so much wisdom about being alive and teenage and vulnerable that maybe it would even be painful for a teenager to see it. ... Maybe only grown- ups should see this movie. You know, people who have gotten over the pains of unrequited love (hollow laugh).\\"Ebert, Roger. Chicago Sun-Times, film review, 1 January 1981. Accessed: 3 December 2007. The staff at Variety liked the work of the young cast and Forsyth's direction, and wrote, \\"Filmmaker Bill Forsyth, whose friendly, unmalicious approach recalls that of Ren√© Clair, is concerned with young students (in particular, a soccer team goalie, Gregory) seeking out the opposite sex. ... As Gregory, John Gordon Sinclair is adept at physical comedy. Hepburn is properly enigmatic as the object of his desire, with ensemble approach giving Greg's precocious 10-year-old sister played by Allison Forster a key femme role.\\" Critic Richard Skorman wrote, \\"Forsyth does a good job of making light of the tender part in [Gregory's] teenage psyche, and his friends and little sister in particular are quirky and lovable. Unlike the film's American counterparts, Gregory's Girl is refreshingly free of mean- spirited characters and horny young studs bemoaning their virginity.\\"Skorman, Richard.

He served as Provisional President of Chile between 1826 and 1827.Memoria Chilena Sobre Agust√≠n Eyzaguirre A.Icarito sobre Agust√≠n Eyzaguirre A. Early life He was born in Santiago, Chile, the son of the Basque Domingo Eyzaguirre Escutasolo and of Mar√≠a Rosa de Aretxabala y Alday. He studied law and theology at the Real Universidad de San Felipe, graduating in 1789. Originally he wanted to become a priest, but later changed his mind, and decided to take over the family hacienda in Calera de Tango. He married Mar√≠a Teresa de Larra√≠n y Guzm√°n Peralta on September 13, 1808. During all the rest of his life he dedicated himself to the commerce and the management of his lands. Political career During the first days of the revolt of Chile against Spanish domination in 1810 he was a member of the municipal corporation of Santiago, and joined the revolutionary cause with enthusiasm. He began his political career in 1812, when he was elected deputy to the first congress. When, in 1813, General Jos√© Miguel Carrera marched to meet the invasion of Brigadier Antonio Pareja, the senate appointed a temporary government, and Eyzaguirre was elected a member of the Junta de Gobierno established in March, 1813, along with Jos√© Miguel Infante and Jos√© Ignacio Cienfuegos, and which lasted until March 7, 1814. He took an active part in founding the national academy and many schools, and in promulgating the liberty of the press; and during this administration the first republican paper was printed at Santiago. After the Battle of Rancagua, in October 1814, he, with other patriots, was imprisoned on the Island of Juan Fernandez, and all his property was confiscated. He returned after the Battle of Chacabuco, (February 12, 1817) that restored the exiles to their families. During the presidency of Bernardo O'Higgins, Eyzaguirre retired to private life and devoted himself to his commercial interests. During this time he organized the famous Calcutta Company, for direct trade between Valpara√≠so and the East Indies, and thus was the first that caused the Chilean flag to float in Asiatic seas. On January 28, 1823, he again became a member, together with Jos√© Miguel Infante y Rojas and Fernando Err√°zuriz Aldunate, of the ruling Government Junta that took over from the resigned Supreme Director Bernardo O'Higgins, and lasted until April 4, 1823, when Ram√≥n Freire assumed as the new Supreme Director. On July 8, 1826 Manuel Blanco Encalada was elected President, while he was elected Vice President. They took office on August 14, 1826. Upon the resignation of president Blanco Encalada, he assumed the office of president on September 11, 1826.  Administration  As president (1826) His short government was marked by the financial difficulties that had caused the resignation of his predecessor. He found the treasury broke, with absolutely no sources of revenue since the complete administrative breakdown of the country prevented the government from collecting any taxes. There was no money to pay administrative personnel, and what was worse for the political situation of the time, the army was unpaid also. Immediately upon his assuming office he had to deal first with some incidents in Chill√°n, and then with an insurrection in the island of Chilo√© that was trying to break away from the control of the central government and return to the protection of Spain. The rebellion was very brutally suppressed, and 20 people were executed. The problems between the president and Congress that had marked the rule of his predecessor, continued. The federal laws started to cause friction between the new provinces, and the famous highwaymen the Pincheira family, started a new campaign. Another problem was the bankruptcy of \\"Portales, Cea y C√≠a\\", the company in charge of the tobacco monopoly (and more importantly of the foreign debt service.) This bankruptcy became a big scandal, since the conservative opposition pointed out that the cause was the lack of legal security in a broken down country, while the government countermanded with the fact that the State would have to resume the payment of the foreign debt, when it was already bankrupt itself. In the midst of this political bickering, colonel Enrique Campino, with the support of the radical federalist group, organized a military coup with the Santiago garrison, dissolving Congress and imprisoning some conservative ministers, chief among them Diego Portales and Manuel Jos√© Gandarillas. Finally the government managed to control the situation and imprison colonel Campino, but president Eyzaguirre had had enough. On January 25, 1827, he presented his resignation to Congress, which accepted it, and proceeded to name Ram√≥n Freire as Presidente and Francisco Antonio Pinto as Vice President of Chile.  Cabinet Later life After this episode, Eyzaguirre retired from politics, and remained dedicated only to his hacienda until his death. He died in Santiago on July 19, 1837.

Biography William David Forsyth was born on 29 July 1946 in Glasgow, Scotland. After leaving Knightswood School at the age of 17, he spent eight years making short documentary films, having formed Tree Films with fellow Scotsman Charles Gormleyhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/oct/07/guardianobituaries.filmhttp://www.scc.net/~heather/forsyth.html. Forsyth first came to attention with a low-budget film, That Sinking Feeling, made with youth theatre actors and featuring a cameo appearance by the Edinburgh gallery owner Richard Demarco. The relative success of the film was carried to a far higher level by his next film Gregory's Girl in 1981. This featured some of the same young actors, in particular John Gordon Sinclair, as well as the acting debut of Clare Grogan. The film was a major hit and won 'Best Screenplay' in that year's BAFTA Awards. In 1983 he wrote and directed the successful Local Hero, produced by David Puttnam, and featuring Burt Lancaster. It was rated in the top 100 films of the 1980s in a Premiere magazine recap of the decade. Forsyth's next film was the 1984 Comfort and Joy, about a Glasgow radio DJ caught in a rivalry between ice cream companies, which again featured Clare Grogan. The 1987 film Housekeeping, an adaptation of Marilynne Robinson's 1981 novel, was Forsyth's first American work. Bill Forsyth was a favoured director of Sir David Puttnam during Puttnam's term as Columbia Studios chairman. Columbia released the film Being Human (1994) directed by Bill Forsyth, starring Robin Williams and featuring John Turturro. The film was about a man developing throughout his life and had scenes from pre-history, Ancient Rome, 16th-century Spanish conquistadors and modern day New York City. The film was not released fully due to bad reviews. After this experience Bill Forsyth was put off making films. In 1999 he made Gregory's Two Girls as a sequel to Gregory's Girl, with John Gordon Sinclair playing the same character, to mixed reviews.

The term is particularly (and originally) used to describe the use of this formation in Ancient Greek warfare, although the ancient Greek writers used it to also describe any massed infantry formation, regardless of its equipment. Arrian uses the term in his Array against the Alans when he refers to his legions. In Greek texts, the phalanx may be deployed for battle, on the march, or even camped, thus describing the mass of infantry or cavalry that would deploy in line during battle. They marched forward as one entity. The term itself, as used today, does not refer to a distinctive military unit or division (e.g., the Roman legion or the contemporary Western-type battalion), but to the type of formation of an army's troops. Therefore, this term does not indicate a standard combat strength or composition but includes the total number of infantry, which is deployed in a single formation known as a \\"phalanx\\". Many spear-armed troops historically fought in what might be termed phalanx-like formations. This article focuses on the use of the military phalanx formation in Ancient Greece, the Hellenistic world, and other ancient states heavily influenced by Greek civilization.  History  The earliest known depiction of a phalanx-like formation occurs in a Sumerian stele from the 25th century BC. Here the troops seem to have been equipped with spears, helmets, and large shields covering the whole body. Ancient Egyptian infantry were known to have employed similar formations. The first usage of the term phalanx comes from Homer's \\"œÜŒ±ŒªŒ±Œ≥Œæ\\", used to describe hoplites fighting in an organized battle line. Homer used the term to differentiate the formation-based combat from the individual duels so often found in his poems.Phalanx and hoplites. livius.org. 20 November 2008 Historians have not arrived at a consensus about the relationship between the Greek formation and these predecessors of the hoplites. The principles of shield wall and spear hedge were almost universally known among the armies of major civilizations throughout history, and so the similarities may be related to convergent evolution instead of diffusion. Traditionally, historians date the origin of the hoplite phalanx of ancient Greece to the 8th century BC in Sparta, but this is under revision. It is perhaps more likely that the formation was devised in the 7th century BC after the introduction of the aspis by the city of Argos, which would have made the formation possible. This is further evidenced by the Chigi vase, dated to 650 BC, identifying hoplites armed with aspis, spear and panoply. Another possible theory as to the birth of Greek phalanx warfare stems from the idea that some of the basic aspects of the phalanx were present in earlier times yet were not fully developed due to the lack of appropriate technology. Two of the basic tactics seen in earlier warfare include the principle of cohesion and the use of large groups of soldiers. This would suggest that the Greek phalanx was rather the culmination and perfection of a slowly developed idea that originated many years earlier. As weaponry and armour advanced through the years in different city-states, the phalanx became complex and effective.Hanson (1991) pp. 66‚Äì67  Overview  A modern illustration of the Greek hoplites marching in a phalanx formation. The hoplite phalanx of the Archaic and Classical periods in Greece (c. 800‚Äì350 BC) was the formation in which the hoplites would line up in ranks in close order. The hoplites would lock their shields together, and the first few ranks of soldiers would project their spears out over the first rank of shields. The phalanx therefore presented a shield wall and a mass of spear points to the enemy, making frontal assaults against it very difficult. It also allowed a higher proportion of the soldiers to be actively engaged in combat at a given time (rather than just those in the front rank). Battles between two phalanxes usually took place in open, flat plains where it was easier to advance and stay in formation. Rough terrain or hilly regions would have made it difficult to maintain a steady line and would have defeated the purpose of a phalanx. As a result, battles between Greek city-states would not take place in just any location, nor would they be limited to sometimes obvious strategic points. Rather, many times, the two opposing sides would find the most suitable piece of land where the conflict could be settled. Typically, the battle ended with one of the two fighting forces fleeing to safety.Hanson (1991) pp. 88‚Äì89 The phalanx usually advanced at a walking pace, although it is possible that they picked up speed during the last several yards. One of the main reasons for this slow approach was to maintain formation. The formation would be rendered useless if the phalanx was lost as the unit approached the enemy and could even become detrimental to the advancing unit, resulting in a weaker formation that was easier for an enemy force to break through. If the hoplites of the phalanx were to pick up speed toward the latter part of the advance, it would have been for the purpose of gaining momentum against the enemy in the initial collision.Hanson (1991) pp. 90‚Äì91 Herodotus states of the Greeks at the Battle of Marathon, that \\"They were the first Greeks we know of to charge their enemy at a run\\". Many historians believe that this innovation was precipitated by their desire to minimize their losses from Persian archery. The opposing sides would collide, possibly severing many of the spears of the row in front and killing the front part of the enemy army due to the bone-breaking collision.  Pushing  Phalanx in a frieze on the tomb of Pericles, Dynast of Lycia (380‚Äì360 BC). The \\"physical pushing match\\" theory is one where the battle would rely on the valour of the men in the front line, whilst those in the rear maintained forward pressure on the front ranks with their shields, and the whole formation would consistently press forward trying to break the enemy formation. This is the most widely accepted interpretation of the ancient sources thus when two phalanx formations engaged, the struggle essentially became a pushing match. Historians such as Victor Davis Hanson point out that it is difficult to account for exceptionally deep phalanx formations unless they were necessary to facilitate the physical pushing depicted by this theory, as those behind the first two ranks could not take part in the actual spear thrusting.See Hanson,(1989) Ch. 15, for an introduction to the debate No Greek art ever depicts anything like a phalanx pushing match, so this hypothesis is a product of educated speculation rather than explicit testimony from contemporary sources and is far from being academically resolved. The Greek term for \\"push\\" was used in the same metaphorical manner as the English word is (for example it was also used to describe the process of rhetorical arguments) and so does not necessarily describe a literal physical push, although it is possible that it did. For instance, if Othismos were to accurately describe a physical pushing match, it would be logical to state that the deeper phalanx would always win an engagement since the physical strength of individuals would not compensate for even one additional rank on the enemy side. However, there are numerous examples of shallow phalanxes holding off an opponent. For instance, at Delium in 424 BC, the Athenian left flank, a formation eight men deep, held off a formation of Thebans 25 deep without immediate collapse.Lazenby, (2004) p. 89 It is difficult with the physical pushing model to imagine eight men withstanding the pushing force of 25 opponents for a matter of seconds, let alone half the battle. Such arguments have led to a wave of counter-criticism to physical shoving theorists. Adrian Goldsworthy, in his article \\"The Othismos, Myths and Heresies: The nature of Hoplite Battle\\", argues that the physical pushing match model does not fit with the average casualty figures of hoplite warfare nor the practical realities of moving large formations of men in battle.Goldsworthy (1997) pp. 1‚Äì26 in the academic journal War in History This debate has yet to be resolved amongst scholars. Practical difficulties with this theory also include the fact that, in a shoving match, an eight-foot spear is too long to fight effectively or even parry attacks. Spears enable a formation of men to keep their enemies at a distance, parry attacks aimed at them and their comrades, and give the necessary reach to strike multiple men in the opposite formation. A pushing match would put enemies so close together that a quick stabbing with a knife would kill the front row almost instantly. The crush of men would also prevent the formation from withdrawing or retreating, which would result in much higher casualties than is recorded. The speed at which this would occur would also end the battle very quickly, instead of prolonging it for hours. Shields Greek Phalanx against Achaemenid troops. Each individual hoplite carried his shield on his left arm, protecting not only himself but also the soldier to the left. This meant that the men at the extreme right of the phalanx were only half-protected. In battle, opposing phalanxes would try to exploit this weakness by attempting to overlap the enemy's right flank. It also meant that, in battle, a phalanx would tend to drift to the right (as hoplites sought to remain behind the shield of their neighbor). The most experienced hoplites were often placed on the right side of the phalanx to avoid these problems. Some groups, such as the Spartans at Nemea, tried to use this phenomenon to their advantage. In this case, the phalanx would sacrifice its left side, which typically consisted of allied troops, in an effort to overtake the enemy from the flank. It is unlikely that this strategy worked very often, as it is not mentioned frequently in ancient Greek literature.Hanson (1991) pp. 91‚Äì92 There was a leader in each row of a phalanx, and a rear rank officer, the ouragos (meaning tail-leader), who kept order in the rear. The hoplites had to trust their neighbors to protect them and in turn be willing to protect their neighbors; a phalanx was thus only as strong as its weakest elements. The effectiveness of the phalanx therefore depended on how well the hoplites could maintain this formation in combat and how well they could stand their ground, especially when engaged against another phalanx. For this reason, the formation was deliberately organized to group friends and family close together, thus providing a psychological incentive to support one's fellows, and a disincentive, through shame, to panic or attempt to flee. The more disciplined and courageous the army, the more likely it was to win ‚Äì often engagements between the various city-states of Greece would be resolved by one side fleeing before the battle. The Greek word dynamis, the \\"will to fight\\", expresses the drive that kept hoplites in formation.  Hoplite armament  Each hoplite provided his own equipment. The primary hoplite weapon was a spear around in length called a dory. Although accounts of its length vary, it is usually now believed to have been seven to nine feet long (~2.1‚Äì2.7 m). It was held one-handed, with the other hand holding the hoplite's shield (aspis). The spearhead was usually a curved leaf shape, while the rear of the spear had a spike called a sauroter ('lizard-killer') which was used to stand the spear in the ground (hence the name). It was also used as a secondary weapon if the main shaft snapped or to kill enemies lying on the ground. This was a common problem, especially for soldiers who were involved in the initial clash with the enemy. Despite the snapping of the spear, hoplites could easily switch to the sauroter without great consequence.Hanson (1991) The rear ranks used the secondary end to finish off fallen opponents as the phalanx advanced over them. Throughout the hoplite era, the standard hoplite armour went through many cyclical changes.See Wees (2004) pp. 156‚Äì178 for a discussion about archaeological evidence for hoplite armour and its eventual transformation An Archaic hoplite typically wore a bronze breastplate, a bronze helmet with cheekplates, as well as greaves and other armour. Later, in the classical period, the breastplate became less common, replaced instead with a corselet that some claim was made of linothorax (layers of linen glued together), or perhaps of leather, sometimes covered in whole or in part with overlapping metal scales.Snodgrass (1999)Wees (2004) p. 165 Eventually, even greaves became less commonly used, although degrees of heavier armour remained, as attested by Xenophon as late as 401 BC.Xenophon, (1986) p. 184 These changes reflected the balancing of mobility with protection, especially as cavalry became more prominent in the Peloponnesian WarSee Lazenby (2004) pp. 149‚Äì153, in relation to the deprivations of Cyracusian Cavalry and counter-methods and the need to combat light troops, which were increasingly used to negate the hoplite's role as the primary force in battle.Xenophon (1986) pp. 157‚Äì161 \\"The Greeks Suffer From Slings and Arrows\\", and the methods improvised to solve this problem Yet bronze armour remained in some form until the end of the hoplite era. Some archaeologists have pointed out that bronze armour does not actually provide as much protection from direct blows as more extensive corselet padding, and have suggested its continued use was a matter of status for those who could afford it.Wees (2004) p. 189 In the classical Greek dialect, there is no word for swordsmen; yet hoplites also carried a short sword called the xiphos, used as a secondary weapon if the dory was broken or lost. Samples of the xiphos recovered at excavation sites were typically around 60 cm in length. These swords were double-edged and could therefore be used as a cutting and thrusting weapon. These short swords were often used to stab or cut at the enemy's neck during close combat.Hanson (1991) p. 25 Hoplites carried a circular shield called a hoplon (often referred to as an aspis) made from wood and covered in bronze, measuring roughly in diameter. It spanned from chin to knee and was very heavy (8‚Äì15 kg). This medium-sized shield (fairly large for the period considering the average male height) was made possible partly by its dish-like shape, which allowed it to be supported with the rim on the shoulder. This was quite an important feature of the shield, especially for the hoplites that remained in the latter ranks. While these soldiers continued to help press forward, they did not have the added burden of holding up their shield. But the circular shield was not without its disadvantages. Despite its mobility, protective curve, and double straps the circular shape created gaps in the shield wall at both its top and bottom. (Top gaps were somewhat reduced by the one or two spears jutting out of the gap. In order to minimize the bottom gaps, thick leather 'curtains' were used but only by an [unknown] percentage of the hoplites, possibly mostly in the first row only since there were disadvantages as well: considerable added weight on an already heavy shield and a certain additional cost.) These gaps left parts of the hoplite exposed to potentially lethal spear thrusts and were a persistent vulnerability for hoplites controlling the front lines.Hanson (1991) pp. 68‚Äì69  Phalangite armament  The phalanx of the Ancient Macedonian kingdom and the later Hellenistic successor states was a development of the hoplite phalanx. The 'phalangites' were armed with a much longer spear, the sarissa, and less heavily armoured. The sarissa was the pike used by the ancient Macedonian army. Its actual length is unknown, but apparently it was twice as long as the dory. This makes it at least , but appears more likely. (The cavalry xyston was by comparison.) The great length of the pike was balanced by a counterweight at the rear end, which also functioned as a butt-spike, allowing the sarissa to be planted into the ground. Because of its great length, weight and different balance, a sarissa was wielded two-handed. This meant that the aspis was no longer a practical defence. Instead, the phalangites strapped a smaller pelte shield (usually reserved for peltasts, light skirmishers) to their left forearm. Recent theories, including examination of ancient frescoes depicting full sets of weapons and armor, claim that the shields used were actually larger than the pelte but smaller than the aspis, hanging by leather strap(s) from the left shoulder or from both shoulders. The shield would retain handling straps in the inner curve, to be handled like a (smaller) aspis if the fight progressed to sword-wielding. Although in both shield size assumptions this reduced the shield wall, the extreme length of the spear kept the enemy at a greater distance, as the pikes of the first three to five ranks could all be brought to bear in front of the front row. This pike had to be held underhand, as the shield would have obscured the soldier's vision had it been held overhead. It would also be very hard to remove a sarissa from anything it stuck in (the earth, shields, and soldiers of the opposition) if it were thrust downwards, due to its length. The Macedonian phalanx was much less able to form a shield wall, but the lengthened spears would have compensated for this. Such a phalanx formation also reduced the likelihood that battles would degenerate into a pushing match.  Deployment and combat  {style=\\"margin: 0 auto;\\"  Two standard Macedonian enomoti√¶ (32 men each) in loose formation 2 m apart (32 ranks).  The same in dense formation; each file 1 m apart (16 ranks).  The same in locked shields formation; each file 0.5 m apart (8 ranks ‚Äì rightmost file not shown). }  Phalanx composition and strength  The basic combat element of the Greek armies was either the stichos (meaning \\"file\\"; usually 8‚Äì16 men strong) or the enomotia (meaning \\"sworn\\" and made up by 2‚Äì4 stich≈ì, totaling up to 32 men), both led by a dim≈ìrites who was assisted by a decadarchos and two decaster≈ì (sing. decasteros). Four to a maximum of 32 enomoti√¶ (depending on the era in question or the city) were forming a lochos led by a lochagos, who in this way was in command of initially 100 hoplites to a maximum of c. 500 in the late Hellenistic armies. Here, it has to be noted that the military manuals of Asclepiodotus and Aelian use the term lochos to denote a file in the phalanx. A taxis (mora for the Spartans) was the greatest standard hoplitic formation of 500 to 1500 men, led by a strategos (general). The entire army, a total of several taxeis or mor√¶ was led by a generals' council. The commander-in-chief was usually called a polemarchos or a strategos autocrator.  Phalanx front and depth  Hoplite phalanxes usually deployed in ranks of 8 men or more deep; The Macedonian phalanxes were usually 16 men deep, sometimes reported to have been arrayed 32 men deep. There are some notable extremes; at the battles of Leuctra and Mantinea, the Theban general Epameinondas arranged the left wing of the phalanx into a \\"hammerhead\\" of 50 ranks of elite hoplites deep (see below) and when depth was less important, phalanxes just 4 deep are recorded, as at the battle of Marathon. The phalanx depth could vary depending on the needs of the moment and plans of the general. While the phalanx was in march, an eis bathos formation (loose, meaning literally \\"in depth\\") was adopted in order to move more freely and maintain order. This was also the initial battle formation as, in addition, it permitted friendly units to pass through whether assaulting or retreating. In this status, the phalanx had twice the normal depth and each hoplite had to occupy about in width. When enemy infantry was approaching, a rapid switch to the pycne (spelled also pucne) formation (dense or tight formation) was necessary. In that case, each man's space was halved ( in width) and the formation depth returned to normal. An even denser formation, the synaspismos or sunaspismos (ultra tight or locked shields formation), was used when the phalanx was expected to experience extra pressure, intense missile volleys or frontal cavalry charges. In synaspismos, the rank depth was half that of a normal phalanx and the width each man occupied was as small as .  Stages of combat  Several stages in hoplite combat can be defined: Ephodos: The hoplites stop singing their p√¶anes (battle hymns) and move towards the enemy, gradually picking up pace and momentum. In the instants before impact, war cries (alalagm≈ì, sing. alalagmos) would be made. Notable war cries were the Athenian (eleleleleu! eleleleleu!) and the Macedonian (alalalalai! alalalalai!) alalagm≈ì. Krousis: The opposing phalanxes meet each other almost simultaneously along their front. Doratismos: Repeated, rapid spear thrusts in order to disrupt the enemy formation. The use of long spears would keep enemies apart as well as allow men in a row to assist their comrades next to them. The prodding could also open up a man to allow a comrade to spear him. Too hard prodding could get a spear stuck in a shield, which would necessitate someone in the back to lend his to the now-disarmed man. Othismos: Literally \\"pushing\\" after most spears have been broken, the hoplites begin to push with their spears and spear shafts against their opponents' shields. This could be the longest phase. Pararrhexis: \\"Breaching\\" the opposing phalanx, the enemy formation shatters and the battle ends. Cavalry would be used at this point to mop up the scattered enemy.History of the Phalanx. ancientgreekbattles.net 3 September 2006  Tactics  Top: simplified schematic of traditional hoplite order of battle and advance (elite troops in red). Bottom: the diagonal phalanx utilised by the Thebans under Epaminondas. The strong left wing advanced while the weak right wing retreated or remained stationary Dispositions during the Battle of Leuctra, 371 BC. The early history of the phalanx is largely one of combat between hoplite armies from competing Greek city-states. The usual result was rather identical, inflexible formations pushing against each other until one broke. The potential of the phalanx to achieve something more was demonstrated at Battle of Marathon (490 BC). Facing the much larger army of Darius I, the Athenians thinned out their phalanx and consequently lengthened their front, to avoid being outflanked. However, even a reduced-depth phalanx proved unstoppable to the lightly armed Persian infantry. After routing the Persian wings, the hoplites on the Athenian wings wheeled inwards, destroying the elite troop at the Persian centre, resulting in a crushing victory for Athens. Throughout the Greco- Persian Wars the hoplite phalanx was to prove superior to the Persian infantry (e.g. the battles of Thermopylae and Plataea). Perhaps the most prominent example of the phalanx's evolution was the oblique order, made famous in the Battle of Leuctra. There, the Theban general Epaminondas thinned out the right flank and centre of his phalanx, and deepened his left flank to an unheard-of 50 men deep. In doing so, Epaminondas reversed the convention by which the right flank of the phalanx was strongest. This allowed the Thebans to assault in strength the elite Spartan troops on the right flank of the opposing phalanx. Meanwhile, the centre and right flank of the Theban line were echeloned back, from the opposing phalanx, keeping the weakened parts of the formation from being engaged. Once the Spartan right had been routed by the Theban left, the remainder of the Spartan line also broke. Thus, by localising the attacking power of the hoplites, Epaminondas was able to defeat an enemy previously thought invincible. Philip II of Macedon spent several years in Thebes as a hostage, and paid attention to Epaminondas' innovations. On return to his homeland, he raised a revolutionary new infantry force, which was to change the face of the Greek world. Philip's phalangites were the first force of professional soldiers seen in Ancient Greece apart from Sparta. They were armed with longer spears (the sarissa) and were drilled more thoroughly in more evolved, complicated tactics and manoeuvres. More importantly, though, Philip's phalanx was part of a multi-faceted, combined force that included a variety of skirmishers and cavalry, most notably the famous Companion cavalry. The Macedonian phalanx now was used to pin the centre of the enemy line, while cavalry and more mobile infantry struck at the foe's flanks. Its supremacy over the more static armies fielded by the Greek city-states was shown at the Battle of Chaeronea, where Philip II's army crushed the allied Theban and Athenian phalanxes.  Weaknesses  The hoplite phalanx was weakest when facing an enemy fielding lighter and more flexible troops without its own such supporting troops. An example of this would be the Battle of Lechaeum, where an Athenian contingent led by Iphicrates routed an entire Spartan mora (a unit of anywhere from 500 to 900 hoplites). The Athenian force had a considerable proportion of light missile troops armed with javelins and bows that wore down the Spartans with repeated attacks, causing disarray in the Spartan ranks and an eventual rout when they spotted Athenian heavy infantry reinforcements trying to flank them by boat. The Macedonian phalanx had weaknesses similar to its hoplitic predecessor. Theoretically indestructible from the front, its flanks and rear were very vulnerable, and once engaged it may not easily disengage or redeploy to face a threat from those directions. Thus, a phalanx facing non-phalangite formations required some sort of protection on its flanks‚Äîlighter or at least more mobile infantry, cavalry, etc. This was shown at the Battle of Magnesia, where, once the Seleucid supporting cavalry elements were driven off, the phalanx was static and unable to go on the offensive against its Roman opponents (although they continued to resist stoutly and attempted a fighting withdrawal under a hail of Roman missiles, until the elephants posted on their flanks panicked and disrupted their formation). The Macedonian phalanx could also lose its cohesion without proper coordination or while moving through broken terrain; doing so could create gaps between individual blocks/syntagmata, or could prevent a solid front within those sub-units as well, causing other sections of the line to bunch up.Goldsworthy, p. 102 In this event, as in the battles of Cynoscephalae and Pydna, the phalanx became vulnerable to attacks by more flexible units‚Äîsuch as Roman legionary centuries, which were able to avoid the sarissae and engage in hand-to-hand combat with the phalangites. Another important area that must be considered concerns the psychological tendencies of the hoplites. Because the strength of a phalanx depended on the ability of the hoplites to maintain their frontline, it was crucial that a phalanx be able to quickly and efficiently replace fallen soldiers in the front ranks. If a phalanx failed to do this in a structured manner, the opposing phalanx would have an opportunity to breach the line which, many times, would lead to a quick defeat. This then implies that the hoplites ranks closer to the front must be mentally prepared to replace their fallen comrade and adapt to his new position without disrupting the structure of the frontline. Finally, most of the phalanx- centric armies tended to lack supporting echelons behind the main line of battle. This meant that breaking through the line of battle or compromising one of its flanks often ensured victory.  Classical decline and post- classical use  Victorian depiction of a Macedonian phalanx, 4th century BCE. After reaching its zenith in the conquests of Alexander the Great, the phalanx as a military formation began a slow decline, mirrored by the decline in the Macedonian successor states themselves. The combined arms tactics used by Alexander and his father were gradually replaced by a return to the simpler frontal charge tactics of the hoplite phalanx. The expense of the supporting arms and cavalry, and widespread use of mercenaries, caused the Diadochi to rely on phalanx vs. phalanx tactics during the Wars of the Diadochi. The decline of the Diadochi and the phalanx was inextricably linked with the rise of Rome and the Roman legion from the 3rd century BC. Before the Battle of the Caudine Forks, where the clumsiness of the Roman phalanx was displayed by the Samnites (the Romans had originally employed the phalanx themselves)Lendon, p. 182: The phalanx was known to the Romans in pre-Republic days, whose best fighting men were armed as hoplites. but gradually evolved more flexible tactics resulting in the three-line Roman legion of the middle period of the Roman Republic. The phalanx continued to be employed by the Romans as a tactic for their third military line or triarii of veteran reserve troops armed with the hastae or spear.Lendon, pp. 182‚Äì183 Rome would eventually conquer most of the Macedonian successor states, and the various Greek city-states and leagues. These territories were incorporated into the Roman Republic, and as these Hellenic states had ceased to exist, so did the armies which had used the traditional phalanx formation. Subsequently, troops raised from these regions by the Romans would have been equipped and fought in line on the Roman model. However, the phalanx did not disappear as a military tactic altogether. There is some question as to whether the phalanx was actually obsolete by the end of its history. In some of the major battles between the Roman army and Hellenistic phalanxes, such as Pydna (168 BC), Cynoscephalae (197 BC) and Magnesia (190 BC), the phalanx performed relatively well against the Roman army, initially driving back the Roman infantry. However, at Cynoscephalae and Magnesia, failure to defend the flanks of the phalanx led to defeat; whilst at Pydna, the loss of cohesion of the phalanx when pursuing retreating Roman soldiers allowed the Romans to penetrate the formation, where the latter's close combat skills proved decisive. The ancient Greek historian Polybius goes into some detail about the effectiveness of the Roman legion against the phalanx. He deduces that the Romans refused to fight the phalanx where the phalanx was most effective and offered battle only when they felt that they could exploit the clumsiness and immobility of the phalanx. Victorian depiction of a Macedonian phalanx at the Battle of the Carts Spear-armed troops continued to be important elements in many armies until the advent of reliable firearms, but did not necessarily fight in the manner of a phalanx. A meaningful comparison can be made between the classical phalanx and late medieval pike formations. Particular parallels can be seen in the Middle Ages and Renaissance city-states of the Low Countries (modern Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg), the cantons of Switzerland and the city-states of Northern Italy. Armies of the Low Countries were first armed with spears, then pikes, and were defeating French and Burgundian forces by the 14th century. The Swiss first used the halberd in the 14th century but‚Äîoutreached by Austrian cavalry armed with lances‚Äîthe Swiss gradually adopted pikes in the later 15th century. Swiss pike phalanxes of the Burgundian Wars were dynamic and aggressive resulting in the destruction of the 'modern' Burgundian army and the death of Charles the Bold. Some Italian states raised their own pike units as well as employing Swiss mercenary pikemen in the 15th and 16th century. The Swiss were also copied by German landsknechts leading to bitterness and rivalry between competing mercenary units. Military historians have also suggested that the Scots, particularly under William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, consciously imitated the Hellenistic phalanx to produce the Scots 'hedgehog' or schiltron. However, this ignores possible Early Middle Ages use of long spears by Picts and others in Scotland. It is possible that long spear tactics (also found in North Wales) were an established part of more irregular warfare in parts of Britain prior to 1066. The Scots certainly used imported French pikes and dynamic tactics at the Battle of Flodden. However, this battle found the Scots pitted against effective light artillery and advancing over bad ground, which disorganised the Scottish phalanxes and left them easy prey to English longbow shooting and attacks by shorter but more effective English polearms called bills. Some have interpreted contemporary sources as describing the bills cutting off the heads of Scots pikes. Pike and shot became a military standard in the 16th and 17th century. With the development of the bayonet the last major use of pike was the early 18th century with the weapon rapidly disappearing in Western European armies by the time of the Battle of Blenheim. A few pikes or half pikes and a few halberds were retained among regimental colour guards but even these were fast disappearing by the time of Napoleon. The pike was briefly reconsidered as a weapon by European armies in the late 18th and early 19th century as protection for riflemen, whose slower rate of fire made them vulnerable. A collapsible pike was invented but never issued. It was also reconsidered by the Confederate Army at the time of the American Civil War and some were even manufactured but these were probably never issued. Pikes were again manufactured for a short time during World War II, and became known as \\"Croft's Pikes\\". While obsolete militarily, the phalanx as a metaphor of warriors moving forward as a single united block inspired several 20th Century political movements, notably the Spanish Falange and its ideology of Falangism. A kind of phalanx formation appears in the late roman army and byzantine army that is known as phoulkon it had some characteristics of the old greek phalanx and hellenistic style phalanx but it had some modifications for that it could be more flexible and it was more a formation that was used against cavalry than against infantry.

Battle Map of White Hall Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. On December 15, Brig. Gen. John G. Foster's Union troops reached White Hall where Brig. Gen. Beverly Robertson had taken command of Confederate militia holding the north bank of the Neuse River. There was some skirmishing as the Federals set up several artillery units on a hill overlooking the town and Confederate defenses. According to the report of the Union commanders, the Federals demonstrated against the Confederates for much of the day on December 16, attempting to fix the Confederates in position, while the main Union column continued toward the railroad, achieving success of the campaign. Alleged unnamed Local historians dispute this account, claiming that one of the Union objectives of the Goldsboro Campaign (also known as Foster's Raid) was to destroy an ironclad ramming boat that the Confederates were building on the north bank of the Neuse river at that location. This boat (CSS Neuse) was one of several identical boats that were being built in upriver locations throughout the South, their purpose being to break the Union naval blockade. Only one of these boats, the CSS Albemarle, was completed in time to be useful, and succeeded in sinking several Union ships at New Bern, North Carolina, and opening the port to Confederate shipping. The Union plan was to take the bridge at Whitehall (present-day Seven Springs), destroy the CSS Neuse, and proceed by shorter route to destroy the rail line at Goldsboro. The Confederates had a superior defensive position, and they burned the bridge to prevent the Union forces from crossing. The Federals spent most of December 16 bombarding the town with artillery fire to destroy the Confederate defenses and to destroy the boat. Meanwhile, Union riflemen fired at the Confederates defending the boat. Local tradition says the Union riflemen were firing high all day, because the south bank of the river (where the Federals were) is actually higher than the north bank, though the river creates an illusion that the banks are even. Alleged by an unnamed source, Tradition also says that among the Confederate casualties were two free black teenagers, fighting with the local militia. During the two days of battle, Union artillery heavily damaged the town. The CSS Neuse also took some slight damage, and its construction was delayed several weeks. Tradition says that several civilians took refuge in a stone jailhouse, which was eventually destroyed by cannon fire. Near sundown on December 16, fearing they would be caught between Confederate forces from Kinston and others thought to be marching from Goldsboro, the Federals abandoned their attempt to cross the river at Whitehall and withdrew to the west. They crossed the Neuse River between Whitehall and Mount Olive, and continued on to fight an engagement at Goldsboro. Aftermath Both sides claimed victory. The New York Herald published banner headlines announcing the alleged victory, as several New York regiments had taken part. The Union men claimed they had won because they inflicted serious damage on the CSS Neuse, and because the forces resisting the United States were unable to halt the Army's advance. However, the Confederates claim they won, since they inflicted heavier casualties on the attackers than they suffered, prevented the United States from crossing the river, and had kept the gunboat from being totally destroyed. The CSS Neuse was completed late in the war, but she ran aground on a sandbar before reaching the sea and had to be scuttled to prevent her capture.

Lucca occupied and destroyed Pescia during the 13th century, but the town was quickly rebuilt. During the entire Middle Ages Florence and Lucca contended for the city, as the latter was located on the border between the two republics. In 1339, after almost ten years of war, Florence occupied it. The economy of the town was founded on mulberry cultivation and silkworm breeding. Heavily struck by the Black Death, Pescia overcame the demographic and economical depression which had ensued only at the end of that century (15th century). At the end of the 17th century the Grand-duke of Tuscany declared Pescia \\"City of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany\\". In the 19th century the silk production was so important that Pescia was called \\"the little Manchester of Tuscany\\". The economy of the town dropped after a commercial conflict between France and Italy (1888). The passage of Napoleon highly damaged the economy of the city, because he substituted silk with sugar beet. Since 1925 Pesciatins found an alternative economic source in cultivating and trading flowers and olive plants (since the end of the 19th century).

Life Fran√ßaix's natural gifts were encouraged from an early age by his family. His father, Director of the Conservatoire of Le Mans, was a musicologist, composer, and pianist, and his mother was a teacher of singing. Jean Fran√ßaix studied at the Conservatoire of Le Mans and then at the Paris Conservatory, and was only six when he took up composing, with a style heavily influenced by Ravel.\\"Fran√ßaix, Jean Ren√© (23 May 1912, Le Mans).\\" Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music.

Fran√ßaix's first publication, in 1922, caught the attention of a composer working for the publishing house, who steered the gifted boy toward a gifted teacher, Nadia Boulanger (who, after her sister's death in 1918, had devoted her life to conducting, playing the organ and teaching).\\"Boulanger, Nadia.\\" Britannica Concise Encyclopedia. Chicago: Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 2009. Credo Reference. Web. 1 October 2012. Boulanger encouraged Fran√ßaix's career, considering the young composer to be one of the best, if not the best, of her students. Noted pianist and pedagogue Isidor Philipp also taught him. Fran√ßaix himself often played his own works, to public acclaim; notably in the premiere of his Concertino for Piano and Orchestra at the festival of Baden-Baden in 1932. By 1932 Fran√ßaix had his Huit Bagatelles played at the Vienna Festival by the Kolisch Quartet and himself at the piano, while in Paris his Concertino for piano and orchestra was heard in 1933.Landormy P. La Musique Fran√ßaise apr√®s Debussy. Gallimard, Paris, 1943, p368-69. Fran√ßaix's compositions continued to be played during the 1930s in Paris. A string trio (1933), a fantaisie for cello and orchestra, three duos for two sopranos, a sonatine for violin and piano, a quintet, and a serenade for small orchestra (1934). 1935 saw the premiere of his Quadruple Concerto for Flute, Oboe, Clarinet, Bassoon and Orchestra, and 1936 of a piano concerto. Fran√ßaix's music was also used for ballets: Le Roi nu, Les Malheurs de Sophie (both for Paris) and Jeu Sentimental (for Brussels). Fran√ßaix was an accomplished pianist from an early age, earning a First Prize in Piano at the Paris Conservatory, and toured throughout Europe and the U.S. He performed notably in a duo with the French cellist Maurice Gendron, and also performed the Poulenc Two-Piano Concerto with Francis Poulenc for several engagements when Jacques F√©vrier was not available. Fran√ßaix even premiered his concerto for two pianos with his daughter, pianist Claude Fran√ßaix, in 1964. Jean Fran√ßaix's primary occupation was his extraordinarily active compositional career. He remained prolific throughout his life; even in 1981 Fran√ßaix described himself as \\"constantly composing\\", barely finishing one piece before beginning another, and continued thus until his death in 1997. Fran√ßaix was named an Officier de la L√©gion d'honneur in 1991. Music Maurice Ravel said of the young Fran√ßaix to the boy's parents, \\"Among the child's gifts I observe above all the most fruitful an artist can possess, that of curiosity: you must not stifle these precious gifts now or ever, or risk letting this young sensibility wither.\\"\\"Fran√ßaix, Jean (Ren√© D√©sir√©).\\" The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians.

Since he was a virtuoso pianist, many of his works feature the piano, particularly his numerous chamber works which he wrote for nearly every orchestral instrument and standard ensemble. He was a skilled orchestrator, which was reflected in his use of tone colors.

One of his oratorios, entitled L'apocalypse selon St. Jean and written in 1939, \\"employs choral psalmody and full orchestra, with a second instrumental group that included saxophones, accordion, mandolin, and guitar (depicting Hell); the work was performed at the ISCM in Vienna (1932) and Palermo (1949)\\".\\"Fran√ßaix, Jean Ren√© (23 May 1912, Le Mans).\\" The Harvard Biographical Dictionary of Music.

Though he often put his own modern spin on the old modes of expression, he was an avowed neoclassicist who rejected atonality and formless wanderings, and he drew from great literature of the past for his vocal settings. He also wrote ten film scores for director Sacha Guitry. Fran√ßaix's style is marked by lightness and wit (a stated goal of his was to \\"give pleasure\\"), as well as a conversational style of interplay between the musical lines. It changed little throughout his career; while he was influenced by composers he admired (such as Emmanuel Chabrier, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, and Francis Poulenc), he integrated what he picked up into his own distinct aesthetic, which was already evident in his early works.

As a young man, he joined the monastery of Gregory the Theologian in Rostov. There he learned to copy manuscripts and paint icons. He would also have learned Greek and the Greek hagiographic traditions. Later he went to Trinity Monastery, a house founded by Sergius of Radonezh in 1337.\\"Epiphanius the Wise\\", Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature Epiphanius travelled extensively, and is known to have visited Moscow, Constantinople and Mount Athos. Writing Stephen of Perm had been a monk at Rostov; Sergii had founded Trinity monastery. Epiphanius wrote hagiographies of both St. Stephen of Perm and St. Sergius. The latter, Life of Our Holy and Godbearing Father Sergii Thaumaturgus, he started to write a year after the death of Saint Sergius according to his own memories, and his recollection of the accounts of other contemporaries. He finished the writings 26 years after the death of Sergius, i.e., around 1417-1418. There was a rewriting of the work by Pachomius the Serb (–ü–∞—Ö–æ–º–∏–π –°–µ—Ä–±), which is usually more readily available.\\"Pachomius the Serb and his Autograph\\", The National Library of Russia The Life of Sergii Radonezhsky follows well established hagiographical conventions, and contains a number of parallels to scriptural passages. His focus is on the saint's spiritual qualities and therefore does not dwell on his close ties to Prince Dmitry Donskoy. Epiphanius was interested in portraying an idealized account of sanctity, and did so through lengthy panegyrics. His literary style was given the name pletenie sloves, or \\"the weaving/braiding of words\\", and is marked by an abundance of neologisms, in which Epiphanius liked to form a large number of noun or adjective-noun combinations.

On December 17, an expedition under Union Maj. Gen. John G. Foster reached the railroad near Everettsville, aiming to destroy this bridge in order to put an end to the vital supply chain from the port of Wilmington.

Early life Graffman was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish parents. Having started piano at age 3, Graffman entered the Curtis Institute of Music at age 7 in 1936 as a piano student of Isabelle Vengerova. After graduating from Curtis in 1946, he made his professional solo debut with conductor Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra. In 1949, Graffman won the Leventritt Competition. He then furthered his piano studies with Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Music Festival and informally with Vladimir Horowitz. Initial work Upon graduation he played with numerous orchestras and performed concerts and recitals internationally. Over the next three decades, he toured and recorded extensively, performing solo and with orchestras around the globe. In 1964, he recorded Sergei Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini with Leonard Bernstein conducting the New York Philharmonic. He also made a classic recording of Sergei Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra in 1966; it was reissued on CD as part of Sony Classical's \\"Great Performances\\" series in 2006. Probably Graffman's best known recorded performance was for the soundtrack of the 1979 Woody Allen movie Manhattan in which he played George Gershwin's Rhapsody In Blue, accompanied by the New York Philharmonic. Portions of the Philharmonic/Graffman version have been featured countless times in TV and movies over the last quarter century. Injury In 1977, he sprained the ring finger of his right hand. Because of this injury he began re-fingering some passages for that hand in such a way as to avoid using the affected finger. This altered technique appeared to aggravate the problem, ultimately forcing him to stop performing with his right hand altogether by around 1979. Thereafter, Graffman pursued his other interests such as writing, photography, and Oriental art. In 1980, he joined the faculty at the Curtis Institute of Music, where his career had begun. He took over as the school's director in 1986, and added the title of President in 1995, serving in both capacities through May 2006. He has also served on the piano faculty of the Manhattan School of Music. Graffman's finger sprain may have been a trigger for focal dystonia, a neurological disorder that causes loss of function and uncontrollable curling in the fingers. The pianist Leon Fleisher, a close friend of Graffman, suffered from the disorder as well. Later career Shortly after joining the Curtis faculty, he published a memoir, I Really Should Be Practicing. In 1985 he gave the UK premiere of Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Piano Concerto in C-sharp for the Left Hand. Paul Wittgenstein had commissioned the work in the 1920s and played it many times, but it later slipped from the repertoire.Piano Music For the Left Hand Alone Seven left- hand works have been commissioned for Graffman. In 1993, for example, he performed the world premiere of Ned Rorem's Piano Concerto No. 4, written specifically for the left hand, and in 2001 he premiered Daron Hagen's concerto Seven Last Words. The American composer William Bolcom composed Gaea, a concerto for two pianos left hand for Graffman and Leon Fleisher. It received its first performance in Baltimore in April 1996. The concerto is constructed in such a way that it can be performed in one of three ways, with either piano part alone with reduced orchestra, or with both piano parts and the two reduced orchestras combined into a full orchestra. Honours Graffman has received honorary doctoral degrees, was honored by the cities of Philadelphia and New York, and received the Governor's Arts Award by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. His students include the pianists Lydia Artymiw, Lang Lang, Yuja Wang, and Haochen Zhang. ReferencesFurther reading Graffman, Gary (1982). I Really Should Be Practicing. New York: Avon.

She was first introduced as a member of the Mutant Liberation Front in New Mutants (February 1990). Publication history Tempo first appeared in the comic New Mutants issue #86, although in her first cameo appearance she is incorrectly referred to as \\"Strobe\\", which is actually the name of her teammate. Her debut appearance is made in issue #87 of New Mutants in March 1990. Fictional character biography Tempo (alter ego Heather Tucker) is a founding member of the terrorist organization known as the Mutant Liberation Front (MLF). Tempo is a mainstay in the team's adventures, including fighting Wolverine, Sunfire, X-Factor and others in the name of mutant rights, using her time-bending powers. The MLF destroy the Tucker Clinic, an institute for pregnant mothers to undergo prenatal DNA testing to determine whether or not their babies would be mutants, resulting in the death of Dr. Tucker. The story hints that Tempo may have been his daughter.X-Factor #78 (May 1992) Soon after, a tyrannical despot named Reignfire reforms the MLF and tasks them with killing Henry Peter Gyrich. Tempo intervenes to save Gyrich and is exiled from the MLF. After leaving the MLF, Cable invites Tempo to join X-Force but she declines, choosing instead to go to college and put aside the super-powered lifestyle. She is again briefly affiliated with the MLF during Operation: Zero Tolerance. X-Force #67 (June 1997) After M-Day, Tempo is one of the few to retain her powers. She then becomes a member of the reformed Acolytes. When they disband she joins Utopia and works alongside the X-Men. In Age of X, Tempo is transformed into a soldier of Fortress X. Tempo is fatally wounded while battling humans, but before she dies Legacy absorbs her memories.X-Men Legacy #245 Powers and abilities Tempo can manipulate time. She is able to slow or stop her opponents and speed up either herself or her teammates. She has prevented grenades from exploding by keeping them in suspended motion, and was also able to successfully attack Rogue by amplifying Rogue's speed, causing her to crash into a wall while flying. Strain limits how long Tempo can maintain a major time manipulation. While it was never established how long that limit is, she was able to completely freeze the X-Men for several minutes while she and the Acolytes conducted a thorough search of the X-Men mansion.X-Men #202 (Oct. 2007) Tempo can also levitate herself and fly at subsonic speeds.

The name comes from the layout's similarity to that of a typical (mid-20th century or earlier) passenger train car.Cassidy, Frances Gomes. Dictionary of American Regional English.

Railroad apartments are common in tenement buildings or even modern apartment blocks, and are sometimes found in subdivided brownstones. Railroad apartments first made an appearance in New York City in the mid-19th century, and were designed to provide a solution to urban overcrowding.Eisner, Simon; Gallion, Arthur; and Eisner, Stanley. The Urban Pattern. New York: John Wiley and Sons, 1993. Many early railroad apartments were extremely narrow, and most buildings were five or six stories high. Few early buildings had internal sanitation, and bathrooms emptied raw sewage into the back yard. In some cases, one family would take up residence in each room, with the exterior hallway providing communal space.

The prefix for operational shuttles is OV, for Orbiter Vehicle. The suffix is composed of two parts: the series and the vehicle number. Series: * 0 - Non-flight ready shuttles * 1 - Flight ready shuttles The vehicle number is sequentially assigned within the series, beginning with 1. Therefore, there can never be an OV-100 as it would read \\"Orbiter Vehicle Series 1 Vehicle 0\\". Many proposals to build a second generation of orbiters, externally compatible with the current system but internally new, refer to them as \\"OV-200\\" or \\"OV-2xx\\" in order to differentiate them from the \\"current generation\\", the OV-100s. This terminology is informal, and it is unlikely that any Shuttle-derived vehicle built will be given such designation. Orbiter designations *OV-099 - Space Shuttle Challenger, originally STA-099 *OV-101 - Space Shuttle Enterprise, formerly Constitution *OV-102 - Space Shuttle Columbia *OV-103 - Space Shuttle Discovery *OV-104 - Space Shuttle Atlantis *OV-105 - Space Shuttle Endeavour Challenger was originally intended to be used as a Structural Test Article, rather than a flight-capable orbiter; as such, the numbering was changed when it was rebuilt. Enterprise, on the other hand, was intended to be rebuilt into a flight-capable orbiter; it was found to be cheaper to rebuild STA-099 than OV-101, so it remained unflown. The designations were not altered, despite these changes in plans. Other official designations In keeping with this theme, other pieces of ground hardware used by the Space Shuttle program have been given official designations; these include: *OV-095 - a mockup in the Shuttle Avionics Integration Laboratory (SAIL) at Johnson Space Center. *STA-096 - Environmental Control and Life Support System Structural Test Article *STA-097 - Vibro Acoustic (Mid Fuselage) Structural Test Article *MPTA-098 - the Main Propulsion Test Article (see below) *OV-106 - an administrative name given to the set of structural components manufactured to replace those used in the construction of Endeavour; however, the contract for these was cancelled shortly afterwards, and they were never completed.SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM HAER No. TX-116, page 59, note 205 Retrieved 08-06-2017 The 096 and 097 designators were given to structural test articles that were cancelled, but while they exist in some NASA records, the NASA History Office has no official record of STA-096 and STA-097.SPACE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM HAER No. TX-116, page 55 Retrieved 06-24-2014 Unofficial and honorary designations One structural mockup has retroactively been given an unofficial and honorary OV- xxx designation: *OV-098 - Space Shuttle Pathfinder, a mockup in Huntsville, AL While Pathfinder is referred to as OV-098, it should not be confused with MPTA-098 - the Main Propulsion Test Article, a steel frame (looking nothing like an Orbiter) used to test the Space Shuttle Main Engines. Pathfinder was originally a \\"fit check\\" unit, a simple mockup resembling the production Orbiters in size, shape and weight, intended to be used to ensure that ground handling facilities would be sized to handle Orbiters. It was later rebuilt to resemble them cosmetically, and is currently on display with the external tank used during the propulsion tests (designated MPTA-ET). To further add to the confusion, it appears that Pathfinder was never formally numbered, and the OV-098 designation is both unofficial and retroactive. MPTA-098 was later rebuilt into the Shuttle-C mockup during the 1990s; it is currently in storage at the Stennis Space Center.

Written by Dylan and Sam Shepard, the film incorporates three distinct film genres: concert footage, documentary interviews, and dramatic fictional vignettes reflective of Dylan's song lyrics and life. Filmed in the fall of 1975 prior to and during Bob Dylan's Rolling Thunder Revue tour, the film features appearances and performances by Ronee Blakley, T-Bone Burnett, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Allen Ginsberg, Arlo Guthrie, Ronnie Hawkins, Roger McGuinn, Joni Mitchell, Mick Ronson, Arlen Roth, Sam Shepard, and Harry Dean Stanton. Renaldo and Clara was released in its original four-hour form on January 25, 1978 in the United States. Its limited release in theaters in New York City, Los Angeles, and other cities was discontinued after a few weeks following widespread negative reviews. Production Renaldo and Clara was written by Bob Dylan and Sam Shepard. Most of the performers are musicians or members of Dylan's inner circle; the only professional actors in the cast are Sam Shepard, Harry Dean Stanton, Helena Kallianiotes and Ronee Blakley. The style, structure, and thematic elements of Renaldo and Clara were heavily influenced by the French film Les Enfants du Paradis. Similarities between the two films include the use of whiteface (Dylan), the recurring flower, the woman in white (Baez), the on- stage and backstage scenes, and the dialogue of both films' climactic scenes. Also evident is the Cubist approach of the two films, allowing us to see the main characters from the different perspectives of various lovers. Running time is also relatively similar. Many of the artists performing with the Rolling Thunder Revue are featured in the film, which also includes clips of concert performances and footage of Rubin Carter, the subject of Dylan's song \\"Hurricane\\". The film also contains the last known footage of Phil Ochs, who is shown preparing to take the stage at Folk City in October 1975; he committed suicide six months later. The film also features an appearance from another late musician, David Blue, who gives some insight into the 1960s New York City folk music scene while playing an extended game of pinball. Reception Upon its theatrical release in 1978, Renaldo and Clara received poor reviews, and, after opening in New York City and Los Angeles, its initial limited theatrical run was discontinued after a few weeks. The film was also shown in a film theatre in Hampstead, London, in a film theatre in Rialto, Dublin and in the Tyneside Cinema in Newcastle-upon-Tyne in May 1979.http://courierarchive.ncl.ac.uk/sites/default/files/1979-05-02.pdf Later in 1978, Dylan allowed a two-hour edit of the film to be distributed. The shortened version focused more on the concert footage and omitted many of the dramatic scenes. After a small number of showings of the original version on European television, Dylan withdrew the film from distribution. It was shown in two parts 7‚Äì8 July 1980 on German television ZDF; on Finnish television 28 August 1982; 26 December 1983 (Boxing Day) on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. The 4 hour version was also shown 29 May 2011 at the Glasgow Film Theatre. Copies, made from recordings of the television broadcast, circulate among collectors (the first 25 seconds of the tape-to-DVD had 'bad tracking'). The only parts of the movie to be released for consumers are the excerpts found on the bonus DVD accompanying the initial release of Dylan's The Bootleg Series Vol. 5: Bob Dylan Live 1975, The Rolling Thunder Revue. Footage from the film also appeared in the music video of Dylan's 1991 song \\"Series of Dreams\\". To date, the film has yet to see an official release in any format.

The first game in the Spyro series, it stars the title character, a young purple dragon named Spyro, and his dragonfly friend, Sparx, who must journey across the Dragon Kingdom to defeat Gnasty Gnorc, who has overtaken the 5 dragon Homeworlds by trapping the other dragons in crystal and turning their hoard of gems into an army of minions. Spyro the Dragon is an open-ended 3D platformer, featuring large, sprawling levels in which the player must locate collectable items, among which are gemstones, crystallized dragons, and stolen dragon eggs. Spyro's abilities as a dragon include fire breath, a head-on charging attack, and a mid-air glide which he can use to scale large distances, all of which must be used strategically to find items and defeat enemies. Spyro the Dragon started development following the release of Insomniac's debut game, Disruptor, which sold poorly but was generally praised by critics, impressing Universal Interactive enough to encourage them to make a second game. Artist Craig Stitt suggested a game about a dragon, and work began on a new game. Taking inspiration from the film Dragonheart, the game started out as a more mature title with a dark and realistic approach, but the direction was shifted to have a more whimsical and light-hearted tone to appeal to a wider market of consumers. The game was one of the first on the PlayStation to utilize shifting levels of detail among rendered objects, thanks to a panoramic engine developed by Alex Hastings which allowed the game's open-ended nature to be fully realized. Stewart Copeland, the former drummer for The Police, composed the game's music, and the titular character was voice acted by Carlos Alazraqui, alongside additional voices done by Clancy Brown, Michael Gough and Jamie Alcroft. Spyro the Dragon was released by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of a general effort to reach out to a younger age demographic and compete with the more popular kid's platform, the Nintendo 64. Although sales were initially sluggish, it found larger success following the advent of the 1998 holiday season, and went on to sell nearly 5 million copies worldwide. Critics praised the game's graphics and gameplay, while some noted its low difficulty level. The game established Spyro as a well-known platforming mascot on the PlayStation alongside Crash Bandicoot, and two sequels, titled Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon, were later released for the PlayStation in 1999 and 2000, respectively. Although Insomniac gave up the development rights to the Spyro series following the third game, the success of the PlayStation titles lent itself to a continued series of games across various platforms. The game, alongside its two successors, was later remastered as part of Spyro Reignited Trilogy in 2018.  Gameplay  Gameplay on a Sony PlayStation showing Spyro and his companion Sparx in the first boss level \\"Toasty\\". Spyro the Dragon is a 3D platform game; the player controls the titular character as he ventures across the realms of the Dragon World to defeat the antagonistic Gnasty Gnorc, as well as rescue his fellow dragons and recover all of their stolen treasure. Worlds consist of six dragon \\"home worlds\\", each of which acts as a dedicated HUB, containing portals that serve as gateways to different levels. The player must progress from one Homeworld to the next by talking to a balloonist, who transports Spyro to the next world on a hot air balloon after the player has found the required collectibles in the current given world. In addition to regular platforming stages, each Homeworld contains a boss fight and a hidden flight stage that involves flying throughout an environment and destroying a number of objects. The levels in Spyro the Dragon are open-ended, and revolve around exploring and obtaining various collectible items to progress forward in the game. Each stage contains a number of crystallized dragons, whom Spyro must turn back to normal by locating and stepping on their statue bases. These dragons give the player advice on how to progress through the game, as well as their respective locations acting as save points after the dragon has been freed. Another important collectible in the game is the dragons' stolen treasure, which is dispersed throughout each level in the form of multicolored gemstones. These gems are located in numerous different places, including inside enemies, breakable boxes, and treasure chests, and most stages contain a set amount of treasure to be found. There are also stolen dragon eggs that must be reclaimed by chasing and defeating thieves. Finding every collectible in the game unlocks an additional world that otherwise cannot be accessed. Spyro's moveset utilizes his unique abilities as a dragon. Spyro has two main offensive moves, used to attack enemies as well as destroy certain objects: charging, in which Spyro sprints forward and rams into things with his head, and breathing fire. These attacks must be used interchangeably for certain enemies and situations; for instance, some enemies carry fireproof metal armor, meaning that they can only be defeated by charging, while larger enemies can only be hit using fire breath, as they will immediately crush Spyro otherwise. Spyro can also use his wings to glide in midair, letting him travel further distances in the air and access areas otherwise unreachable via a regular jump. Throughout the game, Spyro is accompanied by Sparx, a yellow dragonfly who protects Spyro from taking damage and serves as the player's system of health. Sparx's current health is represented by the color of his body; if Spyro is hurt by an obstacle, such as an enemy or by touching water, Sparx changes colors, with yellow, blue and green representing different subsequent amounts of withheld damage. If the player is damaged too many times, Sparx disappears, leaving Spyro vulnerable to lose a life if he is hurt again. Sparx can be rejuvenated by consuming butterflies, which are found by killing passive creatures such as sheep that roam throughout most levels. Sparx also helps Spyro collect items by retrieving any gems that Spyro passes by.  Plot  In the world of dragons, the Dragon Kingdom consists of five Homeworlds ‚Äì the Artisans, the Peace Keepers, the Magic Crafters, the Beast Makers, and the Dream Weavers ‚Äì which have lived in harmony for many years. One day, a TV interview with a pair of dragons from the Artisan realm catches the attention of Gnasty Gnorc, a gnorc (half gnome and half orc) who was banished from the kingdom due to his abrasive demeanor and sent to an abandoned junkyard, which he renames to \\"Gnasty's World\\". After hearing one of the dragons in the broadcast openly dismiss him as being simple-minded, not a threat and calling him ugly, this makes Gnasty Gnorc lose his temper and unleashes a full-fledged attack on the kingdom. Using his magical powers, he casts a spell across the land that encases every dragon in a crystal shell; he also steals the dragons' prized collection of treasure, turning the gemstones into devious gnorc soldiers to help him take over the dragon worlds. Spyro, a young purple dragon, is the only dragon that manages to avoid getting crystallized by the attack. Aided by his dragonfly companion, Sparx, Spyro eagerly sets out to locate and defeat Gnasty Gnorc. Spyro visits each of the dragon homeworlds, defeating Gnorc's forces who have been set out to stop him. Along the way, he frees the crystallized dragons, who give him advice and urge him to recover any stolen treasure and dragon eggs along the way. He eventually makes his way to Gnasty's World, where he finally confronts and defeats Gnasty Gnorc. After Spyro's quest is over, he has access to Gnorc's treasure portal, which can only be opened if Spyro rescues every dragon in the kingdom, recovers all of the dragons' treasure and retrieves the stolen dragon eggs. A secret ending can then be unlocked by retrieving everything inside of the treasure portal. In this ending, Spyro is seen getting interviewed on TV when another spell is placed on the dragons, prompting Spyro to set out on yet another adventure.  Development  Spyro the Dragon was the second game developed by Insomniac Games, following the release of their first game, Disruptor, in December 1996. Although Disruptor was a commercial failure, its positive critical reception was enough to impress Universal Interactive Studios and encourage the team to continue with their next endeavor. The idea of a game about a dragon was introduced by Insomniac artist Craig Stitt, who suggested the concept out of his own interest in the mythical creature. Initially, the game's tone was far darker and more realistic; according to Insomniac's COO, John Fiorito, who joined the company in 1997 during Spyros development, inspiration was taken in part from the film DragonHeart, and the game was initially \\"realistic and kind of dark and gritty\\" before it eventually took a more whimsical, light-hearted direction. Mark Cerny, an executive at Universal Interactive Studios and the game's producer, advised that the team create a game with more mass market appeal, as the demographics of the PlayStation were decreasing and its selection of children's titles were greatly outnumbered by the Nintendo 64's. According to programmer Peter Hastings, the dragon character was originally going to be named \\"Pete\\", but due to copyright concerns over similarities to the Disney film Pete's Dragon, the name was scrapped. After considering the name \\"Pyro,\\" which was ultimately considered \\"too mature\\", they finally settled on \\"Spyro\\". In-game dialogue was written by Peter Kleiner, and Spyro's character was designed by Charles Zembillas, who had previously done design work on Crash Bandicoot. Spyro was originally going to be green, but the developers worried he would blend in with grass, so they eventually changed him to purple. During development of Spyro, Insomniac had a very close relationship with Crash Bandicoot creator and fellow PlayStation developer Naughty Dog, who had their office located directly across the hall from theirs. The two developers frequently worked together, playing early builds of each other's games and later sharing game technology. As a result, a demo of Crash Bandicoot: Warped was hidden in Spyro, and vice versa. Spyro the Dragon was unique compared to other 3D platform games of the time; Spyro's ability to glide allowed him to travel long distances in the air, meaning that the player could cross almost an entire level if starting from a high enough point. While this made designing levels more difficult for the team, it also meant that levels could be made more open-ended and explorative in nature. To make Spyro‚Äôs controls feel fluid, Matt Whiting‚Äîa NASA engineer who specialized in flight controls‚Äîwas brought on to help with programming camera movement as well Spyro's movement controls. The game's camera was particularly challenging; initially, it always followed directly behind Spyro, but the resulting high-speed movements were found to make several playtesters feel nauseous. This was most evident with Spyro's basic jump, which triggered the camera to quickly tilt up and down, compared by Whiting to the motion of a rocking boat; this was ultimately tweaked so that the camera would stay steady. Spyro the Dragon made use of a 3D panoramic engine, developed by Alex Hastings, that could display far-away objects by utilizing varying levels of detail, a method of rendering which was new and unexplored at the time. The developers believed that the engine would be fitting for the game, as it could allow for more expansive levels that could take advantage of the character's abilities, such as gliding. This dynamic system, used to complement the large and sprawling environments, generated two different versions of a level; one version rendered in high detail and the other a simpler, textureless render. Objects in the player's vicinity were drawn using the detailed render, whereas distant ones were drawn from the simple render. This system allowed objects to be displayed from far distances while adhering to the PlayStation's limited RAM capabilities; it was one of the first video games to make use of such a system. Spyro was coded with efficiency in mind, as 3D rendering technology was new at the time and the game had to fit the limited specifications of the PlayStation. Around 80% of the game's code was written using Assembly, while other parts were programmed in C due to its simplicity and speed. The game's music was composed and produced by Stewart Copeland, formerly the drummer for the British band The Police. Copeland was given early builds of the game's levels, which he played through to get a feel for them and come up with a fitting composition. He was also given game cheats such as invincibility so that he could have an easier time clearing levels. Copeland wrote around three songs per day, all of which he further developed and polished the next day. According to Copeland, each song in the game was written to correspond to a specific level, but this correlation ultimately went unused. Copeland has looked back positively on his work on Spyro, calling the game's music some of his best compositions. Carlos Alazraqui provided the voice of Spyro in the game, and additional voices were done by Clancy Brown, Michael Gough, Jamie Alcroft and Michael Connor. Alazraqui explained in an issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly that he tried to make Spyro's voice sound like \\"a kid at camp that everybody likes.\\"  Release  Spyro the Dragon was first unveiled at the 1998 E3 convention in Atlanta, Georgia. It was then later released in North America on September 9, 1998, and in Europe in October of the same year. According to Sony Computer Entertainment's American Marketing Vice President, Andrew House, at a press party in Las Vegas, the game, along with other upcoming 4th quarter PlayStation releases such as Crash Bandicoot: Warped, A Bug's Life, and Rugrats: Search for Reptar, was part of a general effort to appeal to a wider demographic of younger audiences and provide more games suited for younger players to compete with the Nintendo 64, which had a far larger library of children's titles at the time compared to the PlayStation's largely adult-centric demographic. An advertisement campaign was pushed to promote the game, featuring a character from the game, Toasty the Sheep, protesting against the title character's actions against sheep. The campaign included TV commercials, featuring an actor in an animatronic costume of Toasty, and a promotional website, sheepagainstspyro.com. On August 16, 1999, SCEA announced that the game would be included as a part of their \\"Greatest Hits\\" lineup of budgeted releases alongside other games such as Crash Bandicoot: Warped, Gran Turismo, Cool Boarders 3, and Twisted Metal III, and alongside the announcement of a price drop for the PlayStation console to compete with the highly anticipated launch of the Sega Dreamcast. On December 12, 2012, the game was digitally re-released to the PlayStation Store together with Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage! and Spyro: Year of the Dragon. A remake of the game, alongside its two sequels, was included as a part of the Spyro Reignited Trilogy compilation for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in November 2018, follow by the Nintendo Switch and Microsoft Windows in September 2019. Sales According to Spyros developers, sales were initially slow at the game's launch but quickly began picking up following the holiday season. In the week of November 29, 1998, it was the 3rd best-selling game in the UK, behind Tomb Raider and FIFA 99. At the 1999 Milia festival in Cannes, it took home a \\"Gold\\" prize for revenues above ‚Ç¨20,000,000 in the European Union during the previous year. Spyro the Dragon received a \\"Gold\\" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) by the end of August 1999, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. By December 1999, the game had sold 1,000,000 copies in North America. As of 2007, the title had gone on to sell a total of nearly 5,000,000 units.  Reception  Spyro the Dragon currently holds a score of 85% at GameRankings, based on an aggregate of 18 reviews. IGN's Craig Harris hailed it as the most fun 3D platformer he had played since Crash Bandicoot, writing \\"Two claws up. Way up.\\" Computer and Video Games called the game \\"easily the best 3D platform game on the PlayStation\\", despite noting its largely child-friendly nature. As one of 4 reviewers for Electronic Gaming Monthly, \\"Shawn\\" wrote that \\"Spyro is to the PlayStation what Banjo-Kazooie is to the Nintendo 64\\", and stated that it \\"combines the two most-important aspects in any good game: graphics and gameplay.\\" Also writing for EGM, reviewer \\"Crispin\\" proclaimed that Spyro \\"raises the bar\\" for 3D platformers, and wrote that it had replaced Gex 3D: Enter the Gecko as his favorite \\"PS mascot game\\". Joe Fielder of GameSpot called the game \\"a proficient, fully 3D platform game\\" for the PlayStation, comparing it favorably to one of the more recent platformers on the system, Blasto, and proclaiming that it \\"excels over Blasto in every way imaginable.\\" Despite this, he wrote that the game \\"only gets very, very high marks, instead of outrageously high marks\\", citing its lack of high difficulty as the main factor that made it inferior to games like Super Mario 64 and Banjo-Kazooie. Edge named it the best 3D platform game for the PlayStation, but criticized Spyro's limited abilities and said that the game was not as varied as Super Mario 64. Critics lauded the game's presentation, specifically speaking praise for its graphics, technical performance, and Copeland's music done for the game. GamePro reviewer \\"Slo Mo\\" wrote that the game's graphics and animations gave Spyro \\"the look and feel of an animated film\\" while calling the in-game environments \\"breathtaking\\". Harris wrote that the game \\"utilizes the PlayStation's hardware to the max\\", and praised the quality of the in-game animations; he particularly praised the rescued dragons' talking animations, which he said gave the characters \\"incredible personality.\\" Fielder praised the game's dynamic lighting system and character designs, and noted \\"a near- complete lack of pop-up\\" during gameplay. EGM's \\"Sushi\\" said that the graphics were \\"among the finest\\" on the PlayStation. Fielder spoke positively of Copeland's compositional work, calling it \\"wonderfully atmospheric.\\" Slo Mo described the music as having a \\"catchy, mellow jazz-rock swing to it\\" while also praising the voice work for its wide array of unique voices. Many critics held praise for Spyro's level design and controls, though some noted the game's simplicity and low difficulty level. Fielder called the level design \\"exceptional\\", while Crispin praised the levels for encouraging exploration among players. Sushi called the play controls \\"perfectly tuned\\" whilst Fielder wrote that they worked well both with and without the DualShock's analog stick, although Shawn expressed that controls were unsuited for maneuvering in \\"high-risk areas.\\" The camera system received varying reactions, with Crispin praising it as one of the best in any 3D platformer and Fielder declaring that it fixed the common issues present in most other 3D platform games, while Harris criticized its lack of precision when following the player, stating that it \\"tends to float around on a loose tether\\", and highlighted the camera system as one of the game's only flaws. Fielder wrote that an overabundance of extra lives caused the game to feel \\"like it was aimed at a younger or broader audience,\\" holding the final boss and the bonus level as the only exceptions. Despite praising Spyro, Sushi noted the game's \\"lack of diversity\\" in obstacles and objects leading to \\"repetitive play.\\" Crispin lamented that the common trope of collecting items, while still very fun in Spyro, was starting to become less interesting, while also criticizing the game's boss fights, calling them \\"small, easy and decidedly unBoss-like.\\" Legacy The popularity of Spyro the Dragon helped to push the character of Spyro as a popular platforming mascot for the PlayStation alongside Crash Bandicoot. It was the first game in what became an expansive video game series, spawning 2 more platforming sequels for the PlayStation ‚Äì Ripto's Rage and Year of the Dragon ‚Äì released in 1999 and 2000, respectively. As of the year 2000, the series had sold more than 3.2 million copies in the U.S. and over 4 million copies worldwide. Insomniac stopped developing the Spyro series after Year of the Dragon, as it finished off their 4-game contract with Universal Interactive. Despite this, the series was continued across various different developers, and shifted to several other platforms besides PlayStation. Spyro being their first considerable success, Insomniac went on to develop several other successful video game franchises, including the Ratchet & Clank series of platform games and the more adult-oriented first-person shooter series, Resistance. The game's rendering system, new and unheard of at the time, has gone on to be used in several other 3D video games.

Co-founded in 1950 by editor and future Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau, the publication served as an organ of opposition to the conservative government of Maurice Duplessis. The journal published contributions by intellectuals such as Trudeau, G√©rard Pelletier, Ren√© L√©vesque, Pierre Valli√®res and other intellectuals and activists. In doing so, the journal gained a reputation for its radical viewpoints at a time when anti-Duplessis views were difficult to get into print. The journal was anti-clerical and often criticised the strong influence that the Roman Catholic Church then had in Quebec. It also favoured civil liberties, as shown by its opposition to such measures as the Padlock Law (adopted by Duplessis in 1937) and its support of the Asbestos Strike. Editor Trudeau helped form the Rassemblement, a group devoted to turning the public against Duplessis. This group, combined with Cit√© Libre, helped foster the intellectualism that revived the Quebec Liberal Party, which defeated the Union Nationale in 1960. Many of the themes raised by Cit√© Libre found fruition during Quebec's Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. A number of the journal's contributors went on to take leading parts in that movement. As the 1960s progressed, Quebec society became divided between Quebec nationalists and sovereigntists such as L√©vesque and Valli√®res and Canadian federalists such as Trudeau and Pelletier. This caused a rift among the journal's board members, ultimately leading to the magazine's evolution into a federalist journal. As well, the journal abandoned its earlier interest in socialist ideas and became more and more liberal in orientation. The division among Quebec's left, as well as the entry of a number of Cit√© Libre figures into electoral politics, led to the journal's demise in 1966. Cit√© Libre was revived in July 1991 to help promote Canadian national unity in Quebec and combat the perceived (pro-Quebec nationalist) \\"political unanimism\\" in the province. In this era, the editorship of the magazine was taken over by academics Max Nemni and Monique Nemni.\\"Cite Libre division on display\\". Montreal Gazette, March 26, 1996. In 1998, an English- language version (also under the name Cit√© Libre) was launched; unlike most other bilingual publications, both the French and English versions were identical in their respective content.\\"The English-language Cite libre crosses the Quebec border\\". The Globe and Mail, January 10, 1998. Publication ceased (both in French and English) in 2000, officially because of the magazine's perception that separatism was defeated. Cite Libr√© was further revived in mid-March 2008, in response to what they saw as the destruction of the progressive traditions of the Liberal Party of Canada under the leadership of St√©phane Dion. For the founders, this included Dion's tacit endorsement of the Security and Prosperity Partnership North American Union (SPP-NAU) agenda.

This deaf character communicated only in sign language but interacted positively with other members of the Sesame Street community as a normal citizen and resident of Sesame Street. The person who most often acted as her interpreter was Bob; eventually, he and Linda were portrayed as being in a romantic relationship. Linda made her living as a librarian, and as such she also had an assistant, Micki (Micki Barnett). Micki would read the stories to the children, while Linda communicated them in sign language. The staff writers at Sesame Street were initially unsure of how to write for her. Linda Bove explained, \\"When I joined the cast I found the writers would write about 'How would a deaf person do this?' 'How does a deaf person do that?' And it was just related to my deafness and it didn't feel like they were treating me as a person. I found my character one-dimensional and kind of boring. It showed how brave a deaf person was to do this and that in everday life. I said it was no big deal. I have a sense of humor; why don't you show that? I can be angry over something. Show that I can have a relationship with another person. Maybe a love relationship with Bob. It's not perfect, but... We do have misunderstandings over sign language, make fun of it, and show the funny side of it. It's OK.\\" Linda also appeared in numerous inserts and sketches, notably the famous silent sketches where Maria (Sonia Manzano) would play Charlie Chaplin and Linda would often play a supporting role, either as a pretty woman or as a second Chaplin if two were required for a particular sketch.

The newly-appointed Union commander in Missouri, Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon, had learned that the ostensibly-neutral state militia training in Camp Jackson was planning to raid the federal arsenal in St. Louis. After capturing the entire unit, Lyon marched the captives into town to parole them. En route, hostile secessionist crowds gathered, and after an accidental gunshot, Lyon's men fired into the mob, killing at least 28 civilians and injuring dozens of others. Several days of rioting throughout St. Louis followed. The violence ended only after martial law was imposed, and Union regulars were dispatched to the city. Lyon's actions ensured Union control of St. Louis and of Missouri as a whole for the rest of the war, but also deepened the ideological divisions within a state that had originally sought to remain neutral in the larger conflict. Background Missouri was a slave state, and many of its leaders were Southern sympathizers who favored secession and joining the Confederacy when the Civil War began. However, there were relatively few slaves and slaveowners in Missouri, and only a minority initially favored secession.∆í Nevertheless, by early 1861, both pro- and anti- secession factions in Missouri were organizing military and paramilitary forces. Secessionists organized as \\"Minutemen\\", often assisted by state officials. On February 13, Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost enrolled five companies of St. Louis-area Minutemen as the new 2nd Regiment of the Missouri Volunteer Militia. That same month, a new law banned militia activity outside the framework of this militia, forcing pro-Union activists to organize in secret. On February 28, Missouri elected a Constitutional Convention to amend the state constitution and decide the issue of secession. On March 21, the Convention voted 98 to 1 against secession, but also voted not to supply weapons or men to either side if war broke out. The convention then adjourned. On April 20, several days after the Battle of Fort Sumter, a pro-Confederate mob seized the Liberty Arsenal in Liberty, Missouri, and expropriated about a thousand rifles and muskets. This sparked fears that Confederates would also seize the much larger St. Louis Arsenal, which had nearly 40,000 rifles and muskets -- the largest stockpile in any slave state. Initial Unionist actions Missouri was within the Department of the West, a geographical command of the United States Army commanded by Brigadier General William S. Harney, with its headquarters at Jefferson Barracks in St. Louis. Harney, an elderly career officer, wished to avoid open conflict with secessionist forces. On April 23, the War Department replaced Harney with Captain Nathaniel Lyon as acting commander. Lyon, a passionate Unionist, immediately began enlisting and arming St. Louis Unionists as home guard \\"Missouri Volunteers\\", an action previously ordered by the Secretary of War but not acted upon by Harney. Most of Lyon's early recruits were \\"Forty-Eighters\\" and \\"Wide Awakes\\" (a marching society formed during the 1860 election by the Republican Party). According to one estimate, 80% of the volunteers in the first Missouri Volunteer regiments were German-American immigrants. The anti-slavery foreign- born Germans were prejudicially targeted by pro-slavery native-born Missourians. Lyon's next action, by order of the War Department, was to move the arms held in the St. Louis Arsenal out of reach of Missouri secessionists. Early in the morning of April 26, 1861, nearly 21,000 rifles were loaded on the steamer City of Alton, which carried them across the Mississippi River to Illinois. The remainder were held for issue to Lyon's Missouri Volunteers. Secessionist actions Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson had been elected in 1860 on the ticket of the pro-Union Douglas faction of the Democratic Party, but privately supported secession. Since the Constitutional Convention had voted against secession, Jackson and his fellow secessionists decided to carry it out by seizing St. Louis by force and presenting the people of Missouri with a fait accompli. The most significant obstacle was the St. Louis Arsenal, which was heavily fortified with thick walls. In mid-April 1861, Jackson wrote to Confederate President Jefferson Davis, asking for heavy artillery to breach the walls of the arsenal. His letter was carried by militia officers Colton Green and Basil Wilson Duke.Gerties, Louis S., Civil War St. Louis, University of Kansas Press, 2001, p93 Around May 1, Jackson called out part of the Missouri Volunteer Militia for \\"maneuvers\\" near St. Louis, under the command of Brigadier General Daniel M. Frost. The MVM set up \\"Camp Jackson\\", about northwest of the arsenal. The campsite was located at Lindell's Grove (then outside the city of St. Louis, and today part of the campus of St. Louis University on Lindell Boulevard). Davis agreed to Jackson's request. On May 9, the steamer J. C. Swan delivered the Confederate aid: two 12-pound howitzers, two 32-pound siege guns, 500 muskets, and ammunition, in crates marked as Tamoroa marble. The munitions had been captured by the Confederates when they seized the Federal Baton Rouge Arsenal. MVM officers met the shipment at the St. Louis riverfront, and transported it to Camp Jackson, inland.Parrish, William E, Frank Blair: Lincoln's Conservative, University of Missouri Press, 1998, pp 100 Conflict St. Louis Riot Lyon suspected the Camp Jackson force of conspiring to attack the arsenal. His suspicions were confirmed by personal investigation after he visited Camp Jackson, allegedly disguised as an elderly woman. On May 10, Lyon marched on Camp Jackson with about 6,000 Missouri Volunteers and U.S. Regulars. Lyon forced the surrender of the militia, taking 669 prisoners. General Frost reported that his command was \\"deprived of their arms, and surrendered into the hands of Captain Lyon. After which, whilst thus disarmed and surrounded, a fire was opened upon a portion of it by his troops, and a number of my men put to death, together with several innocent lookers-on--men, women, and children.\\"Report of Brig. Gen. Daniel M Frost, Missouri State Militia, May 11, 1861, War of the Rebellion, Series 1, Volume 3, p.7. Lyon placed the captured soldiers under arrest, and began marching them under guard to the arsenal, where they were paroled and ordered to disperse. But the lengthy march was seen as humiliating by pro-secession residents of the city. Angry secessionists shouted insults at the Union troops, and threw rocks and debris at them. Units composed predominantly of ethnic Germans were particularly targeted, with shouts of \\"Damn the Dutch!\\" This eventually led to gunfire. Exactly what provoked the shooting remains unclear, but the most common explanation is that a drunkard stumbled into the path of Lyon's marching soldiers and fired a pistol into their ranks, fatally wounding Captain Constantin Blandowski of the 3rd Missouri Volunteer Infantry. The Volunteers, in reaction, fired over the heads of the crowd, and then into the crowd. Some 28 civilians were killed, including women and children; more than 75 were wounded.Sandie Grassino and Art Schuermann, Jefferson Barracks (2011), p.33. The incident sparked several days of civil unrest in St. Louis. On May 11, Volunteers were fired upon from windows at 5th and Walnut streets; they returned fire into the mob. Colonel Henry Boernstein, commander of the 2nd Missouri Volunteer Infantry and publisher of the Anzeiger des Westens, a German-language newspaper in St. Louis, remarked in his memoirs that he gave several of his men leave to visit their families on the morning of May 11 and that \\"Most of them did not return... until it grew dark, with clothing torn, faces beaten bloody, and all the signs of having suffered mistreatment... Two of them never returned and they were never heard of again.\\" Rumors spread throughout the city that the Germans were planning to murder the American population of the city; many wealthy St. Louisans fled to Illinois or the Missouri interior. Martial law was imposed, and with the arrival of federal regulars to relieve the German volunteers, the violence came to an end. Aftermath Monument to Nathaniel Lyon with the arsenal in the background Governor Jackson had previously proposed a \\"Military Bill\\" which would put the state on a war footing, create a new state military force, and grant the Governor broad executive powers. The bill had stalled at first, but on May 11, the day after the Camp Jackson affair, it was passed by the Missouri General Assembly, creating the Missouri State Guard with Major General Sterling Price as its commander. Unionists described the bill as a \\"secession act in all but name\\". Critics also observed that since it stated that all adult men were to be considered reserves of the State Guard, and granted the Governor wide powers as commander of the Guard, it had the effect of making Governor Jackson dictator of the state. William S. Harney was reinstated as Commander of the Western District and met with Price on May 21. They signed the Price‚ÄìHarney Truce, which left the federal military in charge of St. Louis and allowed Price's state militia to maintain order in the rest of the state. Many Missouri Unionists considered the agreement a capitulation to Jackson and the secessionists and lobbied President Abraham Lincoln for Harney's removal from command. Unionists outside of St. Louis reported harassment by secessionists, despite Harney's implicit understanding that the Missouri State Guard would protect them, and many fled to St. Louis for refuge. Frank Blair was a well- known Republican leader and former U.S. Representative from St. Louis, as well as a recently promoted colonel. Lincoln authorized him to relieve Harney at his discretion. On May 30, Blair relieved Harney and permanently replaced him with Lyon. Lyon was promoted to Brigadier General and assigned command of all Union forces in Missouri. On June 11, Lyon met face-to-face with Jackson, Price and their aides at the Planter's House hotel in St. Louis. They argued for four hours (much of it over Jackson's powers under the \\"Military Bill\\") before Lyon abruptly ended the meeting, declaring \\"Rather than concede to the State of Missouri for one single instant the right to dictate to my government in any matter however important, I would see you, and you, and you, and you, and every man, woman, and child in the State, dead and buried! This means war. In an hour one of my officers will call on you and conduct you out of my lines.\\"Albert Castel, General Sterling Price and the Civil War in the West, p.24 Jackson returned to the state capital at Jefferson City. Lyon delivered federal troops by steamboat to Jefferson City on June 12, and Jackson fled west to join newly assembled State Guard troops near Boonville. Lyon's men occupied the capital without resistance, and pursued Jackson with approximately 1,400 volunteers and U.S. Army regulars. Against the advice of his senior officers, Jackson exercised his authority as Commander-in-Chief and ordered the State Guard to make a stand at Boonville. In the resulting Battle of Boonville on June 17, Lyon's troops routed the State Guard. Jackson, the State Guard, and a few secessionist state legislators escaped to southwest Missouri, near the Arkansas border, leaving most of the state under federal control. The Constitutional Convention reconvened on July 22 and declared the office of Governor vacant due to Jackson's absence. The Convention then voted to appoint former Chief Justice of the Missouri Supreme Court and conservative Unionist Hamilton Rowan Gamble as Governor of the Provisional Government of Missouri. Gamble's government was recognized by the Lincoln administration. Nativism, mistrust of the federal government, fears for and of slavery, and states' rights issues all played roles in provoking the Camp Jackson affair. The incident immediately polarized the state between Union and Confederate supporters. Where previously most Missourians had advocated neutrality, many were now forced to take sides. Some Missourians had attempted to find compromise as \\"Conditional Unionists\\", who opposed secession but with conditions: that slavery not be interfered with, and that no \\"coercion\\" or military force be used against the seceding states of the Confederacy. After the Camp Jackson affair, many of these \\"Conditional Unionists\\" became full Confederate supporters, such as former Governor Sterling Price.

From 1868 to 1881 Madeira had used overprinted stamps of Portugal.Gibbons, \\"Portuguese Colonies\\"  History  Beginning in 1868, postage stamps for Madeira were issued for the postal needs of the island group with its capital Funchal. Unoverprinted Portuguese stamps were used from 1881 to 1892. From 1892 to 1905, while the administrative title of Madeira was changed to the District of Funchal, definitive stamps were issued with the inscription \\"Funchal\\". These were valid all over the island.

Issues  The first series of eight stamps inscribed \\"Funchal\\" was produced in 1892. The typographed stamps, engraved by Manuel Diogo Neto, had face values ranging from 5 reis to 80 reis. Four more stamps with higher face values from 100 reis to 300 reis were issued in the following year, as well as a 5 reis stamp. In 1896 the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected in order to frank newspaper wrappers and letters. 1897 stamps for Funchal A new series of stamps, engraved by Louis-Eug√®ne Mouchon, was issued in 1897 and supplemented by additional values in 1898, 1899 and 1905. It comprised 19 nominals ranging from 2¬Ω reis to 500 reis. Again, the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected for use on letters. These stamps were of the general single-colour design for Portuguese stamps at the time, but with the name \\"Funchal\\" and the value figure printed in black (on two values, in red). The 25 reis value was issued in 1899 in booklets containing six stamps each. Not counting perforation varieties, bisects, and booklets, 34 different stamps were issued for Funchal, all of them showing the portrait of King Carlos I.

James Longstreet's Tidewater operations during the American Civil War. Lt. Gen. Longstreet took charge of the Department of Virginia and North Carolina on February 25 and initiated his Tidewater Operations. He directed Maj. Gen. D.H.

Born in Liverpool, Storm was the singer and leader of Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, a Liverpudlian band who were contemporaries of the Beatles in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Ringo Starr was the drummer for the Hurricanes before joining the Beatles in August 1962, replacing original drummer Pete Best. The Hurricanes were one of the most popular acts on the Liverpool and Hamburg club scenes during their existence, although their attempt at a recording career was not successful. They released only two singles (and one additional compilation track) during their early 1960s heyday, and none of their material made the charts. Their second and final single was a version of the West Side Story song \\"America\\", and was produced by the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein.  Early years  Rory Storm was the stage name of Alan Caldwell, born 7 January 1938, in Oakhill Park Estate, Stoneycroft, Liverpool to Violet (n√©e Disley) and Ernest \\"Ernie\\" George W Caldwell. His father was a window cleaner by profession, and a part- time porter at the Broadgreen Hospital, often singing songs to patients. Storm had one sister, Iris Caldwell, who dated George Harrison when she was 12, and Paul McCartney, when she was 17. Iris later married Shane Fenton, later known as Alvin Stardust. Apart from music, Storm was interested in sports, particularly athletics; he ran for an amateur team in Liverpool called the Pembroke Harriers, and set the Pembroke Athletics and Cycle Club steeplechase record. Instead of being driven home after concerts in Liverpool, Storm preferred to run home. Storm played football regularly and was a good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood and he went to watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it could take a long time. He became a cotton salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.  Music  Storm's first name for a group was \\"Dracula & the Werewolves\\", but he then settled on \\"Al Caldwell's Texans\\". Still known as Alan Caldwell, Storm opened the Morgue Skiffle Club in the cellar of a large Victorian house, \\"Balgownie\\", at 25 Oakhill Park, Broadgreen, on 13 March 1958. The cellar consisted of two rooms, painted black and connected by a long corridor, with skeletons painted on the walls and one blue light. Groups played on Tuesdays and Thursdays for up to 100 people (above the age of 15) starting at 7:30 pm, including Storm's group (later called \\"The Raving Texans\\") and the Quarrymen (who later became \\"the Beatles\\"). After complaints about the noise, the police closed down the club on 1 April 1958, but Storm reopened it on 22 April 1958. It was in the Morgue Skiffle Club that George Harrison auditioned for the Quarrymen, playing \\"Guitar Boogie Shuffle\\" by Bert Weedon, before being admitted as a member of the band. Paul McCartney has stated that George Harrison auditioned for John Lennon on the top of a bus by playing \\"Raunchy\\". Harrison later asked Storm if he could join his group, but Storm's mother refused to allow it, as she thought Harrison was too young. Storm went to London, on 11 April 1958, to participate in a cross-country running competition. During his stay, he took part in a jam session at Chas McDevitt's Skiffle Cellar, which resulted in an appearance on 30 April 1958 on Radio Luxembourg's Skiffle club programme, playing \\"Midnight Special\\". In 1959, Storm's group consisted of himself, Paul Murphy, and Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Byrne all performing on guitar and vocals, Reg Hale (washboard) and Jeff Truman (tea-chest bass). \\"Spud\\" Ward, a former member of the Swinging Blue Jeans, later played bass guitar. Storm met Ringo Starr at a talent contest called \\"6.5 Special\\". Starr had previously played with the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group and was then drumming with a group called \\"Darktown Skiffle\\". Starr's first concert with Storm was on 25 March 1959, at the Mardi Gras in Mount Pleasant, Liverpool.  Rory Storm and the Hurricanes  Storm changed the name of his group to \\"Al Storm and the Hurricanes\\", then \\"Jett Storm and the Hurricanes\\", and finally to \\"Rory Storm and the Hurricanes\\". The original lineup was Storm, Byrne, Ty Brian,Born Charles O'Brien 1941, died 1967 Lu Walters,Born Walter Eymond, 1938 and Ritchie Starkey (drums). Storm and the Hurricanes entered a competition managed by Carrol Levis called \\"Search for Stars\\" at the Liverpool Empire Theatre on 11 October 1959, reaching second place ahead of 150 acts. The line-up of the Hurricanes finally solidified with Storm (vocals), Byrne (rhythm guitar), Ty (Charles) O‚ÄôBrien (lead guitar), Walters (bass guitar/vocals) and Ringo Starr. The group played at the Cavern Club with the Cy Laurie Jazz Band on Sunday 2 January 1960, and a week later supported the Saints Jazz Band and Terry Lightfoot's New Orleans Jazz Band. Playing rock 'n' roll music was a problem at the Cavern Club, as it was not accepted by the customers or management. When Storm and the Hurricanes performed there on 17 January 1960, with Micky Ashman's Jazz Band and the Swinging Blue Jeans, their first song was \\"Cumberland Gap\\" (a skiffle song) by Lonnie Donegan. Then they played \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On\\" by Jerry Lee Lewis. The jazz and skiffle audience were outraged, booed and threw copper coins at the group. The Cavern's manager Ray McFall, fined them six shillings, but the coins collected from the stage floor were worth more than the fine. Storm and the Hurricanes performed at the Liverpool Stadium on 3 May 1960, on the same bill as Gene Vincent. Larry Parnes became interested in the Hurricanes, and invited them to audition at the Wyvern Club as a backing group for Billy Fury. Storm turned up at the audition, but only so he could have his picture taken with Fury. In July 1960, the group secured a residency at Butlins holiday camp in Pwllheli (playing in the Rock 'n' Calypso Ballroom) for ¬£25 each per week (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Starr was not sure about giving up his job as an apprentice at Henry Hunt's, where he made climbing frames for schools, until Storm put forward the idea of \\"Starr-time\\" (a solo spot) with Starr singing songs like \\"Boys\\" by the Shirelles.‚ÄùThe Beatles Anthology‚Äù DVD 1&2 2003 (Episode 1 ‚Äì 0:31:06) Lennon talking about Starr's 'Starr-Time' and being a professional drummer. Starr finally agreed when Storm told him about how many women would be \\"available\\". It was during this season that Starr (who had been known as \\"Ritchie\\" until then) changed his name to \\"Ringo\\".  Hamburg  After playing for more than 16 hours per week, the group were contacted by Allan Williams, who wanted them to go to Hamburg. Derry and the Seniors were successful there, and Williams wanted an additional group. As Storm and the group were committed to Butlins, they turned Williams' offer down (as did Gerry and the Pacemakers) so Williams sent the Beatles to Hamburg instead. After the summer season ended in early October 1960, Storm and the Hurricanes were free to travel to Hamburg, replacing Derry and the Seniors at the Kaiserkeller. They arrived in Hamburg on 1 October 1960, having negotiated to be paid more than the Seniors or the Beatles. They played five or six 90-minute sets every day alternating with The Beatles. Storm and The Hurricanes were later presented with a special certificate by Bruno Koschmider (the owner of the Kaiserkeller) for their performances. The stage of the Kaiserkeller was made of planks of wood balanced on the top of beer crates, so the two groups made a bet to see to who would be the first to break it. After punishing the stage for days, a slight crack appeared, and when Storm jumped off the top of the upright piano, during a performance of \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\", it finally broke. Byrne remembered that as Storm hit the stage, it cracked loudly and formed a V-shape around Storm. He disappeared into it, and all the amplifiers and Starr's cymbals slid into the hole. Koschmider was furious, and had to replace the live music with a juke box. Both groups went across the road to Harold's cafe for breakfast, but were followed by Koschmider's doormen with coshes, who beat the musicians as punishment. During their eight-week residency Williams arranged a recording session at the Akoustik Studio, which was a small booth on the fifth floor of 57 Kirchenallee (the Klockmann-House) on Saturday 18 October 1960. Williams asked John Lennon, Paul McCartney and Harrison from the Beatles to play and sing harmonies for Walters (of the Hurricanes) on the recording. Pete Best (the Beatles' regular drummer at the time) was in town buying drumsticks, so Starr played drums, which was the first time that the classic Beatles line-up of Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr recorded together.Lou Walters' recording session Retrieved: 29 January 2007 They recorded three songs: \\"Fever\\", \\"September Song\\" and \\"Summertime\\". However, the fate of the recordings is uncertain and they have not been discovered to this day.  Liverpool  Storm and the Hurricanes were the headlining group at the first \\"Beat Night\\", in the Orrell Park Ballroom, in March 1961. They were also invited for a season at the Butlins camp in Skegness in Lincolnshire. Sam Leach (a Liverpool promoter) arranged a series of dance nights at the Palais Ballroom in Aldershot, starting on 9 December 1961. The first Saturday featured The Beatles, but as the local newspaper forgot to run the advertisement only 18 people turned up. The second Saturday was arranged for Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to perform, and as it was advertised this time, 210 people paid to get in. Leach's idea was to attract London agents to watch the series of concerts, but when he realized they would never travel out of London he abandoned the idea. Starr considered leaving Storm at that time to join Derry and the Seniors, but accepted a job with Tony Sheridan at the Top Ten Club on 30 December 1961, as Sheridan's offer of more money, a flat and a car was too good to refuse. Starr's stay with Sheridan was short-lived, as he found Sheridan's habit of changing the set list without telling his backing group beforehand frustrating, so he rejoined the Hurricanes. On 5 February 1962, Best fell ill and the Beatles had to play a lunchtime concert at the Cavern and an evening concert at the Kingsway club in Southport. As the Hurricanes had no concert that day Starr played with them live on stage for the first time (although he had recorded with them in Hamburg). During a Hurricanes' residency at Butlins, Lennon and McCartney drove from Liverpool to Skegness, on 15 August 1962, to ask Starr to join the Beatles. Shortly before, Starr had agreed to join Kingsize Taylor in Hamburg, as Taylor was offering ¬£20 a week (equivalent to ¬£ in ), but Lennon and McCartney offered ¬£25 a week (equivalent to ¬£ in ), which Starr accepted. Lennon and McCartney offered Storm to swap drummers (with Best replacing Starr) but Best rejected the idea. According to Epstein in his autobiography, Storm was, \\"One of the liveliest and most likable young men on the scene ... was very annoyed when Ringo left and he complained to me. I apologized, and Rory, with immense good humor said, 'Okay. Forget it. The best of luck to the lot of you'\\". The Hurricanes then became known for having a succession of drummers, including Gibson Kemp, Brian Johnson, Keef Hartley (August 1963), Ian Broad and Trevor Morais, who all stayed with the group for a short period before leaving. Despite Starr joining the Beatles, both groups would perform on the same bill during 1962, and at many concerts thereafter. In 1962, both groups performed together at St Patrick's Night Rock Gala (Knotty Ash Village Hall) Queen's Hall (Widnes) and with Little Richard at the Tower Ballroom. In 1963, Storm and the Hurricanes were filmed as part of the \\"Beat City\\" documentary, which was broadcast by Associated-Rediffusion Television.  Stage persona and lifestyle  When Storm became a professional singer, he changed his name to Rory Storm by deed poll, and changed the name of his family's home in Broadgreen to Hurricaneville (the house name has often been remembered as Stormsville, even by his sister Iris, but was registered with the Post Office as Hurricaneville and appeared that way in the phone directory). Storm was known for the extravagant clothes he wore and the cars he drove, once buying a pink Vauxhall Cresta for ¬£800 in cash. A young man was once caught by a porter at Bootle railway station writing \\"I love Rory\\" over the walls, and when questioned, it turned out to be Storm himself. The Hurricanes wore matching suits on stage, but Storm sometimes wore a pink suit and pink tie, and during concerts he would walk over to the piano and comb his blond hair with an oversized comb. Their stage wear changed from sunglasses and palm tree-decorated shirts to red (and blue) suits. Storm also wore an Elvis-style gold lam√© suit. When they first appeared at Butlins holiday camp Storm wore a turquoise suit with a gold lam√© shirt, while the group wore fluorescent suits. Rod Pont (also known as Steve Day in Steve Day and the Drifters) remembered Storm arriving at the Orrell Park Ballroom for a concert with a boil on his face. When told about it, Storm pulled out a black velvet hood which had slits for his eyes and mouth, and played the whole concert with the hood on. At one concert at Bankfield House Youth club, Garston, Liverpool, in 1965, the stage lighting failed between sets. Storm was upset until someone walked in with a torch, which Storm used to finish the concert. He occasionally used a pet monkey in some of the group's performances, as it attracted more people. At a New Brighton swimming baths performance for 1,600 people in 1963, Storm climbed to the top diving board, undressed to a pair of swimming trunks, and then dived into the water at the end of a song. In January 1964, during a performance at the Majestic Ballroom, Birkenhead, he climbed up one of the columns supporting the balcony, but slipped and fell to the floor below, fracturing his leg. At another performance on the New Brighton Pier, Storm made his way onto the Pavilion roof but fell through the glass skylight. Storm and the Hurricanes received the most votes in the first Mersey Beat magazine poll, but many votes were disqualified as they had been posted from the same place at the same time and were written in green ink; although never proven, it was thought that Storm had posted the votes. This meant that the Beatles reached the top position, with the Hurricanes coming fourth, even though the Beatles had also been sending in extra votes themselves. Storm was often photographed for the magazine, such as being surrounded by nurses when he left the hospital after breaking a leg during a performance, or playing for the Mersey Beat XI football team.  The Hurricanes' set list  The group's typical 40-minute set list during 1963/1964: * \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Vince Taylor & the Playboys); * \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Chuck Berry); * \\"I'll Be Your Hero\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Taylor & the Playboys); * \\"Beautiful Dreamer\\" ‚Äì Walters, vocals (Stephen Foster song as rewritten by Gerry Goffin and Jack Keller and released by Tony Orlando in January 1963); * \\"Since You Broke My Heart\\" ‚Äì Walters/Byrne, vocals (The Everly Brothers); * \\"America\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Leonard Bernstein); * \\"Danny\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Marty Wilde); * \\"Green Onions\\" (instrumental) (Booker T & the MG's); * \\"Down The Line\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Jerry Lee Lewis); and * \\"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin On\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Jerry Lee Lewis). Other songs included in the set were: * \\"Fever\\" ‚Äì Walters, vocals (written by Eddie Cooley and John Davenport‚Äîa pseudonym for Otis Blackwell); * \\"Let It Be Me\\" ‚Äì Walters, vocals (Everly Brothers cover); * \\"Summertime\\" ‚Äì Walters, vocals (George Gershwin); and * \\"Dr Feelgood\\" ‚Äì Storm, vocals (Dr. Feelgood & The Interns cover) The Hurricanes recorded songs for Oriole's two This is Mersey Beat albums, but only released two singles: \\"Dr Feelgood\\"/\\"I Can Tell\\", Oriole (45-CB 1858 12/63) and \\"America\\"/\\"Since You Broke My Heart\\", Parlophone (R 5197 11/64) which was produced by Epstein at IBC Studios in London. Epstein also sang backing vocals on \\"America\\", and Starr added percussion and sang. Storm later asked Epstein to manage the group, but Epstein refused. The Hurricanes later recorded two songs at Abbey Road Studios in 1964: \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" and \\"I'll Be There\\", although they were never released.  Later life and death  In 1967, at the age of 29, O'Brien collapsed on stage during a performance, and years later would die due to complications after an appendicitis operation. Storm disbanded the Hurricanes and became a disc jockey, working at the Silver Blades Ice Rink in Liverpool, in Benidorm (he was also a water-skiing instructor there) in Jersey and Amsterdam. When Storm's father died, he returned from Amsterdam to Liverpool to be with his mother. He developed a chest infection and could not sleep properly, so he took sleeping pills. On 28 September 1972, Storm and his mother were both found dead, at Hurricaneville. The post mortem revealed that Storm had alcohol and sleeping pills in his blood (as had his mother) but not enough to cause his death, which was ruled accidental. Although it could not be proven, it is thought that his mother had committed suicide after finding Storm's body. The funeral for Storm and his mother was at Oakvale Congregational Church, Broadgreen, on 19 October 1972. Mourners sang Storm's favourite song, \\"You'll Never Walk Alone\\". The two coffins were carried from the hearse to the cremation (at Anfield Crematorium) by former band members. Storm's remains were scattered on section 23 at Anfield Crematorium's Gardens of Remembrance. When Starr was asked why he did not attend, he said, \\"I wasn't there when he was born either.\\" Although Starr had often offered to arrange for Storm to record whenever he wanted to, Storm was not interested in finding new or original material. His sister said: \\"He [Storm] was happy to be the King of Liverpool‚Äîhe was never keen on touring, he didn't want to give up running for the Pembroke Harriers ... and he'd never miss a Liverpool football match!\\" Billy Fury, who Storm had met at the Wyvern Club auditions, later played the part of a fictional singer called Stormy Tempest (based on Storm), in the film That'll Be the Day (1973), which also starred Starr. In 1987, a musical was staged in Liverpool about Storm and the Hurricanes called A Need For Heroes. After spending several years in the Merseyside Ambulance Service, Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Byrne died in Liverpool on 18 August 1999. Legacy Ringo Starr pays tribute to him in his songs \\"Liverpool 8\\" on his Liverpool 8 album and \\"Rory and the Hurricanes\\" on his Postcards from Paradise album. Posthumous release In September 2012 it was reported that a reel-to-reel tape of a complete concert by Rory Storm and the Hurricanes, from March 5, 1960 at Liverpool's \\"Jive Hive\\", had been unearthed in the basement of his sister Iris Caldwell. The recording was released on CD as Rory Storm And The Hurricanes Live At The Jive Hive - March 1960. The concert had been professionally recorded in mono by radio engineers with a recording mike added onto Rory Storm's concert mike stand, but only one mike for the entire band. The diary of Storm's guitarist Johnny Guitar reveals that in the week of the recording Ringo Starr was ill, and historian Mark Lewisohn has stated that the drumming on the recording is nothing like Starr's. Four home demos were also included on the CD release.

Kretek are unfiltered cigarettes of Indonesian origin, made with a blend of tobacco, cloves and other flavors. The word \\"kretek\\" itself is an onomatopoetic term for the crackling sound of burning cloves. Partly due to favorable taxation compared to filtered \\"white\\" cigarettes, kreteks are by far the most widely smoked form of cigarettes in Indonesia, where they are preferred by about 90% of smokers. In Indonesia, there are hundreds of kretek manufacturers, including small local makers and major brands. Most of the widely known international brands, including Dji Sam Soe, Bentoel, Minak Djinggo, Djarum, Gudang Garam, and Wismilak originate from Indonesia. Nat Sherman of the United States produces cigarettes branded as \\"A Touch of Clove\\" but they are not true kreteks since there is clove flavoring infused into small crystals located inside the filter, rather than actual clove spice mixed with the tobacco.  History  Tobacco leaves sorting in Java. Tobacco was introduced by the Dutch during the colonial period. The origin of kretek cigarettes can be traced to 1880. The creator of kretek was Haji Djamhari, a native of Kudus in Indonesia's Central Java region. Suffering from chest pains, Djamhari attempted to reduce the pain by rubbing clove oil on his chest. Djamhari sought a means of achieving a deeper relief and smoked his hand-rolled cigarettes after adding dried clove buds and rubber tree sap. According to the story, his asthma and chest pains healed immediately. Word of Djamhari's product spread rapidly among his neighbors, and the product soon became available in pharmacies as rokok cengkeh; clove cigarettes. First marketed as a medicinal product, kreteks became widely popular. In those years, the locals used to hand-roll kreteks to sell on order without any specific brand, packing, or limits on ingredients used in production. A resident of Kudus named Nitisemito had the idea of starting serial production and selling kreteks under a proprietary brand name. Unlike other manufacturers, Nitisemito, who first created the Bal Tiga brand in 1906, enjoyed great success by implementing unprecedented marketing techniques, such as using embossed packs or offering free-of-charge promotional materials. Commercial manufacture did not start in earnest until the 1930s. Kreteks from the 1910s, containing resin, nutmeg, cumin, clove, and tobacco wrapped in banana leaves. Furthermore, he also developed a means of production called the abon system which offered opportunities for other entrepreneurs with insufficient capital. In this system, a person called an \\"abon\\" assumes the job of delivering finished products to the company which pays the price of piecework done whereas the company is liable to supply the necessary production materials to the \\"abons\\". Most manufacturers have since opted to have their workers working under the roof of their own factories, to maintain quality standards. Nowadays, only a few kretek manufacturers make use of the abon system. During the period from 1960 until 1970 and the earlier days of the New Order regime, kreteks became a national symbol against \\"white cigarettes\\". In the mid-1980s, the number of machine-produced cigarettes exceeded that of hand-rolled ones. One of the largest income sources of Indonesia, the kretek industry comprises 500 large and small manufacturers employing a total of around 10 million people.Hanusz, Mark (2000) Kretek: The Culture and Heritage of Indonesia's Clove Cigarettes, Equinox Publishing Since 2009, kreteks are not legal for sale in the United States. A variation of the kretek is sold: \\"cigars\\" that are similar in size and shape to the original kreteks, also with a filter and the original tobacco/clove blend, but in a tobacco-based paper. Structure and ingredients The quality and variety of tobacco play an important role in kretek production. One kretek brand can contain more than 30 types of tobacco. Minced dried clove buds weighing about 1/3 of the tobacco blend are added. Sometimes, the last process which machine-made or hand-rolled kreteks go through is the spraying of sweetener at the butt end of the cigarette. Health effects Djarum Black cigarettes sold in Europe, South Africa and South American countries have 10-12 mg tar and 1 mg nicotine, as indicated on the pack. This level of tar and nicotine is comparable to the majority of other regular or \\"full-flavor\\" cigarettes available. Djarum Black cigarettes produced for consumption in Indonesia contain a significantly higher quantity of tar and nicotine, 25 mg and 1.6 mg respectively. In Canada, Djarum Black cigarettes are listed as containing 44.2-86 mg of tar and 1.73-3.24 mg of nicotine, a significant amount more than most other cigarettes. The venous plasma nicotine and carbon monoxide levels from 10 smokers were tested after smoking kreteks and were found to be similar to non-clove brands of cigarettes, such as Marlboro. Rats were given equal inhalation doses of conventional tobacco cigarettes and kreteks over a short period. Those that had inhaled kreteks did not appear to show worse health effects compared to those that had inhaled conventional cigarettes. The study was repeated with a 14-day exposure and kreteks again did not produce worse health effects than conventional cigarettes. The eugenol in clove smoke causes a numbing of the throat which can diminish the gag reflex in users, leading researchers to recommend caution for individuals with respiratory infections. There have also been a few cases of aspiration pneumonia in individuals with normal respiratory tracts possibly because of the diminished gag reflex. Legal status in the United States In the United States, cigarettes were the subject of legal restrictions and political debate, including a proposed 2009 US Senate bill that would have prohibited cigarettes from having a \\"characterizing flavor\\" of certain ingredients other than tobacco and menthol. A study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control found kreteks account for a relatively small percentage of underage smoking, and their use was declining among high school students. Critics of the bill argued that support of the bill by the large U.S. tobacco maker Philip Morris, which makes only conventional and menthol cigarettes, indicated that the bill was an attempt to protect the company from competition. Some U.S. states, including Utah, New Mexico, and Maryland, passed laws that prohibit the sale of kreteks. On 14 March 2005, Philip Morris International announced the purchase of Indonesian tobacco company PT HM Sampoerna after acquiring a 40% stake in Sampoerna from a number of Sampoerna's principal shareholders. In 2009, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act was introduced in the US Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama, giving the FDA significantly more regulatory power over tobacco; one of the provisions in the law includes a ban on the use of flavors in tobacco, other than menthol. The ban includes kreteks. As of September 22, 2009, the clove cigarette was no longer legal to sell or distribute in the US, and cigarettes purchased overseas are subject to seizure by U.S. Customs. There is an exception to this rule when receiving cigarettes as gifts through the USPS and is only allowed if certain guidelines are followed. This rule does not allow for purchase of tobacco products overseas but allows the receipt of gifts from domestic individuals and international individuals. However, Kretek International Inc., importer of the Djarum brand, continued to offer the clove and tobacco products as little cigars, which have lower taxes (in some U.S. states) and looser restrictions than cigarettes. On April 12, 2010 Indonesia filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization stating the ban on kreteks in America amounts to discrimination because menthol cigarettes are exempt from the new regulation. Trade Ministry Director General of International Trade Gusmardi Bustami has stated that the Indonesian government has asked the WTO panel to review US violations on trade regulations, including the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994, Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) Agreement. The TBT Agreement is of special importance as it defines clove cigarettes and menthol cigarettes as \\"like products\\". Claims of discrimination are enhanced when noting that 99% of kreteks were imported from countries other than the United States (chiefly Indonesia), while menthol cigarettes are produced almost entirely by American tobacco manufacturers. Indonesia's case is further strengthened by comparing the number of young kretek smokers in America with the number of young menthol cigarette smokers. According to US health reports, 43% of young smokers smoke menthol cigarettes, which accounts for nearly 25% of the total cigarette consumption in the United States. Young smokers habituated to kreteks, however, account for less than 1% of cigarette consumption in the US, and <1% of the total cigarettes sold in the US. On April 4, 2012, the WTO ruled in favor of Indonesia's claim, though it is unclear how this will affect U.S. law.  International sales  Kretek cigarettes are among others sold in Germany, France, Australia, Brazil etc. In Europe only smaller packs and thinner cigarettes are sold to adhere to the EU established maximum amount of nicotine and tar levels. In South Africa they are also sold in smaller packs of 10 with between 10‚Äì12 mg tar, and 1-1.2 mg nicotine. Indonesia is the world's largest producer of clove cigarettes, and exports up to US$500 million of the product a year.

Gen. James Longstreet's Tidewater operations during the American Civil War. This battle is sometimes referred to as the Siege of Little Washington.Dyer's Compendium 43rd & 44th Massachusetts both took part in relief of \\"Little Washington\\" Background After the culmination of Burnside's North Carolina Expedition little attention had been given to North Carolina by the Confederate Army. In December 1862 a Union expedition from New Bern destroyed the railroad bridge at Goldsboro, N.C. along the vital Wilmington and Weldon Railroad. This expedition caused only temporary damage to the railroad, but did prompt Confederate authorities to devote more attention to the situation along the coast of Virginia and North Carolina.Chaitin p.85-86 Following the Confederate victory at Fredericksburg, General Robert E. Lee felt confident enough to dispatch a large portion of his army to deal with Union occupation forces along the coast. The whole force was put under the command of Lt. Gen. James Longstreet. While Longstreet personally operated against Suffolk, Maj. Gen. D. H. Hill led a column which moved against Federal garrisons at New Bern and Washington, North Carolina. Maj. Gen. John G. Foster, commanding the Department of North Carolina, was responsible for the overall defense of the Union garrisons along the North Carolina coast. After Hill's attack against New Bern failed, Foster arrived in Washington to take personal command of the garrison. Siege Map of Washington Battlefield core and study areas by the American Battlefield Protection Program. Foster, a West Point trained Army engineer, put his skills to good use improving the town's defenses as well as employing the use of three gunboats in the defense. By March 30, the town was ringed with fortifications, and Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade began the investment of Washington. Meanwhile, Hill established batteries as well as river obstructions along the Tar River to impede reinforcements. He also posted two brigades south of Washington to guard for any relief efforts coming overland from New Bern.Kennedy p.195 The Confederates sent a reply to Foster demanding surrender. Foster replied saying \\"If the Confederates want Washington, come and get it.\\" Despite this defiance, Foster lacked the strength to dislodge the besiegers, and Hill was under orders to avoid an assault at the risk of sustaining heavy casualties. Thus, the engagement devolved into one of artillery, and even so the Confederates limited their bombings to conserve their ammunition. In time both sides were running low on supplies, and conditions grew miserable in the rain and mud. Despite the lack of progress against Washington, Hill was accomplishing a vital objective in the form of foraging parties so long as the Federals were pinned down. Relief Efforts A Federal relief column under Brig. Gen. Henry Prince sailed up the Tar River. Once Prince saw the Rebel batteries, he simply turned the transports around. A second effort under Brig. Gen. Francis Barretto Spinola moved overland from New Bern. Spinola was defeated along Blount's Creek and returned to New Bern. Foster decided that he would escape Washington and personally lead the relief effort leaving his chief-of-staff, Brig. Gen. Edward E. Potter in command at Washington. On April 13, the USS Escort braved the Confederate batteries and made its way into Washington. The Escort delivered supplies and reinforcements in the form of a Rhode Island regiment. It was aboard this ship on April 15 that Foster made his escape. The ship was badly damaged and the pilot mortally wounded, but Foster made it out. Raising the Siege About the same time Foster made an escape, Hill was faced with numerous reasons that ultimately led to his withdrawal: the completion of his foraging efforts, Union supplies reaching the Federal garrison, and finally a message arrived from Longstreet requesting reinforcements for an assault on Suffolk. Hill broke off the siege on April 15 and began to withdraw Garnett's brigade fronting Washington's defenses.Foster's Official Report Meanwhile, Foster had made it back to New Bern and immediately began organizing a relief effort. He ordered General Prince to march along the railroad towards Kinston to hold off Confederates in the vicinity of Goldsboro, while Foster personally led a second column north from New Bern towards Blount's Creek where General Spinola had earlier been turned back. On April 18, Foster ordered Spinola to drive the Confederates from their road block at Swift Creek guarding the direct road from Washington to New Bern. At the same time, General Henry M. Naglee attacked the Confederate rear guard near Washington capturing several prisoners and a regimental battle flag. On April 19 Foster returned to the Washington defensesFoster's Official Report and by April 20 the Confederates had completely withdrawn from the area. Aftermath Apart from raids conducted by Foster and Potter, North Carolina remained relatively quiet until 1864 when Robert E. Lee was able to spare troops for another operation against Federal control posts on along the coast.

It is jointly owned by United States‚Äìbased food conglomerate General Mills and French dairy cooperative Sodiaal. History In 1964, 100,000 French farmers agreed to merge six regional dairy cooperatives in order to more efficiently market their products at the national level. In 1965, the Yoplait brand was launched as a new national brand, as a portmanteau of the brands of two member cooperatives, Yola and Coplait.

Ultima Foods oversaw Yoplait brand products throughout Canada until 2012, when General Mills took over the licence (Ultima Foods continues to manufacture Yoplait products in Canada as a subcontractor, but has also launched a wholly owned rival product line, i√∂go).  Chile  In Chile the Yoplait brand is managed by Quillayes. =Ireland= In Ireland, Glanbia controlled the Yoplait brand from 1973 until May 2012, when the control was let go to Yoplait. =Norway= The franchise in Norway is held by Fjordland. =Portugal= In Portugal, Until 2010, Yoplait was run under Gelgurte, when the franchising was no renewed with headquarters. It was not made and sold ever since. = Spain = In 2001 Soldier Spanish brand from Social stopped its production and commercialization in Spain closing its Anacondas production plant. =United Kingdom= In the United Kingdom, Yoplait UK Ltd is now 100% owned by Yoplait France. In April 2009 the joint venture between Yoplait and Dairy Crest ended. Yoplait UK Ltd is based in General Mills' European head office; Harman House in Uxbridge, London, United Kingdom. Tubed yogurts are called Frubes (portmanteau of fruit and tube) in the UK, half under the Petits Filous branding and half under the Wildlife Choobs branding. Petits Filous yogurt pots, Wildlife yogurt pots, Cal-in+ pot yogurts and yogurt drinks and Yop drinking yogurt are also sold in the UK. Israel Yoplait in Israel is managed by Tnuva, Israel's largest dairy,Tnuva Launches Yoplait Yoghurts and products are kosher. The company's drinkable yogurt comes in a 100-gram shot- style bottle with a center opening for easy gripping. Yoplait-brand flavored yogurts account for 42‚Äì52% of the Israeli market. Tnuva and Yoplait entered into a partnership to set up production facilities in Romania in 2007. In 2009, Tnuva introduced a 500-gram family-size yogurt called Yoplait YYY that comes in resealable containers. Mexico In Mexico, the Yoplait brand is managed by Sigma Alimentos. South Korea In South Korea, the Yoplait brand is managed and manufactured by Binggrae. United States The Yoplait brand first entered the United States in 1974 when it was licensed by the Michigan Cottage Cheese Company. In 1977, General Mills acquired the U.S. marketing rights to Yoplait from that company, along with a yogurt plant in Reed City, Michigan. General Mills has been the exclusive franchisee of the Yoplait brand in the United States ever since. General Mills opened a plant in Carson, California to manufacture Yoplait for the West Coast, where it became the best-selling yogurt brand. In 1981, General Mills began selling Yoplait on the East Coast. Yoplait products are available in a variety of fruit-based flavors that come in a truncated-conical container sealed with an aluminum foil top. Under the Yoplait label, General Mills also markets Trix Yogurt, based on the flavors of their breakfast cereal of the same name, and Go-Gurt, where various flavors are packaged in plastic tubes for spoonless eating; these brands are targeted to children. A probiotic line of yogurt is marketed under the brand name Yo-Plus. During the 2000s and 2010s, Yoplait steadily lost market share in the United States to Greek yogurt brands, especially Chobani. General Mills' attempts to market Greek yogurt versions of Yoplait repeatedly failed. General Mills executives carefully studied these failures, concluded that what attracted consumers to Chobani was the charming authenticity of its rags-to-riches backstory, and decided to embrace the authenticity of the Yoplait brand's French heritage. General Mills launched the Oui by Yoplait brand on July 10, 2017, by adapting and marketing an existing 20-year-old French product line, Yoplait Saveur d‚ÄôAutrefois, as French-style yogurt. Oui's selling point is that unlike most yogurts which are fermented in bulk and then poured fully formed into separate containers, all the ingredients are poured into separate glass jars and separately fermented in each jar. This \\"pot-set\\" process supposedly stabilizes the yogurt without the need for additional ingredients like cornstarch or gelatin. United Arab Emirates In the United Arab Emirates, the Yoplait brand is managed by Al Ain Food & Beverages P JSC (an Agthia Group Company). Community involvement In the U.S., Yoplait participates in an annual program called \\"Save Lids to Save Lives\\" to raise money for breast cancer research. Yoplait donates ten cents per pink foil lid that is mailed to the company, but they state in fine print on all promotional materials that their donations will be capped at $2,000,000 per year. This money is donated to the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation. Yoplait has been the primary sponsor of Race for the Cure, a marathon held to raise additional research money, since 2001. The American franchise of Yoplait added a rim on the bottom of the yogurt containers to keep animals such as skunks from accidentally getting their heads caught. A label was added to the container stating: \\"Protect Wildlife: Crush Cup Before Disposal.\\" Controversy The 2011 documentary Pink Ribbons, Inc. reported that some products sold under the \\"Save Lids to Save Lives\\" campaign had previously contained milk from cows treated with bovine somatotropin, a growth hormone banned in many nations for its possible link to diseases in humans, until the company agreed to remove it. A 2012 television advertisement for Yoplait prompted criticism from the National Eating Disorders Association due to its portrayal of a woman making difficult food choices. The company announced within a few days of the complaint that they would pull the ad, saying, \\"We aren't sure that everyone saw the ad that way, but if anyone did, that was not our intent and is cause for concern.\\" Since at least 1998, Yoplait has been the target of a campaign by animal advocates, including the Humane Society, to redesign its traditional tapered cup design because small animals can easily get their heads stuck inside and then suffocate or die from dehydration.

Early years Boyett was born in Akron, Ohio, and lived there until the 1940s, when he moved with his family to Los Angeles, California. He won a Shakespeare competition in high school which led to acting jobs in radio. Military service Boyett served in the Navy during World War II and afterward performed on the stage in both New York City and Los Angeles. Television In 1954, Boyett played respected settler Jim Hardwicke in the Death Valley Days episode \\"11,000 Miners Can't Be Wrong\\". It details the competition between Columbia and Sacramento to be the capital of California. When he informs the sheriff (Glenn Strange) that he had killed a man in self-defense, Hardwicke is forced to stand trial. Political influence coerces the jury to find Hardwicke guilty. His lawyer, Ed Barrett (Gordon Barnes), develops a bizarre scheme to free his client from the hangman's noose. Barrett steals from a safe in the local bank a petition with 11,000 signatures of persons who want Columbia to be the capital, rewrites the first page to call for a pardon for Hardwicke, and appeals to the governor, who is impressed that so many signed. The governor orders Hardwicke's release, but Columbia loses out to Sacramento. Boyett was often cast as a law-enforcement officer, most notably as Broderick Crawford's patrol officer on \\"Highway Patrol,\\" where he appeared in 65 episodes, either as Sgt. Johnson or Sgt. Williams, between 1955-59; Boyett also portrayed a policeman in such diverse series as Gang Busters; The Man Behind the Badge; I Led 3 Lives; M Squad; The Detectives; Sea Hunt; Bat Masterson; Batman; Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.; and Star Trek: The Next Generation Jack Webb, the executive producer of Adam-12 selected Boyett for the role of Sgt. \\"Mac\\" MacDonald after several performances (such as playing Sgt. Sam Hunter) in both iterations of Webb's Dragnet. (Boyett can also be seen uncredited as a bailiff in the 1954 movie version.) Boyett stayed on Adam-12 for its entire 1968‚Äì1975 run. He also made eight guest appearances on CBS's Perry Mason throughout the series' nine-year run, mostly in law-enforcement roles. In 1962, he played slain police officer Otto Norden in \\"The Case of the Hateful Hero\\". The defendant was his rookie partner James Anderson played by Richard Davalos, cousin of series regular Lt. Anderson played by Wesley Lau. He also played a corporate executive, Buck Osborn, in the 1961 episode \\"The Case of the Renegade Refugee\\". In the 1961 My Three Sons episode \\"Fire Watch\\", he was a forest ranger. Boyett appeared in a number of television programs, such as Official Detective,CTVA 'Classic TV Archive-US Crime Series' Navy Log, Laramie, Tales of the Texas Rangers, I Spy, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (uncredited; \\"The Secret Sceptre Affair\\" from 1965), The Andy Griffith Show, Family Affair, Fantasy Island, The Love Boat, The Rockford Files, The A-Team,‚ÄùArchie Bunkers Place‚Äù, Knight Rider, Rescue 8, Ripcord, Murphy Brown and Night Court. He also appeared in numerous episodes of Emergency! as Chief McConnikee of Los Angeles County Fire Department's Battalion 14. Film Boyett also acted in several motion pictures, such as The Hidden (1987) and The Rocketeer (1991). Boyett earned much praise for his highly unusual role in The Hidden as a hospital patient named Jonathan P. Miller, possessed by an alien being with a taste for red Ferraris and rock and roll music. He also appeared in a well-known short public safety film entitled Last Clear Chance (1959) as Patrolman Hal Jackson. Other small roles as a police officer include the crime dramas Vice Squad (1953) with Edward G. Robinson and Shield For Murder (1954) with Edmond O'Brien. Death Boyett died December 29, 2004, in Mission Hills, California, at age 77, of complications from pneumonia and kidney failure.)

He is the founder and president of System Capital Management (SCM), and ranked among the wealthiest men in Ukraine.Eight Ukrainians make Forbes magazine's list of world billionaires, Kyiv Post (2 February 2015) , he was listed as the 272nd richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of US 6.4 billion. Some sources have claimed that Akhmetov has been involved in organized crime, but Akhmetov has never been charged with a crime, his lawyers successfully refuted these accusations. Akhmetov is the owner and president of the Ukrainian football club Shakhtar Donetsk. In 2006‚Äì2007 and 2007‚Äì2012, Akhmetov was a member of the Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada (parliament) for the Party of Regions. Akhmetov also made numerous statements, since March 2014, appealing for integrity of Ukraine and finding peaceful solutions of the crisis. http://www.scmholding.com/en/media-centre/news/view/1514/ http://www.scmholding.com/en/media-centre/news/view/1513/ http://www.scmholding.com/en/media-centre/news/view/1489/ Early life Rinat Akhmetov was born in Donetsk, Ukrainian SSR, to a working-class family.

Akhmetov earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Donetsk National University in 2001. Business career=Beginnings Details regarding Akhmetov's past, how he obtained his wealth after the fall of communism in Ukraine, and the decade between 1985 and 1995 remain controversial. Akhmetov has stated in interviews that he obtained his wealth by making risky business investments in the first years after the collapse of the Soviet Union,–†–∏–Ω–∞—Ç –õ–µ–æ–Ω–∏–¥–æ–≤–∏—á, –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω–æ-–∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä \\"–õ–Ü–ì–ê\\" and responded to allegations in 2010, denying he has ever inherited any money from Akhat Bragin or anyone else: \\"I have earned my first million by trading coal and coke, and spent the money on assets that no one wanted to buy. It was a risk but it was worth it\\". Many publications in Ukraine and other European countries have made claims about Akhmetov's alleged \\"criminal past\\", some of which later retracted their statements. In 2005 Akhmetov hired American lawyers Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, who issued a statement denying that Akhmetov has any ties with the criminal world. Akhmetov and Leonid Kuchma, the second president of independent Ukraine In his documentary book Donetsk Mafia: Anthology, Ukrainian author Serhiy Kuzin claims Akhmetov held the role of a 'mafia thug' in his early years; according to Hans van Zon, Professor of Central and Eastern European Studies in the University of Sunderland, \\"As early as 1986, Rinat and his brother Igor were involved in criminal activities.\\" In the 1980s, Akhmetov acted as an assistant to Akhat Bragin, whom law enforcement agencies regarded as a powerful crime boss; allegedly in the illegal cloth trading business. Andrew Wilson, a scholar specializing in Ukrainian politics, categorized Akhmetov as an alleged former 'enforcer' and 'leader' of \\"[Akhat] Bragin's 'Tatar' clan\\", responsible for the use of \\"mafia methods to push aside the 'red directors' of the [Industrial Union of the Donbass] (IUD)\\". By the early 1990s, Akhmetov began acquiring property in Donetsk allegedly by means of extortion with the assistance of Volodymyr Malyshev, Lieutenant- General of The Head of Ministry of Internal Affairs Department in Donetsk Oblast. Malyshev, now a member of Ukraine's Parliament on the committee controlling law enforcement, is accused by Kuzin of using his position to do away with previously existing police records concerning Akhmetov shortly before becoming chief of security for Akhmetov's company. \\"In [the 1990s], Akhmetov was very different ‚Äì he was totally private with no public persona, and was trying to find ways to deal with his 'difficult past'\\", noted U.S. ambassador William Taylor, citing prominent Ukrainian businessman Serhiy Taruta. Further in that article cited the answer of the spokesperson for Akhmetov addressed to the Kyiv Post: \\"We don't know whether this phrase is authentic and what it actually means. Although, any accusations of Mr Akhmetov's involvement in criminal structures is slander.\\" In October 1995, Bragin, president of Shakhtar Donetsk football club, was killed in a mysterious bombing along with six of his bodyguards at the team's stadium during a match. Some rumours associate Akhmetov with the death of Bragin. Following the assassinations, Akhmetov is said to have \\"inherited a vast financial empire from Bragin\\". Akhmetov, Viktor Yanukovych and Viktor Chernomyrdin Akhmetov would head Dongorbank (formerly Akceptbank) in 1995. In September 1999, an official Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs report titled the \\"Overview of the Most Dangerous Organized Crime Structures in Ukraine\\" identified Akhmetov as a leader of an organized crime syndicate. The report tied the group to money laundering, financial fraud, and the control of numerous large and fictitious companies. The report also says that the group's activities \\"have been stopped,\\" and says further that their criminal natures \\"have not been confirmed\\". Released in a WikiLeaks diplomatic cable, Volodymyr Horbulin, one of Ukraine's most respected policy strategists and former presidential advisor, told the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine in 2006 that the Party of Regions, which \\"enjoyed deep pockets, being largely financed by billionaire Donetsk boss Rinat Akhmetov\\" is partly composed of \\"pure criminals\\" and \\"criminal and anti-democracy figures\\". In a U.S. diplomatic cable dated 3 February 2006, then U.S. Ambassador John Herbst referred to Akhmetov's Party of Regions as \\"long a haven for Donetsk-based mobsters and oligarchs\\" and called Akhmetov the \\"godfather\\" of the Donetsk clan. After Ukraine's Orange Revolution of late 2004, in an attempt to fight corruption, several prominent businessmen who were also Party of Regions members came under criminal investigation;Ukraine:Information on steps taken by the Yushchenko government to address government corruption (February 2006), Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (13 March 2006) In 2011, Hennadiy Moskal, who in 2005 acted as Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, gave an interview to Ukrainian magazine –ü—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏–ª—å (profil-ua), where he claimed to have been under Presidential orders in 2005 to investigate and audit Akhmetov for his alleged role in organized crime. Concrete evidence was never officially revealed against him, nor his company. According to Moskal, the MVS investigated all incidents related to missing people in 1990s in Donetsk region, who had any property left, and its current owners, but no connections with Rinat Akhmetov and his entourage were found. Looking back, Moskal concluded that \\"we had nothing on Akhmetov in 2005\\". According to political journal's Post-Soviet Affairs, and The Nation, Akhmetov was investigated on murder charges and for his alleged role in organized crime in the Donetsk region.

Charges against Akhmetov and Kolesnikov were dropped in 2006 amid a significant rise in political power by the former, and the cooperation of the Yuschenko government, ending Akhmetov's exile.

Akhmetov's business empire has benefited enormously from his access to power. Forbes reports that in January 2014, for example, his businesses won 31% of all state tenders. In March 2017, after the DPR leadership announced that it would establish external control over all Ukrainian businesses in the republic's responsibility zone, Akhmetov released a statement saying that his businesses in the Donetsk and Lugansk People's Republics (DPR and LPR) would remain under Ukrainian jurisdiction and would not pay taxes to \\"self-proclaimed LPR and DPR\\". In April 2017, a court in Pechersk, Kyiv seized Akhmetov's shares in Ukrtelecom and TriMob, telephony and cellphone companies owned by Akhmetov. The assets seized were part of an investigation into the privatization of Ukrtelecom in 2011 and Akhmetov's ties to Victor Yanukovich, exiled to Russia in 2014. SCM has denied all allegations and issued a statement saying they would defend their ownership rights. On 19 October 2017, the state ruled that Akhmetov was to return all ownership rights to the state and pay a fine of $82 million for failing to fulfill privatization obligations.

In addition, companies in the region controlled by the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) took control of several Akhmetov owned companies.

Controversies=Euromaidan During the 2013‚Äì14 Euromaidan anti-government protests, Akhmetov became a target of protest as he was seen as a symbol of oppression. In December 2013 protesters picketed his residence in London on several occasions, urging him to cut ties with incumbent president Viktor Yanukovych. In response, Akhmetov issued a statement condemning police brutality. On 31 December, Akhmetov reprimanded a group of protesters in public near his home in Donetsk. Following the Euromaidan revolution Akhmetov lost more than half of his wealth. His net value went down from $11.2 billion to $2.9 billion in 2017. News reports suggest that much of his former wealth has been redistributed to other Russian oligarchs. Disputes in the media When dealing with public criticism and allegations concerning his past, Akhmetov has utilized a team of PR consultants and lawyers to protect his image and name. His team often contests reports on him that they consider to be libelous, scandalous, or inaccurate. To date, his legal team has obtained many retractions, apologies, and libel settlements. Critics accuse Akhmetov of going beyond protecting his name, but rather fear mongering investigative journalists. As many court cases occur in London for its lax free speech laws, critics accuse Akhmetov and his legal team of abuse of libel tourism. In January 2008, Akhmetov won a London libel court case \\"for damage to his reputation\\" for such claims, while several other statements about his \\"criminal past\\" have been retracted by the media. In a statement issued by Akhmetov's lawyer Mark MacDougall, \\"Akhmetov has done a lot of work to protect his good name from false accusations, which might hurt the reputation of his family and business. As the result of it, many publications in Ukraine and other European countries had published retractions and apologies‚Ä¶ [and] admitted that their claims are false. We think that these facts speak for themselves\\". In 2007, the Kyiv Post, the primary English language daily newspaper in Ukraine, published an article relating to Mr. Akhmetov's business transactions relating to the Dniproenergo thermoelectric generator and the Kryvorizhstal steel mill. The newspaper published an apology stating that \\"on closer examination, we concluded these allegations relating to Mr. Akhmetov were untrue and have no basis in fact.\\"Kyiv Post, 21 February 2008, Rinat Akhmetov ‚Äì The Kyiv Post's apology.

Through an error in redacting, the document accidentally revealed that while Manafort was Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Manafort met with Konstantin Kilimnik, gave Kilimnik polling data related to Donald Trump's 2016 United States Presidential campaign, and discussed a Ukraine- Russia peace plan for the ongoing Russia invasion of Ukraine with Kilimnik. As a Russian Main Intelligence Directorate GRU agent, Konstantin Kilimnik is known member of Russia's intelligence community. Although most of the polling data was reportedly public, some was private Trump campaign polling data managed by Brad Parscale. Manafort asked Kilimnik to pass the data to Ukrainians Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov.

Stage Entertainment was established in 1998 after being split off from the Live Entertainment Division of Endemol. The company has offices and theatres in eight countries (the Netherlands, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Italy and Russia).  Early years  Van den Ende started his career at age 15 as a trainee set carpenter for the Dutch Opera. Ten years later, in 1968, he opened his first independent theatrical and television production agency, Spotlight, followed by the creation in 1971 of Joop van den Ende Theaterproducties. Over the next decade his stage and television activities continued to expand, establishing him as one of the Netherlands' leading impresarios. In 1983 he bought a former flower auction building near Amsterdam which he turned into a large studio complex where he could record his television productions. In September 1988, van den Ende produced a Dutch version of the musical Barnum in the Scheveningen Circustheater, starting a new musical tradition in the Netherlands that continues to this day. In October 1993 he opened his first show on Broadway: Cyrano. The production ran until March 1994, and although the show resulted in a financial loss, the musical was van den Ende's introduction to Broadway and earned him the respect of his American peers.  Work in Television  In 1993, Van den Ende and John de Mol created television production company Endemol, combining the activities of their respective television production companies. Endemol went on to become the world's largest independent television production company, creating popular TV formats such as Big Brother, Fear Factor, Dancing with the Stars and Wipeout. Endemol was listed on the stock exchange in 1996, and in 2000 was sold to the Spanish telecom giant Telef√≥nica for ‚Ç¨5.5bn. In 2007 Endemol was sold on to a consortium including Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, as well as John de Mol, in a deal valued at ‚Ç¨2.6bn. In 1998, before the sale of Endemol, Van den Ende personally bought and took control of Endemol's live entertainment division. This was the beginning of Stage Entertainment, which soon grew into an international entertainment group.  Work in Theatre  Van den Ende's early work in live entertainment received international critical acclaim. In 1995 he received five Tony Awards for the Broadway musical Titanic, which he co-produced. In 2001 he was also awarded two Tony Awards for the musical 42nd Street, and in 2002 he received two Tony Awards for his Broadway production Into the Woods, plus three more for the play Urinetown. Under van den Ende's leadership, Stage Entertainment grew rapidly at this time, much attributed to a licensing agreement made in 2000 with Disney Theatrical Productions ( Aida, The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan, The Little Mermaid, Aladdin) and an intensive collaboration in Europe with Littlestar, Mamma Mia!‚Äôs production company. This enabled the business to expand into Germany, Spain, Russia, France, Italy and the UK. In 2007 he became president of the Stage Entertainment Supervisory Board. Van den Ende returned to Broadway in the spring of 2011 with the musical Sister Act, a co- production with Whoopi Goldberg. This marked the beginning of a new phase in van den Ende‚Äôs longstanding ambition to develop a continuous stream of original musical content. Following successful launches in Germany (Ich war noch niemals in New York, Der Schuh des Manitu, Ich will Spass!) and the Netherlands (3 Musketiers, Ciske, Petticoat, Hij Gelooft in Mij), he produced Rocky at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway and Made in Dagenham at the Adelphi Theatre in London (both in 2014). Rocky won one Tony Award, one Outer Critics Circle Award, and two Drama Desk Awards.  Other activities  In 2001, van den Ende and his wife Janine established the VandenEnde Foundation, one of the Netherlands‚Äô largest private foundations, which supports cultural and educational projects and stimulates cultural entrepreneurship. The foundation also provides scholarships to talented young performing artists. One of the foundation's most high-profile accomplishments was the reconstruction of the historic DeLaMar Theatre complex in the heart of Amsterdam. The VandenEnde Foundation ‚Äî in close cooperation with the Dutch government and together with the Bankgiro Loterij, the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds, and the VSBfonds‚Äî initiated the Blockbuster Fund, a fund designed to provide a sustainable way to make large-scale investments in culture. From 2005 to 2008, Van den Ende was active in real estate development through a joint venture that concentrated in mixed-use development and urban regeneration schemes around theatres, active in the Netherlands and abroad. Together with his business partner Hubert Deitmers, van den Ende is also active as an investor. Van den Ende & Deitmers Venture Capitalist Partners focuses on West European cross media companies via two venture capital funds.

On April 19, 1863, a detachment of the 8th Connecticut and the 89th New York landed on Hill's Point at the confluence of the forks of the Nansemond River.

HaTzionim HaKlaliym) were a centrist Zionist movement and a political party in Israel. The General Zionists supported the leadership of Chaim Weizmann and their views were largely colored by central European culture. Their political arm is an ancestor of the modern-day Likud.  History  General Zionism initially referred to the beliefs of the majority of members of the Zionist Organization (ZO) who had not joined a specific faction or party and belonged to their countrywide Zionist organizations only. The term was first used at the 1907 Zionist Congress to describe the delegates who were neither affiliated with Labor Zionism nor religious Zionism. In 1922, various non-aligned groups and individuals established the Organization of General Zionists as a non-ideological party within the Zionist Organization (later the World Zionist Organization) at a time when the Zionist movement was becoming polarized between Labour Zionists and Revisionist Zionism. Eventually the General Zionists became identified with European liberal and middle class beliefs in private property and capitalism. In 1929, the General Zionists established a world organization, holding their first conference in 1931. At this conference, rifts opened up between the conservative right wing and those who held more moderate views. They were divided over social issues, economics and labour issues (e.g. the Histadrut). The \\"General Zionists A\\" favored the economic policies of Labour Zionism and were supportive of Chaim Weizmann's compromising approach to relations with the British. The \\"General Zionists B\\" were skeptical of socialism and more outspoken against British policy in Palestine. After the independence of the State of Israel, the gap between the two groups widened. The General Zionists A helped form the Progressive Party, which won 5 seats in 1949 Knesset elections and entered the Mapai-led governing coalition. The General Zionists B, running as the General Zionists, won 7 seats and chose to remain in the opposition. In the years following the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948, the General Zionists moved towards the right in opposition to the hegemony of Mapai and other Labour Zionist movements in Israeli politics. The General Zionist party supported private enterprise, the suspension of state support to collective institutions, and the termination of the Histadrut's control of the economy. However, it favored leaving the Histadrut with state control over several aspects of economy and welfare. It also supported a unified system of education (as it contributed to the passage of the 1953 State Education Law) and a written constitution to enshrine democratic freedom and civil rights. It was secularist, though not as vocally so as the Progressive Party. Peretz Bernstein In 1936 the General Zionists established a daily newspaper, HaBoker, which was edited for the first ten years of its existence by Peretz Bernstein. It ceased publication in 1965. Political activity in Israel The General Zionists entered the elections for the first Knesset in 1949. They won 5.2% of the vote and seven seats, and were not included in either of David Ben-Gurion's coalition governments. The 1951 elections were a huge success, with the party winning 20 seats, making it the second largest in the Knesset. The party was enlarged soon after the elections when the Sephardim and Oriental Communities party and the Yemenite Association merged into it (though the one Yemenite Association MK left the party again before the end of the session). Although it was not included in the coalition for the third government, it was brought into the fourth government after Ben-Gurion had sacked the Ultra-orthodox parties, Agudat Yisrael and Poalei Agudat Yisrael, over the dispute over religious education that had brought down the previous government. It was also included in Moshe Sharett's fifth government, but not the sixth. In the 1955 elections the party slumped to 13 seats, and were not included in either of the third Knesset's coalition governments. A further slump to eight seats in the 1959 elections and exclusion from the coalition made the party rethink its strategy. Eventually the party decided to merge with the 6-seat Progressive Party to form the Liberal Party. Nevertheless, the party helped bring down the government in 1961 when it and Herut tabled a motion of no confidence in the government over the Lavon Affair. In the 1961 elections the new Israel Liberal Party won 17 seats, making it the third largest in the Knesset. During the session, ten MKs (mostly former General Zionists) merged with the right-wing Herut to form Gahal while the other seven (most from the Progressive Party) set up the Independent Liberals. Gahal later became Likud. Knesset election results { class=wikitable style=text-align:center ! Election ! Leader ! Votes ! % ! Place !

It is popular for both summer and winter activities, especially rock- climbing, hiking, camping, fishing, snowmobiling, and skiing, at the Beaver Mountain ski resort. The canyon rises to an elevation of approximately above sea level, after a vertical climb of about . Just beyond the summit is a steep road leading into Bear Lake Valley and scenic overlooks that provide dramatic views of deep blue Bear Lake. The western terminus is at Logan in Cache County and the eastern terminus is at Garden City in Rich County. Scenic Byway U.S. Route 89 through the canyon has been designated a National Scenic Byway and connects the Cache and Bear Lake valleys. Recent construction and proposed enhancements to the highway have been the focus of a decades-long confrontation between environmentalists and the Utah Department of Transportation. Some of the improvements have included reconstructing the bridges, which were in poor shape, straightening the road leading to Bear Lake, and reconstructing the Bear Lake Overlook, making it much larger and more attractive and adding basic facilities. The highway is the site of many serious and even fatal traffic accidents given the winding nature of the canyon, the drastic elevation changes, and the poor driving conditions encountered during winter weather.http://digital.lib.usu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/highway89/id/54 Attractions At the mouth of Logan Canyon along the River Trail is the Allen and Alice Stokes Nature Center, a local nonprofit and free nature center, and official educational permittee of the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest.https://www.logannature.org They offer workshops, hikes, and classes which vary by season. Among the most famous hiking trails is the treacherous Crimson Trail. It begins at Spring Hollow Campground and ends at Guinivah Campground and is noted for its amazing views, including the 'China Wall' formation. Another highly popular trail is the Wind Cave trail, which leads to the Wind Caves, a formation of 3 arches in the weathered limestone bedrock, and from which an excellent view of the China Wall can be found. Tony Grove Lake Area is situated on the Logan canyon scenic byway. A seven-mile paved road climbs to a height of 8050 feet (2454 m) to reach Tony Grove Lake and the Mount Naomi Wilderness area. The area around this glacial lake explodes into wildflowers in the early summer. The Logan River runs south to southwest through most of the canyon into Cache Valley and is a popular fishing attraction. The river is dammed in three locations near the western mouth of the canyon. The Beaver Mountain ski area is located just a mile off the highway, a few miles past the midway point from Logan to Bear Lake.

The revolt, led by Blanca Canales, was one of the multiple revolts that occurred throughout Puerto Rico on that day against the Puerto Rican government supported by the United States. The Nationalists were opposed to US sovereignty over Puerto Rico. Events leading to the revolt The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party was formed in 1922 to work for Puerto Rican Independence. By 1930 Pedro Albizu Campos, a lawyer who was the first Puerto Rican graduate from Harvard Law School, was elected president of the party. Don Pedro Albizu Campos, leader of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party In the 1930s, the United States-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Blanton Winship, and the police colonel, a former U.S. Army Colonel named Elisha Francis Riggs, applied harsh repressive measures against the Nationalist Party.Puerto Rico By Kurt Pitzer, Tara Stevens, page 224, Published by Hunter Publishing, Inc, 2001, , In 1936, Albizu Campos and the leaders of the party were arrested and jailed at the La Princesa prison in San Juan, and later sent to the Federal prison in Atlanta. On March 21, 1937, the police opened fire on the crowd at a Nationalist parade, killing 19 people in what came to be known as the Ponce massacre. Albizu Campos returned to Puerto Rico on December 15, 1947, after spending ten years in prison. On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago. The Senate, controlled by the Partido Popular Democr√°tico (PPD) and presided by Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jur√≠dica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintr√≥n This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law) when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the Partido Estadista Puertorrique√±o (Puerto Rican Statehood Party) and the only member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives who was not a member of the PPD,\\"Ley N√∫m. 282 del a√±o 2006\\" the law was repressive and in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution guaranteeing Freedom of Speech. As such, the Law was seen as an assault on the civil rights of every Puerto Rican.La Gobernaci√≥n de Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero y la Guerra Fr√≠a On June 21, 1948, Albizu Campos gave a speech in the town of Manat√≠ that explained how this Gag Law violated the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Nationalists from all over the island had gathered to hear Albizu Campos's speech and to prevent the police from arresting him. Uprising From 1949 to 1950, the Nationalists in the island planned and prepared an armed revolution. The revolution was to take place in 1952, on the date the United States Congress was to officially approve the Estado Libre Associado (\\"Free Associated State\\") political status for Puerto Rico.The Jayuya Uprising and Puerto Rican Independence; By Lenny FlankPuerto Rico Marks 60th Anniversary of Jayuya Uprising\\"Encyclopedia of Minorities in American Politics: Volume 2; Hispanic Americans and Native Americans (American Political Landscape Series)\\"; by Andrew L. Aoki (Author) and Kerry L. Haynie (Author); Page: 417; Publisher: Greenwood; . Albizu Campos called for an armed revolution because he considered the \\"new political status\\" to be a colonial farce. Albizu Campos picked the town of Jayuya as the headquarters of the revolution because of its location and because weapons were stored in the home of Blanca Canales. On October 26, 1950, Albizu Campos was holding a meeting in Fajardo, when he received word that his house in San Juan was surrounded by police waiting to arrest him. He was told that the police had already arrested other Nationalist leaders. He escaped from Fajardo and ordered the revolution to start. On October 27, the police in the town of Pe√±uelas intercepted and fired upon a caravan of Nationalists, killing four. On October 30, the Nationalists staged uprisings in the towns of Ponce, Mayag√ºez, Naranjito, Arecibo, Utuado (Utuado Uprising), San Juan (San Juan Nationalist revolt), and Jayuya. The 296th Regiment of the Puerto Rican National Guard occupy Jayuya In the pre-dawn hours of October 29, the Insular Police surrounded the house of the mother of Melit√≥n Mu√±iz Santos, president of the Pe√±uelas Nationalist Party, in Barrio Macan√°, where they were storing weapons for the Nationalist revolt. Without warning, the police fired on the house and a gunfight ensued. Two Nationalists were killed and six police officers were wounded.El ataque Nacionalista a La Fortaleza. by Pedro Aponte V√°zquez. Page 7. Publicaciones REN√â. Nationalists Melit√≥n Mu√±oz Santos, Roberto Jaume Rodr√≠guez, Estanislao Lugo Santiago, Marcelino Turell, William Gutierrez and Marcelino Berr√≠os were arrested and accused of participating in an ambush against the local Insular Police. Members of the Nationalist Party had stored weapons in Canales's house in Jayuya. Canales and the other leaders, including her cousin Elio Torresola and Carlos Irizarry, led the armed Nationalists into the town and invaded the police station. Shots were fired, one officer was killed, three were wounded, and the other officers surrendered. The Nationalists cut the telephone lines and burned the U.S. post office. Canales led the group into the town square where, in defiance of the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law), they raised the Flag of Puerto Rico.New York Latino Journal In the town square, Canales declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. Torresola had a brother, Griselio Torresola, living in New York City, who was outraged by the attacks. A P-47 Thunderbolt, the aircraft type employed to bomb Jayuya and Utuado The governor, Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, declared martial law. The Puerto Rico National Guard, under the command of the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, Major General Luis R. Esteves,Puerto Rico National Guard used P-47 Thunderbolt attack aircraft, land-based artillery, mortar fire, and grenades to counterattack the Nationalists. The planes machine-gunned nearly every rooftop in the town. After the Nationalists were forced to surrender, the Puerto Rican government made mass arrests. Although an extensive part of Jayuya was destroyed, news of the military action was prevented from spreading outside of Puerto Rico. Instead, the American media reported President Truman saying it was \\"an incident between Puerto Ricans.\\"\\"War Against All Puerto Ricans, Revolution and Terror in America's Colony\\"; Author Nelson Antonio Denis; Page 263; Publisher Nation Books; ; Nationalists in New York City as well as Puerto Rico were outraged by the counterattack. Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, among other Nationalists in the city, made a quick plan to assassinate the U.S. President, Harry S. Truman. He was reported as staying at Blair House while the living quarters of the White House were under renovation. After traveling south by train, on November 1, 1950, they attacked guards at the Blair House, seeking to gain entry. Torresola and White House police officer Leslie Coffelt were killed in the attempt; Collazo and two American officers were wounded. Aftermath The top leaders of the Nationalist party were arrested, including Albizu Campos and Blanca Canales, and sent to jail to serve long prison terms. Oscar Collazo was convicted of murder in the US and sentenced to death. U.S. President Truman commuted his sentence to life. In 1979 President Carter commuted Collazo's sentence to time served. The Nationalist was released and returned to Puerto Rico. The city of Jayuya converted the Blanca Canales home into a historical museum. The last major attempt by the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party to draw world attention to Puerto Rico's colonial situation occurred on March 1, 1954, when nationalist leader Lolita Lebr√≥n, together with fellow nationalists Rafael Cancel Miranda, Irvin Flores and Andres Figueroa Cordero, attacked members of the United States House of Representatives, shooting from the gallery and wounding several members. Lebr√≥n and her comrades were charged with attempted murder and other crimes.Ribes Tovar et al., p.132 GalleryFurther reading *Nelson Antonio Denis, War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America‚Äôs Colony, Author: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); .

It is based on the use of the solid iron fan or the folding iron fan, which usually had eight or ten wood or iron ribs. The use of the war fan in combat is mentioned in early Japanese legends. For example, Minamoto no Yoshitsune, a hero of Japanese legend, is said to have defeated an opponent named Benkei by parrying the blows of his opponent's spear with an iron fan. This use of the iron fan was said to have been taught to him by a mythological creature, a tengu, who had also instructed him in the art of swordsmanship. The practitioners of tessenjutsu could acquire a high level of skill. Some became so skilled, in fact, that they were able to defend themselves against an attacker wielding a sword, and even kill an opponent with a single blow. Like so many other Japanese arts of combat during this era, tessenjutsu reached a high level of sophistication. For example, in the late 16th century: *Sasaki Kojir≈ç was able to defeat several enemies with an iron fan *Takeda Shingen held off a mounted sword attack by Uesugi Kenshin who had burst into his command tent during the 4th Kawanakajima battle. Apart from using it in duels against enemies armed with swords and spears, the skilled wielder could also use it to fence and fend off knives and poisoned darts thrown at him. Like a sword, the tessen could be dual-wielded to parry with one hand and attack with the other. Tessenjutsu is still practiced by a few experts in Japan to this day.

He is best known as the former guitarist of Swedish progressive death metal band Opeth. Musical career Lindgren joined Opeth in 1991 as bassist for a show, but ended up switched to guitars. As explained in \\"The Making of Deliverance and Damnation\\" on Opeth's live DVD Lamentations, lead-playing duties were based on ease of Mikael √Ökerfeldt's vocal delivery and which of the two might want a given solo more. If √Ökerfeldt was having trouble with a solo, he would hand it over to Lindgren, and vice versa. In March 2004, Peter and Mikael √Ökerfeldt were both ranked #42 out of the 100 Greatest Heavy Metal Guitarists of all time by Guitar World. Throughout his career in Opeth, Lindgren has co- written the music for several songs along with Mikael √Ökerfeldt, such as \\"Black Rose Immortal\\" from Morningrise, \\"Demon of the Fall\\" from My Arms, Your Hearse as well as \\"Dirge for November\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\" from Blackwater Park. In May 2007, Peter Lindgren announced that he had left Opeth due to the rigors of life on the road as a touring musician and that he had lost his enthusiasm for playing in Opeth. Both Lindgren and √Ökerfeldt said that the split was amicable. Lindgren was since replaced by Fredrik √Ökesson. Personal life Lindgren holds degrees in engineering physics at KTH Royal Institute of Technology and literature at Stockholm University. Since his departure from Opeth, Lindgren was working as an IT consultant and senior manager in Stockholm and has so far stayed out of public eye.

Shirley Memorial Highway, often shortened to Shirley Highway, consists of a portion of Interstates 95 and 395 in the U.S. Commonwealth of Virginia. Shirley Highway was the first limited-access freeway in Virginia. Begun in 1941, the road was completed from U.S. Route 1 in Colchester, Virginia, just north of Woodbridge, to the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River between Virginia and Washington, D.C. in 1952.  History  The Shirley Highway is named in honor of Henry G. Shirley, the head of the Virginia Department of Highways (now Virginia Department of Transportation) from 1922 to 1941, who died in July, 1941, just a few weeks after giving the \\"go-ahead\\" for work on the new highway. The road was originally a four-lane highway, and it was designated State Route 350 from its southern intersection with U.S. Route 1 north of the Occoquan River near Woodbridge, Virginia, and its northern intersection with U.S. Route 1 near the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. Construction began in October 1941. The first section in Arlington, from the Pentagon south to State Route 7, mostly 2 lanes, was opened in October 1943. This section was completed with four lanes in October 1944. Due to wartime constraints, the new highway had an unusual at-grade railroad crossing instead of a bridge over the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad just north of Shirlington Circle. This location was the site of a fatal collision between a train and a dump truck on June 26, 1952.Photographs and transcript of Washington Evening Star article dated June 27, 1952, concerning crash between train and dump truck at the at-grade crossing of the Henry G. Shirley Memorial Highway and the Washington & Old Dominion Railroad in Washington & Old Dominion Railroad 1847 to 1968: A Photographic History website, by Paul McCray Accessed August 8, 2010. The remaining portions of the Shirley Highway south to U.S. Route 1 in Colchester, just north of Woodbridge, were completed in 1952. It facilitated the rapid development of Arlington County in the Shirlington, Parkfairfax, and Fairlington neighborhoods during World War II, and during that period connected the city to suburban shopping opportunities at Shirlington Shopping Center, at that time a five-minute trip away.  The original \\"Mixing Bowl\\": largest in the world  The new Shirley Highway included the \\"Mixing Bowl\\" interchange complex near the newly completed Pentagon (War Department Building), which was completed in 1944. At this location, the State Route 27 freeway (Washington Blvd.) merges with the Shirley Highway and then branches off again. The original interchange had a merge section each way, about 1/3 mile long, with a third \\"mixing lane\\" where the vehicles would weave when they wanted to change to the other freeway. It was rebuilt in the 1960s. After rebuilding, it was the largest interchange complex in the world. There are currently 52 lane-miles of roadways and ramps, with four freeway junctions and numerous local ramps, and with several interchanges to the reversible express (HOV) roadway, all within a section of the Shirley Highway.  I-95, I-395  From 1965 to 1975, the Shirley Highway was reconstructed to Interstate Highway System standards. As portions were completed, they were designated as Interstate 95. Original plans called for I-95 to cut straight through Washington, D.C., and connect with the Capital Beltway (I-495) in Maryland. However, community opposition halted this plan in 1977, diverting planned funding to construction of the Washington Metro subway system. Because of the cancellation of the originally-proposed section of I-95 from New York Avenue in the District of Columbia, northward into Prince George's County to Interstate 495, the Capital Beltway, the I-95 designation was rerouted onto the eastern half of the Beltway. The remaining portion of the Shirley Highway north of Springfield was redesignated Interstate 395, and continues into D.C. to its end at U.S. Route 50 (New York Avenue). Shirley Busway On September 22, 1969, the reversible roadway between Edsall Road and SR 7 was converted to the first separated bus rapid transit (BRT) route on an Interstate highway during peak morning commute hours (0630‚Äì0930); this was extended north to Shirlington the next day. The busway was extended to north of Glebe Road in September 1970, and then to the new Center Span Bridge on April 5, 1971. The Shirley Highway Express Bus-on-Freeway Project was implemented from June 1971 to the end of 1974, demonstrating that BRT on a highway was a feasible way to boost public transit ridership and on-time performance. However, compared to the Lindenwold High Speed Line, a light rail service of comparable distance serving approximately the same number of people, Prof. Vukan R. Vuchic found the Shirley Busway had fewer riders and revenue. Springfield Interchange The roots of the Springfield Interchange began with the Shirley Highway. This jumble of highways in Springfield, Virginia, where I-395, I-95, and the Capital Beltway meet, is officially called the \\"Springfield Interchange.\\" It is colloquially referred to as the \\"Mixing Bowl,\\" but highway officials still use that terminology to refer to the interchange complex at the Pentagon (see Pentagon road network).

Arnold Stang voiced Herman while Sid Raymond voiced Katnip. History From 1944 to September 1950, Herman the mouse, voice by Arnold Stang, was a solo star of theatrical animation shorts produced by Famous Studios and distributed by Paramount Pictures. Katnip the cat, voice by Sid Raymond, made his first appearance in November 1950 with \\"Mice Meeting You\\". The two characters continued to star in animated cartoons until 1959. In 1958, they and the other original Famous characters were purchased by comic- book publisher Harvey Comics, which continued to promote the characters under the name Harveytoons. The 1944 to 1950 Herman the Mouse cartoons (originally released as part of the Noveltoon series) were sold by Paramount in 1955 to U.M. & M. TV Corporation for television distribution.Herman and Katnip at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 11, 2015. FilmographyLegacy Animation historian Leonard Maltin described the Herman and Katnip series as a prime stereotype of the \\"violent cat versus mouse\\" battles that were commonplace among Hollywood cartoons of the 1920s through the 1960s. The violence in this series, while intended for comedic effect, often reached a level of brutality that surpassed both Tom and Jerry, Mighty Mouse, and Warner Brothers's Sylvester the Cat. All of Herman's battles with Katnip ended with Herman victorious. Only two cartoons, \\"You Said a Mouseful\\" and \\"Katnip's Big Day\\", had Katnip sharing in Herman's victory. Frequently Herman and his mouse companions would sing a victory song as they observed Katnip being brutally tortured; e.g. being eaten by sharks, killed in a rockslide while mountain climbing, strung up with Christmas lights and plugged into an electric socket, getting electrocuted by a \\"shock tester\\" machine, then flattened by it; or even dying and his ghost being warned about \\"the fiery furnace\\" in \\"Of Mice and Menace.\\" It had been originally intended that Herman and Katnip would make a cameo appearance in the film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but the scene \\"Acme's Funeral\\" was deleted. Katnip appeared later in the episode \\"Self Help Huey\\" of the animated series The Baby Huey Show as a cat redeemed by his persecutions of the past and tries that the Fox follow the same path with Baby Huey. The Simpsons writer/producer Mike Reiss insists The Itchy & Scratchy Show is based on Herman and Katnip, which he calls a \\"cheap, ultra-violent knockoff\\" of Tom and Jerry. Director David Silverman supports this, stating Herman and Katnip \\"is hilarious because it's just bad.\\" Supporting characters=Henry Prior to his battles with Katnip, Herman teamed up in several cartoons with the henpecked rooster Henry. Henry's nemesis is his domineering wife, Bertha (a.k.a. Chicken Pie), who makes him do all the work around the house, even saying that if she catches Henry loafing again, \\"I'll clip your wings and chop you down to a croquette!\\" Bertha is deathly afraid of mice, however: always \\"bawking\\" in shock every time Herman scares her. With Herman's help, Henry tries to manipulate Bertha into treating him more fairly (\\"Hey! Listen, you old hen! From now on, I'll do no more work!\\"). The title cards for the team-up shorts read \\"Featuring Herman and Henry\\"; the first such short was Henpecked Rooster (1944), and the last Sudden Fried Chicken featuring Herman and Henry (1946), in which Bertha beats the rooster hard enough to hospitalize him. Under the new name Hector, the rooster was featured in Dell Publishing's Animal Comics #7-17 (1944‚Äì1945), with Herman as ongoing co-star and artist Walt Kelly (Pogo) drawing several of the later stories. In Sudden Fried Chicken featuring Herman and Henry the cartoons also adopted the name Hector, though the \\"Henry\\" title card for unknown reasons remained unchanged. Buzzy Katnip also had his share of running battles with Buzzy, a singing black crow in a flat straw hat, who spoke in stereotypical \\"black dialect\\" and per historian Don Markstein was \\"a take-off on the gravely voice of character actor Eddie Anderson, who played Rochester on Jack Benny's show, with [Sid] Raymond (Baby Huey) as Katnip, sounding like Benny himself.\\"Buzzy the Crow at Don Markstein's Toonopedia. Archived from the original on April 5, 2015. Katnip's battle with Buzzy was usually based on Katnip trying to kick an ailment. He would read a rhyming verse from a medical book that suggested crow meat as the sure cure. Once confronted by Katnip, however, Buzzy would propose another solution in an attempt to save his own skin, to which the cat usually replied, \\"Hmmmm, that sounds logical,\\" but these solutions usually \\"failed\\" at the expense of Katnip, who would finally lose his patience and say, \\"This time, I'm doing what the book says!\\" This would result in a chase between the two characters-- with Buzzy making occasional puns at Katnip's expense along the way--and end with Buzzy victorious and Katnip nowhere near the road to recovery. Buzzy the Crow was introduced in the 1946 Paramount cartoon, produced by Famous Studios, The Stupidstitious Cat. Buzzy's mannerisms and voice were based on what are now considered the offensive stereotypes of African-Americans of the time. Jackson Beck voiced Buzzy. There were censorship issues related to Buzzy as a black stereotype. On the television series Casper and Friends, Buzzy's voice is redubbed to remove any offending content. Buzzy also frequently appeared in Harvey Comics' Baby Huey comic books in the 1960s and 1970s, in a rivalry with a cat resembling Katnip but of a different color. Sometimes this cat was named Katsy Cat. Video All \\"Herman and Katnip\\" and some Herman solo shorts have been released on public domain videocassettes and DVDs. Some prints have the U.M. & M. or NTA logo at the start and end, masking the old Paramount titles. However the UCLA Film and Television Archive restored these shorts to their original Paramount titles. In 2011, Classic Media issued Herman and Katnip: The Complete Series, a DVD collecting all of Herman and Katnip's appearances together. Also included were two Katnip solo shorts, Feast and Furious and City Kitty. The cartoons were presented in shortened TV prints from the anthology series The Harveytoons Show, with abbreviated opening titles, no end titles, and (in the case of Drinks on the Mouse) some censorship. Prints of Mice Meeting You and Mice Paradise bear the \\"Featuring Herman\\" card as seen on Herman's solo shorts, even thought these two shorts also feature Katnip.

The Shompen are a designated Scheduled Tribe.  Etymology and autonym  \\"Shompen\\" is possibly an English mispronunciation of \\"Shamhap\\", the Nicobarese name for the tribe. The Shompens living on the western side of the island call themselves Kalay, and those on the eastern side Keyet, with both groups referring to each other as Buavela. A suggestion from 1886 that the Shompen call themselves Shab Daw'a has not been confirmed by modern research.  History of contact  A group of Shompen in 1886 with variation in hair types. Before the first outside contact with the Shompen in the 1840s, there is no reliable information about these peoples. Danish Admiral Steen Bille was the first to contact them in 1846 and Frederik Adolph de Roepstorff, a British officer who had already published works on the languages of Nicobar and Andaman, collected ethnographic and linguistic data in 1876. Since then very little has been added to the stock of reliable information on the Shompen, mainly because access to the Nicobar Islands has been restricted for foreign researchers since Indian independence. A polling station was set up in their area for election of 2014. Shompen people for the first time participated in the democratic process.http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/Library&Publications;/India%20Votes%20The%20General%20Elections%202014%20.pdf  Society  In 2001, the population was estimated at approximately 300. Shompen Village-A and Shompen Village-B are home to most Shompens. Before the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the villages were home to 103 and 106 Shompens respectively. However, by the time of 2011 census, only 10 and 44 people were left in these villages respectively. They practice a hunter- gatherer subsistence economy. In keeping with the tropical climate of the islands, traditional attire includes only clothing below the waist. The traditional attire for men is a short, thin loincloth made of bark cloth, covering only the genitals without a 'tail' of cloth in front. Decoration is limited for men, consisting of bead necklaces and armbands. Women wear a knee- length skirt of bark cloth, occasionally with a shawl of bark cloth covering the shoulders. Decorations include bamboo ear plugs (ahav), bead necklaces (naigaak) and armbands of bamboo (geegap). Both sexes are barefoot. The Shompen probably learned to make and use bows from the Nicobaris. The main weapons are the bow and arrow. They do not use quivers but carry arrows by hand. Numerous types of spears, spear throwers, fire drills and a hatchet are the main tools. A man usually carried a bow and arrows, a spear and through his loincloth belt, a hatchet, knife and fire drill. The Shompen are a hunter- gatherer subsistence people, hunting wild game such as pigs, birds and small animals while foraging for fruits and forest foods. They also keep pigs and farm yams, roots, vegetables, and tobacco. Shompen huts are built to house 4 people, and villages are made up of 4 to 5 families. Once a child is grown enough, he makes his own hut. The lowland Shompen build their huts on stilts and the walls are made of woven material on a wood frame and the roof of thatched palm fronds, and the structure is raised on stilts. The highland Shompen build their houses on the ground, and the houses are made of the same materials as the raised houses. The interior is covered with mats, with sleeping mats on one end and tools and utensils hung on the walls and rafters. Cooking is done outside. In the late 1980s the Shompens were living in ten groups, ranging in size from 2 to 22 individuals, scattered across the interior of the island. Because of their isolated way of life in the interior of the island, the Shompens were largely protected from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami that devastated the coastal regions inhabited by Nicobaris and the Indian population.  Language  The Shompen languages, of which there are at least two, are very little known, but appear to be unrelated to Nicobarese, an isolated group of Austroasiatic languages, and perhaps even to each other. They may constitute a language isolate.

The westernmost portion of its range extends from the Northwest Territories along the eastern edges of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada mountains, southwards into central Mexico. Its easternmost range extends along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of North America from Nova Scotia into Texas. It was long been thought to be a Batesian mimic of the monarch butterfly, but since the viceroy is also distasteful to predators, it is now considered a M√ºllerian mimic instead. The viceroy was named the state butterfly of Kentucky in 1990.Kentucky State Butterfly, eReferenceDesk Description Its wings feature an orange and black pattern, and over most of its range it is a M√ºllerian mimic with the monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus). The viceroy's wingspan is between . cited at It can be distinguished from the monarch by its smaller size and the postmedian black line that runs across the veins on the hindwing. In Florida, Georgia, and the American Southwest, viceroys share the pattern of the queen (Danaus gilippus) and in Mexico they share the pattern of the soldier (Danaus eresimus). In all three areas, the local Danaus population mimic the coloration of the viceroy species. It was originally believed that the viceroy was a Batesian mimic of the three other species, and presumed edible or only mildly unpalatable to predators, but this has since proven not to be true. In an experiment with both the monarch's and viceroy's wings removed, birds were discovered to think the viceroy was just as unpalatable as the monarchs. Monarch (left) and viceroy (right) butterflies exhibiting what has been thought to be M√ºllerian mimicry Food sources The caterpillar feeds on trees in the willow family Salicaceae, including willows (Salix), and poplars and cottonwoods (Populus). The caterpillars sequester the salicylic acid in their bodies, which makes them bitter, and upsets predators' stomachs. As further protection, the caterpillars, as well as their chrysalis stage, resemble bird droppings. Adults are strictly diurnal, flying preferentially in the late morning and early afternoon. Adult viceroys nectar on milkweeds, thistles and other common flowers. Life stages File:Viceroy 2.jpgAdult File:Limenitis archippus larva.jpgCaterpillar File:Limenitis archippus pupa.jpgPupa Evolution of admiral butterflies (Limenitis) The world is divided into eight biogeographic realms ‚Äì Palearctic, Nearctic, Afrotropical, Neotropical, Australasian, Indomalayan, Oceanian, and Antarctic. The Palearctic realm includes most of Eurasia and North Africa while Nearctic realm includes most of North America. Limenitis butterfly wing patterns are much more diverse in the Nearctic than the Palearctic. Three lineages of mimetic butterflies occur in North America and the evolution of mimicry may have played a large role in the diversification of this group. For butterflies to travel from the Palearctic region to the Nearctic region of the world, the migration must have curred during a time period when Beringia, the land bridge between Euorasia and North America, was still above water. Based on crude divergence rate calculations, the colonization of the Nearctic Leminitis dates back approximately four million years. Whether the migration event was a single or multiple occurrence event has a significant effect on how we look at the evolution of mimicry. A history of multiple migrations would suggest that speciation occurred before the evolution of mimicry, meaning mimicry was the result of speciation instead of the driver of speciation. However, much evidence supports that a single event colonization is the best explanation. One theory of Nearctic colonization states that the reason for the colonization was a larva host plant shift. The position of the poplar admiral (L. populi), a Palearctic species, in a phylogenetic tree confirms that the poplar is the closest existing relative of the Nearctic taxa and is consistent with the theory that the host plant had a large effect on the evolution of North American admirals. Just like the wing-pattern of the Palearctic butterflies has little evidence of divergence, the host plant use of these species also shows no sign of divergence. These species only feed on different species of honeysuckle (Lonicera ssp.) The exception is the poplar that feeds exclusively on aspen (Populus tremulus of the willow family). All North American Limenitis feed on members of the willow family as well, suggesting that an (ancestral host plant shift) expansion of a novel host plant across the Bering land bridge could have driven the colonization of the Nearctic. Species level phylogenies based on the mitochondrial gene COI and the gene EFI-Œ± of Nearctic and Palearctic species also indicate a single colonization of the Nearctic species. The phylogenies produced indicate that a white-banded ancestor similar to the species L. arthemis. established itself in North America and resulted in several major lineages, three of which involved mimicry independently of each other. Given the present monophyly of the Nearctic species, it is likely that a single migration and subsequent expansion of the population was the foundation of the Nearctic butterflies. Predators and avoidance Color warnings in viceroy butterflies have been shaped by natural selection in an evolutionary relationship between prey and predator.Mallet, James and Joron, Mathieu (1999). Evolution of Diversity in Warning Color and Mimicry: Polymorphism, Shifting Balance and Speciation. Pub Annu Rev Ecol Syst 200x 30:201-33 The viceroy's main predators ‚Äì like many other butterflies ‚Äì consist mostly of birds. Batesian mimicry The viceroy's wing color ranges from tawny orange (resembling monarchs) in the north to dark mahogany (resembling queens) in the south. It has been argued that selective pressures from predators have given rise to \\"model switching\\" in the viceroy, with each subspecies being selected to copy the color pattern of the locally dominant Danaine subspecies. When the monarch's breeding range overlaps with the viceroy, the viceroy will adopt the lighter shades of orange. Towards the south, the viceroy mostly displayed darker orange phenotypes in response to the larger population of queens. It is important to note that the differences between these two morphs is only the color of the wings and the line drawn through the viceroy's lower wings; other features, such as body size and wing-pattern elements, are identical. It had been long accepted that the viceroy practiced Batesian mimicry, with the monarch and the queen serving as models. Batesian mimicry is a type of defensive behavior in which a palatable species closely resembles unpalatable or toxic species to avoid predation. Early experiments suggested that the viceroys use Batesian mimicry to defend themselves against predators. In these experiments, birds that had not been exposed to monarchs willingly ate viceroys, but those that had tasted the unpalatable monarch refused to touch the mimic. In addition, when given the choice between a mimic and non-mimic after being exposed to an unpalatable model, avian predators never ate the viceroy mimic. The M√ºllerian mimicry dispute Recent research has argued that the viceroy may be unpalatable to avian predators. If that is the case, then the viceroy butterfly displays M√ºllerian mimicry, and both viceroy and monarch are co- mimics of each other. Some literature suggests that the queen-viceroy may not be a good model-mimic pair for Batesian mimicry. Experimental evidence has shown that avian predators express aversion to the queen butterfly after being exposed to viceroys. That the avian predators avoided the queen butterfly implies that the queen does not serve as a model and the viceroy as a parasitic mimic; rather, they may be M√ºllerian co-mimics. When avian predators were exposed to butterfly abdomens without the wings, many avian predators rejected the viceroy after a single peck. Furthermore, they exhibited distress behavior similar to that displayed when eating other, known, unpalatable species. When palatability was measured by looking at avian responses to butterfly abdomen, it was found that the viceroy butterfly was significantly more unpalatable than the queen. The queen-viceroy relationship is too asymmetrical for them to be considered real co-mimics of each other. Instead, mathematical models have suggested that the queen enjoys the benefits of mimicry at the viceroy's expense, and that the model-mimic dynamic between the two should be switched. In light of this new interpretation, it has been speculated that different food plants in different geographical locations influence the palatability of the viceroy. Further investigation is needed to clarify the relationship between the viceroy and its purported models. Evolution of viceroy mimicry Based on phylogenic evidence, it is known that mimicry in the North American admirals was a driver of speciation. An essential condition for the evolution of mimicry was the presence and abundance of unpalatable models. Mimetic evolution also involved direct selection with the model acting as a \\"starting block\\" for the mimic to evolve against. The drive behind this type of evolution must be predation. Eventually, the mimetic population undergoes phenotypic fixation, usually at a point where the wing pattern and colors of the mimic have reached the closest superficial resemblance of its model. As these processes continued, the subspecies divergences began occurring as the mimetic species expanded their geographical range and began mimicking other species of butterfly. Determining what part of the butterfly genome controls wing color and pattern is also a major component that must be taken into account when trying to understand the evolution of mimicry. Each individual stripe or spot on a wing has a distinct identity that can be traced from species to species within a family. A fascinating feature of pattern genetics is that the dramatic phenotypic changes are primarily due to small changes in the gene that determines the sizes and positions of pattern elements. This discovery is in accord with the principal theory for the evolution of mimicry. The theory proposes that initial mimicry is achieved by a single mutation that has a large effect on the phenotype, which immediately gives the organism some protection, and is then refined by so-called modifier genes with lesser phenotypic effects. Consequently, if the genes for wing pattern and color were normal functioning genes, a single mating would produce several phenyotypically different offspring, making the ability for mimicry to evolve very difficult. This unique puzzle led to proposal of a possible supergene. A supergene is a tight cluster of loci that facilitate the co-segregation of adaptive variation, providing integrated control of complex adaptive phenotypes. Different genomic rearrangements have tightened the genetic linkage between different color and pattern loci with complete suppression of recombination in experimental crosses in a 400,000 base section containing at least 18 genes. This single supergene locus controls differences in a complex phenotype like wing coloration that can involve modifications of wing pattern, shape, and body color. Mimetic patterns have high fitness correlated to locally abundant wing patterns and low fitness when the offspring have recombinant, non-mimetic phenotypes. This tight-linked area of wing pattern genes explains how mimetic phenotypes are not broken up during recombination during sexual reproduction. Polymorphism Viceroys display geographic color polymorphism, which occurs when the viceroy butterflies are observed having different color forms in different regions of their territory. Color polymorphism is hypothesized to be affected by interaction between the viceroy, monarch and queen's overlapping environments. In the northern areas of their region, where monarchs predominate, viceroys are lighter, while in southern Florida, they are darker due to queens being more abundant than monarchs.

Unlike the ordinary binomial coefficient, the Gaussian binomial coefficient has finite values for m\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty (the limit being analytically meaningful for q<1): :{\\\\infty \\\\choose r}_q = \\\\lim_{m\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} {m \\\\choose r}_q = \\\\frac{1}{[r]_q!\\\\,(1-q)^r} Examples :{0 \\\\choose 0}_q = {1 \\\\choose 0}_q = 1 :{1 \\\\choose 1}_q = \\\\frac{1-q}{1-q}=1 :{2 \\\\choose 1}_q = \\\\frac{1-q^2}{1-q}=1+q :{3 \\\\choose 1}_q = \\\\frac{1-q^3}{1-q}=1+q+q^2 :{3 \\\\choose 2}_q = \\\\frac{(1-q^3)(1-q^2)}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}=1+q+q^2 :{4 \\\\choose 2}_q = \\\\frac{(1-q^4)(1-q^3)}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}=(1+q^2)(1+q+q^2)=1+q+2q^2+q^3+q^4 Combinatorial description Instead of these algebraic expressions, one can also give a combinatorial definition of Gaussian binomial coefficients. The ordinary binomial coefficient \\\\tbinom mr counts the -combinations chosen from an -element set. If one takes those elements to be the different character positions in a word of length , then each -combination corresponds to a word of length using an alphabet of two letters, say with copies of the letter 1 (indicating the positions in the chosen combination) and letters 0 (for the remaining positions). The {4 \\\\choose 2} = 6 words using 0s and 1s would be 0011, 0101, 0110, 1001, 1010, 1100. To obtain from this model the Gaussian binomial coefficient \\\\tbinom mr_q, it suffices to count each word with a factor , where is the number of \\"inversions\\" of the word: the number of pairs of positions for which the leftmost position of the pair holds a letter 1 and the rightmost position holds a letter 0 in the word. For example, there is one word with 0 inversions, 0011. There is 1 with only a single inversion, 0101. There are two words with 2 inversions, 0110, and 1001. There is one with 3, 1010, and finally one word with 4 inversions, 1100. This corresponds to the coefficients in {4 \\\\choose 2}_q = 1+q+2q^2+q^3+q^4. Noticing when q=1, the Gaussian binomial coefficient gives the same answer as the ordinary binomial coefficient does. It can be shown that the polynomials so defined satisfy the Pascal identities given below, and therefore coincide with the polynomials given by the algebraic definitions. A visual way to view this definition is to associate to each word a path across a rectangular grid with sides of height and width , from the bottom left corner to the top right corner, taking a step right for each letter 0 and a step up for each letter 1. Then the number of inversions of the word equals the area of the part of the rectangle that is to the bottom-right of the path. Balls into bins (urns) Let B(n,m,r) be the number of ways of throwing r distinguishable balls into m indistinguishable bins (urns), where each bin can contain up to n balls. The Gaussian binomial coefficient can be used to characterize B(n,m,r). Indeed, B(n,m,r)= [q^r] {n+m \\\\choose m}_q. where [q^r]P denotes the coefficient of q^r in polynomial P (see also Applications section below). Properties Like the ordinary binomial coefficients, the Gaussian binomial coefficients are center- symmetric, i.e., invariant under the reflection r \\\\rightarrow m-r : :{m \\\\choose r}_q = {m \\\\choose m-r}_q. In particular, :{m \\\\choose 0}_q ={m \\\\choose m}_q=1 \\\\, , :{m \\\\choose 1}_q ={m \\\\choose m-1}_q=\\\\frac{1-q^m}{1-q}=1+q+ \\\\cdots + q^{m-1} \\\\quad m \\\\ge 1 \\\\, . The name Gaussian binomial coefficient stems from the fact that their evaluation at is :\\\\lim_{q \\\\to 1} {m \\\\choose r}_q = {m \\\\choose r} for all m and r. The analogs of Pascal's identity for the Gaussian binomial coefficients are :{m \\\\choose r}_q = q^r {m-1 \\\\choose r}_q + {m-1 \\\\choose r-1}_q and :{m \\\\choose r}_q = {m-1 \\\\choose r}_q + q^{m-r}{m-1 \\\\choose r-1}_q. The first Pascal identity allows one to compute the Gaussian binomial coefficients recursively (with respect to m ) using the initial values :{m \\\\choose m}_q ={m \\\\choose 0}_q=1 and also incidentally shows that the Gaussian binomial coefficients are indeed polynomials (in q). The second Pascal identity follows from the first using the substitution r \\\\rightarrow m-r and the invariance of the Gaussian binomial coefficients under the reflection r \\\\rightarrow m-r . Both Pascal identities together imply :{m \\\\choose r}_q = {{1-q^{m}}\\\\over {1-q^{m-r}}} {m-1 \\\\choose r}_q which leads (when applied iteratively for m, m ‚àí 1, m ‚àí 2,....) to an expression for the Gaussian binomial coefficient as given in the definition above. q-binomial theorem There is an analog of the binomial theorem for q-binomial coefficients: :\\\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} (1+q^kt)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^n q^{k(k-1)/2} {n \\\\choose k}_q t^k . Like the usual binomial theorem, this formula has numerous generalizations and extensions; one such, corresponding to Newton's generalized binomial theorem for negative powers, is :\\\\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \\\\frac{1}{1-q^kt}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty {n+k-1 \\\\choose k}_q t^k. In the limit n\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, these formulas yield :\\\\prod_{k=0}^{\\\\infty} (1+q^kt)=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{q^{k(k-1)/2}t^k}{[k]_q!\\\\,(1-q)^k} and :\\\\prod_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{1-q^kt}=\\\\sum_{k=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^k}{[k]_q!\\\\,(1-q)^k} . Applications Gaussian binomial coefficients occur in the counting of symmetric polynomials and in the theory of partitions. The coefficient of qr in :{n+m \\\\choose m}_q is the number of partitions of r with m or fewer parts each less than or equal to n. Equivalently, it is also the number of partitions of r with n or fewer parts each less than or equal to m. Gaussian binomial coefficients also play an important role in the enumerative theory of projective spaces defined over a finite field. In particular, for every finite field Fq with q elements, the Gaussian binomial coefficient :{n \\\\choose k}_q counts the number of k-dimensional vector subspaces of an n-dimensional vector space over Fq (a Grassmannian). When expanded as a polynomial in q, it yields the well-known decomposition of the Grassmannian into Schubert cells. For example, the Gaussian binomial coefficient :{n \\\\choose 1}_q=1+q+q^2+\\\\cdots+q^{n-1} is the number of one-dimensional subspaces in (Fq)n (equivalently, the number of points in the associated projective space). Furthermore, when q is 1 (respectively ‚àí1), the Gaussian binomial coefficient yields the Euler characteristic of the corresponding complex (respectively real) Grassmannian. The number of k-dimensional affine subspaces of Fqn is equal to :q^{n-k} {n \\\\choose k}_q. This allows another interpretation of the identity :{m \\\\choose r}_q = {m-1 \\\\choose r}_q + q^{m-r}{m-1 \\\\choose r-1}_q as counting the (r ‚àí 1)-dimensional subspaces of (m ‚àí 1)-dimensional projective space by fixing a hyperplane, counting such subspaces contained in that hyperplane, and then counting the subspaces not contained in the hyperplane; these latter subspaces are in bijective correspondence with the (r ‚àí 1)-dimensional affine subspaces of the space obtained by treating this fixed hyperplane as the hyperplane at infinity. In the conventions common in applications to quantum groups, a slightly different definition is used; the quantum binomial coefficient there is :q^{k^2 - n k}{n \\\\choose k}_{q^2}. This version of the quantum binomial coefficient is symmetric under exchange of q and q^{-1}. Triangles The Gaussian binomial coefficients can be arranged in a triangle for each q, which is Pascal's triangle for q=1. Read line by line these triangles form the following sequences in the OEIS: * A022166 for q= 2 * A022167 for q= 3 * A022168 for q= 4 * A022169 for q= 5 * A022170 for q= 6 * A022171 for q= 7 * A022172 for q= 8 * A022173 for q= 9 * A022174 for q= 10 References *Exton, H.

A hieromonk can be either a monk who has been ordained to the priesthood or a priest who has received monastic tonsure. When a married priest's wife dies, it is not uncommon for him to become a monk, since the Church forbids clergy to enter into a second marriage after ordination. Ordination to the priesthood is the exception rather than the rule for monastics, as a monastery will usually only have as many hieromonks and hierodeacons as it needs to perform the daily services. In the church hierarchy, a hieromonk is of higher dignity than a hierodeacon, just as a secular (i.e., married) priest is of higher dignity than a deacon. Within their own ranks, hieromonks are assigned order of precedence according to the date of their ordination. Ranking above a hieromonk are a hegumen and an archimandrite. Forms of address The proper title for a hieromonk is, \\"the Reverend Hieromonk (religious name)\\". The form of address is, \\"Hieromonk (name)\\", \\"Father Hieromonk (name)\\", \\"Father (name)\\", or, informally, \\"Father\\". As with all Orthodox monks, a hieromonk is not addressed by his family name, but only by his religious name. In writing, if it becomes necessary to use his family name‚Äîfor instance, to distinguish him from another hieromonk with the same religious name‚Äîthe family name should be placed in parentheses. Example: \\"Hieromonk John (Smith)\\". In cultures where a patronymic is customary, monks are never addressed by their patronymic, but only by their religious name. In other countries and Western Christianity In some countries, married clergy are referred to as \\"white clergy\\", while monastic clergy are called \\"black clergy\\" because monks should always wear black clothing but married clergy in many parts of the world typically wear white (or gray, blue or some other color) cassocks and rasons. In Western Christianity, a priest who is also a monk is termed a \\"religious priest\\" or \\"regular clergy\\", i.e., living under a monastic rule (Latin: regula).

The photodetector contains three photodiodes, visible in the photo (in center). Photodetectors, also called photosensors, are sensors of light or other electromagnetic radiation. A photo detector has a p‚Äìn junction that converts light photons into current. The absorbed photons make electron‚Äìhole pairs in the depletion region. Photodiodes and photo transistors are a few examples of photo detectors. Solar cells convert some of the light energy absorbed into electrical energy.  Types  A commercial amplified photodetector for use in optics research Photodetectors may be classified by their mechanism for detection: * Photoemission or photoelectric effect: Photons cause electrons to transition from the conduction band of a material to free electrons in a vacuum or gas. * Thermal: Photons cause electrons to transition to mid-gap states then decay back to lower bands, inducing phonon generation and thus heat. * Polarization: Photons induce changes in polarization states of suitable materials, which may lead to change in index of refraction or other polarization effects. * Photochemical: Photons induce a chemical change in a material. * Weak interaction effects: photons induce secondary effects such as in photon drag detectors or gas pressure changes in Golay cells. Photodetectors may be used in different configurations. Single sensors may detect overall light levels. A 1-D array of photodetectors, as in a spectrophotometer or a Line scanner, may be used to measure the distribution of light along a line. A 2-D array of photodetectors may be used as an image sensor to form images from the pattern of light before it. A photodetector or array is typically covered by an illumination window, sometimes having an anti-reflective coating.  Properties  There are a number of performance metrics, also called figures of merit, by which photodetectors are characterized and compared * Spectral response: The response of a photodetector as a function of photon frequency. * Quantum efficiency: The number of carriers (electrons or holes) generated per photon. * Responsivity: The output current divided by total light power falling upon the photodetector. * Noise-equivalent power: The amount of light power needed to generate a signal comparable in size to the noise of the device. * Detectivity: The square root of the detector area divided by the noise equivalent power. * Gain: The output current of a photodetector divided by the current directly produced by the photons incident on the detectors, i.e., the built-in current gain. * Dark current: The current flowing through a photodetector even in the absence of light. * Response time: The time needed for a photodetector to go from 10% to 90% of final output. * Noise spectrum: The intrinsic noise voltage or current as a function of frequency. This can be represented in the form of a noise spectral density. * Nonlinearity: The RF- output is limited by the nonlinearity of the photodetector  Devices  Grouped by mechanism, photodetectors include the following devices:  Photoemission or photoelectric * Gaseous ionization detectors are used in experimental particle physics to detect photons and particles with sufficient energy to ionize gas atoms or molecules. Electrons and ions generated by ionization cause a current flow which can be measured. * Photomultiplier tubes containing a photocathode which emits electrons when illuminated, the electrons are then amplified by a chain of dynodes. * Phototubes containing a photocathode which emits electrons when illuminated, such that the tube conducts a current proportional to the light intensity. * Microchannel plate detectors use a porous glass substrate as a mechanism for multiplying electrons. They can be used in combination with a photocathode like the photomultiplier described above, with the porous glass substrate acting as a dynode stage  Semiconductor  * Active-pixel sensors (APSs) are image sensors. Usually made in a complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) process, and also known as CMOS image sensors, APSs are commonly used in cell phone cameras, web cameras, and some DSLRs. * Cadmium zinc telluride radiation detectors can operate in direct-conversion (or photoconductive) mode at room temperature, unlike some other materials (particularly germanium) which require liquid nitrogen cooling. Their relative advantages include high sensitivity for x-rays and gamma-rays, due to the high atomic numbers of Cd and Te, and better energy resolution than scintillator detectors. * Charge- coupled devices (CCD) are image sensors which are used to record images in astronomy, digital photography, and digital cinematography. Before the 1990s, photographic plates were most common in astronomy. The next generation of astronomical instruments, such as the Astro-E2, include cryogenic detectors. * HgCdTe infrared detectors. Detection occurs when an infrared photon of sufficient energy kicks an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Such an electron is collected by a suitable external readout integrated circuits (ROIC) and transformed into an electric signal. * LEDs which are reverse-biased to act as photodiodes. See LEDs as photodiode light sensors. * Photoresistors or Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) which change resistance according to light intensity. Normally the resistance of LDRs decreases with increasing intensity of light falling on it. * Photodiodes which can operate in photovoltaic mode or photoconductive mode. Photodiodes are often combined with low-noise analog electronics to convert the photocurrent into a voltage that can be digitized. * Phototransistors, which act like amplifying photodiodes. * Pinned photodiodes, a photodetector structure with low lag, low noise, high quantum efficiency, and low dark current, widely used in most CCD and CMOS image sensors. * Quantum dot photoconductors or photodiodes, which can handle wavelengths in the visible and infrared spectral regions. * Semiconductor detectors are employed in gamma and X-ray spectrometry and as particle detectors. * Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are X-ray radiation detectors used in x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron microscopy (EDX).  Photovoltaic  * Photovoltaic cells or solar cells which produce a voltage and supply an electric current when sunlight or certain kinds of light shines on them.  Thermal  * Bolometers measure the power of incident electromagnetic radiation via the heating of a material with a temperature- dependent electrical resistance. A microbolometer is a specific type of bolometer used as a detector in a thermal camera. * Cryogenic detectors are sufficiently sensitive to measure the energy of single x-ray, visible and infrared photons. * Pyroelectric detectors detect photons through the heat they generate and the subsequent voltage generated in pyroelectric materials. * Thermopiles detect electromagnetic radiation through heat, then generating a voltage in thermocouples. * Golay cells detect photons by the heat they generate in a gas-filled chamber, causing the gas to expand and deform a flexible membrane whose deflection is measured.  Photochemical  * Photoreceptor cells in the retina detect light through, for instance, a rhodopsin photon-induced chemical cascade. * Chemical detectors, such as photographic plates, in which a silver halide molecule is split into an atom of metallic silver and a halogen atom. The photographic developer causes adjacent molecules to split similarly.  Polarization  * The photorefractive effect is used in holographic data storage. * Polarization- sensitive photodetectors use optically anisotropic materials to detect photons of a desired linear polarization.  Graphene/silicon photodetectors  A graphene/n-type silicon heterojunction has been demonstrated to exhibit strong rectifying behavior and high photoresponsivity. Graphene is coupled with silicon quantum dots (Si QDs) on top of bulk Si to form a hybrid photodetector. Si QDs cause an increase of the built-in potential of the graphene/Si Schottky junction while reducing the optical reflection of the photodetector. Both the electrical and optical contributions of Si QDs enable a superior performance of the photodetector.  Frequency range  In 2014 a technique for extending semiconductor-based photodetector's frequency range to longer, lower-energy wavelengths. Adding a light source to the device effectively \\"primed\\" the detector so that in the presence of long wavelengths, it fired on wavelengths that otherwise lacked the energy to do so.

It is closely related to the black grouse (L. tetrix). It occurs in extreme southeastern Europe and adjacent regions. The scientific name of this bird commemorates the Polish naturalist Ludwik Mlokosiewicz. As with many gamebirds, the cock (male) is larger than the hen (female), measuring 50‚Äì55 cm compared to her length of 37‚Äì42 cm. The cock is very distinctive, with all-black plumage, apart from red eyebrows, and a long, deeply forked tail. The female Caucasian grouse is grey with dark barring, and has a cackling call.Madge et al. (2002) The Caucasian grouse is a sedentary species, breeding in the Caucasus and Pontic Mountains of northeast Turkey on open slopes with low Rhododendron or other scrubs but in proximity to deciduous broad-leaf forest. These bird have a group display or lek in May and June. Unlike the male Eurasian black grouse, the Caucasian grouse display is almost mute but for a thin whistling of the cock fluttering his wings as he leaps and turns in the air, producing a flash of white as the underwing feathers are briefly revealed. The hen lays up to ten eggs in a ground scrape and takes all responsibility for nesting and caring for the chicks, as is typical with gamebirds. This is perhaps the least-known of all grouse in the world, and it was formerly classified as Data Deficient by the IUCN.BLI (2004) Recent research shows that it is declining to some extent, and it is consequently listed as a Near Threatened species in 2008BLI (2008) with an estimated population of 30,203‚Äì63,034 worldwide in 2010. Conservation efforts have included encouraging ecotourism as a way to promote awareness of the bird and its habitat.

Breakout boxes span a wide spectrum of functionality. Some serve to break out every signal connection coming into a unit while others breakout only specific signals commonly monitored for either testing or troubleshooting purposes. Some have electrical connectors and others have optical fiber connectors. A breakout box serves as a troubleshooting tool to determine the wiring of an electrical connector interface on a networking device or computer. Typically, a breakout box is inserted between two electrical devices to determine which signal or power interconnects are active. Breakout boxes are extremely useful in troubleshooting connection problems resulting from manufacturing errors (e.g., miswiring) or defective interconnects resulting from broken wiring. Breakout boxes are specific examples of a more general category of network testing equipment called \\"status monitors\\". Various such monitoring devices are available for testing serial interfaces, including RS-232, RS-449, V.35, and X.21, as well as specialty interfaces. They generally come with several kinds of connectors and are quick and easy to use for isolating problems with serial transmission connections in networking, telecommunications, and industrial settings.  Variants  A four-port serial (RS-232) PCI Express √ó1 expansion card with an octopus cable that breaks the card's DC-37 connector into four standard DE-9 connectors Example of a pocket-sized RS-232 breakout box that features switches to reconfigure or patch any or all the active circuitry. This unit has one DB25 male and one DB25 female RS-232 connector The term breakout box is derived from the mechanical enclosure in which a connector's aggregate connections are separated (i.e., broken out) into individual signal or current carrying wires or cables. Often, if there are only a few connections, then a breakout cable (also called an octopus cable) may be used, as is common on notebook computers. The most common breakout boxes use D-subminiature connectors (sometimes referred to as D-sub connectors and sometimes erroneously as DB connectors) and are configured with both male and female DE-9, DA-15, DB-25, DC-37 or DD-50 standard density connectors and related test points. These units can also be used to simulate special cables, interconnect RS-232 devices, or adapt test equipment to an RS-232 device. * Breakout boxes for post-production studio editing suites. Breakout boxes (also called patch bays or patch panels) are used to patch audio/video output signals from multiple sources and connect them to other devices quickly. These boxes range from simple analog audio interconnects with up to 96 audio ins/outs to complex plug-in component with composite video, S-Video, HDMI, RS422 control, and digital signaling. * Industrial I/O breakout box. A piece of electronic test equipment used for diagnosing problems in computer communications, typically over a serial port. The breakout box sits between two pieces of equipment and usually has some LEDs to display the status of the different signals in the serial cable. It will also often have DIP switches to let the user connect or disconnect different signals in the cable, and it will usually have connector pins that let the user short pins together using electrical jumpers, or gain access to individual signal lines with an oscilloscope or other test equipment. * RS-232 breakout box: Typically, RS-232 breakout boxes offer complete control of RS-232 interface, test, re-wire and open signal lines. These devices are pocket-sized for circuit testing, monitoring and patching. The usually provide 10 interface signal powered LEDs to permanently monitor TD, RD, RTS, CTS, DSR, CD, TC, RC, DTR (E) TC signals, as well as enabling the breakout of individual circuits or reconfiguration or patching any or all of the 24 active switch positions. * Personal computer sound cards. A DA15 connector on the outside of the board is often broken out into DIN connectors for MIDI. Some professional audio applications use rackmount breakout boxes. A patch panel can also function as a breakout box, in the case of multi-channel DB25 (or other) connectors used for multi-track recording. * Docking stations for notebook computers. These draw the signal for multiple connectors from the pins of one connector. * Electronic control units (ECUs) in automotive engines have proprietary connectors that are densely packed, environmentally sealed and difficult to gain access to without causing damage.

He was a producer, playwright, and actor, as well as a historian. He managed two of New York City's earliest and most prominent theaters, the John Street Theatre (from 1796‚Äì98) and the Park Theatre (from 1798‚Äì1805). He was also an artist, despite losing an eye in childhood. Rockingham He was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, the son of an army officer wounded at the Battle of Quebec in 1759. In 1783, he painted a portrait of George Washington, while staying at Rockingham in Rocky Hill. The painting is now owned by the United States Senate. He later studied art under Benjamin West in London. Another teacher was Abraham Delanoy, with whom he had a handful of lessons in New York. After returning to America in 1787, he worked exclusively in the theater for 18 years, resuming painting out of economic necessity in 1805. By 1817, he was a full-time painter. In his lifetime he produced more than sixty plays, most of which were adaptations or translations from French or German works. A few were original: these were based on American themes and had American characters. However, he is best known for his encyclopedic three-volume History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, which was published in 1834, and which is now an invaluable source of information about artists, collecting, and artistic life generally in the colonial and federal periods. His plays include: *The Father (1789) *Andre (1798) *The Stranger (1798) *The Italian Father (1799) *False Shame (1799) *The Virgin of the Sun (1800) *The Glory of Columbia, Her Yeomanry (1803) *Memoirs of George Frederick Cooke (1813) *A Trip to Niagara (1828) In 1825 Dunlap was one of the founders of the National Academy of Design, and taught at its school. He published his History of the American Theater in two volumes in 1832. ReferencesFurther reading * William Dunlap.

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. The casino hotel features 2,798 rooms and is the largest hotel in New Jersey. Borgata opened in July 2003 and is the top-grossing casino in Atlantic City. History Borgata was part of a major project in Atlantic City nicknamed \\"The Tunnel Project\\", started around 1999. When Steve Wynn planned the Le Jardin in Atlantic City, he wanted to connect a $330 million tunnel from the Atlantic City Expressway to the new resort, later named the Atlantic City- Brigantine Connector, which would funnel incoming traffic off the Atlantic City Expressway into the city's marina district. This caused major controversy, as it would cut through a residential neighborhood; competitor and future president Donald Trump sued Wynn for it saying that it was a \\"driveway\\" to Wynn's casino. The Tunnel Project did progress, even after Le Jardin was cancelled, and finally opened in 2001. Borgata opened on July 2, 2003, at 11:45 pm, as a joint venture between MGM Mirage and Boyd Gaming. The main tower - the third tallest building in Atlantic City - is visible from many miles away due to its facade of reflective gold glass. The firms Marnell Corrao Associates of Las Vegas, and Philadelphia‚Äôs Bower Lewis and Thrower Architects (BLT) worked on the project. In late 2005 and early 2006, Borgata underwent a $200 million casino and retail expansion, and the new wing opened in June 2006. As part of the expansion, Borgata installed a poker room, the largest in Atlantic City. In June 2008, Borgata opened its second hotel, The Water Club. In early 2010, it was reported that MGM Mirage might sell its ownership share in Borgata. On March 12, 2010, MGM Mirage announced it would sell its stake in Borgata and stop doing business as a gaming licensee in New Jersey. On March 17, 2010, MGM Mirage announced that the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) approved the settlement agreement between the Company and the New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) under which the Company would sell its 50% ownership interest in the Borgata. In September 2014, the CCC reversed its earlier decision and allowed MGM back into the state, after finding that Pansy Ho's role in MGM Macau had been reduced. MGM agreed in May 2016 to purchase Boyd's 50 percent stake in the Borgata for $900 million in cash and assumed debt. MGM then sold the property to its affiliated real estate investment trust for $1.18 billion and leased it back. The sale to MGM Resorts was completed in August 2016. Gaming The casino area of Borgata The casino floor offers about 4,000 slot machines, 180 table games, and 50 poker tables. Borgata‚Äôs poker program features daily tournaments and high-stake tournaments in conjunction with the World Poker Tour. For weekly events, buy-ins range from $30 to $1,000, but the hotel also hosts other major events throughout the year. The Borgata also has a sportsbook called the Race & Sports Book that offers sports betting. Borgata has extensive online gambling operations. In 2009, a player at the casino broke records at the craps tables, rolling a pair of dice 154 times continuously without throwing a seven. Patricia Demauro, a New Jersey grandmother, had a lucky streak which lasted four hours and 18 minutes, breaking the world records for the longest craps roll and the most successive dice rolls without \\"sevening out.\\" Hotel towers=Main tower Exterior of The Borgata and The Water Club, 2016.

Only seven miners survived and the mine burned for one full day. No 1 Esplanade Explosion Monument (see gallery for text detail) The explosion started deep underground in the Number One Coal Mine after explosives were laid improperly. Although many miners died instantly, others were trapped by the explosion and the fires that followed. Most miners did not die from the primary explosions or the fires, but many actually died from choking on poisonous gas hours after the initial explosions. These men wrote farewell messages in the dust of their shovels. Nearly 150 children lost their fathers and 46 women became widows.Vancouver Island University, Benton Family History A plaque at the foot of Milton Street commemorates the event. Although past documents put the death toll at 148, researchers have since revised the number to 150, including 53 Chinese workers. Chinese workers were listed in the government inquest and annual report of the Minister of Mines as \\"Chinamen, names unknown\\", followed by a tag number. B.C. employers did not have to report the deaths of Chinese employees until 1897. Some accounts suggest that 48 of the 53 miners had the surname of Mah ‚Äî records may have been destroyed when Nanaimo's Chinatown burned to the ground in 1960. The monument on Milton Street lists the names of white miners, but only the tally number for Chinese miners, who were blamed by many white Nanaimoites for the disaster, claiming they could not read signs or instructions. Operated by the Vancouver Coal Company, the Number One mine opened in 1884 at the foot of Milton Street in Nanaimo. Its shafts and tunnels extended under the harbour to Protection Island, Newcastle Island, and the Nanaimo River. After the explosion, the mine re-opened and produced 18 million tons of coal before permanently closing in 1938.

The government warehouse in Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) was painted on glass by Michael Pangrazio at Industrial Light & Magic, and combined with live-action footage of a government worker, pushing his cargo up the center aisle. A matte painting is a painted representation of a landscape, set, or distant location that allows filmmakers to create the illusion of an environment that is not present at the filming location. Historically, matte painters and film technicians have used various techniques to combine a matte- painted image with live-action footage. At its best, depending on the skill levels of the artists and technicians, the effect is \\"seamless\\" and creates environments that would otherwise be impossible or expensive to film. In the scenes the painting part is static and movements are integrated on it.  Background  Traditionally, matte paintings were made by artists using paints or pastels on large sheets of glass for integrating with the live-action footage.Matte World Digital  SIGGRAPH 1998 ‚Äì Matte Painting in the Digital Age  Traditional Matte Paintings  Craig Barron The first known matte painting shot was made in 1907 by Norman Dawn (ASC), who improvised the crumbling California Missions by painting them on glass for the movie Missions of California.The Invisible Art: The Legends of Movie Matte Painting by Mark Cotta Vaz and Craig Barron, Chronicle Books, 2002; p. 33 Notable traditional matte-painting shots include Dorothy's approach to the Emerald City in The Wizard of Oz, Charles Foster Kane's Xanadu in Citizen Kane, and the seemingly bottomless tractor-beam set of Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. The first Star Wars documentary ever made (The Making of Star Wars, directed by Robert Guenette in 1977 for television) mentioned the technique used for the tractor beam scene as being a glass painting.The Making of Star Wars as told by C-3PO and R2-D2, 1977, directed by Robert Guenette (glass painting technique explained at point 4'45) By the mid-1980s, advancements in computer graphics programs allowed matte painters to work in the digital realm. The first digital matte shot was created by painter Chris Evans in 1985 for Young Sherlock Holmes for a scene featuring a computer-graphics (CG) animation of a knight leaping from a stained-glass window. Evans first painted the window in acrylics, then scanned the painting into LucasFilm's Pixar system for further digital manipulation. The computer animation (another first) blended perfectly with the digital matte, which could not have been accomplished using a traditional matte painting.The Invisible Art, Cotta Vaz/Barron, pp. 213, 217  New technologies  Throughout the 1990s, traditional matte paintings were still in use, but more often in conjunction with digital compositing. Die Hard 2 (1990) was the first film to use digitally composited live-action footage with a traditional glass matte painting that had been photographed and scanned into a computer. It was for the last scene, which took place on an airport runway.The Invisible Art, Cotta Vaz/Barron, p. 227 By the end of the decade, the time of hand-painted matte paintings was drawing to a close, although as late as 1997 some traditional paintings were still being made, notably Chris Evans‚Äô painting of the RMS Carpathia rescue ship in James Cameron‚Äôs Titanic.The Invisible Art, Cotta Vaz/Barron, p. 19 Paint has now been superseded by digital images created using photo references, 3-D models, and drawing tablets.

The service was carried on the Austar and Optus Vision pay-TV networks between 1995 and 2002. Seven unsuccessfully pursued court action against competitors, seeking damages of $480 million, but lost the case and was described by the judge as exhibiting \\"more than a hint of hypocrisy\\" in regard to the issue of price-ramping of broadcast rights..  Early history  When Optus Vision launched in 1995, it carried two sports channels: Sports Australia, and Sports AFL (which showed Australian Football League games.) These channels were run by a company called Sports Vision, in which Seven Network was a partner. A third channel, Sports Australia 2, was added during the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, and later used to show additional live programming. The programming lineup on the Sports Australia service rivalled Fox Sports, with the AFL, NRL premiership, the Australian National Soccer League, the FA Premier League, and Sheffield Shield cricket. At the time, Fox Sports focused on less popular sports.  Seven's involvement  In 1997 Sports Vision ran into financial difficulty; Sports Australia struggled to get viewers due to the limited reach of the Optus cable, and aggressive marketing of the Fox Sports service by Foxtel. The company eventually collapsed, but the Seven Network bought the channels and relaunched them on 1 March 1999 under the C7 Sport brand. Sports Australia became \\"C7 Gold\\", or \\"C7 Twelve\\", after its channel assignment on Optus. Sports Australia 2 became \\"C7 Blue\\", or \\"C7 Thirteen\\". Sports AFL's programming was carried on the other two channels. Shortly afterwards, Seven signed a deal with Austar that saw C7 become available to most of regional Australia from April. Austar had many more subscribers than Optus at the time. Before the deal, C7 had only been available in the small Optus cabled areas in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. C7 was never available to the majority of people in the capital cities (except Hobart and Darwin). Olympics coverage C7 continued to lose programming to Fox Sports; after the Super League war in 1997, C7 no longer had exclusive rights to NRL games, having to share them with Fox, and had totally lost the rights to the FA Premier League. C7 began negotiations with Foxtel in order to make the channels available to a wider audience, but Foxtel refused to carry them. Foxtel claimed that C7 was an inferior service, for which Seven wanted an exorbitant price. C7 won two Federal Court actions backing their position, but Foxtel claims it acted in accordance with the Court's rulings. Seven won the right to put its programming on Foxtel's analog cable system, including its set-top boxes. C7 still had the AFL and, crucially, had the rights to the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Two more channels (\\"C7 Olympic\\" and \\"C7 Games\\") were set up, which would carry non-stop Olympic programming during the Games; the channels being made available to Austar and Optus customers at additional cost. Foxtel and C7 negotiated access to Games content for Foxtel viewers. C7 was later forced to give refunds to some customers after the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruled that they had misrepresented the C7 Olympic service by advertising that the service would carry all Australian men's and women's basketball games. Litigation  Late in 2000, Seven lost the rights to the AFL to a News Corp Australia headed consortium also containing PBL, Nine Network, Network Ten and Telstra. The new rights deal, which started with the 2002 season, saw Nine and Ten carry games on free-to-air, and a new service, Fox Footy Channel, launched on Foxtel. C7 continued to provide its service to Optus and Austar, but its programming lineup near the end of its run was extremely weak. C7 was reduced to showing XFL games (on several weeks' delay) and live woodchopping in prime time. Optus dropped the channel in late March, replacing it with Fox Sports. Soon after Austar replaced it with the Fox Footy Channel. With no carrier, the channel was officially closed on 7 May. Later that year, Seven launched what is considered to be the largest-ever media lawsuit in Australia, naming 22 defendants including Nine, Ten, Optus, Austar, the AFL, the NRL, Fox Sports, PBL and Telstra. Claim Seven's principal claims, relying on anti-competitive provisions in Part IV of the Trade Practices Act, were that: * Foxtel denied C7 access to Telstra's cable network and Foxtel's STBs in order to weaken C7's position when negotiating television deals with the AFL and NRL; * One or more of the named defendants acted illegally to collude in the marketplace and use their combined market power to prevent competition; * Foxtel's owners (Telstra, News Corporation and PBL) signed an agreement in late-1999 to ensure Foxtel gained the AFL and NRL rights. * Optus's undertaking to carry Fox Sports was a breach of an 'exclusive' contract it had with Seven for provision of sports programming. Seven claimed damages of A$480 million (amended from the original A$1.1 billion).Ryan, Peter. C7 court case gets personal ABC radio PM, 27 September 2005.

C7 lost the case conclusively on most points with Justice Sackville declaring that, based upon the anti-competitive provisions of the Trade Practices Act upon which Seven relied, the case could not succeed. In a key point, he explained that \\"the reason is that even if each of the consortium respondents had the objective attributed to it by Seven‚Äîthat of killing C7‚Äîachieving that objective could not have substantially lessened competition in the retail television market.\\" Justice Sackville labelled Seven as \\"far from a helpless and innocent victim\\", being \\"the author of its own misfortune\\" and stating \\"there is more than a hint of hypocrisy in certain of Seven's contentions.\\" He was unable to accept Seven's chairman Kerry Stokes as a reliable witness.. The judge also commented on the hefty financial cost of the case, remarking that \\"in my view, the expenditure of $200 million and counting on a single piece of litigation is not only extraordinarily wasteful, but borders on the scandalous\\".. The case has continually been labelled by both the legal and media sectors as one of the most extreme examples of \\"mega-litigation\\". Costs hearing In costs documents lodged on 27 August 2007, the NRL, one of the defendants in the case, argued for an indemnity costs order, the actual costs incurred by the parties, to be awarded against Seven, with the figure estimated at approximately $200 million.

Today it is the headquarters of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. Open to the public for tours, Taliesin West is located on Frank Lloyd Wright Boulevard in Scottsdale, Arizona. The complex drew its name from Wright's home, Taliesin, in Spring Green, Wisconsin.  History  Wright and the Taliesin Fellowship began to \\"migrate\\" to Arizona each winter in 1935 to escape the harsh Wisconsin winters for Wright's health on his doctor's advice. In 1937 Wright purchased the plot of desert land that would soon become Taliesin West. He paid \\"$3.50 an acre on a southern slope of the McDowell Range overlooking Paradise Valley outside Scottsdale.\\" Wright believed this to be the perfect spot for such a building: a place of residence, a place of business and a place to learn. Wright described it like this, \\"Finally I learned of a site twenty-six miles from Phoenix, across the desert of the vast Paradise Valley. On up to a great mesa in the mountains. On the mesa just below McDowell Peak we stopped, turned, and looked around. The top of the world.\\" An investment of over $10,000 was needed to dig a well deep enough to provide sufficient water for the campus. In the initial winters Wright and his students lived in tents while they built the first structures, mainly by hand using as much local material as possible (rocks, stone and sand). The design of the buildings complemented the natural Sonoran Desert landscape of the site. When Wright and his family arrived they found Native American petroglyphs among the rocks. One, seen today at the beginning of the guided tour, shows what may be hands clasping. Wright stylized the figures into interconnected lines, which became the symbol of Taliesin West.  Design  Desert masonry Wright felt very strongly about the connection to the desert. He said: The structure's walls are made of local desert rocks, stacked within wood forms, filled with concrete - colloquially referred to as \\"desert masonry\\". Wright always favored using the materials readily available rather than those that must be transported to the site. In Wright's own words: \\"There were simple characteristic silhouettes to go by, tremendous drifts and heaps of sunburned desert rocks were nearby to be used. We got it all together with the landscape‚Ä¶\\" The flat surfaces of the rocks were placed outward facing and large boulders filled the interior space so concrete could be conserved. Taliesin West's pool and fountain Natural light also played a major part in the design. In the drafting room, Wright used translucent canvas to act as a roof (later replaced by plastic because of the intense wear from the Arizona sun). In the south-facing dining room, Wright did not take the masonry walls from floor to ceiling, and designed the roof to hang past the walls preventing unwanted sun rays from penetrating but allowing for horizontal light to pass through the room. Wright believed natural light aided the work environment he had his apprentices in, keeping the inside of his building in touch with the natural surroundings. Every part of Taliesin West bears Frank Lloyd Wright's personal touch. Upon every return after a summer in Wisconsin Wright would grab a hammer and immediately make his way through the complex. He would walk through each room making changes or shouting orders to apprentices closely following with wheelbarrows and tools. He constantly changed and improved on his design fixing arising problems and addressing new situations. Throughout the years he enlarged the dining room, as well as added the cabaret theatre, music pavilion and numerous other rooms. All of the furniture and decorations were designed by Wright and the majority built by apprentices. A brilliant aspect of Wright's design is the cabaret theatre. Built with six sides, out of the standard rock-concrete mixture, in an irregularly hexagonal shape, the theatre provides its occupants with what someone has called \\"95% acoustic perfection\\". Someone sitting in the back row can hear the lightest whisper from a speaker on stage.  Power lines controversy  The view at Taliesin West was critical to its success. In the 1940s, Wright waged a battle against overhead power lines on aesthetic grounds. In the late 1940s when power lines appeared within the view of Taliesin West, Wright wrote President Harry S. Truman, demanding they be buried; it was a losing battle. So after briefly considering rebuilding in Tucson, he \\"turned his back on the valley,\\" moving the entrance to the rear of the main building.Gretchen McKay, Taliesin West shows how architect, Frank Lloyd Wright, built in harmony with nature, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, March 27, 2010.  Legacy  Garden room exterior During his lifetime, Wright continually altered and added to the complex of buildings, all of which were constructed by students. Many of Wright's most famous buildings were designed in the drafting room at Taliesin West, including the Guggenheim Museum in New York City and Grady Gammage Auditorium at Arizona State University in Tempe. Taliesin West continues as the headquarters of The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and as the winter home for the School of Architecture at Taliesin. As in Wright's time, students and faculty spend the summers in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The School of Architecture at Taliesin offers an accredited Master of Architecture (M.Arch) degree focused on Wright's principles. The structure was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 12, 1974, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark on May 20, 1982. In 2008, the U.S. National Park Service submitted Taliesin West along with nine other Frank Lloyd Wright properties to a tentative list for World Heritage Status. The 10 sites have been submitted as one single site. The January 22, 2008, press release from the National Park Service website announcing the nominations states that, \\"The preparation of a Tentative List is a necessary first step in the process of nominating a site to the World Heritage List.\\" After revised proposals, Taliesin West and seven other properties were inscribed on the World Heritage List under the title \\"The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright\\" in July 2019.

Herod the Great built a palace fortress and a small town at Herodium, between 23 and 15 BCE, and is believed to have been buried there. Herodium is 758 meters (2,487 ft) above sea level, the highest peak in the Judaean Desert.Herodion National Park Today, the site is controlled by the Israel National Parks Authority and is a designated national park.Jonathan Cook, 'Herod exhibit digs up controversy,' Al Jazeera 1 Mar 2013: 'Both the archeological sites at Herodium and Jericho are regulated by the Civil Administration, a body of military officials who oversee Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories. Israel has justified its control of the sites on the grounds that they are located in Area C, the nearly two-thirds of the West Bank over which Israel was given control by the Oslo Accords until a peace deal with the Palestinians was agreed.Benny Ziffer, 'Herodium Turns Into a Cultural Settlement,' Haaretz 22 February 2013:' Amid the general enthusiasm, one small technical detail was almost forgotten: that the excavation was conducted on Palestinian territory. Under international conventions, an occupying power may not conduct excavations in territories under its military control, with the exception of \\"rescue\\" digs carried out to preserve an archaelogical site unintentionally brought to the surface. In the case of Herodium, where the excavations have gone on for years, there was no way of considering them rescue digs. In a report aired on Israel's Channel 2 at the time, it could be clearly seen how the excavations had disrupted the lives of residents of the Palestinian village surrounding Herodium, turning the mound into a kind of settlement - a cultural settlement - maintained by military force. The sight was shocking, because here brutality was ostensibly used for the purpose of promoting high culture, and for scientific and artistic reasons.‚Äô Israel asserts that it is entitled to work the area under the Oslo Accords, but Palestinian authorities say Israel has no right to undertake digs there or remove artifacts to Israel discovered in excavations there. Etymology Upper Herodium, looking south. The columns to the left near the wall belong to the peristyle hall. Herodion is the only site that is named after King Herod the Great. It was known by the Crusaders as the \\"Mountain of Franks\\". Arab locals call it Jabal al-Firdous (ÿ¨ÿ®ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÅÿ±ÿØŸàÿ≥) (\\"Mountain of Paradise\\").Gu√©rin, Victor. \\"Description de la Palestine (Description of Palestine)\\". L'imprimerie Imp√©riale: Paris 1869, pp. 125‚Äì132. The Modern Hebrew name, Herodion (), is actually a transliteration of the Greek spelling. However, modern Israeli archaeologists have confirmed that the site's original Hebrew name was Herodis (), just as this name is inscribed in one of the Bar Kokhba letters recovered from the Muraba‚Äôat Caves in the Judaean desert.Roland de Vaux, Discoveries in the Judaean Desert, vol. 2, Oxford 1961, pp. 126, 130-131. The letter reads (partially effaced): \\"On the 20th day of the month Shevat, in the 2nd year of Israel's redemption by Simeon the son of K[osi]ba, the nasi of [Is]rael, in the camp that is situated at Herodis...\\" Original Hebrew: ◊ë◊¢◊©◊®◊ô◊ü ◊ú◊©◊ë◊ò ◊©◊†◊™ ◊©◊™[◊ô◊ù] ◊ú◊í◊ê◊ú◊™ [◊ô]◊©◊®◊ê◊ú ◊¢◊ú ◊ô◊ì ◊©◊û◊¢◊ï◊ü ◊ë◊ü ◊õ[◊ï◊°]◊ë◊ê ◊†◊°◊ô◊ê [◊ô◊©]◊®◊ê◊ú ◊ë◊û◊ó◊†◊î ◊©◊ô◊ï◊©◊ë ◊ë◊î◊®◊ï◊ì◊ô◊° History=Construction In 40 BCE, after the Parthian conquest of Syria, Herod fled to Masada. On the way, at the location of Herodion, Herod clashed with Jews loyal to his enemy Antigonus, and emerged victorious. According to the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, he \\"built a town on that spot in commemoration of his victory, and enhanced it with wonderful palaces... and he called it Herodion after himself\\".(The Wars of the Jews I, Chapter 13) . On the historical circumstances of the building of Herodium, see: Jonathan Bourgel & Roi Porat, \\"Herodium as a Reflection of Herod‚Äôs Policy in Judea and Idumea,\\" Zeitschrift des Deutschen Pal√§stina- Vereins 135/2 (2019), 188-209. Josephus describes Herodium as follows: Archaeologists believe that the palace was designed by architects and built by slaves and paid workers (contractors). Herod was considered one of the greatest builders of his time and was not daunted by geography‚Äîhis palace was built on the edge of the desert and was situated atop an artificial hill. The largest of the four towers was built on a stone base 18 meters in diameter. This was most likely where Herod lived; he decorated his rooms with mosaic floors and elaborate frescoes. The other three towers, which consisted of living spaces and storage, were 16 meters in diameter. Outside, several cisterns were built to collect water that was channeled into the palace. Great Revolt Herodium was conquered and destroyed by the Romans in 71 CE. Bar Kokhba revolt At the beginning of the Bar Kokhba revolt sixty years later, Simon bar Kokhba declared Herodium as his secondary headquarters. Archaeological evidence for the revolt was found all over the site, from the outside buildings to the water system under the mountain. Inside the water system, supporting walls built by the rebels were discovered, and another system of caves was found. Inside one of the caves, burned wood was found which was dated to the time of the revolt. The fortress was commanded by Yeshua ben Galgula, who was likely Bar Kokhba's second in command. Excavation history Section of mosaic floor unearthed at Herodion Upper Herodium The archaeological excavation of Herodium was begun in 1962 by Virgilio Canio Corbo and Stanislao Loffreda, from the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum of Jerusalem, and it continued until 1967: they discovered the upper citadel, at the top of the hill.Virginio Canio Corbo, Herodion. I: Gli edifici della reggia-fortezza, Jerusalem 1989 Pilate ring In 1968‚Äì1969, during excavations directed by archaeologist Gideon Foerster, at a section of Herod's burial tomb and palace hundreds of artifacts were found, including a copper alloy ring. The ring was overlooked but in 2018 it was given a thorough laboratory cleaning and scholarly examination. At the center of the ring is an engraved krater, or amphrae similar in style to the monumental urn (handleless amphorae or acroteria) of Herodium David E. Graves, ‚ÄúPilate‚Äôs Ring And Roman Religion,‚Äù Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin 64 (2019): 1‚Äì20 which is encircled by \\"partly deformed\\" Greek letters spelling out \\"of Pilates\\" in Greek. Although scientists were not sure about who is the \\"Pilates\\" mentioned on the ring, media published that it could possible belong to the Pontius Pilate. Archaeologist Roi Porat told that all explanations are equally possible for who was the owner of the ring: \\"It was important to publish a careful scientific article,\\" \\"But in practice we have a ring inscribed with the name Pilate and the personal connection just cries out,\\" While much of the debate has focused on the Greek name inscribed on the ring, the image is of equal significance and may further support that this was the ring used by the administrative assistant for Pilate for sealing the documents the governor Pontius Pilate. The image on the ring is possibly associated with Roman religious ceremonies (i.e., suovetaurilia, bacchanalia) and the imperial cult that were characteristic of the images on the coins that Pilate had minted during his term as governor David E. Graves, ‚ÄúPilate‚Äôs Ring And Roman Religion,‚Äù Near East Archaeological Society Bulletin 64 (2019): 1‚Äì20. Lower Herodium From 1972, excavations were carried out by Ehud Netzer, working on behalf of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and they were intermittent until the archaeologist's death in 2010. Netzer excavated mostly the lower palace, at the base of the hill. Description=Herod's hilltop palace Remains of the eastern round tower Palace garden, the northern exedra Herod the Great built a palace within the fortress of Herodium. Herod himself commissioned a lavish palace to be built between 23 and 15 BCE atop Herodium for all to see. The palace itself consisted of four towers of seven stories, a bathhouse, courtyards, a Roman theatre, banquet rooms, a large walkway (\\"the course\\"), as well as extravagant living quarters for himself and guests. Once Herod died and the Great Revolt started, Herodium was abandoned. The Jews eventually had a base at Herodium where they built a synagogue which can still be seen today, unlike much of Herod's Palace. =Bathhouse= The Roman bathhouse consisted of three areas, the caldarium, the tepidarium, and the frigidarium. It also had a very impressive dome which is still in good condition today despite thousands of years of earthquakes and wars. The caldarium had vaulted ceilings, raised floors, and channels in the walls to conduct heat. The tepidarium had mosaic floors and frescoes just like the living quarters of the palace. The frigidarium, the last stop in the bathhouse, was where guests would cool off in a large pool. =Synagogue= A pre-year-70 synagogue at Herodium is of the Galilean-type, featuring stone benches built along the walls and aisles formed by columns that supported the roof. It is one of the oldest synagogues in the Levant. =Theatre= Netzer discovered the Roman Theatre just before his death in late 2010. The royal theatre was uncovered near the base of Herod's tomb (see Herodium#Tomb of Herod). The theatre contained an elaborately decorated loggia, or a theatre box, was discovered. This means that when Herod or other notable officials went to see a play, they would receive luxury treatment. The rest of the audience would be seated below on benches that could accommodate about 450-650 people. What is quite unique about this find is that frescoes of landscapes were discovered, of a kind suggesting that the painters were well travelled; they depict scenes of Italy and even the Nile River in Egypt. It is also assumed that the painters were on loan to Herod from Caesar in Rome. Tomb of Herod Hebrew University professor Ehud Netzer reported on 8 May 2007 that he had discovered the tomb of Herod, above tunnels and water pools at a flattened site halfway up the hill to the hilltop palace-fortress of Herodium, south of Jerusalem. Later excavations strengthened the idea that this site is Herod's mausoleum. The base of the tomb has now been uncovered and is visible to visitors to the site. The 2009‚Äì2010 excavations uncovered near the tomb base a small 450-seat capacity theatre (see Herodium#Theatre). Netzer died in October 2010 from injuries sustained from a fall at the site, and access to the mausoleum was subsequently blocked to the public pending review of the site's safety. In October 2013, archaeologists Joseph Patrich and Benjamin Arubas challenged the identification of the tomb as that of Herod. According to Patrich and Arubas, the tomb is too modest to be Herod's and has several unlikely features. Roi Porat, who replaced Netzer as excavation leader after the latter's death, stood by the identification.

Legal aspects In February 2013 an exhibit dedicated to Herod at the Israel Museum featured finds from among some 30 tons of material transferred from the Herodium site back into Israel.Yigal Bronner and Yonathan Mizrachi, 'King Herod, long reviled, finds new love among Jewish settlers,' The Forward 19 May 2013: 'Since Herodion and Herod's palaces in Jericho are located in the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, they are‚Äîaccording to international law, the codes of ethics for the preservation of antiquities, and even the Oslo Accords‚Äîsupposedly under Palestinian control and responsibility. One could imagine a very different scenario. The exhibition at the Israel Museum could have been based on joint Israeli-Palestinian research, performed both in Israel and in Palestine, and, as is standard throughout the world, it could and should have loaned the artifacts from the Palestinian Antiquities Authority. Instead, the museum opted for the dominant \\"no partner\\" approach and simply appropriated tons of artifacts from West Bank sites, as if this were merely a matter of transferring Israeli property to its rightful place in the national museum. Indeed, the museum preferred to partner with the so-called \\"Civil Administration,\\" which runs the occupation of the West Bank and turned Herodion into a profitable settlement (from which Palestinians are barred).' The Palestinian National Authority protested, and Rula Maayah, the Palestinian tourism and antiquities minister said that according to international law Israelis have no right to excavate Herodium, which is in the occupied West Bank, or to take any antiquities from it. Palestinian officials compared the exhibition to the historical plunder of archaeological treasures by former colonial powers.Israel looting West Bank's treasures (The Daily Star, Al Jazeera, March 2, 2013) Some Israeli commentators have argued that, such excavations of, and removal of material from, sites in the Palestinian territories go beyond what is permitted to an occupying power such as Israel. One Israeli archaeologist, Yonathan Mizrachi, in an article co-written with Yigal Bronner, stated that, 'Since Herodion and Herod's palaces in Jericho are located in the territories that Israel occupied in 1967, they are‚Äîaccording to international law, the codes of ethics for the preservation of antiquities, and even the Oslo Accords‚Äîsupposedly under Palestinian control and responsibility.' The Israel Museum's director, James S. Snyder initially stated that the items from Herodium would be returned to the West Bank after the exhibition, \\"in better condition than before\\", but later clarified that this did not mean the artifacts would be returned to the Palestinians after the exhibition.Morag M. Kersel p.38 The site is in Area C of the West Bank, under full Israeli control. The Israel Museum cited the Oslo Accords as giving Israel a right to perform archaeology in the territories and said they will return it to the West Bank when the exhibition has ended.Rudoren, Jodi. NY Times, 13 Feb 2013, Anger That a Herod Show Uses West Bank Objects In analyzing the controversy, Morag Kersel states that the site is regulated by Israeli military orders, the Jordanian Temporary Law no. 51, 1966, and the Oslo Accords. According to the provisions of the Oslo II Accord, archaeological issues of common interest would be handled by a joint Israel- Palestinian committee. Few if any of these agreements have been implemented, and Palestinians have not been consulted or asked to collaborate in the work at the site.Kersel p. 29 Films *Herod's Lost Tomb (2008; National Geographic Society), in addition to examining Netzer's purported find of Herod's tomb, the palace and most of Herod's other large projects are reconstructed in CGI. *\\"Finding Jesus: Faith, Fact, Forgery: Season 2, Episode 4: The tomb of Herod\\" (2017; CNN), the episode unpacks the epic story of the client king of Judea. *Jesus Christ Superstar (1973), the song \\"Then We Are Decided\\" was filmed here.

Early life M.J. Nurenberger was born in Krak√≥w but was raised in France and educated in Belgium where he began his career in journalism as a parliamentary reporter. He emigrated to the United States in February 1939, months before the outbreak of World War II. He was able to rescue his parents and 3 sisters from Europe before the war. They spent the war in England and Cuba and came to New York in 1945. While in New York City he was ordained a rabbi but decided to continue his career in journalism. He found a job with the conservative Morgen Journal (Jewish Morning Journal), a Yiddish daily published in New York, becoming its editor in 1947 and also wrote a column for the influential Yiddish weekly Algemeiner Journal. During World War II, Nurenberger was a war correspondent whose dispatches were carried by the Jewish press throughout the world. Following the war he covered the Nuremberg Trials and later also covered the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Israel. Canada In 1957, at the encouragement of Menachem Begin, Nurenberger moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, to become editor of the Yiddish weekly, Der Yiddishe Journal. Three years later, he and his wife Dorothy Cohn Nurenberger founded the Canadian Jewish News, an English-language weekly which became the leading newspaper of Canada's Jewish community. Following the death of his wife in 1971, Nurenberger sold the newspaper to a consortium of Jewish philanthropists supportive of the Canadian Jewish Congress. Nurenberger was a Revisionist Zionist, having become involved with the Irgun in the 1940s. He was later a supporter of Herut and a friend of its leader, Menachem Begin, and supported Begin and his movement editorially. He also advised Progressive Conservative Party leader John Diefenbaker on Jewish issues. Disappointed by the turn of the Canadian Jewish News under its new owners, he founded the Jewish Times in 1974 as an independent journal of news analysis, and published it until 1992, when he began suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Nurenberger's daughter, Atara Beck, worked as a journalist for the Jewish Tribune before moving to Israel in 2011. Nurenberger founded and edited the French-language Jewish monthly magazine Nouveau Monde, which was published and distributed in Montreal in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In 1972, Nurenberger appointed writer Victor Teboul as its editor-in-chief. The Scared and the Doomed He is the author of The Scared and the Doomed - The Jewish Establishment vs. The Six Million (), published in 1985, which challenges the American Jewish leadership during World War II, castigating Labour Zionist and American Jewish leaders for opposing Vladimir Jabotinsky's proposal that a Jewish army be mobilised and sent to Europe during World War II, and argues that European Jewry could have been saved.

Description The power rails are contained in a conduit midway between and below the two surface rails on which the cars operate, in much the same fashion as the cable for cable cars. The conduit contains two \\"T\\" section steel power rails of opposite polarity facing each other, about apart and about below the street surface. Power reached the car by means of an attachment, called a plough (US - plow), that rode in the conduit beneath the car. The plough had two metal shoes attached to springs that pushed sideways against the power rails. The plough was normally connected to a platform that could slide laterally to conform with variations in the placement of the conduit, for example in some areas there was a conduit for cable cars adjacent to the one for electric cars. The current was carried by a flexible cable from the plough through the platform to the car's controller and motor(s). The running rails are not part of the electrical circuit. In the United States, the cars were sometimes popularly but incorrectly called trolleys but did not typically draw power through a trolley pole from an overhead wire as (strictly defined) trolley cars do. Usage Horse power giving way to conduit power in New York Blackpool, on display at the National Tramway Museum Conduit current collection was one of the first ways of supplying power to trams but it proved to be much more expensive, complicated and trouble-prone than overhead wires. When electric street railways became ubiquitous, it was only used in those cities that did not permit overhead wires, including London, Paris, Berlin, Marseilles, Vienna, Budapest, and Prague in Europe, and the New York City borough of Manhattan and Washington, D.C. in the United States. In Denver, Colorado, the world's second electric street railway in 1885 pioneered conduit current collection. Difficulties with the conduit and the streetcars led to the replacement of conduit cars and lines with cable cars by 1888. New York City had the largest installation of conduit cars, due to the prohibition of overhead wires on Manhattan Island, although a few Bronx-based trolley lines entered the northern reaches of Manhattan using overhead wire. Trolley lines from Brooklyn and Queens also entered Manhattan under wire, but did not use city streets. The primary reason for the initial adoption of conduit systems was for aesthetic reasons as an alternative to overhead wiring that was often objected to as being unsightly. The expense of creating conduit lines in New York was reduced where it was possible to convert the cable vaults from discontinued cable car lines. The huge cost of building new conduits gave New York the distinction of having one of the last horsecar lines (the Bleecker Street Line) in the U.S., not closing until 1917. (Pittsburgh ran the last U.S. horsecar, in 1923.) In some old photographs, two \\"slots\\" may be seen between the rails. In New York City, sometimes one slot was used for a cable line and the other for electric cars. Occasionally, two competing lines shared a common track and had independent slots for the ploughs of the respective cars. In London, two slots were sometimes used on a single-track stretch in a narrow road so that cars in each direction used separate conduits. Known as twin- conduit track, examples were found in York Road, Wandsworth and London Street, Greenwich.Harley, Robert J. (2002). LCC Electric Tramways. Capital Transport, pp.179-81. In New York City, the Queensboro Bridge between Manhattan and Queens had tracks installed on the outer lanes with conduits for Manhattan cars in addition to overhead wires. The conduit allowed them to run to Queens Plaza terminus without need for removing the plough and raising the poles. In later years the conduit was removed and only trolley wire remained. In London, the London County Council Tramways experimented with side conduit, where the conduit was in one of the side rails. This was tried along Kingsland Road between Bentley Road and Basing Place, Hoxton, but the stresses and strains of the weight of the cars weakened the conduit, so it was not tried elsewhere. In the centre of Brussels some tram lines were fitted with conduits, the last ones being converted to overhead operation during World War II. The system was tried in the seaside resort of Blackpool, UK, but was soon abandoned as sand and saltwater entered the conduit and caused breakdowns and there was a problem with voltage drop. Some sections of track still had the conduit slot visible until the tramway was refurbished in 2012. Hybrid installations Washington, D.C. had a large network of conduit lines, to avoid wires. Some lines used overhead wires when they approached rural or suburban areas. The last such line ran to Cabin John, Maryland. The current collector \\"plow\\" was mounted underneath the car on a fitting just forward of the rear truck on PCC streetcars. It had two cables with female connectors on cables to attach to matching cables of the car's electrical system. A \\"plowman\\" was assigned at each changeover point from overhead trolley wire to conduit to remove the cable attachments to the car and stow the plow, which did not remain with the car and was reattached in an incoming car running on overhead wire. The lower section of the plow \\"board\\" was drawn by the moving car within the cavity of the conduit. Because of this usage, many of Washington's streetcars carried trolley poles, which were lowered while operating in the central part of the city; when the cars reached a point where they switched to overhead operation, they stopped over a plow pit where the conduit plows were detached and the trolley poles raised, the reverse operation taking place on inbound runs. The 'pit' here has the meaning analogous to racing circuit pits rather than a depression in the road. In the UK, London had a hybrid network of double-deck trams: overhead collection was used in the outer sections and conduit in the centre. At the changeover from conduit to overhead wire, at a change pit, the process was largely automatic. The conductor put the trolley pole onto the wire, and as the tram moved forward the conduit channel veered sideways to outside the running track, automatically ejecting the plough - the tram was said to be 'shooting the plough'. At the changeover from overhead wire to conduit the process was a little more complicated. The tram pulled up alongside a ploughman, who engaged a two-pronged plough fork over the plough in a short length of unelectrified conduit and into the plough channel underneath the centre of the tram. As the tram drew forward, the conduit channel moved under the tram, carrying the plough into position.The process illustrated The conductor pulled down the trolley pole and stowed it. The ploughman's job was a fairly skilled one because, if he failed to locate the plough fork correctly, it or the plough could jam in the plough channel and cause lengthy delays. Some tram designs required an extra carrier to be located with the plough and these frequently caused problems for ploughmen not used to the design (particularly if the tram had been diverted from its normal route). New conduit track was laid in 1951 for the Festival of Britain, which commemorated the Great Exhibition of 1851. The last tram was withdrawn in June 1952 and virtually all the tracks had been removed by the 1970s, although a short section can still be seen at the entrance to the former Kingsway Tramway Subway. Other European hybrid tramway networks included Paris, Nice, Lyon, Lille and Bordeaux in France; Berlin, Vienna and Budapest. In Paris, the conduit sections were frequently very short, requiring cars to change from overhead to conduit and back several times in one journey. The last conduit line in Paris closed in 1936, while the last Bordeaux conduit car ran in 1953. The conduit systems in Berlin, Vienna and Budapest were very short lived, being replaced by overhead wires before World War I.

In cooperation with Major General D. H. Hill's advance on Washington, North Carolina, Longstreet with divisions under Major Generals John Bell Hood and George Pickett besieged the Union garrison at Suffolk commanded by Brigadier General John J. Peck. The Union works were formidable and manned by 25,000 men, opposed to Longstreet's 20,000. On April 13, the Confederate troops pushed their left flank to the Nansemond River and constructed a battery on Hill's Point, which closed off the garrison to Union shipping. On April 14, Union gunboats attempted to run the batteries at the Norfleet House slightly upstream, but the was crippled. The Federals, at the same time, constructed batteries to command the Confederate works at Norfleet House.

Adoption into English as Christogram dates to c. 1900.) is a monogram or combination of letters that forms an abbreviation for the name of Jesus Christ, traditionally used as a religious symbol within the Christian Church. One of the oldest Christograms is the Chi-Rho (‚òß). It consists of the superimposed Greek letters chi and rho , which are the first two letters of Greek \\"Christ\\". It was displayed on the labarum military standard used by Constantine I in AD 312. The IX monogram ( ) is a similar form, using the initials of the name \\"Jesus (the) Christ\\", as is the ŒôŒó monogram ( ), using the first two letters of the name \\"JESUS\\" in uppercase. There were a very considerable number of variants of \\"Christograms\\" or monograms of Christ in use during the medieval period, with the boundary between specific monograms and mere scribal abbreviations somewhat fluid. The name Jesus, spelt \\"ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£\\" in Greek capitals, has the abbreviations IHS (also written JHS, IHC, or ŒôŒóŒ£), the name Christus , spelt \\"ŒßŒ°ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒüŒ£\\", has XP (and inflectional variants such as IX, XPO, XPS, XPI, XPM). In Eastern Christian tradition, the monogram ŒôœπŒßœπ (with Overline indicating scribal abbreviation) is used for in both Greek and Cyrillic tradition. A Middle Latin term for abbreviations of the name of Christ is chrisimus.Chrisimus (par les B√©n√©dictins de St. Maur, 1733‚Äì1736), in: du Cange, et al., Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis, ed. augm., Niort : L.

Chi (Œß)  In antiquity, the cross, i.e. the instrument of Christ's crucifixion (crux, stauros), was taken to be T-shaped, while the X-shape (\\"chiasmus\\") had different connotations. There has been scholarly speculation on the development of the Christian cross, the letter Chi used to abbreviate the name of Christ, and the various pre-Christian symbolism associated with the chiasmus interpreted in terms of \\"the mystery of the pre-existent Christ\\".. In Plato's Timaeus, it is explained that the two bands which form the \\"world soul\\" (anima mundi) cross each other like the letter chi, possibly referring to the ecliptic crossing the celestial equator.Plato. Timaeus, 8.36b and 8.36c: > \\"And thus the whole mixture out of which he cut these portions was all > exhausted by him. This entire compound divided lengthways into two parts, > which he joined to one another at the centre like the letter X, and bent > them into a circular form, connecting them with themselves and each other at > the point opposite to their original meeting-point; and, comprehending them > in a uniform revolution upon the same axis, he made the one the outer and > the other the inner circle.\\" > \\"The two great circles of the heavens, the equator and the ecliptic, which, > by intersecting each other form a sort of recumbent chi and about which the > whole dome of the starry heavens swings in a wondrous rhythm, became for the > Christian eye a heavenly cross.\\" . See also Grigg (1977:477) Justin Martyr in the 2nd century makes explicit reference to Plato's image in Timaeus in terms of a prefiguration of the Holy Cross.Justin. Apologia, 1.60. An early statement may be the phrase in Didache, \\"sign of extension in heaven\\" (sƒìmeion epektase≈çs en ouran≈çi). An alternative explanation of the intersecting celestial symbol has been advanced by George Latura, claiming that Plato's \\"visible god\\" in Timaeus is the intersection of the Milky Way and the Zodiacal Light, a rare apparition important to pagan beliefs. He said that Christian bishops reframed this as a Christian symbol.. The most commonly encountered Christogram in English-speaking countries in modern times is the Œß (or more accurately, the Greek letter chi), representing the first letter of the word Christ, in such abbreviations as Xmas (for \\"Christmas\\") and Xian or Xtian (for \\"Christian\\").  Chi Rho (ŒßŒ°)  File:Chrismon Sancti Ambrosii.jpgthumbA Chi Rho combined with Alpha and Omega, in 1669 labelled Chrismon Sancti Ambrosii, Milan Cathedral.The symbol was moved to storage for the refurbishments under Pellegrino Tibaldi and re-instated in the choir on 6 September 1669. (storiadimilano.it). Use of the name Chrismon is apparently based on the term crismon as used by Landulf of Milan (I.12). Landulf's mention of a crismon of Saint Ambrose clearly refers to chrism, i.e. holy oil, not a symbol. I. A. Ferrai, \\"I Fonti di Landolfo Seniore\\", Bullettino dell'Istituto storico italiano 14 (1895), p. 29. The Alpha and Omega symbols may at times accompany the Chi-Rho monogram.Allegory of the Church by Calvin Kendall 1998 page 137 Chrismon (chrismum; also chrismos, chrismus) since the 17th century has been used as a New Latin term for the Chi Rho monogram. Because the chrismon was used as a kind of \\"invocation\\" at the beginning of documents of the Merovingian period, the term also came to be used of the \\"cross-signatures\\" in early medieval charters.while in English literature of the 19th to mid 20th century, chrismon refers to the Chi Rho monogram exclusively, the German-language usage has also come to be adopted in some cases in the specific context of medieval sigla, especially in works translated from German into English, e.g. Hans Belting, Edmund Jephcott (trans.), Likeness and Presence: A History of the Image Before the Era of Art (1997), pp. 107-109.

IHS  In the Latin- speaking Christianity of medieval Western Europe (and so among Catholics and many Protestants today), the most common Christogram became \\"IHS\\" or \\"IHC\\", denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£, iota-eta- sigma, or .Christian sacrament and devotion by Servus Gieben 1997 page 18The Continuum encyclopedia of symbols by Udo Becker 2000 page 54 The Greek letter iota is represented by I, and the eta by H, while the Greek letter sigma is either in its lunate form, represented by C, or its final form, represented by S. Because the Latin-alphabet letters I and J were not systematically distinguished until the 17th century, \\"JHS\\" and \\"JHC\\" are equivalent to \\"IHS\\" and \\"IHC\\". \\"IHS\\" is sometimes interpreted as meaning \\"ŒôŒóŒ£ŒüŒ•Œ£ ŒóŒúŒïŒ§ŒïŒ°ŒüŒ£ Œ£Œ©Œ§ŒóŒ°\\" (Iƒìsous Hƒìmeteros S≈çtƒìr, \\"Jesus our Saviour\\") or in Latin \\"Jesus Hominum (or Hierosolymae) Salvator\\", (\\"Jesus, Saviour of men [or: of Jerusalem]\\" in Latin)Maere, Ren√©. \\"IHS.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia.

Such interpretations are known as backformed acronyms. Used in Latin since the seventh century, the first use of IHS in an English document dates from the fourteenth century, in the vision of William concerning Piers Plowman. In the 15th century, Saint Bernardino of Siena popularized the use of the three letters on the background of a blazing sun to displace both popular pagan symbols and seals of political factions like the Guelphs and Ghibellines in public spaces (see Feast of the Holy Name of Jesus). The IHS monogram with the H surmounted by a cross above three nails and surrounded by a Sun is the emblem of the Jesuits, according to tradition introduced by Ignatius of Loyola in 1541.

Natural history The pass is the division between the Simi Hills to the south and Santa Susana Mountains to the north, and forms the most critical wildlife corridor and habitat linkage between them. The scenery is made up of sandstone formations in massive outcroppings and numerous boulders, with California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion, with oak savannahs, chaparral shrub forest, and native bunchgrass plant communities in between. The perennial water sources provide diverse habitat for birds, mammals, and reptiles. History=Native American The Santa Susana Pass was at the juncture of the Native American Tongva-Fernande√±o, Chumash-Ventura√±o, and Tataviam-Fernande√±o tribal lands and was first crossed by their trail route, and used for an estimated 8,000 years.USA Today articleMercury News article Under Spain and Mexico The first Europeans to use the pass were members of the Spanish Portol√† expedition (1769‚Äì1770), the first European land entry and exploration of the present-day state of California. The expedition traversed the pass on January 15, 1770, heading east to a campground that later became part of Mission San Fernando Rey de Espa√±a. After secularization of the mission in 1834, San Fernando Valley rancheros used the trail. A rough wagon road evolved. Early statehood American newspapers in California first referred to the pass as Simi Pass from 1857 when the Los Angeles Star wrote of the capture of the outlaw Juan Flores there.Los Angeles Star, Number 39, 7 February 1857, p.2, col.4 That name continued in use, declining from the late 1880s until 1911 in the Eagle Rock Sentinel.Eagle Rock Sentinel, Number 17, 27 December 1911, p.1, col.1‚Äì3 It began to be referred to as Santa Susana Pass in the Los Angeles Herald 18 September 1887, being used with increasing frequency thereafter.Los Angeles Herald, Volume 27, Number 166, 18 September 1887, p.8,col.2Use of the terms Simi Pass and Santa Susana Pass from search of California newspaper articles on cdnc.ucr.edu, accessed April 22, 2017. In 1859, the California Legislature appropriated $15,000 (with additional funding provided by Los Angeles and Santa Barbara Counties) towards improving the old wagon road into a new stagecoach road, now known as the Old Santa Susana Stage Road.Old Stagecoach Trail at www.trails.comLink, Tom: Universal City ‚Äì North Hollywood, a Centenniel Portrait, Windsor Publications, 1991, , p. 25 The precipitous portion of the route down from the summit on the San Fernando Valley side was called the Devil's Slide; horses were usually blindfolded and chains were used to augment brakes on the steep descent. Passengers debarked and walked. The outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861 disrupted mail service along the Butterfield Overland Mail's southern stagecoach route from St. Louis, Missouri via El Paso, Fort Yuma and Los Angeles and on to San Francisco via the Tejon Pass, which had begun its run in 1858. To compensate, the government contracted the Butterfield Company to carry mail between Los Angeles and San Francisco via the new wagon road over the Santa Susana Pass. The first overland mail stage run through the pass took place on April 6, 1861. The main route climbs through what is now Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, with a branch in L.A. City Park 'Chatsworth Park South.' It was an important artery linking the Los Angeles Basin and inland Ventura County, and was part of the main route for travel by stagecoach between Los Angeles and San Francisco from 1861 until the opening of rail traffic between the cities in 1876. The Old Santa Susana Stage Road is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Part of the stage road is also a Historic- Cultural Monument of Ventura County and of the City of Los Angeles under the name 'Old Stagecoach Trail.' Late 19th and 20th century A new wagon route bypassing the deteriorating Devil's Slide was opened in 1895 to the north . Initially called El Camino Nuevo (the New Road), it was later named the Chatsworth Grade Road, which continued in use until Santa Susana Pass Road (now Old Santa Susana Pass Road) was built in 1917. This was the first automobile route between the San Fernando and Simi Valleys. It also was the main northbound 'coast road' to Santa Barbara and San Francisco, until the Conejo Grade in Ventura County between Conejo Valley and the Oxnard Plain on \\"Camino Real Viejo\\" (the Old Royal Road, now U.S. Route 101), was improved. In 1968 State Route 118, the \\"Simi Valley‚ÄìSan Fernando Valley Freeway\\" opened, north of the old auto road as the latest route across the Pass. In 1994 it was renamed the \\"Ronald Reagan Freeway\\". The pass area became famous from being seen in many movies, primarily Westerns, filmed from the 1920s to the 1950s here at the Spahn, Iverson, Bell Moving Picture, and Corriganville Movie Ranches. The area became infamous in the late 1960s with the Manson Family headquartered at the Spahn Ranch, near the top of the stage road's Devil's Slide. To the south of the old stage road is Sage Ranch Park and the Santa Susana Field Laboratory. Immediately to the north of Route 118 at the pass top is Rocky Peak Park, a part of the Rim of the Valley Trail Corridor. The old wagon road and rocky hill environs are part of the Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park, for public exploration.http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=611 California State Parks Dept. ‚Äì Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park. access date: 4/4/2010.http://www.lamountains.com/parks.asp?parkid=123 LAMountains.com ‚Äì Santa Susana Pass State Historic Park. access date: 4/4/2010.

The English name is derived from its shape, which resembles the hump and head of a kneeling camel. The mountain, a prominent landmark of the Phoenix metropolitan area, is located in the Camelback Mountain Echo Canyon Recreation Area between the Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix and the town of Paradise Valley. It is a popular recreation destination for hiking and rock climbing. History A cave discovered on the north side of Camelback Mountain indicates that it was used as a sacred site by the prehistoric Hohokam Culture before they abandoned the area in the 14th century. In January 1879, United States President Rutherford B. Hayes included Camelback Mountain as part of a one million acre (4,000 km2) reservation for the Salt River Pima and Maricopa American Indian tribes. Six months later, at the behest of Charles Poston, the Arizona Territorial Legislature reversed the decision in order to ensure the primacy of the 5000 non-Indian area residents as well as their continued access to Salt River water. Efforts to protect Camelback Mountain as a natural preserve began in the early 1910s. However, by the 1960s, nearly all of the area had been sold to private interests. Federal and state authorities attempted to stop development above the one thousand and six hundred feet level. They failed to halt development and in 1963 efforts to arrange a land exchange failed in the Arizona State legislature. In 1965, United States Senator Barry Goldwater took up the cause and helped to secure the higher elevations against development. The area became a Phoenix city park in 1968. The peak lends its name to a major east-west street in the Phoenix area called Camelback Road that starts in Scottsdale and goes about west past the West Valley suburbs of Goodyear and Litchfield Park. It starts again past the White Tanks. Camelback Mountain is designated as a Phoenix Point of Pride. Geology The mountain is composed of a geologic unconformity between two separate rock formations. The higher part of the peak is Precambrian granite (ca. 1.5 billion years old). The head of the camel is predominantly red sedimentary sandstone from the Chattian stage of the Oligocene epoch (ca. 25 million years old). Recreation Two hiking trails ascend to the peak of Camelback Mountain. The Echo Canyon Trail is 1.14 miles (1900 m) and the Cholla Trail is 1.4 mi (2300 m). Both trails are considered strenuous with steep grades. The hiking path has dirt, gravel, boulders, and some handrail-assisted sections. The average hike requires a round trip time of 1.5 to 3 hours. The Praying Monk is a red sandstone rock formation which is used for rock climbing. Located on the northern slope, the formation resembles the silhouette of a person kneeling in prayer. It rises approximately 100 feet (30 m) and the eastern face has several permanent anchor bolts for attaching a belay rope.

A few members are opportunistic pathogens, such as species of Pseudomonas, Moraxella, and Acinetobacter, which may cause pneumonia. Pseudomonas The bacterial genus Pseudomonas includes the opportunistic human pathogen P. aeruginosa, plant pathogenic bacteria, plant beneficial bacteria, ubiquitous soil bacteria with bioremediation capabilities and other species that cause spoilage of milk and dairy products. P. aeruginosa can cause chronic opportunistic infections that have become increasingly apparent in immunocompromised patients and the ageing population of industrialised societies. The genome sequences of several pseudomonads have become available in recent years and researchers are beginning to use the data to make new discoveries about this bacterium. Acinetobacter The genus Acinetobacter is a group of Gram-negative, nonmotile and nonfermentative bacteria belonging to the family Moraxellaceae. They are important soil organisms where they contribute to the mineralisation of, for example, aromatic compounds. Acinetobacter species are able to survive on various surfaces (both moist and dry) in the hospital environment, thereby being an important source of infection in debilitated patients. These bacteria are innately resistant to many classes of antibiotics. In addition, Acinetobacter is uniquely suited to exploitation for biotechnological purposes.

This paradox is directed at the then-mainstream strand of belief in a classical view of a sempiternal universe whereby its matter is postulated as everlasting and having always been recognisably the universe. Clausius's paradox is one of paradigm. It was necessary to amend the fundamental cosmic ideas meaning change of the paradigm. The paradox was solved when the paradigm was changed. The paradox was based upon the rigid mechanical point of view of the second law of thermodynamics postulated by Rudolf Clausius according to which heat can only be transferred from a warmer to a colder object, it notes: if the universe were eternal, as claimed classically, it should already be cold and isotropic (its objects the same temperature). Any hot object transfers heat to its cooler surroundings, until everything is at the same temperature. For two objects at the same temperature as much heat flows from one body as flows from the other, and the net effect is no change. If the universe were infinitely old, there must have been enough time for the stars to cool and warm their surroundings. Everywhere should therefore be at the same temperature and there should either be no stars, or everything should be as hot as stars. Since there are stars and colder objects the universe is not in thermal equilibrium so it cannot be infinitely old. The paradox does not arise in Big Bang nor modern steady state cosmology. In the former the universe is too young to have reached equilibrium; in the latter including the more nuanced quasi-steady state theory sufficient hydrogen is posited to have been replenished or regenerated continuously to allow constant average density. Star population depletion and reduction in temperature is slowed by the formation or coalescing of great stars which between certain masses and certain temperatures form supernovae remnant nebulae - such reincarnation postpones the heat death as does expansion of the universe.

Dating methodology  King Clone was identified and the age estimated by Frank Vasek, a professor at the University of California, Riverside. After Vasek hypothesized that the creosote ring was, in fact, one organism, Leonel da Silveira Lobo O'Reilly Sternberg (then a graduate student working in Vasek's lab), documented that plants within a ring had more similar characteristics, than those from other plant clusters. Vasek then used two methods to estimate the age of the ring. One method counted rings and measured the distance of annual growth, and the other used radiocarbon dating on pieces of wood found in the center of the ring, and measuring their distance from each other and the living bushes. The two dating methods yielded similar results (age about 11,700 years).

Established in 1906 as Myeongjin School (Î™ÖÏßÑÌïôÍµê; ÊòéÈÄ≤Â≠∏Ê†°) by Buddhist pioneers of the Association of Buddhism Research (Î∂àÍµêÏó∞Íµ¨Ìöå; ‰ΩõÊïéÁ°èÁ©∂ÊúÉ), the university gained full university status as Dongguk University in 1953. The university remains one of the few Buddhist- affiliated universities in the world, and is the member of International Association of Buddhist Universities. Situated on a hill near Namsan, the university's Seoul campus is in the urban Jung District of central Seoul. The university's symbol animal is an elephant, which stemmed from Queen MƒÅyƒÅ of Sakya's precognitive dream of a white elephant about the birth of The Buddha, and the symbol flower is a lotus blossom which reflects the Buddhist truth. Dongguk University Seoul campus is organised into 127 undergraduate and graduate schools, which enrolled 13,701 undergraduate students and 1,801 graduate students and granted 3,140 bachelor's, 470 master's and 172 doctorate degrees in 2017. Its comprehensive academic programme offers 53 undergraduate majors, together with 59 graduate programmes. The university also operates campuses in Peckham, Gyeongju, and Los Angeles, United States. The university operates two affiliated hospitals of Western medicine, and four of Oriental medicine, a generic term which includes traditional Korean medicine studies. History= Origins of Dongguk University Myeongjin Hall, the oldest building in Dongguk University The university began as Myeongjin School on May 8, 1906. Myeongjin School was established by the Association of Buddhism Research and took charge of Buddhism education. Later in 1910 Myeongjin School was renamed as Buddhist Normal School (Î∂àÍµêÏÇ¨Î≤îÌïôÍµê; ‰ΩõÊïéÂ∏´ÁØÑÂ≠∏Ê†°), and was renamed as Buddhist Higher Education Institution (Î∂àÍµêÍ≥†Îì±Í∞ïÏàô; ‰ΩõÊïéÈ´òÁ≠âË¨õÂ°æ) in 1914, and became Central Education Institution (Ï§ëÏïôÌïôÎ¶º; ‰∏≠Â§ÆÂ≠∏Êûó) in 1915. Central Education Institution was closed by the Japanese Occupation Government from 1922 to 1928, for the reason that the institution had led Samil Undong uprising. However, Buddhist temples all across colonial Korea donated 601,425 yen and established the Central Administrative Headquarters of the Joseon Buddhism Foundation (Ï°∞ÏÑ†Î∂àÍµêÏ§ëÏïôÍµêÎ¨¥Ïõê; ÊúùÈÆÆ‰ΩõÊïé‰∏≠Â§ÆÊïéÂãôÈô¢) in 1924, and the foundation of Buddhist Specialised School (Î∂àÍµêÏ†ÑÏàòÌïôÍµê; ‰ΩõÊïéÂ∞à‰øÆÂ≠∏Ê†°) was permitted in 1928. Buddhist Specialised School attained the status of Central Buddhist Professional School (Ï§ëÏïôÎ∂àÍµêÏ†ÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÍµê; ‰∏≠Â§Æ‰ΩõÊïéÂ∞àÈñÄÂ≠∏Ê†°) in 1930, and the Central Administrative Headquarters of the Joseon Buddhism Foundation changed its name to Jogye Academy Foundation in 1940, with also changing the school's name to Hyehwa Professional School (ÌòúÌôîÏ†ÑÎ¨∏ÌïôÍµê; ÊÉ†ÂåñÂ∞àÈñÄÂ≠∏Ê†°). On May 30, 1944, Hyehwa Professional School was again closed by Empire of Japan following the mobilization. After the World War II the school was reopened on October 27, 1945, and was expanded into Dongguk College (ÎèôÍµ≠ÎåÄÌïô; Êù±ÂúãÂ§ßÂ≠∏) on September 20, 1946.  Expansion  In 1951 after the Third Battle of Seoul, the college withdrew from Seoul, and provisional lectures were held in Jung District, Busan until the college got back to the original place September 1953 after the Korean War. Dongguk College was one of the first institutions in the South Korea to gain university status in the western sense, being designated the present-day Dongguk University in 1953. The postgraduate school opened simultaneously. From 1950s to 1980s, the university underwent a major vitalisation. Construction of Myeongjin Hall which is the oldest building in the university now began on March, 1956, and finished on December 30. In 1959, the Dongguk University Broadcasting system was initiated. The university took over Eunseok Elementary School in 1965, Heunguk Middle¬∑High School in 1966, and Keumsan Middle¬∑Commercial High school and Myeongseong Girls' Middle¬∑High School in 1967. The College of Education was launched in 1968 with four courses, adding Physical Education major a year later. The Graduate School of Public Administration was founded in 1967, and In 1978 the Gyeongju Campus was established and opened in 1979. Also during the 1960s students of the university participated in the democratic uprisings of South Korea, which caused deaths of students of the university. Students participated in the April Revolution against the autocratic government in 1960, and in 6¬∑3 Protest in opposition to the negotiation for the Treaty on Basic Relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea in 1964. In 1982, the university saw an academic overhaul which divided the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences into the College of the Arts and the College of Natural Science. In 1983, the university opened Gyeongju Oriental Medicine Hospital Attached to College of Korean Medicine, and opened Pohang Hospital and Dongguk University Medical Center in 1988. In 1989, the university opened Dongguk Oriental Medicine Hospital and opened Gyeongju Hospital Attached to College of Medicine in 1991. In 1997 the university made an agreement with Royal University of America, which was the educational institution located in Los Angeles.History of DULA On March 5, 2009, Royal University of America was merged into Dongguk University, finally becoming Dongguk University Los Angeles.  Modern era  In 2008, the university sued Yale University for 50 million dollars for a national scandal involved with then-assistant professor Shin Jeong-ah, which was called \\"Shingate\\". In July, 2007, when Dongguk university sent a registered letter to Yale University in order to check whether her doctorate degree is fake, Yale sent a reply that her degree is a forgery and she was never enrolled in Yale. Dongguk University asserted that when the university was hiring Shin Jeong-ah as an assistant professor of Graduate School of Culture & Arts on September, 2005, the university had received an answer from Yale that her doctorate degree is authentic. On July, 2007, Yale contended that the Dongguk University's claim is not true and Yale had not received any official letters from Dongguk University, but later it was revealed that Yale had received the registered letter from Dongguk University. On December 27, Dongguk University held a press conference and announced that Yale had admitted that Yale confirmed the authenticity of her degree and expressed regret about the case. On February 1, 2008, Yale forwarded an official letter of apology to Dongguk University under the name of Rick Levin, then-president of Yale. Dongguk University claimed that actions of Yale had damaged the university's reputation and sued Yale for 50 million dollars. Dongguk University said that it lost millions in contributions and the opportunity to build a new law school, but the lawsuit was finally concluded with Yale's innocence over the scandal. After the lawsuit, Yale sued Dongguk University for the cost of litigation, and on December 2, 2014, the Seoul Central District Court ordered Dongguk University to pay for 297 thousand dollars. Jeonggakwon, Korean Buddhist temple in Dongguk University In 2010, the university sought to take over Kyonggi University for the amount of around 150 billion won but provisional board of directors of Kyonggi University rejected the Dongguk University's bid. In 2012, Dongguk Business School was accredited by AACSB. In 2014, King Willem-Alexander and Queen M√°xima of the Netherlands visited the university during the state visit to South Korea and attended a seminar held by Jeonggakwon, Korean Buddhist temple in the university. Dongguk University celebrated the 111st anniversary of the foundation in 2017, and announced new motto of ÏßÄÌòú, ÏûêÎπÑ, Ï†ïÏßÑ (Êô∫ÊÖß, ÊÖàÊÇ≤, Á≤æÈÄ≤; Wisdom, Compassion, Endeavor) which replaced the previous motto, ÏÑ≠Ïã¨, Ïã†Ïã§, ÏûêÏï†, ÎèÑÏÑ∏ (ÊîùÂøÉ, ‰ø°ÂØ¶, ÊÖàÊÑõ, Â∫¶‰∏ñ; Steady one's clean mind, Behave truly and reliably, Love people with benevolence, Save mankind from agony).

Rankings and reputation Since its promotion to Dongguk University in 1946, Dongguk University has produced many graduates throughout the Korean society. In particular, graduates of the police administration department, which was established before the police college in 1962, occupied a large part of the police headquarters in various regions, and were also involved in the executive positions including the police chief. [5] In addition, in order to foster inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation personnel in preparation for reunification, and to nurture experts who have the ability to analyze inter-Korean relations, they established the North Korean Studies Department in Korea for the first time in 1994. [61] In 2012, the College of Business Administration received the international certification for business education from the International Business College Development Council for the tenth time in Korea. Dongguk University was ranked 11th in JoongAng Ilbo's Korean university rankings in 2014. Dongguk University was ranked 77th among the Asian universities in 2015 QS World University Rankings, and 82nd in 2018. Dongguk University was also ranked 656th among the world and 211st among the Asian universities in CWTS Leiden Ranking in 2017. Dongguk Business School has obtained international recognition by acquiring Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB) certificates, and the business school offers a dual degree MBA programme with University of Texas at Dallas. The university has international cooperations with nearly 160 universities of 40 nations, including Duke University, UCLA, University of Manchester, University of Oslo and Victoria University of Wellington, and attracts about 1,800 international students every year. Also, the university offers hybrid programmes with Swinburne University of Technology, University of Manitoba, University of Santo Tomas, Hindustan University and East China Normal University that combined the language education and area studies with the student exchange programme. Dongguk University also offers a dual degree programme with Stony Brook University. Notable alumni The police administration major in Dongguk University was founded in 1962, and alumni of Police administration major are spread out across South Korean police organisations, intelligence institutes, and judicial organisations including Korean National Police Agency. Also to prepare for the Korean reunification and to research North Korea‚ÄìSouth Korea relations, in 1994 the university installed the North Korean studies major for the first time in Korea. In 2017, a North Korean studies alumnus Suh Hoon was appointed as the 22nd director of the National Intelligence Service of South Korea. The Division of Theatre & Film and Media was established for the first time in South Korea in 1960m, One of the top and the best film school in Korea, and had many alumni in the field of South Korean film and K-pop industry.

Baker: The Encyclopedia of the Pharaohs: Volume I - Predynastic to the Twentieth Dynasty 3300‚Äì1069 BC, Stacey International, , 2008, p. 181 Khendjer possibly reigned for four to five years, archaeological attestations show that he was on the throne for at least three or four years three months and five days. Several absolute dates have been proposed for his reign, depending on the scholar: 1764‚Äî1759 BC as proposed by Ryholt and Baker, 1756‚Äî1751 BC as reported by Redford, and 1718‚Äî1712 BC as per Schneider.Thomas Schneider following Detlef Franke: Lexikon der Pharaonen Khendjer had a small pyramid built for himself in Saqqara and it is therefore likely that his capital was in Memphis.  Name  The name Khendjer is poorly attested in Egyptian.The name Khedjer for private individuals appears on only two monuments: Stela Marischal Museum, University of Aberdeen ABDUA 21642 and on stela Liverpool M13635, see Iain Ralston: The Stela of Ibi son of Iiqi in the Marischal Museum, University of Aberdeen, In Discovering Egypt from the Neva, The Egyptologcial Legacy of Oleg D Berlev, edited by S. Quirke, Berlin 2003, pp.107-110, pl. 6 and W. Grajetzki: Two Treasurers of the Late Middle Kingdom, Oxford 2001, p. 28, pl. 2. Both monuments date to around the time of king Khendjer and the individuals there might have called themselves after the king. Khendjer \\"has been interpreted as a foreign name hnzr and equated with the Semitic personal name h(n)zr, [for] \\"boar\\" according to the Danish Egyptologist Kim Ryholt.K.S.B. Ryholt: The Political Situation in Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, c.1800‚Äì1550 BC, Carsten Niebuhr Institute Publications, vol. 20. Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press, 1997 He notes that this identification is confirmed by the fact that the name h(n)zr is written as hzr in a variant spelling of this king's name on a seal from this king's reign.Ryholt, p.220 and footnote 763 Ryholt states that the word 'boar' is: : attested as huzƒ´ru in Akkadian, hinzƒ´r in Arabic, hazƒ´rƒÅ in Aramaic, hazƒ´r in Hebrew (the name is attested as hƒìzƒ´r in I Chron. 24:15, Neh. 10:20) hu-zi-ri in the Nuzi texts, hnzr in Ugarit, and perhaps hi-zi-ri in Amorite. Khendjer was, therefore, the earliest known Semitic king of a native Egyptian dynasty. Khendjer's prenomen or throne name, Userkare, translates as \\"The Soul of Re is Powerful.\\"Peter Clayton, Chronicle of the Pharaohs, Thames and Hudson Ltd, 2006 paperback, p.91 Khendjer, however, may have had a second prenomen at his coronation: 'Nimaatre' which translates as 'The one who belongs to Maat is Re.'Khendjer Titulary This name appears together with the name Khendjer at the top of the stela of Amenyseneb (Louvre C11).J√ºrgen von Beckerath: Untersuchungen zur politischen Geschichte der zweiten Zwischenzeit in √Ñgypten, Gl√ºckstadt 1964, 238 Chronological position and reign length Khendjer making offerings on the pyramidion from his pyramid. The pyramidion from Khendjer's pyramid. The exact chronological position of Khendjer in the Thirteenth Dynasty is not known for certain owing to uncertainties affecting earlier kings of the dynasty. Egyptologist Darrell Baker makes him the twenty-first king of the dynasty, Ryholt sees him as the twenty-second king and J√ºrgen von Beckerath places him as the seventeenth pharaoh of the dynasty. Furthermore, the identity of his predecessor is still debated: Baker and Ryholt believe it was Wegaf, but that pharaoh is confused with Khaankhre Sobekhotep, so that it is not known which one of the two founded the Thirteenth Dynasty and which one was Khendjer's predecessor. The highest attested date for Khendjer's reign is the fourth month of the season of the Inundation), day 15 in his fifth regnal year. Kim Ryholt notes that two dated control notes on stone blocks from his unfinished pyramid complex give him a minimum reign of 3 or 4 years 3 months and 5 days.Ryholt, p.193 The aforementioned control notes are dated to Year 1 I Akhet day 10 and Year 5 IV Akhet day 15 of his reign.Ryholt, pp.193-195 In these control notes, the names of three officials involved in building the pyramid are also identified. They are the chamberlain of the palace, Senebtyfy, the chamberlain Ameny and the chamberlain, Shebenu.Felix Arnold: The Control Notes and Team Marks, The South Cemeteries of Lisht, Volume II, New York 1990, , pp.176-183 The latter is also attested by other sources.  Pyramid  Khendjer is known primarily from his pyramid complex excavated by G. Jequier at Saqqara which was perhaps completed as a pyramidion was found.G. Jequier: Deux pyramides du Moyen Empire, Cairo 1933, S. 3-35 There was found a fragment of a canopic jar, which offers a partial name for his queen, Seneb ... \\"which may be restored as Sonb[henas].\\"Ryholt, op. cit., p.221 The object is Cairo JE 54498 Other objects with the name of the king are a stela from Abydos recording building projects by the king at the Osiris temple at Abydos, and naming the vizier Ankhu. Another stela once in Liverpool (destroyed in World War II), provides the name of the king's son \\"Khedjer\\". He might be a son of the king.W. Grajetzki: Two Treasurers of the Late Middle Kingdom, Oxford 2001, p. 28, pl. 2 Other objects with his name, according to the list provided by Ryholt, include three cylinder-seals from Athribis, a tile found near el-Lisht, scarab seals and an axe blade.

It is located at the foot of Mount Hermon, north of the Golan Heights. The spring is the source of the Banias River, one of the main tributaries of the Jordan River. Archaeologists uncovered a shrine dedicated to Pan and related deities, and the remains of an ancient city founded sometime after the conquest by Alexander the Great and inhabited until 1967; the ancient city was mentioned in the Gospels of Matthew and Mark by the name of Caesarea Philippi. The first mention of the ancient city during the Hellenistic period was in the context of the Battle of Panium, fought around 200‚Äì198 BCE, when the name of the region was given as the Panion. Later, Pliny called the city Paneas (). Both names were derived from that of Pan, the god of the wild and companion of the nymphs. The spring at Banias initially originated in a large cave carved out of a sheer cliff face which was gradually lined with a series of shrines. The temenos (sacred precinct) included in its final phase a temple placed at the mouth of the cave, courtyards for rituals, and niches for statues. It was constructed on an elevated, 80m long natural terrace along the cliff which towered over the north of the city. A four-line inscription at the base of one of the niches relates to Pan and Echo, the mountain nymph, and was dated to 87 BCE. The once very large spring gushed from the limestone cave, but an earthquake moved it to the foot of the natural terrace where it now seeps quietly from the bedrock, with a greatly reduced flow. From here the stream, called Nahal Hermon in Hebrew, flows towards what once were the malaria-infested Hula marshes. History=Semitic deity of the spring The pre-Hellenistic deity associated with the spring of Banias was variously called Ba'al-gad or Ba'al-hermon.Bromiley, 1995, p 569 Hellenism; association with Pan The major Hellenistic realms; the Ptolemaic kingdom (dark blue); the Seleucid empire (yellow); Macedon (green) and Epirus (pink). The orange areas were often in dispute after 281 BCE. Banias was certainly an ancient place of great sanctity, and when Hellenised religious influences began to overlay the region, the cult of its local numen gave place to the worship of Pan, to whom the cave was therefore dedicated.Kent, 1916, pp. 47-48 Paneas ()Stephanus of Byzantium, Ethnica, ¬ßP499.23 was first settled in the Hellenistic period following Alexander the Great's conquest of the east. The Ptolemaic kings built a cult centre there in the 3rd century BCE. Nabi Khadr. In the Hellenistic Period the spring was named Panias, for the Arcadian goat-footed god Pan. Pan was revered by the ancient Greeks as the god of isolated rural areas, music, goat herds, hunting, herding, of sexual and spiritual possession, and of victory in battle, since he was said to instill panic among the enemy.Philippe Bourgeaud, The Cult of Pan in Ancient Greece, tr. K.Atlass & J.Redfield, University of Chicago Press, Chicago and London 1988 The Latin equivalent for Paneas is Fanium. The spring lies close to the 'way of the sea' mentioned by Isaiah,Isaiah 9:1 along which many armies of Antiquity marched. In extant sections of the Greek historian Polybius's history of 'The Rise of the Roman Empire', a Battle of Panium is mentioned. This battle was fought in ca. 200‚Äì198 BCE between the armies of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Seleucids of Coele-Syria, led by Antiochus III.Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 18Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 19Perseus Digital Library. TUFTS University Polybius Book 16 para 20 Antiochus's victory cemented Seleucid control over Phoenicia, Galilee, Samaria, and Judea until the Maccabean revolt. It was these Seleucids who built a pagan temple dedicated to Pan at Paneas.Chambers Dictionary of Etymology: The Origins and Development of Over 25,000 English Words, Robert K. Barnhart, Sol Steinmetz (eds.)(1999) Chambers Harrap Publishers L, , p. 752 Roman and Byzantine Periods The remains of the palace of Philip II and/or Agrippa II Upon Zenodorus's death in 20 BC, the Panion (), including Paneas, was annexed to the Kingdom of Herod the Great, a client of the Roman Empire. Herod erected a temple of 'white marble' there in honour of his patron. In 3 BCE, Philip II (also known as Philip the Tetrarch) founded a city which became his administrative capital, known from Josephus and the Gospels of Matthew and Mark as Caesarea or Caesarea Philippi, to distinguish it from Caesarea Maritima and other cities named Caesarea (, ). On the death of Philip II in 34 CE his kingdom was briefly incorporated into the province of Syria, with the city given the autonomy to administer its own revenues, before reverting to his nephew, Herod Agrippa I. In 61 CE, king Agrippa II renamed the administrative capital Neronias in honour of the Roman emperor Nero, but this name was discarded several years later, in 68 CE.Madden, 1864, p. 114 Agrippa also carried out urban improvements. In 67 CE, during the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, Vespasian briefly visited Caesarea Philippi before advancing on Tiberias in Galilee.Sch√ºrer, Millar, Verm√®s, 1973, p. 494 With the death of Agrippa II around 92 CE came the end of Herodian rule, and the city returned to the province of Syria. In the late Roman and Byzantine periods the written sources name the city again as Paneas, or more seldomly as Caesarea Paneas. In 361, Emperor Julian the Apostate instigated a religious reformation of the Roman state,Norwich, 1988, pp. 88-92 in which he supported the restoration of Hellenic paganism as the state religion.Brown, 1971, p. 93. In Paneas this was achieved by replacing Christian symbols, though the change was short lived. In the 5th century, following the division of the Empire, the city was part of the Eastern (later Byzantine) Empire, but was lost to the Arab expansion of the 7th century. Arab dynasties of the Caliphate In 635, Paneas gained favourable terms of surrender from the Muslim army of Khalid ibn al-Walid after it had defeated Heraclius' forces. In 636, a second, newly formed Byzantine army advancing on Palestine used Paneas as a staging post on the way to confront the Muslim army at the final Battle of Yarmouk. The depopulation of Paneas after the Muslim conquest was rapid, as its traditional markets disappeared. Only 14 of the 173 Byzantine sites in the area show signs of habitation from this period. The Hellenised city thus fell into a precipitous decline. At the council of al-Jabiyah, when the administration of the new territory of the Umar Caliphate was established, Paneas remained the principal city of the district of al-Djawlan (the Djawlan) in the jund (military Province) of Dimashq (Damascus), due to its strategic military importance on the border with Jund al-Urdunn, which comprised the Galilee and territories east and north of it.Le Strange, 1890, p.39 Around 780 CE the nun Hugeburc visited Caesarea and reported that the town 'had' a church and a great many Christians, but her account does not clarify whether any of those Christians were still living in the town at the time of her visit. The transfer of the Abbasid Caliphate capital from Damascus to Baghdad inaugurated the flowering of the Islamic Golden Age at the expense of the provinces.Gregorian, 2003, pp. 26 - 38 With the decline of Abbasid power in the tenth century, Paneas found itself a provincial backwater in a slowly collapsing empire,Salibi, 1977, p. ?? as district governors began to exert greater autonomy and used their increasing power to make their positions hereditary.Applied History Research Group, University of Calgary, \\"The Islamic World to 1600\\" , Last accessed October 30, 2008 The control of Syria and Paneas passed to the Fatimids of Egypt. At the end of the 9th century Al-Ya'qubi reaffirms that Paneas was still the capital of al-Djawlan in the jund of Dimshq, although by then the town was known as Madƒ´nat al-Askat (city of the tribes) with its inhabitants being Qays, mostly of the Banu Murra with some Yamani families. Due to the Byzantine advances under Nicephorus Phocas and John Zimisces into the Abbasid empire, a wave of refugees fled south and augmented the population of Madƒ´nat al-Askat. The city was taken over by an extreme Shƒ´‚Äòah sect of the Bedouin QarƒÅmita in 968. In 970 the Fatimids again briefly took control, only to lose it again to the QarƒÅmita. The old population of Banias along with the new refugees formed a Sunni sufi ascetic community. In 975 the Fatimid al-'Aziz wrested control in an attempt to subdue the anti-Fatimid agitation of Mahammad b. Ahmad al-Nablusi and his followers and to extend Fatimid control into Syria. al-Nabulusi‚Äôs school of hadith was to survive in Banias under the tutelage of Arab scholars such as Ab√∫ Ishaq (Ibrahim b. Hatim) and al-Balluti. Crusader and Ayyubid period K≈≠l‚Äôat es-Subeibeh, near Banias, from the 1871-77 PEF Survey of Palestine The Crusaders' arrival in 1099 quickly split the mosaic of semi-independent cities of the Seljuk sultanate of Damascus. The Crusaders have held the town twice, between 1129‚Äì1132 and 1140‚Äì1164.Pringle, 2009, p. 30 From 1126‚Äì1129, the town was held by Assassins, and was turned over to the Franks following the purge of the sect from Damascus by Buri. In dispute until 1140, Banias was lost to Nur ad-Din in 1164. With the arrival of fresh troops to the Holy Land, King Baldwin III of Jerusalem broke the three- month-old truce of February 1157 by raiding the large flocks that the Turkmens had pastured in the area then known as Caesarea Philippi (Banias). In 1157, Banias became the principal centre of Humphrey II of Toron's fiefdom, along with his being the constable of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, after it had first been granted to the Knights Hospitaller by Baldwin III. The Knights Hospitaller, having fallen into an ambush, relinquished the fiefdom. Humphrey in turn was under attack in Banias and Baldwin III was able to break the siege, only to be ambushed at Jacob's Ford in June 1157. The fresh troops arriving from Antioch and Tripoli were able to relieve the besieged crusaders. The Lordship of Banias which was a sub-vassal within the Lordship of Beirut, was captured by N≈´r ad-Din on 18 November 1164. ªIzz al-Dƒ´n Ibn al-Athƒ´r (Translated 2006) The Chronicle of Ibn Al-Athƒ´r for the Crusading Period from Al-KƒÅmil Fƒ´ ºl-ta ºrƒ´kh: The Years AH 491-541/1097-1146, the Coming of the Franks And the Muslim Response translated by Donald Sidney Richards Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. pp 148-149 The Franks had built a castle at Hunin (Ch√¢teau Neuf) in 1107 to protect the trade route from Damascus to Tyre. After N≈´r ad- Din's ousting of Humphrey of Toron from Banias, Hunin was at the front line securing the border defences against the Muslim garrison at Banias.Murphy-O'Connor, 2008, p. 326 Ibn Jubayr, the geographer, traveller and poet from al-Andalus, described Banias: :This city is a frontier fortress of the Muslims. It is small, but has a castle, round which, under the walls flows a stream. This stream flows out from the town by one of the gates, and turns a mill ... The town has broad arable lands in the adjacent plain. Commanding the town is the fortress, still belonging to the Franks, called Hunin, which lies 3 leagues distant from Banias. The lands in the plain belong half to the Franks and half to the Muslims; and there is here the boundary called Hadd al Mukasimah-\\"the boundary of the dividing.\\" The Muslims and the Franks apportion the crops equally between them, and their cattle mingle freely without fear of any being stolen.‚Äù After the death of N≈´r ad-Din in May 1174, King Amalric I of Jerusalem led the crusader forces in a siege of Banias. The Governor of Damascus allied himself with the crusaders and released all his Frankish prisoners. With the death of Amalric I in July 1174, the crusader border became unstable. In 1177, King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem laid siege to Banias and again the crusader forces withdrew after receiving tribute from Samsan al- Din Ajuk, the Governor of Banias. In 1179, Saladin took personal control of the forces of Banias and created a protective screen across the Hula through Tell al-Qadi. In 1187 Saladin ordered his son al-Afdal to send an envoy to Count Raymond III of Tripoli requesting safe passage through his principality of Galilee and Tiberias. Raymond was obliged to grant the request under the terms of his treaty with Saladin. Al-Afdal's force of 7,000 horsemen left Banias and encountered a force of 150 Knights Templar led by Gerard de Ridefort, Grand Master of the Knights Templar. The Templar force was destroyed in the encounter. Saladin then besieged Tiberias, and after six days the town fell. On 4 July 1187 Saladin defeated the crusaders coming to relieve Tiberias at the Battle of Hattin.Hindley, 2004, p. 97 In the first decade of the thirteenth century Banias was partially destroyed by an earthquake.

Edwards and E A Park (1846) Bibliotheca Sacra and Theological Review Allen, Morrill, and Wardwell, p 193Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 347 ff, p. 358 In March 1219 Khutluba was forced to relinquish Banias and destroy its fortress. The city was then passed to al-'Adil and his son al-Mu'azzam. Banias along with Toron (now the modern town of Tebnine) and Safed were recovered by the Franks through treaty in 1229, just two years after al-Mu'azzam's death on November 11, 1227, by Frederick II from Sultan al-Kamil. Ottoman period The traveller J. S. Buckingham described Banias in 1825: \\"The present town is small, and meanly built, having no place of worship in it; and the inhabitants, who are about 500 in number, are Mohammedans and Metouali, governed by a Moslem Sheikh.Buckingham, 1825, p. 404 At Banias or Caesaria Philippi, 1891 In the 1870s, Banias was described as \\"a village, built of stone, containing about 350 Moslems, situated on a raised table-land at the bottom of the hills of Mount Hermon. The village is surrounded by gardens crowded with fruit-trees. The source of the Jordan is close by, and the water runs in little aqueducts into and under every part of the modern village.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, p. 95 French Mandate to contemporary The Syria-Lebanon-Palestine boundary was a product of the post-World War I Anglo-French partition of Ottoman Syria.Fromkin, 1989, p. ??MacMillan, 2001, pp 392-420 British forces had advanced to a position at Tel Hazor against Turkish troops in 1918 and wished to incorporate all the sources of the Jordan River within the British controlled Palestine. Due to the French inability to establish administrative control, the frontier between Syria and Palestine was fluid. Following the Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and the unratified and later annulled Treaty of S√®vres, stemming from the San Remo conference, the 1920 boundary extended the British controlled area to north of the Sykes Picot line, a straight line between the mid point of the Sea of Galilee and Nahariya. In 1920 the French managed to assert authority over the Arab nationalist movement and after the Battle of Maysalun, King Faisal was deposed.Shapira, 1999, pp. 98 - 110 The international boundary between Palestine and Syria was finally agreed by Great Britain and France in 1923 in conjunction with the Treaty of Lausanne, after Britain had been given a League of Nations mandate for Palestine in 1922.Exchange of Notes Constituting an Agreement respecting the boundary line between Syria and Palestine from the Mediterranean to El Hamm√©. Paris, March 7, 1923. Banyas (on the Quneitra/Tyre road) was within the French Mandate of Syria. The border was set 750 metres south of the spring.

When Syria was granted independence in April 1946, it refused to recognize the 1923 boundary agreed between Britain and France. Banias Waterfall Following the 1948 Arab Israeli War, the Banias spring remained in Syrian territory, while the Banias River flowed through the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) into Israel. In 1953, at one of a series of meetings to regularize administration of the DMZs, Syria offered to adjust the armistice lines, and cede to Israel's 70% of the DMZ, in exchange for a return to the pre 1946 International border in the Jordan basin area, with Banias water resources returning to Syrian sovereignty. On 26 April, the Israeli cabinet met to consider the Syrian suggestions, with head of Israel‚Äôs Water Planning Authority, Simha Blass, in attendance. Blass noted that while the land to be ceded to Syria was not suitable for cultivation, the Syrian map did not suit Israel‚Äôs water development plan. Blass explained that the movement of the International boundary in the area of Banias would affect Israel‚Äôs water rights. The Israeli cabinet rejected the Syrian proposals but decided to continue the negotiations by making changes to the accord and placing conditions on the Syrian proposals. The Israeli conditions took into account Blass‚Äôs position over water rights and Syria rejected the Israeli counter offer. In September 1953, Israel advanced plans for its National Water Carrier to help irrigate the coastal Sharon Plain and eventually the Negev desert by launching a diversion project on a nine-mile (14 km) channel midway between the Huleh Marshes and Lake Galilee (Lake Tiberias) in the central DMZ to be rapidly constructed. This prompted shelling from SyriaHolocaust and Redemption, Mati Alon, p. 321, Trafford Publishing, 2004: \\"When the diggiging for 'Hamovil Ha'Artzi' starred(sic), the Syrians started shelling and disrupting the work\\" and friction with the Eisenhower Administration; the diversion was moved to the southwest. The Banias was included in the Jordan Valley Unified Water Plan, which allocated Syria 20 million cubic metres annually from it. The plan was rejected by the Arab League. Instead, at the 2nd Arab summit conference in Cairo of January 1964 the League decided that Syria, Lebanon and Jordan would begin a water diversion project. Syria started the construction of canal to divert the flow of the Banias river away from Israel and along the slopes of the Golan toward the Yarmouk River. Lebanon was to construct a canal from the Hasbani River to Banias and complete the scheme The project was to divert 20 to 30 million cubic metres of water from the river Jordan tributaries to Syria and Jordan for the development of Syria and Jordan.Gammer, Kostiner, Shemesh, 2003, p. 165 The diversion plan for the Banias called for a 73 kilometre long canal to be dug 350 metres above sea level, that would link the Banias with the Yarmuk. The canal would carry the Banias‚Äôs fixed flow plus the overflow from the Hasbani (including water from the Sarid and Wazani). This led to military intervention from Israel, first with tank fire and then, as the Syrians shifted the works further eastward, with airstrikes. On June 10, 1967, the last day of the Six Day War, the Golani Brigade occupied the village of Banias. Eshkol's priority on the Syrian front was control of the water sources.Segev, 2007, p. 387 Misidentification as biblical Laish/Dan While Banias does not appear in the Old Testament, Philostorgius, Theodoret, Benjamin of Tudela and Samuel ben Samson all incorrectly identified it with Laish, now known to be located at Tell el-Qadi (Arabic) or Tel Dan (modern Hebrew). Provan, Long, Longman, 2003, pp. 181-183Saulcy, 1854, pp. 537-538 Eusebius of Caesarea accurately places Dan/Laish in the vicinity of Paneas at the fourth mile on the route to Tyre. Eusebius's identification was confirmed by E Robinson in 1838 and subsequently by archaeological excavations at Tel Dan and Caesarea Philippi.

It was built from 1714 to 1729, with funding from the 1711 Act of Parliament. Its name has been used for two forms of parish (areas of land) surrounding, one ecclesiastical which remains and one a Civil counterpart, a third tier of local government. The latter assisted public facilities in the late 19th century but ceded its dwindling purposes to the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney so was abolished in 1927. The church was designated a Grade I listed building in 1950. In the 1850s, Archibald Campbell Tait, then Bishop of London, appointed a Low Church lecturer, which was contrary to the High Church attitude of the rector and curate. As a protest, there were catcalls and horn blowing, and some male members of the congregation went into the church smoking their pipes, keeping their hats on, and leading barking dogs. Refuse was thrown onto the altar. The church was closed for a while in 1859, and the rector, owing to his poor health, was persuaded by the author Tom Hughes to hand over his duties to a locum. The church was hit by a bomb during the Second World War Blitz on London's docklands in May 1941. The original interior was destroyed by the fire, but the walls and distinctive \\"pepper-pot\\" towers stayed up. In 1964 a modern church interior was constructed inside the existing walls, and a new flat built under each corner tower. Ian Nairn wrote of it: ‚ÄúA ruin among ruins, in the lost part of Stepney [after the Blitz, and before being blitzed by the Borough Council?] ... The old life has gone ... the new has not yet come ... It makes no difference to Hawksmoor‚Äôs bizarre poetry. This is probably the hardest building to describe in London ... This is a stage somewhere beyond fantasy ... it is the more-than-real world of the drug addict‚Äôs dream.‚ÄùIan Nairn, Nairn‚Äôs London (Harmondsworth, Middlesex.: Penguin, 1966), pp.161-2 The church still has an active congregation. In May 2015, the parish entered into a partnership with the Centre for Theology and Community (CTC), an ecumenical charity which is based in its East Crypt. Anglican clergy working for CTC now serve the parish, and the second floor is the home to the Community of St George, a group of lay Christians who assist in the worship and mission of the church. St George-in-the-East is located on Cannon Street Road, between The Highway and Cable Street, in the East End of London. Behind the church lies St George's Gardens, the original graveyard, which was passed to Stepney Council to maintain as a public park in mid-Victorian times. In 1836, the parish of St George in the East was constituted as a Poor Law parish under the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834. It appeared in the 1980 film The Long Good Friday starring Bob Hoskins. It also appeared in S02E01 of Killing Eve.

In particular, content words containing fewer than three phonemes may be augmented with letters which are phonetically redundant, such as ebb, add, egg, inn, bee, awe, buy, owe, etc. Vivian Cook says of the rule, \\"People who are told about it are often surprised that they were previously unaware of something so obvious.\\" Origin Many content words would be homographs of common function words if not for the latter's \\"redundant\\" letters: e.g. be/bee, in/inn, I/eye, to/two.Jespersen 1961 ¬ß4.96 Otto Jespersen suggested the short spelling was a marker of reduced stress.Jespersen 1961 ¬ß3.134 Content words always have at least one stressed syllable, whereas function words are often completely unstressed; shorter spellings help to reflect this. (Interjections such as ah, eh, lo, yo are always stressed. Punctuation serves to isolate these elements.) The short word rule dates from the Early Modern English period. In Old English, inflections increased the length of most content words in any case. Through to the seventeenth century, before English spelling was firmly settled, short forms for some content words did occur, such as eg (egg), ey (eye), lo (low), etc. Conversely, poets alternated between short and long forms for function words, depending on whether they occurred on or off the meter.Jespersen 1961 ¬ß4.97 Some commentators have ascribed such a convention to John Milton,; although others suggest that it was unevenly implemented and clouded by intervention from the printer. Exceptions While many function words have more than two letters (and, she, were, therefore, etc.), the exceptions to the rule are rather two-letter content words. Only a few of these occur commonly in most texts: the words go (which also has a functional usage in the idiom going to do something), ox and, especially in American texts, ax. English grammar is relatively flexible about converting words of one class to another, allowing verbal uses such as to up the ante or nominal uses such as the ins and outs. The verb forms be, am, is and do can be considered exceptions when used as lexical verbs, which are content words, though not when used as auxiliary verbs, which are function words. Many recent loanwords retain spelling from the source language or are romanized according to non-English phonetic conventions. This has resulted in short words such as the notes of the solf√®ge scale (do, re, mi, etc.; from Latin via Italian) or the Greek alphabet (pi, nu, etc.) and miscellaneous others such as bo, qi, om, and ka.

It is on a route that connects Lhasa to India. The pass is about south of Nathu La and although it is higher, Jelep has been used for centuries by traders because of its less rugged terrain. The Menmecho Lake lies below the Jelep La. Jelep-la, a Tibetan name, means \\"The lovely level pass, so called because it is the easiest and most level of all the passes between Tibet and Sikkim.\\" On the Indian side there are two routes to Jelep La, one through Gangtok and the other through Kalimpong. The Kalimpong route is an ancient one which was responsible for the boost in the local economy due to the trading of wool and furs early last century. The pass was closed after the Sino-Indian War in 1962. It passes through the towns of Pedong in northern West Bengal, Rhenok, and Kupup. The route from Gangtok passes through the towns of Sherathang, nearby Changu lake and alongside Nathu La and through Kupup. The route is scenic with forests of rhododendrons blooming in spring. Numerous hamlets are scattered in the surrounding area. On the Tibetan side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau. History Jelep La was in use from early times as trade flourished between India and Tibet. After the appropriation of India by the British, the latter started to construct roads into Sikkim around 1884. This was viewed with some apprehension among the Tibetans and in 1886 a small Tibetan militia occupied the region around the pass. In May 1888, they attacked the British but were warded off by a British Expeditionary Force. Later in September the same year the British regained control of the area around the pass. With the growing Russian influence in Tibet, a British expedition was sent via Jelep La to Lhasa in 1904 led by Colonel Francis Younghusband. This expedition was met by hostile Tibetan forces which were defeated by the British. A trade agreement was then forced on the Tibetans in the absence of the 13th Dalai Lama, who had fled to Mongolia. In 1910, to escape a Chinese invasion, the 13th Dalai Lama \\"accompanied by six ministers and a small escort\\" which included his close aide, diplomat and military figure Tsarong Dzasa, fled via Jelep LaThe Thirteenth Dalai Lama, Thupten Gyatso , dalailama.com to Sikkim and Darjeeling, where they stayed almost two years. During this period he was invited to Calcutta by the Viceroy, Lord Minto, which helped restore relations with the British.Chapman (1940). After India's independence in 1947, Sikkim, which was then a monarchy, agreed to a special protectorate status and gave India the status of a suzerain nation and its defence and foreign affairs were managed by India. After the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950 and suppression of the Tibetan uprising in 1959, the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet before being closed by the Chinese. During the 1962 Sino- Indian War, there were border skirmishes between the Indian and Chinese armed forces in and around the passes of Jelep La and Nathu La - this was despite Sikkim still being a separate Kingdom at that stage. After the war the two passes were closed.http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2014-07-25/news/52026486_1_india- bhutan-tibet-trade-route-jelep-lahttp://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/will- india-and-china-fight-a-war-again_801878.html Sikkim became a part of India in early 1975 following a referendum.

The leading horses and riders of the school also periodically tour and perform worldwide. It is one of the \\"Big Four\\", the most prestigious classical riding academies in the world, alongside the Cadre Noir, the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art, and the Royal Andalusian School.Horse & Hound ‚Äì 7 Things You Need to Know about the Portuguese School of Equestrian Art Location Spanish Riding School Lipizzaners performing in the Winter Riding Hall. Lipizzaner horses returning to stables after a time of training. The stables are located next to the Spanish Riding School arena in Vienna, Austria, where the Lipizzaner stallions perform. The Spanish Riding School is located between Michaelerplatz and Josefsplatz inside the Hofburg in central Vienna. Performances take place in the Winter Riding School, built between 1729‚Äì1735. The Winter Riding School is a sunlight- flooded hall, mainly white with some beige and light grey, with a portrait of Emperor Charles VI above the royal box and opposite the entrance (to which the riders always salute before they ride), which measures and is in height. The Spanish Riding School also has summer stables in Heldenberg-Wetzdorf-Lower Austria. The 68 resident stallions are taken there in July and August for seven weeks, where they are kept in stalls with paddocks. The horses are not schooled during this period, but instead are hacked in the nearby forest.  History  Winter Riding School The riding school was first named during the Habsburg Monarchy in 1572, long before the French manege of Antoine de Pluvinel, and is the oldest of its kind in the world. Records show that a wooden riding arena was first commissioned in 1565, but it wasn't until 1729 that Emperor Charles VI commissioned the architect Joseph Emanuel Fischer von Erlach to build the white riding hall used today. Prior to that time, the School operated from a wooden arena at the Josefsplatz. For a time, the riding hall was used for various ceremonies, but it is now open to the public, who may witness the training and performances by the stallions. The Spanish Riding School was named for the Spanish horses that formed one of the bases of the Lipizzan breed, which is used exclusively at the school. Today the horses delivered to the Spanish Riding School are bred at the Piber Federal Stud located near the village of Piber in western Styria, Austria. One of the original studs used to develop the breed was Lipizza, now called Lipica, near Trieste in modern Slovenia, which gave its name to the breed. The Spanish Riding School has antecedents in military traditions dating as far back as Xenophon in Ancient Greece, and particularly from the military horsemanship of the post-medieval ages when knights attempted to retain their battlefield preeminence by shedding heavy armor and learning to maneuver quickly and with great complexity on a firearms-dominated battlefield. Traditionally, Lipizzaners at the school have been trained and ridden wholly by men, although the Spanish Riding School states that there has never been an official ban on women. In October 2008, two women, Sojourner Morrell, 18-year-old from the United Kingdom and Hannah Zeitlhofer, 21-year-old from Austria, passed the entrance exam and were accepted to train as riders at the school - the first women to do so in 436 years.  Methods  The methods used by the Riding School are based on Fran√ßois Robichon de la Gueriniere. It is a common myth that the movements were developed to aid in battle; in fact, they were used to strengthen the war horse's body and mind and make him a supreme athlete, not to actually attack. All movements are based on those naturally performed by the horse when at liberty, with the exception of one-tempi changes. The stallions are taught in three stages: # Remontenschule: (\\"forward riding\\") This stage begins when the horse is first brought to the Spanish Riding School as a 4-year-old. The stallion is taught to be saddled and bridled, and is started on the longe to teach him the aids, to improve his obedience, and to strengthen his muscles in preparation for a rider. Work on the longe includes transitions between the walk, trot, and canter, and changes of tempo within the gait, and lasts 2‚Äì3 months before a rider is ever placed on the animal's back. After longeing, the horse is ridden in an arena on straight lines, to teach him to respond correctly to the rider's aids while mounted. The main goals during this time are to develop free forward movement in the ordinary (not collected or extended) gaits, with correct contact and on a long rein, and to begin to cultivate straightness. Additionally, the training should have improved the animal's strength and stamina to prepare him for the next stage. # Campagneschule: (\\"campaign school\\") The horse is usually ready for the second stage after a year of riding in the first stage, although this time- frame is always adjusted to the individual horse. Young stallions are always placed with experienced riders during this second stage, to help prevent the development of bad habits due to incorrect work. During this time, he is taught collection, and is ridden in turns and circles at all gaits. The main purpose of this phase is to develop impulsion, improve the natural paces, promote self-carriage, make the horse supple and flexible, and gradually develop the muscles of the horse. The horse will learn to bend correctly in the neck, body, and at the poll as appropriate for his conformation. It is during this time that the majority of training takes place, and the horse learns to shorten and lengthen his gait and perform lateral movements, with most of the work taking place at the trot. This phase requires the most time of the three, generally two-thirds of the total time it takes to produce the \\"finished\\" horse. Before the end of this phase, the stallions are introduced to the double bridle, to refine the rider's aids. # Hohe Schule: (\\"high school\\" or Haute Ecole) In this stage, the rider will gradually push the horse to perfection in straightness, contact, suppleness, collection, and impulsion, to produce improved gaits. Through this work, the horse will learn to perform some of the most difficult movements such as pirouette, passage, piaffe and One-Tempi-Changes. Many of the exercises first taught in the Campaign school are utilized in this phase, focusing on the quality of the work and using them to help teach the more difficult exercises. The stallions are then assessed to determine if they are suitable for the demanding \\"airs above the ground,\\" the final step in their training. Once they are chosen, the horses are taught their most-suitable school jump, first on the ground and then under saddle. The riders, too, are carefully schooled. They first work on the longe without stirrups and reins on well-trained horses for up to 3 years, to teach a balanced and independent seat. They are then allowed to control the animals themselves, under the eye of an experienced rider, until they can perform the high school movements. With intensive training, this will take 2‚Äì4 years. The rider is then allowed to train a young stallion from unbroken up to High School, a process that usually takes 4‚Äì6 additional years.  Performances  Performances at the Spanish Riding School were originally only presented to guests of the Court, and then when they were finally opened to the general population at the turn of the century, it was only for special occasions. However, after the fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, the school opened up regular performances to the general public to help pay for its upkeep. The original performances were quite short, with the chief riders presenting stallions in the High School movements, airs above the ground, work in-hand and exercises on the long rein, and then a Pas de Deux (two horses in mirror image) and a four-rider Quadrille would finish the performance. The program today has expanded. It begins with the \\"Young Stallions\\" which have recently arrived from the stud farm at Piber. They demonstrate the first phase of training, in which the horse moves forward and accepts the aids. The next section is the \\"All Steps and Movements of the High School\\" where four fully trained stallions perform each of the movements seen in the Olympic Grand Prix Dressage test, including the flying change, passage, pirouette, and piaffe. The horses are ridden in double bridle, to demonstrate their high level of training. The \\"Pas De Deux\\" is then shown, with two horses demonstrating High School movements in mirror image. The next section is the \\"Work in Hand\\", to show how the horses are trained for the school jumps levade, capriole, and courbette, all in-hand. This demonstration includes work on the diagonal, on the wall and between the pillars. All stallions wear a snaffle bridle, cavesson, side reins, some on short hand rein, some with a short longe. All carry the traditional white saddle of the school. Then one stallion is then worked \\"On the Long Rein\\", in which a fully trained Lipizzan performs all the movements it would be asked to do under saddle. In this section, the horse wears a red snaffle bridle and a red shabrack (saddlecloth) with the golden coat of arms of the Austrian Empire. The \\"Airs Above the Ground\\" follows; all horses are under saddle, but the riders do not have stirrups. Movements performed include the levade, capriole and courbette. The performance finishes with the \\"School Quadrille\\", consisting of 8 riders working in formation at the walk, trot, and canter, with flying changes, pirouettes, the half pass and the passage. The ride is performed to classical music. Lasting 20 minutes, the School Quadrille of the Spanish Riding School is the longest and most difficult in the world.  Dress and equipment  A young stallion on the way from training to the stable All riders wear the traditional uniform: brown tailcoats, bicorne-style hats, white buckskin breeches, white suede gloves, and black top riding boots. Swan neck spurs are also part of the uniform. The empire style uniform (1795‚Äì1820 in fashion) has remained relatively unchanged for 200 years. During performances, the fully trained stallions wear a traditional gold-plated breastplate and crupper, called a Goldzeug. They also carry a \\"school saddle\\", which is made from buckskin and larger than the more commonly seen English saddle used by the school when training the stallions and riders. Gold-plated double bridles are only used for performances. All horses, except the young stallions, wear red and gold or green and gold shabracks, or saddlecloths, under the saddle. Red is for \\"All Steps and Movements of the High School\\", \\"Pas de Deux\\", \\"On the Long Rein\\", \\"The Grand Solo\\" and \\"The School quadrille.\\" Green is used for \\"Work In-Hand\\" and the \\"Airs above the Ground\\". The shabrack is also used to differentiate the status of each rider: the director of the school has three gold bands and gold fringe, the chief riders have three bands and no fringe, riders have two bands, and assistant riders have one. The young stallions are not exhibited in the same equipment as the more mature animals. They are ridden in a plain snaffle bridle and a simple dressage-style English saddle. For training sessions, black bridles, both snaffle bit bridles and double bridles, are used for all horses. Horses are clean and well groomed. The Capriole horses wear a braided tail wrapped short in a \\"queue\\" (known elsewhere as a \\"mud tail\\"), which is fixed with a decorative tail bag (Schweiftasche).

It connects the Indian state of Sikkim with China's Tibet Autonomous Region. The pass, at above mean sea level, forms a part of an offshoot of the ancient Tea Horse Road. Nathu means \\"listening ears\\" and La means \\"pass\\" in Tibetan. On the Indian side, the pass is east of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. Only citizens of India can visit the pass, and then only after obtaining a permit in Gangtok. Nathu La is one of the three open trading border posts between China and India; the others are Shipkila in Himachal Pradesh and Lipulekh (or Lipulech) at the trisection point of Uttarakhand‚ÄìIndia, Nepal and China. Sealed by India after the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Nathu La was re-opened in 2006 following numerous bilateral trade agreements. The opening of the pass shortens the travel distance to important Hindu and Buddhist pilgrimage sites in the region and was expected to bolster the economy of the region by playing a key role in the growing Sino-Indian trade. However, trade is limited to specific types of goods and to specific days of the week. Distant mountains of Bhutan, the Tibetan side, and international border fence as seen from the Indian side at Nathu La It is also one of the five officially agreed Border Personnel Meeting points between the Indian Army and the People's Liberation Army of China for regular consultations and interactions between the two armies to improve relations. History Nathu La is located on the Old Silk Route, an offshoot of the historic Silk Road. The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, Nepalese, and Bhutanese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Panoramic view of Nathu La Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903‚Äì1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet.Carrington, Michael: \\"Officers Gentlemen and Thieves: The Looting of Monasteries during the 1903/4 Younghusband Mission to Tibet\\", Modern Asian Studies 37, 1 (2003), pp. 81‚Äì109. Chinese and Indian soldiers at Nathu La In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La‚ÄìSikkim‚ÄìKolkata route. The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957. Later, on 1 September 1958, Nehru, his daughter Indira Gandhi, and Palden Thondup Namgyal (son of‚Äîand internal affairs adviser to‚ÄîTashi Namgyal, the Chogyal of Sikkim) used this pass to travel to nearby Bhutan. After the People's Republic of China took control of Tibet in 1950 and suppressed a Tibetan uprising in 1959, the passes into Sikkim became a conduit for refugees from Tibet. During the 1962 Sino-Indian War, Nathu La witnessed skirmishes between soldiers of the two countries. Shortly thereafter, the passage was sealed and remained closed for more than four decades. Between 7 and 13 September 1967, China's People's Liberation Army and the Indian Army had six-day \\"border skirmishes\\", including the exchange of heavy artillery fire. In 1975, Sikkim acceded to India and Nathu La became part of Indian territory. China, however, refused to acknowledge the accession at that time. Indian War Memorial at Nathu La Chinese Military Checkpost in Nathu La In 2003, with the thawing of Sino- Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China led to the resumption of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, after a decade of talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The reopening, which also signified the formal recognition of Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India by China, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. In the years before the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border. The opening of the pass was marked by a ceremony on the Indian side that was attended by officials from both countries. A delegation of 100 traders from India and 100 Tibetans crossed the border to respective trading towns. Despite heavy rain and chilly winds, the ceremony was marked by the attendance of many officials, locals, and international and local media. The barbed wire fence between India and China was replaced by a 10 m (30 ft) wide stone-walled passageway. It was also decided to mark the year 2006 as the year of Sino-Indian friendship. Geography A barren hillside near Nathu La The pass is east of Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim and from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet. In the winter, the pass is blocked by heavy snowfall. Because there is no meteorological centre in Nathu La, systematic measurements of meteorological data (such as temperature and rainfall) are not available for the region. However, it is known that in the higher reaches of the Himalayas around the region, summer temperature never exceeds 15 ¬∞C (59 ¬∞F). A small lake near Nathu La Nathu La has moderately shallow, excessively drained, coarse, and loamy soil on a steep slope (30‚Äì50%) with gravelly loamy surface, moderate erosion, and moderate stoniness. It has several sinking zones and parts of it are prone to landslides. To preserve the fragile environment of Nathu La on the Indian side, the government of India regulates the flow of tourists. Road maintenance is entrusted to Border Roads Organisation, a wing of the Indian Army. On the Chinese side the pass leads to the Chumbi Valley of the Tibetan Plateau. Flora and fauna Vegetation of the region Because of the steep elevation increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a wet and dry alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (Rhododendron anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs. There are no permanent human settlements in the region, though it has a large number of defence personnel who man the borders on both sides. A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or Dokpas herd yak, sheep and pashmina-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including Tibetan gazelle, snow leopard, Tibetan wolf, Tibetan snowcock, lammergeier, raven, golden eagle, and ruddy shelduck. Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak, nayan, kiang, and Tibetan wolf. The avifauna consists of various types of laughing thrushes, which live in shrubs and on the forest floor. The blue whistling-thrush, redstarts, and forktails are found near waterfalls and hill-streams. The mixed hunting species present in the region include warblers, tit-babblers, treecreepers, white-eyes, wrens, and rose finches. Raptors such as black eagle, black-winged kite and kestrels; and pheasants such as monals and blood pheasant are also found. Economy Indian and Chinese officers at Nathu La Up until 1962, before the pass was sealed, goods such as pens, watches, cereals, cotton cloth, edible oils, soaps, building materials, and dismantled scooters and four-wheelers were exported to Tibet through the pass on mule-back. Two hundred mules, each carrying about of load, were used to ferry goods from Gangtok to Lhasa, which used to take 20‚Äì25 days. Upon return, silk, raw wool, musk pods, medicinal plants, country liquor, precious stones, gold, and silverware were imported into India. Most of the trade in those days was carried out by the Marwari community, which owned 95% of the 200 authorised firms. Since July 2006, trading is open Mondays through Thursdays. Exports from India exempted from duty include agricultural implements, blankets, copper products, clothes, cycles, coffee, tea, barley, rice, wheat, flour, dry fruits, vegetables, vegetable oil, tobacco, snuff, spices, shoes, kerosene oil, stationery, utensils, milk processed products, canned food, dyes, and local herbs. Chinese exports to India exempted from duty include goat skin, sheep skin, wool, raw silk, yak tail, yak hair, china clay, borax, butter, common salt, horses, goats, and sheep. Restrictions are placed on traders, with permits only given to those who were Sikkimese citizens before the kingdom merged with India in 1975. Flowering rhododendron bushes near Nathu La, 1938 There were fears among some traders in India that Indian goods would find a limited outlet in Tibet, while China would have access to a ready market in Sikkim and West Bengal. The reopening of the pass was expected to stimulate the economy of the region and bolster Indo-Chinese trade, but this has not happened. Figures released by the Tibet Autonomous Regional Bureau of Commerce show that in the 51 days of trading in 2006, only US$186,250 worth of trade passed through Nathu La. Pilgrims from Tibet may be able to make a pilgrimage to the Rumtek monastery, one of Buddhism's holiest shrines On the Indian side, only citizens of India can visit the pass on Wednesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, after obtaining permits one day in advance in Gangtok. The pass is particularly useful for pilgrims visiting monasteries in Sikkim such as Rumtek, one of the holiest shrines in Buddhism. For Hindus, the pass reduces the journey time to Lake Manasarovar from fifteen days to two days. A major concern of the Indian government is the trafficking of wildlife products such as tiger and leopard skins and bones, bear gall bladders, otter pelts, and shahtoosh wool into India. The Indian government has undertaken a program to sensitise the police and other law enforcement agencies in the area. Most of such illicit trade currently takes place via Nepal. Transport On the Tibetan side two highways ‚Äî from Kangmar to Yadong and from Yadong to Nathu La ‚Äî were listed in the 2006 construction plans. Plans are also underway to extend the Qinghai- Tibet Railway to Yadong over the next decade. The nearest railheads are New Jalpaiguri (Siliguri) in India and Xigaz√™ in China. The Chinese government is planning to extend its rail service to Yadong, a few kilometers (miles) from Nathu La.Asia Times Online :: South Asia news, business and economy from India and Pakistan India had been planning an extension of rail services from Sevoke in Darjeeling district to Sikkim's capital Gangtok, from Nathu La.North Bengal-Sikkim Railway Link ‚Äì Railway Technology however the broad gauge line has been shortened to a 45 km extension to Rangpo, due for 2022 completion.

The western boundary of the park is Crawford Street, several hundred feet before Crawford intersects with Dundas St. West, the park juts toward Shaw Street, westside of the Crawford Street Bridge. Most of the park's area lies in the original Garrison Creek ravine and this creek, now a buried city storm sewer, still flows beneath the park from the northwest to the southeast corners. History Looking south towards the gates and Queen Street West in 1913 The old Garrison Creek emptied into Lake Ontario at the site of Fort York, and the land north and west of the fort was set aside as a military reserve. As the town of York grew around the fort, the military reserve was gradually sold off in lots to retiring British officers and friends of the military command. British Army Lieutenant-Colonel Samuel Smith is said to have bought of land here in 1801, which he called Gore Vale after Lieutenant Governor Francis Gore, the Vale in the name referring to Garrison Creek ravine. When the park was first created (after 1900) it was referred to as Bellwoods Park in the 1903 Goad's Map with a nearby street named Bellwoods Avenue.https://www.blogto.com/city/2011/08/what_trinity_bellwoods_park_used_to_look_like/ The Bellwoods name is believed to be associated to former alderman William Bell, whom served from 1881 to 1883 and again from 1888 to 1896.http://trinitybellwoods.org/wp- content/uploads/2012/03/BetweenBridgeBrewery_Harstone_2005.pdf Kivas Tully's Trinity College building, c. 1851 Much of the current park land was originally purchased from a Janet Cameron (sister of Duncan Cameron whom first lived here)http://www.lostrivers.ca/points/gorevalehouse.htm of Gore Vale in 1851 by Scottish-Canadian Bishop John Strachan, an influential Anglican deacon who wanted Toronto to have a private school with strong Anglican ties, partly in opposition to the recently secularized University of Toronto. Buildings were soon constructed (Gothic Revival structure by architect Kivas Tully) and students began attending Trinity College in 1852. After federation with the University of Toronto in 1904 and completion of the downtown Trinity campus in 1925, the school left this location. The original buildings were then sold to the City of Toronto and most were demolished in the early 1950s. The destruction of the Trinity buildings marked the beginning of two decades of extensive heritage destruction in Toronto. Of the college itself, only the stone and iron gates now remain, at the Queen Street park entrance facing south on Strachan Avenue, although the former St. Hilda's College building from 1899, (the women's residence of Trinity College) still overlooks the northern half of the park on the western edge. It is now a seniors' residence, John Gibson House. In the 1950s, Garrison Creek was entirely buried and the creek ravine backfilled around the Crawford Street Bridge, raising the surface of the northern end of the park to almost the height of Dundas Street. The steep drop from this upper level to the lower part of the park has become a popular local toboggan run in winter. The larger southern part of the 'bowl' is the largest designated dogs 'off leash' park. Picnic tables are also provided here for summertime use and public washroom facilities. There is a historical plaque the commemorates the bridge buried under this stretch of Crawford, just south of Dundas West. In 2001, the Friends of Trinity Bellwoods Park was formed to co-ordinate volunteer activities and provide input to the city on park management. It is made up of volunteer community members Features View of the park with the CN Tower in the background The park is . It has a community recreation centre, managed and owned by the City of Toronto, called Trinity CRC, located at 155 Crawford Street on the west side of the park. It has two indoor pools, gymnasium, fitness centre, indoor walking/running track and multi-purpose rooms. Adjacent to the centre, in the park, are a volleyball court, large playground, and children's outdoor wading pool. Also in the park are eight outdoor tennis courts located in the south- east corner and an outdoor ice skating rink at the north-east boundary and volleyball court just north of the Rec Centre. There is also field space for soccer, football, and rugby, as well as three softball fields along the east boundary. Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division maintain a marked Discovery Walk and shared pedestrian/cycling trail above and parallel to Garrison Creek, which runs through the park from the northwest to the southeast. Trinity Bellwoods is a favourite place for local residents to walk their dogs. The ravine, known as the dog bowl, is the designated leash-free area. Since around 2009 the park is a destination for many (young adults, families, hipsters) to hang, picnic, consume beverages and generally meet up in all sizes of groups. You'll see card playing, croquet, slacklining, bocci ball, pickle ball, board games, musicians. On a nice summer day the park can literally have about 4000 folk enjoying urban nature. The park is home to white squirrels, the subject of urban folklore in the city. The Toronto Special news magazine featured White Squirrel hunts in a past issue. The true albino squirrels have pink eyes. It is deemed good luck to have spotted one, or two. As there are families of them. The diverse variety of native and imported trees planted throughout the park, in various stages of growth from young to mature, provide a brilliant display of fall colour against the deep green grass. The Friends of Trinity Bellwoods Park run the volunteer Adopt-a- tree program (originated by the Friends) that helps insure the survival of newly planted trees. The emerald ash borer beetle is slowly infesting the trees and succession planting and Parks, Forestry and Recreation have been aggressively planting every year to replace the many that are designated to be cut down because of this beetle. In winter the night view of the Toronto skyline rising above the ravine is extraordinarily beautiful, especially looking east from the Discovery Walk pathway near the western boundary. Tall black Victorian-style iron lamp poles along the main paths provide safe but soft illumination and a charming touch of character. Events & Activities Trinity Bellwoods has been the site of many recent cultural events, including outdoor movie nights, an anarchist bookfair, live theatre, performance art, and informal summer drumming circles. In June 2007 a weekly farmers' market opened in the northwest corner of the park, at Shaw and Dundas. In the northwest corner of the park there is a small reminder of the diverse Latin American character of other nearby neighbourhoods: a bust of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var which was donated to the city. This is where the Trinity Bellwoods Farmers' Market is located. It was originally chosen as the site of the G20 protests on June 26‚Äì27, 2010, but Toronto Police announced that they would use the area north of Queen's Park instead after local residents opposed the use of Trinity Bellwoods Park as a protest site.  Queen West Art Crawl  Queen West Art Crawl is an annual art sale in September in and around Trinity Bellwoods Park. The alleys and laneways which surround Trinity Bellwoods park have become an impromptu art gallery open to the public for one weekend in September for the past four years. The event is dedicated to supporting artists in Toronto (particularly artists in Queen West).

Biography Mani Matter was born on 4 August 1936 in Herzogenbuchsee, Canton of Bern. His father, Erwin Matter, was an advocate, his mother, the Dutch woman Wilhelmina Matter-de Haan, was a secretary. He had a two years older sister, Helen Matter. Growing up in Bern, he started to perform his own chansons in contemporary Bernese German at local venues and on the radio; he accompanied himself on the guitar. He was an active Boy Scout in the Pfadicorps Patria in Bern and he performed his first own songs during Boy Scout evenings. He also performed together with the Berner Troubadours (Bernese troubadours). He was killed in a car accident on his way to a concert and is buried in the Bremgartenfriedhof in Bern. Mani Matter's literary estate is archived in the Swiss Literary Archives in Bern. Legacy His Bernese German songs remain very popular in the Swiss German speaking part of Switzerland, and Matter is a great influence on the dialect music scene in Bern, and his songs are frequently covered. A collection of cover-versions was published in 1992 on the album Matter Rock. Mani Matter's chansons are often taught at school (including classes for adults wanting to learn Bernese German) and are famous for their soft irony.

The Familia's principal leaders were Micha≈Ç Fryderyk Czartoryski, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, his brother August Aleksander Czartoryski, Voivode of Ruthenia (Rus), their sister Konstancja Czartoryska,Biogram zosta≈Ç opublikowany w latach 1982-1983 w XVII tomie Polskiego S≈Çownika Biograficznego. and their brother-in-law (from 1720), Stanis≈Çaw Poniatowski, Castellan of Krak√≥w. Formation Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski was Familia's candidate to the Polish throne in 1764 During the interregnum in 1733, the Familia supported Stanis≈Çaw I Leszczy≈Ñski for King. Polish Kings in the period were elected by ballot, by the nobility (Elective Monarchy). The Familia decided to support the Saxon Frederick Augustus II as candidate (elected King Augustus III - reign. 1734-1763 in Poland), instead, and thus became a party of the Royal Court. Following the failure of the Polish Sejm to pass reforms (between 1744 and 1750) the Familia distanced itself from the struggling Royal Court. In foreign affairs, they now represented a pro-Russian orientation (see \\"War of Polish Succession\\"). During the next Polish interregnum (1763-1764) near the end of the \\"Seven Years' War\\" in Europe, an armed Russian intervention in Poland gave the Familia the opportunity to vanquish their opponents at home. When in 1764 Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski declined to seek election to the throne, the Czartoryskis agreed to the election, instead, of their kinsman Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, a one-time lover of the Russian Empress Catherine II (\\"the Great\\"). Around the same time, the Familia succeeded in partially enacting their previous program of reforms. Among others, this included the creation of a Royal Treasury and military commissions who limited the power of Treasurers and Hetmans. The disruptive liberum veto was suspended. Further reforms were, however, blocked by Russian and Prussian interference. The conservative opponents of the Familia and the King, backed by Russia's Catherine II, formed, in 1767, the Radom Confederation. At the infamous Repnin Sejm, they were obliged to repeal part of the recently introduced reforms for fear of further unwanted intervention. Familia in the period of Partitions After the First Partition of Poland (February 17, 1772), the Familia became the core of magnate opposition to the King and the Permanent Council, while seeking support in Austria (only to shift in 1788 to a pro-Prussian stance). At the Four-Year Sejm (1788-1792), it was only in 1790 that Familia's representatives, which included Ignacy Potocki, effected a rapprochement with the King and his party. Together with him and the Patriotic Party the Familia now worked towards the enactment of Poland's revolutionary May 3rd Constitution in 1791.

He played as a back-row forward, usually a number eight. He played for Edinburgh for six seasons between 2000 and 2006 and in 2007 agreed a three-year deal with Stade Fran√ßais joining them immediately after the 2007 World Cup. In the summer of 2010, Taylor signed for Bath Rugby in the English Aviva Premiership. He also represented Scotland and the British and Irish Lions. At the start of his rugby career, he played for Heriot's Former Pupils. Career so far=Early career Taylor represented Scottish Schools in 1995‚Äì96 while he was at Morrison's Academy, and he went on to play for Scotland‚Äôs under-18, under-19, and under-21 teams. He had two seasons in the under-19 team, leading the Scots in the Junior World Championship in France in 1998. After five matches for the national under-21 side in 1998‚Äì1999 he went on to play in ten more under-21 internationals in 1999‚Äì2000, including the victory over the New Zealand Youth at Jedburgh in December and the draw with Australia during the 2000 Southern Hemisphere Alliance tournament in New Zealand. In that latter match Taylor scored a try. In 1999‚Äì2000 he played a pivotal role in Heriot's FP‚Äôs second successive club championship and was rewarded with a professional contract with Edinburgh Reivers at the beginning of season 2000‚Äì2001. 2000‚Äì2003 Taylor made his first appearance for Scotland in the November 2000 Autumn Test against the USA. In summer 2001 he made a try-scoring debut for the British & Irish Lions in their 116‚Äì10 victory over Western Australia before a knee injury unfortunately ended his tour and he returned to Scotland to pass the final exams of his law degree at the University of Edinburgh. He scored his first test try in the match against Canada on the 2002 tour in which he started at openside flanker and then made some pile-driving contributions when he was fielded at No 8 against the USA. He scored his first try in a Murrayfield Test match in Scotland‚Äôs 30‚Äì22 March 2003 win against Wales. He was named Lloyds TSB Man of the Match for his display against Italy in the 29‚Äì12 Scotland victory in February 2002. On 26 May 2002, Taylor was selected to play for the Barbarians against England. He scored twice, but England won 53 to 29. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games, Taylor was a member of the Scottish Sevens squad who won the Men's Bowl Competition Quarter Finals. Taylor was named The Famous Grouse Scotland Player of the Season for 2002‚Äì2003, fitting reward for performances encapsulated by his heroic defensive contribution to the game against England when he made 23 tackles. In the 2003 World Cup he started in every match. 2004 Taylor suffered a serious knee injury in the final game of the Six Nations in Ireland in 2004. 2005 Taylor was out for the best part of a year with a knee ligament injury and was unable to do any aerobic activity. He used the time to do some serious weight work and there is a general consensus that he is now about a stone and a half more than his official 17 stones. He returned for the Scotland v Italy Six Nations fixture and lasted the pace well enough for most of the game. He looked more like his old self in the following game vs. Wales on 13 March 2005. After the tournament, he became one of only three Scots named to the Lions for their 2005 tour to New Zealand. In New Zealand he injured a hamstring and did not play a match. 2007 Agreed a three-year deal with Stade Fran√ßais. Despite residing in France, Taylor, with business partner Barrie Brown, managed a successful foray into the licensed trade with 99 Hanover Street, a style bar in Edinburgh's city centre. 2008 With Taylor continuing his career in France the duo's new venture, Hawke and Hunter, opened in November 2008. Taylor and Brown trade as Brown Taylor Limited and Hawke & Hunter trades from the former Hallion Club on Edinburgh's Picardy Place. 2010 Having reportedly been unhappy with the number of players that play his position at Stade Fran√ßais, Taylor signed a three-year deal with Bath Rugby. On 19 April 2013 Bath Rugby announced that Taylor was to be one of 7 players leaving the club at the end of the 2012/13 season. At that point, Taylor retired from Rugby and entered the hotel industry.

The software has existed since at least mid-2003, with several different versions of the disc having been developed. Swap Magic and its related mods, such as the Magic Switch and Swap Tool, which are used to allow the user to swap discs without the system being aware, are notable over other methods (such as a modchip) due to the fact that they do not void the PS2's warranty.  Features  The Swap Magic disc allows the user to boot into software which allows the system to read discs that it would normally refuse because of the lack of a burst cutting area on discs that have been burned with an ordinary DVD drive, as opposed to regular retail discs which are stamped or pressed en masse. The user then removes the disc (after installing small modifications to prevent the system from detecting the drive being opened) and replaces it with another disc which can then be started. The software also allows other homebrew software to be run from a memory card or USB flash drive. Swap Magic and most other non-Sony-made PlayStation 2 bootable discs use a method of \\"growing\\" and \\"splicing\\" stampers from original PlayStation 2 discs, a method of growing a stamper from an original game disc and joining a new stamper with the program data on to it; in essence, the resulting discs contain a portion of an original disc. Datel, the first company outside Sony to make a bootable PlayStation 2 disc, researched the protection and produced their own discs with protection in their on-site mastering facility.  IFPI  The IFPI on a DVD can be found on the inner ring on the underside (data side) of the disc, before the start of data in the mirror part of the disc's hub. Most contain text specified at the time of mastering; this usually consists of the string \\"IFPI\\" followed by a code describing the mastering system used, then followed by a text product description, and finally a bar code.  Development  Swap Magic v1 was released and is compatible with the v12 slim PS2. Swap Magic v2 was released after Sony had slightly changed the design of their console in the v13-15 models of the slim PS2, and Swap Magic v1 did not work with those models. Version 2 was widely criticized as it required the user to open the console and, therefore, voided the warranty. The company responded to this criticism by releasing Swap Magic v3, which did not require any opening of the console.  CODER  Swap Magic v3.8 (also known as CODER) was released, which adds the ability of loading Action Replay cheats into the booted game. However, some users have complained that CODER has some compatibility issues as well as known bugs. For example, some games that work on v3.6 do not work with CODER. Consequently, v3.6 remains the most popular version of Swap Magic.

He also added back-up vocals in Acid Bath (1991‚Äì1997) and formed another band known as Shr√ºm (or simply SHRUM) (1995). Pitre formed Shr√ºm with the idea to have two bass players, himself and Joseph J. Fontenot, to create a heavy, low-end bass sound with Tomas Viator on electronic drums and Scott Leger on vocals. Shr√ºm's only album to date is Red Devils & Purple Ringers. In January 1997, Audie Pitre and his parents, Nora and Kermit, were killed when they were hit head-on by a drunk driver on the Bourg-Larose Highway in Louisiana. His brother, Kelly Pitre, was also in the car and survived the crash. The driver was convicted of three counts of vehicular homicide. Audie is survived by his son, Audie Layne, born July 1997. Acid Bath disbanded in 1997 after Pitre‚Äôs death. Shr√ºm biography Shr√ºm was created by Audie T. Pitre in 1995 when he got the idea of having a band with two bass players. He shared this idea with Tommy Viator and they began creating what was the beginning of Shr√ºm. They were undecided as to whom they would get to play the second bass position. They asked Joseph J. Fontenot, whom they knew from a band called Shredding Lettuce, if he would be interested in the concept of forming a band together with two bassists, a drummer, and a vocalist. He ended up joining the band subsequently. After this part of the line-up was established, the band still wanted a vocalist. Audie was a member of the Louisiana metal band Acid Bath; Acid Bath's singer Dax Riggs was the first one considered for the vocalist position of Shr√ºm. Dax went to one of the band's jam sessions and worked on a song that eventually became \\"Tears of a Marionette\\". However, Dax being in the band did not formulate. Scott Leger listened in on Shr√ºm's jam sessions. He said that he was a vocalist, but none of the band members had ever heard him. He was asked to try out for the vocalist position in Shr√ºm. For the first practice he came to, he was trying to mimic Dax, which was not what Shr√ºm was looking for. Audie then told Scott to be himself and sing with emotion. With that said, Scott Leger Jr. became the vocalist of Shr√ºm. Shr√ºm was on the verge of playing live shows, when Audie Pitre's life ended in an automobile accident, along with his parent's lives. Red Devils & Purple Ringers was released to raise money for Audie Layne, Audie Pitre's son. The tape eventually sold all copies. Shr√ºm completed its first show, an outdoor block party, with Kelly Pitre, Audie's younger brother, filling in on bass. Since then, Shr√ºm played a show at Zeppelins in New Orleans, Louisiana with Goatwhore. Afterwards, the band gave an interview to New South Metal Magazine. Currently, Shr√ºm is no longer together.

(born Jamal Michael Barrow; November 8, 1978), better known by the stage name Shyne, is a Belizean rapper. Barrow was born in Belize but moved to New York as a child to live with his mother and began his music career in the United States. He is perhaps best known for his 2000 singles \\"Bad Boyz\\" and \\"Bonnie & Shyne\\". He also wrote and performed on many multi platinum albums such as Usher's \\"Confessions\\", Lil Wayne's \\"Carter IV\\", Notorious B.I.G's \\"Born Again\\", Mase's \\"Double Up\\" and Puff Daddy's \\"Forever\\" among other top selling albums during his tenure with his former label Bad Boy Records and Def Jam Recordings. Shyne and his mother lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of East Flatbush, where he became a musician and rapper after being discovered in a barbershop by Imani Hayley. On the verge of releasing his debut album, he was involved in a nightclub shooting incident on , and in June 2001 he was convicted of assault and sentenced to 10 years in prison. His 2000 debut album was still a success and he continued to record music while incarcerated. While serving his prison sentence, Shyne became interested in Judaism, and later became observant, practicing Orthodox Judaism, officially changing his name to Moses Michael Levi Barrow in 2006. After being released from prison in 2009, he was deported to Belize. He has since been appointed the country's Ambassador of Music charged with the sustainable development of the music industry in Belize and has donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to develop it. Early life Shyne was born Jamal Michael Barrow on November 8, 1978, in Belize City to Frances Imeon Myvette and Dean Barrow, who were not married. Barrow divided his time between his mother in Brooklyn and his politician father, who was elected in 2008 as the Prime Minister of Belize, making him the first black leader of the country. Shyne's mother is the sister of Michael Myvett, now going by the surname Finnegan, one of Dean Barrow's long-time political colleagues in Belize. Barrow's middle name comes from his uncle. Barrow's mother moved to the United States when he was three years old, leaving her son with his father who was busy with politics which left him between the care of his mother's brother Michael and father's sister Denise in Belize City. When he was 8 years old, Barrow moved to Brooklyn to live with his mother in East Flatbush, while spending summers in Belize with his father. After he moved to New York, he began to develop a strong interest in the hip- hop culture of the 1980s and 1990s. Music career=1997-1999: Career beginnings and signing to Bad Boy In 1998, while Barrow was freestyling in a barbershop, he was discovered by hip hop producer DJ Clark Kent, who was working on The Notorious B.I.G.'s first posthumous album, Born Again. He quickly took Barrow to Bad Boy Studios, where Sean \\"Puff Daddy\\" Combs signed him on the spot. It was reported that Shyne received millions of dollars, 3 cars of his choice and 2 homes just for signing. The contract also included a 5 studio album deal. This event caused a small media shockwave. Not long after, Shyne began making appearances on recordings made by his Bad Boy Entertainment label-mates. He was notably featured on Mase's second album, Double Up (1999), and on a remix of Total's \\"Sittin At Home\\" single. In the same year he featured on chief executive Sean Combs' debut album Forever. 1999‚Äì2008: Shyne, prison, and Godfather Buried Alive On December 27, 1999, Shyne, along with Combs and his then girlfriend, Jennifer Lopez, were involved in a high-profile incident at a Manhattan club. Three people were injured. Shyne was charged with attempted murder, assault, and reckless endangerment. Shyne released Shyne (album) in September 2000. The album featured guest appearances from Barrington Levy and 112's Slim, as well as production from Bad Boy's in house producers The Hitmen. Shyne's self-titled debut album was recorded prior to the rapper's arrest. It made Billboards number five spot on the charts and sold more than 900,000 copies. In June 2001, Shyne was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Combs was acquitted of weapons charges in the case. While many labels met with Shyne while he was at the Clinton Correctional Facility, the rapper ultimately signed with Def Jam Records for a $3 million contract. In 2004, Shyne released his second album Godfather Buried Alive, while imprisoned. The album, recorded prior to imprisonment and partially over the phone, sold 434,000 copies and hit No. 1 on Billboards Top R&B;/Hip-Hop chart. 2009-present: Release from prison and third album Upon his early release in 2009 from his 10-year prison sentence, the Belize native was deported to his homeland as a non- citizen felon; he had never become a naturalized United States citizen. He was represented by Harvard professor and attorney Charles Ogletree in his attempt to forestall deportation and later to regain entry.Jayson Rodriguez, \\"Shyne Released, Deported To Belize\\", MTV, 29 October 2009; accessed 22 July 2016 On February 16, 2010, Shyne signed a seven-figure deal with Def Jam Records. \\"We are excited about working with Shyne, he's a revered Hip Hop Star and we want to give him the attention he deserves.\\" said Steven \\"Steve-O\\" Carless, national lifestyle director of Def Jam, in a call from his New York Office. After a trip to Jerusalem in 2010, where he converted to Orthodox Judaism, Shyne collaborated with Jewish American reggae and rock musician Matisyahu on his single \\"Messiah\\", released in April 2010.Krysten Hughes, \\"Shyne Slated To First Single 'Messiah' On Tuesday\\", HipHop DX, April 10, 2010.

Messiah was set to be the first of his 2010 release schedule, while Gangland, was set to be his second. In October 2010, Shyne criticized Def Jam and announced hopes of signing to Cash Money Records: \\"I'm definitely trying to get with Cash Money‚Ä¶.I'm not signed to Def Jam anyway, I just need to find another distributor. I might just have Cash Money do everything. Who knows? That's the beauty about being in the business for yourself. You can decide where you want to go and what you want to do.\\"Kevin S.

Reid for his frustration, later that month Shyne issued an apology.Nadeska Alexis, \\"Shyne Writes Apology Letter to L.A. Reid\\", The Boombox, October 28, 2010. In November 2010, Birdman said that Shyne's deportation had stalled his Cash Money deal, as it would prevent him from appearing in the US.Latifah Muhammad, \\"Birdman Says Shyne Deportation Is Stalling Cash Money Deal\\", The Boombox, November 1, 2010. In November 2010, Shyne was living in Jerusalem, where he underwent a formal conversion to Orthodox Judaism and arranged further studies with rabbis. He had studied seriously with rabbis while in prison and adopted the Jewish laws to create boundaries and order in his life. He officially changed his name to Moses Levi to reflect his commitment to Judaism. Shyne made a surprise guest appearance in the Matisyahu and HaDag Nachash concert in Jerusalem's Kikar Safra on June 23, 2011. He rapped into Matisyahu's set for \\"King Without a Crown\\". He shouted \\"Free Jonathan Pollard, Free Gilad Shalit\\" to thunderous applause before he exited the stage. Matisyahu and Shyne have shared Judaism and have become best friends. They have discussed collaborating more frequently in the future. In August 2011, Shyne appeared on the track \\"Outro\\", from Lil Wayne's platinum-selling ninth studio album Tha Carter IV (2011), along with Bun B, Nas and Busta Rhymes. In December 2011, Shyne said signing to Cash Money Records \\"is still a possibility\\".\\"Shyne Says Cash Money Signing Still Possible, Talks Lil Wayne's 'Outro' Appearance\\", xxlmag.com, December 16, 2011. In March 2012, Shyne and Diddy finally reconciled. The two were photographed together at Fashion Week in Paris; Diddy tweeted, \\"Me and Shyne Po front row at Kenzo #ParisIsBurning RT to da world!!!!\\" In April 2012, Shyne traveled to Kyiv, Ukraine, where he was a featured speaker at a conference on inter-religious understanding. The conference ‚Äì called Global Winds of Change: Religions' Role in Today's World;The Challenges in Democracies and Secular Societies ‚Äì brought together members of the world's many faiths to discuss the role of religion in modern society. Oleksandr Feldman, a member of the Ukrainian parliament and the President of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, hosted the three-day event. In October 2012, Shyne endorsed Mitt Romney for president of the United States, faulting incumbent President Obama for not doing anything to prevent the rapper's deportation to Belize.\\"Shyne Bashes Obama, Throws Support Behind Mitt Romney\\", rapfix.mtv.com; accessed October 13, 2012. In 2012, Shyne released a mixtape, Gangland. Shyne called out Rick Ross, due to his blasphemous Black Bar Mitzvah mixtape, as well as Jewish- Canadian rapper Drake. He has recorded diss tracks towards Diddy, Swag Blanket's DLSupreme and 50 Cent. In November 2012, Shyne became involved in a feud with West Coast rapper Game, after Shyne described West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar's universally acclaimed debut album good kid, m.A.A.d city as \\"trash\\". Shyne dissed Game on tracks such as \\"Bury Judas\\" and \\"Psalms 68 (Guns & Moses)\\". These tracks reflected his study of Judaism. Complex Magazine in December 2012 noted Shyne on its list of rapper stars who had suffered the \\"30 worst fall-offs in rap history\\", ranking him as 23. But Shyne's Gangland mixtape appeared to show a revival of his popularity; it was downloaded more than 100,000 times on DatPiff.com, earning him a \\"Gold\\" ranking. Personal life=Club New York shooting On December 27, 1999, Shyne and his Mentor/label boss, Sean Combs and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez, were involved in a shooting incident involving Matthew \\"Scar\\" Allen at a Manhattan club that resulted in three people being injured. Shyne, then 20 with an album pending release, was charged with and later convicted of attempted murder, assault, and reckless endangerment. Combs was arrested but acquitted at trial of charges. Shyne's debut album was released in 2000 and was successful. =Incarceration= On June 1, 2001, Shyne was sentenced to ten years in prison. He began serving his sentence at the maximum security prison Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. This seemed to spell the end of his rap career; his legal team's appeal for a suspended sentence ultimately failed. Shyne severed all ties with Sean Combs and Bad Boy Records. He had his name legally changed, in early March 2006, to Moses Michael Levi Barrow. He had been studying Judaism in prison with rabbis. Barrow has said that from the age of thirteen, he began to identify as an Israelite after learning that his great-grandmother was from Ethiopia. He has speculated that she may have been among the Beta Israel, ancient Ethiopian Jews. As a teenager, he began to pray daily and to study Judaism on his own.Dina Kraft, \\"Rapper Finds Order in Orthodox Judaism in Israel\\", New York Times, 10 November 2010; accessed 22 July 2016 He formally converted to Orthodox Judaism in Jerusalem in 2010. In 2006 Shyne went to court to challenge New York's application of the 'Son of Sam' law, which had resulted in his assets being frozen and limiting his ability to make record deals and income. He and his lawyers argued that allowing Shyne to make deals with record producers would enable him to pay a higher potential settlement to victims of the night club shooting, who were separately pursuing a civil suit against him. Despite his conviction for crimes, his incarceration drew many sympathizers, as well as the admiration of many in the hip hop community. His adherence to the code of silence, which he referred to several times on his eponymous debut album, earned him a hardcore reputation in the prison community and on the streets. Even while incarcerated, he was visited by representatives of record labels who wanted to make deals. Shyne was not without detractors. Fellow New York rapper 50 Cent called him a \\"punk\\" and made light of his situation and his part in the \\"night club incident.\\" Shyne retaliated on his 2004 release Godfather Buried Alive, with a track entitled \\"For the Record\\". Release and deportation On October 26 2009, Shyne was released from ICE to his place of birth, Belize. A Manhattan judge signed the order that would schedule Shyne for release on October 6, 2009. He had served more than 9 years of a 10-year sentence, on which no terms for post-release supervision had originally been placed. At the request of the New York State Department of Correctional Services, a mandatory probation period of at least two and half years was added to Shyne's sentence. Shyne and his attorney, Oscar Michelen, had hoped to avoid probation. The rapper was transferred to the Woodbourne Correctional Facility, where he spent the last months of his incarceration, from Rikers Island where he had been held for the parole hearing. Some of the hip hop community rallied to celebrate his release, and the events were followed by mainstream media. On October 6, 2009, Shyne was released from New York State custody. He was immediately taken into Federal custody. He was detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement at a \\"detention facility in Western New York State\\". At least one source revealed that the facility in question was the Buffalo Federal Detention Facility in Batavia. According to his attorney, Federal officials were reviewing the rapper's immigration status and making a determination on whether or not he would be deported to his native Belize. Shyne had a \\"green card\\" but had never become a naturalized citizen. There was speculation that Shyne might have been released on bail in the U.S. while his case was being resolved. Shyne's uncle, Michael Finnegan, said that the family had prepared for the rapper's potential return to Belize. He also revealed that Shyne and his representatives had been expecting to be intercepted by ICE officials upon his release and had deferred members of his legal team to prepare the necessary documents in an effort to deal with this situation. Dean Barrow, Belize's Prime Minister and Shyne's father, sent a petition to New York Governor David Paterson to pardon his son. In 2008 Governor Paterson had pardoned rapper Slick Rick who, in a similar situation, also faced deportation. Barrow stated he had been assured that the Governor received his letter and that his request was under consideration, but that he did not expect to have any influence in swaying the decision. The family said they had sought the assistance of Charles Ogletree, a Harvard Law professor and part of President Barack Obama's circle. On October 15, 2009, Finnegan released a statement indicating that all legal matters regarding the case had been turned over to Ogletree. Shyne was deported to Belize on October 28, 2009, though he continued to fight for residency in the United States. In February 2010, the rapper was refused entry into the United Kingdom due to his conviction as a felon. He had begun his journey in Cancun, Mexico, but was deported upon arrival in the UK after immigration officials refused to allow him to enter the country. In November 2010, Shyne was living in Jerusalem, having become observant and changing his name officially to Moses Michael Levi. He spent his time learning the Torah and stated that he spends up to 12 hours a day studying it. In 2011 he performed there, forming a collaboration with Matisyahu.Steven J. Hprpwitz, \\"Shyne Reveals Collaborations With Matisyahu, No Longer Cursing In Raps\\", HipHop DX, July 28, 2011. In December 2011, almost 12 years after the initial shooting, Matthew \\"Scar\\" Allen was shot and killed outside of Brooklyn's Footprints nightclub. Entry into Belizean politics Shyne has been nominated by the United Democratic Party to stand as a candidate for the Belize House of Representatives in the Belize City-based Mesopotamia constituency in the 2020 Belizean general election.

A film based on his novel directed by Dai was released in 2002. Plot summary The novel, written by Dai Sijie, is about two teenage boys during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, Luo, described as having \\"a genius for storytelling\\",Sijie, p. 19 and the unnamed narrator, \\"a fine musician\\".Sijie, p. 5 They are assigned to re-education through labor and are sent to a mountain called \\"Phoenix of the Sky\\" near Tibet to work in the coal mines and with the rice crop, because their doctor parents have been declared enemies of the state by the government. The two boys fall in love with the Little Seamstress, the daughter of the local tailor and \\"the region's reigning beauty\\". Residents of the small farming village are delighted by the stories the two teenagers retell from classic literature and movies that they have seen. They are even excused from work for a few days to see films at a nearby town and later retell the story to the townspeople, through a process known as \\"oral cinema\\". Luo and the narrator meet Four-Eyes, the son of a poet, who is also being re-educated. Although he is succeeding in re-education, he is also hiding a secret set of foreign novels that are forbidden by Chinese law. The boys convince Four-Eyes to let them borrow the book Ursule Mirou√´t by Honor√© de Balzac. After staying up all night reading the book, Luo gives the book to the narrator and leaves the village in order to tell the story to the Little Seamstress. Luo returns carrying leaves from a tree near where he and the Little Seamstress had sexual intercourse. The village headman, who has just had an unsuccessful dental surgery, threatens to arrest Luo and the narrator for harboring forbidden ideas from The Count of Monte Cristo if they don't agree to find a solution to the headman's dental problems. The pair find a solution and turn the drill \\"slowly... to punish him\\".Sijie, p.134 Later, the headman allows Luo to go home to look after his sick mother. While Luo is gone, the Little Seamstress finds out that she is pregnant, which she confides to the narrator. However, since the revolutionary society does not permit having children out of wedlock, and she and Luo are too young, the narrator must set up a secret abortion for her. Luo comes back to the village three months after this unexpected event. The Little Seamstress learns about the outside world by reading the foreign books with Luo's help. She eventually leaves the mountain and everything that she has known without saying goodbye, to start a new life in the city. Luo becomes inebriated and incinerates all of the foreign books \\"in [a] frenzy\\",Sijie, p. 178 ending the novel.

He possesses a suitcase full of forbidden \\"reactionary\\" Western novels that the Narrator and Luo covet and eventually steal. He is referred to as a character who is accustomed to humiliation. He ends up leaving the mountain when his mother convinces the government to end his re-education early and gets Four- Eyes a job at a newspaper. *The Miller is an old man who lives alone and is a repository of local folk songs. The Miller narrates one part of the novel and provides songs to the boys, who then relate them to Four-Eyes. He is one of the characters who chooses not to be involved with the revolution. *The Tailor, the father of the Little Seamstress and the only tailor on the mountain, is a rich and popular man. He is old but energetic and widely travelled. At one point in the story, the narrator recounts The Count of Monte Cristo to him while he spends the night with the narrator and Luo. Through this experience, he gains a slight air of sophistication, and the story begins to influence the clothes that he makes. *The Gynaecologist, a man around forty, with \\"grizzled lanky hair [and] sharp features,\\"Sijie, p. 164 performs the Little Seamstress's illegal abortion in return for a book by Balzac, but ends up getting two books, Ursule Mirouet and Jean Christophe, due to the main character's generosity.  Major themes = Power of education and literature  Critics have noted that the novel deals with the strength of education and literature. Jeff Zaleski of Publishers Weekly said that the novel \\"emphasize[s] the power of literature to free the mind.\\" A book review by Brooke Allen in The New York Times addresses the themes, such as the \\"potency of imaginative literature and why it is hated and feared by those who wish to control others.\\" This reviewer addresses the evil and ultimate failure of \\"any system that fears knowledge and education... and closes the mind to moral and intellectual truth\\" as well.  Friendship and lost innocence  The major themes of Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress include friendship and lost innocence.  Double edged Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress addresses issues such as how everything appears to have a double-edge.

Style  Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is notable for its size. Publishers Weekly stated that Balzac was a \\"slim first novel\\", and Brooke Allen at The New York Times Book Review called the narrative \\"streamlined\\". Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is written in a characteristic style. The novel focuses and \\"accents on a soft center rather than... hard edges\\", according to Josh Greenfield of Time Europe. A vast majority of the characters in the narrative have \\"epithets rather than names\\", adding to the relaxed writing style of the novel.  Background = Cultural Revolution  Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress is set during the time known as the Cultural Revolution in China. This historical event helped to supply the framework for many of the conflicts faced in the novel. The Revolution of Chairman Mao Zedong \\"began in 1966 and continued until the dictator's death ten years later\\". The Cultural Revolution in China was \\"intended to stamp out the educated class and . . . old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits\\". In order to do this, \\"hundreds of thousands of Chinese intellectuals [were sent] to peasant villages for re- education\\", and within the years of \\"1968-1975, some twelve million youths were 'rusticated'.\\"  Dai Sijie's past  Dai Sijie's own experiences during this time period helped to produce the novel. Dai himself was re- educated, and \\"spent the years between 1971 and 1974 in the mountains of Sichuan Province\\". He emigrated to France in 1984.  Publication history  Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress has been translated from the original French. The novel was first published in France in the French language\\" in 2000, and since then, rights of the book have been sold in nineteen countries. However, the novel has not been translated to Chinese because of statements that Dai has \\"blackened the characters of the peasants and treated them like idiots\\", and that the changes that the characters go through should be \\"the result of reading a Chinese book\\". The English translation of Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress by Ina Rilke is published by the company Knopf and has been praised for its clarity.\\"  Reception  The book received reviews related to \\"warmth and humor.\\" It has been stated as well that the novel \\"abound[s] in gentle humor, warm bonhomie and appealing charm\\" in Time Europe. The novel has likewise been seen as an emotional tale. Jeff Zaleski has reviewed Balzac as a \\"moving, [and] often wrenching short novel\\". Dai Sijie has been praised as a \\"captivating, amazing, storyteller\\" whose writing here is \\"seductive and unaffected\\". In a San Jose Mercury News article, the novel is described as one that will resonate with the reader. Topics covered in the book‚Äìto do with the Cultural Revolution‚Äìhave been elaborated on and reviewed. Dai Sijie, as \\"an entertaining recorder of China's 'ten lost years',\\" addresses the Cultural Revolution. It is seen by some as \\"a wonderfully human tale\\" and relatable. The ending of the novel has received some positive attention. The ending has a \\"smart surprising bite\\" says a Library Journal article. In Publishers Weekly, the conclusion is described as \\"unexpected, droll, and poignant\\". The story itself is seen as unprecedented, \\"not another grim... tale of forced labor.\\" Also popular, it has been described as a \\"cult novel.\\" and was a bestseller in France in the year 2000.\\" However, there have been negative reviews. Brooke Allen of The New York Times Book Review states that the novel is \\"worthwhile, but unsatisfactory\\" and that the epithets for most of the characters \\"work against the material's power.\\" In addition, the novel has received complaints from Chinese government officials in its portrayal of the Cultural Revolution.  Awards and nominations  The book is the winner of several literary awards. The novel won five French literary prizes. and was a best seller in 2000.\\"  Adaptations  Dai Sijie directed and adapted his novel into a film, released in 2003, starring Zhou Xun, Liu Ye and Chen Kun.

Nathaniel Dett and Nathaniel Dett, was a Canadian-American Black composer, organist, pianist, choral director, and music professor. Born and raised in Canada until the age of 11, he moved to the United States with his family and had most of his professional education and career there. During his lifetime he was a leading Black composer, known for his use of African-American folk songs and spirituals as the basis for choral and piano compositions in the 19th century Romantic style of Classical music.Canadian Musical Works 1900-1980, a bibliography of general and analytical sources. Ottawa: Canadian Association of Music Libraries, 1983 (). He was among the first Black composers during the early years after the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) was organized. His works often appeared among the programs of Will Marion Cook's New York Syncopated Orchestra. Dett performed at Carnegie Hall and at the Boston Symphony Hall as a pianist and choir director.Elaine Keillor, Music in Canada, capturing landscape and diversity, Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press. 1939 (). Early life Dett was born in 1882 in Drummondville, Ontario (now part of Niagara Falls, Ontario), to Charlotte (Washington) Dett and Robert T. Dett; his mother was a native of Drummondville and his father was from the United States. The young Dett studied piano at an early age, showing initial interest when he was three years old and starting piano lessons at the age of five. When he was a child, his mother encouraged him to memorize passages of Shakespeare, Longfellow and Tennyson. In 1893, the family moved over the border to Niagara Falls, New York. At about age 14, Dett played piano for his local church. He studied at the Oliver Willis Halstead Conservatory of Music from 1901 to 1903.Eileen Southern, The Music of Black Americans: A History, W. W. Norton & Company; 3rd edition, 1997 (). He continued his piano studies at the Lockport Conservatory, matriculating to the Oberlin Conservatory of Music in Ohio. It was at Oberlin when he was first introduced to the idea of using spirituals in classical music. He heard the music of Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k, a Czech composer who had toured the United States and incorporated elements of American music in his own work, including the New World Symphony. Some of the music reminded Dett of the spirituals he had learned from his grandmother. He was the first black student to complete the five-year course at Oberlin. Dett toured as a concert pianist and during this period wrote only rudimentary piano compositions. He came under the influence of Emma Azalia Hackley, a soprano singer, who inspired his interest in black American folk music. In 1907, Dett completed his first degree, a Bachelor of Music with a major in composition and piano. Career After graduation, Dett started teaching at Tennessee's Lane College, followed by a tenure at the Lincoln Institute in Jefferson City, Missouri. During this period, he wrote practical choral and piano pieces suitable for his students. The 1913 piece In the Bottoms contains one of his most played movements, \\"Dance Juba\\". Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler performed the work at the Chicago Music Hall. Soon after this Dett became the first black director of music at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he maintained the position from 1913 to 1932. During this near twenty-year period, he founded the Hampton Choral Union, Musical Arts Society, Hampton Institute Choir and its School of Music. He encouraged his Hampton student, soprano Dorothy Maynor, to pursue a career as a concert artist; she followed his advice to become one of the leading concert artists in the nation.Zick, William J. \\"Robert Nathaniel Dett: African American composer, pianist & choral director\\". Retrieved January 2, 2005. Dett as shown in a Library and Archives Canada photo His position as a major pianist-composer was earned in 1914. His piece Magnolia was performed at the Samuel Coleridge-Taylor Club. On June 3 that year he performed Magnolia and In the Bottoms. The Chicago Evening Post reported that among the works on the \\"All Colored\\" program, his works were the most innovative, and it praised his high level of piano skills. On December 27, 1916, Dett married Helen Elise Smith. She was the first black graduate of the Institute of Musical Art in New York City, which became known as the Juilliard School of performing arts. In 1918, Dett wrote of his compositional goals: > We have this wonderful store of folk music‚Äîthe melodies of an enslaved > people ... But this store will be of no value unless we utilize it, unless > we treat it in such manner that it can be presented in choral form, in lyric > and operatic works, in concertos and suites and salon music‚Äîunless our > musical architects take the rough timber of Negro themes and fashion from it > music which will prove that we, too, have national feelings and > characteristics, as have the European peoples whose forms we have zealously > followed for so long.Southern, p. 280.Canadian Music Catalogues and > Acquisitions lists. Toronto, 1971- Various lists of Canadian music > (orchestral, vocal, chamber, choral) Throughout his lifetime, Dett continued to study music. Each summer, he attended major national institutions. From 1920 to 1921, he attended Harvard University, where he studied with Arthur Foote, winning two prizes. Don't Be Weary Traveller, a choral composition, won the Francis Boott Award, while his essay \\"The Emancipation of Negro Music\\" won the Bowdoin prize. His interest in composition had to accommodate his demands of teaching and administration. Percy Grainger recorded the \\"Juba\\" from In the Bottoms during Dett's year at Harvard. Dett also composed collections of spirituals, which he had arranged, including Religious Folksongs of the Negro (1927) and The Dett Collections of Negro Spirituals (1936). Dett received a Holstein prize for his contributions as a composer. From 1924 to 1926, Dett served as president of The National Association of Negro Musicians. Founded in Chicago in 1919, the association is the United States' oldest organization dedicated to the preservation, encouragement, and advocacy of all genres of African-American music. In 1929, Dett travelled to France to study at the Fontainebleau school of music with composer Nadia Boulanger. He earned a Masters of Music degree at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester in 1932. In 1933, after resigning from the Hampton Institute, Dett served as the choral conductor for Stromberg-Carlson's NBC radio broadcasts. He wrote the oratorio The Ordering of Moses (1937). It was conducted by Eugene Goosens in its premiere on May 7, 1937, with a chorus of 350 and the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra at the Cincinnati May Festival in Ohio. From 1937 until 1942, Dett served as Visiting Director of Music at Bennett College in Greensboro, North Carolina. With its chorus he toured across Canada and the United States. They also performed on CBS radio broadcasts. Late in his career, Dett shifted his style from that of his earlier neo-romantic works and adopted more contemporary idioms. In this later period he wrote piano suites such as American Ordering of Moses (1937), Tropic Winter (1938), and Eight Bible Vignettes (1941‚Äì1943)‚Äîhis final piano suite. Dett joined the United Service Organization (USO) as a choral advisor to contribute to the war efforts in supporting US troops during World War II. Travelling with the USO chorus, he died of a heart attack on October 2, 1943.\\"Nathaniel Dett\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia, by Helmut Kallmann He was buried beside his wife as well as his two daughters, in the town of his birth at Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. Legacy and honours In the 2000s, Dett is remembered most for his work in creating music in the style of the European Romantic composers that incorporated elements of African-American spirituals. His music is still performed in the 2000s. Canada's Nathaniel Dett Chorale, founded in 1998, was named for him and performs his music as well as that of other composers of African descent. The chorale is one of many that has recorded his music. In 2014, his oratorio The Ordering of Moses was revived by the Cincinnati May Festival, and performed the same week in Music Hall in Cincinnati and at Carnegie Hall in New York. The incident from the world premiere in 1937, when the live broadcast was cut off by the NBC network during the performance, was re-created, using tapes of the announcer. There is no documented account of the reason for the interruption of the broadcast. In 1934 Dett, and/or his publisher, registered strong objections to saxophonist Frank Trumbauer's swing band adaptation of \\"Juba Dance\\", from the suite In the Bottoms. Brunswick Records was compelled to withdraw the recording (#6763) from release. Dett did little recording of his music. In 1912 he recorded five selections from the Magnolia Suite for QRS piano rolls. These are believed to be the first commercial piano rolls ever made by a black pianist. In 1919 he recorded two selections for Broome Special Phonograph Records, \\"Mammy\\" from Magnolia Suite and \\"Barcarolle\\" from In the Bottoms. The latter can be found on the CD Lost Sounds, Archeophone ARCH 1005. In 1993 Anne Key Simpson published a biography of Dett, Follow Me: the Life and Music of R. Nathaniel Dett. The former British Methodist Episcopal Church in Niagara Falls, Ontario, was renamed in honour of Dett. From 1898 to 1903, he was the organist at that church. The church was designated in 2001 as a National Historic Site of Canada.R. Nathaniel Dett British Methodist Episcopal Church, Directory of Designations of National Historic Significance of CanadaR.

Fresh Meadows used to be part of the broader town of Flushing and is bordered to the north by the Horace Harding Expressway; to the west by Pomonok, St. John's University and the sub-neighborhoods of Hillcrest and Utopia; to the east by Cunningham Park and the Clearview Expressway; and to the south by the Grand Central Parkway. Fresh Meadows is located in Queens Community District 8 and its ZIP Codes are 11365 and 11366. It is patrolled by the New York City Police Department's 107th Precinct. Politically, Fresh Meadows is represented by the New York City Council's 23rd and 24th Districts.Current City Council Districts for Queens County, New York City. Accessed May 5, 2017. History=Early history The name \\"Fresh Meadows\\" dates back to before the American Revolution. Fresh Meadows was part of the Town of Flushing, which had large areas of salt meadows, such as the original \\"Flushing Meadows\\". The wetlands in the hilly ground south and east of the village of Flushing, however, were fed by freshwater springs, and thus were \\"fresh meadows\\". Fresh Meadows Road (which today follows the same route under a number of names, including Fresh Meadows Lane and part of Utopia Parkway) traversed the area, and served as the route from the landing place at Whitestone to the village of Jamaica. In The Evening Post in 1805, farm owner James Smith advertised the sale of his 60-acre farm \\"on the road to Fresh Meadows and Flushing\\". During the American Revolution, British troops marched through the area. General Benedict Arnold and his troops stayed at farms along was the way. General Arnold drilled his troops in the area, on the current location of M.S. 216. In order to help move military supplies from British ships using the Whitestone Landing, and the troops encamped further east, a new road was built to connect the Fresh Meadows Road with Hempstead. This road began at what is now the intersection of Utopia Parkway and 73rd Avenue, near a local landmark along the Fresh Meadows Road: the remnants of a large tree that had burned after being struck by lightning, and that was known as the \\"Black Stump\\". The road took its name from this feature, and was called \\"Black Stump Road.\\" During the 19th century, a farming community known as Black Stump developed in the area. The Black Stump School was built before 1871. The school was expanded in 1900, and a second story was added in 1905. The remains of the Black Stump School were demolished in 1941 in order to build present- day Utopia Playground, located at 73rd Avenue and Utopia Parkway. For several years, the woods of Black Stump were rumored to be haunted because people heard strange sounds coming from the woods. In 1908, the mysterious sounds were discovered to be coming from a recluse who lived in a small hut and sang Irish folk songs at night.  Parsons Nurseries and Kissena Park  In 1868, Samuel Parsons opened Parsons Nurseries, one of the earliest commercial gardens, near what is now Fresh Meadows Lane. With help of a team of collectors, Parsons Nurseries found exotic trees and shrubs to import into the United States, and its advertisements filled gardening magazines with depictions of these exotic plants. During the late 1880s, Parsons Nurseries was importing 10,000 Japanese maples into the United States each year with help from Swiss immigrant John R. Trumpy. Parsons Nurseries also was the first to introduce the California privet in the United States from Japan. Samuel Parsons' children, Samuel Bowne Parsons and Robert Bowne Parsons, later took over running the nursery. In 1886, Samuel Bowne Parsons helped renew the plantations of Central Park while serving as Superintendent of Parks. Samuel Bowne Parsons gave the lake on his property the name \\"kissena\\", which he thought was the Chippewa word for \\"it is cold\\". Kissena Lake was initially used as a mill pond. Parsons later used the lake for ice cutting, where surface ice from lakes and rivers is collected and stored in ice houses and use or sale as a cooling method before mechanical refrigeration was available. The lake was also a habitat for wood duck through the 1900s. Just east of the lake was a water pumping station. By 1898, Samuel Bowne Parsons' son, George H. Parsons, had taken over as superintendent of Parsons Nurseries. Later that year, George was found in the lavatory by his father; he had died of heart failure. Parsons Nurseries closed in 1901, and Samuel Bowne Parsons died in 1906. Two real estate developers, John W. Paris and Edward McDougal, bought most of the Parsons land, then built large houses as part of the \\"Kissena Park\\" residential development. New York City bought the rest of the Parsons land and a few other land parcels to create Kissena Park. A tract of Parsons' exotic specimens was preserved in the modern-day park and is now the Historic Grove. Fresh Meadow Country Club In 1921, Park Slope resident Benjamin C. Ribman and others from the Unity Club of Brooklyn were looking to build a golf course. The group chose the intersection of Fresh Meadow Lane and Nassau Boulevard as the site, because the land was suitable for golf and roads provided accessibility to other parts of the city. The 106 acres of land were purchased in late 1921, and another 26 acres were purchased the next year. A. W. Tillinghast designed the golf course. Originally, the name was to be the Woodland. After the Brooklyn Daily Eagle pointed out that there was already a golf course name Woodland in Boston, the founders decided to name the course Fresh Meadow Country Club. The name came from an area northeast of Flushing even though the golf course was actually located southeast of Flushing, just south of what is presently the Long Island Expressway near 183rd Street. Fresh Meadow Country Club opened on May 30, 1922.\\"About FMCC: A Tale of Two Clubs\\". Fresh Meadow Country Club. Retrieved May 31, 2012. At the golf course's dedication, the first round of golf was played by former NCAA golf champion Jesse Sweetser and club professional Willie Anderson. Sweetser won by two strokes. People in attendance included New York State Supreme Court Justices Mitchell May, Edward Lazansky, and Harry Lewis, and Borough President Maurice E. Connolly. The clubhouse opened on September 8, 1923. Nine days later, the clubhouse burned to the ground from an explosion of a boiler. Firefighters from Flushing, Bayside, and Black Stump arrived but they were unable to save the clubhouse, in part because the nearest fire hydrant was a half-mile away, but they were able to stop the fire before it consumed an adjoining locker building and a two-story dormitory building. The PGA Championship was held at Fresh Meadow Country Club in 1930, and the U.S. Open was held at the course in 1932. In 1937, the golf course hosted a charity game between John Montague, Babe Ruth, Babe Didrikson, and Sylvania Annenberg, a game that was watched by 10,000 fans, some of whom rushed the golf course and left Babe Ruth's shirt in tatters. Fresh Meadows housing and retail development In February 1946, the golf course's land was sold to New York Life Insurance Company for $1,075,000, , in order to build a housing complex on the land. The Gross- Morton Company had also made an offer to buy the land, but it was not accepted. The New York Life Insurance Company chose Ralph Thomas Walker as the chief designer, and it signed a contract with the George A. Fuller Company, which had built the Flat Iron Building, to construct the apartment buildings. Construction cost the New York Life Insurance Company $35,000,000, . New York Life Insurance Company donated land on 69th Avenue at 195th Street to the city so it could build a school. In 1947, the New York City Board of Education awarded contracts of over $1,800,000, , to construct P.S. 26, an elementary school with a capacity of 1,494 students. On April 21, 1947, ground was broken for the school's construction. The school, P.S. 26, also known as the Rufus King School, opened in February 1949. P.S. 173 opened soon afterwards, in September 1949, at 69th Avenue and Fresh Meadows Lane. P.S. 173 was originally supposed to be built on the site of Utopia Playground one block west, but the school had been relocated due to opposition from Robert Moses, the New York City parks commissioner. The first twenty families moved into the Fresh Meadows Housing Development on September 2, 1947.\\"Open Queens Project\\". New York Amsterdam News. September 6, 1947. p. 19. As a result of housing segregation, New York Life Insurance Company did not allow black individuals to live in the Fresh Meadows Housing Development.Brown, Earl (August 9, 1947). \\"Timely Topics: About Jim Crow Housing Projects\\". New York Amsterdam News. p. 8. It was also built to house local World War II veterans. The complex and its eponymous shopping center were among the first in the United States designed primarily to accommodate automobile traffic rather than pedestrian traffic. Apartment rents were between $74 and $108 per month, which included gas and electricity. In 1949, architectural critic Lewis Mumford described the Fresh Meadows housing complex as \\"perhaps the most positive and exhilarating example of large-scale community planning in this country.\\" The construction of the final residential building, a 20-story apartment building at 67th Avenue and 192nd Street, was completed and ready for occupancy in May 1962. At the time the building's construction ended, 11,000 people were living in the Fresh Meadows Housing Development.Remnant of Long Island Motor Parkway at Springfield Boulevard in nearby Oakland Gardens New York Life Insurance Company built a 12-acre shopping center on 188th Street at Horace Harding Expressway. The shopping center was planned to include a Bloomingdale's, a movie theater, Canterbury Shops clothing store, Mary Lewis, Ormond Hosiery Shop, Woolworth's, Miles Shows, Buster Brown children's shoes, Selby women's shoes, Food Fair, a Horn & Hardart automat, Whelan's Drugs, Fanny Farmer, Union News, Womrath's Book Shop, Barrett Nephews dry cleaners, and Harris Brothers delicatessen, a Bank of Manhattan, a Jamaica Savings Bank, and a post office. Bloomingdale's opened on May 24, 1949. Century Meadows Theatre opened November 1949. In 1973, Bloomingdale's added a three-level extension to the store, on what had been a pedestrian plaza. Five 36-year-old oak trees were uprooted to construct the extension, to the dismay of nearby residents. The QM1 express bus to Manhattan started operating in 1968 as part of a 90-day trial run proposed by city traffic commissioner Henry A. Barnes, transportation administrator Arthur A. Palmer, and the New York Life Insurance Company. This service was eventually kept, and it was expanded in 1970 with branches running further east into Queens. The combined QM1/QM1A service eventually became among the busiest privately operated express routes in the city by the 2000s. In 1972, Harry B. Helmsley and the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation partnered to buy the Fresh Meadows housing and retail complex for $53,000,0000, , from the New York Life Insurance Company. The MacArthur Foundation acquired the property outright in 1995. In 1997, Witkoff Group and Insignia Financial Group bought the residential property, and Federated Realty Investment Trust bought the commercial property. The owners of Fresh Meadows received $215 million from the sale. Two months after the Bloomingdale's store was sold in August 1991, Kmart signed a 31-year lease for the space. Kmart's grand opening was on October 22, 1991. Kmart closed the store in 2003, as part of an effort to close underperforming stores. Kmart sold the lease to the Fresh Meadows location and four other locations to Kohl's for $16 million in 2003. The Kohl's in Fresh Meadows was the first Kohl's location in New York City.Boswell, Brannon (June 2003). \\"Big-box comes to the Big Apple\\". National Real Estate Investor (Atlanta, Georgia).

Fresh Meadows was home to Klein Farm, the last surviving commercial farm in New York City, located on 73rd Avenue between 194th and 195th Streets. Adam Klein, from Brooklyn, bought the Voorhis farm in the 1890s. Klein bought the 200-acre plot of land for $18 per acre. The family sold portions of the land over time, but kept the two acres surrounding the farm house. His son, Charles Klein, was born on the farm and operated it after his father's death in 1954 at age 89. By the early 1990s, John Klein Sr. ran the farm as well as two larger farms, one in Riverhead and one in upstate New York. The family had received many offers over the years to buy the land in Fresh Meadows. In 1991, the family declined an offer from the owner of a local pizza store, who wanted to buy the property in order to convert the family's home into a country-style restaurant. John Klein Jr., the great-grandson of Adam Klein, was running the farm by the late 1990s. The farm gradually become unprofitable, and in 2001, John Klein Sr. signed a contract to sell the two- acre property to Flushing-based developer Audrey Realty, who wanted to build 22 two-family homes on the site. The farm's last day open was November 21, 2001. Many in the community were opposed to the proposed sale, including the Fresh Meadows Tenants Association, the West Cunningham Park Civic Association, the Flushing Heights Civic Association, the Hillcrest Estates Civic Association, the Utopia Estates Civic Association, and the Utopia Park Civic Association. The community later learned that the developer was owned by the family of Tommy Huang, whose permits to restore the landmark RKO Keith's Theater in Flushing were revoked when he destroyed its lobby. Huang had also admitted to failing to report a spill of 10,000 gallons of heating oil from an underground tank into the soil beneath the RKO Keith's Theater in 1999. John Klein Sr. completed the sale to Huang for $4.3 million in late 2003. The land was located in a Special Planned Community Preservation District and required a special permit to build homes there. David Weprin, the neighborhood's representative in the New York City Council, opposed granting the special permit. Faced with strong community opposition, Huang and Audrey Realty decided not to go forward with the plan, and they instead agreed to sell the land to a Westchester-based developer, Steven Judelson. At the time, Judelson said he had not decided what to do with the land. The sale did not go through. In 2005, Huang sent a proposal to the City Planning Commission to build 18 two-family homes on the site. The proposal was not approved, and a day-care center was opened instead. Huang attempted to evict the day-care center in 2009, saying that he needed to end the lease early in order to sell the property. Huang settled with the day-care center to terminate its lease three months early so that Huang could sell the property to Fresh Meadows Jewish Development LLC for $5.6 million. The sale did not go through.Robinson, Alex (August 7, 2014). \\"Klein farm sold to tree cutters\\". TimesLedger (Queens, New York). In 2012, Huang was convicted of embezzling over $3 million of federal funds that were intended to pay for children's lunches at Huang's Red Apple Child Development Centers.

Subsections=Hillcrest Union Turnpike in Hillcrest Hillcrest is a neighborhood in the center of Queens; the name comes from its location on the hills between Flushing and Jamaica. Hillcrest stretches from the Grand Central Parkway to 73rd Avenue, between Utopia Parkway and Parsons Boulevard. Its main commercial street is Union Turnpike. Hillcrest is part of Queens Community Board 8. The ZIP Codes for the neighborhood are 11366 (Fresh Meadows and Flushing zip code) for anything above Union Turnpike, and 11432 or 11439 (Jamaica zip codes) for the southern part of the neighborhood (below Union Turnpike, north of Grand Central Parkway). It neighbors Kew Gardens Hills and Pomonok to the west, Fresh Meadows to the north, Utopia to the east, and Jamaica Hills to the south. It is mostly made up of single-family homes, is in a relatively well-off public school district, and has a low crime rate. As with many neighborhoods in the city, different residents have varying perceptions of its boundaries. Most people in the northeastern part of Hillcrest self-identify as being in Fresh Meadows, as does everyone living in nearby Utopia. Others tend to identify with neighborhoods that surround them. There is a small group in the center of the Hillcrest area that identify exclusively with it. Hillcrest is home to an Orthodox Jewish community. Some public high schools in Hillcrest are Queens Gateway to Health Sciences Secondary School, and Queens School of inquiry. St. John's University is also located in the neighborhood on Utopia Parkway. =History= 75th Avenue was originally known as Hell Fire Lane, then Quarrelsome Lane, and then Eiseman Avenue. In 1938 and 1939, Moss Brothers built approximately 550 homes along Utopia Parkway between Horace Harding Expressway and Grand Central Parkway. Moss Brothers hired architect Arthur E. Allen to design the homes. The development was called Hillcrest Gardens. Utopia Utopia is in the southeastern part of Fresh Meadows, bordered by Utopia Parkway to the west, 73rd Avenue to the north, 188th Street to the east, and Union Turnpike to the south. Utopia is part of Queens Community Board 8 and is often considered to be a part of Fresh Meadows, though The New York Times and the New York City Department of City Planning delineate Utopia as a separate neighborhood. Utopia's residents includes many Conservative and Orthodox Jews, Chinese Americans, Korean Americans, Russian Americans, Indian Americans, and Hispanic and Latino Americans. Utopia primarily consists of houses and tree-lined streets. The triangular-shaped Utopia Playground, at Utopia Parkway and 73rd Avenue, used to be the site of the Black Stump School, when the area was still called Black Stump. The school was later replaced by Black Stump Hook, Ladder, and Bucket Company, a volunteer firehouse. Today, it has a playground, a softball field, basketball courts, and handball courts. It is bordered by the neighborhoods of Hillcrest to the west, Fresh Meadows to the north and east, and Jamaica Estates to the south. Utopia is also home to the Hillcrest Jewish Center and the Queens Public Library at Hillcrest, both located on Union Turnpike. =History= Simon Freeman, Samuel Resler, and Joseph Fried incorporated the Utopia Land Company in 1903. The following year, the Utopia Land Company bought of land between the communities of Jamaica and Flushing. The Utopia Land Company intended to build a cooperative community for Jewish families interested in moving away from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. They intended to name the streets after those on the Lower East Side, where there was already a large Jewish population. After its initial acquisition, the company was unable to secure enough funding to further develop the area. In 1909, of the land was sold to Felix Isman of Philadelphia for $350,000, . The area remained farmland until 1935, when the land was bought by the Gross-Morton Park Corporation, run by George M. Gross, Alfred Gross, and Lawrence Morton. Gross-Morton had experience in building residential developments in Queens, such as when it had developed the land of the Belleclaire golf course in Bayside, around today's 48th Avenue and 211th Street. In 1937, the company bought of contiguous farmland on the south side of Black Stump Road (now 73rd Avenue) from the Klein family. In 1939, it bought of land that had been formerly part of the Klein Farm and the Wigmore estate. The land included about one mile of land directly on Union Turnpike, on which it built about forty stores. On the land it bought in Utopia, the Gross-Morton Park Corporation built colonial and Cape Cod-style homes with either two or three bedrooms, each on approximately of land in the early 1940s. Arthur Allen was the architect of the homes. In 1938, Paul Roth bought the portion of the Klein Farm on the north side of Union Turnpike, between 185th Street and 188th Street, to build 70 houses. The Batterman family owned and operated a farm on land bounded by Union Turnpike, Utopia Parkway, 75th Avenue, and 170th Street. In 1938, the Foch Building Corporation bought the Batterman Estate in order to develop it into a residential neighborhood, named University Manor. The Foch Building Corporation had previously built 111 houses in what is now St. Albans, Queens.

Yogananda made Walters a minister for his organization, Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF). He authorized him to teach Kriya Yoga while with SRF, and appointed him the head monk for the SRF Mount Washington monks only. After Yogananda's death, Walters was given final vows of sannyas in 1955 by then SRF President Daya Mata and given the name Kriyananda. In 1960, upon the passing of M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors elected Kriyananda to the Board of Directors and to the position of Vice President. In 1962, the SRF Board of Directors voted unanimously to request his resignation. Kriyananda is the author of about 150 published books/booklets and the composer of over 400 pieces of music, which altogether have sold over three million copies. A few of the books have been published in 28 languages and a few are sold in 90 countries. He lectured in different countries throughout the world. In addition to English, he spoke Italian, Romanian, Greek, French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Indonesian.Kalra, Ajay, In the Name of My Guru, Life Positive, 1 April 2006 He established a new Swami order in 2009: the Nayaswami Order. A jury in a court of law found Kriyananda aka Donald Walters guilty of fraudulently representing himself as a celibate religious leader or swami even though he had sex with several of his devotees during 30 years at the helm of Ananda. Several women came forward during the civil trial to testify that Walters had sexually exploited them. Biography=Early life J. Donald Walters was born on May 19, 1926, in Teleajen, Romania to American parents, Ray P. and Gertrude G. Walters. His father was an oil geologist with the Esso Corporation (since renamed Exxon in the United States) who was then assigned to the Romanian oilfields. He received an international education in Romania, Switzerland, England, and the United States. He attended Haverford College and Brown University, leaving the latter with only a semester left before graduation to dedicate his life to searching for God.Swami Kriyananda, The New Path - My Life with Paramhansa Yogananda. (Crystal Clarity Publishers, 2009). . Time with Yogananda In September 1948, in New York, Walters read Yogananda's Autobiography of a Yogi, a book he says transformed his life. By September 12, Walters had decided to leave his old life behind, and soon afterwards traveled cross-country by bus to southern California to become one of Yogananda's disciples. In Hollywood, California, Walters first met Yogananda at the Self- Realization Fellowship temple there and was accepted as a disciple. As recounted in his autobiography, The New Path, Walters, twenty-two years old at this point, took up residence with other monks at SRF's mother center headquarters located on top of Mount Washington, Los Angeles. A year later, Yogananda had put Walters in charge of the monks there, asked him to write articles for the SRF magazine, had him lecture at various SRF centers, ordained him a minister, and appointed him to initiate students into Kriya Yoga. In their three and one half years (9/1948‚Äì3/1952) together, Walters took notes of his conversations with his master, publishing them in his 2003 The Essence of Self-RealizationKriyananda, The Essence of Self-Realization Crystal Clarity Publishers (2003) and his 2004 Conversations with Yogananda.Kriyananda, Conversations With Yogananda: Stories, Sayings, and Wisdom of Paramhansa Yogananda Crystal Clarity Publishers (2004) After Yogananda On March 7, 1952, Paramahansa Yogananda was a speaker at a banquet for the visiting Indian Ambassador to the U.S., Binay Ranjan Sen, and his wife at the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Los Angeles. While giving his speech, Yogananda suddenly dropped to the floor and died. Walters was present in the hall, and this was a pivotal moment for the young monk. In 1953, the SRF published Walter's book, Stories of Mukunda,Walters, James Donald Erzieher Stories of Mukunda Los Angeles: Self-Realization Fellowship (1953) See Autobiography of a Yogi, (1955) 6th ed., p. 498 and in 1960 an LP album with him singing Yogananda's Cosmic Chants, entitled Music for Meditation. In 1955, Walters was given his final vows of sannyas into the order of Shankaracharya swamis, by Daya Mata, SRF president from 1955 until her death in 2010, and took the monastic name of \\"Kriyananda\\". Yogananda stated in his Autobiography of a Yogi regarding this order: > Every swami belongs to the ancient monastic order which was organized in its > present form by Shankara. Because it is a formal order, with an unbroken > line of saintly representatives serving as active leaders, no man can give > himself the title of swami. He rightfully receives it only from another > swami; all monks thus trace their spiritual lineage to one common guru, Lord > Shankara. By vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience to the spiritual > teacher, many Catholic Christian monastic orders resemble the Order of > Swamis.Yogananda, Paramhansa, Autobiography of a Yogi Nevada City, > California:Crystal Clarity Publishers (1995 [1946]) Wikisource, Chapter 24 He was made the director of the SRF Center Department, which guides SRF's meditation groups and centers, and was made a minister of Yogananda's Hollywood temple. He lectured for SRF in the United States, as well as in Canada, Mexico, England, France, Switzerland, Italy, Australia, Fiji, New Zealand, and India. In 1958, when Daya Mata, then President of SRF, traveled to India with Ananda Mata and another nun, he came along as well. In 1960, upon the death of Board member and Vice President of SRF, M.W. Lewis, the SRF Board of Directors, who were direct disciples appointed to the board by Yogananda, elected Kriyananda as a member and Vice President of the Board. He served in that capacity until dismissed in 1962. Dismissal Kriyananda remained in India, serving the SRF until 1962, when the SRF's board of directors voted unanimously to request his resignation. SRF said that the reasons for his dismissal had to do with specific actions of his ‚Äì his basic pattern of behavior and being self-serving. \\"Kriyananda constantly argued that his dismissal was unjust.\\" Outward accomplishments Kriyananda established Ananda Village as a World Brotherhood Colony in 1968 on 40 acres (160,000 m2) of land near Nevada City, California ‚Äì his portion of a 160-acre (0.6 km2) parcel acquired with Richard Baker, Gary Snyder, and Allen Ginsberg.Suiter, John.

The establishment of World Brotherhood Colonies was one of Yogananda's central \\"Aims and Ideals\\" published in his Autobiography of a Yogi until 1958. Kriyananda founded various retreat centers: The Expanding Light Yoga and Meditation Retreat and nearby Ananda Meditation Retreat, both located near Nevada City, California, U.S.A.; Ananda Associazione near Assisi, Italy; and Ananda Gurgaon, India. There are over 125 Ananda Meditation groups in 19 countries, all of which were inspired in one way or another by Kriyananda. The Expanding Light retreat center in California, founded by Kriyananda Kriyananda stated that at Yogananda's request he devoted his life to teaching. Over the course of sixty years, he lectured on four continents in five languages. He gave thousands of lectures and continued lecturing in Asia, Europe, and America until his death. Kriyananda met a number of well-known spiritual teachers: Anandamayi Ma; Sivananda Saraswati and his disciples Chidananda and Satchidananda; Muktananda; Satya Sai Baba; Neem Karoli Baba; the 14th Dalai Lama; A. C. Bhaktivedanta Prabhupada; Ravi Shankar; Vicka Ivankovic, visionary of Medjugorje; and a few others.Visit to Saints of India, Ananda Sangha Publications, In the early 1960s, one of Kriyananda's inter- religious projects near New Delhi, India, received personal support from India's Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. He also had personal contact with Indira Gandhi; with India's Vice President Radhakrishnan; and, in 2006, with India's President, Abdul Kalam. In following his guru's guidance that his task would be \\"writing, editing, and lecturing\\", Kriyananda wrote about 150 books, each of which he stated was intended to help individuals expand their awareness. By the application of Yogananda's teachings, they expand on such varied topics as marriage, education, leadership and success, spiritual communities, yoga, self-healing, art, architecture, astrology, and philosophy, as well as Yogananda's teachings on the Bible, the Bhagavad Gita, the Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam, and other scriptures. One of Kriyananda's books is The Path (revised as The New Path in 2009), which among other things contains details of the three and a half years he spent as Yogananda's direct disciple in Los Angeles. Kriyananda started Crystal Clarity Publishers and the East-West book shops in Sacramento and Mountain View, California, and Seattle, Washington. Kriyananda's plays include The Peace Treaty and The Jewel in the Lotus. He wrote his first play at age fifteen and worked and studied with the Dock Street Theater in Charleston, South Carolina, in his early 20s. Rome's famous Teatro Valle (its oldest still-active theater, built in 1726) hosted The Peace Treaty in June 2009. Kriyananda won poetry and essay contest prizes at Haverford College and also studied under the poet W.H. Auden at Bryn Mawr College. In 1973, Kriyananda developed a system for educating children called Education for Life. Education for Life schools state that they offer character development, strong academics, and development of moral strength. The school curriculum is ecumenical; students from all religious backgrounds may attend. There are schools in Seattle, Washington; Portland, Oregon; and Palo Alto and Nevada City, California (all U.S.A.); in Italy near Assisi; and one was recently (2009) started in Gurgaon, India. Other schools are adopting the curriculum and ideals of Education for Life. Kriyananda's educational ideas also inspired Ananda College, a yoga university as envisioned by Paramahansa YogƒÅnanda, located near Nevada City, California. Kriyananda created Ananda Yoga. Yogananda had asked him often to perform the asanas for visiting guests, in his presence. This inspired him to create Ananda Yoga. It is designed to uplift consciousness, and to prepare the student for meditation. Its distinguishing features are the affirmations associated with postures. Kriyananda took over 15,000 photographs, many of which he said captured the consciousness of human beings behind the image. His photos have been used on inspirational posters, on album covers, for slideshows, in film productions, and in books. Kriyananda created several paintings, which have been used on book covers and on posters. He also produced films, as follows: * Saint Francis of Assisi (narration, music, photography) * Mediterranean Magic (narration, music, photography) * The Land of Mystery (narration, music, photography) * The Autobiography of a Yogi (narration, music, photography) * Christ Lives! (narration, music, photography) * Different Worlds (narration, music, photography) Volunteer work * 1948‚Äì2013: As a renunciate or as a householder, Kriyananda dedicated his life in service to others. Copyrights to his books and music were placed in a trust. Royalties were directed toward the work of sharing Kriyananda‚Äôs teachings with the public. For many years in his later life, he received no salary or stipend, and depended on donations for all his needs, including food, housing, and medical care. * 1997: After the destructive Umbria and Marche earthquake that damaged large areas around Assisi, Italy, including the Basilica of St. Francis, Kriyananda raised funds to help rebuild homes in the area, in a campaign called ‚ÄúHope and Homes for Italy‚Äù. He encouraged the use of wood instead of stone building materials, to minimize future earthquake fatalities. Legal cases=Self-Realization Fellowship Church vs Ananda Church of Self-Realization & J. Donald Walters litigation Self-Realization Fellowship filed suit against James Donald Walters (a.k.a. Kriyananda) and Walters' (then-called) Church of Self- Realization regarding the changing of the name to the Church of Self- Realization and on issues regarding specific writings, photographs and recordings of Paramahansa Yogananda. The litigation lasted for around twelve years (1990‚Äì2002). SRF asserted Yogananda wanted SRF to maintain the copyrights to his works and to publish them. SRF also asserted exclusive and sole rights (trademark and service mark) to the names \\"Self-Realization Fellowship\\", \\"Self-Realization Fellowship Church\\", and \\"Paramahansa Yogananda\\", as well as all images of Yogananda and the term \\"Self- Realization\\". SRF conceded some copyright and trademark claims during federal court in Sacramento, California, but prevailed on its assertion that Yogananda repeatedly stated his intentions for SRF to maintain copyrights to his works and to publish them. Both SRF and Ananda had wins and losses. SRF won the service marks to \\"Self-Realization Fellowship\\" and \\"Self-Realization Fellowship Church\\". SRF lost its service marks to the names \\"Paramahansa Yogananda\\" and \\"Self-realization\\", its claim of Unfair Competition, and its claim to own copyrights on ten photos of Yogananda. Ananda submitted the following counterclaim and lost all four claims: (1) Violation of the Sherman Act, (2) Libel, (3) Slander, and (4) Unfair Business Practices. In 1992, the court dismissed the second and third counterclaims on 1st Amendment grounds, and Ananda subsequently withdrew the other two counterclaims. At the jury trial in 2002, SRF won the claim that Ananda violated SRF's copyrights to magazine articles written by Yogananda. Another issue on which the jury found in SRF's favor was its claim that Ananda violated SRF copyrights to recordings of Yogananda's voice. In mid-litigation, Ananda began publication of Yogananda's first, 1946 edition of Autobiography of a Yogi.Library of Congress Catalog Record In 2002, the long litigation was completed with a jury verdict. As reported in The Union, a newspaper located in Grass Valley, California, on October 30, 2002: Yogananda incorporated the Self-Realization Fellowship as a nonprofit organization and reassigned all of his property including Mt Washington to the corporation, thereby protecting his assets. Anne-Marie Bertolucci vs J Donald Walters & Ananda litigation In 1997‚Äì98, Anne-Marie Bertolucci, a former resident of Ananda, filed suit against Ananda, Ananda minister Danny Levin, and J. Donald Walters (Kriyananda). The jury found the church (Ananda) and Kriyananda liable for \\"constructive fraud\\", with a finding of \\"malice\\" and \\"fraudulent conduct\\". The church, Kriyananda and Levin were found liable for \\"intentional infliction of emotional distress\\" with a finding of \\"malice\\" and a finding of \\"despicable conduct\\" against the church. During the trial, six women testified under oath that Kriyananda had taken sexual advantage of them when they were impressionable twentysomethings in search of spiritual advancement. Walters blamed the women who accused him of sexual abuse, saying they 'thrust their company' on him and interrupted his meditations by taking advantage of his sexual 'weaknesses.' Court depositions came from many different women from different areas over a twenty year period whose only point of contact had been the Ananda church. The church was found liable for \\"negligent supervision\\" of Kriyananda, with a finding of \\"malice and fraud\\" on the part of the church. Kriyananda was judged to have misrepresented himself as a monk and to have caused emotional trauma, and was ordered to pay $685,000 in compensatory damages, and another $1 million in punitive damages. The jury also found that Levin had made \\"unwelcome sexual advances\\". The punitive damages were reduced by $400,000 on appeal. The Ananda Church responded to the million-plus-dollar judgment by filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code. That allowed Ananda to settle the lawsuit by paying $1.8 million to Bertolucci and her attorneys. They presented, according to Kriyananda, \\"lies and complete distortions of the truth.\\" Ananda hired a private investigator who was caught rummaging in the trash of opposing counsel. The judge's sanctions of Ananda included disallowing the questioning of the many women alleging sexual misconduct against Kriyananda. Ananda Assisi vs Italian authorities In March 2004, Italian authorities raided the Ananda colony in Assisi, responding to allegations of a former resident who accused Ananda Assisi of fraud, usury and labor law violations. Nine residents were detained for questioning. They also had a warrant for Kriyananda's detention, but he was in India. A seven-year- long investigation followed. In March 2009, the judge ruled that the case was \\"non luogo a procedere perch√© il fatto non sussiste\\" (not to be continued as the matter is without substance). Recent years Kriyananda married in 1981, and publicly renounced his monastic vows in the Shankaracharya order on the occasion of his second marriage in 1985 and returned to using his birth name, James Donald Walters. He was later divorced. In 1995, on his own, he resumed his monastic name and vows. From 1996, as Kriyananda, he lived and taught for seven years at the Ananda Italy center, near Assisi. In 2003, he moved to India, where he began an Ananda center in Gurgaon, near Delhi. For five years (until May 1, 2009) he appeared on Sadhna TV and Aastha TV, television channels that were broadcast throughout India, Asia, Europe, and the United States. Since his 2003 move to India, Ananda teachers have been giving classes on meditation and KriyƒÅ Yoga in many major Indian cities. In 2009, at age 83, he moved to Pune to start a new community. In 2009, he established a new swami order, different from Yogananda's lineage in the Giri branch of the Swami Order of Shankara. According to Kriyananda, he believed that in this new age (Dvapara Yuga) not all old patterns remained valid, some reformation was necessary. Some of the features of the newly formed Nayaswami order are: (1) Nayaswamis can be single or married. (2) They can be freely creative, if the purpose is to serve others. (3) A new Nayaswami is named not by one Nayaswami (which had been the tradition), but by three. (4) A Nayaswami of this new order is called \\"Nayaswami\\", with \\"naya\\" meaning \\"new\\". Hence, he initiated himself and gave himself the title Nayaswami. On April 21, 2013, he died in his home in Assisi. His remains were brought back to Ananda Village in May 2013.

Like the Angelines, they trace their origins to their foundress Saint Angela Merici and place themselves under the patronage of Saint Ursula. While the Ursulines took up a monastic way of life under the Rule of Saint Augustine, the Angelines operate as a secular institute. The largest group within the Ursulines is the Ursulines of the Roman Union. History In 1572 in Milan, under Saint Charles Borromeo, the Archbishop of Milan, members of the Company of Saint Ursula chose to become an enclosed religious order. Pope Gregory XIII placed them under the Rule of Saint Augustine. Especially in France, groups of the company begin to re-shape themselves as cloistered nuns, under solemn vows, and dedicated to the education of girls within the walls of their monasteries. In the following century, the Ursuline nuns were strongly encouraged and supported by Saint Francis de Sales. They were called the \\"Ursuline nuns\\" as distinct from the \\"federated Ursulines\\" of the company, who preferred to follow the original way of life. Both forms of life continued to spread throughout Europe and beyond. At the beginning of the 18th century, the period of its greatest growth, the order was represented by 20 congregations, 350 convents and from 15,000 to 20,000 nuns.  Ursulines in North America =Canada The Ursuline sisters were not the first Catholic nuns to land in the new world. They were preceded by the Hieronymites in 1585 in Mexico City, who established the convent of San Jer√≥nimo y Santa Paula. In 1639, Mother Marie of the Incarnation, two other Ursuline nuns, and a Jesuit priest left France for a mission to Canada. When they arrived in the summer of 1639, they studied the languages of the native peoples and then began to educate the native children.Buescher, John. \\"Religious Orders of Women in New France\\", Teachinghistory.org, accessed August 21, 2011 They taught reading and writing as well as needlework, embroidery, drawing, and other domestic arts.Agnes Repplier, M√®re Marie of the Ursulines: a study in adventure (New York, 1931) The Ursuline convent in Quebec City is the oldest educational institution for women in North America. Their work helped to preserve a religious spirit among the French population and to Christianize native peoples and M√©tis. United States The first Ursulines arrived at Mobile, Alabama, in 1719 (though information is contradictory from remaining and available sources). In 1727, 12 Ursulines from France landed in what is now New Orleans. The entire group of Ursulines were the first Roman Catholic nuns in what is now the United States. Both properties were part of the French colony of Louisiana (New France). They came to the country under the auspices of Pope Pius III and Louis XV of France. Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, their charter came under the jurisdiction of the United States.Dom Guy-Marie Oury, Les Ursulines de Qu√©bec, 1639-1953 (2000) They instituted a convent and school, both of which continue today. Ursuline Academy (New Orleans) is the oldest continually operating Catholic school in the United States and the oldest girls school in the United States. The Ursuline tradition holds many United States firsts in its dedication to the growth of individuals, including the first female pharmacist, first woman to contribute a book of literary merit, first convent, first free school and first retreat center for ladies, first classes for female slaves (which continued until abolition), free women of color (a unique New Orleans group also known as Creoles of Color) and Native Americans. In the Mississippi Valley region, Ursuline provided the first social welfare center. The tombstone of the Ursuline Sisters in Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (New Rochelle, New York) The Old Ursuline Convent is located in the Vieux Carre (New Orleans' French Quarter). The building now houses the Archdiocese of New Orleans' Archives as well as operating as a tourist attraction/ museum with public tours available almost daily. They had a well established presence as a hospital by the time of the US Revolutionary War. Ursuline sisters treated in the same building both British and United States soldiers wounded in the war. They may have been the first group of women propagating the ideals of diversity in a society, which flowed directly from the teachings of St Ursula and her followers. Ursuline nuns, primarily from France and Germany, settled in other parts of North America including Boston (1820), Brown County, Ohio (1845), Cleveland (1850), New York City (1855), Louisville (1858), Chatham, Ontario (1860), and Bruno (1916) and Prelate (1919) in Saskatchewan. These foundations spread to other parts of North America including Toledo, Youngstown, OH, Mount St. Joseph, KentuckyUrsuline Sisters of Mount Saint Joseph Santa Rosa, Texas, and Mexico City.\\"Follow the Spirit.\\" Angela Merici and the Ursulines. Editions du Signe. Rome: Spada, 1998 Today the monastic Order of St. Ursula (post-nominals OSU) has as its largest group the Ursulines of the Roman Union, described in this article. The other branch is the Company of St. Ursula, commonly called the \\"Angelines\\", who follow the original form of life established by their foundress. The members wore a black dress bound by a leathern girdle, a black sleeveless cloak, and a close-fitting headdress with a white veil and a longer black veil. Ursulines in Ireland In 1767, Nano Nagle stayed with the Ursuline Sisters on Rue des Ursulines in Paris while visiting her cousin Margaret Butler who had been professed just one year previously. In 1771, she established the first Ursuline convent in Ireland on Cove Lane in Cork. The community was made up of four Cork women ‚Äì who were professed at the Ursuline Convent in the Rue St. Jacques in Paris ‚Äì together with a reverend mother.Clarke, Sr M. Ursula. The Ursulines in Cork since 1771 (Cork: Ursuline Convent, 2007) In 1825, the sisters and their boarding students relocated to Blackrock. The first Ursuline primary and second-level schools were founded at Blackrock.\\"Ursuline Education in Ireland\\", St. Ursula's Primary School At the request of James Butler, Archbishop of Cashel and Emly, Anastasia Tobin went to Cork to train as a religious. She was professed at the Ursuline convent in September 1787, and returned to Thurles where she commenced teaching. Joined in 1796 by two others also trained at Cork, a small Ursuline community was founded at Thurles. In 1816, four sisters from Thurles established a community in Waterford.\\"History of the Ursuline Sisters in Waterford\\", St. Angela's School, Waterford In 1932, Providence School was opened to serve the needs of the travelling community.\\"Ursulines Thurles\\", Sisters of the Irish Ursuline Union In 1839, George Joseph Plunket Browne, Bishop of Galway, brought the Ursuline Order of nuns to Dangan on the Oughterard road. In 1844, Browne was translated to the Diocese of Elphin. The Ursulines Order followed him to Elphin, first to Summerhill in Athlone and then to Sligo. He raffled his carriage to raise funds to compensate the sisters for the financial loss they suffered by removing to Sligo. There they took up residence at \\"Seaville\\", the former house of Bishop Burke, Browne's predecessor, and renamed it St. Joseph's Convent. Nazareth free primary school was built in 1851.\\"History Of The School\\", Ursuline College Sligo In 1952 the Ursulines established St. Angela's College, Sligo for the training of students and teachers in Home Economics, which became recognised college of the National University of Ireland in 1978, and since 2003 is a College of the National University of Ireland, Galway. The Irish Ursuline Union was established in 1978. Role in education 280px Colleges and universities In the United States, the Ursulines have founded two well-known Catholic women's colleges. Ursuline College in Pepper Pike, Ohio, was founded in 1871 by the Ursuline Sisters of Cleveland. It was followed in 1904 by College of New Rochelle, which is located in New Rochelle, New York. In 1919, the Ursulines founded a university-level liberal arts college for women in London, Ontario, Canada. Currently called Brescia University College (Brescia College at its foundation), it remains the only university-level college for women in Canada and is affiliated with the University of Western Ontario. From 1922 to 1975 the Mary Manse College in Toledo, Ohio, was operated by the Ursulines. It was a women's college until 1971, then was coeducational for its final four years. 1927, the Ursuline Sisters of the Eastern Province restructured catholic education in Elkton, Maryland by assisting in the founding of Immaculate Conception School, originally located at the corner of Cathedral Street and Singerly Avenue in historic Elkton, Maryland. The Ursulines ministered within the schoolhouse from 1927 to 1930, followed by the Glen Riddle Franciscan Sisters of Saint Francis of Philadelphia. In 1932, the Great Falls Junior College for Women was founded in Great Falls, Montana. Now the University of Providence, it has an open admission policy. The Mount Saint Joseph Junior College for Women operated between 1925 and 1950 in Maple Mount, Kentucky, with the Ursulines offering co-educational extension courses at Owensboro. The Ursulines merged their extension courses with Mount Saint Joseph Junior College in 1950, creating the co-educational Brescia University that remains in operation. In 1966, the Ursulines established in Taiwan what became the Wenzao Ursuline College of Languages. From 1968 to 2003 the Ursuline Order operated Ursula College at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia. It is a co-educational residential college for approximately 200 undergraduates. In 2003 the college was sold to the University and was renamed Ursula Hall. The Ursuline tradition has been retained in the Hall's high educational standards, retention of Ursuline symbols and livery, and the observance in October of Ursies Weekend for relaxing and socializing before November exams. Secondary education Ursuline Convent, Dallas, Texas (postcard, circa 1901-1907) Ursuline Convent, Toledo, Ohio Ursuline secondary education schools are found across the United States and other countries. The first school was Ursuline Academy, began in 1727 in New Orleans, Louisiana. It is the oldest all-girls school in the country. The Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School in the Bronx is the oldest all-girls Catholic high school in New York State, founded in 1855, the same year Sacred Heart Academy in Louisville, Kentucky, was founded. The Ursuline nuns had been invited to St. Teresa's parish by Rev. James Boyce in 1873 to open a girls‚Äô academy, which was incorporated in 1881 on Henry Street in what is now the Bronx, New York. In 1899 they took possession of a mansion originally built by General Winfield Scott, which he had dubbed, \\"The Hermitage,\\" and shortly thereafter changed the name of their school from St. Teresa's Ursuline Academy New-York to the Ursuline Academy. In 1905, a news article announced plans for a four-story seminary building to be made for the Convent of St. Theresa on that site by architect Joseph H.McGuire. However, photos show the building unchanged as of 1911. author=Digital Collections, The New York Public Library accessdate=May 7, 2019 publisher=The New York Public Library, Astor, Lennox, and Tilden Foundation}} They occupied this building until selling it in 1912, and moving the school to the Ursuline Provinculate at Grand Boulevard and 165th Street. The Ursuline School in New Rochelle, New York, is a school for girls in grades 6-12 and is closely affiliated with the nearby Iona Preparatory School. Other notable all-female Ursuline secondary schools in the United States include Ursuline Academy of Dallas, Texas, Ursuline Academy in Saint Louis, Missouri (founded in 1848), and Ursuline Academy in Wilmington, Delaware. In the London Borough of Newham, United Kingdom, is the all-female girl school St. Angela's, named after the founder of the Ursulines. Only the sixth form centre of the school allows males. The same applies to the Ursuline High School in Wimbledon, which has recently been selected as a Regional Winner - \\"London Secondary\\" in the Church School Awards 2011. Ursulines also have St Ursula's Convent School in Greenwich which educates girls aged 11 to 16 and coeducational Ursuline College, Westgate-on-Sea. The British philosopher and author Celia Green has written extensively about her time at the Ursuline High School (now Ursuline Academy Ilford) in Ilford, London.Green, Celia (2004). Letters from Exile: Observations on a Culture in Decline. Oxford: Oxford Forum. Angela de Merici inspired the Ursuline Sisters to provide young women with an opportunity to achieve their full potential. Throughout their lives, students continue to remain part of the Ursuline community and continue to carry forward the legacy of Angela de Merici, by serving their society. There is an Ursuline Convent, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, India. In Thailand, the Ursulines established Mater Dei School in Bangkok in 1928. Its elite alumni include Kings Ananda Mahidol and Bhumibol Adulyadej.The History of Mater Dei School Although an all-girls school, it enrolled boys from Kindergarten through Primary 2. In Indonesia, the Ursulines established the Princess Juliana School in Batavia (1912), after its initial establishment as an Ursuline Convent in 1859. Now the school is known as St. Ursula Catholic School and is an all-girls school. Like their colleges, not all Ursuline secondary schools have remained single-sex. Villa Angela Academy, founded in 1878, in Cleveland, Ohio, merged with Marianist (Society of Mary) St. Joseph High School in 1990 forming the coed Villa Angela St. Joseph High School. The aforementioned Ursuline Academy in Delaware permits male students in grades 1‚Äì3, and Ursuline High School in Youngstown, Ohio, founded in 1905, is fully co-educational. Other Ursuline secondary schools in the United States include Beaumont School in Cleveland Heights, Ohio (founded in 1850); Ursuline Academy in San Antonio, TX (founded 1851 - closed 1992); Ursuline Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio (founded in 1898); St. Ursula Academy in Cincinnati, Ohio; the Ursuline Academy of Dedham in Dedham, Massachusetts; Ursuline High School in Santa Rosa, California (founded in 1880); Ursuline Academy in Springfield, Illinois (founded 1857), which was coed from 1981 until it closed in 2007; and St. Joseph's Ursuline Academy in Malone, New York (closed in 1977 and was coed at least from the mid-1960s). There are Ursuline secondary schools in Ireland in Thurles, County Tipperary; Waterford, Blackrock, County Cork; and Sligo, Ireland, which have remained single sex.

In 1872 he established the newspaper Tvedestrandsposten, and in 1877 the Fedraheimen, which he served as managing editor until 1892.His friend Ivar Mortensson-Egnund edited the paper ‚ÄúFedraheimen‚Äù from 1883 until 1889. In the 1880s he was also a journalist for the Dagbladet. In 1894 he laid the ground, together with Rasmus Steinsvik, for the paper Den 17de Mai;Norway's independence day. which changed its name to Norsk Tidend in 1935. His novels are profound and gripping while his essays are clear and insightful. He was never inclined to steer clear of controversy. His work tackled the issues of the day, including the relevance of religion in modern times, the conflicts between national and European identity, and the ability of the common people to actually participate in political processes and decisions. In 2012 the Garborg Centre opened at Bryne, Time. It is dedicated to the literature and philosophy of Arne and his wife, Hulda. Several of their homes are now turned into museums, like Garborgheimen, Labr√•ten, Kolbotn and Knudaheio. Bibliography Garborg's birth home at J√¶ren is a museum today.

In archaeology, palaeontology, and geomorphology, lichenometry is a geomorphic method of geochronologic dating that uses lichen growth to determine the age of exposed rock, based on a presumed specific rate of increase in radial size over time.Holocene climatic and glacial history of the central Sierra Nevada, California, R.R.

Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, Three Rivers, California, Measuring the diameter of the largest lichen of a species on a rock surface can therefore be used to determine the length of time the rock has been exposed. Lichen can be preserved on old rock faces for up to 10,000 years, providing the maximum age limit of the technique, though it is most accurate (within 10% error) when applied to surfaces that have been exposed for less than 1,000 years.Sowers, J.M., Noller, J.S., and Lettis, W.R., eds., 1997, Dating and Earthquakes: Review of Quaternary Geochronology and its Application to Paleoseismology. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NUREG/CR 5562. (The practical limit of the technique might be 4,000 to 5,000 years.) Lichenometry is especially useful for dating surfaces less than 500 years old, as radiocarbon dating techniques are less accurate over this period. The lichens most commonly used for lichenometry are those of the genera Rhizocarpon (e.g. the species Rhizocarpon geographicum) and Xanthoria. The measured growth rates of R. geographicum tends to fall within the range of 0.9 - 0.3 millimeter per year, depending on several factors, including the size of the lichen patch. It was first employed by Knut F√¶gri in 1933, though the first exclusively lichenometric paper was not published until 1950, by Austrian Roland BeschelBeschel R. (1950). \\"Flechten als Altersmasstab rezenter Mor√§nen\\". Zeitschrift f√ºr Gletscherkunde und Glazialgeologie 1: 152‚Äì161.

Lichenometric studies on moraines in the Polar Urals. It has also been explored as a tool in assessing the speed of glacier retreat due to climate change. Among the potential problems of the technique are the difficulty of correctly identifying the species, delay between exposure and colonization, varying growth rates from region to region as well as the fact that growth rates are not always constant over time, dependence of the rate of growth upon substrate texture and composition, climate, and determining which lichen is the largest. Methods Xanthoria elegans was one of the first lichens used for lichenometry. Several methods exist for dating surfaces with help of lichenometry; the most simple relies on a single largest lichen while other methods use more. There are also differences in the way the lichen is measured; while some suggest that the largest diameter should be measured, other scientists prefer the diameter of the largest inscribed circle. A problem in dating lichens is the fact that several thalli can fuse together, making several minor lichens appears as a larger one of older age.Lichen, Lichenometry and Global Warming Lichenometrist Tom Bradwell has listed the following five method families as the principal ones into which most other methods can be classified: *Largest lichen (LL): When the single largest lichen of a species is used it means that the lichen that is oldest or grows in most favorable conditions is used to date the minimum age of the exposed surface. This was the original lichenometric from which others then developed or used as reference. Despite relying upon a single lichen this technique is praised for its simplicity and allows obtaining an image of the age of rock exposure while still in the field.Bradwell, Tom 2009. Lichenometric Dating: A commentary in the light of some recent statistical studies. Geografiska Annaler. *Largest five lichens (5LL): This method is a development of the LL and was developed in the 1970s to avoid reliance on one single potentially anomalous lichen. It has been proved that neither accuracy nor precision improves significantly by having more than five lichens. *Fixed-area largest lichen (FALL): This technique was initially specially designed for dating rockfalls and talus cones with no uniform age of deposition. The largest thallus in a unit area is measured. The sample areas are usually boulders with surfaces of about 1 m¬≤. *Size-frequency approach (SF): The analysis of size and frequency of lichens was initially done in order to study lichen populations and preexisting thalli growing on surfaces, but has since been used as an effective absolute and relative dating method. *Lichen cover approach (LC): This method works with the premise of that the area covered by a single species will increase over time, and by measuring the total area percentage covered by a certain lichen species the age of exposure can be inferred.

He made 61 international appearances for the Scotland national team. The Doddie Weir Cup is named after him. Early life Weir was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, and was educated at Daniel Stewart's and Melville College. He studied at the Scottish Agricultural College from 1988 to 1991, gaining a Higher National Diploma. Rugby Union career=Amateur career Weir started playing rugby for Stewart's Melville FP RFC, He then played for Melrose RFC in the Borders and was part of the team that won six Scottish club championships. Professional career He later moved to England in 1995 to join the Newcastle Falcons and was part of the Premiership winning side of 1997‚Äì98. He also started the victorious 2001 Anglo-Welsh Cup final. He moved back to Scotland to join the newly reformed Borders team in 2002 where he remained until his retirement from professional rugby. He finished his playing career together with Gary Armstrong at the Border Reivers in 2004. International career Weir's first appearance for Scotland was on 10 November 1990 against at Murrayfield Stadium. A mainstay of the team throughout the 1990s, he was a fan favourite of the Murrayfield crowd. In 1997 he was the first recipient of the Famous Grouse Scotland Player of the Five Nations Award. He was once described by commentator Bill McLaren as being \\"On the charge like a mad giraffe\\". A lineout specialist, he was selected as part of the British and Irish Lions tour of South Africa in 1997. Whilst on the tour he suffered a serious knee injury, as a result of foul play, while playing against Mpumalanga Province. His time in the national side declined in later years as the next generation of locks emerged, with the likes of Stuart Grimes and eventual Scotland cap record holder Scott Murray coming into the team. His final appearance was in the Six Nations Championship match against France at Murrayfield, on 4 March 2000. He won 61 Scottish caps, scoring 19 points from four tries (his first scoring four points under the old scoring system). After playing career Weir went on to work for Hutchinson Environmental Solutions, a waste management company that was started by his father-in-law. Weir was given the position of commercial director. He is also active on the after-dinner speech circuit. He occasionally appears on the BBC as part of the half-time analysis during Scotland matches. Personal life In June 2017, to promote Global MND Awareness Day, Weir announced that he had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). In August, he spoke about plans to set up a foundation named 'My Name'5 Doddie' in order to \\"raise funds for research into a cure for MND and to provide grants to people living with the condition\\". A new tartan was designed by Doddie in collaboration with Berwickshire-based clothes firm ScotlandShop, in a bid to raise cash for his motor neurone disease research charity. The tartan features colours from the teams he played for: black and yellow of Melrose, blue and white of Scotland, and black of the former and white of the latter are also intended as a reference to his seven years with Newcastle Falcons.My Name's Doddie: The Autobiography was published on 25 October 2018 through Black & White Publishing. On 31 October 2018, Weir appeared on BBC One's The One Show, where he stated that his charity had now raised over ¬£1 million. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to rugby, to motor neurone disease research and to the community in the Scottish Borders. Named in his honour, the Doddie Weir Cup is a perpetual rugby union trophy for matches played between Scotland and Wales; including those matches played in the Six Nations. In December 2019, Weir was announced as the recipient of the Helen Rollason Award, which is presented every year during the annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year show.

He is best known for cancelling cult favorite Freaks and Geeks after its debut season. Early life Ancier graduated from the Lawrenceville School in 1975 and Princeton University in 1979. He began his broadcasting career as a high school sophomore in 1972, working as a reporter for NBC radio affiliates WBUD- AM and WBJH-FM in Trenton, New Jersey. In radio, he created American Focus, a weekly national interview program carried by over 300 radio stations in the U.S., including New York's WNBC, under the non-profit Focus on Youth. Ancier served as executive producer and host of over 250 episodes through 1979, each featuring a full-length career retrospective interview with guests ranging from Ayn Rand to Henry Fonda to David Brinkley. The show continued production for 17 years. Other guests included presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald R. Ford, George H.W. Bush, and Caspar W. Weinberger, Lucille Ball, Howard Cosell, Henry Fonda, Tom Wolfe and Pete Rose. Five hundred of its programs were given to what is now known as the Paley Center for Media in 1984. Career Ancier's network television career began in 1979 when NBC Entertainment president Brandon Tartikoff hired him as a program associate. He rose through the ranks and supervised production of the network's top comedies including The Cosby Show, Cheers, Family Ties and Golden Girls. In 1986, Barry Diller, Jamie Kellner and Rupert Murdoch tapped the then 28-year-old Ancier to be the founding entertainment president for the new Fox Broadcasting Company, where he put 21 Jump Street, Married... with Children, The Simpsons and In Living Color on the air. Ancier went from Fox (resigning March 1, 1989) to Disney as president of network television for Walt Disney Studios on April 18, 1989. He developed Home Improvement and oversaw Disney's signature franchise The Magical World of Disney, hosted by Disney CEO Michael Eisner. From October 1991 through July 1992, Ancier served as the television consultant to the Democratic National Committee, specifically to advise on the television presentation of the Democratic Convention in New York City and reporting to DNC Chairman Ron Brown. In that role, Ancier introduced political convention format innovations, such as a 56-screen \\"videowall\\" integrated into the convention podium and program, to such forums for the first time. Also in late 1992, Ancier co-created and executive produced Ricki Lake with former Donahue producer Gail Steinberg. The tabloid talk show aired for 11 seasons from 1993 to 2004. In 1994, Ancier re-teamed with Fox colleague Jamie Kellner and Warner Bros. CEO Barry Meyer to launch The WB as its chief programmer from 1994 to 1999, where he helped put 7th Heaven, Dawson's Creek, Charmed, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Steve Harvey Show and The Jamie Foxx Show on the air. Beginning in May 1999, Ancier served as president of NBC Entertainment, where he helped put The West Wing and Law & Order: SVU on the air, while conversely being the one who cancelled the 1999 teen drama-comedy series Freaks and Geeks, a move over which in 2014 he wrote that it was \\"an awful decision that has haunted me forever\\". Ancier was forced out from NBC in November 2000. Ancier returned to what had become AOL Time Warner in 2001 as EVP, Programming for Turner Broadcasting (including the WB) and programmed CNN, TBS, TNT, etc., where he launched CNN's American Morning and its signature 10PM newscast with Anderson Cooper, as well as expanded Adult Swim on Cartoon Network by acquiring the then-cancelled Family Guy series from 20th Century Fox. Ancier returned to The WB as Co-Chairman in September 2003, then became the Chairman of the WB Television Network from May 2004 until its merger with UPN to form The CW in September 2006, during which Supernatural and One Tree Hill were launched. He was transferred to run In2TV, the Warners/AOL broadband television network. Through the Garth Ancier Company, he was developing a talk show at the pilot stage while negotiating a potential network, cable and first-run syndicated shows deal with Telepictures and Warner Horizon as of October 2006. He served as first president of BBC Worldwide America from February 2007-March 2010, where he launched Top Gear, Torchwood, and DC produced BBC World News America (BBC's first US produced daily newscast) on BBC America. Ancier also moved BBC's iconic Doctor Who series from the Syfy network to BBC America and prepared CBeebies for a US launch. Ancier was able to increase by 78% BBC Worldwide America's profit and was to continue to hold a director's seat on its board after his departure from management was planned for March 2010. In April 2013, Ancier formed Zeus Media Partners, Inc. as a retro cable network company to provide four decade focused channels (1960s-1990s), later called The Quad.

It was the state committee for material technical supply in the Soviet Union. It was charged with the primary responsibility for the allocation of producer goods to enterprises, a critical state function in the absence of markets. Gossnab was one of more than twenty state committees under the Council of Ministers, the administrative arm of the Soviet government, along with other economic organs such as Gosplan (the state planning committee) and Gosbank (the state bank). Created amid a series of economic reforms implemented under Premier Alexei Kosygin in the mid-1960s, Gossnab coordinated the allocation of resources not handled by Gosplan. Gossnab had mixed success in creating a wholesale trade system, based on direct contracts between suppliers and users. Narkomprod Originally founded in 1917 as the People's Commissariat for Food Supplies (, translit. Narodny Commissariat Prodovolstviya, often abbreviated as Narkomprod) was the People's Commissariat (ministry) of the Russian SFSR in charge of food supplies and industrial goods. The first Commissar was Ivan Teodorovich. There were several subsidiary organisations: * 1918 - 1919 - Central Procurement Bureau (Tsentrozakup) * 1917 - 1918 - Special Commissioner for the Supply of Food for Workers in Enterprises Preparing Fuel for the Country (Khleboles) * 1918 - 1920 - General Directorate of the Distribution Products (Glavproduct) * 1918 - 1920 - Extraordinary Regional Committee for Food and Supply of the South of Russia (Chokprod) * 1918 - 1919 - United bureaus of Russian food and cooperative organizations for food * 1919 - 1922 - Central Commission for the Supply of Workers (Tsekorabsnab) The Narkomprod was responsible in June 1918 for the attempted organisation of 'committees of the poor' in provincial villages. This was an attempt to encourage a 'class war' in the countryside but it did not materialise, mainly because the peasants were not resentful of 'kulaks' (rich peasants) as there was a tendency for all peasants to have the same interests (for example, their own land ownership).

Tabgha (, al- Tabigha; , Ein Sheva which means \\"spring of seven\\") is an area situated on the north-western shore of the Sea of Galilee in Israel. It is traditionally accepted as the place of the miracle of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes () and the fourth resurrection appearance of Jesus () after his Crucifixion. Between the Late Muslim period and 1948, it was the site of a Palestinian Arab village. Etymology The site's name is derived from the Greek name Heptapegon (\\"seven springs\\"). The name was later shortened to \\"Tapego\\", and was eventually changed to \\"Tabgha\\" in Arabic, since Classical Arabic has no p, g and o sounds and replaces these sounds by b, gh and a or u. St. Jerome referred to Heptapegon as \\"the wilderness/lonely place\\" (er√™mos, as the location is also described in the Gospels). History=Byzantine period In the Byzantine period, the water of the springs at Heptapegon was collected in three water towers (Birket Ali edh-Dhaher at Ein Nur Spring, Hammam Ayyub, and Tannur Ayub) and sent via an aqueduct to the Plain of Ginosar, where it was used for irrigation; the three towers seem to be recorded in the mosaic floor of the 5th-century Church of the Multiplication at Tabgha.[Stefano De Luca, Capernaum, paragraph on Tabgha, in The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Bible and Archaeology, vol. 1, p. 179, New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2013] A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed Tabgha, marked by the word Moulin (mill in French).Karmon, 1960, p. 166. The 4th-century tower-like octagonal reservoir at Ein Nur Spring and the aqueduct it connected to are traditionally attributed to Ali, a son of the 18th-century ruler Dhaher (or Zahir) al-Umar. The reservoir is locally known as Birket Ali edh-Dhaher, \\"Pool of Ali edh-Dhaher\\". In 1881, the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) stated that the masonry of the structures indicates an Arab origin, thus agreeing with this tradition.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 371 Crusader period The area now taken by the Church of St Peter's Primacy was known during the Crusader period as Mensa Christi, or Mensa Domini.Khalidi, 1992, p. 542Pringle, 1998, pp. 334- 339 Ottoman period In 1596, as Al-Tabigha was part of the Ottoman Empire, a village was recorded, Tabiga, in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira under the liwa' (\\"district\\") of Safad, with a population of 8 households, an estimated 44 persons, all Muslims. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on goats, beehives and orchards; a total of 3,290 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 176. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 542.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 Johann Ludwig Burckhardt described the place as having a few houses and a mill, where the inhabitants were fishermen.Burckhardt, 1822, p. 318, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 542 In 1838 Edward Robinson found here a small village, with one or two mills, built by Zahir al-Umar, but by then belonging to the government.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, pp. 297-8, cited in Khalidi, 1992, p. 542 British Mandate period In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Tabagha had a population of 175; 157 Muslims and 18 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Tiberias, p. 39 (17 Roman Catholics and one Syrian Catholic).Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 51 By the 1931 census the population had increased to 245; 223 Muslims, 21 Christians, and 1 Jew, in a total of 53 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 85 The number of people had increased to 330; 310 Muslims and 20 Christians, when the last census was made in the 1945 statistics. That number included Tell el Hunud and Khan el Minya. The total land area was 5 389 dunams. In 1944/45 the village had 7 dunams used for citrus and bananas, 287 were plantations and irrigated land, 2,728 used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 123 while 2,367 dunams were classified as non-cultivable land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 173 On May 4, 1948, in Operation Broom, just before the outbreak of the Arab-Israeli war, Tabgha was attacked by Palmah forces, supported by the Alexandroni Brigades and local Hagana units. Its Arab inhabitants were expelled and their houses and tents were destroyed under orders by Yigal Allon.Morris, 2004, p. 250.note 695, Morris, 2004, p. 302 Church of the Multiplication The earliest building at Tabgha was a small chapel built in the 4th century A.D. (around 350) by the Jewish convert to Christianity, Joseph of Tiberias. According to Epiphanius, Joseph was a contemporary of Emperor Constantine, a Rabbinical scholar, member of the Sanhedrin and a disciple of Hillel II. Following his conversion, Emperor Constantine gave him the rank of count (comes), and gave him permission to build churches in the Galilee, specifically, in Jewish towns which didn't yet have a Christian community, and the Galilee including the Sea of Galilee, was an area with a Jewish majority. This was probably the shrine described by the pilgrim Egeria at the end of the 4th century. The 4th century small shrine was dismantled in 480 and a bigger chapel was built by Martyrius of Jerusalem, Patriarch of Jerusalem from 478 to 486. Martyrius was Egyptian by origin, and this may be the reason why the floor of his chapel was covered with a beautiful Nile mosaic, a style of art popular in the Byzantine time, describing Nilotic landscape and the fest of the Nile. Mosaic of fish and bread on the church floor. The mosaic of the fish and loaves is laid next to a large rock, which has caused some New Testament scholars to speculate that the builders of the original church believed that Jesus stood on this rock when he blessed the fish and loaves just before the feeding of the crowd who had come to hear him. The large monastery and a church were built in the fifth century. While some date the destruction of the site to the time of the Arab conquest, the church was most likely destroyed in 614 during the Persian invasion, for already in AD 670, Bishop Arculf had reported that only columns from the church remained. In any way, by the Crusader conquests the Byzantine site was forgotten, and rediscovered only in the 20th century. The area's lands were bought in the 18th century by a Catholic German association, so they could build a hotel for pilgrims. As they began digging for the construction they discovered archaeological evidence of an earlier church, but could not make excavations due to the Ottoman law. Only in 1932, in the times of Mandatory Palestine. After nearly 1300 years of \\"solitude\\", two German archaeologists (Mader and Schneider) uncovered a number of the Byzantine church's walls and mosaics In 1981, after further excavations, the church was finally restored by German Benedictines to its Byzantine form, incorporating portions of the original mosaics. The windows are fitted with alabaster panels. Today, the church and surrounding land are property of the German Association of the Holy Land (:de:Deutscher Verein vom Heiligen Lande) whose head is the Archbishop of Cologne. The site is maintained by Benedictine monks from the Dormition Abbey, which is located on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. Arson attack On 18 June 2015, vandals started a fire that damaged the church and left Hebrew graffiti denouncing the worship of \\"idols.\\" Israeli Minister of Public Security, Gilad Erdan, released a statement condemning the attack, saying \\"The torching of the church is a cowardly and despicable act which contradicts Israel's basic values.\\" Adviser to the Catholic Church in Israel says the economic damage to the site could be \\"in the millions [of shekels].\\" Investigations by the Israeli police and internal security service led to the arrest and indictment of extremist Jewish Israeli youths associated with the \\"Price-Tag\\" movement, whose trial is still ongoing as of July 2016.Dormition Abbey website, news page. Accessed 25 July 2016 As promised by Israeli president Reuven Rivlin and the Israeli government shortly after the arson attack, and following negotiations with the Ministry of Finance, first compensation payments were made in July 2016. Together with donations from Germany and the Benedictines, this allowed for the start of restoration works, which finish in the end of February 2017. Church of the Primacy of St. Peter Church of the Primacy of St. Peter The Church of the Primacy of St. Peter, just south of the Church of the Multiplication, was built on rocks at the shore of the Sea of Galilee, traditionally considered to be the place where Jesus appeared the fourth time after his resurrection (), during which, according to Catholic teaching, Jesus again conferred primacy on Simon Peter. Endemic blind shrimp at Tabgha pool The critically endangered, troglobitic, blind shrimp Typhlocaris galilea is endemic to Ein-Nur, a warm sulfuric and saline spring at Tabgha, whose water is collected inside a Byzantine 4th-century octagonal water tower. The shrimp is the most advanced species of a rare type of ecosystem, and the highest link in its food chain, at whose base stands a chemoautotrophic bacterium that can synthesise all necessary organic compounds using the sulfur from the spring water as its only source of energy, taking over the role played in most ecosystems by photosynthesising plants.

He was born at Byfleet, Surrey and died at Stockcross, Berkshire. As a cricketer, George Mann was a right-handed middle-order batsman. His father, Frank Mann, also captained England, making them the first father and son to both captain England. Colin and Chris Cowdrey are the only other father and son to have done this for England. Early life and education Mann was born on 6 September 1917 in Byfleet, Surrey, England.'MANN, (Francis) George', Who Was Who, A & C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 1920‚Äì2016; online edn, Oxford University Press, 2014; online edn, April 2014 accessed 24 Nov 2017 The son of Frank Mann, he was the brother of John Pelham Mann. He was educated at Eton College, an all-boys public school, and captained the school's cricket XI in 1936. He was also a member of the Eton College Contingent of the Officer Training Corps, and reached the rank of cadet under- officer. He studied at Pembroke College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. While at Cambridge, he earned two cricketing blues, having represented the university in 1938 and 1939. Military service Mann served in the British Army during the Second World War, having joined up before the outbreak of war. On 8 July 1939, he was commissioned in the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant. He transferred to the Scots Guards on 13 March 1940. He was awarded the Military Cross (MC) in 1942. On 28 June 1945, the then temporary major Mann was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) \\"in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Italy\\". Mann maintained his links with the army after the war. On 8 July 1949, he was moved from the Supplementary Reserve of Officers to the Regular Army Reserve of Officers, and was granted the honorary rank of major. Having reached the age limit, he resigned his commission on 6 September 1967 and was permitted to retain his honorary rank. Cricketing career Mann captained England in each of his seven Test matches, winning two, and drawing the other five; his father had also been captain in every Test he played in. Wisden said of Mann: \\"as a captain he was ideal, zealous to a degree, and considerate in all things at all times\\". After leading England in South Africa in 1948/49, Mann led his side for two Tests in the following summer, before he stood down, citing inability to participate regularly due to his family's brewing business commitments (Mann, Crossman & Paulin). Mann was chairman of the Test and County Cricket Board (TCCB) from 1978 to 1983. He was therefore chairman during the controversy over the rebel tour which Geoff Boycott and Graham Gooch led to South Africa in 1982. Later life Mann was a main board director and retained his position on the new company board when his family brewery merged with Watney Combe & Reid in 1958. He was non-executive Deputy Chairman of the Extel Group from 1980 to 1986. Mann died on 8 August 2001 in Stockcross, Berkshire, England. Personal life In 1949, Mann married Margaret Hildegarde Marshall Clark. Together they had four children: three sons and one daughter. His wife predeceased him, dying in 1995. Mann's son, Simon, was sentenced for thirty-four years in Equatorial Guinea in 2008, on charges related to an attempted coup in 2004, but was pardoned on 2 November 2009.

The distinction became obsolete with the introduction of subscriber trunk dialling. History In North America, under the purview of the Bell System, local telephone calls were typically unmetered and included in flat rate billing. The term toll calling was adopted for long-distance calls which were subject to toll charges. In the UK, all calls were chargeable and the term trunk calling was adopted for long-distance calls. Initially a trunk call had to be booked in advance and a switchboard operator called the subscriber when the call set-up was completed; a process known as 'delay working'. Due to increasing demands for trunk calls from London and the associated delays in connecting them, calls to exchanges adjacent to the London director area were transferred to a new Toll exchange opened on 17 September 1921. Calls to toll area exchanges were connected on-demand whilst the originating subscriber waited thus improving service and reducing operator costs. The London Toll Area boundary was extended in 1923 and again in 1928, so that eventually Southampton, Portsmouth, Reading, Bedford, Colchester and the whole of Kent and Sussex were included. The system was later introduced to other large cities and remained in use until the late 1950s when, with the advent of Subscriber Trunk Dialling (STD), Toll was eventually phased out. The name toll was probably taken from US usage. In the London telephone area, calls to subscribers who were not serviced by Director telephone systems within local call-charging range of the London Director exchange area were carried by tandem exchange Toll A: a subscriber would dial a prefix code, typically two letters plus zero, one or two figures (e.g. DA, EP5, LK85) followed by the number of the other subscriber on the fringe non-director exchange. To avoid confusion, three-letter dialling codes were not used for calls from the director area to the fringe area, even if they corresponded to the same holes in the dial (e.g. the Hoddesdon and Mogador codes were HO3 and MO4 respectively). Calls from fringe non-director exchanges to numbers within the director area were passed in two ways. For those to director exchanges near the area boundary adjacent to the non-director exchange, subscribers were often given numerical codes to dial, and told to follow the code with the numerical portion of the other subscriber's number: these direct routings permitted the use of short unamplified lines. For director exchanges remote from the area boundary, the subscriber was told to dial a code (typically 7, 87 or exceptionally 1), to wait for a second dialling tone, and to follow this with the three letters and four figures of the other number. These calls were handled by tandem exchange Toll B, from which the second dialling tone originated. To have a second dialling tone in this way was very unusual on the PSTN in the UK, although the French and Belgian PTTs had a similar instruction for when their customers made international calls. The distinction between trunk and toll became irrelevant when subscriber trunk dialling was introduced.

He was a genuine all-rounder, batting right-handed and bowling either right-arm medium pace or leg break and googly. Brown was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1933, but his career declined thereafter until he was made captain of Northamptonshire and England in 1949. Brown was an England selector from 1951 to 1953 and Chairman of Selectors in 1953 when England regained the Ashes. Subsequently, he was involved in cricket administration including tour management. He was elected President of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1971‚Äì72 and Chairman of the Cricket Council in 1977. He was awarded the MBE in 1942 for his gallantry in the evacuation of the British Army from Crete and the CBE in 1980 for services to cricket. Early life and development as a cricketer Brown was the son of Roger Grounds Brown, an English businessman in Peru who was a keen cricketer, opening the batting and taking 5/50 for Lima Cricket and Football Club against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1926‚Äì27. Brown's sister Aline was a left-handed batter for the Women's Cricket Association from 1934 to 1948 and, later, his sons Richard Philip and Christopher Frederick played minor cricket. Brown was naturally left-handed, but forced to use his \\"proper\\" right hand from an early age, fortunately without affecting his cricket. He was educated at the Saint Peter's School in Chile, where he played little cricket, and from 1921 at St Piran's school in Maidenhead, where he was taught googly bowling by South African all-rounder Aubrey Faulkner.Fingleton, p.124. In 1925, Brown moved to The Leys School in Cambridge and topped the school batting and bowling averages. He continued his studies at St John's College, Cambridge and played for Cambridge University Cricket Club, making his debut in 1930. First-class career=Pre-war years Brown scored 52 against the 1930 Australians and took 5/9 against the Free Foresters in the following match, bowling leg-spin. His first century was 150 against Surrey at The Oval, sharing a partnership of 257 for the seventh wicket. He scored his second century in his next innings, making 140 against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at The Saffrons. At the end of the season, he was top of the Cambridge batting averages. In 1931, Brown continued to play for Cambridge, taking 5/153 against Oxford University when Iftikhar Ali Khan Pataudi made 238 not out. Brown joined Surrey and ended the season with 107 wickets at an average of 22.65 runs per wicket. He was called up to play against New Zealand in two Test matches; he did not bat in the rain-affected series but took three wickets and held one catch. In 1932, Brown took 120 wickets at 20.46 and made 1,135 runs at 32.42. He made his highest first-class score of 212 against Middlesex at The Oval, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack commenting on \\"a glorious display of fearless hitting\\" with two sixes out of the ground, another five into the stands and fifteen fours. Brown played against India at Lord's, taking three wickets and scoring 1 and 29. He was subsequently selected for the 1932‚Äì33 MCC tour of Australia under his Surrey captain Douglas Jardine. He played in none of the controversial \\"Bodyline\\" Tests against Australia, playing only in state matches.Kay, p. 29.Fingleton, p. 27. He played in the two Tests in New Zealand, scoring 74 in 83 minutes in the first Test at Lancaster Park, but was dropped from the England team for its 1933 matches. Brown was chosen as one of the 1933 Wisden Cricketers of the Year for his \\"double\\" of 100 wickets and 1,000 runs in 1932. He played less cricket after 1933 but was recalled for the second Test against New Zealand in 1937 when he hit 57 with a six and 8 fours and took 3/81 and 1/14. He was dropped again and it was thought that his Test career was over. His career-best bowling was 8/34, achieved against Somerset just two weeks before the Second World War began. Brown took a commission in the Royal Army Service Corps. He helped evacuate the British Army from Crete in 1941 for which he was awarded the MBE in the 1942 New Year Honours List. He played cricket with Lindsay Hassett in Cairo, but was captured with Bill Bowes at Tobruk in 1942 and spent the rest of the war in prisoner-of-war camps in Italy and Germany, where they organised games of cricket, baseball and rugby. He lost over 60lbs (30 kilos) before being liberated by the Americans in 1945.Fingleton, pp. 27‚Äì30. Career revival Brown became a medium-paced seamer after the war and organised cricket while working as a welfare officer in a Doncaster colliery. When the coal mines were nationalised Brown lost his job and became the captain and assistant-secretary of Northamptonshire County Cricket Club (Northants) in 1949.Fingleton, pp.30‚Äì31. This revitalised his career as he scored 1,077 runs at 24.47 and took 111 wickets at 27.00 in 1949, Northants improving from seventeenth and last place in the 1948 County Championship to sixth in 1949.Barclay's World of Cricket, pp.438‚Äì441. As a result, Brown was asked to captain England in the last two Tests against New Zealand, taking two wickets and four catches in a 0‚Äì0 series draw. In 1950, he scored 1,108 runs at 38.20 and took 77 wickets at 28.38. When George Mann and Norman Yardley turned down the captaincy of the 1950‚Äì51 tour of Australia, Brown came into consideration and was made captain of the Gentleman against Players at Lord's. He came in at 194/6 and scored 122 out of 131 runs inside two hours, including a six into the Lord's Pavilion. He followed up with three quick wickets and was offered the tour captaincy the same afternoon.Fingleton, p.71. Brown had only a modest Test career up to that point, having made only 233 runs at 23.30 and taken 14 wickets at 40.79, but this was still a time when the England captain had to be an amateur even if he was a \\"passenger\\" in terms of ability. Brown was made captain for the last Test against the West Indies with England already 2‚Äì1 down in the series; they lost the final Test by an innings, which did not bode well for the team in Australia. Australia and New Zealand 1950‚Äì51 Bill Ferguson (scorer), Bob Berry, Arthur McIntyre (wk), Trevor Bailey, Gilbert Parkhouse and Eric Hollies; Middle Row: John Dewes, David Sheppard, John Warr, Alec Bedser, Brian Close, Reg Simpson and Doug Wright; and Front Row: Brigadier Michael Green (manager), Cyril Washbrook, Denis Compton (vc), Freddie Brown (c), Len Hutton, Godfrey Evans (wk) and John Nash (assistant-manager). The 1950‚Äì51 England team under Brown's captaincy was regarded as one of the weakest sent to Australia and John Kay commented that without the key players Alec Bedser and Len Hutton, England's standard would have been little better than that of a club team.Kay, p. 220. England lost the Test series 4‚Äì1, their only victory being a consolation win in the final Test. Despite his team's poor performance, the forty-year-old Brown enjoyed personal success and won considerable popularity among Australian supporters with his determination to fight on regardless of the odds. Unexpectedly, he scored 210 runs at 26.25 and took 18 wickets at 21.61 in the series, coming third in the England batting averages after Hutton and Reg Simpson and third in the bowling averages after Bedser and Trevor Bailey.Wisden 1952, pp. 795‚Äì96. Despite his determination, Brown was an unsuccessful captain and his greatest mistake was to move Hutton down the batting order from one to six in a bid to strengthen the lower order: the result was that Hutton ran out of partners three times in the first two Tests. Kay summarised the tour as \\"one long succession of inglorious displays that had riled the critics without exception\\".Kay, p. 128. The team's poor fielding came in for especial criticism and earned them the nickname of Brown's Cows.Fingleton, pp.61‚Äì66. However, Bill O'Reilly wrote that Brown did a magnificent job as both player and captain through his unselfish devotion to the job, earning the admiration of the Australian supporters.O'Reilly, p. 153. The first Test at Woolloongabba was decided by a torrential rainstorm which flooded the ground after Australia had scored 228 and turned the wicket into a \\"sticky dog\\". Brown had bowled well, taking 2/63 in support of Bedser and Bailey. In the changed conditions, Brown gambled on a declaration at 68/7 so that the Australians would have to bat on the wet pitch before it dried out. Predictably, Australia's batting collapsed and their captain Lindsay Hassett declared at 32/7 to make England bat again. Brown missed an opportunity to save time when he misunderstood how long it took to roll the pitch, given that the ground still used a horse-drawn heavy roller. Next morning, England were all out for 122 and lost by 70 runs.Fingleton, pp.75‚Äì85.O'Reilly, pp.35‚Äì41. In the second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, Australia were dismissed for 194 and England were reduced to 54/5 before Brown came in to top-score with 62 in England's 197. He won the crowd over with this innings, especially when he hit Ian Johnson straight down the ground for six and through the covers for four. He bowled well and took 4/26 as Australia were out for 181, but England could only score 150 as the hosts won by 28 runs to take a 2‚Äì0 lead in the series.Fingleton, pp. 100‚Äì117. In the third Test, Brown made his highest Test score of 79 with another defiant innings after England had been reduced to 137/4. Injuries to Bailey and Doug Wright seriously depleted England's bowling and Brown had to bowl 44 overs to support Bedser and debutant John Warr. He took a commendable 4/153 as Australia totalled 426 before bowling England out again to win the match by an innings and secure the series victory.Fingleton, pp. 141‚Äì146. The remainder of the series was an anti-climax and Australia won the fourth Test by 274 runs before England restored some pride with a consolation win in the final Test. During the fourth Test, Brown was hospitalised after a motor accident and was unfit to continue playing. He relinquished the captaincy to vice-captain Denis Compton who became the first professional England captain since Jack Hobbs in 1924‚Äì25,O'Reilly, p. 185. Brown was fit to play in the final Test at Melbourne and achieved his best Test bowling figures of 5/49, including a spell of 3/0. England won by 8 wickets, the first Test Australia had lost since 1938.Fingleton, pp. 208‚Äì211O'Reilly, pp. 150‚Äì151. Brown scored 62 against New Zealand in the drawn first Test at Christchurch. He scored 47 and 10 not out in the low-scoring second Test at Basin Reserve, which England won by 6 wickets to give them a 1‚Äì0 series win. Later years Brown was retained as England captain against South Africa on his return and was made a Test selector.Wisden 1952, p. 1002. South Africa won the first Test and England the second by 10 wickets. Brown scored 42 out of 211 in the low-scoring third Test, which England won by 9 wickets and took 3/107 in the drawn fourth Test. England sealed a 3‚Äì1 series victory with a four-wicket win in the fifth Test, Brown scoring 40.\\"South Africans in England, 1951\\", Wisden 1952, pp. 209‚Äì57. He made 940 runs at 33.57 in 1951 and took 66 wickets at 23.37. In 1952, he came close to making a double with 1,073 runs at 28.23 and 95 wickets at 24.77. Now 41 years old, Brown retired from the England captaincy and was succeeded by the professional Len Hutton. In his final first-class season, 1953, Brown scored 849 runs (24.97) and took 87 wickets (20.74). He was appointed chairman of the selection committee and recalled himself for the second Test against Australia at the age of 42, agreeing to play just one Test on the request of Len Hutton.Synge, p. 114. Ray Lindwall recalled that most of the England players remembered Brown as captain and called him Skipper out of habit, even the new captain Hutton.Lindwall, p. 114. Brown scored 22 runs off 14 balls in the first innings and Lindwall says he \\"pitched and turned his leg-breaks on a good length equally well from either end\\" to take 4/82.Lindwall, p.60. When Hutton damaged a finger trying to take a catch, Brown took over in the field.Synge, p. 117. The match ended in a draw and was his last Test and Brown effectively retired from cricket at the end of the 1953 season, though he made occasional reappearances until 1961. He worked as an administrator, tour manager and radio commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio and wrote his autobiography Cricket Musketeer in 1954. Brown managed two England tours: South Africa in 1956‚Äì67, in which the Test series was drawn 2‚Äì2; and Australia and New Zealand in 1958‚Äì59, in which England lost the Ashes to Australia 4‚Äì0. In Australia, Brown wanted to make an official complaint about the bowling action of Ian Meckiff, which was widely considered illegal, but team captain Peter May insisted on a diplomatic approach. This failed when the Australian chairman of selectors, Sir Donald Bradman retorted that England must put its own house in order, referring to the dubious actions of Tony Lock and Peter Loader. Brown was the manager of the Rest of the World cricket team in England in 1970 after the scheduled South African tour was cancelled for political reasons.Swanton, p. 144. He was President of MCC in 1971‚Äì72. He later served the National Cricket Association and the English Schools Cricket Association. In 1977, Brown was Chairman of the Cricket Council, in which capacity he removed Tony Greig from the England captaincy in the World Series Cricket crisis.Synge, p. 165. He was awarded the CBE for services to cricket in the 1980 Queen's Birthday Honours List. Style and technique Brown was a leg- spinner in his youth, but turned to medium paced bowling after the war. He was able to turn or cut the ball with his large hands and was a wicket taker rather than a container of batsmen, but sometimes lost his line and length. As a pace bowler he was more accurate, was able to tie down even the best batsmen and proved adept at breaking solid partnerships. In particular he was able to dismiss the stonewalling Australian captain Lindsay Hassett. He still used his leg-spin when required by conditions or the frailties of the batsmen, sometimes mixing them up in the same over. His bucket hands made him a good catcher and he once caught and bowled Keith Miller in both innings of a Test, so the Australian all-rounder nicknamed him 'C and B'. As a batsman he stuck to the simple expedient of blocking the good balls and thumping the bad ones. With his height, weight and strength he could strike the ball as hard as anyone and once hit a six into the Lord's Pavilion. His first-class centuries were noted for their plentiful boundaries and this was another reason why his was popular with the crowds. Like many amateur captains, Brown was happy to take advice from his senior professionals and O'Reilly says he \\"conferred with Len Hutton before he made a bowling change...there was little room for doubt...that Brown had tremendous respect for Hutton's advice on the cricket field\\".O'Reilly, p. 25. He was also one of the selectors who took the radical step of making Hutton England captain, the first professional to be appointed to the position since 1877. Brown's combative captaincy is best remembered for leading poor teams regardless of the odds, Northants in 1949‚Äì53 and England in 1950‚Äì51, where he laid the foundations for future success. Allen Synge wrote that Brown as captain in the field took \\"impressive charge\\" and it was noticeable that players obeyed his commanding gestures \\"at the double\\".Synge, p. 116. On the 1950‚Äì51 tour, Brown allowed the team to socialize more than previous captains had done and saw no reason why he should insist that amateur undergraduates should mix awkwardly with working class professionals, or that veterans should accompany their younger teammates.Fingleton, pp.58‚Äì60. This led to the usual stories of dissension in the ranks when a team performs badly and Brown hotly denied this. Personality There are widely contrasting views about Brown's personality. He was well-liked in Australia when he captained England there in 1950‚Äì51 as recorded by O'Reilly (see above). According to Kay, Brown had a hearty appetite for food and drink and was combative and forceful by nature, which endeared him to the Australian public.Kay, p.33. Jack Fingleton commented: \\"With his sun-hat on, a 'kerchief tied round his neck, and ambling jovially in the field, Freddie Brown lacked only a wisp of straw in his mouth to make him look like the original Farmer Brown\\". On the other hand, professional players viewed Brown's silk neckerchief with contempt as it \\"enhanced the impression of a bumptious windbag\\".Waters, p. 148. Brown was considered \\"a bully who preyed on weakness or quirk of character\\". When the eighteen-year-old Brian Close was out to a poor stroke on his Ashes debut in 1950‚Äì51, Brown was extremely unsympathetic to Close who became distressed by his experiences on the tour. John Kay wrote Brown gave the youngsters Berry and Close \\"every encouragement and seldom complained at their repeated failures\\" and \\"the Yorkshire all-rounder was not as co-operative as he might as been\\". Brown caused problems for Fred Trueman when he managed the English cricket team in Australia in 1958‚Äì59. Trueman and others believed that people like Brown and his colleague Gubby Allen \\"epitomised the pompous nature of English cricket in the days of amateurs and professionals, gentlemen and players\\".Waters,148‚Äì149. It was not just professionals as Brown quarreled with the amateur Trevor Bailey, which led to long-standing mutual antipathy.Miller, p.80. In Trueman's autobiography, he refers to Brown as \\"a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot\\".Trueman, p. 219. Trueman made a formal complaint about Brown to the team captain, Peter May. Although May was another public school-educated amateur, he supported Trueman and told Brown to \\"act in a manner befitting someone with managerial responsibility\\".Waters, p. 149. Tom Graveney commented on the lack of team spirit on the tour, saying that \\"Freddie Brown, in particular, did a very bad job\\" and was rude to several team members.Waters, p. 150. Graveney called Brown \\"a very stuck-up individual ‚Äì at least when he was sober\\". Kay said Brown had a tendency to be bombastic in speech and could be forthright and ruthless, sometimes being churlish and rude to sensation-seeking reporters, but was always ready to talk amicably to genuine cricket journalists.Kay, pp.30‚Äì32.

El Universal was founded by F√©lix Palavicini and Emilio Rabasa in October 1916, in the city of Santiago de Queretaro to cover the end of the Mexican Revolution and the creation of the new Mexican Constitution. The circulation of the print edition of El Universal is more than 300,000 readers. In 2013 the El Universal website claimed to have an average of more than 16 million unique visitors each month, with 140 million page views, and 4 million followers on Facebook. Aviso Oportuno is the classifieds service of El Universal. The brand has become widely known in Mexico, and the phrase Aviso Oportuno is sometimes used as a generic term for the classifieds business. This brand has four sub-sites: Inmuebles, Veh√≠culos , Empleos and Varios (Real Estate, Vehicles, Jobs and Miscellaneous). News items are open to reader comments through a simple sign- up system which has resulted in many accusations of bias and propaganda. The system also tends towards anonymity and abuse by having questionable users and operators pass as average readers discrediting political and journalistic adversaries.  Controversies  * The publication has been accused by the political left in Mexico of having a cozy relationship with past governments during key periods in the nation's fraught history. The day after the Tlatelolco massacre on October 3, 1968, at the height of the Mexican Dirty War, El Universal published misleading headlines such as, ¬´Terrorists and Soldiers Sustain Harsh Combat During Several Hours¬ª and ¬´Tlatelolco: Battle Camp¬ª. Under pressure, the editorial board gave a statement saying, \\"With pride, we can say that 'El Universal' adequately covered the facts during those days. Perhaps, like many of the publications of our era, we had too much confidence in the word of our government, but we've been honest.\\" * On December 3, 2012, political expert and city planner Andr√©s Lajous wrote a column in Animal Pol√≠tico justifying his exit from El Universal as the editorial board had modified the title of his column titled, ¬´El robo de veh√≠culos durante el gobierno de Pe√±a Nieto¬ª (the theft of cars during the government of Pe√±a Nieto)\\", referencing President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto when he was the governor of the State of Mexico and his ties to the theft of vehicles. The column was published on April 13, 2012.http://www.eluniversalmas.com.mx/editoriales/2012/04/57992.php In his article, Lajous Loaza argues that when he tried to summon a response from the editors for the headline change, he was told that, \\"the decision was last minute and comes from the highers ups.\\" He stated that he was promised a new headline, but that nothing ever came. Because of this incident, Lajous Loaeza resigned shortly thereafter as he felt he was not guaranteed the freedom to write critical pieces about the government without editorial interference. * On December 25, 2017, the New York Times published an article titled, ¬´Using Billions in Government Cash, Mexico Controls News Media¬ª signaling El Universal as the largest beneficiary of government funds in the form of publicity and, consequently, transforming the newspaper into an attack dog for the government in power during the elections of 2018 against its adversaries. In response, the Mexican publication ran a story on December 26, 2017 in which they accuse the information obtained by The New York Times as false and biased.

As a player, he was capped three times by Japan as a scrum-half, and he also advised the Japan Rugby Football Union. He also held important posts as a banker. Shukuzawa died of a heart attack on the way back from a mountain climbing expedition in Gunma prefecture. More than four thousand people, including Seiji Hirao and Katsuyuki Kiyomiya attended the overnight wake on June 22, 2006 at Honganji temple in Tsukiji, Tokyo. Player Born in Hino, Tokyo, he began to play rugby as scrum-half at Kumagaya High School. He continued his study and rugby at Waseda University. He became the first-choice scrum-half from his first year and was instrumental in Waseda winning the Japan Rugby Football Championship title for two consecutive years. He was the captain of the team in his fourth year but failed to defend the title as Waseda was beaten by Meiji University in the final of the University Championship. He was chosen to represent Japan when in his second year at university and earned three caps. As he intended to give up playing after the graduation, he decided to join Sumitomo Bank (current Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation) that had no rugby club although he actually continued to play for a while for national duties.

He later became England's team manager. His nickname was \\"The Gnome of Essex\\", so christened by his Essex teammate, Ray East, because Fletcher's winklepickers had begun to curl up at the toes due to wear.Keith Fletcher. Cricinfo.com Cricket writer Colin Bateman noted that \\"Fletcher was a tough cookie, a shrewd man who could bluff opponents like the most disarming of poker players. He evoked loyalty in his teammates and admiration from his opponents, even when they were beaten by the sucker punch\\". Bateman added \\"the sacking of Fletcher as England captain remains one of English cricket's shabbiest sagas\\". Fletcher played 59 Test matches and 24 One Day Internationals. His Test tally of 3,272 runs came at an average of 39.90. Life and career Keith started playing for his village side while living with his parents in Caldecote, Cambridgeshire, before moving to Royston, Hertfordshire to play for the local cricket club‚Äôs second team at the age of 13. It was not long before he moved up to play for the first team. It was while playing for Royston that Fletcher hit his first-ever century, and he produced his finest bowling figures, taking 9-20 on his first-team debut. His county cricket career at Essex began at the age of 17. He toured Pakistan with the MCC Under-25 side in 1966‚Äì67, and made his England Test debut in 1968 at Headingley against Australia. A baptism of fire, he found hostility from the Yorkshire crowd who felt that Phil Sharpe should have been preferred, and Fletcher's experience was not helped by dropping regulation catches at slip. A first innings duck seemed to be the portent of his early introverted batting stints in the national team. However, Fletcher was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1974. His debut century for England did not occur until Fletcher's 20th Test appearance. He went on to score six more centuries, at a rate of one every eight Tests. His cricketing nous was used by both Tony Lewis and Tony Greig when they led the national team, but the appointment of Mike Brearley to the role in 1977 appeared to indicate that Fletcher's further involvement would be limited. Following Brearley's retirement and Ian Botham's short tenure, Fletcher re-appeared after four years away from the national team to captain the side to India in 1981‚Äì82. The series did not go well, with negative tactics from both teams, and poor umpiring decisions, which saw Fletcher flick off the bails with his bat after being given out in the Second Test. Worse was to follow for Fletcher when Geoffrey Boycott was sent home, and Fletcher's belated awareness that half of his touring party, led by his county teammate Graham Gooch, were preparing for a rebel tour to South Africa. Fletcher captaincy of England oversaw a 1‚Äì0 series defeat over six Tests against India, before a one-off Test against Sri Lanka. Fletcher took all the blame, despite turning down the chance to join the rebels himself because of his loyalty to the England cause. His was then ignominiously sacked by the chairman of selectors, Peter May. Fletcher also captained Essex successfully in two spells (1974‚Äì1985 and 1988). As Bateman noted, Fletcher \\"turned a county of cheerful losers into an even happier bunch as the most successful side in the country through the 1980s. He was awarded an OBE in the 1985 New Year Honours. From 1993 to 1995, Fletcher served as England team coach. During this period, the side played 26 Test matches, of which they lost 15 and won only five. Later, Fletcher returned to Essex as first-team coach, stepping down in 2001, to be replaced by his former teammate Graham Gooch. He is currently the manager of the Essex U15s team.

It was recorded at Slaughterhouse studios in September 1990 and produced by Bolt Thrower and Colin Richardson. It was released on Earache Records: Mosh 29 in 1991. Whereas Realm of Chaos was dominated by grindcore based blasts and riffs, this album abandons most of the grindcore influences for a sound that is more strictly death metal. Moreover, there is more melody in the music and the guitar solos, although some chaotic solos remain. This is also the final Bolt Thrower album to feature the blast beat style of drumming (which can be heard on four songs - \\"Unleashed (Upon Mankind)\\", \\"What Dwells Within\\", \\"War Master\\", and \\"Afterlife\\"), before it was abandoned and subsequently never used thereafter in the Bolt Thrower discography. \\"Cenotaph\\" is a thematic continuation of the song \\"World Eater\\" from the previous record. The closing riff from \\"World Eater\\" is the same as the opening riff from \\"Cenotaph\\" and also used in \\"Embers\\" from The IVth Crusade, ‚ÄúPowder Burns‚Äù from Mercenary and \\"The Killchain\\" from Those Once Loyal. The album was extensively sampled on Dutch breakcore producer Bong-Ra's album Full Metal Racket, with allusions also including song titles such as \\"Bloody Cenotaph\\" and \\"Jo Bench\\".http://www.discogs.com/Bong-Ra-Full-Metal-Racket/release/1110120 Track listing *All songs written by Bolt Thrower Personnel ;Bolt Thrower * Karl Willetts - vocals * Gavin Ward - guitars * Barry Thomson - guitars * Andrew Whale - drums * Jo Bench - Bass guitar ;Production * Luton Sinfield - Photography * Pete Knifton & Ian Cooke at Maxjo Graphics - Artwork and design * Colin Richardson - Producer, Recording References 1991 albums Bolt Thrower albums Combat Records albums Earache Records albums Albums produced by Colin Richardson ","title":"War Master"},{"id":"1354367","text":"The Peel Sessions 1988‚Äì90 is a Bolt Thrower album consisting of three Peel Sessions.

For this album Bolt Thrower slowed down considerably compared to War Master, focussing more on playing heavy riffs and a thick sound.

It is a Grade II* listed structure.  Opening  It was opened on 9 April 1964 and is the first cable-stayed bridge in the United Kingdom. Before its opening in 1964 the only crossings of the river Usk in central Newport were the Newport Bridge carrying the main A48 road and Newport Transporter Bridge. Many grand names were proposed for the bridge but it was eventually named after the relatively small George Street on the western bank of the River Usk.  Planning  Originally the bridge was planned to be six lanes wide, but with the M4 motorway Usk bridge already planned further upstream it was reduced to four lanes.  Continuing developments  On completion, the A48 route was diverted over the new bridge, making it the preferred route for through traffic. However, in 2004 the new City Bridge on the Southern Distributor Road further downstream became the preferred route and assumed the route number.

She was the second steamship of the United States Navy and the first to serve actively as a warship. Sea Gull was built as the river steamer Enterprise by the Connecticut Steam Boat Company, Hartford, Connecticut. She was launched in November 1818 and made her first trial run in July 1819. She was purchased by the US Navy in December 1822 for use as a shallow water vessel operating against pirates along the coast of Cuba, and renamed Sea Gull. After the gunboat had been outfitted with sails, Lieutenant John C. Newton commanded her during her passage to Norfolk, Virginia where, on 14 February 1823, Lieutenant William H. Watson assumed command. She then proceeded to Santo Domingo to join Commodore David Porter's West Indies Squadron. During May 1823, she served as guard vessel at Thompson's Island. On 13 September 1823, at Key West, Lt. Watson died, and Lt. Ralph Voorhees took command. In September 1823, Porter returned to Washington in Sea Gull, arriving in 43 days. She underwent repairs at the Washington Navy Yard from 25 October to 30 December 1823. She returned to the West Indies in February 1824 where, on 30 March, Lt. Voorhees reported the recapture of the schooner Pacification. During April and May, with Lt. Jesse Wilkinson in command, she participated in an expedition along the coast of Cuba in search of pirates. In June, Commodore Porter returned to Washington in Sea Gull, making the trip in nine days. In July 1824, Lt. Isaac McKeever assumed command and returned to the West Indies whence Sea Gull patrolled until March 1825. At this time, with the barge she joined the British frigate and two armed British schooners in a raid on a pirate vessel. The operation resulted in the death of eight pirates and the capture of 19. Sea Gull continued to operate with the squadron until July 1825, when she was ordered to return to the east coast. She was subsequently surveyed, found unfit for further sea duty, and fitted out as a receiving ship at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There she served until she was sold in 1840.

It overlooks the Golan Heights and was built with the purpose of guarding a major access route to Damascus against armies coming from the west. Alternative forms and spellings include: Kal'at instead of Qal'at, the prefix as- instead of al-, and Subayba, Subaybah and Subeibeh in place of Subeiba. The area is under Israeli occupation and administration since 1967 together with the adjacent Golan Heights. The international community sees the area as Syrian territory. History Though once thought to be of Crusader construction, the fortress was built around 1228 by Al-Aziz Uthman, the son of Saladin's brother al-'Adil, to preempt an attack on Damascus by the armies of the Sixth Crusade. It was named Qal'at al-Subeiba, \\"Castle of the Large Cliff\\" in Arabic. The fortress was further expanded to contain the whole ridge by 1230. In 1260 the Mongols captured the castle, dismantled some of its defenses and left their ally, the son of Al-Aziz 'Uthman, in charge of it and the nearby town of Banias. After the subsequent Mamluk victory over the Mongols at the Battle of Ain Jalut, Sultan Baibars strengthened the castle and added larger towers. The fortress was given to Baibars's second-in-command, Bilik. The new governor started the broad construction activities. When the construction was finished, Bilik memorialized his work and glorified the name of the sultan in a 1275 inscription. After the death of Baibars, his son arranged for Bilik to be murdered, apparently because he feared his power. At the end of the 13th century, following the Muslim conquest of the port city of Acre (Akko) and the end of Crusader rule in the Holy Land, the fortress lost its strategic value and fell into disrepair. The Ottoman Turks conquered the land in 1517 and used the fortress as a luxury prison for Ottoman nobles. The fortress was abandoned later in the 16th century and local shepherds and their flocks were the sole guests within its walls. The fortress was ruined by an earthquake in the 18th century. Druze who came to the region during the 1860 conflict between themselves and the Maronites began calling it Qal'at Namrud (Nimrod's Castle), anachronistically attributing it to the Biblical Nimrod. Description The entire fortress complex is 420 m (1350 feet) in length and 150 m (500 feet) in width, and is built of large, carefully squared stones. Along the walls are numerous rectangular and semi-circular towers, roofed with pointed cross-arches. Overlooking the high, eastern edge of the fortress stood a large keep, measuring 65 by 45 metres (200 by 150 feet) and protected by massive rectangular towers. Remains of several luxurious halls, water pools, rooms, suggest that this might have been the residence of the governor as well. The fortress overlooks the deep, narrow valley that separates Mount Hermon from the rest of the Golan Heights, the road linking the Galilee with Damascus, and the former Crusader town of Banias. A panoramic photograph of Nimrod's Fortress, looking West. Current condition Today the site is administered by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority and visitors can explore the excavated and restored portions of the fortress. The entrance to the fortress is from the west, and the first section contains \\"secret corridors\\"‚Äîwinding staircases and underground water cisterns with some of the original plaster still visible. There are many examples of \\"loopholes\\" in fortress‚Äîspecial windows that are narrow on the outside but wide on the inside. They were designed specifically for shooting bows and arrows or crossbows, giving the defender inside the fortress plenty of room but the attacker only a narrow slit as a target. The central part, which is accessible by a path within the fortress, contains the remains of a keep surrounded by large rectangular towers. In the western section, there are the remains of a fortress within a fortress, which was protected by its own moat and drawbridge. This is the oldest part of the castle, which was built the first. The park entrance is located on Route 989 between Kiryat Shmona and Mount Hermon, about twenty minutes east of Kiryat Shmona. Nimrod, an Israeli settlement, is located nearby. In the Israeli film Beaufort, the castle substituted for Beaufort Castle, which is located in southern Lebanon.

He first studied with his father and then continued training with other Buddhist teachers in the region.Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche. (2003). \\"Brief Histories of the Sixteen Karmapas\\". In: Music in the Sky: The Life, Art & Teachings of the 17th Karmapa Ogyen Trinley Dorje. Snow Lion Publications, U.S.A. First Indian Reprint: New Age Books, New Delh. (2004), p. 277. . Gephel was a gifted child who studied and practiced Buddhism intently from an early age. Already quite learned by the age of twenty, he became a monk and studied the sutras and tantras intensively for another ten years. At thirty, he went to Daklha Gampo, the monastery of Gampopa, to receive teachings from him. He trained formally in the foundation practices of the Kadam tradition and, following that, in the general philosophy of the sutras during his time there. Gephel received empowerments and instruction in the Hevajra tantra and spent four years in strict retreat, training in ≈õamatha and vipa≈õyanƒÅ. He then received the full transmission of the inner instructions of the Kagyu tradition. In nine days he absorbed what Naropa had received over 12 years from Tilopa. Rechungpa, the \\"moon-like\\" disciple of Milarepa, also instructed him, principally in the Six Yogas of Naropa. His attainment in one of these -- tummo ‚Äîwas particularly boosted by his own natural compassion and produced rapid results. Following his teacher's instruction he then went away to meditate. Gampopa eventually died and Dusum Khyenpa returned to Daklha Gampo to honor his remains. He had a powerful vision of his teacher and knew that it was time to implement one of his final instructions: to go to the place where he would achieve enlightenment‚ÄîKampo Kangra‚Äîand there to practice mahamudra. He promised that he would live until the age of 84, in order to benefit the Dharma. He achieved enlightenment at the age of fifty, while practicing dream yoga. He had a vision at that time of the dakinis offering him a vajra crown woven from their hair. From then onwards his teaching activity was intense. At the age of 58 he founded a monastery at Kampo Nenang. He later established an important seat at Karma Gon Monastery in Chamdo in Kham and, at the age of 74, another seat at Tsurphu Monastery in √ú-Tsang in the valley of the Tolung River, which feeds into the Brahmaputra River. The abbot of the Buddhist monastery at Bodh Gaya sent a conch to D√ºsum Khyenpa at Tsurphu. Conch symbolism is found in many stories of the sixteen Karmapas. D√ºsum Khyenpa made predictions about future Karmapas. In particular, he was the first Karmapa to present a prediction letter detailing his future incarnation. He gave it to his main disciple, Drogon Rechen, predecessor of the Tai Situpa line. He died at the age of 84. His heart was found intact in the funeral pyre and some of his remaining bones bore self manifesting symbols of Buddhas. Among his main disciples were Taklung Thangpa Tashi Pal, founder of the Taklung Kagyu; Tsangpa Gyare, founder of the Drukpa Lineage now widespread in Bhutan; and the Nyingma master Katok Dampa Deshek,Katok Dampa Deshek some information by RIGPA SHEDRA founder of Katok Monastery.

Ladder was written by Yahoo Software of Los Angeles, California. Since the screens on these computers only accept text characters and not rendered graphics, the game uses letters, numbers, and symbols lined up to create walls and platforms, pits/traps, characters, trampolines and goals. The floors in Ladder are made of equal signs, and the ladders themselves are made of capital \\"H\\"s stacked on top of each other. The \\"lad\\" controlled by the player starts out as the letter \\"P\\", and barrels (\\"der rocks\\") are represented by \\"o\\"s. The catchphrase of the game reminded the acolyte player that there are more ways than one to skin a cat. This referred to the fact that the minimized traverse of almost all levels could be enhanced by inventive utilisation of the game features, and the highest levels absolutely required it. These could entail (at the apex of the game) for instance jumping on a trampoline at precisely the right speed and point of impact to fall into one of the pit/traps, at the right timing that there would be no barrels passing for a sufficient interval. Along with Star Trek, CatChum and Aliens, Ladder was one of the games that came with the software bundle of the early Kaypro computers.

The political system of the Soviet Union took place in a federal single-party soviet socialist republic framework which was characterized by the superior role of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), the only party permitted by the Constitution.  Background  The Bolsheviks who took power during the October Revolution, the final phase of the Russian Revolution, were the first communist party to take power and attempt to apply the Leninist variant of Marxism in a practical way. Although they grew very quickly during the Revolution from 24,000 to 100,000 members and got 25% of the votes for the Constituent Assembly in November 1917, the Bolsheviks were a minority party when they took power by force in Petrograd and Moscow. Their advantages were discipline and a platform supporting the movement of workers, peasants, soldiers and sailors who had seized factories, organized soviets, appropriated the lands of the aristocracy and other large landholders, deserted from the army and mutinied against the navy during the Revolution. Karl Marx made no detailed proposals for the structure of a socialist or communist government and society other than the replacement of capitalism with socialism and eventually communism by the victorious working class. Vladimir Lenin, the leader of the Bolsheviks, had developed the theory that a communist party should serve as the vanguard of the proletariat and ruling in their name and interest, but like Marx had not developed a detailed economic or political program. The new communist government of the Soviet Union faced alarming problems, such as extending practical control beyond the major cities, combatting counter-revolution and opposing political parties, coping with the continuing war and setting up a new economic and political system. Despite their relative discipline, the Bolsheviks were not of one mind, the party being a coalition of committed revolutionaries, but with somewhat differing views as to what was practical and proper. These diverging tendencies resulted in debates within the party over the next decade, followed by a period of consolidation of the party as definite programs were adopted.  Legislative branch = Congress of Soviets (1922‚Äì1936) and the Supreme Soviet (1936‚Äì1989)  The Congress of Soviets was the supreme organ of power in accordance with Article 8 of the 1924 Soviet Constitution. The Congress was replaced in the 1936 Soviet Constitution by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. In accordance with Article 30, it functioned as the highest state authority and the only legislative branch of the Soviet Union. According to Article 108 of the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Supreme Soviet was empowered to deal with all matters within the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union. The admission of new republics; creation of new autonomous republics and autonomous regions; approval of the five-year plan for social and economic development; and creation of the state budget and the institution of bodies to which the Soviet Union was accountable were the exclusive prerogative of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. The law of the Soviet Union was enacted by the Supreme Soviet or by referendum. The Supreme Soviet consisted of two chambers, the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities which had equal rights and an equal number of deputies. The Soviet of the Union was elected by constituencies with equal populations while the Soviet of Nationalities was elected on the basis of the following representation: 32 deputies from each Union Republic, 11 deputies from each autonomous republic, five deputies from each autonomous region and one deputy from each autonomous area. The Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities (upon submission by the elected credentials commissions) had the power to decide the validity of the elected deputies' credentials and (in cases where election law had been violated) would declare the election null and void. Both chambers elected a Chairman and four Deputies. The Chairmen of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities presided over sessions of their respective chambers and conducted their affairs. Joint sessions of the chambers were presided over by (alternately) the Chairman of the Soviet of the Union and the Chairman of the Soviet of Nationalities.  Congress of People's Deputies and State Council (1989‚Äì1991)  Through a constitutional amendment made by Mikhail Gorbachev, the Supreme Soviet became a permanent parliament which was elected by the Congress of the People's Deputies. In the 1989 Soviet legislative election, the Soviet people, elected for the first time candidates democratically. The new amendment called for a smaller working body (later known as the Supreme Soviet) to be elected by the 2,250-member Congress of People's Deputies. One-third of the seats in the Congress of People's Deputies was reserved for the Communist Party and other public organisations. The amendment clearly stated that multiple candidates could participate in electionsSoviet Union law ‚Ññ 9853-XI \\"On amendments and additions to the Constitution (Basic Law) of the USSR and Soviet voters stunned the authorities by voting for non-CPSU candidates and reformers. However, genuine reformers were estimated to have won only about 300 seats. Following the failed August Coup attempt, the State Council became the highest organ of state power \\"in the period of transition\\".  Executive branch = Premier and the Council (1922‚Äì1991)  According to the 1924 Soviet Constitution, the executive branch was headed by the Council of People's Commissars. In the 1977 Soviet Constitution, the Council of Ministers was the head of the executive branch. The Council of Ministers was formed at a joint meeting of the Soviet of the Union and the Soviet of Nationalities. The Council consisted of the Chairman, the First Deputies, the Deputies, the ministers, the chairmen of the state committees and the Chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Republics. The Chairman of the Council of Ministers could recommend to the Supreme Soviet other heads of organisations in the Soviet Union as members of the Council. The Council of Ministers laid down its power before the first session of the newly elected Supreme Soviet. The Council of Ministers was both responsible for and accountable to the Supreme Soviet, and in the period between sessions of the Supreme Soviet it was accountable to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Council of Ministers regularly reported to the Supreme Soviet on its work. It was tasked with resolving all state administrative duties within the jurisdiction of the Soviet Union, to the degree that they did not come under the competence of the Supreme Soviet or the Presidium. Within its limits, the Council of Ministers had authority to do the following tasks: * Ensure management of the national economy and its socio-cultural construction and development. * Formulate and submit the five-year plan of \\"economic and social development\\" and the state budget to the Supreme Soviet and submit its fulfilment to the Supreme Soviet. * Defend the interests of the state, socialist property and public order and protect the rights of Soviet citizens. * Ensure state security. * Exercise general leadership of the Soviet armed forces and determine how many were to be drafted into service. * Exercise general leadership over Soviet foreign relations; trade and the economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation of the USSR with foreign countries. It also confirmed and announced international treaties signed by the USSR. * Set up necessary organisations within the Council of Ministers in matters of economics, socio-cultural issues and defence. The Council of Ministers also had the power to issue decrees and resolutions and to later verify their execution. All organisations were obligated to follow the decrees and resolutions issued by the All-Union Council of Ministers. The All-Union Council also had the power to suspend all issues and decrees made by itself or organisations subordinate to it. It coordinated and directed the work of the republics and their ministries, state committees and other organs subordinate to the All-Union Council. Finally, the competence of the Council of Ministers and its Presidium in their procedures and activities (and its relationship with subordinate organs) was defined in the Soviet constitution by the law on the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union.  President and the Cabinet (1991)  In 1990, Mikhail Gorbachev created the office of the President of the Soviet Union, the head of the executive branch. In the meantime, the Council of Ministers was dissolved and replaced by the Cabinet of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The new cabinet was headed by the Premier. Gorbachev's election as President marked the third time in one year he was elected to an office equivalent to that of Soviet head of state. He was elected by the Congress of People's Deputies on all three occasions.  Judicial branch  The Supreme Court was the highest judicial body in the country as it supervised the administration of justice by the courts of the Soviet Union and its soviet republics within the limits of established law. The leadership of the Supreme Court was elected by the Supreme Soviet. The exceptions were the Chairmen of the Supreme Courts of the Soviet Republics, who were ex officio members. The organisation and the procedures of the Supreme Court were defined by law. As written in Article 157 of the Brezhnev Constitution, \\"[j]ustice is administered in the USSR on the principle of the equality of citizens before the law and the court\\". In the following articles, it was made clear that all individuals (no matter their circumstances) had the right to legal assistance. All judicial proceedings in the Soviet Union were conducted in the language of the Soviet republic, \\"Autonomous Republic, Autonomous Region, or Autonomous Area, or in the language spoken by the majority of the people in the locality\\". People who participated in court proceedings without knowledge of the language had the right to become fully acquainted with the materials in the case, the right to an interpreter during the proceedings and the right to address the court in their own language. According to Article 165. the Procurator General was appointed to the office by the Supreme Soviet. The Procurator General was responsible and accountable to the Supreme Soviet, or between sessions of the Supreme Soviet to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The Procurator General supervised most activities of Soviet agencies such as ministries, state committees and local Prosecutor Generals. Subordinate agencies of the Procurator General exercised their functions independent from meddling by the Soviet state and were subordinate only to the Prosecutor General's office. The organisation and procedures of these subordinates were defined in the law on the Procurator General's Office of the Soviet Union.  Role of the Communist Party  According to Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, the \\"leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the nucleus of its political system, of all state organisations and public organisations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. The CPSU exists for the people and serves the people\\". The Communist Party was officially a Marxism‚ÄìLeninism communist party which determined the general development of Soviet society both in domestic and foreign policy. It also directed the \\"great work\\" of building communism through central planning of the economy and the struggle for the victory of communism. All Communist Party organisations had to follow the framework laid down by the 1977 Soviet Constitution. After mounting pressure against him by the reformers, Mikhail Gorbachev removed the phrase \\"the leading and guiding force\\" and replaced it with \\"the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and other political parties\\". The nomenklatura was the Soviet Union's ruling group and remained one of the main reasons why the Soviet Union existed as long as it did. Members of the Nomenklatura were elected by the Communist Party to all important posts in Soviet society which could mean a locally or nationally significant office. Along with the Communist party's monopoly on power, this led to the gradual physical and intellectual degeneration of the Soviet Union as a state. As long as the General Secretary of the Communist Party commanded the loyalty of the Politburo, he would remain more-or-less unopposed and in all probability become the leader of the country.  Organization  The Communist Party controlled the government apparatus and took decisions affecting economy and society. The Communist Party followed the ideology of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism and operated on the principle of democratic centralism. The primary party bodies were the Politburo, the highest decision-making organ; the Secretariat, the controller of party bureaucracy; and the Central Committee, the party's policy forum. Party membership reached more than 19 million (9.7 percent of the adult population) in 1987 and was dominated by male Russian professionals. Party members occupied positions of authority in all officially recognized institutions throughout the country. Single party rule combined with democratic centralism, which in practice consisted of a hierarchal structure which with the aid of a secret police organization enforced decisions made by the ruling party as well on the personnel of all governmental institutions, including the courts, the press, cultural and economic organizations and labor unions. The Soviet Union is considered by many to have been a totalitarian state for much of its existence. Critics include Western authors such as Robert Conquest and Russian critics such as Alexander Yakovlev.  Ideology  Education and political discourse proceeded on the assumption that it was possible to mold people using collectivist institutional forms into an ideal Soviet man or woman (see new Soviet man). The validity of ideas, public discourse, and institutional form were evaluated in terms of the official ideology of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism as interpreted by the Communist Party.

Gilbert of Assailly, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller, began construction of the castle in 1168. The restored castle is located in Belvoir National Park. It is the best-preserved Crusader castle in Israel.National Parks Authority of Israel History=Roman and Byzantine periods The Hebrew name, Kochav Hayarden, meaning Star of the Jordan, preserves the name of Kochava ‚Äì a Jewish village which existed nearby during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Crusader period Belvoir from southwest The Knights Hospitaller purchased the site from Velos, a French nobleman, in 1168. Standing above the Jordan River Valley, the plateau commanded the route from Gilead into the Kingdom of Jerusalem and a nearby river crossing. To the north is the Sea of Galilee and west are hills. The site of Belvoir Castle dominated the surrounding area, and in the words of Abu Shama the castle is \\"set admidst the stars like an eagle's nest and abode of the moon\\". As soon as the Knights Hospitaller purchased the land they began construction of Belvoir Castle. While Gilbert of Assailly was Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller the order gained around thirteen new castles, among which Belvoir was the most important. The castle of Belvoir served as a major obstacle to the Muslim goal of invading the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem from the east. It withstood an attack by Muslim forces in 1180. During the campaign of 1182, the Battle of Belvoir Castle was fought nearby between King Baldwin IV of Jerusalem and Saladin. Following Saladin's victory over the Crusaders at the Battle of Hattin, Belvoir was besieged. The siege lasted a year and a half, until the defenders surrendered on 5 January 1189. An Arab governor occupied it until 1219 when the Ayyubid ruler in Damascus had slighted. In 1241 Belvoir was ceded to the Franks, who controlled it until 1263.Colum Hourihane (ed.),The Grove Encyclopedia of Medieval Art and Architecture, Oxford University Press, Vol. 2, 2012 p.298 Ottoman and British Mandate periods During the Ottoman period it became an Arab village, Kawkab al-Hawa, whose inhabitants were forced out by the Zionist forces during the 1947-48 civil war after a military assault by Yishuv forces. Israel The Arab buildings on the site were demolished by the Israeli authorities between 1963 and 1968. Architecture Plan of Belvoir Castle After the end of the Second World War, the study of Crusader castles experienced a lull. Syria, for instance, declared independence in 1946 and had little money to spare for archaeology. In Israel, the study of Crusader castles developed under Joshua Prawer. Its most significant discovery was made at Belvoir. Between 1963 and 1968 the Israel Department of Antiquities carried out excavations at the castle. Before the investigations, it had been assumed that Belvoir was a simple castle, with just a single enclosure. Excavations in the 1960s demonstrated the complex nature of early military architecture in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Belvoir's design bore similarities to that of a Roman castrum: the inner enclosure was rectangular with towers at the corners, and large gatehouse in the middle of one wall, in this case the west. Belvoir is an early example of the concentric castle plan, which was widely used in later crusader castles. The castle was highly symmetric, with a rectangular outer wall, reinforced with square towers at the corners and on each side, surrounding a square inner enclosure with four corner towers and one on the west wall. According to historian H. J. A. Sire, the principle of concentric design used at Belvoir \\"was to influence castle design for the next several centuries.\\" Vaults on the inner side of both walls provided storage and protection during bombardments. The castle was surrounded by a moat wide and deep.

Education Biret began her lessons at the age of five with , who had studied under Nadia Boulanger and Alfred Cortot. When she was seven, the Turkish parliament enacted a special law which enabled her to study abroad, studying at the Paris Conservatory in France under the tutelage of Nadia Boulanger. She also credits for having introduced her to composers such as Brahms, whose complete works she would later record. She graduated with three prizes at the age of 15. She continued her education with Alfred Cortot and Wilhelm Kempff. Musical career From the age of 16, Biret played as a soloist with the most distinguished orchestras in the world including the London Symphony, the Philharmonia, the London Philharmonic, the Boston Symphony, the Leningrad Philharmonic, the Leipzig Gewandhaus, the Dresden Staatskapelle, the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande, the Tokyo Philharmonic, the Warsaw Philharmonic, the Orchestre National de France and the Sydney Symphony.

Biret also gave concerts at the festivals of Berlin, Montreal, Istanbul, Dubrovnik, Montpellier, Nohant, Persepolis, Royan and Athens. Idil Biret had her US concert premier at Symphony Hall in Boston under Erich Leinsdorf on Friday, November 22, 1963. Just before she was to play (Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto #3), Maestro Leinsdorf addressed the audience, saying that \\"we have just heard on the wireless that the President of the United States has been the victim of an assassination!\\" After the audience got over the shock, the orchestral management and players agreed to proceed with Miss Biret's performance.Radio broadcast of the concert, WFLN-FM, Philadelphia She has been a jury member at several piano competitions: Van Cliburn (US), Queen Elisabeth (Belgium), Montreal (Canada), Liszt (Weimar, Germany) and Busoni (Italy).

According to AllMusic's reviewer, Cobham is generally acclaimed as fusion's greatest drummer of all time. He was inducted into the Modern Drummer Hall of Fame in 1987 and the Classic Drummer Hall of Fame in 2013. \\"Generally acclaimed as fusion's greatest drummer, Billy Cobham's explosive technique powered some of the genre's most important early recordings - including groundbreaking efforts by Miles Davis and the Mahavishnu Orchestra - before he became an accomplished bandleader in his own right. At his best, Cobham harnessed his amazing dexterity into thundering, high-octane hybrids of jazz complexity and rock & roll aggression.\\" He was inducted into the modern drummer hall of fame in 1987 and the classic drummer hall of fame in 2013. Cobham's influence stretched far beyond jazz: prog contemporaries Bill Bruford of King Crimson listened closely to what he was up to, younger drummers like Danny Carey of Tool learned from him, and even Prince played a version of Cobham's Stratus in concert. Phil Collins, who has named Mahavishnu Orchestra's The Inner Mounting Flame as a key influence on his early style said, \\"Billy Cobham played some of the finest drumming I've ever heard on that record.\\" Biography Born in Col√≥n, Panama, Cobham moved with his family to Brooklyn, New York, when he was three. His father, Manuel, worked as a hospital statistician during the week and played piano on weekends. Cobham started playing drums at age four and joined his father four years later. When he was fourteen, he got his first drum kit as a gift after being accepted to The High School of Music & Art in New York City. He was drafted in 1965, and for the next three years he played with a U.S. Army band. After his discharge, he became a member of Horace Silver's quintet. He played an early model electric drum kit given to him by Tama Drums. He was a house drummer for Atlantic Records and a session musician for CTI and Kudu, appearing on the albums White Rabbit by George Benson, Sunflower by Milt Jackson, and Soul Box by Grover Washington Jr. Cobham started the jazz rock group Dreams with Michael Brecker, Randy Brecker, Barry Rogers, and John Abercrombie. He moved further into jazz fusion when he toured with Miles Davis and recorded Davis's albums Bitches Brew and A Tribute to Jack Johnson. In 1971, he and guitarist John McLaughlin left Davis to start the Mahavishnu Orchestra, another group that fused rock, funk, and jazz. Cobham toured extensively from 1971 to 1973 with the Mahavishnu Orchestra, which released two studio albums, The Inner Mounting Flame (1971) and Birds of Fire (1973), and one live album, Between Nothingness & Eternity (1973). The studio versions of songs on the live album were released on The Lost Trident Sessions (1999). Cobham's debut album, Spectrum (1973), surprised him and his record company when it reached No. 1 on the Billboard magazine Jazz Albums chart and No. 26 on the Top 200 Albums chart. Cobham started experimenting with different drum equipment; in 1974 for Crosswinds he used a fiberglass shell snare built for Cobham by Al Duffy, and he used Duffy's custom chain-drive kick drum pedal. In another experiment, drum roadie Jeff Ocheltree helped Cobham convert the inner snares from the usual thin steel springs to teflon-covered cables. Cobham's massive drum kit in the mid-1970s, based on a clear acrylic set by Fibes Drums, contained two Fibes kick drums, a custom Duffy/Ocheltree snare, two flared-shell rack toms by North Drums, four Fibes rack toms, two Fibes floor toms, two gong drums by Duffy/Ocheltree, a hi-hat, five Zildjian cymbals, and one hanging 36-inch gong. This expansive kit and Cobham's dynamic style influenced later drummers. Baku Jazz Festival, 2007 In 1980, he worked with Jack Bruce in Jack Bruce & Friends. For this group, Cobham used a very large custom drum kit designed for him by Tama Drums, featuring three kick drums with linked pedals, and three snares including a piccolo snare and a Hinger Space Tone expanding snare. Cobham said this kit adapted to fit the music, and the music adapted to fit the kit ‚Äì \\"a continual chicken‚Äìegg‚Äìchicken scenario.\\" On October 30, 1980, he joined the Grateful Dead during the band's concert at Radio City Music Hall. He performed a long drum solo session with the band's two percussionists, Bill Kreutzmann and Mickey Hart, also known as the Rhythm Devils. In 1981, Billy Cobham's Glass Menagerie was formed with Micha≈Ç Urbaniak on violin and EWI, Gil Goldstein on piano, Tim Landers on bass, and Mike Stern on guitar. Dean Brown replaced Stern when he left to play with Miles Davis. Glass Menagerie released two albums for Elektra Musician. In 1984, he played in the band Bobby and the Midnites, a side project for Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead, with Bobby Cochran and Kenny Gradney, and recorded the album Where the Beat Meets the Street. Cobham moved to Switzerland in 1985. In 1994, he joined an all-star cast Greek Theatre in Los Angeles and the results appeared on the album Stanley Clarke, Larry Carlton, Billy Cobham, Najee and Deron Johnson Live at the Greek. The concert was predominantly Clarke's music, but all the musicians contributed material. Billy Cobham live at Leverkusener Jazztage (Germany) on November 8, 2016 In 2006, Cobham released Drum 'n' Voice 2, a return to the 1970s jazz-funk sound, with guests including Brian Auger, Guy Barker, Jeff Berlin, Frank Gambale, Jan Hammer, Mike Lindup, Buddy Miles, Dominic Miller, Airto Moreira, John Patitucci, and the band Novecento. The album was produced and arranged by Pino and Lino Nicolosi for Nicolosi Productions. In 2009, he released Drum 'n Voice 3. Guests included Alex Acu√±a, Brian Auger, George Duke, Chaka Khan, Bob Mintzer, Novecento, John Scofield, and Gino Vannelli. Cobham played his drums using the open-handed technique, which allows the player to play without crossing his right hand over the snare drum. In December 2011, Cobham began teaching drums online at the Billy Cobham School of Drums, a school in the ArtistWorks Drum Academy.  Praise from other musicians  Many musicians have cited Cobham as an influence, including Kenny Aronoff, Steve Arrington, Ranjit Barot, Danny Carey, Jimmy Chamberlin, Dennis Chambers, Brann Dailor, Matt Garstka, Chris Hornbrook, Thomas Lang, Mac McNeilly, OM, Opeth, Chris Pennie Mike Portnoy, Thomas Pridgen, Sivamani, Bill Stevenson, Jon Theodore, and Tony Thompson. In addition, other musicians have been quoted expressing admiration for his work, including Steven Wilson, and Dave Bainbridge.

Split into two competing teams of four, each week teams are given different physical challenges, and weighed to see if they reached their target weights. They are monitored and supervised by a team that includes a nutritionist, a psychologist, and a physical trainer, the latter of which is former U.S. Marine Harvey Walden IV. The series originated in the United Kingdom on ITV in 2002 as Fat Club, with members of the general public taking part. The show then switched to celebrity participants, and continued until 2006, with Dale Winton as host since the series two. An American version premiered in 2005 on the VH1 network. Series one ‚Äì 2002 The first series aired in 2002 and featured the following celebrities: *Jonathan \\"Jono\\" Coleman (radio DJ) *Nicola Duffett (actress ‚Äì Family Affairs) *Ian McCaskill (weatherman) *Coleen Nolan (singer and presenter) *Kay Purcell (actress ‚Äì played Cynthia Daggert in Emmerdale) *Rik Waller (former contestant ‚Äì Pop Idol) (the first celebrity to leave the show) *Tommy Walsh (celebrity builder ‚Äì Ground Force) *Ann Widdecombe (Conservative MP) Note: Series One was the only series in which celebs were not competing in teams or the episodes were filmed around the weigh-in; instead the weigh in occurred near the end.

He admits he enjoys being a couch potato and is \\"much too fond of crisps and beer\\". He said \\"I am just like Homer Simpson in real life - I love slobbing out in front of the TV with a drink and some snacks. That's a perfect life for me. I did all my hard running around ten years ago.\\" Jeff Rudom, former professional basketball player, was 7' 1\\" (216 cm) tall and weighed in at (), making him the tallest and heaviest celebrity ever to appear on the show. The Anne Diamond Saga Anne Diamond, who was team captain, walked off during a training session in week 4. The UK soldiers who replaced Harvey failed to gel with Anne Diamond, who said ‚ÄúI'm not going to have a stupid, spotty, pubescent little youth yelling at me!‚Äù As a result of her outburst in training, Anne was relieved of her captaincy by Harvey. The following week, she was angry that Jeff was made team captain instead of Mikyla. The following week, Anne Diamond revealed that she had a gastric band fitted. This garnered much press attention, making the front pages of the Daily Mail, Express and Mirror. Fellow contestant Carole Malone branded Anne \\"a cheat\\", and she was subsequently banned from the team weigh by the other celebrities. Later Carole and her team decided to include her in all aspects of the programme regardless of previous disputes, but she chose to leave the show. The Sheffield Events 2006 and the Final Weigh-in The English Institute for Sport in Sheffield was the venue for the series' final competition, and the two teams fought head to head for the inaugural Fit Club Champions Trophy, with Aldo, Amy, Coleen and Harvey joining Jeff's team, and Tina, Kym and Lowri joining Carole's team. After the long jump, sprint, shot put and hurdles, the fate of each team rested on the relay race. It was a fast and furious race but Mick emerged victor, making Carole Malone's team the winners. At the weigh-in, Dale dealt some bad news: as he approached the finish, Mick had thrown the baton before he had crossed the line, thus disqualifying him from the race, and giving the win to the opposing team. Captain Jeff decided that in the interest of competition both teams should share the trophy. Later Mick was made Mr Fit Club 2006, with a reduction of nearly 25%. The teams took to the giant scales and with a 19% reduction of their total weight Carole's team won the series, just putting them ahead of Jeff‚Äôs 18% team effort. The overall result could barely have been closer.

He had a realistic rather than romantic approach, and \\"only liked to gamble on certainties.\\"https://wisden.com/almanack/why-critics-were-astounded- when-ray-illingworth-excelled-as-england-captain-almanack Playing style As a bowler, he was not a sharp spinner of the ball, relying on accuracy and subtle variations of flight, but his arm ball was particularly effective with many of his victims being caught at slip, playing for spin that was not there. In county cricket, he took 2072 wickets. He sent down 408 balls without reward in the three Tests against New Zealand in 1973 but conceded only 1.91 runs an over in his Test career. His middle-order batting was based around stern defence; a fifth of his innings, mostly from number 6 or 7 in the order, finished not out. He scored 24,134 first-class runs in all, with a best of 162, at an average of 28.06. Against the Rest of the World in 1970, Illingworth topped the England averages with 476 runs (52.89) and six half- centuries, a testament to his grit and determination against the best in the world. Captaincy style The Yorkshireman was 'tough, combative, grudging, shrewd, and an instinctive reader of the game', and an experienced, no- nonsense captain who expected his team to play like professionals. David Gower wrote 'no matter how highly Ray might regard you as a player he would not have you in his team, come hell or high water, unless he was utterly convinced that you could do the job he had allocated to you'.Gower, David (1985). Heroes and Contemporaries. Granada Publishing Ltd. pp. 56‚Äì59. . He managed 'difficult' players like Geoff Boycott and John Snow\\"He harboured and nurtured his bowlers like no other captain I have served\\"(p78)...\\"Ray's strong point was in quickly guessing the mood and the problems of the bowler\\"... whether the bowler was \\"able to strike his true rhythm\\"...Ray \\"recognised that I knew what was needed from me and trusted me to adjust my programme and thinking to be at a peak when required during the Test matches. That was something I appreciated.\\"(p80)...Ray \\"fought hard\\" to get the best off-field facilities for his team...(p81), John Snow, 'Cricket Rebel' well, and they responded with their best Test form. 'Most of all, because he insisted on his \\"own side\\", he was able to get the best out of his players, both mentally and physically. He built up a tremendous team spirit which stood us in good stead on numerous occasions',Snow, John (1976). Cricket Rebel. Hamlyn. and they tended to close ranks and treat the opposition, umpires, press and public as the enemy, an attitude that became prevalent amongst Test teams in the 1970s.Brown, Ashley (1988). The Pictorial History of Cricket. Bison Books Ltd. pp. 150‚Äì152. . Illingworth captained England in 31 Test matches, winning 12, losing 5 and drawing 14. Record=Player Illingworth played 787 first-class matches over nearly 33 years. County level Illingworth made his first-class debut at 19, was capped in 1955 and became a stalwart of the Yorkshire in the 1960s. As captain his experience and knowledge of the game were widely believed to have helped Yorkshire to their County Championship victories in 1966, 1967 and 1968. In 1968 he joined Leicestershire after a contract dispute with Yorkshire, and was made captain.Swanton, E. W. (1986). The Barclay's World of Cricket. Collins. . Test level Illingworth made his Test d√©but for England in 1958 but struggled on his first tour, in the West Indies in 1959‚Äì60, taking just five wickets in five Test matches. After failing to make an impact in four Tests against South Africa he found himself struggling for a place. A good series against India in 1967 established him in the team. The selectors had long regarded Colin Cowdrey as England's natural cricket captain, but he broke an Achilles tendon early in the season and Illingworth was his surprise replacement after only a month as county captain. Illingworth had been in and out of the national side for years, but had taken 20 wickets (13.30) against India in 1967 and 13 more (22.39) against Australia in 1968. He was originally chosen over his rivals like Brian Close as he was not a threat to Cowdrey's long-term captaincy due to his age and inability to establish a regular spot in the Test team. In the Second Test against the West Indies at Lord's in 1969, England collapsed to 61‚Äì5, but the new skipper made a forceful 113 out of the last 155 runs and became a hero. He beat both the West Indies and New Zealand 2‚Äì0 and was confirmed as captain even when Cowdrey recovered. Illingworth captained England for five seasons (1969‚Äì1973) and this was a very successful period in English Cricket. Under Illingworth, England beat the West Indies 2‚Äì0 in 1969, held a powerful Rest of the World side to 1-4 in 1970, won the Ashes in Australia in 1970‚Äì71, beat Pakistan in 1971, somewhat surprisingly lost to India in 1971 but then regrouped and held on to the Ashes in a tight series in 1972 before eventually losing to a strong West Indies team in 1973. Illingworth can perhaps be considered responsible for the victories in several of those tighter contests. For example, at Headingley in 1969 the West Indies were 219 ‚Äì 3 chasing 303 when Illingworth's inspired bowling change had Basil Butcher caught behind and wickets fell with just about every bowling change he made that afternoon. Similarly at Sydney in the 7th Test of the 1970‚Äì71 series it was Illingworth, deprived of his star batsman Geoff Boycott and his star bowler John Snow, who somehow pressurised the Australian batsmen into capitulation. Those two matches will probably be remembered as Illingworth's finest moments as captain because they were the most famous. However it was for his brilliant tactics at Headingley in 1971 that he should receive most plaudits. With Pakistan needing only 231 to win ‚Äì they were sailing toward victory with Sadiq Mohammad and Asif Iqbal in full command at 160‚Äì4. Alan Knott pulled off a miraculous stumping off Norman Gifford (Asif the batsman) and again Illingworth's bowling changes just as they had two years earlier resulted in wickets ‚Äì including the key wicket of Sadiq ‚Äì c&b; by Basil D'Oliveira. The 1972 series was as good and tough an Ashes series as there has been (with the possible exception of 2005). The seasoned pros of England in Boycott, Edrich, D'Oliveira, Illingworth himself, Underwood and Snow faced the upcoming young Australians (Ian and Greg Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Doug Walters) who would dominate for the middle part of the decade. The series was drawn 2‚Äì2 but included tight games at Headingley and particularly the Oval, where the match lasted almost six days with Australia chasing 242 with only 5 wickets in hand. 1973 was the end for Illingworth as captain of England and it was rather a sad one in that an easy victory over a budding New Zealand team was followed by a heavy defeat by a West Indies side just beginning to peak. England needed to win at Lord's to level the three-Test series. West Indies had first use of a quick but perfectly even batting wicket and made 650 at a rapid scoring rate as England's bowling attack of Willis, Arnold, Greig, Underwood and Illingworth were humiliated by Kanhai, Sobers and Bernard Julien. When England batted they had no answer to Lance Gibbs and lost by an innings. Wisden fairly described it as \\"a sad end to the Illingworth era\\". =England's unbeaten run= When Illingworth became captain England had lost only one of their previous 14 Test matches, and none of their last 7. He continued this run to a record breaking 27 Test Matches without defeat in 1968‚Äì71, or one defeat in 40 Tests in 1966‚Äì71. This record was not recognised at the time as the games against the Rest of the World XI were counted as Test matches and was subsequently equalled by Clive Lloyd's West Indies in 1981‚Äì84. *1‚Äì1 (5 Tests) vs Australia in 1968, Australia winning the First Test at Old Trafford by 159 runs. *0‚Äì0 (3 Tests) in Pakistan 1968‚Äì69. *2‚Äì0 (3 Tests) vs the West Indies 1969. *2‚Äì0 (3 Tests) vs New Zealand 1969. *2‚Äì0 (7 Tests) in Australia 1970‚Äì71. *1‚Äì0 (2 Tests) in New Zealand 1970‚Äì71. *1‚Äì0 (3 Tests) vs Pakistan 1971. *0‚Äì1 (3 Tests) vs India 1971, India winning the Third Test at the Oval by 4 wickets. =Rest of the World XI= There was no tour in 1969‚Äì70 and no tourists in 1970 as the series with South Africa were cancelled due to the Basil d'Oliveira Affair and concerns over anti-apartheid demonstrations that had led to barbed wire at Lord's. Rather than send an unprepared team to Australia the Rest of the World XI under Garry Sobers was created from the overseas cricketers playing in the County Championship, including the South Africans Graeme Pollock, Mike Procter, Barry Richards and Eddie Barlow. They could not be regarded as a national Test team and the matches were given the status of 'unofficial Tests', but the runs scored and wickets taken were added to official Test statistics until it was decided by the I.C.C. that they should not count. England were beaten by a superior team, but this was not unexpected. The only surprise was that they managed to win one game and almost won two others against what was arguably the strongest Test team ever assembled.Firth, Colin (1987). Pageant of Cricket. The Macmillan Company of Australia. p. 506. =Australia= (See Main Article English cricket team in Australia in 1970‚Äì71) Illingworth led England to a 2‚Äì0 Ashes victory in 1970‚Äì71, the only time a touring team has played a full Test series in Australia without defeat. The future Australian captain, Greg Chappell, later wrote: > Ray Illingworth's England side in 1970‚Äì71 were mentally the toughest English > side I played against, and the experience of playing against them first up > in my Test career reinforced what I had learnt in the backyard. Test cricket > was not for the faint of heart.

G Clark. Bernard Thomas of Warwickshire was the assistant manager and physiotherapist, and G. C. A. Saulez the scorer. Clark had been the amateur captain of Kent in 1949‚Äì51 and was described by Illingworth as \\"an amiable, but somewhat ineffectual man\\",Criss, Freddi (1996). The Guinness Book of Cricket Blunders. Guinness Publishing. p. 147. . and there were soon divisions between him and the players. After the Second Test Clark criticised both captains for cautious play, England for their short-pitched bowling and indicated that he would prefer to see Australia win 3‚Äì1 than see four more draws. Illingworth only discovered this when he was asked for a comment by a journalist in the morning and the rest of the team when they read the newspapers at the airport. As a result, Illingworth effectively took over the running of the tour with the support of the players and Clark's influence declined. Unlike his predecessors, Illingworth insisted on good hotel accommodation, decent sporting facilities, better travel arrangements, higher allowances and pay, and fought hard to get them, which was greatly appreciated by the players. In the final Sydney Test Clark tried to push Illingworth back on to the field when he took the team off because of the crowd throwing beer cans after the Snow-Jenner incident. A furious Illingworth said he would not return until the playing area had been cleared and the crowd had calmed down and objected to Clark constantly siding with the Australians against his own team. When the team returned to England, Illingworth said that \\"all hell would break loose\\" if anyone was denied his good conduct bonus (as with Fred Trueman in the West Indies in 1953‚Äì54),Trueman, Fred (2004). As It Was. Pan Books. p. 171. . but this did not happen. =Later captaincy= Series wins over New Zealand and Pakistan followed and a despite a loss against India in 1971 he scored his second Test century and enjoyed bowling success. He revealed, in an interview with Shyam Bhatia, 30 years after the loss, that he regretted not bowling Brian Luckhurst's occasional left arm spin against the Indians on a sluggish pitch which had blunted Derek Underwood. He retained the Ashes at home in 1972 against Ian Chappell's powerful young side with an exciting 2‚Äì2 series draw. In 1972‚Äì73 he declined to tour India, Tony Lewis leading the team instead, and when he took back the reins in 1973 he beat New Zealand 2‚Äì0, but lost 2‚Äì0 to the West Indies and Illingworth was dropped as England captain in the middle of the final test at Lord's. Return from retirement Leicestershire benefited from his return, winning four one day trophies and the County Championship in 1975. After announcing his retirement from the first-class game in 1978 he returned to Headingley to manage the Yorkshire team, despite his testy relationship with Geoff Boycott. In 1982, faced with an under- performing team on the field, he made a return to the playing arena and replaced Chris Old as captain. The side won the Sunday League in his final season in 1983 but failed in the championship, finishing bottom for the first time ever. The title of the book he wrote about this era was The Tempestuous Years. After retirement Illingworth left Yorkshire in 1984 and carved out a successful career as a media pundit, often fiercely critical of the England Test team. Eventually he became the chairman of England's Board of Test Selectors (1993-1996) and the England cricket coach (1995-1996). He often clashed with England captain Mike Atherton over team selection. Recognition Illingworth was one of Wisden's 5 Cricketers of the Year in 1959. He was awarded the CBE for services to cricket in 1973 and made an honorary member of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). He was the fourth cricketer to be elected to Yorkshire's 'Hall of Fame ' and was President of Yorkshire County Cricket in 2010/2011.List Of Yorkshire County Cricket Club Presidents. yorkshireccc.com Personal life Illingworth is married to Shirley.http://www.yorkshirefilmarchive.com/film/ray-illingworth-children- early-age-cricket-scarborough His son-in-law Ashley Metcalfe played cricket for Yorkshire.

A post box (British English; also written postbox; also known as pillar box), also known as a collection box, mailbox, letter box or drop box (American English) is a physical box into which members of the public can deposit outgoing mail intended for collection by the agents of a country's postal service. The term post box can also refer to a private letter box for incoming mail. History of post boxes=Europe In 1653, the first post boxes are believed to have been installed in and around Paris. By 1829, post boxes were in use throughout France. The first public post boxes in Poland were installed in Warsaw in 1842. A post box originally installed in the wall of the Wakefield Post Office is dated 1809 and believed to be the oldest example in Britain. It is now on display at the new Wakefield Museum. A note attached to an old private posting box in St John University (York) In the British Isles, the first red pillar post boxes were erected in Guernsey in 1852. Roadside wall boxes first appeared in 1857 as a cheaper alternative to pillar boxes, especially in rural districts. In 1853 the first pillar box in the United Kingdom was installed at Botchergate, Carlisle. In 1856, Richard Redgrave of the Department of Science and Art designed an ornate pillar box for use in London and other large cities. In 1859 the design was improved, and this became the first National Standard pillar box. Green was adopted as the standard colour for the early Victorian post boxes. Between 1866 and 1879 the hexagonal Penfold post box became the standard design for pillar boxes and it was during this period that red was first adopted as the standard colour. The first boxes to be painted red were in London in July 1874, although it would be nearly 10 years before all the boxes had been repainted. In 2012, to celebrate Olympic gold medals for Team GB, selected boxes were painted gold. One was defaced briefly by a vandal with graffiti. One has been painted in the 'wrong' town. The first public letter boxes (post boxes) in Russia appeared in 1848 in St. Petersburg. They were made of wood and iron. Because these boxes were lightweight and easy to steal, they disappeared frequently; later boxes were made of cast iron and could weigh up to .

North America The United States Post Office Department began installing public mail collection boxes in the 1850s outside post offices and on street corners in large Eastern cities. U.S. collection boxes were initially designed to be hung or supported, and were mounted on support pillars, lamp-posts, telegraph poles, or even the sides of buildings. By the 1880s, these pillar boxes were made of heavy cast iron to deter theft or vandalism. As mail volume grew, the Post Office Department gradually replaced pillar mailboxes with larger free-standing models, though many of the pillar boxes continued in service as late as the 1960s. The four- footed, free-standing U.S. Mail collection box was first suggested in 1894, following the successful use of such designs in Canada, and quickly became a fixture on U.S. city street corners. Unlike Canadian mailboxes, which were painted red,Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, History in a Box: Red Forever!, Civilisation.ca. http://www.civilisations.ca/cpm/histbox/canad_e.htm U.S. mail collection boxes were originally painted in red or green. Beginning in 1909, all mail collection boxes were painted a dark green to avoid confusion with emergency and fire equipment. Dark green gave way to olive drab green after World War I, when the U.S. Army donated a large supply of olive drab green paint to the Post Office. Olive drab green subsequently became the standard colour for all U.S. mail collection boxes until 1955. On 4 July 1955, Postmaster General Arthur Summerfield announced that the Post Office would begin painting all mail collection boxes in red, white, and blue to make them easily identifiable. Subsequently, the Post Office began painting mail collection boxes in red and blue, with white lettering.U.S. Post Office Bulletin 19867, 9 August 1955 In 1971 the United States Postal Service changed mail collection boxes to the current USPS Dark Blue with contrasting lettering.United States Postal Service v.

Retrieved 13 June 2019 In 1500, a Portuguese sea captain named P√™ro de Ata√≠de lost much of his fleet in a storm off the Southern Cape. He wrote a message reporting the damage and a warning relating the state of affairs in India, for future Portuguese captains to avoid Calicut, which was now hostile. Ata√≠de tucked the message in a boot dangling from a milkwood tree near a spring where sailors often drew water, Aguada de S√£o Br√°s (Mossel Bay). Miraculously, the message was retrieved by its intended recipient, Jo√£o da Nova, admiral of the outgoing 3rd armada, the very next year. The tree became a de facto post office box, where sailors would exchange letters protected in boots, iron pots, or beneath rocks. Seamen would leave their messages behind, trusting that their countrymen would pick them up and deliver them to their correct destination, albeit very slowly. The Post Office Tree, now believed to be approximately 600 years old, still continues to send and receive mail. A large post office box shaped like a giant boot has been constructed beneath the tree, where people can send letters anywhere in the world and receive a special stamp. Presumably, delivery now takes less than a year. Types of post boxes Varieties of post boxes (for outgoing mail) include: * Lamp box * Pillar box * Wall box * Ludlow wall box Some postal operators have different types of post boxes for different types of mail, such as, ordinary post, air mail and express mail, for local addresses (defined by a range of postal codes) and out-of-town addresses, or for post bearing postage stamps and post bearing a postage meter indicator. Some countries have different coloured post boxes; in countries such as Australia, Portugal, and Russia, the colour indicates which type of mail a box is to be used for, such as 1st and 2nd class post. However, in Germany and parts of Sweden, because of postal deregulation, the different colours are for the different postal services. Other nations use a particular colour to indicate common political or historical ties.Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, Colour, A Postal Symbol, Civilisation.ca. http://www.civilisations.ca/cpm/histbox/couleu_e.htm Post boxes or mailboxes located outdoors are designed to keep mail secure and protected from weather. Some boxes have a rounded or slanted top or a down turned entry slot to protect mail from rain or snow. Locks are fitted for security, so mail can be retrieved only by official postal employees, and the box will ordinarily be constructed so as to resist damage from vandalism, forcible entry, or other causes. Bright colours are often used to increase visibility and prevent accidents and injuries. Entry openings are designed to allow the free deposit of mail, yet prevent retrieval via the access slot by unauthorised persons.

In urban areas, this might be once or twice a day. Busy boxes might be cleared more frequently to avoid overflowing, and also to spread the work for the sorters. Extra clearances are made in the period leading up to Christmas, to prevent boxes becoming clogged with mail. Since 2005, most Royal Mail post boxes have had the time of only the last collection of the day shown on the box, with no indication of whether the box is cleared at other times earlier in the day. Royal Mail say they needed to increase the type size of the wording on the plate to help those with poor sight, and so there was not enough room to list all collection times throughout the day. Some post boxes may indicate the next collection time by a metal 'tab' or dial that can be changed while the box is open. The tab displays a day or number, each number corresponding to a different time shown on the plate. Some boxes have been used as a dumping ground for used hypodermic needles. In such cases staff are issued with protective equipment.  Terrorism and political vandalism =Scotland In 1952, a number of post boxes were attacked in Scotland in a dispute over the regnal number adopted by Queen Elizabeth II, which was displayed as the EIIR cypher. This included at least one which was damaged in Edinburgh with a home made explosive device. This was because, many Scottish people did not believe Queen Elizabeth II Should take that title. Rather Elizabeth Queen of Scots as Scotland had never had a Queen Elizabeth before. To this day Scottish post boxes and Royal Mail vans use the Scottish Crown with no mention of Queen Elizabeth II. Following a civil case in the Scottish courts, a compromise was reached where the Crown of Scotland was placed upon Scottish pillar boxes, in place of the St Edward's Crown, without any reference to the particular reigning monarch. (One such example can still be seen today in Hong Kong at Statue Square). The Troubles During 1939 a number of bombs were put in post boxes by the IRA as part of their S-Plan campaign. When the Provisional IRA blew up the Arndale shopping centre in the 1996 Manchester bombing, one of the few things to survive unscathed was a Victorian pillar box dating from 1887 (a type A Jubilee pillar). In Northern Ireland several red Royal Mail post boxes were painted green by Irish Republicans in early 2009, in order to resemble An Post's post boxes in the Republic of Ireland. United States Nearly 7,000 USPS collection boxes were removed following the aftermath of the September 11 attacks and the 2001 anthrax attacks in which letters containing anthrax spores were placed in public collection boxes. Since that time, a decrease in first-class mail volume and the onset of online bill payment processing has resulted in lower demand for collection box service in the U.S. File:Royal Mail lamp box type LB3426 (Crown of Scotland).jpgRoyal Mail lamp box type LB3426 showing the Crown of Scotland on a steel plate File:Postbox Manchester survived IRA 1996 bomb 20051020.jpgThe surviving pillar box from the 1996 Manchester bombing File:Painting postbox green in Derry for the Green Post-Box Campaign in 2008.jpgIrish Republicans painting a Royal Mail postbox in Derry for the Green Post-Box Campaign in 2008  Colours  Colors of post boxes for standard mailings.

It was introduced in the state of S√£o Paulo, where it is widely played as the basis for the m√∫sica caipira, a type of folk-country music originating in the caipira country of south-central Brazil. Origins Violeiro playing, by Almeida J√∫nior The origins of the viola caipira are obscure, but evidence suggests it evolved from the vihuela/viola de mano that Spanish and Portuguese settlers took to the new world. It has also similarities with the 5 course baroque guitar, that elsewhere evolved into the modern guitar. It is likely a descendant of one of the many folk guitars that have traditionally been played in Portugal. The viola braguesa and viola amarantina, for instance, are two types of ten-string guitars from the north of Portugal,See Lark in the Morning which are closely related to the viola caipira. Some have described the viola caipira as Brazil's national instrument,See for example Brad Hoyt's essay which also includes some photos of the viola caipira but others argue that the tambourine-like pandeiro has a stronger claim.http://www.brazilproductions.com/html/instrument.html The Brazilian Embassy in Washington lists a national flower among the official symbols of Brazil, but no national musical instrument.Brazilian Embassy website What is undisputed is that the viola caipira was introduced in S√£o Paulo before the viol√£o, and is the basis for the m√∫sica caipira, or S√£o Paulo's folk music, as Inezita Barroso states. Tuning and playing technique A large number of tunings are used; open tunings are common. Unlike most steel-string guitars, its strings are plucked with the fingers of the right hand similarly to the technique used for classical and flamenco guitars, rather than by the use of a plectrum. Popularity Viola caipira on display Violas are present in nearly all Brazilian music forms, anywhere in the country (although it is declining in some places). It most often associated with Caipira Music (Brazilian country music), with some forms of North-Eastern music and with folkloric music. It was once used to play urban music, like choro, samba and Maxixe, but has been replaced by the acoustic guitar. Well-known players of Brazilian viola include Z√© C√¥co do Riach√£o (composer from Minas Gerais), Toninho Ramos (composer from Minas Gerais live in France) and Almir Sater (successful singer-songwriter from Mato Grosso do Sul). A National Association of Viola Players (Associa√ß√£o Nacional dos Violeiros) has been founded in 2004 and the Ministry of Culture has declared the preservation of the Viola tradition as of national interest.

He was awarded the title International Master in 1972, but is now best known as a chess author and presenter of the game on television. Biography At the 19th Chess Olympiad, held at Siegen 1970, he won the gold medal for best score on board 3 (78.1%). He won the British Chess Championship in 1973 and 1975. In international competition, he had many fine performances, but failed to achieve the results required for the title of International Grandmaster. During his time as a PhD student at Cambridge, Hartston became the first person to stack the pieces from an entire chess set on top of a single white rook. from 15:20 He studied mathematics at Jesus College, Cambridge but did not complete his PhD on number theory as he spent too much time playing chess. Since the early 1970s, he has made many TV appearances for the BBC, usually in the role of expert commentator and analyst on world title matches, including Fischer-Spassky '72, Karpov-Korchnoi '78, Kasparov-Short '93 and Kasparov-Anand '95. He twice won the BBC Master Game competition before taking over from Leonard Barden as its resident expert. During the 1980s he presented the BBC series Play Chess. In recent years he has diversified into a number of creative areas, running competitions in creative thinking for The Independent newspaper and the Mind Sports Olympiad. He writes the off-beat Beachcomber column for the Daily Express and has authored books on chess, mathematics, humour and trivia. He has also been a regular guest on the BBC Radio 4 and occasional TV programme, Puzzle Panel and appeared in Series 8 of The Museum of Curiosity also on Radio 4. Aside from his chess and media-related activities, Hartston is a mathematician and industrial psychologist. He was educated at City of London School and Jesus College, Cambridge, where he studied mathematics. During the 1980s, he was recruited by Meredith Belbin, at the Industrial Training Research Unit in Cambridge, to work as part of a multi-disciplinary team researching the dynamics of team roles. While continuing to write the Beachcomber column and other features for the Daily Express, he has also been behind the launching of the now defunct wakkipedia.com Internet site of useless information. His latest publication is Even More Things That Nobody Knows (Atlantic Books), a further discussion of 501 unanswered questions ranging from science to history, including a good supply of typically quirky items. Hartston was the first of three British chess champions to be married to Woman Grandmaster Dr Jana Bellin (n√©e Malypetrova). With his second wife, Elizabeth, he had two sons, James and Nicholas. On 2 April 2013 it was reported that Hartston had \\"perfected\\" a formula for predicting the winner of the Grand National horse race, in a study commissioned by bookmaker William Hill. The story of the winning formula has since been widely thought to be an April Fools joke that many have fallen for. In 2013 Hartston and his friend Josef Kollar became regular 'viewers' on the Channel 4 programme Gogglebox. Bibliography *The Grunfeld Defence (1971), B. T.

Scotland did not have a representative international team at the time of Denness' career, so he could only play for England at Test and ODI level. He was the fifth player born in Scotland to play for England, after Gregor MacGregor, Ian Peebles, David Larter and Eric Russell, but remains the only England captain to be born in Scotland (Douglas Jardine and Tony Greig had Scottish parents, but Jardine was born in Bombay and Greig in South Africa). Denness later became an ICC match referee. He was one of the inaugural inductees into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1975. He was president of Kent County Cricket Club in 2012‚Äì13. Early life Denness was born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, Scotland. His father was employed by W.D. & H.O. Wills, a tobacco importer and cigarette manufacturer and part of Imperial Tobacco. After his family moved to Ayr, he was educated at Ayr Academy, where he played rugby with Ian Ure and Ian McLauchlan and played for Ayr Cricket Club at Cambusdoon, where he was coached by former Sussex player Charles Oakes. Denness was selected to play cricket for Scotland against Ireland in 1959 while still at school. Former Kent bowler Jimmy Allan was also in the Scotland team, and he suggested Denness's name to his former county. E. W. Swanton also met Denness in Ayr and put in a good word, and Les Ames invited Denness to a trial in 1961. Domestic cricket career Denness made his first-class debut for Kent against Essex in July 1962, but was dismissed by Jim Laker twice on a turning pitch for 0 and 3. But he quickly established himself in the team, scoring over 1,000 runs in the 1963 season. From 1964 played as an opening batsman in partnership with Brian Luckhurst. He became a tall, stylish right-handed batsman. He received his county cap in 1965 and Kent won the County Championship in 1970 for the first time since 1913. He succeeded Colin Cowdrey as Kent captain at the beginning of the 1972 cricket season, having often substituted for Cowdrey when he was on Test duty. Under his captaincy, the club won the John Player League three times (1972, 1973, 1976), the Benson & Hedges Cup twice (1973, 1976), and the Gillette Cup once (in 1974; also his benefit season). Denness was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1975. After 5 years as captain, the club voted to replace him as captain by Asif Iqbal at the end of the 1976 season. After being dismissed as captain at Kent, he moved to Essex in 1977, helping the club to win the County Championship and Benson & Hedges Cup in 1979. He retired after the 1980 English cricket season. In all, he made 501 appearances in first-class cricket and 232 more in one day matches. He scored over 30,000 domestic runs in all, including 33 first class hundreds and a best of 195, and six one-day centuries with a top score of 188 not out. He also took two wickets with his occasional bowling.Gracious captain; Kent legend, ESPNcricinfo, 20 April 2013 He scored over 1,000 first-class runs in 14 English cricket seasons. After he retired as a player at the end of the 1980 English cricket season Denness became 2nd XI captain at Essex and also worked as a coach. Outside cricket he had jobs in finance, insurance and public relations.My Scottish chum, ESPNcricinfo, 20 April 2013 Test cricket Denness played for England in 28 Tests and was captain on 19 occasions, winning six, losing five and drawing eight matches. He made his Test debut in the final test against New Zealand at The Oval in 1969. After the cancellation of the 1970 South Africa tour, Denness played in the first match against the Rest of the World XI in 1970, before being dropped. He was vice-captain on the tour to India in 1972-3, captained by Tony Lewis, and he was appointed to replace Ray Illingworth as captain in September 1973. As captain, he suffered a lack of support from Geoffrey Boycott, who had hoped to be appointed captain instead, and these tensions contributed to the downfall of Denness as a skipper. Boycott played in the first 6 Tests with Denness as captain, including the five matches in the 1‚Äì1 drawn series in the West Indies and the first Test of a 3‚Äì0 whitewash against India, during which Denness scored his first two Test centuries, but then Boycott then refused to play under Denness and remained out of the Test team until 1977. After a 0‚Äì0 drawn three-match series against Pakistan at home in 1974, Boycott's boycott left England exposed in several matches against the fast bowling of Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson in the Ashes series in Australia in 1974-5. Denness dropped himself from the England team for the 4th Test at Sydney after scoring only 65 runs in 6 innings (6, 26, 2, 20, 8, 2) in the first three Tests,The captain who dropped himself, ESPNcricinfo, 12 December 2009 although he was selected again for the 5th Test in Adelaide after his replacement John Edrich was injured, and achieving his highest Test score of 188 at Melbourne in the 6th Test to win by an innings. The victory was little consolation, as Australia had already won four of the six matches in the series. Once while in Australia, Denness received an envelope that had been sent with the address \\"Mike Denness, cricketer\\". The letter inside read, \\"Should this reach you, the post office clearly thinks more of your ability than I do.\\"Mike Atherton, The Times, 14 August 2008, p.62 He scored another large Test century, 181, when the tour continued to New Zealand, and captained England in the 1975 Cricket World Cup, losing to Australia in the semi-final. He stepped down from the captaincy after losing the 1st Test of the 1975 Ashes series against Australia, at Edgbaston, by an innings (he had been dismissed for 3 and 8). He was replaced by Tony Greig and never played for England again. Denness scored 1,667 runs in his 28 Tests, including four centuries. His seven accompanying half-centuries helped to leave him with a Test batting average of 39.69. His ODI career was less successful, playing only 12 matches and scoring 264 runs at an average of 29.33, with a best of 66. Match referee  Denness was appointed as an ICC match referee in 1996. He caused controversy after the Port Elizabeth Test between South Africa and the visiting Indians in 2001-2 when he sanctioned six Indian players, four including Virender Sehwag and Harbhajan Singh for excessive appealing, Sachin Tendulkar for alleged ball- tampering, and the captain Sourav Ganguly for failing to control his players. At first, India refused to accept the sanctions and named the players for the following Test match. The International Cricket Council responded by stripping the game of Test match status. Soon after, both the BCCI and ICC decided to establish a referee committee to verify Denness's conclusions. The match referee was heavily criticised for failing to explain his actions at a press conference, thus infuriating the Indian cricket establishment.\\"No enlightment from Denness at farcical press conference\\" (20 November 2001) ESPN CricInfo The BCCI later decided to forget the incident on humanitarian grounds, after Denness underwent heart surgery. In March 2002, Denness' role as a match referee came to an end, when the ICC rejected his bid for their newly formed Elite Panel of Referees, although he had been put forward by the ECB as a candidate. Later life Denness became a committee member at Kent, and was chairman of cricket at Kent until he resigned in 2004 over a dispute involving Andrew Symonds. He was president of Kent County Cricket Club in 2012‚Äì13, Denness was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to sport. Denness died of cancer on 19 April 2013. He published his autobiography, I Declare, in 1977. He was an inaugural member of the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and was a member of the Scottish Cricket Hall of Fame. He married his childhood sweetheart, Molly, in 1964. They had a son and two daughters. They were divorced. He died at the age of 72 after a battle with cancer. He was survived by his partner, Doreen Wadlow, and his three children.

While the two brothers‚Äô names became iconic, they had other siblings, including sisters, that also exhibited psychic abilities and performed shows with them. Biography A sketch revealing the s√©ance trick that Horatio (left) would use. The brothers were sons of Zephaniah Eddy and his wife Julia Maccombs, natives of Vermont. It was claimed that their family could be traced back to the Salem witch trials, and that they had a long history of psychic ability. Growing up on a small farm near Chittenden, Vermont, both brothers claimed to have exhibited strong psychic abilities from an early age. Both the sons took up mediumship and held s√©ances, they claimed to perform ectoplasm materializations and communicate with spirit guides. William would work in a s√©ance cabinet on occasion and his brother Horatio would sit outside a cloth screen where they would claim spirits would play musical instruments behind the screen.Raymond Buckland. (2005). The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication. Visible Ink Press. pp.120‚Äì121. . In 1870, William and Horatio were living with their widowed mother Julia in Chittenden. There, the Eddy family opened a small inn, called the Green Tavern. In addition to lodging travelers, the Green Tavern was also the spot of regularly scheduled s√©ances that the brothers put on for visitors from around the world.Judith Joyce. (2010). Weiser Field Guide to the Paranormal. Weiser Books. p.72. . A typical s√©ance of the Eddy Brothers would have the audience gathered in the \\"circle\\" room at the tavern. One of the brothers would enter a special spirit box at the front of the room (essentially just a small room with a chair in it) and lapse into a deep trance, at which point the show would start. It was alleged that instruments would start playing music on their own, various noises could be heard and strange lights would be seen. Tricks The Eddy brothers s√©ance trick was exposed by the magician Chung Ling Soo. The trick involved a curtain that was put across the room, with musical instruments placed on a table inside the curtain space. Two members of the audience would be selected and enter the curtain. Horatio would grasp the audience sitter's left arm and the other sitter would grasp his right arm. To the audience outside the curtain, various musical instruments would be seen floating in the air above the top of the curtain and tapping the trio on the head. A hand would also come through the curtain and write a message on a slate held by William who was sitting outside the curtain.Chung Ling Soo. (1898). Spirit Slate Writing and Kindred Phenomena. Munn & Company. pp.101‚Äì104. The trick was performed by Horatio evading control and releasing his hand. He would do this by various methods such as using a fake hand made from a piece of heavy sheet lead which he would place in his left hand and grasp the audience sitter's arm. Horatio would quietly remove his real hand with the leaden hand remaining behind, giving the sense of touch that an actual hand was there. With his hands free Horatio would manipulate the instruments and perform the alleged supernatural phenomena. The psychical researcher Hereward Carrington also revealed the sleight of hand tricks the Eddy brothers had used. Carrington described their tricks as \\"absurdly simple\\" and was surprised that people had been fooled by them.Hereward Carrington. (1907). The Physical Phenomena of Spiritualism. Herbert B.

Reeves and Alice W.A. Westgate, Family of Thomas Rogers, Mayflower Families through Five Generations (Massachusetts: General Society of Mayflower Descendants, 2000) vol. 19, page 1, 2  English origins  Thomas Rogers was born in the area of the village of Watford, in Northamptonshire, England, which has extensive history from the Roman, Dane, Viking and Saxon eras. His birth year of approximately 1571 is based on his date of marriage. Thomas Rogers was a son of William Rogers and his wife Eleanor. He married Alice Cosford in Watford parish October 24, 1597, with their six children being baptized there between 1598 and 1613. The family went to Leiden from England sometime after their last child, Margaret, was baptized in 1613.  In Leiden  Thomas Rogers was a member of the English Separatist church and sometime after 1613, the last recorded baptism of his children, he, his wife, and children, moved to Leiden as members of the Separatist church there. The earliest Leiden record for Thomas Rogers notes that on February 14, 1614 he bought a house on Barabarasteeg from Jan Bloemsaer, a baker. Leiden records also notes that Rogers became a citizen of Leiden on June 25, 1618, guaranteed by Englishmen William Jepson from Worksop, Nottinghamshire and Roger Wilson of Sandwich, co. Kent. That record states that he was a merchant of camlet, a luxury Asian-type fabric made from a combination of silk and camel's hair.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 345 Other Leiden records for Thomas Rogers show that in 1619, when he was preparing to sell his house in preparation for his departure from Leiden for America, he found that his property still had an outstanding lien on it, forcing him to sue Jan Bloemsaer, from whom he originally purchased the home, and bondsman Gerrit Gerritsz. He was finally able to sell his home on April 1, 1620 to Mordecheus Colven for three hundred guilders. Per author Eugene Stratton, the 1622 Leiden poll tax listed the family of Thomas Rogers residing there in poverty, but apparently without his wife Alice. Instead of Alice, this family included a possible second wife named Elizabeth ‚Äì or the Dutch variant Elsgen, and with the children of Thomas Rogers ‚Äì son John and daughters Lysbeth (Dutch for Elizabeth) and Grietgen (Dutch for Margaret).  Mayflower voyage  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 Thomas Rogers traveled on the Mayflower with only his eldest son Joseph, leaving behind in Leiden his wife and their three other children ‚Äì John, Elizabeth and Margaret. In the 1622 poll tax for Leiden, Rogers' family were found among the poor of Leiden, residing at the rear of Anthony Clement's home. His possible second wife, who author Eugene Stratton lists as Elizabeth (or Elsgen) in the 1622 poll tax, may have died in Leiden sometime between 1622 and when his son John and possibly his daughters came to Plymouth sometime after 1627. William Bradford's later recollection of Thomas Rogers and his son embarked on the Mayflower: \\"Thomas Rogers, and Joseph, his sone. His other children came afterwards.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 Thomas Rogers and his 18-year-old son Joseph departed Plymouth, England aboard the Mayflower on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document. Thomas Rogers was the 18th signatory to the Mayflower Compact. His son Joseph was then about 18 years of age and could not sign the Compact.  Family  Confusion has arisen related to the discovery by author Eugene Stratton of the listing of an \\"Elsgen Rogiers\\" in Leiden's 1622 poll tax records, where she is noted as the wife of Thomas Rogers. In her care were three of Thomas Rogers' children, who remained in Leiden after he departed on the Mayflower with his son Joseph. The children were listed as Jan Tomasz (John), Lysbeth (Elizabeth) and Grietgen (Margaret) Rogiers (Rogers). However, the name \\"Elsgen\\" is also the name used by Alice (n√©e Carpenter), married to Separatist Edward Southworth, during their time in Leiden. Further, Alice Cosford Rogers is reported to have died shortly after the poll was taken on June 3, 1622 in Leiden. This, alongside the fact that the three youngest children listed with her were baptized in England, and the fact that their daughter Elizabeth's name while in Leiden was listed as \\"Lysbeth,\\" point to the greater likelihood that \\"Elsgen\\" is Alice. Thomas Rogers married Alice Cosford in the parish of Watford, Northamptonshire, England on October 24, 1597. She was baptized in Watford May 10, 1573 and was a daughter of George and Margaret (n√©e Wills) Cosford. Both she and her husband Thomas were named in her father's will in 1608. Children of Thomas and Alice Rogers: Between 1598 and 1613 they had six children who were baptized in the parish of Watford, Northamptonshire, England. * Thomas Rogers.

Baptized January 23, 1602 and came to Plymouth on the Mayflower with his father in 1620. He had eight children, most born in Duxbury. A wife \\"Hannah\\" is mentioned in his will, but it is not known when they married or if she is the mother of his children. He died in Nauset, now Eastham, on January 15, 1678, and was buried in Old Cove Burial Ground there. Joseph Rogers was a notable person in Plymouth Colony. Over the years, he was involved in the founding of Bridgewater and Eastham. His name appears in the following colony records: 1623 Division of Land with Wm. Brewster - in the 1623 Plymouth Colony land division, Joseph Rogers was allotted two acres - one for himself and one on behalf of his late father; 1626 Purchasers list (colony investors); 1627 Division of Cattle with Wm. Bradford; 1633-34 Tax Lists ‚Äì with his brother John on the 1633 list along with being a freeman that year; 1643 Able to Bear Arms List (with his brother John ‚Äì with his surname given as \\"Roger\\").

He married Anna Churchman in Plymouth on April 16, 1639 and had six children: Abigail, John, Elizabeth, Edward, John, and Hannah. He died in Duxbury on August 27, 1691. * Elizabeth Rogers. Baptized December 26, 1609. She is listed as \\"Lysbeth\\", the Dutch variant of Elizabeth, on the 1622 Leiden poll tax. She is believed to have come to New England sometime between 1627 and 1634. Possibly married Samuel Eddy.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 346, 433, 436 * Margaret Rogers. Baptized May 30, 1613. She is listed as \\"Grietgen\\", the Dutch variant of Margaret, on the 1622 Leiden poll tax. She is believed to have come to New England sometime between 1627 and 1634. Per author Caleb Johnson, about 1629 or 1630 Thomas Rogers' three children were residing in Leiden, John, Elizabeth and Margaret, and the remainder of the church members residing in Leiden, came to Plymouth at colony expense. Surviving family members: Randy Rasmussen  Death and burial of Thomas Rogers  Thomas Rogers died sometime in the winter of 1620/21.

Early life Tony Lewis was born in Swansea, the first of two children of Wilfrid Lewis and his wife Marjorie (n√©e Flower). The family moved to Neath after the Second World War. Following his service in the war as a major, Wilfrid managed an insurance office in Neath, and then joined the Civil Service.Tony Lewis, Taking Fresh Guard, Headline, London, 2004, pp. 1‚Äì8. Tony Lewis attended the Gnoll School in Neath and Neath Grammar School for Boys, where he learned the violin exceptionally well and was selected for the National Youth Orchestra of Wales, as well as playing cricket and rugby for the school. He represented the Welsh Secondary Schools at cricket for five years and captained them for three. In rugby football he made his first-class debut for Neath followed by a full season for Gloucester, as well as representing the Royal Air Force and Cambridge University. He further played for the Air Force at cricket for both the Royal Air Force and Combined Services.Lewis, Taking Fresh Guard, pp. 19‚Äì36. At Christ's College, Cambridge, he read History in which he graduated as BA and MA. In his first University year he was a freshman Double Blue in rugby football and cricket. He was elected President of the Christ's College Marguerites and in 1962, President of the University Hawks Club, residence of the highest achievers in all Cambridge sports. Cricket career Tony Lewis made his first-class cricket debut in 1955 at the age of 17, playing for Glamorgan against Leicestershire in the County ChampionshipLeicestershire v Glamorgan, 1955 while still at Neath Grammar School. He was also chosen as a first violinist by the National Youth Orchestra of Wales in the same year.Tony Lewis, Playing Days, Stanley Paul, London, 1985, pp. 10‚Äì16. After doing his national service in the RAF,Lewis, Playing Days, pp. 38‚Äì45. he established himself in first-class cricket in 1960, when in his first year at Christ's College, he scored 1307 runs for Cambridge University at 43.56, followed by 616 runs at 30.80 when he played for Glamorgan later in the season. He captained Cambridge in his final season there in 1962, when in all matches he made 2188 runs at 40.51, with five centuries. He played all of his county cricket as an amateur until that status was abolished at the start of the 1963 season. He also topped 2000 runs in 1966, when he made 2190 runs, more than anybody else in the season, at 40.51, including his only double-century, 223 against Kent at Gravesend after Glamorgan had followed on. He captained Glamorgan from 1967 to 1972, taking the county to its second championship in 1969, when Glamorgan went through the season undefeated. Until the abolition of amateur status in 1963, when all players became known simply as 'Cricketers', Lewis played his county cricket as an amateur, representing the Gentlemen in the Gentlemen v Players matches. He was the last man to captain England on his Test debut. He led England on a gruelling five-month tour in 1972/73 to India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Despite having no Test match experience, Lewis scored 70 not out in his debut Test in Delhi,India v England, Delhi, 1972‚Äì73 which guided England to their first Test victory in India since 1951. England lost the next two Tests, but Lewis went on to score his maiden Test hundred (125) in Kanpur. He was nominated Man of the Match in both the Delhi and the Kanpur Tests. He went on to captain England eight times, winning once, losing twice and drawing five times. After the India series, his team went on to draw with Pakistan in a three-Test series. In the light of his achievements, Lewis was picked as vice captain to Ray Illingworth, when the latter returned from his self-imposed hiatus the following summer. Lewis was asked by the selectors to make himself available to lead the England team in the West Indies on the 1973‚Äì74 tour, but having had an injury-plagued season in 1973, he declined in order to take up opportunities in writing and broadcasting. Lewis is one of two England cricket captains to come out of Neath Grammar School, the other being Cyril Walters when he was playing for Worcestershire. Walters was nominated captain for a single Test when R. E. S. Wyatt withdrew at the last moment, and captains were always chosen from the amateurs in the team. Lewis, however, remains the only Glamorgan player to captain England and the only one to lead England on a major Test tour abroad. Tony Lewis and Allan Watkins are the only Glamorgan players who have scored a century in a Test match for England. Lewis, however, was much more than a cricketer. In 1968 and for three years, he was one of the Founding Members of the Sports Council for Wales. Tony Lewis sat on MCC committees from 1967 (Pitches, Cricket and Registration) and on a long succession of MCC and ECB boards and committees, until he founded MCC's World Cricket Committee in 2006 which he chaired until 2011. The MCC invested him with the highest honour it fell within its powers to give a member, that of Honorary Life Vice President, from the date of his retirement in 2011. He was the thirty-first MCC member to be so honoured. He was MCC's Bi-Centenary President for two years: 1998-2000. Later career Lewis also played rugby union for Neath and Gloucester before winning a blue for Cambridge in The Varsity Match in 1959. Chronic knee trouble, which had curtailed his rugby career, meant that Lewis retired from cricket at the age of 34, but writing and broadcasting had always been his main pursuit since 1965, when he began writing rugby union reports for The Daily Telegraph.Lewis, Playing Days, pp. 89‚Äì92. In 1975 he was appointed Cricket and Rugby correspondent of The Sunday Telegraph. He was a founding member of the Sports Council for Wales in 1968 and put in long service to Glamorgan County Cricket Club as chairman, chairman of cricket followed later as president and trustee. His broadcasting extended from Test Match Special to the anchor man of all of BBC television's coverage of cricket, from 1975 to 1999, and he was the initial presenter (10 years) of the popular Radio 4 magazine programme, Sport on Four. After long service to cricket at Lord's ‚Äì committee work from 1967 to 2011 ‚Äì he created, and chaired for five years, the MCC World Cricket Committee, from 2006 to 2011, opposing all cricket decisions that were led by money, race or religion. He initiated MCC research into the use of both the white and pink ball in Day/Night Test matches. He was MCC President for two years (1998‚Äì2000), during which he joined with his predecessor Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie in the work of securing admission to the Club of women members and securing their playing programme while Ch. MCC Cricket 2001‚Äì2006. He became, in 2011, the 31st Honorary Life Vice-President of MCC to be nominated by the Club, the highest honour possible to award to a Member. Lewis turned his high profile in cricket and broadcasting to the benefit of his home country's tourist board. When WTB Chairman for three terms, he made an important strategic change as he studied the passage of American tourists year after year circumnavigating Wales on their visits to the United Kingdom. Their route was from London Heathrow, to Alton Towers, to Scotland, on to Ireland and home again. He urged what he called event-led tourism to Wales; this bore fruit immediately as Wales hosted the Rugby World Cup in 1999, and was followed by his personal leadership between 2000 and 2002 of the successful Wales bid to stage a Ryder Cup on Welsh soil for the first time, at Celtic Manor, Newport, in 2010. He worked for the University College of Wales, Newport, as a consultant for five years. His sporting contribution continued as captain of Royal Porthcawl Golf Club in 2012. Lewis served eight years as chairman of the Wales Tourist Board and as a member of the British Tourist Authority. For a three-year term he was Chairman of the Welsh National Opera Company. He was also a founding Trustee of the Wales Millennium Centre. His first Committee work for the Marylebone Cricket Club was in 1964, and his last in 2011; apart from being MCC Millennium President from 1998 to 2000, he chaired both the Cricket Committee for five years and initiated and chaired MCC's World Cricket Committee, from 2006 to 2011. He led the research into the Television Review System (DRS); with his predecessor he secured a two-thirds majority of 18,000 MCC members to win women's admittance into full MCC membership. This was exactly ten years before the 2010 Equality Act was law. Lewis led the research and development of the use of the pink cricket ball for day-night Test cricket in order to arrest declines in attendances, especially in the Southern Hemisphere. He chaired and led MCC's work to erect an iconic media centre in 1998 which won high architectural awards. In 2011 the MCC committee bestowed on him its highest possible recognition for his contributions by making him the 31st Honorary Life Vice-President nominated by members of the Club. During this time he was a consultant to World Sport Group and Windsor (later Longreach) Insurance. Lewis served a year as High Sheriff of Mid Glamorgan for 1998. He was awarded the CBE for services to cricket, broadcasting and Wales, in the 2004 New Year Honours. He is an honorary Fellow of several Welsh universities: Cardiff, Swansea and University of Glamorgan. From 2003, Lewis was a consultant to University College of Wales, Newport, and, having returned to live in Porthcawl in 2010 accepted the offices of Captain, Royal Porthcawl Golf Club and President, Wales, of the Lord's Taverners charity, both organisations among his lifetime allegiances which he still continues. He continued his freelance writing particularly as a weekly columnist for the Western Mail Magazine, launched January 2015 and in a wide range of freelance work. In 1962 he married Joan Pritchard, who had attended Neath Grammar School for Girls and the Laban Art of Movement Studio in Addlestone, Surrey.Lewis, Playing Days, pp. 84‚Äì85. They have two daughters, Joanna and Anabel.Lewis, Playing Days, p. 93. Both daughters, former Millfield pupils, are full members of MCC, while Mrs Lewis, former chair of Governors at Edgarley Preparatory School for over a decade, is one of MCC's few lady Honorary Members.

The MPC combines sampling and sequencing functions. The first MPCs were designed by Roger Linn, who had designed the successful LM-1 and LinnDrum drum machines. He aimed to create an intuitive instrument, with a grid of pads that could be played similarly to a traditional instrument such as a keyboard or drum kit. Rhythms can be built not just from samples of percussion but samples of any sound, such as horns or synthesizers. Linn anticipated that users would sample short sounds; to his surprise, they also sampled long sequences of music. The MPC had a major influence on the development of electronic and hip hop music, allowing musicians and producers to create elaborate tracks without a studio and opening the way for new sampling techniques. Development By the late 1980s, drum machines had become popular for creating beats and loops without musicians, and hip hop artists were using samplers to take portions of existing recordings and create new compositions. Grooveboxes, machines that combined these functions, such as those by E-mu Systems, required knowledge of music production and cost up to $10,000.left The original MPC, the MPC-60, was a collaboration between the Japanese company Akai and the American engineer Roger Linn. Linn had designed the successful LM-1 and LinnDrum, two of the earliest drum machines to use samples (prerecorded sounds). His company Linn Electronics had closed following the failure of the Linn 9000, a drum machine and sampler. According to Linn, \\"[The collaboration] was a good fit because Akai needed a creative designer with ideas and I didn't want to do sales, marketing, finance or manufacturing, all of which Akai was very good at.\\" Linn described the MPC as an attempt to \\"properly re-engineer\\" the Linn 9000. He disliked reading instruction manuals and wanted to create an intuitive interface that simplified music production. He designed the functions, including the panel layout and hardware specification, and created the software with his team. He credited the circuitry to a team led by English engineer David Cockerell. Akai did the production engineering, making it \\"more manufacturable\\". The first model, the MPC60 (MIDI Production Center), was released in December 08,1988 and retailed for $5,000. It was followed by the MPC60 MkII, the MPC2000, and several subsequent models. Linn left Akai after the company went out of business and its assets were purchased by Numark. Akai has continued to produce MPC models without Linn. Linn was critical, saying: \\"Akai seems to be making slight changes to my old 1986 designs for the original MPC, basically rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\\"  Features  An MPC2000 Instead of the switches and small hard buttons of earlier devices, the MPC has a 4x4 grid of large, pressure-sensitive rubber pads which can be played similarly to a keyboard. The interface was simpler than those of competing instruments; it can be used without a studio and connected to a normal sound system. According to Vox', \\"most importantly, it wasn‚Äôt an enormous, stationary mixing panel with as many buttons as an airplane cockpit\\". Whereas prior artists had sampled long pieces of music, the MPC allowed them to sample smaller portions, assign them to separate pads, and trigger them independently, similarly to playing a traditional instrument such as a keyboard or drum kit. Rhythms can be built not just from percussion samples but any sampled sound, such as horns or synthesizers. The MPC60 only allows sample lengths of up to 13 seconds, as sampling memory was expensive at the time and Linn expected users to sample short sounds to create rhythms; he did not anticipate that they would sample long loops. Functions are selected and samples are edited with two knobs. Red ‚Äúrecord‚Äù and ‚Äúoverdub‚Äù buttons are used to save or loop beats. The MPC60 has an LCD screen and came with floppy disks with sounds and instruments.  Legacy  270x270px Kanye West performing with an MPC 2000XL According to Vox, the ability to create percussion from any kind of sound turned sampling into a \\"new artform\\" and allowed for new styles of music. The MPC's affordability and accessibility had a \\"democratising\\" effect on music. Artists could create tracks on a single machine without the need of a studio or music theory knowledge, and it was inviting to artists who did not play traditional instruments or had no music education. Users learnt how to push the technical limits of the machine; for example, producer Om‚ÄôMas Keith would record samples at high speeds, then slow them to their original pitch on the MPC, allowing him to record samples longer than the MPC's maximum. According to Vox, \\"The explosion of electronic music and hip hop could not have happened without a machine as intimately connected to the creative process as the MPC. It challenged the notion of what a band can look like, or what it takes to be a successful musician. No longer does one need five capable musicians and instruments.\\" MPCs continue to be used in music, even with the advent of digital audio workstations, and fetch high prices on the used market. The 4x4 grid of pads was adopted by numerous manufacturers and became standard in DJ technology. According to Engadget, \\"the impact of Akai's MPC series on hip hop cannot be overstated\\". It credited the MPC's pad design and price for \\"[opening up] music production to a whole new audience\\". British rapper Jehst saw it as the next step in hip hop evolution after the TR-808, TR-909 and DMX drum machines. Producer DJ Shadow used an MPC60 to create his influential 1996 album Endtroducing, which is composed entirely of samples. Rapper Kanye West used the MPC to compose several of his best-known songs and much of his breakthrough album The College Dropout. West closed the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards with a performance of his track \\"Runaway\\" on an MPC.

Present hypotheses for the placement of Valentia include Wales, with its capital at Deva (Chester); Cumbria south of Hadrian's Wall, with its capital at Luguvalium (Carlisle); and the lands between the Antonine Wall and Hadrian's Wall, possibly with a capital at Habitancum (Risingham). Camden, placing Valentia between the walls. Another possible arrangement of the late Roman provinces, with Valentia tentatively marked in Cumbria or northern Wales Name Its name properly refers the Eastern emperor Valens but some also hold it to have honoured Valentinian. Some researchers such as S. H. Rosenbaum, who place Valentia in far northern Britain also believe the name included wordplay with the Latin ' (\\"wall\\"), cf. the island Munitia (wordplay on munitio) of Aethicus Ister's Cosmography. History Ammianus Marcellinus records that, after dealing with the Pannonian rebel Valentine, Count Theodosius :\\"...turned his attention to make many necessary amendments, feeling wholly free from any danger in such attempts, since it was plain that all his enterprises were attended by a propitious fortune. So he restored cities and fortresses, as we have already mentioned, and established stations and outposts on our frontiers; and he so completely recovered the province which had yielded subjection to the enemy, that through his agency it was again brought under the authority of its legitimate ruler, and from that time forth was called Valentia, by desire of the emperor, as a memorial of his success.\\"Ammianus Marcellinus.

It represented the Roman recovery from the Great Conspiracy, which overran northern and western Britain in 367, alongside Germanic attacks on the Roman shores. Ammianus speaks of the establishment of Valentia as the renaming of a recovered province (or possibly all of the territory in Britain), but the List of Offices names Valentia's governor separately alongside all four of the British provinces known from earlier sources. It is possible a new province was conquered or formed at some time after the composition of the Verona List. The List of Offices also lists two sets of troops under the Duke of the Britains ('). One covered the island's eastern shore while the second guarded the northwest coast and formed garrisons listed east to west along Hadrian's Wall. Scholars who place Valentia in Cumbria point to emendations of the surviving text's references to the western units as evidence that the area had been thoroughly overrun during the Great Conspiracy and so formed a prime candidate for Theodosius's reconquest and new command. Ammianus also noted that the province was named \\"as if celebrating a minor triumph\\" ('). This was a lesser celebration held for unspectacular victories, as over slave revolts, and unusual for the destruction of a barbarian horde. One explanation is that the mutinous soldiers or even rebellious governors may have been involved, as full triumphs were never celebrated in victories over Roman citizens. Theodosius's lenient treatment of the conspirators involved with the rebel Valentine suggests discontent was already uncomfortably widespread.

Faroald and Zotto found the Duchies of Spoleto and Benevento. The territories which remained under Byzantine control were called \\"Romania\\" (today's Italian region of Romagna) in northeastern Italy and had its stronghold in the Exarchate of Ravenna, icluding Rome. 585 king Autari, led the Byzantines to ask, for the first time since the Lombards had entered Italy, for a truce. 751 The Lombards conquest Ravenna, but Pope Stephen II controlled the territories of Rome, Sicily, Sardinia and others. 751-756 Just when it seemed Aistulf was able to defeat all opposition on Italian soil, Pepin the Short, the old enemy of the usurpers of Liutprand's family, finally managed to overthrow the Merovingian dynasty in Gaul, deposing Childeric III and becoming king de jure as well as de facto. The support Pepin enjoyed from the papacy was decisive. Because of the threat this move represented for the new king of the Franks, an agreement between Pepin and Stephen II settled, in exchange for the formal royal anointing, the descent of the Franks in Italy. In 754, the Lombard army, deployed in defence of the Locks in Val di Susa, was defeated by the Franks. Aistulf, perched in Pavia, had to accept a treaty that required the delivery of hostages and territorial concessions, but two years later resumed the war against the pope, who in turn called on the Franks. Defeated again, Aistulf had to accept much harsher conditions: Ravenna was returned not to the Byzantines, but to the pope, increasing the core area of the Patrimony of St. Peter; Aistulf had to accept a sort of Frankish protectorate, the loss of territorial continuity of his domains, and payment of substantial compensation. The duchies of Spoleto and Benevento were quick to ally themselves with the victors. Aistulf died in 756, shortly after this severe humiliation. In 772 CE The Roman pope Adrian I, of the opposite party of Desiderius, reversed the delicate game of alliances, demanding the surrender of the area never ceded by Desiderius and thus causing him to resume the war against the cities of Romagna. Charlemagne, though he had just begun his campaign against the Saxons, came to the aid of the pope. He feared the capture of Rome by the Lombards and the consequent loss of prestige that would follow. Between 773 and 774 he invaded Italy. Once again the defence of the Locks was ineffective, the fault of the divisions among the Lombards. Charlemagne, having prevailed against a tough resistance, captured the capital of the kingdom, Pavia. Charles then called himself Gratia Dei rex Francorum et Langobardorum (\\"By the grace of God king of the Franks and the Lombards\\"), realizing a personal union of the two kingdoms. Thus ended the Lombard Kingdom in Latin Italy, led by the Roman Pope Adrian I.

The Confessions. Trans. J.M. Cohen. New York: Penguin (1953), 529-30. Due to a section of the book entitled \\"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\\", Emile was banned in Paris and Geneva and was publicly burned in 1762, the year of its first publication.E. Montin, \\"Introduction to J. Rousseau's √âmile: or, Treatise on education by Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\", William Harold Payne, transl. (D. Appleton & Co., 1908) p. 316. During the French Revolution, Emile served as the inspiration for what became a new national system of education.Jean Bloch traces the reception of Emile in France, particularly amongst the revolutionaries, in his book Rousseauism and Education in Eighteenth-century France Oxford: Voltaire Foundation (1995). Politics and philosophy The work tackles fundamental political and philosophical questions about the relationship between the individual and society‚Äîhow, in particular, the individual might retain what Rousseau saw as innate human goodness while remaining part of a corrupting collectivity. Its opening sentence: \\"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man\\". Rousseau seeks to describe a system of education that would enable the natural man he identifies in The Social Contract (1762) to survive corrupt society. He employs the novelistic device of Emile and his tutor to illustrate how such an ideal citizen might be educated. Emile is scarcely a detailed parenting guide but it does contain some specific advice on raising children.Rousseau, responding in frustration to what he perceived as a gross misunderstanding of his text, wrote in Lettres de la montagne: \\"Il s'sagit d'un nouveau syst√®me d'√®ducation dont j'offre le plan √† l'examen des sages, et non pas d'une m√©thode pour les p√®res et les m√®res, √† laquelle je n'ai jamais song√©\\". [It is about a new system of education, whose outline I offer up for learned scrutiny, and not a method for fathers and mothers, which I've never contemplated.] Qtd. in Peter Jimack, Rousseau: √âmile. London: Grant and Cutler, Ltd. (1983), 47. It is regarded by some as the first philosophy of education in Western culture to have a serious claim to completeness, as well as being one of the first Bildungsroman novels.Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. Emile. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 6. Book divisions The text is divided into five books: the first three are dedicated to the child Emile, the fourth to an exploration of the adolescent, and the fifth to outlining the education of his female counterpart Sophie, as well as to Emile's domestic and civic life. Book I Rousseau In Book I, Rousseau discusses not only his fundamental philosophy but also begins to outline how one would have to raise a child to conform with that philosophy. He begins with the early physical and emotional development of the infant and the child. Emile attempts to \\"find a way of resolving the contradictions between the natural man who is 'all for himself' and the implications of life in society\\".Jimack, 33. The famous opening line does not bode well for the educational project‚Äî\\"Everything is good as it leaves the hands of the Author of things; everything degenerates in the hands of man\\".Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Emile, or On Education. Trans. Allan Bloom. New York: Basic Books (1979), 37. But Rousseau acknowledges that every society \\"must choose between making a man or a citizen\\"Rousseau, 39. and that the best \\"social institutions are those that best know how to denature man, to take his absolute existence from him in order to give him a relative one and transport the I into the common unity\\".Roussesau, 40. To \\"denature man\\" for Rousseau is to suppress some of the \\"natural\\" instincts that he extols in The Social Contract, published the same year as Emile, but while it might seem that for Rousseau such a process would be entirely negative, this is not so. Emile is not a panegyric for the loss of the noble savage, a term Rousseau never actually used. Instead, it is an effort to explain how natural man can live within society. Many of Rousseau's suggestions in this book are restatements of the ideas of other educational reformers. For example, he endorses Locke's program of \\"harden[ing children's] bodies against the intemperance of season, climates, elements; against hunger, thirst, fatigue\\".Rousseau, 47. He also emphasizes the perils of swaddling and the benefits of mothers nursing their own infants. Rousseau's enthusiasm for breastfeeding led him to argue: \\"[B]ut let mothers deign to nurse their children, morals will reform themselves, nature's sentiments will be awakened in every heart, the state will be repeopled\\"Rousseau, 46.‚Äîa hyperbole that demonstrates Rousseau's commitment to grandiose rhetoric. As Peter Jimack, the noted Rousseau scholar, argues: \\"Rousseau consciously sought to find the striking, lapidary phrase which would compel the attention of his readers and move their hearts, even when it meant, as it often did, an exaggeration of his thought\\". And, in fact, Rousseau's pronouncements, although not original, effected a revolution in swaddling and breastfeeding.Jimack, 46-7. Book II The second book concerns the initial interactions of the child with the world. Rousseau believed that at this phase the education of children should be derived less from books and more from the child's interactions with the world, with an emphasis on developing the senses, and the ability to draw inferences from them. Rousseau concludes the chapter with an example of a boy who has been successfully educated through this phase. The father takes the boy out flying kites, and asks the child to infer the position of the kite by looking only at the shadow. This is a task that the child has never specifically been taught, but through inference and understanding of the physical world, the child is able to succeed in his task. In some ways, this approach is the precursor of the Montessori method. Book III The third book concerns the selection of a trade. Rousseau believed it necessary that the child must be taught a manual skill appropriate to his gender and age, and suitable to his inclinations, by worthy role models. Book IV Frontispiece to Rousseau's √âmile by De Launay for the 1782 edition. The original caption reads: \\"L'√©ducation de l'homme commence √† sa naissance\\" (\\"A man's education begins at birth\\").Trouille, 16. Once Emile is physically strong and learns to carefully observe the world around him, he is ready for the last part of his education‚Äîsentiment: \\"We have made an active and thinking being. It remains for us, in order to complete the man, only to make a loving and feeling being‚Äîthat is to say, to perfect reason by sentiment\\".Rousseau, 203. Emile is a teenager at this point and it is only now that Rousseau believes he is capable of understanding complex human emotions, particularly sympathy. Rousseau argues that the child cannot put himself in the place of others but once adolescence has been reached and he is able do so, Emile can finally be brought into the world and socialized.Rousseau, 222. In addition to introducing a newly passionate Emile to society during his adolescent years, the tutor also introduces him to religion. According to Rousseau, children cannot understand abstract concepts such as the soul before the age of about fifteen or sixteen, so to introduce religion to them is dangerous. He writes: \\"It is a lesser evil to be unaware of the divinity than to offend it\\".Rousseau, 259. Moreover, because children are incapable of understanding the difficult concepts that are part of religion, he points out that children will only recite what is told to them‚Äîthey are unable to believe. Book IV also contains the famous \\"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\\", the section that was largely responsible for the condemnation of Emile and the one most frequently excerpted and published independently of its parent tome. Rousseau writes at the end of the \\"Profession\\": \\"I have transcribed this writing not as a rule for the sentiments that one ought to follow in religious matters, but as an example of the way one can reason with one‚Äôs pupil in order not to diverge from the method I have tried to establish\\".Rousseau, 313. Rousseau, through the priest, leads his readers through an argument which concludes only to belief in \\"natural religion\\": \\"If he must have another religion\\", Rousseau writes (that is, beyond a basic \\"natural religion\\"), \\"I no longer have the right to be his guide in that\\".Rousseau, 314. Title page from a German edition of √âmile Book V In Book V, Rousseau turns to the education of Sophie, Emile's wife-to-be. This brief description of female education sparked an immense contemporary response, perhaps even more so than Emile itself. Mary Wollstonecraft, for example, dedicated a substantial portion of her chapter \\"Animadversions on Some of the Writers who have Rendered Women Objects of Pity, Bordering on Contempt\\" in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792) to attacking Rousseau and his arguments. When responding to Rousseau's argument in A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, Wollstonecraft directly quotes Emile in Chapter IV of her piece: > Educate women like men,' says Rousseau [in Emile], 'and the more they > resemble our sex the less power will they have over us.' This is the very > point I aim at. I do not wish them to have power over men; but over > themselves. French writer Louise d'√âpinay's Conversations d'Emilie made her disagreement with Rousseau's take on female education clear as well. She believes that females' education affects their role in society, not natural differences as Rousseau argues. Rousseau begins his description of Sophie, the ideal woman, by describing the inherent differences between men and women in a famous passage: > In what they have in common, they are equal. Where they differ, they are not > comparable. A perfect woman and a perfect man ought not to resemble each > other in mind any more than in looks, and perfection is not susceptible of > more or less. In the union of the sexes each contributes equally to the > common aim, but not in the same way. From this diversity arises the first > assignable difference in the moral relations of the two sexes. For Rousseau, \\"everything man and woman have in common belongs to the species, and ... everything which distinguishes them belongs to the sex\\".Rousseau, 358. Rousseau states that women should be \\"passive and weak\\", \\"put up little resistance\\" and are \\"made specially to please man\\"; he adds, however, that \\"man ought to please her in turn\\", and he explains the dominance of man as a function of \\"the sole fact of his strength\\", that is, as a strictly \\"natural\\" law, prior to the introduction of \\"the law of love\\". Rousseau also touches on the political upbringing of Emile in book V by including a concise version of his Social Contract in the book. His political treatise The Social Contract was published in the same year as Emile and was likewise soon banned by the government for its controversial theories on general will. The version of this work in Emile, however, does not go into detail concerning the tension between the Sovereign and the Executive, but instead refer the reader to the original work.Patrick J. Deneen, The Odyssey of Political Theory, p. 145. Google Books Rousseau's stance on female education, much like the other ideas explored in Emile, \\"crystallize existing feelings\\" of the time. During the eighteenth century, women's education was traditionally focused on domestic skills‚Äîincluding sewing, housekeeping, and cooking‚Äîas they were encouraged to stay within their suitable spheres, which Rousseau advocates.  √âmile et Sophie  In the incomplete sequel to Emile, √âmile et Sophie (English: Emilius and Sophia), published after Rousseau's death, Sophie is unfaithful (in what is hinted at might be a drugged rape), and Emile, initially furious with her betrayal, remarks \\"the adulteries of the women of the world are not more than gallantries; but Sophia an adulteress is the most odious of all monsters; the distance between what she was, and what she is, is immense. No! there is no disgrace, no crime equal to hers\\".Rousseau, Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Emilius and Sophia; or, The Solitaries. London: Printed by H. Baldwin. (1783), 31. He later relents somewhat, blaming himself for taking her to a city full of temptation, but he still abandons her and their children. Throughout the agonized internal monologue, represented through letters to his old tutor, he repeatedly comments on all of the affective ties that he has formed in his domestic life‚Äî\\"the chains [his heart] forged for itself\\".Rousseau, √âmile et Sophie, 46. As he begins to recover from the shock, the reader is led to believe that these \\"chains\\" are not worth the price of possible pain‚Äî\\"By renouncing my attachments to a single spot, I extended them to the whole earth, and, while I ceased to be a citizen, became truly a man\\".Rousseau, √âmile et Sophie, 58. While in La Nouvelle H√©lo√Øse the ideal is domestic, rural happiness (if not bliss), in Emile and its sequel the ideal is \\"emotional self-sufficiency which was the natural state of primitive, pre-social man, but which for modern man can be attained only by the suppression of his natural inclinations\\".Jimack, 37. According to Dr. Wilson Paiva, member of the Rousseau Association, \\"[L]eft unfinished, √âmile et Sophie reminds us of Rousseau's incomparable talent for producing a brilliant conjugation of literature and philosophy, as well as a productive approach of sentiment and reason through education\\". Reviews Rousseau's contemporary and philosophical rival Voltaire was critical of Emile as a whole, but admired the section in the book which had led to it being banned (the section titled \\"Profession of Faith of the Savoyard Vicar\\"). According to Voltaire, Emile is However, Voltaire went on to endorse the Profession of Faith section and called it \\"fifty good pages... it is regrettable that they should have been written by... such a knave\\". The German scholar Goethe wrote in 1787 that \\"Emile and its sentiments had a universal influence on the cultivated mind\\".

He was picked to play against New Zealand in July 1949, when he was 18 years old. Close went on to play 22 Test matches for England, captaining them seven times to six wins and one drawn test. Close also captained Yorkshire to four county championship titles ‚Äì the main domestic trophy in English cricket. He later went on to captain Somerset, where he is widely credited with developing the county into a hard-playing team, and helping to mould Viv Richards and Ian Botham into the successful players they became. Throughout his cricket career, which lasted from 1948 until the 1977 season, Close was one of the most charismatic and well-known cricketers. He scored almost 35,000 runs as a batsman, including 52 centuries with a highest innings score of 198. He also took 1,168 wickets as a bowler, over 800 catches as a fielder and one stumping, as a stand-in wicket-keeper. At just over six feet (1.83 m) tall he was a noticeable presence on the field, often fielding at the short leg position, close to the batsman. As cricketers did not use head or body protection in Close's day, he would often get hurt when a batsman struck a ball that hit him. Close was also noted, as a batsman, for standing up to intimidatory bowling, letting the ball hit his unprotected torso rather than flinching. Close was known as a cricketing gambler; he was prepared to take risks and to court controversy throughout his career. He was serving a \\"confined to barracks\\" punishment during his military service when selected for his first international cricket tour to Australia in 1950, was sacked as England captain for timewasting, and later sacked by Yorkshire for his lukewarm attitude to one-day cricket. He was also accused of not giving enough support to younger Yorkshire cricketers. He attracted further criticism by touring apartheid South Africa and white-minority-controlled Rhodesia with private teams. As chairman of Yorkshire's cricket subcommittee he had many run-ins with the then Yorkshire captain, Geoffrey Boycott. However, he continued to serve Yorkshire cricket, and in his seventies was coaching and occasionally captaining the county's Colts XI. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9. Early years Close was born into a working class family in Rawdon, West Riding of Yorkshire, around west of Leeds, on 24 February 1931. His parents were Harry, a weaver, and Esther (n√©e Barrett). He was the second eldest of five boys and a girl. The family lived in a series of small council houses in Rawdon, Guiseley and Yeadon. Growing up, Close practised cricket with his father in the houses' back gardens; Harry Close was himself a keen cricketer, who kept wicket and was a big hitter in the Bradford Cricket League, although he never attained the standard of the Yorkshire county team. Rawdon had cricketing pedigree: Hedley Verity‚Äîan England international in the period before the Second World War‚Äîgrew up there, and the Verity family continued to live in the village. At Rawdon Littlemoor Primary School, Close was taught by Grace Verity, Hedley's sister, and he was friends with two of his children, Wilfred and Douglas. At Aireborough Grammar School, Close excelled both academically and athletically. The school went unbeaten in the six cricketing summers while Close was there, and the school's sport's master arranged for him to receive coaching from George Hirst, a former England international who coached Yorkshire. Close dominated junior level cricket in the area; he joined Rawdon Cricket Club in 1942, when he was eleven years of age, and was almost immediately selected to play for both the under-18 side and the second team. Close was also proficient at football, and at the age of fourteen, he was signed as an amateur by Leeds United. A natural inside forward, he became the first Leeds player to feature as a youth international, when in October 1948 he played with England against Scotland at Pittodrie Park in Aberdeen. After passing his Higher School Certificate, Close seriously considered becoming a doctor; his headmaster at Aireborough believed that he could have been accepted into Cambridge or Oxford university, but he was not allowed to start university until he had completed two years of national service with the military. With the enforced break from his studies he chose to try a career as a professional sportsman; he signed a professional contract with Leeds United and having already played for the Yorkshire Colts in second eleven cricket, he joined them for winter coaching. The coaches encouraged Close to switch from bowling seam to being an off spinner. Yorkshire and England=Debut season In February 1949, Close underwent a medical examination with the British Army, but due to an injury he had suffered playing football his call-up was delayed by a few months, allowing him to continue into pre-season training with Yorkshire. His performance in pre- season was such that he was given a trial for the county in the two first- class matches against Cambridge and Oxford Universities. He made his debut on 11 May 1949, alongside Fred Trueman and Frank Lowson ‚Äì all three went on to play for England. Close impressed the Yorkshire hierarchy enough for his trial to be extended into the County Championship season; Bill Bowes, one of Yorkshire's coaches, declared that he was the \\"natural successor to the veteran all-rounder Frank Smailes\\". Close continued to perform well, particularly his bowling; in his fifth first-class game, against Essex, Close took five for 58 in Essex's first innings, then top-scored with an undefeated 88 runs in the Yorkshire innings. His performances for Yorkshire earned him a place in the North v South match, which was also being used as a trial for selection for the upcoming Test matches against New Zealand. Close scored two runs, and did not take a wicket; The Times described his batting as a \\"disappointing feature\\" of the match, but noted that despite not taking any wickets, \\"he bowled his off-breaks round the wicket well enough.\\" Close continued to do well for Yorkshire and was selected to play for the Players against the Gentlemen, at Lord's in July. Unofficially, this prestigious match also served as a Test match trial, and Close scored 65 runs, the most amongst the Players, in what was described as a \\"most commendable performance\\" by The Times. During the match, Close got caught out by cricket's antiquated social etiquette. When he reached his half-century he was congratulated by the Gentlemen's wicket-keeper, Billy Griffith, who said: \\"Well played, Brian\\", to which Close responded: \\"Thank you, Billy\\". Ten days later, he was called to see Brian Sellers, a member of the Yorkshire committee, who reprimanded Close for his effrontery in not addressing an amateur player as \\"Mister\\". Despite this rebuke, the Yorkshire committee secured the assistance of the Member of Parliament for Bradford Central, Maurice Webb, who successfully requested that Close be allowed to complete the 1949 season for Yorkshire, before commencing his National Service. Close was then selected to play for England in the third Test match at Old Trafford against the touring New Zealanders; a decision praised by The Times, who described him as \\"a young all-round cricketer of such promise as to demand immediate encouragement.\\" In the match, Close became, and to date remains, England's youngest-ever Test player, aged 18 years and 149 days. He came in to bat when England needed quick runs, his instruction from Freddie Brown, the captain, being to \\"have a look at a couple and then give it a go\\". Close duly played two balls back to the bowler, then hit out for the boundary, only to be caught in the outfield for a score of nought. He had previously taken one wicket for 39 runs during the first New Zealand innings. In his autobiography, I Don't Bruise Easily, his early Test call-up is described \\"an albatross round [his] neck\\", but Close later attributed this phrase to the book's shadow writer, Don Mosey. During the late-season Scarborough Festival, he became the youngest player to achieve the double, of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in a single first-class season. Tour to Australia in 1950 Brian Close (pictured middle row, third from the right) with the England team which toured Australia in Close began his National Service on 6 October 1949, in the Royal Corps of Signals at Catterick Army Training Depot. Another football injury, picked up during training, meant that he spent his first month of military service excused from duties. Once he was fit again, he was given weekend passes from the army to play football for Leeds. During one of these games he was badly injured again: playing against Newcastle United he hurt his thigh in a collision with Ted Robledo. Showing the stubbornness that he later became famous for, Close played the rest of the game, but by the time he reported back for duty the next day, it was badly swollen and painful. He was excused from duties again, but not offered any treatment by the army. After around six weeks, he travelled home on leave and got some heat treatment from the Leeds United physiotherapist, but there was little progress until just before Christmas, when another examination by the army revealed ossification of the thigh. Two months of treatment and bed rest followed, which Close thinks saved his career, he said that otherwise: \\"the injury would have finished me. I would never had bent my leg again.\\" Close returned to fitness in time for the 1950 English cricket season, though little of it was first-class: he appeared for Yorkshire once, and made three first- class appearances for the Combined Services cricket team. He was playing plenty of other cricket; he played in inter-services matches during the week, and obtained weekend passes to play league cricket for Leeds on Saturdays and charity matches on Sundays. Between playing football and cricket, he had little time for anything else, so much so according to Close, he was never given a job in the army, as he would have no time in which to do it. His performances attracted the attention of the England cricket captain, Brown, who wanted Close to be included in the English party to tour Australia for the 1950‚Äì51 Ashes series. Brown consulted Close's county coach, former England bowler Bill Bowes, who pleaded with Brown not to select Close, arguing that such early promotion would damage him as a player. Brown ignored Bowes and selected Close. Close's call-up to the Australian touring party attracted considerable press interest, and a press conference was called at Catterick to give the press a chance to question him. However, his moment of glory also gave rise to controversy, when one pressman found out that Close was \\"confined to barracks\\" for disciplinary reasons at the time his call-up was announced: he had absented himself from an army cricket match. The pressman promised to stay silent, but a week later a clerk on the camp newspaper telephoned the Daily Express with the news. However, Close still toured; his National Service was suspended so that he could do so, as touring sportsmen were considered to be ambassadors for the United Kingdom. Close was the youngest player on the tour, and had little in common with the rest of the party; by the end he was not even on talking terms with most of them. After a reasonable start, making a century on his First Class debut in Australia, Close faltered, and then became injured, with a badly pulled groin muscle. He was selected to play in the second Test, which England lost by 28 runs. After Australia were dismissed for 194, England had collapsed to 54 for 4 when Close came in to bat, with only eight deliveries to go before the lunch interval on the second day. Misjudging the bounce on the Melbourne wicket, which was somewhat different from the bounce of English wickets, he swept a ball from Jack Iverson only to get a top edge to Sam Loxton, fielding behind square leg. E. W. Swanton called it the worst shot he had seen played by a first-class batsman.Swanton, E.W. (1975) Swanton in Australia with MCC 1946‚Äì1975. Fontana/Collins. p. 80. . The dressing room was silent when he returned. Brown, when advised that Close was a bit down and needed consolation, replied \\"Let the blighter stew. He deserves it.\\" Later in Tasmania, Close was ordered to play despite doctor's advice to rest, and as he tried to nurse his injury he acquired a reputation for malingering and insubordination. He was made to play in six of the next seven games. When England won a Test match in Australia for the first time in 13 years in the final Test, Close was not present. Nowadays, someone in Close's position would be carefully man-managed, and looked after by captain and team manager. But times were different then, and the Yorkshire stalwarts were proved right: he had been picked too early, and would never be a regular Test player. Consolidation, 1951 to 1958 The years between 1951 and 1958 were a period of career consolidation for Close, who achieved 1,000 runs in a season five times. Immediately after the tour to Australia Close had a good season in 1951, playing for the Combined Services, including a century against the touring South Africans. At the end of his National Service in October 1951, he signed for Arsenal, and tried briefly to combine playing football with his cricket for Yorkshire. This proved impossible; although Close received permission from Yorkshire captain Norman Yardley to leave the first match of the 1952 cricket season early, to play football for Arsenal, this leave was rescinded by the match manager. Close arrived late at Arsenal and was sacked. Close enjoyed a good 1952 season at Yorkshire, achieving another double, but played no Test cricket. He played football, for Bradford City this time, and in doing so picked up a serious knee injury which ended his professional footballing career. It also threatened to end his cricket career‚ÄîClose played only two first-class matches in the 1953 cricket season. In 1954 Close scored his first first-class century for Yorkshire, an undefeated 123 against the touring Pakistanis. In 1955 he scored his first county championship century. In that year he played one Test match against South Africa, and at the end of the season was only 3 wickets short of another 1,000 runs/100 wickets double. He was in the selectors' sights again, and was picked for the tour to Pakistan in 1955/56. This was not a full England tour, and no Test matches were played. Close returned to the full England side in 1957, playing in the first two Tests against the West Indies, but did not perform well enough to secure a regular Test place. Meanwhile, in this period, Yorkshire had not won a single County Championship. At the beginning of 1958 a new captain, Ronnie Burnet, was appointed. Burnet was 40 years old, without first-class cricket experience, and seemed an unlikely choice to restore to Yorkshire's fortunes. It was believed by the Yorkshire committee that Burnet would inject some discipline into the Yorkshire team, but initially the appointment caused problems. Several senior players left the club; Johnny Wardle, Yorkshire's top bowler and Close's preferred choice of captain, was sacked for disciplinary reasons. Yorkshire as county champions Burnet, aided by Close, was successful in 1959, when Yorkshire at last won the county championship. At the end of that season, as Close later heard, Burnet was told that, having just won the championship, he could have another season as captain, but, if he did, Close would then take over. If Burnet resigned immediately, Vic Wilson could take over as captain in preference to Close. Burnet chose to step down straight-away. Once Wilson took over, with Close as the senior professional Yorkshire enjoyed a period of almost unbroken success, winning the county championship again in 1960, taking second place in 1961, and winning again in 1962. More controversy During this period Close was called up for his seventh Test in 1961, against Australia. This match, which at one point England appeared certain to win, turned to disaster, with Close bearing the main blame for England's defeat. England were chasing a total of 256 runs to win the match, with just under four hours left to play. Scoring rapidly, they reached 150 for 1 wicket. Then Ted Dexter and Peter May got out in quick succession to Benaud, who was pitching his leg breaks into the rough outside the right-handers' leg stump. This brought Close to the crease. May, the captain, was instructing his players to go for the runs and secure the victory. Close accordingly took a calculated risk, and chose to hit out. He took one six off Benaud, but to the tenth ball he faced he played another unorthodox shot which Norman O'Neill caught above his head with two hands. Purists were outraged, and as England collapsed to 201 all out and a 54 run defeat, Close took most of the blame, with some commentators saying that he should never play for England again. Captaincy=Yorkshire captaincy At the end of 1962, Wilson retired, and the Yorkshire committee appointed Close captain. According to Bowes: \\"almost overnight it seemed that Brian Close matured\\". He wrote, \\"Close's field placings were as intelligent and antagonistic as any seen in the county for 25 years\\". Close's attitude, in his own words, was that \\"I've always believed that the team is more important than the individual\\", and that credo stood Yorkshire in good stead. Ray Illingworth noted that when he left Yorkshire to play for Leicestershire, the players there were surprised that, while Yorkshire were perennial Championship winners, the batting averages of their leading batsmen tended to languish in the 20s. The answer was that Close had honed them to play the innings required at the right time: when quick runs were required, players did not play for their averages, they played for quick runs. Close was recalled to the England Test squad in 1963, and played his first full series of five matches, against the West Indies. His innings in the second Test at Lord's remains his best known. When England were pressing for a last-day victory, Close took the battle to the fastest West Indian fast bowlers, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith, daring to advance down the wicket to them. This was before body protection and helmets were in use, and time and again the ball struck Close firmly on his body. But he persevered. With no other England player but Ken Barrington scoring above 20, Close's innings of 70 saved the game for England, and came near to winning it. Set 234 to win, England ended on 228 for 9, with Colin Cowdrey famously coming in to bat (for two balls at the non-striker's end) with his broken arm in plaster. Close had been dismissed going for runs to win the game, and his courage earned him many plaudits. His shirtless torso, black and blue with bruises where he had been hit, made the front pages of the newspapers the next day. Len Hutton wrote him a congratulatory letter on his innings, and he returned to county cricket the hero. Overall, he made over 300 runs in the series, but was not selected for the next series. Close also had immediate success as Yorkshire captain, winning the County Championship in 1963. His successes saw him named as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1964, acknowledging his impact on the 1963 season. Close went on to captain Yorkshire to the county championship in 1966, 1967 and 1968. He first met his wife Vivien, an air stewardess with BOAC, in Bermuda whilst touring there with Yorkshire in 1964, when she was engaged to someone else. He pursued her relentlessly, even though initially she considered him not to be her type. Brian gambled with his love life too: on New Year's Day 1965 he told her that if she didn't agree to marry him, he would never see her again. They married the following March. They went on to have one daughter, Lynn, and a son, Lance. England captaincy After the fourth Test of their five-Test series against the West Indies in 1966, England were 3‚Äì0 down and had lost the series. Needing someone to come in to revitalise the squad, the England selectors turned to the successful Yorkshire captain, Brian Close. Close knew why he had been selected, and also why many of his men had been. At the pre- match dinner he said, \\"I shouldn't be here if we hadn't made such a mess of the series. What's more, neither would a few of you. You are here because you are all fighters, and we are going to keep the pressure on and keep it on for five days.\\" What Close did was to engender a battling spirit for the final Test Match. So, when England were 166 for 7 in reply to the West Indies' 268 all out, they did not give up. Instead, centuries from Tom Graveney and John Murray, and half-centuries from Ken Higgs and John Snow, saw England to a score of 527. The highlight of the match was when West Indian captain Gary Sobers, who had a batting average in the series of well over 100, came in to bat at 137 for 5 with his side still 122 runs from making England bat again. Close knew that Sobers was a fine hooker, and he knew how he wanted to approach him, so he asked Snow to bowl a bouncer first up. Everything went to plan: Sobers hooked, edged the ball into his body, and it rebounded to Close at his customary short leg position, close to the batsman, ready to take the catch ‚Äì or a full blow to the body had Sobers middled it. Sobers c. Close, b. Snow 0 off one ball. England went on to win the game by an innings and 34 runs. There was no overseas tour in 1966/67, so the next game Close captained was the first Test at Headingley against India in 1967. Of the 16 Tests India had previously played in England, England had won 12 and drawn 4, and there were no expectations that there would be anything other than an England victory in the three-match series. But they still needed to be beaten, and England, under Close, won each game convincingly. Pakistan toured England in the second half of the summer of 1967. The first match of that three-Test series was a rain-affected draw. The second Test was won comfortably by England by 10 wickets. It seemed certain that Close would be selected to captain England in their 1967/68 tour to the West Indies. Then on 16, 17 and 18 August, Yorkshire, captained by Close, played Warwickshire at Edgbaston, Birmingham. Warwickshire had been set 142 to win in 100 minutes. When the match ended, Warwickshire were 133 for 5, nine runs short of victory, and the match was drawn. However, Yorkshire managed to bowl only 24 overs, with only two being bowled in the last 15 minutes. Whilst it was wet, and Yorkshire had to dry the ball often, this was seen as unacceptable time-wasting and gamesmanship. Close did not help himself as he personally berated a Warwickshire spectator who he thought had called out something inopportune, though in the event he picked on the wrong man. After the game, Close said to the Warwickshire captain, M.J.K. Smith, \\"Bad luck, Mike, you played better than we did. But I couldn't give you the game.\\" Smith appeared to accept this when he replied, \\"I quite understand.\\" Brian Sellers, chairman of Yorkshire and the one who had berated Close in 1949 for saying \\"Thank you, Billy\\", then made matters worse for Close by sending an apology to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). In 1967 England touring sides were still MCC sides rather than \\"England\\" sides, and the MCC took the opportunity to overrule the selectors who picked Close as captain. Close, whose \\"temperament had been shown lacking\\", did not go to the West Indies. On the Wednesday before the third and final Test against Pakistan, he was told he had been stripped of the captaincy; the replacement captain was Colin Cowdrey. The third Test against Pakistan was Close's final Test as captain. He led England to a comprehensive 8-wicket victory, winning the series 2‚Äì0. His record as captain was played 7, won 6, drawn 1, the best record of any Englishman who captained in more than two Tests. Last years at Yorkshire In 1969 Close played only 18 county championship games as he was plagued by a calf injury, although he did lead Yorkshire to victory in the one-day Gillette Cup for a second time, the first time being in 1965. A shoulder injury saw Close miss much of the 1970 season, and Yorkshire fell down the championship table, but once Close was fit again, they had an extraordinary run and finished fourth. Close, however, always opposed one-day cricket, believing that it lessens players' abilities. Mike Procter notes that when Gloucestershire played Yorkshire in the John Player 40-over League in 1970, with Yorkshire three wickets down and needing six an over, word came from Close in the dressing room: \\"No chance of winning this one, lads ‚Äî just get some batting practice.\\" Yorkshire had a policy of not offering contracts to its players, but in return they would tell cricketers by the end of July if they did not require their services the next summer. When July 1970 came and went, Close must have thought he was safe. However, Close offended the Lancashire president, the Honourable Lionel Lister, when Lister entered the away captain's changing room to speak to Close after Lancashire, Yorkshire's archrivals, had beaten them at Old Trafford to retain the one-day John Player League trophy. Close, who may not have known who Lister was, offered Lister some choice words. Lister immediately told Brian Sellers, the chairman of the Yorkshire cricket committee, of the insult. Close wrote a letter to Lister apologising, and gave a copy to a Yorkshire committeeman. But the letter was never presented to the committee as a whole, which voted to sack him as the first agenda item at their next meeting. In November 1970 Close was summoned to see Sellers, and given the choice of either resigning or being sacked. To begin with, he chose to resign. Later that day, and after speaking to his legal adviser, he retracted this, leaving Yorkshire to sack him. The reason, according to Yorkshire, was Close's dislike for the new 40-over one-day cricket league that was first played in 1969 (Close thought it led to bad habits and negative play), and because Close had supposedly not brought on the younger players. Later life and career=Somerset After being sacked by Yorkshire, the 39-year-old Close received offers from many other counties, including Lancashire, Glamorgan, Middlesex and Leicestershire. But he turned all these down, preferring to accept a non-captain's role at Somerset. The rest from the captaincy did Close good; he went through the 1971 season without injury, and scored 1,389 runs, including a century in his first game for Somerset, and a century in the game against Yorkshire. In 1972, he was awarded the CBE by the Queen for his services to cricket. Close was also promoted to Somerset captain. He soon gained the same respect and commitment from his players as he had at Yorkshire. He was also called up to the England one-day squad to captain them in a three-match One Day International series against Australia, which England won 2‚Äì1, when the regular England captain and his former Yorkshire teammate, Ray Illingworth, injured his ankle in the last Test. In 1972/73 Close led a two-match tour of the \\"International Wanderers\\" to Rhodesia. The next two winters he captained the Derrick Robins' XI tours to apartheid South Africa. Robins' tours were the closest thing South Africa had to Test match cricket at that time, and for his efforts in the first of the tours to South Africa, Close was named as one of the four South African Cricket Annual Cricketers of the Year in 1974. During his time at Somerset Viv Richards and Ian Botham joined the county squad, and Close's leadership and discipline helped them become great cricketers. Botham said of Close, \\"There was a genuine enthusiasm for cricket which rubbed off on all those playing alongside him. You couldn't help but get excited by the game.\\" Final Test innings In 1976, the 45-year-old Brian Close was called up for the first three Tests in England's five-Test series against the West Indies, who were no less ferocious than when Close was battered by them in 1963. In the second innings of the third Test at Old Trafford, Close's final Test innings, Close opened with the 39-year-old John Edrich. Michael Holding, Andy Roberts and Wayne Daniel, a trio of fast bowlers, pounded them for two and a half hours. It was one of the most brutal displays of fast bowling ever seen. Wisden said, \\"Close and Edrich defended their wickets and themselves against fast bowling, which was frequently too wild and hostile to be acceptable\\". Close himself said, \\"It must have been the worst wicket I experienced in Test cricket. The faster the West Indians bowled the worse it got because the balls broke through the surface of the wicket. They exploded and flew at you.\\" With this innings of 20 runs off 108 balls in 162 minutes Close completed his Test career, under a vicious barrage, standing tall and taking the damage as he had against the West Indies at Lord's 13 years earlier. After that, both Close and Edrich were dropped for the fourth Test. The interval between Close's first and last Test matches was 27 years, the second-longest after Wilfred Rhodes. Only one man, Zimbabwean John Traicos, has since played a Test match at a greater age. End of first-class career Brian Close presenting an award for Yorkshire in 2008. By the time he retired from county cricket at the end of the 1977 season, Close had achieved folk hero status in Somerset. He went on to play for Todmorden in the Lancashire League. Close also had a stint as an England selector between 1979 and 1981 and in 1984 he was elected to the Yorkshire committee. He became chairman of the cricket sub-committee, which led him into more controversy and conflict with the captain, Geoffrey Boycott. He was President of Yorkshire in 2008/9. After his retirement from Somerset, Close continued to play at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the wicket-keeper and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they would have let him stay, but Close would have none of it ‚Äì he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: \\"It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up.\\" Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches. Close continued to turn out to help train Yorkshire youngsters, appearing for Yorkshire Colts XI in his seventies, sometimes captaining games and taking the short leg position without a helmet, a position he had taken so many times in the past. According to Imran Khan, Close once stood his ground when fielding at short leg when a batsman played a pull shot, the ball hit him on the forehead, rebounded and was caught at cover. Khan commented: \\"We are not all bullet-headed Yorkshiremen, however, and I don't recommend copying Close.\\"Imran Khan's Cricket Skills, Publisher: Golden Books Publishing Company, Inc. (12 May 1989) Close died of lung cancer on 13 September 2015, aged 84.

It was built in 1854 to enable prisoners to work at Dry Creek, quarrying rock for roads and construction. Originally known as The Stockade of Dry Creek or just The Stockade, it acquired its current name from a local Kaurna word relating to inundation by water, which was used for the Hundred of Yatala. The prison has been expanded many times but still has functioning buildings that date to the 1850s. It remains Adelaide's main male prison and although it was scheduled to be closed by 2011, it has remained open due to the Global Financial Crisis leading to a lack of funding for a replacement prison. Geography and naming Yatala prison, originally called \\"The Stockade\\" or \\"The Stockade of Dry Creek\\" when established in 1854, was named after the cadastral Hundred of Yatala. The word is presumed to refer to the flooded state of the plain either side of Dry Creek after heavy rain, the Kaurna name referring to water or inundation. The prison was renamed Yatala Labour Prison sometime before 1860.Chapter 12 'Weeding Out Spurious Etymologies: Toponyms On The Adelaide Plains' (Rob Amery) in: It is known as a labour prison by virtue of its vast industries complex and the use of convict labour in construction. It is sited in Adelaide's northern suburb of Northfield, north of Adelaide's central business district and between Grand Junction Road and Dry Creek. The prison sits on an escarpment of the Para Fault Block overlooking the Adelaide plains.Department of Mines.Geology and Underground Water Resources of the Adelaide Plains Area Adelaide: Geological Survey of South Australia. Bulletin No. 27, 1952 (As cited in Settlers on the Hill, City of Salisbury Publication, 1985) Dry Creek, a watercourse usually dry in summer, flows through a deep gully immediately north of the prison boundary. It features outcrops of exposed pre-Cambrian rocks that were once extensively quarried as part of prison activity. History For the first five years of South Australian settlement there was no permanent prison. Prisoners were kept locked in irons on board until its sailing in 1837, and in temporary jails subsequently.Lewis, H. (1985), p. 170. 1841 saw the first permanent prison built in Adelaide, with the Adelaide Gaol on the banks of the River Torrens, the building of which severely strained the new colony's finances. In the 19th century, incarceration in South Australia was seen as a punitive more than preventative measure. The labour of prisoners was used for public works and hard labour seen as an integral part of imprisonment. In this light, Charles Simeon Hare (member of the legislative council) wrote an 1853 letter to the Adelaide Observer, advocating prisoners be usefully employed, and further that a reserve beside Dry Creek could be used for this purpose. The reserve had an abundant supply of stone that prisoners could convert into building and road material.Lewis, H. (1985), pp. 174‚Äì5 September that year saw Hare move, in the council, that ¬£5,000 be set aside to enable a prison be constructed next to a quarry, whether at Dry Creek or elsewhere. This would enable the labour of the prisoners to remunerate the country. Hare later became superintendent of the prison and maintained a colourful register describing prisoners.  19th century  Twenty five prisoners were sent to the Dry Creek site to work in the quarries in July 1854, living at night in an iron house. Dry Creek prison was officially declared a gaol on 10 August 1854 and an act then passed commuting sentences, formerly of transportation to New South Wales or Van Diemen's Land, into imprisonment with hard labour, though transport to the latter had been stopped by the Imperial Government in 1852. The Prison began as an iron house with surrounding palisade and became known as The Stockade, a name retained in 2007 by the adjacent Stockade Botanical Park. Hare requested construction of a stone building, and by October 1854 this was completed using locally quarried bluestone, with accommodation for 60 prisoners.Lewis, H. (1985), p. 175. Yatala's powder magazine, used in quarrying In its early years rock-cracking, hard labour and solitary confinement were the notable features of life at the prison. It was seen that hard worked prisoners would not wish to return to the prison, with solitary confinement giving them time to reflect on past misdeeds. From inception prisoners main task was the breaking of one cubic yard of rock per day. Until the middle of the 20th century the prisons department's philosophy remained punitive with much reliance on obedience to rules and regulations.Lewis, H. (1985), p.177 The first batch of 24 convicts was sent to the prison from Adelaide gaol on 9 February 1855 wearing the characteristic broad arrow pattern prison clothes of the time,The Observer, 10 February 1855, Adelaide, South Australia, p. 5. and the first escape from the prison took place October 1855 with 8 escapees. The prisoners were captured, chained in solitary confinement within the prison, then subsequently punished with 50 lashes for the escape and other disciplinary issues. For the prison, water supply was a constant issue, with carriage required from distant Port Adelaide. A well was bored in 1856 through of limestone but soon ran dry. For storage of rainwater, in 1860 a reservoir was constructed under the main courtyard. Water supplies continued to be inadequate until the 1878 construction of a pipeline to the Hope Valley Reservoir. A railway line and terminus, called the Stockade railway station, was opened on 1 June 1857 to service the facility and to aid with stone transportation. It remained in use until its closure and removal in 1961. The first significant expansion of the prison buildings occurred in 1858 with the construction of B Division. Built in the centre of the prison with 123 cells and, in the 19th century, designed to hold 300 prisoners. A new wing was added in 1872 with 36 cells, guard accommodation and a wall separating it from the rest of the prison, with 37 more cells added in 1878. By 1880 the accommodation was seen as insufficient for the 280 prisoners then held, with up to three per cell and eighteen per dormitory room. A T shaped building was constructed in 1884 with 96 cells over three floors, and the walled area expanded. The building included a chapel, offices and three dark underground cells used for solitary confinement. Known as A Division, it was built by prisoners at the jail as part of their enforced labour.Lewis, H. (1985), p. 176.  20th century  Prisoners moved from rock breaking to goods production with trades including boot making, tailoring, tin smithing, blacksmithing, carpentry and masonry. There was public opposition as the free labour of prisoners was seen as unfair competition against private industry, consequently Government departments used most products. During the 1960s small industries were established north of the prison walls with facilities for spray painting, sheet metalwork and brick making. A decision was made in 1968 to build a new industries complex. Construction was from 1977 to 1982, with the complex opening in November 1984. C Division was created in 1957, as a minimum-security building, outside the main prison walls with a dining room added in 1967. B Division was redesigned and reequipped in 1958. The special education section of the education department opened a school at the prison in 1976 and Technical and Further Education began participating in prisoner education at Yatala from 1979. Although a high security prison, there have been some significant prisoner escapes. Four prisoners escaped in 1930, and lead the police on a car chase with whom they were involved in a shootout. After escaping into school grounds they were recaptured, with two of the police injured. Six prisoners escaped from the jail in 1979 after an attempted mass break-out by thirty. A wall that was under repair and covered in scaffolding was used as part of the escape, but all six escapees were soon recaptured. There was poor morale amongst inmates in the 1980s leading to a major prison riot. Sixty prisoners went on a rampage on 22 March 1983, and lit fires, destroying the roof of A division. The government saw this as an opportunity to restructure Yatala, rather than simply repairing the damage, and on 21 December announced that A division would be demolished. The former Enfield Council strongly objected due to the building's historic value but demolition began on 6 February 1984.Lewis H. (1985), p. 180 Yatala Labour Prison today The prison holds high, medium and low security prisoners, and is South Australia's main induction and reception prison for male prisoners. It still retains industry facilities that are the largest in the South Australian prison system, and is run by the South Australian government's Department for Correctional Services. Some of the original buildings and parts of old equipment can still be seen from a creek level walking trail, between the prison and new suburb of Walkley Heights. These include guard towers, quarries, a blacksmith's shop and a gunpowder magazine The prison is divided into four units: * B-Division ‚Äì High and medium security mainstream prisoners, clothing colour dark green. * E-Division ‚Äì Protection Unit, clothing colour light blue. * F-Division ‚Äì Working division, which includes industries such as souwester, panda, assembly, laundry, joiners etc. This division has a clothing colour of dark blue. * G-Division ‚Äì The highest security section of the prison. Prisoners are under total separation. * E Unit 4 - It is a small unit accommodating 16 prisoners. * Holden Hill - Due to the critical bed-space crisis in South Australian prisons, Holden Hill became functional in 2016. It can accommodate 19 prisoners. Yatala is reported as having 603 prisoners in a facility designed for 341. The prison was planned to be closed when a new prison at Mobilong was completed, though some buildings will be retained for their historic values. It was expected that the closure will happen by 2011, and the land developed for residential housing but this has been cancelled. No current funding has been put in place for the new prison, therefore the land redevelopment will not occur as previously noted. A new roster was implemented on 2 July 2011 despite a widespread outcry and criticism by the staff. Stephen Mann was the previous General Manager of Yatala. He was succeeded by Brenton Williams and currently Tracy Watkins. Paul Laister is Peter Forrests successor of the PSA representative for Echo Division. The new gatehouse was opened in March, 2013 by David Brown, the Chief Executive of Department for Correctional Services. The reception area includes two state of the art turnstile machines, which can detect any concealed drugs and metal objects. It is also equipped with an X -ray scanning machine. After checking through the turnstiles, visitors and staff must go through an Iris scan and fingerprint detecting booths to gain entry into the prison.

He was suspended from the priesthood in 1995 after allegations of improper sexual conduct while he had been stationed at Mobile, Alabama. Ryan was suspended from his priestly duties. Until the spring of 2003, he was a library media specialist at Martin County High School in Stuart, Florida, where he was named Teacher of the Year in 2001. He took a medical leave of absence in the wake of news reports that he might have been involved in improper sexual activity during his time as an Air Force chaplain. He was diagnosed around this time with reportedly terminal liver cancer. Shortly afterwards, between May and October 2003, he forced a six-year-old boy to perform oral sex upon him at the boy's family home in Long Island. In his written confession, Ryan said he received inpatient treatment for paedophilia, depression and alcoholism at Saint Luke Institute, a psychiatric hospital in Silver Spring, Maryland in 2004. Ryan attempted to commit suicide in 2007 by slitting his own throat.

Many of the elements borrowed from these series for use in Kaldor City were originated by Chris Boucher, who wrote for Doctor Who and was script editor for all four seasons of Blake's 7. The series, produced by Magic Bullet Productions, was released on CD beginning in 2001. Within the stories, Kaldor City is a major humanoid city of the future \\"on a corrupt world governed by an all-powerful Company, where the rich scheme in mansions filled with robot slaves, the poor scrabble for survival in the Sewerpits, the Security forces are out of control and terrorism is a daily fact of life\\".About Kaldor City and Magic Bullet It was first mentioned in the 1977 Doctor Who serial The Robots of Death as the home base of a \\"storm mine\\" touring the desert searching for and mining precious minerals from within the sands, with the crew working on commission for the Company. Boucher reused Kaldor City in his 1999 novel Corpse Marker, part of the Doctor Who Past Doctor Adventures line. Background The society shown in The Robots of Death is one where higher class \\"founding families\\" (presumably a reference to the families that founded the colony planet) have hit financial difficulties and are forced to work with (and sometimes subordinate to) citizens who have achieved their power, influence and wealth through their own hard work and scheming. This has led to a certain amount of resentment between the new and old money, mirroring the decline in the financial power of the gentry in England. The society is also highly reliant on the use of robots at all levels, with three class of robot in use: Dum robots are for menial work, and are unable to speak; Voc robots are the next level up, and can speak, and have limited reasoning capabilities; Super-Voc robots are the most advanced, and can be used to monitor complex activities including the day-to-day activities of other, lower class robots. Each robot is given a designation based on its class (for example D-84 is a Dum class robot and SV-7 is a Super-Voc) and is programmed with a variant on Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics. The society is not entirely comfortable with the use of robots; the machines' humanoid design but complete lack of emotion and body language has given rise to a mental disorder termed Robo-phobia. This is shown as a paranoid delusion that robots are actually the living dead, intent on harming humans. The Robots of Death also shows that it is possible to reprogram robots so that they can break the restrictions on harming humans, as robotics genius Taren Capel has discovered in his attempts to free his robot \\"brothers\\" from their 'slavery'. Kaldor City is also the setting of the Past Doctor Adventure Corpse Marker, where we get to see the city and its ruling board of \\"Topmasters\\". At the time of Corpse Marker, the Board comprises twenty Topmasters from the founding families, and they are seen to be keen to keep anyone not from a founding family off the board. The novel also introduces the character of Carnell to Kaldor City, who is a psychostrategist on the run from a corrupt \\"Federation\\" and hiding out in the city whilst ingratiating himself with the board by helping them compose their strategies: Carnell is a character from one of Chris Boucher's Blake's 7 episodes, \\"Weapon\\", broadcast in 1979, and this novel is the first time that the fan-theory that Doctor Who and Blake's 7 take place in the same fictional universe has received any kind of semi-official recognition. This theory had its roots in a report that Blake's 7 creator Terry Nation wanted to introduce his Doctor Who monsters, the Daleks, into Blake's 7 but was prevented by the BBC. The novel also introduces the concept of the sewer-pits, the slums of Kaldor City where the underclass try to scrape their living. The slums are the breeding ground of a new breed of terrorist, the Tarenists, who have adapted the teachings of the late Taren Capel into an almost religious doctrine, preaching the downfall of the ruling class at the hands of the robots. By the end of the novel, Topmaster Uvanov (formerly commander of the storm mine in The Robots of Death, and not a member of a founding family) has secured his succession to Chairholder of the Company Board. Some of the plays in the series also feature the Fendahl: a race of creatures also created by Boucher in 1977, in the Doctor Who television serial Image of the Fendahl. Audio plays In 1999, Magic Bullet Productions approached Chris Boucher to discuss the possibility of creating a range of audio plays based on the characters and concepts from his previous work relating to Kaldor City. Boucher gave his permission, working closely with producer Alan Stevens in creating a vision consistent with all that had gone before whilst also creating a new and interesting ongoing story. Boucher also wrote the second of the releases, the play Death's Head.Chris Boucher Interview, Jez Strickley, Star One issue #3 (March 2011), pages 4-11 The True History of Magic Bullet: Interview with Alan Stevens, Chris Duecker, June 8, 2009 The plays feature a cast principally drawn from actors who had appeared on television in Doctor Who or Blake's Seven, headed by Paul Darrow, Scott Fredericks and Russell Hunter, with, amongst others, David Baillie, David Collings, Philip Madoc, Peter Miles and Gregory de Polnay. They feature sound design, effects and music by Alistair Lock, and are co-directed by both Stevens and Lock. The first three CDs make sense on their own, as standalone stories, but the final three form a serial, and should be listened to in order. From the early releases, it seemed that the series was telling a story of political intrigue and manipulation that was gearing towards the use of the robot workforce as a means of revolution, as shown previously in The Robots of Death and Corpse Marker. However, the fifth play, Checkmate by Alan Stevens, takes the theme of manipulation to a higher level, introducing the Fendahl from Boucher's Doctor Who serial Image of the Fendahl as the series's major villain, manipulating events in Kaldor City to ensure its own emergence. Once the Fendahl's involvement was made known, it was possible to return to the series's earlier instalments and see the emergence foreshadowed: for example, Uvanov is given a painting of a Fendahleen, and Carnell muses about the existence of an alien grand manipulator whose goals and methods would be unknowable.There Have Always Been Crossovers: Kaldor City Audios, Lynn Clark, Star One issue #3 (March 2011), pages 28-31 Occam's Razor Occam's Razor is the first play in the series, written by Alan Stevens and Jim Smith. It focuses on the arrival of a mysterious figure called Kaston Iago (named for the manipulative character from Shakespeare's Othello and the noted Shakespeare editor David Kastan, played by Paul Darrow) and his insinuation into the confidence of Chairholder Uvanov (played by Russell Hunter, reprising his role from The Robots of Death). Iago helps Uvanov solve a series of murders involving Company board members, and his success earns him a permanent position as Uvanov's new bodyguard. However, as the title hints, the simplest explanation is true: Iago has been committing the murders himself, and framing another board member, in order to gain Uvanov's trust.Occam's Razor Through the course of the play, Iago also meets Psychostrategist Carnell (Scott Fredericks, reprising his role from Blake's 7) and makes it clear that he knows what a psychostrategist is and knows about the Federation, with Carnell remarking that he must be the only other person on the planet with this information. Many fans of the series have taken this -- combined with similarities in Darrow's performance -- to mean that Kaston Iago is in fact Kerr Avon masquerading for his own reasons under an assumed name. Magic Bullet have neither confirmed nor denied this; and although other characters in the Kaldor City series (mainly those created by Chris Boucher) have been more explicitly linked to either Doctor Who or Blake's 7, because Boucher did not create Kerr Avon he has no ownership rights in the character. Death's Head Death's Head by Chris Boucher is the second play in the series, and features an investigation into the attempted murder of Chairholder Uvanov. The play sets up several ideas that are only resolved later in the series, such as the existence of Taren Capel's skull (although in this play, the skull is a fake) and several clashing schemes and plots that the Topmasters, Carnell and Iago are attempting to put into action. The play also introduces the character of Blayes, played by Tracy Russell, who features more prominently in the later plays.Death's Head Hidden Persuaders Hidden Persuaders by Jim Smith and Fiona Moore is the third play in the series, and follows the attempts of a terrorist group called \\"The Church of Taren Capel\\" to commit an act of terrorism to further their cause. The Church has been infiltrated by Blayes, who is working for Chairholder Uvanov, and Kaston Iago is dispatched in an attempt to save her. Iago has also begun acting on his own suspicions, and is attempting to move against Carnell. The title of the play is derived from The Hidden Persuaders by media theorist Vance Packard and is partially an attempt to introduce some of the themes of his work into the series. The play reintroduces the character of Poul/Paullus from The Robots of Death, again played by David Collings.Hidden Persuaders Taren Capel The fourth play in the series is Taren Capel by Alan Stevens, and focuses on Iago's attempt to get to the bottom of a scheme apparently instigated by Taren Capel before his death, and continued by the Church of Taren Capel. Iago discovers that Capel has already programmed several robots in Kaldor City to become killers, with only a trigger phrase -- specified in his diary -- required to activate them. The diary is also kept with Capel's genuine skull, recovered from the desert. The play closes with a grand piece of misdirection, with Iago managing to convince Uvanov of the danger but with the robots being triggered: this created expectations that the following plays would deal with a robot-destroyed city.Taren Capel Taren Capel also saw the apparent departure of Carnell, although the character may have returned in the following play: it is likely, however, that the Carnell in Checkmate was a projection of Iago's mind and/or the Fendahl, rather than the actual psychostrategist. Checkmate Checkmate by Alan Stevens continues directly after the events of Taren Capel, and whilst it ostensibly deals with Uvanov and Iago's struggle to contain the threat of the killer robots, it becomes clear as the play progresses that another plot is being hatched: the Church of Taren Capel seem more concerned with Capel's skull than with his diaries, and eventually the skull is used to bring forth the Fendahl (mirroring events in the television serial Image of the Fendahl). At the close of the play, Iago is shot and apparently dying, when the Fendahl (through Iago's paramour) offers him a deal. This seems to involve him going back in time and killing his lover, although this may have been an illusion created by the Fendahl for its own ends.Checkmate Following the release of this play, and the death of Russell Hunter, it was generally assumed that the Kaldor City audios had reached a natural end.The Pictures are Better on the Radio, Jules Jones, 3 May 2004 The Prisoner This was a 20 minute play featuring Paul Darrow and Peter Miles reprising roles they had played in the Kaldor City series, written by Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore for release on the CD The Actor Speaks: Paul Darrow, produced by MJTV. The play features an interrogation between Kaston Iago and Firstmaster Landerchild, whereby Iago attempts to convince his interrogator that they are both figments of something else's imagination. In fact, this is a technique that appears to work so well that by the end of the play, both characters seem to disappear.Kaldor City: The Prisoner The title refers to the writers' interest in the ATV series The Prisoner,Fall Out: The Unofficial and Unauthorised Guide to The Prisoner, Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore, Telos Press, 2007 and whilst it also suggests that (like that TV series) the main theme of the Kaldor City series may be the nature of reality and fiction, it also suggests (again, like the TV series) that definite answers may not be forthcoming. Storm Mine The final play in the series is Storm Mine by Daniel O'Mahony. It centres on the character of Blayes, who awakens on a storm mine going round in circles in the desert. She is joined by a series of strange characters, and the disembodied voice of Kaston Iago frustratedly trying to get her to act to his will. The story at first glance seems to bear no real connection to the series as a whole, although it is suggested that Kaldor City itself is quarantined due to the killer robots. However, there are several hints within the play that all is not as it seems -- for example, several of the characters bear similarities to characters from earlier plays, such as Philip Madoc's Commander sharing mannerisms with Russell Hunter's Uvanov, himself once a storm mine Commander. The Fendahl also appears in the play, apparently manipulating the crew and one of its robots for its own ends, and it has been suggested that in fact the play is demonstrating what it feels like for the characters to be assimilated into the Fendahl's gestalt entity.Storm Mine When questioned on the play's apparent lack of connection to the previous instalments, producer and writer Alan Stevens often directs listeners to the analysis of the play by author Dale Smith, posted to Outpost Gallifrey's forums.Welcome to Kaldor City, Population 1, Dale Smith Metafiction On 26 March 2011, a 15-minute Kaldor City play written by Alan Stevens and Fiona Moore was performed by Paul Darrow and Patricia Merrick at the Sci-Fi-London film festival.Sci-Fi London News: Festival Day Three This play was subsequently recorded under the title Metafiction and released in 2012 as a direct download.Metafiction The play takes the form of a dialogue between Kaston Iago and Justina, who is interviewing him about his background on the orders of Uvanov. The title of the story, meaning a fiction in which the author self-consciously alludes to the story's artificially, recalls once more the idea, as first alluded to back in Occam's Razor, that Iago might in fact be Kerr Avon from Blake's 7, and as such the story plays with the listener's expectation of this. Other media=\\"Skulduggery\\" (short story) Published in the 2006 charity anthology Shelf Life, \\"Skulduggery\\" by Fiona Moore and Alan Stevens centres on a scheme concocted by Carnell, at the behest of Landerchild, to assassinate Chairholder Uvanov using a skull covered in contact poison. The story takes place shortly before Death's Head and acts as a prelude to those events shedding additional light on the motives of its various characters.

Early life Jesse Brown was born on March 27, 1944, in Detroit, Michigan, to Lucille Marsh Brown and David Brown. He grew up in Chicago, Illinois, and graduated with honors from the City Colleges of Chicago. Married to Sylvia Scott Brown, they had two children, N. Scott Brown and Carmen Brown. Military service He enlisted in the United States Marine Corps in 1963, and served as a Marine in the Vietnam War, reaching the rank of Corporal. He was seriously injured in 1965 near Da Nang when he was shot in the right arm, which was left partially paralyzed. Returning to Chicago, in 1967 Brown became active in the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), a service and advocacy organization founded in 1920 to assist disabled veterans. He began taking classes at Roosevelt University in Chicago. Moving to the DAV's national office in Washington, D.C., he began taking classes at The Catholic University of America. Veterans service=DAV In 1967, Brown joined the staff of the Disabled American Veterans. He served in various supervisory roles with the DAV in the 1970s and 1980s: * 1973 -- supervisor of National Service Office in Washington, D.C. * 1976 -- supervisor of National Appeals Office * 1981 -- Chief of Claims, National Service and Legislative Headquarters * 1983 -- Deputy National Service Director In 1988, Brown became the DAV's first African-American executive director, serving until 1993. Jesse Brown and President Bill Clinton at the Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery (1993) Secretary of Veterans Affairs In January 1993, Brown was selected by President Bill Clinton to the post of Secretary of Veterans Affairs, serving until 1997. He was the first African American to hold that post. He is also the first former enlisted member of the United States Armed Forces named Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. During his tenure, Brown expanded the services offered to female veterans, homeless veterans, and veterans who were ill due to chemical exposures in Vietnam or the Gulf War. After he resigned as secretary, Brown founded a consulting firm, Brown and Associates. Disabled veterans' memorial Brown was one of three people who provided the impetus for the creation of the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial, a national memorial in Washington, D.C., which honors disabled veterans. In 1998, philanthropist Lois Pope realized there was no memorial to disabled veterans in the nation's capital. Although she did not know him, Pope called Brown's Veterans Affairs office to plead for a memorial. Pope called every day for the next six months, until finally Brown's secretary put her call through. Brown agreed to support legislation establishing a memorial. Brown introduced Pope to Art Wilson, the National Adjutant (e.g., chief executive officer) of the DAV. The DAV was itself not a nonprofit, and thus Pope and Wilson agreed that a new foundation, the American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation (AVDLMF; also known as the Disabled Veterans' LIFE Memorial Foundation) should be created. Brown left office in 1997. Brown, Pope, and Wilson incorporated the foundation in 1998, and Wilson was named its president. Brown served as the executive director of the American Disabled Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial Foundation until his death. The three individuals and their supporters began lobbying Congress to win passage of the necessary federal legislation. Congress quickly approved the bill, and President Clinton signed it into law (Public Law 106-348) on October 24, 2000. After a decade of fundraising, the memorial began construction in 2011. It was dedicated by President Barack Obama on October 5, 2014. Two quotations by Brown are featured on the memorial. Death Brown died in Warrenton, Virginia on August 15, 2002, of lower motor neuron syndrome. He had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, since 1999. His funeral was held at the Washington National Cathedral, and he was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Sylvia, and his children Carmen and Scott. The DAV established the Jesse Brown Memorial Youth Scholarship in his honor. A single $20,000 scholarship is awarded each year to a young individual who has worked to assist disabled veterans and advanced the cause of disabled veterans' rights. In May 2004, the West Side VA Medical Center in Chicago was renamed the Jesse Brown VA Medical Center in his honor.

The keytar does not produce any musical sounds by itself. As a MIDI controller, it only sends data about which keys or buttons are pressed to a MIDI-compatible sound module or synthesizer, which then produces the sounds. A MIDI controller is any hardware or software that generates and transmits Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) data to MIDI-enabled devices, typically to trigger sounds and control parameters of an electronic music performance. Features MIDI controllers usually do not create or produce musical sounds by themselves. MIDI controllers typically have some type of interface which the performer presses, strikes, blows or touches. This action generates MIDI data (e.g. notes played and their intensity), which can then be transmitted to a MIDI-compatible sound module or synthesizer using a MIDI cable. The sound module or synthesizer in turn produces a sound which is amplified through a loudspeaker. The most commonly used MIDI controller is the electronic musical keyboard MIDI controller. When the keys are played, the MIDI controller sends MIDI data about the pitch of the note, how hard the note was played and its duration. Other common MIDI controllers are wind controllers, which a musician blows into and presses keys to transmit MIDI data, and electronic drums. The MIDI controller can be populated with any number of sliders, knobs, buttons, pedals and other sensors, and may or may not include a piano keyboard. Many Audio control surfaces are MIDI-based and so are essentially MIDI controllers. While the most common use of MIDI controllers is to trigger musical sounds and play musical instruments, MIDI controllers are also used to control other MIDI- compatible devices, such as stage lights, digital audio mixers and complex guitar effects units. Types (hardware and software) The Roland Octapad percussion/drum controller. The following are classes of MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) controller: *The human interface component of a traditional instrument redesigned as a MIDI control device. The most common type of device in this class is the keyboard controller. Such a device provides a musical keyboard and perhaps other actuators (pitch bend and modulation wheels, for example) but produces no sound on its own. It is intended only to drive other MIDI devices. Percussion controllers such as the Roland Octapad fall into this class, as do a variety of wind controllers and guitar-like controllers such as the SynthAxe. *Electronic musical instruments, including synthesizers, samplers, drum machines, and electronic drums, which are used to perform music in real time and are inherently able to transmit a MIDI data stream of the performance. *Pitch-to-MIDI converters including guitar/synthesizers analyze a pitch and convert it into a MIDI signal. There are several devices that do this for the human voice and for monophonic instruments such as flutes, for example. *Traditional instruments such as drums, acoustic pianos, and accordions which are outfitted with sensors and a computer processor which accepts input from the sensors and transmits real- time performance information as MIDI data. The performance information (e.g., on which notes or drums are struck, and how hard) is then sent to a module or computer which converts the data into sounds (e.g., samples or synthesized sounds). *Sequencers, which store and retrieve MIDI data and send the data to MIDI enabled instruments in order to reproduce a performance. *MIDI Machine Control (MMC) devices such as recording equipment, which transmit messages to aid in the synchronization of MIDI-enabled devices. For example, a recorder may have a feature to index a recording by measure and beat. The sequencer that it controls would stay synchronized with it as the recorder's transport controls are pushed and corresponding MIDI messages transmitted. *MIDI Show Control (MSC) devices such as show controllers, which transmit messages to aid in the operation and cueing of live theatrical and themed entertainment productions. For example, a variety of show control sub systems such as sound consoles, sound playback controllers, virtual audio matrices and switchers, video playback systems, rigging controllers, pyro and lighting control systems directly respond to MSC commands. However, most standalone generic MSC controllers are intended to actuate a generic computerized show control system that has been carefully programmed to produce the complex desired results that the show demands at each moment of the production. Performance controllers Two-octave MIDI controllers are popular for use with laptop computers, due to their portability. This unit provides a variety of real-time controllers, which can manipulate various sound design parameters of computer-based or standalone hardware instruments, effects, mixers and recording devices. MIDI was designed with keyboards in mind, and any controller that is not a keyboard is considered an \\"alternative\\" controller. This was seen as a limitation by composers who were not interested in keyboard-based music, but the standard proved flexible, and MIDI compatibility was introduced to other types of controllers, including guitars, wind instruments and drum machines. Keyboards Keyboards are by far the most common type of MIDI controller. These are available in sizes that range from 25-key, 2-octave models, to full- sized 88-key instruments. Some are keyboard-only controllers, though many include other real-time controllers such as sliders, knobs, and wheels. Commonly, there are also connections for sustain and expression pedals. Most keyboard controllers offer the ability to split the playing area into zones, which can be of any desired size and can overlap with each other. Each zone can be assigned to a different MIDI channel and can be set to play any desired range of notes. This allows a single playing surface to control a number of different devices.Huber, David Miles. \\"The MIDI Manual\\". Carmel, Indiana: SAMS, 1991. MIDI capabilities can also be built into traditional keyboard instruments, such as grand pianos and Rhodes pianos. Pedal keyboards can operate the pedal tones of a MIDI organ, or can drive a bass synthesizer. MIDI wind controllers can produce expressive, natural-sounding performances in a way that is difficult to achieve with keyboard controllers. Wind controllers Wind controllers allow MIDI parts to be played with the same kind of expression and articulation that is available to players of wind and brass instruments. They allow breath and pitch glide control that provide a more versatile kind of phrasing, particularly when playing sampled or physically modeled wind instrument parts. A typical wind controller has a sensor that converts breath pressure to volume information, and may allow pitch control through a lip pressure sensor and a pitch-bend wheel. Some models include a configurable key layout that can emulate different instruments' fingering systems.White, Paul. \\"Yamaha WX5\\". Sound On Sound. SOS Publications. Jul 1998. Print. Examples of such controllers include Akai's Electronic Wind Instrument (EWI) and Electronic Valve Instrument (EVI). The EWI uses a system of keypads and rollers modeled after a traditional woodwind instrument, while the EVI is based on an acoustic brass instrument, and has three switches that emulate a trumpet's valves.Manning, Peter. Electronic and Computer Music. 1985. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1994. Print. Simpler breath controllers are also available. Unlike wind controllers, they do not trigger notes and are intended for use in conjunction with a keyboard or synthesizer. Drum and percussion controllers Drum controllers, such as the Roland V-Drums, are often built in the form of an actual drum kit. The unit's sound module is mounted to the left. Keyboards can be used to trigger drum sounds, but are impractical for playing repeated patterns such as rolls, due to the length of key travel. After keyboards, drum pads are the next most significant MIDI performance controllers. Drum controllers may be built into drum machines, may be standalone control surfaces, or may emulate the look and feel of acoustic percussion instruments. MIDI triggers can also be installed into acoustic drum and percussion instruments. The pads built into drum machines are typically too small and fragile to be played with sticks, and are played with fingers. Dedicated drum pads such as the Roland Octapad or the DrumKAT are playable with the hands or with sticks. There are also percussion controllers such as the vibraphone-style MalletKAT, and Marimba Lumina. Pads that can trigger a MIDI device can be homemade from a piezoelectric sensor and a practice pad or other piece of foam rubber.White, Paul. \\"DIY Drum Pads And Pedal Triggers\\". Sound On Sound SOS Publications. Aug 1995. Print. Stringed instrument controllers A guitar can be fitted with special pickups that digitize the instrument's output, and allow it to play a synthesizer's sounds. These assign a separate MIDI channel for each string, and may give the player the choice of triggering the same sound from all six strings, or playing a different sound from each. Some models, such as Yamaha's G10, dispense with the traditional guitar body and replace it with electronics. Other systems, such as Roland's MIDI pickups, are included with or can be retrofitted to a standard instrument.

Examples of the latter include Akai's APC40 controller for Ableton Live, and Korg's MS-20ic controller that is a reproduction of their MS-20 analog synthesizer.

Buttons, sliders, and knobs are the most common controllers provided, but rotary encoders, transport controls, joysticks, ribbon controllers, vector touchpads in the style of Korg's Kaoss pad, and optical controllers such as Roland's D-Beam may also be present. Control surfaces may be used for mixing, sequencer automation, turntablism, and lighting control. Specialized real- time controllers Audio control surfaces often resemble mixing consoles in appearance, and enable a level of hands-on control for changing parameters such as sound levels and effects applied to individual tracks of a multitrack recording or live performance output. MIDI footswitches are commonly used to send MIDI program change commands to effects devices, but may be combined with pedals in a pedalboard that allows detailed programming of effects units. Pedals are available in the form of on/off switches, either momentary or latching, or as \\"rocker\\" pedals whose position determines the value of a MIDI continuous controller. Drawbar controllers are for use with MIDI and virtual organs. Along with a set of drawbars for timbre control, they may provide controls for standard organ effects such as rotating speaker speed, vibrato and chorus. Use in a data stream : See also: General MIDI: Controller events Modifiers such as modulation wheels, pitch bend wheels, sustain pedals, pitch sliders, buttons, knobs, faders, switches, ribbon controllers, etc., alter an instrument's state of operation, and thus can be used to modify sounds or other parameters of music performance in real time via MIDI connections. The 128 virtual MIDI controllers and their electronic messages connect the actual buttons, knobs, wheels, sliders, etc. with their intended actions within the receiving device. Some controllers, such as pitch bend, are special. Whereas the data range of most continuous controllers (such as volume, for example) consists of 128 steps ranging in value from 0 to 127, pitch bend data may be encoded with over 16,000 data steps. This produces the illusion of a continuously sliding pitch, as in a violin's portamento, rather than a series of zippered steps such as a guitarist sliding their finger up the frets of their guitar's neck. Thus, the pitch wheel on a MIDI keyboard may generate large amounts of data which can lead to a slowdown of data throughput. The original MIDI spec included 128 virtual controller numbers for real time modifications to live instruments or their audio. MIDI Show Control (MSC) and MIDI Machine Control (MMC) are two separate extensions of the original MIDI spec, expanding MIDI protocol to accept far more than its original intentions. Common products The most common MIDI controllers encountered are various sizes of \\"piano\\" keyboards. A modern controller lacks internal sound-generation, instead acting as a primary or secondary input for a synthesizer, digital sampler or a computer running a VST instrument or other software sound generator. Many have several user-definable knobs and slide controls that can control aspects of a synthesizer's sound in real-time. Such controllers are much cheaper than a full synthesizer, and are increasingly equipped with Universal Serial Bus, which allows connection to a computer without a MIDI interface. Despite not using MIDI directly, software applications recognize such controllers as a MIDI device. In most cases, a USB-equipped controller can draw necessary power from the interface's 5v line, and does not require an A/C adapter when connected to a computer. Keyboards range in size from 88 weighted-action keys to portable 25-key models.

Although her career was not especially remarkable, save perhaps for being consistently profitable as a cargo carrier, in the 1930s Richard Cookson went on board and extensively documented Lawhill's internals and construction, which was later published in the Anatomy of the Ship series. Construction Lawhill was built at the Caledon Shipbuilding & Engineering Company yard of W. B. Thompson in Dundee, Scotland, and launched on 24 August 1892. And it was named after the Law, a hill in the middle of Dundee, Lawhill had been ordered by shipowner Charles Barrie for the jute trade, but only made two voyages carrying jute before the business became unprofitable, and shifted to other cargoes. Service During the 1890s, a demand was developing for kerosene in the Far East, which could be more efficiently carried by sail at the time (the Falls of Clyde would take up this unusual trade several years later), and on August 31. 1899 Lawhill was sold to the Lawhill Sailing Ship Co. Ltd. (F. E. Bliss, manager), London, together with her sistership Juteopolis. Captain John C. B. Jarvis of Dundee, inventor of the eponymous brace winch, was given command of the ship (September 1, 1899 - January 21, 1911). In June 1900 the barque was transferred to the Anglo-American Oil Company. She made nine voyages carrying oil and other cargoes, then the development of storage tank capacity reduced demand, and Lawhill went, again together with her sistership Juteopolis, to Geo. Windram & Co. of Liverpool in 1911. Captain J. A. Sanders became her new master. In the year 1914, she was sold to Finnish owner August Troberg under the command of Captain Edward August Jansson, and Lawhill became Finland's largest sailing ship. Despite the hazards of World War I, Lawhill continued to sail, managing to elude U-boats and arrive unescorted into Brest in May 1917, carrying wheat from Australia. However, French authorities refused to let Lawhill leave, citing the risks, and used her as a store ship. While in port, Lawhill was purchased by another Finn, Gustaf Erikson, but before she could get to sea, Finland became an ally of Germany, and in June 1918, the French government officially requisitioned Lawhill. The French started to convert Lawhill to a motor ship, but after much protest, Erikson finally got her back in January 1919, and, under the command of Captain Karl Reuben de Cloux, she resumed carrying wheat, first from Argentina, then from Australia again, as well as timber and other cargoes. The author Alan Villiers served on Lawhill, until injured off Port Lincoln in a fall from the yardarm in 1922. On 1 October 1932, she rammed and sank Polish steamer SS Niemen (3.107 BRT) in Kattegat. As for the trial of Captain S√∂derlund, the Lawhill master, he was found not guilty. After twenty years of steady service as a grain carrier, Lawhill was arrested on August 21, 1941 while in East London after a return from Australia and officially confiscated finally by the South African government in April 1942 (or September 22, 1942) as a prize of war, Finland having sided with the Axis. The ship was used by the South African Railways & Harbour Administration for cargo during the war, then sold to private citizens of South Africa (in 1946 to Lawhill (Pty) Ltd., East London and in 1947 to Thomas Worker and Herman Olthaver, Johannesburg, for the sum of ¬£9,000), who used Lawhill on several voyages to Argentina with coal and returning with a cargo of wheat. In November 1947 she sailed from Louren√ßo Marques under the command of Captain Madry A. Lindholm to Port Victoria in ballast and returned to Beira, Mozambique, with a cargo of wheat. This was in fact her last long voyage at sea. Showing signs of deterioration, she was sold to Marcio da Silva Jr of Louren√ßo Marques and arrived there, after a short voyage of from Beira, with great ceremony in September 1948. However, the necessary repairs were beyond the means of her new owners, and she was laid up in the Tembe River where she rotted at anchor for many years. After a last transfer to Joaquim Fernandes Coelho, the old ship was finally broken up for scrap sometime in the late 1950s.

Early life Eschenbach was born in Breslau, Germany (now Wroc≈Çaw, Poland). His parents were Margarethe (n√©e Jaross) and Heribert Ringmann. He was orphaned during World War II. His mother died giving birth to him; his father, a politically active anti-Nazi, was sent to the Eastern front as part of a Nazi punishment battalion where he was killed.Christoph Eschenbach in \\"A Wayfarer's Journey: Listening to Mahler.\\" Ruth Yorkin Drazen, PBS, 2007. As a result of this trauma, Eschenbach did not speak for a year, until he was asked if he wanted to play music.Interview with Margaret Throsby broadcast on ABC Classic FM on 31 July 2013. Wallydore Eschenbach (n√©e Jaross), his mother's cousin, adopted him in 1946 and began to teach him to play the piano. At age 11, he attended a concert conducted by Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler which had a great impact on him. In 1955, Eschenbach enrolled at the Musikhochschule in Cologne, studying piano with Hans-Otto Schmidt-Neuhaus and conducting with Wilhelm Br√ºckner-R√ºggeberg. He then pursued further studies at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater Hamburg with (piano) and Wilhelm Br√ºckner-R√ºggeberg (conducting). Musical career As a pianist,88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva √âditions, 2015, p. 52 and 277. Eschenbach has won numerous first-place piano competition prizes, including first prize in the Clara Haskil Competition in Vevey, Switzerland in 1965. In 1964, he made his first recording (of Mozart) for Deutsche Grammophon and signed a contract with the label. Eschenbach continued to study conducting with George Szell, with whom he worked for more than three years. In addition, he counted Herbert von Karajan as a mentor. In 1981, Eschenbach became principal guest conductor of the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich, and was chief conductor from 1982 to 1986. He was co-artistic director of the Pacific Music Festival from 1992 to 1998. He was chief conductor of the NDR Symphony Orchestra, Hamburg from 1998 to 2004. He was artistic director of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival from 1999 until 2003. From 2000 to 2010, Eschenbach was Music Director of the Orchestre de Paris.David Patrick Stearns, \\"Eschenbach out of post in Paris\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 1 June 2007. In the United States, Eschenbach was music director of the Houston Symphony Orchestra from 1988 to 1999. The orchestra toured Japan and Europe under his tenure as well made several recordings with Koch International Classics and RCA. In honour of his achievements and tenure with the Houston Symphony, the City of Houston placed a bronze commemorative star with his name in front of Jones Hall, the performance home of the Houston Symphony. He was music director of the Ravinia Festival from 1994 to 2005. Eschenbach has made more than 80 recordings as piano soloist, conductor, or both, has appeared in several television documentaries, and has made many concert broadcasts for different European, Japanese and U.S. networks. Eschenbach is credited with helping and supporting talented young musicians in their career development, including soprano Ren√©e Fleming, pianists Tzimon Barto and Lang Lang, cellists Claudio Boh√≥rquez, and Daniel M√ºller-Schott, and soprano Marisol Montalvo. Philadelphia Orchestra Eschenbach became the seventh Music Director of The Philadelphia Orchestra in 2003. His appointment generated controversy because, at the time of the announcement, Eschenbach had not conducted the orchestra in over four years and there was a perceived lack of personal chemistry between him and the musicians prior to the appointment.Peter Dobrin, \\"Orchestra has some lessons to consider\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 29 October 2006. One musician from the orchestra had stated, after the announcement: : \\"'When this announcement was proclaimed after a half-hour meeting with us, there wasn't applause; there was criticism,' recalled a musician with the Philadelphia Orchestra. 'One member of the search committee got up and said, \\"You'll see, you'll like him.\\" 'The orchestra was taken aback by the attitude because there was no meeting to verify what we thought,' the musician said. 'There was no chemistry with Eschenbach. He hasn't conducted us in four or five years and 20 to 30 persons had never played with him.'\\" In a 2004 article, Eschenbach tried to downplay such statements, and noted his own particular style of interpretation: : \\"I prefer to have flexible tempos and not be fixed. Quicker tempos tend to court superficiality.\\" Partway into his tenure, his initial 3-year contract was renewed to 2008. However, in October 2006, the orchestra and Eschenbach announced that he would conclude his tenure in Philadelphia at the close of the 2007‚Äì2008 season. In the weeks prior to his departure, Philadelphia Inquirer music critics Peter Dobrin and David Patrick Stearns had contrasting articles whether or not he should be retained, with Dobrin suggesting that Eschenbach should move onPeter Dobrin, \\"Call it quits: Start search now for a harmonious match.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, 24 September 2006. and Stearns arguing that Eschenbach should remain.David Patrick Stearns, \\"Keep him: His personal music-making is a treasure.\\" Philadelphia Inquirer, 24 September 2006. Other harsh criticism of Eschenbach's tenure in Philadelphia has been aired.Baxter, Robert, \\"Few standing ovations for Eschenbach.\\" Courier-Post, 15 October 2006. Following the announcement, Dobrin in the Inquirer wrote that Eschenbach's tenure in Philadelphia has been difficult for many musicians: : \\"In three seasons, Eschenbach and the orchestra have produced a handful of brilliant concerts. More often, though, his rehearsals and performances have elicited a long list of complaints from musicians: getting lost in the score at concerts; leading disorganized rehearsals and then asking for overtime; and insisting on a peculiar rushing and slowing of tempos.\\"Peter Dobrin, \\"Eschenbach to bow out in 2008\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 21 October 2006. The paper also cited a number of accomplishments including a new recording contract and the appointment of nine musicians, four of whom were principals. In addition, Eschenbach has received praise for his work in fund-raising for the orchestra.Peter Dobrin, \\"Palm Beach overture\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 3 April 2005.Peter Dobrin, \\"In tune with the task\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 30 August 2006. Following the announcement and Dobrin's Inquirer article, The Philadelphia Orchestra Association posted a letter on its website, dated 27 October 2006, which also was sent by e-mail to orchestra patrons. A quote from this letter condemned Dobrin's criticism: : \\"We, and many in the community, feel that in recent press coverage there have been personal attacks on Maestro Eschenbach, along with negative innuendo about his relationship with The Philadelphia Orchestra. ...These types of comments about Maestro Eschenbach and our orchestra are ridiculous, offensive and defamatory. Our entire orchestra family is profoundly disappointed when reporters report the news in such an ungracious way.\\"Letter from The Philadelphia Orchestra Association, 27 October 2006, posted on website 16 November 2006, sent to patrons by e-mail October 2006. Dobrin, in turn, responded in a 29 October 2006 Philadelphia Inquirer article by quoting one of his 2001 Inquirer articles around the time of the Eschenbach announcement: : \\"....let me quote from something I wrote in March 2001 that might be an important reminder about how we got to this dangerous place: :: It hit many musicians like the dull thud of pragmatism, this decision in January to hire Eschenbach as the orchestra's seventh music director, starting in September 2003. At a meeting announcing the decision, players responded with silence. No applause, no excited stamping of feet. Silence. And then the resentment poured forth. One musician used the word \\"underwhelmed.\\" Another said he felt \\"betrayed.\\"... This contrasts with earlier reports of how the musicians \\"had input\\" in the choice of the previous Philadelphia music director, Wolfgang Sawallisch. In addition, the new orchestra president (as of 2006), James Undercofler, had spoken with orchestra musicians, and had told Eschenbach this summary of his discussions with them: : \\"-that 80 percent of the musicians did not agree with his artistic interpretations; : -that 80 percent of the musicians left concerts feeling great anger; : -and that the orchestra was a \\"ticking time bomb.\\"Peter Dobrin, \\"Eschenbach talks of a 'time bomb'\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 16 November 2006. In an article by Cragg Hines in the newspaper The Washingtonian on 1 December 2009 Eschenbach was quoted: : \\"They said there was a survey of the whole orchestra and more than 80 percent of the orchestra was against me. I asked the management 'was that true?' and was told, ‚ÄòYes, it's true.' It was not true at all. As I found out a little later, this survey never happened [...] All of the musicians regretted very, very much that [it] was reported like this.\\" In a 2007 article, Mark Swed of the Los Angeles Times has written about the Eschenbach/Philadelphia Orchestra situation: : \\"{Eschenbach} is one of the world's finest musicians and widely recognized as such. He has ideas. He has sophisticated tastes. He is cosmopolitan. He is an exciting interpreter. Colleagues speak of him warmly, and he is a favorite accompanist for singers.....So what's wrong? Just about everything. It is well known that the orchestra opposed the hiring of Eschenbach. He hadn't conducted in Philadelphia for five years when the appointment was made, and a memo was leaked to the press with 75 players' signatures asking management to hold off any decision until the orchestra got a chance to work with him. From the beginning, the relationship started off on the wrong foot...But the Philadelphia orchestra has not been exactly transformed by Eschenbach. I've been hearing reports of players looking bored onstage. Audiences walk out during performances. Even two years ago, at my last visit to Verizon Hall, the atmosphere was palpably unpleasant.\\"Mark Swed, \\"A Classic Coup\\". Los Angeles Times, 21 January 2007. In a June 2007 article, Stearns reported Eschenbach as commenting on the Philadelphia Orchestra management as follows: : \\"The management in both cases [Paris and Philadelphia], I'm sorry to say, is amateurish\\"....\\"The management knows what I think ... it's not a secret\\". In a July 2007 article, Dobrin emphasized that the problems in the Eschenbach/Philadelphia Orchestra relationship were not related to personality, but rather to musical quality: : \\"While many refuse to believe it, the factor that has undermined Christoph Eschenbach's tenure is not personality. He's a lovely guy; he and the players have a cordial off-stage relationship. The problem is the music. If 80 percent of the musicians leave concerts angry ‚Äì as Eschenbach told players that president James Undercofler had told him ‚Äì that's corrosive to the music and the institution.\\"Peter Dobrin, \\"Youth takes another podium, in NYC\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 19 July 2007. In August 2007, the orchestra announced extended guest-conducting periods for Eschenbach with the ensemble in the 2008‚Äì2009 and 2009‚Äì2010 seasons, after the conclusion of his tenure as music director.David Patrick Stearns, \\"Eschenbach, orchestra to continue relationship\\". Philadelphia Inquirer, 15 August 2007. Later career On 25 September 2008 the National Symphony Orchestra (NSO) appointed Eschenbach as its sixth music director, effective with the 2010‚Äì11 season, as well as the newly created music director of the Kennedy Center. In September 2011 the NSO and the Kennedy Center announced the extension of Eschenbach's contract through the 2014‚Äì2015 season. In March 2014, the organisations announced an extension of Eschenbach's contract through the 2016‚Äì2017 season. In February 2015, the NSO announced the scheduled conclusion of Eschenbach's tenure as NSO music director at the end of the 2016‚Äì2017 season, at which time he became the NSO's conductor laureate. In November 2017 the Konzerthausorchester Berlin announced the appointment of Eschenbach as its next chief conductor, effective with the 2019‚Äì2020 season, with an initial contract of 3 years.

The Latin title of the piece is Cato Maior de Senectute. To lend his reflections greater import,Cicero, \\"On Old Age\\", William Melmoth, transl. p. 2 Cicero wrote his essay such that the esteemed Cato the Elder was lecturing to Scipio Africanus and Gaius Laelius Sapiens. Content It was written by Cicero in his sixty- third year, and is addressed to his friend Atticus. Cicero represents the discourse as delivered by the elder Cato (in his eighty-fourth year) on occasion of young Scipio and Laelius expressing their admiration at the wonderful ease with which he still bore the load of life. Cicero acknowledges that the sentiments put into the mouth of Cato are really Cicero's own. His purpose is to show that old age is not only tolerable, but comfortable by internal resources of happiness. He examines the infirmities of old age under four general headings:‚Äîthat it incapacitates from mingling in the affairs of the world‚Äîthat it produces infirmities of body‚Äîthat it stops the enjoyment of sensual gratifications‚Äîand that it brings us to the verge of death. Some of these supposed disadvantages, he maintains, are imaginary, and for any real pleasures of which the old are deprived, others more refined and higher may be substituted. Overall the view of old age is optimistic. He denies, for instance, that the memory is impaired‚Äîthat no old man ever forgot where he had concealed his treasure. The whole work is illustrated by examples of eminent Roman citizens who had passed a respected and agreeable old age.

The legal rights of women refers to the social and human rights of women. One of the first women's rights declarations was the Declaration of Sentiments. The dependent position of women in early law is proved by the evidence of most ancient systems. Mosaic law In the Mosaic law, for monetary matters, women's and men's rights were almost exactly equal. A woman was entitled to her own private property, including land, livestock, slaves, and servants. A woman had the right to inherit whatever anyone bequeathed to her as a death gift, and inherited equally with brothers and in the absence of sons would inherit everything.A woman could likewise bequeath her belongings to others as a death gift. Upon dying intestate, a woman's property would be inherited by her children if she had them, her husband if she was married, or her father if she were single. A woman could sue in court and did not need a male to represent her. In some situations, women actually had more rights than men. For example, captive women had to be ransomed prior to any male captives. Even though sons inherited property, they had a responsibility to support their mother and sisters from the estate, and had to ensure that both mother and sisters were taken care of prior to their being able to benefit from the inheritance, and if that wiped out the estate, the boys had to supplement their income from elsewhere. When it came to specific religious or sacramental activities, women had fewer opportunities or privileges than men. For example, in monetary or capital cases women could not serve as witnesses. A woman could not serve as a kohen in the Temple. A woman could not serve as queen regnant, the monarch had to be male. A divorce could only be granted by the husband, upon which time she would receive the Ketubah and the return of significant portions of her dowry. The vow of an unmarried girl between the ages of 12 years and 12 years and six months might be nullified by her father and the vow of a wife that affected marital obligations may be annulled by her husband; the guilt or innocence of a wife accused of adultery might tested through the Sotah process, although this only was successful if the husband was innocent of adultery, and daughters could inherit only in the absence of sons.  Mesopotamian law  In Ancient Mesopotamia, the legal status of women was related directly to how females were characterized in society. Most mentions of women were in relation to fertility, property, or sex and these laws dictated both the severity of the punishment as well as the way the situation was handled by the community based on the social status of the person in question. Thanks to the Code of Hammurapi/Hammurabi, we are able to see that women in these societies had limited rights when it came to divorce, fertility, property, and sex. A way to examine the legal status of women under The Code of Hammurabi is by looking at the laws pertaining to inheritance. In the absence of a dowry, daughters were to be included in the inheritance after their father's death and have legal rights to collect a portion of moveable goods from the paternal house. We can see that women could inherit assets or money from their father or mother, creating a level of legal equality to men in Mesopotamian society in that the value of their inheritance or dowry belonged to them personally. If a married woman died, her dowry was to be divided amongst her children and not returned to her father. If a situation arose where the first-ranking wife of a man who also has children that he does not raise or recognize should die, she has a legal right to receive both her dowry and marriage settlement, retain residence in her husband's home, and pass on her own property to her children. There were limits to her legal rights in that she was not allowed to sell her deceased husband's home. The slave women in question, along with any of her children, would be freed. If the children the slave women had with the master of the household were recognized by him as his own children, upon his death, the estate would have been divided equally between the children of the slave woman and the first ranking wife. Sources use these legal examples to show that children were not granted more or less money solely based on their mother's societal ranking. Another way in which we can examine the legal status of women in Mesopotamian society is through their fertility rights. Here we see the laws categorizing women based on their social status. If a noble beat a pregnant woman so severely that she miscarried her child, he would be forced to pay restitution. The amount of the compensation was determined by the social status of the expecting mother, ten shekels of silver for the fetus of a noblewoman, five for the fetus of a woman from the commoner class, and two for the fetus of a noble's slave woman. Through the lens of assault, we can further uncover the legal rights of Mesopotamian women. Men were given punishments for the crimes they committed. The Code of Hammurabi dictated that if a father raped his daughter, he would be banished from the city. The punishment dictated for a man who rapes a virgin bride during the engagement period for which she still lives with her family is much harsher. In this situation, the rapist is executed, and the woman is allowed to go free. Laws regulating sex were also prominent in Mesopotamian law. Adultery, seen as a crime against the community and its morals. Though the husband was not entitled to any financial compensation or the right to lessen his wife's punishment under the law he could save her from execution. If a wife of another man was caught laying with another man, The Code of Hammurabi states that they should be executed together, unless the husband allows his wife to live in which case the king would also pardon the man she engaged in relations with. If a husband accuses his wife of adultery without catching her in the act, all she must do is swear her innocence in an oath to god. If she is accused by someone who is not her husband under the same circumstances, she must submit to the Divine River ordeal to prove her innocence to her husband. Basalt slate erected by King Hammurabi and inscribed with law code. Though Mesopotamian law allowed a woman to function on her own, the societal norm was to act under the management of a male family member such as a brother, husband, or adult son. Rarely were single women in charge of their own households without a masculine influence. Egyptian law Carving on mortuary temple wall of Hatshepsut. In Ancient Egypt, legally, a woman shared the same rights and status as a man ‚Äì at least, theoretically. An Egyptian woman was entitled to her own private property, which could include land, livestock, slaves and servants, etc. She had the right to inherit whatever anyone bequeathed to her, as well as bequeathing her belongings to others. She could divorce her husband (upon which all possessions belonging to her ‚Äì including the dowry ‚Äì were reverted to her sole ownership), and sue in court.A husband can be flogged and/or fined for beating his wife. When it came to the legal rights of women in ancient Egypt, they seemed to enjoy a variety of more rights than their other ancient female counterparts. On the surface it would be easy to write off saying that females and males had equal rights when looking at the surface level of their rights, but if one were to look at the bigger picture, that image is chipped away. One interesting view into the legal standing of women is the practice of crime and punishment. When looking through the lens of adultery we can see what effects it would have on a woman's legal standing. Adultery was not only looked at as a form of crime that put her property at risk, but also as a moral crime/failing. When men and women committed adultery it was a clear violation of their marriage contracts and other forms of public and personal contacts, such as wills. Depending on the different sources on the topic, a range of different punishments could result if a woman either committed adultery herself or was the woman who was the mistress. One thing that was always up for debate once the adultery was brought against her was the question of her rights being stripped of her. Such rights that are up for debate include her property and rights to her dowry, in certain instances. Who was handing down the punishment could determine how much of her property or dowry could be taken away, which could be determined by a woman's status in society, among other deciding factors. Different sources talk about harsh punishments for both parties involved in an adulterous relationship, with early accounts claiming that if a woman was found guilty, she could have her nose lopped off and a man could receive lashes for such actions. One such person that these sources derive from is Diodorus, who was from Sicily and Greek Historian. His accounts, and others like his, seem to be harsh and should be looked at through a lens of skepticism at their credibility because most of these severe punishment accounts come from outside sources. Instead one should look at sources that come from within the different Egyptian dynasties and historians that point to a more legalistic punishment of certain dowry and property rights being taken away. Most notably, a woman could conduct legal matters without a male to represent her. However, the average woman still centered her time around the home and family. When looking at other facets of marriage and family life in ancient Egypt, women of the time had more of an upper hand than the rest of women from surrounding cultures. The evidence that has survived usually describes the internal affairs of elite marriages and family, which seem to paint an image of greater equality within the family. Within Egyptian culture family traced its lineage through matrilineal descent. This emphasis on women can also be seen in how property rights were passed from mother to daughter. One thing that should be pointed out about this is that even if the property rights were passed through matrilineal descent it did not mean that men relinquished the overall control of the property. Equal status between men and women in marriage in ancient Egypt can also be interpreted in how men and women are pictured in different art forms of being seated together as equals or a female standing behind with an arm around her husband also alluding to a shared power relationship. Certain inscriptions have also been found that depict these power relations as well as listing certain titles elite women could hold Women, unlike their female counterparts in other regions of the world, also enjoyed being in public and could own businesses. They had a right to be able to work outside the home, whether that be alongside their husbands or by owning a business of their own. Inside the home the wife's opinion in matters might reign supreme or have great influence in certain affairs to maintain balance within the home. Their opinion could be voiced when it came to negotiating contracts outside the house, but not always as the main deal broker . A defining piece of an ancient Egyptian marriage which laid out the rights of both parties involved was the marriage contract. The marriage contracts that have been reviewed show that in the case of divorce or even the death of the husband, property and any monetary funds would be bestowed upon her. A few women became pharaohs ( Hatshepsut and Cleopatra ), and women held important positions in government and trade. When it came to elite women in ancient Egypt there were few women who made it to the top of the hierarchy: to be a pharaoh. As listed before, the two most well known are Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII. They held the same types of rights and prestige as their male counterparts, but their rule was not the common way of inheritance of the throne. The rights of women in ancient Egypt overall were seen as greater than that of other women of the time, but they still had restrictions to their power. Whether that be through limiting certain public interactions or family negotiations or even having their rights curtailed because of having an adulterous affair, but in a theoretical sense in the biggest ways that count men and women shared a balanced sort of rights within society.  Hittite law  In Hittite law, there were parts where women had similar rights to men as well as other sections where they were treated differently or unequally. In general, women had just as much right to have their legal cases heard as men did. This is one aspect where they enjoyed the same rights that men did. In addition, Hittite women were also given more freedom in terms of their place in society. For instance, they were not relegated to the household; in fact, they were open to joining every career if they wanted, even the military. They were also seen as more of an equal in terms of marriage and property ownership. The elevated status for women most likely was due to their role in childbirth and subsequent rearing. In other parts of the law, they were less equal. In cases of adultery, there were several distinctions that can be observed. First, if a wife was caught with another man by her husband, he had the right to kill her. The wife did not have this right if her husband was adulterous. Second, there is also a difference between married women and those who were single. Death was the typical punishment for committing adultery if a woman was married, whether it was by the husband when discovered in the act or by the king acting as chief justice after a trial. However, for single women, the same behavior was not considered a crime at all. The husband could also choose to divorce the wife if he decided to spare her life during the proceedings, or if he wanted to keep her, he would veil her to signify to the public that her status had been questioned due to the adultery. Rape is another example of explicit discrimination. Location was an important factor in determining who was punished. The man would only be penalized if the crime took place outside of the home. If instead, it occurred within the household, then the women was deemed the guilty party and reprimanded. This was because her consent in that setting was assumed to be automatically given. Here, the man would only be punished if caught by the husband in the act. Even though Hittite women did enjoy certain rights in society and the household, they were still highly patriarchal as well. The eldest man was still in charge of the household, even though his role was not absolute and more one of supervision. In addition, women were not consulted when decisions were being made about them, such as marriage arrangements. This is a depiction of the Hittite queen Puduhepa who due to a tradition of an independent and politically active queenship was able to have unprecedented influence in Hittite royal affairs.File:Kubaba relief.JPG.

One woman is a queen named Puduhepa who was able to have significant influence in courtly affairs. She was the most well known Hittite queen and considered by many to be among the most powerful women in the Ancient Near East. She was the daughter of a priest and wife of Hattusili III. He married her while on his way back from fighting in the Battle of Kadesh when he was told to stop by Ishtar. She was able to become queen when her husband took the Hittite throne. Of Hurrian origin, she was able to spread her culture as queen where it had an important effect on the Hittites. She also was a powerful ruler on her own. She participated actively in royal affairs and her influence in the state continued for a short while after the death of Hattusili. This situation was not inconceivable for the Hittites who, unlike their Mesopotamian contemporaries, already conceived of the role of queen as relatively powerful and independent. This openness to queens who were political allowed Puduhepa to have so much influence. However, even by these standards she was uniquely involved. Scholars have attributed this ability to a combination of the prerequisite of treating queens with honor and Puduhepa's ability to exploit the closeness she had with Hattusili, along with her disposition. She also played a big part in the religious transformation that occurred during her time as queen. Her name appears several times in texts about omen dreams and she was the author of two important prayers.

Another example of the Hittites' acceptance of women holding significant power is Kubaba, who was a Mesopotamian queen who ruled in her own right during the Early Dynastic Period or Kish III. She is also the only female who is on the Sumerian King List. The Weidner Chronicle also positively mentions her as \\"obtaining sovereignty\\" from Marduk. Her name is mentioned favorably by scribes in omen texts, and much of her reign has been expanded to included a sizable portion of legend. The reason she is connected to the Hittites is because she was turned into a goddess they worshipped. In fact, she had a significant cult around her. The first evidence of her existence as a deity is from early 18th century BCE. She was also worshipped by other societies in the Near East, including the Phrygians and Assyrians. She was a mother-goddess who was often depicted by the Hittites in bird form.  Athenian law  In ancient Athenian law, women lacked many of the legal rights given to their male counterparts. They were excluded from appearing in law courts or participating in the assembly. They were also legally prohibited from engaging in contracts worth any significant amount of money,The limit was set at the value of a medimnos of barley, which was not enough to feed a family for a week. There was an expectation that respectable women should not appear ‚Äì or even be talked about ‚Äì in public. Historians doubt that this ideal could have been attained except by the richest women, however. Women in Classical Athens did have the right to divorce, though they lost all rights to any children they had by their husband upon divorce. Roman law Bronze statuette of a young woman reading (latter 1st century) The laws of ancient Rome law, like the laws of ancient Athens law, profoundly disfavored women. Roman citizenship was tiered, and women could hold a form of second-class citizenship with certain limited legal privileges and protections unavailable to non-citizens, freedmen, or slaves, but not on par with men. Roman society and law was sexist and extremely patriarchal, and the law prohibited women from voting, standing for public office, serving in most civic priesthoods or serving in any capacity in the Roman military.A. N. Sherwin-White, Roman Citizenship (Oxford University Press, 1979), pp. 211 and 268Frier, pp. 31‚Äì32, 457. In the Early Republic, women were always under the legal control of some man; her father, her husband, or her legal guardian (the tutela mulierum perpetua, usually a relative) who was required to provide his formal approval for certain of her legal acts, usually involving transfers of property. This was reformed somewhat under Augustus when he enacted laws to encourage larger families; a women who had given birth to at least three named children was permitted to become sui luris (her own person, legally emancipated) in the event of divorcee or the death of her husband, not subject to the tutela legal guardianship. All children born of marriage were the exclusive possession of their father ‚Äì they inherited his social status, name, and citizenship. In the event of divorce or the father's death, the children remained in the sole custody of the father or his family. Children born outside of marriage inherited the social status, name, and citizenship of their mother unless and until the father later legitimated them. In the Early Empire (1st‚Äì2nd Centuries CE), daughters had the same right as sons to inherit should a parent die intestate (without a will).David Johnston, Roman Law in Context (Cambridge University Press, 1999), chapter 3.3Thomas, Yan (1991) \\"The Division of the Sexes in Roman Law\\", in A History of Women from Ancient Goddesses to Christian Saints. Harvard University Press. pp. 133‚Äì135. In the Early Republic, the legal control and property of a woman passed from her father to her husband, and she became subject to her husband (or his father's) potestas.Frier, p. 20. By the Late Republic, this sort of manus marriage was generally abandoned (except for patricians, because certain priesthoods were exclusively available to patricians born of a manus marriage) for the so-called \\"free marriage.\\" In this more common form, the bride remained under her father's potestas, and her husband had limited legal power over her. To the extent a Roman woman in a free marriage lived beyond the daily supervision of her father, she enjoyed a higher degree of autonomy than most women in the ancient world. By the Late Republic divorce and remarriage was relatively common, though some felt it was virtuous to marry only once.Treggiari, Susan (1991). Roman Marriage. New York: Oxford University Press. . pp. 258‚Äì259, 500‚Äì502. When her father died, she became sui iuris (typically much earlier than a woman in a manus marriage).Frier, pp. 19‚Äì20, 22. A father or husband could, through a provision in his will, allow his wife or daughter to select her own tutela, which would allow her to replace an uncooperative one. A mother's right to own property and to dispose of by making a will could provide her with a certain influence over her adult sons.Beth Severy, Augustus and the Family at the Birth of the Empire (Routledge, 2002; Taylor & Francis, 2004), p. 12. The property of a bride in a free marriage didn't convert to the ownership of her husband, it remained in the control of her father until he passed.Frier, pp. 19‚Äì20. By the Late Republic there were women who owned substantial property and controlled major businesses.Frier, p. 461W. V. Harris, \\"Trade\\", in The Cambridge Ancient History: The High Empire A.D. 70‚Äì192 (Cambridge University Press, 2000), vol. 11, p. 733. For a time, Roman women could argue as advocates in courtsRichard A. Bauman, Women and Politics in Ancient Rome (Routledge, 1992, 1994), p. 50. but a subsequent law prohibited them from representing the interests of others.Bauman, Women and Politics, pp. 50‚Äì51; Juvenal, Satire 6, on women busy in the courts. Some women were known to be effective legal strategists.Bauman, Women and Politics, pp. 51‚Äì52. Adultery was an illicit sex act (stuprum) determined entirely by the status of the woman. If a married woman had sex with any man besides her husband, she was guilty of adultery. However, if a married man had sex with a woman who was not or could not be legally married, there was no offense.Martha C. Nussbaum, \\"The Incomplete Feminism of Musonius Rufus, Platonist, Stoic, and Roman\\", in The Sleep of Reason: Erotic Experience and Sexual Ethics in Ancient Greece and Rome (University of Chicago Press, 2002), p. 305, noting that custom \\"allowed much latitude for personal negotiation and gradual social change\\"; Elaine Fantham, \\"Stuprum: Public Attitudes and Penalties for Sexual Offences in Republican Rome\\", in Roman Readings: Roman Response to Greek Literature from Plautus to Statius and Quintilian (Walter de Gruyter, 2011), p. 124, citing Papinian, De adulteriis I and Modestinus, Liber Regularum I. Eva Cantarella, Bisexuality in the Ancient World (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. 104; Catherine Edwards, The Politics of Immorality in Ancient Rome (Cambridge University Press, 2002), pp. 34‚Äì35. Roman law recognized rape as a crime in which the victim bore no guilt.Ariadne Staples, From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion (Routledge, 1998), pp. 81‚Äì82Gardner, pp. 118ff. Roman law also recognized rape committed against males. Rape was a capital crime. As a matter of law, however, rape could be committed only against a citizen in good standing. There was no crime of marital rape, and the rape of a slave could be prosecuted only as damage to her owner's property.Under the Lex Aquilia;McGinn (1998), p. 314Gardner, p. 119. Most prostitutes in ancient Rome were slaves, though some slaves were protected from forced prostitution by a clause in their sales contract.McGinn (1998), pp. 288ff. Working as a prostitute or entertainer made a woman subject to infamis, on the basis that by making her body publicly available, she had in effect surrendered her right to be protected from sexual abuse or physical violence.Gardner, p. 119McGinn (1998), p. 326. Byzantine law Since Byzantine law was essentially based on Roman law, the legal status of women did not change significantly from the practices of the 6th century. But the traditional restriction of women in the public life as well as the hostility against independent women still continued. Greater influence of Greek culture contributed to strict attitudes about women's roles being domestic instead of being public. There was also a growing tend of women who were not prostitutes, slaves or entertainers to be entirely veiled. Like previous Roman law, women could not be legal witnesses, hold administrations or run banking but they could still inherit properties and own land. As a rule the influence of the church was exercised in favor of the abolition of the disabilities imposed by the older law upon celibacy and childlessness, of increased facilities for entering a professed religious life, and of due provision for the wife. The church also supported the political power of those who were friendly toward the clergy. The appointment of mothers and grandmothers as tutors was sanctioned by Justinian. The restrictions on the marriage of senators and other men of high rank with women of low rank were extended by Constantine, but it was almost entirely removed by Justinian. Second marriages were discouraged, especially by making it legal to impose a condition that a widow's right to property should cease on remarriage, and the Leonine Constitutions at the end of the 9th century made third marriages punishable. The same constitutions made the benediction of a priest a necessary part of the ceremony of marriage. The criminal law also changed its perspectives on women. Adultery was punished with death by Constantine, but the penalty was reduced by Justinian to banishment to a convent. A woman condemned for adultery could not remarry. A marriage between a Christian and a Jew rendered the parties guilty of adultery. Severe laws were enacted against offenses of unchastity, especially procurement and incest. It was a capital crime to carry off or offer violence to a nun. Women were subject to penalties for wearing dress or ornaments (except rings) imitating those reserved for the emperor and his family. Actresses and women of bad fame were not to wear the dress of virgins dedicated to Heaven. If a consul had a wife or mother living with him, he was allowed to incur greater expense than if he lived alone. The interests of working women were protected by enactments for the regulation of the gynoecia, or workshops for spinning, dyeing, etc. The canon law, looking with disfavor on the female independence prevailing in the later Roman law, tended rather in the opposite direction. The Decretum Gratiani specially inculcated subjection of the wife to the husband, and obedience to his will in all things. The chief differences between canon and Roman law were in the law of marriage, especially in the introduction of publicity and of the formalities of the ring. The benediction of a priest was made a necessary part of the ceremony, as indeed it had been made by the civil power, as has been already stated, in the post-Justinian period of Roman law. Islamic law In the early Middle Ages, an early effort to improve the status of women occurred during the early reforms under Islam, when women were given greater rights in marriage, divorce, and inheritance.Esposito (2005) p. 79 The Oxford Dictionary of Islam states that the general improvement of the status of Arab women included prohibition of female infanticide and recognizing women's full personhood.Esposito (2004), p. 339 \\"The dowry, previously regarded as a bride- price paid to the father, became a nuptial gift retained by the wife as part of her personal property.\\"Khadduri (1978) Under Islamic law, marriage was no longer viewed as a \\"status\\" but rather as a \\"contract\\", in which the woman's consent was imperative. Married women's property, including land, was held by them in their own names and did not become in any way, shape, or form, the property of their husbands by marriage, a major difference from laws in most of Europe until the modern era. \\"Women were given inheritance rights in a patriarchal society that had previously restricted inheritance to male relatives.\\" Annemarie Schimmel states that \\"compared to the pre-Islamic position of women, Islamic legislation meant an enormous progress; the woman has the right, at least according to the letter of the law, to administer the wealth she has brought into the family or has earned by her own work.\\"Schimmel (1992) p. 65 English Common Law transferred property held by a wife at the time of a marriage to her husband, which contrasted with the Sura: \\"Unto men (of the family) belongs a share of that which Parents and near kindred leave, and unto women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it be a little or much ‚Äì a determinate share\\" (Qur'an 4:7), albeit maintaining that husbands were solely responsible for the maintenance and leadership of his wife and family. Education Islam made the education of women a sacred obligation\\"The Women of Islam,\\" TIME, Lisa Beyer, 25 Nov. 2001 Women, far from being barred from study of Islam's holy book, were urged to learn to read it as were men. Women in Islam played an important role in the foundations of many Islamic educational institutions, such as Fatima al- Fihri's founding of the University of Al Karaouine in 859. This continued through to the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th and 13th centuries, when 160 mosques and madrasahs were established in Damascus, 26 of which were funded by women through the Waqf (charitable trust or trust law) system. Half of all the royal patrons for these institutions were also women. According to the Sunni scholar Ibn Asakir in the 12th century, there were opportunities for female education in the medieval Islamic world, writing that women could study, earn ijazahs (academic degrees), and qualify as scholars and teachers. This was especially the case for learned and scholarly families, who wanted to ensure the highest possible education for both their sons and daughters. Ibn Asakir had himself studied under 80 different female teachers in his time. Female education in the Islamic world was inspired by Muhammad's wives: Khadijah, a successful businesswoman, and Aisha, a renowned hadith scholar and military leader. According to a hadith attributed to Muhammad, he praised the women of Medina because of their desire for religious knowledge: While it was not common for women to enroll as students in formal classes, it was common for women to attend informal lectures and study sessions at mosques, madrasahs and other public places. While there were no legal restrictions on female education, some men did not approve of this practice, such as Muhammad ibn al- Hajj (d. 1336) who was appalled at the behaviour of some women who informally audited lectures in his time: Employment Women under Islamic law could enter into contracts, buy and sell property, sue in court on their own behalf without the need for a man to represent them, engage in commerce, endow trusts, etc., the same as a man. The labor force in the Caliphate were employed from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, while both men and women were involved in diverse occupations and economic activities.Shatzmiller, pp. 6‚Äì7. Women were employed in a wide range of commercial activities and diverse occupationsShatzmiller, pp. 400‚Äì1 in the primary sector (as farmers for example), secondary sector (as construction workers, dyers, spinners, etc.) and tertiary sector (as investors, doctors, nurses, presidents of guilds, brokers, peddlers, lenders, scholars, etc.).Shatzmiller, pp. 350‚Äì62. Muslim women also held a monopoly over certain branches of the textile industry, the largest and most specialized and market- oriented industry at the time, in occupations such as spinning, dyeing, and embroidery. In comparison, female property rights and wage labour were relatively uncommon in Europe until the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Criminal law  Female and male transgressors were treated mostly the same except some instance for example, diya or financial compensation for a crime against a female victim is half that of a male victim. A charge of adultery against a woman requires four eyewitnesses which made it difficult to prosecute. Rape, on the other hand, is a criminal assault offense which does not require four eyewitnesses as if it were a charge of adultery. However, several Muslim-majority countries have addressed rape under the rubric of adultery, requiring it to have four eyewitnesses; this has been the subject of international controversy. Women could serve as witnesses in court but her testimony worth half that of a man. As mentioned in the Quran \\"Call in to witness from among your men two witnesses; but if there are not two men, then one man and two women of such as you approve as witnesses, so that if one of the two (women) forgets, the other (woman) may remind her\\"Sura El Baqra verse:228  Divorce law  In Islamic law, men only have to utter \\"I divorce you,\\" or \\"Talaq\\" three times in the presence of his wife to officially initiate divorce; nonetheless, there is a required waiting period of three months, and if in that time the wife is discovered to be pregnant, the divorce is still not effective until after she has delivered. Women have always had the right to initiate divorce in Islamic law, but have to go to court through a judicial process and prove grounds for separation, which include cruelty, lack of provision, desertion, impotence of the husband, and other actionable grounds. Women could initiate divorce without any of those grounds by a different route called khula', a wife-initiated divorce which involved returning the mahr (dowry or bride-gift), that the husband had paid to her upon marriage. Upon any divorce initiated by the husband, the ex-wife is entitled to payment of the remainder or \\"delayed\\" portion of that mahr.  Marriage law  The Quran clearly allows polygamy up to 4 wives as mentioned: \\"And if you fear that you will not deal justly with the orphan girls, then marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then [marry only] one or those your right hand possesses. That is more suitable that you may not incline [to injustice].\\"Sura El Nisa, verse:3 The consent of the first wife before marrying another women isn't needed in Islamic laws according to the Standing Committee of fatwa.https://archive.islamonline.net/?p=823 According to an opinion within the Hanbali school of thought, the father can give his underage daughter to marriage without her consent, as Ibn Qudamah ( a Hanbali Muslim Scholar) states: \\"With regard to females, the father may give his minor, virgin daughter who has not yet reached the age of nine in marriage, and there is no difference of opinion concerning that, if he gives her in marriage to someone who is compatible. Ibn al-Mundhir said: All of those scholars from whom we acquired knowledge unanimously agreed that it is permissible for a father to give his minor daughter in marriage if he arranges her to someone who is compatible, and it is permissible for him to do that even if she is reluctant.Al Sharah El Kebir, 7/386 If the women reached mature age to have legal consent, her consent is needed in marriage, as the Prophet ordered:\\"A previously-married woman has more right concerning herself than her guardian, and the permission of a virgin should be sought (regarding marriage), and her permission is her silence\\".Narrated by Muslim:1421 However, any women must be married by the consent of her guardian unless the marriage will be invalid if her guardian disagrees as the Prophet said:\\"There should be no nikaah (marriage contract) except with a wali (guardian).\\"Narrated by al-Tirmidhi, 1101 Although Muslim men can marry women of Jewish or Christian faith, women are forbidden to marry non-Muslim men.  Russian law  By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was a patriarchal society in which women were subordinate to men and youth to their elders. Peter the Great relaxed the custom of youth subordination, but not that of women. A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent while retaining the requirement of parental permission. Only men, however, had the ability to end a marriage, by forcing their wives into nunneries. Legally, there were double standards for women. An adulterous wife could be sentenced to force labour while men who murdered their wives were merely flogged. After the death of Peter the Great, laws and customs pertaining to men's marital authority over their wives increased. In 1782, civil law reinforced women's responsibility to obey her husband. By 1832, the Digest of laws changed this obligation into \\"unlimited obedience\\". During the eighteenth century, the Russian Orthodox Church obtained greater authority over marriage and banned priests from giving divorce, even for severely abused wives. By 1818, the Russian Senate had also forbade separation of married couples. Russian women suffered restrictions upon their owning property until 1753, when there was a decree, which ensured that noble families could secure a daughter's inheritance by making it a part of her dowry. This decree also ensured that women had a separate economy from their husbands, although they could not inherit their property until they married. Women's rights had improved after the rise of the Soviet Union under the Bolsheviks.  Europe  By 1500, Europe was divided into two types of secular law. One was customary law which was predominant in northern France, England and Scandinavia, and the other was Roman based written law which was predominant in southern France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. Customary laws favoured men more than women. For example, inheritance among the elites in Italy, England, Scandinavia and France was passed on to the eldest male heir. In all of the regions, the laws also gave men substantial powers over lives, property and bodies of their wives. However, there were some improvements for women vis-√†-vis ancient custom for example they could inherit in the absence of their brothers, do certain trades without their husbands and widows to receive dower. In areas governed by Roman-based written laws women were under male guardianship in matters involving property and law, fathers overseeing daughters, husbands overseeing wives and uncles or male relatives overseeing widows. Throughout Europe, women's legal status centred around her marital status while marriage itself was the biggest factor in restricting women's autonomy. Custom, statue and practice not only reduced women's rights and freedoms but prevented single or widowed women from holding public office on the justification that they might one day marry.  Northern and Western European laws = Scandinavia  The early law of the northern parts of Europe is interesting from the different ways in which it treated women. The position of women varied greatly. In Pagan Scandinavia prior to the introduction of Christianity, women in Scandinavia had a relatively free and independent position.Borgstr√∂m Eva : Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : genderbenders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. (inb.). Libris 8707902. Christianity arrived with the first missionaries in circa 800 AC, but was not victorious until circa 1000, and did not affect women's position much until circa 1200. During the Viking Age, women had a relatively free status in the Nordic countries of Sweden, Denmark and Norway, illustrated in the Icelandic Gr√°g√°s and the Norwegian Frostating laws and Gulating laws.Borgstr√∂m Eva : Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. (inb.). Libris 8707902. The paternal aunt, paternal niece and paternal granddaughter, referred to as odalkvinna, all had the right to inherit property from a deceased man. In the absence of male relatives, an unmarried woman with no son could, further more, inherit not only property, but also the position as head of the family from a deceased father or brother: a woman with such status was referred to as ringkvinna, and she exercised all the rights afforded to the head of a family clan, such as for example the right to demand and receive fines for the slaughter of a family member, unless she married, by which her rights were transferred to her husband. After the age of 20, an unmarried woman, referred to as maer and mey, reached legal majority and had the right to decide of her place of residence and was regarded as her own person before the law. An exception to her independence was the right to choose a marriage partner, as marriages were normally arranged by the clan.Borgstr√∂m Eva: Makal√∂sa kvinnor: k√∂ns√∂verskridare i myt och verklighet (Marvelous women : gender benders in myth and reality) Alfabeta/Anamma, Stockholm 2002. (inb.). Libris 8707902. Widows enjoyed the same independent status as unmarried women. Women had religious authority and were active as priestesses (gydja) and oracles (sejdkvinna);Ingelman-Sundberg, Catharina, Forntida kvinnor: j√§gare, vikingahustru, pr√§stinna [Ancient women: hunters, viking wife, priestess], Prisma, Stockholm, 2004 they were active within art as poets (skalder) and rune masters, and as merchants and medicine women. They may also have been active within military office: the stories about shieldmaidens is unconfirmed, but some archaeological finds such as the Birka female Viking warrior may indicate that at least some women in military authority existed. A married woman could divorce her husband and remarry.Ohlander, Ann-Sofie & Str√∂mberg, Ulla-Britt, Tusen svenska kvinno√•r: svensk kvinnohistoria fr√•n vikingatid till nutid, 3. (A Thousand Swedish Women's Years: Swedish Women's History from the Viking Age until now), [omarb. och ut√∂k.] uppl., Norstedts akademiska f√∂rlag, Stockholm, 2008 It was also socially acceptable for a free woman to cohabit with a man and have children with him without marrying him, even if that man was married: a woman in such a position was called frilla. There was no distinction made between children born inside or outside of marriage: both had the right to inherit property after their parents, and there was no \\"legitimate\\" or \\"illegitimate\\" children. These liberties gradually disappeared after the introductions of Christianity, and from the late 13th-century, they are no longer mentioned. During the Christian Middle Ages, the Medieval Scandinavian law applied different laws depending of the local county law, signifying that the status of women could vary depending of which county she was living in. Sweden was given its first attempt of a national code by the Magnus Erikssons landslag in 1350. In medieval Christian Sweden, properties owned by the wife was merged into her husband's household and transferred under his care. This was similar to other countries within Europe where property was female property forfeited to the male during their marriage. So all the properties of the wife was managed by the husband and could be freely alienated unless it was her kinsman's inheritance which was an exception. By law, both sons and daughters could inherit properties but the sons would get double the amount that of the daughter. The Swedish law protected women from the authority of their husbands by transferring the authority to their male relatives. A wife's property and land also could not be taken by the husband without her family's consent but neither could the wife. This mean a woman could not transfer her property to her husband without her family or kinsman's consent either. Under the Civil Code of Christian V from 1683, the law of Denmark-Norway defined and unmarried female under the guardianship of her closest male relative regardless of her age, while a married woman was under the couverture of her husband. The same law terms was applied in Sweden-Finland in accordance with the Civil Code of 1734. Both the Civil Code of 1683 in the case of Denmark-Norway, and the Civil Code of 1734 in the case of Sweden-Finland, remained in place more or less unaltered until the mid 19th-century. Ireland Ancient Irish laws generally portray a patriarchal and patrilineal society in which the rules of inheritance were based on agnatic descent. The Brehon law excepted women from the ordinary course of the law. They could distrain or contract only in certain named cases, and distress upon their property was regulated by special rules. In general, every woman had to have a male guardian. Women seem not to have been entitled to the slightest possession of land under the Brehon law, but rather had assigned to them a certain number of their father's cattle as their marriage-portion. However, their legal status was not as low as in some other cultures; and it seems that the status of Irish women improved somewhat with time, especially after the introduction of Christianity. For instance, beginning in the eighth century, female heirs inherited real estate if they had no brothers. These women became known as \\"heiresses\\" and, while only a small minority of women living at this time, they could exercise a considerable amount of political and legal influence. If an heiress married a landless husband, she was seen as his legal guardian, leading to a very unusual case of complete gender role reversal. However, most women did not own land and remained more or less dependent on their husbands; under the ancient Brehon laws one could not be counted as a free citizen unless one owned land independently. The holding of political offices, similarly, seems to have been only suitable for men; nowhere in Irish historical tracts is any female High Queen or chieftain mentioned, and warfare and political affairs were generally all-male. However in the late 17th century there are numerous accounts in Burke's Peerage of women inheritimg noble estates and or men inheriting via female lines. These heiresses were English and increasingly more Irish families. Even with these legal restrictions placed upon women, they retained some legal capacity. The arrival of St. Patrick and the introduction of Christian Roman law affected the medieval Irish view of marriage. By the eighth century, the preferred form of marriage was one between social equals, under which a woman was technically legally dependent on her husband and had half his honor price, but could exercise considerable authority in regard to the transfer of property. Such women were called \\"women of joint dominion\\". Adult sons appear to have gained rights under the new Christian laws as well, as surviving texts seem to indicate that sons could impugn bad contracts that would harm his inheritance. Daughters, however, continued to have little or no legal independence, although after the eighth century they could no longer be forced into marriage by their parents. England In about 60 AD, Boudica, a Celtic queen in East Anglia, led a nearly successful battle against the Roman Empire, seeking to preserve her daughters' rights to inherit, a right they held under pre-Roman systems, but which the Romans prohibited. England has a complex history of legal rights for women. Significant documentations of women's rights occurred after the Norman conquest of England. These documentations reversed some laws the Conquest imposed in 1066, and caused divergence with Continental, Irish and other Holy Roman Empire laws. This divergence, where England gave more rights to women, became a factor in conflict with the French and other Holy Roman Empire monarchies for centuries, including the Hundred Years' War, the attempted invasion by the Spanish Armada and the War of Austrian succession. These documentations included Magna Carta in 1215 and the 1689 Bill of Rights, which both gave rights to women that were prohibited in the Holy Roman Empire systems. Also, the reign of Elizabeth I from 1558‚Äì1603 was significant in its visible and successful assertion of rights of single women to inherit property, to earn money, to exercise agency, and otherwise function as legal actors equivalent to single or married men; these rights contrasted with Holy Roman Empire legal constraints on women and were a significant factor in The English Reformation and English Midlands Enlightenment. These rights continued to be suspended for many married women, however, who in many regions of England remained under legal disability during marriage under common laws of Coverture that traced from the Norman Conquest. England was one of the first places in the world to grant voting rights to women citizens universally and regardless of marital status, which it did by passage of the 1918 Representation of the People Act that gave voting rights to women aged 30 years and over who met a property qualification (equal voting rights with men was achieved a decade later under the Equal Franchise Act 1928, which permitted all women aged 21 and over to vote). Several centuries earlier, some of its colonies in North America, including New Jersey Colony by its constitution, had granted voting rights to women who could meet the same property requirements men had to meet; common laws of Coverture requiring a married woman's property to be held by her husband meant married women typically could not qualify. Prior to the Norman Conquest in 1066, the laws varied by the separate regions in England. The laws of Athelstan contained a peculiarly brutal provision for the punishment of a female slave convicted of theft: She was to be burned alive by eighty other female slaves.[Is this different than the treatment a male slave would have received?] >Other laws were directed against the practice of witchcraft by women. Burning was the punishment specially appropriated to women convicted of treason or witchcraft. A case of sentence to execution by burning for treason occurred as late as 1789.Burning at the Stake ‚Äì Capital Punishment UK [Again, is this treatment different for women than for men convicted of treason?] Monogamy was enforced both by the civil and ecclesiastical law [for women? for men? in what time period and region?]. Second and third marriages involved penance. A glimpse of cruelty in the household is afforded by the provision, occurring no less than three times in the ecclesiastical legislation, that if a woman scourged her female slave to death, she must do penance. Traces of wife-purchase were still seen in the law of √Üthelberht of Kent, which stated that if a man carried off a freeman's wife, he must, at his own expense, procure another wife for the husband. (See also bride kidnapping.) The codes contain few provisions as to the property of married women, but those few appear to prove that they were in a better position than at later dates. The development of the bride price no doubt was in the same direction. It was the sum paid by the husband to the wife's family for the purchase of part of the family property, while the morning-gift was paid to the bride herself. In its English form, morning-gift occurs in the laws of Canute; in its Latinized form of morgangiva, it occurs in the Leges Henrici Primi. The old common and statute law of England placed women in a special position. A woman was exempt from legal duties more particularly attaching to men and not performable by a deputy. She could not hold a proper feud, i.e., one of which the tenure was by military service. The same principle appears in the rule that she could not be endowed of a castle maintained for the defense of the realm and not for the private use of the owner. She could receive homage, but not render it in the form used by men. She could be the constable, either of a castle or a vill, but not the sheriff, except in the one case of Westmorland, where an hereditary office was exercised in the 17th century by Anne, countess of Dorset, Pembroke and Montgomery. In certain cases a woman could transmit rights that she could not enjoy. Edward III's claim to the crown of France rested on such a power of transmission. However, the claim was a breach of the French constitutional law, which rejected the claim of a woman. By Magna Carta, widow's rights to property were protected, in sharp contrast to the Salic law, but a woman could not accuse a man of murder except of that of her husband. This disability no doubt arose from the fact that in trial by battle she naturally did not appear in person but through a champion. In some old statutes, very curious sumptuary regulations as to women's dress occur. By the sumptuary laws of Edward III in 1363 (37 Edw. III, cc. 8‚Äì14), women were, in general, to be dressed according to the position of their fathers or husbands. At the times of passing these sumptuary laws, the trade interests of women were protected by the legislature. In some cases, the wives and daughters of tradesmen were allowed to assist in the trades of their husbands and fathers. Some trading corporations, such as the East India Company, recognized no distinction of sex in their members. At common law a woman could own both real and personal property. However, in the case of a married woman the husband had a life interest in any real property: this continued even after the wife's death, and was known as tenancy \\"by the curtesy\\". Personal property passed into the ownership of the husband absolutely, with the exception of certain items of adornment or household use known as paraphernalia. Upon marriage, all of the wife's property becomes under the hands of her husband even if it was her family inheritance. Any money the wife earned through labour or trade also ended up in the hands of her husband whom she was expected to obey in the custom of marriage at the time. Domestic violence was also tolerated in historical England as long as it did not disturb public peace. A husband or master is legally entitled to beat and restrain his wife, child or servant as long as he did not kill them and disturb public peace. Husbands were also entitled to unrestricted access to his wife's body until the late 20th century where the concept of marital rape was recognized and criminalized.  Scotland  In Scotland, as early as Regiam Majestatem (14th century), women were the object of special legal regulation. In that work, the mercheta mulieris (probably a tax paid to the lord on the marriage of his tenant's daughter) was fixed at a sum differing according to the rank of the woman. Numerous ancient laws dealt with trade and sumptuary matters. It still survives on the island of Ulva. By the Leges Quatuor Burgorum, female brewsters making bad ale were to forfeit eightpence and be put on the cucking- stool, and were to set an ale-wand outside their houses under a penalty of fourpence. The same laws also provided that a married woman committing a trespass without her husband's knowledge might be chastised like an under-age child. Wales The second part of the Welsh Law Codes begins with \\"the laws of women\\", such as the rules governing marriage and the division of property if a married couple should separate. The position of women under Welsh law differed significantly from that of their Norman-English contemporaries. A marriage could be established in two basic ways. The normal way was that the woman would be given to a man by her kindred; the abnormal way was that the woman could elope with a man without the consent of her kindred. In the latter case, her kindred could compel her to return if she was still a virgin, but if she was not, she could not be compelled to return. If the relationship lasted for seven years, she had the same entitlements as if she had been given by her kin. A number of payments are connected with marriage. Amobr was a fee payable to the woman's lord on the loss of her virginity, whether on marriage or otherwise. Cowyll was a payment due to the woman from her husband on the morning after the marriage, marking her transition from virgin to married woman. Agweddi was the amount of the common pool of property owned by the couple that was due to the woman if the couple separated before the end of seven years. The total of the agweddi depended on the woman's status by birth, regardless of the actual size of the common pool of property. If the marriage broke up after the end of seven years, the woman was entitled to half the common pool. If a woman found her husband with another woman, she was entitled to a payment of six score pence the first time and a pound the second time; on the third occasion she was entitled to divorce him. If the husband had a concubine, the wife was allowed to strike her without having to pay any compensation, even if it resulted in the concubine's death. A woman could only be beaten by her husband for three things: for giving away something that she was not entitled to give away, for being found with another man, or for wishing a blemish on her husband's beard. If he beat her for any other cause, she was entitled to the payment of sarhad. If the husband found her with another man and beat her, he was not entitled to any further compensation. Women were not allowed to inherit land, except under special circumstances, but the rule for the division of moveable property when one of a married couple died was the same for both sexes. The property was divided into two equal halves, with the surviving partner keeping one half and the dying partner being free to give bequests from the other half. Edwardian Era laws In 1911, under English law, the earliest age at which a girl could contract a valid marriage was 12; boys had to be 14. Under the lnfants Settlement Act 1855, a valid settlement could be made by a woman at 17 with the approval of the court, while the age for a man was 20; by the Married Women's Property Act 1907, any settlement by a husband of his wife's property was not valid unless executed by her if she was of full age, or confirmed by her after she attained full age. An unmarried woman was liable for the support of illegitimate children till they attain the age of 16. She was generally assisted, in the absence of agreement, by an affiliation order granted by magistrates. A married woman having separate property was, under the Married Women's Property Acts 1882 and 1908, liable for the support of her parents, husband, children and grandchildren becoming chargeable to any union or parish. In common law, the father, rather than the mother, was entitled to the custody of a legitimate child up to the age of 16, and could only forfeit such right by misconduct. But the Court of Chancery, wherever there was trust property and the infant could be made a ward of court, took a less rigid view of the paternal rights and looked more to the interest of the child, and consequently in some cases to the extension of the mother's rights in common law. Legislation tended in the same direction. By the Custody of Infants Act 1873, the Court of Chancery was empowered to enforce a provision in a separation deed, giving up the custody or control of a child to the mother. The Judicature Act 1873 enacted that, in questions relating to the custody and education of infants, the rules of equity should prevail. The most remarkable disabilities under which women were still placed in 1910 were the exclusion of female heirs from succession to real estate, except in the absence of a male heir; and the fact that a husband could obtain a divorce for the adultery of his wife, while a wife could obtain it only for her husband's adultery if coupled with some other cause, such as cruelty or desertion. Almost all existing disabilities were lifted by the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919.  Spain and Aquitania  Until the imposition of the Salic Law in the 1500s, in Spain and Southern France, those regions part of the Visigothic Kingdom (418‚Äì721) and its various successor states (Asturias, Le√≥n, Castile, Navarra, Aragon, Aquitania (Occitania) and Languedoc) Visigothic Law and Roman Law combined to allow women some rights. Particularly with the Liber Judiciorum as codified 642/643 and expanded on in the Code of Recceswinth in 653, women could inherit land and title and manage it independently from their husbands or male relations, dispose of their property in legal wills if they had no heirs, and women could represent themselves and bear witness in court by age 14 and arrange for their own marriages by age 20.Klapisch-Zuber, Christine; A History of Women: Book II Silences of the Middle Ages, The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London, England. 1992, 2000 (5th printing). Chapter 6, \\"Women in the Fifth to the Tenth Century\\" by Suzanne Fonay Wemple, pg 74. According to Wemple, Visigothic women of Spain and the Aquitaine could inherit land and title and manage it independently of their husbands, and dispose of it as they saw fit if they had no heirs, and represent themselves in court, appear as witnesses (by the age of 14), and arrange their own marriages by the age of twenty In Spain these laws were further codified between 1252‚Äì1284 by Alfonso X of Castile with the Siete Partidas. These laws would later be reversed by imposition of the Salic Law to prohibit women inheriting property. For example, the Salic law was imposed to prohibit the daughters of Isabella I of Castile from inheriting in Aragon. Today the Spanish throne is inherited by Male-preference cognatic primogeniture.  Argentinian colonial law  Colonial Argentina in the 16th century was mixed with women from Spanish descent, indigenous descent or mixed. As descendants of the colonizers, Spanish women had greater status than that of indigenous women at the time. But women regardless of racial background had restrictions in her autonomy in society for example her main social role was confined to home and family while attending domestic duties such as taking care of children. Colonial Argentina being catholic was heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church who promoted a patriarchal family structure. Despite this, women had several positive rights such as equal inheritance as her siblings.  Chinese law  Women throughout historical and ancient China were considered inferior and had subordinate legal status based on the Confucian law. In Imperial China, the \\"Three Obediences\\" promoted daughters to obey their fathers, wives to obey their husbands and widows to obey their sons. Women could not inherit businesses or wealth and man had to adopt a son for such financial purposes. Late imperial law also features seven different types of divorces. A wife could be ousted if she failed to birth a son, committed adultery, disobeyed her parent's in law, spoke excessively, stole, received bouts of jealousy or suffered from an incurable or loathsome disease or disorder. Nevertheless, there were also limits for the husband like for example he could not divorce if she observed her parent's in law's mourning sites, if she had no family to return to or if the husband's family used to be poor and since then have become richer.  Japanese law  Women's legal status in historical Japan was relatively better especially compared to its neighbour China until the fall of the Kamakura Shuganate in 1333. Women lost the right to inherit land, and centuries of violence by government and military class in post 1582, Japan became a normative patriarchy similar to the rest of its neighbouring civilizations. Women's legal and customary condition worsened after 1890 as it modernized its legal codes based on French and German systems, but significantly improved after post-war 1947.  Indian law  For the majority of history, Indians used their Hindu legal code as a basis for their rights and customs. Hindu legal code is based on the religious texts known as the dharmasatras. The most orthodox form of the dharmasatras was the Manu Smriti which was used prevalently during the colonial period. Manu Smriti protected women's property rights as well as rights to inheritance.But it is also insisted that women is placed under a male guardianship at all times such as father from birth, husband in marriage and sons as a widow. Aside from property rights, Hindu legal code did not grant women too many rights but fortunately interpretation of the code was very fluid depending on the local customs. Judgement and interpretation of the code was executed by local councils called the panchayats which composed of mostly male village elders but women were not always excluded. This local system fared women better than the normative Hindu code but this was reversed during colonial Anglo-Indian judiciary. The colonial takeover by the British during the 17th and 18th century had more negative than positive effects on women's rights in the Indian subcontinent. Although they managed to outlaw widow burning, female infanticide and improve age of consent, scholars agree that overall women's legal rights and freedoms were restricted during this period. The British abolished local custom laws in favor of separate religious codes for Hindus and Muslims which had harsher treatment of women. These religious codes lead to women having poorer rights when it came to landholding, inheritance, divorce, marriage and maintenance.

Most of his notable work was accomplished at a young age, in the years 1886 through 1897. He is also associated with Cloisonnism and Synthetism, two late 19th-century art movements. Less known is Bernard's literary work, comprising plays, poetry, and art criticism as well as art historical statements that contain first-hand information on the crucial period of modern art to which Bernard had contributed. Biography √âmile Bernard by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1886) √âmile Henri Bernard was born in Lille, France in 1868. As in his younger years his sister was sick, √âmile was unable to receive much attention from his parents; he therefore stayed with his grandmother, who owned a laundry in Lille, employing more than twenty people. She was one of the greatest supporters of his art. The family moved to Paris in 1878, where √âmile attended the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe. Education He began his studies at the √âcole des Arts D√©coratifs. In 1884, joined the Atelier Cormon where he experimented with impressionism and pointillism and befriended fellow artists Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. After being suspended from the √âcole des Beaux-Arts for \\"showing expressive tendencies in his paintings\\", he toured Brittany on foot, where he was enamored by the tradition and landscape. In August 1886, Bernard met Gauguin in Pont-Aven. In this brief meeting, they exchanged little about art, but looked forward to meeting again. Bernard said, looking back on that time, that \\"my own talent was already fully developed.\\" He believed that his style did play a considerable part in the development of Gauguin's mature style. 1887‚Äì1888 Bernard spent September 1887 at the coast, where he painted La Grandm√®re, a portrait of his grandmother. He continued talking with other painters and started saying good things about Gauguin. Bernard went back to Paris, attended Acad√©mie Julian,Russell, John. \\"An Art School That Also Taught Life,\\" New York Times. 19 March 1989 met with van Gogh, who as we already stated was impressed by his work, found a restaurant to show the work alongside van Gogh, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec's work at the Avenue Clichy. Van Gogh called the group the School of Petit-Boulevard. One year later, Bernard set out for Pont-Aven by foot and saw Gauguin. Their friendship and artistic relationship grew strong quickly. By this time Bernard had developed many theories about his artwork and what he wanted it to be. He stated that he had \\"a desire to [find] an art that would be of the most extreme simplicity and that would be accessible to all, so as not to practice its individuality, but collectively...\\" Gauguin was impressed by Bernard's ability to verbalize his ideas. 1888 was a seminal year in the history of Modern art. From 23 October until 23 December Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh worked together in Arles. Gauguin had brought his new style from Pont- Aven exemplified in Vision after the Sermon: Jacob Wrestling with the Angel, a powerful work of visual symbolism of which he had already sent a sketch to van Gogh in September.

He also brought along Bernard's Le Pardon de Pont-Aven which he had exchanged for one of his paintings and which he used to decorate the shared workshop. see in: (ref. Druick 2001) This work was equally striking and illustrative of the style √âmile Bernard had already acquainted van Gogh with when he sent him a batch of drawings in August, so much so that van Gogh made a watercolor copy of the Pardon (December 1888) which he sent to his brother, to recommend Bernard's new style to be promoted. The following year van Gogh still vividly remembered the painting in his written portrait of √âmile Bernard in a letter to his sister Wil (10 December 1889):\\"...it was so original I absolutely wanted to have a copy.\\" Bernard's style was effective and coherent (see:woman at haystacks,) as can also be seen from the comparison of the two \\"portraits\\" Bernard and Gauguin sent to van Gogh at the end of September 1888 at the latter's request: self-portraits -at Gauguin's initiative- each integrating a small portrait of the other in the background. (ref. Druick 2001) One of √âmile Bernard's drawings from the August batch (\\"...a lane of trees near the sea with two women talking in the foreground and some strollers\\" ‚Äì Vincent van Gogh in a letter to Bernard ‚Äì Arles 1888) also appears to have inspired the work van Gogh and Gauguin did on the All√©e des Alyscamps in Arles. In 1891 he joined a group of Symbolist painters that included Odilon Redon and Ferdinand Hodler. In 1893 he started traveling, to Egypt, Spain and Italy and after that his style became more eclectic. He returned to Paris in 1904 and remained there for the remainder of his life. He taught at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts before he died in 1941. ::\\"[...] this creative, avant-garde young man destroyed himself in a fight against that same avant-garde he had helped to create. His rivalry with Gauguin led him out of spite along a different path: classicism. This change took place when he was living in the Middle East, in a period of great crisis. But the fact remains that the young Bernard played an essential part as an initiator for Gauguin, and that he was the inventor of a new artistic vision.\\" Theories on style and art: Cloisonnism and Symbolism Poster of the 1889 Exhibition of Paintings by the Impressionist and Synthetist Group, at Caf√© des Arts, known as The Volpini Exhibition, 1889. Bernard theorized a style of painting with bold forms separated by dark contours which became known as cloisonnism. His work showed geometric tendencies which hinted at influences of Paul C√©zanne, and he collaborated with Paul Gauguin and Vincent van Gogh. Many say that it was Bernard's friend Anquetin, who should receive the credit for this \\"closisonisme\\" technique. During the spring of 1887, Bernard and Anquetin \\"turned against Neo-Impressionism.\\" It is also likely that Bernard was influenced by the works he had seen of C√©zanne. But Bernard says \\"When I was in Brittany, I was inspired by \\"everything that is superfluous in a spectacle is covering it with reality and occupying our eyes instead of our mind. You have to simplify the spectacle in order to make some sense of it. You have, in a way, to draw its plan.\\" \\"The first means that I use is to simplify nature to an extreme point. I reduce the lines only to the main contrasts and I reduce the colors to the seven fundamental colors of the prism. To see a style and not an item. To highlight the abstract sense and not the objective. And the second means were to appeal to the conception and to the memory by extracting yourself from any direct atmosphere. Appeal more to internal memory and conception. There I was expressing myself more, it was me that I was describing, although I was in front of the nature. There was an invisible meaning under the mute shape of exteriority.\\" Symbolism and religious motifs appear in both Bernard and Gauguin's work. During the summer of 1889, Bernard was alone in Le Pouldu and began to paint many religious canvasses. He was upset that he had to do commercial work at the same time that he wanted to create these pieces. Bernard wrote about his relationship with the style of symbolism in many letters, articles, and statements. He said that it was of a Christian essence, divine language. Bernard believed that it \\"It is the invisible express by the visible,\\" and those previous attempts of religious symbolism failed. That period of symbolism represented the nature of beauty, but did not find the truth in the beauty. Art until the renaissance was based on the invisible rather than the visible, the idea, not the shapes or concrete. The history of the painting of symbols was spiritual. Everything, meaning symbols, were forgotten with the paganist ideas and doctrines. That is what Bernard was attempting to accomplish with the rebirth of symbolism in 1890. In his idea of the new symbolism, he concentrated on maintaining a grounded art, more authentic in Bernard's mind meant reducing impressionism, not creating an optical trip like Georges-Pierre Seurat, but simplifying the actual symbol. His concept was that through ideas, not technique, the truth is found. Influence It was always √âmile Bernard's great frustration that Paul Gauguin never mentioned him as an influence on pictorial symbolism (see for instance his own notes attached to the Belgian edition (1942) of his selected letters, published shortly after his death). In 2001/2002 The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam held a joint exhibition:Van Gogh and Gauguin:The Workshop of the South that put √âmile Bernard's contribution in perspective. (ref. Druick 2001) One of √âmile Bernard's students was the Swedish painter Ivan Agu√©li. Works File:Bernard-ArbreJaune- Rennes.JPGYellow Tree, 1888.

Despite making key advances in theoretical physics, including the exchange particle model of fundamental forces, causal S-matrix theory, and the renormalization group, his idiosyncratic style and publication in minor journals led to his work being unrecognized until the mid-1990s. Early life Born into a semi-aristocratic family in Basel in 1905,Biographical details based on \\"An overview of Stueckelberg's Life as a Scientist\\" by Wanders, G√©rard in Lacki, Jan, Ruegg, Henri, Wanders, G√©rard (eds.), E.C.G. Stueckelberg, An Unconventional Figure of Twentieth Century Physics (2009). Stueckelberg's father was a lawyer, and his paternal grandfather a distinguished Swiss artist. A highly gifted school student, Stueckelberg initially began a physics degree at the University of Basel in 1923. Career While still a student, Stueckelberg was invited by the distinguished quantum theorist Arnold Sommerfeld, to attend his lectures at the University of Munich. He went on to gain a Ph.D. on cathode physics in 1927. Later that year he went to Princeton University, becoming an assistant professor in 1930. He was elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1931. He returned to Switzerland in 1932, working first at the University of Basel before switching the following year to the University of Zurich. In 1934 he moved again to the University of Geneva, which together with the University of Lausanne became his principal bases for the rest of his career. Stueckelberg's sojourn in Zurich led to contact with leading quantum theorists Wolfgang Pauli and Gregor Wentzel, which in turn led him to focus on the emerging theory of elementary particles. In 1934 he devised a fully Lorentz- covariant perturbation theory for quantum fields.E. C. G. Stueckelberg, \\"Relativistisch invariante St√∂rungstheorie des Diracschen Elektrons,\\" Ann. d. Phys. 21 (1934), pp. 367-389 and 744.arXiv:physics/9903023 The approach proposed by Stueckelberg was very powerful, but was not adopted by others at the time, and has now been all but forgotten. However, besides being explicitly covariant, Stueckelberg's methods avoid vacuum bubbles.\\"The search for a quantum field theory\\" Stueckelberg developed the vector boson exchange model as the theoretical explanation of the strong nuclear force in 1935. Discussions with Pauli led Stueckelberg to drop the idea, however. It was rediscovered by Hideki Yukawa, who won a Nobel Prize for his work in 1949 ‚Äî the first of several Nobel Prizes awarded for work which Stueckelberg contributed to, without recognition.Discussion in The Second Creation: Makers of the Revolution in Twentieth Century Physics by Crease, R, Mann, C Macmillan: 1996. In 1938 Stueckelberg recognized that massive electrodynamics contains a hidden scalar, and formulated an affine version of what would become known as the Abelian Higgs mechanism.Stueckelberg, Helvetica Physica Acta Vol. 11, 1938, pp. 299‚Äì312. He also proposed the law of conservation of baryon number. The evolution parameter theory he presented in 1941 and 1942 is the basis for recent work in relativistic dynamics. In 1941 he proposed the interpretation of the positron as a positive energy electron traveling backward in time.Stueckelberg, Helvetica Physica Acta, Vol. 14, 1941, pp. 51-80 In 1943 he came up with a renormalization program to attack the problems of infinities in quantum electrodynamics (QED), but his paper was rejected by the Physical Review. In 1952 he proved the principle of semi-detailed balance for kinetics without microscopic reversibility.Stueckelberg, E.C.G. (1952). Th√©or√®me H et unitarit√© de S. Helv. Phys.

Built in the Washington Navy Yard to the designs of Henry Steers, Shark was launched on 17 May 1821. On 11 May 1821, Matthew C. Perry was ordered to take command of Shark, and the ship was ready to receive her crew on 2 June 1821. History Shark sailed from the Washington Navy Yard on 15 July for New York, where she received Dr. Eli Ayers on board for transportation to the west coast of Africa. She cleared New York harbor on 7 August to make her first cruise for the suppression of the slave trade and piracy. Sailing by way of the Madeira, Canary, and Cape Verde islands, she landed Dr. Ayers at Sierra Leone in west Africa in October and returned by way of the West Indies to New York on 17 January 1822. Shark put to sea from New York on 26 February and joined Commodore James Biddle's squadron for the suppression of piracy and slave trading in the West Indies. On 25 March, Lt. Perry took formal possession of what is now Key West, Florida, in the name of the United States. He called the island Thompson's Island to honor Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson and named the harbor Port Rodgers to compliment Commodore John Rodgers. Under orders from Commodore Biddle, Shark departed Nassau on 14 August for another cruise to the coast of Africa and returned to Norfolk, Virginia on 12 December 1822. She again sailed for the West Indies in February 1823, and returned to New York on 9 July for repairs. On 5 October, she sailed from New York carrying Commodore John Rodgers and three Navy surgeons to Thompson's Island to determine the fitness of that place as a naval base. She debarked Rodgers and his party at Norfolk on 16 November 1823 before resuming her cruise in the West Indies. She returned to New York on 13 May 1824. After repairs in the New York Navy Yard, Shark sailed from New York on 5 October 1825 and cruised in the West Indies and the Gulf of Mexico until 29 August 1826, when she arrived at Norfolk. On 28 November she departed Norfolk and proceeded to the coast of Africa to protect slaves freed from captured slave ships. After seeing that the liberated slaves were safely established in Liberia, she returned by way of the Caribbean and arrived at New York on 5 July 1827. The busy schooner sailed again on 24 July for a cruise to the Newfoundland fisheries to defend American interests there and returned on 6 October. She then resumed her duty in the West Indies, which included anti-slavery and anti-piracy patrols and periodic voyages to West Africa to check the American settlements there. In 1833, Shark was relieved in the West Indies by the schooner, Experiment, and sailed for the Mediterranean, where she remained for the next five years, cruising extensively in order to protect American commerce. She cleared Gibraltar for the United States on 22 January 1838 and. sailing by way of the West Indies, arrived at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 24 March. Shark put to sea from Hampton Roads on 22 July 1839 for duty with the Pacific Squadron. She was the first United States man-of-war to pass through the Straits of Magellan from east to west, a feat accomplished on 13 December 1839 en route to Callao, Peru. During the next five years, she spent much of her time along the coast of Peru to protect American citizens and property during civil disturbances in that country. The Secretary of the Navy noted in 1841 that ‚Äúall who witnessed the operations of the Shark were inspired with increased respect for the American flag.‚Äù She also made infrequent cruises northward to observe conditions in Panama and to receive mail. Sinking On 1 April 1846, Shark was ordered to Honolulu, Hawaii for repairs in preparation for an exploratory voyage up the Columbia River, \\"to obtain correct information of that country and to cheer our citizens in that region by the presence of the American flag.\\" She reached the coast of Oregon on 15 July 1846, and soon crossed the bar off the mouth of the Columbia River (after grounding once on 18 July without any \\"material damage\\"), for explorations in the lower Columbia River and Willamette Valley while staging out of Fort Vancouver. After several weeks in the vicinity of the fort, the vessel returned to the mouth of the river on 8 September; and, knowing that the bar had changed position since the last survey was made, spent the following day making new observations of the bar and other preparations for crossing. However, her effort to recross the bar ended in disaster on 10 September, for she struck an uncharted shoal and was swept into the breakers by a swift tide. Shark was a total loss, but her entire crew was saved. Upon learning of the vessel's demise, the Royal Navy and Hudson's Bay Company's officers at Fort Vancouver immediately coordinated and dispatched a relief effort, including food, tobacco, and clothing. Lt. Howison soon returned to Fort Vancouver, where he acquired additional supplies and on 16 November chartered the Hudson's Bay Company schooner . She reached San Francisco, California on 27 January 1847. A court of inquiry absolved Lt. Neil M. Howison of all blame for the loss of his ship. Artifacts Several artifacts associated with the wrecked schooner are on public display in Oregon. The schooner's capstan and one carronade are on display at the Cannon Beach History Center in Cannon Beach, Oregon. The carronade was discovered four or five miles north of Arch Cape in 1898, and is what gave Cannon Beach its name. On 16 February 2008, two more carronades believed to have belonged to Shark were discovered on the beach near Arch Cape, Oregon. The newly discovered carronades were restored at the Center for Maritime Archaeology and Conservation at Texas A&M; University and are now on display at the Columbia River Maritime Museum in Astoria, Oregon. The Maritime Museum exhibit also features an officer's sword that is believed to have originated on Shark, along with a large rock known as \\"Shark Rock\\" that features words and dates believed to be etched on by survivors of the wreck.

It is the language of Assyrians originally from Sanandaj in Iranian Kurdistan. Most Senaya speakers now live in California, United States and few families still live in Tehran, Iran. They are mostly members of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Since the speakers are ethnically Assyrian, the language would be, at times, considered a dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic.  Origin, history and use today  The city of Sanandaj is at the southeastern periphery of the area of spoken modern Aramaic languages. Its geography makes the Neo-Aramaic of Sanandaj quite distinct from other dialects. Two different colloquial Aramaic dialects developed in Sanandaj: Jewish Hulaula and Christian Senaya. The two languages developed along different lines, so that the two are not mutually comprehensible. One distinctive difference between the two is the sound change associated with the Middle Aramaic fricative Œ∏ (th), often rendered as l in Hulaula, and s in Senaya. For example, m√ÆŒ∏a, 'dead', is m√Æsa in Senaya, and m√Æla in Hulaula. Most Senaya speakers are members of the Chaldean Catholic Church, which broke away from the Church of the East in the 16th century and entered into communion with the Roman Catholic Church. However, Senaya is to a small degree incomprehensible to speakers of Chaldean Neo-Aramaic, also Chaldean Catholics, originally from Iraq because of the heavy Kurdish influences on the language. In the middle of the 20th century, the Chaldean Bishop of Senna (as Sanandaj is called in Senaya) was moved to Tehran. The Christian community soon followed, so that there are no native speakers of Senaya left in Sanandaj. In Tehran, Senaya has been heavily influenced by the Urme≈ænƒÅya dialect of Assyrian Neo-Aramaic spoken by the larger Church of the East community there. Both church communities use classical Syriac in worship. Senaya is written in the MadnhƒÅy√¢ version of the Syriac alphabet, which is also used for classical Syriac. Research 1995 a research project under the leadership of Estiphan Panoussi in cooperation with Wolfhart Heinrichs granted by the Swedish Council for Research in the Humanities and Social Sciences analyzed the Senaya Dialect (Titel: The Christian Senaya Dialect on Neo- Aramaic Texts, Grammar and Dictionary). The project produced three volumes: Senaya, A Christian Neo-Aramaic Dialect (Originally in Persian Kurdistan)(400 pages). Senaya Grammar (300 pages). A Dictionary of the Neo-Aramaic Senaya Dialect (800 pages). Senaya culture The first recorded music with Senaya lyrics was released by Paul Caldani in 2002, titled Melodies of a Distant Land.

The film follows a marine salvage crew in the Bering Sea who discover a mysterious ocean liner that disappeared in 1962. The film was shot in Queensland, Australia and Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and released theatrically in North America on October 25, 2002. It received largely negative reviews from critics. It earned in excess of $68 million in box office receipts worldwide. Despite its title, the film is unrelated to the 1952 film of the same name. Plot In 1962, aboard the ocean liner SS Antonia Graza, passengers dance to the song \\"Senza Fine\\" sung by Francesca, a lounge singer. A young girl, Katie, sits alone until the ship's captain offers to dance with her. A hand presses a lever that unravels a thin wire cord from a spool. The spool snaps and the wire whips across the dance floor, bisecting the passengers and crew. Katie is spared due to her height. Forty years later, a salvage crew ‚Äî Captain Sean Murphy, Maureen Epps, Greer, Dodge, Munder, and Santos ‚Äî celebrate their recent success. Jack Ferriman, a weather service pilot, approaches them saying he spotted a vessel adrift in the Bering Sea. Because the ship is in international waters, it can be claimed by whoever brings it to port. The crew sets out on the Arctic Warrior, an ocean salvage tugboat. The ship is the Antonia Graza, which went missing decades ago. After boarding the abandoned liner, the salvagers discover nine wooden boxes, each containing twenty-eight 100-oz gold bars. After a series of supernatural events, the group decides to abandon the salvage effort and retreat with the gold, but an invisible force sabotages the Arctic Warrior. The tugboat explodes, killing Santos. With no other option, the group begins repairing the Graza. Greer encounters Francesca, who seduces him into betraying his fianc√©e, then leads him to fall down an elevator shaft, killing him. Murphy enters the captain's cabin and finds his ghost. The captain explains that they recovered the gold from a sinking cruise ship, the Lorelei, along with a sole survivor. Murphy is shown a picture of the survivor, whom he recognizes. He rushes to tell the others, but hallucinates and sees everyone as the ghost of the burned Santos, who provokes him into a murderous rage. The others think Murphy has gone mad and lock him in the drained fish tank; Epps later finds him drowned. Epps meets Katie's ghost, who reveals what happened on the Graza. The sole survivor of the Lorelei convinced many of the Graza's crew to murder the passengers, as well as the remaining crew, for the gold. After murdering the passengers through mass poisoning, shooting, and other methods, the crew turned on each other. Francesca killed the officer who survived. The mastermind behind the massacre telekinetically killed Francesca and branded her palm with a hook- shaped symbol using only his hands. The man is revealed as Jack Ferriman, who is the demonic spirit of a deceased sinner tasked with provoking people to sin, then killing them and bringing their souls to Hell. Epps deduces that Ferriman lured the salvage team to the Graza to repair it, and decides to sink it to thwart his plan. Munder is crushed to death under the ship's gears while scuba diving in the flooded engine room. Epps tells Dodge to keep Jack on the ship's bridge while she sets explosives. Ferriman taunts Dodge, mocking him as a coward for never acting on his feelings for Epps, then charges him. Dodge shoots Ferriman with a shotgun and believes Ferriman to be dead. Epps is setting explosives when she is confronted by Dodge. He tells her he killed Ferriman and that they can salvage the gold to start a life together, but Epps asks why Dodge has not asked her where Munder is. Realizing his ruse failed, \\"Dodge\\" morphs into Ferriman, who killed Dodge. Ferriman plans to use the Graza as a trap to continue collecting souls. As long as the Graza is kept afloat, the souls of everyone who died aboard the ship will be dragged down when Ferriman fills his quota and returns to Hell. He offers to spare Epps's life in exchange for her not interfering, but she detonates the explosives. Ferriman is blown to pieces in the explosion and Katie helps Epps escape the sinking ship. Katie and the other souls trapped on the ship are freed. Epps is found by a cruise ship and returned to land. As she is loaded into an ambulance, she sees the crates of gold being loaded onto the cruise ship by members of the crew, overseen by a resurrected Ferriman, who glares at her and carries on; she screams as the ambulance doors close. CastProduction=Writing Ghost Ship first emerged in January 1996 as Chimera, a spec script by Mark Hanlon. This script was a relatively bloodless psychological thriller rather than a vivid supernatural horror film. Most notably, much of the film's gore is absent from the screenplay. The film would have focused on four members of a salvage crew who end up stranded aboard the ghost vessel they are scuttling (the titular Chimera). Over the course of one night, each member ‚Äî due to panic, cabin fever, or supernatural forces ‚Äî goes insane and plots to kill the other three. In Chimera, Murphy is the \\"main killer\\" and the ship runs onto some rocks and begins to sink. Murphy and Epps survive until nearly the end but as the ship sinks, Murphy goes off to retrieve gold ingots. The weight of the gold and the time he loses in getting to it leads to Murphy's demise. As in the film, Katie helps Epps escape. Over time, the script underwent rewrites, and the psychological aspects of the script were all jettisoned in favor of making the film a slasher. It has been suggested that \\"The cast signed on based on this (original) draft ... and were sadly disappointed to find the script had been radically changed by Joel Silver and associates when they arrived to begin shooting.\\"First draft screenplay of \\"Ghost Ship\\" (formerly \\"Chimera\\" ). Scale modeling The idea of filming on a real ship was continually brought up, and a few ships were scouted for the possibility of being used as the Antonia Graza. \\"The temptation was always to shoot on the real thing,\\" Beck says. \\"We actually visited a few [ships] , but every time we thought, 'How are we ever going to get a dolly through this alley? Or down this hallway?' When you're shooting you often have to punch through a wall in order to get the shot you need, and on a steel ship that's impossible. We knew the real thing would be far too limiting.\\" Instead of using an actual ship, Australian visual effects company Photon VFX, who prior had worked on the 2002 film Scooby-Doo, was hired as the principal contractor for all visual effects. This allowed Warner Bros. to take full advantage of the wide spectrum of services offered including CGI, animation, miniatures, live-action, prosthetics, pyrotechnics and aerial, underwater and motion control cinematography. The SS Andrea Doria served as the inspiration for the film's ship the Antonia Graza. Photon created a 35-foot 1/20th scale model of the ship, allowing the exterior shots to be a combination of CGI, miniature, and live-action footage. For certain exterior shots a miniature just wouldn't work, so instead a full-scale forecastle and bow were constructed. \\"It was a full-scale replica, so it wouldn't have fit into a studio,\\" Walker explains. \\"It also needed to have sky backgrounds surrounding it, so we built it on a hill to achieve the desired effect.\\" Filming Principal photography for Ghost Ship began in January 2002 on location in Queensland, Australia. The majority of the film was shot on sets built on a sound stage at Village Roadshow Studios. The only ship used in Ghost Ship was the tugboat Artic Warrior used by the main protagonists. While filming the exterior shots on the tugboat, a feeding frenzy occurred in the water bringing 800-1000 sharks within 50 yards of the production and its stars. In February 2002, the 35-foot-long model of the Antonia Graza, made by Photon VFX, was taken out to Moreton Bay to film establishing shots of the ship adrift. In early February, construction of the bow and foredeck of the full-scale replica of the Antonia Graza was getting underway at Newstead, Queensland. Construction, which lasted roughly six weeks, drew many curious residents and tourists that were hoping to get a look at the nearly 100-foot-tall (30m) massive hull that dominated the surrounding area. The film was also shot in Halifax, Nova Scotia and Vancouver. Effects Dale Duguid, the creative director of Photon VFX, wanted to push the boundaries. There was a lot of pride for Ghost Ship since it was the largest visual effect contract completely done in Australia to date. Photon VFX filmed a real ocean-liner at sea off the coast of New South Wales, digitally removed the ship, but kept all of its movements, leaving nothing but ocean and sky. Then the tracking data was taken and in-put into a robotic filming system, which then filmed the 35-foot-long (10 m) miniature ship. The digital effects team then added 300 digital extras, in addition to digital water and smoke to make the scene appear as realistic as possible. The dramatic scene, which features the derelict ballroom reverting to its former grand-self, posed a problem for the effects crew. \\"That was the most difficult shot I've ever worked on,\\" says Duguid. Filming took place on two different sets, the first being the decrepit ballroom which had been adrift for forty years. The second set was the luxurious ballroom, used in the opening scene with happy party guests having a grand time. \\"We were filming on a derelict set and a new set, and we shot 80 layers of that scene on a circular motion control track, each time with different things going on. Some we shot forwards, some backwards, some fast, some slow.\\" Music and soundtrack The soundtrack album for Ghost Ship was composed by John Frizzell. The score is described by Filmtracks.com as \\"tap [dancing] around some old genre cliches while diving head first into others, producing a score with drama, fright, and a slight hint of elegance at times as well.\\" The album was released on the Var√®se Sarabande label on 5 November 2002. The songs \\"Not Falling\\" by Mudvayne and \\"Senza Fine\\" sung by Monica Mancini did not make it onto the soundtrack despite being featured in the film. Release Ghost Ship was theatrically released on October 25, 2002. The theatrical poster for Ghost Ship is similar to that of the 1980 film Death Ship. Promotion Warner Bros. in association with Hollywood.com sponsored a sweepstakes to promote the film beginning October 18, 2002, with the final drawing on November 1. Applicants could enter for the chance to win the grand prize dubbed the \\"Ghost Ship Prize Package\\" of promotional merchandise consisting of one Ghost Ship baseball hat, one spinning skull mug, one Ghost Ship shower CD player, and the Ghost Ship soundtrack. The runners up would receive just the baseball hat and mug. Box office With a reported budget of $20 million, the film opened at no. 3 at the box office with $11,503,423 in ticket sales as Jackass: The Movie dominated the cinema releases. The film grossed $30,113,491 in North America and had an international gross of $38,236,393, earning a total of $68,349,884. Critical response  According to internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, Ghost Ship has a 16% approval rating based on 127 reviews. The consensus states that \\"With a plot as creaky as the boat, Ghost Ship fails to deliver the scares\\". Similarly, Metacritic gives the film a score of 28/100 based on 25 reviews and rates the film as \\"generally unfavorable\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"C+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film received varied critical reception in the United States: The New York Timess Stephen Holden criticized its preoccupation with special effects, and while praising its establishment of mood, ultimately deemed it \\"an incoherent supernatural thriller that would like to think of itself as a Halloween-ready horror fusion of The Perfect Storm and Titanic. Carla Meyer of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the performance of Isaiah Washington, but deemed the film \\"a stupid, derivative horror film that substitutes extreme gore for suspense. Granted, there are only so many ways to kill people in these pictures, but lingering on a woman on a meat hook doesn't make a movie scary. It makes it gross.\\" Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times was critical of the script's lack of character development, writing: \\"With its minor shivers and modest Grand Guignol showmanship, Ghost Ship is the sort of flimflam that would have filled eight paneled pages in the great horror comic book Tales From the Crypt or consumed about 30 minutes on the latter-day HBO spinoff.\\" Roger Ebert said the film is \\"better than you expect but not as good as you hope,\\" while Joel Siegel of Good Morning America awarded the film a B- rating, writing: \\"After a very brutal and bloody beginning, Ghost Ship plays like an old-fashioned ghost story, the kind that kept you awake when you were a kid.\\" In a review published by IGN, the reviewer awarded the film one-and-a- half out of five stars, stating: \\"as a horror fan, I applaud what Silver and Zemeckis are trying to do with Dark Castle, Ghost Ship just isn't a cruise worth taking.\\" Upon the film's release in the United Kingdom in January 2003, The Guardians Peter Bradshaw praised its set design, but added \\"it's the same old tired stuff we've seen a hundred times before in various permutations.\\" Jamie Russell of the BBC awarded the film two out of five stars, but praised its opening sequence. While critical response to Ghost Ship was varied upon its theatrical release, many contemporary critics and film fans alike praised its elaborate opening murder sequence. Website Bloody Disgusting listed Ghost Ships opening massacre as #13 in their list of \\"The Top 13 Kills in Horror Movie History,\\" while ComingSoon named the scene one of the greatest opening sequences in horror film history.

Similar to Shalman of Khyber, a city by name Shalman is also present in Gilan Province of Iran, and the fourth largest river in Iran is also named as Shalman. . These landmarks with synonym Shalman suggest that this tribe could have moved from Syria through Iran (Gilan Shalman) to current Shalman Valley in Khyber Agency near Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

M.Saida Khan Shinwari states in his book that, Shilmani are counted as Ghoryakhel tribe divided as Shamsher Khel, Halimzai and Kam Shilmanis and considers them to be Mohmand. He states that Shamsher Khels are related to Morcha Khel Mohmands, Halimzai to Halimzai Mohmands and Kam Shilmanis to Tarakzai Mohmands. Officially the Shilmanis are treated as a separate tribe since the Khyber Agreement of 1881. The Shilmanis are closer to Mohmands in characteristics and based on historical evidence they appear to be close kinsmen of the Mohmand. Shalmani are called as \\"Shalmani Momands\\" by Harold Carmichael Wylly, at page-317 in his book \\"From the Black Mountain to Waziristan\\".

Before the establishment of the team, then-West German astronauts were selected for single missions, or as part of the European Space Agency's manned spaceflight activities. East Germany had its first cosmonaut, Sigmund J√§hn; J√§hn was both West and East Germany's first citizen in space when he departed from Baikonur in the Soviet Union in August and returned to Earth in September 1978. West and East Germany reunified in 1990 and the astronaut team became representative of a single German nation. In 1998, the team became part of the European Astronaut Corps.  History  In 1976, East Germany selected Sigmund J√§hn and Eberhard K√∂llner as the participants of Intercosmos missions to the Soviet Salyut 6 space station. J√§hn flew in 1978 on Soyuz 31. In 1978, the ESA selected a first group of astronauts to fly on the Space Shuttle on Spacelab missions. Among this first group was Ulf Merbold, who then also flew the first Spacelab mission STS-9. In the second ESA selection in 1992 Thomas Reiter was selected. For the first (then-West) German sponsored Spacelab mission D-1, Reinhard Furrer and Ernst Messerschmid were selected in 1983. Both flew again on STS-61-A in 1985. The astronaut team was established in 1987, as part of the preparation for the second West German-sponsored Spacelab mission, D-2.  Team members  The team initially consisted of 5 astronaut candidates: *Renate Br√ºmmer *Hans Schlegel *Gerhard Thiele *Heike Walpot *Ulrich Walter For a German mission to the space station Mir, two cosmonauts were selected in 1990 (a few days after the reunification of West and East Germany), and added to the German team: * Klaus-Dietrich Flade * Reinhold Ewald Flaede flew on Soyuz TM-14 in 1992.

He contributed much to the mathematical form of matrix mechanics, and developed canonical anticommutation relations for fermions. Jordan algebra is employed for and is still used in studying the mathematical and conceptual foundations of quantum theory, and has found other mathematical applications. Family history Pascual Jordan's parents were Ernst Pasqual Jordan (1858-1924) and Eva Fischer. Ernst Jordan, the father of the subject of this biography, was a painter who was renowned for his portraits and landscapes. He was an associate professor of art at Hannover Technical University when his son was born. The family name was originally Jorda and it was of Spanish origin. The first born sons were all given the name Pasqual or the version Pascual. The family settled in Hannover after Napoleon's defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 and at some stage changed their name from Jorda to Jordan. Ernst Jordan married Eva Fischer in 1892. An ancestor of Pascual Jordan named Pascual Jordan was a Spanish nobleman and cavalry officer who served with the British during and after the Napoleonic Wars. Jordan eventually settled in Hannover. In those days the House of Hanover ruled the United Kingdom. The family name was eventually changed to Jordan (pronounced in the German manner, or ). A family tradition held that the first-born son in each generation be named Pascual. Jordan was raised with a traditional religious upbringing. At age 12 he attempted to reconcile a literal interpretation of the Bible with Darwinian evolution; his teacher of religion convinced him there was no contradiction between science and religion (Jordan would write numerous articles on the relationship between the two throughout his life). Jordan enrolled in the Technical University of Hannover in 1921 where he studied zoology, mathematics, and physics. As was typical for a German university student of the time, he shifted his studies to another university before obtaining a degree. The University of G√∂ttingen, his destination in 1923, was then at the very zenith of its powers in mathematics and the physical sciences, such as under the guidance of mathematician David Hilbert and the physicist Arnold Sommerfeld. At G√∂ttingen Jordan became an assistant to the mathematician Richard Courant for a time, and then he studied under the physicist Max Born for his doctorate. Scientific work Together with Max Born and Werner Heisenberg, Jordan was a coauthor of an important series of papers on quantum mechanics.Silvan S. Schweber, QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson, Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga, Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994, . He went on to pioneer early quantum field theory before largely switching his focus to cosmology before World War II. Jordan devised a type of nonassociative algebras, now named Jordan algebras in his honor, in an attempt to create an algebra of observables for quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. Today, von Neumann algebras are also employed for this purpose. Jordan algebras have since been applied in projective geometry, number theory, complex analysis, optimization, and many other fields of pure and applied mathematics, and continue to be used in studying the mathematical and conceptual underpinnings of quantum theory. In 1966, Jordan published his 182-page work Die Expansion der Erde. Folgerungen aus der Diracschen Gravitationshypothese (The expansion of the Earth. Conclusions from the Dirac gravitation hypothesis)Die Wissenschaft, vol. 124. Friedrich Vieweg & Sohn, Braunschweig 1966 in which he developed his theory that, according to Paul Dirac's hypothesis of a steady weakening of gravitation throughout the history of the universe, the Earth may have swollen to its current size, from an initial ball of a diameter of only about . This theory could explain why the ductile lower sima layer of the Earth's crust is of a comparatively uniform thickness, while the brittle upper sial layer of the Earth's crust had broken apart into the main continental plates. The continents having to adapt to the ever flatter surface of the growing ball, the mountain ranges on the Earth's surface would, in the course of that, have come into being as constricted folds.Heinz Haber: Despite the energy Jordan invested in the expanding Earth theory, his geological work was never taken seriously by either physicists or geologists. Political activities Germany's defeat in the First World War and the Treaty of Versailles had a profound effect on Jordan's political beliefs. While many of his colleagues believed the Treaty to be unjust, Jordan went much further and became increasingly nationalistic and right-wing. He wrote numerous articles in the late 1920s that propounded an aggressive and bellicose stance. He was an anti-communist and was particularly concerned about the Russian Revolution and the rise of the Bolsheviks. In 1933, Jordan joined the Nazi party, like Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark, and, moreover, joined an SA unit. He supported the Nazis' nationalism and anti-communism but at the same time, he remained \\"a defender of Einstein\\" and other Jewish scientists. Jordan seemed to hope that he could influence the new regime; one of his projects was attempting to convince the Nazis that modern physics developed as represented by Einstein and especially the new Copenhagen brand of quantum theory could be the antidote to the \\"materialism of the Bolsheviks\\". However, while the Nazis appreciated his support for them, his continued support for Jewish scientists and their theories led him to be regarded as politically unreliable. Jordan enlisted in the Luftwaffe in 1939 and worked as a weather analyst at the Peenem√ºnde rocket center, for a while. During the war he attempted to interest the Nazi party in various schemes for advanced weapons. His suggestions were ignored because he was considered \\"politically unreliable\\", probably because of his past associations with Jews (in particular: Courant, Born, and Wolfgang Pauli) and the so-called \\"Jewish physics\\". Had Jordan not joined the Nazi party, it is conceivable that he could have won a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work with Max Born. Born would go on to win the 1954 Physics Prize with Walther Bothe. Wolfgang Pauli declared Jordan to be \\"rehabilitated\\" to the West German authorities some time after the war, allowing him to regain academic employment after a two-year period. He then recovered his full status as a tenured professor in 1953. Jordan went against Pauli's advice, and reentered politics after the period of denazification came to an end under the pressures of the Cold War. He secured election to the Bundestag standing with the conservative Christian Democratic Union. In 1957 Jordan supported the arming of the Bundeswehr with tactical nuclear weapons by the Adenauer government, while the G√∂ttingen Eighteen (which included Born and Heisenberg) issued the G√∂ttinger Manifest in protest. This and other issues were to further strain his relationships with his former friends and colleagues.

Purpose The mobile lounge was an innovative feature of the Washington Dulles terminal design by Eero Saarinen. Saarinen promoted the mobile lounge concept with a short animated film by Charles and Ray Eames. Dulles Airport was the realization of the concepts expressed in the film. Dulles's designers thought that by shuttling from the main terminal directly to a midfield jet ramp, they could save passengers from long walking distances amidst weather, noise, and fumes on the ramp. The advent of the jet bridge and construction of the two midfield concourse buildings at this airport negated the benefits of the system. Application The mobile lounge is used at Washington Dulles International Airport in Virginia and at Montr√©al‚ÄìPierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Canada. The system was also used at Montreal Mirabel International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport's International Terminal in New York City, Mexico City Airport until 2007, Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris before the 1990s and at King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah until the early 2000s. While it is still used at Dulles Airport, the growth in passenger numbers made it impractical to use mobile lounges for individual flights. Remote concourses were constructed, and the fleet of mobile lounges was used as a shuttle between the concourses and the main terminal. On January 26, 2010, the MWAA replaced the Dulles mobile lounge system for passenger movements between the Main Terminal and the A-, B-, and C-Gates with the underground AeroTrain. However, some mobile lounges and plane mates remain in use for passenger movements between the main terminal and Concourse D (until the replacement Concourses C and D are built and the AeroTrain is built out to run in a continuous two-way loop), to disembark international passengers from all arriving international aircraft (with the exception of United Airlines and certain Star Alliance flights, which are directly serviced at Concourse C's Federal Inspection Station; and flights from airports with border preclearance) and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, and to convey passengers between the main terminal and aircraft on hard standing (i.e., those parked remotely on the tarmac without access to jet bridges). Variants=Passenger Transfer Vehicle (PTV) The Passenger Transfer Vehicle or Passenger Transport Vehicle (PTV) (mobile lounge) is a 54-by-16-foot carriage mounted on a scissor truck, capable of carrying 102 passengers. These vehicles were designed by the Chrysler Corporation in association with the Budd Company, and are sometimes nicknamed \\"moon buggies\\" due to their otherworldly appearance. When mobile lounges were first introduced, they had ramps at one end that could be raised or lowered to the floor height of an aircraft. However, after Dulles built the midfield concourses, some of the lounges were retrofitted to be used only for inter- terminal passenger transport. The ramps were removed and doors that could interlock with a terminal building were fitted to either end. Mobile lounges have a driver's cab at each end. The wheels at either end of the lounge can be steered, but the wheels at the end opposite the driver lock into a straight- ahead configuration so that the lounge is steered only by the forward driving wheels. Plane Mate The Plane Mate is an evolutionary variation on the mobile lounge concept. They are similar in appearance to mobile lounges, but can raise themselves on screws (parts of which are contained in a pair of fin- like towers above the vehicles) to \\"mate\\" directly with an aircraft. These are used at Dulles and Dorval. This allows passengers to deplane directly aboard and be carried to the main terminal. They are easily identified by the different window configuration. More noticeably, plane mates have two short columns on the roof with yellow beacons mounted on the top, and have an accordion-like canopy at one end (similar to the canopy seen at the end of a jet bridge) and have only one driver's cab and one set of steering wheels at the canopy end. NASA Crew Transport Vehicles Early in the space shuttle program, NASA used the Plane Mate system of mobile lounge to move astronauts directly from the orbiter to crew facilities. A modified vehicle obtained from Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport in Baltimore, Maryland was used for shuttle landings at Edwards Air Force Base. A similar vehicle was used at the Kennedy Space Center to take astronauts directly from the orbiter to the Operations and Checkout building, where the vehicle was again lifted up for the astronauts to exit directly onto the 2nd floor of the facility.JSC Digital Image Collection Hardware Information at NASA Gallery File:Crew Transport Vehicle at Baseline Data Collection Facility.jpgNASA crew transport vehicle docked at data collection facility File:Crew Transport Vehicle at Edwards Air Force Base (1991).jpgNASA crew transport vehicle used to move space shuttle astronauts from the orbiter File:Mobile lounge Washington Dulles Airport 2010.jpgA mobile lounge See also *Astronaut transfer van *Mobile Quarantine Facility References Buses by type Airport infrastructure Public transport by mode Chrysler vehicles ","title":"Mobile lounge"},{"id":"1354709","text":"{ align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg } The two knights endgame is a chess endgame with a king and two knights versus a king. In contrast to a king and two bishops (on opposite-colored squares), or a bishop and a knight, a king and two knights cannot force checkmate against a lone king (however, the superior side can force stalemate , ). Although there are checkmate positions, the superior side cannot force them against proper, relatively easy defense . Paradoxically, although the king and two knights cannot force checkmate of the lone king, there are positions in which the king and two knights can force checkmate against a king and some additional material . The extra material of the defending side provides moves that prevent the defending king from being stalemated . The winning chances with two knights are insignificant except against a few pawns. These positions were studied extensively by A. A. Troitsky. (See Troitsky line.) If the side with the knights carelessly captures the other side's extra material, the game devolves to the basic two knights endgame, and the opportunity to force checkmate may be lost. When the defender has a single pawn, the technique (when it is possible) is to block the pawn with one knight, and use the king and the other knight to force the opposing king into a corner or nearby the blocking knight. Then, when the block on the pawn is removed, the knight that was used to block the pawn can be used to checkmate . Checkmate possibilities { align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg } Two knights cannot force checkmate, but three knights can. Although there are checkmate positions with two knights against a king, they cannot be forced. Edmar Mednis stated that this inability to force checkmate is \\"one of the great injustices of chess\\" . Unlike some other theoretically drawn endgames, such as a rook and bishop versus rook, the defender has an easy task in all endings with two knights versus a lone king. The player simply has to avoid moving into a position in which he or she can be checkmated on the next move, and always has another move available in such situations . Two knightsIn the corner= The player with the lone king has to make a blunder to be checkmated. In this position, 1.Ne7 or 1.Nh6 immediately stalemates Black. White can try instead: : 1. Nf8 Kg8 : 2. Nd7 Kh8 : 3. Nd6 Kg8 : 4. Nf6+ and now if Black moves 4...Kh8?? then 5.Nf7# is checkmate, but if Black moves : 4... Kf8 then White has made no progress . Johann Berger gave this position, a draw with either side to move. With White to move: : 1. Nf5 Kh8 : 2. Ng5 Kg8 : 3. Ne7 Kf8! (Black just avoids 3...Kh8? which leads to a checkmate on the next move with 4.Nf7#) : 4. Kf6 Ke8 and White has made no progress. With Black to move: : 1... Kh8 : 2. Nf7 Kg8 : 3. Nh6 Kh8 : 4. Ng5 gives stalemate . =On the edge= There are also checkmate positions with the inferior side's king on the edge of the board (instead of the corner), but again they cannot be forced ( + ). In the position at right, White can try 1. Nb6+, hoping for 1...Kd8?? 2.Ne6#. Black can easily avoid this with, for example, 1... Kc7. This possible checkmate is the basis of some problems (see below). =Examples from games= In this position from a 1949 gameBenko‚ÄìBronstein between Pal Benko and David Bronstein, Black underpromoted to a knight. Black did not promote to a queen or any other piece because White could fork Black's king and his newly promoted piece (e.g. 104...f1=Q 105.Ne3+) immediately after the promotion. :104...f1=N+ :105. Kc3 Kf3. White made the humorous move :106. Nh2+ forking Black's king and knight, but sacrificing the knight. Black responded :106... Nxh2 and a draw was agreed . (A draw by threefold repetition could have been claimed on move 78 and at other times.) Another example is the eighth game of the 1981 World Chess Championship match between Anatoly Karpov and Viktor Korchnoi.Karpov vs. Korchnoi Black forces a draw by * 80... Nf7! * 81. h7 Ng5! * 82. Ne7+ Kb7 * 83. Nxg6 Nxh7 * 84. Nxh7 draw  Three knights  Three knights and a king can force checkmate against a lone king within twenty moves (unless the defending king can win one of the knights) . Also, a complete computational retrograde analysis revealed that they can force checkmate only on the edge of the board. Two knights versus a pawn  { align=\\"right\\"  Image:Chess kll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess nll45.svg  Image:Chess kdl45.svg  Image:Chess pdl45.svg } In some positions with two knights versus a pawn, the knights can force checkmate by gaining a tempo when the pawn has to move. Troitsky line Even though two knights cannot force checkmate (with the help of their king) against a lone king (with the exception of positions where white wins in one move), decreasing the material advantage and allowing the defending king to have a pawn can actually allow for a forced checkmate. The reason that checkmate can be forced is that the pawn gives the defender a piece to move and deprives him of a stalemate defense . Another reason is that the pawn can block its own king's path without necessarily moving (e.g. Kling & Horwitz position right). The Troitsky line (or Troitsky position) is a key motif in chess endgame theory in the rare but theoretically interesting ending of two knights versus a pawn. The line, assuming White has the two knights and Black the pawn, is shown left. The Russian theoretician Troitsky made a detailed study of this endgame and discovered the following rule: An example of the application of this rule is given in the diagram M√ºller and Lamprecht right; \\"... the position would be lost no matter where the kings are\\". However, the checkmate procedure is difficult and long. In fact, it can require up to 115 moves by White, so in competition often a draw by the fifty-move rule will occur first (but see this article and Second Troitsky line section for the zone where the win can be forced within fifty moves). Troitsky showed that \\"on any placement of the black king, White undoubtedly wins only against black pawns standing on [the Troitsky line] and above\\" . John Nunn analyzed the endgame of two knights versus a pawn with an endgame tablebase and stated that \\"the analysis of Troitsky and others is astonishingly accurate\\" . He undertook this checking after the very ending occurred in a critical variation of his post mortem analysis of a game he lost to Korchnoi in the 1980 Phillips and Drew Tournament in London. Neither player knew whether the position was a win for the player with the knights (Korchnoi). Even when the position is a theoretical win, it is very complicated and difficult to play correctly. Even grandmasters fail to win it. Andor Lilienthal failed to win it twice in a six- year period, see Norman vs. Lilienthal and Smyslov vs. Lilienthal. But a fine win is in a game by Seitz, see Znosko-Borovsky vs. Seitz . Two knights versus pawn is sometimes called the \\"Halley's Comet\\" endgame.use of name =Examples= This diagram shows an example of how having the pawn makes things worse for Black (here Black's pawn is past the Troitsky line), by making Black have a move available instead of being stalemated. :1. Ne4 d2 :2. Nf6+ Kh8 :3. Ne7 (if Black did not have the pawn at this point, the game would be a draw because of stalemate) :3... d1=Q :4. Ng6# If Black did not have the pawn move available, White could not force checkmate. The longest wins require 115 moves; this is one example starting with 1... Ne7. =Pawn beyond the Troitsky line= In this study by Andr√© Ch√©ron, White wins even though the pawn is well beyond the Troitsky line . Black to move is quicker. With White to move, he must maneuver to give the move to Black, as follows. 1.Kc3 Kb1 2.Kd2 Ka1 3.Kc1 Ka2 4.Kc2 (White then maneuvres to get the same position with vertical instead of horizontal opposition) 4...Ka1 5.Kb3 Kb1 6.Nb2 Kc1 7.Kc3 Kb1 8.Nd3 Ka1 9.Kc4 Ka2 10.Kb4 Ka1 11.Ka3 Kb1 12.Kb3 (Now White has enough time to bring the blockading N in to generate a mating net in time) 12...Ka1 13.Ne3 g2 14.Nc2+ Kb1 15.Na3+ Ka1 16.Nb4 g1=Q 17.Nbc2# In the situation with Black's rook pawn blockaded on h3, if the black king can enter and remain in the area marked with crosses in the adjacent diagram, the game is a draw. Otherwise, White can force the black king into one of the corners not located in the drawing zone and deliver checkmate. Black cannot be checkmated in the a8-corner because the knight on h2 is too far away to help deliver mate: Black draws by pushing the pawn as soon as White moves the knight on h2. White to play in the diagram can try to prevent Black to enter the drawing zone with 1.Ke6, but Black then plays 1...Kg5 aiming to attack the knight on h2. White is compelled to stop this with 2.Ke5 which allows Black to return to the initial position with 2...Kg6, and White has made no progress . =Topalov versus Karpov= Anatoly Karpov lost an endgame with a pawn versus two knights to Veselin TopalovTopalov vs. Karpov although he had a theoretical draw with a pawn past the Troitsky line; because of its rarity, Karpov seemed not to know the theory of drawing and headed for the wrong corner. (Depending on the position of the pawn, checkmate can be forced only in certain corners .) In this \\"rapid play\\" time control, the position in the game was initially a draw, but Karpov made a bad move which resulted in a lost position. Topalov later made a bad move, making the position a draw, but Karpov made another bad move, resulting in a lost position again.M√ºller article =Wang versus Anand= This position from a blindfold game between Wang Yue and Viswanathan Anand leads to an example with a forced win even though the pawn is past the Troitsky line.Wang vs. Anand The game continued :61... Kc5, blocking the pawn with the wrong piece. Black should have played 61...Ne4 62. c4 Nc5!, blocking the pawn on the Troitsky line with a knight, with a forced win. The game continued: :62. c4 Ne4 :63. Ka4 Nd4 :64. Ka5. Black still has a theoretical forced win in this position, even after letting the pawn advance past the Troitsky line: :64... Nc6+ :65. Ka6 Kd6!! :66. c5+ Kc7 and Black has a forced checkmate in 58 more moves . However, the actual game was drawn. Second Troitsky line Karsten M√ºller asked for the \\"second Troitsky line\\", which corresponds to where the knights can win without the fifty-move rule coming into effect. If Black's pawn is blocked by a white knight on or behind one of the dots, White can force a win within fifty moves. If the pawn can be blocked on or behind one of the Xs, White can force a win within fifty moves more than 99 percent of the time.The second Troitsky line More pawns { align=\\"right\\" -valign=\\"top\\" +   } Two knights can win in some cases when the defender has more than one pawn. First the knights should blockade the pawns and then capture all except one. The knights cannot set up an effective blockade against four connected pawns, so the position generally results in a draw. Five or more pawns usually win against two knights . Example from game In this 1991 game between Paul Motwani and Ilya Gurevich, Black has blockaded the white pawns. In ten moves, Black won the pawn on d4. There were some inaccuracies on both sides, but White resigned on move 99 . Position of mutual zugzwang There are positions of mutual zugzwang in the endgame with two knights versus one pawn. In this position, White to move draws but Black to move loses. With Black to move: : 1... Kh7 : 2. Ne4 d2 : 3. Nf6+ Kh8 : 4. Ne7 (or 4.Nh4) d1=Q : 5. Ng6# With White to move, Black draws with correct play. White cannot put Black in zugzwang: : 1. Kf6 Kh7 : 2. Kf7 Kh8 : 3. Kg6 Kg8 : 4. Ng7 Kf8 : 5. Kf6 Kg8 : 6. Ne6 Kh7! (but not 6...Kh8? because White wins after 7.Kg6!, which puts Black to move) : 7. Kg5 Kg8 : 8. Kg6 Kh8 and White has no way to force a win . Checkmate in problems The possible checkmate on the edge of the board is the basis of some composed chess problems, as well as variations of the checkmate with two knights against a pawn. ;Angos, 2005 In this problem by Alex Angos, White checkmates in four moves: :1. Ne6! Nd8 :2. Nf6+ Kh8 :3. Ng5 N‚Äìany (Black is in zugzwang and any knight move must abandon the protection of the f7-square) :4. Nf7# . ;;Berger, 1890 A similar problem was composed by Johann Berger in 1890. The solution is: :1. Nf7! Nd6 :2. Nh6+ Kh8 :3. Ng5 followed by :4.

Bh4! Bf6! : 8. Ng5+ Kh6There is no apparent win after 8...Kg7, based on analysis by Houdini 2.0. Yet according to Nalimov tablebases - White does win by force. : 9. Ng8+ Kh5 : 10. Nxf6+! Kxh4 : 11.

Ng3# History The first known composition where two knights win against one pawn is, according to Lafora, by Gioachino Greco in 1620.C.R. Lafora (1965). Dos caballos en combate. Madrid: Aguilera, p.39. In 1780, Chapais did a partial analysis of three positions with the pawn on f4 or h4 . In 1851 Horwitz and Kling published three positions where the knights win against one pawn and two positions where they win against two pawns . The analysis by Chapais was revised by Guretsky-Cornitz and others, and included by Johann Berger in Theory and Practice of the Endgame, first published in 1891. However, the analysis by Guretsky-Cornitz was incorrect and the original analysis by Chapais was in principle, correct . Troitsky started studying the endgame in the early 20th century and published his extensive analysis in 1937 . Modern computer analysis found it to be very accurate . Master games with this ending are rare ‚Äî Troitsky knew of only six when he published his analysis in 1937. In the first four (from c. 1890 to 1913), the weaker side brought about the ending to obtain a draw from an opponent who did not know how to win. The first master game with a win was in 1931 when Adolf Seitz beat Eugene Znosko-Borovsky .Znosko-Borovsky vs. Seitz See also * Checkmate * Chess endgame NotesReferences   Reprint: (1996)    The last part (pages 197‚Äì257) is a supplement containing Troitsky's analysis of two knights versus pawns.

In the radio series' opening exchange, awkward teen Henry's mother called, \\"Hen-reeeeeeeeeeeee! Hen-ree Al-drich!\\", and he responded with a breaking adolescent voice, \\"Com-ing, Mother!\\" The creation of playwright Clifford Goldsmith, Henry Aldrich began on Broadway as a minor character in Goldsmith's play What a Life. Produced and directed by George Abbott, What a Life ran for 538 performances (April 13, 1938 to July 8, 1939). The Broadway cast included Eddie Bracken, Betty Field and Butterfly McQueen. The actor who brought Henry to life on stage was 20-year-old Ezra Stone, who was billed near the bottom as the 20th actor in the cast. Stone was also employed as the play's production assistant. Time magazine found the play \\"short on plot\\" but noted: Radio Jackie Kelk (left) as Homer Brown and Ezra Stone as Henry Aldrich on the air, 1947. Kelk with Dick Jones, who played Henry from 1943 to 1944. When Rudy Vallee saw the play, he asked Goldsmith to adapt it into some sketches for his radio program, and this was followed in 1938 by a 39-week run of a sketch comedy series on The Kate Smith Hour with Stone continuing in the role of Henry. Smith's director, Bob Welsh, is credited with the creation of the \\"Hen-reeeeeeeeeeeee! Hen-ree Al-drich!\\" opening, which eventually became one of the most famous signature sounds in radio. After finding an audience with Smith's listeners, The Aldrich Family was launched in its own series as a summer replacement program for Jack Benny in NBC's Sunday night lineup, July 2, 1939, and it stayed there until October 1, 1939, when it moved to Tuesday nights at 8 p.m., sponsored by General Foods's popular gelatin dessert Jell-O, which also sponsored Jack Benny at the time. The Aldriches ran in that slot from October 10, 1939 until May 28, 1940, moving to Thursdays, from July 4, 1940 until July 20, 1944. After a brief hiatus, the show moved to CBS, running on Fridays from September 1, 1944 until August 30, 1946 with sponsors Grape Nuts and Jell-O before moving back to NBC from September 5, 1946 to June 28, 1951 on Thursdays and, then, as a Sustaining program in its final run of September 21, 1952 to April 19, 1953 on Sundays. Beginning on July 5, 1946, the program ran for 10 weeks on Friday nights as a summer replacement for Kate Smith Sings. The sponsor, General Foods, used the time to \\"promote its salt product ... instead of Grape Nuts\\". The show was a top-ten ratings hit within two years of its birth (in 1941, the show carried a 33.4 Crossley rating, landing it solidly alongside Jack Benny and Bob Hope). Earning $3000 a week, Goldsmith was the highest paid writer in radio, and his show became a prototype for the teen-oriented situation comedies that followed on radio and television. Stone kept the lead role until 1942, when he entered the Army for World War II. Norman Tokar succeeded Stone as Henry for two seasons. Best known for his later work directing the television hit Leave It to Beaver ‚Äî whose approach of telling its stories from the vantage point of a child may have been inspired by the similar implication in many Aldrich episodes ‚Äî Tokar also helped write many of the Aldrich episodes. On The Aldrich Family, Tokar was followed by Dickie Jones (1943‚Äì44) and Raymond Ives (1944-45), before Stone returned to his signature role. Bobby Ellis became the last Henry Aldrich in 1952. This series is now in the public domain and is available for download on the Internet Archive. Family and friends Henry's parents, Sam and Alice, were portrayed by House Jameson and Katharine Raht, his sister Mary was played by Charita Bauer among others, and his usual girlfriend, Kathleen Anderson, was voiced by Mary Shipp. The role of Henry's best friend, Homer Brown, was played by Jackie Kelk (as well as Jack Grimes, Michael O'Day and John Fiedler). Homer's parents were Arthur Vinton and Agnes Moorehead, among others. Eddie Bracken appeared in the earlier shows as friend Dizzy Stevens. The show's announcers included Harry Von Zell, Dan Seymour and Dwight Weist. The Aldrich Family lived at 117 Elm Street in Centerville, USA (state unknown). Henry, along with his friend Homer and an assortment of other friends attend Central High School. Henry's father Sam is a lawyer and his mother Alice is a homemaker. His older sister Mary is mentioned to be away at college in some episodes, and lives at home with the family in others. Also living in Centerville is Mrs. Aldrich's sister, Henry and Mary's Aunt Harriet. Henry has had a variety of pets, including dogs named Smoothie and Tauser, and pigeons and rabbits which he was raising in his attic, but no pet is mentioned regularly throughout the series. Henry Aldrich was an endearingly bumbling kid growing awkwardly into adolescence, and The Aldrich Family often revolved around Henry's misadventures with his friends and girls. Recognition In 1942, the Sam Aldrich character was named \\"radio's outstanding father\\" by the National Father's Day Committee.

In the remaining nine films, Jimmy Lydon portrayed Henry Aldrich. Olive Blakeney and John Litel played Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich, while Charles Smith and Joan Mortimer played Basil \\"Dizzy\\" Stevens and Elise Towers. Television Jackie Kelk, who played Homer Brown on the radio show, and Mary Malone as Mary Aldrich in the television program, 1951. On October 2, 1949, the program premiered on NBC while continuing to air on the radio with a primarily different cast. Over the course of its nearly four-year run on television, Henry was portrayed by five different actors: Robert Casey, Richard Tyler, Henry Girard, Kenneth Nelson and Bobby Ellis, the only one to participate in the radio production as well. Other characters -- including Mrs. Aldrich, Henry's sister Mary, and his best friend Homer Brown -- were portrayed by multiple actors as well, a practice not uncommon in radio but unusual for television, where cast changes are more noticeable. The program garnered some adverse publicity when film and radio veteran Jean Muir was signed to play Mrs. Aldrich in the second season, which was to begin on August 27, 1950. Shortly before Muir's scheduled premiere, Right-wing groups accused the actress of being a Communist sympathizer (her name appeared in Red Channels, a pamphlet listing the names of performers allegedly involved in left-wing activities), and General Foods, the show's sponsor, cancelled the first episode of the new season, replacing her with Nancy Carroll a week later, when the series returned on September 3. Muir went on to defend herself before a Congressional committee, but her career never recovered from the charges. After General Foods ended their sponsorship in the spring of 1951, Campbell Soup Company became the new sponsor when the series moved from Sundays to Friday nights that fall. The final episode was broadcast on May 29, 1953, slightly more than a month after the radio series came to an end. The cast of the television series included Marcia Henderson as Kathleen Anderson. The series finished at #15 in the Nielsen ratings for the 1950‚Äì1951 season. The comedy troupe Firesign Theatre parodied the show with the sketch \\"Don't Crush That Dwarf Hand Me the Pliers\\".

The band started in the summer of 1997 when P√•l Magnus Rybom and Jon-Ivar Berg started experimenting with electronic music. That summer the two of them recorded a demo. Berg left the group after they failed attract the attention of record labels and went to focus on his music project Biozide. Later that year Fredrik Hansen joined and Echo Image was officially formed with Trine Bilet joining towards the end of the year providing backing vocals, keyboards, and synthesizers. In December 1998, Echo Image recorded the Walkout EP, which was sold locally through a label called Kvarts Musikk. Their musical style didn't really suit Kvarts, whose catalog consisted of punk, prog, and lo-fi music; so in 2000 they signed to US synthpop label A Different Drum with the German label Bloodline releasing their music in Europe. Around this time Lars Kristian Holt joined as live guitarist and became a full-time member in July 2001. The 2000 single Need to Be Proud was mixed by Apoptygma Berzerk frontman Stephan Groth. After releasing Compuphonic simultaneously on A Different Drum and Bloodline, they signed with Hard:Drive and released the Endless Day single in 2002. Echo Image accompanied Apoptygma Berzerk on the Harmonizer tour in 2002. Hansen left the band in 2004 due to creative differences and to focus on his education. Around the same time, the band announced that they were working on a new album and released a teaser for the song \\"My Sense of Emptiness\\". The 2001 Single Skulk, which included a cover of Limahl's song \\"The NeverEnding Story\\", was also featured in the dancing games Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 2 and the Konami remix in Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 4, both for the Xbox video-game system. In July 2010, a new demo song, \\"Things I Know\\" was released to YouTube, along with a new interview of P√•l Magnus Rybom who mentioned that he is working on a new Echo Image album. On 1 October 2010, Echo Image played a live concert at ElektroStat. In April 2016, vinyl-only compilation, Compulation, was released on the label HolmByKarlsen Rekords. It features the previously unreleased track, \\"Frame of Mind\\". In January 2020, the band signed to Apoptygma Berzerk's label Pitch Black Drive and re-released all of their old material digitally. They had also announced that they were working on a new single.

The trench has a maximum depth of 7460 m (24,476 ft). The trench is the result of oceanic crust of the Philippine Plate obliquely subducting beneath the continental crust of the Eurasian Plate at a rate of approximately 52 mm/yr. In conjunction with the adjacent Nankai Trough to the northeast, subduction of the Philippine plate has produced 34 volcanoes. The largest earthquake to have been recorded along the Ryukyu Trench, the 1968 Hy≈´ga-nada earthquake, was magnitude 7.5 and occurred along the northernmost part of the trench on 1 April 1968. This earthquake also produced a tsunami.  Ryukyu Trench and Ryukyu Arc structure near Taiwan  Undersea geographic features of the western Pacific An east-west planar seismic zone associated with the Ryukyu Trench occurs off the east coast of Taiwan. This seismic zone is continuous laterally for 50 km and to 150 km depth. The hypocenters of earthquakes at this location outline a Benioff zone indicating that the Philippine Sea Plate is subducting at an angle of about 45¬∞ beneath the Eurasian plate in this area; the dip of the slab changes dramatically from one end of the trench to the other as noted in the next section. Such depth and dip inferences of this area are consistent with the positions of the overlying Tatun and Chilung volcano groups of Taiwan. The region behind (N and NW of) the Ryukyu Arc is a bathymetric low known as the Okinawa Trough. The Yilan Plain of Taiwan could be the westward continuation of this trough, but the Yilan Plain sits on the forearc side of the Ryukyu Trench system. This may indicate that the Ilan Plain represents a former spreading centre that sits trench-ward of the current spreading centre and volcanic arc. Near 122¬∞E (about 100 km East of the Taiwan Coast), the Ryukyu Arc is displaced to the north relative to the eastern extent of the arc. One hypothesis is that a north trending dextral transform faults has displaced this section of the arc to the north. A competing hypothesis claims that no transform fault motion is involved in the displacement, but rather the trench is continuous up to the northeast continental margin of Taiwan. A third hypothesis maintains that the trench is continuous through the continental margin right up to the northeastern Taiwan coastline, also without the existence of a dextral north-south trending fault.  Seismic structure  Ocean bottom seismography methods combined with earthquake studies of the Benioff zone constrain the dip angle of the Philippine Sea Plate along the Ryukyu trench. In the Northern part of the Ryukyu trench, the dip of the Philippine Sea Plate is shallow at shallow depth, reaching only about 11¬∞ in the first 50 km, and steeper at deeper depths, reaching 70¬∞ below about 70 km. In contrast, the slab dip in the central and southern parts of the Ryukyu trench is more gentle, reaching only 40-50¬∞ at 70 km depth. Ocean bottom seismography studies of the Ryukyu trench provide insight into the P-wave velocity structure of the area. In the northern part of the trench, several transects have been studied, including a profile of the back arc region parallel to the trench, a transect spanning the trench, fore arc and back arc region, and a transect spanning the Ryukyu volcanic arc. The transect perpendicular to the length of the trench images many distinct velocity layers. The sedimentary wedge created by subduction has four distinct layers with p-wave velocities of 1.8 km/s, 2.8-2.9 km/s, 3.5 km/s, and 4.5‚Äì5 km/s. In the area of this transect, the wedge reaches a thickness of 9 km at 50 km from the trench. Beneath the wedge are several seismic layers within the oceanic crust. Separate ocean bottom seismography and multi-channel seismic studies provide insight into the structure of the northern end of the Ryukyu trench region. Features of note include a thick (7‚Äì12 km) low velocity (4‚Äì5 km/s) zone on the landward side of the trench, the existence of subducting paleo-arc crust near the top of the trench in contrast to simple oceanic crust located at the middle of the trench, and a zone in which the Philippine Plate subducts beneath low P-wave velocity material (Vp = 5 km/s) that coincides with the location of the 7.5 1968 Hyuganada earthquake. It has been hypothesized that the above structural heterogeneity, in particular the subducting paleo-arc crust and its associated bathymetric highs, is one reason why earthquakes in this region are not larger i.e. exceeding 8.0. The exact mechanism by which the subduction of paleo-arc crust prevents sufficient stress build up for a larger earthquake is unknown.

Historical basis The literary and cinematic \\"Sergeant Steiner\\" character may be based upon Johann Schwerdfeger (b. 24 November 1914, in Plein bei Wittlich) who soldiered from 1935 to 1937 in Infanterie Regiment 84, and in 1939 was transferred to the Third Company of Infanterie Regiment 186 of the 73rd Infantry Division, at the Polish Campaign's start. In June 1942, after serving in J√§gerersatzbataillon 75, Schwerdfeger joined J√§ger Regiment 228 of the 101st J√§ger Division, who fought in the Don Bend, at Rostov, and at Maykop, in the Caucasus, and joined the retreat through the Kuban and the Taman Peninsula, the setting of the novel Das Geduldige Fleisch (The Willing Flesh). On 17 May 1943, Feldwebel Schwerdfeger was awarded the Knight's Cross as a platoon leader in the First Company. In April 1944, in the breakout from Hube's Pocket, he was severely wounded, and was awarded Oak Leaves for his Knight's Cross on 14 May 1944; moreover, Sergeant Schwerdfelger also earned two tank destruction badges. In two passages of The Willing Flesh (the novel's English edition), Meyer tells Stransky that Steiner saved Lieutenant Colonel Brandt's life; in the original German edition, \\"Meyer\\" is named \\"Sch√§fer\\", and \\"Brandt\\" is named \\"Strauss\\". From The Willing Flesh (Cross of Iron), in English: During the war, a similar action occurred to the First Battalion of the 228th J√§ger Regiment. Two German military history books about that division chronicle how one of the battalion's companies was surprised and pinned down by two Russian regiments and eleven tanks of the 296 Division, who had crossed the Donets River the night of 19‚Äì20 May 1942.

Nearly all the casualties and damage took place within the province of Aceh. The time of arrival of the tsunami was between 15 and 30 minutes after the deadly earthquake. According to the country's National Disaster Relief Coordination Agency, 250,000 people are dead and 37,063 are missing. In addition, the UN estimated that 655,000 people were homeless and sheltering in scattered refugee camps across the province.abclocal.go.com As of January 23, 2005 the Health Ministry reported 173,981 dead while the Social Affairs Ministry registered 114,978 killed.abcnews.go.com On 25 January 2005 Health Minister Fadilah Supari updated the estimated death total to 220,000.(BBC) On 7 April 2005 the estimated number of missing was reduced by more than 50,000 giving a final total of 167,540 dead and missing.  Aftermath  Northern Sumatra took damage from the earthquake itself as a tsunami landed on it. However, most of the damage was the result of the tsunami that struck the coastal regions of the Aceh and to a much lesser extent the North Sumatra provinces. The west coast of Aceh was about 100 km (60 mi) from the epicenter and took very heavy damage as far south as Tapaktuan. The coastal town of Lhoknga was hit by tsunami waves of more than 20 to 25 meters with run-up heights of more than 30 meters in some places. Ten-meter tall waves passed the northern tip of the island to race south down the Straits of Malacca and strike along the northeast coast as far east as Lhokseumawe. Reports from those who flew over the Aceh coast reported a virtually destroyed coastline. In many towns and villages, concrete pads were all that was left of substantial structures, while scattered corrugated iron roofs crumpled like paper wore the only evidence of flimsier houses. A few intact mosques rose amazingly from the wasteland. \\"You can't really explain. There used to be towns and cities there. All the people once had homes, lives,\\" said Petty Officer 1st Class Scott Wickland from the American aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. \\"Now there is nothing.\\" Relief efforts and communication along the western coastline were complicated because the one road along the coast was disrupted due to the destruction of dozens of bridges and much of the road being washed away or blocked by mud. The western districts of Aceh, lying nearest the epicenter of the magnitude-9 earthquake that caused the tsunami, were a \\"roadless\\" area, according to UN Emergency Coordinator Jan Egeland. \\"The lack of access by road is a key problem aid agencies face in the northern and western parts of Aceh,\\" Chris Lom, a spokesman in the region for the International Organisation for Migration, said on 7 January. A number of towns on the west coast were therefore cut off from the road from any airport or port. Relief efforts, therefore, required the use of helicopter or boat. In the town of Meulaboh in Aceh, for instance, where thousands are waited for aid, 99 percent of the bridges were gone and 60 percent of asphalt roads awash with mud according to Lom. \\"An escalation in the number of deaths is almost a certainty,\\" according to William Hyde, Jakarta-based emergency relief coordinator for the International Organisation for Migration. \\"So much of the coastline couldn't be accessed.\\"Bloomberg Government officials in Indonesia acknowledged they were forced to make crude estimates of the death toll because of the scale of the devastation and the breakdown of civil governance. They were forced to use such measures as counting the number of bodies in one mass grave and multiplying that by the number of such plots. In other cases, they estimated the population of a village, counted the survivors and assumed the rest were dead. () The scale of the breakdown of civil governance was shown by the fact that after a week 1400 policemen were missing in Aceh, and not reported in. The entire provincial government of Aceh, which had its capital at Banda Aceh was reportedly wiped out by the deaths of the provincial legislators, and many government workers. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan described the devastation in the Indonesian province of Aceh as the worst he had ever seen, after touring the region by helicopter on Friday 7 January 2005.BBC  Banda Aceh  A boat perched atop a house in Aceh after the tsunami A village near the coast of Sumatra lies in ruin. Banda Aceh was a city with a population of about 300,000 inhabitants before the tsunami. The majority of the casualties were in the city. More than 31,000 people were confirmed killed in the capital of Banda Aceh alone, the government announced.khaleejtimes.com Over one thousand bodies found on the streets in the provincial capital of Banda Aceh were placed in mass graves without waiting for identification as officials quickly tried to keep the sanitation situation from worsening.  Leupung  Leupung -- sometimes spelt \\"Leupueng\\", is a town in the district (Kabupaten/Kota) of Aceh Besar, close to the city of Banda Aceh, the capital of the special territory of Aceh. The town was completely obliterated by the tsunami. Media reports stated that the tsunami was directed by seaside limestone cliffs towards Leupung, which had a population of ten thousand. According to reports nothing vertical and square-edged is left, and the estimated number of survivors was between 200 and 700.The Guardian  Gleebruk  Gleebruk (SatPixs) is a village in the district (Kabupaten/Kota) of Aceh Besar just to the southwest of Banda Aceh. It was completely destroyed by tsunami.  Teunom  Teunom, a town in the Memphis district of the special territory of Aceh on the island of Sumatra in Indonesia, with a population of about 18,000, was reported to have been damaged so severely that it \\" vanished completely leaving only scattered shards of concrete\\" as a result of the tsunami. Officials estimated 8000 of the 18000 population were dead.abcnews.go.com  Calang  Calang was badly hit by the tsunami. It was the district capital, but little was left remaining. Only about 30 percent of the townspeople survived. Estimates of the population of Calang largely fall between 9,000 and 12,000. The trail of destruction left by the tsunami extended two kilometers inland from the coast. Whole hills were washed away. Welfare Minister Alwi Shihab was quoted as saying that it is likely the town of Calang, north of Meulaboh, would be relocated inland.The Courier Mail  Meulaboh  Landing Craft Air Cushion (LCAC) Hovercraft from USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6) is delivering materials and supplies needed by the citizens of Meulaboh, Indonesia. The town of Meulaboh, which had a population of 120,000 before the tsunami, was struck by a series of waves, killing an estimated 40,000 and destroying most parts of the city, according to relief organizers and local government officials.BBC Approximately 50,000 people lost their homes in the region, local government workers seemed to be overwhelmed and there was little sign of coordination with regional authorities. About 5000 took refuge at Meulaboh College but conditions there became steadily worse. An Indonesian Navy ship bringing aid supplies to Meulaboh was forced to turn away after it was unable to dock because the port facilities were destroyed. The small airport nearby was reopened, enabling small aircraft to land there.BBC; New Zealand Herald  Western islands  Government officials were initially very concerned over the lack of reports from the many small islands dotting the western coast of Sumatra, such as the islands of Simeulue and Nias, among the poorest areas in Indonesia. However, casualties seemed to be comparatively light in comparison to the mainland of Aceh. =Simeulue island = Simeulue was not the tragedy many government officials feared despite its proximity to the quake epicenter. Only five of the 70,000 villagers on Simeulue were killed, all of them in the earthquake that struck at 7:55am last Sunday. Although 90% of the buildings along its coast were destroyed, nobody perished in the five-meter-high walls of water that followed. Local traditions seem to have saved them. Mayor Darmili said villagers on the island were used to earthquakes and tsunamis. A big earthquake last struck in 2002. \\"Thousands of our people were killed by a tsunami in 1907 and we have many earthquakes here,\\" he said. \\"Our ancestors have a saying - if there is an earthquake run for your life.\\"The Age =Nias island= On Nias island official accounts gave the number of dead at 122Media Indonesia Online mediaindo.co.id via the Ministry of Health,depkes.go.id while various unconfirmed sources (mostly from phone calls by relatives living in Jakarta) reported death tolls of over 600; others said the number was more likely to exceed 1000. Reports surfaced that the small islets off the coast of Nias island in the Sirombu district were still relatively intact,The Jakarta Post but high waves still prevented locals from attempting to reach the islands.niasisland.com Confirmation and communications to the islands were further hampered by damage to telecommunication infrastructures, where phone lines were broken and radio networks were been said to be down due to bad weather. This infrastructure damage severely hampered the distribution of aid.  Complications owing to Aceh insurgency  An accurate picture of the damage was made difficult due to the insurgency of the separatist Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian military crackdown which means that there were relatively few journalists, government offices, or aid workers in northern Sumatra prior to the earthquake. On 27 December the government lifted the 18-month-old ban prohibiting foreign journalists and aid workers from travelling to Aceh. Also on 27 December a spokesperson for the Free Aceh Movement declared a ceasefire so humanitarian aid could reach survivors, and so as not to complicate the already devastating situation, however some expressed doubt that there would be good-faith cooperation between the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian military. Despite losing many soldiers to the tsunami, the military retains a massive presence in the region. On 6 January the Indonesian military reported that soldiers had been attacked while on humanitarian missions. The insurgents in turn claimed that the Indonesian military took advantage of the situation. If the clashes continued, it would pose a problem for humanitarian organisations operating outside of the cities near rebel strongholds. Travel restrictions may be put on foreigners again if the conflict restarts. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell warned Indonesia not to use any of the military aid being provided for relief efforts for counterinsurgency efforts.BBC  Effects  Aerial view of new village in Banda Aceh to house people left homeless by the tsunami Indonesian tsunami victims gather under an approaching US helicopter to receive food and supplies. Although Indonesia was the first and worst hit of countries in the region, it was the last to begin receiving relief aid. Two large aftershocks on Wednesday caused many residents, traumatised by their experience, to flee from the coast. Looting of food was reported throughout this northmost province of Sumatra as aid proved slow to arrive. Fifteen thousand troops, who were in the region to fight the insurgency, were dispatched to render assistance and to search for survivors. However, many soldiers and their families were themselves killed. Three days of national mourning were declared. The Indonesian government declared the local provincial Acehnese government as totally crippled (many local politicians based in Banda Aceh were killed when the tsunami struck the city) and declared that all administrative control would be handled directly from Jakarta. The unmanageably high number of corpses strewn all over the cities and countrysides, limited resources and time for identifying bodies, and the very real threat of cholera, diphtheria and other diseases prompted emergency workers to create makeshift mass graves. One of the most urgently required supplies were bodybags.kompas.com There were significant bottlenecks created by lack of infrastructure and red tape. The United Nation's Children's Fund reported on Thursday that aid for 200,000 people, including medical supplies, soap and tarpaulin, was being held at Jakarta for a day to clear customs. The US consul in Medan in southern Sumatra reported that aid there was piling up at the airports of Medan and Banda Aceh because there were not enough trucks to transport it. Eleven days after the disaster few foreign relief workers or supplies reached the local people in local centres such as Meulaboh, Aceh. In the immediate aftermath, one of the most pressing concerns was the inability to distribute sufficient aid due to a lack of accessible roads and a shortage of available helicopters.BBC What little aid reached the remote regions of Aceh province trickled in primarily by boat and air. While the airfield outside Banda Aceh was functioning, most of the other small gravel airfields were damaged by the earthquake and tsunami. In the first days only two airfields were functioning in the province. As most of the few roads in the region were on the coast because of the rugged interior, much of the transport infrastructure was damaged or destroyed. Helicopters and Indonesian navy ships off the coast supplied a small amount of aid. On approach to the Banda Aceh airport, a heavy cargo plane hit a water buffalo which had strayed onto the runway on 4 January 2005. The left side of the plane's undercarriage collapsed, making the plane un-movable blocking the runway for a big part of that day, except for helicopters, until specialists from Singapore put a temporary support under that part of the plane, and men moved the plane off the runway. Four planes carrying aid were sent by Australia and one from the US carrying an evaluation team. An Australian ship carrying helicopters set sail, but did not reach Sumatra until 14 January 2005. A US Navy aircraft carrier battle group centred on USS Abraham Lincoln, dispatched to assist Aceh, began ferrying small amounts of supplies to the remnants of small coastal communities. The US relief operation was based at the Thai base of Utapao. In Aceh some elephants from a wildlife park were used to move debris. (Elephants were also used in Thailand).

Despite its proximity to the epicentre of the earthquake, Malaysia escaped the kind of damage that struck countries hundreds of miles further away. Since the epicentre was on the western coast of Sumatra, the island largely protected the country from the worst of the tsunami. The country's worst affected areas were the northern coastal areas and outlying islands like Penang and Langkawi. The simple red flag warning system used by lifeguards on beaches in some resort areas in Penang was credited to reducing the number of fatalities.

The film features an ensemble cast, starring Jack Nicholson, Patricia Clarkson, Aaron Eckhart, Helen Mirren, Robin Wright Penn, Vanessa Redgrave, Sam Shepard, Mickey Rourke, Lois Smith and Benicio del Toro. It is based on Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt's 1958 novella The Pledge: Requiem for the Detective Novel. D√ºrrenmatt wrote The Pledge to refine the theme he originally developed in the screenplay for the 1958 German film It Happened in Broad Daylight with Heinz R√ºhmann. The film was in competition at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival. Plot Retired police detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is seen mumbling to himself, apparently drunk, sitting on a bench outside a disused gas station. The scene then shifts to events in the recent past. The Department has thrown him a retirement party, and the police captain gives Jerry a fishing trip in Mexico as a gift. The party is interrupted by the discovery of a murdered child, Ginny Larsen. Jerry decides to go with another detective, Stan Krolak (Aaron Eckhart), to the scene of the crime. Jerry delivers the bad news to the child's parents, and the mother Margaret Larsen (Patricia Clarkson) makes Jerry swear on a cross that he will find the killer. A suspect is found the next day. Stan goes in to interview the suspect, Toby Jay Wadenah (Benicio del Toro), a Native American man with mental retardation. During the interview, the man eventually confesses but steals a gun from one of the deputies and commits suicide. To the other detectives, the case is over, but Jerry does not think that Wadenah was the killer. Jerry is adamant about his pledge to find the killer, and does not go on the fishing trip. Instead, he visits the victim's grandmother, who tells him of the many stories that Ginny told. A later visit to one of her friends reveals that Ginny had a friend she called \\"The Giant\\". Jerry sees a picture Ginny drew of \\"The Giant\\", but it does not resemble Wadenah, and includes a black station wagon and not a red truck drove by Wadenah. He takes the drawing with him. Jerry goes to Stan and asks him to reopen the case. Stan refuses but gets Jerry more information about similar cases in the area. Jerry's investigations reveal three unsolved and similar cases that Wadenah could not have committed. Jerry presents his research and Ginny's drawing to Captain Pollack (Sam Shepard) and Stan, who are doubtful. While fishing, Jerry notices a gas station that is located near the center of the similar cases. After buying the gas station, Jerry moves into the house behind it and meets local waitress/bartender Lori (Wright Penn), and her daughter, Chrissy. He becomes a regular and they become friends. One night, Lori shows up at Jerry's house, bruised and battered, and explains her ex (who has a restraining order) attacked her. Jerry suggests for her and her daughter's safety that they move in with him temporarily and she agrees. Jerry slowly becomes a father figure to her daughter and on one night as he is reading bedtime stories to Chrissy, Lori overhears them and goes to her room to cry, presumably realizing how badly she and her daughter needed a good man like this in their life. Jerry later overhears the crying, enters her bedroom to comfort her, and they end up spending the night together, beginning a romance. Soon, Chrissy becomes friends with a local pastor, Gary Jackson (Tom Noonan). Jerry is uncomfortable about this and begins to think Jackson is the killer. Chrissy is shown meeting a man driving a black car with a toy porcupine hanging on the rear mirror, porcupines being another aspect of Ginny's drawing that Jerry believes to be a clue. Chrissy explains to Jerry that she met a 'wizard' who gave her porcupine candies and told her not to tell her parents they had met. She figured it was OK to tell Jerry, since he is not her father. Jerry realizes this is likely to be the killer and, using Chrissy as bait, stages an operation with Stan's help to catch him. The viewers are shown that the car with the toy porcupine hanging from the rear- view mirror has been destroyed in a fiery collision with a freight truck. After hours of waiting, Stan and the other police leave. They tell Lori what happened, and she confronts Jerry angrily about putting her daughter in danger. Some time later, reprising the first images shown at the beginning, Jerry sits alone on a bench in front of the ruined gas station. Despondent, destitute and drunk, Jerry ends up all alone, mumbling to himself that the killer is still out there.

His major works include the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow.  Early life  Konstantin, born in St. Petersburg to the family of a German jeweller, was one of three Thon brothers who all rose to become notable architects. He studied at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1803‚Äì15) under the Empire Style architect Andrey Voronikhin, best remembered for his work on the Kazan Cathedral, situated right in the middle of the Nevsky Prospekt. He studied Italian art in Rome from 1819 to 1828, and on his return home was admitted to the academy as its member (1830) and professor (1833). In 1854, he was appointed rector of the architectural division of the academy. Thon first attracted public attention with his sumptuous design for the interiors of the Academy building on the Neva embankment. In 1827, he submitted to the tsar his project of St Catherine church at the Obvodnyi Canal, the first ever design in the Russian Revival style. Nicholas I, who felt disaffected with the prevailing Neoclassicism of Russian architecture, remarked that \\"Russians have their own great art traditions and don't need to cringe before Rome\\". Thon's project was to become a revered model for other churches in St Petersburg and across Russia.  Russian-Byzantine Revival  Russia-Moscow-Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in 1902 In 1830, Thon completed his most ambitious design to date, that of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. The Russian-Byzantine Revival style of his project, intended to underline similarity of the new church with old cathedrals of the Moscow Kremlin, displeased many of his fellows, who wanted to see the cathedral built in the severe Neoclassical style. Nevertheless, the emperor personally approved his design. Thon and his disciples continued to work on the cathedral for the next 50 years, until the master's death in 1881. Annunciation church in St. Petersburg (1843‚Äì49). In 1836‚Äì42, Thon supervised the construction of another ponderous church with a spacious interior, that of Presentation to the Temple for the Semenovsky regiment in St Petersburg. He followed this with dozens of Neo-Russian- Byzantine designs for churches and cathedrals in provincial towns, including Sveaborg, Yelets, Tomsk, Rostov-on-Don, and Krasnoyarsk. Some of his revivalist projects were assembled in the Model Album for Church Designs (1836). From 1838 to 1851, Thon was employed in construction of the Neo- Russian Grand Kremlin Palace and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow. The grandiose palace, famed for opulent interiors of its 700 rooms and halls, was meant to symbolize the grandeur of the Russian state. It was a daring design which incorporated parts of earlier structures that had been standing on the spot. The palace has served successively as an official residence for the Russian tsars, Soviet rulers, and the Presidents of the Russian Federation. At the same time, Thon rehabilitated the abandoned Izmaylovo Estate into an almshouse for the veterans of the Napoleonic Wars.  Later years  Thon's last important commissions were the Nikolaevsky railway stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg (1849‚Äì51). In his design for the stations the architect implemented some of the newest construction technologies. Despite large pieces of steelwork used in the construction, Venetian facades and medieval clock towers of the stations cleverly masked their modern function. Both structures, although extensively reconstructed, are still standing. After the death of his patron, the Emperor, Thon's failing health prevented him from working on other projects apart from the great cathedral in Moscow. He died at St. Petersburg in 1881. Even during his lifetime, the more radical of his contemporaries, such as Alexander Herzen, dismissed his architecture as \\"reactionary manifestation of the tyrant's rule\\". The Soviet authorities, labelling Thon's churches ugly chests of drawers, systematically destroyed as many of them as possible, including all his churches in St Petersburg and vicinity and the work of his life, the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour. The fall of the Soviet rule in 1991 brought about a renewed interest in the work of the Neo-Russian- Byzantine master.

Coastal and rural communities in Somalia, as far as from the epicentre of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, 10,000 km of Somalia was swept away or destroyed by the resulting tsunami on 26 December 2004. As of 5 January 2005, the confirmed death toll stood at 298. According to presidential spokesperson Yusuf Mohamed Ismail of the Transitional Federal Government, more than 50,000 people were also displaced Impact Most of the damage was centered in the coastal parts of the autonomous Puntland state in northeastern Somalia, particularly the area between Hafun in the Bari region and Garacad in Mudug. The narrow and low-lying peninsula of Hafun, northeast of Mogadishu, was especially affected. In Puntland, rising waters destroyed properties in Hafun and Kulub, while parts of the towns and hamlets of Bander Beyla, Eyl, Foar and Bargaal were flooded. Other coastal areas, including Lower Juba, were also somewhat affected. The UN reported that the waves destroyed 1,180 homes, smashed 2,400 boats and rendered freshwater wells and reservoirs unusable. The village of Kulub, near Garacad, was still partially submerged as of 6 January. At Kulub, Hurdiye and other places, teams from the WFP reported that all the boats and other fishing equipment used by the residents to make a livelihood had been lost. Aftermath On 30 December, around 12 tons of rice, maize and vegetable oil were delivered to Hafun, four days after the tsunami. Previous attempts to deliver emergency relief failed after trucks were unable to pass tsunami damaged roads near Foar, a village of 1000 people which had been destroyed. The main sand bridge which connects the Hafun peninsula to the mainland was damaged, so the twelve tonnes were then transferred onto two four-wheel drive vehicles that managed the trip from Foar to Hafun in seven hours. The UN warned that the tsunami had worsened the situation after four years of drought in northern Somalia and that further aid was required. It distributed 200 tonnes of food rations to 12,000 people, but stated that 30,000 was the target. The UN had four teams in the area and on 4 January appealed for US$13,000,000 to assist 54,000 locals affected by the tsunami.

There are mentions in Medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. King Robert I (1274‚Äì1329, reigned 1306‚Äì1329), developed naval power to counter the English in the Wars of Independence (1296‚Äì1328), and after the establishment of Scottish independence continued to build up naval capacity. In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers. King James I (1394‚Äì1437, reigned 1406‚Äì1437), took a greater interest in naval power establishing a shipbuilding yard at Leith and probably created the office of Lord High Admiral. King James IV (1473‚Äì1513, reigned 1488‚Äì1513), put the enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven, near Edinburgh and a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. He acquired a total of 38 ships including Great Michael, at that time, the largest ship in Europe. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king on his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea, but were sold after the Flodden campaign. Thereafter Scottish naval efforts would rely on privateering captains and hired merchantmen. Despite truces between England and Scotland there were periodic outbreaks of a guerre de course. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542. The chief use of naval power in his reign was a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. The Union of Crowns in 1603 ended Scottish conflict with England, but Scotland's involvement in England's foreign policy opened up Scottish merchantmen to attack from privateers. In 1626, a squadron of three ships were bought and equipped for protection and there were several marque fleets of privateers. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and privateers participated in the Siege of Saint-Martin-de-Re with a major expedition to the Bay of Biscay. The Scots also returned to the West Indies and in 1629 took part in the capture of Quebec. After the Bishop's Wars and the alliance with Parliament in the English Civil War, a \\"Scotch Guard\\" was established on the coast of Scotland of largely English ships, but with Scottish revenues and men, gradually becoming a more Scottish force. The Scottish naval forces were defeated by Oliver Cromwell's navy and when Scotland became part of the Commonwealth in 1653, they were absorbed into the Commonwealth navy. After the Restoration Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the English Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs. Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime. In the Second (1665‚Äì1667) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672‚Äì1674) between 80 and 120 captains took Scottish letters of marque and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict. In the 1690s, a small fleet of five ships was established by merchants for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy of three warships was established to protect local shipping in 1696. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels and their crews were transferred to the British Royal Navy. Origins A carving of a birlinn from a sixteenth-century tombstone in MacDufie's Chapel, Oronsay, as engraved in 1772 By the late Middle Ages the kingdom of Scotland participated in two related maritime traditions. In the West was the tradition of galley warfare that had its origins in the Viking thalassocracies (sea- based lordships) of the Highlands and Islands and which stretched back before that to the sea power of D√°l Riata that had spanned the Irish Sea. In the east it participated in the common northern European sail-driven naval tradition.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660-1649 (London: Penguin, 2004), , pp. 166-7. The key to the Viking success was the long-ship, a long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull designed for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also double-ended, the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around.\\"Skuldelev 2 ‚Äì The great longship\\", Viking Ship Museum, Roskilde, retrieved 25 February 2012.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660-1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 13-14. The longship was gradually succeeded by (in ascending order of size) the birlinn, highland galley and lymphad,S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513-1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 2-3. which, were clinker-built ships, usually with a centrally-stepped mast, but also with oars that allowed them to be rowed. Like the longship, they had a high stem and stern, and were still small and light enough to be dragged across portages, but they replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century.\\"Highland Galleys\\" Mallaig Heritage Centre, retrieved 25 February 2012. The major naval power in the Highlands and Islands were the MacDonald Lord of the Isles, who acted as largely independent kings and could raise large fleets for use even against their nominal overlord the King of Scots. They succeeded in playing off the king of Scotland against the kings of Norway and, after 1266, the king of England. There are mentions in Medieval records of fleets commanded by Scottish kings including William the LionP. F. Tytler, History of Scotland, Volume 2 (London: Black, 1829), pp. 309-10. and Alexander II. The latter took personal command of a large naval force which sailed from the Firth of Clyde and anchored off the island of Kerrera in 1249, intended to transport his army in a campaign against the Kingdom of the Isles, but he died before the campaign could begin.J. Hunter, Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (London: Random House, 2011), , pp. 106‚Äì111.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 147. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the thirteenth century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters. These included king Hakon Hakonsson's Krists√∫√∞in, built at Bergen from 1262-3, which was long, of 37 rooms.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660-1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , pp. 74-5. In 1263 Hakon responded to Alexander III's designs on the Hebrides by personally leading a major fleet of forty vessels, including Krists√∫√∞in, to the islands, where they were swelled by local allies to as many as 200 ships.P. J. Potter, Gothic Kings of Britain: the Lives of 31 Medieval Rulers, 1016-1399 (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2008), , p. 157. Records indicate that Alexander had several large oared ships built at Ayr, but he avoided a sea battle. Defeat on land at the Battle of Largs and winter storms forced the Norwegian fleet to return home, leaving the Scottish crown as the major power in the region and leading to the ceding of the Western Isles to Alexander in 1266.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 153. Andrew Wood's flagship, The Yellow Carvel, in action, from a children's history book (1906) English naval power was vital to King Edward I's successful campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland and his allies in the Islands to transport and supply his armies.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660-1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 74-90. Part of the reason for Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing King Edward II to attempt the relief that resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318. After the establishment of Scottish independence, King Robert I turned his attention to building up a Scottish naval capacity. This was largely focused on the west coast, with the Exchequer Rolls of 1326 recording the feudal duties of his vassals in that region to aid him with their vessels and crews. Towards the end of his reign he supervised the building of at least one royal man-of-war near his palace at Cardross on the River Clyde. In the late fourteenth century naval warfare with England was conducted largely by hired Scots, Flemish and French merchantmen and privateers.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i-xii. King James I of Scotland (1394-1437, reigned 1406‚Äì1437), took a greater interest in naval power. After his return to Scotland in 1424, he established a shipbuilding yard at Leith, a house for marine stores, and a workshop. King's ships were built and equipped there to be used for trade as well as war, one of which accompanied him on his expedition to the Islands in 1429. The office of Lord High Admiral was probably founded in this period. It would soon become a hereditary office, in the control of the Earls of Bothwell in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and the Earls of Lennox in the seventeenth century.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513-1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 10. King James II (1430-1460, reigned 1437‚Äì1460) is known to have purchased a caravel by 1449. Around 1476 the Scottish merchant John Barton received letters of marque that allowed him to gain compensation for the capture of his vessels by the Portuguese by capturing ships under their colours. These letters would be repeated to his three sons John, Andrew and Robert, who would play a major part in the Scottish naval effort into the sixteenth century.E. P. Statham, Privateers and Privateering (Cambridge University Press, 2011), , pp. 19-20. In his struggles with his nobles in 1488 James III (r. 1451‚Äì88) received assistance from his two warships Flower and King's Carvel also known as Yellow Carvel, commanded by Andrew Wood of Largo. After the king's death Wood served his son James IV (r. 1488-1513), defeating an English incursion into the Forth by five English ships in 1489 and three more heavily armed English ships off the mouth of the River Tay the next year.N. Tranter, The Story of Scotland (Neil Wilson, 2012), . Sixteenth century=James IV the Great Michael, the largest ship in the world when launched in 1511 James IV put the naval enterprise on a new footing, founding a harbour at Newhaven in May 1504, and two years later ordering the construction of a dockyard at the Pools of Airth. The upper reaches of the Forth were protected by new fortifications on Inchgarvie.N. Macdougall, James IV (Tuckwell, 1997), , p. 235. Scottish ships had some success against privateers, accompanied the king in his expeditions in the islands and intervened in conflicts in Scandinavia and the Baltic Sea.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913‚Äì14), pp. i-xii. Expeditions to the Highlands to Islands to curb the power of the MacDonald Lord of the Isles were largely ineffective until in 1504 the king accompanied a squadron under Wood heavily armed with artillery, which battered the MacDonald strongholds into submission. Since some of these island fortresses could only be attacked from seaward, naval historian N. A. M. Rodger has suggested this may have marked the end of medieval naval warfare in the British Isles, ushering in a new tradition of artillery warfare. The king acquired a total of 38 ships for the Royal Scottish Navy, including Margaret, and the carrack Michael or Great Michael, the largest warship of its time (1511).T. Christopher Smout, Scotland and the Sea (Edinburgh: Rowman and Littlefield, 1992), , p. 45. The latter, built at great expense at Newhaven and launched in 1511, was in length, weighed 1,000 tons, had 24 cannon, and was, at that time, the largest ship in Europe.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 33-4. It marked a shift in designed as it was designed specifically to carry a main armament of heavy artillery. In the Flodden campaign the fleet consisted of 16 large and 10 smaller craft. After a raid on Carrickfergus in Ireland, it joined up with the French and had little impact on the war. After the disaster at Flodden the Great Michael, and perhaps other ships, were sold to the French and the king's ships disappeared from royal records after 1516. Scottish naval efforts would again rely on privateering captains and hired merchantmen during the minority of James V. In the Habsburg-Valois war of 1521‚Äì26, in which England and Scotland became involved on respective sides, the Scots had six men-of-war active attacking English and Imperial shipping and they blockaded the Humber in 1523. Although prizes were taken by Robert Barton and other captains, the naval campaign was sporadic and indecisive.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 36-7. Privateers Scots privateers and pirates preyed upon shipping in the North Sea and off the Atlantic coast of France. Scotland's Admiralty court judged whether a captured ship was a lawful prize and dealt with the recovery of goods. As the court was entitled to a tenth of the value of a prize, it was a profitable business for the admiral. The privateers Andrew and Robert Barton were still using their letters of reprisal of 1506 against the Portuguese in 1561. The Bartons operated down the east coast of Britain from Leven and the Firth of Forth, while others used the French Channel ports such as Rouen and Dieppe or the Atlantic port of Brest as bases.J. E. A. Dawson, Scotland Re-Formed, 1488‚Äì1587 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 181-2. In 1507 Robert Barton with Lion took a Portuguese ship, but was detained by the Dutch authorities at Veere for piracy. James IV managed to engineer his release, but in 1509 John Barton with Lion took a Portuguese vessel that was carrying Portuguese and English goods. In 1511 Andrew Barton headed south with Jennet Purwyn and another ship to continue the private war, and took prizes that he claimed were Portuguese, but contained English goods. He was intercepted in the English Downs by Lord Thomas Howard and Sir Edward Howard. Barton was killed and his two ships captured and transferred to the English navy.S.

James V The captured Salamander, in the English Anthony Roll James V entered his majority in 1524. He did not share his father's interest in developing a navy, relying on French gifts such as Salamander, or captured ships like the English Mary Willoughby. Scotland's shipbuilding remained largely at the level of boat building and ship repairs and fell behind the Low Countries which led the way into semi-industrialised ship building. Despite truces between England and Scotland there were periodic outbreaks of a guerre de course in the 1530s with at least four of a known six men-at-war were royal naval vessels on the Scottish side.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 39. James V built a new harbour at Burntisland in 1542, called 'Our Lady Port' or 'New Haven,' described in 1544 as having three blockhouses with guns and a pier for great ships to lie in a dock.T. Andrea, The Princelie Majestie: The Court of James V of Scotland 1528‚Äì1542 (Birlinn, 2005), , p. 164. The chief employment of naval power in his reign was in a series of expeditions to the Isles and France. In 1536 the king circumnavigated the Isles, embarking at Pittenweem in Fife and landing Whithorn in Galloway.J. Cameron, James V (Tuckwell, 1998), , p. 239. Later in the year he sailed from Kirkcaldy with six ships including the 600 ton Mary Willoughby, and arrived at Dieppe to begin his courtship of his first wife Madeleine of Valois.J. Cameron, James V (Tuckwell, 1998), , pp. 152-53. After his marriage he sailed from Le Havre in Mary Willoughby to Leith with four great Scottish ships and ten French. After the death of Queen Madeleine, John Barton, in Salamander returned to France in 1538 to pick up the new queen, Mary of Guise, with Moriset and Mary Willoughby.A. Thomas, Princelie Majestie: The Court of James V of Scotland 1528‚Äì1542 (Birlinn, 2005), pp. 158-9. In 1538 James V embarked on the newly equipped Salamander at Leith and accompanied by Mary Willoughby, Great Unicorn, Little Unicorn, Lion and twelve other ships sailed to Kirkwall on Orkney. Then he went to Lewis in the West, perhaps using the newly compiled charts from his first voyage known as Alexander Lindsay's Rutter.J. E. A.

During the Rough Wooing, the attempt to force a marriage between James V's heir Mary, Queen of Scots and Henry VIII's son, the future Edward VI, in 1542, Mary Willoughby, Lion, and Salamander under the command of John Barton, son of Robert Barton, attacked merchants and fishermen off Whitby. They later blockaded a London merchant ship called Antony of Bruges in a creek on the coast of Brittany.M. Merriman, The Rough Wooings (Tuckwell, 2000), p. 181.

When, as a result of the series of international treaties, Charles V declared war upon Scotland in 1544, the Scots were able to engage in a highly profitable campaign of privateering that lasted six years and the gains of which probably outweighed the losses in trade with the Low Countries.

In 1547 Edward Clinton's invasion fleet of 60 ships, 35 of them warships, supported the English advance into Scotland. The naval superiority of the English fleet was demonstrated when The Mary Willoughby was recaptured, along with Bosse and an English prize, Anthony of Newcastle, without opposition off Blackness. In successive campaigns the Scots had lost all four of their royal ships. They would have to rely on privateers until the re-establishment of a royal fleet in the 1620s.S.

However, as the English fleet retreated for winter, the remaining Scots ships began to pick off stragglers and unwary English merchantmen. In June 1548 the situation was transformed by the arrival of a French squadron of three warships, 16 galleys and transports carrying 6,000 men. The English lost Pansy in an engagement with the galley fleet and their strategic situation began to deteriorate on land and sea, and the Treaty of Boulogne (1550) marked the end of the Rough Wooing and opened up a period of French dominance of Scottish affairs.S.

When Anglo-Scottish relations deteriorated again in 1557 as part of a wider war between Spain and France, small ships called 'shallops' were noted between Leith and France, passing as fishermen, but bringing munitions and money. Private merchant ships were rigged at Leith, Aberdeen and Dundee as men-of-war, and the regent Mary of Guise claimed English prizes, one over 200 tons, for her fleet.John Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 3, part 2 (Oxford, 1822), p. 81. The re-fitted Mary Willoughby sailed with 11 other ships against Scotland in August 1557, landing troops and six field guns on Orkney to attack the Kirkwall Castle, St Magnus Cathedral and the Bishop's Palace. The English were repulsed by a Scottish force numbering 3000, and the English vice-admiral Sir John Clere of Ormesby was killed, but none of the English ships were lost.John Strype, Ecclesiastical Memorials, vol. 3 part 2 (Oxford, 1822), pp. 67-9, 86-87, and G.

When the Protestant Elizabeth I came to the throne of England in 1558, the English party and the Protestants found their positions aligned and the Protestants asked for English military support to expel the French.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470-1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 115-17. In 1559, English captain William Winter was sent north with 34 ships and dispersed and captured the Scottish and French fleets, leading to the siege of the French forces in Leith, the eventual evacuation of the French from Scotland,N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain 660-1649 (London: Penguin UK, 2004), , p. 197. and a successful coup of the Protestant Lords of the Congregation.

Marian Civil War After Mary, Queen of Scots was captured at the battle of Carberry Hill, the Earl of Bothwell took ship to Shetland. The Privy Council sent William Kirkcaldy of Grange and William Murray of Tullibardine in pursuit in August 1567. Some of their ships came from Dundee, including James, Primrose, and Robert.John Hill Burton, Register of the Privy Council of Scotland: 1545-1569, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1877), p. 544. They encountered Bothwell in Bressay Sound near Lerwick. Four of Bothwell's ships in the Sound set sail north to Unst, where Bothwell was negotiating with German captains to hire more ships. Kirkcaldy's flagship, Lion, chased one of Bothwell's ships, and both ships were damaged on a submerged rock.Register of the Privy Seal of Scotland, vol. 8 (Edinburgh, 1982), pp. 66-67, no. 397: Guy, John, Queen of Scots, the True Life (2005) p. 360. Bothwell sent his treasure ship to Scalloway, and fought a three-hour-long sea battle off the Port of Unst, where the mast of one of Bothwell's ships was shot away. Subsequently, a storm forced him to sail towards Norway.Strickland, Agnes, ed., Letters of Mary Queen of Scots, vol. 1 (London, 1842), pp. 244-248: Reid, David ed., Hume of Godscroft's History of the House of Angus, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 2005), p. 171. When Mary's supporters, led by Kirkcaldy, held Edinburgh Castle in April 1573, prolonging civil war in Scotland, the guns from Stirling Castle were brought to Leith in four boats. Regent Morton hired two ships in Leith with their masters John Cockburn and William Downy and 80 men for eight days. These masters of Leith sailed to Berwick upon Tweed to meet and convoy the English ships carrying the guns to bombard Edinburgh Castle.Accounts of the Lord High Treasurer, vol. 12 (Edinburgh (1970), 344. James VI goes to Denmark James VI hired ships for his ambassadors and other uses, and in 1588 James Royall of Ayr, belonging to Robert Jameson, was fitted out for Sir William Stewart of Carstairs to pursue the rebel Lord Maxwell with 120 musketeers or \\"hagbutters\\". In October 1589 James VI decided to sail to Norway to meet his bride Anne of Denmark. His courtiers, led by the Chancellor of Scotland John Maitland of Thirlestane equipped a fleet of six ships.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 3 (London, 1889), p. 438. Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch hired Falcon of Leith from John Gibson, described as a little ship.Robert Vans-Agnew, Correspondence of Sir Robert Waus of Barnbarroch, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 447, 452-3. Maitland's expenses detail the preparation of James Royall hired from Robert Jameson, which was equipped with cannon by the Comptroller of Ordinance John Chisholm for the use of the royal gunner James Rocknow, usually based at Edinburgh Castle. The guns were probably intended for firing salutes. The sails of James were decorated with red taffeta. James VI sent Robert Dog from Denmark to L√ºbeck to buy gunpowder which he shipped to Edinburgh castle.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 29, 37: John Mackenzie, A chronicle of the kings of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 142 James VI sent orders from Denmark to the town of Edinburgh requesting the council hire a ship for his return.

Seventeenth century=Royal and marque fleets The Red Ensign flown on a mid-17thC Scottish merchant ship. An exhibit in the National Museum of Scotland. After the Union of Crowns in 1603 conflict between Scotland and England ended, but Scotland found itself involved in England's foreign policy, opening up Scottish shipping to attack. In the 1620s, Scotland found herself fighting a naval war as England's ally, first against Spain and then also against France, while simultaneously embroiled in undeclared North Sea commitments in the Danish intervention in the Thirty Years' War. In 1626 a squadron of three ships was bought and equipped, at a cost of least ¬£5,200 sterling, to guard against privateers operating out of Spanish-controlled Dunkirk and other ships were armed in preparation for potential action. The acting High Admiral John Gordon of Lochinvar organised as many as three marque fleets of privateers.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 169. It was probably one of Lochinvar's marque fleets that was sent to support the English Royal Navy in defending Irish waters in 1626.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 168. In 1627, the Royal Scots Navy and accompanying contingents of burgh privateers participated in the major expedition to Biscay.R. B. Manning, An Apprenticeship in Arms: The Origins of the British Army 1585‚Äì1702 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), , p. 118. The Scots also returned to the West Indies, with Lochinvar taking French prizes and founding the colony of Charles Island. In 1629 two squadrons of privateers led by Lochinvar and William Lord Alexander, sailed for Canada, taking part in the campaign that resulted in the capture of Quebec from the French, which was handed back after the subsequent peace.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 174. Covenanter navies During the Bishops' Wars (1639‚Äì40) the king attempted to blockade Scotland and disrupt trade and the transport of returning troops from the continent. The king planned amphibious assaults from England on the East coast and from Ireland to the West, but they failed to materialise.J. S. Wheeler, The Irish and British Wars, 1637‚Äì1654: Triumph, Tragedy, and Failure (London: Routledge, 2002), , pp. 19-21. Scottish privateers took a number of English prizes and the Covenanters planned to fit out Dutch ships with Scottish and Dutch crews to join the naval war effort.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , p. 198. After the Covenanters allied with the English Parliament they established two patrol squadrons for the Atlantic and North Sea coasts, known collectively as the \\"Scotch Guard\\". These patrols guarded against Royalist attempts to move men, money and munitions and raids on Scottish shipping, particularly from the Irish Confederate fleet at Wexford and royalist forces at Dunkirk. They consisted mainly of small English warships, controlled by the Commissioners of the Navy based in London, but it always relied heavily on Scottish officers and revenues, and after 1646 the West Coast squadron became much more a Scottish force.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare, 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 204-10. The Scottish navy was easily overcome by the English fleet that accompanied the army led by Oliver Cromwell that conquered Scotland in 1649‚Äì51 and after his victory the Scottish ships and crews were divided among the Commonwealth fleet.S.

Restoration navy Painting of a Scottish ship, perhaps part of the Darien fleet, by an unknown artist Although Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment thanks to Charles II, a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs during the second half of the seventeenth century.D. Brunsman, The Evil Necessity: British Naval Impressment in the Eighteenth-Century Atlantic World (University of Virginia Press, 2013), . Royal Navy patrols were now found in Scottish waters even in peacetime, such as the small ship-of-the-line HMS Kingfisher, which bombarded Carrick Castle during the Earl of Argyll's rebellion in 1685.A.

Scotland went to war against the Dutch and their allies in the Second (1665‚Äì67) and Third Anglo-Dutch Wars (1672‚Äì74) as an independent kingdom. A very large number of Scottish captains, at least as many as 80 and perhaps 120, took letters of marque, and privateers played a major part in the naval conflict of the wars.S. Murdoch, The Terror of the Seas?: Scottish Maritime Warfare 1513‚Äì1713 (Leiden: Brill, 2010), , pp. 239-41. By 1697 the English Royal Navy had 323 warships, while Scotland was still dependent on merchantman and privateers. In the 1690s, two separate schemes for larger naval forces were put in motion. As usual, the larger part was played by the merchant community rather than the government. The first was the Darien Scheme to found a Scottish colony in Spanish controlled America. It was undertaken by the Company of Scotland, who created a fleet of five ships, including Caledonia and St. Andrew, all built or chartered in Holland and Hamburg. It sailed to the Isthmus of Darien in 1698, but the venture failed and only one ship returned to Scotland.A. I. MacInnes and A. H. Williamson, eds., Shaping the Stuart World, 1603‚Äì1714: The Atlantic Connection (Brill, 2006), , p. 349. In the same period it was decided to establish a professional navy for the protection of commerce in home waters during the Nine Years' War (1688‚Äì97) with France, with three purpose-built warships bought from English shipbuilders in 1696. These were Royal William, a 32-gun fifth rate and two smaller ships, Royal Mary and Dumbarton Castle, each of 24 guns, generally described as frigates. After the Act of Union in 1707, the Scottish Navy merged with that of England. The office of Lord High Admiral was subsumed within the office of the Admiral of Great Britain. The three vessels of the small Royal Scottish Navy were transferred to the Royal Navy.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913‚Äì14), p. 48. A number of Scottish officers eventually left the Royal Navy for service in the fledgling Russian navy of Peter the Great. These included the captain of Royal Mary Thomas Gordon, who became a commodore in 1717 took service and rose to be Admiral and commander-in-chief of the Baltic Fleet.R.

The bibliography provided by Rodger is considerable, and includes works on the Early and High Medieval periods. The second volume of Rodger's history, The Command of the Ocean (2004), offers comparatively little coverage of Scotland. Norman Macdougall, James IV (1989) is the standard life of the king most important to the history of the Royal Scots Navy, and does not stint on naval coverage. Works such as R.

The agricultural sector was affected seriously. 259 km¬≤ of paddy land was destroyed in the northern, eastern, southern and western coastal belts. In addition, the extensive salinization of paddy lands rendered them unsuitable for paddy cultivation. Rubbish was also deposited on paddy lands. A large number of agricultural vehicles and equipment were destroyed and canals and drains were blocked. Underground sources of water were salinated.

The main coastal highway in the south of Sri Lanka was closed in the aftermath of the tsunami, delaying relief supplies. An initial effort to deliver supplies was made by large numbers of private individuals filling their own vans and pickup trucks with food, clothing and bottled water and driving to affected areas. Reports of measles and diarrhoea reached authorities, renewing fears of a deadly epidemic. Relief operations were based in Colombo. On the morning of Thursday December 30, 2004, the Indian government erroneously warned of another possible tsunami. The false alarm caused general panic in relief camps and incited traffic jams on roads leading from the coast. The science fiction author and scuba diver Sir Arthur C Clarke, who lived in Colombo, the capital, issued a statement saying that Sri Lanka \\"lacks the resources and capacity to cope with the aftermath\\". Clarke reported that his family and staff were safe, \\"even though some are badly shaken and relate harrowing first hand accounts of what happened\\", and that his diving school (Arthur C.

The book, consisting primarily of a random number table, was an important 20th century work in the field of statistics and random numbers. It was produced starting in 1947 by an electronic simulation of a roulette wheel attached to a computer, the results of which were then carefully filtered and tested before being used to generate the table. The RAND table was an important breakthrough in delivering random numbers, because such a large and carefully prepared table had never before been available. In addition to being available in book form, one could also order the digits on a series of punched cards. The table is formatted as 400 pages, each containing 50 lines of 50 digits. Columns and lines are grouped in fives, and the lines are numbered 00000 through 19999. The standard normal deviates are another 200 pages (10 per line, lines 0000 through 9999), with each deviate given to three decimal places. There are 28 additional pages of front matter. The main use of the tables was in statistics and the experimental design of scientific experiments, especially those that used the Monte Carlo method; in cryptography, they have also been used as nothing up my sleeve numbers, for example in the design of the Khafre cipher. The book was one of the last of a series of random number tables produced from the mid-1920s to the 1950s, after which the development of high-speed computers allowed faster operation through the generation of pseudorandom numbers rather than reading them from tables. The book was reissued in 2001 () with a new foreword by RAND Executive Vice President Michael D. Rich. It has generated many humorous user reviews on Amazon.com.

The Otoe language, Chiwere, is part of the Siouan family and closely related to that of the related Iowa and Missouri tribes. Historically, the Otoe Tribe lived as a semi-nomadic people on the Central Plains along the bank of the Missouri River in Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri. They lived in elm-bark lodges while they farmed, and used tipis while traveling, like many other Plains tribes. They often left their villages to hunt buffalo. In the early 19th century, many of their villages were destroyed due to warfare with other tribes. European-American encroachment and disease also played a role in their decline. Today, they are federally recognized as the Otoe tribes of Oklahoma, and share a reservation with the Sac and Fox people. History Historical tribal territory of the Otoe in green; present-day reservations in orange. The Otoe were once part of the Siouan tribes of the Great Lakes region, a group commonly known as the Winnebago. At some point, a large group split off and began to migrate to the South and West. This group eventually split again, coalescing into at least three distinct tribes: the Ioway, the Missouria and the Otoe. The Otoe settled in the lower Nemaha River valley. They adopted the horse culture and semi-nomadic lifestyle of the Great Plains, making the American bison central to their diet and culture. European contact When the Lewis and Clark Expedition headed up the Missouri River to explore the new territory the Otoe were the first tribe they encountered. They met at a place on the west bank of the Missouri River that would become known as the Council Bluff.Page 47, Lewis & Clark: The Journey of the Corps of Discovery, by Dayton Duncan, Pimlico (1998), 249 pages Like other Great Plains tribes, the Otoe periodically left their villages to hunt for buffalo. Between 1817 and 1841, the Otoe lived around the mouth of the Platte River in present-day Nebraska. Otoe County, Nebraska still bears their name. During this time, the remaining families of the Missouria rejoined them. They gathered with others to trade for European goods. In the 1830s, the tribe was noted to have problems with alcohol, which was widely dispensed by traders. Some Otoe would trade vital supplies for alcohol, to the point of becoming destitute. As their dependence on alcohol grew, the men no longer hunted, but resorted to looting vacant Pawnee villages while the people were out hunting.Page 200, The Pawnee Indians, by George Hyde, University of Oklahoma Press (1988) (first published 1951, revised edition 1974), trade paperback, 372 pages Christian missionaries built a mission there. In 1854 the Otoe- Missouria ceded most of their lands south of the Platte River in eastern Nebraska to the U.S. by treaty. They retained the Oto Reservation along the Big Blue River on the present Kansas-Nebraska border. They struggled to adapt to reservation life. Move to Indian Territory Otoe delegation, 1881. Photographer John K. Hillers Otoe-Missouria Tribe Seal During the 1870s, the tribe split into two factions. The Coyote band favored an immediate move to Indian Territory, where they believed they could better perpetuate their traditional tribal life outside the influence of the whites. The Quaker band favored remaining on the Big Blue River land. They were willing to sell the western half of the reservation to whites to gain income for a tribal annuity. By the spring of 1880, about half the tribe had left the reservation and taken up residence with the Sac and Fox Nation in Indian Territory. By the next year, in response to dwindling prospects of self-sufficiency and continued pressure from white settlers, the remaining Otoe members in Nebraska sold the Big Blue reservation. They migrated to Oklahoma. With the Otoe-Missouria already there, they purchased a new reservation in the Cherokee Outlet in the Indian Territory. This is in present-day Noble and Pawnee Counties, Oklahoma. Today the Otoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians is federally recognized. It is based in Red Rock, Oklahoma.

Biography Mary Ann Vincent was born in Portsmouth, England on September 18, 1818, the daughter of an Irishman named Farlin. Left an orphan at an early age, she turned to the stage, making her first appearance in 1834 as Lucy in The Review, at Cowes, Isle of Wight. The next year she married James R. Vincent (who died in 1850), an actor with whom she toured England and Ireland for several years. In 1846, the then Mrs Vincent went to America to join the stock company of the old National Theatre in Boston, where she became a great favourite. The National Theatre burned in 1852, and thenceforth, until her death, on September 4, 1887, Mrs. Vincent was connected with the company at the Boston Museum. Vincent Memorial Hospital Her memory is still honoured by the Vincent Memorial Hospital, founded in Boston in 1890 by popular subscription, and which was formally opened on April 6, 1891, by Bishop Phillips Brooks, as a hospital for wage-earning women and girls. The hospital is now part of Massachusetts General Hospital.

Dramatic works by the composer were his best-known, such as the incidental music for the play Tambour and the opera Ouanga. During the first decades of the twentieth century, White was considered the foremost black violinist. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Early years Born in Clarksville, Tennessee to James W. White, a doctor and school principal, and Jennie Scott White, a violinist who studied at Oberlin Conservatory of Music. His father died when he was only two years old. White relocated with his mother and younger brother to Oberlin, Ohio to live with her parents, where he was first exposed to the violin: My mother took me to hear The Messiah sung at the conservatory and I came away humming snatches of it. Mother thought I had a good musical ear and persuaded my grandfather, who was a religious man, to give me his violin...I was only six at the time, nevertheless, my grandfather pouted, \\"I'll give him the violin. But if he ever plays at a dance I'll take it back.\\" In 1890, Mrs. White remarried and White relocated with his family to Washington D.C., whose black communities had rich and active music scenes. Two years later, White met the violinist and composer Will Marion Cook, resulting from White falling asleep during Cook's recital: One evening my mother took me to hear the pupils of Mrs. Alice Strange Davis, the most renowned piano teacher in Washington...I was especially anxious to hear Will Marion Cook play the violin. He...was to play a number toward the end of the program. As usual a program by pupils is rather a long-drawn-out affair, so by the time for Cook's number I had fallen asleep. I was awakened by a tremendous applause after his solo. When I was told that he had played I burst out crying and made such a fuss that my mother had to hustle me out of the concert and I went home in disgrace. Cook inquired about the upset young boy and offered to give White violin lessons in the summer of 1892, an experience that had a profound effect on White: \\"Every lesson was one of pure joy, and it was during this period that I definitely made up my mind to be a violinist.\\" Education White continued his private studies in 1894 with Joseph Douglass, another notable black violinist and grandson of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, at Howard University. He attended Oberlin Conservatory of Music 1896-1901, the alma mater of his parents, where he studied with Frederick Doolittle, Cook's former violin teacher. White left in 1901 before graduating to accept a teaching position in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that fell through after one month. Shortly thereafter he won a violin scholarship through the Hartford School of Music where he studied with Franz Micki. White was a prot√©g√© of Emma Azalia Hackley who raised money for his scholarship to allow him to study abroad. Traveling to London, he studied composition with Samuel Coleridge-Taylor in 1906; he returned to the city again from 1908 to 1910 to study violin with Michael Zacharewitsch. During the period of 1930-1932, he studied with Raoul Laparra in Paris. Career White maintained an active career as a performer, teacher, and composer. From 1902‚Äì1903, White contributed articles on violin pedagogy and history to The Negro Music Journal and from 1903-1907 served as the head of the string department of the Washington Conservatory of Music, founded by pianist, educator, and Oberlin alum, Harriet Gibbs Marshall. As a concert violinist he received critical praise and toured the United States with his wife, pianist Beatrice Warrick White. A founding member of the National Association of Negro Musicians, White served as the organization's president from 1922 to 1924. From 1924 to 1930, he taught at West Virginia State College and succeeded R. Nathaniel Dett as head of the music department of Hampton Institute from (1932 --1935). In this period he wrote his best-known works: the ballet, A Night in Sans Souci--from the play Tambour, and the opera Ouanga. The lead role in Ouanga had been performed by baritone Lawrence Winters. These works are based on Haitian themes working with playwright and librettist John Matheus. Personal life On April 24, 1905, he married pianist Beatrice Warrick. To this union were born two children: * William Warrick White (March 27, 1906-1938) * Clarence Cameron White, Jr. (March 11, 1908-January 30, 1913) Beatrice died at their home in Elizabeth, New Jersey, in October 1942. White soon moved to New York City and in 1943 married the librarian, writer, and puppeteer, Pura Belpr√©. White died from cancer on June 30, 1960. Compositional style White's compositions contained a similar aesthetic to contemporaries and mentors such as William Grant Still, Florence Price, R. Nathaniel Dett, and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. White drew upon thematic and harmonic content from African American and other African diasporic musical styles and traditions. His early output consisted of compositions that incorporated quotes of spirituals and arrangements of spirituals such as Bandanna Sketches: Four Negro Spirituals, Camp Song:(Water Boy), Levee Dance, Forty Negro Spirituals, and Traditional Negro Spirituals. As he matured, the forms utilized by the composer became more varied. The 1954 Benjamin Award was presented to him for Elegy, a composition for orchestra. He also used decidedly 'Negro' themes for his string quartet and other chamber music.

The club hosts the annual Queen's Club Championships grass court men's lawn tennis tournament (currently known as Fever-Tree Championships for sponsorship reasons). It has 28 outdoor courts and eight indoor. With two courts, it is also the national headquarters of real tennis, hosting the British Open every year excepting 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Queen's Club also has rackets and squash courts; it has now become the headquarters for both these sports due to the Prince's Club closure in 1940. History Founded as The Queen's Club Limited on 19 August 1886 by Evan Charteris, George Francis and Algernon Grosvener, the Queen's Club was the world's second multipurpose sports complex, after the Prince's Club, and became the only one after the Prince's Club relocated to Knightsbridge and lost its outdoor sports facilities. The club is named after Queen Victoria, its first patron. On 19 May 1887 the first lawn tennis courts were opened and on 1‚Äì2 July 1887 the first sporting event was held when Oxford played Cambridge. The construction of the club buildings took about eighteen months and they were opened in January 1888. William Marshall, finalist of the inaugural 1877 Wimbledon Championships was the architect.McKelvie, p. 14 Among the initial sports offered at the club were real tennis, Eton Fives, rackets, lawn tennis (grass courts and covered courts), football, rugby and athletics. Cricket was also played but not as an organised sport. The University Sports meeting between Cambridge and Oxford was held at the Queen's Club from 1888 to 1928.McKelvie, p. 15 Queens Club was the venue of the covered courts (indoor) tennis, jeu de paume (real tennis) and rackets events of the 1908 Summer Olympics.1908 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 220 (covered courts tennis), 233 (rackets) & 314 (jeu de paume). Until 1922, the club was the main ground for the football games of Corinthian F.C. One international was held, England drawing 1‚Äì1 with Wales on 18 March 1895. Sale of Queen's Club On 13 September 2005, the Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), the governing body of British lawn tennis, which had owned Queen's since 1953, put the club up for sale. The terms required that the rackets club and the Queen's Club Championships remain unaffected (the site's value for residential or commercial redevelopment might greatly exceed its value as a sports club, in the event that planning permission could be obtained, and the LTA wished to preserve the club's role in British tennis). On 8 March 2006, the LTA announced that it would sell to club members for ¬£45 million, ending seven months of uncertainty about the club's future. However some members disputed the LTA's right to sell the club, which they contested it merely held in trust on their behalf, and began to raise funds to dispute the sale in court. In December 2006 the two sides reached an out of court settlement in which the sale price was reduced to ¬£35 million. In February 2007, the LTA relocated its headquarters from Queen's Club to the new National Tennis Centre in Roehampton. The Fever-Tree Championships still remains one of the six most popular grass competitions on the men's ATP tour along with the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany, the Aegon International, the Hall of Fame Tennis Championships in Newport, Rhode Island, the Rosmalen Championships in the Netherlands and Wimbledon.

The Positivist period lasted until the turn of the 20th century and the advent of the modernist Young Poland movement.Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, The History of Polish Literature, pp. 281‚Äì321. \\"Positivism.\\" University of California Press, 1983. . Retrieved October 10, 2011. Overview In the aftermath of the 1863 Uprising, many reflecting Poles argued that further attempts to regain independence from the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Austria-Hungary by force of arms should be abandoned. In their polemics over the wisdom of resistance against the partitioning powers, published between 1868 and 1873 in PrzeglƒÖd tygodniowy (\\"The Weekly Review\\") and Prawda (\\"Truth\\"), they ‚Äì often reluctantly and only partly ‚Äì discarded the stylistics of the earlier Polish Romantic period. Polish positivism drew its name from the philosophy of French philosopher Auguste Comte, while much of its ideology was inspired by the works of British scholars and scientists including Herbert Spencer and John Stuart Mill. The Polish positivists advocated the exercise of reason before emotion. They believed that independence, if it was to be regained, must be won gradually, by \\"building from the foundations\\" (by creating a material infrastructure and educating the public) and through organic work that would enable Polish society to function as a fully integrated \\"social organism\\" (a concept borrowed from a number of European thinkers, including Herbert Spencer).Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, The History of Polish Literature, pp. 283‚Äì84. Positivist objectives A leading Polish philosopher of positivism, the journalist, novelist, and short-story writer Boles≈Çaw Prus (author of The Outpost, The Doll, The New Woman, and Pharaoh), advised his compatriots that Poland's place in the world would be determined by Poland's contributions to the world's scientific, technological, economic, and cultural progress.Edward Pie≈õcikowski, Boles≈Çaw Prus, p. 49. Specific societal questions addressed by the Polish positivists included the establishment of equal rights for all members of society, including peasants and women; the assimilation of Poland's Jewish minority; the elimination of illiteracy among ordinary citizens resulting from the closure of Polish schools by the occupying powers; and the defense of the Polish population in the German-ruled part of Poland against the German Kulturkampf and the German government's displacement of the Polish population.Zygmunt Szweykowski, Tw√≥rczo≈õƒá Boles≈Çawa Prusa (The Art of Boles≈Çaw Prus), 2nd ed., Warsaw, Pa≈Ñstwowy Instytut Wydawniczy, 1972, pp. 130‚Äì51. The Polish positivists viewed work, rather than uprisings, as the true path to maintaining a Polish national identity and demonstrating a constructive patriotism. Aleksander ≈öwiƒôtochowski (editor of Prawda) held that \\"All the great problems [abiding] in the [bosom] of mankind can be solved by education alone, and this education must be compulsory.\\"Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, The History of Polish Literature, pp. 285‚Äì286.
