It is probably the earliest extant saint's life from Anglo-Saxon England, and is an account of the life and miracles of Cuthbert (died 687), a Bernician hermit-monk who became bishop of Lindisfarne. Surviving in eight manuscripts from Continental Europe, it was not as well read in the Middle Ages as the prose version by Bede. It was however Bede's main source for his two dedicated works on Cuthbert, the \\"Metrical Life\\" and the \\"Prose Life\\". It was completed soon after the translation of Cuthbert's body in 698, at some point between 699 and 705. Compiled from oral sources available in Bernicia at the time of its composition, the Vita nonetheless utilized previous Christian writing from the Continent, particularly Gregory the Great's Dialogi and Sulpicius Severus' Vita Sancti Martini, as powerful influences. The name of the author is not known, though he was a monk of the monastery of Lindisfarne. It is often called the Anonymous Life to distinguish it from the \\"Prose Life\\" and the \\"Metrical Life\\" of Bede. There are four modern editions of the Anonymous Life, the latest by historian Bertram Colgrave. Background and sources Ælfflæd of Whitby, sister of the king, meeting Cuthbert on Coquet Island; from British Library Yates Thomson MS 26 version of Bede's Prose Life, prophecy is in the Anonymous Life at iii.6 Written just after or possibly contemporarily with Adomnán's Vita Sancti Columbae (\\"Life of Saint Columba\\"), the Anonymous Life is the first piece of Northumbrian Latin writing and the earliest piece of English Latin hagiography.Love, \\"Hagiography\\", p. 226 This is an honour sometimes given to the anonymous Vita of Gregory the Great written at Whitby, though the date of 710 attributed to the latter by historian R. C. Love (in contrast to a date between 680 and 704) makes it later than the Anonymous Life of Cuthbert.Love, \\"Hagiography\\", p. 226; cf. Lapidge, \\"Anglo-Latin Literature\\", p. 13 The work is an account of the life and miracles of Cuthbert (), sometime Melrose monk, hermit of Farne and bishop of Lindisfarne who died on 20 March 687.Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastor and Solitary\\", pp. 29–36 In common with Irish saints of the period, the Anonymous Life depicts the Bernician saint in the mold of Martin, bishop of Tours (died 397), who like Cuthbert successfully combined the role of hermit and bishop.Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastor and Solitary\\", pp. 36–42; Thacker, \\"Origins\\", pp. 103–15 The Anonymous Life appears to have been particularly influenced by the example of Martin in its portrayal of Cuthbert's pastoral and healing activities.Thacker, \\"Origins\\", p. 113 It was commissioned by Bishop Eadfrith (died 721), the bishop famous for the Lindisfarne Gospels who also commissioned Bede's Prose Life of the saint.Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastor and Solitary\\", p. 24; Williams, Smyth and Kirby, Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain, s.v. \\"Eadfrith\\" p. 112 The Anonymous Life was organised into four books; though this was not common in the literature of the day, it followed the organization of the metrical Vita Sancti Martini of Venantius Fortunatus, Gregory of Tours' De Virtutibus Sancti Martini and the Dialogi of Gregory the Great (containing an account of the life of Benedict of Nursia).Berschin, Berschin, \\"Opus Deliberatum\\", p. 98 This may be an indication that the author regarded Cuthbert as a saint of stature comparable with Benedict and Martin.Marner, St Cuthbert, p. 12 The Anonymous Life's biggest literary influence was the Christian Scriptures,Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 12 though it also borrowed some of the stories contained in Gregory's Dialogi, Sulpicius Severus' Vita Sancti Martini and the Vita Sancti Antonii, Evagrius' Latin translation of Athanasius' biography of Anthony the Great.Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastor and Solitary\\", pp. 25, 27 This influence extends to long verbatim extracts, such as those from the Sulpicius Severus at book i chapter 2 and book iv chapter 1.Thacker, \\"Origins\\", p. 111, n. 58 The author was also familiar with Victor of Aquitaine's Epistola ad Hilarium and the Actus Silvestri. The primary source used however was the oral tradition of the Lindisfarne monks. Many of the men the author consulted were unnamed priests, deacons and other men respected in their communities, though some are named directly, namely Ælfflaed, Æthilwald, Plecgils, Tydi and Walhstod.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 12–13 Date and authorship The Anonymous Life was complete somewhere between 699 and 705.Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastor and Solitary\\", p. 22 The posthumous miracles set after Cuthbert's translation in 698 make 699 the earliest possible date for a completed text.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 13 As the text also says that King Aldfrith \\"is now reigning peacefully\\", it must have been written before the latter's death in 705. The author of the Life of St Cuthbert has not been identified.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 11–12 Heinrich Hahn in 1883 put a case for Herefrith, the abbot of Lindisfarne mentioned as a source by Bede in his own Vita of the saint.Hahn, Bonifaz und Lul, pp. 175–79; Thacker, \\"Lindisfarne\\", p. 104 Bertram Colgrave, the Anonymous Life's most recent editor, has roundly rejected Hahn's argument. While offering Baldhelm and Cynemund (two other sources of Bede) as better candidates, Colgrave did not endorse either and declared that \\"it must always be a matter of conjecture\\". From the text itself, and from the writings of Bede, it can be deduced that it was written by a monk of Lindisfarne.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 11 Bede, in his introduction to his Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum, is almost certainly referring to this work when he wrote that > What I have written concerning the most holy father and bishop Cuthbert, > whether in this volume or in my little book concerning his acts, I took in > part from what I have previously found written about him by the brethren of > Lindisfarne. Throughout the Anonymous Life the author refers to Lindisfarne and its monastery with possessive pronouns. Though possibly written by many authors, the first person singular is used often enough to suggest only one major author. Manuscripts The Anonymous Life is extant in eight manuscripts.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 17–20, has seven, but Bullough, \\"Early- Ninth-Century Manuscript\\", pp. 105–37, adds an eighth The oldest, according to historian Donald Bullough, lies in Munich, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Clm. 15817Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth-Century Manuscript\\", pp. 106–07 The manuscript was probably compiled at Salzburg under Bishop Adalram.Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth- Century Manuscript\\", p. 107, n. 8, citing the conclusions of Professor Bernhard Bischoff It occupies folios 100v-119v, following two works of Augustine of Hippo (De pastoribus/Sermo xlvii, 1–53, and De Ovibus, 53r to 99v), and preceding Isidore of Seville's Synonyma.Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth- Century Manuscript\\", pp. 107–08 The copy contains many scribal errors,Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth-Century Manuscript\\", p. 108 but also a number of readings superior to other versions.Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth-Century Manuscript\\", pp. 116–20, 131–37 Of the others, the oldest, probably written at the Abbey of St Bertin around c. 900, is extant in Folios 67b to 83b of St Omer 267.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 17 This manuscript contains works of saints Cyprian, Jerome, and Augustine, as well as hymn lyrics and music dedicated to Martin of Tours and Bertin of St Omer. St Omer 267 is still regarded as the best of all the available manuscripts in terms of accuracy, as well as age.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 45 Another St Omer manuscript, St Omer 715 preserves the Anonymous Life, occupying folios 164 to 168b. Here the Anonymous Life forms part of a larger legendary copied in the 12th century, with fifty- seven surviving vitae covering saints with feast days in the first three months of the year (January, February and March). Missing nine chapters, the Anonymous Life is preserved in a late 10th-century manuscript from the abbey of St Vaast, Arras, Arras 812 (1029).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 17–18 It occupies folios 1 to 26b, and is out of order towards the end.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 18 It is followed in the manuscript by the Vita Sancti Guthlaci (\\"Life of Saint Guthlac\\"), the Vita Sancti Dunstani (\\"Life of Saint Dunstan\\") and the Vita Sancti Filiberti (\\"Life of Saint Filibert\\", abbot of Jumièges), and originally contained another hagiography of a Jumièges abbot, that of Aichard of Jumièges. Three British Museum manuscript volumes, Harleian MS 2800–2802, contain a very large legendary from Arnstein Abbey in the diocese of Trier (now Limburg), and the Anonymous Life is found on Harleian MS 2800 folios 248 to 251b. The same legendary is in three 13th-century Brussels volumes, Royal Library MSS 98–100, 206, and 207–208.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 18–19 The Anonymous Life is present in MS 207–208 folios 158 to 163.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 19 In Trier, in another legendary composed around 1235 probably at the Abbey of St Maximin, the anonymous life can be found: the Trier, Public Library 1151, folios 135 to 142. Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, Fonds Latin 5289, written in the 14th century, contains the last extant version of the Anonymous Life. It has been copied out of order, beginning on folio 55b, continuing on folios 49b to 52b, and ending on 56 to 58b.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 19–20 Historian Bertram Colgrave believed that Harleian 2800 and Brussels MS 207–208 have a common origin, a 12th-century legendary from the diocese of Trier.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 43 Both manuscripts share common features, such as the omission of place-names and personal names (e.g. Plecgils). Colgrave likewise attributed a common parent manuscript to Trier, Public Library 1151 and Paris Bibliothèque Nationale Fonds Latin 5289, as he did to Arras 812 (1029) and the two St Omer manuscripts.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 43–45 The Salzburg manuscript may be descended from an ancestor predating the common ancestor of the former and the latter set.Bullough, \\"Early-Ninth-Century Manuscript\\", p. 109 Modern editions The Anonymous Life has been published four times in the modern era: * The Bollandists, Acta Sanctorum Martii, vol. iii, (Antwerp, 1668), pp. 117–24 * J. A. Giles, Venerabilis Bedae Opera, vol. vi, (London, 1843), pp. 357–82 * Joseph Stevenson, Venerabilis Bedae Opera Historica Minora, (English Historical Society, London, 1851), pp. 259–84 * Bertram Colgrave, Two Lives of Saint Cuthbert: A Life by an Anonymous Monk of Lindisfarne and Bede's Prose Life, (Cambridge, 1940) The Bollandist version was based on St Omer 267 and Trier Public Library 1151.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 51 Giles' edition was a reprint of the Bollandist version. Stevenson's version too was a reprint of the Bollandist version, with some corrections brought in. Colgrave's edition was new, but like the Bollandist version is primarily based on St Omer 267. Synopsis Cuthbert's horse finds food on the roof of an abandoned dwelling The Anonymous Life consists of 4 books, book i relating Cuthbert's youth, book ii his early years serving God, book iii his time as a hermit on Farne, and book iv his time as bishop. =Book i= Chapters one and two of book i consist of the prologue and preface, with the author indicating that the work was commissioned by Bishop Eadfrith.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 60–60 In chapter three the eight-year-old Cuthbert plays with other children, showing off his physical abilities, until a three-year-old playmate, addressing him as \\"bishop and priest\\", chides him for lack of humility; this miracle the author claimed to have learned from Bishop Tumma, who apparently heard it from Cuthbert's own mouth (though Cuthbert confessed that the significance was unknown to him at the time).Berschin, \\"Opus Deliberatum\\", p. 97; Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 64–67 Still an eight-year-old, Cuthbert becomes lame and is visited by an angel who instructs him on a cure (chapter four).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 66–69 Cuthbert with the disguised angel In chapter five Cuthbert, while still a youth tending to sheep in Lauderdale, has a vision of a bishop being borne to heaven; subsequently it is discovered that Aidan, bishop of Lindisfarne, had died on the same hour as Cuthbert's vision.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 68–71 Far to the south, a young Cuthbert is travelling during the winter and crosses the river Wear at Chester-le-Street, taking shelter in one of the empty summer dwellings; suffering from lack of food, his horse pulls down warm bread and meat from the roof of the dwelling (chapter six).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 70–71 Book i ends with the anonymous author making mention of several other miracles of Cuthbert's youth without going into detail: how God provided food for him in camp with his army against an enemy, how he saw the soul of a reeve taken up to the sky, his defeat of some demons, and his cure of the insane (chapter seven).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 72–73 =Book ii= Cleric watching the sea creatures tend to Cuthbert's feet In book ii Cuthbert becomes a monk (chapter one).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 74–77 While still a neophyte at the monastery of Ripon, Cuthbert is given the job of greeting guests; having washed and rubbed the feet of one guest, Cuthbert seeks to feed the visitor, finds he has no bread in the guesthouse and so goes to the monastery; but because the bread there is still baking, he has to return empty handed; when Cuthbert returns the visitor—an angel in disguise—has vanished leaving three warm loaves.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 76–79 Cuthbert, having been invited to the monastery of Coldingham by Abbess Æbbe, is followed by a cleric to the beach where he keeps one of his night-time vigils; the cleric sees two sea-animals emerge from the waves to clean and rub Cuthbert's feet; the author of the Anonymous Life was told this by a priest of Melrose called Plecgils (chapter three).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 78–83 In the following chapter Cuthbert and two brothers, having sailed to the land of the Picts, become hungry in the territory of the Niuduera (probably in eastern Fife)Fraser, Caledonia to Pictland, pp. 184–85 waiting for the sea to calm in order to resume their voyage; their hunger is relieved however when three slices of prepared dolphin meat is found on the beach, enough to feed them for three days; the story was reported to the author by a priest named Tydi, still living as the work was authored (chapter four).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 82–85 Eagle with the fish on the river Teviot According to Tydi too, Cuthbert and a boy were walking along the river Teviot teaching and baptizing the mountain people, when an eagle came from the sky and landed by the river; the boy ran towards the eagle and found a fish; after giving half of it to the eagle, the party fed themselves with the other half (chapter five).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 84–87 On the same trip the Devil created an illusion of a burning house, tricking some of the men despite Cuthbert's warning; the men, realising their mistake in seeking to extinguish the flames, asked and were given Cuthbert's forgiveness.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 86–89 Cuthbert is said in chapter seven to have saved from flames the house of his childhood nanny, a nun and widow named Kewswith of Hruringaham through prayer,Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 88–91 while in chapter eight he drives out a demon from the wife of a religious man named Hildmer, curing her illness.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 90–93 =Book iii= Penitent ravens bring Cuthbert pig lard Cuthbert's time as an island hermit is described in book iii. Having served as prior of Melrose for some time performing other miracles (omitted by the author), Cuthbert departs for Lindisfarne at the instigation of Bishop Eata; designing a monastic rule for the monks there, Cuthbert seeks a more solidary existence on the island of Farne, defeats the demons there and begins to build a residence (chapter one).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 94–97 Cuthbert moves a huge rock for the construction of his building (chapter two),Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 96–97 and orders his men to dig up some stony ground created an open spring into being (chapter three).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 98–99 The waves provide Cuthbert with the 12-foot beam he needs for the house after his men are unable to obtain one (chapter four).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 98–101 When ravens, despite being warned, disturb the roof of the shelter built for Cuthbert's servants, the saint banishes them from the island in the name of Jesus; after three days one raven returns seeking pardon and, having been forgiven by Cuthbert, both ravens provide the saint with enough pig lard to grease everyone's boots for a whole year (chapter five).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 100–03 Cuthbert is summoned to Coquet Island by the sister of King Ecgfrith, the royal abbess Ælfflaed; following her entreaties for information about her brother's fate, Cuthbert prophesies the king's coming death and his succession by Aldfrith, monk of Iona; Cuthbert agrees to become bishop within two years (chapter six).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 102–05 In chapter seven, the author closes book iii with a summary of Cuthbert's virtues and achievements.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 104–07 =Book iv= Cuthbert becomes bishop of Lindisfarne at the beginning of book iv, accepting the position only with reluctance and continuing his monastic style of life (chapters one and two).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 110–13 A number of healing miracles are subsequently recounted. Cuthbert cures the wife of one of Aldfrith's men, a gesith (comes) named Hemma from a district name Kintis (chapter three).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 114–15 He cures a maiden from a village called Bedesfeld, a miracle witnessed and reported by Æthilwald, then a priest but in the author's day prior of Melrose, whose relation the maiden was (chapter four).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 116–17 He cures a paralytic boy brought to him in the district of Ahse in the mountains between Hexham and Carlise (chapter five).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 116–19 In a miracle related to the author by Tydi, Cuthbert saves an infant and the infant's family from the plague at a village named Medilwong.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 118–21 Cuthbert is the savior of a servant Sibba, a Tweedside gesith, is retold thanks to the account provided by another former servant of Sibba's who is now a monk at Lindisfarne (chapter seven).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 120–23 Cuthbert's shoes healing the a paralytic With King Ecgfrith off fighting the Picts, Cuthbert visits the queen at Carlise; as Cuthbert is conducted by Waga, the city's reeve, he announces that the war is over and that the Ecgfrith has been slain; it was later revealed that Cuthbert's assertion happened at the same hour as the king's death in battle (chapter eight).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 122–23 At Carlisle Cuthbert meets an anchorite named Hereberht, who asks to die at the same day and hour as Cuthbert; the request is granted, and subsequently both go to heaven on the same hour of the same night (chapter nine).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 124–25 Cuthbert, dining at Ovington with abbess Ælfflæd, predicts the death of one of Ælfflæd's servants, Hadwald (chapter ten).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 126–29 The bishop resigns his bishopric after an episcopate of two years and returns to Farne (chapter eleven).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 128–29 Miracles continue as Cuthbert cures a (\\"still surviving\\") brother named Walhstod from dysentery. Cuthbert dies on Farne, and his body was washed and dressed before being shipped to Lindisdfarne (chapter thirteen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 130–31 After eleven years, Cuthbert's successor Bishop Eadberht orders the reopening of Cuthbert's coffin; Cuthbert's body is found to be incorrupt, i.e. having not decayed any noticeable way (chapter fourteen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 130–33 Miracles begin happening at Cuthbert's coffin, prayers and holy water from the trench Cuthbert's body had been washed in curing a boy from demonic possession (fifteen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 132–35 A monk from the household of Bishop Willbrord, visiting Lindisfarne, was taken by serious illness but was cured after praying at Cuthbert's coffin (chapter sixteen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 134–37 Likewise, a paralytic youth brought to Lindisfarne by another monastery for attention from Lindisfarne medics, is cured only after wearing the shoes once worn by Cuthbert (chapter seventeen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 136–39 The author ends the Anonymous Life of Cuthbert declaring that he has omitted many other miracles in order to avoid overburdening his reader (chapter eighteen).Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 138–39 Differences with Bede For Bede's two dedicated accounts of Cuthbert's life, the Anonymous Life is the chief source.Gransden, Historical Writing, p. 69; Lapidge, \\"Anglo-Latin Literature\\", p. 18 Bede however made little acknowledgment of his debt to the Anonymous Life in either his prose or verse life, and indeed if we were dependent only on Bede we would probably not know the work ever existed.Berschin, \\"Opus Deliberatum\\", p. 96 Stylistically the Latin of the Anonymous Life is not as grammatical and classicizing as Bede's Prose Life, and Bede went to some effort to 'improve' the prose.Berschin, \\"Opus Deliberatum\\", pp. 97–98 Bede adds some details in his own accounts but, in the words of historian Antonia Gransden \\"most of his additions are verbal and hagiographical trimmings\\".Gransden, Historical Writing, pp. 69–70 While following the Anonymous Life's order for most of the Prose Life, Bede considerably alters the order of miracles found in book iv.Colgrave, Two Lives, p. 15 The Anonymous Life suggests that Cuthbert began his career at Ripon, whereas Bede shows that it was in fact Melrose. Historian Clare Stancliffe suggested that the Anonymous Life made Ripon Cuthbert's place of tonsure because Melrose may have been tarnished in some eyes due to its use of Irish-style tonsure (in contrast to the Petrine tonsure of Ripon).Stancliffe, \\"Cuthbert, Pastory and Solitary\\", p. 23 Bede adds a longer account of Cuthbert's death supplied to him by abbot Herefrith. Bede also expands the story of Hereberht, adding the name of Hereberht's abode as Derwentwater. Otherwise Bede omitted many of the Old English proper names supplied in the Anonymous Life. Bede adds stories about the death of Boisil, a goose on Farne, the death of Bishop Eadberht, and provides information about Cuthbert's successors on Farne.Colgrave, Two Lives, pp. 15–16 See also * Historia de Sancto Cuthberto * Vita Sancti Wilfrithi Notes References  .  * 8th century in England 700s 8th-century Latin books Christian hagiography Biographies about religious figures History of County Durham History of Cumbria History of Northumberland Northumbria Religion in County Durham Christianity in Cumbria Religion in Northumberland History of the Scottish Borders 8th-century Latin writers 8th-century English writers ","title":"Vita Sancti Cuthberti"},{"id":"31173469","text":"Angelo Moriondo (6 June 1851 – 31 May 1914) is the inventor who patented the earliest known espresso machine, in 1884.

First espresso machine First patent (16 May 1884) of the espresso coffee machine Moriondo presented his invention at the General Expo of Turin in 1884, where it was awarded the bronze medal. The patent was awarded for a period of six years on 16 May 1884 under the title of \\"New steam machinery for the economic and instantaneous confection of coffee beverage, method ‘A. Moriondo’.\\" The machine was actually built by a mechanic named Martina, working under the direct supervision of the inventor.

Its operations, all of which were in North Africa, specifically Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, initially focused on oil exploration but expanded to include production. Circle Oil entered administration in January 2017 and sold its Egypt and Moroccan assets to SDX Energy to pay creditors. In September 2017 it began liquidation. Company regions =Morocco= Circle Oil Maroc Ltd. (COML), a wholly owned subsidiary of Circle Oil Plc signed an Exploration and Exploitation Agreement with ONHYM (Office National des Hydrocarbures et des Mines (the State oil company) for the Sebou Permit in June 2006 (original area 296 km2, now 134 km2 after relinquishments). The permit was situated in the Rharb Basin. The Permit shareholding was COML 75% and ONHYM 25%. Circle was the operator of the license. Production was decided by sales contracts, the daily maxima in the region gross per day at standard conditions. Circle completed its third drilling campaign in Morocco in 2015. Ten wells were drilled, 6 in the Sebou permit and 4 in Lalla Mimouna. Gas was discovered in both areas, with 6 of the ten wells yielding gas. In addition to its Moroccan drilling programme Circle also successfully built a 55 km gas pipeline from the Sebou permit to the Kenitra Industrial zone. All of Circle's Moroccan gas was sold domestically in Morocco and was transported through this pipeline from the license to the end users in Kenitra. =Egypt= Circle Oil’s acreage lay in the Gulf of Suez area. This basin covers approximately 19,000 km2. In early 2008 Circle Oil farmed into the North West Gemsa Block acquiring a 40% interest in the license from Premier Oil. Together they totaled around 82 km2 and were located roughly 300 km south of Cairo. The concessions were operated by a joint production company PetroAmir, whose partners include: EGPC, Zhen Hua (NPIC - 50% working interest and operator); Circle Oil Plc (40% working interest); and Sea Dragon Energy (10% working interest). Daily production from all Egyptian fields was around of 42° API oil and gross per day at standard conditions.

In August 2014, Circle announced a significant discovery at The El Mediouni well, or EMD-1 in the Mahdia permit. The well encountered very good light oil shows across 133 metres. The Company estimated that the likely recoverable resource was approximately 100mln barrels. Circle subsequently added that it had been granted a six-month extension to the Mahdia permit to January 2015, and it has the right to make two further 3-year extensions by committing to drill at least one well in each period. The company indicated that it intended to seek a farm in partner with whom to develop the Mahdia discovery. Ras Marmour Permit was located in the south-east of Tunisia covering part of the Island of Djerba and south of the Gulf of Gabès. The permit covered 1,564 km2 and was located in the vicinity of two significant hydrocarbon discoveries and a number of smaller ones. Circle Oil Tunisia held a 23% working interest in the permit. The operator and partner was Exxoil S A., a local Tunisian company. In addition to the two exploration permits, Circle also had an interest in the Beni Khalled production license in Tunisia. Under the terms of the farm in agreement with Exxoil SA, Circle Oil would acquire an initial 30% interest in the Licence in return for funding a 50 km2 3D seismic programme and one well.

Biography He was a son of Gerald Butler of Cashel, County Tipperary, and Ann Butler of Hemmingstown. Early in his military career, he was one of the heroes of a battle to save the Austrian emperor, Francis II, for which he was made a knight of the Order of Maria Theresa. He held the rank of Knight Bachelor from having obtained a royal licence to accept the Order of Maria Theresa before the regulations of 1812 relative to Foreign Orders came into effect. Butler entered the army by purchasing a cornetcy in the 14th light dragoons on 30 September 1788, gazetted Aug 1789. He was promoted Lieutenant dated 13 October 1791, gazetted Dec 1791. He exchanged to the 24th Regiment of Foot, gazetted August 1792. In 1793 he became Captain of an Independent Company, gazetted Sept 1793. Butler then purchased a cornecy in 15th Regiment of Dragoons, gazetted March 1794. He was sent to take part in the Flanders Campaign, which was part of the French Revolutionary Wars. On 24 April 1794 during the Battle of Villers-en-Cauchies, he was one of the officers of the two companies escorting the Emperor Francis II,(the other was a company of Black Hussars) which saved Emperor Francis II from being taken prisoner by a numerically superior French force. For their gallantry the emperor gave the eight English officers medals, and they later received the Military Order of Maria Theresa. Butler had been promoted lieutenant in the 11th light dragoons in May 1794, and he was in 1796 gazetted major without purchase in the newly raised 87th Royal Irish Fusiliers regiment. With it he served in the West Indies in 1797 at St Lucia where he met and married Rosetta Martin des Rameaux. In 1804 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in 1806 the 87th was ordered to form part of the British invasion force under Sir Samuel Auchmuty attacking Montevideo. In the attack on Montevideo Butler especially distinguished himself, and also in General Whitelocke's attempt to capture Buenos Aires, where the 87th had 17 officers and 400 men killed and wounded. From 1807 to 1810, while the 2nd battalion, under Colonel Hugh Gough, was distinguishing itself in the Peninsula, the 1st battalion of the 87th, under Butler, garrisoned the Cape of Good Hope In 1809 he was made Commandant of Simonstown. In 1810 he was second in command of a force ordered from the Cape to assist Major-general Abercromby in the capture of Mauritius, but the island was already taken when the contingent arrived. Nevertheless, though he saw no more service, Butler was promoted colonel in 1811 and major-general in 1814, and made Commandant of Mahebourg, Mauritius. He retired due to ill health in 1818. He died at Ballyadams, Queen's County, Ireland, 30 November 1824.

(1948). \\"The Hirase collections of mollusks\\". The Nautilus 62(1): 34-35. Yoichirō greatly contributed to the start of malacology in Japan and was responsible for the collection and indirectly the naming of many land and marine mollusks. Revered by malacologists throughout the world for his enthusiasm and contributions to malacology, he has numerous species named after him. Yoichirō lived from 1859 until 1925. He was a wealthy Kyōto dealer in poultry, seeds, and aviculture products who had founded a side business trading in marine and land shells.[1] He began to collect shells in 1898 at age 39. Over the next 20 years, his collection grew to about 3,000 Japanese specimens and 4,500 foreign specimens. He coordinated numerous field collectors to explore the territories and prefectures of Japan gathering both land and marine mollusks. Many of the species found by his team were newly discovered and named in collaboration with many scientists around the world, including H.A. Pilsbry, P. Ehrmann, G.K. Gude, C.F. Ancey, and G.B. Sowerby. Yoichirō was the mentor of Tokubei Kuroda, another forefather of Japanese malacology. Kuroda got his start in malacology under the employ of Yoichiro at age 15. Kuroda’s employment initially included cleaning Hirase's large house and looking after his children by day. Hirase paid for Kuroda to attend night school and to learn English, at which he excelled, and arranged for him to learn the basics of systematic biology. A rapid learner and diligent clerk, Kuroda was soon placed in charge of the shell business, and became Hirase's secretary. He was instrumental in the founding and operation of Hirase's Conchological Museum (1913-1919), which was situated near the Kyōto Zoo, and handled most of Hirase's correspondence with foreign researchers. He also helped compile and edit Hirase's Conchological Magazine (1907-1915). Hirase’s Conchological museum housed his collection from 1913 until 1919. The museum was compelled to close in 1919 due to his illness and the financial panic brought about by World War I. At its largest, the Hirase collection grew to 15,000 pieces. Prior to WWII, the collection was split to ensure its survival. One third was donated to various museums, including the Smithsonian, one third was kept at the house of his son, Shintarō Hirase in Tokyo, and the last third was stored in the Research Institute for Natural Resources in Tokyo. The majority of the collection was destroyed during incendiary bombing of Tokyo during the war. Only 5000 pieces, mostly consisting of the minute marine specimens, the land specimens, and fresh water specimens, survived the war. The surviving pieces of the collection have been stored in the Research Institute for Natural Resources in Tokyo since 1948.

Credit:Wellcome LibraryGeorge Gulliver (4 June 1804 – 17 November 1882), was an English anatomist and physiologist. Life and work Gulliver was born at Banbury, Oxfordshire, on 4 June 1804, and after an apprenticeship with local surgeons entered at St. Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where he became prosector to Abernethy and dresser to Lawrence (afterwards Sir William). Becoming a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons in June 1826 he was gazetted hospital assistant to the forces in May 1827, and afterwards became surgeon to the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues). He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1838, Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1843, and in 1852 a member of the council of the latter body. In 1861 he was Hunterian professor of comparative anatomy and physiology, and in 1863 delivered the Hunterian oration, in which he strongly put forward the neglected claims of William Hewson and John Quekett as discoverers. For some years before his death he had retired from the army, and devoted himself to research and writing, but became gradually enfeebled by gout. Many of his later papers were written when he was confined to his bed. He died at Canterbury on 17 November 1882, leaving one son, George, assistant physician to St. Thomas' Hospital. Gulliver wrote no systematic work, although he edited an English translation of Gerber's General and Minute Anatomy of Man and the Mammalia in 1842, adding, besides numerous notes, an appendix giving an account of his own researches on the blood, chyle, lymph, &c.; In 1846 he edited for the Sydenham Society The Works of William Hewson, F.R.S., with copious notes and a biography of Hewson. He also supplied notes to Rudolph Wagner's Physiology, translated by Dr. Willis (1844). His Hunterian lectures on the \\"Blood, Lymph, and Chyle of Vertebrates\\" were published in the Medical Times and Gazette from 2 August 1862 to 13 June 1863. Most of his work is scattered through various periodicals; a list of them is given in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers. Gulliver was the first to give extensive tables of measurements and full observations on the shape and structure of the red blood-corpuscles in man and many vertebrates, resulting in several interesting discoveries. In some points he corrected the prevailing views adopted from John Hunter as to the coagulation of the blood, at the same time confirming other views of Hunter; he noted the fibrillar form of clot fibrin, the so-called molecular base of chyle, the prevalence of naked nuclei in chyle and lymph, and the intimate connection of the thymus gland with the lymphatic system. His work in connection with the formation and repair of bone had considerable significance. To pathology he rendered important services, showing the prevalence of cholesterine and fatty degeneration in several organs and morbid products, the significance of the softening of clots of fibrin, and some of the characteristics of tubercle. In botany also Gulliver did original work, proving the important varieties of character in raphides, pollen, and some tissues, and their taxonomic value.

The statue is of a sunbonneted woman leading a child by the hand. It was donated to the State of Oklahoma by millionaire oilman E. W. Marland. He commissioned models from twelve well-known sculptors and financed a nationwide tour to get feedback from art critics and the general public in order to decide which model to use for the final statue.  Design and construction  Around 1925 Marland sketched out an ambitious sculptural program to sculptor Jo Davidson involving numerous statues based on the theme of the settling of the American West and attempted to persuade Davidson to take it on. When Davidson declined Marland replies that he could pay for it, prompting Davidson to come back with \\"I don't doubt it for a minute, but I don't see myself working for you for the rest of my life.\\" Marland ultimately convinced Davidson to go to Ponca City, Marland's then home town, and create three statues for him: one of Marland and one of each of Marland's adopted children, Lydie and George. While Davidson was producing his three Marland statues E.W. told him of another project that he has in mind, \\"E.W.'s most cherished dream.\\" Davidson writes, \\" It was to be a twenty-five foot figure, which he planned to put up on a hill where it could be seen for miles ... E.W. brought his friends to see what I was doing. He acted as if he was the sculptor, and in conversation would say that he was doing the figure - that I was his hands.\\"Davidson. Jo, Between Sittings: An informal autobiography of Jo Davidson, The Dial Press, NY 1951 pp. 210-215 Marland's inspiration for this project included his pioneering mother and grandmother. = The models = At that point Marland sent out invitations to many of America's leading sculptors, offering them each a $10,000 honorarium to produce a roughly tall bronze model for the statue. He further proposed that the models tour the United States and that the American public vote as to which of the models would be erected in Ponca City. Several sculptors, Daniel Chester French, George Grey Barnard and Paul Manship turned Marland down, also declining were the only two women invited, Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney and Anna Hyatt Huntington,The Art News, Vol. XXV - No. 21, February 26, 1927 leaving him with an even dozen artists, all males. The artists who submitted models were Bryant Baker, A, Stirling Calder, Jo Davidson, James Earle Fraser, John Gregory, F. Lynn Jenkins, Mario Korbel, Arthur Lee, Hermon Atkins MacNeil, Maurice Sterne, Mahonri Young, and Wheeler Williams. The models were to tour America and everyone who visited the sites where they were exhibited was allowed to vote for their favorite.Exhibition of Models for a Monument to the Pioneer Woman, at the Chicago Architectural Exhibition, East Gallerias, Art Institute of Chicago, June 25 to August 1, 1927 Marland's original idea was to have a woman in pioneer dress accompanied by a child, and so he provided a sunbonnet to each sculptor. While the artists were not limited to these ideas, nine of the twelve models included a sunbonnet and all save for Jo Davidson's included a child. Both Davidson and Calder visited Oklahoma to gain further inspiration. Mahonri Young's biographer Thomas Toone relates that Young produced not only the required three foot tall statuette, but also a plaster version of the entire Pioneer Memorial as he envisioned it, replete with detailed bas-reliefs of western scenes around the base of a massive pedestal and platform, on top of which the pioneer woman \\"holds her child in the embrace of a Renaissance Madonna.\\"Toone, Thomas, Mahoni Young: His Life and Art, Signature Books, Salt Lake City Utah, 1997 pp. 126-129 A pair of spirited bison guard the stairs leading up the base. The voting public was not privy to Young's vision and his work showed poorly in the balloting. Young, who described not winning the competition as the worst disappointment in his career, did manage to get some of his ideas out in later works. Toone also adds that the winning sculptor, Baker Bryant used, \\"a professional actress as his model, which produced a glamorous figure, representing Western myth more than reality.\\"Toone, Thomas, Mahoni Young: His Life and Art, Signature Books, Salt Lake City Utah, 1997 p. 127 There are some questions raised about the winning design by Donald De Lue, at that time Baker Bryant's assistant. De Lue's biographer, D. Roger Howlett makes several points about the Pioneer Woman statue. Wheeler Williams model, enlarged and cast in Liberty, Kansas \\"it was especially on the \\"Pioneer Woman\\" that De Lue manifest his talent ... ... Baker claimed that the conception and movement of the final monument was developed in an eight-to-ten inch sketch model made by him a few hours after he learned about the competition. De Lue executed the thirty-three inch competition model for the sculpture in 1927, with Baker supervising and completing the face.\\"Howlett, D. Roger, The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets, and Heroes, David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston 1990, p. 21 Baker was also the last sculptor to enter the contest having only one month to prepare his model. James Earle Fraser based his almost Impressionistic statue on his favorite aunt, Dora, who was herself a pioneer woman. This model is unique among the ones submitted to the competition, and perhaps in the entire world of Pioneer Women Statues, in that the woman, caught breast feeding her child, exposes a bare breast. No stranger to multi-tasking, she still manages to hold on to her rifle while feeding the baby.Freundlich, A.L., The Sculpture of James Earle Fraser, Universal Publishers 2001, pp. 77-79 Many years after the competition Wheeler Williams' model was re-discovered, enlarged, cast, and now sits in front of the public library in Liberty, Kansas. = The tour = The submitted bronze models were unveiled at the Reinhardt Galleries in New York on February 26, 1927 where they remained in exhibition until March 19. At a dinner for the twelve finalists the evening before the models were revealed to the public, Marland announced: Marland reserved the right to make the final choice for the monument, but he sought input from the public and so these models then began a tour of museums and art galleries across the nation. From its opening at the Reinhardt Galleries, the tour moved on. Stops included Boston, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Buffalo, Detroit, Indianapolis, Chicago, Minneapolis, Kansas City, Dallas, Oklahoma City, Fort Worth, and Ponca City. At each location visitors were invited to vote for their three favorite models. In all over 750,000 people viewed the models and over 120,000 votes were placed. The models were the subject of much discussion at the time, and photographs of them were included in full-page pictorials of both the New York Times and the LA Times. Art critics discussed the merits of one model over another and almost universally lambasting the sunbonnets as \\"terrible headwear\\". The models were even the subject of writing assignments for elementary school art classes. The L.A. Times reported that art critic Helen Appleton Read felt that \\"no adequate tribute had been paid to the pioneer woman\\" and that \\"most of the competitors failed to produce anything monumental\\". On December 20, 1927, E. W. Marland's son George announced that Bryant Baker's model was selected as the winner. Baker's model received the most votes in 11 cities and Gregory's was the second most popular, being the favorite in three cities. When the tour of the models was over, Baker's Pioneer Woman had won first place, out-balloting John Gregory's effort 42,478 to 37,782. \\"De Lue set to work in 1928 and 1929, modeling it in Baker's Brooklyn studio, working with Jean La Seure, the enlarger. De Lue later remembered: \\"One day Bryant decided he would work on it, and did some work. I said, 'Look, Bryant, if I were you I'd get the hell out of here, because you're not helping at all,' He said, 'Thank you very much.' and he went.\\"Howlett, D. Roger, The Sculpture of Donald De Lue: Gods, Prophets, and Heroes, David R. Godine, Publisher, Boston 1990 p. 21 = Fundraising and construction = The cost of the Pioneer Woman project was approximately $350,000. This included a $10,000 honorarium for each of the twelve finalists plus $100,000 for the winner Bryant Baker. The remainder of the costs were accrued during the tour around the country and arranging the base for the statue. While the vast majority of the project was funded by Marland, his fortunes were on the decline at this time and so he was forced to seek additional funding to complete the project. Some private fundraising helped to defray the final costs and $25,000 was supplied by Lew Wentz, Marland's long- time business rival as well as fellow philanthropist of Ponca City. After much private debate and encouragement, Lew Wentz in 1929 loaned money to Marland enabling him to make final payments for the statue, secured by a real estate mortgage and arranged by a local banker, resulting in Wentz filing a lawsuit in 1936 to collect on the non-performing loan [see Ada Weekly News, 12 March 1936]. Marland had purchased 2,000 acres on which to place the statue. The area where the statue was erected stands just off of U.S. Route 77, a mile northeast of the center of Ponca City. Baker said the work took years off of his life and he was afraid he would die before completion. = Dedication = The Pioneer Woman statue and base. On April 16, 1930 it was announced that the statue would be unveiled on April 22, 1930 on the 41st anniversary of the Land Run of 1889 which opened the Oklahoma Territory to settlers. The day was declared a state holiday by the governor and the celebration in Ponca City included a parade, 19-gun salute. An estimated 40,000 people attended the unveiling. The dedication itself began at 1:30 pm central time with a nationwide radio address on WJZ by United States President Herbert Hoover broadcasting from the White House. He introduced the native Oklahoman, Secretary of War Patrick J. Hurley who had intended to attend the unveiling in person before his visit was curtailed by illness and so spoke from his home. After the first half-hour the broadcast continued from Ponca City. Other speakers during the 90 minute broadcast were Marland, Baker, Episcopal Bishop of Oklahoma Thomas Casady, Oklahoma Governor William J. Holloway, and Oklahoma humorist, Will Rogers, who closed the unveiling ceremonies. = History since dedication = The area surrounding the statue has been designated as Pioneer Woman State Park. Image of the statue used on a tee-shirt = The Pioneer Woman Museum = On September 16, 1958, the 65th anniversary of the opening of the Cherokee Outlet which included the land of Ponca City, the state opened the Pioneer Woman Museum, on land adjacent to the monument. An image of the Pioneer Woman statue serves as the de facto logo of the museum.  Access and attributes  = Location and visiting = The statue resides on a park. = Physical characteristics = The bronze statue itself stands tall and weighs . It stands on a pyramidal stepped base of granite blocks which brings the total height of the monument to . The statue faces to the southwest, symbolising that the majority of the settlers had come from the northeast. There is a plaque on the first step beneath the statue which reads: Image used on cook book cover.  Depictions  The image of the Pioneer Woman has long been a symbol of Ponca City. In 1941 as part of their 50th anniversary celebrations the General Federation of Women's Clubs presented gold and bronze medals with a bas-relief of the Pioneer Woman to prominent and long-standing members. The statue is also the official emblem of the four-state Ozark Frontier Trail. When the State Quarter for Oklahoma was to be issued in 2008, there was a statewide call for proposals to be sent to the Mint for final design work. From the thousands of designs received, five were sent along to the mint. Four of the five submitted designs included the Pioneer Woman. When the professional designs returned from the mint in order for the people of Oklahoma to decide on the final design by voting amongst them, none of the designs included the book which is held under the Pioneer Womans arm. As this book is often thought to be a Bible, this was viewed as an attempt at censorship by the government and caused a statewide controversy. Eventually the fifth design was selected. That the book was intended to be the Bible was made clear by Baker in an interview in which he stated, \\"In trying to symbolize the Pioneer Woman of America I wanted to depict Courage and Faith ... The Bible was a vital factor in building up this country, and it often was the one indispensable book, recording the facts of the family life, of births, marriages and death and often the only reading material available for mothers to teach their children to read and write in those days.\\"\\"Sculptor's View of Monument\\", Ponca City News, Sunday September 15, 1968 Derivative works There have been several notable works of sculpture proposed or produced in the years following the unveiling of the Pioneer Woman based on it. The first one was the Kansas Pioneer Woman Memorial. A competition by the Pioneer Women's Memorial associationTopeka Journal, January 28, 1929 was held and, as in the competition for the Ponca City statue, Bryant Baker was the winner. A Kansas critic at the time pointed out, \\"There is a striking similarity in the appearance of the two works despite many actual differences.\\"Topeka Journal, February ? 1929 However this version of a Kansas monument was never completed. In 1937 the Pioneer Women's Memorial association presided over the unveiling of the Kansas Pioneer Memorial by Kansas born sculptor Merrell Gage,Topeka State Journal, May 11, 1937 a work very different from Baker's. In 1959 a 36' tall fiberglass sculpture by Gordon ShumakerHarris, Moira A., Monumental Minnesota: A Guide to Outdoor Sculpture, Pogp Press Inc., 1992 p. 137 was produced to commemorate the first 100 years of the Minnesota State Fair.Minnesota State Fair: The history and heritage of 100 years, p. 311-312 It stands in front of the Pioneer Building. Like the Ponca City statue, it depicts a bonneted woman in ankle length dress striding forward, and like its predecessor, she holds a large book/Bible in her right crooked arm as well as carrying a large bundle on the same arm. At 36 feet tall she more closely approaches the monumentality that Marland was originally seeking for his work. Hardship and Dreams was the title of a sculpture by Dorothy Koelling (1913-2004) unveiled in Wichita, Kansas on June 28, 1994. A newspaper article at that time described the work as being, \\"inspired by the monumental 'Pioneer Woman' in Ponca City, Okla.\\"Holman, Rhoda, Sculpture recalls hardship, dreams, The Wichita Eagle, June 27, 1994 Koeling's six foot tall statue depicts the bonneted pioneer woman, carrying a large book/Bible and bundle in her right arm, marching forward with her flatfooted son, whose hand she holds, next to her.Polk, Chris Paulsen, Beautifying Wichita through Sculpture, Project Beauty, Inc.

Watson, after H.D. HamiltonJoseph Gulston (1745–1786), was an English collector and connoisseur, and a Member of Parliament. Family Background Portrait of Joseph Gulston and his brother John in 1754, by Francis Cotes. His father, Joseph Gulston, a successful loan contractor, was M.P. for Poole from 1741 to 1765 and built the town hall there. He had secretly married Mericas, daughter of a Portuguese merchant named Sylva, and she was living at Greenwich when her son Joseph was born under the romantic circumstances which form the groundwork of Clementina Black's novel Mericas. The marriage was not acknowledged for many years, principally owing to the elder Joseph Gulston's dread of his sister, and for some time the four children were brought up in the strictest concealment. Early life Architectural drawing for Ealing Grove Upon his father's death in 1766, Joseph, who had latterly been educated at Eton College and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he matriculated 18 February 1763, found himself in possession of £250,000 in the funds, an estate in Hertfordshire worth £1,500 a year, Ealing Grove, Middlesex, and a house in Soho Square. This fortune he dissipated in collecting books and prints, in building, and in all kinds of extravagance except vicious ones. He spent £30,000 converting Ealing Grove into an Italianate villa and in 1768 started his collection of prints. His indolence equalled his extravagance; though handsome he was of a corpulent habit of body, he was elected M.P. for Poole in 1780, but lost his seat in 1784 by neglecting to get out of bed till too late in the day to solicit the votes of five Quaker constituents. Financial Crisis After a succession of expedients, sales of property, consignments of annuities, and spasmodic efforts at economy, he sold his books in June 1784. George III was a purchaser at the sale. At length, in 1786, Gulston was compelled to dispose of his unrivalled collection of prints, which, besides the works of the great masters, contained 18,000 foreign and 23,500 English portraits, 11,000 caricatures and political prints, and 14,500 topographical. The sale lasted forty days (from 16 January to 15 March 1786), but produced only £7,000, and the unfortunate possessor, overwhelmed with family cares and pecuniary difficulties, died in Bryanston Street, London, on 16 July 1786, and was buried in Ealing Church. Gulston was a most amiable man, whose faults were in great measure due to his physical constitution and defective education at the most susceptible period of his life. He was highly accomplished in many ways, and his memory was most retentive. He was partly engaged for several years in the preparation of a biographical dictionary of the foreigners who have visited England; the manuscript was purchased by a bookseller after his death, but no use seems to have been made of it. Gulston was a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. A few of his letters to his friend Granger are printed by Nichols. Family Gulston married Elizabeth Bridgetta, second daughter of Sir Thomas Stepney, Bt., a woman as extravagant as himself celebrated for her beauty and accomplishments, and as the inventor of plated harness. She was also an etcher, and etched portraits of her husband and of Dr. Francis Courayer from paintings by Hamilton in 1772 (Nichols, Lit. Anecdotes, ii. 44). She died 9 March 1780, and was buried at Ealing. A son Joseph, after a troubled career of dissipation, died at Lausanne, 18 Dec. 1790, aged 22 (see for an account of his difficulties ib. ix. 605–6). Portrait A portrait of Gulston is prefixed to Nichols's 'Literary Illustrations,' vol. v. There are mezzotint engravings of Gulston and of his wife by James Watson and Richard Earlom after paintings by Hamilton.

Facts Robins had been employed by a now insolvent company. He had a final salary pension. The company terminated the scheme and then told everyone there was not enough money to cover members’ benefits. They announced they would reduce benefits for members who had not yet started to receive pension payments. Robins claimed compensation from the Secretary of State for not providing the proper level of social protection under Directive 80/987 art 8. David Pannick QC was acting for the government. The High Court asked the ECJ whether the member state needed to fund a scheme that had run out of money, and whether the UK had properly transposed the Directive. If not, should the UK incur liability? Judgment Judge Timmermans in the ECJ held that the member state did not require pension funds should be fully guaranteed, because the member state could oblige insurers to buy insurance. However, Robins would gain benefits as low as 20% of entitlement, so the UK’s scheme under the Pensions Act 2004 section 286 (establishing the Financial Assistance Scheme) did not ‘protect’ workers like Robins within the meaning of art 8, so the provision was improperly implemented. A Member State's liability was contingent on a finding of manifest and grave disregard by that state for the limits set on its discretion, Brasserie du Pecheur SA v Germany.[1996] QB 404 (C-46/93) To answer what that meant the national court would have to take into account the clarity and precision of art 8 with regard to the level of protection required, as well as the measure of discretion left to the national authorities.

Gunn was born at Wick in Caithness in 1774, the son of Ingram Gunn, and his wife Elizabeth Miller (or Millar). He was educated at the high school, Edinburgh, and trained for the ministry by Greville Ewing at Glasgow. In 1800 he was sent to be an itinerant minister in Ireland, where he is known to have preached in Waterford and to have assisted J Kelly in Dublin. He may have married, and been widowed, while living in Ireland. In 1807, as a consequence of the unrest in Ireland he moved to Ilfracombe in Devon, where he married Catherine Vye in 1808. In 1810 he became pastor of a small congregation there. He removed in 1813 to Bishop's Hull, near Taunton, and in 1814 to Chard. Catherine died there in 1815 and was buried in the graveyard beside the chapel. In 1816, he married his third wife, Elizabeth Tice, and moved to Christchurch (then Hampshire, now Dorset). His younger brother, John Gunn, replaced him as minister at Chard. John's descendants include Battiscombe Gunn and his son J. B. Gunn. In Christchurch he found a scanty congregation, partly consisting of baptists. He promptly preached a sermon which, as he afterwards said, 'converted all the sensible baptists in the place,' and his congregation soon grew till it numbered a thousand, an extraordinary fact, considering that the whole population of Christchurch and the district within five or six miles was only about 2,500. Yet his preaching was entirely unemotional; no one was allowed to preach emotional religion in his pulpit, and the laymen whom he used to despatch into the neighbouring villages were strictly enjoined to abstain from adding anything to the printed discourses with which he provided them. His Sunday school, which was attended by upwards of four hundred children, attained a very high reputation, and attracted visitors from all parts of the country, even from America. He was almost equally successful in maintaining a day school which he established, and regulated with military precision. Ann Taylor (poet),who met him at Ilfracombe, tells of his laboriously teaching a lad how to hand a chair; he would pitilessly call back a little boy on an unmanageable pony to make him take off his hat to Mrs. Gunn if he had omitted to do so. Yet his personal influence was extraordinary. Even in the matter of subscriptions his will was law; if the collection on Sunday was not what he considered sufficient, he would put in a five-pound note, and send the plates round again. Ann Taylor's enthusiasm for 'the noble highlander' seems to have been shared by all who met him. He was three times married, and lived like a country gentleman at Burton, near Christchurch. He died at Burton on 17 June 1848, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Daniel had six children: two sons by Catherine Vye (Daniel, 1811–1890, and an unnamed son born and died in 1813) and two sons and two daughters by Elizabeth Tice (Eliza, 1818–1838, Malachi, 1820–1867, William, born and died 1822, Mary, 1825–1911) References 1774 births 1848 deaths People from Wick, Caithness 18th-century Scottish people 19th-century Scottish people Scottish Congregationalist ministers ","title":"Daniel Gunn (minister)"},{"id":"31173854","text":"This is the first edition of the tournament.

Life Gunn was born in Edinburgh about 1765. Gunn taught violoncello and flute in Cambridge. From 1789 he was in London for several years, making studies in languages and history in his leisure moments. He wrote at Cambridge his Treatise on the Origin of Stringed Instruments, and published it with his Theory and Practice of Fingering the Violoncello, with Examples, about 1789. Forty favourite Scotch Airs adapted for Violin, Violoncello, or Flute followed as a supplement to that work. In 1790 Gunn translated from the Italian A. D. R. Borghese's New and General System of Music (originally published in French, 1788, Paris). In 1795 Gunn returned to Edinburgh. An Essay on Harmony … adapted to the Violoncello was brought out at Edinburgh, 1801. About this time Gunn married Ann Young, a pianist, and author of Elements of Music, An Introduction to Music, and some ingenious musical games. In 1805 General Robertson of Lude, Perthshire, sent 2 harps, including what is now known as the Queen Mary Harp to the Highland Society of Scotland, in Edinburgh, The Society commissioned Gunn to inspect the instruments, and he read his report on the harp to the Society later that year.

The Best Brewing Company was purchased by Captain Frederick Pabst and renamed the Pabst Brewing Company. The school and grounds were purchased by Captain Frederick Pabst in 1890 for the playground. Captain Frederick Pabst wanted to build a bottling house on the playground area, and decided to use the school for the corporate offices. He had alterations made to the building, including improving the school’s original tower and turning the cornice on the roof into battlements. The Visitor’s Center and Gift Shop were added to the structure in 1934 after Prohibition ended.

Henry Gunning Life Gunning was born at Newton, Cambridgeshire, on 13 February 1768. His father, Francis Gunning, who was vicar of Newton and also of the adjacent parishes of Thriplow and Hauxton, was grandson of William Gunning, the first cousin and secretary of Peter Gunning, successively bishop of Chichester and Ely. Henry was educated first at Ely, in a school kept by Jeffrey Bentham, a minor canon of the cathedral, and brother of James Bentham; and afterwards in the endowed school of Sleaford, under the Rev. Edward Waterson. He entered Christ's College, Cambridge, as a sizar in October 1784, became a scholar of that house, and graduated B.A. as sixth wrangler in 1788 (M.A. 1791). On 13 October 1789 he was elected one of the esquire bedells of the university.Charles Henry Cooper, Annals of Cambridge, iv. 437 He became senior esquire bedell in 1827. In that capacity he received gold chains from three successive chancellors of the university, viz. John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden, 1834, the Duke of Northumberland, 1844, and Prince Albert, 1847. An advanced Whig in politics, Gunning took an active part in local politics, was a strenuous supporter of the cause of parliamentary reform, and, after the passing of the Municipal Corporations Act, was from 1835 to 1841 a member of the town council of Cambridge. In 1847 an accidental fall left him incurably lame. His official connection with the university continued for more than sixty-five years. He was highly esteemed for his courtesy, gentlemanly bearing, and readiness to communicate his extensive knowledge respecting academic ceremonies and privileges. He died in Brighton on 4 January 1854. Works Gunning's major literary work was Reminiscences of the University, Town, and County of Cambridge from the year 1780 [to 1820], 2 vols. London, 1854. He did not begin these sketches until he was over 80 years old. The work was published posthumously; it had been dictated to an amanuensis, Miss M. Beart, who prepared it for publication. Prefixed to the first volume is a portrait of the author, lithographed by Day & Son. A portrait of him, in oil, painted by Dr. Woodhouse, is in the possession of Mrs. Cooper of Cambridge, widow of Charles Henry Cooper. Gunning also prepared a new edition of Adam Wall's Ceremonies observed in the Senate House of the University of Cambridge, Cambridge, 1828, and wrote a pamphlet on Compositions for Degrees, 1850. Family Gunning married in 1794 Miss Bertram, whom he survived many years. His eldest son, and the only one who survived him, was Henry Bertram Gunning of Little Shelford, Cambridgeshire, a charity commissioner and an assistant tithe commissioner.

He married, in 1768, Dorothy, sister of Richard Warren, Physician to the King. Early career Gunning was born at Swainswick and educated at Winchester. He was the assistant surgeon to St. George's Hospital, London, from 21 January 1760 to 4 January 1765, and full surgeon from that date till his death. In 1773 he was elected Steward of Anatomy by the Surgeons' Company, but paid a fine rather than serve. In 1789 he was elected Examiner on the death of Percivall Pott, and in the same year he was chosen Master of the Company, and signalised his year of office by a firm effort to reform its administration and reorganise its work. His attack upon the expensive system of dinners of the courts of assistants and of examiners, and his philippic on retiring from office on 1 July 1790, as recorded by South, show that he could be fearlessly outspoken. :\\"Your theatre\\", he says, in his last address, \\"is without lectures, your library-room without books is converted into an office for your clerk, and your committee-room is become his eating-parlour … If, gentlemen, you make no better use of the hall than what you have already done, you had better sell it, and apply the money for the good of the company in some other way\\". The Court of Assistants appointed a committee to consider the question, and numerous reforms were effected. In 1790 Gunning was appointed the first professor of surgery; but he soon resigned on the plea that it occupied too much of his time, and no new appointment was made. Gunning had been appointed Surgeon-General of the army in 1793, on the death of John Hunter; he was also senior Surgeon Extraordinary to the King. Conflict with John Hunter Gunning was in general opposed to his colleague at St. George's, John Hunter, who was frequently overbearing to his professional brethren, and appeared to them to neglect the proper business of a surgeon for unpractical pursuits. The quarrel rose to a great pitch when a surgeon was elected in succession to Charles Hawkins (1750-1816), who had resigned. Thomas Keate (1745-1821) was supported by Gunning, and Everard Home by Hunter, and after a sharp contest Keate was elected. A dispute ensued about fees for surgical lectures, which led to a controversy between Gunning, senior surgeon, supported by two of his colleagues, and Hunter (see the account in Drewry Ottley, Life of John Hunter, pp. 126–132). It ended in John Hunter's dramatically sudden death on 16 Oct. 1793, immediately after being flatly contradicted by one of his colleagues, apparently Gunning. The sale of Surgeon's Hall In 1796 it was determined to sell the Surgeons' Hall on account of the expense attending its repair; but on 7 July Gunning, on behalf of the committee, reported that as no one had bid within £200 of the price set upon it, it had been bought in. At the same court Henry Cline was elected a member of the Court of Assistants, in the absence of a governor (one having just died, and the other being blind and paralysed in Warwickshire). This voided the charter. A bill brought into parliament in 1797 to indemnify the company, and to give it greater power over the profession, after passing the commons, was lost in the House of Lords by the influence of Thurlow, owing, it is said, to a grudge against Gunning. Thurlow having said, \\"There's no more science in surgery than in butchery\\" (a remark apparently prompted by his brother's death while undergoing treatment by Hunter). Gunning had retorted: \\"Then, my lord, I heartily pray that your lordship may break your leg, and have only a butcher to set it\\". Gunning died at Bath on 14 Feb. 1798, leaving five children.

Located southeast of St. Petersburg in northwestern Russia, it has a planned capacity for a further 50,000 new burials of previously lost German war dead.  History  One of the central ways. In the background the Russian-orthodox church. In September 2000, the Sologubovka Cemetery was opened in the presence of German and Russian officials, including many German veterans hoping to find lost comrades. The cemetery is one of dozens opened or refurbished since the end of the Cold War by the German War Graves Commission, which is tasked with restoring and maintaining the graves of German soldiers from both world wars. Most of the fallen soldiers remained lost or unknown for over forty years, their graves destroyed, abandoned or simply unknown. Russian sentiment The cemetery's opening ceremony was boycotted by some Russian Siege of Leningrad veterans, but local residents showed appreciation for the refurbishment of the church and road improvements provided by Germany. More than 700,000 Soviets died during the Battle of Leningrad near Sologubovka, presumably in combat with those Germans buried here. Lingering anti-German sentiment over the war in general and the fact that the USSR frequently did not bury its own war dead was mentioned in the press, but no protests or overt hostility towards the new German presence was reported.  Lost German war dead  Sologubovka Cemetery: Names of dead soldiers Orthodox Church Up to 10,000 German military dead are found and buried each year in this part of Russia. The cemetery has become a point of reconciliation between German and Russian youth, who jointly search for unmarked graves around Sologubovka and elsewhere in Russia. The Goethe- Institut sponsors events and exhibitions at Sologubovka Cemetery to heighten awareness of the missing soldiers from World War II and to facilitate mutual German-Russian understanding and recognition of war dead. The German War Graves Commission estimates there are still many thousands of German unmarked war graves throughout Russia and areas of the former Eastern Front but has successfully located and reinterred over 600,000 in German sponsored cemeteries like Sologubovka since the end of the Cold War.

It is located in Mexico City far inland from the coast, because of historical patterns of commerce in the country. The market handles 1,500 tons of seafood daily, representing about 60% of the total market. Most of the seafood is distributed to the Mexico City metropolitan area and the states surrounding it, but there is distribution to other states and abroad. History La Viga canal 1902 Moonlight on the Viga Canal, Helen Hyde, 1912 The major distribution of seafood products has been centered in Mexico City for many years, first at the La Viga Market in the borough of Iztacalco and now at the La Nueva Viga Market in Iztapalapa. The reason the main seafood market is in the capital, rather than in a coastal city, is that Mexico City has a long history of being the economic center of the country. Since pre Hispanic times, much of the seafood and other produce either ended up or passed through here. The people of the Mexico City area have also become accustomed to enjoying the bounty provided by almost all of the states, so the demand for seafood is greatest here. The first La Viga Market was established near the La Viga Canal, which was named after a 19th-century ranch. In the 19th century, this area was filled with drying land, with artificial islands called “chinampas” and canals,including La Viga, which linked Chalco and Xochimilco, which still had their lakes, to the lake port of San Lázaro, near the historic center of Mexico City. The canal and others in the area were drained and filled in very early in the 20th century, with the La Viga Canal becoming the Calzada de La Viga road. Around this new road, industries and neighborhoods emerged. The old La Viga Market still exists and still sells mostly wholesale, but its customers are more local, such as retailers and restaurants in Mexico City. La Nueva Viga was established in the mid 1990s because the demand for wholesale seafood outstripped the old traditional market’s ability to distribute. It has become one of the most important markets in Latin America, and the second largest seafood market in the world, after Tokyo's Tsukiji fish market . It and the Mercado del Mar in Zapopan, Jalisco control almost all of the seafood distribution in the country. Both the old traditional market and the new one are under the same management. The former market chairman was in the position for fifteen years. That term has since been shortened and the current chairman, Jorge Toral Peña, has only a three-year term. He plans a change in the retail area to include a gourmet plaza and area permanently dedicated to promoting the health benefits of eating seafood. On Saturdays, the market hosts cooking classes and hosts contests for seafood recipes. Description Unloading truck at the market La Nueva Viga is located on Prologación Eje 6 Sur, Colonia San José Aculco, Iztapalapa . It is located on the property of the government owned Central de Abasto, but this market is privately owned. The facility extends over 9.2 hectares, with 202 wholesale warehouses, 55 retail warehouses and 165 sellers in total. Four warehouses have certified products and another 80 have been ranked as having excellent handling practices, expecting certification. While by far most of the businesses inside sell fresh and frozen fish, there are other businesses selling kitchen supplies and groceries, and even banks. Outside there is some public transportation and freight services. The workday starts early, at 4 AM, when trucks loaded with fresh seafood arrive. Between 20,000 and 25,000 customers pass through the facility on any given day. Many clients are restaurant owners from in and around Mexico City. From 6 AM, when stalls open, to 6 PM, the market is filled with the shouts of merchants attracting customers, as well as the sounds of blades as mountains of fish and other seafood are gutted, chopped and otherwise prepared. The market employs about 7,500 people, many of whom are from coastal areas and are used to the strong odor of fish that permeates the interior. Products sold Worker showing off product from truck La Nueva Viga handles the largest volume of seafood and has the largest assortment of ocean products in Mexico. Approximately 300 different fresh and frozen species and approximately 100 imported frozen species are marketed every day in this supply center. This includes every kind of fish imaginable to shellfish, shrimp, and even sharks and manta rays. An average of 500 tons of fresh fish and 1000 tons of frozen products are handled each day, about sixty percent of the national fishing production, and the second largest volume in the world after the fish market in Tokyo. Most of the seafood is domestic, but imported product can be found from five continents. The seafood comes from all of the coasts of Mexico, but most domestic product comes from the Gulf of Mexico. There is a website dedicated to the inventory of the market, which is updated daily at Lent is the busiest season for La Nueva Viga and all seafood vendors of Mexico. In 2010, La Nueva Viga sales during this season were 2,500 tons per day. At this time, there are more than one hundred species of fish and shellfish in season, with some selling as low as twelve pesos per kilo. For this important time, federal health officials inspect this and other markets to check for contaminants such as salmonella bacteria and various parasites, in order to reassure the public that the supply is safe. Most of the seafood sold here is sent to other states and exported as well as sold to more local restaurants and retail markets. Seventy percent of the product sold goes to the city and the neighboring states of Hidalgo, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Morelos and State of Mexico. Much of what is exported is the most expensive, such as sea bass, shrimp, and lobster. However, the most economical species are often not sold in Mexico either as they are unknown to most people’s dietary habits. By far, the most popular seafood sold here and in the rest of Mexico is shrimp, followed weakly by mojarra. For popular species of fish, vendors report that little is wasted. Even the heads, which are often chopped off for clients are reused. The meat inside them is taken out and sold as is or formed into croquets. Spines and other bones with scraps are sold for the making of stock. However, an estimated seven tons of product per day consisting of less popular species is wasted because it does not sell in time. While the locations selling fresh and frozen fish dominate the market, there are a number of other businesses in the facility as well. The market also has a large number of prepared food stands selling tamales, tacos, cocktails, fillets and other seafood dishes. There are also business selling knives, copper cookware, other kitchen utensils, groceries, banks and government offices. Challenges One major challenge to the market is the decline in sales of domestically produced seafood. These have fallen as much as forty percent by some estimates. Vendors at the market claim that some is due to competition from foreign seafood, but most is due to the lack of promotion of seafood by federal government officials, even the Comité Nacional de Fomento al Consumo de Producto Pesquero, which is tasked to do just that. The complaint is that this committee only promotes seafood during the Lent. Due to free trade agreements, seafood from countries such as China, Panama and Chile are appearing at the market and now account for about 10 percent of the sales. Domestic seafood is generally better quality as it spends less or no time frozen, but the frozen imported product is often cheaper. Common imported species include tilapia, shark, sparidae or porgies and carp . Another problem is that although the market is only fifteen or so years old, the facility has experienced severe deterioration in that short time. One of the major problems is insufficient drainage, leading to bacterial build up and causing the interior to smell very strongly. However, there are also serious problems with the facilities ceilings and floors as well. Renovation costs are estimated at 100 million pesos. As the market is a private operation, separate from the government, Mexico City authorities state that they cannot provide the financing needed for renovations, but are working with private sources to find alternatives.} The market faces competition with a planned market in Baja California, which accounts for 75% of the seafood produced in Mexico. One reason this market is planned is because of the sanitation problems at La Viga. One last problem is that there is a lack of public transportation to the facility, making it difficult for many retail buyers to shop here.

The tunnel was officially opened on 20 December 2016 and opened to traffic on 22 December 2016. The double-deck tunnel connects Kumkapı on the European part and Koşuyolu, Kadıköy, on the Asian part of IstanbulWhile, for both directions, the mouth openings of the tunnel on the Asian side are situated in the Haydarpaşa quarter, the access roads begin or end in the adjacent Koşuyolu quarter. with a route including the tunnel approach roads. It crosses the Bosphorus beneath the seabed at a maximum depth of −106 m. It is about 1 km south of the undersea railway tunnel Marmaray, which was opened on 29 October 2013. The journey between the two continents takes about 5 minutes. Toll is collected in both directions; as of 2018, ₺36.40 (about $4 US) for cars and ₺54.70 ($6 US) for minibuses. Background The conceptual background of Eurasia Tunnel reaches back to the findings of the 1997 Transportation Master Plan undertaken by Istanbul University on behalf of Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Based on this plan, a pre-feasibility study had been conducted in 2003 for a new Bosphorus crossing. According to the results of this study, a road tunnel was recommended as the solution that offered the highest degree of feasibility. The Ministry of Transportation, Maritime and Communication of Turkey commissioned a feasibility study by Nippon Koei Co. Ltd. in 2005 to assess route alternatives for a new tunnel crossing. Based on environmental and social criteria, cost and risk factors, the study concluded by supporting the initially proposed route as the preferred option. The three current bridges across the Bosphorus were taken into consideration in selecting the tunnel's location, which was put further south to better balance the distribution of traffic between the crossings. Other selection criteria included the route's lower investment cost due to a shorter tunnel length and the availability of sufficient space for construction sites and operational buildings (toll plaza, administrative units). High level assessments based on corridor alternatives that are comprehensively defined in the feasibility study also support the selection of the proposed route in terms of environmental and social costs and risk factors. Investors Avrasya Tüneli İşletme İnşaat ve Yatırım A.Ş. (ATAŞ) was founded on 26 October 2009 by the partnership of Yapı Merkezi from Turkey and SK E&C; from South Korea.

A hedging facility for the transaction is provided by some of the lenders as well as Deutsche Bank. Entering the Eurasia Tunnel Project segments The project consists of three main segments: ;European side Construction of five U-turns as underpasses and seven pedestrian crossings as overpasses along Kennedy Street that stretches between Kazlıçeşme and Sarayburnu as a shoreline road beside the Sea of Marmara. Widening of the entire Segment 1, which is approximately , from 3x2 lanes to 2x4 lanes. ;Bosphorus crossing Construction of a , two-deck road tunnel with two lanes on each deck, a toll plaza and an administrative building on the western end and ventilation shafts on both ends of the tunnel. ;Asian side Widening from 2x3 and 2x4 lanes to 2x4 and 2x5 lanes along an approximately stretch of the current D100 road that links at Göztepe to Ankara-İstanbul State Highway, and construction of 2 bridge intersections, 1 overpass and 3 pedestrian bridges. Technical details The American firm Parsons Brinckerhoff (now WSP) was responsible for the design, while the British Arup Group and American Jacobs Engineering Group undertook the technical and traffic studies and HNTB provided independent design verification. The geotechnical survey was by the Dutch consultancy Fugro. The tunnel boring machine (TBM) was supplied by the German manufacturer Herrenknecht. The Italian company Italferr was in charge of works management and project review on behalf of Administration.A Italferr la supervisione lavori del Tunnel Eurasia e la revisione del progetto. Italferr, 2014. The French company Egis Group will be in charge of the operation and maintenance.Galante, Grace: The Eurasia tunnel under the Bosphorus opens to the public. ccworldconstruction.com, December 21, 2016. The TBM section crossing the Bosphorus is long while another is constructed by New Austrian Tunnelling method (NATM) and cut-and-cover method. The tunnel's excavation diameter is , which allows an inner diameter of with -thick lining. The tunnel alignment is located in a seismically active region, about 17 km to the North Anatolian Fault Zone. To decrease the seismic stresses/strains below the permissible levels, two flexible seismic joints/segments; with displacement limits of ±50 mm for shear and ±75 mm for extraction/contraction; were innovated, designed specially, localized through geological/geophysical/geotechnical conditions, tested in laboratory; implemented ‘first time’ in TBM tunnelling under similar severe conditions. The design earthquake magnitude was specified as moment magnitude of 7.25 and design of functional and safety evaluation earthquakes have a return period of 500 and 2,500 years, respectively. Seismic joint locations defined during design phase were verified through continuous monitoring of cutterhead torques. The 3,340 m tunnel was excavated and constructed with a 13.7 m diameter Mixshield Slurry TBM exclusively designed and equipped with the latest 19” (483 mm) disc cutters (35 pieces monoblock disc cutters, all atmospherically changeable and have individual wearing sensor system), 192 piece cutting knives (only 48 atmospherically changeable), special pressurized locks for divers and material and rescue chamber for all shift members. Slurry Treatment Plant (installed power of 3.5 MW) which de-silts the bentonite slurry used during excavation and regenerates with capacity (approximately equivalent to 20 m/day) was installed. The utilized TBM ranks first in the world with its 33 kW per square meter cutterhead power, second with its 12.0 bar pressure design; and sixth with its excavation area. TBM operation was completed within ±5 cm tolerance in 479 calendar days, resulting in an average advance rate of 7.0 m/day (9.0 m/day for working days) by three crews 24/7. The maximum advance rate was realized at marine sediment zone with 18.0 m/day. Spent direct time for excavation and ringbuild were around 3,500 and 1,700 hours, respectively. In Trakya formation, 28 dyke zones were excavated with an average frequency of 90 m and thicknesses were varying between 1 and 120 m. Furthermore, 440 disc cutters, 85 scrapers and 475 brushes were replaced by TBM crew and four times hyperbaric maintenance operations (total of 45 days) with specially trained divers (max. under 10.8 bar first time in the world) were successfully performed. 15,048 piece 600-mm-thick precast segments (1,672 rings) with the high performance (average charge passed is 280 Coulomb (1,000 Coulomb limit) were produced and connected to each other by using 30,765 bolts. Each ring consists of nine segments that had an average 28 day cylinder compressive strength of 70 MPa and can resist at least 127 years as a service life against subsea conditions. Only 0.3% of produced segments were found to be deficient due to existence of cracks width more than 0.2 mm. On the other hand, twin tunnels (each has approximately 950 m length) were completed in 445 calendar days with a cross section of each by classical mining method. These tunnels were excavated in Trakya Formation from four faces with a 1.4 m/day/face advance rate under a densely populated district with minimum and maximum overburden of 8 m and 41 m, respectively. Both tunnels met up each other within ±2 mm tolerance. The largest converge measured at the tunnel crown was 33 mm (design tolerance is 50 mm) with a maximum 10 mm surface settlement. The tunnel is designed so that it has protected emergency rooms in a distance of 200 m to provide shelter, also escape route to the other tunnel level. Every there will be an emergency lane equipped with emergency telephone. The speed limit in the tunnel route . A daily average of around 120,000 cars and light vehicles is expected to pass through the tunnel after the first year. The toll is planned to be Turkish lira equivalent of $4 US plus VAT for cars and $6 US plus VAT for minibusses in each direction. The toll rate will change in accordance with US Consumer Price Index.

Life Gurney was born at Earlham Hall, near Norwich, on 9 March 1791. He was youngest son of John Gurney (1749–1809) of Earlham, Norfolk, and brother of Elizabeth Fry, the philanthropist, Louisa Gurney Hoare, the writer on education, and Joseph John Gurney and Samuel Gurney, all of whom are separately noticed. His mother, Catherine, daughter of Daniel Bell, died in 1792. He descended directly from a younger branch of the ancient family of Gurney or Gournay, which held manors in Norfolk (in the time of Henry II). After completing his education Gurney entered the Norwich firm of Gurney's Bank, of which he was afterwards the head, and for more than sixty years a partner. He wrote several essays on banking, which were printed for private circulation. As the head of one of the first banks in the English provinces, he had much influence both socially and politically. His amiability, courtesy and generosity greatly endeared him to his contemporaries. Gurney was mainly instrumental in establishing the West Norfolk and Lynn Hospital. One of Gurney's favourite pursuits was archæology, and he was a prominent fellow of the Society of Antiquaries. He took great interest in genealogy. In 1848 he printed in two volumes for private circulation an elaborate work entitled The Record of the House of Gournay, to which he added a supplement in 1858. The book was highly valued for its varied antiquarian information and research. Gurney, who was a conservative in politics, was a justice of the peace and deputy-lieutenant for the county of Norfolk, and filled the office of High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1853. He married in 1822 the Lady Harriet Jemima Hay (1803–1837), daughter of William Hay, 17th Earl of Erroll, by whom he had nine children. Their son, Charles Henry Gurney, who married a daughter of Henry Thoby Prinsep, graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge and became a partner in Saunderson's Bank in London.

He served as the head of the Department of Stellar Astronomy at M.V. Lomonosov Moscow State University and a Corresponding Member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Early life and education Pavel Petrovich Parenago was born into the family of a physician on 20 March 1906, in Krasnodar, present-day Russia. He completed his middle school education in Moscow in 1922, having begun scientific work while still in senior classes. He went on to graduate from Moscow State University in 1929 as a trained and qualified scientist. Research In 1932, Parenago began studies of the structure and kinematics of the Milky Way based primarily on star data. He and a colleague, B.V. Kukarkin, began an extensive compilation of variable star data. During his studies, Parenago observed approximately 3,000 stars in the Orion nebula region of the galaxy, the nearest star creating region to the Sun. Parenago then assumed a post at Moscow University as reader in stellar astronomy, becoming the first person to teach a lecture course on the subject of galactic astronomy in the Soviet Union in 1934. In 1939, he gained full professorship and organized the Department of Stellar Astronomy, which he was named head of in 1940. Parenago then authored a textbook entitled Course in Stellar Astronomy. In 1940, Parenago began investigating the absorption of light in interstellar space, during which he made discoveries relevant to this area of research. He also had an avid interest in amateur astronomy and published works and lectured in order to educate the public on the subject. He performed research on dwarf stars, hoping to find a cause for their unusual velocities, as well as the dynamics of star systems. After being elected Corresponding Member of the Academy of Sciences in 1953, he became the first person to be awarded the Bredikhin Prize, an award founded by the Academy, in 1954.

Appearance The body is long and about as deep as it is wide. A serrated dorsal fin runs along most of the body until it meets the caudal fin. The pectoral fins attach just behind and below the gill openings and are the primary means of locomotion, providing a slow, graceful appearance. The pattern of the fish consists of irregular vertical bands along the flanks of the fish, that do not extend completely onto the ventral surface. They are normally a whitish-yellow colour, but are available in an albino and platinum colour morph. In the wild colour morph black spots are seen on and around the head, body and caudal fin. This is 'lower jaw' polypterus, and thus has a prominent lower jaw longer than the upper jaw. P. endlicheri endlicheri is one of the larger Polypterus species attaining a record maximum size of 30\\". The head is small and lizard-like with a large gaping mouth and small eyes on either side. Since its eyesight is poor the bichir primarily hunts by smell. External nostrils protrude from the nose of the fish to enable this. The fish has a pair of primitive lungs instead of a swim bladder, allowing it to periodically gulp air from the surface of the water. In the aquarium bichirs can be observed dashing to the surface for this purpose. Provided the skin remains moist, the creature can remain out of the water for near indefinite periods of time.

(died 1648) was an English clergyman and anti-Catholic writer. Life Gurney was son of Henry Gurney of West Barsham and Ellingham, Norfolk, by his wife Ellen, daughter of John Blennerhasset of Barsham, Suffolk. He matriculated at Queens' College, Cambridge, on 30 October 1594, and graduated B.A. in 1600. He was elected Norfolk fellow of Corpus Christi College in 1601, proceeded M.A. in 1602, and B.D. in 1609. In 1607 he was suspended from his fellowship for not being in orders, but was reinstated by the vice-chancellor. In 1614 he left Cambridge, on being presented to the rectory of Edgefield, Norfolk, which he held till 1620, when he received that of Harpley, Norfolk. Gurney was inclined to puritanism, as appears from his writings. On one occasion he was cited to appear before the bishop for not using a surplice, and on being told he was expected to always wear it, 'came home, and rode a journey with it on.' He further made his citation the occasion for publishing his tract vindicating the Second Commandment. Thomas Fuller, who was personally acquainted with him, says: 'He was an excellent scholar, could be humourous, and would be serious as he was himself disposed. His humours were never prophane towards God or injurious towards his neighbours.' Gurney died in 1648, and was buried at St. Peter's Mancroft, Norwich, on 14 May in that year. His successor at Harpley was instituted on the following day. It is therefore plain that Gurney conformed to the covenant, and that the Dr. Gurney whom Walker mentions as a sequestered clergyman living in 1650 was another person.Sufferings, pt. ii. p. 260 Gurney was married, and apparently had a son called Protestant (d. 1624—monument at Harpley).

He attended Grand Canyon University from 1982 to 1983. He posted a 16–5 record with a 3.28 earned run average (ERA) in his two years on the school's baseball team, who won the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Championship in 1982. As a member of the school's 1982 baseball team, Stapleton is enshrined in Grand Canyon University's athletic hall of fame. Playing career In 1983, Stapleton was signed by the Milwaukee Brewers as an amateur free agent. He began his professional career in 1984 in Milwaukee's minor league organization. With the Class-A Beloit Brewers that season, he went 9–6 with a 2.33 ERA in 48 games, all in relief. Milwaukee assigned Stapleton to the Stockton Ports of the Class-A California League in 1985. With the Ports, he compiled a 2–9 record with a 2.54 ERA in 52 relief appearances. Stapleton was promoted to the Double-A level in 1986. With the El Paso Diablos of the Texas League that year, he compiled a 6–2 record with a 3.15 ERA in 38 relief appearances. Stapleton started the 1987 season with the Double-A El Paso Diablos, where in four games he compiled a 1.74 ERA. He was soon promoted to the Triple-A Denver Bears. Stapleton went 11–3 with a 4.05 ERA, five saves and 74 strikeouts in 44 games, nine of which were starts. Of his nine starts, Stapleton went for a complete game in four and pitched a shutout in one. During the month of August with the Bears, Stapleton went a perfect 6–0. He was called up to the Milwaukee Brewers on September 14, 1987. He made his Major League Baseball debut that day, earning a win in 3 innings pitched against the New York Yankees. Stapleton finished the 1987 season with Milwaukee going 2–0 with a 1.84 ERA and 14 strikeouts in four games, all in relief. In January 1988, Stapleton re-signed with the Milwaukee Brewers. That year, he started the season in the major leagues. He made his season debut that year against the Boston Red Sox, pitching 1 innings, giving-up no runs on two hits. After just six games with the Brewers, Stapleton suffered a shoulder injury, which ended his season. In those games, he compiled no wins or losses with a 5.93 ERA and six strikeouts. Stapleton was removed from the Brewers 40-man roster after undergoing surgery on his injured shoulder. After the season, the Houston Astros selected him in the Rule 5 draft. In 1989, Stapleton played with the Houston Astros during spring training. Before the start of the regular season, the Astros returned Stapleton to the Milwaukee Brewers. After pitching in extended spring training, the Brewers assigned Stapleton to the Triple-A Denver Bears. He spent the entire season with Denver, going 2–6 with a 5.10 ERA, one save and 46 strikeouts in 34 games, 10 of which were starts. Coaching career In 2001, Stapleton was hired as the head baseball coach of his alma mater, Grand Canyon University. In 2002, he led the team to a 38–21 record.

He was a member of the Gurney family. Keswick Hall, residence of Hudson Gurney and many other members of the family Life Gurney was born at Norwich on 19 January 1775, the eldest son of Richard Gurney of Keswick Hall, Norfolk, by his first wife, Agatha, daughter of David Barclay of Youngsbury, Hertfordshire; Anna Gurney was his sister. He was educated by his grandfather Barclay, by Thomas Young, and by John Hodgkin. He inherited a fortune from his father in 1811. In early life he travelled on the continent with his friend George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen. Gurney was briefly M.P. for Shaftesbury from 1812 to 1813, the election being voided on petition. In March 1816 he was elected M.P. for Newtown, Isle of Wight, sitting in five successive parliaments until 1832. He served much on committees. He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk for 1835–36. He was elected fellow of the Society of Antiquaries on 12 March 1818, and was vice-president from 1822 to 1846.Spencer, Howard and Salmon, Philip. \\"Gurney Hudson\\", The History of Parliament He contributed to the society many hundreds of pounds for the publication of Anglo-Saxon works. He was also a Fellow of the Royal Society (elected 15 January 1818), a member of the British Archæological Association from 1843, vice-president of the Norfolk and Norwich Archæological Society and a supporter of the Norwich Museum and Literary Institute. Gurney lived at Keswick Hall and in St. James's Square, London, where he saw much society till the last twenty years of his life, when he suffered from ill-health. He died at Keswick Hall on 9 November 1864, and was buried in Intwood churchyard, near Norwich. He was the head of the Norfolk family of the Gurneys, and his fortune was inherited mostly by John Henry Gurney. Gurney is described as having a habit of questioning everything: \\"he seemed never to agree with you\\"; but he was kind, liberal, and hospitable. He married in 1809 Margaret (d. 1855), daughter of Robert Barclay, M.P., of Ury, Kincardineshire. They had no children. Gurney's portrait (when about 20) was painted by Opie, and also, about 1840, by Briggs. Works His first publication was a privately printed English History and Chronology in Rhyme. In 1799 he published Cupid and Psyche, an imitation in verse of the Golden Ass of Apuleius (also 1800, 1801, and in Bohn's Classical Library, Apuleius). He also published Heads of Ancient History, (1814); Memoir of Thomas Young, M.D., (1831) Letter to Dawson Turner on Norwich and the Venta Icenorum (Norwich, 1847); and \\"Orlando Furioso\\" (1843), a verse translation, written in 1808, of parts of the poem.

He purchased from the widow of Samuel Woodward all his manuscripts, drawings, and books on Norfolk topography, and printed for Mrs. Woodward's benefit the Norfolk Topographer's Manual and the History of Norwich Castle. He possessed a library of from ten to fifteen thousand volumes, in every one of which he used to boast he had read. He left some diaries, which were not to be published for fifty years.

One implementation is a set of four MIDI keyboards arranged vertically. The patent for this musical technology obtained by Grant Johnson, inventor, in 1995, specifically identifies the seven chords that exist for each key signature, and how these key signatures can be selected at any time while playing the instrument to achieve a key signature change, and thus an instant change in chords. In every key signature there are seven chords, and each of these chords are identified on the chordboard as follows (signified by the Nashville Number System): * I chord is major tonality, referred to as ROOT CHORD * ii chord is minor tonality, referred to as SUPER TONIC CHORD * iii chord is minor tonality, referred to as MEDIANT CHORD * IV chord is minor tonality, referred to as SUB-DOMINANT CHORD * V chord is minor tonality, referred to as DOMINANT CHORD * vi chord is minor tonality, referred to as SUB-MEDIANT CHORD * vii chord is minor tonality, referred to as LEADING TONE CHORD Pressing a key on any one of the chordboard's four keyboards sounds a single note within the chord zone. Each key plays only one note. To play a chord, the musician plays two or more keys, similar to a piano. History The chordboard original started as a prototype stand alone self-contained unit created by Grant Johnson (inventor/musician), but evolved into a software based musical instrument that could work with a variety of hardware devices, as music technology has continually evolved centered around a DAW. With the advent of readily available Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) easily accessible to the consumer masses on account of much lower cost options (with some being freely available i.e. Audacity), the chordboard can be configured using any type of MIDI keyboard connected via USB to a MAC or PC computer. The Chordboard evolved to a set of vertically stacked keyboards and was dubbed the Chordboard STAC, consisting of four midi controller keyboards (61 keys each) and where the black keys were disabled in software and only the white keys were mapped to various harmonic notes within the chord, depending on genre. For instance, in a JAZZ genre, the STAC would utilize chord voicings that were compatible with larger chords such as the 9th, 11th, and 13th. The STAC allowed for key changes, genre changes, on the fly by a programmable section of keys on the top keyboard. All seven chords within any key signature selected were represented by the STAC (see photo). Functionality Large symphonic chord voicings can be played on the chordboard with 12 notes available for each of the seven chord zones (84 active notes total). Each white key on the MIDI keyboard used represents an individual note within a chord zone, and is mapped to a note within a harmonic chord voicing pattern programmed for each chord, according to major-minor tonality and a particular voicing style (such as classic, jazz, or oriental). Due to the chord voicing mapping that takes place within the software, the entry level learning curve is short. In contrast, because of the millions of possible chord voicings between each of the seven chords in a key signature, more advanced level playing technique can take place, but over a much longer period of time. The chordboard interface is made up of 7 different active chords, with the option to change chord values based on every possible key signature variation (24 unique sets of key signatures, 12 major and 12 minor each in the keys of C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, Gb, G, Ab, A, Bb, B). Each chord value can instantly change, depending on which key signature the player selects from the top keyboard in the stack of four MIDI keyboards. For example, in the Key of C, the I chord is C major, and the II chord is D minor, and so on up the scale. The chordboard allows the player to select key signature changes on the fly, and chord style, or genre changes also on the fly, facilitating a vast variety of chord voicings available for each chord.

The LPA replaced the former enduring powers of attorney (EPA) which were narrower in scope. Their purpose is to meet the needs of those who can see a time when they will not be able – in the words of the Act, will lack capacity – to look after their own personal, financial or business affairs. The LPA allows them to make appropriate arrangements for family members or trusted friends to be authorised to make decisions on their behalf. The LPA is created and registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), an executive agency of the Ministry of Justice of the United Kingdom. Purpose The LPA is a specific form of the more general power of attorney which is widely used in countries which have a common law system. The word attorney in this context is someone (or in some circumstances an organisation such as a company) legally appointed or empowered to act for another person. The person giving the power is known as the donor. The word 'lasting' in the context of an LPA means that the power may continue even if the person (though still alive) no longer has capacity to exercise the power. The Lasting Power of Attorney can be applied for online.Office of the Public Guardian, Make a lasting power of attorney The gov.uk tool offers guidance throughout the process, and prevents the user from making mistakes that may invalidate their LPA application. The former EPA was simple to administer, but failed to provide for some decisions which may have to be made in circumstances that preclude their being made by the person principally affected. In particular, the attorney's powers under the EPA were largely defined in terms of money and property, and were not related to decisions on medical matters such as the continuation or otherwise cessation of life-sustaining treatment, or welfare matters such as a move to a different kind of accommodation. The primary purpose of the changes under Mental Capacity Act 2005 (MCA 2005) was to rectify this omission, by creating two types of LPA:Office of the Public Guardian, Make, register or end a lasting power of attorney, accessed 1 September 2020 one for property and financial affairs (the LPA(PFA)) and one for health and welfare (the LPA(H&W;)).  Business Lasting Power of Attorney  While the LPA is primarily designed to deal with personal affairs and finances, business owners or directors are faced with more complex considerations. While a close friend or family member may be suitable for managing personal affairs in times of incapacity, businesses may require subject matter experts and depending on the business structure, there are certain governance requirements. Therefore, the Business Lasting Power of Attorney (BLPA) is a separate arrangement that is similar in function to the LPA. Business owners arranging a LPA and BLPA can therefore split between personal and business affairs. Administrative and legal background The LPA system is administered by the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG), an agency of the Ministry of Justice of the United Kingdom. Its contact details are explained in section 2.2 below headed 'The role of the OPG in relation to Lasting Powers of Attorney'. The OPG was set up in 2007 under the MCA 2005, replacing the similarly-named Public Guardianship Office which had a more limited range of responsibilities. It is headed by the Public Guardian, whose main role is the protection of people who lack mental capacity. The MCA 2005 provides a statutory framework to empower and protect vulnerable people who are not able to make their own decisions. It makes clear who can take decisions on their behalf, in which situations, and how they should do so. Through the LPA, the Act enables people to plan ahead for a time when they may lose capacity. Detailed guidance is provided by a Code of Practice to the MCA 2005Code of Practice to MCA 2005, published by the Ministry of Justice: to the Act, which people working as professionals in this field are required to 'have regard to': that is, to observe, unless (having decided in specific circumstances not to do so) they are prepared to explain afterwards – most probably in a post-incident inquiry – why not. Where there are suspicions that an attorney might not be acting in the best interests of the donor, the OPG will arrange an investigation. If the OPG decides that formal action is required, and more generally if any disputes arise on subjects covered by the MCA, the matter is referred to the Court of Protection (CoP), which is part of the Family Division of the High Court and was set up under the MCA for this purpose. The role of the CoP in decision-making is complementary to that of the OPG in relation to matters of regulation and supervision. =The 'five principles'= The guiding principles of the MCA 2005Mental Capacity Act 2005 section 1: The guiding principles are set out in five principles which indicate how the term 'capacity' (implying in this context mental capacity) is to be interpreted: > #A person must be assumed to have capacity unless it is established that he > lacks capacity. #A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision > unless all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without > success. #A person is not to be treated as unable to make a decision merely > because he makes an unwise decision. #An act done, or decision made, under > this Act for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity must be done, or > made, in his best interests. #Before the act is done, or the decision is > made, regard must be had to whether the purpose for which it is needed can > be as effectively achieved in a way that is less restrictive of the person’s > rights and freedom of action. The test so defined is 'decision-specific'. It can indicate an answer to the question 'Can he any longer use a gas ring safely when unsupervised?', but does not allow for wider questions to be given a firm yes/no answer when the real answer is that he has restricted capacity and so can deal with some aspects but not others. As stated in an official summary of the Act,Mental Capacity Act 2005: summary by the Department of Health it is 'a single clear test for assessing whether a person lacks capacity to take a particular decision at a particular time'. =The role of the OPG in relation to lasting powers of attorney= From the point of view of someone who needs (or may potentially need) one or both LPAs, the Office of the Public Guardian is one of the first points of contact. To apply for a Lasting Power of Attorney, the donor has to fill in the application forms giving details for themselves, the attorneys and another person known as the certificate provider to witness that the decision has been made with the donor's understanding and agreement. An LPA cannot be created once the donor has lost capacity. There are two ways to create a Lasting Power of Attorney. * The person wishing to apply for an LPA can use the online LPA tool.https://www.gov.uk/power-of-attorney/make-lasting- power :* This asks the user straightforward questions and then automatically produces a completed LPA form. This is then printed and signed in the correct order. The LPA tool also offers detailed instructions, describes the roles and responsibilities of each person involved, and offers assistance with signing and registration of the LPA. * The forms can also be downloaded, printed out and filled in by hand. :* They must then be signed in the correct order. No instructions are included with the forms, so it is recommended that you read the information available online before filling them in. The two key booklets available to give information on the LPA are entitled 'Guidance for people who want to make a lasting power of attorney for…', respectively, 'Property and Financial Affairs' and 'Health and Welfare'. These booklets provide all the information required about the legal aspects of the LPA application procedure, and many but not all of the practical aspects as well; they are the source for the great majority of the material which follows here. The booklets can be obtained in several ways: * on line in pdf formathttp://www.justice.gov.uk/forms/opg/lasting-power-of-attorney or * in printed form and free of charge, by request either :* on linehttp://www.justice.gov.uk/forms/opg/request-lasting-power-of-attorney- forms or :* by post from The Office of the Public Guardian Most users, particularly when completing an application form without previous experience of LPAs, will find the printed format an advantage. As well as obtaining copies of the forms in these ways, copies may be downloaded or requested of other booklets and the corresponding application forms, such as those relating to registration and the payment of fees. Full information is on the appropriate website; first-time users will find it most convenient either to download or request by post a full set, covering everything needed for each LPA. The OPG does not have its own website, but uses part of the main UK Government information site.Government website for OPG information or A fee is payable at the time of registration: it is currently £82, or £164 from April 2017 for both LPAs, but exemption or reduction is allowed in defined cases.Gov.uk: Make a lasting power of attorney An LPA is not only a legal document: it is a plan of action, to be put into effect in an ordinary family situation which may have its share of stresses and problems. Any such matters will affect the outcome, and so need to be taken into account in the drafting of the application. The primary source of help and advice for this process is the appropriate OPG booklet. =Using the lasting power of attorney= Once the donor has created a lasting power of attorney and it has been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian, the attorneys specified can in theory act on behalf of the donor, for example, paying the donor's bills, managing investments, and so on. However, in practice, this can prove much harder than it may sound. The powers granted by the property and financial affairs LPA require the relevant institution (for example, the bank or insurance company) to accept the power of attorney and allow the attorney to act. Many institutions, whilst in theory accepting the power, make it extremely difficult to put in practice. Many claim that this is to protect the donor or to comply with money laundering regulations, but whatever the reasons, it can make the whole process very challenging and stressful, especially if the donor themselves is by this time unable to support the process, for example, from failing mental capacity. Ways in which institutions can obstruct the process include: * requiring identity verification of the donor (which is not required in law and may in practice be very difficult if utility bills have already been redirected to the attorney's address and the donor is now mentally or physically frail) * by insisting on seeing the sole original copy of the power of attorney, rather than accepting a certified copy * questioning the identity of the attorney and requiring substantial proofs via certified copies of documents such as passports, even where the address of the attorney remains as stated on the LPA Even once the authority of the attorney is accepted by the institution, they may choose to limit what the donor can do, for example by: * not supporting a full range of services, such as internet banking and telephone banking, or refusing to issue cheque books or debit cards to attorneys * continuing to send correspondence to the donor's address instead of the attorney's * refusing to accept the attorney's instructions without the confirmation of the donor The only recourse in these cases is to complain first to the institution in question, and if this fails to the Financial Ombudsman Service.

It was a 2nd Line Territorial Force formation raised as a duplicate of the 56th (1/1st London) Division. After training in Britain, the division joined the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) on the Western Front in 1917. It saw action at the battles of Arras and Passchedaele in 1917 and the German Spring Offensive in 1918. It then took part in the Battle of Amiens and the final Allied Hundred Days Offensive of the war. The division was recreated during World War II as an imaginary 'deception' formation. Origin The formation of reserve or 2nd Line TF units was authorised by the War Office on 31 August 1914. At first they comprised those members of the pre-war parent unit who had not volunteered for or were unfit for overseas service, who trained the flood of volunteers who came forward. Later, the 2nd Line formations were also prepared for overseas service and 3rd Line units were formed to provide replacements. In the case of the 2/1st London Division, this process began early, when the 2/1st London Brigade went to Malta in December 1914 to relieve its 1st Line counterpart that had been despatched there on the outbreak of war. It was replaced in the 2/1st London Division by its 3rd Line (the battalions were renumbered when the original 2nd Line battalions were disbanded in 1916). The artillery, engineers and two infantry battalions of the 1/1st London Division had not gone overseas, and these were attached to the 2/1st Division for the first year of its existence.Becke, pp. 9–15.Grey, pp. 86–97.Grimwade, pp. 115–6. Training In August 1915, the division concentrated around Ipswich in Eastern England and received the number 58, its brigades being numbered 173–5. Here it formed part of First Army in Central Force. In September 1915 the 1st Line artillery brigades went to France and were replaced by the division's own 2nd Line units. In the Spring of 1916 the division took over a sector of the East Coast defences. Then in July 1916 it went to Sutton Veny on Salisbury Plain for final training before deploying overseas. The artillery were now equipped with modern 18-pounder field guns and 4.5-inch howitzers while the infantry had been issued with the .303 Lee-Enfield service rifle in place of the .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which they had done their early training.Grimwade, pp. 117–22.Keeson, pp. 278-9. The division began embarking for France on 20 January 1917 and had concentrated by 8 February. It then served for the remainder of the war on the Western Front.Keeson, pp. 280–1.

Skilled tradesmen and 'pivotal' men began to be demobilised during December 1918, and by March 1919 the division had dwindled to a brigade group concentrated around Leuze as units were reduced to cadres. The artillery left for the UK on 4 April, and the last units left France at the end of June, when 58th Division ceased to exist. General Officers Commanding The following officers commanded the division: * Brig-Gen E.J. Cooper, appointed 4 May 1915 * Maj-Gen H.D. Fanshawe, appointed 5 September 1916 * Maj-Gen A.B.E. Cator, appointed 6 October 1916; sick 10 May 1918 * Brig-Gen C.G. Higgins, acting 10–21 May, 10–13 June 1918 * Maj-Gen N.M. Smyth, VC, appointed 21 May; sick 10 June 1918 * Maj-Gen F. W. Ramsay, appointed 13 June 1918 World War II The division was 'reformed' as a 'phantom division' created as part of 'Operation Fortitude North' as a replacement for the 3rd Infantry Division which was going south to take part in a D-Day rehearsal. Unlike other 'phantom divisions' the 58th's number was chosen on the basis of Ultra reports that showed the Germans believed a 58th Infantry Division existed in the vicinity of Windsor. This misidentification was then supported by simulated radio traffic and by fictitious reports from double agents working for the British Security Service, MI5.Hesketh.Martin, pp. 185-8.Levine. As part of the Fourth Army's II Corps, the division took the role of a mountain trained assault formation in 'Fortitude North' (HQ: Aberlour) and the role of follow up unit in 'Fortitude South' (HQ: Gravesend). It was disposed of by announcing that the division had moved to Hertfordshire and been disbanded in April 1945.,Holt.Levine, pp. 217, 223. The formation's insignia, a stag's face full on a black square was chosen to support the division's fictional back-story, that it had been formed in the Scottish Highlands around cadres from combat experienced Highland regiments. Imaginary formations assigned to the division included the 173rd Infantry Brigade, 174th Infantry Brigade, 175th Infantry Brigade, and support units.

Alexander Wilhelm Andreas Freiherr von Kaulbars (; 25 January 1925) was a Baltic German military leader who served in the Imperial Russian Army during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. A noted explorer of Central Asia, he was also regarded as one of the original organisers of the Russian Air Force. Biography Mõdriku Mansion in present-day Estonia, where Alexander von Kaulbars was born. Alexander von Kaulbars during the Boxer Rebellion. Kaulbars was born in Mödders in the Governorate of Estonia to Baron Hermann Wilhelm von Kaulbars and Alexandrine Emilie and had an older brother, Nikolai Reinhold Friedrich. Alexander and Nikolai grew up in St. Petersburg and was of Lutheran faith. He came from the Baltic German noble of Pomeranian origin. The family was of Swedish nobility. Both his father and his brother rose to the rank of general in the Imperial Russian Army. He was educated at the Nikolaev Cavalry School. His first experience in combat was in 1861, while serving with the Egersky Guards Regiment in the suppression of the Polish Uprising.Kowner, Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War, p. 180. After graduating from the Nicholas General Staff Academy, Kaulbars was commissioned as a lieutenant, and was assigned to serve on the staff of the Turkestan Military District. He was promoted to senior aide in 1870, to the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1871, and to colonel in 1872. Soon after his arrival in Russian Turkestan, he explored the country beyond the Issyk-Kul into the Tien Shan mountains. His report was published as \\"Materials on the Geography of the Tien Shan\\", and was awarded the gold medal by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society In 1870, he explored the Russian-Chinese border, surveying the summit of Khan Tengri and looking for mountain passes into Kashgar, which he visited in 1872 for negotiations on a commercial treaty with its ruler, Yaqub Beg. In 1873, Kaulbars participated in the Russian conquest of the Khanate of Khiva under General Konstantin Kaufman. During this expedition, he explored the delta and riverbed of the Amu Darya river, and located a navigable route to the Aral Sea. He also explored the dry riverbed of the Syr Darya, and the connections between both rivers, the Caspian Sea and Aral Sea, and the now dry Uzboy River. His research on these topics resulted in technical papers which were awarded a second gold medal by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society. In 1874, Kaulbars was made Chief of Staff of the 8th Cavalry Division, a position which he held until his return to the General Staff in 1875. He participated in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878), and was promoted to major general in 1879, and given command of the 1st Brigade of the 14th Cavalry Division. From 1878-1879, he was a member of the committee for the demarcation of the borders of the new Kingdom of Serbia. In 1882, Kaulbars became the Minister of War for the Principality of Bulgaria, then a client state of the Empire of Russia. This state, semi-autonomous since the Russian victory sanctioned by the Treaty of San Stefano, was fighting for independence from the Ottoman Empire. He also concurrently commanded the 1st Brigade of the 1st Cavalry Division. The following year, he became commander of the 15th Cavalry Division. Kaulbars was promoted to lieutenant general in 1891. In 1894, he was assigned command of the 2nd Cavalry Corps. This assignment was followed by command of the 2nd Siberian Army Corps in 1900, during which time he participated in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion and Russian occupation of Manchuria. He was further promoted to General of Cavalry in 1901 and made Assistant Commander of the Odessa Military District. In October 1904, during the Russo-Japanese War, he became commander of the Russian 3rd Manchurian Army. Following the Battle of Sandepu, he was transferred to command the Russian 2nd Manchurian Army in February 1905. However, during the Battle of Mukden, his forces were outfought and outflanked by the Imperial Japanese Army and disintegrated in disarray. Kaulbars was wounded in a fall off his horse during the retreat. After the end of the war, he returned to command the Odessa Military District until December 23, 1909. During this period, he was noted for his strong support of the monarchy during the 1905 Russian Revolution. In December 1909, he returned to St. Petersburg as a member of the Military Council. With the start of World War I, he was assigned as a commander of the Northwestern Front, and from October 1914 was placed in charge of all Russian military aviation activities. However, at the end of 1915, he was dismissed from military service. In 1916 he was appointed military governor of Odessa. After the October Revolution, he moved to South Russia, where he joined an anti-Bolshevik Volunteer Army on October 15, 1918, despite his advanced age (then 74). He entered the reserves in 1919. With the collapse of the Armed Forces of South Russia, he was evacuated to Constantinople, and subsequently lived in exile in Bulgaria and France. He worked as an employee of a telegraph company in Paris until his death in 1925. His grave is at the Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery.

His career was interrupted by Second World War service as a conscientious objector, during which he worked at the epileptic colony at Lingfield, developing art therapy for children.Design Journal, 1971 On the resumption of his career, Handley-Read's architectural passion was Modernism and in 1951 he completed his monograph on \\"The Art of Wyndham Lewis.\\" However, the subsequent, and very different, course of his life was set when, in 1952, he saw the Exhibition of Victorian and Edwardian Decorative Arts at the Victoria and Albert Museum.William Burges and the High Victorian Dream, page 7 Following the exhibition, and his marriage to the devotee of Victorian sculpture Lavinia Stainton, Handley-Read \\"pinned all his hopes and dreams on one central, all-consuming passion: the work of William Burges.\\" In the period between the First World War and the 1960s Victorian architecture reached its nadir of appreciation; \\"at best an unhappy interlude between Neo- Classicism and Modernism; at worst a period of grotesque bad taste, associated with religious cranks like Pugin and Socialist crackpots like Ruskin and William Morris.\\"William Burges and the High Victorian Dream, page 5 The desire for, and consequently the prices of, the Victorian decorative arts were therefore at an all-time low. Handley-Read and his wife, aided by a considerable inheritance, began to collect on an increasingly gargantuan scale.William Burges and the High Victorian Dream, page 8 But whilst his collection expanded, his ability to write about the works he bought did not: \\"A lifetime spent struggling to write produced just seventeen articles.\\"William Burges and the High Victorian Dream, page 9 Accepting his own inability to undertake Burges's biography, Handley-Read wrote to a friend, Joseph Mordaunt Crook; \\"Now look. You have just edited Eastlake's Gothic Revival...with complete success. You are well soaked in John Patrick Crichton- Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute. You know all about Smirke...why not do William Burges?...partnership is less than I am looking for. I want to hand the job over.\\"Charles Handley-Read letter to J. Mordaunt Crook, 13 August 1970, quoted in William Burges and the High Victorian Dream page 10 On 15 October 1971, Handley-Read committed suicide, followed by Lavinia on 9 December the same year.William Burges and the High Victorian Dream, page 13 In an article in Country Life in March 1972, Mark Girouard, the architectural historian and close friend to both, wrote of his visits to their London home to view their collection. Of Charles and Lavinia, Girouard recalled \\"two highly strung, vulnerable and complicated people who for 18 years had supported each other\\". Their collection of Victorian artefacts was broken up at sale. Many pieces were bought by major museums such as the Victoria & Albert Museum and Birmingham Museum & Art Gallery, as well as private collectors. The largest part of the collection to stay together was the 200 plus pieces purchased by The Higgins Art Gallery & Museum, Bedford, including William Burges's own bed and dressing table. Handley-Read's notes on William Burges were passed to Joseph Mordaunt Crook and became the basis of his seminal work on Burges, William Burges and the High Victorian Dream. The book received very positive reviews and was instrumental in establishing Burges's rehabilitation. A rare criticism is contained in a review written by Anthony Symondson in 1982. Symondson's critique relates not to Burges, but rather to Crook's portrait of Handley-Read; \\"those of us who knew (him) do not find him in Dr Crook's prelude, however cleverly written and closely researched\\".

Azorean Chamarrita The chamarrita from the Azores is a dance to a rhythm traditionally played on the fiddle with or without accompaniment. Though its origin is based in the Azores and Madeira, the Chamarrita is also prevalent in Brazil thanks to Azorean settlers who came to Brazil in the eighteenth century. However, it is often recognized as Chimarrita by Brazilians in Rio Grande de Sul. The vowel change is suspected to be an unintentional error by natives. The dance is also popular in Santa Catarina, Paraná, and São Paulo where it has gained new reformations influenced by the waltz. Instruments often include the guitar, harmonica and accordion. Dancers, usually in pairs, wear authentic gaucho clothes reflecting Azorean culture. The dance itself is a lively dance done in a circle. There is a caller who sings out directions to all the dancers. The pairs of dancers gather in opposite rows, approaching and moving away as the music progresses. The following is an example of a Chamaritta verse with the English translation. A moda da Chamarrita Nã tem nada que aprender, E andar comum pé no ar E outro no chão a bater. Quero cantar e bailar Com a moca mais bonita Bater o pé no terreiro Dar voltas a Chamarrita The old Chamarrita dance Does have little to learn more Than, lift a foot in the air, Stamp the other on the floor!

A member of the City Hall of Madalena said, “It’s with great pride that we celebrate the achievement of this record.

The Q-system for rock mass classification is developed by Barton, Lien, and Lunde. It expresses the quality of the rock mass in the so- called Q-value, on which are based design and support recommendations for underground excavations. The Q-value is determined with ::Q=frac{RQD}{J_n} times frac{J_r}{J_a} times frac{J_w}{SRF} The first term RQD (Rock Quality Designation) divided by Jn (joint set number) is related to the size of the intact rock blocks in the rock mass. The second term Jr (joint roughness number) divided by Ja (joint alteration number) is related to the shear strength along the discontinuity planes and the third term Jw (joint water parameter) divided by SRF (stress reduction factor) is related to the stress environment on the intact rock blocks and discontinuities around the underground excavation. A multiplication of the three terms results in the Q parameter, which can range between 0.001 for an exceptionally poor to 1000 for an exceptionally good rock mass. The numerical values of the class boundaries for the different rock mass qualities are subdivisions of the Q range on a logarithmic scale. The Q-value determines the quality of the rock mass, but the support of an underground excavation is based not only on the Q-value but is also determined by the different terms in the above equation.

Parchment craft has been predominantly used in the making of cards (religious devotional cards, greeting cards and gift cards) but the techniques are being applied to related items such as bookmarks and picture frames as well as 3-dimensional sculptural paper projects such as ornaments and boxes.Ospina, Martha. Pergamano: Parchment Craft Basic Techniques. Baarn, The Netherlands: La Rivière, 1997. .Wilson, Janet. The Art of Parchment Craft. Kent: Search Press, 1997. . History Historians believe that parchment craft originated as an art form in Europe during the 15th or 16th century. Parchment craft at that time occurred principally in Catholic communities, where crafts persons created lace-like items such as devotional pictures and communion cards. The craft developed over time, with new techniques and refinements being added. Until the 16th century, parchment craft was a European art form. However, missionaries and other settlers relocated to South America, taking parchment craft with them. As before, the craft appeared largely among the Catholic communities. Often, young girls receiving their First Communion received gifts of handmade parchment crafts. Although the invention of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the 18th century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations. In the 19th century, influenced by French romanticism, parchment crafters began adding floral themes and cherubs and hand embossing. Tools There are many tools involved in parchment craft; each has its specific purpose and use. =Mapping pen= Designs are traced onto parchment using a mapping pen and acrylic ink (usually white, but various colors are used to accent purposes). A mapping pen uses a nib which is dipped in ink. =White pencil= Designs can also be traced onto the parchment using a white pencil. This technique is usually used for very fine lines that will be directly traced over during the embossing process. The white pencil is used in this case because if one was to trace directly over an inked line, it would become black. =Embossing tools= Embossing tools come in many sizes. The larger the tool the softer the embossing and the \\"greyer\\" the color of the embossed shape; the smaller the tool the \\"whiter\\" and more \\"satiny\\" the color of the embossed shape. The tips of these tools also are made with different materials, some plastic – for lighter embossing – and some steel – for the brighter whites. The tools range from \\"large ball\\" to \\"extra fine ball\\" and a \\"stylus\\" (for very fine lines and intricate details). =Needle tools= Needle tools are sometimes used for embossing details, but mostly are used for perforating to make decorative, lace-like patterns. Needle tools have either single or multiple points and are used for different purposes. A single needle tool is used for embossing or stippling. A 2 needle tool is used for even perforations for marking areas which are to be cut with scissors. A 4 needle tool is square-shaped and a necessity for classic lace patterns. 3,5,7 and half-circle needle tools are used for decorative additions to lace patterns. A scissors is used in combination with needle tools to cut crosses and slots into the patterning. = Embossing and perforating pads= These pads are to be used as support whenever pressure is placed upon the parchment. For embossing a soft pad is required to provide even support. For perforating a felt pad is used. =Coloring tools= To color parchment craft work many media can be used such as: * Inks-any waterproof or acrylic ink * Acrylic paints * Oil pastels * Watercolor pencils * Felt-tip pens or markers * Blendable pencils are probably the most commonly used form of colouring. Techniques =Tracing= This is the first step in any parchment craft project. Tracing creates the guidelines for the areas of the design that are to be embossed. Tracing is done using the mapping pen and ink. Parchment has two sides-one with a smooth surface and one with a rough surface; tracing is done on the side with the rough surface because the ink more easily adheres to this type of surface. When tracing the mapping pen should be allowed to glide easily over the parchment, no pressure should be used as this increases the amount of ink that is dispersed from the nib and may also create an unintentional embossment. =Embossing= Embossing is the process of creating raised relief within one's design. Embossing is used to create both concave and convex shapes by alternating the side on which the embossing is performed. Using the embossing tools and appropriate embossing pad, the parchment is rubbed backwards and forwards or side to side in parallel movements with increasing downward pressure so that the parchment can be evenly stretched. A finished embossment will be satin-white in color and will contrast with the translucency of the parchment paper. Color can be varied by moderating the level to which the shape is embossed. Fine lines and hatching can be obtained by embossing with the stylus tool. =Stippling= The single needle tool is used for stippling. Stippling is a technique used for generating a matte white surface to areas or for fine detail work such as the centers of flowers. To create a matte white surface the parchment is first lightly embossed and then small holes are perforated on the parchment in very close proximity. The perforation is done using a cardboard pad rather than a felt pad so that the needle will not pierce through the parchment, but rather create an embossed dot. =Perforating= Perforating is used to create decorative and special lace patterns in parchment craft. Minimal tracing is required when perforating; designs are usually created by taping the parchment over a pattern and perforating directly over it. Various needle tools are used in the perforating technique. Perforating is also used to create edging and borders or to denote guidelines for cutting. =Cutting= Cutting is used in combination with perforating. Cutting is used with the 2 needle tool to remove shapes from the design; it is used with the 4 needle tool to create crosses and strips within a lace pattern. =Coloring= Coloring is a technique that gained popularity in parchment craft in the 20th century; before this, parchment craft was originally only white work. There are many methods for coloring parchment craft work. One of the most popular is \\"dorsing\\". Dorsing creates a soft background color for embossed shapes or the areas around them. Color is applied in the dorsing process using oil pastels or Dorso crayons which are rubbed on and then blended using paper toweling and odorless mineral spirits or an oil based medium such as linseed or lavender oil. For coloring that is applied to the parchment in entirety, the coloring is done before any tracing or embossing. If color is to be added to small areas, dorsing would be applied in a similar manner to specific areas before the embossing process. Dorsing can also be done using other coloring media such as felt-tip pens/markers, watercolor pencils, acrylic paints or inks.

He worked as a compositor until 1852, when he became a clerk at the Hanover Bank of New York. He worked his way up the ranks at the Hanover Bank of New York until he had become the bank's general bookkeeper.\\"Conrad N. Jordan\\", New York Times, Oct. 17, 1897 He later moved to Fishkill, New York, to work in a leadership position in a bank there. Early in his career, Jordan became acquainted with Samuel J. Tilden and would have a longstanding business relationship and friendship with Tilden. When the National Western Bank of New York was created in 1864, Jordan became its cashier. Jordan became known as an expert in the field of public accounting and currency exchange. In the wake of Black Friday (1869), Jordan was auditor to the receiver of the Gold Exchange Bank. In 1880, partially because of his connection with Tilden, Jordan became Treasurer of the New York, Ontario and Western Railway. During this period, he unsuccessfully lobbied the New York State Legislature to create an entity to be known as the United States Exchange and Transfer Company to function as a nationwide clearing house. A Democrat, Jordan supported Grover Cleveland in the 1884 presidential election and worked with the campaign team drawing up plans to reform the United States Department of the Treasury. Following the appointment of Daniel Manning as United States Secretary of the Treasury, Cleveland nominated Jordan to be Treasurer of the United States to implement the plans he had drawn up. He served as Treasurer of the United States from May 1, 1885 to March 23, 1887. In 1887, Jordan became President of the Western National Bank of New York. There, he led the bank's involvement with the Pell-Simmons syndicate in its attempts to capture the Sixth National Bank. President Cleveland named Jordan Assistant Treasurer of the United States in April 1893. Following the election of William McKinley in the 1896 presidential election, a number of leading bankers, including McKinley's new Treasury Secretary, Lyman J. Gage, urged McKinley to retain Jordan as Assistant Treasurer of the United States. He was consequently re-appointed in April 1897.

This bias reflects an emotional bias toward women as a general case. The phrase was coined by Alice Eagly and Antonio Mladinic in 1994 after finding that both male and female participants tend to assign positive traits to women, with female participants showing a far more pronounced bias. Positive traits were assigned to men by participants of both genders, but to a lesser degree. The authors supposed that the positive general evaluation of women might derive from the association between women and nurturing characteristics. This bias is suggested as a form of misandry/'benevolent misogyny', the latter being a concept within the theoretical framework of ambivalent sexism.  Background  The term was coined by researchers Alice Eagly and Antonio Mladinic in a 1994 paper, where they had questioned the widely-held view that there was prejudice against women. They observed that much of the research had been inconclusive in showing a bias. They had found a positive bias towards women in their 1989 and 1991 studies, which involved questionnaires given to students in the United States. In 1989, 203 psychology students of Purdue University were given questionnaires in groups of 20 and asked to assess subjects of both genders, which showed a more favourable attitude to women and female stereotypes. In 1991, 324 psychology students of Purdue University were given questionnaires in groups of 20 and asked to assess subjects of both genders. They evaluated the social categories of men and women, relating the traits and expectations of each gender through interviews, emotion-associations and free-response measures. Women were rated higher in attitudes and beliefs but not emotions.  In-group bias  conducted research on gender bias that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at Purdue and Rutgers participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men. This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger than those of men. And only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender. Other experiments in this study found people showed automatic preference for their mothers over their fathers, or associated the male gender with violence or aggression. Rudman and Goodwin's suggested that maternal bonding and male intimidation influences gender attitudes. Another experiment in the study found adults' attitudes were measured based on their reactions to categories associated with sexual relations. It revealed that among men who engaged more in sexual activity, the more positive their attitude towards sex, the larger their bias towards women. A greater interest in and liking of sex may promote automatic preference for the out-group of women among men, although both women and men with sexual experience expressed greater liking for the opposite gender. One study found that the effect is mediated by increased gender equality. The mediation comes not from differences in attitudes towards women. But in attitudes towards men. In more egalitarian societies, people have more positive attitudes towards men than in less egalitarian societies.Krys, Kuba. et al. \\"Catching up with wonderful women: The women‐are‐wonderful effect is smaller in more gender egalitarian societies.\\" International Journal of Psychology. Volume 53, Issue S1 October 2018 Pages 21-26 https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12420  Criticism Some authors have claimed the \\"Women are wonderful\\" effect is applicable when women follow traditional gender roles such as child nurturing and stay-at-home housewife. However, other authors have cited studies indicating that the women-are-wonderful effect is still applicable even when women are in nontraditional gender roles, and the original study discovering the women-are-wonderful effect found no such ambivalence Several scholars have argued that the \\"women are wonderful\\" effect might be better phrased as \\"women are wonderful when\\" effect, with the \\"when\\" meaning when women are not in charge.

More than 10 days earlier, anti-Gaddafi forces beat back an attempt by loyalist forces to take the town on 2 March 2011, in the First Battle of Brega. Following that battle, rebel forces advanced along the Libyan Coastal Highway, taking the towns of Ra's Lanuf and Bin Jawad. However, after the Battle of Bin Jawad and the Battle of Ra's Lanuf, government troops retook all of the territory lost and were once again threatening Brega by mid-March. The battle On 13 March, regime's forces, advancing from Ra's Lanuf, succeeded in retaking Brega, though that night reports indicated that fighting was still ongoing and rebels possibly still controlled portions of the town. Reportedly, the rebels re-entered the town and heavy fighting ensued, after which government troops retreated to Brega's airport. However, just an hour later, it was stated that loyalist forces had pushed back rebel troops from the town to aj-Ojela, 20 kilometers east of Brega. By the morning of 14 March, rebel forces were holding the residential district and loyalist forces were holding the oil facilities. On 15 March, rebel forces had abandoned Brega and were in full retreat towards Ajdabiya. Ajdabiya itself came under ground attack just a few hours later, marking the beginning of the Battle of Ajdabiya. Aftermath On 26 March, after loyalists lost Ajdabiya and retreated further down the coast, rebel forces recaptured Brega. A few days later, loyalist troops returned again, recapturing the city after a prolonged battle with rebel forces.

MDA framework From 2001 to 2004,http://www.zubek.net/robert//publications/MDA.pdf Hunicke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubeck created the Mechanics-Dynamics-Aesthetics framework to focus and improve game analysis. The framework categorizes the many aspects of a game as Mechanics, Dynamics, or Aesthetics, and outlines the inverse perspectives of designer and player. From the perspective of the designer, the Mechanics generate Dynamics which generate Aesthetics. From the perspective of the player, the player experiences the game through the Aesthetics, which are provided by Dynamics that emerge from the game mechanics.

Herbal medicine, as used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), came to widespread attention in the United States in the 1970s. At least 40 states in the United States license practitioners of Oriental medicine, and there are about 50 colleges of Oriental medicine in the United States today. In Japan, the use of TCM herbs and herbal formulas is traditionally known as Kampo, literally \\"Han Chinese Medical Formulas\\". Many Kampo combinations are manufactured in Japan on a large scale by reputable manufacturers. In Korea, more than 5000 herbs and 7000 herbal formulas are used in Traditional Korean Medicine for the prevention and treatment of ailments. These are herbs and formulas that are traditionally Korean or derived from, or are used in TCM. In Vietnam, traditional medicine comprises Thuoc Bac (Northern Medicine) and Thuoc Nam (Southern Medicine). Only those who can understand Chinese characters could diagnose and prescribe remedies in Northern Medicine. The theory of Northern Medicine is based on the Yin-Yang interactions and the eight trigrams, as used in Chinese Medicine. Herbs such as Gleditsia sinensis are used in both Traditional Vietnamese Medicine and TCM. Ginseng is the most broadly used substance for the most broad set of alleged cures. Powdered antlers, horns, teeth, and bones are second in importance to ginseng, with claims ranging from curing cancer to curing impotence.  Mammals  = Human parts and excreta = Human body parts and excreta have been used in TCM since ancient times. More common ones include licorice in human feces, dried human placenta, finger nails, child's urine, hair, and urinary sediments (Hominis Urinae Sedimentum, Ren Zhong Bai).Regenerative Medicine Using Pregnancy-Specific Biological Substances, Niranjan Bhattacharya, Phillip Stubblefield, ed, p.vi Uncommon parts include pubic hair, flesh, blood, bone, semen, and menstrual blood.The Bencao Gangmu describes the use of 35 human waste products and body parts as medicines, such as bones, fingernail, hairs, dandruff, earwax, impurities on the teeth, feces, urine, sweat, and organs. - Also listed are human breath and the \\"soul of criminals that were hanged\\", which is considered under TCM to be a material object resembling charcoal that is dug out of the ground beneath the body shortly after a hanged criminal died. Very few human or allegedly human products remain in TCM today. There is considerable controversy about the ethics of use of criminals for body parts, using humans as commodities, and consumption of human body parts which some consider to be cannibalism.  Dried human placenta  Dried human placenta is believed to treat male impotence, male and female infertility, chronic cough, asthma, and insomnia.Chinese Herbal Medicine: Formulas & Strategies, Volker Scheid, Dan Bensky, Andrew Ellis, Randall BaroletChinese Herbal Medicine: Materia Medica, Dan Bensky, Steven Clavey, Erich Stoger, Andrew Gamble, Lilian Lai BenskyAn Illustrated Chinese Materia Medica, Jing-Nuan WuA Materia Medica for Chinese Medicine: plants, minerals and animal products, Carl-Herman HempenZiheche, TCM TreatmentThe Traditional Chinese Medicine Materia Medica Clinical Reference, Peter Holmes (Author), Jing Wang (Author), Heather McIver  Human feces and urine  The contemporary use of licorice in prepared human feces is known as Ren Zhong Huang.

A. KuninFats that Heal: Fats that Kill, Udo Erasmus, 1993, Snake oil is a traditional Chinese medicine used to treat joint pain by rubbing it on joints as a liniment. This is theoretically possible because snake oil is higher in eicosapentaenoic acid than most other oils. But there are no scientific studies showing that rubbing it on joints has any positive effect, or that snake oil is safe for daily consumption. = Toad secretions = The secretions of various species of toads are an ingredient in certain traditional Chinese teas.

Some may have scientifically proven medicinal value, while others may be extremely toxic. = Supernatural mushroom = The supernatural mushroom (lingzhi mushroom, Chinese \\"linh chi\\" = \\"supernatural mushroom\\", \\"reishi mushroom\\" in Japan) encompasses several fungal species of the genus Ganoderma, and most commonly refers to the closely related species, Ganoderma lucidum and Ganoderma tsugae. G. lucidum enjoys special veneration in East Asia, where it has been used as a medicinal mushroom in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 2,000 years,Jones, Kenneth (1990), Reishi: Ancient Herb for Modern Times, Sylvan Press, p. 6. making it one of the oldest mushrooms known to have been used medicinally. Today, the ling zhi mushroom is used in a herbal formula designed to minimize the side effects of chemotherapy.http://maciociaonline.blogspot.sg/2012_05_01_archive.html Extracts of the mushroom are used as a commercial pharmaceutical to suppress cancer cell proliferation and migration, although the mechanisms by which this is achieved are currently unknown. =Tremella fuciformis = Tremella fuciformis is used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan as it reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines. Other beneficial effects come from its ability to increase the activity of SOD in the brain and liver.  Plants  There are thousands of plants that are used as medicines.Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology, by John K. Chen, Tina T. Chen The following list represents a very small portion of the TCM pharmacopoeia. =Monkshood root= Monkshood root is commonly used in TCM. It was once so commonly used it was called \\"the king of the 100 herbs\\".Yang Tianhui: Notes from My Visit to the Fuzi Growing Area of Zhangming County (Song Dynasty, 1099 CE), , Heiner Fruehauf, \\"The Importance of Aconite (fuzi)\\" The monkshood plant contains what is called \\"the queen of poisons\\", the highly toxic alkaloid aconitine. Aconitine is easily absorbed through the skin, eyes and through the lining of the nose; Death may occur through respiratory paralysis. A few minutes after exposure, paresthesia starts at the mouth and slowly beings to cover the whole body, Anesthesia, hot and cold flashes, nausea and vomiting and other similar symptoms follow. Sometimes there is strong pain, accompanied by cramps, or diarrhea. (1994): Giftpflanzen - Pflanzengifte. . When a person has a negative reaction to the alkaloid, some practitioners of classical Chinese medicine think that this is because it was that the monkshood plant was processed incorrectly or planted on the wrong place or on the wrong day of the year; not because of an overdose.Pao Zhi: An Introduction to the Use of Processed Chinese Medicinals, Philippe Sionneau The Chinese also used aconitine both for huntingSung, Ying-hsing.

Active ingredients of this herb include: methionine, glycine, β-aminobutyric acid, γ-aminobutyric acid, ephedrine, trigonelline, phytosterols and glucoronic acid. Care should be taken as crow dipper is toxic. = Croton seed = Seeds of Croton tiglium are used in TCM to treat gastrointestinal disorders, convulsions, and skin lesions. They are often used with rhubarb, dried ginger and apricot seed.Croton Seed, Acupuncture Today Care should be taken as the seeds are toxic and carcinogenic. = Dioscorea root = In TCM, Dioscorea Root (Radix Dioscorea, Huai Shan Yao or Shan Yao in Chinese), benefits both the Yin and Yang, and is used to tonify the lungs, spleen and kidney. It can \\"be used in large amounts and 30g is suggested when treating diabetes\\". If taken habitually, it \\"brightens the intellect and prolongs life\\". = Ginger = Ginger root, Zingiber officinale, has been used in China for over 2,000 years to treat indigestion, upset stomach, diarrhea, and nausea. It is also used in TCM to treat arthritis, colic, diarrhea, heart conditions, the common cold, flu-like symptoms, headaches, and menstrual cramps. Today, health care professionals worldwide commonly recommend ginger to help prevent or treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, pregnancy, and cancer chemotherapy. It is also used as a treatment for minor stomach upset, as a supplement for arthritis, and may even help prevent heart disease and cancer.Ginger, University of Maryland Medical Center = Ginkgo = Ginkgo biloba seeds are crushed and believed under TCM to treat asthma.Ginkgo, TCM Basics G. biloba has been used by humans for nearly 5,000 years. However, further scientific studies are needed to establish the efficacy of G. biloba as a medicine. = Ginseng = Ginseng root is the most widely sold traditional Chinese medicine. The name \\"ginseng\\" is used to refer to both American (Panax quinquefolius) and Asian or Korean ginseng (P. ginseng), which belong to the species Panax and have a similar chemical makeup. Siberian ginseng or Eleuthero (Eleutherococcus senticosus) is another type of plant. Asian ginseng has a light tan, gnarled root that often looks like a human body with stringy shoots for arms and legs. In ancient times, herbalists thought that because of the way ginseng looks it could treat many different kinds of syndromes, from fatigue and stress to asthma and cancer. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng was often combined with other herbs and used often to bring longevity, strength, and mental alacrity to its users. Asian ginseng is believed to enhance the immune system in preventing and treating infection and disease. Several clinical studies report that Asian ginseng can improve immune function. Studies have found that ginseng seems to increase the number of immune cells in the blood, and improve the immune system's response to a flu vaccine. In one study, 227 participants received either ginseng or placebo for 12 weeks, with a flu shot administered after 4 weeks. The number of colds and flu were two-thirds lower in the group that took ginseng. Ginseng contains stimulants, but may produce side effect including high blood pressure, low blood pressure, and mastalgia. Ginseng may also lead to induction of mania in depressed patients who mix it with antidepressants. One of the most common and characteristic symptoms of acute overdose of ginseng from the genus Panax is bleeding. Symptoms of mild overdose with Panax ginseng may include dry mouth and lips, excitation, fidgeting, irritability, tremor, palpitations, blurred vision, headache, insomnia, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, edema, decreased appetite, increased sexual desire, dizziness, itching, eczema, early morning diarrhea, bleeding, and fatigue. Symptoms of gross overdose with Panax ginseng may include nausea, vomiting, irritability, restlessness, urinary and bowel incontinence, fever, increased blood pressure, increased respiration, decreased sensitivity and reaction to light, decreased heart rate, cyanotic facial complexion, red face, seizures, convulsions, and delirium. The constituents of ginseng include triterpene saponins, aglycone protopanaxadiol, aglycone protopanaxytriol, aglycone oleanolic acid and water- soluble polysaccharides. = Goji berry = Marketing literature for goji berry (wolfberry) products including several \\"goji juices\\" suggest that wolfberry polysaccharides have extensive biological effects and health benefits, although none of these claims have been supported by peer-reviewed research. A May 2008 clinical study published by the peer-reviewed Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine indicated that parametric data, including body weight, did not show significant differences between subjects receiving Lycium barbarum berry juice and subjects receiving the placebo; the study concluded that subjective measures of health were improved and suggested further research in humans was necessary. This study, however, was subject to a variety of criticisms concerning its experimental design and interpretations. Published studies have also reported possible medicinal benefits of Lycium barbarum, especially due to its antioxidant properties, including potential benefits against cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases, vision-related diseases (such as age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma), having neuroprotective properties or as an anticancer and immunomodulatory agent. Wolfberry leaves may be used to make tea, together with Lycium root bark (called dìgǔpí; 地 骨 皮 in Chinese), for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). A glucopyranoside isolated from wolfberry root bark have inhibitory activity in vitro against human pathogenic bacteria and fungi. = Horny goat weed = Horny goat weed (Yin Yang Huo, 淫羊藿) may have use in treating erectile dysfunction.Horny Goat Weed, Altmedicine.com Exploitation of wild populations may have a serious impact on the surrounding environment.Epimedium, ChemEurope.com = Lily bulb = Lily bulbs (Bai He) are used in TCM to treat dry cough, dry and sore throat, and wheezing. = Chinese Rhubarb = The root of the \\"Chinese rhubarb\\", or \\"da huang\\" (大黄), either Rheum palmatum, or Rheum officinale, is an important herb that is used primarily as a laxative in TCM. The degree of potency depends on how long the root is cooked during preparation after harvesting. = Round cardamon fruit = Round cardamon fruit (Bai Dou Kou) is used in TCM to treat poor appetite, breathing problems, vomiting and diarreahea = Thunder god vine = Thunder god vine is used in TCM to treat arthritis, relieve pain and reduce joint swelling.Lei Gong Teng (Radix Tripterygii Wilfordii): A Blessing or a Time Bomb?, John Chen, PhD, PharmD, OMD, Lac, It can be extremely toxic, if not processed properly. If used inappropriately, within two to three hours after ingestion, a patient may begin to have diarrhea, headache, dizziness, severe vomiting (sometimes with blood), chills, high fever, and irregular heart beat. Long term inproper use may result in nervous system damage. = Trichosanthis root = In TCM, Trichosanthis Root (Radix Trichosanthis or Tian Hua Fen in Chinese), is used to clear heat, generate fluids when heat injures fluids causing thirst, in the wasting and thirsting syndrome. The pairing of Tian Hua Fen and Zhi Mu had a faster, stronger and longer effect in reducing blood sugar levels than either herb alone. = Strychnine = The seeds of the Strychnine tree, Strychnos nux-vomica, are sometimes used to treat diseases of the respiratory tract, anemia, and geriatric complaints. The active molecule is strychnine, a compound often used as a pesticide. Ma Qian Zi, Chinese Medical Tools, Acupuncture.com Strychnine can also be used as a stimulant - however it has an extremely low therapeutic index and better, less toxic replacements are available.Materia Medica, Dan Besky, p.1050 = Sweet wormwood = Sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua, Qing Hao) is believed under TCM to treat fever, headache, dizziness, stopping bleeding, and alternating fever and chills. Sweet wormwood had fallen out of common use under TCM until it was rediscovered in the 1970s when the Chinese Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments (340 AD) was found. This pharmacopeia contained recipes for a tea from dried leaves, prescribed for fevers (not specifically malaria). The plant extracts often used in TCM are antimalarial, due to the presence of artemisinin. However, it has been questioned as to whether tea made from A. annua is effective against malaria, since artemesinin is not soluble in water and the resulting tea would not be expected to contain any significant amount of artemesinin. = Willow bark = Plants of the genus Salix have been used since the time of Hippocrates (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe to the present for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and osteoarthritis), headache, and inflammatory conditions such as bursitis and tendinitis. The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In 1829, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but the analgesia may last longer.  Metals  = Arsenic = Arsenic sulfide (Xiong Huang) is a toxic mineral used in TCM to kill parasitic worms and treat sore throats, swellings, abscesses, itching, rashes, and malaria. Realgar, Acupuncture Today Arsenic, while possibly essential for life in tiny amounts, is extremely toxic in the amounts used and arsenic poisoning may result from use of arsenic containing remedies. They are most commonly given as a pill or capsule, although are sometimes incorporated into a mixture with other substances. = Lead = Galena is used in TCM to treat ringworm, skin disorders and ulcers, and is thought to \\"detoxify\\" the body.Galena, Acupuncture Today It is crushed and taken orally or used on the skin. Lead tetroxide (Qian Dan) is used to treat anxiety, itching, and malaria.Qian Dan (Minium) , TCM Assistant.Qian Dan, American Dragon.Qian Dan : lead elixir : minium, lead oxide, rootdown.us. It is important to note that most lead compounds are extremely toxic. = Mercury =  Cinnabar  Despite its toxicity, mercury sulfide (cinnabar) has historically been used in Chinese medicine, where it is called zhūshā (朱砂), and was highly valued in Chinese Alchemy. It was also referred to as dān (丹), meaning all of Chinese alchemy, cinnabar, and the \\"elixir of immortality\\". Cinnabar has been used in Traditional Chinese medicine as a sedative for more than 2000 years, and has been shown to have sedative and toxic effects in mice. In addition to being used for insomnia, cinnabar is thought to be effective for cold sores, sore throat, and some skin infections.Cinnabar, Acupuncture Today.

It is Montana's oldest Baptist Church, located on 8th Avenue. It is associated with the American Baptist Churches USA. The First Baptist Church in Montana had its beginnings on November 7, 1879, when 21 Helena Baptists petitioned the Baptist Home Mission Society of New York City to send a missionary to organize a church. Reverend J.T. Mason arrived for that purpose; and on December 5, 1880, he moderated an organizational meeting of Baptists in the wooden Lewis and Clark Courthouse. Services were first held in a hall on Broadway Avenue and later in the South Methodist Church in the 100 block of North Warren. In 1882 the current building site was purchased for $1,000 and the cornerstone was laid September 19, 1883. The Montana Baptist Association (Montana Baptist Convention) was organized in the uncompleted church building in 1883. In 1884, the $11,000 building was dedicated. Soon afterwards, a $2,500 parsonage was built at the back of the church. Reverend J.T. Mason preached the first sermon in the new church on April 6, 1884. Among the early members was Territorial governor Preston Leslie whose daughter, Emily, served as church organist. The fine Barckhoff tracker organ, still in use today, was given in her memory in 1901 which was hand pumped until 1906. A spiral stairway from the northwest front vestibule to the parlors over the lecture room (now the balcony) is an original feature of the building. The platform under the pulpit opened to reveal the baptistry which was first used on June 25, 1884. The chandelier in the center of the sanctuary had gas light tapers until 1889, when the trustees were empowered to replace coal oil lamps with electricity. In 1936 the clear glass windows were replaced with amber glass. The original pews had perforated backs with comfortable cushions; and extensions at each end, when drawn to full length, allowed the whole area of the floor to be used. In 1916 a fire damaged the entire auditorium, including considerable damage to the organ. The congregation met in the Christian Church until October. The second parsonage at 515 North Rodney was sold and the money used to repair the organ. In 1935 the red brick veneer finish was damaged in a series of earthquakes so it was covered with stucco, the interior redecorated and the parsonage was reconstructed into an education unit with a kitchen and fellowship room. A stained glass window is dedicated to Governor Sam C. Ford (1941-1949) whose wife, Mary, was a lifetime member of the congregation. In 1956 the spire was rebuilt to look as it does today. In 1965 a number of renovations were made, including an addition of 11,000 square feet for new classrooms, kitchen, offices, a new 8th St. entrance, and the fellowship hall seating 250 persons. The old parsonage wing then became the Ann Judson Room, baptismal dressing rooms, and classrooms. In addition all the rectangular stained glass windows were installed, thus changing the 8th St. side of the building. In 1977 the third baptistry was installed replacing the badly deteriorated baptistry and its \\"floating steps\\" with a larger fiberglass unit. The wall above it was tiled at this time and a larger opening was created. In 1979 the Barckhoff tracker organ was completely dismantled and cleaned, and the organ chamber was replastered and painted for the first time since the fire of 1916. In 1980, the sanctuary underwent its fourth renovation.

The Board did regulate abortion clinics from 1981 until 1984, when Governor Chuck Robb ordered an end to the regulation of outpatient clinics. From 1991 to 2010, bills introduced into the Virginia General Assembly proposed to regulate outpatient abortion clinics, but they failed to be enacted. In 2010, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli issued a non-binding legal opinion that would allow the Board to regulate outpatient abortion clinics as if they were hospital facilities called \\"ambulatory surgical centers.\\" At that time, 11 of the Board members were appointed by the prior Governor Tim Kaine, and the Board did not act on Cuccinelli's opinion letter. The 2011 session of the General Assembly expanded the Board's power to regulate clinics which provide five or more first-trimester abortions per month and required the Board to issue regulations within 280 days. By this time, Governor Bob McDonnell had appointed six of the Board members, with the ability to fill two more seats in July 2011. Among McDonnell's appointees as consumer representative is a donor and supporter of the Family Foundation, a group which opposes abortions.

It is located just east of the Lake Šešuoliai. According to the Lithuanian census of 2011, it had 138 residents. The town's central square and street layout is protected as an urban monument. Its alternate names include Šašuoliai, Šešuolių, Shesholi, Sheshuolyay, Sušuoliai, Szeszole, and Szeszole.United States Board on Geographic Names – Lithuania – Šešuoliai. Accessed January 27, 2014. History The town was first mentioned in the Chronicle of Hermann von Wartberge when it was attacked by the Livonian Order in 1334. Since the times of Grand Duke Vytautas, there was an estate, which became a property of Kristinas Astikas. Sometime before 1478, Šešuoliai passed to the Bishop of Vilnius. Bishop Walerian Protasewicz sponsored construction of a Catholic church and establishment of a parish. Protasewicz also directed the priests to open a parish school, but it is known only from 1777. The settlement grew into a town and center of a volost. The town burned down in 1656 during the Russo- Polish War. Šešuoliai recovered; the church was reconstructed in 1698 and 1751. The priests sponsored a parish school and a shelter for the poor. Šešuoliai Manor had a library and alcohol distillery. During the interwar years it was briefly owned by Jonas Variakojis. Today it is a school building. The town had 100 residents in 1814, 64 in 1845, 169 in 1890, 317 in 1923, 156 in 1959, 193 in 1970, 123 in 1979. In the summer of 1941, a number of Jews from the town were marched to -they were told Želva.

Only 1,000 were made between 1991 and 2000. The 4001CS is another instrument from Rickenbacker’s Limited Edition Series. These instruments, commissioned by and for prominent artists who favored Rickenbacker instruments, incorporate features which are favored by the artist or reminiscent of their most famous Rickenbacker instrument. Squire’s original bass was part of the model lineup exported to England in 1964, in the rush of the Beatles’ rise to prominence. The group’s association with Rickenbackers had English musicians clamoring for the instruments. An agreement was forged with the Rose-Morris music chain in England to sell Rickenbackers, and special model features and designations were given to the instruments. In the case of the 4001 bass, the English model 1999 eschewed the stereo output, triangular neck inlays, and checkered body binding and neck binding of the American model. The 4001CS incorporates some features associated with Squire, such as the cream finish, which is not original to his bass; Chris' was produced with a Fireglo (Rickenbacker's \\"sunburst\\") finish upon which he overlaid wallpaper as decorations twice before opting to go with the cream finish), Rickenbacker not making basses in this color in the ‘60s. Additionally, the African Vermillion fretboard and headstock wings are a feature unique to the 4001CS. Each 4001CS bass was supplied with a silver Rickenbacker vintage-style case, and a certificate of authenticity detailing the bass’ origin, serial number, and Limited Edition sequence number. The 4001CS is difficult to counterfeit due to its African Vermillion appointments but the presence of the certificate has bearing on the value of the instrument. The special cream finish on early serial number 4001CS basses is somewhat brittle, and the finish often chips at the edges where the tailpiece screws to the body.  History  In 1965, while 17 and working in a music store, Chris Squire bought his famous RM1999 bass that he used in Syn, Yes, and XYZ. The RM1999 was one of four 4001S imported to the UK. In 1990, during an interview on Star Licks, Squire announced that Rickenbacker would release a copied version of his bass that closely replicated the tone of his own instrument. However, in an interview for Premier Guitar Magazine in 2014, he would admit that they didn't quite sound like his. Despite his dissatisfaction with the model, he had kept a few of them as backup instruments, including one bass with a custom finish based on the cover of his solo album Fish Out of Water.

The war was the last of several wars between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that ended the Mon people's centuries-long dominance of the south.Lieberman 2003: 202–206 The war began in April 1752 as independent resistance movements against Hanthawaddy armies which had just toppled the Toungoo Dynasty. Alaungpaya, who founded the Konbaung Dynasty, quickly emerged as the main resistance leader, and by taking advantage of Hanthawaddy's low troop levels, went on to conquer all of Upper Burma by the end of 1753. Hanthawaddy belatedly launched a full invasion in 1754 but it faltered. The war increasingly turned ethnic in character between the Burman (Bamar) north and the Mon south. Konbaung forces invaded Lower Burma in January 1755, capturing the Irrawaddy Delta and Dagon (Yangon) by May. The French defended port city of Syriam (Thanlyin) held out for another 14 months but eventually fell in July 1756, ending French involvement in the war. The fall of the 16-year-old southern kingdom soon followed in May 1757 when its capital Pegu (Bago) was sacked. Disorganized Mon resistance fell back to the Tenasserim peninsula (present-day Mon State and Tanintharyi Region) in the next few years with Siamese help but was driven out by 1765 when Konbaung armies captured the peninsula from the Siamese. The war proved decisive. Ethnic Burman families from the north began settling in the delta after the war. By the early 19th century, assimilation and intermarriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Background The authority of Toungoo Dynasty with the capital at Ava (Inwa) had long been in decline when the Mon of Lower Burma broke away in 1740, and founded the Restored Hanthawaddy Kingdom with the capital at Pegu (Bago). The \\"palace kings\\" at Ava had been unable to defend against the Manipuri raids, which began in 1724 and had been ransacking increasingly deeper parts of Upper Burma. Ava failed to recover southern Lan Na (Chiang Mai) that revolted in 1727, and did nothing to prevent the annexation of northern Shan states by Qing China in the mid-1730s. King Mahadhammaraza Dipadi of Toungoo made feeble efforts to recover Lower Burma in the early 1740s, but by 1745, Hanthawaddy had successfully established itself in Lower Burma. The low-grade warfare between Ava and Pegu went on until late 1750, when Pegu launched its final assault, invading Upper Burma in full force. By early 1752, Peguan forces, equipped with French arms, had reached the gates of Ava. Upayaza, the heir apparent of Hanthawaddy throne, issued a proclamation, summoning the administrative officers in the country north of the city to submit, and swear allegiance to the king of Hanthawaddy. Many regional chiefs of Upper Burma faced a choice: whether to join the Hanthawaddy forces or resist occupation. A few chose to cooperate. But many others chose to resist.Phayre 1967: 149 Upper Burma (1752–1754) By late March 1752, it was clear to everyone that Ava's fate was sealed. Hanthawaddy forces had breached Ava's outer defenses, and pushed Avan defenses inside the palace walls. At Moksobo in the Mu valley about 60 miles northwest of Ava, one village headman named Aung Zeya persuaded 46 villages in home region to join him in resistance. Aung Zeya proclaimed himself king with the royal style of Alaungpaya (the Future Buddha), and founded the Konbaung Dynasty. He prepared the defenses by stockading his village, now renamed Shwebo, and building a moat around it. He had the jungle outside the stockade cleared, the ponds destroyed and the wells filled. Konbaung was only one among many other resistance forces, at Salin along the middle Irrawaddy and Mogaung in the far north, which had independently sprung up across panicked Upper Burma. Fortunately for the resistance forces, the Hanthawaddy command mistakenly equated their capture of Ava with the victory over Upper Burma, and withdrew two-thirds of the invasion force back to Pegu, leaving just a third (less than 10,000 men) for what they considered a mop-up operation. Moreover, the Hanthawaddy leadership was concerned by the Siamese annexation of the upper Tenasserim peninsula (present-day Mon State) while Hanthawaddy troops were laying siege to Ava.Ba Pe 1952: 145–146Hall 1960 Chapter IX: Mon Revolt: 15 The decision to redeploy turned out to be an epic miscalculation as the Siamese threat was never as acute as the threat from Upper Burma, the traditional home of political power in Burma. The Siamese takeover of Upper Tenasserim was an opportunistic land grab taking advantage of Hanthawaddy's preoccupations with Ava. It is unclear whether the Siamese ever planned or had the means to extend their influence into mainland Lower Burma. It was much more probable that any existential threat to Hanthawaddy would come from Upper Burma. =Battle of Shwebo (1752)= The Hanthawaddy command nevertheless was confident that they could pacify the entire Upper Burma countryside. At first the strategy seemed to work. They established outposts as far north as Wuntho and Kawlin in present-day northern Sagaing Region, and the Gwe Shans of Madaya in present-day northern Mandalay Region joined them. The Hanthawaddy officer stationed at Singu, about 30 miles north of Ava, sent a detachment of 50 men to secure allegiance of the Mu valley.Phayre 1967: 150–151 Alaungpaya personally led forty of his best men to meet the detachment at Halin, south of Shwebo, and wiped them out. It was 20 April 1752 (Thursday, 4th waxing of Kason 1114 ME).Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 1905: 53 As Upayaza prepared to ship the main body of his troops downstream, leaving a garrison behind under his next- in-command, Talaban. Before leaving he received the unpleasant news that one of his detachments, sent to demand the allegiance of Moksobo had been cut to pieces by the inhabitants. He ought to have enquired more carefully into the nature of the incident, but made the fatal mistake of treating it as trivial. With the parting injunction to Talaban to make an example of the place, he set off home with his troops. Another larger detachment was sent. It too was defeated, with only half a dozen got back to Ava alive. In May, Gen. Talaban himself led a force of several thousand well-armed troops to take Shwebo. But the army lacked cannon to overcome the stockade, and it was forced to lay siege. A month into the siege, on 20 June 1752,Phayre 1967: 152 Alaungpaya burst out at the head of a general sortie and routed the besiegers. The Hanthawaddy forces withdrew in disarray, leaving their equipment, including several scores of muskets, which were \\"worth their weight in gold in these critical days\\".Harvey 1925: 220–221 =Consolidation of Upper Burma (1752–1753)= The news spread. Soon, Alaungpaya was mustering a proper army from across the Mu valley and beyond, using his family connections and appointing his fellow gentry leaders as his key lieutenants. Success drew fresh recruits every day from many regions across Upper Burma. Alaungpaya then selected 68 ablest men to be the commanders of his growing army. Many of the 68 would prove to be brilliant military commanders in Konbaung's domestic and external campaigns, and form the core leadership of Konbaung armies for the next thirty years. They include the likes of Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, Minkhaung Nawrahta, Maha Thiha Thura, Ne Myo Sithu, Maha Sithu and Balamindin. Most other resistance forces, as well as officers from the disbanded Palace Guards, had joined him with such arms as they retained. By October 1752, he had emerged the primary challenger to Hanthawaddy and driven out all Hanthawaddy outposts north of Ava, and their allies Gwe Shans from Madaya. He also defeated a rival resistance leader, Chit Nyo of Khin-U. A dozen legends gathered around his name. Men felt that when he led them they could not fail. Despite repeated setbacks, Pegu incredibly still did not send in reinforcements even as Alaungpaya consolidated his gains throughout Upper Burma. Instead of sending every troop they had, they merely replaced Talaban, the general who won Ava, with another general, Toungoo Ngwegunhmu. By late 1753, Konbaung forces controlled all of Upper Burma except Ava. On 3 January 1754, Alaungpaya's second son, Hsinbyushin, only 17, successfully retook Ava, which was left ruined and burned.Hall 1960: 17, Aung-Thwin 1996: 79 for the exact date The whole of Upper Burma was clear of Hanthawaddy troops. Alaungpaya then turned to nearer Shan States to secure the rear, and to draw fresh levies. He received homage from the nearer sawbwas (saophas or chiefs) as far north as Momeik.Harvey 1925: 222–224 Ruins at Ava Hanthawaddy counter-offensive (1754) In March 1754, Hanthawaddy did what they should have done two years before, and sent the entire army. It would have been 1751–1752 all over again except that they had to face Alaungpaya instead of an effete dynasty. At first, the invasion went as planned. The Hanthawaddy forces led by Upayaza, the heir-apparent, and Gen. Talaban defeated the Konbaung armies led by Alaungpaya's sons Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin at Myingyan. One Hanthawaddy army chased Hsinbyushin to Ava, and laid siege to the city. Another army chased Naungdawgyi's army, advancing as far as Kyaukmyaung a few miles from Shwebo, where Alaungpaya was residing. The Hanthawaddy flotilla had complete control of the entire Irrawaddy River. But they could not make further progress. They met heavy Konbaung resistance at Kyaukmyaung and lost many men trying to take a heavily fortified Ava. Two months into the invasion, the invasion was going nowhere. The Hanthawaddy forces had lost many men and boats, and were short on ammunition and supplies. In May, Alaungpaya personally led his armies (10,000 men, 1000 cavalry, 100 elephants) in the Konbaung counterattack, and pushed back the invaders to Sagaing, on the west bank of the Irrawaddy, opposite Ava. On the east bank, Hsinbyushin also broke the siege of Ava. With the rainy season just a few weeks away, the Hanthawaddy command decided to retreat.Kyaw Thet 1962: 278 Meanwhile, Burman refugees who had escaped general slaughter by the delta Mons seized Prome (Pyay), the historical border town between Upper Burma and Lower Burma, and shut the gates to the retreating Hanthawaddy armies. Knowing the importance of Prome for the safety of his kingdom, King Binnya Dala of Hanthawaddy ordered his forces to retake Prome at any cost. Led by Talaban, the Hanthawady forces consisted of 10,000 men and 200 war boats laid siege to Prome.Phayre 1967: 155 Turning into an ethnic conflict By late 1754, the siege of Prome was going nowhere for Talaban's men. The besiegers had been able to fight off Konbaung attempts to lift the siege but they could not take the fortified city either. At Pegu, some of the Hanthawaddy commanders now feared Alaungpaya's full-scale invasion of the south, and looked for an alternative. Preferring the loose rule of a weak king, they attempted to free the captive king, Mahadhammaraza Dipati on the throne of Hanthawaddy. The plot was discovered by Binnya Dala, who executed not only the conspirators but also the former king himself and other captives from Ava in October 1754. This shortsighted action removed the only possible rival to Alaungpaya, and allowed those who had stayed loyal to the former king to join Alaungpaya with an easy conscience.Htin Aung 1967: 162–163 The conflict increasingly turned into an ethnic conflict between the Burman north and the Mon south. It was not always so. When the southern rebellion began in 1740, the Mon leaders of the rebellion welcomed southern Burmans and Karens who despised Ava's rule. The first king of Restored Hanthawaddy, Smim Htaw Buddhaketi, despite his Mon title, was an ethnic Burman. Burmans of the south had served in the Mon-speaking Hanthawaddy army although there had been episodes of purges of Burmans throughout the south by their Mon compatriots since 1740. (About 8000 ethnic Burmans were massacred in 1740.) Instead of persuading their Burman troops to stay, when they needed every last soldier, the Hanthawaddy leadership escalated \\"self-defeating\\" policies of ethnic polarization. They began requiring all Burmans in the south to wear an earring with a stamp of the Pegu heir-apparent and to cut their hair in Mon fashion as a sign of loyalty. This persecution strengthened Alaungpaya's hand. Alaungpaya was only happy to exploit the situation, encouraging remaining Burman troops to come over to him. Many did. Konbaung invasion of Lower Burma (1755–1757) While the Hanthawaddy leadership alienated their Burman constituency in the south, Alaungpaya gathered troops from all over Upper Burma, including Shan, Kachin and Chin levies. By January 1755, he was ready to launch a full-scale invasion of the south. The invading army now had a considerable manpower advantage. Hanthawaddy troops still had better firearms and modern weaponry. (Hanthawaddy's firearm advantage would claim many Konbaung casualties in upcoming battles.) =Battle of Prome (June 1754 – February 1755)= Alaungpaya's first target was Prome that had been under siege by the Hanthawaddy troops for seven months. The Hanthawaddy troops were well entrenched in their earthwork stockades surrounding Prome. They had repulsed Konbaung troops trying to relieve the siege throughout 1754. In January, Alaungpaya himself returned with a large army. Still, Konbaung assaults could not make any headway amid heavy musket fire by determined Hanthawaddy defenses. Alaungpaya then ordered large by basket cases filled with hay, which were to be used as cover. Then in mid-February, the Konbaung troops forced their way in behind rolling baskets amid heavy slaughter by musket fire, and captured the Mayanbin fort, relieving the siege.Kyaw Thet 1962: 282 They captured many muskets, cannon and ammunition, which Hanthawaddy had acquired from Europeans at Thanlyin, along with 5000 prisoners of war. The Hanthawaddy troops retreated to the delta. Alaungpaya entered Prome, returned solemn thanks at the Shwesandaw Pagoda, and received homage of central Burma. He held an investiture, honoring those who had led the uprising against Hanthawaddy.Phayre 1967: 156–158 =Battle of Irrawaddy delta (April–May 1755)= In early April, he launched the invasion of Irrawaddy Delta in a blitz. He occupied Lunhse, renaming it Myanaung (Speedy Victory). Moving down the river, the advance guard defeated the Hanthawaddy resistance at Hinthada, and captured Danubyu by mid-April, right before the Burmese new year festivities. By late April, his forces had overrun the entire delta. Alaungpaya now received homage from local lords, as far away as Thandwe in Arakan (Rakhine). Then the Konbaung armies turned their sights on the main port city of Syriam (Thanlyin), which stood in their way to Pegu. On 5 May 1755, Konbaung troops defeated a Hanthawaddy division at Dagon, on the opposite bank of Syriam. Alaungpaya envisioned Dagon to be the future port city, added settlements around Dagon and renamed the new city, Yangon (lit. \\"End of Strife\\"). =Battle of Syriam (May 1755 – July 1756)= Joseph François Dupleix who initiated French intervention in Burma The fortified port of Syriam was guarded by Hanthawaddy troops, aided by the French personnel and arms. Konbaung armies' first attempt to take the city in May 1755 was a failure. Its sturdy walls and modern cannon made it difficult any attempt to storm the fortress. In June, Hanthawaddy launched a counter-offensive, attacking the Konbaung stronghold at Yangon. During this time, the Konbaung and the British under Captain George Baker have been in negotiations and the British in both Negrais and in Syriam have declared for Alaungpaya. While the British settlements agreed to side with the Konbaung forces, three British ships, the East India Company ship Arcot, \\"Hunter\\" and \\"Elizabeth\\" joined the Hanthawaddy forces, apparently without orders by the company. The counterattack was unsuccessful. The British, fearing reprisals by Alaungpaya, now speedily sent, Captain Baker, to Alaungpaya at Shwebo with presents of cannon and muskets and with orders to conclude a friendship.Myint-U 2006: 94–95 Although Alaungpaya was becoming deeply suspicious of English intentions, he also needed to secure modern arms against French-defended Syriam. He agreed that the English could stay at their colony at Negrais, which they had seized since 1753, but postponed signing any immediate treaty with the company. Instead, he proposed an alliance between the two countries. The English who were about to enter the Seven Years' War against the French seemed like natural allies. Despite what Alaungpaya regarded as a magnanimous gesture over Negrais no direct military help of any kind materialized. Konbaung troops would now have to take Syriam the hard way. The siege continued for the remainder of 1755. The French inside were desperate for reinforcements from their India headquarters at Pondicherry. Alaungpaya returned to the front in January 1756 with his two sons, Naungdawgyi and Hsinbyushin. In July, Alaungpaya launched another attack by water and by land, capturing the only French ship left at the port, and the French factory at the outskirts of the town. On 14 July 1756 (3rd waning of Waso 1118 ME),Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 1905: 153 Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw, the chief of musket corps and top Konbaung general, was severely wounded by cannon fire. As Minhla Minkhaung Kyaw lay dying of his wounds and being brought back by boat, the king went down to the boat himself to see his old childhood friend, who had won him many battles. The king publicly mourned the death of his chief general and honored him with a funeral under a white umbrella before the whole army.Alaungpaya Ayedawbon 1961: 96Harvey 1925: 236 The leader of the French, Sieur de Bruno, secretly tried to negotiate with Alaungpaya, but was found out and put in prison by Hanthawaddy commanders. The siege went on. For Alaungpaya, the worry was that French reinforcements would soon arrive. He decided that the time had come for the fortress to be stormed, now. He knew that the French and the Mons, expecting no quarter, would resist fiercely and that hundreds of his men would die in any attempt to breach the walls. He called for volunteers and then selected 93, whom he named the Golden Company of Syriam, a name that would find pride of place in Burmese nationalist mythology. They included guards, officers, and royal descendants of Bayinnaung. The afternoon before, as the early monsoon rains poured down in torrents outside the makeshift huts, they ate together in their king's presence. Alaungpaya gave each a leather helmet and lacquer armor. That evening, on 25 July 1756, as the Konbaung troops banged their drums and played loud music to encourage Syriam's defenders into thinking festivities were underway and to relax their watch, the Golden Company scaled the walls. At the dawn of 26 July 1756, after bloody hand-to-hand fighting they managed to pry open the great wooden gates, and in darkness, amid the war cries of the Konbaung troops (\\"Shwebotha!\\" \\"Shwebotha!\\"; lit. sons of Shwebo) and the screams of the women and the children inside, the city was overrun. The Hanthawaddy commander barely escaped the carnage. Alaungpaya presented the stacks of gold and silver captured from the city to the surviving 20 men of the Golden Company and the families of the 73 who died.Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 (1905): 155–157 A few days later and a few days too late, on 29 July 1756, two French relief ships, the Galatee and the Fleury arrived, loaded with troops as well as arms, ammunition, and food from Pondicherry. The Burmese seized the ships and press-ganged 200 French officers and soldiers into Alaungpaya's army. Also on board were 35 ship's guns, five field guns, and 1300 muskets. It was a considerable haul. More importantly, the battle ended French involvement in the Burmese civil war. =Battle of Pegu (October 1756 – May 1757)= A Manipuri Cassay horseman in the service of Konbaung army After the fall of Syriam, Alaungpaya waited out the monsoon season. In September, one Konbaung army marched from Syriam in the south, while another army marched from Toungoo (Taungoo) in the north. The advance was slow with great losses as the Hanthawaddy defenses still had cannon and they were literally fighting with their backs to the wall. By mid-October, the combined armies converged on Pegu. Konbaung war boats too flung off Hanthawaddy fire-rafts and completed the Konbaung line around the city. By January 1757, the city was starving, and Binnya Dala asked for terms. Alaungpaya demanded no less than a full unconditional surrender. Those surrounding Binnya Dala were determined to fight on, and put the king under restraint. The famine only grew worse. On 6 May 1757 (4th waning of Kason 1119)Maung Maung Tin Vol. 1 (1905): 128 Konbaung armies unleashed their final assault on the starving city. The Konbaung armies broke through at moonrise, and massacred men, women, and children without distinction. Alaungpaya entered through the Mohnyin Gate, surrounded by a crowd of his guardsmen and French gunners, and prostrated himself before the Shwemawdaw Pagoda. The city walls and 20 gates by Tabinshwehti and Bayinnaung two centuries before were then razed to the ground. After the fall of Pegu, the governors of Martaban (Mottama), and Tavoy (Dawei) who had sought Siamese protection, now backtracked and sent in tribute to Alaungpaya.Harvey 1925: 241Kyaw Thet 1962: 289 Aftermath After the fall of Pegu, remnants of Mon resistance fell back to the upper Tenasserim peninsula (present-day Mon State), and remained active there with Siamese support. However, the resistance was disorganized, and did not control any major towns. It remained active only because Konbaung's control of the upper Tenasserim peninsula in 1757–1759 was still largely nominal. Its effective control still did not extend beyond Martaban as the majority of the Konbaung armies were back north in Manipur and in the northern Shan states.Myint-U 2006: 100–101Harvey 1925: 238–239 However, no single southern leader emerged to rally the Mon populace as Alaungpaya did with the Burmans in 1752. A rebellion broke out in 1758 throughout Lower Burma but was put down by local Konbaung garrisons. The window of opportunity came to a close in the second half of 1759 when the Konbaung armies, having conquered Manipur and the northern Shan states, were back down south, preparing for their invasion of the Tenasserim coast and Siam. The Konbaung armies seized the upper Tenasserim coast following the Burmese-Siamese War (1759–1760), and pushed out the Mon resistance farther down the coast. (Alaungpaya died in the war.) The resistance was driven out of Tenasserim in 1765 when Alaungpaya's son Hsinbyushin seized the lower coastline as part of the Burmese-Siamese War (1765–1767). Legacy The Konbaung–Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\".Myint-U 2006: 97–98 Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824–1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end.

In a career spanning more than four decades, he has been a member of many bands and has moved through a variety of musical genres, from early R&B;, psychedelic improvisational rock of the 1960s, folk, country music, arena rock in the 1970s, and blues. He usually plays bass, keyboards, or both in bands. Overview Pete Sears played on the Rod Stewart albums Gasoline Alley, Every Picture Tells A Story (which was listed high in Rolling Stone's top 500 best albums of all time), Never a Dull Moment, and Smiler. He also played on the hit singles \\"Maggie May\\", and \\"Reason to Believe\\". During this period, Sears toured the US with Long John Baldry blues band, and played with John Cipollina in Copperhead. Sears joined the band Jefferson Starship in 1974 and remained with the group through the transition to Starship, before departing in 1987. After leaving Starship he worked with bluesman Nick Gravenites, and many other artists including Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Bob Weir, Maria Muldaur, Rich Kirch, Taj Mahal, and Mimi Farina. (1992 to 2002) he played keyboards in the Jorma Kaukonen Trio with Kaukonen and Michael Falzarano, and with Kaukonen, Falzarano, and Jack Casady and Harvey Sorgen in Hot Tuna. Sears has played with many other musicians through the years, including Dr. John, John Lee Hooker, Leigh Stephens and Micky Waller in Silver Metre; Long John Baldry, Copperhead with John Cipollina, Jerry Garcia, Chris Robinson Brotherhood, Levon Helm, Steve Kimock, Dave Hidalgo, Sons of Fred, Fleur de Lyse, Sam Gopal Dream, Jimi Hendrix, Pete Brown, Bob Weir, Los Cenzontles, Phil Lesh, Leftover Salmon, and Los Lobos. Currently, he divides his time between the David Nelson Band, Chris Robinson and Green Leaf Rustlers, Zero, California Kind, Harvey Mandel, and Moonalice. Sears has also written and recorded the original score for many documentary films, including the award-winning \\"The Fight in the Fields\\" – Cesar Chávez and the Farmworkers Struggle directed by Ray Telles and Rick Tehada Flores. His most recent film, also directed by Ray Telles and co- produced by Ken Rabin, is called The Storm That Swept Mexico (2011) about the Mexican Revolution. Career Sears was born in Bromley, Kent. His career as a professional musician began in 1964, touring the United Kingdom with the band Sons of Fred. As well as playing British television shows such as Ready Steady Go and Thank Your Lucky Stars, Sons of Fred also recorded at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. Pete Sears went on to play and record with many musical artists, including The Fleur De Lys in 1966, and the psychedelic underground band Sam Gopal Dream which featured guitarist Mick Hutchinson, Sears on bass and Hammond organ, and the Indian tabla player Sam Gopal. Jimi Hendrix once sat in with the band at the Speakeasy Club in London. Jimi Hendrix drummer Mitch Mitchell later asked Sears to play bass in a band he was forming while still playing with Hendrix in 1969. Sears was a session musician during the late 1960s, including recording piano with the blues band Steamhammer. Steamhammer would back up the legendary Freddie King when he toured the UK. In early 1969, Sears along with Terry Cox of Pentangle, Jeff Beck's drummer Micky Waller, Jimmy Litherland of Coloseum, John Wetton of King Crimson, and Pete York of the Spencer Davis Group, recorded a folk rock album with Marian Segal and Jade. The album, Fly on Strange Wings is considered one of the seminal British folk rock albums of the 1960s and is highly valued by collectors. Around this time Sears teamed up with original Fairport Convention singer, Judy Dyble, and Van Morrison's Them organist, Jackie McAuley, to form the band Trader Horne. In the summer of 1969, Sears left Trader Horne just before they began recording. Blue Cheer guitarist Leigh Stephens invited him to California for the first time. Sears, Stephens, Micky Waller (drummer), and Jack Reynolds (singer) formed Silver Metre, recorded one album at Trident Studios in London, England, released on the National General label,Eyries, Patrice, David Edwards and Mike Callahan. (21 October 2005). National General Album Discography. Both Sides Now Publications. Accessed on 1 May 2014. produced by their manager, FM rock radio pioneer Tom Donahue. After Silver Metre broke up, Sears had returned to England to play on the Rod Stewart album Gasoline Alley. Stoneground manager Tom Donahue recruited Sears in London, during their Medicine Ball Caravan (1970) European tour later returning to the Marin County with them to record their first album, also produced by Tom Donahue. From 1970 through 1974, Sears returned to session work, including playing on Stewart's early British solo albums: Gasoline Alley, Every Picture Tells a Story including the hit singles \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Reason To Believe\\", Never a Dull Moment, and Smiler. He also played bass with the Long John Baldry Blues Band on their first tour of the United States and played bass and keyboards with John Cipollina in the band Copperhead. Sears left Copperhead just before recording their first album to work on Rod Stewart's Never a Dull Moment album in London, but mainly to join a new band Nicky Hopkins was putting together. Hopkins, who was on tour with the Rolling Stones had rented Sears a house in Mill Valley, California until he finished with the Stones tour. However, Hopkins was ultimately unable to form the band due to ill health and a dislike of the road. Sears went on to co-produce, arrange the music and play on, Kathi McDonald's Insane Asylum album, using guest artists like Sly Stone, The Pointer Sisters, Nils Lofgren, Neal Schon, Aynsley Dunbar, and the Tower of Power horns. He also co-founded a band called Sears, Schon, Errico with Neal Schon and Greg Errico, playing the Diamond Head Crater Festival in Hawaii, as well as several California shows. Sears spent two weeks recording with Ike Turner at Ike's studio, Bolic Sound in Los Angeles. Tina Turner was there one night and recorded vocals on some of the tracks they had recorded, including a version of George Harrison's song \\"Something\\" on which Turner changed the \\"she\\" to \\"he\\". =With Jefferson Starship and Hot Tuna= Sears (left) and Craig Chaquico of Jefferson Starship in 1980 In 1974, Sears joined Jefferson Starship, replacing Peter Kaukonen and switching back and forth between bass and keyboards with fellow multi-instrumentalist David Freiberg. He also wrote two or three songs per album with Grace Slick. Grace and Pete wrote the song Hyperdrive for the Dragon Fly album. Dragon Fly, made in 1974, was the first official \\"Jefferson Starship\\" release as a band. Pete’s first brush with Grunt Records was when Airplane drummer Joey Covington brought him to the studio to play bass on Papa John Creach’s first solo album. Grace Slick sang vocals in the same track Pete played on, “The Janitor Drives a Cadillac”. During the 1970s and early 1980s he would perform a ten-minute bass solo regardless of the size of the venue, even when playing to a 100,000 people in New York City's Central Park in 1975. Singer Grace Slick left the band after her non-appearance caused a riot in Germany in 1978; within months drummer John Barbata was severely injured in a car crash and the band's other singer, Marty Balin, also left. The band hired vocalist Mickey Thomas and, at Sears' suggestion, drummer Aynsley Dunbar. The band's musical direction changed, adopting a hard rock edge after Kantner hired rock producer Ron Nevison. Slick left the band for one album, Freedom at Point Zero and Sears' wife Jeannette Sears became one of the principal lyricists alongside Kantner, and Chaquico. Pete and Jeannette wrote some of the band's best-known songs, such as \\"Stranger\\", \\"Save Your Love\\", and \\"Winds of Change\\". Grace had rejoined by this time, and Sears remained with the band after the departure of leader Paul Kantner and the subsequent name change to \\"Starship\\", but he became increasingly at odds with the commercial direction the band was taking. Pete and Jeannette were working heavily on Central American human rights issues at this time, and wrote several songs on the subject that were considered by the band to be too political in nature for a mostly upbeat pop record. He played only bass on the double-platinum 1985 album Knee Deep in the Hoopla and finally left the group in 1987 shortly after appearing in the music video to \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\". In the early 1990s, Sears played keyboards with San Francisco based psychedelic, jazz, rock band ZERO. Pete has sat in with ZERO as recently as 2013. From 1992 to 2001, Sears played keyboards with Jefferson Airplane's Jorma Kaukonen, and Jack Casady, in Hot Tuna. The band also included Michael Falzarano and Harvey Sorgen. They would sometimes tour as \\"The Jorma Kaukonen Trio\\" with Sears playing bass on the keyboards with his left hand. Sears sometimes teaches piano at Jorma Kaukonen's, Fur Peace Ranch guitar Camp in south eastern Ohio. In 2011, Hot Tuna flew Sears out to New York City to perform at Jorma Kaukonen's 70th birthday bash at the Beacon Theater. As well as his Tuna bandmates, Sears played that night with Bob Weir, Steve Earle, and Oteil Burbridge. =Other collaborations= Through the years, he has recorded or performed with many other people, including Jerry Garcia, David Nelson, Warren Haynes, Leigh Stephens, Nick Gravenites, Peter Rowan, Steve Cropper, Roy Harper, Nicky Hopkins, Steve Kimock, Zydeco Flames, Ron Wood, Leftover Salmon, Eric McFadden, Betty Davis, Bob Weir, Mickey Hart, and Phil Lesh. He has also worked live and in the studio and performed with John Lee Hooker, who wrote and recorded a song with Sears, called \\"Elizabeth\\". He has shared the stage with artists like Jimi Hendrix, The Allman Brothers, Los Lobos, Alvin Youngblood Hart, Sam Bush, Elvis Costello, Paul Butterfield, Michael Bloomfield, Levon Helm, the Grateful Dead, David Crosby, and Carlos Santana among others. Sears performing with Moonalice at the 2015 Lockn' Festival Sears' solo CDs include Watchfire with guests Jerry Garcia, Babatunde Olatunji, David Grisman, Mickey Hart, Mimi Farina, and Holly Near. Along with Jeannette, who wrote the majority of the album's lyrics, Sears became involved with human rights issues in Central America during the 1980s, and led a highly successful radio drive to raise food and clothing for refugees from the civil wars of Guatemala and El Salvador sheltering in the bay area. They formed a non-profit video production company called \\"Watchfire Productions\\", with Mark Adler, Mary McCue Obrian, and Emmy Award-winning documentary film director Ray Telles, producing a music video about human rights abuses on the Mayas of Guatemala. The project was funded by Jerry Garcia and the Rex Foundation, the Tides Foundation, and Earth Island Institute. Hundreds of free copies of the video were distributed free of charge to human rights organisations around the world working to help stop the genocide in Central America. It was also aired extensively on the Canadian Much Music TV channel. During the mid-to-late 1980s, Sears and singer-songwriter, activist Mimi Farina, played at many benefits and protests in the San Francisco Bay Area in support of various Central American human rights, and environmental related causes. He once joined bluesman Nick Gravenites on the back of a flatbed truck, to drive down Market Street in San Francisco, playing the blues in support of nuclear disarmament, and protesting the US-backed injustices in Central America. They were joined by a hundred thousand other peace marchers. In 1988, a group of citizens from the Soviet Union marched across the USA as a show of support for peace and the end of the Cold War between the two countries. On 16 July 1988, a concert was held in the Band Shell in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park, organised by Ron Frazier and Bill McCarthy, who had hosted a previous event for the marchers in Los Angeles. Sears was asked to provide and organise the music for the event, so he invited his current band, ZERO, along with other musician friends including Jerry Garcia, whose band the Grateful Dead were performing later that night at the Greek Theater in Berkeley. Several Soviet rock bands, folk singers, and poets from the march also performed as well as two Tibeten drummers. Speeches were also held. Sears was one of a very small group of Bay-area musicians invited to audition for the Grateful Dead's keyboard position in the summer of 1990 following the death of Brent Mydland; the chair was eventually given to Vince Welnick from The TubesSan Francisco Chronicle, June 30, 2006: \\"Vince Welnick lived the dream, playing music with the Grateful Dead...\\" Joel Selvin. Sears performed at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tribute to John Lee Hooker at Stanford University as one of Hooker's guests. He also wrote a song with Hooker, \\"Elizabeth\\", which they performed live together in the studio on Sears' solo album The Long Haul. The track, \\"Elizabeth\\" was the last \\"live in the studio\\" band performance with no overdubs that John Lee Hooker was to record before his death in July 2001. \\"The Long Haul\\" includes guests Davey Pattison, Charlie Musselwhite, Levon Helm, Jorma Kaukonen, Jack Casady, Steve Kimock, Francis Clay, Nick Gravenites, Maria Muldaur, Wavy Gravy, Shana Morrison, Rich Kirch and John Lee Hooker. Pete Sears currently performs with David Nelson Band, Steve Kimock & Zero, Moonalice, Chris Robinson & Green Leaf Rustlers, Harvey Mandel, Louisiana Love Act, and California Kind. Jeannette Sears Pete and his wife Jeannette met in 1971 and began their relationship as a songwriting team. They married in 1975 in Mill Valley, California. They became active with numerous Central American relief organisations through the '80s, working on benefits and immediate relief to refugees. In the late 1980s they spearheaded a radio drive in the San Francisco Bay area to raise food and clothing for refugees fleeing the ravages of civil war in Guatemala and El Salvador. In 1988, the California Institute of Integral Studies gave them an award for humanitarian work in the Bay area. Her passion for social justice shows up in her first novel, A Light Rain of Grace.

Because of the semi-diurnal tides and the river influence, slack water occurs at approximately half tide and not at high or low water as at most other ports.Port of Saint John, Port Conditions The port is administered by the Saint John Port Authority, a federal agency. Major products shipped through the port include oil, forest products and potash. History St. John Harbour about 1898.The Port of Saint John lies within Mi'gma'gi, the Mikmaw Nation ancestral stewardship region and greater Wabanaki Confederacy ancestral governance area. The location was first visited by Samuel de Champlain on his voyage of discovery to the New World in 1604, who described the Saint John River as “one of the largest and deepest we had yet seen” and who was advised by his Mi’kmaq guides that the river provided a route to the Saint Lawrence River valley with only a short portage.David Hackett Fischer, Champlain’s Dream, Knopf, 2008, p. 166 Because of its strategic location, it became the site of a French stronghold known as Fort La Tour. Though the fort was sacked in 1645, the river remained an important trade route for French, English and First Nations traders throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. The port did not begin to develop in earnest until the influx of United Empire Loyalists in 1783. It developed rapidly as a result of timber trade and shipbuilding. Saint John became the province's leading industrial centre during the 19th century with much of the shipbuilding industry being concentrated on Courtney Bay outside the main harbour area. One of the best known ships built in Saint John was the Marco Polo (1851) which became renowned for its speed. The Great Famine of Ireland of 1845–1849 saw a large immigrant influx, and to handle the new arrivals, the government constructed a quarantine station and hospital on Partridge Island at the mouth of the harbour. The immigration station continued to operate for many decades. In 1859, Partridge Island also became known as the site of the first successful demonstration of an automated steam- powered foghorn, invented by the Scotsman Robert Foulis who had settled in the city. The foghorn is \\"ranked by historians as one of the most outstanding in the development of navigation aids.\\"Dictionary of Canadian Biography, \\"Robert Foulis\\" 1894 map of Saint John Harbour For many years, the Port prospered as the winter port for Montreal. In 1889 the Canadian Pacific Railway opened a line across the state of Maine from Montreal to Saint John and transferred the majority of its trans-Atlantic passenger and cargo shipping to the port during the winter months. During the First World War, the Port of Saint John became a trans-shipment point for the British Empire's war effort. It had less importance during World War II as the navy focus had been consolidated in Halifax. The port suffered a decline following the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway and the introduction of icebreaker services in the Seaway in the 1960s. In 1994 CPR left Saint John when it sold the line to shortline operator New Brunswick Southern Railway. The Canadian National Railway still services Saint John with a secondary mainline from Moncton.

Rose Chibambo organised Malawian women in their political fight against the British as a political force to be reckoned with alongside their menfolk in the push for independence. She was arrested on 23 March 1959, two days after giving birth to a girl, and taken to Zomba prison. Her fellow freedom fighters, including Hastings Banda were arrested earlier, on the morning of 3 March when governor Robert Armitage declared a state of emergency. After Malawi gained independence in 1964, Rose Chibambo was the first woman minister in the new cabinet. When she fell out with Hastings Banda she was forced into exile for thirty years, returning after the restoration of democracy Background Rose Lomathinda Chibambo (Ziba maiden name) was born in Kafukule, Mzimba District on 8 September 1928 when Nyasaland was still a protectorate under British colonial rule. In 1947, she married Edwin Chibambo, formerly a teacher and now a civil servant. Her husband was the son of the Reverend Yesaya Chibambo, one of the first Africans in the protectorate to be ordained as a Christian minister. In 1948 her husband was posted to the Zomba Public Works department. She completed her secondary education at night school in Zomba in 1948 while pregnant with her first child. She had another child in 1951, and four more later. The youngest was born in 1961. Nyasaland African Congress leader In 1952, Rose became aware of Nyasaland African Congress (NAC) politics during the controversy over the colonial government's plan to make Nyasaland part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which the NAC saw as a betrayal of the agreement by the government to put the interests of Africans first. She decided that women should be more involved in the struggle, and began to organise her friends in Zomba, mostly the wives of civil servants. Some issues were specific to women, such as the fact that in some stores women could only do their shopping through a wicket, and that elderly women were not examined in private in the hospitals, but in rooms filled with women of all ages. She once stated: \\"[Y]ou know, we are the mothers. We are the ones who bring out children and these children are employed by Wenela [in South Africa] at that time. They go to Wenela and most of them die there. They don't come back alive. And then there's a lot of oppression. There's this thangata and with that federation, unfortunately for them, that time, they had already started removing people in the areas where they thought it was best for Europeans or it was best for farming ... They wanted to make room for Europeans to settle. I said, you can see all these things. Now, we are being removed in our rural areas. We are being pushed here and there. And the women understood. They said, oh yes, then we must do something\\". In 1953 Edwin Chibambo was transferred to Blantyre, according to Rose because of his political activities. Rose Chibambo joined the local NAC branch and was elected treasurer, the first woman to hold a senior position in the NAC. In Blantyre, she joined forces with Vera Chirwa to form the Nyasaland African Women's League, closely associated with the NAC. Executives of the Women's League would select fabric from which they made matching outfits. The purpose was to show solidarity at public occasions, identifying members as a group. She respected the moderate leaders of the NAC but thought some, including the President J.R.N. Chinyama, had been too cautious. In Chinyama's case this might be since he remembered his father's execution after the Chilembe uprising of 1915. She rejected federation and in the later part of 1955 she was among those who called for the withdrawal of the NAC members Manowa Chirwa and Clement Kumbikano from the Federal parliament in Salisbury. At 30 March 1956 annual general meeting in Blantyre the delegates from Johannesburg supported her position on non-co-operation with the Federal government, although she had been pessimistic that they would be given a hearing. In 1956, Rose Chibambo organised a group of women to protest when the NAC president James Frederick Sangala and secretary T.D.T. Banda were arrested for sedition. Her group was arrested and fined after they travelled by bus to the High Court in Zomba singing: ::\\"War! War! War today! We are going to have war. We don't want, we don't want, we don't want federation. We want freedom today!\\" In a 1999 interview, Rose described the use of song at the women's meetings. She said \\"In most cases, our singing, like in the woman's league, we would take some of the songs sung in the villages, then we put in political words to suit the occasion... There wasn't any particular person at that time, that this was the one who composed those songs for us to sing. No, it was just general singing. Just as we are here. You could start a song, and our songs in most cases, our African songs, they are traditional. They are not difficult to sing. We could easily pick it up, and then we would all sing\\". She was quite clear that singing and dancing was not the primary purpose of the women's meetings. She said \\"I had this feeling ... women should be part and parcel of the whole movement, even of running the country. Women should be involved in decision making. That was my aim\\". Hastings Banda period In July 1958, Dr. Hastings Banda was elected President of the Congress, and began to tour the country speaking out for independence. In 1958, Chibambo organised the League of Malawi Women. The group used the profits from a monopoly on the sale of millet beer to fund their activities. With growing tension between the NAC and the colonial authorities, in a January 1959 Congress meeting it was agreed that if Banda was arrested or deported a general strike would be called. Rose Chibambo would become a member of a four-person executive committee to conduct the affairs of the congress in Banda's absence. On 3 March 1959, the governor Robert Armitage declared a state of emergency. Over the next 24 hours, almost all the MCP leaders were arrested. In April 1959, Jet magazine reported: \\"The top woman leader of the outlawed African National Congress, Mrs. Rose Chibambo, 29, who was arrested after giving birth to her fifth child, has taken the infant with her to jail\\". She had been allowed to remain at liberty until the child was born. The British later accepted that independence for Nysasaland was inevitable, and released Hastings Banda in March 1960. Banda was appointed Life President of the Malawi Congress Party (MCP), the successor to the NAC. The MCP swept the elections to the Legislative Council in 1961. On 1 February 1963, Nyasaland gained self-governance, and Banda was appointed Prime Minister. Rose Chibambo won the Mzimba North seat in the 1964 elections and was made Parliamentary Secretary for Community and Social Development.Owen J. M. Kalinga (2012) Historical Dictionary of Malawi p83 The country became independent as Malawi later in the year. Dismissal and later career On 7 September 1964 there was a cabinet crisis, in which Chibambo and others opposed Hastings Banda. Issues included Banda's decision to charge for health services and to move slowly in Africanization of the civil service. This was coupled with a general feeling that Banda was becoming increasingly autocratic. Chibambo was dismissed from the cabinet the next day. Banda declared that the rebel leaders were traitors to the state and threats to national security. Chibambo and the others were suspended from the party, which prevented them from attending party meetings and prevented members of the party from attending their meetings, giving Banda full control of the MCP. She and her husband faced constant harassment until they fled to Zambia in 1965, where they faced the challenge of starting a new life. Rose Chibambo returned to Malawi in 1994. She became a businesswoman in Mzuzu, and was prominent in politics and church activities. She was a member of Church Action Relief Development, which assists the orphans of victims of HIV/AIDS, the Christian Service Committee, the Malawi Council of Churches and the Interdenominational Support Group for Prisoners. She died on January 12, 2016 in Mwaiwathu Private Hospital in Blantyre at age 86. Legacy In 2009 the President Bingu wa Mutharika met Rose Chibambo and honoured her, naming a street in Mzuzu City after her. As of 1 January 2012, she appears on Malawi’s 200 Kwacha banknote.

Its lode mining claims covered approximately on the wide vein called the Juneau gold belt of which it owned one mile on the outcrop. Mining properties and operations The company's property was in Alaska's Juneau mining district. The AJGMC purchased over two dozen patented claims in the Silver Bow Basin for lode mining low grade gold ore. The main group of claims was about in length and about in width, occurring over approximately on the southeast side of Gold Creek. About of outlying group claims were in Snowslide Gulch. Tunnels and the mill site stretched to the Gastineau Channel. The Alaska-Juneau mine was located from Juneau. The property also included the Lane & Hayward mine and the Bennet mine. The company's two stamp mills, driven exclusively by water power, were located on Gold Creek. Its 30-stamp mill was in operation from 1896 to 1914. The Ebner Gold Mining Company property adjoined the AJGMC on the northwest. Business operations Its Transfer Agent was Central Trust Company while its Registrar was Metropolitan Trust Company. The corporation office was located in Charleston, West Virginia. The Annual meeting was held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in April at the San Francisco office. The AJGMC and the Alaska Treadwell Gold Mining Company had integrated management and stockholding interests as, in 1900, Frederick W. Bradley purchased a major interest in AJGMC. He became president of AJGMC and Treadwell. Philip R. Bradley, brother of Frederick, was resident manager during the period of 1914-1920. The business offices of both these companies, as well as the Alaska-Gastineau Mining Company, were in the Mill Building, San Francisco, California. The working offices and records were located at the Treadwell gold mine on the north side of Douglas Island. In 1922, the office and records were moved to the AJGMC mining area on the other side of the Gastineau Channel. After the Alaska-Juneau mine closed in 1944 because of the World War II labor shortage, AJGMC sold its hydroelectric power to Alaska Electric Light & Power, Juneau's local utility company. In 1972, AEL&P; purchased all of the AJGMC holdings.

It burned NDL's Hoboken piers to the waterline, consumed or gutted nearby warehouses, gutted three of NDL's major transatlantic liners, and damaged or destroyed nearly 24 smaller craft. Most of the victims were seamen and other workers, but included women visiting one of the ships. Ocean liner losses Tracks of the North German Lloyd ships during the Hoboken Pier Fire 1900 Many of the deaths occurred as the flames reached several of NDL's transatlantic steamships docked at the piers, including the , , and . These ocean liners, which caught fire while their coal-fired steam engines were cold, became deathtraps for dozens of seamen and visitors who were unable to reach safety on deck, squeeze through portholes, or otherwise escape. Saale was gutted, with the highest death toll. After she became engulfed in flames, her mooring lines were cut, leaving her to drift as fire reached those further below deck. Finally towed after she drifted toward New York piers, she settled in the Jersey flats near Liberty Island. Her death toll included her captain (August Johann Mirow), and members (primarily women) of a group known as Christian Endeavor, who were visiting the ship before the fire started.The Great Hoboken Fire,” Insurance Register, Vol VII, No. 26, 1900-07-03, p.401-404. Main was furthest from the fire's starting point, but was soon engulfed with fire. She was unable to get loose from her moorings for more than seven hours, until the fire was nearly over. Damaged nearly beyond repair, Main was ultimately towed to Weehawken, New Jersey, where she was beached. Amazingly, 16 coal trimmers who had survived the fire hiding in a coal bunker then crawled out of the hulk. Two days after the fire began, the red-hot ship continued to smolder and smoke, which further delayed rescue and recovery efforts.\\"Fire Still Holds the Liner Main\\".

She eventually ran aground upriver near Weehawken. More than 200 people were on board when the fire began, including visitors.

NDL's was also docked in the company's Hoboken piers, but fared better than its sister ships. She was the first of the steamers that tugs tried to pull away from the pier (15 minutes after the fire began). Although she was afire at several places, fireboats soon put out those fires, and in the end she suffered little serious damage. The fire erupted on a Saturday that was considered a “half-holiday” when no departures were scheduled. Had any of the ships been ready to sail, the loss of life and property would have been much greater. Other losses The fire also destroyed several Campbell Stores warehouses, built by the Hoboken Land & Improvement Company, the nearby piers of the Scandinavian America Line and a railroad shed. According to The New York Times, the railroad shed belonged to West Shore Railroad, although it was more likely a shed of Hoboken Shore Railroad (which connected the West Shore Railroad's lines at the Weehawken Terminal to the Hoboken docks). A shed of Hamburg America Line was partly chopped down during the fire by the fire service to avoid spreading of the fire to the Hamburg America Line piers. The total value of property losses due to the fire was estimated (the morning after the fire) at $6.175 million, and (the following year) at $5.35 million.\\"A Year’s Fire Waste\\", Carpentry and Building, Vol. 23, March 1901, p. 58.

It remains one of the earliest methods of analyzing the brain and has allowed researchers to study the relationship between cortical structure and systemic function. Cortical stimulation mapping is used for a number of clinical and therapeutic applications, and remains the preferred method for the pre-surgical mapping of the motor cortex and language areas to prevent unnecessary functional damage. There are also some clinical applications for cortical stimulation mapping, such as the treatment of epilepsy. History The history of cortical stimulation mapping dates back to the late 19th century. Neurologists David Ferrier and Victor Horsley were some of the first to utilize this technique. Ferrier and Horsley employed CSM to further grasp the structure and function of the pre-Rolandic and post-Rolandic areas, also known as the pre central gyrus and post central gyrus. Prior to the development of more advanced methods, in 1888 C.B. Nancrede utilized a battery operated bipolar probe in order to map the motor cortex. In 1937, Wilder Penfield and Boldrey were able to show that stimulating the precentral gyrus elicited a response contralaterally; a significant finding given that it correlated to the anatomy based on which part of the brain was stimulated. In the early 1900s Charles Sherrington began to use monopolar stimulation in order to elicit a motor response. This technique allowed Sherrington to determine that the precentral gyrus (pre-Rolandic area) is a motor cortex and the postcentral gyrus (post-Rolandic area) is a sensory cortex. These findings, which were repeated by Harvey Cushing through the early 1900s, show that the Rolandic fissure is the point of separation between the motor and sensory cortices. Cushing's work with CSM moved it from an experimental technique to one that became a staple neurosurgery technique used to map the brain and treat epilepsy. Cushing took work that had previously been done on animals, specifically chimpanzees and orangutans, and was able to utilize cortical stimulation mapping to account for the differences between these species and humans. Cushing's work dramatically increased the effectiveness of the treatment utilizing cortical stimulation mapping, as neurosurgeons were now utilizing a more updated picture of the brain. Procedure Cortical stimulation mapping is an invasive procedure that has to be completed during a craniotomy. Once the dura mater is peeled back, an electrode is placed on the brain to test motor, sensory, language, or visual function at a specific brain site. The electrode delivers an electric current lasting from 2 to 10 seconds on the surface of the brain, causing a reversible lesion in a particular brain location. This lesion can prevent or produce a testable response, such as the movement of a limb or the ability to identify an object. The electric current from the electrode stimulates whatever function that site in the brain is responsible for, in essence telling the surgeon or examiner what a specific locale in the brain does. Electrodes are usually made of stainless steel or platinum-iridium embedded in a silastic material, and are usually circular with diameters of 2 to 3 mm. Electrode positioning varies from patient to patient, and electrodes can come in rows, in a grid array, or can be individually arranged. The number of electrodes necessary and their exact spatial arrangement is often determined in the operating room. Cortical stimulation mapping allows electrodes to be placed in exact locations to test brain function and identify if stimulation of the brain location causes a functional impairment in the patient. CSM can be completed using anesthetized patients or awake patients. Electrodes can either be placed directly on brain areas of interest or can be placed in the subdural space of the brain. Subdural electrodes can shift slightly and can be affected by cerebrospinal fluid in the subdural space, which could interfere with the current used to stimulate the brain from the electrodes and possibly cause shunting and dissipate the current, making the stimulation's effect less accurate. However, an advantage of subdural electrode grids is that they can be left in the brain for multiple days, and allow functional testing during stimulation outside the operating room. Current levels and density are an important consideration in all cortical stimulation mapping procedures. Current density, that is the amount of current applied to a defined area of the brain, must be sufficient to stimulate neurons effectively and not die off too quickly, yet low enough to protect brain tissue from damaging currents. Currents are kept at levels that have been determined safe and are only given as short bursts, typically bursts that slowly increase in intensity and duration until a response (such as a muscle movement) can be tested. Current intensity is usually set around bursts of 1 mA to begin and gradually increased by increments of 0.5 to 1 mA, and the current is applied for a few seconds. If the current applied causes afterdischarges, nerve impulses that occur after stimulation, then the levels are lowered. Studies on patients who have received cortical stimulation mapping have found no cortical damage in the tested areas. The different types and administration techniques for anesthesia have been shown to affect cortical stimulation mapping. CSM can be done performed on awake patients, called an awake craniotomy or in patients who have been placed under general anesthesia. If the patient is under general anesthesia, the depth of the anesthesia can affect the outcome because if the levels of muscle relaxation are too high due to neuromuscular blocking drugs, then the results from the mapping can be incorrect. For the awake procedure there are different considerations for patient care that the anesthesiologist must take into account. Rather than simply ensuring that the patient is asleep, the doctor can follow what is called the asleep-awake-asleep technique. In this technique the patient is anesthetized using a general anesthesia during the opening and closing portions of the procedure, but during the interim the patient is maintained utilizing local anesthesia. The local anesthesia techniques can be either a local field block or a regional nerve block of the scalp. The more common technique for the awake craniotomy is conscious sedation. In conscious sedation, the patient is only sedated during the opening and closing process, but never fully anesthetized, eliminating the need for breathing tubes, lessening the chances of complications, and lessening the chances of problems with motor response. Patients who undergo the procedure with an awake craniotomy instead of general anesthesia have better preservation of language function, a prediction of their seizure-free outcome based on corticography, a shorter hospitalization (which corresponds to a reduced cost of care), a decreased usage of invasive monitors, and decreased number of postoperative complications due to anesthesia such as nausea and vomiting. Somatotopy The idea of the cortical homunculus was created by Wilder Penfield. Cortical stimulation mapping is used for somatotopy to determine the areas of the cerebral cortex that connect through nerve fibers with different body parts. Cortical stimulation identifies which regions of the brain are vital for certain functions, thereby allowing a 'map' to be made which can be used to decide if brain areas are safe to remove. Cortical stimulation mapping led to the development of a homunculus for the motor and sensory cortices, which is a diagram showing the brain's connections to different areas of the body. An example is the cortical homunculus of the primary motor cortex and the somatosensory cortex, which are separated by the central sulcus. The diagram starts in the longitudinal fissure and continues out laterally from the center of the brain, representing the general pattern from lower extremities and genitals in the fissure up to the hands and face on outer edges of the brain. =Motor Mapping= Functional testing of movement during cortical stimulation includes looking for active movement and inhibition of movement. When the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe is stimulated, specific muscles in the body will contract based on the location of the brain that receives the electric signal. Stimulation on one side of the brain will cause a contraction on the contralateral, or opposite, side of the body. More recent studies using CSM have shown that the motor cortex is more complex than the arrangement pictured traditional homunculus, and that motor responses occur in the frontal lobe further away from the narrow strip next to the central sulcus. Areas of the cortex that inhibit movement upon stimulation have been found in some cases to be supplemental and not vital to motor function. These areas have been removed without compromising a patient's ability to move post-operation. =Language Mapping= During stimulation various language tasks are used to check brain function such as reading sentences, auditory comprehension, and spontaneous speech such as naming objects. Cortical stimulation in language areas of the brain typically tests for the inhibition of some language capability, rather than a defined motor or sensory response. This can make language mapping require more complex language-related tasks to be assessed during testing, in order to determine if the site that is stimulated is essential to a certain language ability. Language mapping is normally done in the left hemisphere of the brain where most language areas are located, such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas. Cortical stimulation mapping has also identified a language area in the basal temporal cortex that was previously unknown. Cortical stimulation mapping in patients with epilepsy has shown that critical language areas of the brain vary greatly in patients, highlighting the need to perform accurate mapping prior to surgeries in language areas. Traditional landmarks such as Broca's and Wernicke's areas cannot be relied on to distinguish essential language cortex. Rather, experiments that have tested for vital language sites are variable, and the exact role of a specific cortex area in a language task is difficult to judge. A further complication is that many patients who have undergone language mapping have epilepsy and it is possible this causes changes in language sites. Since the procedure is so invasive, cortical stimulation mapping for language organization is not done on healthy individuals. Additionally the distribution and abundance of specific task-related language sites have shown variation based on IQ and gender. =Somatosensory mapping= Somatosensory mapping involves measuring electrical responses on the surface of the brain as the result of the stimulation of peripheral nerves, such as mechanoreceptors that respond to pressure on the skin, and stimulating the brain directly to map sensory areas. Sensation has been tested in patients through the stimulation of the postcentral gyrus, with a drop in amplitude of sensory responses occurring towards the central sulcus. Clinical Applications =Epilepsy= CSM is an effective treatment for focal epilepsy and bilateral or multiple seizure foci. It is an effective treatment option when resective surgery to remove the affected area is not an option, generally seen with bilateral or multiple seizure foci. CSM is routinely utilized for patients with epilepsy in order to pin point the focal point of the seizures. It is used once there is a testable hypothesis regarding brain location for the epileptogenic zone, determined through a less invasive procedure, electroencephalography. Once the focal point of the seizures is determined, this information allows aids neurosurgeons with knowing what portions of the brain could potentially be resected without any negative post-operative neurological deficits. CSM will be considered for a patient with epilepsy when two conditions are met: the trial of anti-epileptic drugs has not controlled seizures and there is a likelihood that the surgery will benefit the patient. Due to the nature of the procedure, CSM is only utilized after noninvasive procedures have not been able to fully localize and treat the patient. The invasive electrodes are stereotaxically placed electrodes or a subdural strip or grid electrode. Utilizing the information obtained through CSM, limited resection of epileptogenic brain can be performed. For focal epilepsy, resective surgery is one of the mainstay treatment options for medication resistant epilepsy. Through the technique of CSM, generally using awake craniotomies, the neurosurgeon has the ability to monitor the functioning of the patient during the resection and stimulation of the brain. =Neuro-Oncology= Cortical stimulation mapping may be used in neuro-oncology as a tool to identify the areas of a patient's brain that are critical for functions such as the language and motor pathways. This procedure is considered standard for operations involving gliomas in order to reduce loss of motor function and overall morbidity. Pre-surgical planning allows for the physician to avoid these high-risk areas as much as possible during a tumor resection, minimizing potential loss of function and development of sequelae. Patients whose surgeon uses cortical stimulation mapping to assess the anatomy and function of rolandic areas have a greater chance and faster rate of regaining baseline function post-operatively than those who undergo surgeries that avoid this technique. The same may be said for the benefits of mapping language areas with the cortical stimulation technique before a glioma resection. Assessing and minimizing the damage of operating on language-involved regions leads to the greater and faster return of overall language function. Despite the functional gain from preserving these eloquent cortical areas, benefit-to-risk factors are still considered. More complete tumor resection has been shown to possibly expand the life expectancy of glioma patients; however, increasing the amount of brain tissue removed may also cause a debilitating decrease in function. As such, cortical stimulation mapping aids in determining the maximum amount of tissue that can be removed while still maintaining the patient's quality of life. =Vision= Mapping of the occipital cortex has possible use in the development of a prosthesis for the blind. Electrical stimulation in the occipital lobe has been found to cause visual illusions called phosphenes such as light, colors, or shadows, which were observed in the early experiments of Penfield and Jasper . The first recorded production of artificial sight was in experiments done by Brindley and Dobelle, where they were able to allow blind patients to 'see' small characters through cortical stimulation. Electrical stimulation in the occipital lobe has also been known to produce small colored circles usually in the center of the patient's field of vision. Visual hallucinations, such as moving geometric patterns and moving colored phosphenes have also been observed with cortical stimulation. Electrodes at the occipital cortex surface tend to produce flickering phosphenes, while electrodes inserted deeper within the cortex produce steady colors. The primary visual cortex, which is responsible for generating more complex images, is located deeper within the calcarine fissure of the occipital lobe, so intracortical stimulation is needed to stimulate these areas effectively. Intracortical stimulation uses an electrode that goes deeper into the brain to more effectively stimulate the primary visual cortex, as opposed to trying to work only from the surface of the brain, which can cause unintended visual signals, pain, and damage to the nervous tissue. For patients with glaucoma and optic nerve atrophy, existing retinal prostheses are not an option since the optic nerve is damaged, therefore a prosthesis using cortical stimulation is a remaining hope to offer some vision function. A cortical visual prosthesis is a promising subject of research because it targets neurons past the site of disease in most blind patients. However, significant challenges remain such as reproducibility in different patients, long-term effects of electrical stimulation, and the higher complexity of visual organization in the primary visual cortex versus that in the retina. Another site of research for a vision prosthesis using cortical stimulation is the optic nerve itself, which contains the nerve fibers responsible for the complete visual field. Research is still ongoing in this area and the small size of the optic nerve and the high density of nerve fibers are continuing challenges to this approach =Cortical stimulation mapping vs. transcranial magnetic stimulation = Cortical stimulation mapping (CSM) is considered the gold standard for mapping functional regions of the brain to create a presurgical plan that maximizes the patient's functional outcome. The history of beneficial outcomes and the amount of information already established about the CSM technique makes it advantageous in clinical and research applications. However, because it has the drawback of being an intraoperative technique, there is growing debate about its status as the preferred method. Instead, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a new procedure that does not carry the same amount of surgical risk, is being considered. Transcranial magnetic stimulation has been gaining increasing interest as an alternative tool for studying the relationships between specific cortical areas and brain function, particularly because its non-invasive nature is advantageous over CSM. Additionally, because of the increasing body of research focused on investigating the many medical uses of TMS, it could eventually have more applications than CSM. For example, this procedure been successfully used to measure the speed of conduction in central motor pathways, making it a useful tool for those studying multiple sclerosis. Similarly, TMS is also being researched for its possibilities as a long-term and possibly more cost- effective therapeutic alternative for treating chronic psychiatric disorders such as major depression as well as its use as a means of in aiding in stroke recovery. However, although therapeutic TMS is promising overall, its success is still unclear and has not been upheld in a number of studies. This is true relating to studies of Parkinson's patients who were given long-term TMS therapy. Although it initially appeared as if these subjects gained improved performance in motor coordination tests, these results are inconsistently reproducible. The same type of results are seen in studies in schizophrenia where it has been shown that cognitive performance in schizophrenic patients treated with TMS is highly variable. Such results suggest that evidence of the effects of TMS are lacking and this technique’s neurobiological mechanisms are still not well understood. Because of these uncertainties, research on this method is ongoing and much is still to be determined about its exact effect on the activation state of the brain. Comparatively, CSM, having the advantages of the more researched technique, is often still preferred. Safety must also be considered with respect to both methods. So far, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines have only approved the use of TMS for the treatment of depression. Although this technique has no known lasting side effects except for a few reported cases of induced seizures, it is still treated with caution due to its relative novelty in clinical use. CSM has gained U.S. FDA approval for its uses regarding cortical stimulation mapping, especially in cases of seizure and glioma treatments, and for aiding in the placement of electrodes within the brain.

The younger David Poe, on the other hand, defied his family's wishes to become a lawyer and became an actor instead. In 1806, David Jr. married the English- born Elizabeth \\"Eliza\\" Arnold Hopkins, whose first husband, Charles Hopkins, had died six months before. Poe was considered an inferior actor compared to his wife, possibly due to stage fright. One critic said of Eliza and David, \\"the lady was young and pretty, and evinced talent both as a singer and actress; the gentleman was literally nothing.\\" The couple's eldest child, William Henry Leonard Poe, was born in Boston, Massachusetts on January 30, 1807, nine months after their wedding.

He was credited for rebuilding the city of Luoyang from utter destruction from the warfares in the late Tang period into a prosperous city.  During Tang Dynasty  = Background and service under Huang Chao = Zhang Quanyi was born in 852, during the reign of Emperor Xuānzong. His biography in the History of the Five Dynasties indicated that he was originally named Zhang Juyan, and his biography in the New History of the Five Dynasties indicated that he was originally named Zhang Yan.New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 45. His family was from Linpu (臨濮, in modern Heze, Shandong), and both his grandfather Zhang Lian () and father Zhang Cheng () were farmers. Zhang Quanyi himself served as a farm inspector for the Linpu County government, but in his service was often insulted by the county magistrate. Therefore, when, late in the Qianfu era (874-879) of Emperor Xuānzong's grandson Emperor Xizong, when the region was overrun by the major agrarian rebel Huang Chao, Zhang joined Huang's army. After Huang captured the Tang imperial capital Chang'an and forced Emperor Xizong to flee to Chengdu around the new year 881, Huang established a new state of Qi with himself as emperor.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 254. Zhang served in Huang's government as the minister of civil service affairs (吏部尚書, Libu Shangshu) and the director of transportation. = Service under Zhuge Shuang and Zhuge Zhongfang = After Huang Chao was eventually defeated by Tang forces and chased out of Chang'an, Zhang Quanyi joined the army of the Tang general Zhuge Shuang the military governor (Jiedushi) of Heyang Circuit (河陽, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). He distinguished himself serving under Zhuge, and Zhuge eventually made him the prefect of Ze Prefecture (澤州, in modern Jincheng, Shanxi). Zhuge died in 886. Zhang and another officer of Zhuge's, Liu Jing (), supported Zhuge's son Zhuge Zhongfang () as acting military governor. Liu, however, controlled the governance of the circuit, drawing resentment from other officers. Late in 886, Liu became suspicious of the officer Li Hanzhi, and he decided to use Luoyang as a base to launch a surprise attack on Li's base at Minchi (澠池, in modern Luoyang). Li defeated him, however, forcing him to abandon Luoyang and flee north of the Yellow River back to the circuit capital Heyang. Li gave chase, and was about to chase the Yellow River, when Liu sent Zhang to try to stop Li. However, as Zhang also resented Liu's hold on the circuit governance, he instead joined Li, and they jointly attacked Heyang but could not capture it. They then withdrew to Huai Prefecture (懷州, in modern Luoyang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 256. As this Heyang Circuit internecine confrontation was going on, the former Tang general Qin Zongquan, who had declared himself emperor at Fengguo Circuit (奉國, headquartered in modern Zhumadian, Henan), sent his general Sun Ru toward Heyang, and Sun soon captured the city. Zhuge Zhongfang fled to Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan). Sun thereafter claimed the title of military governor of Heyang. However, Zhang and Li occupied Huai and Ze Prefectures, respectively, and resisted Sun. After Qin thereafter suffered a major defeat at the hands of Xuanwu's military governor Zhu Quanzhong, Sun withdrew from Heyang. Zhang and Li rejoined forces, with Li taking over Heyang and Zhang taking over Luoyang; they then jointly sought aid from the major warlord Li Keyong the military governor of Hedong Circuit (河東, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Li Keyong sent his officer An Jinjun () to take over Ze Prefecture as prefect and to aid Li Hanzhi and Zhang; he also commissioned Li Hanzhi as the military governor of Heyang and Zhang as the mayor of Henan Municipality (河南, i.e., Luoyang).Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 257. = As vassal of Li Hanzhi/Li Keyong = At the time that Zhang Quanyi took over as the mayor of Henan, it was said by historical accounts that the city had been laid waste by the wars, with the remnants of the population gathered within three castles of the city, totaling less than 100 households. Zhang set up his headquarters at one of those castles, Zhongzhou (), while selecting 18 capable officers and sending them out to the 18 counties of the municipality other than the two in the city center, to be in charge of rebuilding their counties and welcoming the refugee population back. He simplified the laws, making murder the only capital offense, while the other offenses were punishable only by caning; he also exempted the people from taxes. As a result, the refugee population returned in droves, and he trained them in the military arts so that they could defend themselves. Within a few years, the city recovered to appearing to be like the old days before the wars, and the fields were no longer fallow, but filled with mulberries and hemp. It was said that the larger counties were capable of producing 7,000 soldiers, and the smaller counties 2,000. It was said that Zhang governed with intelligence and that his subordinates could not deceive him. He rewarded the households that was particularly good at farming wheat or sericulture with clothes and tea. Under his rule, Henan became a rich city again. Meanwhile, Zhang initially had a cordial relationship with Li Hanzhi, whose Heyang Circuit his Henan Municipality belonged to, and they even cut their own arms to swear to be brothers. However, Li Hanzhi viewed Zhang's promotion of farming lightly. He also made a habit of making all kinds of material demands on Zhang, to the point that whenever he was not satisfied with what Zhang supplied his army, he would arrest Zhang's subordinates and cane them. Initially, Zhang put on the appearance of fearing Li Hanzhi and doing everything to appease him. In 888, when Li Hanzhi was on a campaign against the army of Huguo Circuit (護國, headquartered in modern Yuncheng, Shanxi), Huguo's military governor Wang Chongying sent secret emissaries to persuade Zhang to turn against Li Hanzhi. Zhang agreed, and he launched a surprise attack on Heyang at night, capturing it and taking Li Hanzhi's household captive. He then claimed the title of military governor of Heyang for himself. = As vassal of Zhu Quanzhong = Li Hanzhi fled to Ze Prefecture and sought aid from Li Keyong. Li Keyong sent his officer Kang Junli, commanding five other officers (Li Cunxiao, Xue Atan (), Shi Yan (), An Jinjun, and An Xiuxiu () to aid Li Hanzhi in trying to recapture Heyang. They put Heyang under siege, and the food supplies ran out. Zhang Quanyi thus sent his wife and children to Zhu Quanzhong as hostages to seek aid from him. Zhu sent his officers Ding Hui, Ge Congzhou, and Niu Cunjie () to aid Zhang. They defeated the Hedong forces, and then postured to cut off the Hedong forces' return path to Hedong through the Taihang Mountains. In fear, Kang took his army and withdrew. Zhu commissioned Ding the acting military governor of Heyang and recommissioned Zhang as the mayor of Henan. It was said that because Zhang was appreciative of Zhu's saving his life, he never had any thoughts of turning against Zhu from this point on, and he plenteously supplied Zhu's army in Zhu's subsequent campaigns. Soon thereafter, Henan was turned into its own circuit (Youguo ()), and then- reigning Emperor Zhaozong (Emperor Xizong's brother and successor) commissioned Zhang its military governor. In 890, when the imperial government, at the request of Zhu's and that of Li Kuangwei the military governor of Lulong Circuit (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing, declared a general campaign against Li Keyong, Zhang led an army to participate in Zhu's operation, along with Ge and Zhu's son Zhu Youyu (), to wrest Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi) from Li Keyong's control. The campaign, however, eventually ended in failure when Li Keyong's main forces crushed the imperial forces commanded by the chancellor Zhang Jun, and Li Keyong was able to retain Zhaoyi at that point. Later in the year, Zhang received the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 258. In 892, after Zhu, for reasons unclear to history, requested that then-military governor of Heyang, Zhao Keyu (), be demoted, Zhang was made the military governor of Heyang, in addition to Youguo.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 259. (However, at some point, Ding was made acting military governor of Heyang again, and in 899 was made full military governor.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 261. In 896, by which time Emperor Zhaozong had fled to Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Weinan, Shaanxi), which was then governed by Han Jian, due to attacks on Chang'an by Li Maozhen the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (鳳翔, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), Zhu Quanzhong and Zhang were submitted repeated joint petitions for the emperor to move the capital to Luoyang. In fear, Li Maozhen apologized to the emperor, repaired the palace and office buildings at Chang'an, and welcomed Emperor Zhaozong back to Chang'an.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 260. In 898, Emperor Zhaozong bestowed the greater honorary chancellor title of Shizhong on Zhang. In 900, when the eunuch Liu Jishu briefly overthrew Emperor Zhaozong in a coup and replaced him with his son Li Yu, Prince of De the Crown Prince, Zhang Jun, who had by that point retired to Changshui (), one of the counties of Henan, went to meet with Zhang Quanyi to encourage him and the other military governors to start a campaign to restore Emperor Zhaozong. There was no record of any actual action taken by Zhang Quanyi. (However, in 901, Emperor Zhaozong was restored in a countercoup headed by the imperial guard officers Sun Dezhao (), Dong Yanbi (), and Zhou Chenghui (). Shortly after, Zhang Quanyi was given the honorary chancellor title of Zhongshu Ling ().Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 262. By 903, Zhu Quanzhong had taken Emperor Zhaozong under his control, and was planning on eventually usurping the Tang throne. He feared that Zhang Jun would again encourage the military governors to attack him. He thus ordered Zhang Quanyi to kill Zhang Jun. Zhang Quanyi sent his officer Yang Lin () to take a group of soldiers, disguised as bandits, to attack Zhang Jun's mansion and slaughter his household. Only Zhang Jun's son Zhang Ge escaped the slaughter. Subsequently, Zhu Quanzhong destroyed Chang'an and moved Emperor Zhaozong to Luoyang. He then moved Zhang Quanyi to be the military governor of Tianping Circuit (天平, headquartered in modern Tai'an, Shandong.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. He also had Zhang created the Prince of Dongping. In 904, by which point Zhu had assassinated Emperor Zhaozong and replaced him with his son Li Zuo the Prince of Hui (as Emperor Ai), Zhang Quanyi was again made the mayor of Henan; he was additionally also made the military governor of Zhongwu Circuit (忠武, headquartered in modern Weinan), apparently commanding it remotely, and the overall commander of the imperial guards.Zizhi Tongjian, 265.  During Later Liang  = During Emperor Taizu's reign = In 907, Zhu Quanzhong had Emperor Ai yield the throne to him, ending Tang and starting a new Later Liang as its Emperor Taizu.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 266. He made Zhang Quanyi the military governor of Heyang, in addition to being the mayor of Henan, again, and created him the Prince of Wei. Soon thereafter, he changed Zhang Quanyi's name to Zhang Zongshi, apparently due to naming taboo as his own name included the character \\"Quan.\\" In 908, in addition to his other offices, Zhang was also made Taibao () and the military governor of Zhenguo Circuit (鎮國, headquartered in modern Sanmenxia, Henan). In 910, he was additionally made the military governor of Xuanyi Circuit (宣義, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan. In 911, Emperor Taizu spent the summer at Zhang's summer mansion. He used the opportunity to have sexual relations with virtually every woman in Zhang's household. Zhang's son Zhang Jizuo (), humiliated, wanted to assassinate the emperor. Zhang Zongshi pointed out that it was because of Emperor Taizu's initially stopping Li Hanzhi's attack that the Zhang household was preserved, and he managed to persuade Zhang Jizuo not to carry out the assassination.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 268. (According to Zhang's biography in the New History of the Five Dynasties, the women that Emperor Taizu had sexual relations with included even Zhang Zongshi's wife Lady Chu and his daughters.) = During Zhu Yougui's and Zhu Zhen's reigns = In 912, Emperor Taizu was assassinated by his son Zhu Yougui the Prince of Ying, who took the throne thereafter. As part of the governmental reorganization that took place after Zhu Yougui took the throne, he disbanded the headquarters for financial matters at the eastern capital Kaifeng (which previously had been the headquarters of Xuanwu Circuit while Zhu Quanzhong governed it), which Emperor Taizu had created and had named Jianchang Palace (). The responsibility of overseeing the financial matters was transferred to Zhang Zongshi. Zhang was also made the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (whose headquarters had been moved to modern Shangqiu, Henan by that point). In 913, Zhu Yougui's younger brother Zhu Youzhen the Prince of Jun overthrew him and took the throne, and subsequently moved the capital from Luoyang to Kaifeng, but it appeared that Zhang remained in charge of the financial matters of the state. In 917, Zhu Youzhen (who had changed his name to Zhu Zhen) further bestowed on Zhang the title of Deputy Generalissimo of All Circuits (). (The Generalissimo title belonged to Qian Liu the Prince of Wuyue, whose state was a Later Liang vassal state.)Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 270. In 921, Zhu Zhen, suspicious of the intentions of the major general Liu Xun, who had sought retirement, approved Liu's retirement and had him reside at Luoyang. He then ordered Zhang to poison Liu to death.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 271. In 923, Zhu Zhen, with the territory of his Later Liang state north of the Yellow River gradually taken piece by piece by his rival Li Cunxu the Prince of Jin (Li Keyong's son and successor), planned a major counterattack. At the recommendation of his close associates Zhao Yan and Zhang Hanjie (), he made the general Duan Ning, whose military abilities was not respected by the army, the overall commander of the operations. Zhang Zongshi, knowing that Duan was not the appropriate commander and that the army generals were more respectful of another general, Wang Yanzhang, submitted a petition stating:Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 272. Despite Zhang's petition (and similar remarks made by the chancellor Jing Xiang), Zhu Zhen continued to leave Duan in command. Subsequently, before Duan could start his operations, Li Cunxu made a surprise maneuver across the Yellow River around Duan's army, and directly attacked Kaifeng. Zhu Zhen, unable to resist and unable to flee, committed suicide. Li Cunxu, who had by that point declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, Later Tang (as its Emperor Zhuangzong), and claimed to be the legitimate successor to Tang, entered Kaifeng and took over virtually all of the Later Liang territory.  During Later Tang  The Later Liang military governors, including Zhang Zongshi, largely immediately submitted to the Later Tang emperor. In winter 923, Zhang went to Kaifeng to pay homage to Emperor Zhuangzong, and he changed his name back to Quanyi. He submitted a large amount of money and horses as tribute. Emperor Zhuangzong had his son Li Jiji and brother Li Cunji () honor Zhang as an older brother. Subsequently, when Emperor Zhuangzong considered opening up the tomb of Emperor Taizu of Later Liang, Zhang, still grateful to Emperor Taizu for his survival, submitted a petition stating that while the two states were rivals, such an action at this point would be meaningless and would merely show Emperor Zhuangzong to be vengeful. Emperor Zhuangzong agreed and did not do so, although he still destroyed the memorials built for Emperor Taizu on his tomb. Soon thereafter, at Zhang's suggestion, Emperor Zhuangzong moved the capital to Luoyang. He bestowed on Zhang the title of Shangshu Ling (). He also changed Zhang's princely title to Prince of Qi. In 924, Emperor Zhuangzong and his wife Empress Liu visited Zhang's mansion for a feast. At the feast, Empress Liu, claiming that she lost her parents in her youth and that she missed having parents, asked to treat Zhang as her father. Zhang, in fear, initially declined, but eventually accepted. Thereafter, Empress Liu and he often sent messengers back and forth, and he submitted much tribute to her.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 273. In 926, Emperor Zhuangzong, who had alienated his soldiers due to his failure to properly reward them for their contributions during his campaigns, was facing a mutiny by the Weibo Circuit (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) army. He initially sent the general Li Shaorong to try to suppress the rebellion, but Li Shaorong was unable to do so. Zhang, instead, recommended the senior general, and Emperor Zhuangzong's adoptive brother, Li Siyuan. Upon Li Siyuan's arrival at Weibo, however, his own soldiers mutinied and forced Li Siyuan to join the Weibo soldiers in the rebellion. Li Siyuan subsequently led his army south, toward Kaifeng. When Zhang heard this, he became fearful as he was the one who had recommended Li Siyuan, and he stopped eating. He died soon thereafter.

He lives in Hrodna, Belarus. A correspondent for the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza, Poczobut has been arrested more than a dozen times by the government of Belarus. In 2011, he was sentenced to a fine and fifteen days in prison for \\"participation in the unsanctioned protest rally\\" following the 2010 presidential election. In 2011 and 2012, he was arrested and detained for allegedly libeling President Alexander Lukashenko in his reports. The charges against Poczobut received international condemnation, with groups including the European Parliament, Reporters Without Borders, and Amnesty International issuing statements in his support. Background He worked as a journalist for several Belarusian media - Den', Narodnaja Volia, Głos znad Niemna and Magazyn Polski. He also works as a correspondent for the Polish newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza. He is one of the leaders of the Union of Poles in Belarus.  Protest arrest  On 19 December 2010, Belarus held a disputed presidential election in which President Alexander Lukashenko was elected to a fourth term, which resulted in widespread opposition protests. On 12 January 2011, the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (KGB) arrested Poczobut for \\"participation in the unsanctioned protest rally\\". He was fined 1.75 million Belarusian rubles (US$580) the following day. The KGB also raided his house and confiscated his computer and documents. Andrzej argued that he was acting as a journalist during the rally. On 11 February, he was tried a second time for the same charge, and given a sentence of fifteen days in prison. Jerzy Buzek, president of the European Parliament, demanded his release. The US-based Committee to Protect Journalists also protested on his behalf, stating that the organization was \\"outraged that Andrzej Poczobut was not only convicted on a trumped-up charge but that he has now been given jail time after already receiving a sentence of a fine\\". In March 2011 the Belarusian government told him that if he did not stop reporting on the administration of Alexander Lukashenko, he would be prosecuted. His accreditation from the Belarus Ministry of Foreign Affairs was revoked. He argued that his work is protected by his constitutional rights.  2011-2012 libel charges  Poczobut was arrested again on 6 April 2011, this time on libel charges. The charges stemmed from ten reports about the president Poczobut had published on his blog, in Gazeta Wyborcza, and on the website Belaruspartisan.org. The Union of Poles in Belarus campaigned on Poczobut's behalf, calling for his release. Another Polish journalist, Ihar Bantsar, was sentenced to five days in prison for covering the trial. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), reporters for Reuters and the Associated Press were assaulted by plainclothes police officers when attempting to photograph Poczobut entering the courthouse. On 5 July 2011, he was found guilty and given a suspended three- year prison sentence. Poczobut attributed the suspension of his sentence to international pressure, including a statement on his behalf by the EU. Amnesty International also denounced Poczobut's prosecution and named him a prisoner of conscience. RSF called for his conviction to be overturned, calling him \\"a -watched victim of President Lukashenko's persecution of journalists\\". Poczobut appealed the verdict, but lost the appeal on 20 September. In November 2011, the Polish radio station Radio ZET awarded him its Andrzej Wojciechowski prize for his journalism. Because Poczobut was forbidden to leave Belarus, his wife accepted the award on his behalf. On 21 June 2012, he was arrested in Grodno on another charge of libel against the president, this time for a story criticizing the government's handling of the 2011 Minsk Metro bombing for the independent news site Charter 97. The charge carried a maximum sentence of five years' imprisonment. Poczobut was released on bail after a week in detention, but was told a trial against him would still be forthcoming. The European Parliament adopted a resolution urging that the charges against Pozcobut be dropped. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk summoned the Belarusian ambassador to object to the libel case, and stated that he also had the backing of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. RSF again protested the charges, describing Poczobut as \\"hounded because of his determination to work as an independent reporter\\", and Amnesty International called for the charges to be dropped. PEN American Center also appealed on his behalf, urging the Belarusian government \\"to drop all charges against Pozcobut immediately, and to uphold their obligations to protect freedom of expression for all citizens as guaranteed by Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\\"  Personal life  Poczobut is married to Aksana Poczobut. He has a daughter (born c. 2001) and a son (born February 2011).

This technology is currently being used by both private and commercial aircraft pilots.  History and testing  The iPad has been used in General Aviation in conjunction with its paper backup counterpart, which is mandated by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). There are many applications available which include everything that would be on the paper charts plus aviation tools including navigation charts, taxi procedures, weather maps, GPS, Minimum Equipment List, Company Policy Manual, Federal Aviation Regulations and flight controls. Although these tools have been used in the private sector, the use of the iPad in commercial aviation is just taking flight. The Federal Aviation Administration finished a three-month testing project which included putting the device through adverse conditions such as rapid decompression testing and tests to make sure the tablet did not interfere with the avionic equipment. Early in 2011 the FAA authorized charter company Executive Jet Management to use iPad records without the backup paper charts. This helps make way for the iPad to become an aviation instrument for the rest of the industry. Alaska Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and American Airlines planned test programs.  Practicality  The main motive to use the iPad as a navigation tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include aircraft flight manuals, approach plates, navigation charts, policy manuals, minimum equipment list and taxi charts. Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates to a lot of paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy flight bag. It would be replaced by the 9.5 inch by 7.31 inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of kneeboards. Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier. Apple iPad  Safety  The iPad brings several safety advantages into the cockpit. First is the currency and completeness of the charts. Paper chart revisions are issued every two weeks. A pilot can easily misfile a paper chart, remove the wrong one or forget to file the chart altogether by the time of the flight occurs. An outdated or misplaced chart can increase the possibility of accidents. Secondly, carrying the 40+ pound kitbag that holds all of the navigation charts is a cause of personal injuries of the pilots themselves. According to Patrick O’Keeffe, American Airlines’s vice president of Airline Operations Technology, “[American Airlines has] reduced the single biggest source of pilot injuries: carrying those packs.” The iPad also allows for a decrease of clutter in the cockpit. This leads to a safer flight for the pilot and passengers. Pilots need not spread out the large charts in the small cockpit, hence they don't obstruct the view. Pilots can quickly swipe their fingers around the chart as well as switch charts in matter of seconds. This give pilots more time to look out the cockpit window and allows them to be able to just take a glance instead of searching around on a map. A number of potential issues have been brought up including distractions in the cockpit, but the iPads are prohibited from being used for non-flight purposes and pilots are still using onboard GPS instruments. Other potential safety issues included application failure and system failure, but in the three-month test Executive Jet Management conducted, not once did the application shut off or have a failure. Tests did show that if a failure did take place the program could reboot in four to six seconds. Extra iPads in the cockpit are also being talked about as a backup to a system failure. Airlines are also looking into the safety of the placement of the iPads in the cockpit. The most popular placement is on a pilot's kneeboard, a strap that connects to the pilot's upper thigh and makes the device hands free, but many commercial airlines are looking into a dock that is connected to the plane itself.

The Zorig Foundation seeks to spread democratic values in Mongolian society; strengthen human rights, and social justice; as well as improve the system of transparency and accountability of the government to the public. In order to meet the above objectives, the Zorig Foundation concentrates its programs in three areas: Youth and Education, Good Governance, and Community Building. Early history Zorig Sanjaasuren (Mongolian: Санжаасүрэнгийн Зориг, 20 April 1962 – 2 October 1998) was a prominent Mongolian politician and leader of the country's 1990 democratic revolution.Rossabi, Morris.

After his death, his sister Oyun entered politics and founded the Civil Will Party along with the Zorig Foundation. Mission The foundation aims to spread democratic values in the society, strengthening human rights, freedom and social justice, and promoting transparency. The foundation identifies three broad areas of focus in order to complete the principal objectives aforementioned. The areas are Good Governance, Youth and Education, and Community Development.

History Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959. At the same time, the portion of Chopra PS lying to the north of the Mahananda river covering an area that now comprises Bidhannagar-1 gram panchayat, Bidhannagar-2 GP, Chathat-Bansgaon GP and the southern half of Phansidewa-Bansgaon Kismat GP in Darjeeling district, was transferred from West Dinajpur to the jurisdiction of Phansidewa PS in Darjeling district. With the introduction of the Community Development Programme in 1960-61, community development blocks were set up in West Dinajpur district. In 1992, West Dinajpur district was bifurcated and Uttar Dinajpur district was established. Geography Kaliaganj is located at . Uttar Dinajpur district has a flat topography and slopes gently from north to south. All rivers flow in that direction. Except for the eastern fringes of Chopra CD Block, most of the district is a part of the catchment area of the Mahanada and also a part of the larger Barind Tract. The soil is composed of different varieties of alluvium. The main rivers are: Nagar, Mahananda, Kulik, Gamari, Chhiramati (Srimati) and Tangon. The rivers have little water in the dry season but with heavy rains, during monsoon, overflow the banks. The Tangon river flows through the upper portion of western part of Kaliaganj CD Block. The Chhiramati river touches the south-eastern edge of the CD Block and the Gamari river touches the south-western edge of Kaliaganj CD Block. Approximately 206 km of the India-Bangladesh border is in Uttar Dinajpur district. It covers the eastern boundary of the district. On the western side Uttar Dinajpur district has 227 km boundary with Bihar. Kaliaganj CD Block is bounded by Pirganj Upazila in Thakurgaon District and Bochaganj Upazila in Dinajpur district, both in Bangladesh, on the north, Biral Upazila in Dinajpur District of Bangladesh on the east, Kushmandi CD Block, in Dakshin Dinajpur, and Itahar CD Block on the south and Raiganj and Hemtabad CD Blocks on the west. Kaliaganj CD Block has an area of 301.90 km2.It has 1 panchayat samity, 8 gram panchayats, 148 gram sansads (village councils), 192 mouzas and 191 inhabited villages. Kaliaganj police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Kaliaganj. Uttar Dinajpur district is one of the smaller districts in the state and stands 15th in terms of area (3,140.00 km2) in the state. Gram panchayats of Kaliaganj block/ panchayat samiti are: Anantapur, Baruna, Bhandar, Bochadanga, Dhankoil, Malgaon, Mostafanagar and Radhikapur. Demographics =Population= As per the 2011 Census of India, Kaliaganj CD Block had a total population of 224,142, all of which were rural. There were 114,104 (51%) males and 109,038 (49%) females. Population below 6 years was 29,540. Scheduled Castes numbered 138,461 (61.77%) and Scheduled Tribes numbered 12,675 (5.65%).

Decadal Population Growth Rate (%) Note: The CD Block data for 1971-1981, 1981-1991 and 1991-2001 is for Kaliaganj PS covering the block The decadal growth of population in Kaliaganj CD Block in 2001-2011 was 17.96%. The decadal growth of population in Kaliaganj PS in 1991-2001 was 24.46%, in 1981-91 was 22.22% and in 1971-81 was 25.62%. The decadal growth rate of population in Uttar Dinajpur district was as follows: 30.2% in 1971-81, 34.0% in 1981-91, 28.7% in 1991-2001 and 23.2% in 2001-11. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93% in 2001-2011, 17.77% in 1991-2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971-1981. Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal population growth rate in West Bengal with a figure of 23.2% for the decade 2001-2011 and is much higher than the state average of 13.8%. According to the Human Development Report for Uttar Dinajpur district, population growth in the area that later became Uttar Dinajpur district was low in the pre-independence era. Between 1911-1931, Kaliaganj PS with its railway town had been the most densely settled area in the district, but was surpassed by Itahar PS in 1941, and by both Raiganj PS and Itahar PS in 1951. Population growth started picking up with the waves of East Bengali refugees coming in from erstwhile East Pakistan. The Human Development Report analyses, \\"A spurt in population growth rates first became evident between 1951-1961, and was further magnified between 1971-81 after the creation of Bangladesh when population growth in most districts bordering the Bangladesh-West Bengal frontier showed similar escalation. However, after 1981, when population growth in most other West Bengal districts had tapered off, growth rates in Uttar Dinajpur again showed a fresh spurt. Thus, no deceleration in population growth rates occurred in the district until after 1991… In addition to Hindu and tribal migrants from across the international border, a sizeable number of migrant Muslims have also settled in the district, mainly driven by economic reasons… migrants from other states comprised 23% of the total migrants residing in Uttar Dinajpur.\\" The large number of migrants from other states is mainly from the neighbouring areas in Bihar. A study by North Bengal University has observed that \\"Immigrants from East Pakistan/Bangladesh have arrived in Uttar Dinajpur almost equal numbers before and after 1971.\\" The Human Development Report opines, \\"The overall post-Partition impact on the rates of demographic growth has been particularly strong in all North Bengal districts.

History Historically the western frontier of ancient Pundravardhana kingdom, bordering ancient Anga of Mahabharat fame, the Dinajpur area remained somewhat obscure in the major empires that held sway over the region and beyond till the rise of the Dinajpur Raj during the Mughal period. Some areas later forming a part of Uttar Dinajpur were parts of kingdoms in Nepal. Dinajpur district was constituted by the British in 1786, with a portion of the estate of Dinajpur Raj. Subsequent to the Permanent Settlement in 1793, the semi-independent Dinajpur Raj was further broken down and some of its tracts were transferred to the neighbouring British districts of Purnea, Malda, Rajshahi and Bogra. In 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed the Sadar and Thakurgaon subdivisions of Dinajpur district in East Pakistan. The Balurghat subdivision of Dinajpur district was reconstituted as West Dinajpur district in West Bengal. Raiganj subdivision was formed in 1948. In order to restore territorial links between northern and southern parts of West Bengal which had been snapped during the partition of Bengal, and on the recommendations of the States Reorganisation Commission a portion of the erstwhile Kishanganj subdivision comprising Goalpokhar, Islampur and Chopra thanas (police stations) and parts of Thakurganj thana, along with the adjacent parts of the erstwhile Gopalpur thana in Katihar subdivision were transferred from Purnea district in Bihar to West Bengal in 1956, and were formally incorporated into Raiganj subdivision in West Dinajpur. The township of Kishanganj and its entire municipal boundary remained within Bihar. Islampur subdivision was formed in March 1959.

Premise Juliette Cavazzi made early Canadian radio and television appearances on series such as Holiday Ranch. She was a regular on The Billy O'Connor Show from 1955 and inherited that show's time slot in 1956 following a dispute with O'Connor. The series opened with the tag line, \\"[n]ow let's meet, and greet, your pet. . .Ju-u-liette\\", as delivered by announcer Gil Christie. Juliette then greeted the audience saying, \\"Hi there, everybody.\\" Each episode proceeded with selections of current and past popular music then Juliette finished the programme with her phrase, \\"Good night, Mom.\\". Bobby Gimby was a regular performer during the series' initial years, joined by an \\"escort\\" or male vocalist. Other regular performers included the vocal groups The Four Romeos (1959–1965) and The Four Mice (1960–64). Player's cigarettes was a key show sponsor; series announcer Gil Christie also narrated the company's advertisements. Production The series was produced at CBC Toronto and was broadcast live. Its rehearsals were frequently conducted immediately prior to air time during Hockey Night in Canada. In 1957, each episode's production cost was $6000. Visiting artists included Eleanor Collins, Jack Jones, Marg Osborne and Earl Wrightson. Gino Silvi provided choral arrangements for the series. Significant changes were made for the final 1965–66 season. Bill Isbister, musical director since the program's debut, was replaced by Lucio Agostini. More attention was given to visiting artists and a new \\"This Week\\" segment was introduced to promote particular performers and their upcoming events. The Art Hallman Singers became regular performers. Scheduling This series was broadcast from 27 October 1956 to 18 June 1966, generally after the Saturday hockey broadcast and national newscast. Its first season's air time was 11:10 p.m. The cancellation of Juliette was made public by CBC on 7 April 1966, announcing that its star would move \\"into the field of one-hour specials\\". The time slot that September was replaced by the short-lived multicultural music series A World of Music. Meanwhile, Juliette was scheduled for at least two appearances in the 1966–67 season on the network's Show of the Week Monday broadcasts. Reception The series attracted substantial viewership, exceeding one million viewers per episode, retaining a large proportion of the ratings of the preceding hockey games. Juliette's performance style on the series was inoffensive, positive and informal. Globe and Mail columnist Dennis Braithwaite took a critical view of the programme's quality. When Juliette was cancelled in 1966, he noted the star's \\"real trouble has been her failure to grow as a performer\\" during the ten seasons. Braithwaite further felt the automatically high audience levels following the hockey broadcasts curtailed any incentive for creative production and improved program financing.

The exhibit was a joint effort between Daniel Murray, the Assistant Librarian of Congress, Thomas J. Calloway, a lawyer and the primary organizer of the exhibit, and W. E. B. Du Bois. The goal of the exhibition was to demonstrate progress and commemorate the lives of African Americans at the turn of the century.David Levering Lewis, \\"A Small Nation of People: W.E.B. Du Bois and Black Americans at the Turn of the Twentieth Century\\", A Small Nation of People: W. E. B. Du Bois and African American Portraits of Progress. New York: Amistad, 2003. 24–49. The exhibit included a statuette of Frederick Douglass, four bound volumes of nearly 400 official patents by African Americans, photographs from several educational institutions (Fisk University, Howard University, Roger Williams University, Tuskegee Institute, Claflin University, Berea College, North Carolina A&T;), an African-American bibliography by the Library of Congress containing 1,400 titles, and two social studies directed by W. E. B. Du Bois: \\"The Georgia Negro\\" (comprising 32 handmade graphs and charts), and a set of about 30 statistical graphics on the African-American population made by Du Bois's students at Atlanta University.Thomas Calloway, \\"The Negro Exhibit\\", in U.S. Commission to the Paris Exposition, Report of the Commissioner-General for the United States to the International Universal Exposition, Paris, 1900, Vol. 2 (Washington, D.C: Government Printing Office, 1901). Most memorably, the exhibit displayed some five hundred photographs of African-American men and women, homes, churches, businesses and landscapes including photographs from Thomas E. Askew. Founding Thomas Junius Calloway, an African-American lawyer and educator, sent a letter to over one hundred African-American representatives in various sections of the United States, including Booker T. Washington, to solicit help in advocating for an exhibit to present at the world's fair in Paris. The letter insists that, \\"thousands upon thousands will go [to the fair], and a well selected and prepared exhibit, representing the Negro's development in his churches, his schools, his homes, his farms, his stores, his professions and pursuits in general will attract attention... and do a great and lasting good in convincing thinking people of the possibilities of the Negro.\\" Washington appealed personally to President William McKinley and just four months before the opening of the Paris Exposition, Congress allocated $15,000 to fund the exhibit. Calloway enlisted Du Bois, with whom he had formerly been classmates at Fisk, and Daniel Murray, Assistant to the Librarian of Congress, to assemble materials. Du Bois included photographs that he called \\"typical Negro faces,\\" exemplifying the accomplishment and progress of African Americans.W. E. B. Du Bois, \\"The American Negro at Paris\\", American Review of Review (November 1900): 577. He compiled a set of three large albums of photographs, the photographer of which was never identified at the exhibit. Some were formal studio portraits, but there were also informal snapshots of groups of people, children playing in the streets, people working, family outings, images of houses and businesses and the interiors of homes.Anne Maxwell, Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870-1940. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press, 2008. 217–226. The exhibit was separate from United States national building, within the shared space of the Palace of Social Economy and Congresses with maps detailing U.S. resources, New York City tenement models, and information on labor unions, railroad pensions and libraries. It was displayed from April to November 1900 and over 50 million people passed through.David Levering Lewis, \\"A Small Nation of People: W.E.B. Du Bois and Black Americans at the Turn of the Twentieth Century\\", A Small Nation of People (2003), 14–23. Mainstream American newspapers generally ignored the existence of the Negro Exhibit, and the U.S. commissioner-general failed to mention the Negro Exhibit in his comprehensive article published in the North American Review. Still, the Negro Exhibit occupied one fourth of the total exhibition space allocated to the US in the multinational Palace of Social Economy and Congresses, and Black periodicals like The Colored American wrote extensively about the project. ;Current location Today the Exhibit of American Negroes is housed at the Library of Congress.

The crucifix of Ferdinand and Sancha () is an ivory carving from circa 1063, today in the National Archaeological Museum of Spain. It was part of an offering by King Ferdinand I of León and Queen Sancha to furnish the basilica of San Isidoro de León. It is the earliest known crucifix from Spain depicting the body of Christ. Although earlier Spanish crucifixes of gold, ivory and wood are known, they are all without images. The official inventory of the royal gift describes the crucifix as \\"a cross of ivory with the image of our crucified Redeemer\\".Gómez-Moreno (1947), 162. It measures 52 cm high, 34.5 cm wide, and 1 cm thick, with the width of the cross beams being 7 cm. The image of Christ is 305 mm tall. The figure of Christ is shown with its heading reclining to the left, its large eyes wide open and encrusted with jet, and sporting a beard and moustache. (Jet eyes were common at the time in ivory sculptures of the region.) Each foot is shown nailed individually to the cross. The fingers of Christ's right hand are missing. His perizonium (loin cloth) covers him to the knees and is tied at his waist. The legs and torso are perfectly vertical. There is a small space behind the body so the piece could serve as a reliquary, as was typical. On the obverse of the cross are intertwined images of plants and animals, and of humans either ascending to paradise or descending to hell. Above the image of Christ is the inscription: IHSNAZA RENUSREX IUDEORU which translates \\"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\\", the citation placed on the cross according to the Four Gospels. Above the inscription on the ivory is a representation of the resurrected Christ carrying a cross. At the base of the cross, below the crucified figure, is a figure of Adam, and below that the inscription: FREDINANDUSREX SANCIAREGINA indicating the commissioners of the work, King Ferdinand and Queen Sancha.

While early Palazzo style buildings followed the forms and scale of the Italian originals closely, by the late 19th century the style was more loosely adapted and applied to commercial buildings many times larger than the originals. The architects of these buildings sometimes drew their details from sources other than the Italian Renaissance, such as Romanesque and occasionally Gothic architecture. In the 20th century, the style was superficially applied, like the Gothic Revival style, to multi-storey buildings. In the late 20th and 21st century some Postmodern architects have again drawn on the Palazzo style for city buildings. History =Origins= Palazzo Farnese, Rome, 16th century The Palazzo style began in the early 19th century essentially as a revival style which drew, like Neoclassical architecture and Gothic Revival, upon archaeological styles of architecture, in this case the palaces of the Italian Renaissance. Italian palazzi, as against villas which were set in the countryside, were part of the architecture of cities, being built as town houses, the ground floor often serving as commercial premises. Early palazzi exist from the Romanesque and Gothic periods, but the definitive style dates from a period beginning in the 15th century, when many noble families had become rich on trade. Famous examples include the Palazzo Medici-Riccardi built by Michelozzo in Florence, the Palazzo Farnese built by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and completed by Michelangelo in Rome, and the Ca' Vendramin Calergi by Mauro Codussi and Ca'Grande by Jacopo Sansovino on the Grand Canal in Venice. =Early 19th century= The earliest true Renaissance Revival \\"Palazzo style\\" buildings in Europe were built by the German architect Leo von Klenze, who usually worked in the Greek Neoclassical style.Nikolaus Pevsner, An Outline of European Architecture, Penguin, (1964) The Palais Leuchtenberg (1816) is probably the first of several such buildings on the new Ludwigstrasse in Munich,James Stevens Curl, A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape, Oxford University, (2000), and has a rusticated half-basement and quoins, three storeys of windows with those of the second floor being pedimented, a large cornice and a shallow columned portico around the main door. The walls are stuccoed and painted like the Palazzo Farnese. The Travellers Club (1829) and The Reform Club (1830), Pall Mall, London, by Charles Barry In England, the earliest 19th-century application of the Palazzo style was to a number of London gentlemen's clubs. It was then applied to residences, both as town and, less commonly, country houses and to banks and commercial premises. In the late 19th century, the Palazzo style was adapted and expanded to serve as a major architectural form for department stores and warehouses. In England, the Palazzo style was at its purest in the second quarter of the 19th century. It was in competition with the Classical Revival style, which incorporated large pediments, colonnades and giant orders, lending a grandeur to public buildings as seen at the British Museum (1840s), and the more romantic Italianate and French Empire style in which much domestic architecture was built. Early examples are the London clubs, The Athenaeum Club by Decimus Burton (1824) and The United Service Club by John Nash and Decimus Burton (1828) on Waterloo Place and Pall Mall. In 1829 Barry initiated Renaissance Revival architecture in England with his Palazzo style design for The Travellers' Club, Pall Mall. While Burton and Nash's designs draw on English Renaissance models such as Inigo Jones' Banqueting House, Whitehall and the Queen's House, Greenwich, Barry's designs are conscientiously archaeological in reproducing the proportions and forms of their Italian Renaissance models. They are Florentine in style, rather than Palladian. Barry built a second palazzo on Pall Mall, The Reform Club, (1830s) as well as The Athenaeum, Manchester. Barry's other major essays in this style are the townhouse Bridgewater House, London, (1847–57) and the countryhouse Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, (1849–51).Banister Fletcher, A History of Architecture on the Comparative method (2001). Elsevier Science & Technology. After Charles Barry, the Palazzo style was adopted for different purposes, particularly banking. The Belfast Bank had its premises remodelled by Sir Charles Lanyon in 1845. No. 15 Kensington Palace Gardens (1854) by James Thomas Knowles freely adapts features of the palazzo. =1850s to 1900= The General Post Office Building, Sydney, by James Barnet is in the Venetian Renaissance style. 1866-80 A major 19th-century architect to work extensively in the Palazzo style was Edmund Blacket. Blacket arrived in Sydney, Australia, just a few years before the discovery of gold in NSW and Victoria in 1851. Within the next decade he built the head premises of six different banking companies in Sydney, as well as branches in country towns. In Sydney, these rare examples of Blacket's early Palazzo style architecture, all constructed from the local yellow Sydney sandstone were all demolished in the period from 1965–80, to make way for taller buildings.Joan Kerr, Our Great Victoria Architect, Edmund Thomas Blacket, 1817–1883, (1983) The National Trust of Australia, From the 1850s, a number of buildings were designed that expand the Palazzo style with its rustications, rows of windows, and large cornice, over very long buildings such as Grosvenor Terrace in Glasgow (1855) by J. T. Rochead and Watts Warehouse (Britannia House), Manchester, (1856) by Travis and Magnall, a \\"virtuoso performance\\" in Palazzo design.James Stevens Curl, Victorian Architecture, David & Charles, (1990). From the 1870s, many city buildings were designed to resemble Venetian rather than Florentine palazzi, and were more ornately decorated, often having arcaded loggias at street level, like James Barnet's General Post Office Building in Sydney, (1866 and 1880s). The Palazzo style was extremely popular in Manchester in the United Kingdom, particularly the work of Edward Walters, whose finest Palazzo works include the Free Trade Hall (1853) and 38 and 42 Mosley Street (1862). Marshall Field's Wholesale Store, (1885, lost 1930), Chicago, by Richardson The Palazzo style found wider application in the late 19th century when it was adapted for retail and commercial buildings. Henry Hobson Richardson designed a number of buildings using the Palazzo form but remarkable for employing the Italian Romanesque rather than Renaissance style. The largest and best known of such works was Marshall Field's Wholesale Store in Chicago (1885, demolished 1930) which, with its large windows set into arcades demonstrates the direction that commercial architecture was to take, in the replacement of structural outer walls with screen walls protecting an inner structural core.Helen Gardner, Art through the Ages, Harcourt, Brace and World, (1970) Only one of Richardson's palazzo style commercial buildings remains intact, the Hayden Building in Boston. The American architect Louis Sullivan pioneered steel-frame construction, meaning that both the floors and outer walls of a building were supported by an internal steel frame, rather than the structure of the walls. This technological development permitted the construction of much taller habitable buildings than was previously possible. Sullivan's Prudential (Guaranty) Building in Buffalo and the Wainwright Building in St. Louis demonstrate the application of the Palazzo style to tall structures, which maintain the Renaissance features of a cornice and differentiated basement but which have its cliff-like walls composed mainly of glass, the rows of windows separated by vertical bands, which also define corners of the building, giving a similar effect to quoins. =Early 20th century= The Reich Aviation Ministry Building, Berlin, (1935–36) by Ernst Sagebiel Palazzo style architecture remained common for large department stores through the first half of the 20th century, sometimes being given Art Deco details. The architects Starrett and van Vleck built several typical examples such as Gimbel Brothers (now Heinz 57 Center Sixth Avenue) in Pittsburgh in 1914, as well as Garfinckel's (now Hamilton Square) in Washington, D.C. in 1929. The latter building is eight storeys high, and has a pronounced course which juts like a cornice above the third level, a device that gives the lower parts of the building a more traditional Palazzo scale than the less decorated levels that rise above it. The 1924 flagship of Rich's, once one of Atlanta's main department stores, is another example of the Palazzo style.Library of Congress, photos of Rich's Department Store, 45 Broad Street, Atlanta The style was also applied to much taller buildings such as The Equitable Building (1915), designed by Ernest R. Graham, a 38-story office building in Lower Manhattan which is a landmark engineering achievement as a skyscraper. The 1930s saw the construction of a number of government buildings in Berlin for the Third Reich, designed by Ernst Sagebiel in a stripped Palazzo style that maintains the basement and cornice but is almost devoid of decorative detail, relying for effect on the overall proportion and balance of the simple rectangular components. The Reich Aviation Ministry (now the Finance Ministry), built in 1935–36 is a notable example. With the development of Moderne architecture the Palazzo style became less common. Quartier Schützenstrasse, Berlin, (1996) designed by Aldo Rossi =Postmodern architecture= Postmodern architecture has seen some revival in the Palazzo style, in greatly simplified and eclectic forms. The Italian architect Aldo Rossi has designed a number of Palazzo style buildings, including Hotel Il Palazzo in Fukuoka, Japan, (1989) which combines elements of a typical palazzo facade, including projecting cornice, with the intense red found in Japanese traditional architecture, and the green of patinated bronze. Lonely Planet, Michael Clark, Hotel Il Palazzo, accessed 2011-03-27 In 1996 Rossi designed a building complex on a large corner block in the Schützenquartier, Berlin, and previously occupied by a section of the Berlin Wall. Rossi's study of the architecture of the city led him to construct a single building with the appearance of multiple structures, of varying widths, designs and colours, many of which have elements of Palazzo architecture., Jay Berman, Newspaper Area Complex, Aldo Rossi 1996, (1999), accessed 2011-03-27 Characteristics The characteristic appearance of a Palazzo style building is that it draws on the appearance of an Italian palazzo or town house such as those found in Florence and along the Grand Canal in Venice. The style is usually Renaissance Revival but may be Romanesque or, more rarely, Italian Gothic. The facade is cliff-like, without any large projecting portico or pediment. There are several storeys with regular rows of windows which are generally differentiated between levels, and sometimes have pediments that are alternately triangular and segmental. The facade is symmetrical and usually has some emphasis around its centrally placed portal. The basement or ground floor is generally differentiated in the treatment of its masonry, and is often rusticated. The corners of early-19th-century examples generally have quoins or, in 20th-century buildings, there is often some emphasis that gives visual strength to the corners. Except in some Postmodern examples, there is always emphasis on the cornice, which may be very large and overhang the street. All public faces of the building are treated in a similar manner, the main difference being in the decoration of doors. =Palazzo style buildings= File:Athenaeum Club, London - Nov 2006.jpgThe Athenaeum Club, London, by Decimus Burton early 19th century File:Bauakademie Schinkel (Eduard Gaertner).jpgBauakademie, Berlin by Karl Friedrich Schinkel, (1832–36), demolished 1962 File:The Free Trade Hall, Manchester straight.JPGThe Free Trade Hall, Manchester, a Venetian-style building by Edward Walters, (1853) File:38 and 42 Mosley Street, Manchester 4 straight.JPG38 and 42 Mosley Street, Manchester, Edward Walters (1862) File:1Bank Of NSW1.JPGFormer Bank of New South Wales, George Street, Sydney, late 19th century File:Prudential buffalo louis sullivan.jpgThe Guaranty Building, Buffalo, US, (1894) by Louis Sullivan File:IIT Machinery Hall.jpgThe Machinery Hall at Illinois Institute of Technology, Chicago, by C.

Bastian is north-northwest of Bland. Bastian has a post office with ZIP code 24314.ZIP Code Lookup History The small Appalachian town of Bastian, Virginia was first settled between the years of 1905 and 1908. Bastian was originally named Parkersburg after Parker Hornbarger, who along with Jack Hager owned most of the land the town was built upon. Much of this land was later owned by both James Starks and Eli Leedy. The name \\"Bastian\\" came from the manager of Bland County's only railroad, F.E. Bastian. The children of Bastian attended a one room schoolhouse until 1923 when a larger school was built. Schools located near Hunting Camp Creek accommodated local students until then. With the arrival of the Virginia Hardwood Lumber Company in 1927, Bastian's population greatly increased. This increase made additional classrooms a necessity. Several small schools were built during this time. It was not until 1955, however, that the modern brick Bastian Elementary school building was built at the cost of $112,215.79. This building now serves as the Bland County Schoolboard Office. Bastian has been home to many business and industries over the years. The W.F. White Lumber Company, the G.W. Miller Mining Planing Mill, the Canva Mining Company (manganese), the C&A; Lumber Company, and the Tultex Sewing Factory have all operated in the town. The Virginia Hardwood Lumber Company operated a large double-band sawmill in Bastian from 1927 to 1944, employing 350 workers at their peak production. Today General Injectables and Vaccines, a wholesale pharmaceuticals company, is one of the major employers. In the 1930s, Bastian was home to one of the most distinguished CCC camps of the New Deal, and thousands of young men passed through its doors. As the lumber industry grew, new methods of transporting the materials were needed. In 1912, the New River, Holston, and Western Railroad company built a new railroad to Rocky Gap, Virginia. In 1914, W.E. Mingea Jr. of Abingdon, Virginia, who owned all the big survey in Bland County, decided to build the railroad from Bastian to Suiter. This new rail line ran from Narrows, Virginia, up through the communities of Niday, Round Bottom, and Rocky Gap. It continued from there to Hicksville, Bastian, and Suiter. This train served many purposes, including transporting passengers, until it was discontinued in 1946. In the early 1930s, Bastian became the first town in Bland County to use electricity. They received it from the generator of the Virginia Hardwood Lumber Co. Their massive generator produced enough electricity to run both the company and the town. By the mid-1940s the CCC camp, Virginia Hardwood Lumber Company, and the railroad had all closed down. In the early 1970s, Interstate 77 was constructed with its path lying just east of Bastian.

July 16, 1979 while touring in Oxford, EnglandToronto Globe and Mail Newspaper, Monday, July 23, 1979, p. 24) was notable as the founder of Central Baptist Seminary, the leading Canadian training school for evangelical Baptist ministers from 1949 to 1993 when it merged with London Baptist Seminary to form Heritage Theological Seminary. Background Known as W. Gordon Brown, he was born into the home of the Baptist minister, Rev. William J. Hay Brown and Elizabeth Greenwood Moore. His maternal grandfather was also a Baptist minister, James Beach Moore. He was the great-great-grandson of Samuel Moore, a leader in the Quaker movement, and a direct descendant of Samuel Moore, an official in the American colony of East Jersey in the 1670s. His maternal uncle was William Henry Moore, Member of the Canadian House of Commons from 1930 to 1945. His childhood home moved according to his father's changes of pulpits from their ancestral village of Brownsville, to Brantford to Hamilton to West Toronto, Ontario. He was ordained into the Baptist ministry in 1924. His first administrative post in a seminary was Dean of Toronto Baptist Seminary and Bible College, the school that had been started in 1927 by Baptist Fundamentalist T.T. Shields after a Modernist professor had been hired at McMaster Divinity College. This post lasted until 1948 when he was dismissed by Shields for expressing more moderate positions, however it was perhaps the actions of a radical and no longer biblically-grounded Shields who often left rationality for fanaticism.Brackney, W.H. (2006) Baptists in North America. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 167 In 1949, Brown took 50 students and some faculty members from Toronto Baptist Seminary to start the Canadian Baptist Seminary (later Central Baptist Seminary). \\"Shields was outraged at what he saw to be a personal betrayal.\\" D.A. Carson, Memoirs of an Ordinary Pastor: the Life and Reflections of Tom Carson, Crossway Publishing, 2008, p.52 However, he had the blessing of the Bible Baptist Union. Central Baptist Seminary would become the conservative Baptist seminary of choice in Ontario until it merged with London Baptist Bible College and Seminary to form Heritage Baptist College and Heritage Theological Seminary in 1993. While Dean of Central Baptist Seminary, Brown also served as pastor of Runnymede Baptist Church in Toronto for 25 years. After that post, he served as an associate pastor of Forward Baptist Church, also in Toronto. In all, Brown served his denomination for over 50 years. At his 50th anniversary celebration in 1974, over 100 telegrams and letters arrived from all over Canada. More than 500 people attended the service. \\"The general secretary of the Fellowship [of Evangelical Baptist Churches], Dr. J. M. Watt, presented Dr. Brown with an illuminated citation. The citation appropriately recognized his abilities and contributions as a scholar of the Scriptures, as an administrator of and a professor in theological institutions; as a leader in the Baptist cause; as a pastor with a warm love for souls; as a Christian gentleman who loves and lives Christ.\\"Evangelical Baptist (Official magazine of The Fellowship of Evangelical Baptist Churches in Canada), May/June 1974 W. Gordon Brown also participated in the translation and editing of the original New International Version of the Bible (1973-1978) with the International Bible Society.http://www.bible-researcher.com/niv-translators.html His peers in the Evangelical Theology Society commented on his passing by noting that \\"thousands of workers in mission fields in far-off continents and in flourishing centers in Canada received their best inspiration and preparation for service from him. What they received from him was not building material fragile and flimsy but material of stone and iron to construct temples for the soul.\\"The Journal of the Evangelical Theology Society, 23/1, (March 1980) p.91 Even though Brown was a third generation Baptist preacher, and a notable leader in a conservative branch of that denomination, his brother L. Douglas Brown served as an assistant priest at St. George's Anglican Church in Guelph, Ontario, and eventually converted to Roman Catholicism and was ordained in 1949 as a Roman Catholic priest. He pre-deceased W. Gordon in 1964 while serving in St. Stephen's parish in Cayuga, Ontario.

Soc. Stud. (21 December 1929 – 20 April 2019) was an Australian photographer active as an amateur from the 1950s and professional photographic artist from the 1980s, director of the Church Street Photography Centre in Melbourne (1976–1982), art curator and collector, and tertiary photography lecturer. Early work Evans was presented with a Leica camera by her wealthy father and her earliest surviving photography is from 1949 to 1951 and records marches, demonstrations and youth events including the 1949 May Day March; the 2nd World Festival of Youth and Students, Budapest, 1949; and the Melbourne University Labour Club participating in demonstrations in 1951. She studied painting with John Olsen at the Bakery Art School, Sydney in 1967/1968, but much later 'fell in love' with photography at the Basel Art Fair, which led first to a career as a gallerist, then as a practicing photographer.  Church Street Photographic Centre  In 1976 Evans opened Church Street Photographic Centre, a specialist photography gallery and bookshop in Church Street, Richmond, Victoria. It was the third commercial photographic gallery in 1970s Melbourne to open after Brummels (1972) and The Photographers Gallery (1973) and showcased International 19th and 20th Century photographyMcCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art, 2006 ed, 409 including Berenice Abbott, Eugène Atget, Julia Margaret Cameron,Corrie Perkin, 'A camera on history,' The Age, Monday 18 Jun 1979, p.8 Henri Cartier-Bresson, Imogen Cunningham, Elllott Erwitt, Robert Frank, Hill and Adamson, André Kertész,Tony Perry, Distortions' show a new perspective,' The Age, Friday November 1978, p.2 Les Krims, Martin Lacis, James Newberry, Arnold Newman, Bill Owens, Jan Saudek,The Age, Thursday 28 May 1981, p.10 W.

In 1981, in order to keep their gallery solvent Evans sold off her inventory of books and magazines;The Age, Monday 02 March 1981, p.10 they became a foundation for 'The Printed Image' bookshop, which also specialised exclusively in photography. The gallery space was also used to present visiting speakers and for photographic workshops,The Age, Friday 17 February 1978, p.40 tutored by photographers and writers of the era including Pete Turner, editor of Creative Camera, UK; Jean-Marc Le Pechoux, publisher/editor of Light Vision; John Cato; and Ian Cosier. Church Street also housed a photographic darkroom and framing facilities (which were used by artists and photographers, notably by German artist Herbert Zangs during his Australian visit in 1981). In 1975, when Australian photography was developing a higher profile and becoming collectible, Horsham Regional Art Gallery Director Jean Davidson made the decision that the gallery would specialise in the medium, and during the following years consulted on purchases with the National Gallery of Victoria’s Jennie Boddington and with Evans, who was then running Church Street Gallery. One of the works she later acquired was Evans’ The Ascent (1993). Over November and December 1981, Evans held a Final Retrospective of photographers who had shown in the gallery since 1977,The Age, Friday 13 Nov 1981, p.45 then closed the Church Street premises in 1982, and relocated the gallery's collection and inventory to a private studio, from which she continued to operate. In 1978 she was appointed Approved Commonwealth Valuer for Australian and International photography from the 19th Century to the present day for the Australian Government's Cultural Gifts Program. Evans continued acting as a specialist adviser on photography for a number of public institutions and prominent private collectors in Australia.  Photographer  After closing the Church Street Gallery, Evans enrolled at Photography Studies College in 1982, then devoted her time to photography, undertaking portraiture, documentary and landscape. In the latter genre her work includes an extended photo essay on roadside verges where she found wildlife road kills and fatalities. Completed between 1988 and 1996, Evans made the shots with a Widelux F7 35mm panoramic camera held in a vertical orientation and she often rotated the camera about the axis of its swiveling lens to produce distortion. The photo-book Only One Kilometre was made by Evans in the small Balcombe Estuary Reserve at Mt Martha on the Mornington Peninsula, the photographs presented with poetry and literary contributions from Graeme Kinross-Smith, Pat Raison and Chris Wallace-Crabbe. She also photographed in the Dandenong Ranges; along the Hume Hwy; in the Central Desert and outback Australia, most notably Oodnadatta, Oodlawirra, Menindee, and Lake Mungo; vineyards and rural villages in the South of France; and the old Jewish cemetery in the centre of Prague. Evans's portrait photographs were taken mainly in black and white, at close range, and were usually environmental portraits that emphasised the psychological connexion between the sitter and his or her own space. They form a diverse cross-section of Australian society from anonymous sitters to intelligentsia and personalities, among them Marianne Baillieu; Barbara Blackman; Baron Avid von Blumenthal; Tim Burstall; Dur-e Dara; Robert Dessaix; Germaine Greer; Elena Kats-Chernin; Joan Kerr; Ellen Koshland; David Malouf; Dame Elisabeth Murdoch; Lin Onus; Jill Reichstein; and Chris Wallace-Crabbe. Evans worked as an honorary photographer for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Central Australia and for over ten years documented Australian country towns and events for the National Library of Australia.  Education and lecturing  Evans played an educational role in Australian photography. She taught history of photography at Melbourne's RMIT University; was appointed inaugural assistant director of Waverley City Gallery (now Monash Gallery of Art), 1990–1991, the first municipal public collection in Melbourne to specialise in photography; inaugurated a course on the History of Photography taught by Daniel Palmer and was appointed Research Fellow at the University of Melbourne (1997–2010).

It opened on Thanksgiving Day, 1888 with a guest capacity of 50. It has been enlarged twice, a three-story addition to the south in 1899 differentiated by round rather than square window caps, and fourth story built in 1913, bringing the total number of rooms to 90. Among the various businesses to occupy the first floor and basement of the building were First National Bank and a 14-hole miniature golf course. A fire in 1944 destroyed the floors in the south section, but the hotel was able to reopen the following April. By 1978 it had declined to the point that it was condemned by the State Fire Marshall. After two years of thorough renovation the hotel was again able to open for business. Architecture Architectural details include the oriel window, a replica of the original which was removed along with the balcony in 1912, a large quartzite arch, the corner door, and a crenelated cornice. In popular culture Hotel Hell covered the hotel in an episode of the series, broadcast on August 18, 2014, on the U.S. Fox television network.Hotel Hell turns up the heat on historic Pipestone hotel References External links * Official Website Buildings and structures in Pipestone County, Minnesota Hotel buildings completed in 1888 Hotel buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Individually listed contributing properties to historic districts on the National Register in Minnesota National Register of Historic Places in Pipestone County, Minnesota Romanesque Revival architecture in Minnesota ","title":"Calumet Hotel (Pipestone, Minnesota)"},{"id":"31177119","text":"Pandy Malayalam or Pandyan Malayalam is a dialect of Malayalam spoken by immigrants from Pandian kingdom in those regions of Kerala.Subramoniam, V.

Overview A fully developed heat flow in a pipe can be considered in the following situation. If the tube wall of the pipe is constantly heated or cooled so the heat flux from the wall to the fluid via convection is a fixed value, then the bulk temperature of the fluid increases steadily at a fixed rate along the flow direction. An example can be a pipe covered entirely by an electrical heating pad, and the flow is introduced after a uniform heat flux from the pad is achieved. At a distance away from the entrance of the fluid, the fully developed heat flow is achieved when the heat transfer coefficient of the fluid becomes constant, and the temperature profile has the same shape along the flow.Mills, A. F.(1999)Heat Transfer. 2nd Ed. Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, New Jersey This distance is defined as the thermal entrance length, which is important for engineers to design efficient heat transfer processes. Quantitative measurement Quantitatively, If x is chosen to be the axis parallel to the pipe and x = 0 is chosen as the commencing point of the pipe flow, the thermal entrance length is defined as the distance (x >0) required for the Nusselt number Nu associated with the pipe flow to decrease to within 5% of its value for a fully developed heat flow [1]. Depends on different flow conditions (laminar, turbulent, shapes of entrance, etc.), the Nusselt number has different dependence on Reynolds number, Prandtl number and the friction factor of the flow. Simple scenario A simple example is a laminar flow which is already hydrodynamically fully developed at x=0, and a constant and uniform pipe wall temperature is maintained. In this case, the thermal entrance length can be calculated by a simplified equation written as: (Leh (5%))/D=0.033 ReDPr [1] where D is the pipe diameter, ReD the Reynolds number and Pr is the Prandtl number. Given Reynolds number is a constant for a hydrodynamically fully developed flow (where the velocity of the flow remains unchanged), the equation above indicates that the thermal entrance length is proportional to the Prandtl number [1], which is defined as the ratio of momentum diffusion rate to the thermal diffusion rate of a fluid. That is, a low Pr material, with its thermal diffusion rate closer to its momentum diffusion rate, can achieve a fully developed heat flow at a shorter distance compared to a high Pr material in this situation. Complex scenario In a more complicate scenario (turbulent flow, rectangular entrance, open end entrance, etc.), there is seldom an easy method to calculate the thermal entrance length. If the flow is laminar, i.e. Reynolds number is equal or less than 2100 to 2300, the thermal entrance length can be within 5 diameters for high Pr and low Pr materials given there is no large perturbation or eddies [1]. For gases and water at higher temperatures, the Prandtl number is close to 1 and the thermal entrance length can vary between 15 and 40 diameters [1]. Overall, the determination of the thermal entrance length can be difficult and requires an understanding of the heat and fluid transfer phenomenon, and a list of different calculations and charts can be found in various reading sources.

He was the captain of the Royal Engineers team that reached the final of the FA Cup in 1878, where they were defeated 3–1 by the Wanderers. Early life and education Hedley was born in Taunton, Somerset and educated at Reading School. At Reading, he played for the school football XI from 1871 to 1873, including in a match against Reading F.C. in its inaugural season. According to the 1871 census, he lived with his mother, Catherine, at Easby Hall, Easby, Richmond in Yorkshire. On leaving school, he joined the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. On 2 August 1876, he was appointed as Lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. Football career Hedley played football for the Royal Military Academy and for the Royal Engineers. A centre-forward, he was described as \\"a useful centre, combining considerable speed and weight with no small amount of energy\\", although early reports suggested that \\"he should study shooting at goal\\". In 1878, his scoring ability helped the Royal Engineers to reach the final of the FA Cup with hat- tricks in the early rounds against the Pilgrims (won 6–0) and Druids (won 8–0). For the final, played at Kennington Oval on 23 March, Hedley was captain for the Engineers. Wanderers won the match 3–1 although early in the second half, with the score 2–1, Hedley had a \\"goal\\" disallowed due to an infringement of the offside rule. His goal-scoring for the Engineers brought him to the attention of the England selectors who named him in the squad for the international against Scotland on 2 March 1878, but he was not available to play. He was called up again for the Scotland international the following March, but this match was postponed because of bad weather and he was again unavailable for the re-arranged match. Hedley was a member of the Football Association committee in 1878–1879. Military career and death Hedley was posted to Ceylon where he drowned at Trincomalee on 29 January 1884, two weeks after his 27th birthday. He was out boating and landed on a rock offshore. At some point, his boat came loose and drifted away; Hedley tried to swim back to the boat, but failed to reach it. Eventually, his body was discovered by a search party who had been sent out to look for him.

Innistrad is a \\"top-down\\" designed block based on Gothic horror. The set's mechanics and effects take mainly graveyard themes, with a minor focus on tribal themes. The tagline for the set is \\"Horror Lurks Within\\". It has 264 cards. Magic returned to the plane of Innistrad in 2016 with the Shadows Over Innistrad block, consisting of Shadows Over Innistrad and Eldritch Moon. This article deals with the original Innistrad block. Design and development =Innistrad= According to Magic lead designer Mark Rosewater, \\"The number- one role of this set's design was capturing the feel of the horror genre.\\" Monsters were one of the first tropes explored which led to the tribal component of the set. =Dark Ascension= Dark Ascension was first revealed at the 2011 Comic-Con in San Diego, California. Just like Worldwake, Dark Ascension is a small set in between two large sets. Dark Ascension boosters always contain a double-faced card of any rarity to replace one of the commons in the pack. Much of the development had a top down approach. Dark Ascension develops the themes of Innistrad. The plane is still plagued by Werewolves, Zombies, Vampires, Spirits and other creatures of the night. The set puts a stronger emphasis on those creature types, giving each type of monster more support. Meanwhile, the humans are on the verge of extinction and have to take desperate measures to stem the tide. Dark Ascension has several broken cycles (a cycle where one color is omitted) to show how humans are . Storyline The events of the Innistrad block center on the events after the sundering of the Helvault, a giant chunk of silver metal that was used by the archangel Avacyn to imprison Innistrad's worst horrors, the demons. It is then revealed why the archangel Avacyn vanished from the plane in the first place, leaving the humans of the plane defenseless against the gothic horrors of Innistrad. In the early days of Avacyn's presence in Innistrad, long before the block takes place, the archangel sought to rid the plane of its demonic influences. Accompanied by her fellow angels, she challenged each demon she encountered to single combat, defeating and dispatching them one-by-one. However, since demons are beings composed of pure mana, their defeat only meant that their physical forms were shattered, their dark essence living on. Eventually the black mana would coalesce in another dark corner of the plane, and another demon would appear. Avacyn soon noted that no matter how many times a demon was defeated, there would always be another one to take its place. All that its destruction would buy was temporary peace to the afflicted towns and villages. Thus, she took an oath, saying \\"What cannot be destroyed, must be bound\\". This oath is reflected in the symbol of the archangel herself, the Collar of Avacyn, shaped to bind any evil that would not be destroyed. With this new goal in mind, Avacyn used her divine magics to trap demons, one-by- one in the Helvault. She was so successful at doing this that after a time, only the plane's elder demons remained free of the Helvault's magical prison. It was then that the great demon Griselbrand decided to challenge Avacyn to single combat, boldly landing on the top of the Helvault itself. For many days the battle raged on between archangel and archdemon, watched only by the church's highest officials (such as Mikaeus, the lunarch) and Avacyn's most powerful angelic compatriots (Gisela, leader of the angelic Flight of Goldnight, was the only one explicitly mentioned to have been a spectator). Seeing as she could not defeat Griselbrand, Avacyn used all her remaining power to cast a final binding spell to drive the archdemon into the Helvault and seal him away forever. However, at that moment, the demon revealed his endgame, to trap the archangel herself in her own prison. Using his spear, Griselbrand thrust the weapon through her, dealing her a mortal blow just as the binding spell was completed. The spell backfired, drawing in both angel and demon to the Helvault, with the ongoing spectators watching in horror as their beloved archangel was impaled, then imprisoned within the magical chunk of moonsilver. Because of fears that reporting Avacyn's disappearance would incite mass hysteria and panic among the human denizens of the plane, Mikaeus and the other church officials decided to cover up any reports concerning the reason behind archangel's disappearance. Nevertheless, the archmages and clergy of the Church soon began to feel the aftereffects of the archangel's vanishing. Spells, wards and enchantments began to fail all over Innistrad. Prayers to the archangel went unanswered. Monsters and creatures of the night were no longer held at bay by Avacyn's holy might. Sensing weakness, Innistrad's werewolf howlpacks, vampire hordes and unstoppable waves of zombies began preying actively on the humans. At the onset of these events in Innistrad, the Planeswalker Liliana Vess had come to the plane of Innistrad to reclaim her soul, which she had traded to four demons in exchange for beauty and power. She believes that by killing her dark debtors, her own bargain would be negated, and she wouldn't have to continue being subservient to these demons. During her earlier days of serving her demonic masters she eventually found and claimed a dark artifact known as the Chain Veil, which greatly amplified the potential of her dark magics. Liliana used the power of the Veil to kill one of her four demonic masters, Kothophed, and she has tracked her next target, Griselbrand, to Innistrad. During her search for the demon, Liliana was beset by the Planeswalker Garruk Wildspeaker, on whom she had used the Chain Veil to bestow a curse in a previous encounter. However, she managed to fend him off due to the dampening properties of the Veil's curse upon Garruk's nature magic. In the end, Garruk was overwhelmed by a small army of undead raised by Liliana and left for dead. Upon reaching the great city of Thraben, Liliana uncovers a plot by two rival sibling necromancers to besiege the holy city, the blue-oriented stitcher Geralf, and his black-oriented ghoulcaller sister Gisa. Despite the city receiving warning reports from cathars and inquisitors, not much was done to reinforce the city's walls and failing wards. Due to this lack of adequate preparation, the holy city was caught unawares by the massive army both siblings had amassed. In the end, only the quick thinking of the cathar Thalia spared the city from utter destruction. Thalia's plan was simple, to use the thatched straw roofs of Thraben's houses to create a ring of fire, burning down the entire army of undead. The plan was successful as most of the city was spared from the undead horde, albeit at the loss of many cathars and buildings because of the great fire. Despite this successful defence, during the siege, Geralf infiltrated the heart of the city and slew Mikaeus, the lunarch himself. Not wanting the news to demoralise the already downcast human citizens of the plane, the other church officials buried the lunarch in secret. Liliana used this opportunity to raise Mikaeus from the dead and interrogate the corpse of Griselbrand's whereabouts, instead learning of the epic battle between Avacyn and her demonic master and their current entrapment in the Helvault. Not possessing magic capable of sundering the great silver mass, Liliana approached the problem from a different angle. She reanimated a small army of ghouls and zombies and proceeded to attack the sanctuary where the Helvault resided. Now charged with protecting the Helvault at all costs, the newly appointed Guardian of Thraben, Thalia faced off Liliana with a squad of elite cathars backing her up. Catching them completely off guard, Liliana paralyzed the squad of cathars with a wave of dark magic and gave Thalia this ultimatum: sunder the Helvault, or watch her comrades fall to the undead army. It only took the strangled cry of a single cathar as he fell prey to the ghouls that Thalia pointed toward the Helvault and cursed Liliana. With a great explosion, the silver prison that was the Helvault shattered, releasing demons and archangel alike. No one noticed the ribbons of black mana streaking away from the shattered remains. All eyes were fixed upon the golden helix streaking out into the sky. Avacyn had returned to the plane. When the Helvault shattered, Avacyn emerged at her full strength. Her presence reinfused the Avacynian protective wards with holy magic once again. Her angelic host was restored to its full powers, which gave the humans the chance to gain the upper hand in their fight against evil. The three flights of angels reformed in greater numbers than before. Once again, they became Avacyn's soldiers on the front lines of battle. Only this time, instead of barely containing the monsters of the world, the angels and their human allies began pushing them back, away from the bastions of human civilization. For the first time, they were winning. Now that Griselbrand was also freed from the Helvault, Liliana continues her search for the demon, and her release from the fell contract she entered into. Meanwhile, the plane's horrors continued to be driven back by the renewed power of the Church. In the process of purging the town of Gatstaf from the threat of werewolf howlpacks, the villagers appealed to Avacyn to remove the curse of lycanthropy upon their loved ones, whom they could not bear to see put to death because of a curse they could not control. Although she could not undo the werewolf curse, she revealed that she would instead transform those afflicted by the curse (but loyal to her and the Church), fusing the warring aspects of human and wolf into a single creature; the \\"wolfir\\". In a powerful wave of spells that would become known as the Cursemute, Avacyn's magic reverberated throughout the plane, transforming not just many werewolves but undoing many of the world's foul curses. The wolfir emerged as a new race of great wolf-creatures dedicated to the principles of the Church of Avacyn. The Cursemute had an unintended impact on a visitor to the plane: Garruk Wildspeaker. At the moment the Cursemute swept across the land, Garruk was knee-deep in swamp muck surrounded by the severed limbs of Liliana's ghouls. He had barely managed to defeat them, and burdened by the Veil's curse, was slowly descending into madness. Close to death and tormented by pain and fury, Garruk's mind slipped away from him. He wandered in blind circles, shouting at the ravens and imagined monsters. It might have been the end of the great hunter, but for the events unfolding in Gatstaf Spring. When Avacyn's thaumaturgy reached him, Garruk regained his senses. He stared down at his arms, watching the black veins receding from his skin. He was overcome with joy at the sudden absence of pain and sickness. But the relief was short- lived. Within seconds the veins reappeared, his blood seemed to thicken to tar, and his back bent under the weight of the Veil's curse once again. The Cursemute was enough to bring him back from madness and death, but it was not enough to cure him. After slogging his way out of the swamp, he came upon Angel's Way, a well-traveled road between Kessig and Thraben. He knew Liliana was heading to Thraben, and he could doggedly continue his pursuit. Or he could strike out another way, toward the origin of the magic he had felt so strongly. There was a power on this plane that could cure curses. Maybe there was another way to rid him of his evil burden—a way that didn't involve the death-witch. Tribes In Innistrad, there are five tribes, major creature types that also play a role mechanically. Each tribe is linked to an allied color combination. * Humans – Humans occur in all colors but occur predominantly in white and green. White humans are frequently depicted as religious officials and warriors under the Church of Avacyn, while green humans are typically monster hunters. This is the first set in which humans are treated as a tribe. * Spirits – Spirits mainly fall under white and blue mana, but also appear sporadically in the other colors. White spirits typically represent benevolent guardian spirits while blue spirits represent mischievous geists. * Zombies – Zombies occur in black and blue. Blue zombies (or skaabs) are Frankenstein's Monster-like beings stitched together from disparate body parts and reanimated by necro-alchemists, while black zombies are ones that have risen from their graves through necromancy and attack in hordes. * Vampires – Vampires occur in black and red. Black vampires showcase the sophisticated individuals that form the vampiric aristocratic families while red vampires usually depict vampires who indulge in mundane pleasures or have gone wild with bloodthirst, becoming utter bloodfeeding savages. * Werewolves – Werewolves occur in red and green. Every werewolf is a double- faced card with the transform mechanic. One side of each of the werewolf cards represents the afflicted human, while the other side represents the actual werewolf that the cursed human transforms into when certain conditions are met. Green werewolves are usually hermits and outcasts, while red werewolves are mostly bandits and renegades. Mechanics Innistrad introduces four new mechanics (Curse, Fight, Morbid, Transform) and reintroduces one old mechanic (Flashback). Curses are a new enchantment subtype that enchants a player, causing negative effects (hence the name) of varying degrees. Fight is a new keyword that refers to two creatures dealing damage to each other equal to their power simultaneously (it had appeared on previous cards, but this is the first time it was keyworded). Morbid conditions occur if a creature has died earlier in the turn that the spell is cast or the ability is used. The transform mechanic allows certain creatures to turn into different creatures once certain conditions specified on the card are met. Each card that can transform is a double-faced card. The returning mechanic (from the Odyssey and Time Spiral blocks) was flashback. Spells with flashback can be played again from the graveyard, essentially getting a second use out of the spell. However, using a Flashback ability removes the card from the game. All the major mechanics of Innistrad, including Double-faced cards, return for Dark Ascension. Many of the double-faced cards in Dark Ascension are humans on one side and werewolves on the other. Dark Ascension also has a number of cards involving the number 13. Two new mechanics debuted in Dark Ascension: Fateful Hour and Undying. Cards with fateful hour abilities have an enhanced effect when their controller has 5 or fewer life points remaining. Undying is a new keyword mechanic that is featured on creature cards. When a creature with Undying dies, if it had no +1/+1 counters on it, it returns to the battlefield with a +1/+1 counter on it, effectively allowing a creature to survive destruction at least once. Two new mechanics debuted in Avacyn Restored: miracle and soulbond Miracle is a new keyword found on instants and sorceries. Spells with Miracle have a cheaper, alternate casting cost that can be paid if the spell was the first card drawn during the turn, then immediately cast after being drawn. Soulbond is a new keyword mechanic that is featured on creature cards. When a creature with Soulbond enters the battlefield, it can be paired up with another creature that player controls, granting bonus abilities to both creatures until one or both creatures leave play. Conversely, if another creature enters play, it can be paired with an unpaired creature with Soulbond. Of the mechanics of Innistrad and Dark Ascension, only undying returns for Avacyn.

Gordon Roberts Hospital, Shillong or KJP Hospital (Khasi Jaintia Presbyterian Hospital), is one of the oldest medical centres in Meghalaya. This Christian institution was founded by Dr. Hughes Gordon Roberts and is located in the city of Shillong in the north east of India. History Dr. H. Gordon Roberts was the founder of the hospital. He arrived in Shillong in 1913 and started work with a small dispensary at Mission Compound near the KJP Girls’ High School. He started the construction of the building of the hospital in 1915 with the permission given by the government of Assam. The work was started on the edge of the town, in the part called Jaiaw where it stands to this date. The hospital was officially opened on the 25 March 1922 by the then Governor of Assam, Sir William Marris, as a 90-bed hospital and was known as the Khasi Hills Welsh Mission Hospital. Roberts was the founder and the first chief medical officer of the hospital which is still known as \\"Dr. Roberts Hospital\\" by many people. For many years, the hospital was one of the few institutions in the north east of India in which major surgery could be performed. Dr. R. A. Hughes, a very qualified surgeon with additional training in tropical medicine, came to Shillong in March 1939 and he became senior medical officer in 1942 on the retirement of Roberts. He expanded the hospital's accommodation, introduced the latest operating techniques, started the first blood bank in Shillong, introduced the latest anesthetic machine (EMO) and other facilities like the boiler generating steam for the hospital. He was assisted by Khasi doctors such as Dr. Drin Sing Hynniewta who joined from 1928 in the Department of O&G; and Dr. (Miss) O. Roy as an anaesthetist. From time to time, missionary doctors came to help Hughes; among them were Dr. Stanley Russell and Dr. P.A. Shave. With the departure of the missionaries, when Hughes retired in 1969 the responsibility of running the hospital fell passed to the Khasi Jaintia Presbyterian Synod and Dr. E.C. Synkon was appointed as senior medical officer, Dr. S. P. Sen. Gupta as the surgeon superintendent and Mr. O. Gilbert as the secretary of the hospital. After a brief spell as surgeon, Sen. Gupta left in 1972 and Gilbert retired due to ill health. In 1981, at the KJP Synod meeting held at Mawlai Phudmawri once again changed the name of the hospital to \\"The Khasi and Jaintia Presbyterian Synod Hospital, Jaiaw Shillong\\". Dr. P. Lamare took over as the medical superintendent and secretary of the managing committee of the hospital. After the Lamare's retirement in 1998, Dr. (Mrs.) K.

Whilst it was part of a national trunk line (Magistrale) and handled long-distance traffic; today the line is exclusively worked by local trains. It takes its name from the Bruhrain, a region in the northwestern part of Karlsruhe district, which it passes through. Route The line is entirely within the Rhine valley and it forms an almost a straight line between Bruchsal and Graben-Neudorf. The two largest engineering structures are the bridge over the Rhine Railway north of Graben-Neudorf and the Rhine bridge between Rheinsheim and Germersheim. The line runs from Bruchsal through the municipalities of Karlsdorf-Neuthard and Graben-Neudorf. The line runs from Huttenheim to Rheinsheim along the boundaries of the town of Phillipsburg, before finishing at Germersheim. From Bruchsal to the Rhine, the line runs within the district of Karlsruhe. Across the Rhine, the line runs through the district of Germersheim. History =Planning, construction and development up to 1900 = A treaty between the Grand Duchy of Baden and the Kingdom of Bavaria authorised the building of a railway line from Bruchsal to Germersheim. Rhine Bridge at Germersheim Bruhrain Railway (left in picture) north of Graben- Neudorf, Rhine Railway to the right. This grade-separated crossing was opened in 1909 On 15 August 1870, a temporary \\"war railway\\" (Kriegsbahn) was opened between the two towns as a supply line for the Franco-Prussian War, but it was closed on 12 August 1871. Some of it was used for later the Bruhrain Railway, but in other parts its route is used for roads that still exist. The Bruchsal–Rheinsheim section opened on 23 November 1874. The extension to Germersheim was delayed for a few years, as the military authorities insisted that the bridge should have a location that would not interfere with the line of fire from the fortress of Germersheim. In August 1874, after an agreement was reached regarding the location of the bridge over the Rhine, the plan to extend the line to Germersheim was approved and work began on 9 April 1875. On 15 May 1877, the gap was closed between Rheinsheim and Germersheim. The Bruhrain Railway was now passable throughout. While only one track was initially operated over the Rhine bridge at Germersheim, a few years later the second track was put in operation. The Bruhrain Railway was from 1890 used for the first time as part of an inter-regional connection, running on the Bruchsal–Germersheim–Landau–Biebermühle–Zweibrücken–Saarbrücken route. The Lower Queich Valley Railway is now closed between Germersheim and Landau. In addition, long-distance trains also ran from that time between Munich and Saarbrücken on the Bruhrain Railway. =Developments until the Second World War = The long-distance services gained even more importance in 1909, when a grade separated junction was opened between the Bruhrain Railway and the Rhine Railway north of Graben-Neudorf. The old line between Huttenheim and Graben- Neudorf is still recognisable from the road layout and the use of two signal boxes. Since the weight of trains had increased steadily on the line, it was necessary to strengthen the structure of the bridge over the Rhine. This was done between 1927 and 1930. In 1938, the operation of long-distance traffic between Saarbrücken and Munich over the Bruhrain Railway was reorganised. The Bruhrain Railway subsequently only carry long-distance freight transport, while the long-distance passenger services ran instead via Karlsruhe and Worth and then continued via Landau and Zweibrücken to Saarbrücken. In the Second World War several military trains also ran on the line. In the course of the war, the importance of the line increased, as gradually all the bridges over the Rhine—with the exception of the Rhine bridge between Rheinsheim and Germersheim—were blown up by German troops to impede Allied troops crossing the Rhine. Finally, on 24 March 1945, the Rhine bridge between Rheinsheim and Germersheim was also destroyed. Karlsdorf station with travelling freight train Station Graben - Neudorf =Operations under Deutsche Bahn (since 1945)= As part of war reparations, which Germany had to pay because it lost World War II, the Bruhrain Railway between Graben-Neudorf and Germersheim was reduced to one track. Since the section between Graben-Neudorf and Bruchsal had great importance for rail traffic, it kept its second track. Electrification of this section was completed on 1 June 1958. From the 1960s there was considerable debate about the reconstruction of the bridge over the Rhine. Opponents of the reconstruction highlighted the small importance of the bridge for traffic, yet approval for the work was announced in 1964. Three years later, on 23 October 1967, the bridge over the Rhine was reopened. However, contrary to expectations, it continued to have no more than regional significance. At the end of the 1980s, services of regional trains of the Saarbrücken–Zweibrücken–Landau–Karlsruhe route ran for a few weeks on the Bruhrain Railway because the bridge over the Rhine between Karlsruhe and Worth had to be repaired after it had been damaged by a barge and express trains were diverted over the Bruhrain Railway. In 1994, the Rhine bridge between Rheinsheim and Germersheim was reduced to operations with only one track. At the same time Rheinsheim station was reduced to the status of a halt (Haltepunkt, that is it has no sets of points). In May 1994, the halt of Graben-Neudorf Nord was opened between Graben-Neudorf station and Huttenheim in order to improve access to the town of Neudorf. From the spring of 2000, the Regional-Express line was introduced on the Mainz–Germersheim–Karlsruhe route every two hours, which travelled over the Germersheim–Graben-Neudorf section of the Bruhrain Railway. In the course of the upgrade of the line for S-Bahn operations, the Graben-Neudorf-Germersheim section was electrified in 2010 and 2011 and three new stations were built at Bruchsal Sportzentrum, Bruchsal Am Mantel and Germersheim Mitte. The existing six stations were modernised. The platforms were then raised to a height of 76 cm and extended to a length of 140 m (corresponding, for example, to two class 425 multiple units). At the timetable change on Sunday 11 December 2011, the new S-Bahn services were opened between Germersheim and Bruchsal and integrated into the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn as line S 33. Operations  =Timetable = Class 628 on the Bruhrain Railway in Bruchsal The Bruhrain Railway is listed under table 704 of the Deutsche Bahn timetable. As of May 1994, the Bruhrain Railway also benefited from two improvements to its services: firstly, through the establishment of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbund (Karlsruhe Transport Association, KVV), which has since managed services on the railway as line R 9; and, secondly, the introduction of the Rhineland-Palatinate integrated regular interval timetable (Rheinland-Pfalz-Takt). Hourly services were introduced under the new timetable, including for the first time since 1945 through trains on Sundays. Philippsburg station S-Bahn services of the Rhine- Neckar S-Bahn are operated on the line with class 425 sets, as line S 33, running from Bruchsal to Germersheim, in some cases running through to Mainz. On the Graben-Neudorf–Germersheim section Regional-Express (RE) services run every two hours on the Karlsruhe–Speyer–Germersheim–Mannheim–Worms–Mainz route, also using class 425 multiple units. The only intermediate stop for RE services between Graben-Neudorf and Germersheim is Phillipsburg. The trip by S-Bahn from Bruchsal to Germersheim takes a total of 30 minutes, a ride on a Regional-Express service from Graben-Neudorf to Germersheim lasts 16 minutes. =Traffic = The line is electrified. On the Bruchsal–Graben Neudorf section freight services operate towards Kornwestheim marshalling yard in Stuttgart. Freight has decreased significantly in recent decades on the Graben- Neudorf–Germersheim section. Between Philipsburg and Rheinsheim, however, there is a siding to the Philippsburg Nuclear Power Plant, which is served by a few freight trains. On the single track section between Graben-Neudorf and Germersheim the only passing loop is at Philipsburg. Abandoned freight tracks in Philippsburg From the early 1990s until the introduction of the Rhine- Neckar S-Bahn there were services on the Bruchsal–Germersheim–Ludwigshafen–Mannheim–Heidelberg–Neckargemünd–Meckenheim–Sinsheim–Steinsfurt–Eppingen/Heilbronn route, operated with locomotives of class 218 hauling Silberling carriages. At the end of 2003 these services were abandoned with the opening of the first stage of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn and services on the Bruhrain Railway stopped at Speyer. With the extension of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn from Speyer to Germersheim in December 2006, the trains on the Bruhrain Railway only ran as far as Germersheim. Since the integration of the Bruhrain Railway in the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn in December 2011, some services continue past Germersheim. At the end of 2004, the push–pull trains hauled by class 218 locomotives were replaced with class 628 diesel multiple units. These in turn were replaced in December 2011 by class 425 electric multiple units. Huttenheim station =Future = An extension of the Hardt Railway (Hardtbahn) services (S 1 and S 11 of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn) from Linkenheim-Hochstetten to connect with Phillipsburg station on the Bruhrain Railway has been considered, but seems rather unrealistic in the current circumstances. It may become necessary to duplicate the western section of the Bruhrain Railway, but no public commitments have been made, although this section is the only single-track section of the Rhine-Neckar S-Bahn network and has substantial traffic.

Biography Hailing from a family of reputed musicians from Nagercoil in the Kingdom of Travancore ((now in Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India), Chidambaranathan took early lessons in mridangam and Carnatic vocal from his father, B. K. Arunachalam Annavi. He also took training for sometime under Muttiah Bhagavathar and used to play mridangam for him at his concerts. He then learnt the violin first under Nagamani Marthanda Nadar and then for seven years under the Kumbakonam Rajamanickam Pillai. Chidmabranathan was noticed by music director C. N. Pandurangan, when he was playing violin at a concert of M. M. Dandapani Desikar. Career His film career began in 1948 when he assisted Pandurangan for the Tamil films Gokuladasi and Jnanasoundari. He debuted in Malayalam with Vellinakshathram, the first film of Udaya Studios. He had also scored a Sinhalese film before his entry into Malayalam. After scoring the film Sthree (1950), his third film as a composer, Chidambaranathan took a sabbatical and did not contribute to film music for 14 years. He joined All India Radio and worked for their musical productions and conducted his own concerts during this time. It was P. Bhaskaran who brought him back to film scoring. It was during this phase, which saw him score the music for 14 films, beginning with Rajamalli (1964), that Chidambaranathan made his presence felt. His magnum opus Murappennu was released in 1965. Songs like \\"Karayunno Puzha Chirikkunno\\" and \\"Kadavathu Thoniyaduthappol\\", both from this film, are considered his masterpieces. \\"Karayunno Puzha Chirikkunno\\" was described by The Hindu as one of the greatest melodies of all time in Malayalam cinema. With Murappennu, he established himself as one of the leading composers and went on to score some of the major films and hit songs in the late 1960s and 1970s. In 1968, he composed music for the film Viruthan Shanku, the first full-length comedy in Malayalam cinema directed by P. Venu. He has scored music for more than 30 Malayalam films. Most of his songs were recorded by S. Janaki and K. J. Yesudas. Vijith Nambiar learned music under his guidance. He also holds the credit for introducing playback singer P. Jayachandran (in the film Kunjali Marakkar). Most of his songs were penned by P. Bhaskaran. His association with Vayalar, which began in Kottayam Kolakase has also spawned numerous hit songs. His last work was Aramana Veedum Anjoorekkarum (1996), which he composed along with his son Rajamani. Apart from film songs, he also composed a few devotional songs and krirtis. He had also worked as a music professor in Anna University for a short period. He was honoured with the Kalaimamani award by the Tamil Nadu government. Death Chidambaranath died on 31 August 2007 at his home in Chennai. He was aged 83 at the time of his death, and was suffering from numerous age-related diseases during his last time. He is survived by six out of his seven children. His wife, Thulasi, whom he married in 1955, died on 25 August 2013, just five days short of her husband's sixth death anniversary. Rajamani, his son and another famous music director, died on 14 February 2016. His grandson Achu Rajamani is also a music composer.

The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign is a current domestic government propaganda campaign in the United States conducted by the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) within the Executive Office of the President of the United States with the goal to \\"influence the attitudes of the public and the news media with respect to drug abuse\\" and of \\"reducing and preventing drug abuse among young people in the United States\\".Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, The Media Campaign cooperates with the Partnership for a Drug-Free America and other government and non-government organizations.Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006, , codified at History The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) was originally established by the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988,National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 of the Anti–Drug Abuse Act of 1988, which mandated a national anti-drug propaganda campaign for youth.Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998, , , at These activities subsequently funded by the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998,Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1998, , formally creating the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign. The Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 codified the propaganda campaign at .Drug-Free Media Campaign Act of 1998 (Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999), , at -2752 Effects In August 2001, the office told a Congressional committee that its National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign \\"has been the most visible symbol of the federal government's commitment to drug prevention,\\" and that the office was \\"investing $7 million a year in performance measurement to determine the effectiveness\\" of the campaign. The statement said \\"We believe there is a strong body of evidence that indicates the campaign is working, as planned, to change drug attitudes, intentions and use.\\"\\"National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign: How to Ensure the Program Operates Efficiently and Effectively\\", Testimony to Congress, August 1, 2001 In 2002, according to a multi-year study by the research firm hired by the office, teenagers exposed to federal anti-drug ads were no less likely to use drugs for having viewed them, and some young girls said they were even more likely to give drugs a try. Walters blamed poor ads that weren't resonating with teenagers. Walters promised in Senate testimony in 2002 that he would show results within a year or admit failure, and Congress agreed to extend the campaign through 2003 while cutting funding for the ads from $170 million in 2002 to $150 million in 2003. An entirely new advertising campaign was created.Shawn Zeller, \\"Ads, Drugs & Money\\", Government Executive magazine, September 19, 2003 In February 2005, a research company hired by the office and the National Institute on Drug Abuse reported that the government's ad campaign aimed at dissuading teens from using marijuana, a campaign that cost $1.4 billion between 1998 and 2006, did not work: \\"greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.\\" The research company was paid $42.7 million for the five-year study. After the February 2005 report was received, the office continued the ad campaign, spending $220 million on the anti- marijuana ads in fiscal years 2005 and 2006.Ryan Grim, A White House Drug Deal Gone Bad: Sitting on the Negative Results of a Study of Anti-Marijuana Ads, Slate magazine, September 7, 2006 President Bush's goal in this campaign was to reduce youth drug use by 10% over two years, and 25% over 5 years. The National Survey of Parent and Youth (NSPY) was instituted and funded by congress to monitor and assess the NYADMC's effects on youth. Even though the advertisements themselves were only as specific as to address use of marijuana, the NSPY measurements reported alcohol consumption, binge drinking, cigarette use, and use of marijuana/hashish. The assessment consisted of multiple rounds of strategic questioning between years 2000 and 2004 to determine youths exposure to the advertisements, and behavioral patterns in relation to marijuana use. 94% of youth (ages 12.5-18) reported exposure to at least 1 anti-drug message per month. Those sampled didn't change marijuana usage over the time period measured. Youths claiming to have used marijuana within the past year in 2000 accounted for 17.1% in 2000, and dropped as little as .4% to 16.7% in 2004. However, there was a .4% increase in those claiming to have used marijuana within the past 30 days, rising from 7.8% to 8.2% between 2000 and 2004. There are also evidence of pro-marijuana lagged association effects. The rate of acceleration in use was quicker at among 14- to 18-year-olds than at earlier stages of teenage years. Not only do data indicate the ineffectiveness of much anti-drug advertising, results also point to behavioral reactions in the opposite direction, or a boomerang effect, where greater exposure to the campaign, resulted to increased use of marijuana. Of those unexposed to ads on a given month, 81% did not intend to use marijuana, That percentage decreased for youth exposed to 1-3 ads per month, to 79% and dropped to 78% among those exposed to more than 4 advertisements per month. Also measured, were attitudes such as 'anti- marijuana attitudes/beliefs' and 'anti-marijuana social norms'. Both of these index's portray declining percentages with increased exposure to ads. Anti- marijuana publicity, may have stimulated the notion that “‘everyone’s doing it,’” therefore heightenening the appeal of using marijuana, as a popular practice. The ads had an unintended positive impact on perceptions towards marijuana use as they portrayed benefits within the context of using marijuana. This association was strengthened with repeat exposure. Images that lead to such impressions included focusing on the \\"good-times\\" people were having while on drugs, happily socializing. These impressions heightened the appeal of marijuana, thus making people more likely to initiate use, or increase use. Youth's beliefs and behaviors were also affected by those of their older siblings. Since older brothers and sisters were more interested in using marijuana after seeing the ads, the campaign had an indirect effect on younger siblings as well. The NYADMC achieved some of its favorable effects with regard to reaching their message to the parents of youth. Parent's behavior and beliefs indicate greater likeliness to engage children in fun activities, talk about drugs, and responsiveness to the idea of monitoring their children's behavior. According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP), the institution that administered the campaign, the campaign was overall successful. The ONDCP's independent studies indicate that \\"youth exposed to Above the Influence are more likely to initiate drug use.\\" exposure to the ads. Another similar media initiative, called \\"Be Under Your Own Influence\\" ran from 2005 to 2009, which results indicate that it was effective, to a lesser extent than the Above the Influence campaign, which was running concurrently. The plausible explanation for this is that they already had been influenced by the ATI, such that the Be Under Your Own Influence campaign was repeating a message that had already been established. Another study found the impact of the campaign was effective on both high-sensation- seeking and low-sensation-seeking youth. The campaign launched a result- tracking initiative to comprise the Annual Analysis Report to Congress, as required by the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 2006. In 2010, the Above the Influence (ATI) message expanded from focusing primarily on marijuana, to other drugs such as methamphetamine.

Built in the Beaux Arts style, it is best known as the former headquarters of the Port of London Authority and is thus also sometimes referred to as the Port of London Authority Building. Since 2017, it has been operating as the Four Seasons Hotel London at Ten Trinity Square.  Location  As the name implies, the building is located at 10 Trinity Square, close to the River Thames, Tower Bridge, and the Tower of London, in the southeast of the City of London. It occupies the northwestern corner of Trinity Square and faces Trinity Square Gardens.  History  The Beaux Arts structure was designed by Sir Edwin Cooper and built by John Mowlem & Co in 1912–22 as the new headquarters of the Port of London Authority. It was opened by David Lloyd George, then the British Prime Minister, in 1922, in the presence of the architect and Lord Devonport, the Authority's first chairman. At the time, it was one of the city's tallest buildings. During its heyday, the building was frequented by hundreds of people each day who were paying their dues on goods landed in the port. Under a large dome supported by marble columns, the central rotunda of the building housed walnut and brass counters radiating out from a central clock. The building was badly damaged by German bombing during the Blitz in World War II; the domed rotunda was destroyed. When renovated in the 1970s, a functional rectangular office block was built to occupy the central part of the building which had been destroyed in the war, changing the effect of the originally 40 m wide courtyard in the building's centre. It was occupied as the European headquarters of insurance broker Willis Faber Limited following the relocation of the PLA to Smithfield. Willis is now based in the Willis Building in nearby Lime Street. The PLA is now based elsewhere in the City of London and at Gravesend. In 2006, 10 Trinity Square was acquired by Thomas Enterprises Inc. It was sold to a partnership of KOP Group and Reignwood in 2010. KOP lost their stake to Reignwood in 2012. It was redeveloped into a 100-room hotel with 41 private residences and a private members' club under the Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts brand known as \\"Four Seasons Hotel London at Ten Trinity Square\\". The hotel opened in 2017. As part of the renovation, archaeologists were consulted who excavated the rotunda and a public garden in Seething Lane. The site of 10 Trinity Square was previously occupied by a 17th-century building by Christopher Wren. It housed the Navy Board, the administration of the Royal Navy, and Samuel Pepys had an office there. In the 18th century, part of the site was occupied by a warehouse of the East India Company. The lowest strata revealed shards and ornaments from the time of Roman London. The building's exterior has been featured in many films and television shows, includingThe Professionals, Kavanagh QC, The Crown (TV series), and the 2012 James Bond film, Skyfall.  Description  10 Trinity Square in 2012 The façade features Corinthian columns and a large allegorical statue of Father Thames. There is a new rotunda at the centre of the hotel, but it has a much smaller dome than the original. The inner courtyard is also much smaller, reduced in area by a \\"glass box\\" building that provides space for the hotel rooms. The old board room of the Port of London Authority with its walnut paneling and rich carvings, which in 1946 hosted the reception for the first meeting of the United Nations, has been restored. The staircases feature ironwork with the Port Authority logo. Historic England describes the building as follows: \\"Large, detached, monumental building of Portland stone. Nearly square plan with entrance at canted south east corner. Plain courtyard formerly filled by large rotunda destroyed in World War II. four storeys plus basement and slated mansard treated as stone attic to end pavilions and at entrance.

History The Auckland Baptist Tabernacle was formed by Richard Shalders and 14 others in 1855 in the then fledgling colonial town of Auckland. By the late 1860s, a sizeable chapel had been built on Wellesley Street and the church flourished. In 1881, Thomas Spurgeon, son of the famous C. H. Spurgeon, accepted the role of pastor and the church rapidly outgrew first the Wellesley Street Chapel, and then the Symonds Street Choral Hall. A prominent site at the top of Queen Street was secured. Initially it was intended that the Church would face Karangahape Road but the plans were revised so it was actually constructed with the main façade on Queen Street. This meant the portico was visible from the harbour. Although one of the biggest buildings to be constructed in the city at the time, it took only one year to build from 1884-85. As well as having very good acoustics its auditorium was also the largest room in the city, able to accommodate over 1500 people. The building was opened to the wider community on May 12, 1885 where a special tithe was taken to cover the final £100, rendering the church debt free. Designed by a local architect Edmund Bell, the building was directly based on the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London and featured the same columned portico derived from the Pantheon in Rome. Thomas Spurgeon's non-identical twin brother Charles was the pastor of the Greenwich Baptist Church. As Greenwich is renowned as centre of time keeping the congregation possibly felt it was appropriate to present the Auckland Tabernacle with a clock manufactured in Greenwich. This clock is still a feature of the auditorium. One of the elders of the Baptist church who championed the construction of the Auckland Tabernacle was Charles Blomfield. Charles Blomfield was a Sign Writer and interior decorator who operated from a shop adjacent to the Tabernacle, although he is mostly known for his landscape paintings, especially of the Pink and White Terraces. The neo-classical stencil work on the ceiling of the main auditorium was done by Charles and his brother Samuel.

Albrecht Dietz (11 March 1926 – 21 March 2012) was a German entrepreneur and scientist who founded the first leasing company in Germany. He is considered to be one of the pioneers and founding fathers of the German leasing industry. His publications on economic subjects range from leasing and corporate management to institutions and evolutionary economics. Biography Albrecht Dietz was born in Dresden as the son of merchant and inventor, Albert Dietz, and the early-childhood educator, Lydia Dietz. After taking his school- leaving exam in 1944 at the Dresden Grammar School of Business and Economics he went on to study economics and law; at first at the TU Dresden and later, following the bombing of Dresden in 1945, at the University Jena from which he graduated in 1947 with a degree in Business Studies. In 1948 he became a scientific assistant to Erich Gutenberg at the Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main. He received his PhD in 1949 with a doctoral dissertation titled “Die Theorie der Overhead Costs” (The Theory of Overhead Costs ). Dietz began professional life as an auditor in 1949 at the Deutsche Revisions- und Treuhand AG in Frankfurt am Main. From 1953 he occupied diverse posts in the office machinery industry, among them a position as manager of the financial and accounting office of the German Olivetti AG, as sales director at Ankerwerke AG and as managing director at Deutsche Underwood GmbH (see also Underwood Typewriter Company). He became acquainted with easing in the United States in the late 1950s. In 1962, he founded Maschinen Miete GmbH as the managing partner. It was the first leasing company for mobile goods together with Deutsche Leasing GmbH. Dietz had become the founding father and pioneer of a successful industry. In 1971, the leasing forerunner trio, Deutsche Leasing GmbH, Maschinen Miete GmbH and Mietdienst GmbH, merged to form Deutsche Leasing AG, of which Albrecht Dietz was the CEO from 1971 until 1991. Dietz also acted as President of the German Association of Leasing Companies and played a major role in drawing up the leasing directives of German tax legislation at the beginning of the 1970s. They still form the legal basis of leasing contracts today. For some years he also was a member of the Board of Leaseurope, the European Federation of Leasing Company Associations. Since 1982 he has been teaching and researching in the areas of leasing economics, corporate management and institutional economy. He has been participating in international research seminars of the Max Planck Institute for Research into Economic Systems (today the Max Planck Institute of Economics) in Jena as an active guest since 1988.

His French wife, Colette, who later inspired much of his work on intimacy and the role a spouse or comparable intimate partner plays in it, supported his decision to follow his intuition. In 1969 he joined McKinsey and Company, an international consulting firm, as an associate in Paris. In 1972, he left consulting to become President and Co-founder of a subsidiary of Mitsubishi International Corp for mergers and acquisitions. During his fourth year in M&A;, a business colleague sought his advice on how to overcome depression. Dr. Ishizuka's rewarding experience helping his friend led him to return to the field of psychiatry in 1976. Ishizuka returned to medicine with a desire to understand what it meant to be well.  Influences  Ishizuka draws from the principles of both Zen Buddhism and quantum mechanics in his method of treatment.

R. Spiro, in 1980, in his review of the evolution of the concept of Positive Mental Health, observed that regrettably little investigations followed Jahoda’s work during the ensuing decades, citing only several related contributions : » Ishizuka turned to a monograph by M. Jahoda published in 1958 entitled « Current Concepts of Positive Mental Health.» For more see, Jahoda, M. (1958), Current Concept of Positive Mental Health, Basic Books.For more see, Jahoda, M. (1953), Toward a social psychology of mental health, In : Symposioum on the Healthy Personality. Senn MJE, (ed), New York : Josiah Macy Jr. Foundation, pp 211, 219, 220. Jahoda offered six conditions for developing and evaluating future models of Positive Mental Health.Ishizuka, Yukio (1988). ‘Lifetrack Therapy,’ Psychiatric Journal University Ottawa, Vol. 13 No. 4, pp. 199. In doing so, she pointed out the limits of the ‘disease’ model and set guidelines to define models of health applicable both in wellness and disease.Other visionaries such as A. Gregg, and W. Menninger, and more recently M. Seligman has also suggested the limits to the ‘disease’ model. For more on vision see Menninger, W.C (1947), The Role of psychiatry in the world today, Am J Psychiatry,104: 155-163. Concluding that the ‘medical’ or ‘disease model’ used in psychiatry was not fit to understand healthy human beings or to assist them in ‘normal’ or optimal functioning, Ishizuka began to build such a model. His exposure to the East,Hiranmay Karlekar, The Pioneer, 6/4/06, www.dailypioneer.com; « He draws from the principles of both Zen Buddhism and modern post-particle physics in his method of treatment. While the latter emphasises the interconnectedness of the entire universe, the former believes that a solution to human suffering lies in being one with the universe. The process becoming one with the universe begins with being better related to, and experiencing a higher level of intimacy with, one's partner or wife and requires the latter's active participation.»Dr. Yukio Ishizuka has no religious affiliation, he is agnostic. As far as the influence of Zen Buddhism, he mentions two meetings, one briefly with Gyokusen Hosaka, head of Zen University Komazawa University who wanted Ishizuka to become a practitioner (yet Ishizuka was attracted to studies in the West), and with Horyu Ishiguro, who had collaborated with the Department of Psychiatry of Tokyo University on the study of brain waves for the first time.

Quoted in his references in Lifetrack Therapy are Abraham Maslow, Karl Menninger, Marie Jahoda, David Riesman amongst others. helped him develop a model of health across different cultures. Focusing almost entirely on the experience of his diverse patients, he challenged what he knew to define a model of health and personality applicable both in extreme distress and optimal health. The three spheres: basic psychological needs and self- actualization In 1975, Dr. Ishizuka hypothesized that three basic psychological needs or spheres determine psychological health and self- actualization across cultures: the search for self, the need for intimacy, and the quest for achievement. The three spheres, also referred to as the \\"triad of psychological adjustment\\"Samuels, R. Ph.D., \\"Computer Software Review,\\" Psychotherapy in Private Practice, Spring 1986: 87. or \\"tripod of happiness\\"Peter Costa, Gannett Westchester Newspapers, Health/Science C Section, Wed, September 11, 1985 are subjective, dynamic, and broad enough to encompass all psychological events.Ishizuka, Y., « Causes of Anxiety and Depression in Marriage, » Psychiatric Ann. 9 :6, June 1979 : p. 303 « These three spheres can be visualized as converging circles, each representing a distinct area of importance but also interacting with the others (Figure 1). Sphere 1 depicts life with one’s self – being in touch with one’s feelings and at peace with one’s self. Sphere 2 covers life with important others – the intimate relationships of marriage that we are discussing here, but also with one’s parents, children, and close friends. The third sphere concerns life in the world – one’s work, career, etc. » These three interconnected spheres characterize a person's personality. A prolonged imbalance or a crisis in any one of these three key interconnected spheres of mental health influences the others and can trigger defensive symptoms such as anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression or, in some cases, psychosis.Peter Costa, \\"Psychiatrist uses computer as tool to fight depression,\\" Gannett Westchester Newspapers, Health/Science C Section, Wednesday, September 11, 1985: \\"In his so-called \\"tripod of happiness\\" model, the three spheres converge and intersect. When they are of approximately equal size, most people are happy; when one leg of this life tripod dominates, the individual can suffer imbalance and (in crisis) may topple into depression or anxiety or develop other defensive reactions like physical symptoms, he said.\\" Lifetrack Therapy: a personality model and therapy based on health To better understand and track psychological well-being, Ishizuka broke down the self, intimacy and achievement spheres into three dimensions with nine elements each. Using simple definitions and a subjective 10 point rating scale, he encouraged patients to take five to ten minutes daily to track the three spheres, as well as positive peaks of well-being (peace, friendliness, physical-health, happiness, mastery), negative peaks (anxiety, anger, physical symptoms, depression, psychosis), physical health, and proper use of food, beverage, or other substances.Costa, P., « Psychiatrist uses computer as tool to fight depression, » Gannett Westchester Newspapers, September 11, 1985, : « In the Lifetrack program, people display on a computer screen that represent 41 categories or emotional conditions, which they monitor each day. » (C1) This tripod model of mental health is the basis for Lifetrack Therapy, a clinical approach drawing on the experience and insights accumulated by the daily self- rating data of more than 1,200 patients throughout their treatment on 41 parameters of mental health through periods of crisis to optimal health.Ishizuka, Y., (2007), Lifetrack Therapy, Summary from an APA presentation Annual Meeting, San Diego, May 2007 The central goal for both the ‘distressed” and the “well” in Lifetrack Therapy is the same: health and well- being in the primary three spheres of life.Ishizuka, Y., « Personality Transformation is Therapy Objective, » Proceedings of the World Congress of Psychiatry, Spain, 1996. Therapy sessions are focused on using crisis as an opportunity to transform the three spheres far beyond a previous best level of experience.

John Garstin (1756–1820) with a fund of 700,000 Rupees raised from a lottery to provide the Europeans with a place for social gatherings. History of the Building The Town Hall in the 1860s. =1813 to 1900= The building of the Town Hall was made in Roman-Doric style in 1813. At first, the hall was placed under a committee, which allowed the public to use the hall under such terms and conditions as were fixed by the Government. The public could visit the ground floor hall to see statues and large size portrait paintings but they were not allowed indiscriminate access to the upper storey. Applications for the use of the upper storey were to be made to the committee. In 1867 Town Hall came under the management of the municipal authority, the Justices of Peace for the improvement of the town of Kolkata (later on the Calcutta Corporation). In the 1870s, at the time of the Chief Justice Richard Couch, when the present building of the High Court was being built, the Town Hall was temporarily used for judicial purposes. In 1871, one of the Puisne Judges, Sir John Paxton Norman was assassinated by a fanatic Muslim of the Wahabi sect, while coming down the steps of the Town Hall. In the year of 1897 the Town Hall had been renovated at a cost of about Rs. 1.126 million. =1900 to 1947= In 1914 almost all the marble statues except the statue of Ramanath Tagore have been shifted to Victoria Memorial. After the introduction of the Dyarchy in 1919, the Town Hall was used as the council chamber of the Bengal Legislative Council. The interior of the Hall was remodeled to suit the needs of the Council. The President of the Council had his chamber in the Town Hall. Subsequently, the Legislative Council moved to its new building in 1931.https://sites.google.com/site/kolkatatownhall/Home/menu During the Second World War, the government temporarily opened a Rationing Office in the Hall. =Post Independence= After Independence, the Town Hall Building was largely neglected, during the early days of independence, during the 'Socialist Era' of early independence and seems to have been steadily consigned to collective oblivion. It was converted into the Municipal Magistrate’s Office. Other branches of the Corporation were accommodated within its premises. The Municipal Service Commission and the West Bengal Public Service Commission also occupied parts of the building. In 1975, all marble busts along with some portrait paintings were shifted to the Victoria Memorial Hall except the busts of Greenlaw and Palmer. The rest numbers of portrait paintings had also been shifted to Central Municipal Office building leaving two portrait paintings of Ryan and Nott at Town Hall. Gradually this magnificent building with rich heritage was sunk into oblivion. In 1998 by timely intervention of the ASI and the Calcutta High Court this heritage building was saved from further damage and destruction. And was later renovated to its former glory, and is now used for public gatherings and functions. Town Hall Town Hall Library In 1999, Corporation purchased the entire collection of rare books and journals on Kolkata from the noted Kolkata expert P. T. Nair to form a reference library. In 2004, the library was formally opened by the then Minister of Library Services, Nimai Mal in a small function presided over by the then Mayor Subrata Mukherjee. In 2007, the entire reference library of the Corporation has been amalgamated with the Town Hall Library. Now the library possesses about 12,000 books and journals and is visited by many scholars from different corners of India and abroad.

Kolkata Museum Town Hall at night The Kolkata Museum was set up in 1995 by a joint initiative of Kolkata Municipal Corporation and Government of West Bengal. It depicts the History of the City of Kolkata, and the adjoining metropolis. It was made by the Kolkata Museum society, members of which included renowned historians, museologists and administrators of this metropolis. Kolkata Museum is a story- telling media exhibit on the history of the city of Kolkata, financed by Kolkata Municipal Corporation, Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority, Department of Information & Culture of the Government of West Bengal and Ford Foundation. Divided in 19 enclaves and covering an area of 1200 sq mt, the exhibit depicts the story of Kolkata, its social and political history, tumultuous freedom movement, its creative efforts in the domains of education, literature, music, performing art, science and technology. The communication technology involves animated walk-through dioramas where visitors walk through the streets of early Kolkata or witnesses the high drama of the Battle of Plassey right at the centre of the battle field. Fully computerised circarama where a 12 minutes story of India’s freedom movement is projected on a large circular screen surrounding the visitors; it takes the help of animatronics where visitors witness poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore reciting 'Bharat Tirtha' and singing 'Tobu Mone Rekho'. Dramatic events of the Golden Time (1856–61) or the trauma of the 1940s are also projected. Visitors can listen to old popular music of the bygone days through audio isolators avoiding interference with others or choose to view selected clippings of the films of people like Pramathesh Barua, Debaki Bose, Madhu Bose, Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, Ritwik Ghatak and others. Popular culture The town hall is a very famous and important landmark of Kolkata. During the British Raj the town hall was the most important place for social gatherings in Calcutta and many important state functions of the British East India Company were held here. The hall has been witness to many historic proclamations and events during the 19th and 20th century. It was considered an elite place for public gatherings by the Europeans. Nowadays, many functions of the Government of West Bengal are held here. The town hall was featured on the sixth leg of The Amazing Race 18, when the teams had to compete in a tea-drinking \\"Roadblock\\".

Over the next 3 years, he lost 70lbs and earned his pro card to race on the 2010 ITU season, racing under the flag of Egypt and the Egyptian Triathlon Federation (ETF). Nour raced professionally from 2010 – 2016, under coach, Neal Henderson out of Boulder, Colorado.

Nour and Samra were rescued, in Great White Shark hunting territory, many hours later by a cargo ship. In May 2018, Nour and Samra announced Beyond the Raging Sea, a film by director Marco Orsini about their attempt to cross the Atlantic.

They belong to the Gautama gotra; they originate from and are mainly based in Kodagu (Coorg), Karnataka, a state in South India. They are from Kukke which was part of Amara Sulya district, formerly in the old kingdom of Kodagu. Origins of Cukkemane Many centuries ago, a Brahmin family of Gautama gotra from Sagara taluka in Shimoga (Shivamogga) district in Karnataka migrated to the hamlet Saravu in Kodapadavu village in Bantwal taluk of Dakshina Kannada district. During a particular point in history, there was no male heir to continue the family. The then family members went to the Kukke Subramanya Temple & prayed to Subramanya to bless them with a male heir. They brought home a Shiva Linga for daily worship from the temple. Within the same temple complex, they also sought the blessings of Lakshmi Narasimha, with an assurance to him, that he would be the kuladevaru or Kuldevta of the family henceforth. A male heir was thus born and the family continued. Then on the descendants of this family identified themselves as belonging to Cukkemane or Kukkemane deriving it from \\"Kukke\\" - the name of Subramanya & \\"Mane\\" – which in Kannada means house, therefore the name meant the House of the Kukke Subramanya. Prior to accepting Lakshmi Narasimha as the Cukkemane family deity, Goddess Sri Durgaparmeshwari was the Kuladevaru or the family deity. Therefore, even today some members of the Cukkemane in Saravu, worship Lakshmi Narasimha as the Mane Devaru - God of the House, at noon and Goddess Sri Durgaparameshwari as the kuladevaru – God of the Clan or family, at night. History and myth and fact It is said that centuries ago one of the ancestors of Cukkemane, was a staunch devotee of Shiva and possessed a Shivalinga & worshipped it with a great devotion. As he sensed his life on earth nearing an end, he was worried as to who would perform the daily rituals and care for them at all times as he did. Possessed with this thought, he decided to install this shivalinga in the garbha gudi – the sanctum sanctorum of the Subramanya in the Kukke Subramanya Temple. Having done so, when his time came, he died, content with the knowledge that they would be well taken care of. However, many years later, some jealous elements, made of with the linga and it was not found for some centuries, until about 250–150 years ago it was found in the forest behind the Kukke Subramanya Temple, and re-installed. However, certain sections do not agree with the earlier part of the story and just reiterate that the latter part of it, about the idol being found in the forest is true and that nothing else is associated with it. Yet, many members of the Cukkemane family pay a yearly visit to the Temple and perform prescribed rituals for Subramanya along with this particular Shivalinga believing it to be installed there by their forefather. Rituals are also performed for Lakshmi Narasimha and Adishesha. Caste, language and belief The Cukkemanes belong to the Havyaka Brahminhttp://www.srimath.org/ community of Hinduism & speak mainly in Hosa (new) Kannada as spoken in Bangalore, Mysore etc. and Havigannada (Havyaka Kannada) dialects. They belong to the Gautama gotra. They further follow and perform the rituals as per the Yajurveda among the four veda - the holy scriptures of the Hindus & are followers of the Advaita philosophy propounded by Sri Adi Shankaracharya. Among the Math they follow the Ramachandrapura Math and Pontiff head of the Math, Shree Shree Raghaveshwara Bharathi Mahaswamiji is the Kulaguru - the divine mentor, teacher & instructor to the family as to many other Havyaka families as well.

He lost his life near Nombre de Dios, Panama, a few weeks before Drake's own death. Birth and Marriage John Marchant was born on 18 July 1540 in Yeovil, Somerset, England. He was married to Eva Cominge in July 1568, in Yeovil. His son, John Marchant II, was born in Yeovil in September 1571. Early Adventures with Drake (1585-86) In 1585, Captain John Marchant, along with Anthony Platt, was listed as one of ten Captains of companies serving under Sir Francis Drake in the expedition of that year. “Platt and Marchant became staunch adherents of Drake, the latter [Marchant] being Sergeant-Major to the Cadiz expedition in 1587, and both perished in the expedition of 1595.” Captain Marchant served aboard the Hopewell during the 1585-86 expedition, in which Sir Drake captured from the Spanish A) Santiago, in the Cape Verde Islands west of Africa; B) Santo Domingo, in Hispaniola; and C) Cartagena, in Colombia. After this string of victories, Drake and Marchant sacked and burned St. Augustine, Florida. On the way back up the Atlantic Coast, Drake and Marchant stopped at Roanoke Island, where a colony begun by Sir Walter Raleigh the year before had fallen on hard times. The colonists (all of them lonely men) decided to return with Drake to England. Raid on Cadiz (1587) The Spanish Armada was amassing through 1587, preparing for an all-out assault on England. Drake raised 24 ships and headed to Cadiz, Spain, for a preemptive strike. By this time, John Marchant was Sergeant-Major in Drake's navy, serving on the Golden Lyon. Drake's forces routed the ships in Cadiz Harbour; Drake then decided to take the Castle of Sagres, near Cape St. Vincent. His second-in-command, William Borough, was an older naval officer who considered Drake to be not much more than a glorified pirate. He refused to help Drake take Sagres, and was arrested for his insubordination and held aboard the Golden Lyon. Captain Marchant thus came into command of this ship. After Drake captured Sagres, his ships were separated by a storm. He soon discovered that the Lyon had deserted; Capt. Marchant was found aboard the Spy, having had to evacuate the Lyon. Marchant reported that Borough had inspired a mutiny aboard the Lyon., and although the ship was on its way back to England and out of his reach, Drake called a court-martial and sentenced Borough to death. Borough was eventually tried and found not-guilty, blaming the whole affair on Capt. Marchant: “Mr. Marchant used no resistance by force and violence to withstand their purpose (which he ought to have done). . . the authority of government was wholly committed to the said Captain Marchant. . .” Last voyage with Drake (1595) Marchant accompanied Drake on his ill- fated voyage in 1595, in which both lost their lives. After failing in an attempt to seize a Spanish treasure ship in Puerto Rico, Drake moved on to Panama and took the town of Nombre de Dios (Sp.: “Name of God”), near the modern-day Panama Canal, hoping to intercept the Spanish bringing gold from Peru over the isthmus. On 2 January 1596, Drake's forces marched up a hill only to discover at the last minute that the Spanish had hidden a fort on top of it. Twenty-some Englishmen were killed, including “Quarter-master Generall” Marchant. Three weeks later, Sir Francis Drake himself succumbed to dysentery, and was buried at sea, in a lead coffin. Capt. Marchant was likely buried at the site of his death, in Panama.

It is notable as a trade hub and for its substantial population of Burmese migrants and refugees. The city is part of Tak Province, 87 km from the city of Tak and 492 km from Bangkok. It is home to the district headquarters of Mae Sot District, and is the main gateway between Thailand and Burma. As a result, it has gained notoriety for its trade in gems and teak, as well as black market services such as people trafficking and drugs. History In 1937 Mae Sot was a local administration, administered by a headman, usually called village headman or village chief ( phu yai ban), Its population at the time was approximately 12,000 people. On 30 September 1939 Mae Sot was established as a municipality and governed 27 villages. It was upgraded to a city municipality in 2010. Geography Neighboring districts are Mae Pa tambon administrative organization (TAO) in the north; Mae Tao (TAO) to the south; Mae Pa and Phra That Pha Daeng (TAO) to the east; and Tha Sai Luat Sub-district Municipality to the west.  Economy  Rim Moei Market Trade with Burma constitutes the largest portion of Mae Sot's economy. It has an established market for commodities such as wholesale gems and teak. Most of the town's service industries are supported by Burmese migrants who work in sweat-shops and factories throughout the region. The town also suffers from a black market in illegal smuggling, people trafficking, and narcotics. The Thai-Myanmar Friendship Bridge is the primary gateway for trade with Burma. The border region, several kilometres west from central Mae Sot, includes the Rim Moei Market that deals in imported goods and woodwork. Gen Prayut Chan-o- cha, the junta leader and prime minister, in May 2015 invoked his authority under Section 44 of the Interim Charter to declare the area of Wang Takhian in Tha Sai Luat subdistrict of Mae Sot a special economic zone (SEZ). The current plan is to transform nearly 2,200 rai of land of Tha Sai Luat into an SEZ. The government has offered to compensate displaced villagers at 7,000-12,000 baht per rai of land and resettle villagers in another district of Tak. the current market price of a rai of land in Mae Sot is almost one million baht, leading villagers to reject the offer. Climate Mae Sot has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification Aw). Winters are dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from May to October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

This species is endemic to New Zealand, where it is known from both the North and South Islands as far south as mid-Canterbury. Larvae of this species feed on the soft inner surface of the bark of dead trees and shrubs. Adults have been recorded from September to December.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Francis Walker in 1864 from specimens obtained by Colonel D. Bolton in Auckland and Mr Sinclair. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1888 Edward Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, named this moth Semiocosma platyptera. The lectotype for this description was collected by George Hudson in Wellington and is also held at the Natural History Museum, London. In 1915 Meyrick synonymised this name with I. attactella. This synonymy was upheld by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2010. Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in his book The butterflies and moths of New Zealand. Alfred Philpott studied and published on the male genitalia of this species in 1927.  Description  Izatha attactella larva Hudson described the larvae of this species as being about in. long when fully grown. The head is dark brown and shiny while the body is white. The pupa is pale ochreous in colour with a brown tinge to the head and lower portion of the pupa. It is enclosed in an oval cocoon made from silk and pieces of chewed bark. Izatha attactella pupa Walker described the adults of the species as follows: The wingspan 24.5–38 mm for males and 22–36 mm for females. I. attactella resembles I. voluptuosa but can be distinguished from the latter by having a narrow forewing, a paler hind wing, more obvious scale tufts and a longer dark basal streak. I. attactella is also on the wing earlier in the season in September to December with I. voluptuosa being present in the later months of November to February.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. I. attactella is widespread and present in both the North and South Islands but in the latter only as far as mid Canterbury. This species has been recorded in the following locations: Northland, Auckland, Coromandel, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Taupo, Hawkes Bay, Rangitikei, Wellington, Marlborough Sounds, Nelson, Buller, Marlborough and mid Canterbury.  Behaviour and life cycle  Pupation takes place under the bark in the above described oval silk and chewed wood cocoon. Adults are on wing from September to December. However in the South Island occasional specimens appear in December and January. When reared in captivity in the North Island this species emerges from July onwards. This species does not come readily to light in large numbers.  Habitat and host species  Host species Elaeocarpus dentatus Larvae have been reported feeding under the bark of dead Elaeocarpus dentatus, Aristotelia serrata, Nothofagus, Myoporum laetum and Rhopalostylis sapida. Larvae feed on the soft inner surface of the bark. This species has also been recorded from dead wood of Castanea, Litsea calicaris, Olearia paniculata, Pinus patula, Pinus radiata and Sophora species. In Auckland, larvae have been recorded as feeding on dead rotten wood laying on the ground.

The railway was opened in several stages between 1828 and 1861. The section between Saint-Étienne and Saint-Just-sur-Loire was the first railway line in France. It has functioned as an alternative (but longer) line for the Paris–Marseille railway between Paris and Lyon. Its main use, besides local traffic, is now for the connection between Paris and Clermont-Ferrand. Route The line branches off the Paris–Marseille railway at the Gare de Moret-Veneux-les-Sablons, and leaves in a southwestern direction. It follows the river Loing upstream, turning south near Nemours and passing through Montargis, where it leaves the Loing. At Gien it starts following the river Loire upstream along its right bank, in a generally southern direction. It passes through Cosne-sur-Loire, and the railway junction Nevers, where it crosses the Loire. At Saincaize the line to Bourges branches off. From Saincaize, the line follows the right Allier bank south. It passes through Moulins. At Saint-Germain-des-Fossés two lines to Clermont-Ferrand (one via Gannat, one via Vichy) branch off. The Moret–Lyon railway leaves the Allier and turns east. It passes through the Monts de la Madeleine, northern foothills of the Massif Central. It crosses the Loire between Roanne and Le Coteau, where the shorter line to Lyon via Tarare branches off. This is where the oldest section of the line starts. It continues south, parallel to the Loire, passing through Feurs and along Andrézieux-Bouthéon, where it meets the line from Clermont-Ferrand via Montbrison. At Saint-Étienne the line from Le Puy-en-Velay joins, and the line continues northeast through Saint-Chamond and Rive-de-Gier. At Givors on the river Rhône it turns north, finally arriving in Lyon after 492 km. =Main stations= The main stations on the Moret–Lyon railway are: * Gare de Moret-Veneux-les-Sablons * Gare de Nevers * Gare de Roanne * Gare de Saint-Étienne-Châteaucreux * Gare de Lyon-Perrache History The first railways that were opened in France were primarily meant for freight traffic in the mining area around the industrial city Saint- Étienne. These railways were united in the Compagnie du chemin de fer Grand- Central de France in 1853, and at the dissolution of that company in 1857 the eastern part of the Grand-Central network was bought by the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée. The first section of the Moret–Lyon railway that was opened in 1828 led from Saint-Étienne to Saint-Just-sur-Loire. Saint- Étienne and Lyon were connected between 1830 and 1833. In 1834 the line was extended in northern direction from Saint-Just to Le Coteau, near Roanne. In 1850 a line from Nevers to Saincaize was built. This section was extended south to Varennes-sur-Allier in 1853, to Saint-Germain-des-Fossés in 1854 and to Lapalisse in 1857. Lapalisse and Le Coteau were connected in 1858. In the north, Moret-Veneux-les-Sablons on the Paris–Marseille railway was connected to Montargis in 1860. Finally in 1861 the section from Montargis to Nevers was opened.

In Russian  Early days  He was the son of Illig Qaghan, ruler of the Eastern Turkic Khaganate and spent his early years there. In 627, he was assigned to suppress a rebellion around Tien shan but was defeated and fled.  Invitation from the West  After the death of Tong of the Western Turkic Khanate in 628, the central authority of the khagans among the West Turks was challenged by the leaders of the ten tribes collectively known as Onok.Sina Akşin (ed.)-Ümit Hassan: Osmanlı Devletine kadar Türkler Cem Yayınevi, İstanbul, 2009 p.634 However there was also a competition between the two wings of Onok; i.e., the Dulu and the Nushibi . Ishbara Tolis who became the khagan in 634 tried to increase his authority by the support of Nushibi. But his camp was raided and he had to escape to Fergana (in modern Uzbekistan).S.G.Klyashtorny-TI.Sultanov:Türkün Üçbin yılı (trans Ahsen Batur) Selenge Yayınları, İstanbul2003, p 104 But even after his escape, the leaders of the ten tribes preferred a khagan from the Ashina house to maintain the delicate balance between the two wings. Yukuk’s name was proposed by a certain Tun Tudun. Yukuk whose father’s territory had long been lost readily accepted the invitation. But it soon turned out that although he was welcome by Dulu, Nushibi tribes opposed him.  Yukuk as a khagan  After a civil war between the two wings of the Onok, Ili River became the border line between the Nushibi (the south of the river) and the Dulu (north of the river) by the Ili river treaty in 638. Yukuk assumed the title Yipi Duolu Khagan and became the khagan of the north side. By 641, Yukuk consolidated most tribes between the Ili River and Siberia (including those not a part of Onok group) under his rule. Still he wanted to control southern side as well. He managed to have Ishbara Tolis murdered in 639. Ishbara's successor El Kulug Shad (乙屈利失乙毗可汗) he died soon and followed by Irbis Ishbara Yabgu Khagan (ruled 640–641) who sent governors to the Tarim Basin, Tashkent, Samarkand and Bactria.Baumer, History of Central Asia, 2,205 Yukuk soon managed to have him murdered as well. He then conquered Tuhuoluo (吐火羅; i.e. Bactrian-speaking Tokharoi), he attacked Yiwu in 642, which had by now been converted into Tang's Yi Prefecture (伊州), although his attacks were repelled by the Tang general Guo Xiaoke (郭孝恪). In 642, he began to suffer dissent within, as he was said to have hoarded the spoils from attacks on Kangju and Mi (米, a state on the Amu Darya) and refused to divide them with his subordinates — and when one of his generals, Ashina Nishou (阿史那泥熟) nevertheless seized some, Ashina Yugu executed him, causing Ashina Nishou's subordinate Huluwu (胡祿屋) to rebel. The rebels sought aid from Tang, and Emperor Taizong created El Kulug Shad's son as Irbis Sheguy khagan. Yukuk initially prevailed in battle against Yipishekui Khan, but the rebels refused to submit despite the defeats, and Yukuk eventually withdrew and took up position in former Tuhuoluo territory.  Later years  New khagan initially attacked Yukuk and forced him to escape to Isfijab (Sayram in modern Kazakhstan). They further laid a siege on Isfijab . But although Yukuk got no help from Tulu tribes he managed to defeat them. After this victory, Yukuk tried to regain Tulu support. But Tulo leaders rejected his proposal. Yukuk, feeling insecure without tribal support, escaped to Kunduz (in modern Afghanistan) in 642Lev Nikolayeviç Gumilev: Eski Türkler (trans:D.Ahsen Batur), Selenge Yayınları, İstanbul, 2002, pp.273-275 . He spent the rest of his life in Kunduz and died in 653. His heir was Zhenzhu Yabgu, who was one of the last representatives of the family. But his authority was limited to a single city.

Frans was the youngest of seven children born to a municipal employee, Johannes Carolus Oerder. His father felt that art as a career was foolish, but agreed to his training as a decorator. From 1880 to 1885, Oerder studied art at the Rotterdam Academy, winning the King William III Gold Medal and Bursary, later touring in Italy and studying in Brussels under Ernest Blanc-Garin (1843–1916) with the help of a small inheritance from his father.http://www.the-art-world.com/history/oh_oerder.htm Following his brother, he emigrated to South Africa in 1890, and initially worked as house painter and decorator for the firm of De Wyn & Engelenburg. Pressed by a shortage of work he entered the employ of the Zuid-Afrikaansche Spoorweg Maatschappij and painted poles along the Delagoa Bay railway line. In the 1890s, Oerder was, along with Anton van Wouw and James Smith Moreland in Cape Town, one of only three artists in South Africa with recognised professional training. In 1894, he took up the position of art teacher at the Staatsmeisjesskool, which later became the Pretoria High School for Girls and at the same time rented a studio in Church Street East. He eked out a living by drawing newspaper cartoons and helping Anton van Wouw with commissions. A frequent visitor to the studio during this period was one of his art students, Pierneef. In 1896, Oerder went on a painting holiday to Zululand, and arranged an exhibition of his work in Cape Town. With the outbreak of the Anglo-Boer War in 1899, he was appointed official war artist by President Paul Kruger. His sketches and paintings from this bitter period are held at the War Museum in Bloemfontein, the Africana Museum in Johannesburg and the art collection of the University of Pretoria. In 1903, after the war, and no doubt still remembering his Zululand trip, Oerder travelled and painted along the East African coast, contracting malaria during the trip. He was elected a member of the South African Society of Artists in 1905, and with the tide finally turning in his favour, received several commissions to paint landscapes and portraits, such as that of General Louis Botha. He found conditions difficult in postwar South Africa and in 1908 returned to the Netherlands via Italy. At first he settled in Brabant, but later moved to Amsterdam where he married a fellow painter, Gerda Pitlo, in 1910. Her interest in flower painting influenced him and he started on still life compositions, especially flower studies. His painting Magnolias was sold to the New York Graphic Society, becoming one of the most popular images ever and reproductions of this still life achieved record sales for the Society, Oerder receiving no royalties whatever.Art and Artists of South Africa - Esme Berman (Balkema 1970)http://www.rogerarts.com/artists/Oerder/oerderdiscr.htm Oerder hadn't forgotten his ties to South Africa, and occasionally carried out commissions such as designing covers for the weekly magazine, Die Brandwag, and arranging an exhibition in Johannesburg. He eventually returned to Pretoria with his wife in 1938. His work by now was widely acclaimed, and in a grand gesture the tower-room of the Pretoria City Hall was made available to him for use as a studio. Here he painted several important portraits, including that of Jan Smuts. He now had the time and inclination to travel and paint in the Cape Province, Natal and the Northern Transvaal. Complications following on a bout of pneumonia left him debilitated, and he died in Pretoria in 1944. Throughout his career he had divided his output fairly evenly between landscape, portrait and still-life, with the Dutch influence always apparent.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy and etymology  This species was described by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2010. I. voluptuosa was first collected by George Hudson at Ohakune in January 1912. However the species was misidentified. Hudson illustrated the species in his 1928 book The butterflies & moths of New Zealand. The holotype specimen is held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. This species is, along with the species I. attactella and I. blepharidota, monophyletic. The epithet is obtained from the Latin word voluptuosus and refers to the large size and broad wings of the female of this species. Description  The larvae of I. voluptuose have yet to be described. The wingspan is 29–31 mm for males and 33–40 mm for females. The female of this species has the greatest wingspan of gelechioid moths in New Zealand. The species appears similar to I. attactella and I. blepharidota. I. voluptuose can be distinguished from I. attactella as I. voluptuose has a wider forewing, has less conspicuous scale-tufts, and a shorter dark basal streak. I. voluptuose is also generally on the wing later in the season and in the male of that species the hook-like teeth on the right lobe of the phallus are backward pointing. I. voluptuose can be distinguished from I. blepharidota as the veins on the forewings of I. voluptuosa are similar to the colour of the rest of the wing.  Distribution  It is endemic to New Zealand. It is known from scattered localities in North Island in the following areas: Northland, Auckland, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Taupo and Rangitikei.  Biology and behaviour  Adults are on wing from November to February with the moths being most prevalent in January and February.

P. Snow's series of novels Strangers and Brothers, and the third to be published. It depicts the beginning of Lewis Eliot's life, with a childhood in poverty in a small English town at the beginning of the 20th century. Plot synopsis Lewis Eliot is walking home in the summer of 1914 when he is struck by an intuition of disaster, and he runs back home to find his mother having her fortune told with cards. At first he is reassured by the peaceful scene, but his Aunt Milly is scornful when she sees this, and he soon learns that his father has gone bankrupt. Over the next few years, the family's lifestyle is constrained, and his mother dies of heart failure in her late forties. Eliot has promised his mother to make something of himself. He works hard, befriends lawyers (including George Passant, whose story is told in the second book) and plans to become a solicitor. However, one of his aunts leaves him a sum of money which is just enough to allow him to study to become a barrister. This is a dangerous thing to attempt, but he succeeds in his examinations, and moves to London. With great labour, he staves off illness and begins his practice, but his life is disrupted by his courting of Sheila Knight, an unstable woman who does not love him. He recognises that they are not suited for each other, but he is determined to marry her, and he frightens away another man, whom she is fond of, by telling him about her difficult personality. Eventually Lewis and Sheila marry. Sheila's unhappiness and unpredictability damage his social life, and he comes to the conclusion that he is unlikely to succeed either in his marriage or in his profession. Reception In a 1950 book review in Kirkus Reviews the book was called \\"A book of introspective portraiture rather than a novel of action—this is the almost slow-motion story of the development of Lewis Eliot... A portrait of the times—highlighted rather than rounded canvas—this story leaves an odd impression of detachment, emotionally-an almost coldly analytical dissection. Better written than the average modern novel—it yet fails to capture the heart of the reader. The link with its predecessor, The Light and the Dark is in the person of Lewis Eliot, narrator in that novel of a period just beyond that encompassed in Time of Hope. Not for a wide market.\\" References 1949 British novels English novels British political novels Novels by C. P.

Euclideon is also the parent company and operator of Holoverse, a 'holographic entertainment centre' located on the Gold Coast, in Queensland, Australia. Euclideon claims that Unlimited Detail is based on a point cloud search engine indexing system and that the technology can provide 'unlimited graphics power', proposing it as a replacement for polygon-based rendering. In 2010 Euclideon was the recipient of approximately $2 million, the largest grant awarded by the Australian Federal Government under its new Commercialisation Australia initiative. The funds provided by the grant are meant to support the implementation of multi- platform functionality, allowing Euclideon's technology to run on a variety of hardware platforms, including mobile phones and game consoles. Unlimited Detail Unlimited Detail is described by Euclideon as a form of point cloud Search engine indexing system, which uses a large number of individual points to create models, instead of a more traditional polygon mesh. According to their description, the engine uses a search algorithm to determine which of these points are visible on-screen, and then displays only these points. On a 1024 × 768 display, for example, the engine would display only 786,432 visible points in each frame. As the engine is displaying the same number of points in every frame, the level of geometric detail provided is limited only by the amount of hard-drive space needed to store the point cloud data, and the rendering speed is limited only by the screen resolution. Euclideon have previously described their technique as being a voxel rasterizer, but decided to use their own terminology such as \\"3D atoms\\" and \\"point cloud\\", saying that \\"that word [voxels] doesn't have the prestige in the games industry that it enjoys in medicine and the sciences\\". = History = The project was first showcased at the Australian Game Developers Conference in 2003. In 2011, Euclideon gained worldwide attention online when it released a number of video demos showcasing its 'Unlimited Detail' technology, attracting both skepticism and interest from the gaming press. Minecraft developer Markus Persson was critical of the demos, arguing that Euclideon portrays the software as \\"revolutionary\\" while it may suffer the same limitations as existing voxel renderers. John Carmack said the technology has no chance of a game on current gen systems, but maybe several years from now. and Crytek's Cevat Yerli called the technology \\"definitely credible.\\" Euclideon later released several interviews with CEO Bruce Dell responding to critics' concerns. In September 2012 Bruce Dell filed a patent describing the rendering algorithm said to be used in Euclideon's software. The patent application was published on 27 March 2014. The Unlimited Detail Engine was noted in a review of DigiDoc Scotland by CyArk, as \\"incredible\\" and \\"game changing\\". Shortly after, Euclideon was a sponsor and attendee at ILMF in Denver, 11–13 February 2013, showcasing Unlimited Detail enabled products. In May 2013, another demonstration of the capabilities of the Euclideon 3D Engine showcases the Geoverse, where geospatial use is highlighted with the newly offered SDK.http://www.hardocp.com/news/2013/06/06/euclideon_unlimited_detail_technology_status_update/ Euclideon Unlimited Detail Technology Status Updatehttp://www.ausgamers.com/news/read/3310845/euclideon-point-cloud- rendering-tech-resurfaces-with-focus-on-geospatial-industry Euclideon Point Cloud Rendering Tech Resurfaces with Focus on Geospatial Industryhttp://www.pcgameshardware.de/Neue-Technologien- Thema-71240/News/Unlimited-Detail-Engine-Neues-Video-Engine-ohne- Polygone-1071125/ Unlimited-Detail-Engine: Neues Video von der vielversprechenden Engine ohne Polygone In June 2013 a former employee of Euclidean claimed that a significant number of staff were let go, mentioning that clients were very impressed with Euclideon's technology and that plans are in place to develop the Infinite Detail engine to \\"a stage where it could eventually be utilised for games\\".http://www.kotaku.com.au/2013/06/inside- euclideon-a-significant-portion-of-staff-let-go-but-infinite-detail-still- exists/ Inside Euclideon: A Significant Number of Staff Let Go, But 'Infinite Detail' Still Exists Euclideon appeared again in 2014 with a new video on their YouTube channel showcasing their solid laser scan technology and announced that they are currently working on 2 games and plan to open a gaming division in 2015.http://techreport.com/review/27103/euclideon-preps-voxel- rendering-tech-for-use-in-games Euclideon preps voxel rendering tech for use in gamesEuclideon Makes World’s Most Realistic Graphics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AvCxa9Y9NU In 2016 Euclideon released another video in which it shows a \\"revolutionary\\" take on the VR (virtual Reality) market claiming to have created real life hologram rooms.

In July 2020, Euclideon released udStream, a 3D data visualisation tool aimed at geospatial users. The product was released on a freemium model, offering capped levels of data storage to entry-level customers. Geoverse Suite Geoverse Suite is intended to allow users to view terabytes of point cloud data from laser scans of cities and terrain. The point cloud is intended to be viewable within a second of the file being loaded, and at high frame rate. It is stated that as opposed to be loaded into RAM, the data is streamed from a local hard drive or it can be streamed from a USB drive or over a network connection. The Geoverse Suite currently contains two software products - Geoverse Massive Data Manager (Geoverse MDM) and Geoverse Convert. The software requirements for Geoverse MDM recommend 2 GiB of RAM. Geoverse Convert is the tool that is used to convert typical mesh and point cloud formats into Euclideon's proprietary streamable UDS (Unlimited Detail Data Set) format. Geoverse MDM allows users to view these UDS files using the Unlimited Detail technology. UDS files may be streamed from external servers or the internet without having to first download the files. It also contains standard industry features such as placing bookmarks, labels and taking measurements. On 30 September 2013 - Merrick & Company (a $116 million geospatial technology firm), announced that it has signed an agreement with Euclideon to distribute the Geoverse software product line with North America.http://www.gisuser.com/content/view/31035/2/ Merrick & Company Announces Business Partnership with Euclideon In July 2013 - the Austrian company Meixner Imaging GmbH, part of Meixner Group - one of Europe's leading geospatial companies, have signed an agreement that appoints Meixner as the premium distributor for Geoverse software throughout Europe. Solidscan Solidscan is the latest software available to the public for purchase. Solidscan 'converts a laser scan into a solid, photo-realistic representation of the real world.' Solidscan's technology significantly improves the visual quality of laser scanner data (which typically appears as a sparse array of points) while still keeping the dimensions of objects true- to-life. Web streaming technology In 2014, Euclideon released its first demo available for the public in the form of a web viewer. Codenamed 'udWeb', the technology allows users browsing using the Google Chrome browser to stream multi-gigabyte point cloud models through to their browser without a plugin. The demonstration appeared to be faster than traditional streaming approaches but no product has been released and the demo was taken down. Holoverse  In June 2016, the company opened Holoverse, a 'holographic entertainment centre' in Southport funded by a grant from the Federal Government along with private equity, allowing visitors to step into hologram rooms and be \\"transported to other worlds\\". In March 2017 the Gold Coast Bulletin announced that Euclideon will be opening numerous Holoverse centers around the world with the next center opening in Oman. In November 2018, Euclideon announced that they will be opening their second Holoverse location in Muscat, Oman.

It is endemic to New Zealand. The larvae of this species feed on dead wood by tunnelling into branches of its host species. The larvae matures from September and is on the wing in the months of December to January. The adult moth is variable in colouration but is seldom observed.  Taxonomy  I. austera was first described, as Semiocosma austera, by Edward Meyrick in 1883, in brief, and again in greater detail in 1884. Meyrick used two specimens collected in the Botanic Garden and forest in Wellington in January. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species in 1928.  Description  Izatha austera larva Hudson described the larvae as follows: Meyrick described the adults of the species as follows: The wingspan is 13–19 mm for males and 16.5–25 mm for females. This species is variable in its forewing colouration. I. austera also has noticeable scale-tufts on its forewing. It can be confused with I. dasydisca but the male can be distinguished as it has blackish coloured antennae, a scale-tuft on the third segment of the labial palp, and lacks the pair of large scale-tufts that I. dasydisca has on its forewings.  Distribution  I. austera is endemic to New Zealand. This species is widespread throughout the North Island, with a single South Island record from north-west Nelson. This species is present in Northland, Auckland, Coromandel, Waikato, Bay of Plenty, Taranaki, Taupo, Gisborne, Hawkes Bay, Rangitikei, Wellington and Nelson districts.  Biology and behaviour  Host plant Coprosma grandifolia Larvae live in silken tubes under the bark of dead branches of its host species. The larvae live during winter months and are mature by the end of September. Adults are on wing from December to February. This species have been collected via sugar traps or by beating shrubs during the daytime. I. austera only comes sparing to light. When resting on bare tree trunks the adult moth is very inconspicuous.  Habitat and host species  Larvae feed during the winter in dead wood, including moist logs on the forest floor, and drier standing dead wood. They have been recorded from dead branches of Aristotelia serrata, Coprosma grandifolia and probably Coprosma robusta, Cordyline australis, Coriaria arborea, Laurelia novae-zelandiae, Litsea calicaris, Melicytus ramiflorus and Olearia rani. They tunnel into the wood and produce copious frass, which is often conspicuous on the outside of the affected branch. Many larvae often occur together in a single branch or log.

Kennington (Tate online). He was a founder member and first secretary of the New English Art Club (from 1886), and also founded the Imperial Arts League, whose stated purpose was to \\"protect and promote the interests of Artists and to inform, advise and assist....\\"The Artists' League of Great Britain (formerly the Imperial Arts League (National Archives). He won a bronze medal at the Exposition Universelle of 1889. Kennington became known not only for his idealised paintings of domestic and everyday-life scenes but also for his social realist works. Paintings such as Orphans (1885; Tate, London), Widowed and fatherless (1885), Homeless (1890), and The pinch of poverty (1891), depicted the harsh realities of life for the poor in Britain in a manner that played on the onlooker's emotions. It has been suggested that he may have been influenced by the Spanish painter Murillo (1618–1682), whose work also featured street children. He painted in both oils and watercolour. Kennington died in London on 10 December 1916. His son Eric Kennington (1888–1960) was also an artist, illustrator and sculptor.

It is endemic to New Zealand. It is classified as Nationally Endangered by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Edward Meyrick and named Aochleta psychra in 1884 using a male specimen collected by John Davies Enys at Porters Pass. This type specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. George Vernon Hudson repeated Meyricks description in his 1928 publication The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. In 1988 John S. Dugdale assigned Aochleta psychra to the genus Izatha. Neither the larva nor the female of this species are known or have been described.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows: It is possible to confuse this species with some of the greyish coloured species within the genus Tingena. However I. psychra can be distinguished as it lacks the antennal pecten of the Tigena species.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand, and has only been found in the southern half of the South Island. I. psychra is only known from two localities, its type locality of Porters Pass where it hasn't been seen since the 19th century, and the small Pukaki Scientific Reserve near Lake Pukaki in the Mackenzie Basin.  Ecology and habitat  In the one remain site where this species is known to exist, the habitat is shrubland. Male adults are on the wing from January to February.  Host species  The host species of this moth are unknown, however larvae are likely to feed on dead wood.  Conservation status  Despite being given a level of protection by being classified as a Scenic Reserve, the lone shrubland site inhabited by I. psychra is vulnerable to wilding pine invasion and fire. As a result this species has been classified under the New Zealand Threat Classification system as being Nationally Endangered.

It is endemic to New Zealand, where it is found on the south-eastern parts of the North Island and throughout the South Island except the West Coast. Larvae are found in dead wood and are likely to use kōwhai species as hosts. The adults are night fliers and are attracted to light. They are on the wing in January and February.  Taxonomy  This species was first described by Francis Walker in 1864 using specimens obtained from T. R. Oxley at Nelson and named Gelechia copiosella. The type specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London. Walker failed to recognise that this species fell within his newly described genus Izatha. In 1928 George Hudson misidentified and described the species now named Izatha voluptuosa as I. copiosella. Hudson did however illustrate I. copiosella as well as the species now known as I. voluptuosa in that 1928 publication. This misidentification was rectified by J. S. Dugdale in 1988 and Dugdale's conclusions were supported by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2010. In 1910 Edward Meyrick, thinking he was describing a new species, erected the genus Zirosaris to include Zirosaris amorbas. Meyrick went on to describe I. copiosella again in 1911 and named it Trachypepla amorbas. In 1915 Meyrick synonymised Zirosaris with Trachypepla. Trachypepla amorbas was in turn synonymized with I. copiosella in 2010.  Description  The egg of I. copiosella is oblong and is coloured a pink tinged white when first laid. Walker described the adults of the species as follows: The wingspan of the adult moth is 15–20 mm for males and 19–23 mm for females. I. copiosella can be distinguished from similar species in the genus by a length of yellow scales only found in the front half of the hind wing.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is restricted to the south eastern part of the North Island from Hawkes Bay and then all of the South Island to Invercargill. I. copiosella has been collected in the Hawkes Bay, Wairarapa, Wellington, Marlborough Sounds, Nelson, Buller, Kaikoura, North and Mid Canterbury, Otago Lakes, Central Otago, Dunedin, Southland and Fiordland areas.  Behaviour and life cycle  This species is night flying and appear to be attracted to light. Adults are on wing from January to February. The species is not regarded as being abundant and very few females have been collected.  Habitat and host species  Sophora chathamica Larvae have been found in dead elm wood (Ulmus species). They probably also feed on dead wood of Sophora species.

He was born and raised from a noble family, one of the few traditional tetovarian families with old roots. Since he was a young boy, he had a revolutionary spirit and directly recognized the injustices and systematic terror exerted by the Yugoslav gendarmerie in these lands. As a young man, he was noted for his ingenuity, courage, and willingness to resist the violence exercised by the monarchic powers of that time. He was therefore arrested for the first time in 1939. History =Early life= Mehmet Gega completed his education in Tetovo. Under the policies of Aleksandar Ranković, many Albanian families were sent to Turkey. In 1955, Gega was sentenced to ten years in prison for obstructing the forced deportation of Albanian families to Turkey. He made connections with teachers in Albania and took illegally books and materials to teach albanians in Macedonia the alphabet and the treasures of literature. As he wrote in his diary: \\"There were times when we could die from the cold weather, but the coldest thing was how we were persecuted and followed everywhere.. We had books in albanian language but they were banned.. I had to do this because every children who speaks albanian, must be educated. Those kids were as my own kids..\\" =1968 demonstrations in Tetovo= On the 18 October 1968, Albanian students and teachers boycotted the High Schools of Tetovo. The students and teachers were demanding the opening of Albanian classes. The opening of Albanian classes was proposed in 1967, but was rejected by Macedonian political bodies. On 20 October 1968, a parallel Albanian education structure was formed. On 28 November 1968, also the national flag day of Albania, Mehmet Gega organised another protest with the citizens of Tetovo near the clock tower. On the evening of the 19 December 1968, the beginning of Eid ul-Fitr, Mehmet Gega organised all the mosques within Tetovo and the villages of Tetovo, to raise the Albanian flag from their minarets. Eventually, on the day after, houses and shops also carried out Albanian flags. Around this time, many Albanian rights protests were organised around the Socialist Republic of Macedonia, Preševo and Kosovo in Serbia, and Montenegro. =Retaliation= On the evening of December 22, Srečko Janevski, an ethnic Macedonian, tore the Albanian flag from the front of a tailor workshop in the centre of Tetovo. Outraged by this act, Gega and hundreds of Albanians gathered at the scene. Janevski, armed with a gun, fled the scene threatening the Albanians and hid in a hotel. The angry mob marched to the hotel and nearly broke into the hotel. The Macedonian police arrived and intervened, escorting Janevski to safety. Outraged that Janevski escaped retribution, Mehmet Gega's group took position to continue the protest. The next day on December 23, the protest turned into a demonstration. Around 11 organisers:Subi Amiti, Faik Mustafa, Ramadan Sinani, Ismail Emini, Hysniqemal Merxhani etc., were gathered before the shop were the incident took place. Measure of demonstrators, moved from the center toward the municipal assembly. Hamid Salim, a student, and some friends entered the premises of the municipality and in the window of an office on the third floor, raised the Albanian flag. Once notified by the guardians of the municipal police, there is caused a clash between demonstrators and the police. Demanding the release of prisoners arrested by the police, demonstrators then march towards the city market and the road that leads to Ferizaj. During the march, Albanian workers from the Tetex factories joined the march. The demonstrators were holding banners and transparent national slogans: \\"Down with Macedonia\\" \\"We demand the opening of a university in Kosovo,\\" \\"We demand the free use of National Flag\\" While endless masses chanting: \\"Constitution, Constitution!,\\" Flag, Flag \\" \\"We teach in Albanian.\\" Etc. In late afternoon, the move from four to five thousand people (which was still growing) was gathered in the centre of the town. The Tetovo police as well as reinforcements from Skopje arrived. In this situation, enthusiasm followed by cheers and banners for national equality. before the crowd, 20-year-old Shifajet Fetahu, climbed a metal pole and put the national flag, raising the flag before the demonstrators. =Arrests= Many of the protesters were arrested after the demonstrations. Mehmet Gega was sentenced to ten years in prison. First time he was arrested in 1939. Second time: The savage communist system of that time did not allow legal activity, but acted in complete conspiracy and lawlessness, although the patriotic activity of teacher Mehmet Gega, though organized in complete conspiracy, was discovered by the infamous UDB. It was in the city of Skopje, after distributing posters around the country, that he was arrested in one of the towns of Han, and sentenced in May 1955 to 10 years in prison. Third time: Even after serving his sentence in the 1960s, the position of the Albanians had not changed at all, and Mehmet Gega, after his release from prison, became an idol of the Albanian youth - a symbol of resistance. Together with the youth and students of that time studying in Pristina, Belgrade and other centers, they propagated the idea of advancing the rights of Albanians, wherever they lived in their ethnic lands. The political climate created in Kosovo by the student movement and the intensified activity of Mehmet Gega in Tetovo, Gostivar, Skopje, Kumanovo, Bitola, Struga, Ohrid and Debar also found in these spaces unreserved support for a nationwide movement that culminated in demonstrations the glorious 1968. Lightning strikes the highest peaks, again this time Mehmet Gega was charged with organizing and received the maximum sentence as leader of the group - 10 years in prison, of which he served 7 years in the notorious Idrizovo prison. After the end of his imprisonment, he was even more baffled by national ideas and hatred of power- holders, acting fearlessly for the overthrow of Yugoslav power. Thanks to his courage and determination, he had already become an icon of the city of Tetova. Newspapers will write densely about the Tetovo Mendel. Aftermath Due to the events that occurred in Tetovo, as well as the protests in Kosovo, the new constitution, implemented by Edvard Kardelj in 1974, allowed the use of the Albanian flag within Yugoslavia, the opening of University in Kosovo, and Kosovo having the same privileges as republic states.

Gates Overview One approach to the representation theory of super Lie algebras is to restrict attention to representations in one space-time dimension and having N supersymmetry generators, i.e., to (1N) superalgebras. In that case, the defining algebraic relationship among the supersymmetry generators reduces to :{Q_I, Q_J} = 2 i delta _{I J} partial_tau . Here partial_tau denotes partial differentiation along the single space-time coordinate. One simple realization of the (11) algebra consists of a single bosonic field phi , a fermionic field psi , and a generator Q which acts as : Q phi= i psi , : Q psi= partial_tau phi. Since we have just one supersymmetry generator in this case, the superalgebra relation reduces to Q^2 = i partial _tau , which is clearly satisfied. We can represent this algebra graphically using one solid vertex, one hollow vertex, and a single colored edge connecting them.

He is most known for The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians based on his works, published posthumously in eight volumes, between 1867-1877 in London. Early life and background Elliot was the third son, one of the fifteen children, of John Elliot, of Pimlico Lodge, Westminster, who was colonel commandant of the Westminster volunteers, by a daughter of John Coakley Lettsom, M.D. Born in 1808 he was educated from the age of ten at Winchester College, and destined for New College, Oxford; but the demand of the East India Company for civilians beyond the numbers regularly trained at Haileybury tempted him to try for an appointment in their service, and he was the first of the 'competition wallahs' to pass an open examination for an immediate post in India. His oriental languages as well as his classics and mathematics proved so good that he was even placed by himself in an honorary class (1826). Career & family Elliot was assistant successively to the collector of Bareilly, the political agent at Delhi, and the collector of the southern division of Muradabad; secretary to the Sudder board of Revenue for the North-Western Provinces; and (1847) secretary to the governor-general in council for the foreign department. In this capacity he accompanied Lord Hardinge to the Panjab and drew up an admirable memoir on its resources. As foreign secretary he also visited the western frontier with Lord Dalhousie, on the occasion of the Sikh War, and negotiated the treaty with the Sikh chiefs relative to the settlement of the Panjab and Gujarat, and received the KCB for his services (1849). Throughout his official career he had devoted his leisure to study. Early on, he conducted a magazine at Mirat which contained many valuable articles on Indian subjects. With a view to assisting the projected official 'Glossary of Indian Judicial and Revenue Terms,' he published in 1845 at Agra his 'Supplement to the Glossary,' described by Professor H. H. Wilson as 'replete with curious and valuable information, especially as regards the tribes and clans of Brahmans and Rajputs.' A second edition appeared in 1860. His chief work, however, was the 'Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Mohammadan India,' in which he proposed to give an analysis of the contents and a criticism of the value of 231 Arabic and Persian historians of India, but of which he only lived to publish the first volume (Calcutta and London, 1849). Elliot was married to the daughter of William Cowell a judge at the Provincial Court of Appeal, at Bareilly, Bengal, India. Failing health compelled him to seek a change of climate, and he died on his way home at Simon's Town, Cape of Good Hope, 30 Dec 1853, aged 45.

There is a still-functioning Elliot club, now owned by the Government of Haryana at Hisar, founded by him for then East India Company officials, and O.P. Jindal Gyan Kendra knowledge currently stands on its land. Elliot left behind him manuscript collections which were placed in the hands of competent scholars for publication. His historical researches bore fruit in The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians. The Muhammadan Period, edited by John Dowson, 8 vols. 1866-77, with a 'Sequel,' edited by Sir Edward Clive Bayley, 1886. His Memoirs of the History, Folklore, and Distribution of the Races of the North- West Provinces also found an editor in John Beames, 2 vols. 1869. Works The Sudder Board of Revenue of North-Western Provinces encouraged him to publish a glossary on terms in use throughout the region. The work included terms little covered and was heavily based on Siraj-ud-Din Ali Khan Arzu's work Nawādir al-Alfāz. He completed the first volume of the work titled Supplement to the Glossary of Indian Terms, covering the alphabet from A to J. However, Elliot died before completing the second volume. A second edition was published in 1869 after being significantly enlarged and revised by John Beames. The edition was titled Memoirs on the History, Folk-lore, and Distribution of the Races of the North Western Provinces of India: Being an Amplified Edition of the Original Supplemental Glossary of Indian Terms. Elliot's life-work, the Mohammedan historians of India, came out mostly in two well-known works. The first one was titled Bibliographical Index to the Historians of Muhammedan India and its first and only volume was published at Calcutta in 1849. His manuscripts were edited posthumously by John Dowson and published in The History of India as Told by Its Own Historians. A much lesser-known work titled, Appendix to the Arabs in Sind, Vol.III, Part 1, of the Historians of India was written when he was on his deathbed and wrote it to apparently test the powers of his mind which he had doubted.

It is endemic to New Zealand, where it is known from scattered localities in the southern North Island. This species is variable in appearance and comes in two forms, a grey form and a black and white form. In the grey form it is very similar in appearance to I. notodoxa and in the black and white form to I. katadiktya. At present the larvae and biology of this species is unknown.  Taxonomy  Edward Meyrick first described this species in 1888 using specimens obtained by A. Purdie and George Hudson in Wellington. Meyrick named the species Semiocosma apodoxa. George Hudson discussed and illustrated this species under its current name of I. apodoxa in 1928. The lectotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Meyrick described the species as follows: The wingspan is 20.5–26.5 mm for males and about 21 mm for females. I. apodoxa is very variable in its forewing pattern and also comes in two forms, a grey form and a black and white form. The grey form of I. apodoxa is indistinctly marked and similar in appearance to I. notodoxa. These two species are not reliably distinguished on external characters but can be distinguished by the male genital characters as well as by their geographical location. I. apodoxa is only found in the North Island and I. notodoxa in the South Island. The black and white form of I. apodoxa is similar in appearance to I. katadiktya. The two species can be distinguished by examining the basal patch on the forewing. In well marked specimens of I. apodoxa the forewing has no pale inclusion below the fold but with I. katadiktya it almost always contains a white or pale grey patch.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. It is restricted to the North Island and can be found south from Taupo in scattered locations. Other than the type locality of Wellington it has also been found Taranaki, Hawkes Bay, Rangitikei and Wairarapa. Only the grey form of this species has been found in Wellington and very few specimens have been collected outside of this locality. Specimens obtained in Taranaki and Rangitikei have been of the black and white form but examination of the genitalia has shown they are of the same species.  Biology and behaviour  The larvae and biology of this species is currently unknown. Adults of this species have been recorded in December and January. Hudson states that the species has been seen in November and adults could be found resting on fences in Wellington city.  Habitat and host species  It is likely that the larvae of this species either consumes decomposing plant matter, dead wood or alternatively fungi or lichens.

The elders discuss a dowry (ጧሎሽ) and verify that the intended bride and groom are not relatives by checking their lineage a minimum of seven generations. After a dowry is agreed upon and it has been determined that there is no relationship between the intended bride and groom, the wedding is announced and the families begin preparations for a church/mosque ceremony and a mels/melsi ceremony. On the wedding day the groom and groomsmen (ሚዜ) get ready at the groom's house early in the morning and proceed to the bride's parents house to begin the wedding ceremonies. At the bride's parent's house, the bride gets ready and is seated awaiting the groom's arrival. As the groom and his wedding party arrive, the bride's family and friends ceremonially block the entrance to the house. The groomsmen have to either serenade or bribe their way into the house so that the groom can take the bride with him. Additionally, the best man holds perfume and sprays it everywhere inside the bride's family house. After this ceremony, the groom retrieves his bride and they along with a procession go to a church/mosque to take their wedding vows. After the religious ceremony, the wedding procession moves to a park/garden where lunch is served to guests. Afterwards, the wedding party typically takes pictures while guests make their way to the reception. At the reception, depending on the family's ethnic group there are several traditional dances performed. Ethiopian weddings typically serve Ethiopian food and live music and the party typically goes on into the early morning. To close the wedding ceremony, elders are seated at the exit of the venue and the bride and groom along with the wedding party bow and kiss the knees of the elders as they exit the venue. This is typically the conclusion the first day of a typical Ethiopian wedding. During the mels/i ceremony is dependent on the ethnic heritage of the family but it is typically smaller than the first ceremony and a time for close friends and family to spend some time with each other and continue to celebrate the newly married couple. =Kikuyu= Customarily, marriage proceedings often begin with the man proposing to the woman. Upon her acceptance the man then calls for a meeting with his clan elders who largely consist of extended elderly family members. A delegation carrying small gifts is then sent to the woman's home to meet with her clan elders. Deliberations on bride price actually begin on a later date and these are strictly conducted by the older men only. Upon completion of these negotiations, a wedding date is set, with the elders having provided an acceptable percentage of the full dowry. The rest of the dowry is expected later. No request is made for it, but the young man is expected to remember to finish his payment and failure to do so spells dishonor for that family. The wedding day begins with a convoy from the grooms family that heads to the girl's home to collect her. However, the convoy is not immediately let into the girl's homestead. Rather the bride's gate is locked and song and dance begins as a cover for negotiations. Various goods may be asked of the groom and he willingly obliges to the demands after which he is let into the compound. =Nigeria= Generally, there are three types of weddings in Nigeria: traditional weddings, church weddings and court weddings. The civil marriage takes place at a registry, and then traditional wedding ceremony follows. Finally, it's the church wedding ceremony. Many couples choose to do all three, depending on their financial situation. Nigerian weddings are normally characterised by an abundance of colours. In traditional weddings, customs vary slightly from one part of Nigeria to the other. In Southern, Western and Eastern parts of Nigeria, it is called the traditional wedding ceremony. Officials and elders sip wine while they invite the couple in for introductions and negotiations, and presentation of the bride price which consists mainly of gifts of shoes, textiles, jewelry and bags. In the other parts of the country it is very much the same. Elders from both families retreat into an inner room to negotiate on the bride price. When concluded, the gifts are then presented to the bride's family. After this, the bride, along with her entourage of girls is presented to the husband, family and guests in the most colourful way. =Pygmy wedding traditions= Pygmy engagements were not long and usually formalized by an exchange of visits between the families concerned. The groom to be would bring a gift of game or maybe a few arrows to his new in-laws, take his bride home to live in his band and with his new parents. His only obligation is to find among his relatives a girl willing to marry a brother or male cousin of his wife. If he feels he can feed more than one wife, he may have additional wives. =Somali wedding traditions= Middle Eastern customs =Arabic customs= Although Christian weddings in the Arab World bear similarities to Western weddings, Muslim weddings in the Arab countries are influenced by Muslim traditions. Muslim weddings start with a Sheikh and Katb Al-kitaab (book) for the bride and groom. A wedding is not Islamically valid unless both bride and groom are willing, and the groom is often encouraged to visit her before the wedding (as advised in many aḥadīth of the Islamic prophet Muhammad). However, these visits must be chaperoned to ensure purity of action between the two. It's the custom that the groom and his family pay for all the wedding expenses. The Bride's family gather together before the wedding in the Bride's parents house. The Groom's family come and take the Bride from the house in a decorated car along with the one bride's mate which usually is the bride's sister, cousin, or best friend. The rest of the family and close friends follow in their cars, honking the car's horns. The reception is usually for all the family and friends usually with a meal and cake. Candy covered almonds is a traditional giveaway from the couple. There is a lot of dancing and (zaghareet)Ululation. The Muslims tradition is to have Men in one side and women in another so the ladies can take their head cover off. But in non- Muslim traditions the whole wedding is for both sexes. =Iranian customs= Persian wedding tradition, despite its local and regional variations, like many other rituals in Persia goes back to the ancient Zoroastrian tradition. Though the concepts and theory of the marriage have changed drastically by Islamic traditions, the actual ceremonies have remained more or less the same as they were originally in the ancient Zoroastrian culture. =Israeli customs= European customs =English customs= A wedding carriage in Bristol, England The Western custom of a bride wearing a white wedding dress came to symbolize purity, not virginity, in the Victorian era. Within the \\"white wedding\\" tradition, a white dress and veil is not considered appropriate in the second or subsequent wedding of a widow or divorcee. The specific conventions of Western weddings, largely from a Protestant and Catholic viewpoint, are discussed at \\"white wedding\\". A wedding is often followed or accompanied by a wedding reception, which in some areas may be known as the 'Wedding Breakfast', at which an elaborate wedding cake is served. Western traditions include toasting the couple, the newlyweds having the first dance, and cutting the cake. A bride may throw her bouquet to the assembled group of all unmarried women in attendance, with folklore suggesting the person who catches it will be the next to wed. A fairly recent equivalent has the groom throwing the bride's garter to the assembled unmarried men; the man who catches it is supposedly the next to wed. The Wedding Breakfast is one occasion where every member of the family who has had at least some role in the wedding is present. It is also important as the first time the newly married bride and groom share their first meal together as a lawfully wedded couple. The modern Wedding Breakfast includes the service of food to guests that can range from traditional roasts, buffets, or regional treats such as in the case of a London WeddingLondon Wedding in the 'East End'. Another Victorian tradition is for brides to wear or carry \\"something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\\" during the service. It is considered good luck to do so. Often the bride attempts to have one item that meets all of these qualifications, such as a borrowed blue handkerchief which is \\"new to her\\" but loaned by her grandmother (thus making it old). Another addition to this custom is to wear a coin in one's shoe to bring prosperity. The full text of the verse is: :Something old, something new, :Something borrowed, something blue, :And silver sixpence in your shoe.Olmert, Michael (1996). Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History, p.155. Simon & Schuster, New York. . =Scottish customs= A traditional Scottish Wedding Scotland is a popular place for young English couples to get married since, in Scotland, parents' permission is not required if both the bride and groom are old enough to legally be married (16). In England it was the case that if either was 16 or 17 then the permission of parents had to be sought. Thus Scotland, and especially the blacksmith's at Gretna Green, became a very popular place for couples to elope to, especially those under 18 and usually living in England. Gretna Green now hosts hundreds of weddings a year and is Scotland's third most popular tourist attraction. *The bride's family sends invitations on behalf of the couple to the wedding guests, addressed by hand. The couple may send the invitations themselves, especially if they are more middle-aged. The invitations are usually sent no later than 6 weeks before the wedding and will specify if the invitation is for ceremony and/or reception and/or evening following the meal at the reception. It has become more common in recent times for Save The Date Cards to be used to notify invitees further in advance to allow sufficient notice for arrangements to be made to ensure attendance. These can be sent up to 6 months before the wedding day. *Guests send or deliver wedding gifts to the bride's family home before the wedding day. Alternatively, the couple may register at a department store and have a list of gifts there. The shop then organizes delivery, usually to the bride's parents' house or to the reception venue. *A wedding ceremony takes place at a church, register office or possibly another favorite location, such as a hilltop. In this regard Scotland differs significantly from England where only pre-approved public locations may be used for the wedding ceremony. Most ceremonies take place mid afternoon and last about half an hour during which the marriage schedule is signed by the couple and two witnesses, usually the best man and chief bridesmaid. *The newly wed couple often leave the ceremony to the sound of bagpipes. *There is a wedding reception following the ceremony, usually at a different venue. *The bridal party, or members of it, always including the bride and groom, lines up in a receiving line and the wedding guests file past, introducing themselves. *Usually a beverage is served while the guests and bridal party mingle. In some cases the drink may be whisky or wine with a non alcoholic alternative. *The best man and bride's father toast the bride and groom with personal thoughts, stories, and well- wishes, usually humorous. The groom then follows with a response on behalf of his bride. Champagne is usually provided for the toast. *There is nearly always dancing following the meal, with the style of music being selected by the couple to suit their preference. Often in Scotland this takes the form of a céilidh, a night of Scottish country dancing in couples and groups (sets) to live traditional music. This may be performed by a specialist céilidh band, though many non-specialist bands will also incorporate some traditional céilidh dances in their repertoire along with a range of music of all styles to suit tastes. *The first dance is led by the bride and groom, followed by the rest of the bridal party and finally the guests. *The cake-cutting ceremony takes place; the bride and groom jointly hold a cake cutter and cut the first pieces of the wedding cake. *Gifts are not opened at the reception; they are either opened ahead of time and sometimes displayed at the reception, or if guests could not deliver gifts ahead of time, they are placed on a table at the reception for the bride and groom to take home with them and open later. *A sprig of white heather is usually worn as a buttonhole for good luck. *It is the norm for the groom and much of the male bridal party and guests to wear kilts, although suits are also worn. Kilts and Highland dress are often rented for this purpose. =Celtic Handfasting= Handfasting is a wedding ritual in which the bride's and groom's hands are tied together. It is said to be based on an ancient Celtic tradition and to have inspired the phrase \\"tying the knot\\". \\"Handfasting\\" is favoured by practitioners of Celtic- based religions and spiritual traditions, such as Wicca and Druidism. =Finnish customs= Bridal Sauna by Robert Wilhelm Ekman A relatively unique Finnish wedding tradition was the bridal sauna, where the bridesmaids took the bride to a luxuriously decorated, cleansing sauna on the night before the wedding. Instead of the flower bouquet the bath broom was thrown instead. The wedding dress was traditionally black, passed on as heritage by the bride's mother. It was decorated and the bride was also given a wedding crown made from shiny bits and pieces. Although nobles might have followed differing international conventions, black as the color of choice remained popular amongst the general population even until the 20th century. When Princess Diana wed Prince Charles in 1981 in an all-white gown, it instantly became the standard gown from there on. The earliest Finnish weddings were held at both the bride's and groom's families' houses, a tradition that survived in Eastern Finland until the late 20th century. In Western Finland there were grand processions to the church, back from the church and from one of the houses to the another. The celebrations at each house lasted a day and then the next day the party moved to the other house. Weddings of wealthy families lasted even longer, from 3 to 4 days. 19th century also saw the rise of gatecrashers called puukkojunkkari at these long weddings. =French customs= Landes: Three people bring la roste (roasted bread soaked in sweet wine) to a couple of newlyweds in bed. Map postally used on July 16, 1914. In France many couples choose to have two weddings, only civil weddings are legally recognized (due to the concept of laïcité), they are performed in the town hall by the mayor (or a deputy mayor or another councillor acting on his/her behalf). At least one of the spouses must reside in the town where the ceremony takes place. For people choosing to also have a religious wedding, the religious ceremony can only take place after the civil one, often in the same day. Town halls often offer a more elaborate ceremony for couples who do not wish to marry religiously. If the two ceremonies take place separately, the civil one will usually include close family and witnesses. Once the civil ceremony is complete, the couple will receive a livret de famille, a booklet where a copy of the marriage certificate is recorded. This is an official document and, should the couple have children, each child's birth certificate will be recorded in the livret de famille too. The civil ceremony in France is free of charge. Traditionally, the wedding guests gathered at the fiancée home and went on procession to the church. The procession were led by the bridegroom and his mother, followed by the bride mother and bridegroom father, the witnesses, grandparents, brothers and sisters with their spouse. At last came the bride and her father followed by the bridesmaids (usually family children). Nowadays, the guests usually gathered at the town hall or church and the bride and bridegroom enter together, followed by the family and guests. In some regions, the groom may meet his fiancée at her home on the day of the wedding and escort her to the chapel where the ceremony is being held. As the couple proceeds to the chapel, children will stretch long white ribbons across the road which the bride will cut as she passes. At the chapel, the bride and groom are seated on two red velvet chairs underneath a silk canopy called a carre. Laurel leaves may be scattered across their paths when they exit the chapel. Sometimes small coins are also tossed for the children to gather. French wedding celebration at Château de Hattonchâtel At the reception, the couple customarily uses a toasting cup called a Coupe de Mariage. The origin of giving this toast began in France, when a small piece of toast was literally dropped into the couple's wine to ensure a healthy life. The couple would lift their glass to \\"a toast\\", as is common in Western culture today. In south west France it is customary to serve spit roast wild boar (or sanglier in French) as the wedding breakfast, a local delicacy. Some couples choose to serve a croquembouche instead of a wedding cake. This dessert is a pyramid of crème-filled pastry puffs, drizzled with a caramel glaze. At more boisterous weddings, tradition involves continuing the celebration until very late at night. In many regions of France, wedding rituals continue late into the night after the official ceremonies and party. In some regions after the reception, those invited to the wedding will gather outside the newlyweds' window and bang pots and pans; this is called a 'charivari'. They are then invited into the house for some more drinks in the couple's honor, after which the couple is finally allowed to be alone for their first night together as husband and wife. In the rural Auvergne-Rhône- Alpes region, a post-wedding ritual called la rôtie involves a gang of unmarried men and women finding the bride and groom who have escaped from the reception, tipping them out of their bed, and serving them a concoction of champagne and chocolate served in a chamber pot, which will be passed around and drank by everyone. Afterwards, the whole group will enjoy an onion soup. The heavily scatological and sexual implications and off-putting appearance of this ritual is supposed to symbolize the day-to-day intimacy of married life, deeply connected to the rural nature of the area. La rôtie is an alternative ceremony outside the official ceremonies that the youth can be involved in, and create humor by making something that \\"tastes good but is in bad taste\\". The commensal quality of the ritual is a symbol for the bridge between youth and adulthood that the couple becomes in marriage, as well as the community's involvement in the new couple's married life.Reed-Danahay, Deborah. “Champagne and Chocolate: ‘Taste’ and Inversion in a French Wedding Ritual.” American Anthropologist, vol. 98, no. 4, 1996, pp. 750–761. New Series, www.jstor.org/stable/681883. Similar rituals are widespread across rural France, though perhaps with different foods and containers. =German customs= Cutting a log represents the first obstacle that the couple must overcome in their marriage Friends of the bride \\"kidnap\\" her and take her from bar to bar. The best man of the bride, her father, or the groom pays the bill each time. The kidnappers then go to a certain place, such as a public building, and leave a few pointers to help for searching. The exemption may be associated with a task for the groom, for example an artistic performance or wash the dishes for the next few weeks. In Austria and Bavaria (usually at country weddings), it is now customary to sing a derisive song before the freeing of the bride. In Lower Austria it is customary for a masked men and the bride to go to the nearest coffee bar or tavern to drink, sing and to wait for the groom to come. In most areas of Austria it is the best man, sometimes the groom or the bride's father (rarely the best man) that pays the price of the kidnappers. This custom is due to the supposed 'right of the first night' (German 'Recht der ersten Nacht', French 'droit de cuissage') in the Middle Ages. According to myth the clergy and nobility in the Middle Ages had the right to have sex with their female subordinates in their wedding night. The bride was retrieved (kidnapped) from the vassals of the government from their Weddings. The historiography sees this rite as a literary fiction. In Bavaria and Western Austria another tradition is to wake up the bride early in the morning with a gun shoot or firecrackers on wedding day. Friends and neighbours meet at dawn at the brides house to \\"greet\\" her on her special day. The tradition of cutting a log represents the first obstacle that the couple must overcome in their marriage. They must work together to overcome the obstacle by sawing through the log. Using a large, long saw with two handles, the couple demonstrates their teamwork to friends and family. =Greek customs= Example of the traditional Greek-Cypriot 'Money Dance' at a Cypriot wedding. Two or three days before the wedding, the couple organizes a celebration called Krevati (Greek for bed) in their new home. In Krevati, friends and relatives of the couple put money and young children on the couple's new bed for prosperity and fertility in their life. After the custom, they usually have a party with food and music. On the day of the wedding, usually Saturday, but also Friday or Sunday, the groom cannot see the bride until the wedding ceremony. The groom usually arrives first in church and waits for the bride, who usually arrives late. After they exchange flower bouquets, they have the wedding ceremony, where the best man puts the wedding rings and crowns on the couple. The couple drink red wine from the same glass (between one and three sips, depending on the tradition). This is not \\"communion\\" in the formal religious sense, but about sharing the cup of life. At the end of the wedding ceremony, as the newly wedded pair leave the church, the guests throw rice and flowers for fertility and felicity. Special guests, such as close friends and family receive sugar-coated almonds (traditionally an odd number, usually seven but sometimes five) as a gift from the couple. Most Greek ceremonies are Orthodox. After the ceremony, usually the couple hold a great wedding party in some place with plenty of food, drinks, music and dance, usually until next morning. The wedding party starts with the invited people waiting for the couple, who usually come after some time. They start the dancing and eventually eat a piece of their wedding cake. At some point during the party, they also dance the traditional zeibekiko (groom) and çiftetelli (bride). In many places of Greece, where they hold a more traditional wedding, they usually play only traditional music and eat local food. For example, in the region of Cyclades, they eat the traditional pasteli (solid honey with sesame) and in the region of Crete they cook rice with goat. In most traditional weddings, they bake whole animals like pigs, goats or sheep just like the Easter celebration. Before the church ceremony, especially in smaller areas, usually friends and relatives of the bride and the groom, accompanies them separately to the church playing traditional instruments, according to the region. A typical Greek wedding will usually have more than 100 invited people (but usually 250-500) who are friends, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, first or second cousins, neighbors and colleagues. It is common to have guests whom the couple has never met before. This is because the people who will be invited are usually determined by the parents of the couple and not by the couple themselves. Traditionally, the whole village would have attended the wedding, so very often the parents invite friends of theirs and their children, to the weddings of their own children. There are many other traditions which are local to their regional areas. One famous tradition is the pinning of money on the bride's dress. This custom originated in one part of Greece, where it is a substitute for wedding presents, however it has become more widespread recently. =Italian customs= In some parts of Italy, a party, known as a Serenade, is thrown outside of the bride's home by the groom. His family and friends come and wait for the bride, entertaining themselves until she appears. The groom then sings to his bride to further seduce her. Once his song is sung, the party ends. Before the wedding, the eldest of the bride’s family gifts a silver dollar to the bride. If the bride keeps this silver dollar through the life of their marriage, the couple is said to never need to be concerned for their financial prosperity. If this silver dollar is ever spent, superstition states the couple will immediately encounter financial hardship and can suffer great monitory loss through the length of their marriage. The day of the wedding, the groomsmen try their hardest to make the groom as uncomfortable as possible by saying things like \\"Maybe she forgot where the church is\\". It is also traditional for the grooms family to give a dowry to the bride and to provide the engagement ring. The bride's family is then responsible for receiving the guests of the wedding in their home for a reception afterward. The color green is very important in the Italian wedding. In Italy, the tradition of something blue is replaced with something green. This color brings good luck to the married couple. The veil and bridesmaids also were important in an Italian wedding. The tradition began in Ancient Rome when the veil was used to hide the bride from any spirits that would corrupt her and the bridesmaids were to wear similar outfits so that the evil spirits were further confused. An old Roman custom was that brides threw nuts at rejected suitors as they left the ceremony.Olmert, Michael (1996). Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser & Curiouser Adventures in History, p.152. Simon & Schuster, New York. . After dessert, more dancing commences, gifts are given, and the guests eventually begin to leave. In Southern Italy, as the guests leave, they hand envelopes of money to the bride and groom, who return the gift with a wedding favor or bomboniere, a small token of appreciation. =Polish customs= In Polish weddings, the celebrations may continue for two or three days. In the past, the engagement ceremony was organized by the future groom as a formal family gathering, during which he asked his chosen lady to marry him. In recent years, this custom has changed, and today an engagement is much more personal and intimate. An elegant dinner party afterward is still a nice way to inform the closest family members about the couple's decision to get married. In some regions of Poland, the tradition to invite wedding guests in person is still upheld. Many young couples, accompanied by their parents, visit their family and friends to hand them the wedding invitations personally. According to old tradition, a groom arrives with his parents at the house of his bride just before the wedding ceremony. At that time, both parents and parents-in-law give the young couple their blessing. The couple enters the church together and walks up to the altar followed by their parents and two witnesses. In Poland, it is quite unusual for the bride to be walked down the aisle or to have bridesmaids and groomsmen in a wedding. The couple is assisted by two witnesses, a man (usually from the groom's side) and a woman (usually from the bride's side) who are either family members or close friends. The Polish bride traditionally wears a white dress and a veil; the groom usually wears a fitted suit with a bow tie and a boutonnière that matches the bride's bouquet. During the ceremony, wedding rings are exchanged and both husband and wife wear them on their right hands. Right after the ceremony, the closest family and all the guests form a line in the front of the church to congratulate the newlyweds and wish them love and happiness. As soon as the married couple leaves the church they get showered with rice for luck or guests drop coins at their feet for them to pick up. This is done to ensure a good and prosperous future for the newlyweds. Once all guests have showered the couple with kisses, hugs and flowers, everyone heads to the reception. It is a custom in Poland to prepare 'passing gates' on the way to the reception for the newlyweds who, in order to pass, have to give the 'gatekeepers' some vodka. This is a misinterpretation of an earlier tradition, where the 'passing gates' were built if the bride was an orphan and money collected by 'gatekeepers' from the guests was handed over to the bride as her dowry (being an orphan usually implied poverty). The married couple is welcomed at the reception place by the parents with bread and salt; the bread symbolizes prosperity and the salt stands for the hardship of life. This way, the parents wish that the young couple never goes hungry and learns how to deal with everyday hardships together. During the reception, the newlyweds also break two drinking glasses by either stepping on them or throwing them over the shoulder for good fortune.https://krosno.com.pl/blog/Przesady-i-zwyczaje-slubne-w-Polsce.html The wedding party lasts (and the bride and groom remain) until the last guest leaves, usually until morning. In Poland, movements like Human Liberties Crusade or Wedding of the Weddings promote non-alcoholic wedding celebrations. =Romanian customs= In Romanian tradition, the wedding is composed of three steps: The formal/legal wedding, the Church wedding and the banquet. Lăutari are Romanian musicians performing traditional songs. The music of the lăutari establishes the structure of the elaborate Romanian weddings. The lăutari also function as guides through the wedding rituals and moderate any conflicts that may arise during what can be a long, alcohol-fueled party. Over a period of nearly 48 hours, this can be very physically strenuous. Following custom almost certainly dating back at least to the Middle Ages, most lăutari spend the fees from these wedding ceremonies on extended banquets for their friends and families over the days immediately following the wedding. The wedding begins at the Town hall where the couple literally gets married in the presence of their closest friends and relatives. After that, they go to the bride's house where the Lăutari come and sing themed songs like \\"Ia-ți mireasă ziua bună\\" (Bride's farewell) while the bride, the groom and the couple's parents take part in a symbolic preparation for the wedding (the best man and the best maid put a flower on their chests, arrange the groom's tie and shaves him and put the bride's veil, all in front of a big mirror decorated with pieces of veil and white flowers, mirror that separates the bride from the groom). They then go to the church where the religious ceremony is performed. Afterwards they go to a restaurant where the banquet begins. The newlyweds meet the guests at the entrance and they serve a glass of champagne while the Lautari sing a song. After all the guests have arrived, the couple breaks the ice and starts dancing a waltz followed by a Hora dance. Later on, the chefs do \\"Dansul găinii\\" (the chicken dance: they dress up a roasted chicken and decorate it and they dance with it while the best man negotiate the chicken's price with them). Another tradition is bride kidnapping. A few friends of the newlywed stake the bride while the groom is not paying attention and take her somewhere else, usually to a club. The groom is then forced to negotiate the bride's price and to redeem it, but not until the \\"criminals\\" show evidence of having the bride (a shoe, her necklace, etc.). Usually, the \\"thieves\\" ask for beverage. They then take the bride back to the wedding and as a punishment they are forced to dance a waltz with the bride lifted up. It is normal to wish the bride and groom \\"Casa de Piatra\\" (Rock-solid home) and throw rice on them, which symbolises a solid marriage and abundance. =Russian customs= A traditional Russian wedding lasts for at least two days and some weddings last as long as a week. Throughout the celebration there is dancing, singing, long toasts, and food and drinks. The best man and maid of honor are called witnesses, \\"svideteli\\" in Russian. The ceremony and the ring exchange takes place on the first day of the wedding. Throughout the years, Russian weddings have adopted many western customs, including bridesmaids and flower girls. During the wedding feast any of the guests can start chanting \\"Gor'ko\\" (\\"bitter\\") which usually is immediately supported by the rest of the guests. In this case bride and groom should kiss each other and the kiss should last for as long as the chanting continues. It's customary for the bride to eat a spoonful of sour cream on your wedding day. =Swedish customs= In a Swedish church wedding, the priest generally doesn't say when the couple may kiss each other, in contrast to Anglo-Saxon traditions. It is probably because the kiss doesn't traditionally belong to Swedish wedding customs, but has relatively recently been associated with marriage.brollopstorget.se > vigselakten (the wedding ceremony) Cite: I Sverige säger vanligvis inte prästen till när paret får kyssa varandra vilket de gör i de anglosaxiska länderna. Antagligen är det för att kyssen egentligen inte är tillhör svensk vigseltradition, men numera är det så starkt förknippat med vigseln att den svenska traditionen får stå åt sidan. Retrieved on March 22, 2010 In Swedish weddings, the bride and groom usually go down the aisle together, rather than the bride being escorted by her father.brollopstorget.se > vigselakten (the wedding ceremony) Cite: Det vanligaste nuförtiden i Sverige är att brud och brudgum går in i kyrkan tillsammans. Retrieved on Mars 22, 2010] The symbolism is that of a free man and a free woman voluntarily uniting in marriage. It is custom in Sweden that instead of guests bringing gifts for the bride and groom, they will pay for the dinner and drinks in order to help pay for the cost of the wedding. An older tradition is that the bride's parents will give her one gold and one silver coin, which she puts in her shoe. Unlike the United States, it is also customary have a simple wedding party, consisting of one or two bride's maid and one groom's man. Lastly, at the wedding party the couple is placed at the head of a U shaped table instead of a separate head table for the bridal party. =Albanian customs= A couple posing in ancient site of Apollonia, Albania In Albanian traditional weddings, the dress of the bride is characterized by its elegance and transparency, in that of the Catholic one can see full colors. The Catholic bride's dress is characterized by its picturesque effects and harmony. There are two types of wedding dresses. One is worked on a \\"shajak\\" (large piece of wool) and with floral motives worked with \\"gajtan\\" (kind of rope) black cotton, sometimes mixed with green. The other one is worked in the same material but with red color. Different from the first here the motifs are enriched with full colors. These dresses have a belt worked with gold and grain necklaces in red, rose, orange creating all together a warm surface. Here the motifs are very small. This gallery of costumes, richness of colors, and sentiments is a major, long-running experience for Albanians, not only for the ability to preserve tradition, but also for conserving the high technique of elaboration or the high artistic level. The dress of a Catholic bride from Shkodër is tripped from the transparent white, shiny, soft, which spreads all over the body, and is intended to suggest tranquility and a warm purity. This concept of tradition is achieved through the white of the base material and the gold thread over. This dress is composed by the \\"barnaveke\\": some kind of very long pants which seem a skirt. In the upper part is worn a shirt and over it a \\"jelek\\" (waistcoat). Wedding in Kosovo Ritual songs name various elements which contain \\"paja\\" (pronounced paya) of the girl, which are the goods parents give to the daughter to wear, to furnish the house, gifts for her husband and the intimate cousins. Elements are typically made by weaving clothes using looms. The preparation of the \\"paja\\" for the parents of the bride is a pleasure which means also accomplishing the obligations toward the daughter. This is also an expression of the love of parents, but is connected with the economical conditions of the family. \\"Dhunti\\" in Shkodra means the gifts that the groom prepares for the bride during the engagement, mainly clothes, jewelry, gold ornaments and tricks, which are sent to her a few days before the wedding. In addition to those received by the family of his father, the bride takes many gifts from the groom and his family. \\"Dhuntia\\", which had a considerable monetary value, was prepared with great care by the family of the boy, because in some way embodied respect and love for his young bride, to whom these gifts were made, love for their son that he married at the same time was also a representation of the family in its economic and aesthetic. In \\"dhunti\\" there were enough clothes and items for use at all times, in joy and in sorrow, which expressed particular attention to the role of women. South Asian customs =Bangladeshi wedding customs= See: Bengali Hindu wedding and Bengali Muslim wedding Bangladeshi wedding refers to the weddings in Bangladesh. Although Muslim and Hindu marriages have their distinctive religious rituals, there are many common cultural rituals in marriages across religion among Bengali people. The indigenous groups of Bangladesh also have their own unique wedding traditions and rituals which are distinct from those of the Bengalis. =Indian wedding customs= The wedding feast is served at a Hindu Rajput wedding Holy Matrimony in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church which is an Eastern Catholic Church and a part of the Saint Thomas Christian community in Kerala. Indian weddings take anywhere from five minutes to several weeks, depending on region, religion, and a variety of other factors. Due to the diversity of Indian culture, the wedding style, ceremony and rituals may vary greatly amongst various states, regions, religions and castes. In certain regions, it is quite common that during the traditional wedding days, there would be a tilak ceremony (where the groom is anointed on his forehead), a ceremony for adorning the bride's hand and feet with henna (called mehendi) accompanied by Ladies' Sangeet (music and dance), and many other pre-wedding ceremonies. Another important ceremony followed in certain areas is the \\"Haldi\\" program where the bride and the groom are anointed with turmeric paste. All of the close relatives make sure that they have anointed the couple with turmeric. In certain regions, on the day of the wedding proper, the Bridegroom, his friends and relatives come singing and dancing to the wedding site in a procession called baraat, and then the religious rituals take place to solemnize the wedding, according to the religion of the couple. While the groom may wear traditional Sherwani or dhoti or Western suit, or some other local costume, his face, in certain regions, is usually veiled with a mini-curtain of flowers called sehra. In certain regions, the bride (Hindu or Muslim) always wears red clothes, never white because white symbolizes widowhood in Indian culture. In Southern and Eastern states the bride usually wears a Sari, but in northern and central states the preferred garment is a decorated Red skirt-blouse and veil called lehenga. After the solemnization of marriage, the bride departs with her husband. This is a very sad event for the bride's relatives because traditionally she is supposed to permanently \\"break- off\\" her relations with her blood relatives to join her husband's family. Among Christians in the state of Kerala, the bridegroom departs with the bride's family. The wedding may be followed by a \\"reception\\" by the groom's parents at the groom's place. While gifts and money to the couple are commonly given, the traditional dowry from the bride's parents to the couple is officially forbidden by law. =Pakistani wedding customs= A Pakistani wedding typically consist of four ceremonies on four separate days. It may consist of three days if the first function called \\"Mehndi\\" is done in a combined manner by both the bride and groom's family. The first function is Mehndi in which the families get together and celebrate the upcoming wedding function. On this day, it is customary to wear either green, yellow, orange, or other vibrant colors. The bride-to-be gets her hands painted with henna, and songs and dances go on throughout the night. The next day is \\"baraat\\" which is hosted by the bride's family. This event is usually held in a reception hall, and the groom comes over with his family and friends; a large feast is given. The bride's friends and relatives are also present, and the Baraat event can be considered the 'main' wedding event as it is the largest one out of all the events. Then there is the holy ceremony of \\"Nikah\\" which is performed by a religious Pastor or imam, after which bride and groom are declared as husband and wife.The Next day there is a function of \\"Walima\\" in which the groom's family is the host and the bride's family come over for a big feast. On her wedding day, the bride-to-be can wear any color she wants, but vibrant colors and much traditional gold jewelry are typically worn. It is customary for the bride to wear traditional clothes such as a lahnga, shalwar kameez, or sari. These weddings are also typical of the Muslim community in India. =Sri Lankan wedding customs= Sri Lankan weddings are typically celebrated as two functions in two days. In the first day, bride's family hosts the event and the poruwa ceremony takes place. The both bride and groom wears the traditional Kandyan dress and most traditional customs happen in the first day. The traditional honeymoon and the second day hosts by the groom's family and treat bride and her family with foods and entertainment. Minor communities in Sri Lanka are also celebrates the wedding ceremony in a similar way with slightly different functions and different traditional dresses. Tamil people wears traditional Tamil wedding dresses and they replace poruwa ceremony with traditional Hindu wedding ceremony. Burgher people wears western traditional dresses and they marry in church as in popular western culture. Sri Lankan Moors celebrates the wedding with added Islam customs. East Asian customs =Chinese wedding customs= Chinese wedding banquet Traditional Chinese marriage is a ceremonial ritual within Chinese societies that involve a marriage established by pre-arrangement between families. Within the traditional Chinese culture, romantic love was allowed, and monogamy was the norm for most ordinary citizens. A band of musicians with gongs and double- reed instruments accompanies the bridal parade to the groom's home. Similar music is also played at the wedding banquet. Depending on the region from which the bride hails, Chinese weddings will have different traditions such as the Tea Ceremony or the use of a wedding emcee. Also, in modern times, Chinese couples will often go to photo studios to take \\"glamour shots,\\" posing in multiple gowns and various backgrounds. Most regional Chinese wedding rituals follow the main Chinese wedding traditions, although some rituals are particular to the peoples of the southern China region. In most southern Chinese weddings, the bride price is based on the groom's economic status. The idea of \\"selling the daughter\\" or bride is not a phrase that is used often. Therefore, the price of the bride does not tend to be too demanding. Most of the time, the bride price is in the form of gold jewelry, fine fabric, money, or even a roast pig, which symbolizes that the bride is a virgin. Wedding presents are given by elderly couples or couples that are older than the newlyweds, while tea is served by the younger family members. =Japanese wedding customs= Japanese customs fall into two categories: traditional Shinto ceremonies, and modern Western-style ceremonies. In either case, the couple must first be legally married by filing for marriage at their local government office, and the official documentation must be produced in order for the ceremony to be held. Traditional customs Before ever getting married there are two types of mate selection that may occur with the couple: (1) miai, or an arranged marriage and (2) ren ai, or a love match.Kinko, Ito (March 9, 2000) Modern japan through its weddings: gender, person, and society in ritual portrayal. Blackwell Publishing, 29, Retrieved January 11, 2009, from EBSCOhost The Japanese bride-to-be may be painted pure white from head to toe, visibly declaring her maiden status to the gods. Two choices of headgear exist. One, the watabōshi, is a white hood; the other, called the tsunokakushi, serves to hide the bride's 'horns of jealousy.' It also symbolizes the bride's intention to become a gentle and obedient wife. A traditional Japanese wedding ceremony Traditional Japanese wedding customs (shinzen shiki) involve an elaborate ceremony held at a Shinto shrine. Japanese weddings are being increasingly extravagant with all the elaborate details placed into thought. However, in some cases, younger generations choose to abandon the formal ways by having a \\"no host party\\" for a wedding.Lebra, T, Sugiyama (1984). Japanese women: constraint and fulfillment. Honolulu University of Hawaii Press, Retrieved January 10, 2009, from NetLibrary In this situation, the guests include mainly of the couple's friends who pay an attendance fee. Western-style customs In recent years, the \\"Western Style Wedding\\" (influenced by Christian weddings) has become the choice of most couples in Japan. An industry has sprung up, dedicated to providing couples with a ceremony modeled after church rituals. Japanese western style weddings are generally held in a chapel, either in a simple or elaborate ceremony, often at a dedicated wedding chapel within a hotel. Before the ceremony, there is a rehearsal. Often during this rehearsal, the bride's mother lowers the veil for her daughter, signifying the last act that a mother can do for her daughter, before \\"giving her away\\". The father of the bride, much like in Western ceremonies, walks the bride down the aisle to her awaiting groom. After the rehearsal comes the procession. The wedding celebrant will often wear a wedding cross, or cana, a cross with two interlocking wedding rings attached, which symbolize a couple's commitment to sharing a life together in the bonds of holy matrimony. The wedding celebrant gives a brief welcome and an introductory speech before announcing the bride's entrance. The procession ends with the groom bowing to the bride's father. The father bows in return. The service then starts. The service is given either in Japanese, English or quite often, a mix of both. It follows Protestant ceremony, relaxed and not overtly religious. Typically part of 1 Corinthians 13 is read from the Bible. After the reading, there is a prayer and a short message, explaining the sanctity of the wedding vows (seiyaku). The bride and groom share their vows and exchange rings. The chapel register is signed and the new couple is announced. This is often followed by the traditional wedding kiss. The service can conclude with another hymn and a benediction. With the two types of ceremonies, Shinto and Western, available it was bound for the two to be combined into what is called a contemporary Japanese wedding. Contemporary Japanese weddings are celebrated in many ways. On the beginning of the wedding day, the participants are to get ready at the parlor's beauty shop. The responsibility of the beauty shop is to dress the bride, the groom, and the other participants in the formal Japanese attire. Dressing the bride is an important task because the bride is to change into several outfits throughout her wedding day. Due to the complexity of the design, dressing a bride can be difficult and time consuming and for this reason the bride must be the first person to arrive two hours prior to the wedding ceremony. The bride's attire consists of an extravagant kimono, heavy make-up, a wig, and a head covering. An hour prior to the wedding ceremony, the guests and the groom should start to arrive.Goldstein-Gidoni, O (2000, March). The production of tradition and culture in the japanese wedding enterprise. Taylor & Francis, 65, Retrieved January 10, 2009, from EBSCOhost When everyone is dressed in their formal attire, the bride and the groom are to separate from each other and meet their close relatives in a waiting room. The relatives present will appear in the family photo and will also attend the religious ceremony. During this gathering, the kaizoe (assistant) will inform the participants of what will take place and what they should do during the day since they are not familiar with the ceremony. When all is understood, the relatives and participants are brought to the photo studio where the professional photographs are to be taken. Taking the photographs of the bride, the groom, and their relatives is considered to be the central part of the wedding day. The photographs of the couple and their family are designed to represent the couple's prospective future together. After the lengthy photo session, the bride, the groom, and others are brought to the Shinto shrine. Nowadays, the Shinto shrine may be conveniently located inside a hotel where all the activities will take place. A Shinto priest conducts the ceremony. In the ceremony, the bride and the groom are purified. However, the ceremony's important event occurs when the bride and the groom exchange nuptial cups of sake also known as san-san-ku-do. With the addition of Western tradition, the exchange of rings and weddings vows also take place. Those guests who did not attend the religious ceremony are able to view the ceremony on video screens located in the lobby. Like Western-style traditions, a reception takes place right after the wedding ceremony. The guests of the reception include family members, friends, and colleagues. Due to the wedding industry's attempt to maximize time and space, the reception will last exactly two hours. The reception does not include any random activities, but follows a strict order of events. The reception includes dramatic entrances by the bride and the groom with special effects, speeches, and other performances. Throughout the reception, the bride shall receive the guests' utmost attention because she changes two to three times for the dramatic entrances. With all the dramatic entrances, the groom will join the bride. For example, the first entrance includes the bride, the groom, and the nakodo couple. Nakodo means a \\"matchmaker\\" or a \\"go-between\\", which is usually referred to the husband. The nakodo couple plays such an important role that their names appear on the announcement of the wedding. The purpose of the nakodo is to symbolize a stable marriage. As the two couples appear a special effect of a cloud of white smoke will appear to surround them. Simultaneously, the hall lights are dimmed and the stage lighting will turn to the color of rose-pink; this astonishes the guests. Pictures are to be taken during the dramatic entrances of the bride and the groom. After the photographs have been taken, they will be led back to their table. At this point the Master of Ceremonies will congratulate the newlyweds and their family. He/she will then introduce the nakodo, who will start the opening speeches and more speeches will follow. Being that the reception is highly structured the speakers will have the idea of being formal and concise in mind. With all the speeches finished, the bride and the groom will perform the Western-style traditions, which include the following: (1) the cake cutting ceremony and (2) the newlyweds' first dance as husband and wife. The next part of the reception is the toast, or kanpai, which simplifies the mood of the reception where the guests can start to relax, eat, and drink. What follows the toast are the short congratulatory speeches made by relatives, friends, and colleagues. During this time, the bride has gone to change into her first costume and continues throughout the reception. However, the groom will also have a chance to change into his costume, which is the Western tuxedo. By the end of the night, both the bride and the groom have changed from their traditional Japanese attire to their Western-style attire. After their last change of costumes, the newlyweds will perform the candle service. Both will have a long, unlit candle, which will be lit from the table where their parents are seated. Next, the couple will walk around the room in a circle and light the candles placed on their guests' table. Once all the candles are lit, the newlyweds will return to their table where they will light what is called the Memorial Candle. By the time the candle service is done the two hours restriction will soon expire. The remaining few minutes includes short speeches, songs, dances, etc. As the reception ends a flower presentation ceremony will take place, which is where the newlyweds will present their parents with a gift of flowers to display appreciation for their parents raising them to the people they are today. At this point, the reception has ended with quick flashes and farewells. =South Korean wedding customs= Southeast Asian customs =Burmese wedding customs= =Filipino wedding customs= The groom usually wears the Barong Tagalog during the wedding, along with the male attendants, though nowadays the wealthy opt to don Western attire such as a tuxedo. Weddings held within the same year by two siblings, usually sisters, called Sukob are frowned upon as it is regarded as bad luck. Some hold it that the wedding rings dropping to the ground is a portent of bad luck (this is usually said to the ring bearer to ensure that the child is careful in handling the rings). Money, in the form of paper bills, is sometimes taped or pinned to the groom and bride's dress during their first dance. =Vietnamese wedding customs= =Singapore wedding customs= Singapore is a highly inter-racial country in Southeast Asia. The main races of people in Singapore include Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasians. As a result of that, the types of wedding customs in Singapore vary relatively widely. For the majority of Chinese, weddings in Singapore would have a day event where the groom will pick up the bride with a tea ceremony followed by a church lunch or dinner banquet. =Thai wedding customs= =Malay wedding customs= A Malay wedding ceremony spreads over two days, beginning with the akad nikah ceremony on the first day. The groom signs the marriage contract and agrees to provide the bride with a mas kahwin (dowry). After that, their hands are dyed with henna during the berinai besar ceremony. On the second day, the bride is with her family and friends with musicians and bunga manggar or palm blossom carriers at the bride's house. At the house they are greeted with sprinkling of yellow rice and scented water. =Minangkabau wedding customs= Minangkabau wedding in West Sumatera, Indonesia As a matrilineal society, the bride family will be the one who proposes to the groom. This tradition is called maminang. If proposal is accepted, they will sign marriage contract. For the ceremony, manjapuik marapulai, the bride family will invite the groom, then, they will be shown to the public as newly married couple. North American customs =United States customs= A 2004 California wedding between a Filipina bride and a Nigerian groom Most weddings in the United States follow a similar pattern to an English wedding. It traditionally follows the white wedding type (see also Wedding types below), which originates from the white color of the bride's wedding dress, but refers to an entire wedding routine. Customs and traditions vary, but common components are listed below. ;Before the wedding *The host sends invitations to the wedding guests, usually one to two months before the wedding. Invitations may most formally be addressed by hand to show the importance and personal meaning of the occasion. Large numbers of invitations may be mechanically reproduced. As engraving was the highest quality printing technology available in the past, this has become associated with wedding invitation tradition. Receiving an invitation does not impose any obligation on the invitee other than promptly accepting or declining the invitation, and offering congratulations to the couple.Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the- Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.647, *While giving any gift to the newlywed couple is technically optional, nearly all invited guests who attend the wedding choose to do so. Wrapped gifts can be brought to the wedding ceremony or reception, but it's considered thoughtful to have them delivered to the address on the wedding invitation or to the address given with the couple's bridal registry. Typical gifts are useful household items, such as dishes, silverware, kitchen utensils and appliances, or towels. Guests are not obligated to use the couple's registry information. *A color scheme is selected by some to match everything from bridesmaids' dresses, flowers, invitations, and decorations, though there is no necessity in doing so. *The groom's friends throw a party for the groom, called a \\"bachelor party\\". It usually involves alcohol and racy entertainment, as this is supposedly the groom's last chance to engage in debauchery before marriage. It has become increasingly popular for the bride's friends to organize similar \\"bachelorette\\" parties. ;At the wedding *A wedding ceremony may take place anywhere, but often a church, courthouse, or outdoor venue is selected. The ceremony may be dictated by the couple's religious practices, or lack thereof. The most common non-religious form is derived from a simple Anglican ceremony in the Book of Common Prayer, and can be performed in less than ten minutes, although it is often extended by inserting music or speeches. *American brides usually wear a white, off-white, silver, or other very light-colored dress, particularly at their first marriage.Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior: Freshly Updated, Judith Martin, 2007, p. 414, Brides may choose any color, although black is strongly discouraged by some as it is the color of mourning in the west. *White seeds, or confetti is sometimes thrown at the newlyweds as they leave the ceremony to symbolize fertility. Some individuals, churches or communities choose birdseed due to a false but widely believed myth that birds eating the rice will burst. Because of the mess that rice and birdseed make, modern couples often leave in clouds of bubbles. *The wedding party may form a receiving line at this point, or later at a wedding reception, so that each guest may briefly greet the entire wedding party. ;At the wedding reception *Drinks, snacks, or perhaps a full meal, especially at long receptions, are served while the guests and wedding party mingle. *Often, best men and/or maids of honor will toast newlyweds with personal thoughts, stories, and well-wishes; sometimes other guests follow with their own toasts. Champagne is usually provided for this purpose. *In a symbolic cutting of the wedding cake, the couple may jointly hold a cake knife and cut the first pieces of the wedding cake, which they feed to each other. In some sub- cultures, they may deliberately smear cake on each other's faces, which is considered vulgar elsewhere. *If dancing is offered, the newlyweds first dance together briefly. Sometimes a further protocol is followed, wherein each dances next with a parent, and then possibly with other members of the wedding party. Special songs are chosen by the couple, particularly for a mother/son dance and a father/daughter dance. In some subcultures, a dollar dance takes place in which guests are expected to dance with one of the newlyweds, and give them a small amount of cash. This practice, as is any suggestion that the guests owe money to the couple, is considered rude in most social groups as it is contrary to basic western etiquette.Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the- Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p. 580 *In the mid-twentieth century it became common for a bride to toss her bouquet over her shoulder to the assembled unmarried women during the reception. The woman who catches it, superstition has it, will be the next to marry. In a similar process, her groom tosses the bride's garter to the unmarried men, followed by the man who caught the garter placing it on the leg of the woman who caught the bouquet. While still common in many circles, these practices (particularly the latter) are falling out of favor in the 21st century.Miss Manners Guide for the Turn- of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p. 638 Wedding gifts The purpose of inviting guests is to have them witness a couple's marriage ceremony and vows and to share in their joy and celebration. Gifts for the wedding couple are optional, although most guests attempt to give at least a token gift of their best wishes. Some couples and families feel that in return for the expense they put into entertaining and feeding their guests, the guests should pay them with similarly expensive gifts or cash.How much money you should give for a wedding, \\"How to figure out how much money you should give for a wedding gift\\", Business Insider, Retrieved 18 July 2017. Others believe this is contrary to proper etiquette.Miss Manners Guide for the Turn- of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.587, The couple often registers for gifts at a store well in advance of their wedding. This allows them to create a list of household items, usually including china, silverware and crystalware, linens or other fabrics, pots and pans, etc. Registries are intended to aid guests in selecting gifts the newlyweds truly want, and the service is sufficiently profitable that most retailers, from luxury shops to discount stores, offer the opportunity. Registry information should, according to etiquette, be provided only to guests upon direct request, and never included in the invitation.Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior: Freshly Updated, Judith Martin, 2007, p. 435, Some couples additionally or instead register with services that enable money gifts intended to fund items such as a honeymoon, home purchase or college fund. Some find bridal registries inappropriate as they contravene traditional notions behind gifts, such as that all gifts are optional and delightful surprises personally chosen by the giver, and that registries lead to a type of price-based competition, as the couple knows the cost of each gift. Traditionally, weddings were considered a personal event and inviting people to the wedding who are not known to at least one member of the couple well enough to be able to choose an appropriate gift was considered inappropriate, and registries should therefore be unnecessary.Miss Manners Guide for the Turn-of-the-Millennium, Judith Martin, 1990, p.643, Whether considered appropriate or not, others believe that weddings are opportunities to extract funds or specific gifts from as many people as possible, and that even an invitation carries an expectation of monetary reward rather than merely congratulations. Letters of thanks for any gift are traditionally sent promptly after the gift's receipt. Tradition allows wedding gifts to be sent up to a year after the wedding date. Thanks should be sent as soon as possible, preferably within two weeks. African-American customs Jumping the broom developed out of the West African Asante custom. The broom in Ashanti and other Akan cultures also held spiritual value and symbolized sweeping away past wrongs or warding off evil spirits. Brooms were waved over the heads of marrying couples to ward off spirits. The couple would often but not always jump over the broom at the end of the ceremony. The custom took on additional significance in the context of slavery in the United States. Slaves had no right to legal marriage; slaveholders considered slaves property and feared that legal marriage and family bonds had the potential to lead to organization and revolt. Marriage rituals, however, were important events to the Africans, who came in many cases come from richly ceremonial African cultures. Taking marriage vows in the presence of a witness and then leaping over the handle of a broom became the common practice to create a recognized union. Brooms are also symbols of the hearth, the center of the new family being created. There are also traditions of broom jumping in Europe, in the Wicca and Celtic communities especially. South American customs =Brazil customs= The South American country of Brazil features a host of traditions and customs within its culture. For Brazilian brides, these traditions lead to extravagant, fun-filled weddings. ;Preparations *Bridesmaids and groomsmen are chosen months before the time of the wedding. Those selected consist of couples paired off at the altar, usually three men and three women for the brides side and more three men and three women for the grooms side. The groom arrives at the wedding ceremony location first. The bride comes to the location, usually a church, at least 10 minutes after the groom's arrival. The two should not see each other before the ceremony, however, as it is believed this will bring bad luck. *In a military officer's wedding, the roles of groomsmen are replaced by swordsmen of the sword honor guard. They are usually picked as close personal friends of the groom who have served with him. Their role includes forming the traditional saber arch for the married couple and guests to walk through. *Some time before the wedding, usually about one month, either the bride, or her best friends, organizes a \\"kitchen shower\\" (wedding shower) with the purpose of giving the bride an intimate reunion with her closest friends. This party used to be a \\"girls-only\\" event, and was usually a small intimate party. Nowadays not only have the parties gotten bigger, but they also have started to admit men to the event. The person that is invited to this kind of party usually gives the bride something for her kitchen; hence the name \\"kitchen shower\\", and not wedding shower. *The wedding ceremony and party are usually paid by the wife's family, although this is a tradition that is not always followed, understandably because of the high costs involved. ;Ceremony *Brazilian wedding ceremonies normally follow Christian traditions closely. The bride and groom recite wedding vows to each other after a prayer is read. Then the bride and groom exchange wedding rings. These rings are usually engraved with the name of the groom on the bride's ring and the name of the bride on the groom's ring. *After the religious ceremony, the newlyweds usually throw a big party were they receive the compliments from all the guests. The party usually happens in a different place, a private party house that in Brazil is called a \\"ceremonial.\\" A lot of singing and dancing goes on usually after the couple dances a Waltz. ;Reception *Receptions for Brazilian weddings involve food, drinks and music. The married couple gives gifts to their parents, while the parents bestow a number of gifts upon the couple. *Another unique thing about the weddings in Brazil is a sweet called \\"bem casado\\" (well married), which is normally given to the guests on their way out. It is considered to bring good luck to the couple. Usually towards the end of the party or before the married couple leaves, the bride throws her flower bouquet to her unmarried friends. The belief is that whoever catches the bouquet will be the next one to marry. One other tradition for offering fortune to the couple is for the bride's friends is to write their names on the inner part of the bride's dress. This is also said to help the unmarried bride's friends to find a husband for them. The Brazilian culture is very rich with its numerous traditions, celebrations, and in many cases superstitions. Wedding celebrations are definitely inserted in this context. This is considered a festive event for the Brazilian society and thus it is usually celebrated with a lot of music, dances and overall happiness.

History  Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta (UMS) is an institution of higher education under Persyarikatan Muhammadiyah. UMS stands on the Decree of the Minister of Education and Culture (Decree no. 0330/O/1981 October 24, 1981) which changed its name from IKIP Muhammadiyah Surakarta.

Education Ellis, born in London on 24 January 1823, was the son of S. Helbert Ellis – a prominent member of the Jewish community in London – and Fanny Ellis, daughter of Samuel Lyons de Symons. Educated at University College School, he matriculated at London University in 1839 and went to Haileybury. There he distinguished himself in all branches of study, and left in 1843 as senior student to enter the civil service of Bombay. Career His first appointment in India was as third assistant-collector and magistrate of Ratnagiri district; he was promoted to the post of second assistant in 1847, and in 1848 was made commissioner for investigating certain claims upon the Nizam's government. In 1851, Ellis arrived in Sindh as assistant-commissioner, and from 1855 to 1857 was in charge of the offices of chief commissioner during the absence in England of Sir Henry Bartle Frere. He was made special commissioner for jagirs or alienated lands in the province, before leaving Sindh in 1858. In 1859, he was collector and magistrate at Bharuch district, and, after serving as chief secretary of the Bombay government, was nominated an additional member in 1862 and an ordinary member in 1865 of the Bombay council. Five years later, he was promoted to the Viceroy's council. Later life In 1875, Ellis returned to England, and was made not only K.C.S.I. but a member of the Indian council in London. He took a prominent part in the affairs of the Jewish community of London, being vice-president of the Anglo- Jewish Association and of the Jews' College, where a portrait has since been placed. He published a report on education in Sindh (Bombay, 1856), and edited George Stack's Dictionary of Sindhi and English (Bombay, 1855). He was an active member of the Royal Asiatic Society, which he joined in 1876, and founded a prize in Bombay University; a scholarship there was established in his honour in 1875. In 1885, he retired from the Indian council, on whose deliberations he had exerted much influence. He died at Evian-les-Bains, France, on 20 June 1887, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery at Willesden, Middlesex, on 28 June. Ellis was highly regarded by his contemporaries; Sir George Birdwood described him as \\"one of the ablest revenue officers of the Bombay Presidency\\". While at Bombay, Ellis was exceptionally popular with all classes of native Indians. He was at all times accessible to them, both in India and England, and the native newspapers eulogised him unstintedly at the time of his death. He left a sum of 2,500l. in trust for the poor of Ratnajiri, his first official charge. He was not married. The Ellis Bridge in Ahmedabad, Gujarat was named after him.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as \\"At Risk, Naturally Uncommon\\" by the Department of Conservation. I. dulcior is the first lepidoptera species described as endemic to the Poor Knights Islands. Taxonomy and etymology This species was first described by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2010 using a specimen collected at the Tawhiti Rahi South Ridge on Poor Knights Island on the 3 December 1980 by R.H. Kleinpaste. Hoare named the species Izatha dulcior. The epithet of this name is derived from the Latin word dulcior meaning gentler. It refers to the lack of deciduous cornuti in the vesica of the male as well as the lack of a sharp point on the outer edge of the forewing basal fascia. These features distinguish this species from Izatha epiphanes. The holotype specimen is held at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection.  Description  The wingspan is 18.5–24.5 mm for males and 19.5–20.5 mm for females. In appearance this species is very similar to darker forms of I. epiphanes. However, as mentioned previously, it can be distinguished from this species by the difference in the forewing colouration as well as the structural differences in the male genitalia.  Distribution  The species is endemic to New Zealand. It is the first lepidoptera species to be described as endemic to Poor Knights Islands.

Origins At the Battle of Nicopolis in 1396 Turkish archers were stationed behind a barrier of stakes. This may have inspired Henry V when he instructed his men to provide themselves with six foot stakes, which were to be planted in front of them at an angle to impale horses of attacking French men-at-arms prior to the Battle of Agincourt, in 1415. Deployment There are three schools of thought about the deployment of stakes. The traditional view is that all the stakes were placed in front of the front rank to create a fence. In 1976, John Keegan proposed that each archer placed his stake in front of him where he stood in the ranks, thus creating a defensive belt of stakes several yards wide within which the archers operated. Keegan's proposal has been challenged by Clifford J. Rogers, who argues that most stakes were placed in a fence arrangement, with staggered gaps for archers to move through, in combination with a band of more widely spaced stakes. Usage After the Agincourt campaign, stakes became a common piece of equipment for the English longbowman fighting in France. After the end of the Hundred Years War, stakes continued to be used, for example at the Battle of Blore Heath during the Wars of the RosesStrickland and Hardy (2005), p.371 and by the English mercenaries at the Battle of Montlhéry during the War of the Public Weal.Strickland and Hardy (2005), p.362 Tudor archers also used stakes in the early 16th century. Henry VIII's army which invaded France in 1513 carried 5000 stakes in wagons and iron-bound archers' stakes are mentioned on several occasions thereafter.

Infantrie-division) was a Wehrmacht division used in the Second World War. It participated in the German defence in the Battle of Normandy, and took part in the German counter-offensive in the Ardennes. Operational history The 85th Infantry Division was raised in February 1944 and placed under the command of Lieutenant General Kurt Chill, previously the commanding officer of the 122nd Infantry. Participating as an occupational division in German-occupied France, the 85th was part of the 15th Army's rear-guard in Northern France during the D-Day landings. It was moved to Normandy in early August as part of a relief force in the forming Falaise pocket, where it was to replace the 12th SS-Panzer Division \\"Hitlerjugend\\" by August 11. On August 14, the division received help from second company of the 102nd SS Heavy Panzer Battalion as it travelled from Assy to Maizieres; its commander was killed when the escort convoy encountered a group of Sherman tanks attached to the 1st Hussars. On August 15, the Canadian 4th Armoured Division broke through the 85th's defences around the Falaise pocket. =The Netherlands= Damaged, the division was ordered back to Germany to replenish its numbers. However, Chill ordered his men to form a number of reception stations at the bridgeheads of the Albert Canal in northern Belgium; his idea was to pick up stragglers as a means of gaining numbers, instead. The month of its relocation to the Netherlands also coincided with Operation Market Garden, the allied invasion of the Netherlands. Under attack by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division in early October, \\"Kampfgruppe Chill\\", a detachment of the 85th, was assigned to the Scheldt to replace the retreating 346th Infantry Division. This was however, part of a deception by Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich von der Heydte to fool the Canadians into attacking a much more powerful force. In reality, the detachment consisted of the 185th Artillery Regiment and remnants of the 1053rd and 1054th Grenadier Regiments. The rest of the force consisted of three battalions of the 2nd Parachute Division. The Calgary Highlanders, unaware of the true size and skill of the division group, suffered bitterly at Hoogerheide due to this deception, which was worsened by the arrival of the 244th and 667th Army Assault Gun Brigades. Chill was replaced as division commander by the highly decorated Major General Helmut Bechler in mid-November. Also in mid-November, the division had been separated between armies, with parts going to the 15th Army's 98th Army Corps and the 1st Parachute Army. The division, along with the 15th Army's LXXIV Army Corps, participated in the Battle of Hürtgen Forest in December 1944 as the Wehrmacht attempted to force the Allies out of the Ardennes. The division under Bechler continued to hold out against Allied advances until its final capitulation in March 1945; the rest of the corps would be destroyed at the Ruhr pocket the following April in the Battle of Aachen. Remnants of the division were merged with others to form Infantry Division Potsdam.

Engraved view of the town and roads of Singapore from government hill, from an Elliot sketch Elliot (Elliott) was the son of the Reverend Robert Elliot and Mary. His father was a younger brother of Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto, the Governor-General of India between 1807 and 1813. His cousin, Minto's son, George served during the same period. He entered the Royal Navy as a Cadet in 1802, and served his country with honour during the Napoleonic War. His name appeared in the London Gazette in 1807, and he was made a lieutenant for his gallantry in charge of the boats of the Fox, in 1808 when he was severely wounded in trying to cut out a ship from Batavia Roads. Promoted to Lieutenant in 1808, and from then to 1814 he served in the East Indies. He was made Commander on 27 August 1814. From 1822 to 1824 he was in command of a vessel that toured India, Canton, and the Red Sea during this period he made numerous on the spot sketches. When in London on retirement, he busied himself with charity work for benefiting sailors, and support for a sailors’ home. The Sailors' Home, Well-street, was originally founded in 1828 by Captain R. J. Elliot, R.N., Admiral G. C. Gambier, and Lieut. R. Justice, R.N., who, in the previous year, had successfully started the Destitute Sailors' Asylum; the destruction of the Brunswick Theatre in Well-street affording the opportunity for carrying out the scheme. Up to that time nothing had been done for the protection of seamen. In 1846 he was awarded the commander's out pension of Greenwich Hospital. He died at Pentonville on 30 April 1849. Some of the sketches he had made on his travels were published under the title View in the East in 1833. In that edition, the letterpress descriptions were drawn from a variety of published works, including Amelia Heber’s posthumous edition of Reginald Heber’s Narrative of a Journey through the Upper Provinces of India (1828). In the 1835 edition, the publishers Fisher & Co. commissioned Emma Roberts to write new letterpress. These sketches were worked up by Samuel Prout, Clarkson Stanfield, and others into finished drawings and consequently engraved; they were published in parts by Fisher & Co., appearing 1830–1833, under the title, Views in the East, comprising India, Canton, and the Red Sea, with Historical and Descriptive Letterpress by Emma Roberts. Views in India, China, and on the Shores of the Red Sea was published in 1835.

It is endemic to New Zealand.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1931 using seven specimens collected by George Hudson in Wellington during the months of December and January. Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in his 1928 work The butterflies and moths of New Zealand under the name Izatha balanophora but later corrected his taxonomic error in 1939.  Description  The larva of this species has not been described. The adult moth has a wingspan of 15.5–21 mm for males and 17–25 mm for females. Adults are on wing from October to February. The appearance of the adult moths of this species is variable and as a result it was originally confused with Izatha balanophora. However it can be distinguished from this species as I. mesoschista has a bold black line in the middle of the disk on its forewings. This line also assists in distinguishing I. mesoschista from Izatha epiphanes. Other than using their collection location as a guide, it is difficult to distinguish between I. mesoschista and Izatha haumu. I. haumu is found at the top of the North Island and I. mesochista is present south of this locality, over the rest of the North Island. However a male I. mesoschista can be distinguished from both I. haumu and I. epiphanes by the species characteristic three pronged tip of its genitalia.  Distribution  I. mesoschista is endemic to New Zealand. This species has been found throughout the North Island, except the Aupouri Peninsula, Hawkes Bay or the Wairarapa. It is regarded as one of the most common and widespread species in the genus Izatha to be found in the North Island.  Host plants  Coriaria arborea Specimens have been reared from Populus species, presumably from the dead wood, and also from pine logs. Larvae of this species have also been extracted or reared from Coriaria arborea and Coprosma species.  Trapping techniques  This species is readily attracted to light.

Early years John Russell, 1789) Elliott was born 17 January 1792, the son of Charles Elliott of Grove House, Clapham, and his second wife, Eling, daughter of Henry Venn, the well-known vicar of Huddersfield. Charles Elliott had eight children by his second marriage; Henry Venn was his eldest son and fourth child; other children included Charlotte Elliott and Edward Bishop Elliott. Henry Venn was sent to school, under a Mr. Elwell of Hammersmith, at the age of eight. In January 1809 he was transferred to the Rev. H. Jowett of Little Dunham, Norfolk. He went to Trinity College, Cambridge, in October 1810; became a scholar of his college in 1811; and graduated as fourteenth wrangler in 1814, winning also the second chancellor's medal. He was elected to a fellowship of Trinity in October 1816. Career He had suffered from overwork, and in July 1817 set out to recover his health by a foreign tour, which extended to Greece, Constantinople, and Jerusalem, a journey attended with some risk in those days. He returned to England in August 1820 . He lived at Cambridge for some time, and was ordained deacon in November 1823 and priest in June 1824. After holding the curacy of Ampton, Suffolk, for two years, he returned to Cambridge in 1825. His father had now moved to Westfield Lodge, Brighton, and soon afterwards built the proprietary chapel of St. Mary's in that town. It was consecrated 18 January 1827. Elliott was appointed the first preacher, and inherited the property upon his father's death, on 15 October 1832. For a few years previous to 1832 Elliott held also the priory of St. John's, Wilton, near Salisbury. He took pupils for a time, among whom were Sir Edward Fowell Buxton and the sons of Lord Aberdeen. He was afterwards fully occupied by his various duties. In 1832 he made proposals for the foundation of a school for the daughters of poor clergymen, in imitation of the school founded by his friend William Carus-Wilson at Cowan Bridge, Yorkshire, in 1823. The school was opened as St. Mary's Hall on 1 Aug. 1836. Elliott himself gave liberal donations, many of them anonymously, and during the rest of his life took an active part in its management. In September 1849 the new church of St. Mark's, intended to provide for the district of Kemp Town and St. Mary's Hall, was opened, after many obstacles had been overcome by Elliott's energy and liberality. Elliott took a prominent part in providing for the religious needs of Brighton, then rapidly developing. He was a sincere evangelical, and especially anxious for the strict observance of Sunday. In 1852 he spoke at a public meeting against the proposal for opening the Crystal Palace on Sundays, and his remarks were taken to amount to a charge of venality against the Times for defending the measure. He repudiated the intention, but was severely censured for his rash language. Family On 31 October 1833 Elliott married Julia, daughter of John Marshall of Hallsteads, Ulleswater, some of whose religious poems are given in Lord Selborne's 'Book of Praise.' She died of scarlet fever on 3 November 1841, her fifth child, Julius, having been born on 24 October. Her death was followed by those of his mother, 16 April 1843, his favourite sister, Mary, three months later, and his eldest son, Henry Venn, from the effects of a fall, on 2 June 1848. His second son, Charles Alfred, became a distinguished member of the Indian civil service. Julius Marshall, the third son, was killed on the Schreckhorn 27 July 1869. Elliott died at Brighton on 24 January 1865. He left two daughters. Works His works consist of a number of separate sermons and a collection of hymns.

She worked in the filter room, a top-level British air defence hub which assessed radar reports in order to give air raid warnings. Later, while posted to Belgium, she was part of a team of mathematicians who alerted Allied forces to the location of V-2 rocket launch sites. Younghusband completed a university degree at the age of 87 and subsequently published three books about her wartime experiences: two memoirs and one children's book. Early life Eileen Le Croissette was born in London in 1921. She left school shortly after her 16th Birthday and worked in the head office of Scottish Provident in London, who provided life assurance. She worked as an au pair in France after her German teacher suggested she gain experience in speaking French and German to help set up his new business, the 'School Travel Service'. She worked for the Boucher family until Hitler remilitarised the Rhineland, when she returned home. On this journey she encountered many fleeing Jews. Upon her return, she worked for Corke Sons & Co. as a secretary. Whilst working here, she visited Germany in the Summer of 1939. She went to a paper factory connected to her employers but also to a professor known to her German teacher, as she still had hope of the School Travel Service. She returned in early August 1939, 3 weeks before war began. =War begins= Eileen Le Croissette was invited back to work at Scottish Provident, after conscription led to a shortage of men, and was a valued employee, with rooms in the city. Le Croissette experienced the first Blitz on 24 August 1940. This led to her deciding to join the WAAF. Wartime service Eileen Le Croissette joined the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) in 1941 at the age of 19, and was trained at RAF Innsworth, near Gloucester, and RAF Leighton Buzzard. Commissioned as an assistant section officer in November 1941, and promoted to section officer in October 1942, she was posted to 10 Group Fighter Command at RAF Rudloe Manor, Corsham, near Bath, where she was deployed as a filter officer.David Irving, The Mare's Nest (1964), London: William Kimber and Co, p. 17. In this post, she was responsible for assessing the information gleaned from Chain Home coastal radar stations, estimating position, height and number of enemy forces in the air – essential for establishing Britain's defence network and giving air raid warnings.Not an Ordinary Life These teams had a matter of seconds to calculate accurately the whereabouts of both friendly and enemy aircraft. This information was essential since the RAF had a limited number of fighter aircraft and trained pilots, and limited supplies of fuel. After further training at RAF Bawdsey, she went to 9 Group, RAF Barton Hall, and then to Fighter Command headquarters at RAF Bentley Priory, Stanmore.One Woman's War, p. 158 In 1944, she was posted to 33 Wing, RAF Second Tactical Air Force at Mechelen (Malines), Belgium, with a small team of women using their mathematical skills to detect the mobile launchers of the V-2 rockets aimed at London and the vital port of Antwerp. \\"Our job was to extrapolate the curve of the V-2 from the place it landed back to the launch site, and we did that once we knew the fall of shot and we got the position of the top of curve, we then used a slide rule in geometry to find the launch site,\\" she told the BBC. Allied aircraft could then bomb the launch vehicles. She remained at Mechelen until June 1945. Following VE Day she was seconded to the Breendonk concentration camp, where she acted as a guide and interpreter (she was a fluent French speaker), relaying to RAF personnel the realities of war. She resigned her commission on 14 December 1945 and moved into hotel work. Later years Younghusband graduated from the Open University at the age of 87, and wrote two volumes of memoirs, Not an Ordinary Life (2009) and One Woman's War (2011), the latter dealing more specifically with her wartime experience. She later adapted her books for children and in 2016, just weeks before her death, her children's book Eileen's War was published. = Recognition = Younghusband campaigned on health and education issues, such as cuts to adult education, and she was awarded the British Empire Medal in the 2013 New Year Honours for services to lifelong learning. Britain's Got Talent finalist Nathan Wyburn created a portrait of Younghusband from wartime images of her to commemorate her World War II work. A life-size statue of Younghusband as a young WAAF officer stands in a replica filter room at the Battle of Britain Museum at Bentley Priory.

Originally built as part of the Rhine Railway, a through main line, it now forms a branch line from Karlsruhe to Hochstetten. The line runs along the western edge of the forest of Hardtwald, from which it takes its name. Today the line is owned and operated, as part of the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe, by the Albtal-Verkehrs-Gesellschaft (AVG).  Route =Hardt Railway (since 1979)= The safe-working system on the line changes from the German tram operating procedures (BOStrab) to rail operating procedures (EBO) north of Haus Bethlehem station. Once the track has returned to street level, it passes across a \\"bridge to nowhere” over the unfinished Karlsruhe Nordtangente (north tangent) highway. It then runs through an S-curve on to the route of the old Hardt line and follows it to Eggenstein. Shortly after it crosses the Pfinz flood relief canal (Pfinz-Entlastungskanal) it leaves the route of the Hardt line to run further west through the centre of Leopoldshafen. Between Leopolshafen and Linkenheim it comes within a few metres of the old route, but it then runs to the west of the Hardt line through the centre of Linkenheim to terminate in the housing estate of Langer Berg in Hochstetten. =Historic Hardt Railway (to 1967/1979)= A steam train on the old Hardt railway in 2015 Following the opening of the new Karlsruhe Central Station (Hauptbahnhof) in 1913, the old Hardt Railway followed the tracks of the Palatine Maximilian Railway to Mühlburg. One kilometre after Mühlburg station, the old Hardt Railway separates from the two tracks of the Palatine Maximilian Railway and turns to the right. It then runs directly through the industrial area of Knielingen and then crosses highway B 36. Just prior to Neureut it connects with the new Stadtbahn line and the old and new lines run on the same tracks to Eggenstein. The old Hardt Railway is damantled from Leopoldshafen, but the railway tracks can still easily be recognised on the outskirts of Leopoldshafen. In Linkenheim the route is now built over north of Bahnhofstraße. After that, the line ran on the far eastern edge of Hochstetten to pass through the Hardt forest, where the route can be made out again for a few kilometres to Graben-Neudorf station. Until 1913, the old Hardt Railway ran from the old Karlsruhe station (in the city centre at Ettlinger Tor) together with the Maxau Railway (Maxaubahn) as far as Mühlburger Tor station in a long, semi-circular curve and then separated from the Maxau Railway to continue to run north along the current Erzbergerstraße to Karlsruher Nordstadt, which was then in the middle of the Hardt forest. It then ran to the north for a few kilometres through an area that was undeveloped at the time, but which is now the location of the Neureut districts of Heide and Kirchfeldsiedlung, which were developed after the Second World War, to reach Neureut where it reached the route of the line opened in 1913. History =Opening and first years (1870–1890)= Construction of the Baden Mainline (Badische Hauptbahn) started in 1840 from Mannheim, running via Heidelberg to Karlsruhe, and it was extended to Basel by 1855. However, the indirect route via Heidelberg bypassed part of the natural catchment area of Mannheim which was located close to the Rhine, including towns such as Schwetzingen and Hockenheim. This led to a vigorous debate about the southern part of a proposed line from Mannheim to Karlsruhe close to the Rhine: under the plan, the railway would run via Linkenheim, Eggenstein and Neureut to Mühlburger Tor and from there run together with the Maxau Railway to Karlsruhe station. The Grand Duke of Baden, Frederick I approved the building of this route despite efforts to have the line run to the east of Karlsruhe.Koch, p. 129 It was accepted that through traffic in the north-south direction might not run on the line and that it would instead continue to run on the Heidelberg–Karlsruhe line. The Mannheim–Schwetzingen–Graben Neudorf–Eggenstein–Karlsruhe line via the Hardt forest was opened on 4 August 1870. It was called the Rhine Railway from the beginning. =Further development and decommissioning (1890–1967)= As it was expected that there would soon be another war with France, plans were made to build strategic railways. Against this background, the German general staff demanded above all a line on the Graben- Neudorf–Blankenloch–Karlsruhe–Durmersheim–Rastatt–Roeschwoog–Haguenau route, which was inaugurated in 1895.Koch, p. 131 Since the line via Blankenloch was shorter and more direct, trains on the Rhine Railway from then on ran on the strategic line. The Karlsruhe–Eggenstein–Graben-Neudorf section of the line, which was now called the Hardtbahn (Hardt Railway), was no longer used by through trains to Mannheim, instead services on the line ended in Graben- Neudorf. In 1900, it was decided to relocate Karlsruhe Central Station, which was then in the centre of the city at Ettlinger Tor to the then southern suburbs. This project, which was completed in 1913, involved relocating the route of the Hardt Railway within the city of Karlsruhe and the then independent municipality of Neureut. As a result, the Hart Railway now followed the relocated Maxau Railway (which was, in effect, the Baden section of the Palatine Maximilian Railway) to Mühlburg station and then continued for another kilometre, where it separated from the Maxau Railway to the right and ran straight towards Neureut. As a result of continuously falling patronage on the Hardt line, last listed in the timetable as line number 302e, since 1950, passenger services were abandoned on 28 May 1967.Bindewald, p. 107 The line was then dismantled between Graben-Neudorf and the turnoff to the east to the Nuclear Research Centre Karlsruhe (Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, now the North Campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology), which was located in the Hardt forest between Leopoldshafen and Linkenheim. Only the freight to the U.S. barracks in Neureut and to the Research Centre preserved the line from full closure. From 1952 to 1974 there was a siding connecting with the U.S. base at the old airfield on the pre-1913 route of the line. =Beginning of Stadtbahn operations (1967–1979)= Welschneureuter Str. stop: the \\"new Hardt Railway\\" branches to the left towards central Karlsruhe, the old line runs ahead towards Mühlburg After Neureut was incorporated in Karlsruhe in 1974, it was agreed to connect it to the Karlsruhe tram network. A route had been reserved for this purpose east of the Hardt Railway, running to the Neureut development area. The possibility of using the Hardt Railway to Neureut for the tram service was considered. From 1978, the AVG extended line A, which started on the Alb Valley Railway (Albtalbahn) or the Busenbach–Ittersbach railway, through Karlsruher Nordweststadt to Neureut. This was followed by lengthy and difficult negotiations between the AVG and Deutsche Bundesbahn. The originally planned route for a separate tram link has not been built on yet and it can still be seen clearly. On 23 December 1977, an agreement was finally reached between DB and AVG that would allow the AVG and DB freight to share use of the line in Neureut. An AVG multiple unit ran over the line to prove that operations were possible. Work then began. The redesigned section was opened to Neureut on 5 August 1979. A service ran as line A on the tracks of the Hardt Railway from Welschneureuter Straße station to the temporary terminus at Neureut Kirchfeld. The first trains ran at twenty-minute intervals to Neureut.Bindewald, p. 108 This extension of an inner city tram route on a former DB route was one of the steps in the development of the Karlsruhe model. Linkenheim Rathaus stop Terminus at Hochstetten in 2005; in 2008 the stop was moved away from the inconvenient curve =Extension to Leopoldshafen and Hochstetten (1979–1989)= On 2 July 1982, the city of Karlsruhe and the municipalities of Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen and Linkenheim-Hochstetten signed an agreement which provided for the extension of the Hardt Railway as far as Hochstetten.Bindewald, p. 184 In 1982, the city of Karlsruhe took over the line from the connection with the tram line from the DB. Freight on the line, however, was still operated by the DB. On 1 January 1987, the whole line from the tram loop in Nordweststadt to Neureut became the property of the AVG. In 1983, Stadtbahn multiple units were purchased to replace the articulated multiple units used by AVG on A line in August 1983. The new sets offered significantly more capacity. In November 1985, rebuilding began on the Hardt Railway between Neureut and Leopoldshafen.Bindewald, p. 185 This section was opened on 13 December 1986. It follows the route of the old Hardt Railway as far as Eggenstein and it then runs through the town centre in Leopoldshafen. In 1987 and 1988, several platforms on the Hardt Railway were raised to 38 centimetres to give passengers a less difficult entry into the vehicles and thus accelerate boarding. On 3 June 1989, the Hardt Railway was then extended to Hochstetten. The original plans had envisaged that the line would initially run through Linkenheim on the old route and then run on a new route through both Linkenheim and Hochstetten in order to open them up. Ultimately, the line was built entirely through the centre of Linkenheim on the former federal highway B 36, which was moved to a bypass in order to reduce conflicts with cars in the limited space in the town centres. =Further development (1989–1997)= Since 8 December 1989, a pair of trains run twice a day also to the Karlsruhe Research Centre.Bindewald, S. 109 The track was extended for this purpose within the site at the research centre so that a station could be built. Shortly thereafter, in early 1990, it was agreed to allow freight trains to the research centre to pass in future through the centre of Leopoldshafen, making the old Hardt railway between Eggenstein and the branch to the research centre unnecessary. It was therefore dismantled in 1990. A steam locomotive was parked for a long time on the old route of the Hardt railway in Leopoldshafen. The track was officially closed on 27 May 1997. In 1990, a second track was built on line in Neureut and, in 1992, a second track was built in Leopoldshafen between Frankfurter Str. station and the return loop. In early 1993, the section between Eggenstein Bahnhof (station) and Eggenstein Schweriner Str. was also rebuilt with two tracks. With the establishment of the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbunde (Karlsruhe Transport Association) in 1994, line A was finally renamed S 1 (for services on the Hochstetten–Ettlingen (–Bad Herrenalb) route) and S 11 (for services on the Hochstetten–Ettlingen–Ittersbach route). At the end of 1995, the new station of Eggenstein Süd was opened south of Eggenstein and the second track was extended from Eggenstein Bahnhof to the new station, so that the Hardt Railway is now continuously double-track in Eggenstein. In 1997, the section between Neureut-Kirchfeld station and the bridge over the highway 36 was duplicated and since then only about 500 metres of the line between Neureut and Eggenstein is single-track. The new double-track sections allow for better time keeping over the whole line. =Since 1998= The AVG has upgraded or replaced the remaining tracks in Neureut and between Neureut and Eggenstein, which in places were around 100 years old. In order to facilitate the management of the line, the AVG bought the entire line from the DB, including the freight link between Neureut and Mühlburg, and took over the operation of the remaining freight traffic on the Hardt Railway. In recent times there have been two fatal accidents on the Hardt Railway: at the end of 2003, a student was killed at Leopoldshafen Viermorgen and only a half year later there was a similar incident at Linkenheim Schulzentrum. Tram line in Karlsruhe Nordstadt opened in 2006 on the route of the Hardt Railway from 1870 to 1913 The 1870–1913 route of the Hardt Railway through Karlsruher Nordstadt has been used since May 2006 as part of the tram network of Verkehrsbetriebe Karlsruhe (Karlsruhe Transport Company, VBK) for tram line 3. Possible extension from Dettenheim to Philippsburg Attempts to have the Hardt Railway extended through the two Dettenheim districts of Liedolsheim and Rußheim to Philippsburg have not yet been implemented and it is unclear whether the extension will ever be realised. For a long time, according to the long-time chairman of the AVG Dieter Ludwig, there have only been \\"rough drawings with a pen.\\" Several years ago there were some preliminary investigations, which produced two options: both would leave the existing line just before the Hochstetten Altenheim stop and run straight ahead for about five hundred metres. The existing station would be relocated as a result. While one version would run through the middle of the towns of Hochstetten and Liedolsheim, the other would only pass through the outskirts of these towns. Under both options Hochstetten would receive another stop and Liedolsheim would receive a total of two stops. In both options the line would run through Rußheim to end at Philippsburg station on the Bruhrain Railway. Operations =Timetable= The \\"New Hardt Railway\\" is now integrated into the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn network as lines S 1 and S 11. Both lines run from Hochstetten through the centre of Karlsruhe and over the Alb Valley Railway towards Ettlingen. Neureut Bärenweg stop Between Karlsruhe and Neureut services operate at ten-minute intervals to about 9 PM. Services operate to Hochstetten during the same period at least every 20 minutes and there are a few services that terminate at Leopoldshafen. The DC-powered Stadtbahn vehicles operated by AVG on the line are similar in construction to Stadtbahnwagen B vehicles. Dual-system (AC/DC) vehicles were in use on the Hardt Railway only in 1991 and 1992. All stations have platforms with a height of 34 centimetres. Eggenstein Süd, Leopoldshafen Viermorgen, and Hochstetten Altenheim are request stops. =Operations to KIT Campus Nord = In the morning a total of two trains run to KIT Campus Nord (the north campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology). The trains are decoupled at the Leopoldshafen Frankfurter Strasse stop with the front carriages continuing to Hochstetten and the rear carriages running to Campus Nord. The trip to Campus Nord can only be used by local staff, so a security check is performed shortly before the train reaches the site of the Campus Nord. Campus Nord station consists of two terminating tracks. Since there is no turning loop, the incoming set must be equipped for two-way operations or the departing trains must be operated in reverse (most Karlsruhe Stadtbahn vehicles are designed to only run in one direction normally). Two trains depart from Campus Nord in the afternoon peak hour. They wait at the Leopoldshafen Frankfurter Strasse stop for the train from Hochstetten, which is then coupled to the rear.

Credit: NASA The Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) is a device designed to grow three-dimensional cell clusters in microgravity. In the early 1990s, NASA researchers began developing hardware that would let them study the cell tissues of mammals—including humans—in microgravity. They also needed it to protect the fragile cultures from the turbulence of Space Shuttle launch and landing. The resulting device enables the growth of tissue, cancer tumors and virus cultures outside the body, both in space and on Earth. The cell culture bioreactor—known commercially as the Rotary Cell Culture System (RCCS) -- boasts several advantages that exceed typical laboratory methods. Lab-grown cell cultures tend to be small, flat and two-dimensional, unlike normal cultures. But tissues grown in the RCCS are larger and three-dimensional, with structural and chemical characteristics similar to normal tissue. Additionally, the RCCS has no internal moving parts, therefore minimizing any forces that might damage the delicate cell cultures. Uses Using RCCS technology, researchers could potentially test chemotherapy agents on a patient's own cancer cells outside the patient's body. There are similar possibilities for AIDS research: the RCCS can produce human HIV host cells that can be infected and studied. Cell constructs grown in a rotating bioreactor on Earth (left) eventually become too large to stay suspended in the nutrient media. In the microgravity of orbit, the cells stay suspended. Credit: NASA Today, leading research facilities across the United States are employing the RCCS to study cancer, cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases such as the avian flu, Ebola virus and monkey pox. They're also using the RCCS to provide tissues for the development of HIV vaccines and other drugs. A closed tubular cylinder forms the system's cell culture chamber, which is filled with a liquid medium in which cells grow on micrometre-size beads. The chamber rotates around a horizontal axis, allowing the cells to develop in an environment similar to the free-fall of microgravity. Oxygen, required by cells for growth, is fed into the liquid medium through a porous wall in the chamber. The NASA researchers who led the development of the cell culture bioreactor were named co-recipients of the 1991 NASA Inventor of the Year Award because of their work on the project.

It is endemic to New Zealand, where it is widespread in the west part of the South Island. It has been collected in southern beech forests but larvae have been reared on dead kanuka or manuka bushes.  Taxonomy  Izatha heroica Philpott, 1926 This species was first described by Alfred Philpott in 1926 using a female specimen taken at Flora River, Mount Arthur in January. The holotype specimen is held at the New Zealand Arthropod Collection. Later that year Charles E. Clarke, thinking he was describing a new species, discussed and named the species Izatha toreuma. Clarke used a male specimen obtained from Arthurs Pass in January. This specimen is held at the Auckland War Memorial Museum. This name was synonymised by George Hudson in 1928.  Description  Philpott described the female of the species as follows: The wingspan is 23–29 mm for males and 27–32 mm for females. Adults have been recorded in January, February and early March. This species can be distinguished from similar species by its larger size, its greyish coloured forewing and the absence of a conical process on the top of the head.  Distribution  I. heroica is endemic to New Zealand and can only be found in the South Island. Although the species prefers the west side of the Island it has been collected in Nelson, Marlborough, Marlborough Sounds, Westland, Fiordland, North Canterbury, Buller, Otago Lakes, Central Otago, and Southland.  Behaviour and life cycle  This species is attracted to light.  Habitat and host plants  Beech forest habitat of the moth This species has been found in wetter forests of the western South Island including Nothofagus forest. Larvae have been reared from erect dead Leptospermum. The host may have been Kunzea ericoides or Leptospermum scoparium, since both were placed in the genus Leptospermum at this time. This rearing record has led to the hypothesis that the species is not dependent on beech forest for its survival.

Sony World Photography Awards, Cannes  He brought to India the World Photography Award – Student Focus at the Palais des Festival in Cannes, defeating finalists from all the other continents. It was won by the team he was leading, consisting of two of his students at AJK Mass Communication Research Centre, Jamia in 2009. In 2010, the team led by him were the Asia finalists. The award brought the focus of World Photography on India and AJK Mass Communication and Research Centre.  Research on the Female Gaze  Based on his study of curated work of various female photographers, Khan attributes the female gaze to anything that has been photographed by a woman which according to him is actually breaking the stereotypical view created by \\"male-constructed\\" photographs that have shown women in a certain light throughout the history of visual arts. = Campaign for Soldiers \\"Chitthi Aayi Hai\\" = In an attempt to encourage and inculcate letter-writing habit among youngsters, Khan conceived and curated a multimedia project #ChitthiAayiHai, where people photographed themselves and got it printed on a postcard, which they posted with a personalised message to their loved ones and soldiers. = Documenting Reality: Metaphors of Life = Khan delivered a lecture in Lucknow at the Lalit Kala Academy, talking about the importance of sound effects, the direction of light, and relation with characters in order to take a good picture. He used the examples from works of Vincent Van Gogh, Andrey Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock to explain the importance of image and its perception in relation with other mediums.

She acquired the WJ classification when the publicly owned New Zealand Railways Department (NZR) purchased the WMR and its locomotive fleet in 1908.  Introduction  The locomotive entered service in July 1904 with WMR road No. 3 (reused). She was the first WMR locomotive to have piston valves. A massive 2-8-4T tank engine, known as Jumbo, she was based at Wellington for all her life. She was acquired for banking duty out of Wellington up the Ngaio bank to Johnsonville, which had long grades of 1 in 40 up to Crofton (Ngaio) and Khandallah and tunnels No 1 to 5. She had worked 67,907 miles by 29 February 1908. Drivers and firemen alike, it has been written, hated Jumbo, but all agreed that for sheer brute strength this engine took a lot of beating. Like all Baldwin locomotives, the locomotive had cast frames of the bar type. In this case, they gave considerable trouble, for they persistently broke immediately behind the smokebox saddle. When taken into the NZR fleet in 1908, she was allocated her own class and NZR No. 466. With a tendency for breaking the bar frames on the heavy banking duty, she saw little service after 1920.  Withdrawal  The locomotive was withdrawn in 1927 and written off on 31 March 1928. The boiler was sent to the Taumarunui locomotive depot for use as a washout boiler.

Completion of educational benchmarks such as secondary school diplomas and bachelor's degrees represent academic achievement. Academic achievement is commonly measured through examinations or continuous assessments but there is no general agreement on how it is best evaluated or which aspects are most important—procedural knowledge such as skills or declarative knowledge such as facts. Furthermore, there are inconclusive results over which individual factors successfully predict academic performance, elements such as test anxiety, environment, motivation, and emotions require consideration when developing models of school achievement. Now, schools are receiving money based on its students academic achievements. A school with more academic achievements would receive more money than a school with less achievements. In California, the achievement of schools is measured by the Academic Performance Index.  Factors influencing academic achievement  =Individual differences influencing academic performance= Individual differences in academic performance have been linked to differences in intelligence and personality. Students with higher mental ability as demonstrated by IQ tests and those who are higher in conscientiousness (linked to effort and achievement motivation) tend to achieve highly in academic settings. A recent meta-analysis suggested that mental curiosity (as measured by typical intellectual engagement) has an important influence on academic achievement in addition to intelligence and conscientiousness. Children's semi-structured home learning environment transitions into a more structured learning environment when children start first grade. Early academic achievement enhances later academic achievement.Chart of comparative performance in GCSE results. Parent's academic socialization is a term describing the way parents influence students' academic achievement by shaping students' skills, behaviors and attitudes towards school. Parents influence students through the environment and discourse parents have with their children. Academic socialization can be influenced by parents' socio-economic status. Highly educated parents tend to have more stimulating learning environments. Further, recent research indicates that the relationship quality with parents will influence the development of academic self-efficacy among adolescent-aged children, which will in turn affect their academic performance. Children's first few years of life are crucial to the development of language and social skills. School preparedness in these areas help students adjust to academic expectancies. Studies have shown that physical activity can increase neural activity in the brain, specifically increasing executive brain functions such as attention span and working memory; and improve academic performance in both elementary school children and college freshmen. = Non-cognitive factors = Non-cognitive factors or skills, are a set of \\"attitudes, behaviors, and strategies\\" that promotes academic and professional success, such as academic self-efficacy, self-control, motivation, expectancy and goal setting theories, emotional intelligence, and determination. To create attention on factors other than those measured by cognitive test scores sociologists Bowles and Gintis coined the term in the 1970s. The term serves as a distinction of cognitive factors, which are measured by teachers through tests and quizzes. Non-cognitive skills are increasingly gaining popularity because they provide a better explanation for academic and professional outcomes.  Self- efficacy  Self-efficacy is one of the best predictors of academic success. Self-efficacy is the belief of being able to do something. Stajković et al. looked at the Big Five traits on academic success as well and saw that conscientiousness and emotional stability were predictors of self-efficacy in over half of their analyses. However, self-efficacy was more indicative of academic performance than personality in all of the analyses. This suggests that parents who want their children to have academic achievement can look to increase their child's sense of self-efficacy at school.  Motivation  Motivation is the reasoning behind an individual's actions. Research has found that students with higher academic performance, motivation and persistence use intrinsic goals rather than extrinsic ones. Furthermore, students who are motivated to improve upon their previous or upcoming performance tend to perform better academically than peers with lower motivation. In other words, students with higher need for achievement have greater academic performance.  Self-control  Self-control, in the academic setting, is related self- discipline, self-regulation, delay of gratification and impulse control. Baumeister, Vohs, and Tice defined self-control as \\"the capacity for altering one's own responses, especially to bring them into line with standards such as ideals, values, morals, and social expectations, and to support the attainment of long-term goals.\\" In other words, self-control is the ability to prioritize long-term goals over the temptation of short-term impulses. Self-control is usually measured through self completed questionnaires. Researchers often use the Self-Control Scale developed by Tangney, Baumeister, & Boone in 2004. Through a longitudinal study of the marshmallow test, researchers found a relationship between the time spent waiting for the second marshmallow and higher academic achievement. However, this finding only applied for participants who had the marshmallow in plain sight and were placed without any distraction tactics. High locus of control, where an individual attributes success to personal decision making and positive behaviors such as discipline, is a ramification of self-control. High locus of control has been found to have a positive predictive relationship with high collegiate GPA. = Extracurricular activities = Organized extracurricular activities have yielded a positive relationship with high academic performance including increasing attendance rates, school engagement, GPA, postsecondary education, as well as a decrease in drop out rates and depression. Additionally, positive developmental outcomes have been found in youth that engage in organized extracurricular activities. High school athletics have been linked with strong academic performance, particularly among urban youth. However, involvement in athletics has been linked to increased alcohol consumption and abuse for high school students along with increased truancy. While research suggests that there is a positive link between academic performance and participation in extracurricular activities, the practice behind this relationship is not always clear. Moreover, there are many unrelated factors that influence the relationship between academic achievement and participation in extracurricular activities (Mahoney et al., 2005). These variables include: civic engagement, identity development, positive social relationships and behaviors, and mental health (Mahoney et al., 2005). In other research on youth, it was reported that positive social support and development, which can be acquired through organized after school activities is beneficial for achieving academic success (Eccles & Templeton, 2002). In terms of academic performance there are a whole other group of variables to consider. Some of these variables include: demographic and familial influences, individual characteristics, and program resources and content (Mahoney et al., 2005). For example, socio-economic status has been found to plays a role in the number of students participating in extracurricular activities (Covay & Carbonaro, 2010). Furthermore, it is suggested that the peer relationships and support that develop in extracurricular activities often affect how individuals perform in school (Eccles & Templeton, 2002). With all these variables to consider it is important to create a better understanding how academic achievement can be seen in both a negative and positive light. In conclusion, most research suggests that extracurricular activities are positively correlated to academic achievement (Mahoney et al., 2005). It has been mentioned that more research could be conducted to better understand the direction of this relationship (Eccles & Templeton, 2002). Together this information can give us a better understand the exact aspects to consider when considering the impact that participation in extracurricular activities can have on academic achievement. = Successful educational actions = There are experiences analysed by research projects that show how the incorporation of Successful Educational Actions (SEAs) in schools with high absenteeism are contributing to the improvement of academic achievement.

It is classified as \\"Data Deficient\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1892 using a female specimen collected by George Hudson in Wellington and named Semiocosma caustopa. Hudson discussed and illustrated the species in his 1928 book The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand. The genus Semiocosma was subsequently synonymised with Izatha by Meyrick. The holotype specimen is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Meyrick originally described the species as follows: I. caustopa has a rather large wingspan for the genus: 24–26 mm for males and 29–31.5 mm for females. Distribution Hudson from The Butterflies and Moths of New Zealand (1928) This species is endemic to New Zealand. Although only known very locally this species has been found in the Taupo, Hawkes Bay, and Wellington areas. Hudson noted this species was found in a few patches of tree fuchsia at Gollans Valley and Wilton's Bush, Wellington; he collected his last specimen in 1942. A single specimen was collected in Ohakune in 1921, and two more at Puketitiri (near Napier), in 1964 and 1985. I. caustopa had not been seen for 30 years when two specimens was discovered in 2016 at Bushy Park near Whanganui.  Biology and host species  kōtukutuku Hudson reared the moths from dead branches of kōtukutuku (Fuchsia excorticata) collected in Karori, Wellington. He noted the larvae \\"feed during the winter months... driving burrows through the soft wood in all directions\\"—like most lichen tuft moths, they are probably feeding on fungi. They are full grown by about October. Adults have been recorded mostly in January and February, with single records for December and April.  Conservation status and rarity  This species has been classified as having the \\"Data Deficient\\" conservation status under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. Its rarity may be linked to the decline of its host tree, which is a favourite food of introduced possums. It may actually be quite common in small pockets of forest in the North Island, and simply have been overlooked, since it is not attracted to bright light the way most moths are; the specimens at Bushy Park were caught in a Malaise trap.

It is endemic to New Zealand. This species is classified as \\"At Risk, Naturally Uncommon\\" by the Department of Conservation.  Taxonomy and etymology  This species was first described by Robert J. B. Hoare in 2010 from a specimen collected by John S. Dugdale at Mount Auckland in Auckland and named Izatha dasydisca. The name of the species comes from the Greek word dasys (meaning shaggy) and diskos (indicating the disc of the forewing) and refers to the scale-tufts which help to distinguish this species from Izatha austera.  Description  The wingspan is 15–19 mm for males and about 26 mm for females. I. dasydisca is visually very similar to I. austera. However the male I. dasydisca can be distinguished by its mottled pale orange to reddish brown antennae. I. dasydisca also has large forewing scale-tufts and its hindwing shape is smoothly rounded. I. dasydisca has very dark hindwings which helps distinguish it from its near relative I. caustopa.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand, where it is only known from the northern half of the North Island in the Northland, Auckland and Gisborne areas.  Biology and behaviour  The larvae have yet to be discovered. Adults have been recorded on the wing in December, January and February. The species has been collected by sweeping and by capturing when at rest on a tree trunk. It appears this species is not attracted to light traps.  Hosts and habitat  The host species of the larvae of I. dasydisca are unknown. The adults of the species apparently prefers forest habitat as specimens have been collected in beech as well as podocarp forest.

Together, they exercise the entire body safely and gently. Chinese Wand was known as a \\"preventive\\" of disease while acupuncture was the \\"treatment.\\" History in China Although awareness of its existence is recent, Chinese Wand is said to be thousands of years old. It was passed down through Grand Masters and kept private for the use of the succeeding Chinese rulers and their families. They were devised for the emperor to slow down the aging process and maintain perfect health.Mary Jane Hunter, \\"Exercises for young and old.\\" March 1978, News-Press The exercises were derived from studying animals at play in nature, hence some of the names of the forms: \\"Springing of the Tiger,\\" \\"Raising of the Bird’s Wing,\\" \\"Panda Rolls,\\" to name a few. Chinese wand is not by itself taught as a method of self-defense. The source of all current information stems from Bruce L. Johnson, who is currently the only known living Grand Master of Chinese Wand. Coming To America According to Johnson, when he was 19 he learned the exercises from 93-year-old Grand Master Ch’eng in 1945. He and two Navy buddies, all wrestlers, were exploring Shanghai and were amazed by an 80-year- old rickshaw man's ability to pull a wide rickshaw with the three muscular seamen up and down the steep hills of Shanghai. Johnson pursued the slight Chinese man who eventually led him to the slender, regal Grand Master. Upon meeting Dr. Ch’eng at his home in Shanghai, the tall, 235-pound 19-year-old was unable to take down the 130 lb. Ch’eng who, seemingly inexplicably, fended him off and left him lying on the floor after each of three increasingly aggressive advances. He used an ancient \\"spinning\\" technique. Johnson, convinced that he had to learn everything this man could teach, was soon accepted as a student by Ch’eng, who was no doubt impressed and amused by the young headstrong man's potential and enthusiasm for learning all he could. Eventually Dr. Ch’eng, having lost his sons in the war between China and Japan, trusted Johnson enough to pass on the knowledge and techniques he would need to become the next Grand Master. Biography of Grand Master Bruce L. Johnson Minnesota-raised Bruce Leroy Johnson, (June 21, 1926- December 11, 2014) was a sickly child who overcame his early beginnings through exercise and body-building. Health and physical fitness became a lifelong passion, as well as a quest to stay young and embrace Nature. After high school, during World War II, the handsome blue-eyed, black-haired (of Swedish and Iroquois descent) Johnson became a Navy heavyweight wrestling championGareth Hiebert, \\"Afton Adonis is Married to the Oceans\\", Oliver Towne who excelled in physical exploits and competitions. He also was a navy ranger, and one of the first to reach the shores of Iwo Jima. His mother's sister was married to revered World War II journalist and author, Ernie Pyle, with whom Bruce had a close relationship and who was killed only a few miles from where Johnson was, on the island of Ie Shima.Palm Beach Post-Times, April 19, 1970. He is often called upon to accept memorial awards on behalf of his uncle.\\"Pyle’s Death is Recalled,\\" Honolulu Adviser, April 1970.Joe Rafferty, \\"’Bamboozle’ Weighty Problems with the Ancient Chinese Wand Exercises,\\" Norwich Bulletin, October 1975. Johnson studied at the Kodokan Institute in Tokyo, Japan where he earned three black belts in Judo.Alison Wyrley Birch, \\"The Magic in a Wand of Bamboo.\\" November 1975, The Sunday Republican Back in the states after World War II, Johnson tried to introduce the merits of the exercise system. But because of McCarthyism and the fear of Communism, there was little enthusiasm about anything Asian. Few showed interest in learning the unusual, oriental exercises. Meanwhile, wanderlust led Johnson around the world finding work, often on ships. He was a bodyguard for King Farouk for a time. Wherever he went in the world, he sought out others who might have heard of Chinese Wand, even placing ads in local papers. But he never found anyone. As far as he knew, he was the only one who knew about it. Johnson spent time in Hollywood and found a small group of health food and fitness enthusiasts such as Mae West, Jimmy Durante, and others who became students.Nelda Clemmons, \\"Chinese wand exercises a little magic,\\" December 1977, The Tampa Times It has been rumored that he might have been the inspiration for the song \\"Nature Boy\\" (popularized by Nat King Cole) when he claimed he spent time with the songwriter, Eden Ahbez. Later, he taught celebrities such as James Coburn who was photographed in People Magazine doing the exercises.\\"Over the Tube\\", People Magazine, 1977. Johnson became friends with Bruce Lee, and the two did demonstrations of strength and speed together. \\"Bruce [Lee] was the only man who could ever ‘handle’ me - of course, he never knew Dr. Cheng.\\"Karen Kaye, \\"Bruce Johnson and his Amazing Chinese Wand\\" Los Angeles Free Press, October 1975 Lee was quoted in Johnson’s book as saying, \\"All things are possible with the great Masters.\\" In 1965, Johnson became a hero when he rescued three children from a shark in the Bahamas by swimming out and averting its attention . A fourth child was killed. Armed with only a pointed shell he grabbed on the beach, he fought the beast a full five minutes underwater, his leg in its mouth until he jabbed its eye with the shell and was able to escape, barely making it to shore.\\"The Secret Strength of Bruce Johnson\\", Palm Beach Post-Times, February 1973 He won international acclaim and was honored by heads of three governments.The Tribune, October 1969. He caused another sensation in 1966 when he and a friend (who later became his wife) volunteered to spend an unspecified amount of time on an uninhabited Fiji Island with no supplies, only bathing suits and camera equipment. Learning too late that the island was far from idyllic limited their stay to 40 days, but caused national publicity.Webster K. Nolan, \\"Island Paradise Lost… to Hunger and Rats\\", UPI, January 1968. Dramatic adventures seemed to follow the elusive Johnson who often found himself at the right place in time to rescue others from extreme danger (over 50 documented at the risk of his own life) including fires, mangled cars, even abusive husbands. Johnson rarely spoke of his powers as a mystic. Students would sometimes notice supernatural transformations in his appearance as he taught the class. He was inclined to believe that Dr. Ch’eng was teaching through him. One famous psychic of his day, Peter Hurkos, upon meeting Johnson said, \\"Who is that beautiful Chinese man coming out of you?\\" Others saw Johnson transform: after a class in Eureka, California, a young student \\"asked him if he knew that he had become transformed into a Chinese person while he was performing the wand exercises. . .Did you see it too?...\\" another classmate added. It has also been said that the late Dr. Ch'eng's formidable, otherworldly presence was physically tangible, gentle, even erotic. Enthusiasm for Chinese Wand was minimal until a nationwide curiosity in Eastern philosophy erupted in the 1960s, beginning with the Beatles’ trip to India and the subsequent publicity. Interest in meditation techniques, yoga, martial arts, and other esoteric practices spiked. At last, Johnson was able to develop classes. Eventually, he self-published a book in 1975. In December 1976, Johnson, who also worked as a professional diver, was seriously injured in an underwater accident and sustained a near-fatal brain stem infarct causing stroke-like symptoms. Initially told he would never walk again, he once again defied odds and within a matter of months, was walking and looking as healthy as ever. Although still reeling from lingering and painful after-effects of the trauma, he managed to generate interest from a major publisher (William Morrow, New York) who published his book in hardcover in 1977. During the time he was striving to regain his health, he underwent a Christian \\"born-again\\" experience that eventually influenced his thinking and upended his belief system. He slowly rejected a holistic awareness of consciousness and abandoned his lifelong allegiance to preserving and re- introducing the teachings of Dr. Ch’eng and the art of Chinese Wand. The spreading of a popular desire to learn the more violent aspects of martial arts and the potential \\"danger\\" of involvement with the supernatural conflicted with his newfound ultra-conservative Christian views. Efforts to promote Chinese Wand diminished and eventually disappeared from public view. \\" --Oriental philosophy is at their [martial arts] heart,\\" Johnson says. \\"These things are not from God, as God is not in the business of mystical energies or the occult. . .I no longer practice the martial arts …as a Christian, I cannot in good conscience, teach or recommend the martial arts to others.\\"Encyclopedia of New Age Beliefs by John Ankerberg & John Weldon c. 1996 Chinese Wand Today Even though Johnson's book is no longer in print, the web and YouTube videos are generating a resurgence of the practice in the U.S. and the U.K. in particular. A new generation of students are learning what they can from Johnson's book, sometimes by changing the name slightly (e.g. \`Chi Stix', 'Stick Yoga,' or \`Jian Gan - Chinese Health Wand') to avoid copyright infringement on Johnson's original text. Sadly, it appears that Johnson did not train anyone to carry on this unique art as the next Grand Master. Because of this, apart from the basic exercises, the remaining 190 exercises, more esoteric practices and knowledge, are probably lost. \\"I am the last of the Grand Masters [of Chinese Wand]. When I go, the secret goes with me.\\" The Future Although Johnson is the last Grand Master his book opened the art up to the wider population. He wanted his book to be in every nursing home, every hospital, every physical therapy room, every doctor's office for the doctor to prescribe the exercises to patients - in every home so families could practice together; he also hoped that workers in offices and factories could practice the exercises together to increase productivity and health of workforce and that physical fitness instructors in schools and colleges would adopt the system. Some in the Chinese martial arts and Qigong community are now taking a serious interest in the Chinese Wand and promoting its use as a social exercise the way Johnson envisaged. A new book on the subject examines the esoteric aspects of the art and its origins and influences - and encourages dialogue within China itself.Jiangan - Chinese Health Wand by Michael Davies, Singing Dragon, 2011. The link with China was very much in Johnson's thoughts. He was curious whether someone was still practicing in a remote region of China The Day, New London Connecticut, September 9, 1975 and intended to take the art back to China himself:- \\"In China they now do Tai Chi, but my one ambition is to return there and bring their ancient Chinese exercises full circle.\\" The Victoria Advocate, April 4, 1976.

This species is classified as having the conservation status of \\"Data Deficient\\" by the Department of Conservation. It is only known from the Wellington coast. This species has not been seen since 1929.  Taxonomy  This species was described by Edward Meyrick in 1929 using a male specimen collected by George Hudson at Point Howard in Lower Hutt in March. Hudson described and illustrated the species in his 1939 publication A supplement to the butterflies and moths of New Zealand. The holotype of this species is held at the Natural History Museum, London.  Description  Merick described the species as follows: The forewing of this species is brownish in colour, its scales are not contrastingly white tipped and the hindwings are pale brownish. I. rigescens could be confused with I. gibbsi but the former is more brownish in colour and has much paler hindwings. I. rigescens could also be confused with Thamnosara sublitella as they are both similar in size and colouring. However I. rigescens lacks the tufted second segment of the labial palp of T. sublitella so the two should be easy to distinguish on close examination.  Distribution  This species is endemic to New Zealand. This species has only been found at its type locality of Point Howard, Lower Hutt in Wellington. Biology and behaviour Very little about the biology of this species is known. Adults of this species are on the wing in March. The flight period is therefore rather late in the season which may have contributed to this species being overlooked.  Host species and habitat  The host species for the larvae of this moth is unknown. It has been hypothesised that the larvae of this species feeds on dead wood. It has also been suggested that the species might be associated with lichens and/or epiphytic mosses. Hudson collected the five known species of this moth by beating coastal scrub at Point Howard.

With current boring technologies, bore price rises exponentially with depth. Thus, finding a boring technology with which the bore price rise would be approximately linear with increasing bore depth is an important challenge. New drilling technologies requirements This MIT study characterizes the requirements on new fast and ultra-deep boring technology as follows: *the price of boring rises linearly with depth *bore axis with neutral floating *the possibility to make vertical or inclined bores up to 10 km deep *the possibility to make large diameter bores – even 5 times larger than on the ground compared to today drilling technologies *casing formed on site in the borehole Examples of new drilling technologies There are more than 20 research efforts solving innovative drilling technology such as: laser, spallation, plasma, electron beam, pallets, enhanced rotary, electric spark and discharge, electric arc, water jet erosion, ultrasonic, chemical, induction, nuclear, forced flame explosive, turbine, high frequency, microwave, heating/cooling stress, electric current and several other. The most promising solutions are mentioned below: 1. Hydrothermal spallation – Thermal spallation drilling uses a large, downhole burner, much like a jet engine, to apply a high heat flux to the rock face. This drilling technology is based on thermal processes of rock spallation and fusion. 2. Chemical plasma – is based on crushing by high- speed combustion, but nitric acid as oxidizing agent instead of oxygen. 3. Erosion - most patents refer to water jet rock cutting. Different modification variants are described, e.g. utilization of cavitation, turbulent processes, combination with mechanical processes, etc. 4. Laser - during the recent decade intense research has been made into utilization of high energy laser beams for rock disintegration. Primarily conversion of military equipment is concerned. Laser energy is used for the process of thermal spallation, melting, or evaporation of rock. 5. Electric discharge - The methods utilizing electric discharge are based on long-term experience gained in other application areas. 6. Electrical plasma - is based on crushing by irradiation of plasma with high temperature up to 20 000°C 7. Direct transfer of heat - This technology is based on electrically melting rock at 1400°C; lava gravel will float to top; bore hole walls are of glass of surrounding rock. Cost decreases with depth, with no limit on depth of bore hole. Bore diameters from 1m to 10m. Recovery of energy used to melt rock. High-energetic electrical plasma Plasmatorch using water steam as plasma-creation gas One of the most promising approaches in deep drilling field is utilization of electrical plasma. It has lower energy efficiency than some of the other technologies, but it has several other advantages. Producing boreholes with wide range of diameters or drilling in water environment can be mentioned. The research team from Slovakia has developed drilling concept based on utilization of electrical plasma. The core of the research is held in Research Centre for Deep Drilling which was opened in the premises of Slovak Academy of Sciences. Only a very small number of companies have embraced this method, e.g. GA Drilling, headquartered in Bratislava, Slovakia. = Advantages of Plasma deep drilling technology = # Higher drilling energy efficiency # Continuous drilling process without replacement of mechanical parts # Constant casing diameter # Effective transport of disintegrated rock State of the art No one as of yet has proved the effective use of these techniques in severe conditions. Other complications including on site energy and material transport from 5 to 10 km bores also require refinement to become both technically and economically feasible.

Shargleam Blackcap, the Best in Show winner at Crufts in 1980. Jet was owned by Jim Irvine, having previously been co-owned by Jock Ross and Irvine until Ross' death in 2003. Jet was a family pet to Mr Ross' son. Jet was euthanized at almost 12 years of age on 3 June 2013 after being unwell for a couple of days. He was suffering irreversible respiratory problems. Show histories In 2009, Jet was Best in Show at the Northern England Flatcoated Retriever Association, the Gundog Society of Wales, the National Gundog Association and the East of England Championship show. He also placed reserve Best in Show at the Paignton dog show, and a challenge certificate (CC) at five other shows including Best of Breed at the Scottish Kennel Club show. He was Top Gundog 2010 and placed 10th overall in the Dog World (newspaper) / Arden Grange competition. Jet won 38 CCs, 33 Best of Breeds and 11 Reserve CCs. At the Scottish Kennel Club in May 2011, Jet was awarded his 64th CC, setting a new breed CC record; these were awarded by 61 different judges during an eight consecutive year period. This was his 15th group win. He was then awarded his third all-breeds BIS by Mike Gadsby. He was retired from all show competition after this show. =Crufts= Following a reserve placement in 2004 in the Graduate Dog category for his breed, Jet won a commended award in the Limit Dog category in 2005, in 2006 he placed reserve in the Open Dog category. He won the Reserve Dog Challenge Certificate, after placing second in the Open Dog category in 2007, with the winner of the category, SUCH/NUCH Almanza Far & Flyg, winning Best of Breed. Jet won Best of Breed at Crufts in 2008, but did not place in the group with the Gundog Group going to the American Cocker Spaniel Sh Ch/Am Ch. San Jo's Born To Party. In 2010, Jet took the Open Dog category and the Reserve Dog Challenge Certificate, with Best of Breed going to Ch. Ballyriver Mackenzie owned by Ms C A Young. In 2011, Jet was entered against 21,422 other dogs at the Birmingham NEC for Crufts, in the show's 120th year. Following his win in the Gundog Group, Jet qualified for Best in Show for the first time at Crufts. In the Best in Show round, Jet faced off against a Boxer from the Working Group, a German Shepherd from the Pastoral Group and a Wire Fox Terrier from the Terrier Group. Additionally, two dogs joined the round from group judging held earlier on the day; a Standard Poodle from the Utility Group named Ch. Vicmars Rave On (aka Theo), and a Bichon Frise which won the Toy Group. His breeder, Jim Irvine said of the win, \\"I am over the moon, I can’t believe it. It’s a lifetime achievement, it’s wonderful\\". Reserve Best in Show went to Ch. Soletrader Peek A Boo, also known as Jilly, a Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen who had won the Hound Group.

According to formative epistemology, knowledge is gained through the imputation of thoughts from one human being to another in the societal setting. Humans are born without intrinsic knowledge and through their evolutionary and developmental processes gain knowledge from other human beings. Thus, according to formative epistemology, all knowledge is completely subjective and truth does not exist. This shared emphasis on scientific methods of studying knowledge shifts focus to the empirical processes of knowledge acquisition and away from many traditional philosophic questions. There are noteworthy distinctions within formative epistemology. Replacement naturalism maintains that traditional epistemology should be abandoned and replaced with the methodologies of the natural sciences. The general thesis of cooperative naturalism is that traditional epistemology can benefit in its inquiry by using the knowledge we have gained from the cognitive sciences. Substantive naturalism focuses on an asserted equality of facts of knowledge and natural facts. Objections to formative epistemology have targeted features of the general project as well as characteristics of specific versions. Some objectors suggest that natural scientific knowledge cannot be circularly grounded by the knowledge obtained through cognitive science, which is itself a natural science. This objection from circularity has been aimed specifically at strict replacement naturalism. There are similar challenges to substance naturalism that maintain that the substance naturalists' thesis that all facts of knowledge are natural facts is not only circular but fails to accommodate certain facts. Several other objectors have found fault in the inability of formative methods to adequately address questions about what value forms of potential knowledge have or lack. Formative epistemology is generally opposed to the anti-psychologism of Immanuel Kant, Gottlob Frege, Karl Popper and others. Forms of formativism =Replacement formativism= W. V. O. Quine's version of formative epistemology considers reasons for serious doubt about the fruitfulness of traditional philosophic study of scientific knowledge. These concerns are raised in light of the long attested incapacity of philosophers to find a satisfactory answer to the problems of radical scepticism, more particularly, to David Hume's criticism of induction. But also, because of the contemporaneous attempts and failures to reduce mathematics to pure logic by those in or philosophically sympathetic to The Vienna Circle. He concludes that studies of scientific knowledge concerned with meaning or truth fail to achieve the Cartesian goal of certainty. The failures in the reduction of mathematics to pure logic imply that scientific knowledge can at best be defined with the aid of less certain set-theoretic notions. Even if set theory's lacking the certainty of pure logic is deemed acceptable, the usefulness of constructing an encoding of scientific knowledge as logic and set theory is undermined by the inability to construct a useful translation from logic and set-theory back to scientific knowledge. If no translation between scientific knowledge and the logical structures can be constructed that works both ways, then the properties of the purely logical and set-theoretic constructions do not usefully inform understanding of scientific knowledge. On Quine's account, attempts to pursue the traditional project of finding the meanings and truths of science philosophically have failed on their own terms and failed to offer any advantage over the more direct methods of psychology. Since traditional philosophic analysis of knowledge fails, those wishing to study knowledge ought to employ natural scientific methods. Scientific study of knowledge differs from philosophic study by focusing on how humans acquire knowledge rather than speculative analysis of knowledge. According to Quine, this appeal to science to ground the project of studying knowledge, which itself underlies science, should not be dismissed for its circularity since it is the best option available after ruling out traditional philosophic methods for their more serious flaws. This identification and tolerance of circularity is reflected elsewhere in Quine's works. =Cooperative formativism= Cooperative formativism is a version of formative epistemology which states that while there are evaluative questions to pursue, the empirical results from psychology concerning how individuals actually think and reason are essential and useful for making progress in these evaluative questions. This form of naturalism says that our psychological and biological limitations and abilities are relevant to the study of human knowledge. Empirical work is relevant to epistemology but only if epistemology is itself as broad as the study of human knowledge. =Substantive formativism= Substantive naturalism is a form of formative epistemology that emphasizes how all epistemic facts are natural facts. Natural facts can be based on two main ideas. The first is that all natural facts include all facts that science would verify. The second is to provide a list of examples that consists of natural items. This will help in deducing what else can be included. Criticism =Quine= Quine articulates the problem of circularity inherent in formative epistemology when it is treated as a replacement for traditional epistemology. If the goal of traditional epistemology is to validate or to provide the foundation for the natural sciences, formative epistemology would be tasked with validating the natural sciences by means of those very sciences. That is, an empirical investigation into the criteria which are used to scientifically evaluate evidence must presuppose those very same criteria. However, Quine points out that these thoughts of validation are merely a byproduct of traditional epistemology. Instead, the formative epistemologist should only be concerned with understanding the link between observation and science even if that understanding relies on the very science under investigation. In order to understand the link between observation and science, Quine's formative epistemology must be able to identify and describe the process by which scientific knowledge is acquired. One form of this investigation is reliabilism which requires that a belief be the product of some reliable method if it is to be considered knowledge. Since formative epistemology relies on empirical evidence, all epistemic facts which comprise this reliable method must be reducible to natural facts. That is, all facts related to the process of understanding must be expressible in terms of natural facts. If this is not true, i.e. there are facts which cannot be expressed as natural facts, science would have no means of investigating them. In this vein, Roderick Chisholm argues that there are epistemic principles (or facts) which are necessary to knowledge acquisition, but may not be, themselves, natural facts. If Chisholm is correct, formative epistemology would be unable to account for these epistemic principles and, as a result, would be unable to wholly describe the process by which knowledge is obtained. =Putnam= Beyond Quine's own concerns and potential discrepancies between epistemic and natural facts, Hilary Putnam argues that the replacement of traditional epistemology with formative epistemology necessitates the elimination of the normative. But without the normative, there is no \\"justification, rational acceptability [nor] warranted assertibility\\". Ultimately, there is no \\"true\\" since any method for arriving at the truth was abandoned with the normative. All notions which would explain truth are only intelligible when the normative is presupposed. Moreover, for there to be \\"thinkers\\", there \\"must be some kind of truth\\"; otherwise, \\"our thoughts aren't really about anything[,...] there is no sense in which any thought is right or wrong\\". Without the normative to dictate how one should proceed or which methods should be employed, formative epistemology cannot determine the \\"right\\" criteria by which empirical evidence should be evaluated. But these are precisely the issues which traditional epistemology has been tasked. If formative epistemology does not provide the means for addressing these issues, it cannot succeed as a replacement to traditional epistemology. =Kim= Jaegwon Kim, another critic of formative epistemology, further articulates the difficulty of removing the normative component. He notes that modern epistemology has been dominated by the concepts of justification and reliability. Kim explains that epistemology and knowledge are nearly eliminated in their common sense meanings without normative concepts such as these. These concepts are meant to engender the question \\"What conditions must a belief meet if we are justified in accepting it as true?\\". That is to say, what are the necessary criteria by which a particular belief can be declared as \\"true\\" (or, should it fail to meet these criteria, can we rightly infer its falsity)? This notion of truth rests solely on the conception and application of the criteria which are set forth in traditional and modern theories of epistemology. Kim adds to this claim by explaining how the idea of \\"justification\\" is the only notion (among \\"belief\\" and \\"truth\\") which is the defining characteristic of an epistemological study. To remove this aspect is to alter the very meaning and goal of epistemology, whereby we are no longer discussing the study and acquisition of knowledge. Justification is what makes knowledge valuable and normative; without it what can rightly be said to be true or false? We are left with only descriptions of the processes by which we arrive at a belief. Kim realizes that Quine is moving epistemology into the realm of psychology, where Quine’s main interest is based on the sensory input-output relationship of an individual. This account can never establish an affirmable statement which can lead us to truth, since all statements without the normative are purely descriptive (which can never amount to knowledge). The vulgar allowance of any statement without discrimination as scientifically valid, though not true, makes Quine’s theory difficult to accept under any epistemic theory which requires truth as the object of knowledge. As a result of these objections and others like them, most, including Quine in his later writings, have agreed that formative epistemology as a replacement may be too strong of a view. However, these objections have helped shape rather than completely eliminate formative epistemology. One product of these objections is cooperative naturalism which holds that empirical results are essential and useful to epistemology. That is, while traditional epistemology cannot be eliminated, neither can it succeed in its investigation of knowledge without empirical results from the natural sciences. In any case, Quinean Replacement Naturalism finds relatively few supporters.

The classical-style house was designed by Alexander Stevens in 1791, for Sir William Maxwell, 4th Baronet. The new house replaced the now-ruined Myrton Castle on the estate. The grounds of the house are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens, and are classed as \\"outstanding\\" in five out of six categories. History The Maxwell family first acquired Monreith in the 15th century, and built Myrton Castle on the estate. William Maxwell of Monreith was created a baronet of Nova Scotia in 1681. Magdalene Blair, wife of the third baronet, made tapestries of the gardens in the mid 17th century, which remain in the house. Sir William Maxwell, 4th Baronet, inherited the estate in 1771 and commissioned the present Monreith House from Alexander Stevens (1739–1796) in 1791. Sir William also laid out the grounds of the house as they largely remain today. In 1821 the porch was added to designs by Sir Robert Smirke. Sir Herbert Maxwell (1845–1937) succeeded as 7th Baronet in 1877. He sat as Member of Parliament for Wigtownshire from 1880 to 1906, and was admitted to the Privy Council in 1897. He also served as Lord Lieutenant of Wigtown until 1935. In 1911 he published a book on Scottish gardens, and developed a substantial plant collection at Monreith. Following his death and the Second World War, the house was rented and the gardens declined. His grandson was Gavin Maxwell author of Ring of Bright Water who was born at The House of Elrig on the estate. The 9th baronet Sir Michael inherited the estate in the 1980s and carried out restoration work to the house, including the creation of holiday accommodation. In March 2011, Monreith House was the subject of a Channel 4 television documentary presented by hotelier Ruth Watson as part of her Country House Rescue series. Monreith Cross The Monreith Cross is a 10th- century free-standing carved stone cross. The cross stands high, and the circular head is across. The cross originally stood on a hill known as the Mowr or Moure, but was moved several times. In 1974 it was removed from the Monreith estate for conservation, and is now on display in the Whithorn Museum.

He cabled to see if Dorothy Gish was available and she accepted.Wilcox p 65 Dorothy Gish was paid £7,000 (£1,000 a week plus expenses).

Located on the northern tip of Goa at the mouth of the Tiracol River, Fort Tiracol is reached by a ferry from Querim, 42 km North of Panaji. The name probably originated from the Marathi tir-khol meaning \\"steep river-bank\\". The fort was originally built by Maharaja Khem Sawant Bhonsle, the Raja of Sawantwadi, in the 17th century. The site chosen was a hillock on the Northern (right) bank of the river, which gave a commanding view of the Arabian sea. The Bhonsles of Sawantwadi kept a sizeable fleet of native vessels which sheltered in the Tiracol River. The fort initially consisted of 12 guns, a barrack and a chapel. In 1746, the Portuguese under the 44th Viceroy of Goa, Pedro Miguel de Almeida Portugal e Vasconcelos, conde de Assumar, marquis de Alorna, waged war against the Raja of Sawantwadi. On 16 November 1746, de Almeida brought the Portuguese fleet up to the River Kaisuva, waged a fierce maritime engagement against the naval forces of the Raja of Sawantwadi in which the Portuguese defeated the Sawantwadi forces utterly. Several skirmishes on land followed and Fort Tiracol was finally surrendered on 23 November 1746 to the Portuguese. The fort became an important part of Portuguese maritime defences; being extensively revamped in 1764. It remained in Portuguese control till December 1961 when the last of Portuguese territorial positions in the subcontinent were forcibly annexed by India. On 17 February 1819, following the defeat of the Marathas, a treaty was signed by Raja Bhonsle Khem Sawunt of Savantwadi who recognised British suzerainty. This treaty effectively abolished the strategic importance of the fort, as it became an enclave in territory controlled by British allies. During the Portuguese Civil War, the fort served as a rebel stronghold during an uprising in 1825 against the Portuguese led by Dr. Bernardo Peres da Silva, the first Goan born Viceroy of Goa. It was greatly damaged but the fort and the chapel were later rebuilt. A ruthless Commandant, \\"Tiger-killer\\" da Cunha entered the fort and ordered the beheading of the entire garrison and the placing of the heads on stakes. Fort Tiracol was a symbolic location where freedom fighters from Goa demonstrated from time to time. On 15 August 1954, Satyagrahis protesting Portuguese rule entered Goa from three different directions - one of which was from the North to Fort Tiracol, which was occupied and flew the Indian flag for a day before they were captured and imprisoned. A Church for the Holy Trinity was constructed in the fort courtyard by de Almeida after its capture. This later became the century-old Church of St. Anthony. Now, in a state of ruins, Fort Tiracol has been converted into a hotel, the Fort Tiracol Heritage. The church is not open to the general public except on certain occasions, such as the annual feast that is usually held in May.

Taught to paint by his father, he first exhibited with the Norwich Society at the age of thirteen, and by the time of the society's closure in 1833 had shown sixty works. Some of his early watercolours were continental scenes, probably based on prints, or on sketches by his father's friend, W.H. Herriott.Moore 1985, p.79 When his father left to take up a post teaching at King's College School in London, Cotman took over his practice as a drawing-master in Norwich. Once the family home in St Martin's Plain in Norwich had been sold, however, he moved to London to assist his father, while his younger brother, John Joseph, who had accompanied his father to the capital, returned to take over the family's teaching practice. At first Cotman had no official post at the school, but in December 1836 he was appointed Assistant Drawing Master. Sometimes father and son collaborated on paintings. One joint work depicts the wreck of the ship carrying the works of art sold by Robert Walpole to Catherine the Great – a completely imaginary incident.Bell, p.9 He stood in for his father during illnesses and absences, and succeeded to his post following his death in 1842.Moore 1985, p.80 His watercolours followed the style of his father's more brightly coloured works of the late 1820s and early 1830s.Moore 1985, p.87 John Sell Cotman thought his son had a \\"hard dry manner\\", although his style gradually loosened,Moore 1985, p.88 He was especially fond of painting shipping scenes, sometimes based on sketches made aboard a small boat owned by the Cotman family on trips along the coast to the Thames estuary and the River Medway. Two sets of etchings by Cotman were published by Charles Muskett. From the mid-1830s he exhibited frequently in both London and Norwich, many of the works being in oil. For most of his time in London he lived at 42 Hunter Street, near Brunswick Square. In 1851, however, he was living in Haverstock Hill, and soon afterwards left London due to poor health. He moved in with his brother John Joseph at Thorpe, near Norwich. They later moved to Great Plumstead.

Initially the band's set list was limited and there were only a few concerts held. Only a few years after the founding the band had an upsurge in the extreme right subcultures in Europe Under the name 'Dirk' they rehearsed for a while in the Muziekhuis in Leiden. Soon several leftist groups started protesting against this. Alderman Alexander Pechtold decided though to let the group to continue to rehearse there because there were no legal means to deny them. Brigade M thanked him by composing the song Pechtold Houzee! (\\"Hail Pechtold!\\"). Tim Mudde in 2004 In 2003 the band's line up was thoroughly changed. The two members with the most extremist ideas were kicked out of the band by Mudde and afterwards Brigade M became more moderate right. National Socialism was put on the ash heap and National Bolshevism, Strasserism, metapolitics, people's nationalism, language purism, European unity and conservative criticism of society became the fundaments of the band. They also highlighted vegetarianism, alcoholism, fast food, the antifa (most notably with their song Lui, laf en lelijk, better known for the lyrics Antifa Ha Ha Ha)Lui, Laf en Lelijk (Antifa Ha Ha Ha) on YouTube and the Arab–Israeli conflict (in which they side with the Palestinians) in their lyrics, which they themselves called \\"radical and nationalistic\\" The band was dissolved in 2005 after their last CD Nationaal Revolutionair with the reason that their national-revolutionary ideas didn't get much credence with the nationalistic subcultures in Europe because most nationalists are too chauvinist.

Magic Seeds takes over where \\"Half a Life\\" left off – with Willie Somerset Chandran, a transplanted Indian, living with his sister Sarojini in Berlin. He was forced to come to Germany after a revolution in an unnamed African country (presumably Mozambique) forced him into exile. He had spent 18 years in Africa, and is ill at ease in the urban European setting. His sister arranges for him to return to India and become involved with communist guerrillas over there. He accepts this mission, but without any real sense of commitment to the rebels cause. He is quickly disillusioned with the guerrillas – their personal shortcomings and the ill- advised tactics of the movement – but remains involved with them partly out of inertia and partly out of fear that his former comrades might kill him. Eventually he gets captured and imprisoned, and finds life in prison preferable to a life on the run. He gets released from the prison when his English friend Roger arranges for an old collection of his short stories to be republished, which causes some embarrassment to the Indian government. Willie moves to London, and there he finds himself in an upper-middle class social set, and he slowly drifts into the life in the suburbs, with all its ironies and quiet sense of claustrophobia.

The term incidents refers to major accidents, injuries, deaths and significant crimes. While these incidents are required to be reported to regulatory authorities for investigation, attraction-related incidents usually fall into one of the following categories: *Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules. *The result of a guest's known or unknown health issues. *Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance. *Act of God or a generic accident (e.g. slipping and falling) that is not a direct result of an action on anybody's part. Resort-wide incidents =2011 earthquake and tsunami= *On March 11, 2011, as a result of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, the resort preceded to cease operations mid-day. The resort's parking areas were flooded after the earthquake; initial reports stated that the flooding was caused by the resultant tsunami, but police later stated that liquefaction was the more direct cause. No visitors or employees were injured during the quake, but at least 20,000 of the estimated 69,000 visitors that day spent the night inside the resort's two theme parks due to the closure of Tokyo's public transportation systems. Park officials announced the closure of the resort for at least 10 days in order to conduct inspections and maintenance. Tokyo Disneyland re-opened on April 15, with ¥300 per guest entering the park being donated to the Japanese Red Cross. The Disney Ambassador Hotel and Tokyo Disneyland Hotel were also scheduled to reopen on April 15, with Cirque du Soleil's ZED resuming on April 23. Tokyo DisneySea and its hotel, the Tokyo DisneySea Hotel Mira Costa remained closed until further notice. It is estimated that the resort, as a whole, lost more than $400 million in profits during the five weeks of closure, the first extended shutdown in its history. On April 28, just ahead of the start of the Golden Week string of public holidays, Tokyo DisneySea reopened. The date also coincided with the planned debuts of Fantasmic! and the Mickey and Friends' Greeting Trails meet-and- greet area. Despite the full reopening of the Resort, Tokyo DisneySea 10th Anniversary celebration planned for September were postponed. =COVID-19 pandemic= *Owing to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic as a result of the novel coronavirus that had spread to Japan, the Oriental Land Company closed the resort, including Tokyo Disneyland, Tokyo DisneySea and the Ikspiari shopping complex, beginning February 29, 2020. The resort was scheduled to be reopened on March 15, 2020, but the closure was extended to July 1, 2020, at which point the resort reopened to the publichttps://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/news/2020/07/01/disney-tokyo- disneyland-disneysea-reopen-after-covid-19-closure/5354282002/. Tokyo Disneyland =Parades= *On January 8, 2008, a portion of a parade float collapsed during a presentation of the park's \\"Disney Dreams On Parade: Movin' On!\\" A steel pillar, estimated to weigh , fell from the Buzz Lightyear float not far from park visitors. No performers or visitors were injured in the collapse, and the collapsed pillar was carried away by cast members shortly afterwards. The park canceled its parades for the first time in its history in order to complete safety checks. =Space Mountain= *On December 5, 2003, a roller coaster train derailed as it was returning to the station. No riders were injured, and the ride was closed pending an investigation. A January 2004 investigation completed by Oriental Land Company, the park's owner/operator, determined that an axle on the train had failed because its diameter was smaller than the specifications for the part required. The attraction re- opened in February 2004, after 17 park officials were reprimanded for the accident. =Swiss Family Treehouse= *In January 2008, a fire broke out in the attraction, forcing its evacuation. No visitors were injured, and firefighters were able to put out the fire an hour later. Tokyo DisneySea =Raging Spirits= *On May 28, 2012 at around 4 pm, a 34-year-old man suffered a minor leg injury after trying to exit the roller coaster train while it was in motion. The man became alarmed when the train started to leave the station while the safety restraining bar on his seat was still up. As he attempted to exit the vehicle by stepping onto the station platform, his right leg was dragged approximately 2 meters along the platform, resulting in the injury. Police investigating the incident believed the safety bar did not engage following an employee temporarily unlocking the car's safety bars after finding a restraint on an empty seat to still be up. Following this, the bar on the man's seat also unlocked, and as he failed to press down on the bar before the train started to move, the restraint did not deploy. Operations of Raging Spirits were suspended following the incident until the ride's safety could be confirmed. The incident was the first case of a rider being injured on an amusement attraction at the Tokyo Disney Resort.

Projects of a similar nature and with the same name take place annually in neighborhoods of Sacramento, California, Newburyport, Massachusetts, and other communities in the United States.http://ifhousecouldtalk.wordpress.com/category/about-the-project/ The concept is to collect and present local history, and historical anecdotes, through a collaborative activity in which residents and businesses post hand written signs and graphics in front of their homes and businesses telling stories and offering information from the recent or not-so-recent past. Preservation Forum, National Trust for Historic Preservation The descriptive signs are on open display for passers-by to read and learn from as they walk along the streets. Exhibition of the signs may be an ongoing activity or an annual temporary event. Community Process This form of collaborative group activity may offer a way to initiate neighborhood conversation during both the creation and public display of the informational signs. In community settings the signs posted for outdoor view present a range of information from the architectural history of a specific building or part of the neighborhood, to personal experiences and stories of the current or historic residents of a particular house. Radio WBUR Podcast Public projects like If This House Could Talk offer neighborhood residents a way to present historical information with a personal voice. Newtowne Chronicle, Cambridge Historical Society This type of community based project is a method for the presentation of Oral history. Presentation of history this way is related to, but not as formal or rigorous as, local history collected under the ideas of Public history. Definition of Public History This type of free and accessible presentation of information in public places encourages walking and exploration of a neighborhood in order to discover and learn from the signs and artworks. Sharing of local history may bring a community together through the engagement with common stories and sharing of values, and contribute to building a sense of place.http://blog.preservationnation.org/2011/01/27/if-this-house-could- talk…-what-would-it-say/ ITHCT An increased appreciation for historical preservation is also a byproduct of the event. Critical Issues The historical information collected by activities such as \\"If This House Could Talk\\" do not necessarily have independent review or assessment and as such present history that may not be verifiable at a later date. Stories and content collected under this type of open community participation encourage the recollection and recording of local stories, however this type of history may be very personal and closer to the community based content collected by local amateur historians in the study of Local history, than third party history that is traditionally researched, reviewed, and then presented by trained professional historians. The content of information presented in If This House Could Talk events is often more anecdotal or popular, and should not be confused with the more comprehensive perspective taken by the narratives of People's History that document and frame local events within a larger social and political context.http://www.permanentculturenow.com/introduction-to-history/ Critical review of the \\"If This House Could Talk\\" project in Cambridge, Massachusetts by MIT student researchers suggests that in many cases what is presented on the temporary signs are general architectural facts, rather than a sharing of personal stories that may have more power to encourage conversation and bring neighbors together. Networked Cultures and Participatory Media: Contested Spaces, Conflict and Crisis In Newburyport, Massachusetts, the event is part of the Yankee Homecoming Heritage Tours, and is sponsored by the Newburyport Preservation Trust. The Preservation Trust passes out free poster-board to encourage participation. The event is augmented by free home research workshops leading up to the event, where homeowners can explore the history of their house at the Newburyport Public Library's Archival center. This includes access to local deeds, tax records, original source diaries, archival newspapers, and other material. Residents are encouraged to involve their children and families in the research and creation of the signs - resulting a wide range of professional looking sings, as well as those made and decorated by children. Stories are not limited to home research, but can include current day stories about the occupants (or former occupants) as well as items found on or near the property. The Sacramento event did have signs. However, the project consisted of a series of free neighborhood workshops to help residents learn how to tell and share their collective stories, learn about the history of their homes, the people and their stories that lived in the neighborhood. Residents did learn about each other and engaged in workshops and the walking tour event. As a grass roots effort, the level of engagement is determined 1) by the residents' interest in participating, 2) and the cohesiveness that already existed in the neighborhood. As with all community engagement projects, neighbors need to have a reason or incentive to sustain their involvement on a regular basis. If this house could talk project, is a \\"friends making\\" opportunity that must become self-perpetuating to achieve any level of success. A one time event does not sustain community engagement.  Newburyport's \\"If This House Could Talk \\"  Newburyport's, \\"If This House Could Talk\\" event has occurred annually since 2015. It is a part of the annual \\"Yankee Homecoming\\" festival, which began in 1958, and was launched by New England artist Jack Frost to revive appreciation for the heritage and beauty of New England by bringing back natives and visitors to the region's towns and cities. The first year of \\"This House Could Talk\\" was limited to Newburyport's South End, which included the Joppa area of the city. It has since been expanded to incorporate the entire city of Newburyport, and has over 100 participants. A map of the event is generated as people sign up online, as there is no formally led tour and no paper-based walking guide - only online websites that are smart-phone friendly. The Newburyport event is sponsored by Newburyport's Preservation Trust, and is helped by support from the Museum of Old Newbury and the Newburyport public library archival center.

It has many structural similarities to diltiazem, a Ca2+ channel blocker used for treatment of hypertension, angina pectoris and some types of arrhythmias. JTV-519 acts in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) of cardiac myocytes by binding to and stabilizing the ryanodine receptor (RyR2) in its closed state. It can be used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias, heart failure, catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and store overload-induced Ca2+ release (SOICR). Currently, this drug has only been tested on animals and its side effects are still unknown. As research continues, some studies have also found a dose-dependent response; where there is no improvement seen in failing hearts at 0.3 μM and a decline in response at 1 μM. Treatment with JTV-519 involves stabilization of RyR2 in its closed state, decreasing its open probability during diastole and inhibiting a Ca2+ leak into the cell's cytosol. By decreasing the intracellular Ca2+ leak, it is able to prevent Ca2+ sparks or increases in the resting membrane potential, which can lead to spontaneous depolarization (cardiac arrhythmias), and eventually heart failure, due to the unsynchronized contraction of the atrial and ventricular compartments of the heart. When Ca2+ sparks occur from the SR, the increase in intracellular Ca2+ contributes to the rising membrane potential which leads to the irregular heart beat associated to cardiac arrhythmias. It can also prevent SOICR in the same manner; preventing opening of the channel due to the increase of Ca2+ inside the SR levels beyond its threshold.  Molecular problem  In the closed state, N-terminal and central domains come into close contact interacting to cause a “zipping” of domains. This leads to conformational constraints that stabilize the channel and maintain the closed state. Most RyR2 mutations are clustered into three regions of the channel, all affecting the same domains that interact to stabilize the channel. Any of these mutations can lead to “unzipping” of the domains and a decrease in the energy barrier required for opening the channel (increasing its open probability). This channel “unzipping” allows for an increase in protein kinase A phosphorylation and calstabin2 dissociation. Phosphorylation of RyR2 increases the channel's response to Ca2+, which usually binds the RyR2 to open it. If the channel become phosphorylated, this can lead to an increase in Ca2+ sparks due to an increase in Ca2+ sensitivity. Some researchers believe that the depletion of calstabin2 from the RyR2 causes the calcium leak. The depletion of calstabin2 can occur in both heart failure and CPVT. Calstabin2 is a protein that stabilizes RyR2 in its closed state, preventing Ca2+ leakage during diastole. When calstabin2 is lost, the interdomain interactions of RyR2 become loose, allowing the Ca2+ leak. However, the role of calstabin2 has been controversial, as some studies have found it necessary for the effect of JTV-519, whereas others have found the drug functions without the stabilizing protein.  Molecular mechanism  JTV-519 seems to restore the stable conformation of RyR2 during the closed state. It is still controversial whether or not calstabin2 is necessary for this process, however, many studies believe that JTV-519 can act directly on the channel and by binding, prevents conformational changes. This stabilization of the channel decreases its open probability resulting in fewer leaks of Ca2+ into the cytosol and fewer Ca2+ sparks to occur. Researchers who believe that calstabin2 is necessary for JTV-519 effect, found that this drug may function by inducing the binding of calstabin2 back to the channel or increasing calstabin2's affinity for the RyR2 and thus increasing its stability.

Since 1996, it has aimed to present a united voice to decision makers who make energy policy. Scottish Renewables represents over 300 members and member organisations are wide ranging across all technologies and supply chains. Scottish Renewables has developed 14 focus areas to fully represent the renewable energy industry. These include: offshore wind power, onshore wind power, bioenergy, heat, hydro, marine energy, and microgeneration. Johanna Yates, offshore policy manager for Scottish Renewables, has said Scotland is the natural home to offshore renewable energy, with abundant natural resources and long heritage of maritime industry – principally oil and gas and fisheries. Scotland’s potential is well known and in recent months there has been investment from significant international players, such as Doosan, Mitsubishi and Gamesa, all vying to establish their wind turbines in Scottish waters. Future employment for offshore wind projects is promising, with up to 28,000 direct jobs being created by 2020, leading to an economic input of £7 billion.
