Daniel Gal explained in his speech that the Holocaust survivors pleaded on behalf of the entire Krƒôpeƒá family with all its members and that Yad Vashem honored Jerzy and Irena first. Subsequently, their son, Tadeusz living in Montreal, and Jerzy‚Äôs two sisters, Eugenia Krƒôpeƒá‚ÄìMuszy≈Ñski and Alina (Halina) Krƒôpeƒá‚ÄìTyszka, were recognized as Righteous in May and November 2002, with more testimonies by their Jewish countrymen. The ceremony was written about in 12 newspaper articles in three languages. \\"My father never sought recognition or compensation for what he did,\\" said Andr√© Krepec ‚Äî the eldest son of Tadeusz Krepec ‚Äî who attended the forum together with his widowed mother Halina, three brothers, sister, and their families. \\"For him, it was just a question of human values‚Ä¶\\"  The rescuers and the rescued  Following the 1939 invasion of Poland, Jerzy Krƒôpeƒá (1896‚Äì1981) and Irena n√©e Adamus (1906‚Äì17.11.1999), Nekrologi warszawskie: Gazeta Wyborcza, Gazeta Sto≈Çeczna, ≈ªycie Warszawy, Trybuna, etc. were forced out by the Nazis from their estate near P≈Çock. They moved to Go≈ÇƒÖbki near Warsaw with their three children: Tadeusz (14), Krystyna (13) and Maria (9), and rented a farm called Osada not far from where Irena‚Äôs parents lived. Soon they began to take in Jews who escaped from Nazi persecution. Among them: Krystyna Izbicki, Anna Zofia and her son Jozef Ettinger, Krystyna Radziejewski and her foster-daughter Larissa Sztorchan, Czeslawa Konko (children's instructor), Zofia Sidor, her sisters, Eliza Temler and Dr. Tworkowski. More than 20 Jewish refugees joined in after the Warsaw Uprising. They all worked at the farm and in the fields to maintain food supplies and also, for their own cover. Children, both Christian and Jewish, attended classes at an underground school set up by the family. Jerzy Krƒôpeƒá rented a second farm nearby where he placed his two sisters: Alina Tyszka (with daughters, Marta and Stefa) and Eugenia Muszynski with her teenage daughter Olenka (14). Alina Tyszka was expelled from her estate near Bydgoszcz (which was incorporated into Nazi Germany). Her husband Feliks, a Polish officer, was executed by the Nazis with his two uncles. Alina escaped when threatened with arrest, because of her earlier assistance given to Jews at a forced labor camp in Bielin where she worked in 1941. Eugenia's husband was held as a Polish POW in Germany. The two sisters immediately began sheltering more Jews. They all worked together at the farm. Their older children, especially Tadeusz and Olenka helped. The Jews moved from one farm to the other in case of danger. Some received false identification cards thanks to Jerzy's underground contacts, which was good also for their morale. The entire Krepec family helped everybody in need with shelter, food, clothing and moral support. People in the village knew about the numerous Jewish families living at both farms, but nobody betrayed them and all refugees survived. Indeed, Jerzy Krepec had many silent partners, including neighbors well aware of the succession of farmhands speaking Polish with an accent. Undeterred by the associated risk, Tadeusz Krepec used to sneak out at night and steal guns and grenades from the German Panzer division stationed nearby, then bury them at the farm for the Polish Underground. After the war, the Krepec family kept in touch with the Jewish friends who had stayed with them during the occupation. They were receiving shipments of oranges from Israel; however, they would not accept the offer to help emigrate from their homeland. Their son, Tadeusz Krepec, who studied at the Warsaw Polytechnic eventually moved to Montreal in 1973 as an engineer.

Economic development The Alabama‚ÄìQuassarte Tribal Town operates a tribal housing program and a gaming center (Red Hawk Gaming) in Wetumka.

Both the river and the state are named after the Alabama.Moore, John H. \\"Alabama‚ÄìQuassarte Tribal Town\\", Oklahoma Historical Society's Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. (retrieved 31 Jan 09) The Quassarte are also known as the Coushatta or Koasati, in their own language. The two tribes shared many similarities in their language and culture, as they were both Muskogean-speaking.Official Website of the Alabama‚ÄìQuassarte Tribal Town. 2009. (retrieved 31 Jan 09) In the early 17th century, after a conflict with French settlers, the tribes formed an alliance. They intermarried freely and became active trading partners. In 1763, the two tribes joined the Muscogee Nation Confederacy (also called the Creek Confederacy). Before removal of the Muscogee Creek people from Alabama in the 1830s, the Muscogee Nation Confederacy included over 44 different tribal towns. The Alabama and Quassarte peoples made up six to eight of those towns. Facing increasing encroachment by European-American settlers, some of the Quassarte and Alabama peoples moved into Louisiana and Texas in the late 18th century and early 19th century. These emigrants and their descendants formed what are today the federally recognized Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana and the Alabama‚ÄìCoushatta Tribe of Texas. Those who stayed in Alabama joined forces and became a single town. The Indian Removal Act of 1830 forced the tribal town, along with the rest of the Muscogee, to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. They settled in what would become Hughes, McIntosh, Okfuskee, and Seminole counties. The Dawes Allotment Act of 1887 and the Curtis Act of 1898, intended to increase assimilation, provided for allotments of land to individual households from the communal reservation lands and sale of the \\"surplus\\"; in addition, it required the extinguishing of tribal governments and courts. The Bureau of Indian Affairs took an increased role on the reservations. The Alabama‚ÄìQuassarte Tribal Town maintained its cultural identity. It practiced traditional dances and beliefs at the Alabama Ceremonial Grounds near Wetumka. Other Native American peoples also survived culturally and preserved their religious practices. The town took the opportunity afforded by the federal Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 under the President Franklin D. Roosevelt administration and the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1936 to set up a government. It organized as a distinct, federally recognized tribe in April 1939. Due to its historic relationship with the Muscogee Creek Nation, which became federally recognized in 1972, tribal members can maintain dual citizenship in both tribes.

Background In the cases Engel v. Vitale (1962) and Abington School District v. Schempp (1963), the United States Supreme Court ruled that government mandated school prayer is unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. However voluntary prayer is not unconstitutional. The history of school prayer amendment began in 1962 with the Supreme Court case of Engel v. Vitale. A New York policy required schools to begin each day with a word of prayer. Regarding this case, Justice Hugo Black wrote \\"‚Ä¶ the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that in this country it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.\\" The next year, a similar case arose: Abington Township School District v. Schempp. The effect of this incident was the prohibition of school officials from organizing or leading prayers as well as devotional Bible reading in public schools. Abington v. Schempp required that school faculties should neither promote nor degrade religion. The Supreme Court next examined school prayer in 1985 with the case of Wallace v. Jaffree. A change to Alabama's moment-of-silence law included a requirement that the moment of silence must be for \\"meditation or voluntary prayer.\\" The Court saw the change as government promotion of prayer in the schools, and overturned the change to the law. The justices explained that a moment of silence is appropriate, but not for any religious purpose. Text= H. J. RES. 16 =History Democratic Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia proposed the amendment in 1962, 1973, 1979, 1982, 1993, 1995, and 1997. The New York Times reported in July 1999 that the House of Representatives, at that time occupied by a Republican majority, had long been proposing such an amendment but was preoccupied with a competing, more general amendment allowing for \\"religious freedoms\\" proposed by Henry Hyde, then- Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. Representative Ernest Istook, a Republican from Oklahoma's 5th congressional district, proposed the amendment on May 8, 1997. In March 1998, the Judiciary Committee passed the bill by a 16-11 vote. On June 4, 1998, the full House voted on the amendment, 224-203 in favor. The vote was 61 short of the two-thirds majority required by Article Five of the United States Constitution to propose a constitutional amendment. Istook reintroduced the amendment to Congress twice: first in 1999 as the House Joint Resolution 66http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/z?c106:H.J.RES.66.IH: and in 2001 as the \\"Religious Speech Amendment\\". Byrd proposed the amendment again on April 29, 2006. Though the proposed amendment failed to be adopted, it led to the passing of the Equal Access Act. Rick Perry, governor of Texas and Republican a former candidate for the 2012 presidential election, said in an interview on Fox News Sunday on December 11, 2011: \\"I would support a constitutional amendment that allows our children to pray in school anytime they would like.\\" Reception The Freedom From Religion Foundation, American Civil Liberties Union, and Americans United for Separation of Church and State have all expressed opposition to this amendment.

It is celebrated annually on a Tuesday in the month of Mangsir (the eighth month of the Nepalese calendar), after the Marghashirsha (the first month of winter) Sukla Pratipada with a black she- goat (if possible). It may also be observed individually throughout the year on Ujjali (Tuesday) of any month. Mandali Puja is observed to appeal for a cure from illness, relief of misfortune and success in foreign travel. Women who wish to become doctors believe that if they make an offering, 75% of them will be successful. The offering was originally a goat, but since 2025 BS (1968 AD) a pair of pigeons are also used. A comb, thread, ribbon, mirror and a sari are offered to the goddess. She is believed to be very powerful, so she is worshipped by people from different places. Mandali Bajai According to legend, Mandali Bajai (third granddaughter of the last Thakuri king of Dholarthan) was married in Waakhet in Pathlekhet VDC. Her third daughter was Mandali Bajai. Since childhood she was different and at age 17 or 18, she was beaten and scolded by the villagers. Despite pain and illness she came to Chimkhola, crossing the Raghuganga River in 1921 BS (1864 AD). Mallika Puja was taking place at Mulkarha, and Mandali Bajai became a pilgrim. After a long night of celebration, on her way back to Chimkhola she was struck by a cow named Guleni on the north side of Mandali Than (now known as Chulthepathi) and died of her injuries. Eight to ten years after the accident Mandali Bajai began to appear through spiritualists, convincing them to worship her at the present place. Her veneration began in 1930 BS (1873 AD). The shrine was originally near a large puwale bush, but in 1975 BS (1918 AD) Chambir Tilija, a devotee, built a fence around the area. In 2008 BS (1951 AD), however, a landslide from the Tamkhane Gahra destroyed the puwale bush and surrounding area. After the landslide the temple was moved to the north of the village, in Chamalabot. However, the witch doctors encouraged worship at the old site, near a milky tree. In accordance with their wishes, the villagers searched the area and found a dudelo tree (a tree in the region of Chimkhola which is used to feed domestic animals). Beginning in 2013 BS (1956 AD) worship began at the original site, which was again fenced in by Chambir Tilija. In 2021 BS (1964), G. K. Paha Bahadur Pun dedicated a temple; later, Karna Bahadur Tilija's sons Li Tam Bahaur Tilija, Som Bahadur Tilija, Moti Bahadur Tilija and Man Bahadur Tilija (who lived in the area) built another temple. In 2062 BS (2005), the original temple was renovated by G. K. Paha Bahadur Pun, Jaisara Pun (his oldest wife), Kali Maya Pun (his youngest wife), Indra Bahadur Pun (his oldest son), Ruk Maya Pun (his oldest daughter-in-law), Dek Bahadur Pun (his youngest son) and Bina Pun (his youngest daughter).

(2003). Fitzpatrick's Dermatology in General Medicine (6th ed.). McGraw-Hill. . \\"Acral\\" refers to the fact that the peeling of the skin is most noticeable on the hands and feet of this state. Peeling happens sometimes on the arms and legs, too. The peeling is typically apparent from birth, although it may start in childhood or later on in life as well. Skin peeling is caused by sun, humidity, moisture, and friction. The acral form can be associated with TGM5.  Syndromes  Peeling Skin syndrome is also associated with 6 syndromes that are each caused by a different genetic defect. The various syndromes include peeling skin syndrome 1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, and 6.  Peeling Skin Syndrome 1  Peeling Skin Syndrome 1 is caused by a genetic defect in the Corneodesmosin(CDSN) gene. This gene localizes to the human epidermis and other epithelia. The protein experiences a chain of cleavages during corneocyte maturation. Its symptoms include short stature, abnormality of metabolism/homeostasis, scaling skin, pruritus, erythema, asthma, brittle hair, and abnormality of hair texture.  Peeling Skin Syndrome 2  Peeling Skin Syndrome 2 is caused by a genetic defect in the TGM5 gene. Transglutaminase 5 is best for catalyzing the cross-linking of proteins and the conjugation of polyamines to proteins. It also adds to the development of the cornified cell envelope of keratinocytes. Its symptoms include excessive wrinkling of palmar skin, skin erosion, hyperpigmentation of the skin, ichthyosis, and allergy.  Peeling Skin Syndrome 3  Peeling Skin Syndrome 3 is caused by a genetic defect in the Carbohydrate sulfotransferase (CHST8) gene. This gene is characterized by a way of asymptomatic lifelong and non-stop dropping of the stratum corneum of the dermis. Its symptoms begin for the duration of the second half of the primary decade of existence and encompass generalized white scaling taking place over the upper and lower extremities.  Peeling Skin Syndrome 4  Peeling Skin Syndrome 4 is caused by a genetic defect in the Cystatin A (CSTA) gene. This gene is an intracellular thiol proteinase inhibitor. It has an essential role in desmosome-mediated cell-cellular adhesion inside the lower levels of the dermis. Its symptoms include well-circumcised peeling of skin on the extremities and neck, generalized dry skin with fine scaling and sparing of face, hyperkeratosis, and palmoplantar keratoderma  Peeling Skin Syndrome 5  Peling Skin Syndrome 5 is caused by a genetic defect in the Serpin (Serpin Family Member 8) gene. This gene is produced by platelets and can bind to and inhibit the function of furin, which is a serine protease involved in platelet functions. It is also characterized by superficial peeling of the dorsal and palmar pores and skin of the hands and feet; the pores and skin of the forearms and legs may also be involved. Its symptoms include superficial peeling of small areas of the skin that involve the dorsal and palmar surfaces of the hands and feet, superficial scaling of forearms and legs, and acanthosis.  Peeling Skin Syndrome 6  Peeling Skin Syndrome 6 is caused by a genetic defect in the Filaggrin (Filaggrin Family Member 2) gene. The function for this gene is vital for normal cellular-cell adhesion within the cornified cell layers. It is also critical for the integrity and mechanical strength of the stratum corneum of the epidermis. Its symptom include dryness of the skin, peeling of the skin. erythema at lesion sites, bullae, and hyper- pigmentation.  Symptoms  Symptoms: * Abnormal blistering of the skin * Abnormality of hair texture * Dry Skin * Aminoaciduria * Hyperhidrosis * Ichythosis  Treatment  There is no remedy for peeling skin syndrome. Treatment focuses on avoiding skin damage and treating symptoms as they occur. Ointments are also used to minimize skin peeling and when the blister grows, sterile needles may be activated. The condition can be exacerbated by hot temperatures, humidity, and friction. Individuals should be informed to avoid exacerbating triggers such as trauma, humidity, heat, perspiration, and water. Frequency Only several dozen cases have been reported in the literature, making it rare, but because its symptoms are mild and similar to other disorders it could very well be under-diagnosed.

Prasow is an American lawyer whose work particularly focuses on the rights of individuals detained in the \\"War on Terror\\". When she was with the firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, Prasow represented Saudi detainees in their petition for habeas corpus. Later as a defense attorney with the Office of Military Commissions, Prasow worked on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan, one of the first Guantanamo captives to face formal charges before the Guantanamo military commissions. Subsequently Prasow became a senior counsel with the Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program at Human Rights Watch. In that capacity Prasow investigates and analyzes U.S. counterterrorism policies and practices, and leads advocacy efforts urging the U.S. to implement policies that respect international standards of human rights. Prasow has written several pieces about the current military commission proceedings and her travels to Afghanistan to observe the newly public Detainee Review Boards held at the Detention Facility in Parwan. Education Prasow was raised in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and received her B.A. from the University of Toronto in 1999. From 1999-2000, Prasow worked for the University Health Network in Toronto, where she investigated workplace harassment claims and provided training on sexual harassment issues at the University of Toronto. Prasow then received her J.D. at the Georgetown University Law Center in 2003. Legal career Prasow was a litigation associate of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP until 2005. There she worked in civil litigation and took on a variety of pro bono cases. It was in this capacity that Prasow took on the representation of ten Saudi detainees at Guantanamo Bay in their habeas corpus proceedings in federal court. Prasow then moved to the Office of the Chief Defense Counsel, Office of Military Commissions, United States Department of Defense. Here she served as Assistant Defense Counsel for Salim Ahmed Hamdan's case before a Guantanamo military commission. During this case, she requested permission for a member of the Hamdan defense team to travel to secretive Camp 7. Hamdan's defense team sought the testimony of fourteen high value detainees held there, although several of the detainees declined because they believed the request was some kind of trick. Prasow later joined Human Rights Watch as Senior Counsel in their Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program. In that capacity Prasow traveled to Guantanamo to observe the December 3, 2009 hearing of Ibrahim Ahmed Mahmoud al Qosi. She was later invited to write a guest column in The Jurist with her critique of the proceedings. In her column Prasow was critical of Lieutenant Colonel Nancy Paul, al Qosi's Presiding Officer, for going forward with al Qosi's commission despite the fact that the rules of procedure for the new commission had not yet been drafted. Prasow was also one of the lawyers profiled in Mark Denbeaux and Jonathan Hafetz's book, The Guantanamo Lawyers: Inside a Prison Outside the Law. In the book, Prasow is quoted about the steps she took so as not to offend potentially conservative Muslim clients. She also references the disparity in treatment of lawyers in these cases, particularly between lawyers working on the detainees' habeas petitions and lawyers defending the detainees before the Guantanamo military commissions. Speaking engagements In February 2007, the Washington College of Law invited Prasow to attend a panel discussion on military commissions with Chief Prosecutor Morris Davis and Eugene Fidell, the President of the National Institute of Military Justice. In June 2009, Prasow was an invited speaker at an event organized by the American Society of International Law. The event, entitled \\"Women in International Law Networking Breakfast\\". was also attended by Kristine Huskey, Laura Black and Andrea Menaker. In May 2010, Prasow addressed the Canadian Parliament's Special Committee on the Canadian Mission in Afghanistan on the use of torture by the Afghan government.

From 1525 the counts of Oettingen supported the Reformation, and from 1558 Carthusian monks from Christgarten were called to be Protestant ministers. In the course of the Reformation the prior of H√ºrnheim (near Ederheim) also converted to the new teaching and from then on ministered to Christgarten in a Reformist spirit. Nevertheless, the charterhouse was not dissolved until after the Thirty Years' War, in 1649. In 1656 the bell tower was demolished; further buildings followed in the 18th and 19th centuries. All that remained of the monastic church was the choir, which was used as the Protestant parish church. The \\"Scheuffelin altar\\" was given to the Alte Pinakothek in Munich.

Some of these characters are fictionalised personas of, or are based on, actual historical figures, such as Zhu Yuanzhang, Chang Yuchun, Xu Da, Zhang Sanfeng and Chen Youliang. Main characters * Zhang Wuji () * Zhao Min () * Zhou Zhiruo () Ming Cult * The Bright Left and Right Messengers serve as the cult leader's deputies. They are:  Yang Xiao () is the Bright Left Messenger (ÂÖâÊòéÂ∑¶‰Ωø). He served as the cult's acting leader during its period of internal conflict, and later as an adviser to Zhang Wuji after the latter became the cult's leader. He is also a close friend and confidant to Zhang Wuji due to his relations to Yang's family. In the earlier revisions of the novel, Zhang Wuji names him the new leader of the Ming Cult before leaving with Zhao Min and they remain friends and in contact with each other. He is Ji Xiaofu's lover and Yang Buhui's father. Despite being named as Ming Cult's leader, he is unable to avert Zhu Yuanzhang's coup over the Cult's military commands and ascension to the imperial throne, thus Yang lost to Zhu of the chance to be an emperor.  Fan Yao () is the Bright Right Messenger (ÂÖâÊòéÂè≥‰Ωø). He disfigured himself and disguised himself as a mute monk called Kutoutuo () so that he could infiltrate Chaghan Tem√ºr's army and work as a spy for the Ming Cult. * The Four Guardian Kings (ÂõõÂ§ßË≠∑ÊïôÊ≥ïÁéã) assist the leader in overseeing the cult's activities. They are ranked in order of seniority:  Daiqisi (), nicknamed \\"Purple Dress Dragon King\\" (Á¥´Ë°´ÈæçÁéã) for her underwater fighting skills, is one of the three \\"Sacred Maidens\\" of the Persian Ming Cult. A half-Persian half- Chinese ambassador from Persia, she was originally sent to China to search for the lost manual of the skill \\"Heaven and Earth Great Shift\\" and became Yang Dingtian's god-daughter. She was later made one of the cult's guardian kings after defeating Han Qianye, a man who challenged Yang to a vengeful underwater duel. Later, she broke her vow of celibacy when she fell in love with Han Qianye, exiled herself out of the sect to settled on Divine Snake Island with Han, and bore him a daughter, Xiaozhao. She disguises herself as an old hag and calls herself \\"Golden Flower Granny\\" () to avoid being identified by the Persian Ming Cult.  Yin Tianzheng (), nicknamed \\"White Brows Eagle King\\" (ÁôΩÁúâÈ∑πÁéã), is Yin Yewang and Yin Susu's father, and Zhang Wuji's maternal grandfather. He left the Ming Cult during its internal conflict and founded the Heavenly Eagle Cult (Â§©È∑πÊïô) in his home region of Jiangnan. He later dies from exhaustion while trying to save Xie Xun by fighting against the three Shaolin elders.  Xie Xun (), nicknamed \\"Golden Haired Lion King\\" (ÈáëÊØõÁçÖÁéã), is Zhang Wuji's godfather. His most powerful skill is the 'Lion's Roar' (ÁçÖÂ≠êÂêº), which allows him to project his inner energy with his voice and cause internal injuries to everyone nearby who hears his roar. His family was murdered by his former mentor Cheng Kun, who disappeared after committing the atrocity. Guided by fury, he went on a rampage to kill many people and push the blame to Cheng Kun, in the hope of forcing him out of hiding, but to no avail. After he kidnapped Zhang Cuishan and Yin Susu, Yin blinded him with her needle darts in self-defence when he was in a violent fit of insanity. His insanity was cured when he heard the cry of Yin's newborn son, and agreed to Zhang and Yin's offer of him becoming the godfather of the baby, whom he named \\"Wuji\\" in memory of his own deceased son, Xie Wuji. The families and associates of Xie Xun's victims later forgave him after his final confrontation with Cheng Kun. He eventually becomes a Shaolin monk to seek peace and redemption for his past sins.  Wei Yixiao (), nicknamed \\"Green Winged Bat King\\" (ÈùíÁøºËù†Áéã), is unmatched in his qinggong prowess in the jianghu world. He once accidentally infected himself with an icy venom while practising the skill 'Icy Palm'. Since then, he has to routinely consume the warm blood of living creatures (including humans) to keep the freezing poison in his body under control. Zhang Wuji cures him later by using the Nine Yang Divine Skill to purge the venom from his body. After episode 49, he was the last guardian king. * Yang Buhui () is Yang Xiao and Ji Xiaofu's daughter. Her name literally means \\"no regrets\\" to reflect her mother's love for Yang Xiao. Zhang Wuji helps her escape from Miejue after her mother's death and leads her on a perilous journey to bring her safely to her father. She regards Zhang Wuji as a surrogate elder brother for his care and concern towards her. The trauma of witnessing her mother's death makes her become suspicious of anyone who could be a potential enemy and this intensifies her hatred towards Miejue.The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber ch. 25, pp. 1001-1002. This is evident in her treatment towards Xiaozhao, when she and her father suspect Xiaozhao of being a spy from the Emei Sect. It also made her extremely protective towards her father and Zhang Wuji, whom she sees as what is left of her family. She falls in love with Yin Liting, her mother's original fianc√©, and marries him despite the large age gap between them. They are expecting a child near the end of the novel. * Zhu Yuanzhang () is an ambitious minor leader of the cult who eventually unites the rebel forces under his control and leads them to overthrow the Yuan dynasty. He betrays the cult later and becomes the founding emperor of the Ming dynasty. * Chang Yuchun () is a cult member who travels with Zhang Wuji to Butterfly Valley to seek treatment from Hu Qingniu. * Xu Da () is a minor leader of the cult. Zhang Wuji presents him with Yue Fei's military text Book of Wumu. Xu Da, who is already a skilled military tactician, studies the book and uses his knowledge to lead the rebels to victory in the battles against the Yuan forces, ultimately captures the Yuan capital Khanbaliq and becomes an esteemed military figure in China. * Five Wanderers (‰∫îÊï£‰∫∫):  Leng Qian (), nicknamed \\"Cold Faced Gentleman\\" (ÂÜ∑Èù¢ÂÖàÁîü).  Shuobude (Can't-Be-Mentioned) (), nicknamed \\"Monk with the Sack\\" (Â∏ÉË¢ãÂíåÂ∞ö).  Zhang Zhong (), nicknamed \\"Iron Crowned Taoist\\" (ÈêµÂÜ†ÈÅì‰∫∫).  Peng Yingyu (), nicknamed \\"Peng the Monk\\" (ÂΩ≠ÂíåÂ∞ö).  Zhou Dian (), nicknamed \\"Lunatic\\" (ÁòãÂ≠ê). * Hu Qingniu () is a physician residing in Butterfly Valley. He is nicknamed \\"Jiansi Bujiu\\" (Ë¶ãÊ≠ª‰∏çÊïë; literally \\"watching one die by not saving him/her\\") for his odd practice of treating the cult's members free of charge but not others regardless of whatever they are willing to pay. He helps a young Zhang Wuji slow down the effects of his injury caused by the Xuanming Elders, thereby preserving Zhang's life and buying him time to find a way to heal himself. He also indirectly imparts his medical knowledge to Zhang Wuji, who is the only de facto student he ever took, thus becomes his mentor in medicine. He is killed by Golden Flower Granny in revenge because he refused to save her husband's life many years ago. However, in reality, it was beyond Hu's ability to treat Han Qianye's wounds.The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber ch. 13, pp. 493. * Wang Nangu () is Hu Qingniu's wife. In contrast with her husband, she uses her mastery of toxicology to kill people. The couple become rivals in a contest, in which Wang will poison someone while Hu will try to save the person's life. Sharing her husband's liking of Zhang Wuji, she imparts her knowledge to his de facto apprentice by leaving behind a book she authored. She is killed along with her husband by Golden Flower Granny. * Yang Dingtian () was Zhang Wuji's predecessor as the Ming Cult's leader. He was practising the skill 'Heaven and Earth Great Shift' when he discovered his wife's illicit affair with Cheng Kun. He was so infuriated that the inner energy flow in his body was disrupted and he died from the consequent internal injuries. * Chiefs of the Five Elements factions  Zhuang Zheng () is the chief of the Gold Banner Faction (Èä≥ÈáëÊóó). He is slain in combat by Miejue.  Wu Jingcao () is the former deputy chief of the Gold Banner Faction. Zhang Wuji promotes him to chief after Zhuang Zheng's death and tasks him with repairing the damaged Dragon Saber.  Yan Yuan () is the chief of the Earth Banner Faction (ÂéöÂúüÊóó).  Tang Yang () is the chief of the Water Banner Faction (Ê¥™Ê∞¥Êóó).  Wen Cangsong () is the chief of the Wood Banner Faction (Â∑®Êú®Êóó).  Xin Ran () is the chief of the Fire Banner Faction (ÁÉàÁÅ´Êóó). Heavenly Eagle Cult * Yin Susu () is Yin Tianzheng's daughter and Yin Yewang's younger sister. She meets Zhang Cuishan by coincidence and both of them are cast adrift to Ice Fire Island, where they are married and settled. She gives birth to Zhang Wuji. She follows suit after her husband commits suicide. * Yin Yewang () is Yin Tianzheng's son and Yin Susu's elder brother. He is Yin Li's father and Zhang Wuji's maternal uncle. His first wife (Yin Li's mother) practised the 'Thousand Spiders Venom Hand' (ÂçÉËõõËê¨ÊØíÊâã), became infertile and disfigured, and fell out of her husband's favour. Yin Yewang took a concubine who bore him two sons. Yin Li killed her stepmother because she often bullied her mother, and then fled from home to evade her father's wrath. In the earlier editions of the novel, with Zhang Wuji's help, Yin Yewang forgives his daughter and reconciles with her. * Yin Li () is Yin Yewang's estranged daughter and Zhang Wuji's younger cousin. She practises the Thousand Spiders Venom Hand, a deadly skill she inherits from her mother and which causes her face to become disfigured with edema. She is thus known as Zhu'er (), a nickname given to her by her mother. Her mother commits suicide to allow her to escape from her father and half-brothers after she killed her stepmother, and she became despised by her father ever since. She encounters Golden Flower Granny, who protects her and accepts her as an apprentice. She develops feelings for Zhang Wuji when she first met him in her childhood but does not recognise him when she meets him again later. She is apparently murdered by Zhou Zhiruo but is revealed at the end of the novel to have survived. * Leaders of the halls and altars:  Li Tianyuan () is the leader of the Heaven Hall. He is Yin Tianzheng's junior.  Chang Jinpeng () is the leader of the Vermilion Bird Altar. He is slain by Xie Xun.  Bai Guishou () is the leader of the Black Tortoise Altar. He is slain by Ding Minjun.  Cheng Chaofeng () is the leader of the Azure Dragon Altar.  Gao Shanwang () is the leader of the White Tiger Altar  Feng Gongying () is the leader of the Divine Snake Altar. * Yin Wufu (), Yin Wulu (), Yin Wushou () are three bandits from the southwest who pledged allegiance to Yin Tianzheng after he saved their lives. Persian Ming Cult * Xiaozhao () is Han Qianye and Daiqisi's daughter. Her mother sends her as a spy to infiltrate the Ming Cult and find the location of its secret tunnel. Xiaozhao becomes a servant in Yang Xiao's household. The Yangs suspect her of being a spy so they bind her in chains to restrict her movements. Xiaozhao runs into Zhang Wuji and narrowly escapes death with him in the secret tunnel. Xiaozhao falls in love with Zhang Wuji but can never be with him because she has to take her mother's place as a virginal \\"Sacred Maiden\\" to save her mother's life. She eventually becomes the new leader of the Persian Ming Cult and returns to its headquarters in Persia. Jin Yong mentioned in the epilogue of the novel that Xiaozhao is his favourite character. Epilogue of The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber * The Wind, Cloud and Moon Three Messengers (È¢®Èõ≤Êúà‰∏â‰Ωø) are in charge of safekeeping the Ming Cult's sacred artefacts ‚Äì the Holy Flame Tablets. There are the most powerful martial artists in the Persian Ming Cult. The three are:  Mysterious Wind Messenger ()  Drifting Cloud Messenger ()  Bright Moon Messenger () * The 12 Guardian Kings (ÂØ∂Ê®πÁéã) of the Persian Ming Cult come to China to search for Daiqisi and bring her back to Persia. Four of them appear in the novel:  Equality Guardian King ()  Unity Guardian King ()  Transparent Guardian King ()  Victorious Guardian King () Yuan Empire * Chaghan Tem√ºr (), the Prince of Ruyang (), is the father of Wang Baobao and the former father of Zhao Min (before disowning her). He is ordered by the Yuan emperor to eliminate the Ming Cult and other anti-Yuan forces in the wulin (martial arts community). * Lady Han () is Chaghan Tem√ºr's concubine. She is killed in Wan'an Monastery by Fan Yao by accident. * K√∂ke Tem√ºr (), also known by his Chinese name Wang Baobao (), is Chaghan Tem√ºr's son and Zhao Min's elder brother. * The Xuanming Elders () are the apprentices of the late Taoist Baisun (). They specialise in the skill 'Xuanming Divine Palm' (ÁéÑÊòéÁ•ûÊéå) and once used it on Zhang Wuji in his childhood. They serve Chaghan Tem√ºr as mercenaries. Later, after seeing how powerful Zhou Zhiruo has become from practising the skills in the Nine Yin Manual, they attempt to seize the book from her, but are unwilling to share it with each other so they start fighting over the manual. Zhang Wuji and Zhao Min show up to help Zhou Zhiruo and defeat the Xuanming Elders. In the earlier editions of the novel, the Elders lose their powers after their last fight with Zhang Wuji. The two Elders are:  Lu Zhangke (), a lecherous fiend who has raped many young women. He lusts for Lady Han and Zhou Zhiruo.  He Biweng (), who has a penchant for fine wine. * Huogong Toutuo's apprentices are recruited by Chaghan Tem√ºr as mercenaries. They and Cheng Kun massacred the Dragon Gate Escort Agency and paralysed Yu Daiyan. 20 years later, they ambush and injure Yin Liting. They are defeated by Zhang Wuji in a fight. They are:  Fang Dongbai (), also called A'da (), is nicknamed \\"Eight Arms Divine Swordsman\\" (ÂÖ´ËáÇÁ•ûÂäç) because his skill in swordplay appears to be unmatched. He was originally a high-ranking member of the Beggars' Sect, but later faked his death and served Chaghan as one of the mercenaries.  A'er ()  A'san () paralysed Yu Daiyan and Yin Liting.  Gangxiang () is killed by Zhang Sanfeng when he tried to ambush him while in disguise as a Shaolin monk called Kongxiang (). * The \\"Divine Arrow Eight Heroes\\" (Á•ûÁÆ≠ÂÖ´ÈõÑ) are a group of eight martial artists recruited by Chaghan Tem√ºr as mercenaries. They are:  Zhao Yishang ()  Qian Erbai ()  Sun Sanhui ()  Li Sicui ()  Zhou Wushu ()  Wu Liupo ()  Zheng Qimie ()  Wang Bashuai () Wudang Sect * Zhang Sanfeng () is the founder and leader of Wudang. He was previously from the Shaolin Sect and was known as Zhang Junbao () in his younger days. The famed Condor Hero, Yang Guo, taught Zhang Junbao a little of his skills, that the boy later combined with what learned from the Nine Yang Manual, formed the basis of Zhang Sanfeng's martial arts. Not knowing Zhang Junbao's skills' origins, the Shaolin Sect accused him of learning their martial arts in secret and exiled him, eventually he became a Taoist after realizing his skills are Taoism by nature and founded the Wudang Sect. The aged Taoist is highly respected in the wulin (martial artists' community) not only for his prowess in martial arts, but also for his morally upright character. * The \\"Seven Heroes of Wudang\\" () are the first seven apprentices of Zhang Sanfeng. They are listed in order of seniority:  Song Yuanqiao () is Song Qingshu's father. Originally a reputable swordsman and the most likely candidate to succeed his master, he is disgraced by his son's misconduct and loses the opportunity to be Wudang's new leader. Zhang Sanfeng orders him to spend the rest of his life in solitude.  Yu Lianzhou () is the most powerful in martial arts among the seven. He is named by Zhang Sanfeng as his successor.  Yu Daiyan () was ambushed and paralysed by A'san http://www.jyjh.com.cn/jinyong/11/mydoc010.htm and lost the use of his limbs. He receives medical treatment from Zhang Wuji 20 years after his injury but only manages to recover partially and can no longer utilise the full potential of his martial arts.  Zhang Songxi () is the most intelligent among the seven. He occasionally provides advice to his fellows.  Zhang Cuishan () is the most talented of the seven, and the last disciple to actually be personally taught by Zhang Sanfeng. Apart from being an accomplished swordsman, he is also well versed in scholarly arts and calligraphy. His distinctive weapons earn him the nickname \\"Silver Hook Iron Brush\\" (ÈêµÂäÉÈäÄÈâ§). He is Zhang Wuji's father and Xie Xun's sworn brother. He meets Yin Susu by chance and they are cast adrift to Ice Fire Island, where they are married and settled there for ten years. He commits suicide after being cornered by martial artists when he refuses to reveal Xie Xun's whereabouts.  Yin Liting () was Ji Xiaofu's original fianc√©. Their engagement ended when she realised that she loved Yang Xiao and was already pregnant with Yang's child. Many years later, after Yin Liting is injured in the same way as Yu Daiyan, her daughter Yang Buhui nurses him back to health and falls in love with him when he is recovering. Yin marries Yang Buhui eventually despite the large age gap between them. They are expecting a child towards the end of the novel.  Mo Shenggu () is the youngest of the seven and the most hot-tempered one. He tries to discipline Song Qingshu after discovering his voyeuristic attempts on Zhou Zhiruo and the Emei Sect's members, but is ambushed by Chen Youliang and killed by Song Qingshu. * Song Qingshu () is Song Yuanqiao's arrogant spoilt son, who serves as a foil to Zhang Wuji in the novel due to their similar backgrounds. His strong crush on Zhou Zhiruo makes him become extremely jealous when he sees Zhang Wuji and Zhou developing a romantic relationship. That ultimately becomes his weakness because it allows him to be manipulated easily by Chen Youliang and Cheng Kun into doing anything to win Zhou Zhiruo's heart and prove that he is better than Zhang Wuji. After killing Mo Shenggu, he betrays the Wudang Sect and reluctantly joins the Beggars' Sect and helps Chen Youliang. Later, after Zhang Wuji reneges on his promise to marry Zhao Min instead as that is his true love, Zhou Zhiruo pretends to agree to marry Song Qingshu and teaches him the 'Nine Yin White Bone Claw' while actually plotting to use him to take her revenge on Zhang. Emei Sect * Guo Xiang () was the founder of Emei and the younger daughter of Guo Jing and Huang Rong. In the prologue, she met Jueyuan and Zhang Junbao (Zhang Sanfeng) near Shaolin Monastery. Jueyuan recited the Nine Yang Manual to her, Zhang, and Wuse before his death. Guo Xiang's prowess in martial arts improved after she integrated the manual's skills into her existing ones. She inherited the Heaven Sword and knowledge of the secrets in the weapons from her family during the Battle of Xiangyang. After her family members sacrificed their lives to defend Xiangyang from Mongol invaders, she continued to roam the jianghu for years before settling down on Mount Emei, where she founded the Emei Sect. (See Template:Guo Jing and Huang Rong's family tree for her family tree.) * Abbess Miejue (), whose name \\"Miejue\\" literally means \\"destroy and eliminate\\", is the radically dogmatic leader of Emei. She aims to purge the world of evil and make Emei the leading sect in the wulin (martial artists' community). Her dogmatic and extreme views lead her to commit various ethically and morally vicious deeds, including the indiscriminate slaughter of everyone associated with the Ming Cult and unorthodox martial arts sects. She hates the Ming Cult not only because of its \\"evil\\" name, but also because of Yang Xiao's indirect involvement in the events leading to Guhongzi's death. At Wan'an Monastery, she names Zhou Zhiruo her successor and plunges to her death from the tower after refusing Zhang Wuji's help. * Guhongzi () was Miejue's senior. He challenged Yang Xiao to a martial arts contest and borrowed Miejue's Heaven- Reliant Sword in the hope that it would give him an advantage. However, he lost to Yang Xiao and the sword was seized from him by Yang before he could even unsheathe it. Yang Xiao made some unkind remarks, threw the sword to the ground and walked away. Guhongzi felt disgraced and insulted and eventually died in frustration. His death caused Miejue to bear a grudge against Yang Xiao and the Ming Cult. * Ji Xiaofu () is one of Miejue's apprentices who is seen as a potential successor to her master. She is originally Yin Liting's fianc√©e but falls in love with Yang Xiao instead and bears him a daughter. She secretly leaves Emei to raise her child, whom she names \\"Buhui\\" (literally \\"no regrets\\") to reflect her love for Yang Xiao. She is emotionally attached to Zhang Wuji after witnessing him being orphaned at Mount Wudang, and in turn he regards her as a surrogate mother. Miejue eventually tracks her down and forces her to kill Yang Xiao, but she refuses and is killed by her master in grief. * Ding Minjun () is one of Miejue's most senior apprentices. She is jealous of their master's favouritism towards Ji Xiaofu and later towards Zhou Zhiruo. Peng Yingyu once remarked that she is \\"ugly in appearance and evil- hearted\\" (ÊØíÊâãÁÑ°ÈπΩ; literally \\"venomous hand without salt\\") after she blinded his right eye.Chapter 11 She once self-appointed herself as Emei's acting leader when Zhou Zhiruo went missing, but her peers were reluctant to follow her because of her selfishness. * Bei Jinyi () is one of Miejue's apprentices and a junior of Ding Minjun and Ji Xiaofu. When her master orders her and Ding to pursue and kill Yang Buhui, she decides to spare the child on account of her past relations with Ji Xiaofu (Yang Buhui's mother), so she lies to Miejue that Yang has already escaped. * Zhao Lingzhu () * Li Mingxia () * Su Mengqing () * Fang Bilin () * Jingxuan () is accidentally injured by Zhang Wuji when she was making her way to Bright Peak. She collects the remains of the broken Heaven Sword at the end of the story. * Jinghui () is an impulsive nun who explains to Zhang Wuji the truth about Zhou Zhiruo's relationship with Song Qingshu. * Jingxu () is killed by Wei Yixiao during her journey to Bright Peak. * Jingzhao () attempts to assassinate Xie Xun at the Lion Slaying Ceremony. * Jingjia () killed Situ Qianzhong and Xia Zhou at the Lion Slaying Ceremony with the Thunderbolt Fire Bombs (ÈúπÈùÇÈõ∑ÁÅ´ÂΩà). * Jingkong () * Jingxian () * Jingzhen () * Jingdao () * Jingfeng () * Jingxin () * Jinghe () Shaolin Sect * Jueyuan () was Wuse and Wuxiang's junior. He is credited as Zhang Sanfeng's martial arts master. Before his death, he recited the Nine Yang Manual to his apprentice and Guo Xiang, who respectively founded the Wudang and Emei sects later. * Cheng Kun (), nicknamed \\"Hunyuan Thunderbolt Hand\\" (Ê∑∑ÂÖÉÈúπÈùÇÊâã), is the primary antagonist in the novel and a formidable martial artist. He seeks to destroy the Ming Cult after his junior, whom he had a crush on, married Yang Dingtian and committed suicide to join her husband. He disguised himself as a Shaolin monk called Yuanzhen () and successfully stirred up conflict between the Ming Cult and the six major orthodox sects through a series of machinations. Years before his junior's marriage to Yang Dingtian, he accepted Xie Xun as his apprentice but then killed Xie's family in cold blood after discovering that he joined the Ming Cult before disappearing. Although he dislikes the Mongols, he still reluctantly becomes an adviser to Chaghan Tem√ºr and helps him devise plans to eliminate the Ming Cult. As the story progresses, he becomes corrupted by his lust for power and plots with Chen Youliang to dominate the wulin (martial artists' community), but their plan is foiled by Zhang Wuji and others. He is eventually defeated and blinded by Xie Xun, becomes a handicap for the rest of his life. * Four Holy Monks (ÂõõÂ§ßÁ•ûÂÉß):  Kongjian () mastered the art of invincibility.

Kongzhi () is Kongwen's hot-tempered junior.  Kongxing () is murdered by A'San. * The Three Elders of the Bodhidharma Hall (ÈÅîÊë©Â†Ç‰∏âÂÖÉËÄÅ) form the 'Vajra Evil Subduing Ring' (ÈáëÂâõ‰ºèÈ≠îÂúà) to guard Xie Xun when he is held captive in Shaolin. More than 30 years ago, they fought with Yang Dingtian after being instigated by Cheng Kun and were injured by him. Since then, they have retreated into a state of \\"withering meditation\\" (ÊûØÁ¶™). They become more aware of Cheng Kun's wicked intentions after listening to Zhang Wuji's explanations. The Three Elders are:  Du'e () lost his left eye during the fight with Yang Dingtian. He trusts Zhang Wuji despite standing on an opposing side.

Kunlun Sect * He Zudao () was nicknamed \\"Kunlun Three Sage\\" (Â¥ëÂ¥ô‰∏âËÅñ). He disappeared mysteriously after being defeated by Jueyuan. Yinkexi, one of the two men who stole the Nine Yang Manual from Shaolin, told him the whereabouts of the manual before dying. He Zudao misheard the message and passed on the wrong information in the jianghu. The name He Zudao is a word play with the old Chinese phrase hezudao(no need to mention). * He Taichong (), nicknamed \\"Mr Iron Zither\\" (ÈêµÁê¥ÂÖàÁîü), is the ungrateful and immoral leader of Kunlun. He and his wife try to kill Zhang Wuji and Yang Buhui after Zhang saved his concubine from death, but Yang Xiao saves Zhang and Yang. Later in the novel, he attempts to kill Xie Xun, who is held captive in Shaolin, so that he can take the Dragon Saber, but is slain by the three Shaolin elders. * Ban Shuxian () is He Taichong's wife and an expert in the 'Dual Swordplay' (Ê≠£ÂÖ©ÂÑÄÂäçÊ≥ï).

Hu Qingniu once saved his life when he was infected with Golden Worm Poison by Lady Miao, whom he previously had a relationship with. Hu Qingniu's sister, Hu Qingyang, fell in love with him while he was recovering and married him. However, he forced Hu Qingyang to die so that he can marry the daughter of his predecessor, even though she was already pregnant with his child. Xianyu Tong's wicked deed was discovered by his senior, Bai Yuan, whom he killed before the secret was revealed. He then framed the Ming Cult for the murder. During the battle at Bright Peak, Xianyu Tong attempts to kill Zhang Wuji, who is aware of his dirty secrets, but is infected with the Golden Worm Poison again. Zhang Wuji defeats him and exposes his past atrocities. Xianyu Tong dies at the hands of He Taichong incidentally during the fight. * Xue Gongyuan () is one of Xianyu Tong's apprentices. He and several others were injured by Golden Flower Granny and went to Butterfly Valley to seek treatment from Hu Qingniu. They are healed by Zhang Wuji, but betray him later and make cannibalistic attempts on him and Yang Buhui. Zhang tricks them into consuming a poisonous broth, which kills them. Kongtong Sect * The \\"Five Elders of Kongtong\\" (Â¥ÜÂ≥í‰∫îËÄÅ) bore a grudge against Xie Xun after he stole the 'Seven Harms Fist' (‰∏ÉÂÇ∑Êã≥) manual from them. They are defeated by Zhang Wuji at Bright Peak. The fifth elder's name is not mentioned in the novel. The other four are:  Guan Neng ()  Zong Weixia () holds a grudge against Yin Tianzheng after they once fought in the past. He becomes Zhang Wuji's ally in Kongtong after Zhang treats his wounds during their match at Bright Peak. He renounces his past feud with the Ming Cult.

Chang Jingzhi () * Jian Jie () is a minor member of the sect who was injured by Golden Flower Granny. He is healed by Zhang Wuji but repays his kindness with evil by making cannibalistic attempts on Zhang and Yang Buhui. He is tricked by Zhang into consuming a poisonous broth that took his life. Beggars' Sect * Chen Youliang () is Cheng Kun's apprentice and therefore is Xie Xun's junior. He serves the Beggars' Sect as a spy for his master and manipulates Song Qingshu into betraying the Wudang Sect. He defects to the Ming Cult after Cheng Kun's defeat but betrays the cult later and becomes a territorial warlord after the fall of the Yuan Empire. * Shi Huolong () is the sect's chief. He is hardly known to the wulin (martial artists' community) because he rarely made public appearances. He was murdered by Cheng Kun and Chen Youliang, who replaced him with an impostor under their control. * Shi Hongshi () is Shi Huolong's daughter. She was rescued by the Yellow Dress Maiden after her father was murdered. She succeeds her father as the chief of the Beggars' Sect.

Owned by Golden West Broadcasting, it broadcasts a country music format. History The station was originally a rebroadcaster of CFIT- FM/Airdrie on 95.3 FM. In March 2009, the CRTC approved an application by original owner Tiessen Media to move the transmitter to a new, higher location, and change its frequency to 91.5 FM. Tiessen cited that this would improve reception (especially among those commuting from Calgary), and allow it to be fed over-the-air by CFIT's main signal. On July 9, 2015, the station's current owner Golden West Broadcasting submitted an application to the CRTC to replace CFIT-FM-1 with a new autonomous station serving Cochrane on the same frequency, airing a country music format with a focus on local news and information. The application was denied by the CRTC: although the station's signal would only reach a small portion of Calgary, there was a concern that the station would not be economically viable in the present economic environment, and there was a risk that it would have to rely on advertising sales outside of Cochrane, which could dilute the revenue and audience of Calgary-based stations, even if it were to be formally forbidden from soliciting advertising in Calgary. On December 3, 2018, the CRTC approved a revised application for the station, citing improving economic conditions and population growth in Calgary and Cochrane that are sufficient to support a new radio station, a signal with a shorter primary contour than before (only covering Cochrane and its immediate area, thus creating a new radio market), and Golden West agreeing to a condition of license forbidding the station from soliciting advertising in the city of Calgary. On October 24, 2019, the new station officially launched as 91.5 Cochrane Now, with the call letters CKXY- FM. Call letter history The CKXY callsign was used at a number of unrelated defunct radio stations such as AM 1040 Vancouver, British Columbia in the late 1980's and 92.3 FM in Fort Smith, Northwest Territories, a repeater of CIRK-FM Edmonton, until it left the air in 2018.

The species is also kept as an exotic pet. Description Acrochordus javanicus possesses a wide and flat head, and its nostrils are situated on the top of the snout. Those head particularities confer to A. javanicus a certain resemblance with boas. However, its head is only as wide as its body. Females are bigger than males, and the maximum total length (including tail) of an individual is . The dorsal side of the snake's body is brown, and its ventral side is pale yellow. The skin is baggy and loose giving the impression that it is too big for the animal. The skin is covered with small rough adjacent scales. The skin is also used in the tannery industry. The top of the head has no large shields, but instead is covered with very small granular scales. There are no ventral scales. The body scales are in about 120 rows around the body. The body is stout, and the tail is short and prehensile.Boulenger GA (1893). Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History).

(Taylor and Francis, printers). xiii + 448 pp. + Plates I-XXVIII. (Genus Acrochordus and species A. javanicus, p. 173). A. javanicus is fully adapted to live underwater so much that its body cannot support its weight out of water and leaving the water can cause it serious injury. Reproduction An aquatic snake, A. javanicus is ovoviviparous, with the incubation lasting 5 to 6 months and the female expelling 6 to 17 young. Geographic range Acrochordus javanicus is found in South-East Asia west of the Wallace Line: southern Thailand, the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore, Borneo (Kalimantan, Sarawak), a number of Indonesian islands (Java, Sumatra, and (possibly) Bali); possibly also in Cambodia and Vietnam, although the last is discredited by the IUCN. Habitat Acrochordus javanicus has a coastal living habitat like rivers, estuaries and lagoons. But it prefers freshwater and brackish environments. Feeding Acrochordus javanicus is an ambush predator that preys on fishes and amphibians. It usually catches its prey by folding its body firmly around the prey. Its loose, baggy skin and its sharp scales find their utility by limiting any risk of escape of the prey, in particular fishes which have bodies covered with a viscous, protective mucus. Behaviour Acrochordus javanicus is nocturnal. It spends most of its life under water and rarely goes on land. It can stay under water for up to 40 minutes.

Later in the novel, he collaborates with the Mongols to seize the leadership position of his sect, but his plans are foiled and he is killed by Xiaolongn√º's jade bees. * Zhen Zhibing () is a senior member of Quanzhen. He has a crush on Xiaolongn√º and is unable to restrain himself and blindfolds and rapes Xiaolongn√º when the latter was immobilised by Ouyang Feng. Xiaolongn√º is unaware that Zhen was the one who raped her and she wrongly accused Yang Guo until the truth is revealed several years later. He sacrifices himself to save Xiaolongn√º from death. He was called Yin Zhiping () in earlier editions. The amendment is due to Jin Yong's reluctance to vilify Yin Zhiping, whose historical namesake is a notable Taoist. (See Â∞πÂøóÂπ≥ on the Chinese Wikipedia for information on the historical Yin Zhiping.) Dali Kingdom * Liu Ying (), also known as Yinggu (), is nicknamed \\"Divine Mathematician\\" (Á•ûÁÆóÂ≠ê). She was originally Duan Zhixing's concubine when he was still the emperor of Dali. She had a secret affair with Zhou Botong and bore him a son, but their son died at the hands of Qiu Qianren.

He participates in the martial arts contest at Dasheng Pass, and later appears to help the protagonists in defending Xiangyang from the Mongols. * Wu Sanniang () was Wu Santong's wife and the mother of the Wu brothers. Her husband was injured and poisoned by Li Mochou, and she saved his life by sucking out the venom from his wound. However, she died from poisoning and Wu Santong was so traumatised that he went berserk and disappeared for many years, only to return when his sons have grown up. Peach Blossom Island * Ke Zhen'e () is the sole surviving member of the \\"Seven Freaks of Jiangnan\\" from the first novel. He lives with the Guos and is respected as an elder in the family. Despite holding a grudge against Yang Guo's father for the deaths of his fellows, he treats the boy like the rest of the Guo children after sensing that Yang is not corrupt and likes him. Years later, he relates the story of Yang Kang to Yang Guo at the Temple of the Iron Spear. He admires Yang Guo for his chivalry, and is also grateful to Yang for saving his life from Sha Tongtian and company. He forgives Yang Guo's father and promises to help Yang reconstruct his father's tomb. * Shagu () is the orphaned daughter of Qu Lingfeng. Huang Yaoshi took her under his care and trained her as his apprentice. Upon learning that she was present at the scene of his father's death, Yang Guo attempts to force her to tell him the details about the incident.

Within the Lamiaceae, Salvia is part of the tribe Mentheae within the subfamily Nepetoideae. One of several genera commonly referred to as sage, it includes the widely produced herb used in cooking, Salvia officinalis (common sage, or just \\"sage\\"). The genus is distributed throughout the Old World and the Americas (over 900 total species), with three distinct regions of diversity: Central and South America (approx. 600 species); Central Asia and Mediterranean (250 species); Eastern Asia (90 species). Etymology  The name Salvia (\\"salviya\\") derives from the Latin salvere (\\"to feel well and healthy, health, heal\\"), the verb related to salus (health, well-being, prosperity or salvation), referring to the herb's healing properties. Pliny the Elder was the first author known to describe a plant called \\"Salvia\\" by the Romans, likely describing the type species for the genus Salvia, Salvia officinalis. The common modern English name sage derives from Middle English sawge, which was borrowed from Old French sauge, and like the botanical name, stems from Latin salvere.Kintzios, pp. 15‚Äì16.Clebsch, p. 17. When used without modifiers, the name 'sage' generally refers to Salvia officinalis (\\"common sage\\" or \\"culinary sage\\"); however, it is used with modifiers to refer to any member of the genus. The ornamental species are commonly referred to by their genus name Salvia.  Description  Salvia species include annual, biennial, or perennial herbs, along with woody subshrubs. The stems are typically angled like other members in Lamiaceae. The leaves are typically entire, but sometimes toothed or pinnately divided. The flowering stems bear small bracts, dissimilar to the basal leaves‚Äîin some species the bracts are ornamental and showy. The flowers are produced in racemes, or panicles, and generally produce a showy display with flower colors ranging from blue to red, with white and yellow less common. The calyx is normally tubular or bell shaped, without bearded throats, and divided into two parts or lips, the upper lip entire or three-toothed, the lower two-cleft. The corollas are often claw shaped and are two-lipped. The upper lip is usually entire or three-toothed. The lower lip typically has two lobes. The stamens are reduced to two short structures with anthers two-celled, the upper cell fertile, and the lower imperfect. The flower styles are two-cleft. The fruits are smooth ovoid or oblong nutlets and in many species they have a mucilaginous coating. Many members of Salvia have trichomes (hairs) growing on the leaves, stems, and flowers, which help to reduce water loss in some species. Sometimes the hairs are glandular and secrete volatile oils that typically give a distinct aroma to the plant. When the hairs are rubbed or brushed, some of the oil-bearing cells are ruptured, releasing the oil. This often results in the plant being unattractive to grazing animals and some insects. Staminal lever mechanism digger bee probing a male-stage flower of Salvia hierosolymitana. The stamens deposit pollen on the bee's back. The defining characteristic of the genus Salvia is the unusual pollination mechanism. It is central to any investigation into the systematics, species distribution, or pollination biology of Salvia. It consists of two stamens (instead of the typical four found in other members of the tribe Mentheae) and the two thecae on each stamen are separated by an elongate connective which enables the formation of the lever mechanism. Sprengel (1732) was the first to illustrate and describe the nototribic (dorsal) pollination mechanism in Salvia.Sprengel, C. K. 1793. Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Pflanzen. Friedrich Vieweg dem aeltern, Berlin, Germany. When a pollinator probes a male stage flower for nectar, (pushing the posterior anther theca) the lever causes the stamens to move and the pollen to be deposited on the pollinator. When the pollinator withdraws from the flower, the lever returns the stamens to their original position. In older, female stage flowers, the stigma is bent down in a general location that corresponds to where the pollen was deposited on the pollinator's body. The lever of most Salvia species is not specialized for a single pollinator, but is generic and selected to be easily released by many bird and bee pollinators of varying shapes and sizes. The lever arm can be specialized to be different lengths so that the pollen is deposited on different parts of the pollinator‚Äôs body.Classen-Bockhoff R, Tweraser E, Wester P. 2003. The staminal lever mechanism in Salvia L. (Lamiaceae) ‚Äì a review. Plant Biology 5: 33‚Äì41. For example, if a bee went to one flower and pollen was deposited on the far back of her body, but then it flew to another flower where the stigma was more forward (anterior), pollination could not take place. This can result in reproductive isolation from the parental population and new speciation can occur. It is believed that the lever mechanism is a key factor in the speciation, adaptive radiation, and diversity of this large genus. Taxonomy = History  George Bentham was first to give a full monographic account of the genus in 1832‚Äì1836, and based his classifications on staminal morphology. Bentham's work on classifying the family Labiatae (Labiatarum Genera et Species (1836)) is still the only comprehensive and global organization of the family. While he was clear about the integrity of the overall family, he was less confident about his organization of Salvia, the largest genus in Labiatae (also called Lamiaceae). Based on his own philosophy of classification, he wrote that he \\"ought to have formed five or six genera\\" out of Salvia. In the end, he felt that the advantage in placing a relatively uniform grouping in one genus was \\"more than counterbalanced by the necessity of changing more than two hundred names.\\" At that time there were only 291 known Salvia species.  Subdivision  Bentham eventually organized Salvia into twelve sections (originally fourteen), based on differences in corolla, calyx, and stamens. These were placed into four subgenera that were generally divided into Old World and New World species: *Subgenus Salvia: Old World (Sections: Hymenosphace, Eusphace, Drymosphace) *Subgenus Sclarea: Old World (Sections: Horminum, Aethiposis, Plethiosphace) *Subgenus Calosphace: New World (Section: Calosphace) *Subgenus Leonia: Old and New World (Sections: Echinosphace, Pycnosphace, Heterosphace, Notiosphace, Hemisphace) His system is still the most widely studied classification of Salvia, even though more than 500 new species have been discovered since his work. Other botanists have since offered modified versions of Bentham's classification system, while botanists in the last hundred years generally do not endorse Bentham's system. It was long assumed that Salvia's unusual pollination and stamen structure had evolved only once, and that therefore Salvia was monophyletic, meaning that all members of the genus evolved from one ancestor. However, the immense diversity in staminal structure, vegetative habit, and floral morphology of the species within Salvia has opened the debate about its infrageneric classifications.  Phylogenetic analyses  Through DNA sequencing, Salvia was shown to not be monophyletic but to consist of three separate clades (Salvia clades I‚ÄìIII) each with different sister groups. They also found that the staminal lever mechanism evolved at least two separate times, through convergent evolution. Walker and Sytsma (2007) clarified this parallel evolution in a later paper combining molecular and morphological data to prove three independent lineages of the Salvia lever mechanism, each corresponding to a clade within the genus. It is surprising to see how similar the staminal lever mechanism structures are between the three lineages, so Salvia proves to be an interesting but excellent example of convergent evolution. Walker and Sytsma (2007) also addressed the question of whether Salvia is truly polyphyletic or just paraphyletic within the tribe Mentheae. To make Salvia monophyletic would require the inclusion of 15 species from Rosmarinus, Perovskia, Dorystaechas, Meriandra, and Zhumeria genera. The information attained by Walker and Sytsma (2007) supporting the three independent origins of the staminal lever indicate that Salvia is not the case where 15 species (currently not members of the genus) are actually members of Salvia but underwent character reversals‚Äîin other words, Salvia is paraphyletic as previously circumscribed. In 2017 Drew et al.Drew, B. T., Gonz√°lez-Gallegos, J. G., Xiang, C. L., Kriebel, R., Drummond, C. P., Walker, J. B. and Sytsma, K. J., 2017. \\"Salvia united: The greatest good for the greatest number\\". Taxon, 66(1), pp. 133‚Äì145. recircumscribed Salvia, proposing that the five small embedded genera (Dorystaechas, Meriandra, Perovskia, Rosmarinus, and Zhumeria) be subsumed into a broadly defined Salvia. This approach would require only 15 name changes whereas maintaining the five small genera and renaming various Salvia taxa would require over 700 name changes. The circumscription of individual species within Salvia has undergone constant revision. Many species are similar to each other, and many species have varieties that have been given different specific names. There have been as many as 2,000 named species and subspecies. Over time, the number has been reduced to less than a thousand. A modern and comprehensive study of Salvia species was done by Gabriel Alziar, in his Catalogue Synonymique des Salvia du Monde (1989) (World Catalog of Salvia Synonyms). He found that the number of distinct species and subspecies could be reduced to less than 700.Clebsch, p. 18. Selected species and their uses Salvia farinacea √ó Salvia longispicata 'Mystic Spires Blue' Many species are used as herbs, as ornamental plants (usually for flower interest), and sometimes for their ornamental and aromatic foliage.

Five Mountain Sword Sects Alliance=Mount Hua Sect * Linghu Chong () is the happy-go-lucky protagonist of the novel. An orphan, he was raised by Yue Buqun and Ning Zhongze as their most senior apprentice. He learns the 'Nine Swords of Dugu' from Feng Qingyang and becomes a formidable swordsman. His sudden leap in swordplay prowess causes his master to suspect him of having stolen the Bixie Swordplay Manual and mastered the skill. Even after his expulsion from Mount Hua, he remains loyal and respectful towards his former master; however, they ultimately become enemies after Yue Buqun is revealed to be a power-hungry hypocrite. Although Linghu Chong's kind nature and heroic attributes make him a likeable person, they also negatively influence him by increasing his affiliations with jianghu lowlifes, resulting in him being misunderstood by his fellows and other orthodox sects. He retires from the jianghu eventually to lead a peaceful life with Ren Yingying. ;Qi faction * Yue Buqun () is the leader of the Mount Hua Sect. He is an expert in using the 'Violet Mist Divine Skill' (Á¥´ÈúûÁ•ûÂäü). Although he is nicknamed \\"Gentleman Sword\\" (ÂêõÂ≠êÂäç) for his seemingly gentlemanly conduct, he gradually reveals his true personality ‚Äì a bigoted, narcissistic and power- hungry hypocrite. Only a few people, such as Feng Qingyang, Ren Woxing and Zuo Lengchan, are aware of his true nature and they look upon him with contempt. He lusts for the Lin family's Bixie Swordplay Manual and plots an elaborate scheme to seize it, after which he castrates himself to fulfil the prerequisite for learning the swordplay. He also resents Linghu Chong of his sudden leap in martial prowess and refuses to have an apprentice who surpasses him in skills, which becomes a part of his motivation to master the Bixie Swordplay. His hatred intensifies when he discovers that his former apprentice has mastered a powerful orthodox swordplay that without the Bixie Swordplay's prerequisite. He is incidentally killed by Yilin during the final battle with Linghu Chong while attempting to trap and kill his rivals inside a cave on Mount Hua. * Ning Zhongze (), nicknamed \\"Heroine Ning\\" (ÂØßÂ•≥‰ø†), is Yue Buqun's chivalrous and kindly wife. She regards Linghu Chong as a son and is also the only person who believes his innocence in the theft of the Bixie Swordplay Manual. She loses her will to live after seeing her husband reveal his true colours and learning of her daughter's death, and eventually commits suicide out of shame at her husband's actions. * Yue Lingshan () is Yue Buqun and Ning Zhongze's daughter and Linghu Chong's first romantic interest. She falls in love with Lin Pingzhi later and marries him. However, she eventually learns that she is actually a pawn in a struggle for power between her husband and father. Lin Pingzhi kills her after she refuses to follow him to join Zuo Lengshan. When dying, she pleas with Linghu Chong of sparing her husband's life, not knowing that death would have ended his pain and suffering. * Lin Pingzhi () is Lin Zhennan's son and the sole survivor of the Lin family, who was massacred by the Qingcheng Sect. Yue Buqun saves him, takes him in as an apprentice, and arranges for a marriage between him and Yue Lingshan. Driven by hatred and resentment after discovering Yue Buqun's ulterior motives, he becomes increasingly vicious and brutally kills his family's murderers in revenge but is blinded by Mu Gaofeng. He eventually becomes paraplegic after his final battle with Linghu Chong and is imprisoned in an underground dungeon by him, who agreed to Yue Lingshan's dying wish to spare her husband's life. However, by the ending, Lin is driven insane by his plight. * Lao Denuo (), nicknamed \\"Old Man Sa\\" (Ëñ©ËÄÅÈ†≠), is Yue Buqun's second apprentice. He is actually a spy sent by Zuo Lengshan to steal the 'Violet Mist Divine Skill' manual from Yue Buqun. He murders Lu Dayou. After Zuo Lengshan's death, he attempts to learn the Bixie Swordplay on his own but fails and ends up losing all his inner energy. * Liang Fa () is Yue Buqun's third apprentice. He is killed by the masked assailants who attacked the Mount Hua Sect's members in a temple. * Shi Daizi () is Yue Buqun's fourth apprentice. * Gao Genming () is Yue Buqun's fifth apprentice. * Lu Dayou () is Yue Buqun's sixth apprentice. He is nicknamed \\"Sixth Monkey\\" (ÂÖ≠Áå¥ÂÖí) for his monkey-like behaviour and affinity with primates. He is very close to Linghu Chong and even once stole their master's 'Violet Mist Divine Skill' manual to help his senior recover from his injuries.

Evidence does not support an effect on weight beyond a couple of months and does not appear to affect obesity-related problems. In the United States, liposuction is the most common cosmetic surgery. The procedure may be performed under general, regional, or local anesthesia. It involves using a cannula and negative pressure to suck out fat. As a cosmetic procedure it is believed to work best on people with a normal weight and good skin elasticity. While the suctioned fat cells are permanently gone, after a few months overall body fat generally returns to the same level as before treatment. This is despite maintaining the previous diet and exercise regimen. While the fat returns somewhat to the treated area, most of the increased fat occurs in the abdominal area. Visceral fat ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†the fat surrounding the internal organs ‚Å†‚Äî ‚Å†increases, and this condition has been linked to life- shortening diseases such as diabetes, stroke, and heart attack.

After a few months fat typically returns and redistributes. Liposuction does not help obesity related metabolic disorders like insulin resistance.  Reconstructive, Medically Necessary Liposuction  There are many articles and references to liposuction as \\"cosmetic\\" and not reimbursed by medical insurance companies. Most of this information is outdated. If the documentation supports the liposuction for a medical reason (lipedema, lymphedema, lipomas) as reconstructive, and not investigational, experimental, or unproven, the claim is medically necessary and should be reimbursed.https://www.anthem.com/dam/medpolicies/abc/active/policies/mp_pw_a050277.html While most insurance companies may initially deny the claim, many can be won upon appeal if the documentation and patient's need supports the criteria for reconstructive surgery. https://www.cms.gov/medicare-coverage- database/details/lcd- details.aspx?LCDId=34698&ContrId;=268&ver;=28&ContrVer;=1&CntrctrSelected;=268*1&Cntrctr;=268&s;=5&DocType;=1&bc;=AAAAAAIAAAAA&https://downloads.cms.gov/medicare- coverage- database/lcd_attachments/34698_20/L34698_GSURG032_BCG.pdfhttps://www.novitas- solutions.com/webcenter/portal/MedicareJL/pagebyid?contentId=00099545 The techniques and terms listed below: tumescent, lymph-sparing, Tumescent Local Anesthesia (TLA), Water-Assisted Liposuction (WAL), Power-Assisted Liposuction (PAL), Laser-Assisted Liposuction (LAL) all apply to reconstructive, medically necessary liposuction. http://www.intechopen.com/books/advanced-techniques-in- liposuction-and-fat-transfer Rubio, Alethia. (2015). Liposuction: Where are we and were are we going?. Anaplastology.  Techniques  Liposuction aspirate In general, fat is removed via a cannula (a hollow tube) and aspirator (a suction device). Liposuction techniques can be categorized by the amount of fluid injected, and by the mechanism by which the cannula works. If the removed fat is used as filler for the face, lips, or breasts knowledge of the precise technique used to remove the fat is indicated.https://www.plasticsurgery.org/cosmetic-procedures/fat-transfer- breast-augmentation# There are numerous types of liposuction. Some can be described as techniques or modalities. Often surgeons will use two or more of the different techniques below in the same session.  Suction-assisted liposuction (SAL)  This is the most generic term for liposuction. In the CPT‚Ñ¢ manual it is referred to as \\"suction-assisted lipectomy\\" and includes codes: 15876-15879.AMA CPT Manual 2020 Edition  Micro-Cannula  This does not address a particular technique but the diameter of the cannula, a stainless steel tube which is inserted into subcutaneous fat through a small opening or incision in the skin. The outside diameter of micro-cannulas range from 1 mm to 3 mm.Wollina, Uwe & Goldman, Alberto & Heinig, Birgit. (2010). Microcannular tumescent liposuction in advanced lipedema and Dercum's disease. Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societ√† italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia. 145. 151-9.  Lymph-Sparing Liposuction  This technique does not require a particular wand and is most often performed with either tumescent liposuction or WAL (below). It refers to the specific surgical technique, the skill of the surgeon, and the extensive training that is unique to removing lipedema fat.van de Pas, C. B., Boonen, R. S., Stevens, S., Willemsen, S., Valkema, R., & Neumann, M. (2020). Does tumescent liposuction damage the lymph vessels in lipoedema patients? Phlebology, 35(4), 231‚Äì236. https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355519885217 Because the scope is different for removal of lipedema fat versus cosmetic contouring, if lymph-sparing is not addressed in the surgical operative notes, a medical necessity review committee could determine that the procedure poses ‚Äúa risk to the lymph system.‚ÄùLeopoldo Cobos, MD, Karen Herbst, PhD, MD, Christopher Ussery, MS, CSCS, MON-116 Liposuction for Lipedema (Persistent Fat) in the US Improves Quality of Life, Journal of the Endocrine Society, Volume 3, Issue Supplement_1, April-May 2019, MON‚Äì116,Sandhofer M, Hanke CW, Habbema L, et al.

Dermatol Surg. 2020;46(2):220‚Äê228. doi:10.1097/DSS.0000000000002019 Tumescent Local Anesthesia (TLA) / Tumescent Liposuction  This may be referenced either way above, but the technique is the same.Schmeller W, Meier-Vollrath I. Tumescent liposuction: a new and successful therapy for lipedema. J Cutan Med Surg. 2006;10(1):7-10. doi:10.1007/7140.2006.00006 This is an anesthesia technique recommended for lymph-sparing liposuction surgery. Tumescent Liposuction refers to the use of anesthesia during liposuction. The word ‚Äútumescent‚Äù means swollen and firm. By injecting a large volume of very dilute lidocaine (local anesthetic) and epinephrine (capillary constrictor) into subcutaneous fat, the targeted tissue becomes swollen and firm, or tumescent. This technique does not require a special or specific type of wand.Wollina, Uwe & Goldman, Alberto & Heinig, Birgit. (2010). Microcannular tumescent liposuction in advanced lipedema and Dercum's disease. Giornale italiano di dermatologia e venereologia : organo ufficiale, Societ√† italiana di dermatologia e sifilografia. 145. 151-9. van de Pas, C. B., Boonen, R.

Phlebology, 35(4), 231‚Äì236. https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355519885217  Power-assisted liposuction (PAL‚Ñ¢)  Referred to as \\"a vibrating cannula\\" in research studies, PAL uses a specific type of wand that creates an up and down, vibrating-like motion of the cannula to acquire greater fat removal. When compared to simple suction- assisted liposuction, PAL requires less energy for the surgeon to operate while also resulting in greater fat removal. It is commonly used for difficult, secondary, scarred areas, and when harvesting large volumes of fat for transfers to other areas.Venkataram J. Tumescent liposuction: a review. J Cutan Aesthet Surg. 2008;1(2):49-57. doi:10.4103/0974-2077.44159 Note that techniques can be combined; for instance one could refer to the procedure as \\"lymph-sparing, tumescent liposuction using a vibrating (PAL‚Ñ¢) microcannula to treat lipedema.\\"  Water-Jet Assisted Liposuction (WAL‚Ñ¢)  A specific technique and wand commonly used for patients who require lymph-sparing liposuction for lipedema. The lipedema fat is removed using a fan-shaped jet of water, which includes the anesthetic. In contrast to tumescent liposuction above, where the anesthetic solution is injected separately and beforehand, the WAL wand both injects the solution and suctions the fat. BodyJet‚Ñ¢ is a Water-Assisted Liposuction system.Stutz JJ, Krahl D. Water jet-assisted liposuction for patients with lipoedema: histologic and immunohistologic analysis of the aspirates of 30 lipoedema patients. Aesthetic Plast Surg. 2009;33(2):153-162. doi:10.1007/s00266-008-9214-y  Fibro-Lympho-Lipo- Aspiration (FLLA)  This rare and unique term for liposuction for lipedema is used in a specific paper by Campisi, Fibro-Lipo-Lymph-Aspiration With a Lymph Vessel Sparing Procedure to Treat Advanced Lymphedema After Multiple Lymphatic-Venous Anastomoses: The Complete Treatment Protocol. This term emphasizes the uniqueness of the reconstructive procedure versus the cosmetic procedure. Everything about the surgical suction application via cannula is different from standard suction lipectomy. The goal of FLLA is to relieve symptoms such as pain, ameliorate disability, improve function and quality of life, and halt disease progression. Only small blunt cannulas are used, great care is used to not injure lymphatic which are already abnormal and increased risk of injury. Only the longitudinal orientation of cannulas is used at critical junctures. Preoperatively critical lymphatic structures are scanned and marked. FLLA surgery is significantly more time-consuming than cosmetic surgery often requiring 4-5 hours per body part; much larger aspirate volume is removed versus cosmetic suction lipectomy. The benefit to lymphatics function comes not only from the removal of subcutaneous adipose tissue, but also the all components of the loose connective tissue including removing fibrosis in the interstitial space.Campisi CC, Ryan M, Boccardo F, Campisi C. Fibro-Lipo-Lymph-Aspiration With a Lymph Vessel Sparing Procedure to Treat Advanced Lymphedema After Multiple Lymphatic-Venous Anastomoses: The Complete Treatment Protocol. Ann Plast Surg. 2017;78(2):184-190. doi: 110.1097/SAP.0000000000000853.  Ultrasound-assisted liposuction (UAL)  Ultrasound-assisted liposuction techniques used in the 1980s and 1990s were associated with cases of tissue damage, usually from excessive exposure to ultrasound energy. Third-generation UAL devices address this problem by using pulsed energy delivery and a specialized probe that allows physicians to safely remove excess fat. UAL is beneficial in people with a particular skin tone, in liposuction of areas that are more difficult to remove fat, that include treatment of gynecomastia, or areas where secondary liposuction is being performed.  Laser-Assisted Liposuction/lipolysis (LAL)  Referred to as Smart Lipo‚Ñ¢ uses laser technology to coagulate and tighten the skin and boost collagen performance.Lecl√®re FM, Moreno-Moraga J, Mordon S, et al.

AfterCare - Sutures  Doctors disagree on the issues of scarring with not suturing versus resolution of the swelling allowed by leaving the wounds open to drain fluid. Suturing is more common with a large cannula.Venkataram J. Tumescent liposuction: a review. J Cutan Aesthet Surg. 2008;1(2):49-57. doi:10.4103/0974-2077.44159 Since the incisions are small, and the amount of fluid that must drain out is large, some surgeons opt to leave the incisions open, while others suture them only partially, leaving space for the fluid to drain out.MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia: Liposuction Safety and Risks Liposuction is considered very safe, however not all liposuction surgery is equal. Small volume liposuction (<1000 cc) done awake is different from large volume liposuction (>5000 cc, in some cases 10,000 cc) done with anesthesia and a hospital stay.Haeck, Phillip C.

Their conclusion was that: Liposuction by board-certified plastic surgeons is safe, with a low risk of life-threatening complications. Traditional liposuction volume thresholds do not accurately convey individualized risk. The authors' risk assessment model demonstrates that volumes in excess of 100 ml per unit of body mass index confer an increased risk of complications.Chow I, Alghoul MS, Khavanin N, et al.

Plast Reconstr Surg. 2015;136(3):474-483. doi:10.1097/PRS.0000000000001498 There exists a spectrum of complications that may occur due to any liposuction. Risk is increased when treated areas cover a greater percentage of the body, incisions are numerous, a large amount of tissue is removed, and concurrent surgeries are done at the same time. To address safety issues, the American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) published in 2009 Evidence-Based Patient Safety Advisory: Liposuction This 17-page document addresses key safety issues and offers recommendations.https://www.plasticsurgery.org/for-medical- professionals/advocacy/key-issues/liposuction In addition, the increase in tumescent and lymph-sparing techniques have had a positive impact on diminishing complications.

Phlebology, 35(4), 231‚Äì236. https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355519885217 Some side effects and complications include, but are not limited to, the following: *Pain, which may be temporary or chronic *Post-liposuction fat redistribution or post liposuction weight gain *Bruising *Infections *Embolisms may occur when loosened fat enters the blood through blood vessels ruptured during liposuction. Pieces of fat can wind up in the lungs, or even the brain. Fat emboli may cause permanent disability or, in some cases, be fatal. *Puncture wounds in the organs (visceral perforations) may require surgery for repair. They can also prove fatal. *Seroma is a pooling of serum, the straw-colored liquid from blood, in areas where tissue has been removed. *Paresthesias (changes in sensation that may be caused by nerve compression) is an altered sensation at the site of the liposuction. This may either be in the form of an increased sensitivity (pain), or numbness in the area. In some cases, these changes in sensation may be permanent, although typical patients recover over the span of several weeks. *Swelling, in some cases, may persist for weeks or months after liposuction. *Skin necrosis occurs when the skin above the liposuction site changes color and falls off. Large areas of skin necrosis may become infected with bacteria or microorganisms. *Burns can occur during ultrasound-assisted liposuction if the ultrasound probe becomes hot. *Fluid imbalance may impact you after you go home. The condition can result in serious ailments such as heart problems, excess fluid collecting in the lungs, or kidney problems. *Toxicity from anesthesia due to the use of lidocaine, a skin-numbing drug, can cause lightheadedness, restlessness, drowsiness, a ringing in the ears, slurred speech, a metallic taste in the mouth, numbness of the lips and tongue, shivering, muscle twitching and convulsions. Lidocaine usage has already been linked to deaths from liposuction. *Scars at the site of the incision are usually small and fade with time, although some may be larger or more prominent. *Deformities in the shape of the body may occur at the liposuction site after the procedure for about 20% of patients. *Death Serious complications include deep vein thrombosis, organ perforation, bleeding, and infection. Death occurs in about one per ten thousand cases. History In 1977, Fischer and Fischer reviewed 245 cases with the planotome instrument for treating cellulite in the lateral trochanteric (hip-thigh) areas. There was a 4.9 per cent incidence of seromas, despite incision-wound suction catheters and compression dressings; 2.0 per cent of the cases presented pseudo-cyst formation that required removal of the capsule (cyst) through a wider incision (+ 5.0 mm) and the use of the panotome.Schiffman, p. 3. Relatively modern techniques for body contouring and removal of fat were first performed by a French surgeon, Charles Dujarier, but a 1926 case that resulted in the amputation of the leg of a French dancer due to excessive tissue removal and too-tight suturing set back interest in body contouring for decades. Liposuction evolved from work in the late 1960s from surgeons in Europe using techniques to cut away fat, which were limited to regions without many blood vessels due to the amount of bleeding the technique caused. In the mid-1970s Arpad and Giorgio Fischer created the technique of using a blunt cannula linked to suction; they used it only to remove fat on the outer thighs. Yves-G√©rard Illouz and Fournier extended the Fischers' work to the whole body, which they were able to use by using different sized cannulae. Illouz later developed the \\"wet\\" technique in which the fat tissue was injected with saline and hyaluronidase, which helped dissolve tissue holding the fat, prior to suctioning. Lidocaine was also added as a local anesthetic. Fournier also advocated using compression after the operation, and travelled and lectured to spread the technique. The Europeans had performed the procedures under general anesthesia; in the 1980s American dermatologists pioneered techniques allowing only local anesthetics to be used. Jeffrey Klein published a method that became known as \\"tumescent\\" in which a large volume of very dilute lidocaine, along with epinephrine to help control bleeding via vasoconstriction, and sodium bicarbonate as a buffering agent. In 2015 liposuction surpassed breast augmentation surgery as the most commonly performed cosmetic procedure in the US.

It was written by Jimmy Perry and David Croft, and broadcast on the BBC from 1968 to 1977. The sitcom ran for nine series and 80 episodes in total; there was also a radio version based on the television scripts, a feature film and a stage show. The series regularly gained audiences of 18 million viewers, and is still repeated worldwide. The Home Guard consisted of local volunteers otherwise ineligible for military service, either because of age (hence the title Dad's Army) or by being in professions exempt from conscription. Dad's Army deals almost exclusively with men over military age, and featured older British actors, including Arnold Ridley, John Laurie, Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier. Younger members of the cast included Ian Lavender, Clive Dunn (who played the oldest guardsman, Lance Corporal Jones, despite being one of the younger cast members), and James Beck (who died suddenly during production of the sixth series in 1973). Other regular cast members included Frank Williams as the vicar, and Bill Pertwee as the chief ARP warden. In 2004, Dad's Army came fourth in a BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom. It had been placed 13th in a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals.British Film Institute TV100 URL accessed 4 June 2006 The series has influenced British popular culture, with its catchphrases and characters being well known. The Radio Times magazine listed Captain Mainwaring‚Äôs ‚ÄúYou stupid boy!\\" among the 25 greatest put-downs on TV. A 2001 Channel 4 poll ranked Captain Mainwaring 21st on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. A second feature film of Dad's Army with a different cast was released in 2016. In 2019 UKTV recreated three missing episodes for broadcast in August that year on its Gold channel under the title Dad's Army: The Lost Episodes starring Kevin McNally and Robert Bathurst as Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson. Origins Originally intended to be called The Fighting Tigers, Dad's Army was based partly on co-writer and creator Jimmy Perry's experiences in the Local Defence Volunteers (LDV, later known as the Home Guard) and highlighted a somewhat forgotten aspect of defence during the Second World War. Perry was only 17 years old when he joined the 10th Hertfordshire Battalion. His mother did not like him being out at night, and feared he might catch cold; he partly resembled the character of Private Pike. An elderly lance corporal in the 10th Hertfordshire often referred to fighting under Kitchener against the \\"Fuzzy Wuzzies\\" (Hadendoa), and was the model for Corporal Jones. Other influences included the work of comedians such as Will Hay, whose film Oh, Mr Porter! featured a pompous ass, an old man and a young man; together, this gave Perry the ideas for Mainwaring, Godfrey and Pike. Film historian Jeffrey Richards has cited Lancastrian comedian Robb Wilton as a key influence; he portrayed a work-shy husband who joined the Home Guard in numerous comic sketches during WW2. Perry wrote the first script and gave it to David Croft while working as a minor actor in the Croft-produced sitcom Hugh and I, originally intending the role of the spiv, later called Walker, to be his own. Croft was impressed and sent the script to Michael Mills, the BBC's Head of Comedy and the series was commissioned. In his book Dad's Army, Graham McCann explains that the show owes much to Michael Mills. It was he who renamed the show Dad's Army. He did not like Brightsea-on-Sea, so the location was changed to Walmington-on-Sea. He was happy with the names for the characters Mainwaring, Godfrey and Pike, but not with other names, and he made suggestions: Private Jim Duck became Frazer, Joe Fish became Joe Walker and Jim Jones became Jack Jones. He also suggested adding a Scot. Jimmy Perry had produced the original idea but needed an experienced man to see it through. Mills suggested David Croft, and so their partnership began. When an episode was shown to members of the public to gauge audience reaction prior to broadcast of the first series, the majority of the audience thought it was very poor. The production team put the report containing the negative comments at the bottom of David Croft's in-tray. He only saw it several months later,Last Word, BBC Radio 4, 30 September 2011 ‚Äì in an obituary for David Croft, quoted by Jimmy Perry. after the series had been broadcast and had received great acclaim. Situation The show is set in the fictional seaside town of Walmington-on-Sea, on the south coast of England. The exterior scenes were mostly filmed in and around the Stanford Training Area [STANTA], near Thetford, Norfolk.Thetford tourist website discussing the reasons for shooting in Norfolk. Retrieved 5 June 2006 Walmington, and its Home Guard platoon, would be on the front line in the event of a German invasion across the English Channel. The first series has a loose narrative thread, with Captain Mainwaring's platoon being formed and equipped, initially with wooden guns and LDV armbands, later on with full army uniforms; the platoon is part of the Queen's Own Royal West Kent Regiment. The first episode, \\"The Man and the Hour\\", begins with a scene set in the \\"present day\\" of 1968, in which Mainwaring addresses his old platoon as part of the contemporary '\\"I'm Backing Britain\\" campaign. The prologue opening was a condition imposed after initial concerns from Paul Fox, the BBC1 controller, that it belittled the efforts of the Home Guard.Clark, Anthony. \\"Dad‚Äôs Army\\" at BFI Screen online. Retrieved 4 June 2006. After Mainwaring relates how he had backed Britain in 1940, the episode proper begins; Dad's Army is thus told in flashback, although the final episode does not return to 1968. Later episodes are largely self- contained, albeit referring to previous events and with additional character development. As the comedy in many ways relies on the platoon's lack of participation in the Second World War, opposition to their activities has to come from another quarter and this is generally provided by Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Warden Hodges, and sometimes by the verger of the local church (St Aldhelm's) or by Captain Square and the neighbouring Eastgate Home Guard platoon. The group does have some encounters related to the enemy, such as downed German planes, a Luftwaffe pilot who parachutes into the town's clock tower, a U-boat crew and discarded parachutes that may have been German; a Viennese ornithologist appears in \\"Man Hunt\\" and IRA suspects appear in \\"Absent Friends\\". The humour ranges from the subtle (especially the class- reversed relationship between grammar school-educated Mainwaring, the local bank manager, and public school-educated Wilson, his deputy at the bank) to the slapstick (the antics of the elderly Jones being a prime example). Jones had several catchphrases, including \\"Don't panic!\\" (while panicking himself), \\"They don't like it up 'em\\", \\"Permission to speak, sir?\\" and talk about the \\"Fuzzy-Wuzzies\\". Mainwaring says \\"You stupid boy\\" to Pike in many episodes. The early series occasionally include darker humour, reflecting that, especially early in the war, the Home Guard was woefully under-equipped but was still willing to have a crack at the Wehrmacht. For instance, in the episode \\"The Battle of Godfrey's Cottage\\", the platoon believes the enemy has invaded Britain. Mainwaring, Godfrey, Frazer and Jones (along with Godfrey's sisters, who are completely unaware of the invasion) decide to stay at the cottage to delay the German advance, buying the regular army time to arrive with reinforcements; \\"It'll probably be the end of us, but we're ready for that, aren't we, men?\\", says Mainwaring. \\"Of course\\", replies Frazer.

He had been a lieutenant in the First World War, but is embarrassed by the fact that he never saw combat, being sent to France only in 1919 after the Armistice and then part of the Army of Occupation in Germany. * Sergeant Arthur Wilson (John Le Mesurier), a diffident, upper-middle-class Chief Bank Clerk who would quietly question Mainwaring's judgement (\\"Do you think that's wise, sir?\\"). Wilson had actually served as a Captain during the First World War, but he only reveals this in the final episode. He does not live with the Pike family but is implied to be in a relationship with the widowed Mrs Pike. (On the last day of filming David Croft confirmed to Lavender that Uncle Arthur was his father). * Lance Corporal Jack Jones (Clive Dunn), the local butcher, born in 1870. Jones was an old campaigner who enlisted as a drummer boy at the age of 14 and participated, as a boy soldier, in the Gordon Relief Expedition of 1884‚Äì85 and, as a man soldier, in Kitchener's campaign in the Sudan in 1896‚Äì98. Jones also served during the Boer War and the Great War. He often suffers from the effects of malaria caught during one of his campaigns, and has to be calmed during his \\"shudders\\". Often seen as fastidious and old, he is the world's worst worrier and has a catch phrase of \\"They don't like it up em!\\" when referencing any potential Nazi attack. Dunn was considerably younger than his character, being only 48 at the start of filming. This allowed him to take part in some of the more physical comedy of the show. * Private James Frazer (John Laurie), a dour Scottish undertaker and a former Chief Petty Officer on HMS Defiant in the Royal Navy. He served at the Battle of Jutland as a ship's cook and also has a medal for having served on Shackleton's Antarctic expedition. He grew up on the Isle of Barra. His catchphrase was \\"We're doomed. Doomed!\\" * Private Joe Walker (James Beck), a black market spiv, Walker was one of only two able-bodied men of military age in Walmington-on-Sea's Home Guard (the other being Private Pike). In the first episode, Walker claimed he was not called up to the regular army because he was in a reserved occupation as a wholesale supplier. In one of the missing episodes, it was revealed that he wasn't called up because of an allergy to corned beef. Following Beck's death in 1973, during series 6, Walker was omitted from the remaining series. * Private Charles Godfrey (Arnold Ridley), a retired shop assistant who had worked at the Army & Navy Store in London. He lives in Walmington with his elderly sisters and serves as the platoon's medical orderly. He often gets \\"caught short\\" and needs to \\"be excused\\". A conscientious objector during the First World War, he was nevertheless awarded the Military Medal for heroic actions as a combat medic during the Battle of the Somme. He also demonstrated bravery during his Home Guard service particularly during the \\"Branded\\" episode where Mainwaring, seemingly unconscious in a smoke-filled room, is rescued by Godfrey. * Private Frank Pike (Ian Lavender), the youngest of the platoon, a cosseted, somewhat immature mother's boy, often wearing a thick scarf over his uniform to prevent illness and a frequent target for Mainwaring's derision (\\"You stupid boy!\\"). Pike is not called up to the regular army due to his rare blood group (in series 8 he is called up but excused for this reason). He works for Mainwaring in his day job as an assistant bank clerk. He frequently addresses Sergeant Wilson as \\"Uncle Arthur\\". Supporting characters * ARP Chief Warden William Hodges (Bill Pertwee), the platoon's major rival and nemesis. Mainwaring looks down on him as the local greengrocer and dislikes that Hodges saw active service in the Great War. As an Air Raid Precautions (ARP) Warden, he is always demanding that people \\"put that light out\\". * The Reverend Timothy Farthing (Frank Williams), the effete, huffy vicar of St Aldhelm's Church. He reluctantly shares his church hall and office with Mainwaring's platoon. * Maurice Yeatman (Edward Sinclair), the verger at St Aldhelm's Church and Scoutmaster of the local Sea Scout troop. He is often hostile to the platoon while frequently sycophantic to the vicar, who often struggles to tolerate him. * Mrs Mavis Pike (Janet Davies), Pike's overbearing widowed mother, who is often implied to be in a relationship with Sergeant Wilson. * Mrs Fox (Pamela Cundell), a glamorous widow. There is a mutual attraction with Corporal Jones and the couple marry in the last episode. Illicit little \\"extras\\" are passed across the counter on her regular visits to Jones's butchers shop and she helps the platoon with official functions. In the episode \\"Mum's Army\\", she gives her Christian name as Marcia, but by the final episode she has become Mildred. * Private Sponge (Colin Bean), a sheep farmer. He led the members of the platoon's second section (the first section being led by Corporal Jones) and thus had only occasional speaking parts, although his character became more prominent in later series. He appeared in 76 of the 80 episodes. * Private Cheeseman (Talfryn Thomas), a Welshman who works for the town newspaper. He joined the Walmington-on-Sea platoon during the seventh series after the sudden death of James Beck, who played Private Walker. * Captain Square (Geoffrey Lumsden), the pompous commanding officer of the rival Eastgate Platoon, and a former soldier who served with Lawrence of Arabia during the Great War. He is frequently at loggerheads with Mainwaring (whose name he persists in mispronouncing as spelt, \\"Main-wearing\\", instead of the correct \\"Mannering\\") and has the catchphrase, \\"You blithering idiot!\\" * Mrs Yeatman (Olive Mercer), the somewhat tyrannical wife of Maurice Yeatman, the verger. Over the course of the series, she was named as Beryl, Anthea and Tracey. * Mr Sidney Bluett (Harold Bennett), an elderly local man who is occasionally involved with the antics of both the platoon and Hodges. He and Mrs Yeatman are implied to be having an affair. * Edith Parish (also called Shirley) (Wendy Richard), a cinema usherette and girlfriend of Private Walker. * Dolly (Amy Dalby and Joan Cooper) and Cissy Godfrey (Nan Braunton and Kathleen Saintsbury), Private Godfrey's spinster sisters, who reside with him at their cottage. * Elizabeth Mainwaring (Unseen character), Mainwaring's reclusive, paranoid and domineering wife who is never seen on-screen. Her marriage with Mainwaring is not a happy one and Mainwaring does his best to avoid her at any opportunity. The marriage is childless. Other actors who appeared in small roles include Timothy Carlton, Nigel Hawthorne, Geoffrey Hughes, Fulton Mackay, Anthony Sharp, Carmen Silvera, Caroline Dowdeswell, Don Estelle, Michael Knowles and Barbara Windsor. Larry Martyn appeared as an unnamed Private in four episodes, and later took over the part of Walker in the radio series following the death of James Beck. The former cricketer Fred Trueman appeared in \\"The Test\\". Opening and closing credits The show's opening titles were originally intended to feature footage of refugees and Nazi troops, to illustrate the threat faced by the Home Guard. Despite opposition from the BBC's Head of Comedy Michael Mills, Paul Fox, the controller of BBC 1, ordered that these be removed on the grounds that they were offensive. The replacement titles featured the now familiar animated sequence of swastika-headed arrows approaching Britain. The opening titles were updated twice; firstly in Series 3, adding colour and noticeably better animation and then again in Series 6, which made some slight tweaks to the animation. There were two different versions of the closing credits for the show. The first version, used in Series 1 and 2, simply showed footage of the main cast superimposed over a still photograph, with the crew credits rolling over a black background. The more familiar closing credits, introduced in Series 3, were a homage to the end credits of the film The Way Ahead (1944) which had covered the training of a platoon during the war. In both instances, each character is shown as they walk across a smoke-filled battlefield. One of the actors in Dad's Army, John Laurie, also appeared in that film and his performance in the end credits of The Way Ahead appears to be copied in the sitcom. Coincidentally, the film's lead character (played by David Niven) is named Lieutenant Jim Perry. Music The show's theme tune, \\"Who do you think you are kidding, Mr Hitler?\\" was Jimmy Perry's idea, intended as a gentle pastiche of wartime songs. It was the only pastiche in the series, as the other music used was contemporary to the 1940s. Perry wrote the lyrics himself and composed the music with Derek Taverner. Perry persuaded one of his childhood idols, wartime entertainer Bud Flanagan, to sing the theme for 100 guineas (). Flanagan died less than a year after the recording. At the time it was widely believed to be a wartime song. The version played over the opening credits differs slightly from the full version recorded by Flanagan; an edit removes, for timing reasons, two lines of lyric with the \\"middle eight\\" tune: \\"So watch out Mr Hitler, you have met your match in us/If you think you can crush us, we're afraid you've missed the bus.\\" Bud Flanagan's full version appears as an Easter egg on the first series DVD release and on the authorised soundtrack CD issued by CD41.Vinyl record: On the Air: 60 Years of BBC Theme Music, BBC Enterprises 1982 (track 4). The Dad's Army title sequences and theme are viewable in RealPlayer at TV-Ark Arthur Lowe also recorded a full version of the theme.Article about the recording by David Noades Dadsarmy.tv, accessed 14 August 2006 The music over the opening credits was recorded at Riverside Studios, Bud Flanagan being accompanied by the Orchestra of the Band of the Coldstream Guards. The closing credits feature an instrumental march version of the song played by the Band of the Coldstream Guards conducted by Captain (later Lieutenant Colonel) Trevor L. Sharpe, ending with the air-raid warning siren sounding all-clear. It is accompanied by a style of credits that became a trademark of David Croft: the caption \\"You have been watching\\", followed by vignettes of the main cast. The series also contains genuine wartime and period songs between scenes, usually brief quotations that have some reference to the theme of the episode or the scene. Many appear on the CD soundtrack issued by CD41, being the same versions used in the series. TV episodes The television series lasted nine series and was broadcast over nine years, with 80 episodes in total, including three Christmas specials and an hour-long special. At its peak, the programme regularly gained audiences of 18.5 million.Museum of Broadcast History website, URL accessed 4 June 2006 There were also four short specials broadcast as part of Christmas Night with the Stars in 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1972. Missing episodes The first two series were recorded and screened in black and white, while Series 3 to 9 were recorded and screened in colour. Even so, one episode in Series 3, Room at the Bottom, formerly only survived in black and white and remains on the official DVDs in this form. This episode has benefited from colour recovery technology, using a buried colour signal (chroma dots) in the black-and-white telerecording to restore the episode back to colour and was transmitted on 13 December 2008 on BBC Two. Dad's Army was less affected than most from the wiping of videotape, but three second-series episodes remain missing: episode 9 \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker\\", episode 11 \\"A Stripe for Frazer\\" and episode 12 \\"Under Fire\\". (All three missing episodes were among those remade for BBC Radio with most of the original cast, adapted from the original TV scripts. Audio recordings of all three were included as bonus features on The Complete Series DVD collection.) Two further series 2 episodes were believed lost until 2001. Two of the three missing episodes have since been performed as part of the latest stage show. In 2008, soundtracks of the missing episode \\"A Stripe for Frazer\\" and the 1968 Christmas Special \\"Present Arms\\" were recovered. The soundtrack of \\"A Stripe for Frazer\\" has been mixed with animation to replace the missing images. The Audio soundtrack for the 1970 Christmas Special \\"Cornish Floral Dance\\" has also been recovered. =Dad's Army: The Lost Episodes (2019)= In 2018, UKTV announced plans to recreate the three missing episodes for broadcast on its Gold channel. Mercury Productions, the company responsible for Saluting Dad's Army, Gold's 50th anniversary tribute series, produced the episodes, which were directed by Ben Kellett. The recreations were broadcast in August 2019, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of their original broadcast on the BBC. Kevin McNally and Robert Bathurst were the initial casting announcements as Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson, with Bernard Cribbins portraying Private Godfrey. The full cast was announced in January 2019, with McNally, Bathurst and Cribbins joined by Kevin Eldon, Mathew Horne, David Hayman and Tom Rosenthal. However, Bernard Cribbins subsequently withdrew from the project, and was replaced as Godfrey by Timothy West. =Cast= * Kevin McNally ‚Äì Captain Mainwaring * Robert Bathurst ‚Äì Sergeant Wilson * Kevin Eldon ‚Äì Lance Corporal Jones * David Hayman ‚Äì Private Frazer * Mathew Horne ‚Äì Private Walker * Timothy West ‚Äì Private Godfrey * Tom Rosenthal ‚Äì Private Pike * Tracy-Ann Oberman as Mrs Pike * Simon Ludders as ARP Warden Hodges * David Horovitch as Corporal-Colonel Square * John Biggins as the Verger, who only appeared in one of the 3 episodes Films=1971 film In 1971, in common with many British sitcoms of that era, Dad's Army was made into a feature film. Backers Columbia Pictures imposed arbitrary changes, such as recasting Liz Fraser as Mavis Pike and filming outdoors in Chalfont St Giles, Buckinghamshire rather than Thetford in Norfolk, which made the cast unhappy. The director, Norman Cohen, whose idea it was to make the film, was nearly sacked by the studio. Jimmy Perry and David Croft wrote the original screenplay. This was expanded by Cohen to try to make it more cinematic; Columbia executives made more changes to plot and pacing. As finally realised, two-thirds of the film consists of the creation of the platoon ‚Äî this was the contribution of Perry and Croft, and differs in a number of ways from the formation of the platoon as seen in the first series of the television version ‚Äî and the final third shows the platoon in action, rescuing hostages from the church hall where they had been held captive by the crewmen of a downed German aircraft. Neither the cast nor Perry and Croft were happy with the result. Perry argued for changes to try to reproduce the style of the television series, but with mixed results. Filming took place from 10 August to 25 September 1970 at Shepperton Studios and other locations. After shooting the film, the cast returned to working on the fourth television series. The film's UK premi√®re was on 12 March 1971 at the Columbia Theatre, London. Critical reviews were mixed, but it performed well at the UK box office. Discussions were held about a possible sequel, to be called Dad's Army and the Secret U-Boat Base, but the project never came to fruition. Michael Gambon as Private Godfrey (2014) 2016 film A second film was released in 2016, written by Hamish McColl and directed by Oliver Parker and featuring Toby Jones as Captain Mainwaring, Bill Nighy as Sergeant Wilson, Tom Courtenay as Lance Corporal Jones, Michael Gambon as Private Godfrey, Blake Harrison as Private Pike, Daniel Mays as Private Walker and Bill Paterson as Private Frazer. The cast also includes Catherine Zeta-Jones, Sarah Lancashire and Mark Gatiss. The film was mostly made on location in Yorkshire. Filming took place on the beach at North Landing, Flamborough Head, Yorkshire and at nearby Bridlington. It opened in February 2016 to mainly negative reviews.Gambon and Courtenay to star in Dad's Army film, BBC News, 8 October 2014 Stage show A poster advertising the stage show In 1975 Dad's Army transferred to the stage as a revue, with songs, familiar scenes from the show and individual \\"turns\\" for cast members. It was created by Roger Redfarn, who shared the same agent as the sitcom writers. Most of the principal cast transferred with it, with the exception of John Laurie (he was replaced by Hamish Roughead). Following James Beck's death two years earlier, Walker was played by John Bardon. Dad's Army: A Nostalgic Music and Laughter Show of Britain's Finest Hour opened at Billingham in Teesside on 4 September 1975 for a two-week tryout. After cuts and revisions, the show transferred to London's West End and opened at the Shaftesbury Theatre on 2 October 1975. On the opening night there was a surprise appearance by Chesney Allen, singing the old Flanagan and Allen song Hometown with Arthur Lowe. The show ran in the West End until 21 February 1976, disrupted twice by bomb scares and then toured the country until 4 September 1976. Clive Dunn was replaced for half the tour by Jack Haig (David Croft's original first choice for the role of Corporal Jones on television). Jeffrey Holland, who went on to star in several later Croft sitcoms, also had a number of roles in the production. The stage show, billed as Dad's Army‚ÄîThe Musical, was staged in Australia and toured New Zealand in 2004‚Äì05, starring Jon English. Several sections of this stage show were filmed and have subsequently been included as extras on the final Dad's Army DVD. In April 2007, a new stage show was announced with cast members including Leslie Grantham as Private Walker and Emmerdale actor Peter Martin as Captain Mainwaring. The production contained the episodes \\"A Stripe for Frazer\\", \\"The Loneliness of the Long Distance Walker\\", \\"Room at the Bottom\\" and \\"The Deadly Attachment\\". In August 2017, a new two-man stage show titled, Dad's Army Radio Hour, opened at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe It starred David Benson and Jack Lane. Between them, the pair voiced the entire cast of Dad's Army, including incidental characters. The episodes adapted from the original radio scripts are \\"The Deadly Attachment\\", \\"The Day the Balloon Went Up\\", \\"Brain Versus Brawn\\", \\"My British Buddy\\", \\"Round and Round Went the Great Big Wheel\\" and \\"Mum's Army\\". The current production features three episodes not adapted for the radio series \\"When You've Got to Go\\", \\"My Brother and I\\" and \\"Never Too Old\\". The show was well received critics and the David Croft estate for its respectful and uncanny performances. In 2019, the production changed its name to Dad's Army Radio Show and continues to tour nationally throughout the UK until the end of 2020.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/theatre/what-to-see/just-two-actors-dads- army-radio-hour-straightforward-pleasure Radio series Many of the TV episodes were remade for BBC Radio 4 with the original cast, although other actors played Walker after James Beck's death (which took place soon after recording and before transmission of the first radio series). These radio versions were adapted from the original television scripts by Harold Snoad and Michael Knowles, and featured John Snagge as a newsreader, who set the scene for each episode. Different actors were used for some of the minor parts: for example Mollie Sugden played the role of Mrs Fox, and Pearl Hackney played Mrs Pike. The first episode was based on the revised version of events seen in the opening of the film version, rather than on the TV pilot. The entire radio series has been released on CD.Dad‚Äôs Army.tv page about the radio series, URL accessed 4 June 2006 Knowles and Snoad also developed a radio series, It Sticks Out Half a Mile, which told what happened to some of the Dad's Army characters after the war. It was originally intended to star Arthur Lowe and John Le Mesurier, reprising their Dad's Army roles, but Lowe died after recording the pilot episode in 1981, so Bill Pertwee and Ian Lavender were brought in to replace him. Ironically, if Arthur Lowe had lived the series might never have been made, as the illness from which he suffered towards the end of his career badly affected his voice, which led to an initial decision not to commission it. In the event the revised cast recorded a 13-episode series. This might have led to more episodes and a second series, had it not been for the sudden death of John Le Mesurier in November 1983. The last ever radio recording of Dad's Army occurred in 1995, when Jimmy Perry wrote a radio sketch entitled The Boy Who Saved England for the \\"Full Steam A-Hudd\\" evening broadcast on Radio 2, transmitted on 3 June 1995 on the occasion of the closure of the BBC's Paris studios in Lower Regent Street. It featured Ian Lavender as Pike, Bill Pertwee as Hodges, Frank Williams as the Vicar and Jimmy Perry as General Haverlock-Seabag. Other appearances Lowe, Le Mesurier, Laurie, Beck, Ridley and Lavender (wearing Pike's signature scarf) appeared as guests in a 1971 edition of The Morecambe & Wise Show on BBC2 in the Monty on the Bonty sketch, with Lowe as Captain Bligh and the others as crewmen on HMS Bounty. The cast appeared in a 1974 public information film, in character but set in the modern day, showing how to cross the road safely at Pelican crossings. Lowe, Le Mesurier, Dunn, Lavender and Pertwee, and Jones's van, appeared in character at the finish of the 1974 London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Lowe, Le Mesurier and Laurie again made a cameo appearance as their Dad's Army characters in the 1977 Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special. As Elton John is following incomprehensible instructions to find the BBC studios, he encounters them in a steam room. On leaving, Mainwaring calls him a \\"stupid boy\\".Morecambe and Wise Christmas Special 1977 at IMDb, URL accessed 26 September 2006 A pilot episode for an American remake called The Rear Guard was produced by ABC and broadcast on 10 August 1976, based on the episode \\"The Deadly Attachment\\". However, it failed to make it past the pilot stage.The Rear Guard at IMDb, URL accessed 26 September 2006 Lowe and Le Mesurier made a final appearance in Dad's Army garb for a 1982 television commercial advertising Wispa chocolate bars. Clive Dunn made occasional appearances as Lance Corporal Jones at 1940s themed events in the 1980s and 1990s and on television on the BBC Saturday night entertainment show Noel's House Party on 27 November 1993. Arthur Lowe twice appeared on the BBC children's programme Blue Peter. The first time was with John Le Mesurier, in which the two appeared in costume and in character as Captain Mainwaring and Sergeant Wilson when walking around looking at and discussing a mural which schoolchildren had painted featuring the characters from the show at a Christmas party, among whom was Mainwaring's unseen wife Elizabeth ‚Äì or rather, what the children thought she looked like (Mainwaring remarks \\"Good grief. What a remarkable likeness!\\"). Arthur Lowe made a second appearance as Captain Mainwaring on Blue Peter with the Dad's Army van which would appear in the forthcoming London-Brighton run and showed presenter John Noakes the vehicle's hidden anti-Nazi defences. Awards During its original television run, Dad's Army was nominated for multiple British Academy Television Awards, although only won \\"Best Light Entertainment Production Team\\" in 1971. It was nominated as \\"Best Situation Comedy\\" in 1973, 1974 and 1975. Also, Arthur Lowe was frequently nominated for \\"Best Light Entertainment Performance\\" in 1970, 1971, 1973, 1975 and 1978.List of awards at IMDb, URL accessed 4 June 2006 In 2000, the show was voted 13th in a British Film Institute poll of industry professionals of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes. In 2004, championed by Phill Jupitus, it came fourth in the BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom with 174,138 votes.The final top-ten of Britain‚Äôs Best Sitcom, URL accessed 4 June 2006 Tributes Statue of Captain Mainwaring, erected in Thetford in June 2010 In June 2010, a statue of Captain Mainwaring was erected in the Norfolk town of Thetford where most of the exteriors for the TV series were filmed. The statue features Captain Mainwaring sitting to attention on a simple bench in Home Guard uniform, with his swagger stick across his knees. The statue is mounted at the end of a winding brick pathway with a Union Flag patterned arrowhead to reflect the opening credits of the TV series and the sculpture has been designed so that members of the public can sit beside Captain Mainwaring and have their photograph taken. The statue was vandalised not long after the unveiling by a 10-year-old boy, who kicked it for 10 minutes and broke off the statue's glasses, throwing them into a nearby river. The statue has since been fixed. The British sitcom Goodnight Sweetheart paid tribute to Dad's Army in episode one of its second series in 1995, \\"Don't Get Around Much Any More\\". Here, lead character Gary Sparrow ‚Äì a time-traveller from the 1990s ‚Äì goes into a bank in 1941 and meets a bank manager named Mainwaring and Wilson, his chief clerk, both of whom are in the Home Guard. When he hears the names Mainwaring and Wilson, Gary begins singing the Dad's Army theme song. A brief visual tribute to Dad's Army is made at the start of the episode \\"Rag Week\\" from Ben Elton's 1990s sitcom The Thin Blue Line. In June 2018 the Royal Mail issued a set of 8 stamps, featuring the main characters and their catchphrases, to mark the comedy's 50th anniversary. Cultural influence The characters of Dad's Army and their catchphrases are well known in the UK due to the popularity of the series when originally shown and the frequency of repeats. Jimmy Perry recalls that before writing the sitcom, the Home Guard was a largely forgotten aspect of Britain's defence in the Second World War, something which the series rectified. In a 1972 Radio Times interview, Arthur Lowe expressed surprise at the programme's success: > We expected the show to have limited appeal, to the age group that lived > through the war and the Home Guard. We didn't expect what has happened ‚Äì > that children from the age of five upwards would enjoy it too. The fact that a pub in Shoeburyness has been named (albeit incorrectly) after a main character indicates the programme's popularity. By focusing on the comic aspects of the Home Guard in a cosy south coast setting, the TV series distorted the popular perception of the organisation. Its characters represented the older volunteers within the Home Guard but largely ignored the large numbers of teenagers and factory workers who also served. Accounts from Home Guard members and their regimental publications, inspired Norman Longmate's history The Real Dad's Army (1974). Media releases :Main articles: Dad's Army books and memorabilia, Dad's Army DVD and Video releases and Dad's Army Audio releases. The BBC released two \\"Best of\\" DVD sets in October 2001 and September 2002, but it was not until September 2004 that the full series began to be released, with the first series and the surviving episodes of the second series being released first, along with the documentary Missing Presumed Wiped. By November 2007, the entire series had been released on DVD, with the final edition featuring the specials \\"My Brother and I\\" and \\"The Battle of the Giants\\" along with various other appearances, including several \\"Christmas Night with the Stars\\" sketches and excerpts from the 1976 stage show. The DVDs also include short individual biographical documentaries about the characters and their actors called We Are the Boys. The Columbia film adaptation is separately available; as this is not a BBC production, it is not included in the box set. In 1973 the series was adapted into a comic strip, drawn by Bill Titcombe, which was published in daily newspapers in the UK. These cartoon strips were subsequently collected together and published in book form, by Piccolo Books, in paperback. ‚Äì Piccolo/Pan, London ‚Äì 1973 See also * Dad's Army Appreciation Society * Dad's Army Museum * Bressingham Steam and Gardens * Charles Burrell Museum * Blitz and Pieces (another Dad's Army museum) * Jones's van * The Rear Guard (unsuccessful US adaptation) References ;Notes ;Further reading * Croft, David; Perry, Jimmy; Webber, Richard (2003).

Some of these characters previously appeared in another novel Sword Stained with Royal Blood, which is also written by Jin Yong. Some of these characters are based on historical figures, such as the Kangxi Emperor, Oboi, Wu Sangui, Chen Yuanyuan, Princess Changping, Zheng Keshuang, Feng Xifan, Galdan Boshugtu Khan, Sophia Alekseyevna, Wu Liuqi and Zha Jizuo (a purported ancestor of Jin Yong). Wei Xiaobao and his family * Wei Xiaobao () is the protagonist of the novel. A witty, sly and illiterate person, he was born to a prostitute from a brothel in Yangzhou during the Qing dynasty. He bumbles his way into the imperial palace and has a fateful encounter with the young Kangxi Emperor, with whom he develops a friendship. By sheer luck and wit, Wei succeeds in accomplishing a series of tasks that would affect the events during the Kangxi Emperor's reign. * Wei Chunfang () is Wei Xiaobao's mother and a prostitute from the Lichun Brothel (È∫óÊò•Èô¢) in Yangzhou. The seven wives * Mu Jianping () is Mu Jiansheng's younger sister. Due to a conflict between the Heaven and Earth Society and the House of Prince Mu, she is taken hostage by the Society and placed under Wei Xiaobao's watch and eventually falls in love with him. She is later captured by the Mystic Dragon Cult and forced to join the cult. She is the youngest and most na√Øve of the seven. * Fang Yi () is Liu Dahong's apprentice. She is the most intelligent of the seven. She initially loved her senior, Liu Yizhou, who loved her as well. After a failed attempt to assassinate the Kangxi Emperor, she is wounded and forced to rely on Wei Xiaobao to protect her. Wei Xiaobao uses every opportunity to make advances on her and force her to promise to marry him if he saves Liu Yizhou from captivity. However, after seeing how adamant she is with her feelings for Liu Yizhou, Wei wavers between giving up on her and insisting that she fulfils her promise. Eventually, after learning that Wei is the leader of the Qingmu Lodge of the Heaven and Earth Society, as well as seeing how the jealous and cowardly Liu Yizhou betrayed Wei and sold him out to enemies, she decides that she wants to be with Wei. She is captured by the Mystic Dragon Cult and forced to lure Wei into traps. Wei manages to save her with Su Quan's help. Fang Yi is described to be Wei's smartest wife. * Shuang'er () is a servant of the Zhuang family in Huzhou. The matriarch tells her to follow Wei and serve him ‚Äì as an expression of her gratitude to Wei for helping their family kill Oboi. She becomes Wei's bodyguard. Among the seven, she is the one who understands Wei the most. * Su Quan () was the wife of Hong Antong, the leader of the Mystic Dragon Cult. She disguises herself as a prostitute to lure Wei Xiaobao into a trap in a brothel. However, she is unfamiliar with the ways of a brothel so Wei easily sees through her ruse. He tricks her into drinking drugged wine and she becomes unconscious. Wei Xiaobao then places her on the bed along with Fang Yi, Zeng Rou, Mu Jianping, Shuang'er and Ah Ke, and has sex with them. The next time she and Wei Xiaobao meet, her attitude is warmer, and it is later revealed that she is pregnant with his child. She decides to follow Wei after the Mystic Dragon Cult is destroyed in its internal conflict. She is the most powerful in martial arts among the seven. * Princess Jianning () is a younger sister of the Kangxi Emperor. It turns out that she is not related to the emperor because her biological mother is Mao Dongzhu, who has been impersonating the empress dowager. Her father is actually the Thin Monk. Of the seven wives, she is the most violent, sadistic and spoiled. She loves Wei Xiaobao because he is the only one who dares to stand up to her, and she likes to engage in BDSM activities with him.

Before her wedding, she drugs Wei Xiaobao, strips him naked, whips him and tries to use candles to burn his hair. He gives in to her seductive advances and sleeps with her that night. The next day, Wei gives her one of the pistols he received from Wu Sangui as a gift. Jianning tricks Wu Yingxiong into going into her room, points the pistol at him, and orders him to strip before castrating him.

It was established in 1887, in the Warm Springs Valley northwest of the town of Lake Elsinore, and later incorporated into the City of Lake Elsinore. Coal, along with clay deposits, was found on the site by John D. Huff in the late 1880s, and the Southern California Coal and Clay Company was formed to mine them. The town site of Terra Cotta was laid out and was given a post office on October 26, 1887. In May 1893 its post office was closed and moved to Lake Elsinore. A plant for the manufacture of sewer and water pipes was built using the coal to fire ceramic pipes in the four kilns. The finished product had to be shipped by wagon six miles through Lake Elsinore to the La Laguna rail station at the mouth of Railroad Canyon until 1896 when a spur line was built through Lake Elsinore and Terra Cotta to the new clay deposits in Alberhill. The coal mined was also used locally as fuel for the stamping mill at the Good Hope Mine and was shipped elsewhere in the state. Almost abandoned in 1901, Terra Cotta was revived in 1906 when the California Fireproof Construction Company built a new plant there to make ceramic pipes. In 1912, the plant was closed; by 1925, it was closed down, along with most of the buildings in the town. The clay mine in the town site continued to be operated by the Pacific Clay Products Company until 1940, when they transferred all their operations to Alberhill. An old grid of dirt streets laid out through the sagebrush is all that remains of Terra Cotta. It can be accessed from Lakeshore Drive by Terra Cotta Road or from the I-15 freeway by Nichols Road.

In the 1950s he served in the United States Army as a counter-intelligence agent before attending the University of Chicago, where he earned a master's degree in political science. He earned a Ph.D. in the same field from Yale University. He joined the faculty at Duke University in 1972, and became a full professor there in 1977.Margalit Fox, \\"James D. Barber, Expert on Presidents, Dies at 74\\", The New York Times, 15 September 2004. He is credited in the field of political science for being the first to examine presidents beyond case studies. He devised a system of organizing a president's character into either active-positive, passive- positive, active-negative, or passive-negative. * Traits of an active-positive president include: a readiness to act, high optimism, and an overall fondness of the presidency. Some examples of presidents Barber cites as active-positive include Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, and Gerald Ford. * Traits of a passive-positive president include: a low self- esteem compensated by an ingratiating personality, superficially optimistic, and a desire to please. Examples of passive-positive presidents include William Howard Taft, Ronald Reagan, and Warren G. Harding. * Traits of an active-negative president include: lack of deriving joy after expending much effort on tasks, aggressive, highly rigid, and having a general view of power as a means to self-realization. Examples of active-negative presidents include Woodrow Wilson, Herbert Hoover, and Richard Nixon. * Traits of a passive- negative president include: a strong sense of duty, desire to avoid power, low self-esteem compensated by service towards others, and an overall aversion to intense political negotiation. Presidential examples include Calvin Coolidge and Dwight D. Eisenhower.

Mesopotamian deity sitting on a stool, holding the rod-and-ring symbol. Old-Babylonian fired clay plaque from Southern Mesopotamia, Iraq The Rod and ring symbol is a symbol that is depicted on Mesopotamian stelas, cylinder seals and reliefs. It is held by a god or goddess and in most cases is being offered to a king who is standing, often making a sacrifice, or otherwise showing respect. The symbol dates from the Sumerian Renaissance to the Neo- Assyrian Period, and is commonly explained as a coil of measuring string and a yardstick.Jacobsen, 1987 Other theories are that they are a shepherd's crook and a nose rope,Hallo, W.W. 2005.

The best known example of the symbol is seen on the Code of Hammurabi stela. The most elaborate depiction is found on the Ur-Nammu-stela, where the winding of the cords has been detailed by the sculptor. This has also been described as a \\"staff and a chaplet of beads\\".Jeremy Black, Anthony Green, Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia, Rod and Ring, p 156. There is discussion whether the Ur- Nammu-stela is showing the same thing. Scepter, throne, and ring: Enuma Elish The myth of Inanna's descent to the nether world describes how the goddess dresses and prepares herself: \\"She held the lapis-lazuli measuring rod and measuring line in her hand.\\"cf. Inana's descent to the nether world line 25. The Sumerian has: gi-di≈°-nindan e≈°2-gana2 za-gin3 ≈°u ba-ni-in-du8 i.e. taken literally the rod would have the length of one nindan (6 cubit = 5.94m) and the e≈°2-gana2 the surveyor's line - would be ten nindan in length. In tablet IV of the Enuma Elish, the rod and ring symbol is referenced as: :\\"They rejoiced, and they did homage unto him, saying, \\"Marduk is King!\\" They bestowed upon him the scepter, and the throne, and the ring. They gave him an invincible weaponry which overwhelmeth the foe.\\"Enuma Elish, tablet IV Symbols that appear similar *The Egyptian Shen ring has an identical resemblance. *The Greek goddess Nike uses a different type of investiture symbol for the victor in the sporting races, a wreath of laurel, or a wreath of olive branches, but she is depicted with a ring, a rigid circle. *The Faravahar, the symbol of Zoroastrianism, also holds a ring. *The Egyptian Ankh has a vaguely similar form but is used in very different contexts. *At the 6th century B.C.E. archaeological site of Cancho Roano, located near Zalamea de la Serena, Badajoz, Spain, a large feature in the shape of the rod and ring symbol was modeled into the floor of the innermost chamber of a Tartessian temple. *This symbol also bears a resemblance to an ancient rune called a Thurisaz or thorn, which means \\"frost giant\\" or \\"giant\\".

Introduction  Map of Long Island showing county and municipal boundaries. In New York State, each county is divided into cities and towns. Every point in New York is inside either a city or a town. Additionally, towns may optionally contain villages, which are smaller incorporated municipalities within the town. Villages may overlap multiple towns. Well-known unincorporated places within towns are referred to as hamlets. A town or city is the major subdivision of each county. Towns provide or arrange for most municipal services for residents of hamlets and selected services for residents of villages. All residents of New York who do not live in a city or on an Indian reservation live in a town. A village is an incorporated area which is usually, but not always, within a single town. A village is a clearly defined municipality that provides the services closest to the residents, such as garbage collection, street and highway maintenance, street lighting and building codes. Some villages provide their own police and other optional services. A hamlet is a populated area within a town that is not part of a village. The term \\"hamlet\\" is not defined under New York law (unlike cities, towns and villages), but is often used in the state's statutes to refer to well-known populated sections of towns that are not incorporated as villages.

The 1992 speech has been hailed as \\"one of the best American speeches of the 20th Century.\\" She is the founder of a non-profit organization to fund HIV/AIDS research and education, the Mary Fisher Clinical AIDS Research and Education (CARE) Fund. Since May 2006, she has been a global emissary for the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).Press release (May 18, 2006). \\"World Renowned Artist, Author and Activist Mary Fisher Accepts Appointment as UNAIDS Special Representative\\" (PDF format). Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS. Retrieved August 23, 2012. Early life Fisher was born Lizabeth Davis Frehling on April 6, 1948, in Louisville, Kentucky, the daughter of Marjorie Faith (n√©e Switow) and George Allen Frehling. Her parents were of Russian Jewish descent. Her parents divorced when she was four, and the following year her mother married multimillionaire Max Fisher, who adopted her and whose surname she took. Raised in Michigan, Fisher attended Kingswood School (today's Cranbrook Kingswood School) in Bloomfield Hills (where she had briefly dated politician Mitt Romney), and attended college at the University of Michigan for a year before taking a volunteer position at ABC television in Detroit, Michigan, which she left when afforded an opportunity to join the staff of Gerald R. Ford, then President of the United States, as the first female \\"advance man\\". In 1977, Fisher entered her first marriage, which soon dissolved. In 1984, she sought treatment at the Betty Ford Center for alcoholism; while there, she realized she was artistically inclined. After rehabilitation, she resettled to New York City, New York, and in 1987 she married fellow artist Brian Campbell. The couple relocated to Boca Raton, Florida, and expanded their family. Fisher gave birth to son Max and after several miscarriages, adopted a second son, Zachary, with her husband. In 1990, Campbell requested a divorce and in 1991 informed Fisher that he was HIV positive. Fisher soon learned that she had contracted the virus from him, although their children tested negative. Activist Fisher decided to be open about her HIV status, and after the Detroit Free Press published her story in February 1992, she was invited to speak at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. There, she urged the Republican Party to handle the AIDS crisis and those living with HIV with compassion. In 1995, The New York Times credited Fisher, along with Elizabeth Glaser, who spoke on her experience with AIDS at the 1992 Democratic National Convention, with having \\"brought AIDS home to America.\\" Fisher's Republican convention speech was listed as #50 in American Rhetoric's Top 100 Speeches of the 20th Century (listed by rank). After that appearance, Fisher created a support group for families affected by AIDS and healthcare workers, the Family AIDS Network, and continued speaking as its representative, promoting education, prevention and acceptance of sufferers. In October 1992, President George Bush appointed her to the National Commission on AIDS to replace Magic Johnson. Fisher spoke again at the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego, California. Fisher did not return for the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; she was replaced by fellow AIDS activist (and \\"abstinence-only\\" proponent) Patricia Funderburk Ware. In 1999, Fisher made news when she, like some other HIV-positive people, decided to stop taking anti-HIV medications which she felt were hurting her quality of life. But she and her doctors continued to try new drug combinations and, by 2001, were able to suppress the virus without unmanageable side effects. Finding medications that could prolong healthy life marked a turning point, Fisher said in a 2007 More magazine interview: \\"For years it was waiting to die, and then it was turning everything around and trying to figure out how to live.\\" Fisher expanded her AIDS activism from public speaking into writing, art and international advocacy. She founded the non-profit Mary Fisher CARE Fund, based at the Center for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, to support clinical AIDS research and promote public education about HIV/AIDS medicine and policy. She serves on the leadership council of the 'Global Coalition on Women and AIDS and with other HIV-positive women has toured the United States to raise awareness about the disease. Fisher's international work has focused on Africa and especially Zambia, where she has led fact-finding tours and has promoted income-generation projects to employ HIV-positive women. She has taught African women to create handmade jewelry which is then sold online and in U.S. galleries, with profits returned to the women artisans. Art and design Fisher's art has been exhibited in public and private collections around the world. Collectors include: President and Mrs. George H. W. Bush, President and Mrs. Gerald Ford, Mrs. Henry Ford II, President and Mrs. Mwanawasa of Zambia, and many others. Seven of her sculptures are displayed at the Geneva, Switzerland, headquarters of UNAIDS, as part of Art for AIDS, a collection created to recognize the role art has played in the response to AIDS. Fisher's work also has been shown at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library and Museum. Fisher is represented year round by Goldenstein Gallery. Uptown Sedona, Arizona. A special show featuring her work is held annually in November. The show is titled: CHI: Art as a Healing Medium. The opening reception is held the first Friday in November. Fisher speaks in the gallery at least once a year. She is active with the Sedona Visual Artists Coalition. Author Fisher is the author of six books: An autobiography called My Name is Mary: A Memoir; Angels in Our Midst, a photographic tribute to AIDS caregivers; ABATAKA, a collection of her 'AIDS- themed and African-influenced arts works; two books containing transcripts of speeches, Sleep With the Angels and I'll Not Go Quietly and in 2012, Messenger: A Self-Portrait (Greenleaf Book Group, Austin, Texas).

It is an integral part of any operating system. It is the \\"portion of the operating system code that is always resident in memory\\". It facilitates interactions between hardware and software components. On most systems, it is one of the first programs loaded on startup (after the bootloader). It handles the rest of startup as well as input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data- processing instructions for the central processing unit. It handles memory and peripherals like keyboards, monitors, printers, and speakers. A kernel connects the application software to the hardware of a computer. The critical code of the kernel is usually loaded into a separate area of memory, which is protected from access by application programs or other, less critical parts of the operating system. The kernel performs its tasks, such as running processes, managing hardware devices such as the hard disk, and handling interrupts, in this protected kernel space. In contrast, application programs like browsers, word processors, or audio or video players use a separate area of memory, user space. This separation prevents user data and kernel data from interfering with each other and causing instability and slowness, as well as preventing malfunctioning application programs from crashing the entire operating system. The kernel's interface is a low-level abstraction layer. When a process requests a service to the kernel, it must invoke a system call, usually through a wrapper function that is exposed to userspace applications by system libraries which embed the assembly code for entering the kernel after loading the CPU registers with the syscall number and its parameters (e.g., UNIX-like operating systems accomplish this task using the C standard library). There are different kernel architecture designs. Monolithic kernels run entirely in a single address space with the CPU executing in supervisor mode, mainly for speed. Microkernels run most but not all of their services in user space,cf. Daemon (computing) like user processes do, mainly for resilience and modularity.Roch 2004 MINIX 3 is a notable example of microkernel design. Instead, the Linux kernel is monolithic, although it is also modular, for it can insert and remove loadable kernel modules at runtime. This central component of a computer system is responsible for 'running' or 'executing' programs. The kernel takes responsibility for deciding at any time which of the many running programs should be allocated to the processor or processors.  Random-access memory  Random-access memory (RAM) is used to store both program instructions and data. Typically, both need to be present in memory in order for a program to execute. Often multiple programs will want access to memory, frequently demanding more memory than the computer has available. The kernel is responsible for deciding which memory each process can use, and determining what to do when not enough memory is available.  Input/output devices  I/O devices include such peripherals as keyboards, mice, disk drives, printers, USB devices, network adapters, and display devices. The kernel allocates requests from applications to perform I/O to an appropriate device and provides convenient methods for using the device (typically abstracted to the point where the application does not need to know implementation details of the device). Resource management Key aspects necessary in resource management are defining the execution domain (address space) and the protection mechanism used to mediate access to the resources within a domain.Wulf 1974 pp.337‚Äì345 Kernels also provide methods for synchronization and inter-process communication (IPC). These implementations may be within the kernel itself or the kernel can also rely on other processes it is running. Although the kernel must provide IPC in order to provide access to the facilities provided by each other, kernels must also provide running programs with a method to make requests to access these facilities. The kernel is also responsible for context switching between processes or threads. Memory management The kernel has full access to the system's memory and must allow processes to safely access this memory as they require it. Often the first step in doing this is virtual addressing, usually achieved by paging and/or segmentation. Virtual addressing allows the kernel to make a given physical address appear to be another address, the virtual address. Virtual address spaces may be different for different processes; the memory that one process accesses at a particular (virtual) address may be different memory from what another process accesses at the same address. This allows every program to behave as if it is the only one (apart from the kernel) running and thus prevents applications from crashing each other.Silberschatz 1991 On many systems, a program's virtual address may refer to data which is not currently in memory. The layer of indirection provided by virtual addressing allows the operating system to use other data stores, like a hard drive, to store what would otherwise have to remain in main memory (RAM). As a result, operating systems can allow programs to use more memory than the system has physically available. When a program needs data which is not currently in RAM, the CPU signals to the kernel that this has happened, and the kernel responds by writing the contents of an inactive memory block to disk (if necessary) and replacing it with the data requested by the program. The program can then be resumed from the point where it was stopped. This scheme is generally known as demand paging. Virtual addressing also allows creation of virtual partitions of memory in two disjointed areas, one being reserved for the kernel (kernel space) and the other for the applications (user space). The applications are not permitted by the processor to address kernel memory, thus preventing an application from damaging the running kernel. This fundamental partition of memory space has contributed much to the current designs of actual general- purpose kernels and is almost universal in such systems, although some research kernels (e.g., Singularity) take other approaches. Device management To perform useful functions, processes need access to the peripherals connected to the computer, which are controlled by the kernel through device drivers. A device driver is a computer program that enables the operating system to interact with a hardware device. It provides the operating system with information of how to control and communicate with a certain piece of hardware. The driver is an important and vital piece to a program application. The design goal of a driver is abstraction; the function of the driver is to translate the OS-mandated abstract function calls (programming calls) into device-specific calls. In theory, the device should work correctly with the suitable driver. Device drivers are used for such things as video cards, sound cards, printers, scanners, modems, and LAN cards. At the hardware level, common abstractions of device drivers include: * Interfacing directly * Using a high-level interface (Video BIOS) * Using a lower-level device driver (file drivers using disk drivers) * Simulating work with hardware, while doing something entirely different And at the software level, device driver abstractions include: * Allowing the operating system direct access to hardware resources * Only implementing primitives * Implementing an interface for non-driver software such as TWAIN * Implementing a language (often a high- level language such as PostScript) For example, to show the user something on the screen, an application would make a request to the kernel, which would forward the request to its display driver, which is then responsible for actually plotting the character/pixel. A kernel must maintain a list of available devices. This list may be known in advance (e.g., on an embedded system where the kernel will be rewritten if the available hardware changes), configured by the user (typical on older PCs and on systems that are not designed for personal use) or detected by the operating system at run time (normally called plug and play). In plug-and-play systems, a device manager first performs a scan on different hardware buses, such as Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) or Universal Serial Bus (USB), to detect installed devices, then searches for the appropriate drivers. As device management is a very OS-specific topic, these drivers are handled differently by each kind of kernel design, but in every case, the kernel has to provide the I/O to allow drivers to physically access their devices through some port or memory location. Important decisions have to be made when designing the device management system, as in some designs accesses may involve context switches, making the operation very CPU-intensive and easily causing a significant performance overhead. System calls In computing, a system call is how a process requests a service from an operating system's kernel that it does not normally have permission to run. System calls provide the interface between a process and the operating system. Most operations interacting with the system require permissions not available to a user-level process, e.g., I/O performed with a device present on the system, or any form of communication with other processes requires the use of system calls. A system call is a mechanism that is used by the application program to request a service from the operating system. They use a machine-code instruction that causes the processor to change mode. An example would be from supervisor mode to protected mode. This is where the operating system performs actions like accessing hardware devices or the memory management unit. Generally the operating system provides a library that sits between the operating system and normal user programs. Usually it is a C library such as Glibc or Windows API. The library handles the low-level details of passing information to the kernel and switching to supervisor mode. System calls include close, open, read, wait and write. To actually perform useful work, a process must be able to access the services provided by the kernel. This is implemented differently by each kernel, but most provide a C library or an API, which in turn invokes the related kernel functions. The method of invoking the kernel function varies from kernel to kernel. If memory isolation is in use, it is impossible for a user process to call the kernel directly, because that would be a violation of the processor's access control rules. A few possibilities are: * Using a software-simulated interrupt. This method is available on most hardware, and is therefore very common. * Using a call gate. A call gate is a special address stored by the kernel in a list in kernel memory at a location known to the processor. When the processor detects a call to that address, it instead redirects to the target location without causing an access violation. This requires hardware support, but the hardware for it is quite common. * Using a special system call instruction. This technique requires special hardware support, which common architectures (notably, x86) may lack. System call instructions have been added to recent models of x86 processors, however, and some operating systems for PCs make use of them when available. * Using a memory-based queue. An application that makes large numbers of requests but does not need to wait for the result of each may add details of requests to an area of memory that the kernel periodically scans to find requests. Kernel design decisions=Protection An important consideration in the design of a kernel is the support it provides for protection from faults (fault tolerance) and from malicious behaviours (security). These two aspects are usually not clearly distinguished, and the adoption of this distinction in the kernel design leads to the rejection of a hierarchical structure for protection. The mechanisms or policies provided by the kernel can be classified according to several criteria, including: static (enforced at compile time) or dynamic (enforced at run time); pre-emptive or post- detection; according to the protection principles they satisfy (e.g., DenningDenning 1976Swift 2005, p.29 quote: \\"isolation, resource control, decision verification (checking), and error recovery.\\"); whether they are hardware supported or language based; whether they are more an open mechanism or a binding policy; and many more. Support for hierarchical protection domainsSchroeder 72 is typically implemented using CPU modes. Many kernels provide implementation of \\"capabilities\\", i.e., objects that are provided to user code which allow limited access to an underlying object managed by the kernel. A common example is file handling: a file is a representation of information stored on a permanent storage device. The kernel may be able to perform many different operations, including read, write, delete or execute, but a user-level application may only be permitted to perform some of these operations (e.g., it may only be allowed to read the file). A common implementation of this is for the kernel to provide an object to the application (typically so called a \\"file handle\\") which the application may then invoke operations on, the validity of which the kernel checks at the time the operation is requested. Such a system may be extended to cover all objects that the kernel manages, and indeed to objects provided by other user applications. An efficient and simple way to provide hardware support of capabilities is to delegate to the memory management unit (MMU) the responsibility of checking access-rights for every memory access, a mechanism called capability-based addressing.Linden 76 Most commercial computer architectures lack such MMU support for capabilities. An alternative approach is to simulate capabilities using commonly supported hierarchical domains. In this approach, each protected object must reside in an address space that the application does not have access to; the kernel also maintains a list of capabilities in such memory. When an application needs to access an object protected by a capability, it performs a system call and the kernel then checks whether the application's capability grants it permission to perform the requested action, and if it is permitted performs the access for it (either directly, or by delegating the request to another user-level process). The performance cost of address space switching limits the practicality of this approach in systems with complex interactions between objects, but it is used in current operating systems for objects that are not accessed frequently or which are not expected to perform quickly.Stephane Eranian and David Mosberger, Virtual Memory in the IA-64 Linux Kernel, Prentice Hall PTR, 2002Silberschatz & Galvin, Operating System Concepts, 4th ed, pp. 445 & 446 If the firmware does not support protection mechanisms, it is possible to simulate protection at a higher level, for example by simulating capabilities by manipulating page tables, but there are performance implications. Lack of hardware support may not be an issue, however, for systems that choose to use language-based protection.A Language-Based Approach to Security, Schneider F., Morrissett G. (Cornell University) and Harper R. (Carnegie Mellon University) An important kernel design decision is the choice of the abstraction levels where the security mechanisms and policies should be implemented. Kernel security mechanisms play a critical role in supporting security at higher levels.J. Anderson, Computer Security Technology Planning Study , Air Force Elect. Systems Div., ESD-TR-73-51, October 1972.* One approach is to use firmware and kernel support for fault tolerance (see above), and build the security policy for malicious behavior on top of that (adding features such as cryptography mechanisms where necessary), delegating some responsibility to the compiler. Approaches that delegate enforcement of security policy to the compiler and/or the application level are often called language-based security. The lack of many critical security mechanisms in current mainstream operating systems impedes the implementation of adequate security policies at the application abstraction level.P. A. Loscocco, S. D. Smalley, P. A. Muckelbauer, R. C. Taylor, S. J. Turner, and J. F. Farrell. The Inevitability of Failure: The Flawed Assumption of Security in Modern Computing Environments . In Proceedings of the 21st National Information Systems Security Conference, pages 303‚Äì314, Oct. 1998. . In fact, a common misconception in computer security is that any security policy can be implemented in an application regardless of kernel support. =Hardware- or language-based protection= Typical computer systems today use hardware-enforced rules about what programs are allowed to access what data. The processor monitors the execution and stops a program that violates a rule, such as a user process that tries to write to kernel memory. In systems that lack support for capabilities, processes are isolated from each other by using separate address spaces. Calls from user processes into the kernel are regulated by requiring them to use one of the above-described system call methods. An alternative approach is to use language-based protection. In a language-based protection system, the kernel will only allow code to execute that has been produced by a trusted language compiler. The language may then be designed such that it is impossible for the programmer to instruct it to do something that will violate a security requirement. Advantages of this approach include: * No need for separate address spaces. Switching between address spaces is a slow operation that causes a great deal of overhead, and a lot of optimization work is currently performed in order to prevent unnecessary switches in current operating systems. Switching is completely unnecessary in a language-based protection system, as all code can safely operate in the same address space. * Flexibility. Any protection scheme that can be designed to be expressed via a programming language can be implemented using this method. Changes to the protection scheme (e.g. from a hierarchical system to a capability-based one) do not require new hardware. Disadvantages include: * Longer application startup time. Applications must be verified when they are started to ensure they have been compiled by the correct compiler, or may need recompiling either from source code or from bytecode. * Inflexible type systems. On traditional systems, applications frequently perform operations that are not type safe. Such operations cannot be permitted in a language-based protection system, which means that applications may need to be rewritten and may, in some cases, lose performance. Examples of systems with language-based protection include JX and Microsoft's Singularity. Process cooperation Edsger Dijkstra proved that from a logical point of view, atomic lock and unlock operations operating on binary semaphores are sufficient primitives to express any functionality of process cooperation.Dijkstra, E. W. Cooperating Sequential Processes. Math. Dep., Technological U., Eindhoven, Sept. 1965. However this approach is generally held to be lacking in terms of safety and efficiency, whereas a message passing approach is more flexible.Brinch Hansen 70 pp.238‚Äì241 A number of other approaches (either lower- or higher-level) are available as well, with many modern kernels providing support for systems such as shared memory and remote procedure calls. I/O device management The idea of a kernel where I/O devices are handled uniformly with other processes, as parallel co-operating processes, was first proposed and implemented by Brinch Hansen (although similar ideas were suggested in 1967). In Hansen's description of this, the \\"common\\" processes are called internal processes, while the I/O devices are called external processes. Similar to physical memory, allowing applications direct access to controller ports and registers can cause the controller to malfunction, or system to crash. With this, depending on the complexity of the device, some devices can get surprisingly complex to program, and use several different controllers. Because of this, providing a more abstract interface to manage the device is important. This interface is normally done by a device driver or hardware abstraction layer. Frequently, applications will require access to these devices. The kernel must maintain the list of these devices by querying the system for them in some way. This can be done through the BIOS, or through one of the various system buses (such as PCI/PCIE, or USB). When an application requests an operation on a device (Such as displaying a character), the kernel needs to send this request to the current active video driver. The video driver, in turn, needs to carry out this request. This is an example of inter-process communication (IPC). Kernel-wide design approaches Naturally, the above listed tasks and features can be provided in many ways that differ from each other in design and implementation. The principle of separation of mechanism and policy is the substantial difference between the philosophy of micro and monolithic kernels.Baiardi 1988Levin 75 Here a mechanism is the support that allows the implementation of many different policies, while a policy is a particular \\"mode of operation\\". Example: * Mechanism: User login attempts are routed to an authorization server * Policy: Authorization server requires a password which is verified against stored passwords in a database Because the mechanism and policy are separated, the policy can be easily changed to e.g. require the use of a security token. In minimal microkernel just some very basic policies are included, and its mechanisms allows what is running on top of the kernel (the remaining part of the operating system and the other applications) to decide which policies to adopt (as memory management, high level process scheduling, file system management, etc.). A monolithic kernel instead tends to include many policies, therefore restricting the rest of the system to rely on them. Per Brinch Hansen presented arguments in favour of separation of mechanism and policy. The failure to properly fulfill this separation is one of the major causes of the lack of substantial innovation in existing operating systems, a problem common in computer architecture.Denning 1980J√ºrgen Nehmer, \\"The Immortality of Operating Systems, or: Is Research in Operating Systems still Justified?\\", Lecture Notes In Computer Science; Vol. 563. Proceedings of the International Workshop on Operating Systems of the 90s and Beyond. pp. 77‚Äì83 (1991) quote: \\"The past 25 years have shown that research on operating system architecture had a minor effect on existing main stream systems.\\"Levy 84, p.1 quote: \\"Although the complexity of computer applications increases yearly, the underlying hardware architecture for applications has remained unchanged for decades.\\" The monolithic design is induced by the \\"kernel mode\\"/\\"user mode\\" architectural approach to protection (technically called hierarchical protection domains), which is common in conventional commercial systems;Levy 84, p.1 quote: \\"Conventional architectures support a single privileged mode of operation. This structure leads to monolithic design; any module needing protection must be part of the single operating system kernel. If, instead, any module could execute within a protected domain, systems could be built as a collection of independent modules extensible by any user.\\" in fact, every module needing protection is therefore preferably included into the kernel. This link between monolithic design and \\"privileged mode\\" can be reconducted to the key issue of mechanism- policy separation; in fact the \\"privileged mode\\" architectural approach melds together the protection mechanism with the security policies, while the major alternative architectural approach, capability-based addressing, clearly distinguishes between the two, leading naturally to a microkernel design (see Separation of protection and security). While monolithic kernels execute all of their code in the same address space (kernel space), microkernels try to run most of their services in user space, aiming to improve maintainability and modularity of the codebase. Most kernels do not fit exactly into one of these categories, but are rather found in between these two designs. These are called hybrid kernels. More exotic designs such as nanokernels and exokernels are available, but are seldom used for production systems. The Xen hypervisor, for example, is an exokernel. Monolithic kernels Diagram of a monolithic kernel In a monolithic kernel, all OS services run along with the main kernel thread, thus also residing in the same memory area. This approach provides rich and powerful hardware access. Some developers, such as UNIX developer Ken Thompson, maintain that it is \\"easier to implement a monolithic kernel\\" than microkernels. The main disadvantages of monolithic kernels are the dependencies between system components a bug in a device driver might crash the entire system and the fact that large kernels can become very difficult to maintain. Monolithic kernels, which have traditionally been used by Unix-like operating systems, contain all the operating system core functions and the device drivers. This is the traditional design of UNIX systems. A monolithic kernel is one single program that contains all of the code necessary to perform every kernel-related task. Every part which is to be accessed by most programs which cannot be put in a library is in the kernel space: Device drivers, scheduler, memory handling, file systems, and network stacks. Many system calls are provided to applications, to allow them to access all those services. A monolithic kernel, while initially loaded with subsystems that may not be needed, can be tuned to a point where it is as fast as or faster than the one that was specifically designed for the hardware, although more relevant in a general sense. Modern monolithic kernels, such as those of Linux (one of the kernels of the GNU operating system) and FreeBSD, both of which fall into the category of Unix-like operating systems, feature the ability to load modules at runtime, thereby allowing easy extension of the kernel's capabilities as required, while helping to minimize the amount of code running in kernel space. In the monolithic kernel, some advantages hinge on these points: * Since there is less software involved it is faster. * As it is one single piece of software it should be smaller both in source and compiled forms. * Less code generally means fewer bugs which can translate to fewer security problems. Most work in the monolithic kernel is done via system calls. These are interfaces, usually kept in a tabular structure, that access some subsystem within the kernel such as disk operations. Essentially calls are made within programs and a checked copy of the request is passed through the system call. Hence, not far to travel at all. The monolithic Linux kernel can be made extremely small not only because of its ability to dynamically load modules but also because of its ease of customization. In fact, there are some versions that are small enough to fit together with a large number of utilities and other programs on a single floppy disk and still provide a fully functional operating system (one of the most popular of which is muLinux). This ability to miniaturize its kernel has also led to a rapid growth in the use of GNU/Linux in embedded systems. These types of kernels consist of the core functions of the operating system and the device drivers with the ability to load modules at runtime. They provide rich and powerful abstractions of the underlying hardware. They provide a small set of simple hardware abstractions and use applications called servers to provide more functionality. This particular approach defines a high-level virtual interface over the hardware, with a set of system calls to implement operating system services such as process management, concurrency and memory management in several modules that run in supervisor mode. This design has several flaws and limitations: * Coding in kernel can be challenging, in part because one cannot use common libraries (like a full-featured libc), and because one needs to use a source- level debugger like gdb. Rebooting the computer is often required. This is not just a problem of convenience to the developers. When debugging is harder, and as difficulties become stronger, it becomes more likely that code will be \\"buggier\\". * Bugs in one part of the kernel have strong side effects; since every function in the kernel has all the privileges, a bug in one function can corrupt data structure of another, totally unrelated part of the kernel, or of any running program. * Kernels often become very large and difficult to maintain. * Even if the modules servicing these operations are separate from the whole, the code integration is tight and difficult to do correctly. * Since the modules run in the same address space, a bug can bring down the entire system. * Monolithic kernels are not portable; therefore, they must be rewritten for each new architecture that the operating system is to be used on. In the microkernel approach, the kernel itself only provides basic functionality that allows the execution of servers, separate programs that assume former kernel functions, such as device drivers, GUI servers, etc. Examples of monolithic kernels are AIX kernel, HP-UX kernel and Solaris kernel. Microkernels Microkernel (also abbreviated ŒºK or uK) is the term describing an approach to operating system design by which the functionality of the system is moved out of the traditional \\"kernel\\", into a set of \\"servers\\" that communicate through a \\"minimal\\" kernel, leaving as little as possible in \\"system space\\" and as much as possible in \\"user space\\". A microkernel that is designed for a specific platform or device is only ever going to have what it needs to operate. The microkernel approach consists of defining a simple abstraction over the hardware, with a set of primitives or system calls to implement minimal OS services such as memory management, multitasking, and inter-process communication. Other services, including those normally provided by the kernel, such as networking, are implemented in user- space programs, referred to as servers. Microkernels are easier to maintain than monolithic kernels, but the large number of system calls and context switches might slow down the system because they typically generate more overhead than plain function calls. Only parts which really require being in a privileged mode are in kernel space: IPC (Inter-Process Communication), basic scheduler, or scheduling primitives, basic memory handling, basic I/O primitives. Many critical parts are now running in user space: The complete scheduler, memory handling, file systems, and network stacks. Micro kernels were invented as a reaction to traditional \\"monolithic\\" kernel design, whereby all system functionality was put in a one static program running in a special \\"system\\" mode of the processor. In the microkernel, only the most fundamental of tasks are performed such as being able to access some (not necessarily all) of the hardware, manage memory and coordinate message passing between the processes. Some systems that use micro kernels are QNX and the HURD. In the case of QNX and Hurd user sessions can be entire snapshots of the system itself or views as it is referred to. The very essence of the microkernel architecture illustrates some of its advantages: * Easier to maintain * Patches can be tested in a separate instance, and then swapped in to take over a production instance. * Rapid development time and new software can be tested without having to reboot the kernel. * More persistence in general, if one instance goes haywire, it is often possible to substitute it with an operational mirror. Most microkernels use a message passing system to handle requests from one server to another. The message passing system generally operates on a port basis with the microkernel. As an example, if a request for more memory is sent, a port is opened with the microkernel and the request sent through. Once within the microkernel, the steps are similar to system calls. The rationale was that it would bring modularity in the system architecture, which would entail a cleaner system, easier to debug or dynamically modify, customizable to users' needs, and more performing. They are part of the operating systems like GNU Hurd, MINIX, MkLinux, QNX and Redox OS. Although microkernels are very small by themselves, in combination with all their required auxiliary code they are, in fact, often larger than monolithic kernels. Advocates of monolithic kernels also point out that the two-tiered structure of microkernel systems, in which most of the operating system does not interact directly with the hardware, creates a not- insignificant cost in terms of system efficiency. These types of kernels normally provide only the minimal services such as defining memory address spaces, inter-process communication (IPC) and the process management. The other functions such as running the hardware processes are not handled directly by microkernels. Proponents of micro kernels point out those monolithic kernels have the disadvantage that an error in the kernel can cause the entire system to crash. However, with a microkernel, if a kernel process crashes, it is still possible to prevent a crash of the system as a whole by merely restarting the service that caused the error. Other services provided by the kernel such as networking are implemented in user-space programs referred to as servers. Servers allow the operating system to be modified by simply starting and stopping programs. For a machine without networking support, for instance, the networking server is not started. The task of moving in and out of the kernel to move data between the various applications and servers creates overhead which is detrimental to the efficiency of micro kernels in comparison with monolithic kernels. Disadvantages in the microkernel exist however. Some are: * Larger running memory footprint * More software for interfacing is required, there is a potential for performance loss. * Messaging bugs can be harder to fix due to the longer trip they have to take versus the one off copy in a monolithic kernel. * Process management in general can be very complicated. The disadvantages for microkernels are extremely context-based. As an example, they work well for small single- purpose (and critical) systems because if not many processes need to run, then the complications of process management are effectively mitigated. A microkernel allows the implementation of the remaining part of the operating system as a normal application program written in a high-level language, and the use of different operating systems on top of the same unchanged kernel. It is also possible to dynamically switch among operating systems and to have more than one active simultaneously. Monolithic kernels vs. microkernels As the computer kernel grows, so grows the size and vulnerability of its trusted computing base; and, besides reducing security, there is the problem of enlarging the memory footprint. This is mitigated to some degree by perfecting the virtual memory system, but not all computer architectures have virtual memory support.Virtual addressing is most commonly achieved through a built-in memory management unit. To reduce the kernel's footprint, extensive editing has to be performed to carefully remove unneeded code, which can be very difficult with non-obvious interdependencies between parts of a kernel with millions of lines of code. By the early 1990s, due to the various shortcomings of monolithic kernels versus microkernels, monolithic kernels were considered obsolete by virtually all operating system researchers. As a result, the design of Linux as a monolithic kernel rather than a microkernel was the topic of a famous debate between Linus Torvalds and Andrew Tanenbaum.Recordings of the debate between Torvalds and Tanenbaum can be found at dina.dk , groups.google.com, oreilly.com and Andrew Tanenbaum's website There is merit on both sides of the argument presented in the Tanenbaum‚ÄìTorvalds debate. =Performance= Monolithic kernels are designed to have all of their code in the same address space (kernel space), which some developers argue is necessary to increase the performance of the system. Some developers also maintain that monolithic systems are extremely efficient if well written. quote: \\"The tightly coupled nature of a monolithic kernel allows it to make very efficient use of the underlying hardware [...] Microkernels, on the other hand, run a lot more of the core processes in userland. [...] Unfortunately, these benefits come at the cost of the microkernel having to pass a lot of information in and out of the kernel space through a process known as a context switch. Context switches introduce considerable overhead and therefore result in a performance penalty.\\" The monolithic model tends to be more efficient through the use of shared kernel memory, rather than the slower IPC system of microkernel designs, which is typically based on message passing. The performance of microkernels was poor in both the 1980s and early 1990s.Liedtke 95H√§rtig 97 However, studies that empirically measured the performance of these microkernels did not analyze the reasons of such inefficiency. The explanations of this data were left to \\"folklore\\", with the assumption that they were due to the increased frequency of switches from \\"kernel-mode\\" to \\"user-mode\\", to the increased frequency of inter-process communication and to the increased frequency of context switches. In fact, as guessed in 1995, the reasons for the poor performance of microkernels might as well have been: (1) an actual inefficiency of the whole microkernel approach, (2) the particular concepts implemented in those microkernels, and (3) the particular implementation of those concepts. Therefore it remained to be studied if the solution to build an efficient microkernel was, unlike previous attempts, to apply the correct construction techniques. On the other end, the hierarchical protection domains architecture that leads to the design of a monolithic kernel has a significant performance drawback each time there's an interaction between different levels of protection (i.e., when a process has to manipulate a data structure both in \\"user mode\\" and \\"supervisor mode\\"), since this requires message copying by value.Hansen 73, section 7.3 p.233 \\"interactions between different levels of protection require transmission of messages by value\\" The hybrid kernel approach combines the speed and simpler design of a monolithic kernel with the modularity and execution safety of a microkernel. Hybrid (or modular) kernels Hybrid kernels are used in most commercial operating systems such as Microsoft Windows NT 3.1, NT 3.5, NT 3.51, NT 4.0, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 and 10. Apple Inc's own macOS uses a hybrid kernel called XNU which is based upon code from OSF/1's Mach kernel (OSFMK 7.3) and FreeBSD's monolithic kernel. They are similar to micro kernels, except they include some additional code in kernel-space to increase performance. These kernels represent a compromise that was implemented by some developers to accommodate the major advantages of both monolithic and micro kernels. These types of kernels are extensions of micro kernels with some properties of monolithic kernels. Unlike monolithic kernels, these types of kernels are unable to load modules at runtime on their own. Hybrid kernels are micro kernels that have some \\"non-essential\\" code in kernel-space in order for the code to run more quickly than it would were it to be in user-space. Hybrid kernels are a compromise between the monolithic and microkernel designs. This implies running some services (such as the network stack or the filesystem) in kernel space to reduce the performance overhead of a traditional microkernel, but still running kernel code (such as device drivers) as servers in user space. Many traditionally monolithic kernels are now at least adding (or else using) the module capability. The most well known of these kernels is the Linux kernel. The modular kernel essentially can have parts of it that are built into the core kernel binary or binaries that load into memory on demand. It is important to note that a code tainted module has the potential to destabilize a running kernel. Many people become confused on this point when discussing micro kernels. It is possible to write a driver for a microkernel in a completely separate memory space and test it before \\"going\\" live. When a kernel module is loaded, it accesses the monolithic portion's memory space by adding to it what it needs, therefore, opening the doorway to possible pollution. A few advantages to the modular (or) Hybrid kernel are: * Faster development time for drivers that can operate from within modules. No reboot required for testing (provided the kernel is not destabilized). * On demand capability versus spending time recompiling a whole kernel for things like new drivers or subsystems. * Faster integration of third party technology (related to development but pertinent unto itself nonetheless). Modules, generally, communicate with the kernel using a module interface of some sort. The interface is generalized (although particular to a given operating system) so it is not always possible to use modules. Often the device drivers may need more flexibility than the module interface affords. Essentially, it is two system calls and often the safety checks that only have to be done once in the monolithic kernel now may be done twice. Some of the disadvantages of the modular approach are: * With more interfaces to pass through, the possibility of increased bugs exists (which implies more security holes). * Maintaining modules can be confusing for some administrators when dealing with problems like symbol differences. Nanokernels A nanokernel delegates virtually all services including even the most basic ones like interrupt controllers or the timer to device drivers to make the kernel memory requirement even smaller than a traditional microkernel.KeyKOS Nanokernel Architecture Exokernels Exokernels are a still-experimental approach to operating system design. They differ from the other types of kernels in that their functionality is limited to the protection and multiplexing of the raw hardware, providing no hardware abstractions on top of which to develop applications. This separation of hardware protection from hardware management enables application developers to determine how to make the most efficient use of the available hardware for each specific program. Exokernels in themselves are extremely small. However, they are accompanied by library operating systems (see also unikernel), providing application developers with the functionalities of a conventional operating system. A major advantage of exokernel-based systems is that they can incorporate multiple library operating systems, each exporting a different API, for example one for high level UI development and one for real-time control. History of kernel development=Early operating system kernels Strictly speaking, an operating system (and thus, a kernel) is not required to run a computer. Programs can be directly loaded and executed on the \\"bare metal\\" machine, provided that the authors of those programs are willing to work without any hardware abstraction or operating system support. Most early computers operated this way during the 1950s and early 1960s, which were reset and reloaded between the execution of different programs. Eventually, small ancillary programs such as program loaders and debuggers were left in memory between runs, or loaded from ROM. As these were developed, they formed the basis of what became early operating system kernels. The \\"bare metal\\" approach is still used today on some video game consoles and embedded systems,Ball: Embedded Microprocessor Designs, p. 129 but in general, newer computers use modern operating systems and kernels. In 1969, the RC 4000 Multiprogramming System introduced the system design philosophy of a small nucleus \\"upon which operating systems for different purposes could be built in an orderly manner\\",Hansen 2001 (os), pp.17‚Äì18 what would be called the microkernel approach. Time-sharing operating systems In the decade preceding Unix, computers had grown enormously in power to the point where computer operators were looking for new ways to get people to use their spare time on their machines. One of the major developments during this era was time-sharing, whereby a number of users would get small slices of computer time, at a rate at which it appeared they were each connected to their own, slower, machine. The development of time-sharing systems led to a number of problems. One was that users, particularly at universities where the systems were being developed, seemed to want to hack the system to get more CPU time. For this reason, security and access control became a major focus of the Multics project in 1965.Introduction and Overview of the Multics System, by F. J. Corbat√≥ and V. A. Vissotsky. Another ongoing issue was properly handling computing resources: users spent most of their time staring at the terminal and thinking about what to input instead of actually using the resources of the computer, and a time-sharing system should give the CPU time to an active user during these periods. Finally, the systems typically offered a memory hierarchy several layers deep, and partitioning this expensive resource led to major developments in virtual memory systems. Amiga The Commodore Amiga was released in 1985, and was among the first and certainly most successful home computers to feature an advanced kernel architecture. The AmigaOS kernel's executive component, exec.library, uses a microkernel message-passing design, but there are other kernel components, like graphics.library, that have direct access to the hardware. There is no memory protection, and the kernel is almost always running in user mode. Only special actions are executed in kernel mode, and user-mode applications can ask the operating system to execute their code in kernel mode. Unix A diagram of the predecessor/successor family relationship for Unix-like systems During the design phase of Unix, programmers decided to model every high-level device as a file, because they believed the purpose of computation was data transformation. For instance, printers were represented as a \\"file\\" at a known location when data was copied to the file, it printed out. Other systems, to provide a similar functionality, tended to virtualize devices at a lower level that is, both devices and files would be instances of some lower level concept. Virtualizing the system at the file level allowed users to manipulate the entire system using their existing file management utilities and concepts, dramatically simplifying operation. As an extension of the same paradigm, Unix allows programmers to manipulate files using a series of small programs, using the concept of pipes, which allowed users to complete operations in stages, feeding a file through a chain of single-purpose tools. Although the end result was the same, using smaller programs in this way dramatically increased flexibility as well as ease of development and use, allowing the user to modify their workflow by adding or removing a program from the chain. In the Unix model, the operating system consists of two parts: first, the huge collection of utility programs that drive most operations; second, the kernel that runs the programs. Under Unix, from a programming standpoint, the distinction between the two is fairly thin; the kernel is a program, running in supervisor mode,The highest privilege level has various names throughout different architectures, such as supervisor mode, kernel mode, CPL0, DPL0, ring 0, etc. See Ring (computer security) for more information. that acts as a program loader and supervisor for the small utility programs making up the rest of the system, and to provide locking and I/O services for these programs; beyond that, the kernel didn't intervene at all in user space. Over the years the computing model changed, and Unix's treatment of everything as a file or byte stream no longer was as universally applicable as it was before. Although a terminal could be treated as a file or a byte stream, which is printed to or read from, the same did not seem to be true for a graphical user interface. Networking posed another problem. Even if network communication can be compared to file access, the low-level packet-oriented architecture dealt with discrete chunks of data and not with whole files. As the capability of computers grew, Unix became increasingly cluttered with code. It is also because the modularity of the Unix kernel is extensively scalable. While kernels might have had 100,000 lines of code in the seventies and eighties, kernels like Linux, of modern Unix successors like GNU, have more than 13 million lines.Linux Kernel 2.6: It's Worth More!, by David A. Wheeler, October 12, 2004 Modern Unix-derivatives are generally based on module-loading monolithic kernels. Examples of this are the Linux kernel in the many distributions of GNU, IBM AIX, as well as the Berkeley Software Distribution variant kernels such as FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, and macOS. Apart from these alternatives, amateur developers maintain an active operating system development community, populated by self-written hobby kernels which mostly end up sharing many features with Linux, FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, OpenBSD or NetBSD kernels and/or being compatible with them.This community mostly gathers at Bona Fide OS Development, The Mega-Tokyo Message Board and other operating system enthusiast web sites. Mac OS Apple first launched its classic Mac OS in 1984, bundled with its Macintosh personal computer. Apple moved to a nanokernel design in Mac OS 8.6. Against this, the modern macOS (originally named Mac OS X) is based on Darwin, which uses a hybrid kernel called XNU, which was created by combining the 4.3BSD kernel and the Mach kernel.XNU: The Kernel Microsoft Windows Microsoft Windows was first released in 1985 as an add-on to MS-DOS. Because of its dependence on another operating system, initial releases of Windows, prior to Windows 95, were considered an operating environment (not to be confused with an operating system). This product line continued to evolve through the 1980s and 1990s, with the Windows 9x series adding 32-bit addressing and pre-emptive multitasking; but ended with the release of Windows Me in 2000. Microsoft also developed Windows NT, an operating system with a very similar interface, but intended for high-end and business users. This line started with the release of Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, and was introduced to general users with the release of Windows XP in October 2001‚Äîreplacing Windows 9x with a completely different, much more sophisticated operating system. This is the line that continues with Windows 10. The architecture of Windows NT's kernel is considered a hybrid kernel because the kernel itself contains tasks such as the Window Manager and the IPC Managers, with a client/server layered subsystem model.  IBM Supervisor  Supervisory program or supervisor is a computer program, usually part of an operating system, that controls the execution of other routines and regulates work scheduling, input/output operations, error actions, and similar functions and regulates the flow of work in a data processing system. Historically, this term was essentially associated with IBM's line of mainframe operating systems starting with OS/360. In other operating systems, the supervisor is generally called the kernel. In the 1970s, IBM further abstracted the supervisor state from the hardware, resulting in a hypervisor that enabled full virtualization, i.e. the capacity to run multiple operating systems on the same machine totally independently from each other. Hence the first such system was called Virtual Machine or VM. Development of microkernels Although Mach, developed at Carnegie Mellon University from 1985 to 1994, is the best-known general- purpose microkernel, other microkernels have been developed with more specific aims. The L4 microkernel family (mainly the L3 and the L4 kernel) was created to demonstrate that microkernels are not necessarily slow. Newer implementations such as Fiasco and Pistachio are able to run Linux next to other L4 processes in separate address spaces. Additionally, QNX is a microkernel which is principally used in embedded systems, and the open-source software MINIX, while originally created for educational purposes, is now focussed on being a highly reliable and self-healing microkernel OS.

Its name comes from Danzig, Gda≈Ñsk in present-day Poland. Alt, meaning \\"old\\", distinguishes this community from Neu Danzig, another German settlement in this area of the Russian Empire. The German colony Alt Danzig is also known as Old Danzig along with the existing local village of Karlovka (Russian: –ö–∞—Ä–ª–æ–≤–∫–∞) were united in Krupskoe (Russian: –ö—Ä—É–ø—Å–∫–æ–µ) after the October Revolution in Russia. History Catherine II of Russia wanted to stabilize the borderlands of the Russian Empire with an agricultural population. To do this she recruited in the Danzig area of Prussia. The immigration agent George von Trappe Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online (GAMEO) ‚Üí Trappe, George von led the first of the Black Sea Settlers, which consisted of 50 families. He took them first by boat to Riga; they then travelled south to Kremenchuk by wagon. Here the party split and 29 families continued to Elizabethgrad (present-day Kropyvnytskyi in Ukraine). In 1787 they founded Alt Danzig about 15 km to the southwest on land granted to them by Prince Potemkin. By 1803 the settlement had lost 10 families that left due to the hardships involved in learning to farm (they were all previously artisans). This is when 10 new Pomeranian families arrived, whose knowledge of farming proved useful to the community. Several families from Munich arrived in 1841, followed by seven more from Rohrbach in 1842. Originally Alt Danzig was called \\"Danzig\\" but when a daughter colony was established by several Danzig villagers near Nikolajew, the older village was renamed Alt Danzig and the newer village, Neu Danzig. Geography The land around Alt Danzig was high and rocky, making it subject to drought. The community planted a small forest on the side of the river that they owned. The land was suitable for growing grains and potatoes. A profitable water mill was in place by 1848. Cattle and sheep were also raised. The average annual rainfall in the present- day region is about 475 mm (18.7 in). The 24-hour average temperature in July is 20.6 ¬∞C (69.1 ¬∞F) and in January it is -5 ¬∞C (23 ¬∞F).

The company was founded in a one-car garage in Palo Alto, California by Bill Hewlett and David Packard in 1939, and initially produced a line of electronic test and measurement equipment. The HP Garage at 367 Addison Avenue is now designated an official California Historical Landmark, and is marked with a plaque calling it the \\"Birthplace of 'Silicon Valley'\\". The company got its first big contract in 1938, providing its test and measurement instruments for production of Walt Disney's hugely successful animated film Fantasia. This success led Hewlett and Packard to formally establish their Hewlett-Packard Company on January 1, 1939. The company grew into a multinational corporation widely respected for its products, and its management style and culture known as the HP Way, which was adopted by other businesses worldwide. HP was the world's leading PC manufacturer from 2007 until the second quarter of 2013, when Lenovo moved ahead of HP.Lenovo Shares Jump As PC Shipments Overtake HP. November 7, 2013 HP specialized in developing and manufacturing computing, data storage, and networking hardware, designing software and delivering services. Major product lines included personal computing devices, enterprise and industry standard servers, related storage devices, networking products, software and a diverse range of printers and other imaging products. HP directly marketed its products to households, small- to medium-sized businesses and enterprises as well as via online distribution, consumer-electronics and office-supply retailers, software partners and major technology vendors. HP also offered services and a consulting business for its products and partner products. In 1999, Hewlett-Packard Company spun off its electronic and bio-analytical test and measurement instruments business as Agilent Technologies; HP retained focus on its later products, including computers and printers. It merged with Compaq in 2002, and acquired EDS in 2008, leading to combined revenues of $118.4 billion that year and a Fortune 500 ranking of 9 in 2009. In November 2009, HP announced its acquisition of 3Com, with the deal closing on April 12, 2010. On April 28, 2010, HP announced its buyout of Palm, Inc. for $1.2 billion. On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion), which Dell declined to match. On November 1, 2015, the company spun off its enterprise products and services business Hewlett Packard Enterprise. Hewlett-Packard retained the personal computer and printer businesses and was renamed HP Inc. History garage in Palo Alto, where Hewlett and Packard began the company Hewlett-Packard logo used from 1941 to 1964 Bill Hewlett and David Packard graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company originated in a garage in nearby Palo Alto during a fellowship they had with past professor Frederick Terman at Stanford during the Great Depression. They considered Terman a mentor in forming Hewlett-Packard. In 1938, Packard and Hewlett began part-time work in a rented garage with an initial capital investment of US$538. In 1939, Hewlett and Packard decided to formalize their partnership. They tossed a coin to decide whether the company they founded would be called Hewlett-Packard (HP) or Packard-Hewlett. HP was incorporated on August 18, 1947, and went public on November 6, 1957. Of the many projects they worked on, their first financially successful product was a precision audio oscillator known as the Model HP200A. Their innovation was the use of a small incandescent light bulb (known as a \\"pilot light\\") as a temperature dependent resistor in a critical portion of the circuit, the negative feedback loop which stabilized the amplitude of the output sinusoidal waveform. This allowed them to sell the Model 200A for $89.40 when competitors were selling less stable oscillators for over $200. The Model 200 series of generators continued production until at least 1972 as the 200AB, still tube-based but improved in design through the years. One of the company's earliest customers was Bud Hawkins, chief sound engineer for Walt Disney Studios, who bought eight Model 200B audio oscillators (at $71.50 each) for use in the animated film Fantasia. HP's profit at the end of 1939, its first full year of business, was $1563 on revenues of $5369. They worked on counter-radar technology and artillery shell proximity fuzes during World War II, which allowed Packard (but not Hewlett) to be exempt from the draft. Hewlett served as an officer in the Army Signal Corps after being called to active duty. In 1942, they built their first building at 395 Page Mill Road and were awarded the Army-Navy \\"E\\" Award in 1943. HP's line of products during the war included the audio oscillator, a wave analyzer, distortion analyzers, an audio-signal generator, and the Model 400A vacuum-tube voltmeter, and employed 200 people. In 1947, the company incorporated with Packard as president. He handed the presidency over to Hewlett when he became chairman in 1964, but remained CEO of the company. Sales reached $5.5 million in 1951 with 215 employees. In 1959, a manufacturing plant was established in B√∂blingen and a marketing organization in Geneva. 1960s The HP200A, a precision audio oscillator, was the company's very first financially successful product. HP is recognized as the symbolic founder of Silicon Valley, although it did not actively investigate semiconductor devices until a few years after the \\"traitorous eight\\" had abandoned William Shockley to create Fairchild Semiconductor in 1957. Hewlett-Packard's HP Associates division, established around 1960, developed semiconductor devices primarily for internal use. HP Associates was co-founded by another former Bell Labs researcher, MOSFET (MOS transistor) inventor Mohamed Atalla, who served as Director of Semiconductor Research. Instruments and calculators were some of the products using semiconductor devices from HP Associates. During the 1960s, HP partnered with Sony and the Yokogawa Electric companies in Japan to develop several high-quality products. The products were not a huge success, as there were high costs involved in building HP-looking products in Japan. In 1963, HP and Yokogawa formed the joint venture Yokogawa-Hewlett-Packard to market HP products in Japan. HP bought Yokogawa Electric's share of Hewlett-Packard Japan in 1999. HP spun off the small company Dynac to specialize in digital equipment. The name was picked so that the HP logo could be turned upside down to be a reflected image of the logo of the new company. Eventually, Dynac was renamed Dymec, and was folded back into HP in 1959. HP experimented with using Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) minicomputers with its instruments, but after deciding that it would be easier to build another small design team than deal with DEC, HP entered the computer market in 1966 with the HP 2100 / HP 1000 series of minicomputers. These had a simple accumulator-based design, with two accumulator registers and, in the HP 1000 models, two index registers. The series was produced for 20 years, in spite of several attempts to replace it, and was a forerunner of the HP 9800 and HP 250 series of desktop and business computers. At the end of 1968, co-founder Packard handed over the duties of CEO to Hewlett to become United States Deputy Secretary of Defense in the incoming Nixon administration. He resumed the chairmanship in 1972 and served until 1993, but Hewlett remained the CEO. 1970s Hewlett-Packard logo used from 1964 to 1979 The HP 3000 was an advanced stack-based design for a business computing server, later redesigned with RISC technology. The HP 2640 series of smart and intelligent terminals introduced forms-based interfaces to ASCII terminals, and also introduced screen labeled function keys, now commonly used on gas pumps and bank ATMs. The HP 2640 series included one of the first bit mapped graphics displays that when combined with the HP 2100 21MX F-Series microcoded Scientific Instruction Set enabled the first commercial WYSIWYG Presentation Program, BRUNO that later became the program HP-Draw on the HP 3000. Although scoffed at in the formative days of computing, HP would eventually surpass even IBM as the world's largest technology vendor, in terms of sales. Introduced in 1968, \\"The new Hewlett- Packard 9100A personal computer is ready, willing, and able ... to relieve you of waiting to get on the big computer.\\" HP is identified by Wired magazine as the producer of the world's first device to be called a personal computer: the Hewlett-Packard 9100A, introduced in 1968. HP called it a desktop calculator because, as Bill Hewlett said, \\"If we had called it a computer, it would have been rejected by our customers' computer gurus because it didn't look like an IBM. We therefore decided to call it a calculator, and all such nonsense disappeared.\\" An engineering triumph at the time, the logic circuit was produced without any integrated circuits; the assembly of the CPU having been entirely executed in discrete components. With CRT display, magnetic-card storage, and printer, the price was around $5,000. The machine's keyboard was a cross between that of a scientific calculator and an adding machine. There was no alphabetic keyboard. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak originally designed the Apple I computer while working at HP and offered it to them under their right of first refusal to his work; they did not take it up as the company wanted to stay in scientific, business, and industrial markets. Wozniak said that HP \\"turned him down five times\\", but that his loyalty to HP made him hesitant to start Apple with Steve Jobs. The company earned global respect for a variety of products. They introduced the world's first handheld scientific electronic calculator in 1972 (the HP-35), the first handheld programmable in 1974 (the HP-65), the first alphanumeric, programmable, expandable in 1979 (the HP-41C), and the first symbolic and graphing calculator, the HP-28C. Like their scientific and business calculators, their oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and other measurement instruments have a reputation for sturdiness and usability (the latter products are now part of spin-off Agilent's product line, which were later spun off from Agilent as Keysight Technologies). The company's design philosophy in this period was summarized as \\"design for the guy at the next bench\\". The HP 9800 series of technical desktop computers started in 1975 with the 9815, and the cheaper HP series 80, again of technical computers, started in 1979 with the 85. These machines used a version of the BASIC programming language which was available immediately after they were switched on, and used a proprietary magnetic tape for storage. HP computers were similar in capabilities to the much later IBM Personal Computer, although the limitations of available technology forced prices to be high. In 1978 co-founder Hewlett stepped down as CEO and was succeeded by John A. Young. 1980s Hewlett-Packard logo used from 1979 to 2010 Logo with the word \\"invent\\" on the bottom Sales reach $6.5 billion in 1985 with 85,000 employees. In 1984, HP introduced both inkjet and laser printers for the desktop. Along with its scanner product line, these have later been developed into successful multifunction products, the most significant being single-unit printer/scanner/copier/fax machines. The print mechanisms in HP's tremendously popular LaserJet line of laser printers depend almost entirely on Canon Inc.'s components (print engines), which in turn use technology developed by Xerox. HP develops the hardware, firmware, and software to convert data into dots for printing. On March 3, 1986, HP registered the HP.com domain name, making it the ninth Internet .com domain ever to be registered. In 1987, the Palo Alto garage where Hewlett and Packard started their business was designated as a California State historical landmark. 1990s In the 1990s, HP expanded their computer product line, which initially had been targeted at university, research, and business users, to reach consumers. HP also grew through acquisitions. It bought Apollo Computer in 1989 and Convex Computer in 1995. In 1992,CEO John Young was succeeded by Lewis E. Platt, and in 1993 and co- founders Hewlett and Packard stepped down from the board with Platt succeeding Packard as chairman. Later in the decade, HP opened hpshopping.com as an independent subsidiary to sell online, direct to consumers; in 2005, the store was renamed \\"HP Home & Home Office Store.\\" From 1995 to 1998, Hewlett-Packard were sponsors of the English football team Tottenham Hotspur. In 1999, all of the businesses not related to computers, storage, and imaging were spun off from HP to form Agilent Technologies. Agilent's spin-off was the largest initial public offering in the history of Silicon Valley.Arensman, Russ. \\"Unfinished business: managing one of the biggest spin-offs in corporate history would be a challenge even in the best of times. But what Agilent's Ned Barnholt got was the worst of times. (Cover Story).\\" Electronic Business 28.10 (October 2002): 36(6). The spin-off created an $8 billion company with about 30,000 employees, manufacturing scientific instruments, semiconductors, optical networking devices, and electronic test equipment for telecom and wireless R&D; and production. In July 1999, HP appointed Carly Fiorina, formerly of AT&T; and Lucent, as the first female CEO of a Fortune-20 company in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Fiorina received a larger signing offer than any of her predecessors. Fiorina served as CEO during the technology downturn of the early 2000s and led the merger with Compaq that was \\"disastrous\\", according to CNN and led to the firing of 30,000 U.S. employees. Under her leadership, the company doubled in size. Her tenure as CEO was beset by damaging leaks. The HP Board of Directors asked Fiorina to step down in 2005 following a boardroom disagreement, and she resigned on February 9, 2005. =Sales to Iran despite sanctions= In 1997, HP started selling its products in Iran through an European subsidiary and a Dubai-based Middle Eastern distributor, despite U.S. export sanctions prohibiting such deals imposed by Bill Clinton's executive orders issued in 1995. The story was initially reported by The Boston Globe, and it triggered an inquiry by the SEC. HP responded that products worth 120 million were sold in fiscal year 2008 for distribution by way of Redington Gulf, a company based in the Netherlands, and that as these sales took place through a foreign subsidiary, HP had not violated sanctions. HP named Redington Gulf \\"Wholesaler of the Year\\" in 2003, which in turn published a press release stating that \\"[t]he seeds of the Redington-Hewlett-Packard relationship were sowed six years ago for one market ‚Äî Iran.\\" At that time, Redington Gulf had only three employees whose sole purpose was to sell HP products to the Iran market. According to former officials who worked on sanctions, HP was using a loophole by routing their sales through a foreign subsidiary. HP ended its relationship with Redington Gulf after the SEC inquiry. 2000‚Äì2005 Deskjet 3845 printer On September 3, 2001, HP announced that an agreement had been reached with Compaq to merge the two companies. In May 2002, after passing a shareholder vote, HP officially merged with Compaq. Prior to this, plans had been in place to consolidate the companies' product teams and product lines. Compaq had already taken over Tandem Computers in 1997 and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998. HP therefore still offers support for the former Tandem NonStop family and Digital Equipment products PDP-11, VAX and AlphaServer. The merger occurred after a proxy fight with Bill Hewlett's son Walter, who objected to the merger. Compaq itself had bought Tandem Computers in 1997 (which had been started by ex-HP employees), and Digital Equipment Corporation in 1998. Following this strategy, HP became a major player in desktops, laptops, and servers for many different markets. After the merger with Compaq, the new ticker symbol became \\"HPQ\\", a combination of the two previous symbols, \\"HWP\\" and \\"CPQ\\", to show the significance of the alliance and also key letters from the two companies Hewlett-Packard and Compaq (the latter company being famous for its \\"Q\\" logo on all of its products). In 2004, HP released the DV 1000 Series, including the HP Pavilion dv 1658 and 1040 two years later in May 2006, HP began its campaign, \\"The Computer is Personal Again\\". The campaign was designed to bring back the fact that the PC is a personal product. The campaign utilized viral marketing, sophisticated visuals and its own website (www.hp.com/personal). Some of the ads featured Pharrell, Petra Nemcova, Mark Burnett, Mark Cuban, Alicia Keys, Jay-Z, Gwen Stefani, and Shaun White. In January 2005, following years of under performance, which included HP's Compaq merger that fell short, and disappointing earning reports, the board asked Fiorina to resign as chair and chief executive officer of the company. Following the news of Fiorina's departure, HP's stock jumped 6.9 percent. Robert Wayman, chief financial officer of HP, served as interim CEO while the board undertook a formal search for a replacement. Mark Hurd of NCR Corporation was hired to take over as CEO and president, effective 1 April 2005. Hurd was the board's top choice given the revival of NCR that took place under his leadership. 2006‚Äì2009 A sign marking the entrance to the HP corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California, 2006 iPAQ 112 Pocket PC from 2008 In 2006, HP unveiled several new products including desktops, enhanced notebooks, a workstation and software to manage them, OpenView Client Configuration Manager 2.0. In the same year, HP's share price skyrocketed due to consistent results in the last couple quarters of the year with Hurd's plan to cutback HP's workforce and lower costs. In July 2007, HP signed a definitive agreement to acquire Opsware in a cash tender deal that values the company at $14.25 per share. This combined Opsware software with the Oracle enterprise IT management software. In the first few years of Hurd's new role, HP's stock price more than doubled. By the end of Fiscal 2007, HP hit the $100 Billion mark for the first time. The company's annual revenue reached $104 Billion, allowing HP to overtake competitor IBM. On May 13, 2008, HP and Electronic Data Systems (EDS) announced that they had signed a definitive agreement under which HP would purchase EDS. On June 30, HP announced that the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 had expired. \\"The transaction still requires EDS stockholder approval and regulatory clearance from the European Commission and other non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other closing conditions specified in the merger agreement.\\" The agreement was finalized on August 26, 2008 at $13 billion, and it was publicly announced that EDS would be re-branded \\"EDS a HP company.\\" The first targeted layoff of 24,600 former EDS workers was announced on September 15, 2008. (The company's 2008 Annual Report gave the number as 24,700, to be completed by end of 2009.) This round was factored into purchase price as a $19.5 billion liability against goodwill. As of September 23, 2009, EDS is known as HP Enterprise Services. On November 11, 2009, 3Com and Hewlett-Packard announced that Hewlett-Packard would be acquiring 3Com for $2.7 billion in cash. The acquisition is one of the biggest in size among a series of takeovers and acquisitions by technology giants to push their way to become one-stop shops. Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007, tech giants have constantly felt the pressure to expand beyond their current market niches. Dell purchased Perot Systems recently to invade into the technology consulting business area previously dominated by IBM. Hewlett-Packard's latest move marked its incursion into enterprise networking gear market dominated by Cisco. 2010‚Äì2012 A Hewlett-Packard Mini 1000 netbook computer, a type of notebook computer On April 28, 2010, Palm, Inc. and Hewlett-Packard announced that HP would buy Palm for $1.2 billion in cash and debt. Before this announcement, it was rumored that either HTC, Dell, Research in Motion or HP would buy Palm. Adding Palm handsets to the HP product line created some overlap with the iPAQ series of mobile devices but was thought to significantly improve HP's mobile presence as iPAQ devices had not been selling well. Buying Palm gave HP a library of valuable patents, as well as the mobile operating platform known as webOS. On July 1, 2010, the acquisition of Palm was final. The purchase of Palm's webOS began a big gamble ‚Äì to build HP's own ecosystem. On July 1, 2011, HP launched its first tablet named HP TouchPad, bringing webOS to tablet devices. On September 2, 2010, HP won its bidding war for 3PAR with a $33 a share offer ($2.07 billion) which Dell declined to match. After HP's acquisition of Palm, it phased out the Compaq brand. On August 6, 2010, CEO Mark Hurd resigned amid controversy and CFO Cathie Lesjak assumed the role of interim CEO. Hurd had turned HP around and was widely regarded as one of Silicon Valley's star CEOs. Under his leadership, HP became the largest computer company in the world when measured by total revenue. Accused of sexual harassment against a colleague, the allegations were deemed baseless. The investigation led to questions concerning between $1000 and $20000 of his private expenses and his lack of disclosure related to the friendship. Some observers have argued that Hurd was innocent, but the board asked for his resignation to avoid negative PR. Public analysis was divided between those who saw it as a commendable tough action by HP in handling expenses irregularities, and those who saw it as an ill- advised, hasty and expensive reaction, in ousting a remarkably capable leader who had turned the business around. At HP, Hurd oversaw a series of acquisitions worth over $20 billion. This allowed the company to expand into services of networking equipment and smartphones. Shares of HP dropped by 8.4% in after-hours trading, hitting a 52-week low with $9 billion in market capitalization shaved off. Larry Ellison publicly attacked HP's board for his ousting, stating that the HP board had \\"made the worst personnel decision since the idiots on the Apple board fired Steve Jobs many years ago.\\" On September 30, 2010, L√©o Apotheker was named as HP's new CEO and President. Apotheker's appointment sparked a strong reaction from Oracle chief executive Larry Ellison, who complained that Apotheker had been in charge of SAP when one of its subsidiaries was systematically stealing software from Oracle. SAP accepted that its subsidiary, which has now closed, illegally accessed Oracle intellectual property. Following Hurd's departure, HP was seen by the market as problematic, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services. Apotheker's strategy was broadly to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector. On August 18, 2011, HP announced that it would strategically exit the smartphone and tablet computer business, focusing on higher-margin \\"strategic priorities of Cloud, solutions and software with an emphasis on enterprise, commercial and government markets\\" They also contemplated selling off their personal computer division or spinning it off into a separate company, quitting the 'PC' business, while continuing to sell servers and other equipment to business customers, was a strategy already undertaken by IBM in 2005. HP's stock continued to drop, by about a further 40% (including 25% on one day, August 19, 2011), after the company abruptly announced a number of decisions: to discontinue its webOS device business (mobile phones and tablet computers), the intent to sell its personal computer division (at the time HP was the largest personal computer manufacturer in the world), and to acquire British big data software firm Autonomy for a 79% premium, seen externally as an \\"absurdly high\\" price for a business with known concerns over its accounts. Media analysts described HP's actions as a \\"botched strategy shift\\" and a \\"chaotic\\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings that ultimately cost Apotheker his job.Why Hewlett-Packard's Impulse Buy Didn't Pay Off, Bloomberg BusinessWeek November 29, 2012: \\"Apotheker believed that HP's platform was sinking ... [and] appeared to be in a hurry to transform the company ... In a rapid series of moves announced in August 2011, Apotheker killed HP's six-week-old TouchPad tablet, explored plans for a spin-out of its PC business, and championed the $10.3 billion acquisition of Autonomy. One former HP executive who worked there at the time says it appeared that Apotheker and the board didn't know what to do, and were trying anything they could think of. It wasn't a strategy, he says. It was chaos ... Oracle CEO Larry Ellison called Autonomy's asking price 'absurdly high'.\\"' The Autonomy acquisition had been objected to even by HP's own CFO.Rage of the Titans: Whitman vs Lynch, The Daily Telegraph, November 25, 2012 On September 22, 2011, the HP Board of Directors fired Apotheker as chief executive, effective immediately, and replaced him with fellow board member and former eBay chief Meg Whitman, with Raymond J.

Weeks later, HP announced that a review had concluded their PC division was too integrated and critical to business operations, and the company reaffirmed their commitment to the Personal Systems Group. A year later in November 2012 wrote-down almost $9 billion related to the Autonomy acquisition (see below: Takeover of Autonomy), which became the subject of intense litigation as HP accused Autonomy's previous management of fraudulently exaggerating Autonomy's financial position and called in law enforcement and regulators in both countries, and Autonomy's previous management accused HP of \\"textbook\\" obfuscation and finger pointing to protect HP's executives from criticism and conceal HP culpability, their prior knowledge of Autonomy's financial position, and gross mismanagement of Autonomy after acquisition.Motion by Hussain, 2014-08-11 p.1-6 On March 21, 2012, HP said its printing and PC divisions would become one unit headed by Todd Bradley from the PC division. Printing chief Vyomesh Joshi is leaving the company. On May 23, 2012, HP announced plans to lay off approximately 27,000 employees, after posting a profit decline of 31% in the second quarter of 2012. The profit decline is on account of the growing popularity of smart phones, tablets, and other mobile devices, that has slowed the sale of personal computers. On May 30, 2012, HP unveiled its first net zero energy data center. HP data center plans to use solar energy and other renewable sources instead of traditional power grids. On July 10, 2012, HP's Server Monitoring Software was discovered to have a previously unknown security vulnerability. A security warning was given to customers about two vulnerabilities, and a patch released. One month later, HP's official site of training center was hacked and defaced by a Pakistani hacker known as \\"Hitcher\\", to demonstrate a Web vulnerability. On September 10, 2012, HP revised their restructuring figures; they started cutting 29,000 jobs. HP had already cut 3,800 jobs as of July 2012,around 7 percent of the revised 29,000 figure. 2013‚Äì2015 On December 31, 2013, HP revised the number of jobs cut from 29,000 to 34,000 up to October 2014. The current number of jobs cut until the end of 2013 was 24,600. At the end of 2013 the company had 317,500 employees. On May 22, 2014 HP announced it would cut a further 11,000 to 16,000 jobs, in addition to the 34,000 announced in 2013. \\"We are gradually shaping HP into a more nimble, lower-cost, more customer and partner-centric company that can successfully compete across a rapidly changing IT landscape,\\" CEO Meg Whitman said at the time. In June 2014, during the HP Discover customer event in Las Vegas, Meg Whitman and Martin Fink announced a project for a radically new computer architecture called The Machine. Based on memristors and silicon photonics, The Machine is supposed to come in commercialization before the end of the decade, meanwhile representing 75% of the research activity in HP Labs. On October 6, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced it was planning to split into two separate companies, separating its personal computer and printer businesses from its technology services. The split, which was first reported by The Wall Street Journal and confirmed by other media, would result in two publicly traded companies: Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc. Meg Whitman would serve as chairman of HP Inc. and CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Patricia Russo would be chairman of the enterprise business, and Dion Weisler would be CEO of HP, Inc. On October 29, 2014, Hewlett-Packard announced their new Sprout personal computer. In May 2015, the company announced it would be selling its controlling 51 percent stake in its Chinese data-networking business to Tsinghua Unigroup for a fee of at least $2.4 billion. On November 1, 2015, as previously announced, Hewlett-Packard changed its name to HP Inc. and spun off Hewlett Packard Enterprise as a new publicly traded company.

In November 2011, HP secured the 1st place (out of 15) in this ranking (climbing up 3 places) with an increased score of 5.9 (up from 5.5). It scored most points on the new Sustainable Operations criteria, having the best program for measuring and reducing emissions of greenhouse gases from its suppliers and scoring maximum points for its thorough paper procurement policy. In the November 2012 report, HP was ranked second, with a score of 5.7. HP does especially well for its disclosure of externally verified greenhouse gas emissions and its setting of targets for reducing them. However, Greenpeace reports that HP risks a penalty point in future editions due to the fact that it is a member of trade associations that have commented against energy efficiency standards.

Spying scandal On September 5, 2006, Shawn Cabalfin and David O'Neil of Newsweek wrote that HP's general counsel, at the behest of chairwoman Patricia Dunn, contracted a team of independent security experts to investigate board members and several journalists in order to identify the source of an information leak. In turn, those security experts recruited private investigators who used a spying technique known as pretexting. The pretexting involved investigators impersonating HP board members and nine journalists (including reporters for CNET, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal) in order to obtain their phone records. The information leaked related to HP's long-term strategy and was published as part of a CNET article in January 2006. Most HP employees accused of criminal acts have since been acquitted. Hardware In November 2007, Hewlett-Packard released a BIOS update covering a wide range of laptops with the intent to speed up the computer fan as well as have it run constantly, whether the computer was on or off. The reason was to prevent the overheating of defective Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) that had been shipped to many of the original equipment manufacturers, including Hewlett- Packard, Dell, and Apple. The defect concerned the new packaging material used by Nvidia from 2007 onwards in joining the graphics chip onto the motherboard, which did not perform well under thermal cycling and was prone to develop stress cracks ‚Äì effectively severing the connection between the GPU and the motherboard, leading to a blank screen. In July 2008, HP issued an extension to the initial one-year warranty to replace the motherboards of selected models. However this option was not extended to all models with the defective Nvidia chipsets despite research showing that these computers were also affected by the fault. Furthermore, the replacement of the motherboard was a temporary fix, since the fault was inherent in all units of the affected models from the point of manufacture, including the replacement motherboards offered by HP as a free 'repair'. Since this point, several websites have been documenting the issue, most notably www.hplies.com, a forum dedicated to what they refer to as Hewlett-Packard's \\"multi-million dollar cover up\\" of the issue, and www.nvidiadefect.com, which details the specifics of the fault and offers advice to the owners of affected computers. There have been several small-claims lawsuits filed in several states, as well as suits filed in other countries. Hewlett-Packard also faced a class-action lawsuit in 2009 over its i7 processor computers. The complainants stated that their systems locked up within 30 minutes of powering on, consistently. Even after being replaced with newer i7 systems, the lockups continued. Lawsuit against Oracle On June 15, 2011, HP filed a lawsuit in California Superior Court in Santa Clara, claiming that Oracle Corporation had breached an agreement to support the Itanium microprocessor used in HP's high-end enterprise servers. On June 15, 2011, HP sent a \\"formal legal demand\\" letter to Oracle in an attempt to force the world's No. 3 software maker to reverse its decision to discontinue software development on Intel Itanium microprocessor and build its own servers. HP won the lawsuit in 2012, requiring Oracle to continue to produce software compatible with the Itanium processor. HP was awarded $3 billion in damages against Oracle on June 30, 2016. HP argued Oracle's canceling support damaged HP Itanium server brand. Oracle has announced it will appeal both the decision and damages. Takeover of Autonomy In November 2012, HP recorded a writedown of around $8.8 billion related to its acquisition a year earlier of the UK based Autonomy Corporation PLC. HP accused Autonomy of deliberately inflating the value of the company prior to its takeover. The former management team of Autonomy flatly rejected the charge. At the time, HP had fired its previous CEO for expenses irregularities a year before, and appointed L√©o Apotheker as CEO and President. HP was seen as problematic by the market, with margins falling and having failed to redirect and establish itself in major new markets such as cloud and mobile services. Apotheker's strategy was to aim at disposing of hardware and moving into the more profitable software services sector. As part of this strategy, Autonomy was acquired by HP in October 2011. HP paid $10.3 billion for 87.3% of the shares, valuing Autonomy at around $11.7 billion (¬£7.4 billion) overall, a premium of around 79% over market price. The deal was widely criticized as \\"absurdly high\\", a \\"botched strategy shift\\" and a \\"chaotic\\" attempt to rapidly reposition HP and enhance earnings, and had been objected to even by HP's own CFO. Within a year, Apotheker himself had been fired, major culture clashes became apparent and HP had written off $8.8 billion of Autonomy's value. HP claim this resulted from \\"accounting improprieties, misrepresentations and disclosure failures\\" by the previous management, who in turn accuse HP of a \\"textbook example of defensive stalling\\" to conceal evidence of its own prior knowledge and gross mismanagement and undermining of the company, noting public awareness since 2009 of its financial reporting issues and that even HP's CFO disagreed with the price paid. External observers generally state that only a small part of the write-off appears to be due to accounting mis- statements, and that HP had overpaid for businesses previously.The mysterious case of Hewlett-Packard's Autonomy deal, Marketwatch, August 19, 2014 The Serious Fraud Office (United Kingdom), and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission joined the FBI in investigating the potential anomalies. HP incurred much damage with its stock falling to decades' low. Three lawsuits were brought by shareholders against HP, for the fall in value of HP shares. In August 2014 a United States district court judge threw out a proposed settlement, which Autonomy's previous management had argued would be collusive and intended to divert scrutiny of HP's own responsibility and knowledge, by essentially engaging the plaintiff's attorneys from the existing cases and redirecting them against the previous Autonomy vendors and management, for a fee of up to $48 million, with plaintiffs agreeing to end any claims against HP's management and similarly redirect those claims against the previous Autonomy vendors and management. In January 2015 the SFO closed its investigation as the likelihood of a successful prosecution was low. The dispute is still being litigated in the US, and is being investigated by the UK and Ireland Financial Reporting Council. On June 9, 2015, HP agreed to pay $100 million to investors who bought HP shares between August 19, 2011, and November 20, 2012 to settle the suite over Autonomy purchase. Another term of the shareholder settlement was to sue Autonomy management. This trial took place in London in 2019. In a trial that lasted 93 days with 58 witnesses, HP \\"failed to produce a smoking gun for the fraud it alleges.\\" HP's own accountants admitted that they \\"never formally prepared anything to attribute the irregularities to the amount of the fraud.\\" Israeli settlements On October 25, 2012, Richard Falk, the Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967, called for boycotting HP together with other \\"businesses that are profiting from Israeli settlements on occupied Palestinian lands until they brought their operations in line with international human rights and humanitarian law\\". In 2014, the Presbyterian Church voted to move forward with divestment from HP to pressure Israeli in regards to their policies toward Palestinians. In 2015, the City of Portland's Human Rights Commission requested to place Caterpillar, G4S, Hewlett-Packard, and Motorola Solutions on the city's \\"Do Not Buy\\" list. Bribery On April 9, 2014, an administrative proceeding before Securities and Exchange Commission was settled by HP consenting to an order acknowledging that HP had violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) when HP subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and Mexico made improper payments to government officials to obtain or retain lucrative public contracts. The SEC's order finds that HP's subsidiary in Russia paid more than $2 million through agents and various shell companies to a Russian government official to retain a multimillion-dollar contract with the federal prosecutor's office. In Poland, HP's subsidiary provided gifts and cash bribes worth more than $600,000 to a Polish government official to obtain contracts with the national police agency. And as part of its bid to win a software sale to Mexico's state-owned petroleum company, HP's subsidiary in Mexico paid more than $1 million in inflated commissions to a consultant with close ties to company officials, and money was funneled to one of those officials. HP agreed to pay $108 million to settle the SEC charges and a parallel criminal case.

It was created by the Government of People's Republic of Bangladesh under the Microcredit Regulatory Authority Act (Act no. 32 of 2006). License from the Authority is mandatory to operate microfinance operation in Bangladesh as an NGO. On September 28, 2012 at the Alliance for Financial Inclusion's Global Policy Forum 2012, the bank made a commitment under the Maya Declaration to promote agent and mobile banking, implement consumer protection initiatives, and establish a credit bureau for the MFI sector.  Microcredit in Bangladesh  The microcredit program in Bangladesh is implemented by NGOs, Grameen Bank, different types of government-owned banks, private commercial banks, and specialized programs of some ministries of the Bangladesh Government, etc. Despite the fact that more than a thousand institutions are operating microcredit programs, only 10 large Microcredit Institutions (MFIs) and Grameen Bank represent 87% of total savings of the sector (around BD taka 93 billion) and 81% of total outstanding loans of the sector (around BD taka 157.82 billion). Nearly two hundred thousand people are employed in MFIs and Grameen Bank. Around 30 million poor people are directly benefiting from microcredit programs. Through the financial services of microcredit, these poor people are engaging themselves in various income generating activities. At present, financial service of BD taka 160 billion (approx.) is being rendered among 30 million poor people which help them to be self-employed which helps to accelerate the overall economic development process of the country. Microcredit institutions have been providing various social and financial services to the poor to alleviate poverty within the society for the last three decades. However, they remained outside any central supervisory system. To bring the microcredit sector under a regulatory framework, the government of Bangladesh enacted the ‚ÄúMicrocredit Regulatory Authority Act, 2006‚Äù on July 16, 2006 with effect from August 27, 2006. The Microcredit Regulatory Authority has been established under this Act and is empowered and responsible for monitoring and supervising the microcredit activities of the MFIs. According to the Act, no MFI can operate microcredit programs without obtaining a licence from MRA. Within the stipulated period, 4,236 microcredit institutions applied for a licence. Among them, 335 microcredit institutions have been licensed until September 2008. Applications by 438 institutions could not be considered. 2,599 small institutions are advised to fulfil minimum criteria of obtaining a licence (either minimum balance of outstanding loan at field level BD taka four million or minimum borrower 1,000) within June 2009.  Legal requirement to be an NGO-MFI  The organization/person willing to operate microcredit activities in Bangladesh shall submit an application to the MRA in the prescribed form and manner after getting registration as an NGO under any of the following acts: * The Societies Registration Act, 1860 (Act XXI of 1860); * The Trust Act, 1882 (Act II of 1882); * The Voluntary Social Welfare Agencies (Registration and Control) Ordinance, 1961 (Ordinance No. XLVI of 1961); * The Companies Act, 1994 (Act XVIII of 1994).

A Unix-like application is one that behaves like the corresponding Unix command or shell. There is no standard for defining the term, and some difference of opinion is possible as to the degree to which a given operating system or application is \\"Unix-like\\". The term can include free and open-source operating systems inspired by Bell Labs' Unix or designed to emulate its features, commercial and proprietary work-alikes, and even versions based on the licensed UNIX source code (which may be sufficiently \\"Unix-like\\" to pass certification and bear the \\"UNIX\\" trademark).  Definition  The Open Group owns the UNIX trademark and administers the Single UNIX Specification, with the \\"UNIX\\" name being used as a certification mark. They do not approve of the construction \\"Unix-like\\", and consider it a misuse of their trademark. Their guidelines require \\"UNIX\\" to be presented in uppercase or otherwise distinguished from the surrounding text, strongly encourage using it as a branding adjective for a generic word such as \\"system\\", and discourage its use in hyphenated phrases. Other parties frequently treat \\"Unix\\" as a genericized trademark. Some add a wildcard character to the name to make an abbreviation like \\"Un*x\\" or \\"*nix\\", since Unix-like systems often have Unix-like names such as AIX, A/UX, HP-UX, IRIX, Linux, Minix, Ultrix, Xenix, and XNU. These patterns do not literally match many system names, but are still generally recognized to refer to any UNIX system, descendant, or work-alike, even those with completely dissimilar names such as Darwin/macOS, illumos/Solaris or FreeBSD. In 2007, Wayne R. Gray sued to dispute the status of UNIX as a trademark, but lost his case, and lost again on appeal, with the court upholding the trademark and its ownership.  History  Simplified history of Unix-like operating systems \\"Unix-like\\" systems started to appear in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Many proprietary versions, such as Idris (1978), UNOS (1982), Coherent (1983), and UniFlex (1985), aimed to provide businesses with the functionality available to academic users of UNIX. When AT&T; allowed relatively inexpensive commercial binary sub-licensing of UNIX in 1979, a variety of proprietary systems were developed based on it, including AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, SunOS, Tru64, Ultrix, and Xenix. These largely displaced the proprietary clones. Growing incompatibility among these systems led to the creation of interoperability standards, including POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification. Various free, low-cost, and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, including 4.4BSD, Linux, and Minix. Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial \\"Unix-like\\" systems, such as BSD/OS and macOS. Several versions of (Mac) OS X/macOS running on Intel-based Mac computers have been certified under the Single UNIX Specification. The BSD variants are descendants of UNIX developed by the University of California at Berkeley with UNIX source code from Bell Labs. However, the BSD code base has evolved since then, replacing all of the AT&T; code. Since the BSD variants are not certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification, they are referred to as \\"UNIX-like\\" rather than \\"UNIX\\".  Categories  Dennis Ritchie, one of the original creators of Unix, expressed his opinion that Unix-like systems such as Linux are de facto Unix systems.Interview with Dennis M. Ritchie Manuel Benet, LinuxFocus, July 1999 Eric S. Raymond and Rob Landley have suggested that there are three kinds of Unix-like systems:The meaning of 'Unix' Eric Raymond and Rob Landley, OSI Position Paper on the SCO-vs.-IBM Complaint  Genetic UNIX  Those systems with a historical connection to the AT&T; codebase. Most commercial UNIX systems fall into this category. So do the BSD systems, which are descendants of work done at the University of California, Berkeley in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these systems have no original AT&T; code but can still trace their ancestry to AT&T; designs.  Trademark or branded UNIX  These systemslargely commercial in naturehave been determined by the Open Group to meet the Single UNIX Specification and are allowed to carry the UNIX name. Most such systems are commercial derivatives of the System V code base in one form or another, although Apple macOS 10.5 and later is a BSD variant that has been certified, EulerOS and Inspur K-UX are Linux distributions that have been certified, and a few other systems (such as IBM z/OS) earned the trademark through a POSIX compatibility layer and are not otherwise inherently Unix systems. Many ancient UNIX systems no longer meet this definition.  Functional UNIX  Broadly, any Unix-like system that behaves in a manner roughly consistent with the UNIX specification, including having a \\"program which manages your login and command line sessions\\"; more specifically, this can refer to systems such as Linux or Minix that behave similarly to a UNIX system but have no genetic or trademark connection to the AT&T; code base. Most free/open-source implementations of the UNIX design, whether genetic UNIX or not, fall into the restricted definition of this third category due to the expense of obtaining Open Group certification, which costs thousands of dollars for commercial closed source systems. Around 2001, Linux was given the opportunity to get a certification including free help from the POSIX chair Andrew Josey for the symbolic price of one dollar. There have been some activities to make Linux POSIX-compliant, with Josey having prepared a list of differences between the POSIX standard and the Linux Standard Base specification, but in August 2005, this project was shut down because of missing interest at the LSB work group. Compatibility layers Some non- Unix-like operating systems provide a Unix-like compatibility layer, with varying degrees of Unix-like functionality. * IBM z/OS's UNIX System Services is sufficiently complete as to be certified as trademark UNIX. * Cygwin and MSYS both provide a GNU environment on top of the Microsoft Windows user API, sufficient for most common open source software to be compiled and run. * The MKS Toolkit and UWIN are comprehensive interoperability tools which allow the porting of Unix programs to Windows. * Windows NT-type systems have a POSIX environmental subsystem. * Subsystem for Unix-based Applications (previously Interix) provides Unix-like functionality as a Windows NT subsystem (discontinued). * Windows Subsystem for Linux provides a Linux-compatible kernel interface developed by Microsoft and containing no Linux code, with Ubuntu user-mode binaries running on top of it. Other means of Windows-Unix interoperability include: * The above Windows packages can be used with various X servers for Windows * Hummingbird Connectivity provides several ways for Windows machines to connect to Unix and Linux machines, from terminal emulators to X clients and servers, and others * The Windows Resource Kits for versions of Windows NT include a Bourne Shell, some command-line tools, and a version of Perl * Hamilton C shell is a version of csh written specifically for Windows.

The ship's boats moved troops ashore at H-hour, but to facilitate unloading her cargo, she moved into the harbor later in the day just long enough to unload at the one usable pier. Arcturus was still anchored off Fedhala on 12 November when the attacked. Arcturus escaped, but three other auxiliaries were destroyed. The cargo ship's boats rescued survivors before the Center Group got underway to avoid more submarine attacks. The ships entered Casablanca on 15 November, and Arcturus completed unloading her cargo of small arms ammunition. The ship joined a convoy on 17 November and returned to the United States, where she entered the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, for an overhaul that lasted until 18 December. Arcturus got underway from Norfolk on 27 December and joined a convoy carrying urgently needed supplies to the southwestern Pacific. Stopping first at Noum√©a, New Caledonia, on 27 January 1943 and then at Brisbane, Australia, four days later, Arcturus returned to the east coast immediately. Redesignated as an attack cargo ship AKA-1 on 1 February, she then underwent a repair availability at the Boston Navy Yard, from 13 March until 4 April. The ship then trained off the east coast with TF 85 in preparation for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Invasion of Sicily Arcturus crossed the Atlantic and formed up at Oran, Algeria, with the transports and escorts of \\"Cent\\" force under Rear Admiral Alan G. Kirk. By 8 July, the convoy was underway for Scoglitti, Sicily, where TF 85 was to land as part of a three-pronged attack. H-hour was set for 0245 on 10 July, but delays in organizing the convoy postponed the landing for one hour. As the first waves of boats moved toward the beaches, enemy torpedo bombers attacked. For almost an hour, torpedoes and bombs fell throughout the transport area, but neither Arcturus nor any other ship suffered hits. Landing craft casualties were great, however, because of the heavy surf, lack of recognizable landmarks, and inexperienced boat crews. During the night of 11 July and 12 July, another enemy air attack resulted in chaos as the transports and screening ships tried to defend themselves. American transport planes flew over immediately after the attack and were shot up badly by friendly fire. Unloading continued, and by the 13th, Arcturus was on her way back to Oran with the rest of the empty transports. Salerno The cargo ship remained at Oran while plans were firmed up for the landings at Salerno. On 5 September, Arcturus got underway with TF.81, the Southern Attack Force, under the command of Rear Admiral John L. Hall. In spite of repeated enemy air attacks, the convoys arrived off the Gulf of Salerno late on 8 September. By 0335 the next day, the first wave of boats was landing at Paestum. Unfortunately, in the hope of completely surprising the Germans, no prelanding bombardment preceded the boats, and many men in the landing craft were killed. The unloading progressed slowly as Arcturuss boats helped move troops and supplies shoreward. One of her boats was lost in crossfire from German machine gun emplacements, with seven men killed and four wounded. By the evening of 10 September, unloading was complete. Arcturus and 14 other empty cargo and transport ships sailed for Oran with an escort of 10 destroyers. Shortly after midnight, screening destroyer sighted a torpedo wake and pursued what was later determined to be a German E-boat. She lost it, and, as she rejoined the convoy, was hit by a torpedo from another E-boat and sank within one minute. The rest of the ships in the convoy proceeded to Oran without incident. Arcturus remained at anchor off the coast of Algeria until November when she steamed to the recently captured and cleared port of Naples for amphibious training. In December, the cargo ship joined a westbound convoy and sailed for the United States. High winds and heavy Atlantic seas tossed Arcturus unmercifully, causing a fire in the pyrotechnic locker and the loss of 5 inch ammunition on the after gundeck. For two days, the convoy fought the seas, but at last the storm broke, and the ships arrived safely in the United States, Arcturus put into the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 2 January 1944 and commenced a brief overhaul. Landings in southern France The cargo ship set sail on 27 February to rejoin the war effort in the Mediterranean. After several rehearsals at Salerno for the amphibious landings in southern France, Arcturus joined TF 85, the \\"Delta\\" Force in this operation, and stood off the designated beaches at La Nartelle on 15 August, awaiting H-hour, 0800. The assault progressed like a textbook drill due to excellent gunfire support, air cover, and experienced boat crews. The landing was unopposed. There were no casualties and no loss of landing craft Just as Arcturus weighed anchor to retire from the transport area, she received orders to take on wounded, mainly German prisoners of war. The cargo ship slipped out under cover of darkness and rejoined her convoy en route to Naples to discharge her passengers. Until late October, Arcturus carried cargo from Naples and Oran to Marseilles and St. Tropez as the Allies advanced up the Rhone River valley. Released from this assignment on 21 October, the cargo ship returned to the United States for overhaul at the Philadelphia Navy Yard beginning on 10 November. Battle of Okinawa Arcturus completed overhaul in mid-December and set course to join the action in the Pacific theater. Transiting the Panama Canal on 9 January 1945, the cargo ship arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 January and immediately unloaded her cargo. As soon as a new load was stowed on board, Arcturus got underway for Tulagi and Guadalcanal for training, rehearsals, and loading. She then steamed to Ulithi where she joined Transport Group \\"Baker\\" of the Northern Attack Force for the invasion of Okinawa. On 26 March, the ships stood out of Ulithi lagoon and set course for Okinawa. Arcturus anchored at her assigned location in the transport area off the Hagushi beaches in the early hours of 1 April, but waited five days before she could unload her cargo of gasoline and small arms ammunition. The transports and cargo ships retired seaward at night to minimize the clangor from kamikaze attacks. Many other ships were hit, but in her 14 days in the transport area, Arcturus suffered no damage. The cargo ship's gun crews were credited with two assists in shooting down enemy attackers. On 15 April, Arcturus received orders to Saipan where she was routed on to Pearl Harbor and San Francisco, arriving at the latter port on 18 May. After loading cargo and supplies, Arcturus returned to the western Pacific to resupply the troops advancing on Okinawa. After a brief stop at Eniwetok on 11 June, the cargo ship dropped anchor at Okinawa on 5 August. Enemy air attacks continued, but less frequently and with decreasing intensity. On 15 August, when Japan capitulated, Arcturus was still at Okinawa. She was then assigned to ferry occupation forces to Korea and China. On 5 September, the ship departed Okinawa in a convoy carrying Army troops and cargo to Jinsen, Korea. The convoy arrived at Jinsen on 8 September, and the occupation troops were joyfully received by the Koreans. Arcturus returned to Okinawa to load more cargo and troops but had to steam seaward to avoid a typhoon. Finally, on 19 September, she was again loaded with Marines and vehicles in convoy to Tientsin, China, where she anchored on 30 September. Arcturus ferried troops and equipment from Manila and Zamboanga in the Philippine Islands to China before receiving orders stateside. Decommissioning and sale The cargo ship got underway on 4 December from Shanghai, China, for Seattle, Washington, where she arrived on 22 December. No longer needed for service, Arcturus steamed to Portsmouth, Virginia, where she was decommissioned on 3 April 1946. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 5 June 1946. She was transferred to the Maritime Commission for disposal, and was sold to a Panamanian company on 24 June 1947. She began merchant service as SS Star Arcturus, and was scrapped in 1971.http://www.coltoncompany.com/shipbldg/ussbldrs/wwii/shipsbytype/cargoships.htm Arcturus was awarded five battle stars for her World War II service. Arcturus was featured in the first episode (Cocoon) of Hawaii 50 and a lot of scenes were filmed on board.

Founded in the early 1980s by guitarist Dave Gonzalez and his high school friend and double bass player Thomas Yearsley, they have recorded nine studio albums and built a reputation as a hard-working live band. Early years The Paladins started out as a rockabilly band during the rockabilly craze of the early 1980s. Their tagline at the time was \\"Western & Bop\\", as they played a combination of rockabilly and vintage country. Their lead singer and rhythm guitarist was Whit Broadly. With this lineup they did their first recording, a contribution to a 1982 local compilation album, Who's Listening?, and a song two years later on The Best of L.A. Rockabilly, a 1984 Rhino Records LP. Their first LP, The Paladins, was produced by Kim Wilson of the Fabulous Thunderbirds and was released in 1987 on Wrestler Records. Their second album, Years Since Yesterday, produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin and Mark Linnet, was released on Alligator Records in 1989 and had sold more than 20,000 copies by the end of the year; the band shot a music video for the title song at the Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, California for $30,000. Spending most of their time on the road, by 1989 they had already toured with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Los Lobos, The Blasters and the Fabulous Thunderbirds. They toured abroad as well; in the summer of 1989, between recording sessions for the third album, they played in Europe for the month of June, including shows at the Peer Music Festival in Belgium and the World Music Festival in London. 1990s In 1990 the Paladins released their third record, Let's Buzz, \\"an invigorating blend of rockabilly, blues, rhythm-and-blues and country\\" recorded in the Los Angeles studio of 1970s soul star Leon Haywood (who also played keyboards on the album), produced again by Steve Berlin and Mark Linnet and released by Alligator. Acclaim came with a nomination at the 1990 Entertainer Music Awards (San Diego County) for Best Rock 'n' Roll, Original Music, for which they were a critics' favorite (they lost out to Beat Farmers).\\"This trio has released three albums of infectious, foot-stompin' rockabilly, the last two on the nationally distributed Alligator Records label and their local shows are almost always sold out.\\" They won the award two years later, a year after winning the San Diego Music Awards. Touring continued relentlessly at home and abroad; in 1991, for instance, they toured Australia for three weeks. Shows were reviewed as fun, lively performances where band members would solo, swap instruments and even occasionally encourage audience members to play instruments. 2000s The Paladins appeared to have come to an end in 2004 when Gonzalez wanted to focus on different musical interests after having formed an alt-country band Hacienda Brothers. Thereafter a number of live albums and a live DVD were released with the band sometimes described as being \\"on hiatus.\\" While touring with his current band, the Stone River Boys, Gonzalez joined Yearsly and Brian Fahey at the Ink & Iron Festival in Long Beach, California in June 2011 for a Paladins reunion concert, the band's first US concert since 2005. The Paladins have reconnected, recorded new songs for an upcoming album, and have recently released a \\"Paladins - Best Of\\" album. They have played The Rhythm Collision Festival in Riverside,California, and have toured throughout Europe.

Construction of the line was commenced by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company and finished by the Public Works Department. The complete line, in length, opened in two sections; on 24 November 1893 to Tarukenga and the final to Rotorua on 8 December 1894. History The line was partially constructed by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company. The company began planning of the line from 1877, following the passing of the District Railways Act 1877. Construction of the Rotorua line did not begin until after its survey, from 1881. The survey took 12 months to find a suitable route to Rotorua over the Mamaku Ranges. The company only ever completed the section between Morrinsville and Tƒ´rau (called Oxford at that time), and this opened on 8 March 1886. The Government took over its operations in 1886. From this time onwards, the Public Works Department undertook construction of the line. The section to Lichfield on what is now the Kinleith Branch line was opened at the time of the Mount Tarawera eruption (21 June 1886). The line to Rotorua opened in 1893‚Äì4. At the same time George Vesey Stewart proposed a railway route between Tauranga and Rotorua, but this did not eventuate. The line from Rotorua was planned to become part of a line being built from Gisborne to link with Auckland via Te Teko and Rotorua. A Gisborne-Rotorua Line from Makaraka to Motu of about 37 miles (60 km) was authorised by the Railways Authorisation Act, 1904. However only the Gisborne end of this proposed line was started, which later became known as the Moutohora Branch and the proposal to connect it with Auckland was later changed to be with the East Coast Main Trunk line via Tauranga. The Rotorua line in its original form was a main line which ran from Morrinsville through to Rotorua. With the opening of the Kaimai Tunnel in 1978, the section of line between Morrinsville and Waharoa became part of the East Coast Main Trunk line between Hamilton and Kawerau, whilst the section of line between Waharoa and Kinleith became the Kinleith Branch line. The section of line between PutƒÅruru and Rotorua becoming the Rotorua Branch line. Services Two named passenger services operated on the line. The Rotorua Express was initiated in 1894 and in 1930 became the Rotorua Limited - the most prestigious train in New Zealand at that time. The service later reverted to the Rotorua Express with more stops; and in 1959 was replaced by 88-seater Fiat railcars, the NZR RM class. The Fiat railcar service ceased in 1968. In 1991 a new twice daily tourist-oriented service called the Geyserland Express was initiated, using Silver Fern railcars. This service lasted a decade and ceased in 2001. Freight on the line previously comprised forestry and livestock products railed north from Rotorua. Train loads north were limited by the Tarukenga Bank west of Rotorua between NgongotahƒÅ and Mamaku, with a steep ruling gradient of 1 in 35. The forestry industry operated numerous sawmills on the branch line; the largest was at Mamaku, which had its own bush tramway connecting to the NZR line. For many years after World War II sheep and cattle from land developments south of Rotorua were railed by special stock trains to the large abattoirs or freezing works in the South Auckland suburbs of Westfield and Southdown. Now there are local freezing works served by road transport, and stock numbers (particularly sheep) have reduced.Rails in the Hinterland: New Zealand‚Äôs Vanishing Railway Landscape by Euan McQueen p38 (2005, Grantham House, Wellington) Taupo extension proposals Extension of the line to Taup≈ç had been proposed several times over the years, primarily to take advantage of forestry traffic from the region. One such proposal got as far as the construction phase in 1928, however, due to the onset of the Great Depression, work ceased a year later in 1929. Paengaroa- Rotorua line proposal In 1968 NZR announced a proposal to construct a new line to Rotorua from Paengaroa on the East Coast Main Trunk, with an extension to the Waipa State Mill. An extension to Taupo was also seen by NZR \\"as being very attractive\\". This proposal followed from the recommendations of a 1963 Commission of Inquiry report to investigate \\"Improved Access by Land to the Port of Tauranga and Bay of Plenty\\", which recommended: * The construction of a deviation from Waharoa to Apata through the Kaimai Range, and the closure of the Paeroa to Apata section of the East Coast Main Trunk. * The construction of a Rotorua to Paengaroa deviation to eliminate the Mamaku Bank on the Rotorua Branch. * An extension of the Rotorua Branch to the Waipa State Mill. The proposal created much attention both in support and against the idea, in particular with the proposed siting of new marshalling yards at Ngapuna, together with extending the existing Rotorua Branch line with a level crossing across Fenton Street. The proposal became a hot political debate and by 1973 NZR started to back down on the proposal and the scheme fell through shortly after. Rotorua station relocation In 1989 the Rotorua central city station and rail yard was closed and, along with the last 2 km of the line, removed and relocated to a new site at Koutu. The Geyserland Express railcar service initially terminated in the Koutu freight yard until a small temporary passenger station operated by the Second Chance Train Trust opened on the northern side of the Lake Road overbridge in 1995. The new passenger station at Koutu was intended as temporary measure until the line could be relaid to a proposed new passenger station in the central city on the corner of Ranolf and Amohau Streets, which was being pursued by the Second Chance Train Trust and the Rotorua District Council. The new station never eventuated. Decline During the late 1990s traffic on the line gradually declined with the twice daily Geyserland Express railcar service being reduced in 1995 to a daily service with twice daily services on Fridays and Sundays only, and in 1996 being reduced to a daily service on all days. The nightly Bay Raider freight service was cancelled in 2000 and the Geyserland Express was cancelled in 2001. Since this time the line has fallen into disrepair, with slips, overgrown vegetation and sections of the line being stolen. In 2012, the Rotorua District Council demolished the Lake Road overbridge at Koutu to enable the widening of Lake Road to four lanes, to be built across the railway line at this locality. The new four lane road was built over the top of the track, which now separates the former Koutu freight yard from the main line. NZ Railways Corporation still own the rail corridor across the road south through to Pukuatua Street. The former rail corridor south of Pukuatua Street has since been relinquished and now been developed over in conjunction with a retail development on the neighbouring former Telecom depot site. Reopening On 13 January 2009, the Geyserland Express Trust announced that it had commissioned and received a report on the feasibility of reopening the line between Putaruru and Rotorua, which put the cost of doing so at $8.3 million. Work required included: * Clearing vegetation * Replacing missing sections of track * Rehabilitation of some of the bridges * Checking drains and culverts * Establishing a new station at Rotorua The interested parties planned to establish a working group to determine the level of demand and economic feasibility of services on the line. In December 2009 KiwiRail leased the Rotorua Branch line (Putaruru - Koutu) to the Rotorua Ngongotaha Rail Trust, which has since worked on plans to turn the unused corridor and track into a tourism venture. The trust has restored part of the line and did initially have discussions with the Rotorua District Council to assist with its plans to continue the national cycleway system in the District at the time of acquiring the line. The trust hopes that when the line is fully repaired, it will be possible for freight and passenger services to resume, with steam enthusiast operators from around New Zealand, able to bring their own excursion trains to Rotorua. Mamaku-based adventure tourism company Rail Riders have been granted a rail operating licence to run services on the Rotorua Branch. Working with KiwiRail and the Rotorua-Ngongotaha Rail Trust, the company operates its New Zealand-designed and built \\"rail cruisers\\" on a section of the branch line between Mamaku and Tarukenga (since 2011), with plans to later extend to Rotorua-Mamaku. They have constructed a station at Mamaku and plan to build another in Rotorua when services are extended there.

In the U.S. state of Tennessee, the U.S. Highway travels from the North Carolina state line, at Sam's Gap, north to the Virginia state line, in Kingsport. With a predominant concurrency with Interstate 26 (I-26), US 23 is a divided four-lane freeway that follows Corridor B of the Appalachian Development Highway System and serves as a major thoroughfare in the Tri-Cities. The entire route of US 23 in Tennessee is an interstate-grade freeway. Route description US 23, in concurrency with I-26, enters Unicoi County at Sam's Gap (el. ) and travels north along Stamp Ridge. Immediately after crossing the state line is a truck information station, signed \\"Truck Inspection,\\" which requires all trucks to go through before continuing. The following is a 6% grade descent, accompanied with two runaway truck ramps, into the South Indian Creek valley. Between mile markers 47-48 is a scenic overlook turnoff (northbound US 23/westbound I-26 only), followed by the I-26 Erwin/Unicoi County Welcome Center, located on Clear Branch Road exit. At Temple Hill, US 19W, traveling from Burnsville, joins in concurrency. After crossing the Nolichucky River, US 23 travels along the eastern foot of Buffalo Mountain as it goes through the towns of Erwin and Unicoi.

At the Roan Street exit, US 19W splits off and joins US 11E, continuing towards Bluff City. Passing through Indian Ridge, US 23 leaves Johnson City proper, continuing northwesterly into Sullivan County. After crossing the county and also entering Kingsport city limits, US 23 connects with I-81, in a cloverleaf interchange. At mile marker five is the I-26 Kingsport/Sullivan County Welcome Center, which is accessible from both directions. Staying west of downtown Kingsport, US 23 cuts through Bays Mountain and then crosses the south fork of the Holston River. At the US 11W (West Stone Drive) exit is the western terminus of I-26. With hidden concurrency with SR 137, US 23 continues north into Virginia, at Long Ridge, continuing towards Gate City. Interstate 26 Interstate 26 (I-26) travels concurrently with US 23 from the North Carolina state line to US 11W (West Stone Drive) interchange in Kingsport. Established in August 2003, it replaced I-181 south of I-81 and displaced SR 36 and SR 81. In March, 2007, I-26 was extended north of I-81 to its current western terminus at US 11W, decommissioning I-181 completely, as all signs and exit numbers were changed-over to I-26's designation. State Route 137 State Route 137 (SR 137) is a hidden concurrency that overlaps US 23 between the US 11W (West Stone Drive) interchange and the Virginia state line, all within Kingsport. Established in 1970 as a four-lane divided freeway, it traversed between SR 354, in Johnson City and SR 93, in Kingsport. SR 137 then expanded in phases: In 1973, extended south to US 11E/US 19W; in 1976, extended south to SR 91; in 1978, extended south to US 321; by 1980, extended north to US 11W; and in 1985, extended north to the Virginia state line and south to Erwin. In December, 1985, I-181 was established, truncating SR 137 to its current routing today. History US 23 was established in 1930 with a complete concurrency with SR 36, from the North Carolina state line to the Virginia state line; going through Erwin, Unicoi, Johnson City and Kingsport. In 1952, US 23 was rerouted southwest of Ernestville, along SR 81 through Flag Pond and Sam's Gap into North Carolina; its old alignment remained part of US 19W/SR 36. In 1970, The first segment of a four-lane freeway, designated SR 137, was opened between Johnson City and Kingsport. Over the following decade, SR 137 continued being extended at both ends until in 1982, when AASHTO approved US 23 relocation onto the freeway, leaving behind its old alignment to SR 36 north of Johnson City to near the Virginia state line. In December 1985, I-181 was established, truncated SR 137 north of US 11W, while SR 36 replaced as new concurrency south of US 11E; all signs and exit numbers were based on US 23 designation. In 1988, AASHTO approved an extension of I-26 from North Carolina to I-81, on contingent upon the completion and certification of interstate standards in North Carolina, which happened in August 2003. Following the new designation, both SR 36 and SR 81 was removed of their concurrencies with US 23. In March 2007, the remaining spur of I-181, from I-81 to US 11W, was switched to I-26. Interstate 181 Signage for former Interstate 181 in Johnson City. Interstate 181 (I-181) was established in December 1985 as an interstate designation of US 23, which was already built to interstate standards in the 1970s. I-181 traversed from US 321/SR 67, in Johnson City, to US 11W/SR 1, in Kingsport, totaling . US 23 continued on both directions as interstate grade to the Virginia line, to the north, and south to Erwin; by 1992, US 23 was upgraded to interstate grade south to Sam's Gap, at the North Carolina state line. All exit numbers were based on US 23 mileage. On August 5, 2003, after completion of a section completed in North Carolina, I-26 was extended west into Tennessee, replacing I-181 from Johnson City to I-81; north of I-81, I-181 continued into Kingsport. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) initially ruled against an extension of I-26 (as the number) along the remainder of I-181 to Kingsport, since that would give a main route Interstate Highway (I-26) a so-called \\"stub end,\\" not connecting to any other Interstate highway, to an international border, or to a seacoast. The numerical extension was in 2005 enacted by the effect of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), signed into law on August 10, 2005. In March 2007, I-181 was officially decommissioned, as all signs and exit numbers were changed-over to I-26's designation. Exit list Old exit numbers were based on US 23 distances; new exit numbers are based on I-26 milemarkers.

Kimball's involvement in the church led to the establishment of the women's Relief Society as well as participation in the national suffrage movement.  Conversion and church involvement  Sarah Granger was a daughter of Oliver Granger and his wife, Lydia Dibble. She was born in Phelps, New York to a prominent Puritan family. In 1830, Sarah's father acquired a copy of the Book of Mormon, and stated he had a vision of the ancient prophet, Moroni, testifying of the book's truth. Her family soon joined the Church of Christ , which was started by Joseph Smith. Three years after their conversion, the family moved to Kirtland, Ohio with other members of the church. There, a teenage Sarah attended Smith's School of the Prophets, which focused on religious and secular education. Sarah and her family then moved to Commerce, Illinois, which would become Nauvoo. In Nauvoo, Sarah met Hiram S. Kimball, a non-Latter Day Saint merchant. The couple married in 1840 and welcomed their first child in 1841. Together, they had six children, including three who were adopted. At the time of their first son's birth, church members were working on construction of the Nauvoo Temple. Sarah desired to contribute to the construction efforts, but felt uncomfortable donating since Hiram was not a member of the church. After discussing a contribution, Hiram donated a plot of land north of the temple property. Hiram was later baptized in 1843. The initial meeting in preparation to organize the Relief Society was held in the Kimball home. A dozen Latter Day Saint sisters gathered in hopes of \\"forming a 'Ladies Society' for future service projects\\". Eliza R. Snow assisted in creating formal guidelines for the organizations and preparing them for Smith's approval. On March 17, 1842, the Female Relief Society of Nauvoo was organized under the direction of Smith and the priesthood.Utah Division of State History, \\"Markers and Monuments Database: Sarah Melissa Granger Kimball Marker.\\" Utah Department of Heritage and Arts. https://heritage.utah.gov/apps/history/markers/detailed_results.php?markerid=3323 By 1844, the Nauvoo Relief Society had 1,341 members. The Kimball family moved west with the Mormon pioneers, settling in Salt Lake City in 1851. However, Sarah made the initial journey alone with the children, as Hiram's business required him to stay in New York for some time. When Hiram did join the family out west, he had very little money and was in poor health. To support her family, Sarah taught schoolchildren.  Relief Society leadership  In 1857, Sarah was called to be Relief Society president of Salt Lake City's 15th Ward. However, certain events, including the Utah War, forced the organization's activities to subside until 1867. During those ten years, both Sarah's mother and Hiram died. He drowned in a steamship accident while traveling to Hawaii to serve a full-time mission. In 1867, the Relief Society was reestablished and Sarah resumed her duties as Relief Society president. She served in that position for 42 years until her death. On November 13, 1868, Sarah laid the cornerstone of the church's first ever Relief Society building. The sisters used this building as a shop to sell hand-made items. The profits were used to \\"furnish the hall; purchase shares for the ward organ; build a granary and stock it with grain; contribute to funds for Perpetual Emigration, the Salt Lake and Logan temples, and the Deseret Hospital; provide carpet for the ward meetinghouse; and purchase a knitting machine and set up a tailoring establishment within the ward.\\" The construction of the 15th Ward Relief Society Hall was intended to inspire similar endeavors by sisters throughout the church. By the end of the 1800s, Relief Societies owned property valued at $95,000 and Relief Society halls had been built in other locations including Idaho, Arizona, Canada, and Mexico. In addition to her ward calling, Sarah served as the general secretary of the Relief Society starting in 1880, after it was reorganized under the leadership of Snow. She served as secretary for 12 years before becoming a counselor in the Relief Society General Presidency. Until her death, Sarah served concurrently in her ward and general Relief Society callings.

Early life and education  Born in Chicago, Illinois, to Jewish parents, Zagel is the son of Samuel S. Zagel (1905‚Äì1999), a native of Warsaw, Poland who had immigrated to Chicago in 1915, and Ethel Samuels Zagel (1911‚Äì1986). Zagel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Chicago in 1962 and a Master of Arts degree from the University of Chicago in the same year. He then earned a Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School in 1965.  Professional career  Zagel began his career as an assistant state attorney in Cook County, Illinois from 1965 until 1969. He then served as an assistant attorney general for the State of Illinois from 1969 until 1977. Concurrent to the job as assistant attorney general, Zagel ran the Criminal Justice Division in the attorney general's office from 1970 until 1977, and he also served as chief prosecuting attorney for the Illinois Judicial Inquiry Board from 1973 until 1975. In 1977, Zagel became executive director of the Illinois Law Enforcement Commission, a post he held until 1979. From 1979 until 1980, Zagel was the director of the Illinois Department of Revenue. From 1980 until joining the federal bench in 1987, Zagel was the director of the Illinois State Police.  Federal judicial service =Judicial appointments Zagel was a finalist for a federal judgeship in 1985, but was not chosen. On February 2, 1987, President Reagan nominated Zagel to be a judge on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The United States Senate confirmed Zagel on April 21, 1987 and he received his commission on April 22, 1987. He took senior status on October 21, 2016. From 2008 to 2015, Zagel served a seven-year term on the FISA Court.

The judge refused to let Blagojevich go to Costa Rica to participate in the show, I'm A Celebrity, Get Me Out Of Here, saying Blagojevich needed to prepare a good defense for his upcoming trial and focus on the reality of the current situation. The former governor's wife Patti Blagojevich went instead. In August 2010, jury deliberations began in the Blagojevich trial. Rod Blagojevich was convicted on one charge, of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, with a hung jury on 22 other charges. He was retried in June 2011, with Zagel presiding, and the jury returned a guilty verdict on 17 of the remaining counts, including those pertaining to the Obama Senate seat. On December 7, 2011, Zagel sentenced former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich to 14 years in federal prison.  Other interests  Zagel had roles in two major motion pictures.

(2009) Cognitive Neuroscience: The biology of the mind. New York: W.W. Norton & Company. but it can also be caused temporarily by the use of various sedatives and hypnotic drugs. The memory can be either wholly or partially lost due to the extent of damage that was caused.\\"Amnesia.\\" The Gale Encyclopedia of Science. Ed. K. Lee Lerner and Brenda Wilmoth Lerner. 4th ed. Vol. 1. Detroit: Gale, 2008. 182‚Äì184. Gale Virtual Reference Library. There are two main types of amnesia: retrograde amnesia and anterograde amnesia. Retrograde amnesia is the inability to retrieve information that was acquired before a particular date, usually the date of an accident or operation.Schacter, Daniel. L \\"Psychology\\" In some cases the memory loss can extend back decades, while in others the person may lose only a few months of memory. Anterograde amnesia is the inability to transfer new information from the short-term store into the long-term store. People with anterograde amnesia cannot remember things for long periods of time. These two types are not mutually exclusive; both can occur simultaneously. Case studies also show that amnesia is typically associated with damage to the medial temporal lobe. In addition, specific areas of the hippocampus (the CA1 region) are involved with memory. Research has also shown that when areas of the diencephalon are damaged, amnesia can occur. Recent studies have shown a correlation between deficiency of RbAp48 protein and memory loss. Scientists were able to find that mice with damaged memory have a lower level of RbAp48 protein compared to normal, healthy mice. In people suffering with amnesia, the ability to recall immediate information is still retained, and they may still be able to form new memories. However, a severe reduction in the ability to learn new material and retrieve old information can be observed. Patients can learn new procedural knowledge. In addition, priming (both perceptual and conceptual) can assist amnesiacs in the learning of fresh non-declarative knowledge. Amnesic patients also retain substantial intellectual, linguistic, and social skill despite profound impairments in the ability to recall specific information encountered in prior learning episodes. The term is ; . Signs and symptoms Individuals with amnesia can learn new information, particularly if the information is non-declarative knowledge. However, in some situations, people with dense anterograde amnesia do not remember the episodes during which they previously learned or observed the information. Some people who suffer from amnesia show abnormal amounts of memory loss, confusion, and difficulty recalling other people or places. People who recover often do not remember having amnesia. Declarative information Declarative memory can be broken down into semantic memory and episodic memory, semantic memory being that of facts, episodic memory being that of memory related to events. While a patient with amnesia might have a loss of declarative memory, this loss might vary in severity as well as the declarative information that it affects, depending on many factors. For example, LSJ was a patient that had retrograde declarative memory loss as the result of bilateral medial temporal lobe damage, but she was still able to remember how to perform some declarative skills. She was able to remember how to read music and the techniques used in art. She had preserved skill-related declarative memory for some things even though she had deficits in other declarative memory tasks. She even scored higher on skill-related declarative memory than the control in watercolor techniques, a technique that she used in her professional career before she acquired amnesia. = Semantic Information = The loss of semantic information in amnesia is most closely related with damage to the medial temporal lobe or to the neocortex. Some patients with anterograde amnesia can still acquire some semantic information, even though it might be more difficult and might remain rather unrelated to more general knowledge. H.M. could accurately draw a floor plan of the home in which he lived after surgery, even though he had not lived there in years. There is evidence that the hippocampus and the medial temporal lobe may help to consolidate semantic memories, but then they are more correlated with the neocortex. While lesions of the hippocampus normally lead to the loss of episodic memory, if there is any effect on semantic memory, it is more varied and usually doesn‚Äôt last as long. = Episodic Information = One reason that patients could not form new episodic memories is likely because the CA1 region of the hippocampus was a lesion, and thus the hippocampus could not make connections to the cortex. After an ischemic episode (an interruption of the blood flow to the brain), an MRI of patient R.B. following surgery showed his hippocampus to be intact except for a specific lesion restricted to the CA1 pyramidal cells.In one instance, transient global amnesia was caused by a hippocampal CA1 lesion. While this was a temporary case of amnesia, it still shows the importance of the CA1 region of the hippocampus in memory. Episodic memory loss is most likely to occur when there has been damage to the hippocampus. There is evidence that damage to the medial temporal lobe correlates to a loss of autobiographical episodic memory. Non-declarative information Some retrograde and anterograde amnesics are capable of non- declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment just as healthy people; therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. Some patients with amnesia are able to remember skills that they had learned without being able coconsciously to recall where they had learned that information. For example, they may learn to do a task and then be able to perform the task later without any recollection of learning the task. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated with the formation of declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and procedural memory can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Priming was accomplished in many different experiments of amnesia, and it was found that the patients can be primed; they have no conscious recall of the event, but the response is there. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.There is some evidence that non-declarative memory can be held onto in the form of motor skills. This idea was disputed, though, because it is argued that motor skills require both declarative and non-declarative information. Causes There are three generalized categories in which amnesia could be acquired by a person. The three categories are head trauma (example: head injuries), traumatic events (example: seeing something devastating to the mind), or physical deficiencies (example: atrophy of the hippocampus). The majority of amnesia and related memory issues derive from the first two categories as these are more common and the third could be considered a subcategory of the first. *Head trauma is a very broad range as it deals with any kind of injury or active action toward the brain which might cause amnesia. Retrograde and anterograde amnesia is more often seen from events like this, an exact example of a cause of the two would be electroconvulsive therapy, which would cause both briefly for the receiving patient. *Traumatic events are more subjective. What is traumatic is dependent on what the person finds to be traumatic. Regardless, a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress. A common example of amnesia that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative amnesia, which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them.Myers, David G. Psychology. fifth ed. New York: Worth Publishers, 1998. N. pag. Print An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones. *Physical deficiencies are different from head trauma because physical deficiencies lean more toward passive physical issues. Among specific causes of amnesia are the following: *Electroconvulsive therapy in which seizures are electrically induced in patients for therapeutic effect can have acute effects including both retrograde and anterograde amnesia.Benbow, SM (2004) \\"Adverse effects of ECT\\". In AIF Scott (ed.) The ECT Handbook, second edition. London: The Royal College of Psychiatrists, pp. 170‚Äì174. *Alcohol can both cause blackouts and have deleterious effects on memory formation. Diagnosis=Types * Anterograde amnesia is the inability to create new memories due to brain damage, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact. The brain damage can be caused by the effects of long-term alcoholism, severe malnutrition, stroke, head trauma, encephalitis, surgery, Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome, cerebrovascular events, anoxia or other trauma.Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Memory. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 250). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada. The two brain regions related with this condition are medial temporal lobe and medial diencephalon. Anterograde amnesia cannot be treated with pharmacological methods due to neuronal loss. However, treatment exists in educating patients to define their daily routines and after several steps they begin to benefit from their procedural memory. Procedural memory can be intact even when other forms of memory is not, although not always the case. Likewise, social and emotional support is critical to improving quality of life for anterograde amnesia sufferers. Fentanyl use by opioid users has been identified as a potential cause in a cluster of cases that occurred in Boston, MA. * Retrograde amnesia is inability to recall memories before onset of amnesia. One may be able to encode new memories after the incident. Retrograde is usually caused by head trauma or brain damage to parts of the brain besides the hippocampus. The hippocampus is responsible for encoding new memory. Episodic memory is more likely to be affected than semantic memory. The damage is usually caused by head trauma, cerebrovascular accident, stroke, tumor, hypoxia, encephalitis, or chronic alcoholism. People suffering from retrograde amnesia are more likely to remember general knowledge rather than specifics. Recent memories are less likely to be recovered, but older memories will be easier to recall due to strengthening over time.Mastin, L. (2010). The human memory: Retrograde amnesia . Retrieved from http://www.human-memory.net/disorders_retrograde.html Retrograde amnesia is usually temporary and can be treated by exposing them to memories from the loss.\\"memory abnormality.\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

Another type of consolidation (process by which memories become stable in the brain) occurs over much longer periods of time/days, weeks, months and years and likely involves transfer of information from the hippocampus to more permanent storage site in the cortex. The operation of this longer-term consolidation process is seen in the retrograde amnesia of patients with hippocampal damage who can recall memories from childhood relatively normally, but are impaired when recalling experiences that occurred just a few years prior to the time they became amnesic. (Kirwan et al.,2008)In the case of LSJ, her case shows that retrograde amnesia can affect many different parts of knowledge. LSJ wasn‚Äôt able to remember things from her child or adult life. She wasn‚Äôt able to remember things that most people pick up in everyday life such as logos or the names of common songs. *Post-traumatic amnesia is generally due to a head injury (example: a fall, a knock on the head). Traumatic amnesia is often transient, but may be permanent or either anterograde, retrograde, or mixed type. The extent of the period covered by the amnesia is related to the degree of injury and may give an indication of the prognosis for recovery of other functions. Mild trauma, such as a car accident that results in no more than mild whiplash, might cause the occupant of a car to have no memory of the moments just before the accident due to a brief interruption in the short/long-term memory transfer mechanism. The sufferer may also lose knowledge of who people are. Having longer periods of amnesia or consciousness after an injury may be an indication that recovery from remaining concussion symptoms will take much longer. *Dissociative amnesia results from a psychological cause as opposed to direct damage to the brain caused by head injury, physical trauma or disease, which is known as organic amnesia. Individuals with organic amnesia have difficulty with emotion expression as well as undermining the seriousness of their condition. The damage to the memory is permanent. Dissociative amnesia can include: Repressed memory is the inability to recall information, usually about stressful or traumatic events in persons' lives, such as a violent attack or disaster. The memory is stored in long-term memory, but access to it is impaired because of psychological defense mechanisms. Persons retain the capacity to learn new information and there may be some later partial or complete recovery of memory. Formerly known as \\"Psychogenic Amnesia\\". Dissociative fugue (formerly psychogenic fugue) is also known as fugue state. It is caused by psychological trauma, is usually temporary and unresolved, and therefore, may return. It must exist outside the influence of pre-existing medical conditions, such as a lobotomy, and immediate influence of any mind-altering substances, such as alcohol or drugs. An individual with dissociative fugue disorder either completely forgets or is confused about their identity, and may even assume a new one. They can travel hundreds miles from their home or work; they can also engage in other uncharacteristic, and occasionally unsafe, behavior. For example, two men in a study of five individuals with dissociative fugue had engaged in criminal activity while in their fugue state, having had no criminal record before the episodes. While popular in fiction, this type of amnesia is extremely rare. Posthypnotic amnesia occurs when events during hypnosis are forgotten, or where past memories are unable to be recalled. The failure to remember those events is induced by suggestions made during the hypnosis. Some characteristics of posthypnotic amnesia include inability to remember specific events while under hypnotic influence, reversibility, and having no relation between the implicit and explicit memory. Research has shown that there could be selectivity with amnesia when posthypnotic amnesia occurs. *Lacunar amnesia is the loss of memory about one specific event. It is a type of amnesia that leaves a lacuna (a gap) in the record of memory in the cortex region of the brain. The cause of this type of amnesia is the result of brain damage to the limbic system which control our memories and emotions. *Childhood amnesia (also known as infantile amnesia) is the common inability to remember events from one's own childhood. Sigmund Freud notoriously attributed this to sexual repression, while modern scientific approaches generally attribute it to aspects of brain development or developmental psychology, including language development, which may be why people do not easily remember pre-language events. Some research states that most adults cannot remember memories as early as two or three years old. Research suggests there are cultural influences that affect memories that are recalled. Researchers have found that implicit memories cannot be recalled or described. Remembering how to play the piano is a common example of implicit memory, as are walking, speaking, and other everyday activities that would be difficult to focus on if they had to be relearned every time one got up in the morning. Explicit memories, on the other hand, can be recalled and described in words. Remembering the first time meeting a teacher is an example of an explicit memory. *Transient global amnesia is a well-described medical and clinical phenomenon. This form of amnesia is distinct in that abnormalities in the hippocampus can sometimes be visualized using a special form of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain known as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). Symptoms typically last for less than a day and there is often no clear precipitating factor or any other neurological deficits. The cause of this syndrome is not clear. The hypothesis of the syndrome includes transient reduced blood flow, possible seizure or an atypical type of a migraine. Patients are typically amnestic of events more than a few minutes in the past, though immediate recall is usually preserved. *Source amnesia is the inability to remember where, when or how previously learned information has been acquired, while retaining the factual knowledge. When individuals are unable to remember, false memories can occur and cause great confusion. *Korsakoff's syndrome can result from long-term alcoholism or malnutrition. It is caused by brain damage due to a vitamin B1 deficiency and will be progressive if alcohol intake and nutrition pattern are not modified. Other neurological problems are likely to be present in combination with this type of Amnesia, such as problems with the medial temporal lobe and frontal lobe dysfunction. Korsakoff's syndrome is also known to be connected with confabulation. The person's short-term memory may appear to be normal, but the person may have a difficult time attempting to recall a past story, or with unrelated words, as well as complicated patterns. Korsakoff's syndrome is unique because it involves both anterograde and retrograde amnesia. *Drug- induced amnesia is intentionally caused by injection of an amnestic drug to help a patient forget surgery or medical procedures, particularly those not performed under full anesthesia, or likely to be particularly traumatic. Such drugs are also referred to as \\"premedicants\\". Most commonly, a 2-halogenated benzodiazepine such as midazolam or flunitrazepam is the drug of choice, although other strongly amnestic drugs such as propofol or scopolamine may also be used for this application. Memories of the short time-frame in which the procedure was performed are permanently lost or at least substantially reduced, but once the drug wears off, memory is no longer affected. *Situation-specific amnesia can arise in a variety of circumstances (for example, committing an offence, child sexual abuse) resulting in PTSD. It has been claimed that it involves a narrowing of consciousness with attention focused on central perceptual details and/or that the emotional or traumatic events are processed differently from ordinary memories. *Transient epileptic amnesia is a rare and unrecognized form of temporal lobe epilepsy, which is typically an episodic isolated memory loss. It has been recognized as a treatment-responsive syndrome congenial to anti-epileptic drugs. *Semantic amnesia affects semantic memory and primarily expresses itself in the form of problems with language use and acquisition. Semantic amnesia can lead to dementia. Treatment Many forms of amnesia fix themselves without being treated. However, there are a few ways to cope with memory loss if treatment is needed. Since there are a variety of causes that form different amnesia, it is important to note that there are different methods that response better with the certain type of Amnesia. Emotional support and love as well as medication and psychological therapy have been proven effective. One technique for Amnesia treatment is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to remember it more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.Mayo Clinic Staff (2011) Amnesia: Treatments and Drugs. Mayo Clinic. Retrieved from: http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/amnesia/DS01041/DSECTION=treatments-and- drugs. Another coping mechanism is taking advantage of technological assistance, such as a personal digital device to keep track of day-to-day tasks. Reminders can be set up for appointments when to take medications, birthdays and other important events. Many pictures can also be stored to help amnesiacs remember names of friends, family, and co-workers. Notebooks, wall calendars, pill reminders and photographs of people and places are low-tech memory aids that can help as well. While there are no medications available to treat amnesia, underlying medical conditions can be treated to improve memory. Such conditions include but are not limited to low thyroid function, liver or kidney disease, stroke, depression, bipolar disorder and blood clots in the brain.Mandal, A. (n.d) Treatment of Amnesia. News Medical. Retrieved From: http://www.news-medical.net/health/Treatment-of-amnesia.aspx Wernicke‚ÄìKorsakoff syndrome involves a lack of thiamin and replacing this vitamin by consuming thiamin-rich foods such as whole-grain cereals, legumes (beans and lentils), nuts, lean pork, and yeast. Treating alcoholism and preventing alcohol and illicit drug use can prevent further damage, but in most cases will not recover lost memory. Although improvements occur when patients receive certain treatments, there is still no actual cure remedy for amnesia so far. To what extent the patient recovers and how long the amnesia will continue depends on the type and severity of the lesion. History French psychologist Theodule-Armand Ribot was among the first scientists to study amnesia. He proposed Ribot's Law which states that there is a time gradient in retrograde amnesia. The law follows a logical progression of memory loss due to disease. First, a patient loses the recent memories, then personal memories, and finally intellectual memories. He implied that the most recent memories were lost first. Case studies have played a large role in the discovery of amnesia and the parts of the brain that were affected. The studies gave important insight into how amnesia affects the brain. The studies also gave scientists the resources into improving their knowledge about amnesia and insight into a cure or prevention. There are several extremely important case studies: Henry Molaison, R.B, and G.D. Henry Molaison Henry Molaison, formerly known as H.M., changed the way people thought of memory. The case was first reported in a paper by William Beecher Scoville and Brenda Milner in 1957. He was a patient who suffered from severe epilepsy attributed to a bicycle accident at the age of nine. Physicians were unable to control his seizures with drugs, so the neurosurgeon Scoville tried a new approach involving brain surgery. He removed his medial temporal lobe bilaterally by doing a temporal lobectomy. His epilepsy did improve, but Molaison lost the ability to form new long-term memories (anterograde amnesia). He exhibited normal short-term memory ability. If he was given a list of words, he would forget them in about a minute's time. In fact, he would forget that he was even given a list in the first place. However, H.M.‚Äôs working and short-term memory seemed to be intact. He had a normal digit span and could hold a conversation that didn‚Äôt require him to recall past parts of the conversation. Once Molaison stopped thinking about the lists he was unable to recall them again from long term memory. This gave researchers evidence that short-term and long-term memory are in fact two different processes. Even though he forgot about the lists, he was still able to learn things through his implicit memory. The psychologists would ask him to draw something on a piece of paper, but to look at the paper using a mirror. Though he could never remember ever doing that task, he would improve after doing it over and over again. This showed the psychologists that he was learning and remembering things unconsciously. In some studies it was found that H.M.‚Äôs perceptual learning was intact and that his other cognitive skills were working appropriately. It was also found that some people with declarative information amnesia are able to be primed. Studies were completed consistently throughout Molaison's lifetime to discover more about amnesia. Researchers did a 14-year follow-up study on Molaison. They studied him for a period of two weeks to learn more about his amnesia. After 14 years, Molaison still could not recall things that had happened since his surgery. However, he could still remember things that had happened prior to the operation. Researchers also found that, when asked, Molaison could answer questions about national or international events, but he could not remember his own personal memories. After his death Molaison donated his brain to science, where they were able to discover the areas of the brain that had the lesions which caused his amnesia, particularly the medial temporal lobe. This case study provided important insight to the areas of the brain that are affected in anterograde amnesia, as well as how amnesia works. H.M.‚Äôs case showed us that memory processes are consolidated into different parts of the brain and that short-term and working memory are not usually impaired in cases of amnesia.  Clive Wearing  Another famous historical case of amnesia was that of Clive Wearing. Clive Wearing was a conductor and musician who contracted herpes simplex virus. This virus affected the hippocampal regions of the brain. Because of this damage, Wearing was unable to remember information for more than a few moments. Wearing‚Äôs non- declarative memory was still functioning but his declarative memory was impaired. To him, he felt that he had just come to consciousness for the first time every time he was unable to hold on to information. This case also can be used as evidence that there are different memory systems for declarative and non-declarative memory. This case was more evidence that the hippocampus is an important part of the brain in remembering past events and that declarative and non-declarative memories have different processes in different parts of the brain. Patient R.B. Patient R.B. was a normally functioning man until the age of 52. At age 50, he had been diagnosed with angina and had surgery for heart problems on two occasions. After an ischemic episode (reduction of blood to the brain) that was caused from a heart bypass surgery, R.B. demonstrated a loss of anterograde memory, but almost no loss of retrograde memory, with the exception of a couple of years before his surgery, and presented no sign of any other cognitive impairment. It wasn't until after his death that researchers had the chance to examine his brain, when they found his lesions were restricted to the CA1 portion of the hippocampus. This case study led to important research involving the role of the hippocampus and the function of memory. Patient G.D. Patient G.D. was a white male born in 1940 who served in the Navy. He was diagnosed with chronic kidney failure and received hemodialysis treatment for the rest of his life. In 1983, he went to the hospital for elective parathyroidectomy. He also had a left thyroid lobectomy because of the severe loss of blood in his left lobe. He began having cardiac problems as a result of the surgery and became very agitated. Even five days after being released from the hospital he was unable to remember what had happened to him. Aside from memory impairment, none of his other cognitive processes seemed to be affected. He did not want to be involved in much research, but through memory tests he took with doctors, they were able to ascertain that his memory problems were present for the next 9.5 years until his death. After he died, his brain was donated to science, photographed, and preserved for future study. In fiction Global amnesia is a common motif in fiction despite being extraordinarily rare in reality. In the introduction to his anthology The Vintage Book of Amnesia, Jonathan Lethem writes: Lethem traces the roots of literary amnesia to Franz Kafka and Samuel Beckett, among others, fueled in large part by the seeping into popular culture of the work of Sigmund Freud, which also strongly influenced genre films such as film noir. Amnesia is so often used as a plot device in films, that a widely recognized stereotypical dialogue has even developed around it, with the victim melodramatically asking \\"Where am I? Who am I? What am I?\\", or sometimes inquiring of his own name, \\"Bill? Who's Bill?\\" In movies and television, particularly sitcoms and soap operas, it is often depicted that a second blow to the head, similar to the first one which caused the amnesia, will then cure it. In reality, however, repeat concussions may cause cumulative deficits including cognitive problems, and in extremely rare cases may even cause deadly swelling of the brain associated with second-impact syndrome.

System administrators can tailor Linux for their specific targets and for special usage scenarios before compilation; users who have been granted the necessary privileges can also fine-tune kernel parameters at runtime. The Linux kernel is deployed on a wide variety of computing systems, such as embedded devices, mobile devices (including its use in the Android operating system), personal computers, servers, mainframes, and supercomputers. The Linux kernel was conceived and created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds for his personal computer and with no cross-platform intentions, but has since ported to a wide range of computer architectures. Notwithstanding this, the Linux kernel is highly optimized with the use of architecture specific instructions (ISA), therefore portability isn't as easy as it is with other kernels (e.g., with NetBSD, that as of 2019 supports 59 hardware platforms). Linux was soon adopted as the kernel for the GNU Operating System, which was created as an open source and free software, and based on UNIX as a by-product of the fallout of the Unix wars. Since then, it has spawned a plethora of operating system distributions, commonly also called Linux, although, formally, the term \\"Linux\\" refers only to the kernel. Day-to-day development discussions take place on the Linux kernel mailing list (LKML). Linux as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2), but it also contains several files under other compatible licenses and an ad hoc exemption for the user space API header files (UAPI). The Linux ABI (i.e., the Application Binary Interface which also includes Application Program Interface or API at the code source level) between the kernel and the user space has four degrees of stability (stable, testing, obsolete, removed); however, the system calls are expected to never change in order to not break the userspace programs that rely on them. Loadable kernel modules (LKMs), by design, cannot rely on a stable ABI. Therefore they must always be recompiled whenever a new kernel executable is installed in a system, otherwise they won't be loaded. In-tree drivers that are configured to become an integral part of the kernel executable (vmlinux) are statically linked by the building process. There's also no guarantee of stability of source level in-kernel API and, because of this, device drivers code, as well as the code of any other kernel subsystem, must be kept updated with kernel evolution. Fortunately, a simple rule requires that any developer who makes an API change should fix any code that breaks as the result of that change.  History  Linus Torvalds with a microphone at the LinuxCon Europe 2014 in D√ºsseldorf In April 1991, Linus Torvalds, at the time a 21-year-old computer science student at the University of Helsinki, Finland, started working on some simple ideas for an operating system. He started with a task switcher in Intel 80386 assembly language and a terminal driver. On 25 August 1991, Torvalds posted the following to comp.os.minix, a newsgroup on Usenet: On 17 September 1991, Torvalds prepared version 0.01 of Linux and put on the \\"ftp.funet.fi\\" ‚Äì FTP server of the Finnish University and Research Network (FUNET). It was not even executable since its code still needed Minix for compilation and play. On 5 October 1991, Linus announced the first \\"official\\" version of Linux, version 0.02. At this point, Linux was able to run Bash, GCC, and some other GNU utilities: After that, many people contributed code to the project, included some developers from the MINIX community. At the time, the GNU Project had created many of the components required for a free operating system, but its own kernel, GNU Hurd, was incomplete and unavailable. The Berkeley Software Distribution had not yet freed itself from legal encumbrances. Despite the limited functionality of the early versions, Linux rapidly gained developers and users. Torvalds assigned version 0 to the kernel to indicate that it was mainly for testing and not intended for productive use. Version 0.11, released in December 1991, was the first self-hosted Linux, for it could be compiled by a computer running the same kernel. When Torvalds released version 0.12 in February 1992, he adopted the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2) over his previous self-drafted license, which had not permitted commercial redistribution. In contrast to Unix, all source files of Linux are freely available, including device drivers. The initial success of Linux was driven by programmers and testers across the world. With the support of the POSIX APIs, through the libC that, whether needed, acts as an entry point to the kernel address space, Linux could run software and applications that had been developed for Unix. The Linux kernel now supports various hardware architectures, providing a common platform for software, including proprietary software. On 19 January 1992, the first post to the new newsgroup alt.os.linux was submitted. On 31 March 1992, the newsgroup was renamed comp.os.linux. The fact that Linux is a monolithic kernel rather than a microkernel was the topic of a debate between Andrew S. Tanenbaum, the creator of MINIX, and Torvalds. The Tanenbaum‚ÄìTorvalds debate started in 1992 on the Usenet group comp.os.minix as a general discussion about kernel architectures. Linux version 0.95 was the first to be capable of running the X Window System. In March 1994, Linux 1.0.0 was released with 176,250 lines of code. It was the first version suitable for use in production environments. It started a versioning system for the kernel with three or four numbers separated by dots where the first represented the major release, the second was the minor release, and the third was the revision. At that time odd-numbered minor releases were for development and tests, whilst even numbered minor releases were for production. The optional fourth digit indicated a set of patches to a revision. Development releases were indicated with -rc (\\"release candidate\\") suffix. The current version numbering is slightly different from the above. The even vs. odd numbering has been dropped and a specific major version is now indicated by the first two numbers, taken as a whole. While the time-frame is open for the development of the next major, the -rcN suffix is used to identify the n'th release candidate for the next version. For example, the release of the version 4.16 was preceded by seven 4.16-rcN (from -rc1 to -rc7). Once a stable release is made, its maintenance is passed off to the ‚Äústable team\\". Occasional updates to stable releases are identified by a three numbering scheme (e.g., 4.13.1, 4.13.2, ..., 4.13.16). Version 1.2 (released 7 March 1995) gained support for computer systems using processors based on the Alpha, SPARC, and MIPS architectures. After version 1.3 of the kernel, Torvalds decided that Linux had evolved enough to warrant a new major number, so he released version 2.0.0 in June 1996. The series included 41 releases. The major feature of 2.0 was support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) and support for more types of processors. Starting with version 2.0, Linux is configurable for selecting specific hardware targets and for enabling architecture specific features and optimizations. The make *config family of commands of kbuild are used to enable and configure thousands of options for building ad hoc kernel executables (vmlinux) and loadable modules. Version 2.2, released on 20 January 1999, removed the \\"Big Kernel Lock\\", that was a global spinlock, and provided improved SMP support, added support for the m68k and PowerPC architectures, and added new file systems (including read-only support for Microsoft's NTFS). In 1999, IBM published its patches to the Linux 2.2.13 code for the support of the S/390 architecture. Version 2.4.0, released on 4 January 2001, contained support for ISA Plug and Play, USB, and PC Cards. It also included support for the PA-RISC processor from Hewlett-Packard. Development for 2.4.x changed a bit in that more features were made available throughout the duration of the series, including support for Bluetooth, Logical Volume Manager (LVM) version 1, RAID support, InterMezzo and ext3 file systems. Version 2.6.0 was released on 17 December 2003. The development for 2.6.x changed further towards including new features throughout the duration of the series. Among the changes that have been made in the 2.6 series are: integration of ¬µClinux into the mainline kernel sources, PAE support, support for several new lines of CPUs, integration of Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) into the mainline kernel sources, support for up to 232 users (up from 216), support for up to 229 process IDs (64-bit only, 32-bit arches still limited to 215), substantially increased the number of device types and the number of devices of each type, improved 64-bit support, support for file systems which support file sizes of up to 16 terabytes, in-kernel preemption, support for the Native POSIX Thread Library (NPTL), User-mode Linux integration into the mainline kernel sources, SELinux integration into the mainline kernel sources, InfiniBand support, and considerably more. Also notable are the addition of a wide selection of file systems starting with the 2.6.x releases: now the kernel supports a large number of file systems, some that have been designed for Linux, like ext3, ext4, FUSE, Btrfs, and others that are native of other operating systems like JFS, XFS, Minix, Xenix, Irix, Solaris, System V, Windows and MS-DOS. In 2005 the stable team was formed as a response to the lack of a kernel tree where people could work on bug fixes, and it would keep updating stable versions. In February 2008 the linux-next tree was created to serve as a place where patches aimed to be merged during the next development cycle gathered. Several subsystem maintainers also adopted the suffix -next for trees containing code which they mean to submit for inclusion in the next release cycle. , the in-development version of Linux is held in an unstable branch named linux-next. Linux used to be maintained without the help of an automated source code management system until, in 2002, development switched to BitKeeper. It was freely available for Linux developers but it was not free software. In 2005, because of efforts to reverse-engineer it, the company which owned the software revoked the support of the Linux community. In response, Torvalds and others wrote Git. The new system was written within weeks, and in two months the first official kernel made using it was released. Details on the history of the 2.6 kernel series can be found in the ChangeLog files on the 2.6 kernel series source code release area of kernel.org. The 20th anniversary of Linux was celebrated by Torvalds in July 2011 with the release of the 3.0.0 kernel version. As 2.6 has been the version number for 8 years, a new uname26 personality that reports 3.x as 2.6.40+x had to be added to the kernel so that old programs would work. Version 3.0 was released on 22 July 2011. On 30 May 2011, Torvalds announced that the big change was \\"NOTHING. Absolutely nothing.\\" and asked, \\"...let's make sure we really make the next release not just an all new shiny number, but a good kernel too.\\" After the expected 6‚Äì7 weeks of the development process, it would be released near the 20th anniversary of Linux. On 11 December 2012, Torvalds decided to reduce kernel complexity by removing support for i386 processors, making the 3.7 kernel series the last one still supporting the original processor. The same series unified support for the ARM processor. Version 3.11, released on 2 September 2013, adds many new features such as new \`O_TMPFILE\` flag for to reduce temporary file vulnerabilities, experimental AMD Radeon dynamic power management, low-latency network polling, and zswap (compressed swap cache). The numbering change from 2.6.39 to 3.0, and from 3.19 to 4.0, involved no meaningful technical differentiation. The major version number was increased to avoid large minor numbers. Stable 3.x.y kernels were released until 3.19 in February 2015. In April 2015, Torvalds released kernel version 4.0. By February 2015, Linux had received contributions from nearly 12,000 programmers from more than 1,200 companies, including some of the world's largest software and hardware vendors. Version 4.1 of Linux, released in June 2015, contains over 19.5 million lines of code contributed by almost 14,000 programmers. A total of 1,991 developers, of whom 334 are first collaborators, added more than 553,000 lines of code to version 5.8, breaking the record previously held by version 4.9. According to the Stack Overflow‚Äôs annual Developer Survey of 2019, more than the 53% of all respondents have developed software for Linux OS and about 27% for Android, although only about 25% develop with Linux-based operating systems. Most of the website servers use Linux OS and all of the world's 500 most powerful supercomputers use some kind of OS based on Linux. Linux distributions bundle the kernel with system software (eg., the GNU C Library, systemd, and others Unix utilities and daemons) and a wide selection of application software, but their usage share in desktops is low in comparison to other operating systems. The Android OS, which counts the majority of the installed base of all operating systems for mobile devices, is responsible for the rising usage of the Linux kernel, together with its wide use in a large variety of embedded devices.  Architecture  Map of the Linux kernel Linux is a monolithic kernel with a modular design (e.g, it can insert and remove LKMs at runtime), supporting most features once only available in closed source kernels of non- free operating systems: * concurrent computing and (with the availability of enough CPU cores for tasks that are ready to run) even true parallel execution of many processes at once (each of them having one or more threads of execution) on SMP and NUMA architectures; * configurable features (using one of the \\"make *config\\" commands, before running compilation) and run-time modifiable policies (via nice(2), setpriority(2) and the family of sched_*(2) syscalls) of the task schedulers that allow preemptive multitasking (both in user mode and, since the 2.6 series, in kernel mode); the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) is the default scheduler of Linux since 2007 and it uses a red-black tree which can search, insert and delete process information (task_struct) with O(log n) time complexity, where n is the number of runnable tasks; * advanced memory management with paged virtual memory; * inter-process communications and synchronization mechanism; * a virtual filesystem on top of several concrete filesystems (ext4, Btrfs, XFS, JFS, FAT32, and many more); * configurable I/O schedulers, ioctl(2) syscall that manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files (it's a non standard system call, since arguments, returns, and semantics depends on the device driver in question), support for POSIX asynchronous I/O (however, because they scale poorly with multithreaded applications, a family of Linux specific I/O system calls (io_*(2)) had to be created for the management of asynchronous I/O contexts suitable for concurrently processing: * OS-level virtualization (with Linux- VServer), paravirtualization and hardware-assisted virtualization (with KVM or Xen, and using QEMU for hardware emulation); On the Xen hypervisor, the Linux kernel provides support to build Linux distributions (such as openSuSE Leap and many others) that work as Dom0, that are virtual machine host servers that provide the management environment for the user's virtual machines (DomU). * security mechanisms for discretionary and mandatory access control (SELinux, AppArmor, POSIX ACLs, and others); * several types of layered communication protocols (including the Internet protocol suite). Device drivers and kernel extensions run in kernel space (ring 0 in many CPU architectures), with full access to the hardware, although some exceptions run in user space, for example, filesystems based on FUSE/CUSE, and parts of UIO. The graphics system most people use with Linux does not run within the kernel. Unlike standard monolithic kernels, device drivers are easily configured as modules, and loaded or unloaded while the system is running and can also be pre-empted under certain conditions in order to handle hardware interrupts correctly and to better support symmetric multiprocessing. By choice, Linux has no stable device driver application binary interface. Linux typically makes use of memory protection and virtual memory and can also handle non-uniform memory access, however the project has absorbed ŒºClinux which also makes it possible to run Linux on microcontrollers without virtual memory. The hardware is represented in the file hierarchy. User applications interact with device drivers via entries in the or directories. Processes information as well are mapped to the file system through the directory.  Interfaces  Four interfaces are distinguished: two internal to the kernel, and two between the kernel and userspace. Linux is a clone of UNIX, therefore it aims towards POSIX and Single UNIX Specification compliance. Furthermore, since Linux is not UNIX, the kernel provides additional system calls and other interfaces that are Linux specific. In order to be included in the official kernel, the code must comply with a set of well defined licensing rules. = Kernel-to- userspace API = The set of the Linux kernel API that regard the interfaces exposed to user applications is fundamentally composed by UNIX and Linux- specific system calls. A system call is an entry point into the Linux kernel. For example, among the Linux-specific ones there is the family of the clone(2) system calls. Most extensions must be enabled by defining the _GNU_SOURCE macro in a header file or when the user-land code is being compiled. System calls can only be invoked by using assembly instructions which enable the transition from unprivileged user space to privileged kernel space in ring 0. For this reason, the C standard library (libC) acts as a wrapper to most Linux system calls, by exposing C functions that, only whether it is needed, can transparently enter into the kernel which will execute on behalf of the calling process. For those system calls not exposed by libC, e.g. the fast userspace mutex (futex), the library provides a function called syscall(2) which can be used to explicitly invoke them. Pseudo filesystems (e.g., the sysfs and procfs filesystems) and special files (e.g., /dev/random, /dev/sda, /dev/tty, and many others) constitute another layer of interface to kernel data structures representing hardware or logical (software) devices. = Kernel-to-userspace ABI = Because of the differences existing between the hundreds of various implementations of the Linux OS, executable objects, even though they are compiled, assembled, and linked for running on a specific hardware architecture (that is, they use the ISA of the target hardware), often cannot run on different Linux Distributions. This issue is mainly due to distribution-specific configurations and set of patches applied to the code of the Linux kernel, differences in system libraries, services (daemons), filesystem hierarchies, and environment variables. The main standard concerning application and binary compatibility of Linux distributions is the Linux Standard Base (LSB). However, the LSB goes beyond what concerns the Linux kernel, because it also defines the desktop specifications, the X libraries and Qt that have little to do with it. The LSB version 5 is built upon several standards and drafts (POSIX, SUS, X/Open, File System Hierarchy (FHS), and others). The parts of the LSB largely relevant to the kernel are the General ABI (gABI), especially the System V ABI and the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF), and the Processor Specific ABI (psABI), for example the Core Specification for X86-64. The standard ABI for how x86_64 user programs invoke system calls is to load the syscall number into the rax register, and the other parameters into rdi, rsi, rdx, r10, r8, and r9, and finally to put the syscall assembly instruction in the code. = In-kernel API = DRM infrastructure with Mesa 3D. As there is no stable in-kernel ABI, AMD had to constantly adapt the former binary blob used by Catalyst. There are several kernel internal APIs utilized between the different subsystems. Some are available only within the kernel subsystems, while a somewhat limited set of in-kernel symbols (i.e., variables, data structures and functions) is exposed also to dynamically loadable modules (e.g., device drivers loaded on demand) whether they're exported with the EXPORT_SYMBOL() and EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL() macros (the latter reserved to modules released under a GPL-compatible license). Some Linux in-kernel APIs have been kept stable over several releases, others have not. There are no guarantees regarding the in-kernel APIs. Maintainers and contributors are free to augment or change them at any time. However, there are in-kernel APIs that manipulate data structures (e.g., lists, trees, queues) or perform common routines (e.g., copy data from and to user space, allocate memory, print lines to the system log, and so on) that have remained stable at least since Linux version 2.6. Examples of in-kernel APIs include libraries of low-level common services used by device drivers: * SCSI Interfaces and libATA respectively, a peer-to-peer packet based communication protocol for storage devices attached to USB, SATA, SAS, Fibre Channel, FireWire, ATAPI device, and an in-kernel library to support [S]ATA host controllers and devices. * Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) and Kernel Mode Setting (KMS) for interfacing with GPUs and supporting the needs of modern 3D-accelerated video hardware, and for setting screen resolution, color depth and refresh rate * DMA buffers (dma_buf) for sharing buffers for hardware direct memory access across multiple device drivers and subsystems * Video4Linux for video capture hardware * Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) for sound cards * New API for network interface controllers * mac80211 for wireless network interface controllers = In-kernel ABI = The Linux developers choose not to maintain a stable in-kernel ABI. Modules compiled for a specific Linux cannot be loaded into another version of the kernel without being re-compiled, assuming that the source level in-kernel API has remained the same, otherwise also the module code must be modified accordingly.  Technical features  Processes and Threads = Linux creates processes by means of the clone(2) or by the newer clone3(2) system calls. Depending on the given parameters, the new entity can share most or none of the resources of the caller. These syscalls can create new entities ranging from new independent processes (each having a special identifier called TGID within the task_struct data structure in kernel space, although that same identifier is called PID in userspace), to new threads of execution within the calling process (by using the CLONE_THREAD parameter). In this latter case the new entity owns the same TGID of the calling process and consequently has also the same PID in userspace. The Native POSIX Thread Library, simply known as the NPTL, provides the standard POSIX threads interface (pthreads) to userspace Whenever a new thread is created using the pthread_create(3) POSIX interface, the clone(2) family of system calls must also be given the address of the function that the new thread must jump to. The Linux kernel provides the futex(7) (acronym for \\"Fast user-space mutexes\\") mechanisms for fast user- space locking and synchronization; the majority of the operations are performed in userspace but it may be necessary to communicate with the kernel using the futex(2) system call. A very special category of threads are the so- called kernel threads. They must not be confused with the above-mentioned threads of execution of user's processes. Kernel threads exist only in kernel space and their only purpose is to concurrently run kernel tasks. Differently, whenever an independent process is created, the syscalls return exactly to the next instruction of the same program, concurrently in parent process and in child's one (i.e., one program, two processes). Different return values (one per process) enable the program to know in which of the two processes it is currently executing. Programs need this information because the child process, a few steps after process duplication, usually invokes the execve(2) system call (possibly via the family of exec(3) wrapper functions in glibC) and replace the program that is currently being run by the calling process with a new program, with newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments. When it's done, it results in two processes that run two different programs. Depending on the effective user id (euid), and on the effective group id (egid), a process running with user zero privileges (root, the system administrator, owns the identifier 0) can perform everything (e.g., kill all the other processes or recursively wipe out whole filesystems), instead non zero user processes cannot. Capabilities(7) divides the privileges traditionally associated with superuser into distinct units, which can be independently enabled and disabled by the parent process or dropped by the child itself. = Virtualization, Namespaces, Control Groups = Scheduling and Preemption = Linux enables different scheduling classes and policies. By default the kernel uses a scheduler mechanism called the Completely Fair Scheduler introduced in the 2.6.23 version of the kernel. Internally this default-scheduler class is also known as \`SCHED_OTHER\`, but the kernel also contains two POSIX-compliant real-time scheduling classes named \`SCHED_FIFO\` (realtime first-in-first-out) and \`SCHED_RR\` (realtime round-robin), both of which take precedence over the default class. An additional scheduling policy known as \`SCHED_DEADLINE\`, implementing the earliest deadline first algorithm (EDF), was added in kernel version 3.14, released on 30 March 2014. \`SCHED_DEADLINE\` takes precedence over all the other scheduling classes. Linux provides both user preemption as well as full kernel preemption. Preemption reduces latency, increases responsiveness, and makes Linux more suitable for desktop and real-time applications. With user preemption, the kernel scheduler can replace the current process with the execution of a context switch to a different one that therefore acquires the computing resources for running (CPU, memory, and more). It makes it according to the CFS algorithm (in particular it uses a variable called vruntime for sorting processes), to the active scheduler policy and to the processes relative priorities. With kernel preemption, the kernel can preempt itself when an interrupt handler returns, when kernel tasks block, and whenever a subsystem explicitly calls the schedule() function. The Linux kernel patch \`PREEMPT_RT\` enables full preemption of critical sections, interrupt handlers, and \\"interrupt disable\\" code sequences. Partial integration of the real-time Linux patches brought the above mentioned functionality to the kernel mainline. = Memory Management = Memory management in Linux is a complex topic. First of all, the kernel is not pageable (i.e., it's always resident in physical memory and cannot be swapped to the disk). In the kernel there's no memory protection (no SIGSEGV signals, unlike in userspace), therefore memory violations lead to instability and system crash.  Processes address space layout  Memory Management System Calls  Physical Memory Management  Virtual Memory Management  Paging and Page Replacement  Inter-Process Communication and Synchronization = Input/Output Layer = The Linux Storage Stack Diagram = Virtual and Concrete Filesystems = Device Drivers = Supported Architectures = TiVo DVR, a consumer device running Linux While not originally designed to be portable, Linux is now one of the most widely ported operating system kernels, running on a diverse range of systems from the ARM architecture to IBM z/Architecture mainframe computers. The first port was performed on the Motorola 68000 platform. The modifications to the kernel were so fundamental that Torvalds viewed the Motorola version as a fork and a \\"Linux-like operating system\\". However, that moved Torvalds to lead a major restructure of the code to facilitate porting to more computing architectures. The first Linux that, in a single source tree, had code for more than i386 alone, supported the DEC Alpha AXP 64-bit platform. Linux runs as the main operating system on IBM's Summit; , all of the world's 500 fastest supercomputers run some operating system based on the Linux kernel, a big change from 1998 when the first Linux supercomputer got added to the list. Linux has also been ported to various handheld devices such as Apple's iPhone 3G and iPod. = Live patching = Rebootless updates can even be applied to the kernel by using live patching technologies such as Ksplice, kpatch and kGraft. Minimalistic foundations for live kernel patching were merged into the Linux kernel mainline in kernel version 4.0, which was released on 12 April 2015. Those foundations, known as livepatch and based primarily on the kernel's ftrace functionality, form a common core capable of supporting hot patching by both kGraft and kpatch, by providing an application programming interface (API) for kernel modules that contain hot patches and an application binary interface (ABI) for the userspace management utilities. However, the common core included into Linux kernel 4.0 supports only the x86 architecture and does not provide any mechanisms for ensuring function-level consistency while the hot patches are applied. , there is ongoing work on porting kpatch and kGraft to the common live patching core provided by the Linux kernel mainline. = Security = Kernel bugs present potential security issues. For example, they may allow for privilege escalation or create denial-of- service attack vectors. Over the years, numerous bugs affecting system security were found and fixed. New features are frequently implemented to improve the kernel's security. Capabilities(7) have already been introduced in the section about the processes and threads. Android makes use of them and Systemd gives administrators detailed control over the capabilities of processes. Linux offers a wealth of mechanisms to reduce kernel attack surface and improve security which are collectively known as the Linux Security Modules (LSM). They comprise the Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) module, whose code has been originally developed and then released to the public by the NSA, and AppArmor among others. SELinux is now actively developed and maintained on GitHub. SELinux and AppArmor provide support to access control security policies, including mandatory access control (MAC), though they profoundly differ in complexity and scope. Another security feature is the Seccomp BPF (SECure COMPuting with Berkeley Packet Filters) which works by filtering parameters and reducing the set of system calls available to user- land applications. Critics have accused kernel developers of covering up security flaws or at least not announcing them; in 2008, Linus Torvalds responded to this with the following: Linux distributions typically release security updates to fix vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Many offer long- term support releases that receive security updates for a certain Linux kernel version for an extended period of time.  Development = Developer community  It is generally assumed that the community of Linux kernel developers comprises 5000 or 6000 members. According to the \\"2017 State of Linux Kernel Development\\", a study issued by the Linux Foundation, covering the commits for the releases 4.8 to 4.13, about 1500 developers were contributing from about 200-250 companies on average. The top 30 developers contributed a little more than 16% of the code. As of companies, the top contributors are Intel (13.1%) and Red Hat (7.2%), Linaro (5.6%), IBM (4.1%), the second and fifth places are held by the 'none' (8.2%) and 'unknown' (4.1%) categories.  Source code management  The Linux development community uses Git to manage the source code. Git users clone the latest version of Torvalds' tree with git-clone(1) and keep it up to date using git-pull(1). Contributions are submitted as patches, in the form of text messages on the LKML (and often also on other mailing lists dedicated to particular subsystems). The patches must conform to a set of rules and to a formal language that, among other things, describes which lines of code are to be deleted and what others are to be added to the specified files. These patches can be automatically processed so that system administrators can apply them in order to make just some changes to the code or to incrementally upgrade to the next version. Linux is distributed also in GNU zip (gzip) and bzip2 formats.  Submitting code to the kernel  A developer who wants to change the Linux kernel starts with developing and testing that change. Depending on how significant the change is and how many subsystems it modifies, the change will either be submitted as a single patch or in multiple patches of source code. In case of a single subsystem that is maintained by a single maintainer, these patches are sent as e-mails to the maintainer of the subsystem with the appropriate mailing list in Cc. The maintainer and the readers of the mailing list will review the patches and provide feedback. Once the review process has finished the subsystem maintainer accepts the patches in the relevant Git kernel tree. If the changes to the Linux kernel are bug fixes that are considered important enough, a pull request for the patches will be sent to Torvalds within a few days. Otherwise, a pull request will be sent to Torvalds during the next merge window. The merge window usually lasts two weeks and starts immediately after the release of the previous kernel version. The Git kernel source tree names all developers who have contributed to the Linux kernel in the Credits directory and all subsystem maintainers are listed in Maintainers.  Programming language and coding style  Linux is written in a special C programming language supported by GCC, a compiler that extends in many ways the C standard, for example using inline sections of code written in the assembly language (in GCC's \\"AT&T-style;\\" syntax) of the target architecture. Since 2002 all the code must adhere to the 21 rules comprising the Linux Kernel Coding Style.  GNU toolchain  The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC or GNU cc) is the default compiler for the mainline Linux sources and it's invoked by a utility called make. Then, the GNU Assembler (more often called GAS or GNU as) outputs the object files from the GCC generated assembly code. Finally, the GNU Linker (GNU ld) is used to produce a statically linked executable kernel file called vmlinux. as and ld are part of a package called GNU binutils. The above-mentioned tools are collectively known as the GNU toolchain.  Compiler compatibility  GCC was for a long time the only compiler capable of correctly building Linux. In 2004, Intel claimed to have modified the kernel so that its C compiler was also capable of compiling it. There was another such reported success in 2009, with a modified 2.6.22 version. Since 2010, effort has been underway to build Linux with Clang, an alternative compiler for the C language; as of 12 April 2014, the official kernel could almost be compiled by Clang. The project dedicated to this effort is named LLVMLinux after the LLVM compiler infrastructure upon which Clang is built. LLVMLinux does not aim to fork either Linux or the LLVM, therefore it is a meta-project composed of patches that are eventually submitted to the upstream projects. By enabling Linux to be compiled by Clang, developers may benefit from shorter compilation times.  Kernel debugging  An example of Linux kernel panic Linux bugs can be very hard to find out and fix, firstly because of kernel interaction with userspace and hardware and secondly because they might be caused from a wider number of reasons than those which can affect user programs. A few examples of the underlying causes are semantic errors in code, misuse of synchronization primitives, and an incorrect hardware management. A report of a non-fatal bug in the kernel is called an \\"oops\\"; such deviations from correct behavior of the Linux kernel may allow continued operation with compromised reliability. A critical and fatal error is reported via the \\"panic()\\" function. It prints a message and then halts the kernel. One of the most common techniques used to find out bugs in code is debugging by printing. For this purpose Linux provides an in-kernel API called printk() which stores messages in a circular buffer. The syslog(2) system call is used for reading and/or clearing the kernel message ring buffer and for setting the maximum log level of the messages to be sent to the console (i.e., one of the eight KERN_* parameters of printk(), which tell the severity of the condition reported); usually it is invoked via the glibC wrapper klogctl(3). Kernel messages are also exported to userland through the /dev/kmsg interface (e.g., systemd-journald reads that interface and by default append the messages to /var/log/journal). Another fundamental technique for debugging a running kernel is tracing. The ftrace mechanism is a Linux internal tracer; it is used for monitoring and debugging Linux at runtime and it can also analyze user space latencies due to kernel misbehavior. Furthermore, ftrace allows users to trace Linux at boot-time. kprobes and kretprobes can break (like debuggers in userspace) into Linux and non-disruptively collect information. kprobes can be inserted into code at (almost) any address, while kretprobes work at function return. uprobes have similar purposes but they also have some differences in usage and implementation.  Development model  The Linux kernel project integrates new code on a rolling basis. Software checked into the project must work and compile without error. For each kernel subsystem there is a maintainer who is responsible for reviewing patches against the kernel code standards and keeps a queue of patches that can be submitted to Linus Torvalds within a merge window of several weeks. Patches are merged by Torvalds into the source code of the prior stable Linux kernel release, creating the -rc release candidate for the next stable kernel. Once the merge window is closed only fixes to the new code in the development release are accepted. The -rc development release of the kernel goes through regression tests and once it is judged to be stable by Torvalds and the kernel subsystem maintainers a new Linux kernel is released and the development process starts all over again. Developers who feel treated unfairly can report this to the Linux Foundation's Technical Advisory Board. In July 2013 the maintainer of the USB 3.0 driver Sarah Sharp asked Torvalds to address the abusive commentary in the kernel development community. In 2014, Sharp backed out of Linux kernel development, saying that \\"The focus on technical excellence, in combination with overloaded maintainers, and people with different cultural and social norms, means that Linux kernel maintainers are often blunt, rude, or brutal to get their job done\\". At the linux.conf.au (LCA) conference in 2018, developers expressed the view that the culture of the community has gotten much better in the past few years. Daniel Vetter, the maintainer of the Intel drm/i915 graphics kernel driver, commented that the \\"rather violent language and discussion\\" in the kernel community has decreased or disappeared. Laurent Pinchart asked developers for feedback on their experience with the kernel community at the 2017 Embedded Linux Conference Europe. The issues brought up were a few days later discussed at the Maintainers Summit. Concerns over the lack of consistency in how maintainers responded to patches submitted by developers were echoed by Shuah Khan, the maintainer of the kernel self-test framework. Torvalds contended that there would never be consistency in the handling of patches because different kernel subsystems have over time adopted different development processes. Therefore, it was agreed upon that each kernel subsystem maintainer would document the rules for patch acceptance.  Linux forks  An iPod booting iPodLinux There are certain communities that develop kernels based on the official Linux. Some interesting bits of code from these forks (i.e., a slang term meaning \\"derived projects\\") that include Linux- libre, Compute Node Linux, INK, L4Linux, RTLinux, and User-Mode Linux (UML) have been merged into the mainline. Some operating systems developed for mobile phones initially used heavily modified versions of Linux, including Google Android, Firefox OS, HP webOS, Nokia Maemo and Jolla Sailfish OS. In 2010, the Linux community criticised Google for effectively starting its own kernel tree: Today Android uses a slightly customized Linux where changes are implemented in device drivers so that little or no change to the core kernel code is required. Android developers also submit patches to the official Linux that finally can boot the Android operating system. For example, a Nexus 7 can boot and run the mainline Linux.  Development community conflicts  There have been several notable conflicts among Linux kernel developers. Examples of such conflicts are: * In July 2007, Con Kolivas announced that he would cease developing for the Linux kernel. * In July 2009, Alan Cox quit his role as the TTY layer maintainer after disagreement with Linus Torvalds. * In December 2010, there was a discussion between Linux SCSI maintainer James Bottomley and SCST maintainer Vladislav Bolkhovitin about which SCSI target stack should be included in the Linux kernel. This made some Linux users upset. * In June 2012, Torvalds made it very clear that he did not agree with NVIDIA releasing its drivers as closed. * In April 2014, Torvalds banned Kay Sievers from submitting patches to the Linux kernel for failing to deal with bugs that caused systemd to negatively interact with the kernel. * In October 2014, Lennart Poettering accused Torvalds of tolerating the rough discussion style on Linux kernel related mailing lists and of being a bad role model. * In March 2015, Christoph Hellwig filed a lawsuit against VMware for infringement of the copyright on the Linux kernel. Linus Torvalds made it clear that he did not agree with this and similar initiatives by calling lawyers a festering disease. Prominent Linux kernel developers have been aware of the importance of avoiding conflicts between developers. For a long time there was no code of conduct for kernel developers due to opposition by Linus Torvalds. However, a Linux Kernel Code of Conflict was introduced on 8 March 2015. It was replaced on 16 September 2018 by a new Code of Conduct based on the Contributor Covenant. This coincided with a public apology by Linus and a brief break from kernel development. On 30 November 2018, complying with the Code of Conduct, Jarkko Sakkinen of Intel sent out patches replacing instances of \\"fuck\\" appearing in source code comments with suitable versions focused on the word 'hug'.  Codebase  , the 5.6 release of the Linux kernel had around 33 million lines of code, roughly 14% of the code is part of the \\"core\\" (arch, kernel and mm directories) while 60% is drivers.  Estimated cost to redevelop  Redevelopment costs of Linux kernel The cost to redevelop the Linux kernel version 2.6.0 in a traditional proprietary development setting has been estimated to be US$612 million (‚Ç¨467M, ¬£394M) in 2004 prices using the COCOMO man-month estimation model. In 2006, a study funded by the European Union put the redevelopment cost of kernel version 2.6.8 higher, at ‚Ç¨882M ($1.14bn, ¬£744M). This topic was revisited in October 2008 by Amanda McPherson, Brian Proffitt, and Ron Hale-Evans. Using David A. Wheeler's methodology, they estimated redevelopment of the 2.6.25 kernel now costs $1.3bn (part of a total $10.8bn to redevelop Fedora 9). Again, Garcia-Garcia and Alonso de Magdaleno from University of Oviedo (Spain) estimate that the value annually added to kernel was about ‚Ç¨100M between 2005 and 2007 and ‚Ç¨225M in 2008, it would cost also more than ‚Ç¨1bn (about $1.4bn as of February 2010) to develop in the European Union. , using then-current LOC (lines of code) of a 2.6.x Linux kernel and wage numbers with David A. Wheeler's calculations it would cost approximately $3bn (about ‚Ç¨2.2bn) to redevelop the Linux kernel as it keeps getting bigger. An updated calculation , using then-current 20,088,609 LOC (lines of code) for the 4.14.14 Linux kernel and the current US National average programmer salary of $75,506 show it would cost approximately $14,725,449,000 dollars (¬£11,191,341,000 pounds) to rewrite the existing code.  Maintenance and long-term support Boot messages of a Linux kernel 2.6.25.17 The latest kernel version and older kernel versions are maintained separately. Most latest kernel releases were supervised by Linus Torvalds. Current versions are released by Greg Kroah-Hartman. The Linux kernel developer community maintains a stable kernel by applying fixes for software bugs that have been discovered during the development of the subsequent stable kernel. Therefore, www.kernel.org will always list two stable kernels. The next stable Linux kernel is now released only 8 to 12 weeks later. Therefore, the Linux kernel maintainers have designated some stable kernel releases as longterm, these long-term support Linux kernels are updated with bug fixes for two or more years. In November 2019 there were five longterm Linux kernels: 4.19.84, 4.14.154, 4.9.201, 4.4.201 and 3.16.76. The full list of releases is at Linux kernel version history.  Relation with Linux distributions  Most Linux users run a kernel supplied by their Linux distribution. Some distributions ship the \\"vanilla\\" or \\"stable\\" kernels. However, several Linux distribution vendors (such as Red Hat and Debian) maintain another set of Linux kernel branches which are integrated into their products. These are usually updated at a slower pace compared to the \\"vanilla\\" branch, and they usually include all fixes from the relevant \\"stable\\" branch, but at the same time they can also add support for drivers or features which had not been released in the \\"vanilla\\" version the distribution vendor started basing their branch from.  Legal aspects = GPLv2 licensing terms  Initially, Torvalds released Linux under a license which forbade any commercial use. This was changed in version 0.12 by a switch to the GNU General Public License version 2 (GPLv2). This license allows distribution and sale of possibly modified and unmodified versions of Linux but requires that all those copies be released under the same license and be accompanied by the complete corresponding source code. Torvalds has described licensing Linux under the GPLv2 as the \\"best thing I ever did\\". The Linux kernel is licensed explicitly only under version 2 of the GPL, without offering the licensee the option to choose \\"any later version\\", which is a common GPL extension. The official git branch of Torvalds contains documentation that explains the kernel development process to people who want to work with the community and contribute code; it clearly states that \\"[Any] contributions which are not covered by a [GPLv2] compatible license will not be accepted into the kernel.\\". There was considerable debate about how easily the license could be changed to use later GPL versions (including version 3), and whether this change is even desirable. Torvalds himself specifically indicated upon the release of version 2.4.0 that his own code is released only under version 2. However, the terms of the GPL state that if no version is specified, then any version may be used, and Alan Cox pointed out that very few other Linux contributors had specified a particular version of the GPL. In September 2006, a survey of 29 key kernel programmers indicated that 28 preferred GPLv2 to the then-current GPLv3 draft. Torvalds commented, \\"I think a number of outsiders... believed that I personally was just the odd man out because I've been so publicly not a huge fan of the GPLv3.\\" This group of high-profile kernel developers, including Torvalds, Greg Kroah-Hartman and Andrew Morton, commented on mass media about their objections to the GPLv3. They referred to clauses regarding DRM/tivoization, patents, \\"additional restrictions\\" and warned a Balkanisation of the \\"Open Source Universe\\" by the GPLv3. Linus Torvalds, who decided not to adopt the GPLv3 for the Linux kernel, reiterated his criticism even years later.  Loadable kernel modules  It is debated whether some loadable kernel modules (LKMs) are to be considered derivative works under copyright law, and thereby whether or not they fall under the terms of the GPL. In accordance with the license rules, LKMs using only a public subset of the kernel interfaces are non-derived works, thus Linux gives system administrators the mechanisms to load out-of-tree binary objects into the kernel address space. There are some out-of-tree loadable modules that make legit use of the dma_buf kernel feature. GPL compliant code can certainly use it. However, a different possible use case would be Nvidia Optimus that pairs a fast GPU with an Intel integrated GPU, where the Nvidia GPU writes into the Intel framebuffer when it is active. But, Nvidia cannot use this infrastructure because it necessitates to bypass a rule that can only be used by LKMs that are also GPL. Alan Cox replied on LKML, rejecting a request from one of their engineers to remove this technical enforcement from the API. Torvalds clearly stated on the LKML that \\"[I] claim that binary-only kernel modules ARE derivative \\"by default\\"'\\". On the other hand, Torvalds has also said that \\"[one] gray area in particular is something like a driver that was originally written for another operating system (i.e. clearly not a derived work of Linux in origin). THAT is a gray area, and _that_ is the area where I personally believe that some modules may be considered to not be derived works simply because they weren't designed for Linux and don't depend on any special Linux behaviour\\". Proprietary graphics drivers, in particular, are heavily discussed.  Firmware binary blobs  The official kernel, that is the Linus git branch at the kernel.org repository, doesn't contain any kind of proprietary code; however Linux can search the filesystems to locate proprietary firmware, drivers, and other executable modules (collectively known as \\"binary blobs\\"), then it can load and link them into the kernel space. Whenever proprietary modules are loaded into Linux, the kernel marks itself as being \\"tainted\\" and therefore bug reports from tainted kernels will often be ignored by developers. Whether it's needed (e.g., for accessing boot devices or for speed) firmware can be built-in to the kernel, this means building the firmware into vmlinux; however this is not always a viable option for technical or legal issues (e.g., it's not permitted to firmware that is non-GPL compatible).  Trademark  Linux is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds in the United States, the European Union, and some other countries. A legal battle, started for a fraudulent trademark application by a third party (William Della Croce, who was never involved in the development of Linux) and claims by the same one of trademark infringement, ended in August 1997 when the trademark was definitively awarded to Mr. Torvalds.

He attended St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire; and graduated from Princeton University in 1874, and from Columbia Law School in 1876. Career After serving in private practice, he was appointed Assistant New York County District Attorney by D.A. Randolph B. Martine in 1885. In November 1887, he ran on the Citizens Reform, Republican and Irving Hall (a faction of Anti-Tammany Democrats) tickets to succeed Martine as D.A., but was defeated by his fellow Assistant D.A. John R. Fellows who ran on the Tammany Hall/County Democracy (the larger faction of Anti-Tammany Democrats) ticket. Upon taking office in January 1888, Fellows dismissed Nicoll from the office of Assistant D.A. In November 1890, Nicoll ran on the Tammany Hall ticket to succeed Fellows as D.A., and was elected. Nicoll was D.A. from January 1891 until the end of 1893. Afterwards he resumed the practice of law. In 1896, Nicoll was among the Democrats who repudiated William Jennings Bryan and campaigned for Republican William McKinley. In 1904, he was chosen by Chairman Thomas Taggart as Vice Chairman of the Democratic National Committee. He successfully represented Joseph Pulitzer and the New York World in a libel case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court in 1910 regarding press freedom. During the 1908 U.S. presidential campaign, the New York World had published an account of how a consortium involving President Theodore Roosevelt's brother-in-law Douglas Robinson, U.S. Secretary of War William H. Taft's brother Charles P. Taft, William Nelson Cromwell and J. P. Morgan had bought the French Panama Canal company for US$4,000,000 and re-sold it to the U.S. government for US$40,000,000, thus netting a fortune of about US$36,000,000. Personal life On December 11, 1890, he married Maud Churchill (1871‚Äì1924). Together, they were the parents of: * De Lancey Nicoll Jr. (1892‚Äì1957), also an attorney. * Josephine Churchill Nicoll (1894‚Äì1915), who died at age 19. Nicoll died at his home at 23 East 39th Street in Manhattan. He left a fortune of nearly a million and a half dollars.  See also  * John Jay McKelvey, Sr., Attorney, Founder of Harvard Law Review.

In less than fifteen minutes, postal worker Patrick Sherrill pursued and shot several coworkers, killing 14 and injuring another six, before committing suicide. Sherrill's attack inspired the American phrase \\"going postal\\". Shooting Shortly after 7:00 a.m., Patrick Sherrill killed Richard Esser, Jr., one of two supervisors who had verbally disciplined him the previous day. Sherrill then sought out Bill Bland, another supervisor who had reprimanded him. However, Bland had overslept that morning and arrived an hour late to work, by which time the shootings were already over. Not finding Bland, Sherrill then killed co-worker Paul Michael Rockne. Around 100 workers occupied the small facility at the time of the attack. Fourteen people died at the scene, and six others received wounds requiring hospitalization. The day's violence ended when Sherrill shot himself in the forehead. Possible motives Sherrill's job title was Relief Carrier, meaning he was often required to work alternate routes on different days, a position dictated by his rank on the seniority list. His lack of a permanently assigned route meant that he lacked the same job stability as other USPS workers. Opinions vary concerning his job performance. Some reports portray him as an erratic, irritable worker; others claim he performed well and was being badgered by management. In any case, on the afternoon of August 19, 1986, supervisors Esser and Bland reprimanded Sherrill for his behavior. Both anger over this reprimand and anxiety that he was likely to be fired could have been possible motives behind the attack the following morning. Victims Fourteen people were killed in the shooting, while six others were injured. The victims were: ;Killed * Patricia Ann Chambers, 41, part-time clerk * Judy Stephens Denney, 41, part-time clerk * Richard C. Esser Jr., 38, supervisor * Patricia A.

Dedicated on May 29, 1989, it is located outside the post office's main entry to the south. The memorial contains the bronze statue of a man and a woman standing atop the fountain's center base and holding the ribbon of which the bow is attached to the base. To represent the fourteen victims killed in the shooting, the fountain contains fourteen water jets and a plaque on the front of the base listing their names. IAS OK000160.

Initially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&T; licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), Sun Microsystems (SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX), and IBM (AIX). In the early 1990s, AT&T; sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, a neutral industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS). However, Novell continues to own the Unix copyrights, which the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc. court case (2010) confirmed. Unix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the \\"Unix philosophy\\". According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function. A unified filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism known as \\"pipes\\" serve as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows. Unix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.  Overview  Version 7 Unix, the Research Unix ancestor of all modern Unix systems Unix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmers. The system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in academic circles, and as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues. At first, Unix was not designed to be portable or for multi-tasking. Later, Unix gradually gained portability, multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities in a time-sharing configuration. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command-line interpreter using pipes, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality. These concepts are collectively known as the \\"Unix philosophy\\". Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike summarize this in The Unix Programming Environment as \\"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\\".Kernighan, Brian W. Pike, Rob. The UNIX Programming Environment. 1984. viii By the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes. The Unix environment and the client‚Äìserver program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers. Both Unix and the C programming language were developed by AT&T; and distributed to government and academic institutions, which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system. The Unix operating system consists of many libraries and utilities along with the master control program, the kernel. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common \\"low-level\\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the distinction of kernel space from user space, the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate.  History  Ken Thompson (sitting) and Dennis Ritchie working together at a PDP-11 The origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing Multics, a time- sharing operating system for the GE-645 mainframe computer. Multics featured several innovations, but also presented severe problems. Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics, but not by its goals, individual researchers at Bell Labs started withdrawing from the project. The last to leave were Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna, who decided to reimplement their experiences in a new project of smaller scale. This new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name. The new operating system was a single-tasking system. In 1970, the group coined the name Unics for Uniplexed Information and Computing Service as a pun on Multics, which stood for Multiplexed Information and Computer Services. Brian Kernighan takes credit for the idea, but adds that \\"no one can remember\\" the origin of the final spelling Unix. Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Peter G. Neumann also credit Kernighan. The operating system was originally written in assembly language, but in 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in C. Version 4 Unix, however, still had many PDP-11 dependent codes, and was not suitable for porting. The first port to another platform was made five years later (1978) for the Interdata 8/32. Bell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as \\"Research Unix\\". In 1975, the first source license for UNIX was sold to Donald B. Gillies at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign Department of Computer Science. UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson, who had worked on the UNIX kernel at Bell Labs, was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (BSD and System V) by commercial startups, which in turn led to Unix fragmenting into multiple, similar but often slightly mutually-incompatible systems including DYNIX, HP-UX, SunOS/Solaris, AIX, and Xenix. In the late 1980s, AT&T; Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems developed System V Release 4 (SVR4), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors. In the 1990s, Unix and Unix-like systems grew in popularity and became the operating system of choice for over 90% of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers, as BSD and Linux distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers. In 2000, Apple released Darwin, also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, later renamed macOS. Unix operating systems are widely used in modern servers, workstations, and mobile devices.  Standards  The Common Desktop Environment (CDE), part of the COSE initiative In the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification. In 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.  Components  The Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the kernel of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence. The inclusion of these components did not make the system large the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10 MB and arrived on a single nine-track magnetic tape. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes. The names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many to have the canonical early structure: * Kernel source code in /usr/sys, composed of several sub-components:  conf configuration and machine-dependent parts, including boot code  dev device drivers for control of hardware (and some pseudo-hardware)  sys operating system \\"kernel\\", handling memory management, process scheduling, system calls, etc.  h header files, defining key structures within the system and important system-specific invariables * Development environment early versions of Unix contained a development environment sufficient to recreate the entire system from source code:  cc C language compiler (first appeared in V3 Unix)  as machine-language assembler for the machine  ld linker, for combining object files  lib object-code libraries (installed in /lib or /usr/lib). libc, the system library with C run-time support, was the primary library, but there have always been additional libraries for things such as mathematical functions (libm) or database access. V7 Unix introduced the first version of the modern \\"Standard I/O\\" library stdio as part of the system library. Later implementations increased the number of libraries significantly.  make build manager (introduced in PWB/UNIX), for effectively automating the build process  include header files for software development, defining standard interfaces and system invariants  Other languages V7 Unix contained a Fortran-77 compiler, a programmable arbitrary-precision calculator (bc, dc), and the awk scripting language; later versions and implementations contain many other language compilers and toolsets. Early BSD releases included Pascal tools, and many modern Unix systems also include the GNU Compiler Collection as well as or instead of a proprietary compiler system.  Other tools including an object-code archive manager (ar), symbol-table lister (nm), compiler- development tools (e.g. lex & yacc), and debugging tools. * Commands Unix makes little distinction between commands (user-level programs) for system operation and maintenance (e.g. cron), commands of general utility (e.g. grep), and more general-purpose applications such as the text formatting and typesetting package. Nonetheless, some major categories are:  sh the \\"shell\\" programmable command-line interpreter, the primary user interface on Unix before window systems appeared, and even afterward (within a \\"command window\\").  Utilities the core toolkit of the Unix command set, including cp, ls, grep, find and many others. Subcategories include: * System utilities administrative tools such as mkfs, fsck, and many others. * User utilities environment management tools such as passwd, kill, and others.  Document formatting Unix systems were used from the outset for document preparation and typesetting systems, and included many related programs such as nroff, troff, tbl, eqn, refer, and pic. Some modern Unix systems also include packages such as TeX and Ghostscript.  Graphics the plot subsystem provided facilities for producing simple vector plots in a device-independent format, with device- specific interpreters to display such files. Modern Unix systems also generally include X11 as a standard windowing system and GUI, and many support OpenGL.  Communications early Unix systems contained no inter-system communication, but did include the inter-user communication programs mail and write. V7 introduced the early inter-system communication system UUCP, and systems beginning with BSD release 4.1c included TCP/IP utilities. * Documentation Unix was the first operating system to include all of its documentation online in machine-readable form. The documentation included:  man manual pages for each command, library component, system call, header file, etc.  doc longer documents detailing major subsystems, such as the C language and troff  Impact  Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie, principal developers of Research Unix Photo from USENIX 1984, including Dennis Ritchie (center) Plan 9 from Bell Labs extends Unix design principles and was developed as a successor to Unix. The Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in assembly language, but was soon rewritten in C, a high-level programming language. Although this followed the lead of Multics and Burroughs, it was Unix that popularized the idea. Unix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as printers, terminals, or disk drives), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \\"stream of bytes\\" model. The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms. Unix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's RSX-11M's \\"group, user\\" hierarchy evolved into VMS directories, CP/M's volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM's SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems. Making the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The Unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (shell scripts ‚Äì there was no separate job control language like IBM's JCL). Since the shell and OS commands were \\"just another program\\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes (pipelines) made a powerful programming paradigm (coroutines) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell. A fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on newline-delimited text for nearly all file formats. There were no \\"binary\\" editors in the original version of Unix ‚Äì the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte ‚Äì unlike \\"record-based\\" file systems. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated ad hoc tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages (PostScript, ODF), and at the application layer of the Internet protocols, e.g., FTP, SMTP, HTTP, SOAP, and SIP. Unix popularized a syntax for regular expressions that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The C programming language soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming. Early Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a \\"software tools\\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the Unix philosophy. The TCP/IP networking protocols were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the Internet explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms. The Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the free software movement in 1983.  Free Unix and Unix-like variants  In 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \\"GNU's Not Unix\\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \\"free\\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the kernel Linux as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the GNU operating system, many GNU packages ‚Äì such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities ‚Äì have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well. Linux distributions, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Debian GNU/Linux, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Mandriva Linux, Slackware Linux, Arch Linux and Gentoo. A free derivative of BSD Unix, 386BSD, was released in 1992 and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (USL v. BSDi) by Unix System Laboratories, it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD. Linux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions. In a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix: In the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \\"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\\". OpenSolaris was the free software counterpart to Solaris developed by Sun Microsystems, which included a CDDL-licensed kernel and a primarily GNU userland. However, Oracle discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the illumos kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.  ARPANET  In May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of Network Unix by the Center for Advanced Computation at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign. The system was said to \\"present several interesting capabilities as an ARPANET mini-host\\". At the time Unix required a license from Bell Laboratories that at $20,000(US) was very expensive for non- university users, while an educational license cost just $150. It was noted that Bell was \\"open to suggestions\\" for an ARPANET-wide license. Specific features found beneficial were the local processing facilities, compilers, editors, a document preparation system, efficient file system and access control, mountable and unmountable volumes, unified treatment of peripherals as special files, integration of the network control program (NCP) within the Unix file system, treatment of network connections as special files that can be accessed through standard Unix I/O calls, closing of all files on program exit, and the decision to be \\"desirable to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\\".  Branding  Promotional license plate by Digital Equipment Corporation HP9000 workstation running HP-UX, a certified Unix operating system In October 1993, Novell, the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the trademarks of Unix to the X/Open Company (now The Open Group), and in 1995 sold the related business operations to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Whether Novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, SCO v. Novell, which Novell won. The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, closing the case. Unix vendor SCO Group Inc. accused Novell of slander of title. The present owner of the trademark UNIX is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the Single UNIX Specification qualify as \\"UNIX\\" (others are called \\"Unix-like\\"). By decree of The Open Group, the term \\"UNIX\\" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the UNIX 98 or UNIX 03 trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group. Systems that have been licensed to use the UNIX trademark include AIX, EulerOS, HP-UX, Inspur K-UX, IRIX, macOS, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX (formerly \\"Digital UNIX\\", or OSF/1), and z/OS. Notably, EulerOS and Inspur K-UX are Linux distributions certified as UNIX 03 compliant. Sometimes a representation like Un*x, *NIX, or *N?X is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes from the use of the asterisk (*) and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group. The Open Group requests that UNIX is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as system to help avoid the creation of a genericized trademark. Unix was the original formatting, but the usage of UNIX remains widespread because it was once typeset in small caps (Unix). According to Dennis Ritchie, when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), \\"we had a new typesetter and troff had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps\\". Many of the operating system's predecessors and contemporaries used all-uppercase lettering, so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit. It is not an acronym. Trademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix has been used as a brand name for various products including bookshelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair driers and food containers. Several plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix-like systems. Most common is the conventional Unixes, but Unices, treating Unix as a Latin noun of the third declension, is also popular. The pseudo-Anglo-Saxon plural form Unixen is not common, although occasionally seen. Sun Microsystems, developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term Unix is itself plural, referencing its many implementations.

Synopsis The story follows a young widower, Guy Jones, as he joins an amateur operatic society that is putting on The Beggar's Opera. He rapidly progresses through the ranks to become the male lead, while simultaneously conducting liaisons with several of the female cast. Many of the songs from The Beggar's Opera are kept within the play, usually being sung with their own, new context. First productions Ayckbourn wrote the work for the 1984 summer season at his Stephen Joseph Theatre, Scarborough, where it opened on 2 May. Peter Hall, director of the National Theatre, London, had expressed an interest in the piece and Ayckbourn modified his initial concept to suit an eventual large-scale production; on 1 August 1985 it opened in the National's Olivier auditorium, with Ayckbourn directing, Michael Gambon playing amateur director Dafydd Llewellyn and Bob Peck as newcomer Guy Jones. The female leads were Gemma Craven, Imelda Staunton and Kelly Hunter.

Dantron is a mild peristaltic stimulant which acts on the lower bowel to encourage normal bowel movement without causing irritation. It belongs to the group of medicines under the term stimulant laxative. It stimulates the nerves in the stomach wall which causes the stomach muscles to contract. This medicine is used for analgesic-induced constipation. It takes six to twelve hours to work. This can cause discoloration of urine and bowel and liver tumors. Co-danthramer is dantron plus poloxamer. It is (in the U.K.) only to be prescribed to terminally ill patients because of its carcinogenicity in rats. It is often prescribed to people taking long term opioid, because it relaxes the effect of opioid induced constipation.

A molecule consisting of atoms of only one element is therefore not a compound. There are four types of compounds, depending on how the constituent atoms are held together: * molecules held together by covalent bonds * ionic compounds held together by ionic bonds * intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds * certain complexes held together by coordinate covalent bonds. A chemical formula specifies the number of atoms of each element in a compound molecule, using the standard abbreviations for the chemical elements and numerical subscripts. For example, a water molecule has formula H2O indicating two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. Many chemical compounds have a unique CAS number identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service. Globally, more than 350,000 chemical compounds (including mixtures of chemicals) have been registered for production and use. A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a chemical reaction. In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and new bonds formed.  Definitions  Any substance consisting of two or more different types of atoms (chemical elements) in a fixed stoichiometric proportion can be termed a chemical compound; the concept is most readily understood when considering pure chemical substances. It follows from their being composed of fixed proportions of two or more types of atoms that chemical compounds can be converted, via chemical reaction, into compounds or substances each having fewer atoms. The ratio of each element in the compound is expressed in a ratio in its chemical formula. A chemical formula is a way of expressing information about the proportions of atoms that constitute a particular chemical compound, using the standard abbreviations for the chemical elements, and subscripts to indicate the number of atoms involved. For example, water is composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom: the chemical formula is H2O. In the case of non-stoichiometric compounds, the proportions may be reproducible with regard to their preparation, and give fixed proportions of their component elements, but proportions that are not integral [e.g., for palladium hydride, PdHx (0.02 < x < 0.58)]. Phase diagram for Palladium-Hydrogen System Chemical compounds have a unique and defined chemical structure held together in a defined spatial arrangement by chemical bonds. Chemical compounds can be molecular compounds held together by covalent bonds, salts held together by ionic bonds, intermetallic compounds held together by metallic bonds, or the subset of chemical complexes that are held together by coordinate covalent bonds. Pure chemical elements are generally not considered chemical compounds, failing the two or more atom requirement, though they often consist of molecules composed of multiple atoms (such as in the diatomic molecule H2, or the polyatomic molecule S8, etc.). Many chemical compounds have a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS): its CAS number. There is varying and sometimes inconsistent nomenclature differentiating substances, which include truly non-stoichiometric examples, from chemical compounds, which require the fixed ratios. Many solid chemical substances‚Äîfor example many silicate minerals‚Äîare chemical substances, but do not have simple formulae reflecting chemically bonding of elements to one another in fixed ratios; even so, these crystalline substances are often called \\"non- stoichiometric compounds\\". It may be argued that they are related to, rather than being chemical compounds, insofar as the variability in their compositions is often due to either the presence of foreign elements trapped within the crystal structure of an otherwise known true chemical compound, or due to perturbations in structure relative to the known compound that arise because of an excess of deficit of the constituent elements at places in its structure; such non-stoichiometric substances form most of the crust and mantle of the Earth. Other compounds regarded as chemically identical may have varying amounts of heavy or light isotopes of the constituent elements, which changes the ratio of elements by mass slightly.  Types = Molecules  Ionic compounds  Intermetallic compounds  Complexes = Bonding and forces  Compounds are held together through a variety of different types of bonding and forces. The differences in the types of bonds in compounds differ based on the types of elements present in the compound. London dispersion forces are the weakest force of all intermolecular forces. They are temporary attractive forces that form when the electrons in two adjacent atoms are positioned so that they create a temporary dipole. Additionally, London dispersion forces are responsible for condensing non polar substances to liquids, and to further freeze to a solid state dependent on how low the temperature of the environment is. A covalent bond, also known as a molecular bond, involves the sharing of electrons between two atoms. Primarily, this type of bond occurs between elements that fall close to each other on the periodic table of elements, yet it is observed between some metals and nonmetals. This is due to the mechanism of this type of bond. Elements that fall close to each other on the periodic table tend to have similar electronegativities, which means they have a similar affinity for electrons. Since neither element has a stronger affinity to donate or gain electrons, it causes the elements to share electrons so both elements have a more stable octet. Ionic bonding occurs when valence electrons are completely transferred between elements. Opposite to covalent bonding, this chemical bond creates two oppositely charged ions. The metals in ionic bonding usually lose their valence electrons, becoming a positively charged cation. The nonmetal will gain the electrons from the metal, making the nonmetal a negatively charged anion. As outlined, ionic bonds occur between an electron donor, usually a metal, and an electron acceptor, which tends to be a nonmetal. Hydrogen bonding occurs when a hydrogen atom bonded to an electronegative atom forms an electrostatic connection with another electronegative atom through interacting dipoles or charges.  Reactions  A compound can be converted to a different chemical composition by interaction with a second chemical compound via a chemical reaction. In this process, bonds between atoms are broken in both of the interacting compounds, and then bonds are reformed so that new associations are made between atoms. Schematically, this reaction could be described as , where A, B, C, and D are each unique atoms; and AB, AD, CD, and CB are each unique compounds.

In his first year at Keio, he learned of Hideki Noda through Noda's troupe, , who had their final performance in 1992. Noda's modern and \\"unexpected\\" style influenced Okada's earlier works.

He received his first award, Yokohama Cultural Award / Yokohama Award for Art and Cultural Encouragement in 2005. In the same year, Five Days in March, a play that juxtaposes a couple spending five days in a love hotel against the beginning of the Iraq War, won the 49th Kishida Prize for Drama. was a finalist at the 2005 Toyota Choreography Awards. In 2006, Okada participated as the representative for Japan in the Stuecke '06/International Literature Project in M√ºlheim, Germany during the 2006 FIFA World Cup. In December 2006, was presented at the New National Theatre Tokyo. In contrast to his international acclaim, Enjoy was not well received by Japanese theater critics, who voted the play as the year's worst play. Between 2006 and 2007, he was appointed the director of the Performing Arts Festival \\"Summit\\" at the Komaba Agora Theater, where one of his role models, Oriza Hirata served as the artistic director. His book, , was published in February 2007 and consisted of two novels. One is a reworking of his play Five Days in March; the other, an earlier piece, is called . The book received the 2008 ≈åe Kenzabur≈ç Prize. In 2015, Okada was nominated for the 28th Mishima Yukio Prize for his novel adaptation of his play, , which was first staged at the Kanagawa Arts Theatre on April 20, 2012.

Since 2012, he has been a judge for Kishida Prize for Drama. He also leads workshop programs with theater students in Japanese universities during his free time. Style Okada's works represent the \\"lost generation,\\" the generation that is most affected by the Japanese recession in the 1990s. Faced with economic and political challenges that were set by the bubble burst, young Japanese people are forced to have part-time work for which they are overqualified. One of his plays, , explores this issue of unemployment and temporary employment. The story follows the stories of struggling freeters in their 20s and 30s who work in a manga caf√©. Okada‚Äôs works deal with everyday life, pertaining to work, love, and personal life. Rather than directly addressing recent social issues in Japan like Ai Nagai and Y≈çji Sakate, Okada focuses on connecting to his audience's sense of alienation by separating speech and movement in his plays. Okada's hyperrealistic style is often referred to as \\"super real Japanese,\\" which draws influence from Oriza Hirata's \\"quiet theater\\" movement from the 1980s. His works are distinguished by the use of fragmented and abbreviated idiosyncratic language in the vernacular of Japanese in their twenties, which is deliberately inarticulate, drawn out, and circular. Exaggerating the natural rhythms in human speech, his works comically integrate \\"natural\\" Japanese speech that is filled with passive verb forms and chains of dependent clauses, with no periods. A typical example is from the opening of Enjoy, translated by Aya Ogawa: > ACTOR 1: We'll begin with Act One...

Accompanying the broken phrases is the physical body language of the performers, made up of disjointed and abstract movements that combine isolated pedestrian gestures. The choreography he uses in his play is very different from highly coordinated dancing, as it focuses on \\"junk body\\" or \\"child‚Äôs body\\" choreography that rejects adult sexuality and Western dance techniques. Okada was inspired by Hirata's quote, \\"It is strange for the actors to tap into their self-consciousness when speaking their lines.\\" Okada believes that his actors should be able to manipulate their consciousness and balance their attention on both their words and movement. The gap between language and the body is the lived experiences each performer gathers from their environment to bring to their performances, and they use the external body to reflect those lived experiences or \\"images.\\"Uchino, Tadashi (2006) \\"Globality's Children: Thinking through the \\"Child's\\" Body As a Strategy of Flatness in Performance\\". The Drama Review 50 (1): 57‚Äì66. Okada advises his actors to not be overly attached with the language or the physicality of the performance so that the audience can interpret the \\"image,\\" themselves. Actors are one single entity to the image; in addition, Okada uses \\"the performance's disjointed elements of language, movement, design, music, and more\\" to signify the \\"image\\" in his plays. His works are heavily influenced by Bertolt Brecht's Verfremdungseffekt technique that detaches the audience from the action in the play. Okada refers to the theater as a place for performers to interact with the audience. Therefore, his performers usually use indirect, third-person speech in their monologues and narrate directly to the audience in his plays, which breaks the fourth wall. His characters are often labelled only \\"Actor One,\\" with the same \\"character\\" played by more than one performer. Okada constantly implements contemporary issues and speech styles into his text. Following the T≈çhoku earthquake in 2011, he wrote Current Location, a play that reintroduces the concept of \\"haisha no tachiba\\" which literally translates to \\"from the standpoint of the afflicted people.\\" He confronts the reality that post- earthquake victims in Fukushima faced by juxtaposing distinct voices using the particle, wa, which allows the victims to speak harmoniously while in discord.

The system of companies was often colloquially called Ma Bell (as in \\"Mother Bell\\"), as it held a near-complete monopoly over telephone service in most areas of the United States and Canada. At the time of its breakup in the early 1980s, the Bell System had assets of $150 billion (equivalent to $ billion in ) and employed over one million people. In the early 1970s, American antitrust regulators became suspicious that Bell was abusing its monopoly power, and in 1974 the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice brought a lawsuit against Bell claiming violations of the Sherman Act. In 1982, feeling that it could not win, Bell agreed to a Justice Department-mandated consent decree that settled the lawsuit and ordered it to break itself up into seven \\"Regional Bell Operating Companies\\" (known as \\"The Baby Bells\\"), which it did in 1984, ending the original company's existence. These \\"Baby Bells\\" are now independent companies, and several of them are very large corporations in their own right, such as AT&T;, Verizon Communications, and CenturyLink.  History  Logo used from 1889 to 1900 In 1877, the American Bell Telephone Company, named after Alexander Graham Bell, opened the first telephone exchange in New Haven, Connecticut. Within a few years local exchange companies were established in every major city in the United States. Use of the Bell System name initially referred to those early telephone franchises and eventually comprised all telephone companies owned by American Telephone & Telegraph, referred to internally as associated companies, regional holding companies, or later Bell operating companies (BOCs). In 1899, American Telephone & Telegraph (AT&T;) acquired the assets of its parent, the American Bell Telephone Company. American Bell had created AT&T; to provide long-distance calls between New York and Chicago and beyond. AT&T; became the parent of American Bell Telephone Company, and thus the head of the Bell System, because regulatory and tax rules were leaner in New York than in Boston, where American Bell was headquartered. Later, the Bell System and its moniker \\"Ma Bell\\" became a term that referred generally to all AT&T; companies of which there were four major divisions: * AT&T; Long Lines, providing long lines to interconnect local exchanges and long-distance calling services * Western Electric Company, Bell's equipment manufacturing arm * Bell Labs, conducting research and development for AT&T; * Bell operating companies, providing local exchange telephone services. In 1913, the federal government challenged the Bell System's growing monopoly over the phone system under AT&T; ownership in an anti-trust suit, leading to the Kingsbury Commitment. Under the commitment, AT&T; escaped break-up or nationalization in exchange for divesting itself of Western Union and allowing non-competing independent telephone companies to interconnect with its long- distance network. After 1934, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assumed regulation of AT&T.; Proliferation of telephone service allowed the company to become the largest corporation in the world until its dismantling by the United States Department of Justice in 1984, at which time the Bell System ceased to exist. Formation under Bell patent 1912 Bell System advertisement promoting its slogan for universal service Receiving a U.S. patent for the invention of the telephone on March 7, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell formed the Bell Telephone Company in 1877, which in 1885 became AT&T.; When Bell's original patent expired 15 years later in 1894, the telephone market opened to competition and 6,000 new telephone companies started while the Bell Telephone company took a significant financial downturn. On April 30, 1907, Theodore Newton Vail returned as President of AT&T.; Vail believed in the superiority of one national telephone system and AT&T; adopted the slogan One Policy, One System, Universal Service. This became the company's philosophy for the next 70 years. Under Vail, AT&T; began acquiring many of the smaller telephone companies including Western Union telegraph. Kingsbury Commitment Anxious to avoid action from government antitrust suits, AT&T; entered in 1913 into an out-of-court agreement known as the Kingsbury Commitment with the federal government. AT&T; committed to sell its $30 million in Western Union capital stock, allow competitors to interconnect with its system, and not acquire other independent companies without permission from the Interstate Commerce Commission.Brooks, John. Telephone: The First Hundred Years, Harper & Row, 1976, . Logo style of Bell System affiliated companies from 1921 to 1969 195 Broadway, AT&T; headquarters for most of the 20th century The Spirit of Communication as used on the Bell System's directories in the 1930s‚Äì40s Nationwide monopoly The Bell trademark pictured here was used from 1921 through 1969 by both the AT&T; corporation and the regional operating corporations to co-brand themselves under a single Bell System trademark. For each regional operating company, its name was placed where \\"name of associated company\\" appears in this template version of the trademark. Bell system telephones and related equipment were made by Western Electric, a wholly owned subsidiary of AT&T; Co. Member telephone companies paid a fixed fraction of their revenues as a license fee to Bell Labs. As a result of this vertical monopoly, the Bell System effectively owned most telephone service in the United States by 1940, from local and long-distance service to the telephones. This allowed Bell to prohibit its customers from connecting equipment not made or sold by Bell to the system without paying fees. For example, if a customer desired a style of telephone not leased by the local Bell company, he or she had to purchase the instrument at cost, furnish it to the telephone company for rewiring, pay a service charge, and a monthly lease fee for using it. In 1949, the United States Department of Justice alleged in an antitrust lawsuit that AT&T; and the Bell System operating companies were using their near-monopoly in telecommunications to attempt to establish unfair advantage in related technologies. The outcome was a 1956 consent decree limiting AT&T; to 85% of the United States' national telephone network and certain government contracts, and from continuing to hold interests in Canada and the Caribbean. The Bell System's Canadian operations included the Bell Canada regional operating company and the Northern Electric manufacturing subsidiary of the Bell System's Western Electric equipment manufacturer. Western Electric divested Northern Electric in 1956, but AT&T; did not divest itself of Bell Canada until 1975. ITT Corporation, then known as International Telephone & Telegraph Co., purchased the Bell System's Caribbean regional operating companies. The Bell System also owned various Caribbean regional operating companies, as well as 54% of Japan's NEC and a post-World War II reconstruction relationship with Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) before the 1956 boundaries were emplaced. Before 1956, the Bell System's reach was truly gargantuan. Even during the period from 1956 to 1984, the Bell System's dominant reach into all forms of communications was pervasive within the United States and influential in telecommunication standardization throughout the industrialized world. The 1984 Bell System divestiture brought an end to the affiliation branded as the Bell System. It resulted from another antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1974, alleging illegal practices by the Bell System companies to stifle competition in the telecommunications industry. The parties settled the suit on January 8, 1982, superseding the former restrictions that AT&T; and the DOJ had agreed upon in 1956.  Present-day usage of the Bell name  The Bell System service marks, including the circled-bell logo, especially as redesigned by Saul Bass in 1969, and the words Bell System in text, were used before January 1, 1984, when the AT&T; divestiture of its regional operating companies took effect. The word mark Bell, the logo, and other related trademarks, are held by each of the remaining Bell companies, namely AT&T;, Verizon, CenturyLink, and Cincinnati Bell.USPTO record for trademark serial no. 73727728 (example \\"Bell\\" registration originally held by Pacific Telesis): \\"Registration is nationwide, but is subject to the condition that registrant shall use the mark only in conjunction with one or more of the following modifiers; \\"Nevada Bell\\", \\"Pacific Bell\\", \\"Pacific Telephone\\", \\"Pacific Telesis\\", or \\"PacTel\\".

Registrant's right to exclusive use of the mark is subject to the rights of the [other RBOCs], to which concurrent registrations in the mark have also been issued, to use the mark in conjunction with one or more of the modifiers specified in those registrations[...]\\" International rights to the marks, except for Canada, are held by a joint venture of these companies, Bell IP Holdings. Verizon payphone with the Bell logo Of the various resulting 1984 spinoffs, only BellSouth actively used and promoted the Bell name and logo during its entire history, from the 1984 break-up to its merger with the new AT&T; in 2006. Similarly, cessation of using either the Bell name or logo occurred for many of the other companies more than a decade after the 1984 break-up as part of an acquisition-related rebranding. The others have only used the marks on rare occasions to maintain their trademark rights, even less now that they have adopted names conceived long after divestiture. Examples include Verizon, which still used the Bell logo on its trucks and payphones until it updated its own logo in 2015, and Qwest, formerly US West, which licenses the Northwestern Bell and Mountain Bell names to Unical Enterprises, who makes telephones under the Northwestern Bell name. Cincinnati Bell, a local franchise of the Bell System that was never wholly owned by AT&T; and existed separately prior to 1984, also continues to use the Bell name. It stopped using the Bell logo in the summer of 2006, though it is still seen on some bills, vehicles, and other literature. In 1984, each regional Bell operating company was assigned a set list of names it was allowed to use in combination with the Bell marks. Aside from Cincinnati Bell, all these Bell System names have disappeared from the United States business landscape. Southwestern Bell used both the Bell name and the circled-bell trademark until SBC opted for all of its companies to do business under the \\"SBC\\" name in 2002. Bell Atlantic used the Bell name and circled-bell trademark until renaming itself Verizon in 2000. Pacific Bell continued operating in California under that name (or the shortened \\"PacBell\\" nickname) until SBC purchased it. In Canada, Bell Canada (divested from AT&T; in 1975) continues to use the Bell name. For the decades that Nortel was named Northern Telecom, its research and development arm was Bell Northern Research. Bell Canada and its holding-company parent, Bell Canada Enterprises, still use the Bell name and used variations of the circled-bell logo until 1977, which until 1976 strongly resembled the 1921 to 1939 Bell System trademark shown above.  Subsidiaries =Pre-1956 international holdings Before the 1956 break- up, the Bell System included the companies listed below, plus those listed in the pre-1984 section. Northern Electric and the Caribbean regional operating companies were considered part of the Bell System proper before the break-up. Nippon Electric was considered a more distant affiliate of Western Electric, and through its own research and development adapted the designs of Western Electric's North American telecommunications equipment for use in Japan, which to this day gives much of Japan's telephone equipment and network a closer resemblance to North American ANSI and iconectiv standards than to European- originated ITU-T standards. Before the 1956 break-up, Northern Electric was focused on manufacturing, without significant telecommunication-equipment research & development of its own. The operation of Japan's NTT during the post-World War II occupation was considered an administrative adjunct to the North American Bell System. * Nortel Networks Corporation, formerly Northern Telecom, an equipment-manufacturing company  Northern Electric, a former telecommunications equipment-manufacturing subsidiary of Western Electric  Dominion Electric, a former recording equipment-manufacturing company * Various former Caribbean regional operating companies, sold to ITT * NEC, an equipment-manufacturing company in Japan  Nippon Electric, a former telecommunications equipment-manufacturing company 54% owned by Western Electric * NTT, a telecommunications company in Japan that was administered by AT&T; as part of General Douglas MacArthur's post-WWII reconstruction Manhole cover with Bell System logo Pre-1984 breakup Immediately before the 1984 break-up, the Bell System had the following corporate structure: * American Telephone and Telegraph Company, a holding company and long-distance carrier  Illinois Bell Telephone Company  Indiana Bell Telephone Company, Incorporated  Michigan Bell Telephone Company  New England Telephone and Telegraph Company  New Jersey Bell Telephone Company  New York Telephone Company  Northwestern Bell Telephone Company  Pacific Northwest Bell Telephone Company  South Central Bell Telephone Company  Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company  Southwestern Bell Telephone Company  The Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania  The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company  The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Maryland  The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of West Virginia  The Chesapeake and Potomac Telephone Company of Virginia  The Diamond State Telephone Company  The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph Company * Malheur Home Telephone Company  The Ohio Bell Telephone Company  The Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company * Bell Telephone Company of Nevada  Wisconsin Telephone Company *Other subsidiaries:  Bell Canada (1880‚Äì1975) * Northern Electric (equipment manufacturing in Canada) (1914‚Äì1956)  Western Electric Co., Inc.

It is part of the North Platte Public Schools district.  History  The first public school in North Platte was a log schoolhouse located at the corner of 5th and Dewey streets. Built in 1868 using private funds and made of \\"red cedar logs which were obtained in the canyons south of the river,\\" it opened on November 30, 1868, with less than twelve students. That number grew to around 80 by 1870, and despite an addition finished that year, the building became inadequate. Work began on a new building in 1873. The log school was sold at auction in 1874 for $611. It served several private functions until it was later torn down in April of 1921. The first North Platte High School building, completed in 1874. By 1874 the student population numbered 270, and on August 27 of that year, work was finished on a two-story brick school built between Third and Fourth streets on North Dewey. The building was damaged by an earthquake less than a year after its completion and, despite repairs, was declared unsafe in 1899. In 1900, a new high school was completed on the same lot. It contained an auditorium, seven classrooms, and five recitation rooms. By 1920, North Platte's student population had grown to 1,685, and the building became crowded. It was eventually demolished in 1932 following a report in 1926 by engineers which stated, according to the Superintendent, that the \\"building was unsafe in a high wind.\\" A number of the city's ward schools (schools for lower grades) were first constructed during its lifetime to accommodate increasing demand (most have since been completely rebuilt). The second North Platte High School building, completed in 1900 and demolished in 1932. In response to further increasing population, voters approved a $480,000 bond issue on May 28, 1929 to build a new high school (and for other purposes) on a 15-acre tract on west Second street at what was then the western edge of North Platte. The new building cost around $364,000 (in 1929 dollars), contained reinforced concrete floors and 700 recessed lockers, and was faced in red brick with terra cotta trim. It was dedicated on March 13, 1931. At the same time, a new track, athletic field, and concrete stadium with seating for 1500 were constructed just south of the new building. The school had 485 students and 22 teachers in its first year, but these numbers did not include the incoming freshman class which was scheduled to attend the school the following year. It had a capacity of 750 students and a \\"crowded capacity\\" of 900. The 1930 building also featured an auditorium which, according to the 1931 Round-Up publication, was the largest in western Nebraska at the time. Eventually known as the Little Theater, it originally contained both bleachers and wooden seats, together providing a capacity for 1,100 people. It also had an orchestra pit, a balcony, and side dressing rooms. Part of the school modernization effort in the 1970s (discussed below) provided for the transformation of the auditorium into a fine arts theater. Its final performance was the 2003 Miss Nebraska Scholarship Pageant. The third North Platte High School building, completed in 1930 and demolished in 2003. Pressured by overcrowded conditions at the existing junior high school which caused freshmen to attend the senior high school, another bond issue, approved by a \\"substantial majority\\" on April 6, 1948, called for the construction of a new junior high on the same site as the senior high school. Adams Junior High was completed in 1950 to the west of the 1930 building at a cost of $987,000. In 1963, an addition on the west end the senior high school was built as part of a $2 million bond. The addition was opened in time for the 1963-64 school year and contained new rooms for science, vocal music, and art, as well as new gymnasiums for physical education, wrestling, and gymnastics, an auto mechanics shop, a wood shop, a new library, and a cafeteria with seating for 300. In the 1970s, a need was recognized to expand, replace, and modernize many of the city's schools. A 166-page report by the University of Northern Colorado's Educational Planning Service about current conditions throughout the school district noted that, in regards to the high school, with both the senior and junior high schools on the same 28-acre site, it was \\"severely congested.\\" The report also found that many of the senior high schools' classrooms were too small and that the building itself was overcrowded. In 1975, the Citizens Advisory Committee distributed Look and See, a small brochure which highlighted safety and efficacy concerns at a number of school buildings and urged voters to support an upcoming bond issue to deal with them. The $9.99 million bond was approved by 60% of those voting on October 21, 1975. Part of the measure called for the construction of a new junior high school on another site (now known as Adams Middle School) and the subsequent connection of the 1930 and 1963 sections of North Platte High School with Adams Junior High, creating a larger senior high school. This arrangement remained until January of 1998 when another citizens group, the North Platte High School Facilities Task Force, was formed in order to \\"identify and prioritize the North Platte School District's high school facilities needs,\\" to find a solution to those needs, and to recommend the solution to the Board of Education. It completed its work in April, 1999. The task force identified a number of \\"immediate needs\\" concerning the building's site, security, educational space, mechanical systems, life safety, and accessibility. The group considered both the renovation of the existing building as well as a new construction project and found that \\"the total costs of the solutions involving renovation were substantially similar to the cost of constructing a new building on the same site.\\" The group's report noted that the total cost of ownership would be lower for new construction and that renovation did not resolve all of the concerns it had found. As a result, the group recommended the construction of a new facility on the same site. Despite previous elections for new construction which failed in 1971, 1993 and 1997, and a proposal for major renovation of the current building which failed in 1994, a bond issue for the task force's proposal was passed by 63% of voters on April 4, 2000. Community members broke ground for the new building on April 7, 2001, and the project was completed in the fall of 2003 at an approximate cost of $29 million. All three sections of the old high school were demolished and the ground where they sat became the new facility's parking lot. Three time capsules, one from the cornerstone of the 1930 building, one from 1987, and a brand new capsule containing a 2003-2004 school yearbook and other items, were placed in the new facility's cornerstone during the dedication ceremony on September 14, 2003. The 270,000-square-foot building has a capacity of 1,600 students (expandable to 2,000 with additions) and features an energy-efficient ground source heat pump heating and cooling system, a large common area, larger gymnasiums, classrooms, and cafeteria, a 1,200-seat performing arts auditorium, a media center, and modern computer, camera, life safety, and security systems.

The Vinalia prima (\\"first Vinalia\\"), also known as the Vinalia urbana (\\"Urban Vinalia\\") was held on 23 April to bless and sample last year's wine and ask for good weather until the next harvest. The Vinalia rustica (\\"Rustic Vinalia\\") was on 19 August, before the harvest and grape-pressing. Vinalia Urbana Fragment of the Fasti Praenestini showing the April Vinalia (VIN) The Vinalia Urbana was held on 23 April. It was predominantly a wine festival, shared by Venus as patron of \\"profane\\" wine (vinum spurcum) intended for everyday human use, and Jupiter as patron of the strongest, purest, sacrificial grade wine (temetum). In honour of Venus, whose powers had provided humankind with ordinary wine, men and women alike sampled the vinum spurcum of the previous autumn's pressing. As god of the weather on which the wine-harvest depended, Jupiter was offered a special libation of the previous year's sacred wine vintage, blessed by his high priest and poured into a ditch outside Venus' Capitoline temple, probably under the gaze of Rome's higher echelons.Olivier de Cazanove, \\"Jupiter, Liber et le vin latin\\", Revue de l'histoire des religions, 1988, Vol. 205, Issue 205-3, pp. 245‚Äì265 persee Common girls (vulgares puellae) and prostitutes (meretrices) gathered at Venus Erycina's Colline temple - probably on separate occasions, for propriety's sake - to offer the goddess myrtle, mint, and rushes concealed in rose-bunches. In return, they asked her for \\"beauty and popular favour\\", and to be made \\"charming and witty\\".Staples, Ariadne, From Good Goddess to vestal virgins: sex and category in Roman religion, Routledge, 1998, pp. 122‚Äì124, citing Ovid, Fasti, 4,863‚Äì872. Vinalia Rustica The Vinalia Rustica was held on 19 August. It was originally a rustic Latin harvest festival, celebrating the grape harvest, vegetable growth and fertility. At the Roman Vinalia Rustica, kitchen gardens and market-gardens, and presumably vineyards were dedicated to Venus Obsequens, the oldest known form of Venus.Vegetable-growers may have been involved in the dedications as a corporate guild: see Eden, P.T., \\"Venus and the Cabbage\\" Hermes, 91, (1963) p. 451. In Roman mythology, it marked the fulfillment of a vow by the ancient Latin allies of Rome's legendary ancestor Aeneas, who promised all wine of the next sacred vintage to Jupiter, in return for victory against the Etruscan tyrant Mezentius. According to some sources, the warlike Mezentius had claimed this vintage as his due, not Jupiter's. Roman opinions differ on which deity presided at the Vinalia Rustica; Varro insists that like the Vinalia Urbana, it was sacred to Jupiter, who controlled the weather that governed the growing and ripening of grapes; moreover Jupiter's priest picked the first bunch of grapes, blessed the first sacred pressing and offered a sacrifice; these observations are borne out by Pliny the Elder.Pliny, 18, 287. In practice, however, the festival had strong popular and cult connections to Venus as patron goddess of ordinary, religiously \\"impure\\" wine (vinum spurcum). Some of the rites took place at her various temples. The sacrificial victim offered by Jupiter's priest, a female lamb (agna) may be evidence if not of Venus herself, then of an ancient, rustic Latin goddess very much like her.For associations of kind between Roman deities and their sacrificial victims, see Victima.Lipka, Michael, Roman Gods: A Conceptual Approach, BRILL, 2009, p. 42; citing Varro, Lingua Latina, 6. 16; Varro's explicit denial that the festival belongs to Venus implies his awareness of the opposite opinion. Lipka offers this apparent contradiction as an example of two Roman cults that offer \\"complementary functional foci\\" within a single festival. An account of the origins and rise of this festival is given by Festus.

In 1984, Apple debuted the operating system that is now known as the \\"Classic\\" Mac OS with its release of the original Macintosh System Software. The system, rebranded \\"Mac OS\\" in 1996, was preinstalled on every Macintosh until 2002 and offered on Macintosh clones for a short time in the 1990s. Noted for its ease of use, it was also criticized for its lack of modern technologies compared to its competitors. The current Mac operating system is macOS, originally named \\"Mac OS X\\" until 2012 and then \\"OS X\\" until 2016. Developed between 1997 and 2001 after Apple's purchase of NeXT, Mac OS X brought an entirely new architecture based on NeXTSTEP, a Unix system, that eliminated many of the technical challenges that the classic Mac OS faced. The current macOS is preinstalled with every Mac and is updated annually. It is the basis of Apple's current system software for its other devices ‚Äì iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Prior to the introduction of Mac OS X, Apple experimented with several other concepts, releasing different products designed to bring the Macintosh interface or applications to Unix-like systems or vice versa, A/UX, MAE, and MkLinux. Apple's effort to expand upon and develop a replacement for its classic Mac OS in the 1990s led to a few cancelled projects, code named Star Trek, Taligent, and Copland. Although they have different architectures, the Macintosh operating systems share a common set of GUI principles, including a menu bar across the top of the screen; the Finder shell, featuring a desktop metaphor that represents files and applications using icons and relates concepts like directories and file deletion to real-world objects like folders and a trash can; and overlapping windows for multitasking.  Classic Mac OS  Mac OS 9, released in 1999 The \\"classic\\" Mac OS is the original Macintosh operating system that was introduced in 1984 alongside the first Macintosh and remained in primary use on Macs until the introduction of Mac OS X in 2001. Apple released the original Macintosh on January 24, 1984; its early system software was partially based on the Lisa OS and the Xerox PARC Alto computer, which former Apple CEO Steve Jobs previewed. It was originally named \\"System Software\\", or simply \\"System\\"; Apple rebranded it as \\"Mac OS\\" in 1996 due in part to its Macintosh clone program that ended a year later. Classic Mac OS is characterized by its monolithic design. Initial versions of the System Software run one application at a time. System 5 introduced cooperative multitasking. System 7 supports 32-bit memory addressing and virtual memory, allowing larger programs. Later updates to the System 7 enable the transition to the PowerPC architecture. The system was considered user- friendly, but its architectural limitations were critiqued, such as limited memory management, lack of protected memory and access controls, and susceptibility to conflicts among extensions.  Releases  The text-only logo for Classic Mac OS starting with Mac OS 7.6, released in 1997 Nine major versions of the classic Mac OS were released.

Although the system was originally marketed as simply \\"version 10\\" of Mac OS, it has a history that is largely independent of the classic Mac OS. It is a Unix-based operating system built on NeXTSTEP and other technology developed at NeXT from the late 1980s until early 1997, when Apple purchased the company and its CEO Steve Jobs returned to Apple. Precursors to the original release of Mac OS X include OpenStep, Apple's Rhapsody project, and the Mac OS X Public Beta. macOS makes use of the BSD codebase and the XNU kernel, and its core set of components is based upon Apple's open source Darwin operating system. macOS is the basis for some of Apple's other operating systems, including iPhone OS/iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.

It was followed by several more official server-based releases. Server functionality has instead been offered as an add-on for the desktop system since 2011. * Mac OS X Server 1.0 ‚Äì code name \\"Hera\\", released in 1999 * macOS Server ‚Äì several releases since 2001 Other projects= Shipped A/ROSE= The Apple Real-time Operating System Environment (A/ROSE) was a small embedded operating system which ran on the Macintosh Coprocessor Platform, an expansion card for the Macintosh. The idea was to offer a single \\"overdesigned\\" hardware platform on which third-party vendors could build practically any product, reducing the otherwise heavy workload of developing a NuBus-based expansion card. The first version of the system was ready for use in February 1988. =A/UX= In 1988, Apple released its first UNIX-based OS, A/UX, which was a UNIX operating system with the Mac OS look and feel. It was not very competitive for its time, due in part to the crowded UNIX market and Macintosh hardware lacking high-end design features present on workstation-class computers. A/UX had most of its success in sales to the U.S. government, where POSIX compliance was a requirement that Mac OS could not meet. =MAE= The Macintosh Application Environment (MAE) was a software package introduced by Apple in 1994 that allowed users of certain Unix-based computer workstations to run Apple Macintosh application software. MAE used the X Window System to emulate a Macintosh Finder-style graphical user interface. The last version, MAE 3.0, was compatible with System 7.5.3. MAE was available for Sun Microsystems SPARCstation and Hewlett-Packard systems. It was discontinued on May 14, 1998. =MkLinux= Announced at the 1996 Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), MkLinux is an open source operating system that was started by the OSF Research Institute and Apple in February 1996 to port Linux to the PowerPC platform, and thus Macintosh computers. In mid 1998, the community-led MkLinux Developers Association took over development of the operating system. MkLinux is short for \\"Microkernel Linux,\\" which refers to the project's adaptation of the Linux kernel to run as a server hosted atop the Mach microkernel. MkLinux is based on version 3.0 of Mach.  Cancelled Star Trek= Star Trek (as in \\"to boldly go where no Mac has gone before\\") was a relatively unknown secret prototype beginning in 1992, whose goal was to create a version of the classic Mac OS that would run on Intel-compatible x86 personal computers. In partnership with Apple and with support from Intel, the project was instigated by Novell, which was looking to integrate its DR-DOS with the Mac OS GUI as a mutual response to the monopoly of Microsoft's Windows 3.0 and MS-DOS. A team consisting of four from Apple and four from Novell was able to get the Macintosh Finder and some basic applications such as QuickTime, running smoothly on the x86 architecture. The project was canceled a year later in early 1993, but some of the code was later reused when porting the Mac OS to PowerPC. =Taligent= Taligent (a portmanteau of \\"talent\\" and \\"intelligent\\") was the name of an object-oriented operating system and the company dedicated to producing it. Started as a project within Apple to provide a replacement for the classic Mac OS, it was later spun off into a joint venture with IBM as part of the AIM alliance, with the purpose of building a competing platform to Microsoft Cairo and NeXTSTEP. The development process never worked, and Taligent is often cited as an example of a project death march. Apple pulled out of the project in 1995 before the code had been delivered.\\"Apple surrenders the Pink (to Microsoft) \\", The Register, October 3, 2008. =Copland= Copland was a project at Apple to create an updated version of the classic Mac OS. It was to have introduced protected memory, preemptive multitasking and a number of new underlying operating system features, yet still be compatible with existing Mac software. As originally planned, a follow-up release known as \\"Gershwin\\" would add multithreading and other advanced features. New features were added more rapidly than they could be completed, and the completion date slipped into the future with no sign of a release. In 1996, Apple decided to cancel the project outright and find a suitable third-party system to replace it. Copland development ended in August 1996, and in December 1996, Apple announced that it was buying NeXT for its NeXTSTEP operating system. Timeline Related systems  Before the arrival of the Macintosh in 1984, Apple's history of operating systems began with its Apple II series computers in 1977, which ran Apple DOS, ProDOS, and later GS/OS; the Apple III in 1980, which ran Apple SOS; and the Apple Lisa in 1983, which ran Lisa OS and later MacWorks XL, a Macintosh emulator. Apple also developed the Newton OS for its Newton personal digital assistant from 1993 to 1997. In recent years, Apple has also launched several new operating systems based on the core of macOS, including iOS in 2007 for its iPhone, iPad, and iPod Touch mobile devices and in 2017 for its HomePod smart speakers; watchOS in 2015 for the Apple Watch; tvOS in 2015 for the Apple TV set-top box.

It includes annual summary reports comprising the statistics for power stations in the United States and Canada. GADS is the main source of power station outage data in North America. This reporting system, initiated by the electric utility industry in 1982, expands and extends the data collection procedures begun by the industry in 1963. NERC GADS is recognized today as a valuable source of reliability, availability, and maintainability (RAM) information.North American Electric Reliability Corporation's (NERC) Generating Availability Data System (GADS) Data Reporting Instructions (DRI). This information, collected for both total unit and major equipment groups, is used by analysts' industry-wide in numerous applications. GADS maintains complete operating histories on more than 5,800 generating units representing 71% of the installed generating capacity of the United States and Canada. GADS is a mandatory industry program for conventional generating units 50 MW and larger starting January 1, 2012 and 20 MW and larger starting January 1, 2013. GADS remains open to all non-required participants in the Regional Entities (shown in Figure I-2 of the NERC GADS DRI) and any other organization (domestic or international) that operate electric generating facilities who is willing to follow the GADS mandatory requirements as presented in the document Final GADSTF Recommendations Report dated July 20, 2011. GADS data consists of three data types: # Design ‚Äì equipment descriptions such as manufacturers, number of boiler feedwater pumps, steam turbine MW rating, etc. # Performance ‚Äì summaries of generation produced, fuels units, start ups, etc. # Event ‚Äì description of equipment failures such as when the event started/ended, type of outage (forced, maintenance, planned), etc. One example of such detail is that in its data pertaining to forced outages and unplanned unit failures, it makes the fine distinction between immediate, delayed, and postponed outages. An important statistic calculated from the raw GADS data is the Equivalent Forced Outage Rate (EFOR), which is the hours of unit failure (unplanned outage hours and equivalent unplanned derated hours) given as a percentage of the total hours of the availability of that unit (unplanned outage, unplanned derated, and service hours). Recently, in response to the deregulated energy markets, the Equivalent Forced Outage Rate ‚Äì Demand (EFORd) has taken on greater importance: * The probability that a unit will not meet its demand periods for generating requirements. * Best measure of reliability for all loading types (base, cycling, peaking, etc.) * Best measure of reliability for all unit types (fossil, nuclear, gas turbines, diesels, etc.) * For demand period measures and not for the full 24-hour clock. Industry Development of GADS Before any data element was included in GADS, an industry committee to determine its applicability to utility operation and RAM analyses scrutinized it. A series of industry meetings were held to discuss the analytical usefulness of each element and to determine if utilities could reasonably provide that data to GADS. Consequently, the only data requested in the GADS Data Reporting Instructions (DRI) meet industry-prescribed needs. The industry also realized a need to include standardized terminology in the GADS program if it were to function on an international scale. As a result, the definitions promulgated by The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers' (IEEE) Standard 762, \\"Definitions for Reporting Electric Generating Unit Reliability, Availability and Productivity\\" were incorporated. Utilities started their reporting using the GADS guidelines on January 1, 1982. GADS superseded the earlier data collection procedures begun by the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), a program started in the mid-1960s. GADS contains many of the same elements previously collected by EEI in addition to the many new data items. This seeming duplication of data was done intentionally: the EEI information can be derived from GADS so analyses that include data from earlier than 1982 can be completed.

Any other quantity of that kind can be expressed as a multiple of the unit of measurement. For example, a length is a physical quantity. The metre is a unit of length that represents a definite predetermined length. When we say 10 metres (or 10 m), we actually mean 10 times the definite predetermined length called \\"metre\\". Measurement is a process of determining how large or small a physical quantity is as compared to a basic reference quantity of the same kind. The definition, agreement, and practical use of units of measurement have played a crucial role in human endeavour from early ages up to the present. A multitude of systems of units used to be very common. Now there is a global standard, the International System of Units (SI), the modern form of the metric system. In trade, weights and measures is often a subject of governmental regulation, to ensure fairness and transparency. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) is tasked with ensuring worldwide uniformity of measurements and their traceability to the International System of Units (SI). Metrology is the science of developing nationally and internationally accepted units of measurement. In physics and metrology, units are standards for measurement of physical quantities that need clear definitions to be useful. Reproducibility of experimental results is central to the scientific method. A standard system of units facilitates this. Scientific systems of units are a refinement of the concept of weights and measures historically developed for commercial purposes. Science, medicine, and engineering often use larger and smaller units of measurement than those used in everyday life. The judicious selection of the units of measurement can aid researchers in problem solving (see, for example, dimensional analysis). In the social sciences, there are no standard units of measurement and the theory and practice of measurement is studied in psychometrics and the theory of conjoint measurement. History A unit of measurement is a standardised quantity of a physical property, used as a factor to express occurring quantities of that property. Units of measurement were among the earliest tools invented by humans. Primitive societies needed rudimentary measures for many tasks: constructing dwellings of an appropriate size and shape, fashioning clothing, or bartering food or raw materials. The earliest known uniform systems of measurement seem to have all been created sometime in the 4th and 3rd millennia BC among the ancient peoples of Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Indus Valley, and perhaps also Elam in Persia as well. Weights and measures are mentioned in the Bible (Leviticus 19:35‚Äì36). It is a commandment to be honest and have fair measures. In the Magna Carta of 1215 (The Great Charter) with the seal of King John, put before him by the Barons of England, King John agreed in Clause 35 \\"There shall be one measure of wine throughout our whole realm, and one measure of ale and one measure of corn‚Äînamely, the London quart;‚Äîand one width of dyed and russet and hauberk cloths‚Äînamely, two ells below the selvage...\\" As of the 21st Century, multiple unit systems are used all over the world such as the United States Customary System, the British Customary System, and the International System. However, the United States is the only industrialized country that has not yet completely converted to the Metric System. The systematic effort to develop a universally acceptable system of units dates back to 1790 when the French National Assembly charged the French Academy of Sciences to come up such a unit system. This system was the precursor to the metric system which was quickly developed in France but did not take on universal acceptance until 1875 when The Metric Convention Treaty was signed by 17 nations. After this treaty was signed, a General Conference of Weights and Measures (CGPM) was established. The CGPM produced the current SI system which was adopted in 1954 at the 10th conference of weights and measures. Currently, the United States is a dual-system society which uses both the SI system and the US Customary system. Systems of units The use of a single unit of measurement for some quantity has obvious drawbacks. For example, it is impractical to use the same unit for the distance between two cities and the length of a needle. Thus, historically they would develop independently. One way to make large numbers or small fractions easier to read, is to use unit prefixes. At some point in time though, the need to relate the two units might arise, and consequently the need to choose one unit as defining the other or vice versa. For example, an inch could be defined in terms of a barleycorn. A system of measurement is a collection of units of measurement and rules relating them to each other. As science progressed, a need arose to relate the measurement systems of different quantities, like length and weight and volume. The effort of attempting to relate different traditional systems between each other exposed many inconsistencies, and brought about the development of new units and systems. The system of units varies from country to country and some of the different system of units are CGS system of units, FPS system of units, MKS system of units and SI system of units. Among the different system of units using in the world, the most widely used and internationally accepted one is the International System of Units, or SI system of units. In this SI units system, there are seven SI base units and three supplementary units. The base SI units are metre, kilogram, second, kelvin, ampere, candela and the mole and the three supplementary SI units are radian, steradian and becquerel. All other SI units can be derived from these base units. Systems of measurement in modern use include the metric system, the imperial system, and United States customary units. Traditional systems Historically many of the systems of measurement which had been in use were to some extent based on the dimensions of the human body. As a result, units of measure could vary not only from location to location, but from person to person. Metric systems Metric systems of units have evolved since the adoption of the original metric system in France in 1791. The current international standard metric system is the International System of Units (abbreviated to SI). An important feature of modern systems is standardization. Each unit has a universally recognized size. An example of metrication in 1860 when Tuscany became part of modern Italy (ex. one \\"libbra\\" = 339.54 grams) Both the imperial units and US customary units derive from earlier English units. Imperial units were mostly used in the British Commonwealth and the former British Empire. US customary units are still the main system of measurement used in the United States outside of science, medicine, many sectors of industry, and some of government and military, and despite Congress having legally authorised metric measure on 28 July 1866. as amended by Public Law 110‚Äì69 dated 9 August 2007 Some steps towards US metrication have been made, particularly the redefinition of basic US and imperial units to derive exactly from SI units. Since the international yard and pound agreement of 1959 the US and imperial inch is now defined as exactly , and the US and imperial avoirdupois pound is now defined as exactly . Natural systems While the above systems of units are based on arbitrary unit values, formalised as standards, some unit values occur naturally in science. Systems of units based on these are called natural units. Similar to natural units, atomic units (au) are a convenient system of units of measurement used in atomic physics. Also a great number of unusual and non-standard units may be encountered. These may include the solar mass (), the megaton (the energy released by detonating one million tons of trinitrotoluene, TNT) and the electronvolt. Legal control of weights and measures To reduce the incidence of retail fraud, many national statutes have standard definitions of weights and measures that may be used (hence \\"statute measure\\"), and these are verified by legal officers. Informal comparison to familiar concepts In informal settings, a quantity may be described as multiples of that of a familiar entity, which can be easier to contextualize than a value in a formal unit system. For instance, a publication may describe an area in a foreign country as a number of multiples of the area of a region local to the readership. The propensity for certain concepts to be used frequently can give rise to loosely defined \\"systems\\" of units. Base and derived units For most quantities a unit is necessary to communicate values of that physical quantity. For example, conveying to someone a particular length without using some sort of unit is impossible, because a length cannot be described without a reference used to make sense of the value given. But not all quantities require a unit of their own. Using physical laws, units of quantities can be expressed as combinations of units of other quantities. Thus only a small set of units is required. These units are taken as the base units and the other units are derived units. Thus base units are the units of the quantities which are independent of other quantities and they are the units of length, mass, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity and the amount of substance. Derived units are the units of the quantities which are derived from the base quantities and some of the derived units are the units of speed, work, acceleration, energy, pressure etc. Different systems of units are based on different choices of a set of related units including fundamental and derived units. Calculations with units of measurement=Units as dimensions Any value of a physical quantity is expressed as a comparison to a unit of that quantity. For example, the value of a physical quantity Z is expressed as the product of a unit [Z] and a numerical factor: :Z = n times [Z] = n [Z]. For example, let Z be \\"2 candlesticks\\", then Z = 2 [Z] = 2 candlestick. The multiplication sign is usually left out, just as it is left out between variables in scientific notation of formulas. The conventions used to express quantities is referred to as quantity calculus. In formulas the unit [Z] can be treated as if it were a specific magnitude of a kind of physical dimension: see dimensional analysis for more on this treatment. Units can only be added or subtracted if they are the same type; however units can always be multiplied or divided, as George Gamow used to explain. Let Z_1 be \\"2 candlesticks\\" and Z_2 \\"3 cabdrivers\\", then :\\"2 candlesticks\\" times \\"3 cabdrivers\\" = [Z_1][Z_2] = 6 candlestick times cabdriver. A distinction should be made between units and standards. A unit is fixed by its definition, and is independent of physical conditions such as temperature. By contrast, a standard is a physical realization of a unit, and realizes that unit only under certain physical conditions. For example, the metre is a unit, while a metal bar is a standard. One metre is the same length regardless of temperature, but a metal bar will be exactly one metre long only at a certain temperature. There are certain rules that have to be used when dealing with units: * Treat units algebraically. Only add like terms. When a unit is divided by itself, the division yields a unitless one. When two different units are multiplied or divided, the result is a new unit, referred to by the combination of the units. For instance, in SI, the unit of speed is metres per second (m/s). See dimensional analysis. A unit can be multiplied by itself, creating a unit with an exponent (e.g. m2/s2). Put simply, units obey the laws of indices. (See Exponentiation.) * Some units have special names, however these should be treated like their equivalents. For example, one newton (N) is equivalent to 1 kg‚ãÖm/s2. Thus a quantity may have several unit designations, for example: the unit for surface tension can be referred to as either N/m (newton per metre) or kg/s2 (kilogram per second squared). Expressing a physical value in terms of another unit Conversion of units involves comparison of different standard physical values, either of a single physical quantity or of a physical quantity and a combination of other physical quantities. Starting with: :Z = n_i times [Z]_i replace the original unit [Z]_i with its meaning in terms of the desired unit [Z]_j, e.g. if [Z]_i = c_{ij} times [Z]_j, then: :Z = n_i times (c_{ij} times [Z]_j) = (n_i times c_{ij}) times [Z]_j Now n_i and c_{ij} are both numerical values, so just calculate their product. Or, which is just mathematically the same thing, multiply Z by unity, the product is still Z: :Z = n_i times [Z]_i times ( c_{ij} times [Z]_j/[Z]_i ) For example, you have an expression for a physical value Z involving the unit feet per second ([Z]_i) and you want it in terms of the unit miles per hour ([Z]_j): {5280,mathrm{ft}}quad mathrm{and}quad 1 = frac{3600,mathrm{s}}{1,mathrm{h}} 3= Last, multiply the original expression of the physical value by the fraction, called a conversion factor, to obtain the same physical value expressed in terms of a different unit. Note: since valid conversion factors are dimensionless and have a numerical value of one, multiplying any physical quantity by such a conversion factor (which is 1) does not change that physical quantity. : 52.8,frac{mathrm{ft}}{mathrm{s}} = 52.8,frac{mathrm{ft}}{mathrm{s}} frac{1,mathrm{mi}}{5280,mathrm{ft}} frac{3600,mathrm{s}}{1,mathrm{h}} = frac {52.8 times 3600}{5280},mathrm{mi/h} = 36,mathrm{mi/h} }} Or as an example using the metric system, you have a value of fuel economy in the unit litres per 100 kilometres and you want it in terms of the unit microlitres per metre: : mathrm{frac{9,rm{L}}{100,rm{km}}} = mathrm{frac{9,rm{L}}{100,rm{km}}} mathrm{frac{1000000,rm{mu L}}{1,rm{L}}} mathrm{frac{1,rm{km}}{1000,rm{m}}} = frac {9 times 1000000}{100 times 1000},mathrm{mu L/m} = 90,mathrm{mu L/m} Real- world implications One example of the importance of agreed units is the failure of the NASA Mars Climate Orbiter, which was accidentally destroyed on a mission to Mars in September 1999 instead of entering orbit due to miscommunications about the value of forces: different computer programs used different units of measurement (newton versus pound force). Considerable amounts of effort, time, and money were wasted. On 15 April 1999, Korean Air cargo flight 6316 from Shanghai to Seoul was lost due to the crew confusing tower instructions (in metres) and altimeter readings (in feet). Three crew and five people on the ground were killed. Thirty-seven were injured. In 1983, a Boeing 767 (which thanks to its pilot's gliding skills landed safely and became known as the Gimli Glider) ran out of fuel in mid-flight because of two mistakes in figuring the fuel supply of Air Canada's first aircraft to use metric measurements. This accident was the result of both confusion due to the simultaneous use of metric and Imperial measures and confusion of mass and volume measures. When planning his journey across the Atlantic Ocean in the 1480s, Columbus mistakenly assumed that the mile referred to in the Arabic estimate of 56‚Öî miles for the size of a degree was the same as the actually much shorter Italian mile of 1,480 meters. His estimate for the size of the degree and for the circumference of the Earth was therefore about 25% too small.

Life and career Sosnowska studied at the Painting Department of the University of Fine Arts in Pozna≈Ñ (1993‚Äì1998), and the Rijksakademie van beeldende kunsten in Amsterdam (1999‚Äì2000). During her final years at the Pozna≈Ñ academy, she found that the \\"painting started to escape her canvas.\\" She began to create works that played with both two-dimensional painting and three-dimensional space, finally giving up on canvas altogether and instead using space itself as a sort of 3D painting. Sosnowska treats space as a medium for her works, always designing projects to fit into a specific space. Often she modifies pre-existent architecture, transforming physical space into mental space and playing with the viewer's perceptions. She explained: \\"I am especially interested in the moments when architectural space begins to take on the characteristics of mental space.\\"Monika Sosnowska, \\"Mala Alicja\\", (http://www.csw.art.pl) In 2004, she received the Ernst Schering Foundation academic scholarship.

It was founded in 1907 by several members of Montreal‚Äôs black community who experienced racial conflict and were banned from entering all-white churches. Union was started with a treasury of just $1.83.Moses, M.: Proud Past, Bright Future (Montreal: Union United Church of Montreal, 2008). The church has gone on to have a long and rich history, and celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2007. It is just one of the many churches that are part of the United Church of Canada. It is believed to be the only church affiliated with the United Church of Canada, however, that worships in the historically black tradition and has a predominantly black congregation.  History  In July 1907, a group of African Canadian railway porters and their wives met to establish a Christian church where they could freely worship in their own style after having been forced non-entry into other churches in Montreal. On September 1, Union Congregational Church was founded on $2 and held its first service with 26 attendees. The first pastor of the congregation was Rev. F.E. Bowser and the church was located at the Welsh Dance Hall, which was owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). Unlike most other black congregations in Canada, the church was founded by black Canadians from the United States as well as the West Indies. In the early years of the church, it was assisted by the Colored Women's Club, the oldest black women's club in Canada. The Coloured Women's Club was founded in 1902 by seven American women whose husbands worked as railway porters; the club was modelled after the National Association of Colored Women's Clubs (NACWC). The names of the founding members were: Mr. and Mrs. W.A. Jackson, Mr. and Mrs. E.F. Taylor, Mr. and Mrs. Charles Allen; Messers David Jones, J. Knight, Donovan, Kelly, and Arthur Ramsay; Mrs. B. Clarke, and Mrs. S. L. Durant. The church was opened in Welsh Hall on September 1, 1907, by Samuel Brown. Participating were 26 people who made up the first membership roll. The number reflected the country's decennial census, which revealed that there were only 401 people of African descent living in the entire province of Quebec. That widely regarded as an underestimatw, with 1,000 being closer to the real figure. In 1910, Union Church outgrew the Canadian Pacific Railway's Welsh Dance Hall and moved to Olivet Baptist Church on the corner of de la Montagne and de la Gauchetiere (formerly Mountain and Osborne). Union Church moved again in 1916 to the West End French Methodist Church, built in 1897, and located on 3007 and 3021 Delisle Street. In the years after World War I, the congregation grew because of an increase in railway porters relocating to Montreal from the United States and the West Indies. In 1925, the church joined the United Church of Canada as part of the amalgamation of many Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Methodist churches across the country to form the denomination. Numerous black organizations met or were founded in the basement of Union United Church, including the Negro Community Centre, The Excelsior Debating and Dramatic Club, the Negro Theatre Guild, and the Phyllis Wheatley Art Club. In 1976, Montreal Mayor Jean Drapeau's Parti Civique announced a plan to expand the metro line by building a new station in Downtown Montreal on Atwater Avenue, directly behind Union United Church. Many feared that the church would be demolished and forced to relocate; as a result, historian Leo W. Bertley wrote Montreal's Oldest Black Congregation to help preserve the history of Union United Church. All proceeds of the sale of the book were donated to the Educational and Scholarship Fund of Union Church or to any other church- related function designated by the official board. In 1978, the new Lionel Groulx station was completed, and its underground structure allowed Union United Church to remain at its location, on 3007 Delisle Street. Today, the church is pastored by the Rev. Dr. Robert Thompson. The church's membership has increased over the years because of recent immigration from the United States as well as Francophone African and Caribbean countries. Although the congregation has always been predominantly African-Canadian, it has members from 50 different nations. Over the years, Union United Church has also welcomed high-profile visitors into its sanctuary. Among those are Stokely Carmichael, Rosemary Brown, Sydney Poitier, Dr. Carrie Best, Bishop Desmond Tutu, Bernadette Allen, Thabo Mbeki and Nelson Mandela Negro Community Centre Under the leadership of Rev. Charles Este, Members of Union United Church established the Negro Community Centre (NCC) in February 1927 in the basement of Union Church. Founding members of the NCC included Golden Darby, Israel Sealey, Mack McClain, Hattie Olley, Mamie Morris, Edward Taylor, and Clara De Shield. The NCC not only served the congregation of Union Church, but was also open to members of Montreal's black community. One of its major objectives was social integration. In 1931, Dudley Sykes was hired as the Executive Director of the NCC and under his leadership the NCC programs had an average monthly attendance of 1,000 individuals.  Pastors  * Rev. F.E.

Signs and symptoms  The symptoms of facet joint arthropathy depend entirely on the location of the degenerated spinal joint, the severity of the damage and the amount of pressure that is being placed on the surrounding structures. It's important to note that the amount of pain a person experiences does not correlate well with the amount of degeneration that has occurred within the joint. Many people experience little or no pain while others, with exactly the same amount of pathology, experience chronic pain. Additionally, in symptomatic facet arthropathy the location of the degenerated joint plays a significant role in the symptoms that are experienced. People with degenerated joints in the upper spine will often feel pain radiating throughout the upper neck and shoulders (cervical facet syndrome.) That said, symptoms often manifest themselves in the lumbar spine, since they are highest here due to the overlying body weight, mobility and geometry. Affected persons usually feel dull pain in the lumbar spine that can radiate into the buttocks and legs. Typically, the pain is worsened by stress on the facet joints, e.g. by lumbar extension and loading (the basis of the Kemp Test) or lateral flexion but also by prolonged standing or walking. Pain associated with facet syndrome is often called \\"referred pain\\" because symptoms do not follow a specific nerve root pattern. This is why patients experiencing symptomatic facet syndrome can feel pain in their shoulders, legs and even manifested in the form of headaches.  Cause  Like many other joints throughout the human body, facets can experience natural degeneration from normal aging. Over time, the cartilage within the joints can naturally begin to wear out, allowing it to become thin or disappear entirely which, in turn, allows the conjoining vertebrae to rub directly against one another with little or no lubricant or separation. A result of this rubbing is often swelling, inflammation causing pain. Over time, the body will naturally respond to the instability within the spine by developing bone spurs, thickened ligaments or even synovial cysts that contact nerve roots exiting the spinal column. While primarily caused through natural wear and tear and degeneration, facet syndrome can also occur as a result of injury to the spine, or lifestyle choices. These causes can include: * Osteoarthritis * Spondylolisthesis * Obesity * Smoking * Malnutrition * Trauma such as a car accident, fall or sports injury. * Lack of physical exercise or daily activity (questionably) Pathophysiology 55% of facet syndrome cases occur in cervical vertebrae, and 31% in lumbar. Spinal osteoarthritis is known as spondylosis.ICD-10 www.icd10data.com. Pathology of the C1-C2 (atlantoaxial) joint, the most mobile of all vertebral segments, accounts for 4% of all spondylosis. Facet joints The facet joints are formed by the superior and inferior processes of each vertebra. The first cervical vertebra has an inferior articulating surface but, as it does not restrict lateral or posterior translation, is not always considered a proper zygomaVan de Graaff (2002). Human Anatomy. New York: McGraw Hill, p. 160. (zygoma is Greek for \\"yoke,\\" i.e. something that restrains movement). In the lumbar spine, facets provide about 20 percent of the twisting stability in the low back. Each facet joint is positioned at each level of the spine to provide the needed support especially with rotation. Facet joints also prevent each vertebra from slipping over the one below. A small capsule surrounds each facet joint providing a nourishing lubricant for the joint. Also, each joint has a rich supply of tiny nerve fibers that provide a painful stimulus when the joint is injured or irritated. Inflamed facets can cause a powerful muscle spasm. Diagnosis Facet arthropathy or 'facet syndrome' can typically be diagnosed through a physical examination, MRI, x-rays and/or a diagnostic block into the suspected joint. Facet syndrome has no specific code in ICD-10. It can be diagnosed as ‚Äúother‚Äù in M53.8 ‚Äì other specified dorsopathies.Where is the ICD-10 code for facet syndrome? www.chirocode.com. Treatment In general, anti-inflammatory drugs are prescribed initially. This medical treatment is usually accompanied by physiotherapy to increase back and stomach muscles. Thus, the spine can be both relieved and stabilized.Facet Syndrome www.joimax.com. If these conservative measures do not bring about betterment, minimally invasive procedures such as a facet infiltration can be conducted to offer relief. In this procedure, a local anesthetic is injected directly into the respective joint, usually in combination with a cortisone preparation (corticosteroid). For long- term relief in more severe cases, Radio Frequency Ablation or Rhyzotomy, where the anterior and posterior spinal nerve root is burnt may be performed. A. Gangi, J. L. Dietemann, R.

Some artificial nail designs attempt to mimic the appearance of real fingernails as closely as possible, while others may deliberately stray in favor of an artistic look. Unlike most manicures, artificial nails require regular upkeep; it is recommended that they are attended to, on average, every two weeks, however they may last up to about one month. Nonetheless, their versatility in terms of shape and design and comparatively high durability are some advantages they hold over other types of manicures.  Types  Artificial nails are an extension, not a replacement, of natural nails. There are two main approaches to creating artificial nails‚Äîtips and forms: * tips are lightweight \\"nail\\"-shaped plastic plates glued on the end of the natural nail; * forms are shaped sheets with a sticky edge that is effectively wrapped around the tip of the finger. Atop these, either acrylic, hard gel, or any combination of both may be applied. Tips are available in many different designs, ranging from solid colors like gel or regular nail polish to graphic designs such as animal prints and metallic colors. Artificial nails can be shaped, cut, and filed into a variety of shapes, including square, squared oval/\\"squoval\\", rounded, almond, ballerina/coffin, or stiletto.  Acrylic nails  Acrylic nails are made out of acrylic glass (PMMA). When it is mixed with a liquid monomer (usually ethyl methacrylate mixed with some inhibitor) it forms a malleable bead. This mixture begins to cure immediately, continuing until completely solid in minutes.  Gel nails  Gel nails can be used to create artificial nail extensions, but can also be used like nail polish. They are hardened using ultraviolet light. They last longer than regular nail polish and do not chip. They have a high-gloss finish and last for two to three weeks. Gel nails are strong, although not as strong as acrylic or fiberglass nails, and tend to be more expensive. Acetone does not dissolve gel nails, so they have to be removed at a salon by buffing. Repeated buffing can lead to thinning of the nail plate.  Nail wraps  Nail wraps are formed by cutting pieces of fiberglass, linen, silk fabric, or another material to fit on the surface of the nail (or a tip attached prior), to be sealed onto the nail plate with a layer of resin or glue. They provide strength to the nail but are not used to lengthen it.Simms (2003), p. 397. It can also be used to fix broken nails. The treatment is however more expensive.  Nail tips  Nail tips are attached to the natural nail to extend its length.Simms (2003), p. 398. They only last for 7‚Äì10 days.  History  Historically, artificial nails were common symbols of status all across the world: * During the Ming Dynasty of China, noblewomen wore very long artificial nails as a status symbol indicating that, unlike commoners, they did not have to do manual labor. * In early 19th century Greece, upper-class women often wore empty pistachio shells over their nails, slowly spreading the artificial nail trend across Europe. * Egyptian women wore nail extensions made from bone, ivory and gold as a sign of status as these materials were luxuries available only to the wealthy. \\"The earliest experiments and resultant artificial nails used a monomer and polymer mix applied to the nail and extended over a supporting form. This structure hardened and, when the support was removed, was then shaped to look like a natural extension of the nail plate. These dental materials were chemicals that came under the 'family' name of acrylics: thus the acrylic artificial nail was created. All materials subsequently used also belong to the acrylic family, but the term 'acrylic nails' has stuck to the method of using a liquid monomer and powder polymer.\\" In 1878, Mary E. Cobb opened the first manicure salon in Manhattan. This came after studying nail care in France and marrying podiatrist, J. Parker Pray. During the 1920s, short well-manicured round nails were a symbol of wealth. Revlon made their first appearance in 1932 with only one single product, long lasting formula nail enamel. In 1954, Fred Slack, a dentist, broke his fingernail at work, and created an artificial nail as a realistic-looking temporary replacement. After experiments with different materials to perfect his invention, he and his brother, Tom, patented a successful version and started the company Patti Nails. Fred Slack used his dental equipment and chemicals to replace his natural nail, but over time the process has significantly changed. In the late 20th century, artificial nails for women became widely popular all over the world. In today's time there are even nail styling competitions. Judges of these nail competitions look for consistency from nail to nail. They also judge whether or not the nails complement the model's hands. If the nails are beautiful, but too long for the model's hands, the judge will count off points. The competitors will be judged on how neat their work space is and how organized they are. Health effects=Perceived benefits Acrylic nails help conceal or fix broken, damaged, short, or otherwise considered \\"undesirable\\" nail appearance. They also help prevent nail biting, breakage, and splits. They are used when people are not able to grow the length and strength of natural nails that they desire. This problem can be solved by using certain nail techniques such as nail tipping, sculptured nails, nail wrapping, or acrylic overlays. With improper removal, acrylic nails often damage natural nails. An experienced nail technician should assist with this to ensure nail health. Health risks If fitted properly, artificial nails are usually not problematic. However, long term use and poorly fitted nails can seriously damage the nail bed and hamper natural nail growth. The most common problem associated with artificial nails is a fungal infection that may develop between the false and natural nail. When artificial nails are applied to the natural nail surface, minor types of trauma to the artificial nails which can happen from something as harmless as scraping a nail against a firm surface can cause separation of the nail from its nail bed. This allows bacteria and fungus to potentially enter the separated area setting up an infection. Many hospitals and healthcare facilities don't allow employees to have long fingernails, fake or real, due to the risk of said nails harboring microbes that could transmit diseases to patients. Infection can also be a risk when nails are applied by a disreputable nail salon that doesn't follow sanitary practices. From an occupational health standpoint, there could be hazards to nail salon workers who are exposed to the chemical fumes from artificial nails during their entire work shift. Ethyl methacrylate can be used for artificial nails and can cause contact dermatitis, asthma, and allergies in the eyes and nose. Nail salon workers also face exposure to other chemicals used, such as toluene, dibutyl phthalate, and formaldehyde. The products used to make acrylic nails may also be flammable. Exposure to methyl methacrylate (the precursor to acrylic glass) can cause drowsiness, light-headedness, and trembling of the hands, and so it has been banned for use in cosmetology in the majority of US states. Some signs that a nail salon is still using MMA might be prices that are significantly lower than most other nail salons. There will be an unusually strong and fruity odor. Also, the manicurist will often be wearing a mask to keep from breathing in the harmful chemical.

In December 2008, a man from Sydney was convicted of possessing child pornography after sexually explicit pictures of children characters from The Simpsons were found on his computer. The NSW Supreme Court upheld a Local Court decision that the animated Simpsons characters \\"depicted\\", and thus \\"could be considered\\", real people. Controversy arose over the perceived ban on small-breasted women in pornography after a South Australian court established that if a consenting adult in pornography were \\"reasonably\\" deemed to look under the age of consent, then they could be considered depictions of child pornography. Criteria described stated \\"small breasts\\" as one of few examples, leading to the outrage. Again, the classification law is not federal or nationwide and only applies to South Australia. Brazil Real child porn is illegal, considered to be any records of \\"any situation that involves a child or adolescent in explicit, real or simulated sexual activities, or the display of the genital organs of a child or adolescent for primarily sexual purposes ‚ÄùThe adjectives \\"real\\" and \\"simulated\\" (used in the plural by the rule in art. 241-E of the code of minors)See Articles 241-C and 241-E of the Code of Minors here, in Portuguese, and here, in English). refer to the explicit sexual activities represented, and not to the child or adolescent (if real or fictional product). In other words, what the law sanctions is the participation, real or simulated (through, for example, the use of photomontage technique), of a real child or adolescent in a scene with explicit sexual content. However, drawings and other non-realistic graphic representations of fictional children no matter how offensive including pornography of the subgenre of Japanese manga/hentai lolicon and shotacon are legal and not a criminal offense.http://pfdc.pgr.mpf.mp.br/temas-de- atuacao/direitos-sexuais-e-reprodutivos/nota-tecnica-liberdade-artistica-e- protecao-de-criancas-e-adolescentesTechnical Letter by Attorney of the Republic of the Federal Public Ministry Canada Canadian laws addressing child pornography are set out in Part V of the Canadian Criminal Code, dealing with Sexual Offences, Public Morals and Disorderly Conduct: Offences Tending to Corrupt Morals. Section 163.1 of the Code, enacted in 1993, defines child pornography to include \\"a visual representation, whether or not it was made by electronic or mechanical means\\", that \\"shows a person who is or is depicted as being under the age of eighteen years and is engaged in or is depicted as engaged in explicit sexual activity\\", or \\"the dominant characteristic of which is the depiction, for a sexual purpose, of a sexual organ or the anal region of a person under the age of eighteen years\\".Criminal Code, RSC 1985, c C-46, s 163.1, as enacted by SC1993, c 46, s 2. The definitive Supreme Court of Canada decision, R. v. Sharpe, interprets the statute to include purely fictional material even when no real children were involved in its production. 2010 tourist case In April 2010 visiting American citizen Ryan Matheson (aka Brandon X) was arrested in Ottawa for bringing erotica based on Lyrical Nanoha. By October 2011 he was charged with possession and importation of child pornography and faced a minimum of 1 year in prison. 2014 Nova Scotia case A man was sentenced to 90 days after pleading guilty of possessing mostly anime images. Roy Franklyn Newcombe, 70, pleaded guilty to the charge after a NSCAD student found a USB thumb drive with sexually explicit images and videos at a computer lab in April 2014. There was no indication the images involved local people or had been manufactured by Newcombe. Most of the 20 images were anime, although a few appeared to be of real girls between five and 13 years old. 2015 Alberta case February 19 the Canada Border Services Agency intercepted a parcel and arrested its recipient on March 27. Based on the box art of a sculpture being shipped to him, four charges were pressed: possession/distribution, mailing obscene matter and smuggling prohibited goods. These charges were withdrawn as part of a plea deal when the accused agreed to a peace bond. Finland Producing and distributing pornography which realistically or factually depicts a child‚Äîbasically photographic images‚Äîis illegal in Finland and punishable by a fine or up to two years' imprisonment. Possession of such pornography is punishable by a fine or imprisonment for up to one year. Realistic and factual visual depiction of a child appearing in sexual acts is defined as it having \\"been produced in a situation in which a child has actually been the object of sexually offensive conduct and realistic, if it resembles in a misleading manner a picture or a visual recording produced through photography or in another corresponding manner of a situation in which a child is the object of sexually offensive conduct\\". Purely fantasy-based virtual child pornography‚Äîin this case, drawings and paintings‚Äîremains legal by Finnish law because it has no connection to a real abuse situation; also, such depictions may serve informational or artistic purposes which can make even reality-based images legal.Hallituksen esitys Eduskunnalle lasten suojelemista seksuaalista riistoa ja seksuaalista hyv√§ksik√§ytt√∂√§ vastaan koskevan Euroopan neuvoston yleissopimuksen hyv√§ksymiseksi ja siihen liittyviksi laeiksi (HE 282/2010 vp), pp. 102‚Äì103.

France Since a reform of the French penal code, introduced in 2013, producing or distributing drawings that represent a minor aged less than 15 years old is considered the same as producing real child pornography and is punishable by up to five years' imprisonment and a ‚Ç¨75,000 fine, even if the drawings are not meant to be distributed. Germany In principle, the regulations in Chapter 13 of the German Criminal Law for offenses against sexual self-determination also prevent the public advocation and the degradation of minors as sexual objects. The distribution of child pornography, defined as pornography relating to \\"sexual acts performed by, on or in the presence of a person under 14 years of age (child), the reproduction of a child in a state of full or partial undress in an unnaturally sexual pose, or the sexually provocative reproduction of a child‚Äôs bare genitalia or bare buttocks,\\" is criminalized with a penalty of imprisonment. However, with regards to possession, only material depicting actual or realistic acts is criminalized. For reproductions of persons over 14 but under 18 years (youth pornography), the penalty for distribution is imprisonment or a fine. Nevertheless, due to the guaranteed freedom of art, fictional works are mostly officially deemed legal or can be checked by a legal opinion. Italy Virtual child pornography is punished with up to a third of the sanctions for real-life child pornography. Virtual images include images, or parts of images, produced and modified with software from actual photos of minors, where the quality makes it so that fake situations are manipulated to appear realistic. Japan In Japan, pornographic art depicting underage characters (lolicon, shotacon) is legal but remains controversial even within the country. They are commonly found in manga, erotic computer games, and doujinshi. Netherlands On October 1, 2002, the Netherlands introduced legislation (Bulletin of Acts and Decrees 470) which deemed \\"virtual child pornography\\" illegal.Justitie (1 October 2002). Retrieved January 20, 2006. The laws appear to only outlaw \\"Three-dimensional, realistic images representing a minor engaged in a sexually explicit conduct\\". In January 2011 the law was expanded and non-realistic 3D images are now counted as child pornography. In a 2010 case, after viewing the images in question, which were created on a computer, the court opined that the virtual child pornography images did not fall under criminal law. \\"All images can be termed as pornographic (three dimensional) cartoons, animations, or drawings. The court concludes that it is immediately obvious to the average viewer that the event is not real and that the images are manipulated images and not realistic.\\" As of September 1, 2018, the Dutch criminal law punishes \\"anyone who spreads, sells, openly exhibits, manufactures, imports, transports, exports, acquires, possesses, or accesses by means of an automated system or using a communication service an image (or data carrier containing an image) depicting sexual conduct, in which someone knowingly under the age of 18, is involved (or appears to be involved)\\" with a prison sentence of up to 4 years or a fine in the fifth category (up to ‚Ç¨82,000).(in Dutch) Wetboek van Strafrecht, Artikel 240b(in Dutch) Maximum Dutch fines per fine category  Belgium  In Belgium, only pornographic art that realistically depicts underage characters is illegal. New Zealand In New Zealand, the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993 classifies a publication as \\"objectionable\\" if it \\"promotes or supports, or tends to promote or support, the exploitation of children, or young persons, or both, for sexual purposes\\". Making, distribution, import, or copying or possession of objectionable material for the purposes of distribution are offences punishable (in the case of an individual) by a fine of up to NZ$10,000 on strict liability, and ten years in prison if the offence is committed knowingly.Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993. Retrieved December 15, 2010. In December 2004, the Office of Film and Literature Classification determined that Puni Puni Poemy‚Äîwhich depicts nude children in sexual situations, though not usually thought of as pornographic by fans‚Äîwas objectionable under the Act and therefore illegal to publish in New Zealand. A subsequent appeal failed, and the series remains banned.Puni Puni Poemy: Banned in New Zealand. Retrieved August 23, 2007. In April 2013, Ronald Clark was jailed for possession of anime that depicts sex between elves, pixies, and other fantasy creatures. It was ruled as obscene and he was jailed for three months following the trial. Clark was previously convicted for indecently assaulting a teenage boy and his lawyer noted that ethical issues complicated the case. Norway As of 2005, the Norwegian penal act criminalizes any depictions that \\"sexualize\\" children, even if it does not actually show sexual acts with children. Lovdata - Straffeloven, 19. kapittel, Seksualforbrytelser, ¬ß 204a This could include any artificially produced material, including written text, drawn images, animation, manipulated images, an adult model with childish clothes, toys, or surroundings.

Poland Since the 2008 amendment to the Polish Penal Code (Article 202 ¬ß 4b), the production, dissemination, presenting, storing, and possession of pornographic content depicting \\"made or remade\\" images of minors taking part in any sexual activity is punishable by monetary fine, restriction of personal liberty, or imprisonment up to two years. A \\"minor\\", according to Polish law, is a person under 18 years old.Art. 10 ustawy z dnia 23 kwietnia 1964 r. ‚Äì Kodeks cywilny () If the age of a depicted person is in question, a court may appoint anthropological experts to determine it. This law faced criticism from legal experts. Maciej Wrze≈õniewski questioned the legitimacy of this article, arguing that \\"it is not possible to unquestionably confirm the age of a depicted person‚Äîsince such a person does not in fact exist\\". This opinion was shared by Maciej Szmit, who called the whole article \\"unfortunately worded\\". From 2008 to 2016, there were 12 people found guilty under Article 202 ¬ß 4b (as a primary crime). It is unknown in how many cases, if any, the judgment concerned drawn pornography, as this law is also used for \\"remade\\" images, such as when photographs of children's faces are pasted onto sexually explicit images of adults' bodies. One of the cases where the discussed Article 202 ¬ß 4b of Polish Penal Code was used in court was the case of a painter Krzysztof Kuszej, whose art \\"with photographic accuracy depicted children and men's genitalia during intercourse\\". His pictures implied that the men were priests. The artist argued in court, that his art is a social commentary on subject of Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, and his artistic measures were adequate for the problem. The court's ruling was \\"not guilty\\". The ruling was based on the experts' opinion, that the presenting of pedophilia was not an intent of the artist, and that his works were of critical nature. The court warned, however, that \\"an artist must be aware that artistic freedom is not an absolute principle\\". Russia Paragraph 1 of Article 242.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation makes it illegal to create, acquire, store, and/or move across the Russian border (including through the internet) pornographic pictures of minors.https://www.wipo.int/edocs/lexdocs/laws/en/ru/ru080en.pdf This includes drawings/depictions of minors. Real imprisonments exist.https://takiedela.ru/news/2019/12/01/mishel/ South Africa With the promulgation of the Films and Publications Amendment Bill in September 2003, a broad range of simulated child pornography became illegal in South Africa. For the purposes of the act, any image or description of a person \\"real or simulated\\" who is depicted or described as being under the age of 18 years and engaged in sexual conduct, broadly defined, constitutes \\"child pornography\\". Under the act, anyone is guilty of an offence punishable by up to ten years' imprisonment if he or she possesses, creates, produces, imports, exports, broadcasts, or in any way takes steps to procure or access child pornography. Spain Spain allows drawn pornography which does not resemble real children, including cartoons, manga or similar representations, as the law does not consider them to be properly 'realistic images'. The Attorney General's Office considers that only extremely realistic images should be pursued. \\"In order to avoid undue extensions of the concept of child pornography, the concept of 'realistic images' must be interpreted restrictively. According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy 'realist' means that which 'tries to adjust to reality'. Therefore, 'realistic images' will be images close to the reality which they try to imitate. However, too realistic image, even painting, is strictly prohibited due to the law of European Union, this can be understood as images can not be distinguished from children in reality by normal people. Therefore having realistic simulation materials that showing child porn, such as simulation pictures or videos, will be encountered penalty. Switzerland \\"Pornographic documents, sound or visual recordings, depictions or other items of a similar nature or pornographic performances\\" showing \\"non-genuine sexual acts with minors\\" are illegal according to art. 197 of the Swiss Criminal Code and liable to a custodial sentence not exceeding three years or to a monetary penalty. Purely fictional virtual child pornography‚Äîin this case, drawings and paintings‚Äîremains legal by Swiss law. Sweden Any images or videos that depict children in a pornographic context are to be considered child pornography in Sweden, even if they are drawings. A \\"child\\" is defined as a ‚Äúperson‚Äù who is either under the age of 18 or who has not passed puberty. These laws have been recorded in the media being put into play in Uppsala: the district court punished a man with a monetary fine and probation for possession of manga-style images.Sweden's \\"The Local\\": Translator fined July 25, 2010Sankaku Complex: \\"Manga Translator Convicted\\" July 26, 2010 This was appealed and taken to the Court of Appeal. In court, Judge Fredrik Wers√§ll stated that a \\"person\\" (as in the definition of a \\"child\\") is a human being. The man possessing the illustrations, as well as his lawyer, stated that a comic character is not a person (a comic character is a comic character and nothing else) and that a person does not have cat ears, giant eyes, or a tail and that a person has a nose. Some of the pictures featured illustrations of characters with these unusual body parts. The prosecutor and an expert on child pornography argued that these body parts had no effect and that the comic characters indeed were persons. As examples of what is not a person, the child pornography expert mentioned The Simpsons and Donald Duck.As stated in court (Svea hovr√§tt 2011-01-14 13:00 to 14:45). The Court of Appeal upheld the former verdict, for 39 of the 51 pictures, and the monetary fine was reduced. It was immediately further appealed to the Supreme Court. While the Prosecutor General agreed with the verdict of the Court of Appeal, he still recommended that the Supreme Court hear the case, to clarify the issue, and the Supreme Court decided to do so. On June 15, 2012, the Supreme Court found him not guilty. They decided that the images were not realistic and could not be mistaken for real children, and that they therefore could not be counted as exceptions to the constitutional law of freedom of speech. One picture was still considered realistic enough to be defined as child pornography according to Swedish law. However, his possession of it was considered defensible through his occupation as a professional expert of Japanese culture, particularly manga. United Kingdom The Coroners and Justice Act of April 2009 (c. 2) created a new offence in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland of possession of a prohibited image of a child. This act makes cartoon pornography depicting minors illegal in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Since Scotland has its own legal system, the Coroners and Justice Act does not apply. This act did not replace the 1978 act, extended in 1994, since that covered \\"pseudo-photographs\\"‚Äîimages that appear to be photographs. In 2008 it was further extended to cover tracings and other works derived from photographs or pseudo-photographs. A prohibited cartoon image is one which involves a minor in situations which are pornographic and \\"grossly offensive, disgusting or otherwise of an obscene character\\". Prior to this, although not explicitly in the statutes, the law was interpreted to apply to cartoon images, though only where the images are realistic and indistinguishable from photographs. The new law, however, covered images whether or not they are realistic.  History  In 2006 the government was giving close consideration to the issues and options regarding cartoon pornography, according to Vernon Coaker. On December 13, 2006 UK Home Secretary John Reid announced that the Cabinet was discussing how to ban computer-generated images of child abuse‚Äîincluding cartoons and graphic illustrations of abuse‚Äîafter pressure from children's charities. The government published a consultation on April 1, 2007, announcing plans to create a new offence of possessing a computer-generated picture, cartoon or drawing with a penalty of three years in prison and an unlimited fine. The children's charity NCH stated that \\"this is a welcome announcement which makes a clear statement that drawings or computer-generated images of child abuse are as unacceptable as a photograph\\". Others stated that the intended law would limit artistic expression, patrol peoples' imaginations, and that it is safer for pedophiles' fantasies \\"to be enacted in their computers or imaginations [rather] than in reality\\". The current law was foreshadowed in May 2008, when the Government announced plans to criminalise all non-realistic sexual images depicting under-18s. These plans became part of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, sections 62‚Äì68,Coroners and Justice Act 2009 - 2009 c. 25 - Part 2 - Chapter 2 - Prohibited images and came into force on April 6, 2010. The definition of a \\"child\\" in the Act included depictions of 16- and 17-year-olds who are over the age of consent in the UK, as well as any adults where the \\"predominant impression conveyed\\" is of a person under the age of 18. The Act made it illegal to own any picture depicting under-18s participating in sexual activities, or depictions of sexual activity in the presence of someone under 18 years old. The law was condemned by a coalition of graphic artists, publishers, and MPs, who feared it would criminalise graphic novels such as Lost Girls and Watchmen. The government claimed that publication or supply of such material could be illegal under the Obscene Publications Act, if a jury would consider it to have a tendency to \\"deprave and corrupt\\". However, the published bill made no reference to the \\"deprave and corrupt\\" test. In October 2014, Robul Hoque was convicted of possessing up to 400 explicit manga images involving fictional children, in the UK's first prosecution of its kind. He received a 9-month suspended sentence. He was also warned in court that had he been in possession of actual child pornography, he would have been sentenced to jail for a longer term in years. United States=1973‚Äì2002 In the United States, pornography is generally protected as a form of personal expression, and thus governed by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Where pornography ceases to be protected expression is when it fails the Miller obscenity test, as the Supreme Court of the United States held in 1973 in Miller v. California. Another case, New York v. Ferber (1982), held that if pornography depicts real child abuse or a real child victim, as a result of photographing a live performance for instance, then it is not protected speech. In 1996, U.S. Congress introduced the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA) to update the types of pornographic media featuring minors considered illegal under U.S. federal law. In 2002, the United States Supreme Court ruled in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition that two provisions of the CPPA were facially invalid due to being overbroad and covering certain aspects of protected speech, such as the non-pornographic 1999 film American Beauty. The case also reaffirmed both the Miller and Ferber decisions. 2003 ‚Äì PROTECT Act In response to Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, Congress passed the PROTECT Act of 2003 (also dubbed the Amber Alert Law) which was signed into law on April 30, 2003, by President George W. Bush. The PROTECT Act adjusted its language to meet the parameters of the Miller, Ferber, and Ashcroft decisions. The Act was careful to separate cases of virtual pornography depicting minors into two different categories of law: Child pornography law and obscenity law. In regards to child pornography law, the Act modified the previous wording of \\"appears to be a minor\\" with \\"indistinguishable from that of a minor\\" phrasing. This definition does not apply to depictions that are drawings, cartoons, sculptures, or paintings depicting minors or adults.\\"http://lawpublications.barry.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1012&context;=barrylrev Furthermore, there exists an affirmative defense to a child pornography charge that applies if the depiction was of a real person and the real person was an adult (18 or over) at the time the visual depiction was created, or if the visual depiction did not involve any actual minors (see subsection \\"c\\", parts 1 and 2, of 18 U.S.C. 2252A). This affirmative defense does not apply to child pornography created via morphing, namely depictions \\"created, adapted, or modified to appear that an identifiable minor is engaging in sexually explicit conduct (see section (8)(c) of 18 U.S.C. 2256). The PROTECT Act also enacted into U.S. obscenity law: > \\"Section 1466A of Title 18, United State Code, makes it illegal for any > person to knowingly produce, distribute, receive, or possess with intent to > transfer or distribute visual representations, such as drawings, cartoons, > or paintings that appear to depict minors engaged in sexually explicit > conduct and are deemed obscene.\\" Thus, virtual and drawn pornographic depictions of minors may still be found illegal under U.S. federal obscenity law. The obscenity law further states in section C \\"It is not a required element of any offense under this section that the minor depicted actually exist.\\" Laws governing non-child pornography are guided by the Miller Standard, a three-prong test used by courts to dictate obscenity according to the \\"average person's\\" point of view of the standards of the community as well as state law. The parts follow: \\"appeals to prurient interests\\", \\"depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct\\" as described by law, and \\"taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.\\" Materials that fall within all three prongs may be declared obscene in a court of law. By the statute's own terms, the law does not make all fictional child pornography illegal, only that found to be obscene or lacking in serious value. The mere possession of said images is not a violation of the law unless it can be proven that they were transmitted through a common carrier, such as the mail or the internet, transported across state lines, or of an amount that showed intent to distribute. There is also an affirmative defense made for possession of no more than two images with \\"reasonable steps to destroy\\" the images or reporting and turning over the images to law enforcement. The first major case occurred in December 2005, when Dwight Whorley was convicted in Richmond, Virginia under 18 U.S.C. 1466A for using a Virginia Employment Commission computer to receive and distribute \\"obscene Japanese anime cartoons that graphically depicted prepubescent female children being forced to engage in genital-genital and oral-genital intercourse with adult males\\". On December 18, 2008, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, consisting of 20 years' imprisonment. Whorley appealed to the Supreme Court, but was denied cert. 2008‚Äìpresent Response to \\"18 U.S.C. ¬ß 1466A\\" has been met with legal challenges regarding its vague wording. In particular the law testing the criminalization of a \\"visual depiction of any kind\\" has since been tried in courts. In October 2008, a 38-year-old Iowa comic collector named Christopher Handley was prosecuted for possession of explicit lolicon manga. The judge ruled that two parts of the act that were broader than the Miller standard, 1466A a(2) and b(2), unconstitutionally overbroad, but Handley still faced an obscenity charge.Iowa Collector Charged for Allegedly Obscene Manga from AnimeNewsNetwork on October 10, 2008 Handley was convicted in May 2009 as the result of entering a guilty plea bargain at the recommendation of his attorney, under the belief that the jury chosen to judge him would not acquit him of the obscenity charges if they were shown the images in question.\\"Manga Collection Ruled 'Child Pornography' By US Court\\". io9.com, May 28, 2009 A later ruling in United States v. Dean challenged the overbreadth ruling because the Handley case failed to prove that 1466A a(2) and b(2) were substantially overbroad; Dean was convicted under the sections previously deemed unconstitutional. At the state level, some states have laws that explicitly prohibit cartoon pornography and similar depictions, while others have only vague laws on such content. In California such depictions specifically do not fall under state child pornography laws, while in Utah they are explicitly banned. On a federal level, works depicting minors that offend contemporary community standards and are \\"patently offensive\\" while lacking \\"serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value\\" continue to stand as illegal. Legal professor Reza Banakar has since stated that \\"serious artistic value\\" is very difficult to evaluate, and that the legal task of evaluating the lack of such value cannot be executed objectively. The mainstream media has not picked up any cases since 2012, when a man from Missouri entered a plea bargain to \\"possession of cartoons depicting child pornography\\". Due to the fact that obscenity is determined by a sitting judge or jury in reference to local standards and definitions on a state-by-state, case-by-case basis, the legality of drawn or fictitious pornography depicting minors is left in a 'gray area', much like other forms of alternative pornography. Some states pay less mind to the contents of such materials and determine obscenity based on time and place an offense may occur, while others may have strict, well-defined standards for what a community may be allowed to find appropriate. Others only may have vague laws or definitions which are only used to allow the government to prosecute recidivist offenders on both a federal and state level. ;The following are cases which have been brought up since the ruling in 2008 =2010 Idaho case= In October 2010, 33-year-old Idaho man Steven Kutzner entered into a plea agreement concerning images of child characters from the American animated television show The Simpsons engaged in sexual acts.Former teacher pleads guilty to downloading 'Simpsons' porn Oct 14, 2010Steven Kutzner Plea Agreement October 4, 2010 The case was originally brought up due to the fact that the German Federal Police identified and reported to U.S. authorities Kutzner's IP address as one where a known file containing actual child pornography was being shared. During the forensic investigation, which uncovered \\"six hundred and thirty two (632) image files, seventy (70) of which were animated images graphically depicting minors engaging in sex acts\\", \\"five hundred and twenty-four (524) pornographic image files, most of which depict what appears to be teenaged females\\", and \\"more than eight thousand files containing images child erotica involving younger children, many of them prepubescent\\", Kutzner admitted that he had knowingly received photographic child pornography \\"for at least eight years\\". =2011 Maine case= In November 2011, Joseph Audette, a 30-year-old computer network administrator from Surry, Maine, was arrested after his username was linked to child pornography sites.

Located at Jalan Taming Sari (Main Road) near the commercial town centre, it is one of the biggest hospitals in Malaysia and is the second biggest in the State of Perak. The hospital is strategically situated in 80 km from Ipoh and 85 km from Penang which able to serve the northern states of Malaysia.  History  Yong Wah Hospital or the Chinese Pauper Hospital was the first established hospital in Federated Malay States. Established in 1880 to treat the Chinese coolies and tin-miners who often sick and suffered from various diseases, such as diarrhoea, cholera, malaria, beriberi, dysentery, and pulmonary diseases. Its establishment was developed parallel with the significant economy growth in the town. The hospital gained financial supports from the Chinese merchants while the State Government aided medical apparatuses, medicines and nursing staff. With consideration to the poor people's welfare, the hospital only charged a minimum fee of 50 cents per annum from the poor coolies. The hospital's policies worked out efficiently for the first six months since of its establishment, but it was later occurred difficulties on collecting the fees. The reason was most coolies unable to settle their medical fees due to the low income. Therefore, by the end of the year 1880, the State Government took over full responsibility on the Yong Wah Hospital, and shifted to its current location at the Main Road, and renamed with Taiping General Hospital. The maintenance cost of the hospital were so high, that Sir Hugh Low, the then British Resident of Perak levied a capitation fee of one dollar, where everyone lives in Taiping including within the district will be charged annually, and a health coupon will be produced for those who pay for the fees. The fees were used as contribution to the expenses for maintaining the hospital, with no profit gained from the collections. All food, medicine and attendance were given free-of-charge, but the Chinese community strongly objected to this tax, because it was never levied in other Malay states, and the system was later abolished in 1884. The institution consists of many wards and other buildings arranged in carefully laid out grounds, planted with palms, beautiful trees and flowering shrubs, which is very restful to the eye. The aim of the hospital was to curb diseases from spreading among the coolies, reduce the rate of death, and increase the rate of growth; the purpose of the establishment had finally turned a positive result. The number of death and diseases decline gradually in the district, and surprisingly, the rate of birth had increased tremendously, and Taiping continued to prosper in economy growth. The institution was under Dr. Hamilton Wright the first Health Inspector, where the hospital able to sustain 900 patients at one time, according to Sir Cecil Clementi's report during his state visits. In 1881, the hospital went a major renovation and suspension. The overall renovation cost was estimated about 2,100 straits dollars. By the year 1884, an additional ward and a dispensary were added; the hospital's drainage system also improved with the total cost of 9,379 straits dollars. Also at the same year, total 3,068 cases handled by the hospital (total about 13000 cases in Perak), where 2,501 cases involved with beriberi. The main cause of the beriberi was due to the malnutrition and improper sanitation taken by the coolies. Taiping also housed a lunatic asylum hospital (within the hospital compound) and a prison hospital (in the prison) under the supervision of Mr Thomas Prendergast. In 1906, the Government medical staff extended the services for outpatients particularly the rural areas. The percentage of deaths to cases treated was 18.08% in Taiping, compare to other 13 hospitals in Perak. The numbers of patients treated in the course of a year run to many thousands, and the sums expended by the Government on the Medical Department, with all its surgeons and assistants, nurses, dispensers, dressers, attendants, cooks, gardeners, gate-keepers, etc., amount to a very large total. It was reported that many of the government's expenses flowed to the hospital. Therefore, by the year 1890, a Sanitary Board was established to control and monitor the health and cleanliness of the town. On 3 February 1896, the hospital was installed with X-Ray equipment, and marked as the first hospital in Malaya and also Far East Asia to have those facilities. Mr. Leonard Wray chaired the opening ceremony, and the first patient who used the X-Ray was a pomfret. In 1906, the Medical Department reported that 318, 000 straits dollars were funded in Perak for development in every sector. By the year later, the population in Taiping as well as where else in Perak had increased gradually as a result of good health care been taken seriously by the government. Taiping being the pioneer for a health institution was later adopted by other towns in Malaya, and later almost every town in Malaya has a hospital.

In 1940 the guard commander shot the chief engineer in the back, an act that was ruled an accident (the engineer, Konserov, had previously received an Order of Lenin for his work on the White Sea‚ÄìBaltic Canal). Work stopped in 1942 and resumed in 1947. The tunnel was officially opened in 1950, but was never used because the rest of the BAM was incomplete. Work on the BAM stopped after Stalin's death in 1953. Water leaked into the abandoned tunnel and it eventually became filled with ice. Work was resumed in 1974 using railway troops, a group comparable to the US Army Corps of Engineers. They moved into the former gulag barracks, but the barbed wire and watch towers left no doubt as to where they were. When work started more reminders were found, including frozen corpses and a candlestick holder made from a skull. Letters home caused a scandal and a commission was sent out from Moscow. The commission concluded that the political education of the soldiers was poor and that it was inappropriate to house them in former prisoners' barracks. In just ten days, the entire camp was leveled, including the cemetery, and all signs of the previous workers were destroyed. The troops used the backblast from jet engines to melt the 32,000 cubic meters of ice.

Course  The river starts at the outlet of Bear Lake. The river drops over a small waterfall before entering Deer Lake. After exiting Deer Lake, the river drops over another waterfall, this one much larger than the first, before entering the largest and best of the three lakes on the Taylor River, Snoqualmie Lake. After exiting Snoqualmie Lake, the river drops over another good sized waterfall as it drops over the headwall below the lake. Near the bottom, the river receives the creek that drains Nordrum, Judy and Carole Lakes. The river then turns from west to northwest before soon turning west again. The river receives three large tributaries, Big Creek, Otter Creek and Marten Creek, all of which drop over large waterfalls before entering the river. After receiving Marten Creek, the river turns south towards its confluence with the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River. Shortly before entering the river, it receives one more major tributary, Quartz Creek.  Hiking  There are several hiking trails in the area. The main and most popular one is the Taylor River Trail, which is an old road that ends near the base of the headwall below Snoqualmie Lake. It begins before a bridge over the river just upstream from the mouth of Quartz Creek. The trail follows the river relatively closely, crossing Marten and Big Creeks on bridges that have views of both creeks‚Äô respective waterfalls (Otter Creek is also crossed, but there is no bridge and no falls are visible from the crossing). The trail ends 1.2 miles after the Big Creek Bridge. The unmarked and rather rough trail to Marten Creek is found branching off the Taylor River Trail shortly before the Marten Creek Bridge. There is a short side trail that branches off the Taylor River Trail shortly after the crossing of Otter Creek that leads to Lipsy Lake and the beautiful slides of Otter Falls that drop directly into the tiny lake. The Dream Lake Trail branches off the Taylor River Trail shortly after the Big Creek Bridge. The trail follows the creek steeply up to the lake and is all but non-existent in some areas. At the end of the Taylor River Trail is the start of the difficult Nordrum Lake Trail, a rough route that leads to remote Nordrum Lake and also provides access to Carole and Judy Lakes, to nearby back-country lakes.

The garden is located near Bukit Larut, and is equidistant to the town centre and the Taiping Zoo. History alt=Black-and- white photo of town planner Charles Reade The Taiping Lake Gardens was originally a mining ground before it was established as a public garden in 1880. The idea of a public garden was the brainchild of Colonel Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker. The garden was developed by Charles Compton Reade (1880‚Äì1933), who was also responsible for planning the Kuala Lumpur garden town, together with Lady Swettenham. The abandoned tin mine ground was donated by Chung Keng Quee as a recreation park for public use. In 1884 the gardens were planted with grasses, flowers, and trees; a part of the gardens was fenced, to keep bulls out.A Design Guide of Public Parks in Malaysia by Jamil Abu Bakar, Published by Penerbit UTM, 2002; ; pp. 87-92 The site was the first public garden in Malaya, and was cherished for its beauty; it has been well- maintained since its opening. There are ten scenic lakes and ponds, which highlight the gardens. Along Residency Road, near the gardens, were golden rain trees () or hujan-hujan (pterocarpus indicus) planted along the pathway. In George L. Peet‚Äôs A Journal in the Federal Capital, when he visited Taiping in 1933 he said ‚ÄúI know of no more lovely sight in this country than the Taiping gardens when the rays of the early morning sun are shining obliquely through their clumps of bamboo, palms and isolated trees scattered on islands among the expanse of water. One receives in that glorious half hour an experience of light in foliage that is quite unobtainable in England‚Äù. There are few private and government houses located near the gardens; among them are the Old Residency (home of the Secretary to the Resident), the Raja‚Äôs House at the junction of Birch Road and Residency Road and the army officers' residences on Batu Tugoh Road. The gardens were so striking that they attracted many travelers to write of their beauty: Lakes and ponds A Chinese entry of a decorated boat in the Taiping Lake Carnival which was the best illuminated and which tied for First Prize, 1937. *Alamanda Pond *Island Pond *Jungle Lake *Oblong Pond *Pavilion Pond *South Lake *Swan Lake *West Lake Accessibility=Air Penang International Airport is about a 90-minute drive from Taiping. Kuala Lumpur International Airport is about a three-hour drive south via the North-South Expressway. Ipoh Airport is about 60-minute drive from Taiping. Road Taiping is easily accessible from the PLUS North-South Expressway. From Penang (90 km away) Kamunting is the nearest exit, whilst Changkat Jering is the most convenient exit from the motorway if you are traveling north from Ipoh (70 km). Taiping is well-connected to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia by express buses, which arrive at and depart from the long-distance bus station at Kamunting (6 km from the town centre) and Simpang (7 km from the town centre). Buses also travel direct from Taiping to Singapore and Hat Yai. Southbound buses depart from Kamunting and call along Simpang (Medan Simpang) to pick up passengers from Simpang before heading to the highway via the Changkat Jering interchange. Bus tickets are available from counters located at Medan Kamunting and Medan Simpang. Rail Keretapi Tanah Melayu (formerly known as the Malayan Railway) operates a number of daily services along the main north-south line which stops at Taiping station. One service, the Ekspres Langkawi, connects Taiping with Hat Yai. Attractions *Lakes and ponds - There are about 10 man-made lakes and ponds distributed throughout the gardens. *Maxwell Hill (Bukit Larut) - A hill station with an altitude of about 1000m; ideal for jungle-trekking and camping.

Southern Ry. Co., Volume 37, Interstate Commerce Commission Valuation Reports, November 6, 1931, p. 456. Washington: United States Government Printing Office, 1932. A group of Fayetteville citizens obtained a charter from the North Carolina legislature in December 1852 to construct a railroad from Fayetteville to the coal fields of Chatham County (now Chatham, Moore, and Lee counties). The state helped finance, build, and operate the new railroad. Problems with the construction contracts and obtaining rights of way delayed its construction, the first rails being laid in 1858. It was not completed until the first part of the American Civil War. Its first operations in commenced in 1861 to McIver's Depot, and the line was completed to Egypt in 1863. Charles Beatty Mallett (1816-1872) served as the railroad's second president from 1855 to 1865, and fourth president from 1867 to 1868. He was the son of Charles Peter Mallett (1792-c1874). Mallett was a cotton manufacturer, acquiring a controlling interest in the Union Manufacturing Company during the time he served as the railroad's president. In 1862 Mallett, in partnership with James Browne of Charleston, South Carolina, took over management and operation of the Egypt Coal Mines. These mines had been owned by a Philadelphia-based company, and had been placed into receivership by the Confederate government at the start of the war. The facilities of the railroad were used to transport the coal to Fayetteville, where it was then moved down the Cape Fear River to its contracted final destination of Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1865 Gen. Sherman's army reached Fayetteville. During his campaign Sherman burned or destroyed several of the bridges used by the railroad, 12 miles of track, and several depots. Its rolling stock was saved, having been moved to the Egypt end of the line. By 1868, his other businesses and personal residence also destroyed by Sherman's campaign, Mallett was forced into bankruptcy. The line resumed operations in 1868. In the following two years, additional connections were made to the railroad, and it continued operations for another 11 years. In 1879 the railroad was renamed Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railway and absorbed the Mount Airy Railroad.

At the time, the city saw significant growth in European as well as Chinese, Indian, Arab, and Indonesian communities, and thus the need for such clubs arose. The following is a non- exhaustive list of these establishments. Perak Club (Old Club) The Perak Club was the premier social institution of Taiping and was the senior club in the Malay States. Colonel Robert Sandilands Frowd Walker was in large measure responsible for its formation and development in 1881. Among the early patrons were Sir Hugh Low, formerly British Resident of Perak, Mr. William Edward Maxwell, Assistant Resident, and Major Paul Swinburne. The capacious clubhouse was erected by the government, and is still kept in repair by the Public Works Department. In front of the building is a playing field which is used for cricket, football, hockey, and tennis. The athletics section of the club is known as the Cricket and Recreation Club, and was the leading sporting club of the Federated Malay States. It organized the first inter-state matches in Malaya. Many European residents of Larut, Matang, Krian, and Upper Perak were members of the club, and as was usual with most Federated Malay States clubs, ladies were admitted to its privileges gratis. The New Club The leading social institution in the capital of Perak was the New Club, formed in 1892. Its chief promoters were the late Dr. Shepherd and Messrs. Lefroy, Mais, Gray, and Aylesbury. During the first year of its existence, the clubhouse was sold to the Sultan of Perak, and the present structure, built on a site granted by the Perak Government and H.M. Sultan Sir Idris Shah from plans prepared by Mr. Lefroy in 1893, was opened in the following year. The building scheme was financed by the issue of debentures to the value of 10,000 dollars, nearly the whole of which has now been paid off. The clubhouse overlooks the cricket and football grounds, and affords a magnificent view of the Taiping Hills. It contains reading, billiard, and card rooms, a large dining room, and five residential chambers. To the rear of the club building there is a croquet ground. The Taiping Golf Club has its headquarters onsite. List of New Club's Presidents 1894 - 1898 H.A.W. Aylesbury 1898 - 1900 A.R. Venning 1901 - 1902 F.St. G. Caulfeild 1903 - 1907 Colonel R.S.F.

Lovett Perak Turf Club The Perak Turf Club was established in 1884; it was the first exclusive turf club ever built in Perak. Its was the idea of Sir Frank Swettenham, who was passionate about horse racing. The new race course was located at Waterfall Road, later changed to Race Course Road, near the Lake Gardens. It held ordinary racing in the Federated Malay States ‚Äî the major tournaments were held at Penang, Selangor, or Singapore. In 1906, it had a membership of about 250. The present course is at Waterfall Road, Taiping, which is 7 furlongs in length. There was an old course, situated about three miles away from Taiping, on which races were run. In 1886, Burma ponies provided most of the racing and the meetings were primarily social functions. The turf club was the only club that attracted people of all classes, especially the Chinese, to mingle around, because of the sweepstakes and lotteries, as gambling was a favourite pastime. Sir E.W. Birch, a racing enthusiast, would travel to distant turf clubs just to join the major tournament, and was crucial to developing racing interest in the area. In 1934, when the importance of Taiping had declined below that of Ipoh, the club was shifted to Ipoh, still bearing the same name. Taiping Swimming Club The club was formed in 1914 and shared a building with the New Club. At the beginning, the club‚Äôs activities were carried out at the waterfall site near the foothill of Maxwell Hill. However in 1929, a swimming pool was built near the Maxwell Hill to accommodate the growth in membership. Perak Golf Club The Perak Golf Club was established in 1894 and housed at the New Club buildings. It claimed to be the first of its kind formed in the Federated Malay States. This nine-hole golf course was reserved exclusively for New Club members. The golf field was originally located near the Taiping Goal.

Though this may well be warranted in some way, the evolutionary relationships the Oedemerinae are generally in need of review, particularly considering the number of genera treated as basal or of entirely uncertain placement. Hence, a more conservative approach is adopted here until genus limits can be better defined in the entire subfamily.

Strong Voices Publishing, 2016.Iberall, A. and Soodak, H.: A physics for complex systems. In F. Yates, (ed.), Self-Organizing Systems, pp. 499-520. Plenum Press, NY 1987, p 499-520 Standard physics studies systems at separate levels, such as atomic physics, nuclear physics, biophysics, social physics, and galactic physics. Homeokinetic physics studies the up-down processes that bind these levels. Tools such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics provide the key relationships. The subject, described as the physics and thermodynamics associated with the up down movement between levels of systems, originated in the late 1970s work of American physicists Harry Soodak and Arthur Iberall. Complex systems are universes, galaxies, social systems, people, or even those that seem as simple as gases. The basic premise is that the entire universe consists of atomistic- like units bound in interactive ensembles to form systems, level by level, in a nested hierarchy. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems. History Arthur Iberall, Warren McCulloch and Harry Soodak developed the concept of homeokinetics as a new branch of physics. It began through Iberall's biophysical research for the NASA exobiology program into the dynamics of mammalian physiological processesIberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Analysis of the dynamic systems response of some internal human systems. Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information; Reports to NASA: CR-129, Oct. 1964; CR-141, Jan. l965; CR-219, May 1965; Interim Report, Dec. 1965.Iberall, A.S., M. Ehrenberg and S.Z. Cardon. General-dynamics of the physical-chemical systems in mammals. Contractors Report to NASA, NASW-1066, Aug. 1966. They were observing an area that physics has neglected, that of complex systems with their very long internal factory day delays. They were observing systems associated with nested hierarchy and with an extensive range of time scale processes.Iberall, A.S. and S.Z. Cardon. Hierarchical regulation in the complex biological organism. Record of the IEEE Systems Science and Cybernetics Conference, Phila., October, 1969.Iberall, A.S. and W.S. McCulloch. The organizing principle of complex living systems. J. Basic Engr., ASME 290-294, 1969. It was such connections, referred to as both up-down or in-out connections (as nested hierarchy) and side-side or flatland physics among atomistic-like components (as heterarchy) that became the hallmark of homeokinetic problems. By 1975, they began to put a formal catch-phrase name on those complex problems, associating them with nature, life, human, mind, and society. The major method of exposition that they began using was a combination of engineering physics and a more academic pure physics. In 1981, Iberall was invited to the Crump Institute for Medical Engineering of UCLA, where he further refined the key concepts of homeokinetics, developing a physical scientific foundation for complex systems. Self-organizing Complex Systems A system is a collective of interacting ‚Äòatomistic‚Äô-like entities. The word ‚Äòatomism‚Äô is used to stand both for the entity and the doctrine. As is known from ‚Äòkinetic‚Äô theory, in mobile or simple systems, the atomisms share their ‚Äòenergy‚Äô in interactive collisions. That so-called ‚Äòequipartitioning‚Äô process takes place within a few collisions. Physically, if there is little or no interaction, the process is considered to be very weak. Physics deals basically with the forces of interaction‚Äîfew in number‚Äîthat influence the interactions. They all tend to emerge with considerable force at high ‚Äòdensity‚Äô of atomistic interaction. In complex systems, there is also a result of internal processes in the atomisms. They exhibit, in addition to the pair- by-pair interactions, internal actions such as vibrations, rotations, and association. If the energy and time involved internally creates a very large‚Äîin time‚Äîcycle of performance of their actions compared to their pair interactions, the collective system is complex. If you eat a cookie and you do not see the resulting action for hours, that is complex; if boy meets girl and they become ‚Äòengaged‚Äô for a protracted period, that is complex. What emerges from that physics is a broad host of changes in state and stability transitions in state. Viewing Aristotle as having defined a general basis for systems in their static-logical states and trying to identify a logic- metalogic for physics, e.g., metaphysics, then homeokinetics is viewed to be an attempt to define the dynamics of all those systems in the universe. Flatland physics vs Homeokinetic physics Ordinary physics is a flatland physics, a physics at some particular level. Examples include nuclear and atomic physics, biophysics, social physics, and stellar physics. Homeokinetic physics combines flatland physics with the study of the up down processes that binds the levels. Tools, such as mechanics, quantum field theory, and the laws of thermodynamics, provide key relationships for the binding of the levels, how they connect, and how the energy flows up and down. And whether the atomisms are atoms, molecules, cells, people, stars, galaxies, or universes, the same tools can be used to understand them. Homeokinetics treats all complex systems on an equal footing, animate and inanimate, providing them with a common viewpoint. The complexity in studying how they work is reduced by the emergence of common languages in all complex systems.

History Original construction of the Church of Saint Porphyrius dates back to 425 CE,Cohen and Lewis, 1978, p. 119 however the modern construction was undertaken by the Crusaders in the 1150s or 1160s and they dedicated it St. Porphyrius. Records from the 15th century show that dedication of the church was also attested to the Virgin Mary. In 1856, it was renovated. There are some cornices and bases that date back to the Crusader period, but much of the other portions are later additions. The church was one of the targets of attacks in the Palestinian Territories in the wake of Pope Benedict XVI's remarks citing a Byzantine scholar's critical position on Islam. It may be the church was targeted for the reason of the Byzantine link, or just being a convenient Christian shrine, even though there is no connection between the church and the Vatican. Architecture The Church of Saint Porphyrius has a rectangular shape, ending with a half-domed roofed temple.Travel in Gaza MidEastTravelling.

The buildings were built with timber pillars, concrete slab and iron roof.Eugene Khoo, 2007 A History of Taiping, Malaysia There was an iron fountain donated by Mr Ng Boo Bee that originally stood in front of the market, many years later it was removed and replaced with a simple concrete clock tower. These markets served two different functions, one as a dry market and the other as a wet market. During the heyday, these markets were stocked with fresh vegetables, fish and meats, almost everything was available from here. The price for all goods was controlled by the government according to a report made by Sir Frank Swettenham when he served as the Acting Resident of Perak in 1884 until 1886.Swettenham, Sir Frank, British Malaya: An Account of the Origin and Progress of British Influence in Malaya, London, (1955) Sir Frank Swettenham also acted as the man who responsible for the establishment of the markets, he suggested to the then British Resident of Perak, Sir Hugh Low that a market was needed as the population growth of the town was drastic. Eventually the proposal was granted, in Sir Hugh Low‚Äôs journal was written that, \\"the town has a good model for others, with a well maintained market for the public use\\".

Afon Fathew flows through the village and into the River Dysynni. The village is situated to the north east of the town of Tywyn, at the junction of the A493 and B4405 roads. Although the village is usually spelt Bryncrug in English, the community name uses the Welsh language version, Bryn-crug. The population of the community taken at the 2011 census was 622. To the south west of the village stood Ynysymaengwyn, a mansion built in 1758 but now demolished. To the south stood Cynfal motte-and-bailey castle, built in 1137 by Cadwaladr ap Gruffydd, brother of Owain Gwynedd.

The company manages visa and passport issuance- related administrative and non-discretionary tasks for its client governments. The company began as a \\"side project\\" at a luxury Swiss travel group Kuoni in 2001 by chief executive Zubin Karkaria. Formerly based in India, the company is now headquartered in Dubai with offices in 147 countries. In 2018, VFS processed more than 25 million visa applications, often containing passport details and financial histories, on behalf of the British Home Office and 61 other governments. The outsourcing company is owned by a private equity fund and, as VF Worldwide Holdings, is incorporated in the African tax haven of Mauritius. Investors in the outsourcing company include the Chinese and Abu Dhabi investment authorities, the Ohio Police and Fire Pension Fund, and yogurt billionaire Theo M√ºller. It has been criticized for allegedly exploitative practices and for its lack of transparency. VFS Global has been \\"accused of pressuring visa applicants\\" into purchasing premium services which \\"they often don't need and can't afford.\\" In 2019, the British Home Office was \\"deluged\\" by complaints from customers applying for visas using VFS Global, many of whom accused the company \\"of exploiting vulnerable applicants for profit.\\" Applicants ‚Äî \\"the majority of whom are from lower-income countries\\" ‚Äî have asserted they have \\"missed flights and were wrongly denied visas due to delays and administrative errors, including apparent failure to scan vital documents.\\"  History = Origins and revenue model  VFS Global was established in Mumbai, India, in 2001. In a Forbes magazine interview, CEO Zubin Karkaria claimed he founded VFS after he had \\"persuaded the US government to pilot a scheme for Indian visa applicants to the US at its Mumbai embassy.\\" Both the shareholding and governing structure of VFS Global is not made public by Kuoni or VF Worldwide Holdings, an offshore corporation formed to own VFS Global and \\"incorporated in the African tax haven of Mauritius.\\" By 2005, VFS Global had acquired lucrative contracts with eleven governments including the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. The outsourcing company obtains its revenues from service fees paid directly by visa applicants, in addition to the visa fees which are remitted to the diplomatic mission. By 2007, the company had obtained its first global account from UK Visas and Immigration for operations across 33 countries. Within one year of gaining its account with the UK government, the company's image was tarnished by a data breach which exposed the sensitive information of UK visa applicants. Despite this breach, the outsourcing company obtained a major contract with the United Kingdom in 2014 \\"to administer around 70% of the UK's visa applications.\\" Critics later alleged \\"this contract was a crucial step- change in how [British] visa applicants could be squeezed for more money.\\"  Expansion and growth  In August 2017, the outsourcing company acquired the UK-based visa service provider TT Services (TTS) for an undisclosed amount. At the time of the acquisition, TTS operated 51 visa application centres in over 35 countries with 216 employees. Later that year, in November 2017, VFS Global expanded its visa services in Cyprus with new centres launched in the additional cities of Thiruvananthapuram, Goa, Gurugram, and Jaipur. These expansion increased the amount of visa centres where applicants were offered additional services, such as SMS updates, courier services, and online tracking services. In June 2018, Kuoni Group, also known as Kuoni Travel Holding, after selling all the travel agency businesses and licensed the brand \\"Kuoni Travel\\" to the new owners of the former subsidiaries, had merged with VFS Global, its major business at that time. In January 2019, The parent company of VFS Global, EQT Partners, had declared to sell VFS. In August 2019, a financial investigation by the British newspaper The Independent revealed that VFS Global had experienced exponential growth in recent years and its shareholders had \\"extracted about ¬£567m via 'distribution to owner' payments and writing off intercompany loans in the past two years.\\" The newspaper attributed this growth to the outsourcing company's \\"exploitative\\" business practices.  Services and partnerships  The outsourcing company has pursued partnerships with foreign tourist boards and airlines in an attempt to increase its revenues. In 2013, VFS Global partnered with the Italian State Tourist Board to open a Mumbai office in order to promote Italy as a tourism destination for Indian nationals. In February 2015, VFS Global likewise partnered with the Macau Tourism Office in order to promote Macau as a popular tourist destination. In 2017, the outsourcing company partnered with Atout France, the France Tourism Development Agency, in order to promote France as a tourist destination for foreign travelers.  Controversies = 2005-2007 Data breaches  Initial breach and inaction = Between 2005 and 2007, a critical security flaw in the VFS Global application website for the British Foreign & Commonwealth Office resulted in many visa applications from India, Nigeria and Russia being publicly accessible. Sensitive data stored in VFS's online service could be accessed by simply \\"making changes\\" to the VFS website's URL address. By doing so, any viewer could access the company's \\"database of visa applicants, which stored passport numbers, names, addresses, and travel details.\\" The security flaw had been known since December 2005, but the issue was addressed only in May 2007 following media reports. The security breach had been first reported in December 2005 by an Indian national, Sanjib Mitra, after which no effective remedial action was taken by VFS. The same applicant went public in May 2007 after he noticed that his earlier warnings were ignored. = UK Government investigation = Following this data breach and media outcry, the UK Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs appointed an independent investigator to uncover the reasons for the breach of security in the VFS online visa application website. The subsequent report, released in July 2007, highlighted \\"organisational failures\\" by VFS. VFS had purportedly underestimated what was necessary in order to protect personal data to the levels expected by the UK Data Protections Act. The report also recommended that the VFS online visa applications not be resumed for applications from India. In November 2007, the UK Information Commissioner's Office announced that it had found the Foreign Office's contractual relationship with VFS Global to be in breach of its obligations under the Data Protection Act 1998. The Information Commissioner's Office required the Foreign Office to sign a statement that it would comply with the Data Protection Act and would not reopen the VFS UK visa online facility. As a result of this ruling, the Foreign Office reviewed its relationship with VFS and briefly sought to significantly reduce its outsourced work, especially in the area of IT. After the report was issued, VFS spent \\"$2 million on online security in the next year,\\" and introduced various measures to ensure safe and secure business environment. One of them was to make all its centres ISO compliant. Following this incident, several governments were critical of VFS Global's abilities and raised concerns over its lackluster security protocols. \\"There's the accountability issue, the privacy issue and why are we outsourcing to a for-profit entity something that belongs in the security mandate?\\" asked Victor Wong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council. Likewise, Liam Clifford, an immigration expert working for Global Visas, raised security concerns associated with VFS Global's operations: \\"Once you put this work in the hands of private companies overseas, you no longer have the same protection.\\"  2015 Data breaches  VFS Global's online security again came under scrutiny in July 2015 when its online visa forms for Italy allowed any user to access the personal information of other applicants ‚Äî including their date of birth, passport details and addresses ‚Äî if they input the ID number of another person when logging into the system. Following the discovery of 2015 security issues, the outsourcing company stated in 2016 that they had instituted new security protocols. VFS Global claims to annually renew its ISO 27001 audit and certification.  2014-2019 Monopoly allegations  VFS Global has been alleged to be a monopolistic enterprise operating in the visa outsourcing sector. Its alleged monopoly has led to issues related to prohibitive visa application prices and also sparked concerns in the areas of centralised document handling and content security, though VFS claims a streamlined application submission process in all its centres. For example, VFS staff at its collection offices in Southeast Asia were accused of abusing its dominant market status by creating their own extemporaneous rules for visa applicants. This included entry criteria to the VFS centres and also level of assistance offered to applicants. Three years later, in June 2014, the outsourcing company was investigated by the South African Competition Commission regarding allegations of market dominance by VFS Global in the visa support services market to foreign embassies. The Commission's spokesperson Themba Mathebula stated that the commission's screening unit had completed its preliminary investigation and submitted its report, recommending further formal investigations into the outsourcing company. In a statement to European Union parliament in July 2018, VFS Global denied that their outsourcing company is operating as a monopoly, though its prepared statement did not cite any outsourcing companies with whom they are in competition for winning contracts.  2019 Extortion allegations  The outsourcing company has been accused of \\"extorting\\" and \\"mistreating\\" vulnerable visa applicants in developing countries such as Nigeria. Additionally, the company was also reported to be under investigation for \\"allegations of abusive market dominance and unlawful tender procedures, resulting in excessive visa application prices and hidden fees.\\"  Customer criticism  As of September 2019, VFS Global has a score of 1.5 out of 5 stars on Trustpilot. Of the 2,608 submitted reviews by customers, approximately 76% awarded the service 1 star. Common complaints reported include disrespectful behaviour of staff towards customers, failure to follow up timely on applications, delays in returning passports to applicants on time, in addition to lost passports. Former VFS employees have purportedly alleged the outsourcing company is systematically deceitful to visa applicants and that passports have been occasionally mishandled or lost due to poor organization.

Located on the east flank of Bennett Mountain, it drains into Schultz Creek, a tributary of Yulupa Creek. A remnant of Ledson Marsh near the end of the dry season Earthen dam The marsh was formed by an earthen embankment dam about long, constructed in 1930 by a former landowner. The dam is about high and wide at its crest. Over the years, the dam deteriorated, allowing water to seep through it and causing the marsh to dry out in the autumn and refill during the winter rains. The deterioration was partly due to rodent holes and partly due to stumps left by the felling of eucalyptus trees that were planted on both sides of the embankment. There was concern over the dam's safety. A catastrophic dam failure would destroy the marsh habitat and clog various Sonoma Creek tributaries with sediment. The California Department of Parks and Recreation therefore repaired the dam in such a way as to preserve the marsh's seasonality. ;California Red-legged Frogs Because of its seasonality, the marsh was colonized by California Red- legged Frogs, a federal and state listed threatened species.

Most allergies occur in dogs over 6 months old. A dog that is repeatedly exposed to a particular allergen becomes sensitized to it, and the immune system overreacts to a subsequent exposure, most commonly manifesting in the form of skin irritation. Some of the signs are redness, itching, hair loss, and recurring skin infections from the irritation. Skin irritation may be generalized (all over) or localized (isolated to one or more specific areas). The dog may be more prone to scratching and licking at the irritated site, further exacerbating the problem. Other common signs of allergies include coughing, sneezing, wheezing, ocular and nasal discharge, vomiting, diarrhea, and licking of the paws. While it may be possible to identify the cause of an allergic response, it is best to seek attention from a veterinarian to identify the best treatment possible. Shawn Messonnier (July 6, 2000). The Allergy Solution for Dogs: 1‚Äì10 To identify the specific allergens to which the dog is sensitive, veterinarians will commonly use a serum allergy test or a skin allergy test. Veterinarians may recommend either over the counter Benadryl without added decongestant or Zyrtec to alleviate clinical signs. If the allergy is more severe, allergy immunotherapy may be recommended.http://www.dogcarelife.com/zyrtec-for-dogs/ There are a number of different kinds of allergies from which dogs may suffer. They may be gut- induced, skin-induced, and respiratory-induced. Allergies= Gut-induced allergies  Gut-induced allergies, or food allergies, are common health concerns. They may be induced by an allergic reaction to the preservatives or artificial coloring used in commercial dog foods, or they may be triggered by the intact protein source used in the food. Protein sources that commonly offend include beef, soy, chicken, and turkey. Clinical signs of gut-induced allergies include the presence of rashes, itchy or tender skin, gastrointestinal upsets like vomiting and diarrhea, and swelling. Dogs with sensitivities to food that contain these common proteins may benefit from food that contains a novel protein source. A novel protein is any protein not commonly used in dog food, such as elk, rabbit, or bison. Novel protein diets make up the majority of hypoallergenic dog food diets.  Skin-induced allergies Flea allergy dermatitis= Dog with flea allergy dermatitis and secondary folliculitis Flea allergy dermatitis is caused by the bite of a flea. The primary cause is due to the flea's saliva that is injected into the feeding site, triggering an immune response in the dog. This may include redness of the skin and pruritus, causing the dog to scratch, bite, and lick parts of the body, most commonly the base of the tail, abdomen, and head. A dog may find it soothing to be bathed in cool water with a shampoo designed for flea treatment. If the dog has self-mutilated by chewing or scratching, antibiotics may be needed, depending on the severity of the problem.Lowell Ackerman (January 1994). Guide to Skin and Haircoat Problems in Dogs: 14 = Bacterial hypersensitivity = Bacterial hypersensitivity is caused by an exaggerated immune system response to the natural flora normally found on the skin, like Staphylococcus bacteria. It may be identified by red blotches, pus pockets, hair loss and a skin formation that looks like ringworm, called epidermal collarettes. Typically, bacterial allergies are secondary to other problems the dog may have, such as parasitism or hormonal disorders.Lowell Ackerman (January 1994). Guide to Skin and Haircoat Problems in Dogs: 20‚Äì28 = Contact allergies= Contact allergies are the least common type of allergies. It results from direct contact with the allergen. The signs of contact allergies are very similar to those of flea allergies - skin irritation at the point of contact and itching. Sources of allergens include, but are not limited to, the synthetic materials in bedding, plants, pesticides, or household cleaning products.Lowell Ackerman (January 1994). Guide to Skin and Haircoat Problems in Dogs: 18 Removing the source of the allergen is usually sufficient in solving the problem.  Respiratory-induced allergiesAtopy= Atopy is synonymous with \\"inhalant allergy.\\" It manifests as a condition called atopic dermatitis, which is characterized by itching, biting, hair loss and face rubbing. Other signs may be the presence of papules, which are small red bumps, or pustules, which are small pimple- like lesions. Atopy is a genetic disorder that predisposes the immune system of a dog to react to tree pollens, grass pollens, weed pollens, molds, mildew, and house dust mites, and can also be caused by exposure to chemical irritants, like common household products.Lowell Ackerman (January 1994). Guide to Skin and Haircoat Problems in Dogs: 8 Dogs will often have reactions to multiple allergens and may also experience concurrent flea or food allergies. Certain breeds are prone to atopic dermatitis, like Golden Retrievers, Irish Setters, Lhasa Apsos, Dalmatians, Bulldogs, and Old English Sheepdogs. Treatment methods include special shampoos, prescribed oral steroids, oral cyclosporines, and natural treatments like administration of omega-3 fatty acids. Desensitization therapy, involving the repetitive administration of allergy injection serum, may help desensitize the immune system to that particular allergen.

The party was banned by the Communist Party of China (CPC).Gittings, John. The Changing Face of China: From Mao to Market. (2005). Oxford University Press. The Local Committee of CDP was established by Zheng Cunzhu, a former student leader in Anhui province in 1989 and a secret CDP member in China since 2001. History=Foundation of CDP While the earliest date listed for the founding to be June 25, 1998, the group registered the party on June 28, 1998, when Bill Clinton was visiting China.Goldsmith, Jack L. Wu, Tim. (2006). Who Controls the Internet?: Illusions of a Borderless World. Oxford University Press. Wang Youcai, one of the main activists during the 1989 Tiananmen protest along with Wang Donghai and Lin Hui went to the Civil Public Affair Hall of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province to officially register this party. The registration was declined. Communist Party response The next day on June 29, 1998, Wang was arrested by the state police at his own home in front of his family members. He was charged with creating opposition against the Chinese government. His trial began on December 18, he had no lawyer defense, his trial lasted only a few hours. He was quickly sentenced on December 21, 1998, to 11 years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of political rights for subversion. On the same day, Xu Wenli, a 55-year-old member was also sentenced to 13 years for overthrowing the Communist party.Mackerras, Colin. (2001). The New Cambridge Handbook of Contemporary China. On December 22, 1998, Qing Yongmin was sentenced to 12 years to prison for harming state security. Li Peng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress at the time proclaimed, \\"If a group is designed to negate the leadership of the Communist Party, then it will not be allowed to exist.\\" The Communist party declared the CDP an illegal organization, followed by a crackdown in Beijing in 1998. After the sentencing on December 23, 1998, the Supreme People's Court then declared that, \\"anyone who knowingly publishes, prints, copies, or distributes material containing incitement to overthrow state power and the socialist system or split the country\\" could be tried for crimes. Such charges could result in life sentences for film directors, computer software developers, writers and artists, and media and publishing personnel, all of whom are subject to the new directive.Hrw.org Crackdown on other members There were hundreds of CDP members that were detained, arrested, and sentenced to prison. Liu Xianbin, Wu Yilong, Gao Hongmin, Zha Jianguo, Mao Qinxiang, Zhu Yufu, Zhuzhengming, Liu Shizhun, Xu Guang, She Wanbao, Chen Shuqing, are some of the members of the party. Cyber dissident He Depu was also arrested in a correction facility. Disunion of CDPTwo different ways= There were two main ways to establish the China Democracy Party in 1998, one was represented by the founder Wang Youcai and the other Xu Wenli. Wang Youcai tried to register the party according to the constitution which protects freedom of association, but Xu Wenli just proclaimed the establishment of the party without registration. Wang Youcai is the leader of rational way while Xu Wenli the radical. =First organization of China Democracy Party in the USA= Most of the CDP founders in 1989 were arrested but Mr. Xie Wanjun, the founder of the Party in Shandong province fled to the USA and later established China Democracy Party Foundation in New York. Two new groups were established later by Mr. Wang Jun and Mr. Liu Dongxing who worked together with Xie Wanjun before they built their own CDP groups. =CDP Overseas Headquarter= Later Xu Wenli was exiled to the US on December 24, 2002. Without discussing with Xie Wanjun to build a united Party, Xu Wenli established a new group: CDP Oversea Headquarter and his party did not collaborate with Xie Wanjun's party. This was the start of dissociation of CDP. =Coordinative Service Platform of China Democracy Party= Wang Youcai was exiled to the USA on March 4, 2004. He established China Democracy Party Coordinative Service Platform which supported by the members of China Democracy Party members who are in China, overseas students, and exiled China Democracy Party Members. =No United Central Committee of CDP= Because there was no chance for CDP founders to have a meeting for the establishment of united Central Committee of China Democracy Party in 1998, because there were two different ways at the beginning, because the founders in exile could not collaborate in the USA, China Democracy Party can not be established as a united party. There exist several parties claiming to be the \\"headquarters\\" or \\"Central Committee\\", but actually they do not control each other but develop independently. In January 2008, party member Zheng Cunzhu established the Local Committee of China Democracy Party in Los Angeles. Zheng Cunzhu was a former student leader during 1989's pre-democratic movements in Anhui province, and he published an open letter to the leaders of China to advocate the restarting of political reform. The Local Committee of CDP will try to establish China Democracy Party in the local cities and prefer the local practice of democracy. There are two cities in California: Los Angeles and San Francisco having an office of LCCDP.

It was developed from the C.IV and optimised for high-altitude missions that would allow it to operate at heights that would render it immune to interception by enemy fighters.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft 1985, p. 2834. Work on the C.VII took place after a similar attempt to develop the C.III into a high-altitude machine as the C.V failed.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Aircraft 1985, p. 2833. Design and development The most significant difference between the C.IV and C.VII was the choice of the Maybach Mb IVa engine to replace the Mercedes D.IV. Although the Maybach engine was around 8% less powerful than the Mercedes (when measured at the sea level), it could continue to provide most of its power output while at altitude, where power from the Mercedes engine decreased more rapidly as height increased. Other changes included wings of slightly greater area and an airscrew of larger diameter.Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 203. The crew were provided with oxygen generators and electrically-heated flight suits.Murphy 2005, p. 122. Rumpler produced the C.VII in two versions: a standard radio-equipped reconnaissance machine, and a photographic version named the Rubild (or Rubilt) (Bild means \\"picture\\" in German). Operational history The two versions of the Rumpler C.VII were in service simultaneously. The \\"standard\\" C.VII was used for \\"armed\\" long- distance reconnaissance. The armament was one fixed, synchronized LMG 08/15 Spandau machine gun firing forward, and one manually operated 7.92 mm (.312 in) Parabellum MG14 machine gun at the observer/gunner's rear position (the observer also operated a radio). The \\"Rubild\\" was a \\"stripped-down\\" version that dispensed with the forward gun and eliminated all other extraneous equipment in order to carry specialized cameras. The Rubild was capable of operating as high as 7,300 m (24,000 ft), and could maintain 160 km/h (100 mph) at 6,100 m (20,000 ft).Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 202. The high-altitude version proved practically invulnerable to interception above 5,500 m (18,000 ft).Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 204. Allied combat reports most often featured the high-flying Rubild which could operate regularly at altitudes above 6,100 m (20,000 ft). The type was particularly difficult to intercept,Gray and Thetford 1962, pp. 203‚Äì204. as the Allied fighters were seldom able even to climb to such altitude: At the end of the war, at least one Rumpler C.VII was captured and sent to the United States.

Ecology Individuals live for 3‚Äì5 years in groups in rocky crevices at depths of up to . Females grow faster than males, and the population is highly seasonal, with a pronounced peak in the autumn. They are preyed upon by a variety of fish, including species of Mullidae, Moronidae, Sparidae and Batrachoididae. Description P. serratus may be distinguished from other species of shrimp by the rostrum, which curves upwards, is bifurcated at the tip and has 6‚Äì7 along its upper edge, and 4‚Äì5 teeth on the lower edge. Other speciesmay have a slightly curved rostrum, but then the teeth on its dorsal surface continue into the distal third, which is untoothed in P. serratus. P. serratus is pinkish brown, with reddish patterns, and is typically long, making it the largest of the native shrimp and prawns around the British Isles. P. serratus is one of the few invertebrates to have its hearing studied in detail; it is sensitive to frequencies between 100 Hz and 3 kHz, with an acuity similar to that of generalist fish. While the hearing range of a P. serratus individual changes as it grows, all are capable of hearing tones at 500 Hz. Fisheries A small commercial fishery exists for P. serratus on the west coast of Great Britain, chiefly in West Wales (Cemaes Head to the Ll≈∑n Peninsula), but extending increasingly far north to include parts of Scotland. In Ireland, fishing for P. serratus began at Baltimore, County Cork in the 1970s and subsequently expanded. A peak landing of 548 t was recorded in 1999, and four counties account for over 90% of the catch ‚Äî Galway, Kerry, Cork and Waterford. There is now concern that the current levels of exploitation may represent overfishing, and measures are being considered to limit the catch, such as a minimum landing size.

While the fate of most of the chain's stores was conversion to Safeway, the final stores still trading as Presto were either closed or sold in 1998. History=Early years The company was established in the north of England and in Scotland in the early 1960s where its primary base remained but for some years Presto did have a nationwide presence. According to the Institute of Grocery Distribution the name derives from the town of Prestonpans, the location in which the first Presto store was opened. A store also opened around the same time in the Preston Grange Estate in Preston, Tyne and Wear. Presto was a division of Allied Suppliers which also operated 500 Lipton supermarkets in England and Wales as well as the brands Galbraith and R & J Templeton with around 85 supermarkets in Scotland. Allied also operated a discount chain, Lo-Cost as well as Cordon Bleu, a chain of freezer centres. Presto was the most significant brand, operating primarily large supermarkets and superstores throughout the country. In 1979 it purchased the south east based chain Cater Brothers and incorporated them into the Presto brand. Acquisition by Argyll Foods Presto Food Market, Cheltenham, 1982 In 1982, Presto and its 136 stores transferred, together with the rest of Allied Suppliers to Argyll Foods. Allied Suppliers was sold by its then owner James Goldsmith for ¬£101 million.History of the Argyll Group plc For some time Argyll continued to operate the brands as it had acquired them. The brand re-launch The old Liptons, Galbraith, Templeton and Presto logos In 1985, Argyll began a major re-organisation of its food store division. In Scotland and Northern England, the Hintons, Lipton, Galbraith and Templeton stores were either re-branded as Presto stores or closed. For some time, Hintons' direct marketing magazine \\"Going Shopping\\" continued with the Presto name including the headline \\"Presto - Our Heart's in the North\\". Liptons stores in the rest of England and Wales were either closed or converted to Presto (larger stores) or Lo-Cost (smaller stores). Argyll also launched a new slogan in 1985 moving from \\"for the best, best go to Presto\\" to \\"You'll be impressed in Presto\\". To complement the new slogan, a new logo was also launched featuring yellow, blue and red as well as, for a short time, a shopping basket. The new logo was used on all converted stores while original Presto stores retained the old logo on their exterior signage throughout their life. A number of new Presto Superstores were also opened featuring the new logo. In 1986, the conversion programme was complete and Argyll was set for expansion and new Presto regional distribution centres in Bristol, Wakefield, Bathgate and Welwyn Garden City were planned. Initial conversion to Safeway In 1987, Argyll Foods purchased the UK operations of Safeway, which resulted in seven Presto stores (including Farnham, Morden and Chandlers Wharf, Stockton-on-Tees) being converted to Safeway on a trial basis. In 1988 a further 57 Presto stores (including the store at Sedgley, West Midlands, which had opened only a year earlier) had been converted to Safeway. Argyll began phasing out Presto's own brand range, replacing it with the Safeway own-brands throughout the estate. However, some Presto brands remained: pre-packed bread continued to be sold as a Presto own brand in Presto stores. While most (but not all) of the Presto superstores were converted to Safeway during this period, the smaller stores located in Scotland and the north of England continued to trade as Presto. Revival of Presto The first new Presto store to open since 1987 opened in Kirkwall (Orkney) in 1991.Discussion on construction of Presto store This was shortly followed by another new store in Lockerbie.Store Location Detail In March 1993, Argyll split its retail operations into two divisions, Safeway Stores, and Presto and Lo-Cost Stores. Super Marketing reported that Sir Alistair Grant stated in a memo, \\"The creation of Presto and Lo-Cost divisions is an important move which signifies our commitment to these important businesses and our wish that their direction and management should be given a strong specific focus.\\" When Argyll had acquired Safeway, it had planned to phase out Presto, but these stores were expanded because of strong customer loyalty in the north.Answers.com In 1993 Argyll also acquired 4 supermarkets from Norco in Scotland.Scotland Herald Article Three of these stores were converted to Presto (in Banchory, Ellon, and Westhill) and one larger store (Elgin) was converted to Safeway. More new stores opened over the next couple of years as well as replacements for existing Presto stores such as the new build Presto store at Springfield in Stokesley, North Yorkshire which replaced an older former Hintons location.Article on Stokesley history A limited range of Presto own-label products was also re-introduced on more popular lines as can be seen on the image on this page. Safeway brands continued to be used on other lines. Disappearance A former Presto store in Cornhill, Aberdeen. The tiles behind the counter are a clear remnant of the store's Presto era In 1996 Argyll announced it was changing its name to Safeway and would be converting the remaining 110 Presto stores to Safeway.UK Business Park While Presto branded products, and even carrier bags, were quickly replaced with Safeway, the conversion of the stores was not complete until mid-1998 when the final Presto (mainly smaller) stores which were not to be converted to Safeway were sold on to other retailers including convenience operator Bells Stores.

Oscar \\"Oski\\" Conti (191430 October 1979) was a prominent Argentine cartoonist and humorist. Life and work Oscar Esteban Conti was born in Buenos Aires in 1914. Enrolling at the National Fine Arts School, he helped finance his studies by creating caricatures for local advertisers. Following graduation, he studied scenography at the Buenos Aires Academy for Higher Studies. Despite his distaste for the medium, Conti was hired by Cascabel magazine as a cartoonist in 1942; at Cascabel, he first began signing his work as \\"Oski.\\" Creating his only comic strip character, \\"Amarroto\\" (loosely translated as \\"Miser\\") for Rico Tipo in 1944 (one of the best-selling satirical weeklies in Argentina at the time), he was enlisted by humorist Carlos Warnes (\\"C√©sar Bruto\\") to illustrate his irreverent , a weekly satire of current events in which photos of the news were replaced by Oski's mocking caricatures. His work was in growing demand during subsequent years, and his elongated human characters and featherless birds fixtures in a number of popular mainstream magazines and in Clar√≠n, the most-widely circulated news daily in Argentina and Latin America. His work brought him to the attention of French writer Jean-Paul Sartre, who had Oski create the backdrop for the Buenos Aires performance of his play, The Polite Prostitute in 1947. Irish writer George Bernard Shaw also turned to him for the Argentine premiere of his play, Androcles and the Lion, which played in 1953. Oski had an anthology of his work published in 1952, as well as an animated film, The First Foundation of Buenos Aires, in 1959. Made in an era in which such historical events were treated as sacrosanct epics by the State and much of the media, First Foundation was a slapstick look at the imposing Spanish Conquistadores and their conflict with retaliating indigenous peoples. A similar theme prevailed is his satirical comic book, The True History of the Indies, in 1968. He also illustrated unconventional editions of Argentine literary epics, such a University of Buenos Aires edition of Estanislao del Campo's Fausto (an adaptation of the traditional tale - with a gaucho as the protagonist). Sought internationally, he relocated to Santiago, Chile in 1970, partly out of support for President Salvador Allende. There, he illustrated Cabrochico Magazine until returning to Argentina in 1972. Oski contributed to the left- wing Satiric√≥n magazine in Buenos Aires. He illustrated the best-selling True History of Sports in 1973 and published another anthology, Oski in His Own Ink. Satiric√≥n's closure by executive order in 1974, however, led Oski to begin eschewing political subject matter, instead working with C√©sar Bruto in The Brutoski Medicinal Handbook (a would-be Medical school textbook) and their unique version of the seminal Salerno School of Medicine's medieval compendium. The worsening climate of political violence and repression in Argentina during 1975 led Oski to move to Barcelona, Spain late that year, where he briefly worked for Lumen Publishing. Relocating to Rome in 1976, he illustrated a number of left-leaning periodicals such as Italy's L'Unit√†, though his declining health and a certain loosening of restrictions by Argentina's dictatorship in 1979 led him to return. Contributing a segment in a public television mockumentary of the 1978 FIFA World Cup (won by Argentina), Oski died on October 30, 1979, at 65. Numerous posthumous anthologies of his work have been published since, notably El Maestroski in 1989.

In his \\"Tuscan\\" rhymes there is a fruitless attempt to catch the attention of the Counts of Lemos, the foremost representatives of the Spanish crown in Naples. He was a close friend of Luigi Caponaro, who he frequently cites in his work. Regardless of his commemoration by Basile in 1627, it is generally believed, due to several handwritten manuscripts, that Cortese lived at least until 1640 and it is consequently believed that he attended and perhaps participated in his own funeral. Cortese is very important for Baroque and dialectical literature, in that, with Basile, he laid the foundations for the artistic and literary dignity of the Neapolitan language as opposed to the Tuscan dialect in which Cortese had also produced a number of largely laudatory works.  Works =The Vaiasseide A mock-heroic poem in five cantos, where the lyric meter and the heroic themes are lowered to the level of the protagonists: a group of vaiasse, common Neapolitan women who express themselves in dialect. Its writing is comic and transgressive, where much importance is given to the participation of the plebeian choir in the mechanics of the action. The reader is literally catapulted into the day-to-day life of the vaiasse where the main element is the investigation of the world through which Cortese makes into a world which is not his own and which he describes with irony and tragedy. The Voyage in Parnassus This work, in dialect, is a diagnosis of the condition of literature and of people of letters, with a variety of autobiographical allusions, filled with bitterness and pessimism. The whole thing is situated in Parnassus where Apollo and his Muses reside and where the poet can set forth the sins of poetry, carried out in a degraded society, where the order of the day is the crime of plagiarism. The whole resolves itself with a fairytale ending and the bitter disillusionment of the poet who see all of his ambitions coming to naught.

It was entered into the 1955 Cannes Film Festival. The plot revolves around the personal stories of a number of soldiers who are on their way to defend a strategic hill overlooking the road to Jerusalem.  Plot  In 1948, just four hours and 45 minutes before a ceasefire takes effect, Captain Yehuda Berger instructs four volunteers - James Finnegan, a British policeman (who fell in love with a Palestinian Jewish woman named Miriam Miszrahi); Allan Goodman; David Airan; and (at her insistence) Esther Hadassi (a Yemeni Jewish woman) - to take and hold the strategic \\"Hill 24\\", one of a number of hills dominating the highway into Jerusalem. Afterward, Finnegan relates how he first met Berger in 1946, two years before the start of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, while serving as a British policeman in Haifa. In a flashback, Finnegan is part of the police force rounding up Jews who came ashore in British-controlled Mandatory Palestine illegally at night. Finnegan finds an ailing Berger and Miriam Miszrahi, and goes to find medical help for Berger. He is relieved to learn that the pair escaped. Berger is a concentration camp survivor who arrived in Palestine illegally during the British Mandate period and joined the Jewish Brigade group to help other Jews make Aliyah Bet. Later Finnegan and Berger encounter one another at a checkpoint, where Berger is identified. Finnegan's superior lets Berger go, ordering Sergeant Finnegan to follow him and apprehend his associates. Berger spots the police tailing him and flees. The two policemen follow him all the way to an apartment, which turns out to be Miriam's, but Berger manages to get away. When Miriam gets home, she finds the police in her apartment. Miriam, a fourth generation Palestinian studying to be a teacher, is taken in for questioning and detained under the Emergency Defence Regulations. She is questioned about her relationship with Berger and the Jewish Underground. As she is being questioned Berger, who has been apprehended, is brought into the station. Miriam is released the next morning. Finnegan and Browning are ordered to keep her under surveillance. After several fruitless days, Lawson tells Finnegan he can make Miriam's acquaintance, much to Finnegan's delight. Finnegan falls in love with her and he convinces her to return to Haifa with him, where she is arrested by Finnegan's superior. Miriam later joins the army to fight in the 1948 War, and Finnegan joins also. He reveals to his fellow soldiers that he is an Irish Christian. Miriam and Finnegan meet briefly as Finnegan is deployed to Hill 24. As they drive towards the site of the operation Goodman, a New Yorker, tells the story of how he and Hadassi first met when he was wounded during the battle for the Old City. Hadassi, working as a nurse, helped care for him until the forces surrendered. They then signed up for Bergen's unit together. The four die on the hill. Hadassi's body is found still clutching an Israeli flag. It is declared that the Hill has been claimed for Israel.

He was an icon, a hero, and a leading Kikuyu musician, who has sold about half a million records.Eastafricanmusic.com: The Music Business in Kenya He was notable for his politically motivated songs either praising or criticising the government. His music covered the teachings of life, promiscuity and sexual harassment in Kenyan politics and social culture. He was known for his friendship with President Jomo Kenyatta, but after writing a song condemning the murder of Josiah Mwangi Kariuki, they ceased to be close. He also wrote songs praising President Daniel arap Moi. Early life Kamaru was from Kangema, Muranga District. In 1957 he moved to Nairobi where he got a cleaning job. His first formal job was working as a house-help and a nanny, earning enough money to purchase his first guitar. He started pursuing music in 1965.Daily Nation, Lifestyle Magazine, 18 April 2009: The memoirs of a musical maverick Career Kamaru made his first breakthrough in 1967 with Celina. The height of his musical career was between 1975 and 1985 due to the release of adults-only cassettes, all dealing with Kikuyu folk songs. In the late 1980s he was the first Kenyan artist to play at the Carnivore Restaurant, then only hosting foreign artists. According to Martin Dunford, the owner of the restaurant, Kamaru's vibrant performance opened doors for other Kenyan artists to perform at the venue. Many of Kamaru's songs were political, either praising or criticising the government.Kimani Njogu & Herv√© Maupeu (2007): Songs and Politics in Eastern Africa Initially he had a good relationship with president Jomo Kenyatta, but after Kamaru wrote a song in 1975 condemning the murder of Josiah Mwangi Kariuki he fell out with him. After Kenyatta's death, the succeeding president, Daniel arap Moi, was close to the artist. In 1980, Kamaru toured Japan as a part of President Moi's entourage. After the visit he composed Safari ya Japan praising the president. Moi grew displeased with Kamaru's support for multiparty democracy in the late 1980s. Kamaru received significant support from Voice of Kenya radio presenter Job Isaac Mwamto, who embraced the rise of Kenyan music, by presenting Kamaru's music to his radio stations. He was often called \\"Kenya's Jim Reeves\\". He recorded nearly 2,000 songs addressing morality and offering life teachings. The songs launched his status as a Kikuyu music legend and impacted East Africans‚Äô music scene with classic hits such as \\"Gathoni\\" and \\"Charia Ungi\\". His popular songs include \\"muhiki wa mikosi\\" and \\"muti uyu mukuona\\" among others. In the 1990s, Kamaru announced that he had been \\"born again\\" and would no longer perform the secular music on which he had built his career. In 1993, he turned to gospel music and disbanded his previous group, the Kamaru Supersounds.[ Allmusic profile] The change saw a plunge in his record sales. Kamaru was once the chairman of the Kenya Association of Phonographic Industries (KAPI), and owned a church ministry in Nairobi.Daily Nation, 7 July 2006: My Take - Joseph Kamaru He also ran two record stores in Nairobi.East African, 27 January 2003: Kamaru expressed interest in building a Kikuyu cultural home on one of his many farms in Murang‚Äôa to safeguard and protect the Kikuyu culture, though this was not accomplished as he died in October 2018. Illness and death In April 2018, after a circulating death hoax, Kamaru confirmed his good health in an interview with the Daily Nation. In the interview, Kamaru said \\"God could not take me until I oversaw changes in the music industry and mentor upcoming musicians to get the best songs for their audiences and in return get a better pay\\". Kamaru died on 3 October 2018 at the age of 79 at a hospital in Nairobi from complications of Parkinson's disease. He was survived by 2 siblings, 1 daughter and 3 sons.

It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets. The Atlas SLV-3 was a stage and a half rocket, built as a standardized replacement for earlier Atlas launch systems, which had been derived from the various Atlas missiles.Encyclopedia Astronautica - Atlas Most space launcher variants of the Atlas up to 1965 were derived from the D-series Atlas ICBM with custom modifications for the needs of the particular mission. The SLV-3 would use a standardized configuration based on the Atlas D missile for all launches with the exception of different widths for the top of the rocket depending on the upper stage being flown. The SLV-3 had thicker gauge tank walls to support the weight of upper stages as well as upgraded engines and removal of unneeded ICBM hardware such as retrorockets. Although the main engines had greater thrust, the verniers were detuned slightly in the interest of improved ISP (vacuum specific impulse). Variants of the SLV-3 flew until 2005 when the legacy Atlas was retired from service and replaced by the Atlas V, a completely new vehicle with conventional aircraft-style construction and different engines. Versions The following versions of the launch system were produced:http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_lau_fam/atlas.htmhttp://www.aerospaceprojectsreview.com/blog/wp- content/uploads/2014/08/Advanced-Atlas-Launch-Vehicle-Digest.pdf Baseline ATDA atop an Atlas SLV-3 launch vehicle The standard Atlas- Agena vehicle is best known for launching the Augmented Target Docking Adapter (ATDA) in support of the Gemini 9A mission. This occurred on 1 June 1966, and was the first flight of the Atlas SLV-3 as an independent vehicle. The ATDA failed because the payload shroud did not detach. The rocket was also used for three suborbital tests of X-23 PRIME reentry vehicles. A leftover SLV-3 from the PRIME program was used to launch a collection of small scientific satellites from VAFB's SLC-3E on August 16, 1968. Most Atlas-Agena SLV-3s were used for classified DoD payloads, especially KH-7 GAMBIT. A Burner II upper stage could be used to increase payload.Gunter's Space Page - Atlas-SLV3 Burner-2 * Thrust (pounds): 389,000 * Booster ISP: 252.5 * Sustainer ISP: 214.2 * Vernier ISP: 190.9/237.7 * Main impulse propellants (pounds): 246,549 * Launch weight (pounds): 260,928 * Booster jettison weight (pounds): 7,368 * Sustainer jettison weight (pounds): 6,569 Revision A The Mariner 7 launch by an Atlas SLV-3C. SLV-3A was the baseline SLV-3 with extended propellant tanks for longer burn time. It was used to launch OGO-3 in 1968, all remaining launches being classified Aquacade (satellite) (Canyon/Rhyolite) SIGINT satellites. All launches took place from LC-13 at CCAS. Revision B SLV-3B was a one-off Atlas used to launch the first OAO satellite, which consisted of the SLV-3C Atlas with the Agena and payload enclosed in a full- width fairing. Revision C The Atlas SLV-3D Centaur-D1A rocket which launching Mariner 10. SLV-3C was the standard Atlas-Centaur booster, without the tapered forward section to accommodate the smaller Agena stage.

According to Ronald Syme, he may have been first cousin to the consul Lucius Flavius Silva Nonius Bassus.Syme, Some Arval Brethren (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1980), p. 56 However, Olli Salomies provides some evidence against this, most notably an inscription that indicates his mother's name was Ann[ia(?)].Olli Salomies, Adoptive and polyonymous nomenclature in the Roman Empire, (Helsinski: Societas Scientiarum Fenica, 1992), pp. 80, 132f An inscription recovered from Urbs Salvia supplies his father's praenomen, Gaius; more importantly it provides details of his cursus honorum. = ILS 1011 The first office listed is the record of holding the chief magistracy of his home town in four census years; Anthony Birley explains this would extend 15 years from the first to the last tenure of this office.Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 211 Next was his adlection into the Roman Senate as an ex-praetor, although another line of the inscription states he was adlected as an ex-tribune; from this, and in analogy of the career of Gaius Caristanius Fronto, Birley deduces Salvius Liberalis \\"probably also held equestrian military appointments and had been on the right side in the year 69.\\" He was co-opted into the Arval Brethren 1 March 78, replacing the deceased Gaius Salonius Matidius Patruinus;Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 17 however, Salvius Liberalis was absent from the Arval ceremonies, returning by 30 October 81. Syme dates his tenure as juridicius Augustorum in Britain to 78-81,Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 25 while H. Peterson argues that Salvius was commander of the Legio V Macedonica from May 78 to 24 June 79 or slightly later, becoming juridicius between those dates.Peterson, \\"The Legionary command of Salvius Liberalis\\", Classical Philology, 57 (1962), p. 33 Birley proposes yet a third chronology, dating his command of V Macedonica prior to his co-option into the Arval Brethren, in which case \\"if the priesthood was in some sense a reward for meritorious service as a legionary legate, it would be intelligible that it should be mentioned after it.\\" Salvius Liberalis would then have held command of V Macedonica from 74 to 78, and served as juridicius from 78 to 81.Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 212 Afterwards Salvius Liberalis was proconsul of Macedonia. Syme argues, based on his absence again from the rituals of the Arval Brethren, he was proconsul in 84/85.Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 33 In contrast, Paul Leunissen suggests instead a slightly earlier proconsular tenure, 82/83.Leunissen, \\"Direct Promotions from Proconsul to Consul under the Principate\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Papyrologie und Epigraphik 89 (1991), p. 226 Birley also dates the proconsulship to 82/83. He returned to Rome accept appointment as suffect consul. Syme argues that in the aftermath of the trial of Gaius Caecilius Classicus, Salvius Liberalis was sent into exile.Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 31; Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, III.9.33 Birley notes he was \\"an outstanding advocate, fluent and forcible, whether prosecuting or for the defence\\" then notes, \\"His outspokenness won Vespasian's approval, but under Domitian he was in trouble, perhaps exile.\\" He returned at a later date, probably after the assassination of Domitian, Salvius Liberalis returned to Rome where he served as a lawyer. In 100, he was advocate for the defense of a proconsul of Africa prosecuted by Agricola.Syme, Some Arval Brethren, p. 37; Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, II.11.17 He is recorded as present for the meetings of the Arval Brotherhood in 101, but is missing from their Acta for 105, and it is likely he died between those years.Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 213  Family  A gravestone found near Rome dedicated to his wife, Vitellia C.f. Rufilla, by his son, Gaius Salvius Vitellanius, provides details of his family. Salvius Vitellanius is known to have been a military tribune in Legio V Macedonica and legate to the proconsul of Macedonia; Birley suspects in both cases he served under his father.  In fiction  Gaius Salvius Liberalis appears in books II-V of the Cambridge Latin Course as a conniving and evil man. He sentences many slaves to death, is disliked by most people and the main antagonist, who helps the emperor coordinate the downfall of many people. He is involved in a conspiracy against Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus and unravels the affair between Paris and the emperor's wife, Domitia.

It was designed by the engineer William Haywood and opened in 1867. The term circus describes the way the frontages of the buildings surrounding the junction curve round in a concave chamfer. Holborn Circus was described in Charles Dickens' Dictionary of London (1879) as \\"perhaps... the finest piece of street architecture in the City\\". Roads Roads meeting at Holborn Circus (1888 sketch plan) High Holborn (part of the A40 road) links Holborn Circus to the West End. To the east, Holborn Viaduct leads into the City of London financial district. Charterhouse Street and London's jewellery trade district of Hatton Garden exit Holborn Circus to the north. The district of Clerkenwell is to the north- east. New Fetter Lane (the start of the A4 road) and Shoe Lane exit to the south. Layout changes Holborn Circus is notorious for being an accident blackspot, topping a list of the worst accident locations in 2012. In May 2012 funding was secured for a ¬£4.4 million improvement project to the junction to reduce its high accident rate. Works included the relocation of the statue from the centre of the junction where it obstructed drivers' sight lines to a nearby position on High Holborn. The number of roads feeding into the junction was also reduced from six to five, with St Andrew Street now accessed from New Fetter Lane. Surrounding buildings On one side lies the church of St Andrew, Holborn, an ancient guild church that survived the Great Fire of London. However, the parochial authority decided to commission Christopher Wren to rebuild it. Although the nave was destroyed in the Blitz, the reconstruction was faithful to Wren's original. Many other buildings surrounding Holborn Circus were severely damaged during the Blitz. After the Second World War, many were demolished. From 1961 to 1994 the modernist headquarters of the Daily Mirror, designed by Sir Owen Williams and Anderson, Forster and Wilcox, were a prominent landmark overlooking the junction. The site is now occupied by the headquarters of the supermarket Sainsbury's. Prince Albert statue Statue of Prince Albert being removed for renovation July 2013 Prince Albert statue To the west of Holborn Circus there is an equestrian statue of Prince Albert by Charles Bacon (1874) which is the City of London's official monument to him. This bronze statue was originally sited in the middle of the circus and was moved in 2014 as part of improvement works to the junction. The statue features the prince consort in a field marshal's uniform raising his hat. The sculpture sits on an oblong plinth displaying plaques of Britannia, Albert and bronze figures representing commerce and peace. It was presented by Charles Oppenheim, of the diamond trading company De Beers, whose headquarters is on nearby Charterhouse Street.

On 4 February 2006, the Danish and Norwegian Embassies in Damascus were torched by protestors. Two embassies in Syria torched over cartoons CTV 4 February 2006 They waved portraits of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, leather-bound copies of the Quran, and the flags of Hamas and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hundreds of protesters hurled stones at the Danish embassy before scaling it, amid chants of \\"God is great\\" before moving on to attack the Norwegian embassy. A bomb threat was also made against the Danish embassy although no bomb was found. Danish Government response Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said that the governments of Iran and Syria had intentionally inflamed Muslim protests against a Danish newspaper's publication of cartoons depicting Muhammad to distract attention from their own diplomatic crises. He said \\"Syria and Iran have taken advantage of the situation because both countries are under international pressure,\\" Rasmussen also said he would \\"not exclude the possibility\\" that Syria had also been involved in violent protests in Beirut, Lebanon referring to the fact that similar violence against the Danish Embassy in Beirut occurred the following day after the attacks in Damascus. Foreign Minister Per Stig Moeller said that \\"Syria failed in its duty. It is completely unacceptable that the embassy was not protected by the Syrians\\". Stig Moeller said his government had also asked the European Union to condemn events in Damascus. Shortly after the attack, the Danish government told its nationals to leave Syria immediately. Danish diplomatic staff also left Syria and temporarily closed its embassy stating that staff \\"have provisionally left Syria because Syrian authorities reduced their protection to an unacceptably low level\\".KBC Syrian response A day after the attacks, Syria's foreign ministry issued a statement expressing \\"its regret over the acts of violence which accompanied the protests.\\" The Syrian Government denied any role in the attacks and blamed Denmark for the violence and an editorial in Syria's state-run daily newspaper said that \\"Denmark's government could have avoided reaching this point simply by issuing a sincere apology\\". Syrian Foreign Ministry condemned the cartoons as an offence to Muslims and Arabs and demanded the Danish government punish the offending paper.

Response from others The governments of the United States and Norway placed the blame for the rioting squarely on the Syrian government for failing to protect the embassies. The US Government said it was \\"inexcusable\\" for such damage to be inflicted on diplomatic missions. US President George W Bush condemned the violence against Danish embassies and spoke about this incident in a phone call to the Danish Prime Minister. Bush also said \\"I call upon the governments around the world to stop the violence, to be respectful, to protect property, protect the lives of innocent diplomats who are serving their countries overseas.\\" Scott McClellan, the White House Press Secretary said ‚ÄúWe hold Syria responsible for such violent demonstrations since they do not take place in that country without government knowledge and support,‚Äù Ensuing relations On the 27 February, Denmark's ambassador to Syria, Ole Egberg Mikkelsen, returned to Damascus, where he had a meeting with the Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister, Ahmad Arnous Syria \\"wants a good relationship with Denmark\\" Danmarks Radio, Copenhagen - 27 February 2006 They discussed how to enhance bilateral relations through dialogue and mutual understanding and Minister Arnous stressed Syria's keenness to continue relations with Denmark. The Syrian Government said it would compensate for the damages made in these incidents to embassies.

He was probably born at Hanbury Hall.Wardle. Terry Heroes and Villains of Worcestershire 2010 The History Press, Stroud p134 Early life Thomas Vernon was the great grandson of Rev Richard Vernon, and was descended from the Vernons of Whatcroft, who were related to the medieval Barons Vernon of Shipbrook, Cheshire. Rev Richard Vernon was born in Audley, Staffordshire, and was presented to the living of Hanbury, Worcestershire, in 1580. It was a rich living, and Richard married well, and by the time of the death of his grandson, another Richard, in 1679, they had built up some landholdings in Hanbury and the surrounding parishes. Richard Vernon (1615‚Äì79) studied in the Middle Temple, and may have practised as a lawyer in London in the civil war period, and in 1672 sent his eldest surviving son Thomas to study there as well, and he completed his legal studies in 1679 when he was called to the bar. When a student, Thomas was fortunate to have caught the eye of one of the leading chancery lawyers of the day, Sir Anthony Keck. Born in 1630, Keck had been called to the bar of the Inner Temple in 1659, and was elected a bencher (a member of the governing body) in 1677. On 4 March 1689 he was named a commissioner of the great seal with Sir John Maynard and Serjeant Rawlinson by the new King William III ‚Äì these commissioners replaced the notorious Lord Jefferys as Lord Chancellor, who fled as James II left the country. Knighted the next day, Keck held office till 14 May 1690. He also served as MP for Tiverton from 1691, and he died in his house in Bell Yard, off The Strand in December 1695. Keck died a very rich man, but he had to provide for no less than nine daughters, and on 5 January 1680 History of Parliament Online one of them, Mary, was married to the young Thomas Vernon. Chancery Lawyer Thomas and Mary had no children, and instead Thomas concentrated on his legal career. No doubt with the help of his father in law, he soon established himself as a successful lawyer in the court of chancery. The family's two residences in Hanbury ‚Äì Astwood and Spernall Hall ‚Äì were occupied by other members of the family, so Thomas and Mary spent their early years in London in his house at Bell Yard, opposite the entrance to the Middle Temple. But in 1692 his unmarried uncle John Vernon died in Spernall Hall, and from thence forth Thomas used it as his Hanbury residence. There is some evidence in the will of his uncle that rebuilding was already taking place, but it was not for another 10 years that Thomas Vernon started the main rebuilding campaign that resulted in building of Hanbury Hall, an elegant brick mansion that still stands today. Successful Chancery lawyers could command high fees, and Thomas Vernon was as successful as anyone in this field, and his success was also mirrored in the position in The Middle Temple. In 1703 he was elected a bencher, and in 1706 'reader' a post that by then had become mainly symbolic, but carried a great deal of prestige. Finally in 1717 he was elected treasurer for the year, effectively the leader of the Inn. Properties, investments and expenses Hanbury Hall Within five years of being called to the bar Vernon had enough spare money to start investing in property, and later in life he left a list of his purchases. These start in 1685 with properties in and around Hanbury as he tried to enlarge his existing family estates, but some were further afield. In 1700 the manor of Shrawley, a parish to the west of the county just across the River Severn, came up for sale by the Cliffe family, and after investigating the prospects, which included timber from Shrawley Great Wood of over , he managed to acquire it for ¬£13,000. Shrawley remained an important Vernon possession through to modern times, and the heir to the last member of the Vernon family lived in Shrawley Woodhouse till she died in 1980. Only two of Thomas's eight siblings married, and one was his sister Elizabeth who married another lawyer, Roger Acherley of the Inner Temple in 1692. Unlike Thomas Vernon, Acherley seems to have been in constant financial trouble, and in 1717 his brother in law paid him ¬£8,650 for an estate in Shropshire that he had bought earlier. But Thomas's greatest achievement was the building of Hanbury Hall. No building accounts survive and it is not even known who the architect was. A carved stone pediment above the main entrance has the date 1701, but this is believed to be a nineteenth-century addition, and a study of all the evidence leads to the conclusion that a completion date of around 1706 is more probable. For one thing, the extensive murals in the hall and staircase were painted by Sir James Thornhill and were completed in 1710 (as shown by a representation of Dr Sacheverell), and it seems unlikely that Vernon would have waited nine years to finish the interior decoration. Hanbury Hall was later criticized by the family friend Dr Treadway Nash as being of an outmoded form of architecture with many small rooms, and substantial alterations were undertaken inside by a later occupant Henry Cecil, who had married the heiress Emma Vernon in 1776. The main effect of these was to increase the size of the interior rooms, but the outside of the hall has been little altered, and is today very much like its original form over 300 years ago. Towards the end of his life Vernon boasted that he had kept a careful note of all his legal fees, and that these amounted to over ¬£120,000. But buying land was difficult in those days ‚Äì estates only came on the market if the owner's succession failed or if he was in financial difficulties, and on Thomas's death in February 1721 he left over ¬£20,000 in cash for his executors to buy land in and around Hanbury if and when it came available. MP for Worcestershire in 1715 and death in 1721 Thomas Vernon capped his career in 1715 by being elected Whig MP for Worcestershire in the first parliament of George I. But there is no evidence he played any significant role in parliament, probably because he continued his legal practice until his death in 1721. Estate left to Bowater Vernon In his will he left his second cousin Bowater Vernon as heir to his landed estates, but a dispute developed as his brother-in-law Roger Acherley felt that as his closest relative and heir at law he should have benefited. Acherley challenged Vernon's will on a number of counts, mainly on the basis of technical errors in the codicil which was drafted on Vernon's death bed. Although it is true that it was not well drafted (ironic in view of Vernon's career), the Court of Chancery dismissed the case on the grounds that the testator's wishes were clear even if there were some irregularities in the wording. But Acherley was reluctant to give up, and took the case to the House of Lords in 1726, but with a similar result, thus leaving Bowater Vernon free to enjoy his magnificent inheritance.

It can also be transliterated into the Filipino context as Babalik-balikan (\\"a place you‚Äôll keep going back to\\"). Legendary allusions Legends says that long time ago, the people living on the Magdiwata Mountain were turned into slaves by tribesmen from Agusan. These tribesmen were so cruel and did not treat the slaves humanely, forcing them to do very difficult tasks. Eventually, the slaves felt tired of their abusive masters, they planned on attaining their freedom. While they were rowing the gakit (bamboo raft), the slaves jumped into the water and forcefully pushed the gakit towards the waterfalls, consequently killing their masters, and ultimately attaining their freedom. This action of the slaves were planned, or intended, hence, the name of the waterfalls.

It has ultra restrictive membership, with well over a waiting period of over 50 years for prospective members. It is close to Delhi's top tourist sites of India Gate, Humayun's Tomb, Delhi Zoo, and Lodhi Gardens. DGC comprises 18-hole course which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and a shorter 9-hole course, and sprawling club house with swimming pool. History The original course, called the Lodhi Golf Club, laid out in the 1930s by the then Chief of the Horticultural Department, was much larger than the present walled area, and included parts of present Golf Links and Kaka Nagar. The Lodhi Golf Club, however, had few members, and was barely sustainable, except for a brief period during the Second World War when Delhi was awash with Allied officers who patronized the club. In 1948, the club had eighty members, and in 1951, when it became the Delhi Golf Club (DGC), its membership was no more than 120, and was barely sustainable. The Club was saved from dissolution by Indian officers belonging to the Indian Civil Service, including Dharma Vira, founder member of the DGC, who petitioned Prime Minister Nehru to lease the government land to the club at a low annual rent for thirty years. Since that time, the Government of India has favored the DGC with very permissive lease terms and low annual rents that have no relationship to the actual value of the land. The DGC has evolved as a favorite watering hole for senior Civil Servants, Police Officers and the business and social elite. The walled area of the club includes a large number of interesting Mughal archeological remains such as the famous Lal Bangla. Lal Bangla, tombs of Lal Kuwar, mother of Shah Alam II, and Begum Jaan his daughter, built c. 1780 Course The course comprises the championship 18-hole \\"Lodhi Course\\", which is part of the Asian PGA Tour, and the shorter 9-hole \\"Peacock Course\\". The latter came into being when the course was re- designed by Peter Thomson in 1976‚Äì77. The DGC hosts various tournaments and cups, such as the Indian Open. Subsidy The Delhi Golf Club has an area of 220 acres. The DGC club house, including the course, is on government land. In 2012, eight years before the lease was due for renewal, Kamal Nath, the Minister of Urban Development in the United Progressive Alliance government, approved extension of the lease until 2050. Delhi golf Club pool Management Committee The DGC management committee consists of a President, a Course Captain and twelve general committee members, excluding government nominated members. Posts on the management committee are filled through election. These are usually held in September. President Maj. Ravinder Singh Bedi (Retd) has been appointed as president for 2019‚Äì2020. Captain Mr. Rohit Sabherwal, FCA has been appointed as captain for 2019‚Äì2020. Club Amenities The DGC has a large bungalow style club house with extensive lawns, gazebos, several indoor and outdoor bars, restaurants, a gym, a sauna, a pro shop and a large parking designated area. Air Quality The DGC, despite its many acres, has not escaped Delhi's poor air quality. In the evening illumination, as well as the early morning sun, \\"the shroud of carcinogenic particles hovering above the bunkers and greens\\" are very visible.  Allegations of racism and elitism  In June 2017, a woman named Tailin Lyngdoh, a Khasi, had gone to the Club along with her employer Nivedita Barthakur after they were invited for lunch by a member of the Club. However, 15‚Äì20 minutes into the lunch, two Club officials asked Lyngdoh to leave the table saying the dress (Jainsem) she was wearing was a \\"maid's uniform\\" which looked like a \\"dustbin\\" and also allegedly hurled racial abuse at her. This incident was widely covered in the Indian media condemning the classism attitude of the Delhi Golf Club and elite clubs of India in general.

Closure  Hailed as part of the cultural identity of the city and lauded as being one of the city's best known independent music stores, its closure after eleven years of existence as part of the global credit crunch in early 2009 came to the attention of the national media when its owner, Dave Kennedy, highlighted the difficulties facing his store and the music industry in general on the store's website, difficulties which included being priced out of the market, the rise of illegal file sharing on the internet, the changing leisure pursuits of modern teenagers, the spiralling costs of running a business in Ireland and the rapid decrease in the number of people visiting Dublin. Kennedy stated: > We don't see any young people in the shop any more; so as we lose older > customers, we don't gain any new ones. The store was a popular topic amongst the Irish blogging community and its closure was greeted with posts expressing much disappointment. ThrillPier's blog had the post: \\"Road was the place to go for decent indie stuff. I especially loved the photos from local gigs that were up on the walls. Everyone from the White Horse generation of punk/indie fans will lament the passing of this great shop. Where will I get my Burning Love Jumpsuit CDs now?\\". Hot Press praised Road's willingness to sell the sort of music \\"not readily available\\" in other stores, describing it as \\"a much-loved fixture\\" in the Dublin music scene. The Irish Times described Road Records as \\"to Irish independent music what Richard and Judy are to new authors\\", referencing the British television presenters' renowned bookclub and pointing out that, even after having won an Academy Award, Glen Hansard regularly visited the store when he was at home in Dublin.  Relaunch  Road Records relaunched on 18 April 2009 following assistance from the Irish music community. Irish musicians, Paul Noonan, Lisa Hannigan, Conor O'Brien of Villagers, Neil Hannon and Jape, played acoustic sets at the reopening of the store.  Second Closure  On 16 July 2010, it was announced that Road Records would close again, this time for good. Despite the support received, business was still failing. All records were sold at 25% off and other store items such as cash registers and turntables were put up for sale. The shop closed its doors on 24 July 2010.

It was founded in 1987. Wish's mission is to provide long- term, gender-sensitive support and services to women with mental health needs in their journey through the prison and secure hospital system and into the community, and to make women's voices heard at policy level. It has two regional offices. The head office is based in London and serves the London and South region. The second office is based in Liverpool and serves the North and Midlands region, including Wales. Wish is a member led organisation and offers free membership to women with personal experience of mental distress, or of the mental health or prison system. The charity currently works with over 1000 women, but is building organisational capacity to reach the estimated 3000 women who are currently detained within the secure psychiatric system.  History  Wish is a national charity that was founded in 1987 by Prue Stevenson, Terri Simpson and Kimberley Andrews. At the time, Prue was working in the Education Department at HMP Holloway in London. She became concerned about the high number of women whose mental health deteriorated to such an extent that they were transferred to the High Secure Hospitals, then known as Special Hospitals (Broadmoor Hospital, Rampton Secure Hospital and Ashworth Hospital). Terri and Kim were former patients who had spent many years in High Secure hospitals. Female patients in these hospitals were often subjected to appalling and degrading conditions, and many didn't require such a high level of security. The three women got together to form Wish with the aim of supporting women still in Special Hospitals and prison psychiatric units, and to campaign to change policy and attitudes. The charity was originally called Women in Special Hospitals and Prison Psychiatric Units. This was later shortened to Women in Secure Hospitals as the charity moved towards supporting women in medium and low secure units as well as the three High Secure Hospitals. In 2008 following a consultation with members, the charity changed its name to Wish, with the tagline A voice for women's mental health to reflect its status as the only national organisation for women's mental health and its increasing work with women in the community. The first office was based in London, initially serving Broadmoor and HMP Holloway, and over time branches were set up in the Midlands to serve Rampton and in the North to serve Ashworth. The women's services at Ashworth and Broadmoor have since closed, resulting in more women being moved to lower, more appropriate, levels of security. Wish's work to emphasise the importance of gender and the different needs of women contributed to the Department of Health strategy for women's mental health, titled Into the Mainstream. Today, Wish works with women at all levels of security, as well as in prisons and in the community. Over two decades after it was founded, Wish is now returning to its campaigning roots, as well as continuing to provide independent advocacy and emotional support to women with mental health needs in secure settings and in the community.

Overview After a childhood in the provinces, he became an engineering fitter. He entered the seminary of Saint Sulpice in Issy-les-Moulineaux in 1933. After military service in Lebanon he travelled throughout the Middle East, to Syria, Palestine, Egypt and Iraq. He was ordained as a priest in 1939, and then mobilized. Imprisoned in 1940, he met Andr√© Malraux, Claude Gallimard and Roger Judrin during his captivity in Pomerania and Brandenburg, companions who remained close friends for the rest of his life. It was in the \\"Metamorphoses\\" by Jean Paulhan, published by Gallimard in 1946, that the first of his works appeared, 'Terre du temps ', a series of poetic notes. Remaining faithful to his publisher, he participated very actively in the life of the Nouvelle Revue francaise with Marcel Arland, Dominique Aury and later Georges Lambrichs. In 1950, he left the priesthood, married and bought a property at Avant-l√®s- Marcilly, in the Aube, where he spent most of his time. He now found himself working mostly on translations of Aeschylus and Sophocles, Shakespeare, the Koran and the Bible.

He is best known for his controversial writings, some of which were signed Tilenus, after Daniel Tilenus, expressing his hostility to Calvinism in general, and the Synod of Dort in particular. Biography=Background Lawrence Womack, a namesake of his grandfather, was born 12 May 1612 at Lopham,There are two places called Lopham in Norfolk: North Lopham and South Lopham. They are next to each other, and it is unclear which one was his birthplace. Norfolk, England where his father, Charles Womack, was rector. Lawrence's brother William became estranged from the family and emigrated to Virginia, United States of America in the 1630s where he became a Quaker. Education Lawrence graduated B.A. from Corpus Christi College, Cambridge in 1632, and M.A. in 1636. He became chaplain to William Paget, 5th Baron Paget.Christopher Durston, By the book or with the spirit: the debate over liturgical prayer during the English Revolution, Historical Research Volume 79 Issue 203, Pages 50 ‚Äì 73; Published Online: 13 Jan 2006.Concise Dictionary of National Biography Ecclesiastical career Lawrence had a benefice (an office endowed with fixed capital assets that provide a living through the revenue from such assets) in the west of England, where he attained fame by his preaching. He was published by the royalist printer Richard Royston. Along with Thomas Pierce and Jeremy Taylor, he was one of the Arminian clerics attacked by Edward Bagshaw the younger and Henry Hickman.Nicholas Tyacke, Religious Controversy, p. 599 in Trevor Henry Aston, Nicholas Tyacke (editors), The History of the University of Oxford: Volume IV: Seventeenth- Century Oxford (1984). Period of relative obscurity Little is known of him from 1648 to 1660. This corresponds to a revolutionary period in England that included the overthrow of the monarchy, the outbreak of the Second English Civil War in 1648, followed by the execution of King Charles I in 1649, and the short-lived Commonwealth of England. A political crisis that followed the death of Cromwell in 1658 resulted in the restoration of the monarchy. King Charles II restored the crown in 1660. Charles's English parliament enacted laws known as the Clarendon Code, designed to shore up the position of the re-established Church of England. Further enhancement of career At this point, Lawrence Womack returned to prominence, and obtained a prebend (a stipend drawn from the endowment or revenues of an Anglican cathedral or church by a presiding member of the clergy) in Hereford Cathedral in 1660. On the Restoration of 1660 he was made Archdeacon of Suffolk on Dec. 8th, Prebendary of Ely, and Doctor of Divinity in 1661. Like his grandfather of the same name, Lawrence Womack was a Rector in the Church of England and in 1683 was consecrated Bishop of St. David's. He was noted for his publications supporting the liturgy and was known for having a fine collection of books. He replied to Edmund Calamy's 1662 sermon Eli trembling for fear of the Ark. He became Bishop of St David's in 1683. Marriage and family Lawrence was married three times. By his first marriage, Lawrence had at least one son, Edward. The second marriage, in West Bradford, Nov. 18, 1668, to Anne, daughter of John Hill and widow of Edward Alymer, of Claydon County, Suffolk. Ann was buried at Horringer Suffolk, 1669. Next he married at Brideford on 18 November 1668 a woman called Anne Aylmer of Bury and they had a daughter, Anne, who died in 1685. Third marriage, at St. Bartholomew, the Less, London, on April 25, 1670, was to Katherine Corbett, of Norwick, aged 40. She was still living in 1697. Lawrence Womack and Katherine Corbett had a son named John Richard Womack born in 1670 in Suffolk, England. John Richard Womack migrated to America and died in 1738 in Prince Edward County, Virginia. Death and memorial Lawrence Womack died in Westminster, March 12, 1686; buried at St. Margaret's Church, London, where there is a tablet to his memory. The Anglican church of St. Margaret is situated in the grounds of Westminster Abbey on Parliament Square next to the ‚ÄúBig Ben‚Äù clock tower, and is known affectionately as the parish church of the Houses of Commons. When Elizabeth I re-founded the Abbey as a collegiate church in 1560 she maintained its exemption from episcopal authority and made her new foundation a ‚Äòroyal peculiar‚Äô, subject to the authority of the Sovereign as Visitor. Lawrence left his books and property to his nephew, Lawrence Womack, Rector of Castor, of Yarmouth. Fraudulent Genealogy Lawrence Womack has been cited as an ancestor or relative in multiple fraudulent or fantasy genealogies. These fraudulent genealogies seek to link Lawrence Womack to the Womack family that lived in Colonial Virginia. There is no evidence that Lawrence Womack had any children who survived him, or that any of his relatives emigrated to Virginia.

Early career Mars joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1932, and was assigned to the cruiser . Promoted to midshipman in 1933, he was further promoted to acting sub-lieutenant in January 1936. In December he was appointed to the submarine HMS Grampus which was then building, and in April 1937 to HMS Swordfish. He was promoted to lieutenant on his assignment to HMS Medway, the submarine depot ship of the China Station. In April 1938 he has appointed to HMS Regulus. World War II After spending a short period on HMS H44, in November 1941 Mars was appointed as commanding officer of HMS Unbroken, which he served on until June 1943 on operations in the Mediterranean. From August 1943 until December 1943 he was a staff officer at HMS Dolphin submarine base in Portsmouth. In December he was placed in command of HMS Thule in the Far East, remaining there until November 1945. Postwar After the war Mars was posted 1946 to HMS Dolphin but was eventually assigned to a post in New Zealand, where Mars' pay of $39 per week as a lieutenant commander proved inadequate to support him, his wife and his two children.

He was ordered to report to Portsmouth but he wrote from his home in London to the Navy refusing to do so and requesting his retirement. He commented in his letter that \\"I do not wish to plague My Lords with a mass of detail mainly repugnant to them. It should be sufficient to say that I have lost faith in the present governmental hierarchy and all that goes with it\\".

A two child policy has previously been used in several countries including Iran, Singapore, and Vietnam. In British Hong Kong in the 1970s, citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit (although it was not mandated by law), and it was used as part of the region's family planning strategies. Since 2016, it has been re-implemented in China, replacing the country's previous one-child policy. East Asia= British Hong Kong  In British Hong Kong, the Eugenics League was founded in 1936, which became The Family Planning Association of Hong Kong in 1950.History of the Family Planning Association of Hong Kong The organization provides family planning advice, sex education, and birth control services to the general public of Hong Kong. In the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population, it launched the \\"Two is Enough\\" campaign, which reduced the general birth rate through educational means. The organizationHistory of International Planned Parenthood Federation founded the International Planned Parenthood Federation, with its counterparts in seven other countries. The total fertility rate in Hong Kong is currently 1.04 children per woman, one of the lowest in the world. Although the \\"Two is Enough\\" campaign found widespread approval, it does not reflect current government policy in supporting families. Tax allowances of 100,000 HK$ per child can be claimed for up to 9 children. Furthermore, parents who have fallen into hardship can apply for special assistance from the state. This is a means-tested financial benefit, which is not limited to a particular number of children either.  China (mainland)  During the 1970s, Chinese citizens were permitted to have only one child. The ongoing Cultural Revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors. During this time, the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3. (The colloquial term \\"births per woman\\" is usually formalized as the Total Fertility Rate (TFR), a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime.) As China's youngest generation (born under the one-child policy, which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979) came of age for formation of the next generation, a single child would be left with having to provide support for their two parents and four grandparents. In response to this issue, by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves. After a policy change of the Chinese government in late 2013, most Chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child. Han Chinese living in rural areas were often permitted to have two children, as exceptions existed if the first child was a daughter. Because of cases such as these, as well as urban couples who simply paid a fine (or \\"social maintenance fee\\") to have more children,\\"New rich challenge family planning policy .\\" Xinhua. the overall fertility rate of mainland China is, in fact, closer to two children per family than to one child per family (1.8). In addition, since 2012, Han Chinese in southern Xinjiang were allowed to have two children. This, along with incentives and restrictions against higher Muslim Uyghur fertility, was seen as attempt to counter the threat of Uyghur separatism. On 29 October 2015, Xinhua reported the change in the existing law to a two-child policy citing a statement from the Communist Party of China. The new policy allowing Chinese couples to have two children was proposed in order to help address the aging issue in China. On 27 December 2015, the new law was passed in the session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, which governs country's laws, effective from 1 January 2016. In 2018, about two years after the new policy reform, China is facing new ramifications from the two-child policy. Since the revision of the one-child policy, 90 million women have become eligible to have a second child. According to The Economist, the new two-child policy may have negative implications on gender roles, with new expectations for women to bear more children and to abandon their careers. After the reform, China saw a short-lived boost in fertility rate for 2016. Chinese women gave birth to 17.9 million babies in 2016 (a record value in the 21st century), but the number of births declined by 3.5% to 17.2 million in 2017, and to 15.2 million in 2018.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/china-debate-over- shrinking-birth-rate-highlights-growth-concern In China, men still have greater marital power, which increases fertility pressure on their female partners. The dynamic of relationships (amount of \\"power\\" held by each parent), and the amount of resources each parent has contributes to the struggle for dominance. Resources would be items such as income, and health insurance. Dominance would be described as who has the final say in pregnancy, who has to resign in their career for maternal/parental leave. However, women have shown interest in a second child if the first child did not possess the desired gender. Chinese couples were also polled and stated that they would rather invest in one child opposed to two children. To add, another concern for couples would be the high costs of raising another child; China's childcare system needs to be furthered developed. The change in cultural norms appears to be having negative consequences and leads to fear of a large aging population with smaller younger generations; thus the lack of workforce to drive the economy. In May 2018, it was reported that Chinese authorities were in the process of ending their population control policies. Europe=United Kingdom In October 2012, the Conservative Party's proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a 'two-child policy', and has been fronted by the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and former leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith. In April 2015, David Cameron denied any such plans to cut child benefits or tax credits. However, three months later, George Osborne, the then Finance Minister, announced that child tax credits would be limited to the first two children only. This was to come into force from the 2017/2018 financial year and apply to children born after that date only. From February 2019 however the policy becomes retrospective. Families making a new benefit claim (or whose circumstances change) will have the 2-child policy applied to them irrespective of when their children were born. The two-child policy took effect on 5 April 2017. One particular aspect of the new rules, termed the \\"rape clause\\" \\"rape clause\\"/ What is the rape clause?, October 9, 2019 has caused controversy. Although the policy excludes all but the first two children from all available benefits, an exemption can be applied for if the conception of the third and any further children occurred as a result of the rape of the claimant. A woman wishing to claim this exemption must fill in an eight-page form: > \\"The form requires women wanting to be eligible for the exemption to sign a > declaration saying they were raped or otherwise coerced into sex ‚Äì and > giving the child‚Äôs name. They must sign a declaration reading: 'I believe > the non-consensual conception exemption applies to my child.' They must also > sign another declaration that says: 'I confirm that I am not living with the > other parent of this child.'\\" That the woman must thereby identify the child in question (which is thought to be assigned a tax code created for this exemption), that first or second children conceived by rape do not count towards this exemption and that women who are still living with their abusers are not eligible are just some of the aspects of the rape clause that caused widespread condemnation. Ruth Graham, writing for Slate, summarises the issues surrounding this new policy thus: > \\"The policy and the exemption have received harsh criticism from a wide > variety of sources since they were announced in 2015. One member of > parliament called the exemption implementation 'inhumane and barbaric.' > Feminists have pointed out the cuts disproportionately affect women. A > coalition of the U.K.‚Äôs largest Christian denominations and Jewish groups > pointed out that the policy discriminates against people whose religion > compels them to have larger families. A United Nations committee on > children‚Äôs rights asked the British government to explain the policy last > year, because of concerns about women having to somehow prove they were > raped.\\" South Asia= India  In 2019, Assam state introduced a policy whereby those having more than two children ineligible for government jobs. Seven states ‚Äî Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand ‚Äî have laws barring couples with more than two children from contesting local body elections. Southeast Asia=Singapore In Singapore, the two-child policy until the 1980s was called \\"Stop at Two\\". Vietnam Vietnam has had a population policy for over 50 years. It was launched by the Vietnamese government in the early 1960s in North Vietnam and continues in a modified form today, throughout all of Vietnam (not just the north). The policy emphasizes the official family-size goal to be m·ªôt ho·∫∑c hai con, which means \\"one or two children.\\" In 2014, Vietnam had an estimated population of 92.5 million people, which represented 1.28% of the total world population. Currently, the total fertility rate of Vietnam is 1.8 (births per woman), which is below the replacement-level fertility of 2.1, the rate \\"at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next\\" according to the World Resources Institute. =History= From 1954 to 1975, Vietnam was split into North and South Vietnam along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region. North Vietnam became the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and had a communist government, whereas South Vietnam became the Republic of Vietnam and was more aligned with the United States and other Western nations. In 1963, North Vietnam began a policy advocating a two-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population. Vietnam's family planning policy was developed before those of other countries, such as China and India. The government used a system of information, education, communication (IEC) campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population. After the reunification of North and South Vietnam in 1975 under the Communist Party, there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the North to the rest of Vietnam, which extended into the next decade. Though the government of the Republic of Vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy, inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented. In 1982, the Vietnam government practiced various family planning measures, including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the National Committee for Population and Family Planning. After 1983, each family was required to limit the number of children to two. In 1985, the government increased incentives, such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors, and disincentives, such as penalties for violations in family planning. In 1986, the Party implemented the Renovation (ƒê·ªïi M·ªõi) Policy, which completely reversed the Communist Party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals. The aims of the Renovation Policy were to end Vietnam's economic isolation, increase competitiveness, and raise living standards. In an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population, the Vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates. In 1988, Council of Ministers issued an in-depth family planning policy, adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two. The detailed one-or-two-child policy of Vietnam was established nine years after China's one-child policy was implemented, and elements of China's policy are reflected in Vietnam's, such as the emphasis on marrying later, postponing childbearing age (22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men), and spacing out birth of children (3‚Äì5 years apart). The state was required to supply free birth control devices (such as intrauterine loops, condoms, and birth control pills) and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions. Furthermore, if families did not comply with the two-child policy, they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers. In 1993, the Vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified Vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy. The policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family \\"so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life.\\" The Vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with \\"historical and cultural traditions, value structures and development objectives,\\" encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own. The goal of the policy was to reduce the Vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1 by 2015, so that the country could have a stable population in the mid-21st century. In 1997, the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005, and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth. In 2003, the Standing Parliamentary Committee of the National Assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the Population Ordinance, which restructured the official family planning policy. According to the ordinance, couples \\"shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies, the number of children and the duration between child births.\\" However, shortly after, the government implemented the National Strategy on Population 2001-2010, which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005. This caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights. To address this confusion, the government issued Resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that \\"to sustain high economic growth, Viet Nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country.\\" However at this time, the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level. In 2009, the Population Ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children, although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births. The government is currently drafting a new Law on Population to replace the Population Ordinance in 2015. However, there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law. =Administration= The organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s. As the policy evolved from \\"Initiation in the 1960s‚Äì1970s; Maturity in the 1980s‚Äì1990s; and Legalization in the 2000s‚Äì2010s\\", the administration of the population policy also changed. From 1961-1983, the population program fell under the Population and Birth Control Unit. From 1984‚Äì2002, it was under the control of National Committee for Population and Family Planning. From 2003‚Äì2006, it was in the jurisdiction of the Vietnam Commission for Population, Family and Children. Since 2007, the population program has been under the General Office for Population and Family Planning. Although the policy was advocated on the national level, the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives, instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments. Each family was required to have at most two children, and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement. Depending on the specific location, district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice, equivalent to the worth of a month to a year's wages, for each additional child, and additionally, women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice. Individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them, whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the Labor Medal for \\"good realization of the population ‚Äì family planning program\\". The government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries, promotions, and sometimes even their jobs. =Current status= Currently, the effective population policy is the revised 2009 Population Ordinance which states that \\"each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning, reproductive health care: (i) decide time and birth spacing; (ii) have one or two children, exceptional cases to be determined by the Government.\\" Thus, individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have. Furthermore, later that year, Chief Executive Tr∆∞∆°ng T·∫•n San stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of Vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020, and suggested that a new comprehensive Law on Population be introduced to the government by 2015. =Effects of this policyReduction of the birthrate The total fertility rate in Vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993, suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth. According to one demographic model, the Bongaarts' model of components of fertility, high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate. Furthermore, because of this policy, the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family. In 1988, the Inter-Censal Demographic and Health Survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children, and in 1994, they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8. However, the reported findings differ depending on the fertility model utilized and on the particular research study cited. The United Nations Economic and Social Council for Asia and the Pacific found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998. In another study conducted by the America-based non-profit, non-governmental organization Population Reference Bureau, the number found was lower at 2.3. Another study, published in the Worldwide State of the Family in 1995 by Tran Xuan Nhi, found a contrasting finding that the total fertility rate only dropped slightly and the size of nuclear families experienced only a slight change, dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994. Sex-based differences There is evidence that son preference exists in Vietnam. Traditionally, men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises, managing agriculture, ancestral worship, and carrying on the family name. However, although the desire for a son is seen in the Vietnamese family's fertility practices, the desire for more than one son is not. Families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son, presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy. Furthermore, women who do not have any sons are around 15% less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one. There were also increased rates of \\"contraceptive failure\\" amongst couples who had a son, as families secretly removed an IUD to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son. This is consistent with findings from other East Asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line. Despite the evidence for son preference, there is no clear evidence that Vietnam's sex ratio at birth is increasing, as seen in other East Asian countries, notably China, though evidence is conflicting depending on the source. In fact, according to the Vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999, the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing. On the other hand, some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of Vietnam. In the north, there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births, while in the south, this relationship is nonexistent. However, mothers who pursue certain occupations, such as government cadres and farmers, are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth. This reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit, and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm. = CriticismInadequate contraceptives Although the policy states that \\"the state will supply, free of charge, birth control devices... to eligible persons who are cadres, manual workers, civil servants or members of the armed forces... and poor persons who register to practice family planning... The widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them,\\" the only modern contraceptive readily available in Vietnam is the IUD. However, many women choose not to use it due to the side effects, such as increased bleeding, back and abdominal pains, headache, and general weakness. Thus, contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25, and experts have speculated that \\"contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary, easy-to-use methods, such as the pill and the condom, were more accessible. For the government to achieve its two-child policy, the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill, and strengthening of the government family planning program.\\" Increased abortion Abortion rates in Vietnam are unusually high by international standards, with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman. Generally, the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability. Individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates. Vietnam also has some of the world's most liberal abortion laws, though the Vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties. Although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006, there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions, as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son. There are multiple factors influencing Vietnam's high abortion rates. First, because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides IUDs, whilst condoms remain expensive relative to average income, as a result many do not use effective birth control. Women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives, such as condoms and contraceptive pills, which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access. Secondly, due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of Vietnam, abortions have become more acceptable. Furthermore, the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy, and subsequently increased abortion services. Additionally, the Vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families.

In 2007, she participated in the Miss Bikini International contest. In the same year she participated in the Face Of The Universe held in South Africa and won the title for the fourth most beautiful face in the world. She was also a finalist in the Brazilian stage of the Miss World 2008 beauty pageant and won fourth place. Bridi became ill in December 2008, initially suspected of having kidney stones. By early January, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that worsened to become septic shock caused by a bacterial infection, probably Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a difficult pathogen to treat because of its resistance to many antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an unusual agent to cause a urinary tract infection which appeared to have caused the sepsis. Later in January, her sepsis worsened, causing tissue necrosis in her feet and hands, which were then amputated in an attempt to save her life. A part of her stomach was later removed during her final surgery.  Death  She died on the morning of January 24, 2009, in a hospital in Esp√≠rito Santo as a result of complications from necrotic sepsis resulting from the original infection. The cause of death according to the hospital certificate was a severe sepsis, urinary infection and abdominal bleeding which led to the failure of multiple organs.

Members were Bret McKenzie, Jemaine Clement, Taika Waititi, actor Carey Smith and theatre director David Lawrence. They met as members of the Drama Club at Victoria University of Wellington, (where Clement, Waititi and Lawrence were studying theatre and film, and McKenzie classics and music) and first appeared as a quintet in a segment of a show called 'Bodyplay', conceived and directed by Duncan Sarkies. 'So You're A Man' premiered at the Basement Theatre in Auckland in May 1996, played a sell-out season at BATS Theatre in Wellington in October/November 1996, and then a month at the Last Laugh in Melbourne, Australia in March/April 1997, with one- off performances and university Orientation gigs in between. The show was a 1950s-style mockumentary guide to coping with manhood, covering such topics as proper urinal etiquette, interactions with women, facial hair, personal grooming and how to find the clitoris. The five actors performed in flesh- coloured 'nudie-suits' and all played the guitar. This group was a precursor to both The Humourbeasts and Flight of the Conchords.

Filming began on July 6, 2008 and ended on July 27, 2008. The film spent several months without a distributor before being picked up by New Line Cinema and having a limited U.S. release on November 6, 2009. The film was released on DVD on March 9, 2010. Plot The nine characters are revealed to be: 1 ‚Äî a petty criminal (Christian), 2 ‚Äî a police officer (Jackson), 3 ‚Äî an illegal gun seller (Leon), 4 ‚Äî a strip club owner and loan shark (Sully), 5 ‚Äî an Assistant District Attorney for LA County (Kelley), 6 ‚Äî a pedophile and rapist (Coogan), 7 ‚Äî a priest (Father Francis), 8 ‚Äî a health insurance executive (Eddie), and 9 ‚Äî a Chinese store owner who does not know English (Nhung Chan). After a string of kidnappings, these nine people are locked inside a room and handcuffed to pipes. Then a masked man enters and explains each of them are there for a reason, and to survive, they must figure out how they are all connected. He further explains that he will kill one of them every ten minutes until they figure it out. The shooter leaves and a countdown begins. The group begins introducing themselves, and a few early connections are made. Christian says he once borrowed money from Sully, but paid it back. Coogan mentions he has been in multiple prisons. Kelley and Jackson are former lovers. Just as the group begins to think it is all a hoax, the shooter enters and kills Christian. After the masked man leaves, Leon has Sully stomp on his hand until it breaks, freeing himself from his handcuffs. He attempts to escape, but is caught and brought back by the shooter. The shooter then kills Coogan, who has mentioned earlier that he is dying anyway. Before he shoots him he whispers the reason in Coogan's ear. Then Coogan attacks the masked man and is shot. The shooter tells Leon he will be the next to die. With seven people left, Mrs. Chan recognizes Kelley as her former lawyer after Mrs. Chan's store was robbed two years earlier. The group begins to see connections between themselves and the robber, Wade Greeley. The shooter returns, but as the seven only know part of the story, he shoots Leon. With the theory in doubt, it becomes clear that Father Francis knows more than he is admitting, but refuses to give further information. Eventually, it is determined that Greeley did not rob the store; the real robber, Christian, confessed to Father Francis that he committed the robbery in order to gain enough money to pay back Sully. However, when shown a line-up, Mrs. Chan mistakenly identified Greeley as the robber, and Kelley prosecuted him. At this point, the shooter reenters, and since not all of the connections have been established, he tries to kill Eddie, but Father Francis puts himself in the path of the bullet and is killed instead. When Kelley calls him Wade, he denies being Wade Greeley and leaves. Once the shooter leaves, Sully realizes that before Christian robbed Mrs. Chan's store, he didn't have a gun, and must have bought one from Leon. The shooter enters and targets Mrs. Chan; instead of whispering the reason to her he hands her a note written in Chinese. She pleads with him in Chinese (presumably revealing the father-son relationship between the Shooter and Wade Greeley to viewers who understand Chinese) before he shoots her. Kelley begs to be let go to be with her son, but the shooter is visibly angry Kelley used her son as an excuse, and leaves, but not before hinting Jackson is the father of Kelley's baby. Kelley confirms that Jackson is the father of her son, and also reveals she fabricated evidence to convict Greeley, saying she needed to win a case after many losses. She also reveals that Jackson unknowingly helped her falsify evidence, and that she once murdered a man who raped her, and swept it under the rug when the man's body was found. Eddie realizes the shooter must be Greeley's father, exacting revenge, and the remaining four begin to wonder what happened to Greeley after he went to prison. The shooter returns and kills Sully, who has no regret for his actions. With only Kelley, Jackson, and Eddie left, the three struggle to establish connections for Eddie and Coogan. Eddie supposes that Coogan was earlier referring to being infected with AIDS (since he mentioned the others being harmed by \\"blood splatter\\"), and, as he has been in multiple prisons, could have raped Greeley and infected him. Then the final connection is made; Greeley applied for an experimental drug treatment (run by Eddie's company) for HIV, but Eddie would have had to reject him due to his criminal conviction. They explain this to the shooter, Greeley's father, who removes his mask and agrees to let them all go. Kelley is released, but, having slowly revealed her true nature, steals the shooter's gun and shoots Greeley's father, Eddie, and Jackson. Greeley's father, who was wearing a kevlar vest, recovers momentarily to reveal that the whole time \\"everybody has been watching\\" and that they now know \\"who the real Kelley Murphy is\\". He is then shot in the head, and Kelley escapes as the police arrive. CastRelease The first stills from the film were released onto the film's official MySpace page on August 17, 2008.

Design and development The Short Type 320 was designed to meet an official requirement for a seaplane to carry a Mark IX torpedo. It was larger than the earlier Short 184, and was a typical Short folder design of the time, with two-bay uneven span wings. Two prototypes were built, powered by a 310 hp Sunbeam Cossack engine, and initially known as the Short 310 Type A from the engine fitted to the prototypes. When the torpedo bomber went into production, it was powered by a 320 hp (238 kW) Cossack engine which was the origin of the name, Type 320.Bruce Flight 28 December 1956, p. 1002 At the same time as Shorts was designing the 310 Type A torpedo bomber, it produced a similar design for a patrol floatplane, powered by the same Cossack engine and using the same fuselage, but with equal-span three-bay wings, instead of the uneven- span wings of the torpedo bomber, known as the Short 310 Type B or North Sea Scout, and two prototypes were ordered.Barnes 1967, p. 130Bruce, British Aeroplanes 1914‚Äì18, pp. 502‚Äì503 Priority was given to the torpedo bomber; the first was ready in July 1916, the second in August that year, and the prototypes were rushed to the Adriatic.Barnes 1967, pp. 130‚Äì131 In September 1916, the first prototype patrol aircraft was finished, but it proved to be little better than the Short 184 already in service, and was not ordered into production.Barnes 1967, p. 133 The second prototype, Type B, was completed as a type A torpedo bomber.Barnes 1967, p. 132 As with conventional biplane floatplanes, the torpedo was carried between the bottom of the fuselage and the floats. Unusually, the aircraft was flown from the rear cockpit, although this did cause a problem for an observer in the front seat. The observer had to stand on the coaming to use the machine-gun, which was level with the top wing. When a torpedo was carried, the aircraft could not fly with an observer at the same time.Bruce Flight 28 December 1956, p. 1003 The first order placed with Shorts was for 30 aircraft, followed by orders for a further 24 and 20 aircraft, together with orders for a further 30 and 20 placed at Sunbeam. Together with the three prototypes, this gave a total production of 127 Short Type 320s.Barnes 1967, pp. 132‚Äì133 Operational history In February 1917, 25 aircraft were ordered, and before the end of April 1917, examples were delivered to the Royal Naval Air Service in Italy. Two accidents with the aircraft, when the fuselage collapsed after the torpedo was released, delayed its use on operations. The cause was later found to be the method of securing the fuselage bracing wires. The first operational use was on 2 September 1917, when six aircraft (five with torpedoes and one with bombs) were towed on rafts fifty miles south of Traste Bay to enable them to attack enemy submarines lying off Cattaro. They had to be towed into position as they could not carry enough fuel with a torpedo for the mission. The operation did not go well; with a gale-force wind and heavy seas, two of the aircraft failed to take off, so the operation was abandoned. On the return journey, one aircraft was lost and the others were damaged. It appears that the Type 320 never launched a torpedo in action. In February 1918, due to the lack of operational experience, four aircraft were operated from Calshot for experiments with launching the torpedoes. Forty drops were made, and proved a valuable source of information about torpedoes entering the water when dropped at different heights and speeds. The aircraft continued to be used as reconnaissance seaplanes until the end of the war.

Presented by comedian Jack Docherty the programme was one of the first to air on the channel, doing so as part of its opening night schedule on 30 March 1997. The show was recorded at London's Whitehall Theatre during the early evening and would then be broadcast in a late-night slot. It featured a mixture of chat with celebrity guests, comedy, and music, and followed a similar format to shows such as NBC's Late Night with David Letterman in the United States. Accompanying Docherty and guests was a house band, whose line-up changed from time to time. It was first briefly led by Pete Baikie, followed a few weeks later by Richard Allen. They named the studio band Pete Baikie and the Peetles and Richard Allen and the Allenoids respectively. In September 1997 a new house band, Blair, fronted by Blair MacKichan took over the role and remained until the house band was dispensed with some time in 1998. MacKichan was better known for his appearance in the Oxo adverts during the 1980s, although he was also an accomplished musician. Docherty was frequently absent from the programme, usually during school holidays, and when this happened the show was retitled Not The Jack Docherty Show and would be presented by a stand-in. Guest presenters included Phill Jupitus, Graham Norton, Fred MacAulay, Carol McGiffin, Melinda Messenger, Rich Hall and Tim Vine. The role of guest host helped to launch Graham Norton's television career, and won him the award for best newcomer at the 1997 British Comedy Awards. Docherty ‚Äì who was also attending the ceremony ‚Äì had expected to win the award himself. Norton went on to front his own series on Channel 4 in 1998 titled So Graham Norton. Channel 5 had originally wanted to call the show The Docherty Will See You Now, and when first on air it was broadcast five nights a week. However, as the series progressed numbers of episodes were reduced as the channel moved away from its original \\"stripped and stranded\\" scheduling format, and, in the first instance, because Docherty had requested that he do fewer shows. From September 1997 it dropped to four nights a week when the Friday edition was withdrawn from the schedule, then three in March 1998 after Monday's episode was also dropped. By September 1998 the series dropped to a Tuesday and Thursday airing, while the Wednesday slot was then taken up with the somewhat similar Melinda's Big Night In, a chat show hosted by Melinda Messenger. One weekly episode of The Jack Docherty Show was aired during its last few months, before the final edition went out on 23 June 1999. The decreasing number of weekly editions also had much to do with the show's poor viewing figures. Often these would be higher when Docherty was absent, with model Melinda Messenger achieving higher viewing figures when she stood in for him. The show was also panned by critics, particularly when, in 1998, Docherty decided not to renew his contract with Channel 5 when it expired at the end of that year. In November 1998 a television reviewer in The Independent observed: \\"In effect, The Jack Docherty Show (C5, Tue and Thur) is working out its notice. And boy, does it show. It's as if Docherty is perfunctorily doing his job even as the removal men are dismantling the show and packing it off to the archive. The house band has gone, the flats of the set have been taken down, and the script has been stowed at the bottom of a cardboard box file.\\" This sentiment was echoed in the 19 February 1999 edition of Private Eye, which claimed that Docherty had closed one episode with the words, \\"In line with Channel 5 policy, it's past eleven o'clock and time for some tatty pornography\\", and had then simulated fellatio on a pizza salesman. The scene was edited out before broadcast in what Private Eye suggested was a decision influenced by criticism of Channel 5, which at the time included soft-core pornography in its schedule. In January 2010, The Guardian's Sam Leith wrote that The Jack Docherty Show had \\"died a death\\", musing: \\"I'm not sure even Jack Docherty remembers it very well.\\" In March 1999, Docherty said of his departure that he felt the show had \\"burned out\\" and was running out of guests. In a 2008 interview he said the role of chat show host had not suited him, and that he had not enjoyed it. \\"You would be talking to people about what they were doing, and you actually wanted to be doing it yourself.\\" However, the programme is notable for featuring some of the first television work of writers Kevin Cecil and Andy Riley, Jesse Armstrong and Sam Bain, and writer/performers David Mitchell and Robert Webb, all of whom have gone on to have successful comedy careers.

He worked for the family business of John I. Thornycroft & Company, a shipbuilder to the Royal Navy and others. He played a key role in the early development of destroyers and helped the business to branch into land-based transport as managing director from 1906. During the First World War Thornycroft developed the first coastal motor torpedo boats and launching systems for depth charges and was knighted for his work. He also played a key role in the Second World War, making technical decisions on warship armament. Shortly before his death his son, John Ward Thornycroft succeeded him as chairman and managing director of the company.  Early life  Thornycroft was born in Chiswick on 5 September 1872, one of seven children and the eldest son of Blanche Ada n√©e Coules and Sir John Isaac Thornycroft, the founder of the Thornycroft shipbuilding company. His sister, the naval architect Blanche Thornycroft played an increasingly recognised role in the family engineering business. His aunt and uncle were the sculptors Mary Thornycroft and Hamo Thornycroft. He was educated at St Paul's School, London before receiving engineering training at the Central Technical College in South Kensington. After receiving his college diploma in 1892 Thornycroft joined his father's shipyard at Church Wharf, Chiswick where he received further training from his father and John Donaldson.  Family business  Completing his training in 1895 Thornycroft was appointed a draftsman and assistant to the manager of the engine works at the Chiswick yard, where he helped install machinery to torpedo boats and destroyers. Between 1896 and 1902 he was responsible for carrying out sea trials on these vessels and also carried out experimental work on boilers and other machinery. He helped to develop HMS Albatross an 1898 torpedo boat destroyer, an early milestone in the development of the type. The family business was converted into a publicly listed company in 1901 and Thornycroft was appointed technical director in 1902, with responsibility for all construction work and new designs, including motor vehicles. Thornycroft became managing director in 1906 and was responsible for establishing new shipyards and engine works at Southampton and a motor vehicle works at Basingstoke.  War work  Thornycroft worked on the design and construction of vessels for the Royal Navy during the First World War, a service for which he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1918. This included design and construction of the first coastal motor torpedo boats and depth charge launchers. He also developed road vehicles, including a steam-powered wagon and an oil-engined tractor. After the war he continued development of ships and land vehicles. During the Second World War he proved vital in making technical decisions regarding changes to and modification of naval weapons. Thronycroft was key in the early development of the destroyer from the Daring of 1893 to the Duchess of 1951. Thornycroft resigned as Chairman of the company on 20 July 1960, being then elected as president of its board. His eldest son, John Ward Thornycroft succeeded him as chairman and managing director. The elder Thornycroft died five months later on 21 November 1960.  Recognition  Thornycroft was elected president of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers for the 1937 to 1938 session and of the Institution of Civil Engineers for the November 1942 to November 1943 session - he had become an associate member in 1899 and a full member in 1927.. He was honorary vice-president of the Institution of Naval Architects from 1943 to his death and a member of the Institute of Transport and the Isle of Wight River Board.

It protects part of the Bolivian Yungas ecoregion. The indigenous people living within the park belong to the Tsiman√©, Yuracar√©, and Moje√±o- Trinitario peoples. The southern portion of the park has been colonized by agricultural settlers, primarily coca farmers, since the 1970s. The Bolivian government estimates that 10% of the park has been deforested by their presence.\\"El viceministro de Defensa Social, Felipe C√°ceres, reconoci√≥ que hay cultivos de coca ilegal sembrados por colonizadores en el Territorio Ind√≠gena del Parque Nacional Isiboro S√©cure (TIPNIS) y que el 10 por ciento de este espacio fue deforestado.\\" Establishment The park was made into a National Park by Supreme Decree 7401 on November 22, 1965 and recognized as an indigenous territory (formally as Native Community Land) through Supreme Decree 22610 on September 24, 1990, following pressure by local native peoples and the March for Territory and Dignity organized by the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of the Bolivian East. Indigenous residents had organized the Subcentral Ind√≠gena del TIPNIS (Subcentral TIPNIS) in July 1988. Following clearing by the National Agrarian Reform Institute (INRA), operative collective title to the Isiboro Secur√© TCO, consisting of 1,091,656 hectares was awarded to the Subcentral TIPNIS on 13 June 2009. Some 124,000 hectares inside the park were adjudicated to agrarian colonists, most in the southern Polygon 7. Another 137,783 hectares are held by ranchers in the Beni department portion of the park. Macheteros, a typical dance of Beni, performed by local Moxos people in Isiboro S√©cure National Park, 2004 Ecology The territory includes four major ecosystems: * Flooded savannas of the Moxos plain or llano, which are characterized by varied relief and are similar to the llanos of Colombia and the Pantanal in southeast Bolivia * Sub-Andean Amazonian forest * Pre-Andean Amazonian forest * Bolivian-Peruvian Yungas Wildlife (undescribed species not included) * Mammals: 218 species * Birds: 992 species * Amphibians: 157 species * Reptiles: 131 species Population TIPNIS is home to three indigenous peoples who have ancestrally lived in the region. At the 2001 census, there were 12,388 indigenous inhabitants, living in 64 communities: 1.809 from the Yuracar√© people; 4,228 of the Trinitario-Moje√±o people; and 6,351 of the Chimane people. In the colonized zone of the south, there are some 20 thousand families belonging to 52 agrarian unions, which are organized into 8 centrales (or union federations). These unions are members of the Federation of the Tropic of Cochabamba (), itself one of the Six Federations, the Chapare coca growers' union organization. Geography= River basin  The area is part of the Mamor√© River drainage, portion of the Amazon Basin. The S√©cure River is one of the principal tributaries of the Mamor√© and the Isiboro River itself flows into the S√©cure. Both the S√©cure and Isiboro flow through TIPNIS, and are located in the north and south of the park, respectively. The Ichoa River, a tributary of the Isiboro, flows through the central part of the park and receives water from various smaller streams. The S√©cure and Isiboro drainages correspond the Yungas Mountainous Humid Forest and Madeira Humid Forest bioregions. The Isiboro, S√©cure, and Ichoa rivers are the principal axes of transportation in the region, through which visitors reach the attractions of the park. They make up part of the landscape observed by visitors as well as the route for navigation. The rivers also are home to much of the fauna of the park, particularly the pink river dolphins.  Laguna Bolivia  The Laguna Bolivia is a major site for observing wildlife. It is accessed by water, entering through the Black arroyo from the S√©cure river during high water season, or by land on foot or horse from the communities of Dulce Nombre or Limoncito. The water route lacks a formal port from which tourists may embark. The land route is by way of the road through the southern colonized area of TIPNIS from Isinuta to Aroma. Environmental threats=Deforestation TIPNIS has experienced substantial deforestation, particularly in the region of the park outside the red line, known as Polygon 7, where agricultural colonization has taken place since the 1970s. Continuing colonization is expected to remove 43% of the forest cover in TIPNIS by 2030. Planned highway The park was slated as the site of the Segment Two (of three) of the proposed Villa Tunari‚ÄìSan Ignacio de Moxos Highway, which would provide the first direct highway link between Cochabamba and Beni Departments. While the highway has been discussed for decades, a $332 million loan from Brazil's National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), approved by Bolivia in 2011, will make construction possible. The project has an expected overall cost of $415 million and extends 306 kilometers, divided into three segments: Segment I from Villa Tunari to Isinuta (47 km), Segment II from Isinuta to Monte Grande (177 km), and Segment III from Monte Grande to San Ignacio de Moxos (82 km). In May 2010, the a meeting of TIPNIS Subcentral and corregidores throughout the territory stated their \\"overwhelming and unrenounceable opposition\\" to the project. In June 2011, President Evo Morales inaugurated the project with a ceremony at Villa Tunari. However, neither a final design nor environmental approval have been completed for Segment Two. In July 2011, the Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ announced they would participate in a national march from Villa Tunari to La Paz opposing the project. A major concern about the impact of the road is its contribution to deforestion: \\"Empirical evidence has shown that highways are motors for deforestation\\" concluded a study of the project by the Program for Strategic Investigation in Bolivia (PIEB).‚ÄúLa evidencia emp√≠rica ha mostrado que las carreteras son motores de deforestaci√≥n‚Äù The study projected that the road would markedly accelerate deforestation in the park, leaving up to 64% of TIPNIS deforested by 2030. A technical report submitted by the Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) established that the direct deforestation caused by the road itself would only be 0.03%;‚ÄúInd√≠genas bolivianos persisten en rechazar construcci√≥n de v√≠a que genera impacto forestal de 0,03 por ciento‚Äù similarly, President Morales has spoken of a 180-hectare deforestation, an area equivalent to a rectangle 180 km long and 10 m wide. Morales government officials claim 49 of the 64 communities of TIPNIS are now in favor of the construction of the road. The Subcentral, the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), and the highland indigenous confederation CONAMAQ carried out a national march from Trinidad, Beni to La Paz in opposition to the project, beginning on August 15, 2011. On September 25, a police raid on the march resulted in the detention of hundreds of marchers, who were later released. The march regrouped and arrived in La Paz on October 19 to a massive public welcome. During the march, other movements such as the Cochabamba campesino confederation and the colonos union in Yucumo mobilized in favor of the project. In early October, the Plurinational Legislative Assembly passed legislation authored by the MAS authorizing the road following a consultation process, but indigenous deputies and the indigenous movement opposed the bill. At the opening of negotiations with the protesters on October 21, Morales announced that he would veto the legislation and support the text proposed by the indigenous deputies. This text was passed by the Assembly and signed into law on October 24. Law 180 of 2011 declares TIPNIS an intangible zone and prohibits the construction of highways that cross it. However, in February 2012, the government retracted from agreements with indigenous marchers and enacted Law 222, authorizing and designing a consultation process to be carried out in the TIPNIS about the highway.https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO- L-N222.html The consultation process was carried out despite renewed indigenous mobilizations against it (the Ninth Ingigenous March was not received by the government for negotiations and was subject to police repression in their camping site in La Paz ). Human rights observers who audited the consultation have denounced considerable irregularities before, during, and after the consultation including late notifications, lack of information provided to indigenous communities, meetings outside of indigenous norms, and the promise of gifts or projects contingent on support for the highway.https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/bolivia609esp2013.pdfhttps://www.somossur.net/documentos/20170725_tipnis_consulta.pdf According to the consultation, most communities supported the construction of the road, but indigenous communities have denounced that the consultation process was not conducted in good faith, and was aimed at justifying the derogation of Law 180. In 2017, the governing MAS party introduced legislation to repeal the intangibility protections of Law 180 and to authorize the drafting of a transportation plan. This law, the Law for the Protection, Integral and Sustainable Development of TIPNIS (), was enacted as Law 969 on August 13, 2017. The law repealed special protections for the park and authorized the drafting of a transportation plan for TIPNIS. Law 969 opens the park for the construction of roads and other infrastructure, as well as for private investment.https://www.lexivox.org/norms/BO-L-N969.html Oil development A significant number of oil and gas drilling concessions authorized by the government are located within the Park. The Chispani, R√≠o Hondo, and S√©cure (zones 19 and 20) concession blocks are partially or mostly located within the TIPNIS boundaries. Map of concessions The S√©cure block, is controlled by Petroandina, a joint venture of Bolivia state oil company YPFB and Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, which has carried out aerial surveys in the early stages of oil exploration. The R√≠o Hondo block is a joint venture of the Brazilian state company Petrobras, Total of France, and YPFB, authorized by Law 3672 on April 23, 2007.Bolivia: Ley N¬∫ 3672, Lexivox, 23 April 2007 Two exploratory wells were previously drilled in the park, Villa Tunari X-1 A, which reached a 3,032-meter depth, and Eva Eva X-1, which was drilled 5,830 meters deep between 1999 and 2001. The National Service for Protected Areas (SERNAP), which oversees Bolivia's national parks, has stated that oil exploration and extraction could cause serious damage to the rivers and ecosystems of TIPNIS.

Seshagiri Iyer was born in 1860 in a village in Tiruchirapalli district. He had his early education in his village and studied law in Madras. He served as a member of the Madras Legislative Council. Seshagiri Iyer was known for his public work.  Early life  Seshagiri Iyer was born to Vaidyanatha Iyer in the village of Tiruchendurai in Tiruchirapalli district in 1860. He was one of Vaidyanatha Iyer's six children through his second wife, Komali, the other five being girls. Vaidynatha Iyer also had six sons namely, Mannarswamy, Ramu, Venkataraman and Subbaraman through another wife. Seshagiri Iyer's sisters were Sanamma, Seethalakshmi, Thailambal, Subbammal and Kalyani. Mannarswamy looked after the early education of his younger siblings in the family. Seshagiri Iyer married Kalyani and had two daughters Bhagi and Nagammal. The family settled down in Alwarpet, Chennai.  Career = Legal career  On completion of his studies, Seshagiri Iyer joined as an apprentice of the famous Madras lawyer of British origin, Eardley Norton. During this time, Seshagiri Iyer was responsible for the Hindu Transfers and Bequests Act of 1914. This act is now popularly known as the \\"Seshagiri Ayyar Act\\". Seshagiri Iyer served as a judge of the Madras High Court from 1914 to 1920. His name was considered for Diwan Bahadurship but was ultimately rejected by the Governor in favor of K. Narayana Row.Some Madras Leaders, Pg 68 Seshagiri Iyer also functioned as a member of the Senate of the University of Madras. In 1916, disappointed at the very tough nature of the Intermediate Examination and the fact that very few Indian candidates had passed the examination, Seshagiri Iyer moved a resolution in the senate demanding that the pass mark for English be reduced to 30 percent. He described the tough correction at the examination as \\"slaughter\\" of the candidates. However, there was staunch opposition to this resolution by British professors. One Rev. Macphail uttered: \\"You bring rickshaw-wallahs and jhutkawallahs to the examination hall, and when they fail, you complain of slaughter\\".  Political career  Seshagiri Iyer represented the University of Madras in the Madras Legislative Council from 1921 until his death in 1926. He presided over a number of conferences during this time.

Besides the Balkan Mountains, Southern Bulgaria borders Serbia to the west, North Macedonia to the southwest, Greece to the south, Turkey to the southeast and the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast to the east. Geographically, the terrain in Southern Bulgaria is much more varied than that of the north, with the Upper Thracian Plain stretching in the east, while the south and west are dominated by some of Bulgaria's highest mountains such as Rila, Pirin and the Rhodopes, as well as smaller and/or lower mountains and valleys in the west, such as Vitosha, Belasitsa, Osogovo, the Sofia Valley, the Sub-Balkan valleys and the Kraishte region. Southern Bulgaria covers an area of 62,414 square kilometres and has a population of 5,085,872 (63% of Bulgaria's entire population), with a population density of 81.5 people per km¬≤. The three largest cities are the national capital Sofia, the largest city in Thrace, Plovdiv, and the major Black Sea port of Burgas. Administratively, Southern Bulgaria includes the following 14 Bulgarian provinces: * Blagoevgrad Province * Burgas Province * Haskovo Province * Kardzhali Province * Kyustendil Province * Pazardzhik Province * Pernik Province * Plovdiv Province * Sliven Province * Smolyan Province * City of Sofia * Sofia Province * Stara Zagora Province * Yambol Province Historically, Southern Bulgaria covers the historical regions of Thrace and Macedonia (Pirin Macedonia). The Bulgarian South also has a number of often unclearly defined or overlapping sub-regions, particularly in the west and southwest, such as Chech, Shop region, Kraishte, Burel, Visok, Zabardie, Znepole, Graovo, Osogoviya, Piyanets, Podgorie, Razlog, Rupchos, Tamrash, etc. Southern Bulgaria is also conventionally divided into Southwestern, Central Southern and Southeastern Bulgaria, with slightly varying borders. In Antiquity, the Jireƒçek Line divided Latin (in the north) and Ancient Greek (in the south) language influence in the Balkans, with Northern Bulgaria to the north of it and Southern Bulgaria to the south. Much later, after the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, all of Northern Bulgaria and the region of Sofia became the Principality of Bulgaria while most of the rest of Southern Bulgaria was part of Eastern Rumelia until the Bulgarian unification in 1885. Pirin Macedonia became part of Bulgaria after the Treaty of Bucharest of 1913, and the only Bulgarian gains by the otherwise catastrophic post-World War I Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine of 1919 were two small strips of land in southern Sakar.

At Everett High School, he was active in football and track, graduating in 1984. During his high school years his political views were heavily shaped by the career of Everett High School alumnus Henry M. Jackson. After high school, Van Patten moved to Tempe, Arizona, living and working as a tile and marble setter until returning to Seattle to attend Seattle Pacific University for two years. After leaving SPU, he gained employment at Allied-Signal Aerospace and transferred to Arizona State University to complete his education.  Professional career  He has worked as a quality, process and application engineer in the printed circuit board industry since the early 1990s. In 1997 he relocated his family to New Hampshire, on behalf of the former Continental Circuits Corporation, to assume responsibilities for the New England sales office. Mr. Van Patten served in sales management for Toppan Electronics where he was responsible for the Eastern portion of North America and Europe. Currently, Mr. Van Patten is in sales management at Merix Corporation.  Political career  He was a Republican member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, representing the Rockingham 8th District elected in 2008. Representative Van Patten was endorsed by the Republican Leadership Councilhttp://www.republican- leadership.com/node/625 and the New Hampshire Advantage Coalitionhttp://www.thenhadvantage.com/content.asp?pl=1&contentid;=1 for election to the New Hampshire General Court.

It has been implemented in BSD and is also available through the GNU sum command line utility. Computation of the BSD checksum Below is the relevant part of the GNU sum source code (GPL licensed). It computes a 16-bit checksum by adding up all bytes (8-bit words) of the input data stream. In order to avoid many of the weaknesses of simply adding the data, the checksum accumulator is circular rotated to the right by one bit at each step before the new char is added. int bsdChecksumFromFile(FILE *fp) /* The file handle for input data */ { int checksum = 0; /* The checksum mod 2^16. */ for (int ch = getc(fp); ch != EOF; ch = getc(fp)) { checksum = (checksum >> 1) + ((checksum & 1) << 15); checksum += ch; checksum &= 0xffff; /* Keep it within bounds. */ } return checksum; } Below is some sample java code that calculates an 8-bit checksum. It adds each byte from the input byte array after a circular rotation of the checksum. byte checksum(byte[] input) { byte checksum = 0; for (byte cur_byte: input) { checksum = (byte) (((checksum & 0xFF) >>> 1) + ((checksum & 0x1) << 7)); // Rotate the accumulator checksum = (byte) ((checksum + cur_byte) & 0xFF); // Add the next chunk } return checksum; } Description of the algorithm As mentioned above, this algorithm computes a checksum by segmenting the data and adding it to an accumulator that is circular right shifted between each summation. To keep the accumulator within return value bounds, bit-masking with 1's is done. Example: Calculating a 4-bit checksum using 4-bit sized segments (big-endian) Input: 101110001110 -> three segments: 1011, 1000, 1110.

It derives from the Old English for \\"valley (denu) of a river called Turce\\", with Turce or Twrch being a lost Celtic river name, possibly meaning boar.

Turkdean is part of the constituency of Cotswold, represented at parliament by Conservative MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown. It is part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament. Geography Turkdean is in the county of Gloucestershire and lies within the Cotswolds, a range of hills designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. It is approximately 30 km (20 mi) to the east of Gloucester. It is approximately 21 km (13 mi) east of its post town Cheltenham and about 8 km (5 mi) south-west of Bourton-on-the- Water. The southeastern boundary follows the route of the Roman road the Fosse Way. Nearby villages include Cold Aston, Hazleton, Clapton, Farmington and Hampnett. In popular culture In the 1981 film Raiders of the Lost Ark, Harrison Ford's character, archaeologist Indiana Jones, mentions the neolithic barrow at Turkdean, near Hazleton, during a university lecture. There are two Neolithic long barrows at Hazleton, one of which was excavated over three summer seasons between 1980-1982.http://www.archaeologyuk.org/ba/ba72/column2.shtml The Channel 4 archaeological television series Time Team made two visits, in 1997 (Time Team Live 1997, repackaged as series 5 episode 4) and 1998 (series 6 episode 9), to excavate a nearby Roman villa site (not the neolithic barrows).

Birger Nerman Grobin-Seeburg; Ausgrabungen und Funde xii, 200 pages illustrations, 61 plates, maps. Stockholm, Almqvist & Wiksell (1958)  History  The Livonian Order erected the castle in 1253 to protect the roads from Livonia to Prussia. It was a square type building and was a three storey high living block in the southern aisle. It also had a gate tower in the middle of the western wall. The castle was built of bricks and crude stone. Once it had arched ceilings. It was a residence for the local viceroy of the Livonian Order from 1399 to 1590. From 1590 to 1609 it was ruled by Prussia. As support base in south Courland it was many times rebuilt and fortified. In the times of the Duchy of Courland, the castle was destroyed and rebuilt many times. In the sixteenth and seventeenth century sand walls were erected around the castle. They had a bastion in each of the four corners and a stockade. Later the castle was used as a residence for local German landlords. The castle was destroyed in the eighteenth century. Many famous people have visited the castle, for example: Duke Jacob Kettler of Courland, The King of Sweden, Carl XII and the King of Prussia, Friedrich Wilhelm III.  13 century  The castle of the original order was built in the 13th century. The time and place of the construction of this castle are not clearly known, but several sources mention the period around 1245-1251 year, when under the leadership of the Master of the Order Dietrich von Gr√ºningen, several castles were built in Kurzeme, including in Kuldiga Castle and Emb≈´te Castle. The castle was made of wood.  14 century  In 1328, the Livonian Order gave the Mƒìmele area to the State of the Teutonic Order. Probably soon after, Grobi≈Üa Castle was rebuilt on the right bank of the river on a land elevation about 200 meters from castle mound (SkƒÅbƒÅr≈ækalns), and this stone castle was further ruled by the Grobi≈Üa bailiff, who was under the command of Kuldƒ´ga. The castle was located on the ancient Prussian road, in the middle between Mƒìmele and Kuldƒ´ga, and was thus an important fortress in the region. It was a rectangular building with a three-storey residential building in the south wing and a gate tower in the middle of the west wall. In the 14th century, a soldier's passage stretched along the gutters around the fortified wall at the height of the second floor. Master Gosvin von Herike rebuilt and expanded the castle around 1347, as the seat of the bailiff (1399 - 1590) and the support point of the Order in South Kurzeme on the strategically important road to Prussia, it was strengthened and rebuilt several times.  16 century  The last master of the Livonian Order, Gotthard Kettler, pledged Grobi≈Üa Castle to the Duke of Prussia for 15,000 guilders during the Livonian War in 1560. The pledge agreement was signed on May 5, 1560 in Reval (Tallinn), but the Duke's officials had left Grobi≈Üa Castle as early as April 28-30. In July 1560, Master Johan Funks visited Grobi≈Üa Castle, and a Protestant pastor had already preached in the church of the castle. Inventory list of the castle church in 1560: \\"Castle made of silverware - 1 silver cup, 1 square plate with a silver crucifix and two silver pictures, 1 silver ring, 1 gilded copper monstrance. Castle made of cast silver - 2 large chandeliers, 9 small chandeliers, as well as 1 pool for hand washing. or in the castle of the altar cloth - 1 old mass garment with crucifixes.\\" In 1562, the castle manager, writer and servants stayed in Grobi≈Üa Castle. In 1590, the arsenal arranged in Grobi≈Üa Castle was mentioned for the first time.  17 century  The fortress was fundamentally rebuilt and further strengthened in the 17th century. The bourgeoisie of Grobi≈Üa was included in the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia in 1609, when the Duke of Courland Wilhelm Kettler married Duchess Sophie of Prussia. Grobi≈Üa Castle became one of the dukes' residences, earthen ramparts with four bastions in the corners and a palisade fence were built around the castle. During the Second Northern War in 1659, the Swedes burned down the town of Grobi≈Üa and looted the castle. During the Great Northern War, the castle was again occupied and destroyed by the Swedish army under the command of King Charles XII of Sweden. Until the end of the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia, the castle housed the administrative institutions of Grobi≈Üa Castle.  18 century  In 1710, Frederick William, Duke of Courland married Anna Ioannovna (later Empress of Russia), but on his way back from St Petersburg, he took ill and died. Around this time in the duchy began the Great Northern War plague outbreak, which killed a large part of the population. Anne ruled as the duchess of Courland from 1711 to 1730. Economic and political significance of the castle greatly diminished.  19 century  After 1809, the castle was no longer inhabited and gradually turned into ruins. wrote in 1809: \\"Although repairs were still possible a few years ago, [the castle] is no longer inhabited. It is gradually turning into ruins. The outer walls are still strong and good, and 10 to 12 years ago I found one habitable premises, as well as the remains of an old weapons depot. \\" During this time, King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia visited Grobi≈Üa Castle, who had settled in Mƒìmelburg Castle in Klaipƒóda due to Napoleon's Invasion of Russia. In the 19th century, a city park was established around the castle ruins.  Castle ruins today  In the 1970s major conservation jobs were made in the castle, according to the project of architect I. Stukmanis. Today the castle ruins are in a quite good condition. Most of the walls are still standing in three story height. Today's castle is a major tourist attraction and also a place for local gatherings and concerts. Until 2009, the fortress remained in the LiepƒÅja District, after that in the Grobi≈Üa Municipality.

It is in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB around north-east of London, south of Southwold and north of Leiston, on the North Sea coast. In the Anglo-Saxon period, Dunwich was the capital of the Kingdom of the East Angles, but the harbour and most of the town have since disappeared due to coastal erosion. At its height it was an international port similar in size to 14th-century London. Its decline began in 1286 when a storm surge hit the East Anglian coast, followed by a great storm in 1287 and another great storm, also in 1287, until it eventually shrank to the village it is today. Dunwich is possibly connected with the lost Anglo-Saxon placename Dommoc. The population of the civil parish at the 2001 census was 84,2001 Census data . Retrieved 2 January 2012. which increased to 183 according to the 2011 Census, though the area used by the Office of National Statistics for 2011 also includes part of the civil parish of Westleton. There is no parish council; instead there is a parish meeting.Dunwich Parish Meeting History Former leper hospital, Norman window detail Since the 15th century, Dunwich has frequently been identified with Dommoc ‚Äì the original seat of the Anglo-Saxon bishops of the Kingdom of East Anglia established by Sigeberht of East Anglia for Saint Felix in c. 629‚Äì31.Bede, Ecclesiastical History, Book II, Ch.15 (accepitque sedem episcopatus in ciuitate Dommoc), who stipulates Felix's mission in relation to Sigeberht's rule. Dommoc was the seat of the bishops of Dommoc until around 870, when the East Anglian kingdom was taken over by the initially pagan Danes. Years later, antiquarians would even describe Dunwich as being the \\"former capital of East Anglia\\". However, many historians now prefer to locate Dommoc at Walton Castle, which was the site of a Saxon shore fort.Richard Hoggett, (2010), The archaeology of the East Anglian conversion, pages 35‚Äì40. Boydell & Brewer The Domesday Book of 1086 describes it as possessing three churches. (Archived by Oxford University, 6 March 2009). At that time it had an estimated population of 3,000. On 1 January 1286, a storm surge reached the east edge of the town and destroyed buildings in it. Before that, most recorded damage to Dunwich was loss of land and damage to the harbour. This was followed by two further surges the next year, the South England flood of February 1287 and St. Lucia's flood in December. A fierce storm in 1328 also swept away the entire village of Newton, a few miles up the coast. Another large storm in 1347 swept some 400 houses into the sea. The Grote Mandrenke around 16 January 1362 finally destroyed much of the remainder of the town. Seal of Dunwich, cast (French National Archives, Paris) Most of the buildings that were present in the 13th century have disappeared, including all eight churches, and Dunwich is now a small coastal village. The remains of a 13th- century Franciscan priory (Greyfriars) and the Leper Hospital of St James can still be seen. A popular local legend says that, at certain tides, church bells can still be heard from beneath the waves. Characterizing the fate of the town as the loss of \\"a busy port to ... 14th century storms that swept whole parishes into the sea\\"Alexandra Harris, Guardian Review, 15.02.14 is inaccurate. It appearsDunwich museum displays that the port developed as a sheltered harbour where the Dunwich River entered the North Sea. Coastal processes including storms caused the river to shift its exit north to Walberswick, at the River Blyth. The town of Dunwich lost its raison d'etre and was largely abandoned. Sea defences were not maintained and coastal erosion progressively invaded the town. As a legacy of its previous significance, the parliamentary constituency of Dunwich retained the right to send two members to Parliament until the Reform Act 1832 and was one of Britain's most notorious rotten boroughs. By the mid-19th century, the population had dwindled to 237 inhabitants and Dunwich was described as a \\"decayed and disfranchised borough\\". A new church, St James, was built in 1832 after the abandonment of the last of the old churches, All Saints', which had been without a rector since 1755. All Saints' Church fell into the sea between 1904 and 1919, the last major portion of the tower succumbing on 12 November 1919. In 2005 historian Stuart Bacon stated that recent low tides had shown that shipbuilding had previously occurred in the town. Marine archaeology Beach at Dunwich The Dunwich 2008 project funded by English Heritage and the Esm√©e Fairbairn Foundation was intended to collate all reliable historic mapped data on the same co-ordinate system and combine this with aerial photography and an underwater survey.Dunwich museum plaques viewed 26 April 2012 New digital maps were produced by Prof. David Sear of Southampton University, marine archaeologist Stuart Bacon and the Geodata Institute. The survey also used multibeam and sidescan sonar to map the seafloor across the entire area of the town. These surveys identified a series of ruins which were confirmed by divers who recovered stones with lime mortar still attached. The lime mortar matched nearly perfectly with medieval mortar in existing churches on the coast. In 2009 Wessex Archaeology working with Professor Sear, captured the highest resolution sidescan images of the town site including the ruins found in 2008. Further work in 2010 with BBC Oceans and the BBC One Show used novel acoustic imaging cameras (dual-frequency identification sonar ‚Äì DIDSON) to film the ruins through the turbid water. These clearly showed the jumble of ruined blocks and worked stone associated with medieval church and chapel sites. A large survey and updating of the mapped data was commissioned by English Heritage in 2011 and reported in 2012. This compiled all previous survey data and enhanced the historical map and coastal pilot charts for the site. The results have produced the most comprehensive survey of the Dunwich town site ‚Äì the largest medieval underwater site in Europe. Data from these surveys including maps and images explaining the different technologies are displayed in Dunwich Museum which is accredited by the Museum Archives Libraries Council. Details of Dunwich's 800-year battle to protect against coastal erosion are also displayed in the museum and it is hoped more work will be done in future. A database of references to Dunwich \\"designed to aid academic researchers, family historians and students\\" is available online. In June 2011, at the invitation of Prof David Sear and the Dunwich Town Trust the Anglo-Saxon and medieval archaeology of Dunwich was the subject of an episode of archaeological television programme Time Team. Further work to explore new sites using DIDSON and diver surveys and a campaign of land-based archaeology is scheduled for 2013‚Äì15 funded by the \\"Touching the Tide\\" Heritage Lottery Fund Landscape Partnership Scheme. This work hopes to confirm the date of the town ditches and roads and explore the record of environmental change in the marsh sediments. Altogether this work has identified the ruins of St Peter's and St Nicholas's churches, a chapel most probably St Katherine's, and ruins associated with Blackfriars friary and the town hall. The location of the Knight's Templar Church and All Saints' Church are known from the digital mapping but remain buried beneath an inner sandbank. The early town is buried under between 1 and of sand to the east of the ruins found by Bacon and these later surveys. As a result, it was found that Dunwich had been a substantial port in Saxon times. Churches and other notable structures *Greyfriars: Franciscan priory in the southwest of the city. Being so far west it is one of the few significant parts of ancient Dunwich still visible. It was founded on a site nearer the sea in 1277, moved to its current position in 1290 and survived to the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. The priory was originally enclosed by a stone wall, much of which remains. The most impressive structures still standing are part of the refectory and the 14th century gateway which would have been the main entrance to the monastic buildings.Remains of Greyfriars Priory *St Bartholomew's and St Michael's were both chapels of ease that had been built by the end of the 11th century. *St Leonard's: was a parish church that fell to the sea in the 14th century. *St Nicholas's: was a cruciform building to the south of the city. Lost to the sea soon after the Black Death. *St Martin's: built before 1175, it was lost to the sea between 1335 and 1408. *St Francis Chapel: beside the Dunwich River, was lost in the 16th century. *St Katherine's Chapel: in the parish of St John, lost in the 16th century. *Preceptory of the Knights Templar: thought to have been founded around 1189 and was a circular building similar to the famous Temple Church in London. The sheriff of Suffolk and Norfolk reported in his accounts of 1309 that he found the sum of ¬£111, 14 shillings and sixpence farthing (¬£111-14s-6¬ºd) contained in four pouches ‚Äì a vast sum that had been deposited with the Templars for safe keeping by Robert of Seffeld, parson of Brampton.Item de denariis ... in iiijor puchis, Cxj li. xiiij s. vj d. qua' quos Robertus de Seffeld parsona ecclesie de Brampton se dicit posuisse ibidem ad custodiend': at Kew, The National Archives of the UK, E 358/18 rot. 3 dorse. In 1322, on the orders of Edward II implementing the papal bull Ad providam, all the Templars' land passed to the Knights Hospitallers. Following the suppression of the Hospitallers during the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII, in 1562 the Temple was demolished. The foundations washed away during the reign of Charles I. *St Peter's: similar in length to the church at nearby Blythburgh. It was stripped of anything of value as the cliff edge drew nearer. The east gable fell in 1688 and the rest of the building followed in 1697. The parish register survives and is now in the British Library. *Blackfriars: Dominican priory in the southeast of the city. It was founded during the time of Henry III by Roger Holish. By 1385 preparations were made for the Dominicans to move to nearby Blythburgh as the sea front drew nearer, although prematurely, as the priory remained active and above sea level until at least the Dissolution of the Monasteries under Henry VIII. The last building fell to the sea in 1717. 180px *All Saints' Church: last of Dunwich's ancient churches to be lost to the sea. It was abandoned in the 1750s after it was decided the parishioners could no longer afford the upkeep, although burials occurred in the churchyard until the 1820s. The cliff edge reached All Saints' in 1904 and the tower (at its west end) fell in 1922.Comfort: The Lost City of Dunwich: Churches and Chapels, pp 99‚Äì102 One of the tower buttresses was salvaged and now stands in the current Victorian-era St James' Church. One of the last remaining gravestones, in memory of John Brinkley Easey, fell over the cliff in the early 1990s. A large block of masonry could still be seen at the water's edge at low tide in 1971. In 2011, only one gravestone (in memory of Jacob Forster who died in the late 18th century) remained, about from the cliff edge.

While the general concept of a supreme being has been present since ancient times, the exact term \\"Absolute\\" was first introduced by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and features prominently in the work of many of his followers. In Absolute idealism and British idealism, it serves as a concept for the \\"unconditioned reality which is either the spiritual ground of all being or the whole of things considered as a spiritual unity\\". History The concept of \\"the absolute\\" was introduced in modern philosophy, notably by Hegel, for \\"the sum of all being, actual and potential\\". For Hegel, as understood by Martin Heidegger, the Absolute is \\"the spirit, that which is present to itself in the certainty of unconditional self-knowing\\". As Hegel is understood by Frederick Copleston, \\"Logic studies the Absolute 'in itself'; the philosophy of Nature studies the Absolute 'for itself'; and the philosophy of Spirit studies the Absolute 'in and for itself'.\\" The concept is also found in the works of F. W. J. Schelling, and was anticipated by Johann Gottlieb Fichte. In English philosophy, F. H. Bradley has distinguished the concept of Absolute from God, while Josiah Royce, founder of the American idealism school of philosophy, has equated them. Indian religions The concept of the Absolute has been used to interpret the early texts of the Indian religions such as those attributed to Yajnavalkya, Nagarjuna and Adi Shankara., Quote: \\"Thus the ultimate Absolute presumed by the Indians is not a personal god but an impersonal and metaphysical Principle. Here we can see the impersonal character of the Absolute in Indian thought. The inclination of grasping Absolute negatively necessarily leads (as Hegel would say) to the negation of the negative expression itself.\\" In Jainism, Absolute Knowledge or Kewalya Gnan, is said to be attained by the Arihantas and Teerthankaras, who reflects in their knowing, the 360 degrees of the truth and events of past, present and future. All 24 Teerthankaras and many others are Kewalya Gnani or Carriers of Absolute Knowledge. According to Takeshi Umehara, some ancient texts of Buddhism state that the \\"truly Absolute and the truly Free must be nothingness\\", the \\"void\\". Yet, the early Buddhist scholar Nagarjuna, states Paul Williams, does not present \\"emptiness\\" as some kind of Absolute, rather it is \\"the very absence (a pure non-existence) of inherent existence\\" in MƒÅdhyamaka school of the Buddhist philosophy. According to Glyn Richards, the early texts of Hinduism state that the Brahman or the nondual Brahman‚ÄìAtman is the Absolute., Quote: \\"The Self or Atman is the Absolute viewed from the subjective standpoint (arkara), or a real mode of existence of the Absolute.\\" The term has also been adopted by Aldous Huxley in his perennial philosophy to interpret various religious traditions, including Indian religions, and influenced other strands of nondualistic and New Age thought.

Early life Oliver was born in Florida. His father was Dennis Lee Oliver (December 1922 ‚Äì August 1980) and his mother was Sadie Lenore Head Oliver. His parents owned Independent Fish Company, located on Seminole Place on the Homosassa River. His parents are buried in Stagestand Cemetery in Homosassa. Professional wrestling career In Pacific Northwest Wrestling (PNW), he set a record for holding the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship more than anyone. Oliver also had many titles in tag team competition, holding the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship and the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship a combined 18 times. In 1985 Chris Adams allowed his tag team partner Gino Hernandez to defend the WCCW Television Championship against Billy Jack Haynes, where he lost that title, but Oliver defeated and severely injured Billy to win the television title soon thereafter. After wrestling in PNW, Oliver began to wrestle for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), and worked mainly as a jobber. During his run, Oliver appeared once on Saturday Night's Main Event XVIII, going by the name of Super Ninja, challenging The Ultimate Warrior for the WWF Intercontinental Championship. During his many title reigns Oliver faced many wrestlers such as Rocky Johnson, Brett Sawyer, Billy Jack Haynes, Buddy Rose, Bobby Jaggers, Stan Stasiak, Larry Hennig, Curt Hennig, Brian Adams, Jay Youngblood, Steve Regal, Roddy Piper, Tom Zenk, and Buzz Sawyer. After leaving the WWF Oliver would return to PNW in 1990. He wrestled his last match on October 12, 1991, losing the NWA Pacific Northwest Heavyweight Championship to Demolition Crush. Lawsuit In July 2016, Oliver was part of a class action lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred traumatic brain injuries during their tenure and that the company concealed the risks of injury. The suit was litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE. US District Judge Vanessa Lynne Bryant dismissed the lawsuit in September 2018. Death In early 2020, it was revealed that Oliver had entered into hospice care due to end-stage heart failure. He died on March 5, 2020, surrounded by his family.

History One Scordisci archaeological site dating back to late La T√®ne culture was excavated in the 1970s and 1980s as a part of rescue excavations in eastern Croatia. Croatian War of Independence During the Croatian War of Independence, 32 residents of Sotin were killed and another 32 are missing . A mass grave containing three bodies was discovered near the village through information obtained by Serbian authorities conducting a criminal inquest of war crimes--killing of 16 Croatian civilians in Sotin-- committed by the Croatian Serb militia and Territorial Defense Forces in late 1991. In April 2013, the second mass grave was found in the village. It contained ten bodies transferred from the mass grave containing the three other bodies to a village slaughterhouse pit where animal bones were disposed of at the time. The move was made in 1997 in order to hide the bodies better. All thirteen, whose remains were found in the two graves, were killed on 26 December 1991. Two other mass graves were found previously, one at the Catholic graveyard in the village and the other in nearby vineyards.

The main division is between combined oral contraceptive pills, containing both estrogens and synthetic progestogens (progestins), and progestogen only pills. Combined oral contraceptive pills also come in varying types, including varying doses of estrogen, and whether the dose of estrogen or progestogen changes from week to week. Mechanism of action Combination pills usually work by preventing the ovaries from releasing eggs (ovulation). They also thicken the cervical mucus, which keeps sperm from penetrating into the uterus and joining with an egg. The hormones in combination and progestogen-only pills also thin the lining of the uterus. This could prevent pregnancy by interfering with implantation of a blastocyst. Main action in typical use is prevention of ovulation. Combined oral contraceptive pills All contain an estrogen, ethinylestradiol or mestranol, in varying amounts, and one of a number of different progestogens. (Regarding the estrogen, the inactive 3-methyl ether of ethinylestradiol, which must be metabolized by the liver into the active ethinylestradiol; 50 Œºg of mestranol is equivalent to only 35 Œºg of ethinylestradiol and should not be used when high-dose [50 Œºg ethinylestradiol] estrogen pills are needed; mestranol was the estrogen used in the first oral contraceptive, Enovid). They are usually taken for 21 days with then a seven-day gap during which a withdrawal bleed (often, but incorrectly, referred to as a menstrual period) occurs. These differ in the amount of estrogen given, and whether they are monophasic (the same dose of estrogen and progestogen during each of the 21 days) or multiphasic (varying doses). The introduction of extended-cycle monophasic pills (i.e. Seasonale) has shown that the withdrawal bleeding intervals can be decreased. Monophasic These are typically given as 21 tablets of estrogen and progestogen, followed by seven tablets of placebo or an iron supplement, although some newer formulations contain more active tablets and fewer placebos. Everyday regimens (Microgynon 30 ED, Femodene ED, Logynon ED), which include seven inactive placebo pills, are rarely used in UK practice.

Agnolo Doni married Maddalena Strozzi in 1503, but Raphael's portraits were probably executed in 1506, the period in which the painter studied the art of Leonardo da Vinci most closely. The composition of the portraits resembles that of the Mona Lisa: the figures are presented in the same way in respect to the picture plane, and their hands, like those of the Mona Lisa, are placed on top of one another. But the low horizon of the landscape background permits a careful assessment of the human figure by providing a uniform light which defines surfaces and volumes. This relationship between landscape and figure presents a clear contrast to the striking settings of Leonardo, which communicate the threatening presence of nature. But the most notable characteristic that distinguishes these portraits from those of Leonardo is the overall sense of serenity which even the close attention to the materials of clothes and jewels (which draw one's attention to the couple's wealth) is unable to attenuate. Every element - even those of secondary importance - works together to create a precise balance. These works, linked not only by the kinship of the subjects, but also by their evident stylistic homogeneity, mark the beginning of Raphael's artistic maturity.

Biography He was born in Dundee, Mississippi, United States, and was the grandson of Dan Sane, the guitarist in Frank Stokes' Memphis blues act the Beale Street Sheiks. (The spelling discrepancy was the result of a birth certificate error). He played trumpet and drums as a child. In 1949, he moved to Greenville, Mississippi to join his stepfather, pianist Willie Love, as a drummer in a band fronted by Sonny Boy Williamson, soon leaving to join Howlin‚Äô Wolf where he acted as a drummer intermittently for the following decade. After returning from the United States Army draft, serving in the Korean War, he returned to Greenville, and took up the saxophone to rejoin Love in Little Milton's backing band. Sain moved to Chicago in 1955, sometimes sitting in with Howlin' Wolf's band and becoming acquainted with the owners of Chess Records. In 1959, he was invited by Little Milton to join him for club engagements in East St Louis, and over time became Little Milton's musical director, as well as performing occasionally with Ike Turner's Kings of Rhythm. He recruited Fontella Bass as the Little Milton band's keyboard player, only later discovering her singing talents. After a few years, Sain left Little Milton's band and installed Fontella Bass and Bobby McClure as co-lead singers in his Oliver Sain Soul Revue. The band made its first recordings in 1964, and the following year Sain wrote and produced Bass and McClure's number 5 R&B; chart hit, \\"Don't Mess Up a Good Thing\\" recorded at the Chess studios in Chicago and released on the subsidiary Checker label. The song was later covered by Gregg Allman of the Allman Brothers Band, on his solo album Laid Back. After Bass left Sain's band for a solo career, she was replaced by Barbara Carr, who continued to sing with Sain until 1972. He set up his own recording studio, Archway, in St Louis in 1965, and recorded and produced artists such as the Montclairs and Julius Hemphill, developing \\"a distinctively full, dynamic sound that would come to help define the St. Louis soul aesthetic.\\" He released his first album, Main Man, in 1972, followed by Bus Stop in 1975. The track \\"Booty Bumpin' (The Double Bump)\\" from the latter album was issued as a single, and reached number 78 in the R&B; chart. \\"Party Hearty\\", taken from his 1976 album Blue Max, reached number 16 on the R&B; chart, and its flip side, \\"She's a Disco Queen\\", bubbled under the Hot 100. Sain's recordings, including \\"Bus Stop'\\", also became successful in British clubs (though it did not reach the UK singles chart), as a result of which he toured in the UK. His final R&B; chart entry in the US came with \\"Feel Like Dancin'\\" in 1977. Sain released two further albums, So Good (In the Morning) (1981) and Fused Jazz (1983), but increasingly concentrated on his work as a producer as well as live performances. In 1982, he produced Larry Davis' album Funny Stuff, which won a W. C. Handy Award. In 1987, he composed and produced Johnnie Johnson's debut album Blue Hand Johnnie. In 1986 and 1987, Sain toured Europe with former Kings of Rhythm members Clayton Love, Billy Gayles, Stacy Johnson and Robbie Montgomery (one of the Ikettes) as part of the St. Louis Kings of Rhythm. They were officially appointed as ambassadors for the City of St. Louis by Mayor Vincent Schoemehl. Sain continued to perform and to undertake studio work despite being diagnosed with bladder cancer in the mid-1990s, and is credited with discovering local singer Kim Massie. Terry Perkins, \\"Kim Massie came home to sing; others will thank her for that gift\\", St Louis Public Radio, September 19, 2013. Retrieved 14 October 2016 Sain died on October 28, 2003 from bone cancer, which followed on from previous bladder cancer.

It is owned by Holdings Acquisition Co. L.P., a joint venture of Walton Street Capital LLC and High Pitt Gaming LP. Located in Pittsburgh's Chateau Even though some newspaper articles mention this casino as being in the North Shore neighborhood of Pittsburgh, the official city of Pittsburgh map (see cite URL) indicates that it is actually located in the Chateau neighborhood. Locations west of Allegheny Avenue, south of Western Avenue, and north and east of the Ohio River are in Chateau. neighborhood along the Ohio River, adjacent to the Carnegie Science Center and nearby Heinz Field and PNC Park, it had its groundbreaking in December 2007 and opened on August 9, 2009. The casino was originally to be built by Don H. Barden, but financial troubles forced him to sell 75% of his interest in the casino to Holdings Acquisition Co on July 16, 2008. The casino has 3,000 slot machines. History=Application process The \\"Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act\\"4 Pa.C.S. ¬ß1101 et seq. authorized the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board to issue up to 17 casino licenses, with at least 1 casino license reserved for the City of Pittsburgh. Four organizations entered the proposal process to win the Pittsburgh casino license: North Shore Gaming, LP, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., Station Square Gaming, LP, and PITG Gaming, LLC. Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl and other local officials favored a deal from the Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc., which proposed to give the Pittsburgh Penguins $290 million to build a new arena in exchange for receiving the casino license. In a \\"Plan B\\" negotiated by local political leaders, both the Majestic Star and Forest City agreed to pay $7.5 million a year for 30 years toward the construction of the new hockey arena. The Station Square proposal was backed by major casino players, including Harrah's Entertainment and Forest City Enterprises. In 2005, then-Mayor Tom Murphy controversially said during a press luncheon that \\"the fix is in\\" for Forest City's proposal. The proposed plan suffered from questions about increases in traffic in the already-developed Station Square location. The proposal from PITG Gaming, LLC, a holding company owned by Don Barden's The Majestic Star Casino, LLC, was awarded one of five available \\"Category 2\\" slots licenses by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board on December 20, 2006. Barden's proposal was generally considered a \\"long-shot\\" for much of the application process because, unlike the competition, it lacked a large rewards program for gamblers and did not offer to pay for a replacement for the aging Mellon Arena. Local community groups expressed concern over its proposed North Side location, home to PNC Park and Heinz Field and the increase in traffic congestion. Barden and PITG Gaming, LLC, were awarded the casino license in December 2006. Several lawsuits were filed by the losing applicants challenging the Gaming Board's decision, but they were not successful. Early construction delays were blamed on the suits. Construction Ground was broken on the casino's North Shore in December 2007. In July 2008, Barden defaulted on a $200 million bridge loan and failed to pay contractors, halting construction. On July 16, 2008, he sold 75% of his interest to Holdings Acquisition Co, a joint venture of Walton Street Capital LLC and High Pitt Gaming LP and led by Neil Bluhm. The ownership changes were approved by the Gaming Board on August 14, 2008, and construction on the casino restarted. In November 2008, the new owners changed the casino's name to \\"Rivers Casino\\" to reflect its location near the confluence of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. Grand opening The Rivers Casino opened as scheduled at noon on August 9, 2009. Taxes The Rivers Casino is reported to be worth $199.5 million to Allegheny County at least for taxing purposes. That's the assessed value the county has placed on the North Shore riverfront venue for the 2010 tax year. The value was calculated based on construction costs of the casino and surrounding parcels. The $199.5 million assessed value is the largest on any commercial property in Allegheny County and the largest on any casino in Pennsylvania. (According to Allegheny County real estate records, 600 Grant St. 15219 (the tallest building in Pittsburgh), is valued at $175 Million). Barring an appeal, it will produce $935,655 in property tax revenue for the county, $2.77 million for city schools, and $2.15 million for the city. The casino, the school district and the city all have the right to appeal the value if they so choose. Management In January 2018 it was announced that long running General Manager, Craig Clark, would be succeeded by Bill Keena. Keena was previously the General Manager of the Rivers Casino (Des Plaines) and has been in the casino industry for over 30 years. Recently, it inked a deal with BetRivers.com Dining & entertainment Rivers Casino has five restaurants: Grand View Buffet, Ciao, West End Cafe, Andrew's Steak & Seafood, and Vietnamese Noodles. It also has four bars: Spiral Bar, Drum Bar, Levels, and Wheelhouse. In the fall of 2009, the casino opened a coat room, open till 6pm Sunday through Thursday and until 2 am closing time on Fridays and Saturdays. The casino also has a night club and a 1,000 seat outdoor amphitheater. Rewards club Rivers Casino offers a rewards club, the Rush Rewards Players Club. It has various rewards based on play level. Some rewards include: free slot play, free monthly gifts, and free/discounted food offers. Table games Table games opened to the general public in July 2010. As table games have succeeded financially, management officials announced plans in January 2011 to add several additional table games: by Spring 2011 Rivers Casino will have a total of 107 games. The Casino is also in the process of adding a $2 million ballroom in a massive corner space on the second floor, with views of the riverfront and Downtown skyline. It is expected to be ready by late summer 2011. As of 2018, Rivers Casino includes a 30-table non-smoking poker room.

The term is also applied to the social behavior of some animals, referring to the state of having only one mate at any one time.

Monogamy in Merriam-Webster Dictionary The term \\"monogamy\\" may be referring to one of various relational types, depending upon context. Generally, there are four overlapping definitions. * marital monogamy refers to marriages of only two people. * social monogamy refers to two partners living together, having sex with each other, and cooperating in acquiring basic resources such as shelter, food and money. * sexual monogamy refers to two partners remaining sexually exclusive with each other and having no outside sex partners. * genetic monogamy refers to sexually monogamous relationships with genetic evidence of paternity. For instance, biologists, biological anthropologists, and behavioral ecologists often use monogamy in the sense of sexual, if not genetic (reproductive), exclusivity.Low B.S. (2003) Ecological and social complexities in human monogamy . Monogamy: Mating Strategies and Partnerships in Birds, Humans and Other Mammals:161‚Äì176. When cultural or social anthropologists and other social scientists use the term monogamy, the meaning is social or marital monogamy. Marital monogamy may be further distinguished between: # classical monogamy, \\"a single relationship between people who marry as virgins, remain sexually exclusive their entire lives, and become celibate upon the death of the partner\\" # serial monogamy, marriage with only one other person at a time, in contrast to bigamy or polygamy; Frequency in humans Kashubian married couple located in Kaszubski square, Gdynia, Poland, which commemorates their monogamous fidelity, through the time of their separation, while he temporarily worked in the United States. Distribution of social monogamy According to the Ethnographic Atlas by George P. Murdock, of 1,231 societies from around the world noted, 186 were monogamous; 453 had occasional polygyny; 588 had more frequent polygyny; and 4 had polyandry.Ethnographic Atlas Codebook derived from George P. Murdock‚Äôs Ethnographic Atlas recording the marital composition of 1231 societies from 1960 to 1980 (This does not take into account the relative population of each of the societies studied; the actual practice of polygamy in a tolerant society may actually be low, with the majority of aspirant polygamists practicing monogamous marriage.) Divorce and remarriage can thus result in \\"serial monogamy\\", i.e. multiple marriages but only one legal spouse at a time. This can be interpreted as a form of plural mating, as are those societies dominated by female-headed families in the Caribbean, Mauritius and Brazil where there is frequent rotation of unmarried partners. In all, these account for 16 to 24% of the \\"monogamous\\" category. Prevalence of sexual monogamy The prevalence of sexual monogamy can be roughly estimated as the percentage of married people who do not engage in extramarital sex. The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample describes the amount of extramarital sex by men and women in over 50 pre-industrial cultures.Divale, W. (2000). Pre-Coded Variables for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, Volume I and II . Jamaica, NY: York College, CUNY. Distributed by World Cultures. See Variable 170 and Variable 171. The amount of extramarital sex by men is described as \\"universal\\" in 6 cultures, \\"moderate\\" in 29 cultures, \\"occasional\\" in 6 cultures, and \\"uncommon\\" in 10 cultures. The amount of extramarital sex by women is described as \\"universal\\" in 6 cultures, \\"moderate\\" in 23 cultures, \\"occasional\\" in 9 cultures, and \\"uncommon\\" in 15 cultures. Surveys conducted in non-Western nations (2001) also found cultural and gender differences in extramarital sex. A study of sexual behavior in Thailand, Tanzania and C√¥te d'Ivoire suggests about 16‚Äì34% of men engage in extramarital sex while a much smaller (unreported) percentage of women engage in extramarital sex. Studies in Nigeria have found around 47‚Äì53% of men and to 18‚Äì36% of women engage in extramarital sex. A 1999 survey of married and cohabiting couples in Zimbabwe reports that 38% of men and 13% of women engaged in extra-couple sexual relationships within the last 12 months.National AIDS Council, Ministry of Health and Child Welfare, The MEASURE Project, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC/Zimbabwe). AIDS in Africa During the Nineties: Zimbabwe. A review and analysis of survey and research results. Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2002. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples: surveys given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples may not accurately reflect the population of the United States as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. Sampling bias may, therefore, be why early surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results: such early studies using convenience samples (1974, 1983, 1993) reported the wide ranges of 12‚Äì26% of married women and 15‚Äì43% of married men engaged in extramarital sex.Hunt, M. (1974). Sexual behavior in the 1970s. Chicago: Playboy Press.Blumstein, P., & Schwartz, P. (1983). American Couples: Money, Work, Sex.

Three studies have used nationally representative samples. These studies (1994, 1997) found that about 10‚Äì15% of women and 20‚Äì25% of men engage in extramarital sex.Laumann, E. O., Gagnon, J. H., Michael, R. T, & Michaels, S. (1994). The social organization of sexuality: Sexual practices in the United States . Chicago: University of Chicago Press. Research by Colleen Hoffon of 566 homosexual male couples from the San Francisco Bay Area (2010) found that 45% had monogamous relationships. However, the Human Rights Campaign has stated, based on a Rockway Institute report, that \\"GLBT young people‚Ä¶ want to spend their adult life in a long-term relationship raising children.\\" Specifically, over 80% of the homosexuals surveyed expected to be in a monogamous relationship after age 30. Prevalence of genetic monogamy The incidence of genetic monogamy may be estimated from rates of extrapair paternity. Extrapair paternity is when offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with another male. Rates of extrapair paternity have not been extensively studied in people. Many reports of extrapair paternity are little more than quotes based on hearsay, anecdotes, and unpublished findings. Simmons, Firman, Rhodes, and Peters reviewed 11 published studies of extra-pair paternity from various locations in the United States, France, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Mexico, and among the native Yanomami Indians of Amazon forest in South America. The rates of extrapair paternity ranged from 0.03% to 11.8% although most of the locations had low percentages of extrapair paternity. The median rate of extrapair paternity was 1.8%. A separate review of 17 studies by Bellis, Hughes, Hughes, and Ashton found slightly higher rates of extrapair paternity. The rates varied from 0.8% to 30% in these studies, with a median rate of 3.7% extrapair paternity. A range of 1.8% to 3.7% extrapair paternity implies a range of 96% to 98% genetic monogamy. Although the incidence of genetic monogamy may vary from 70% to 99% in different cultures or social environments, a large percentage of couples remain genetically monogamous during their relationships. A review paper, surveying 67 other studies, reported rates of extrapair paternity, in different societies, ranging from 0.4% to over 50%. Covert illegitimacy is a situation which arises when someone who is presumed to be a child's father (or mother) is in fact not the biological father (or mother). Frequencies as high as 30% are sometimes assumed in the media, but research by sociologist Michael Gilding traced these overestimates back to an informal remark at a 1972 conference.Philipp EE (1973) \\"Discussion: moral, social and ethical issues\\". In: Wolstenholme GEW, Fitzsimons DW, eds. Law and ethics of AID and embryo transfer. Ciba Foundation symposium. Vol 17. London: Associated Scientific 63‚Äì66 The detection of unsuspected illegitimacy can occur in the context of medical genetic screening, in genetic family name research, and in immigration testing. Such studies show that covert illegitimacy is in fact less than 10% among the sampled African populations, less than 5% among the sampled Native American and Polynesian populations, less than 2% of the sampled Middle Eastern population, and generally 1%‚Äì2% among European samples. Pedigree errors are a well-known source of error in medical studies. When attempts are made to try to study medical afflictions and their genetic components, it becomes very important to understand non-paternity rates and pedigree errors. There are numerous software packages and procedures that exist for correcting research data for pedigree errors.

University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh. and it is important to understand how these marriage systems might have evolved. In any species, there are three main aspects that combine to promote a monogamous mating system: paternal care, resource access, and mate-choice; however, in humans, the main theoretical sources of monogamy are paternal care and extreme ecological stresses. Paternal care should be particularly important in humans due to the extra nutritional requirement of having larger brains and the lengthier developmental period.Barrett L, Dunbar RIM, Lycett J (2002) Human evolutionary psychology. Palgrave, Basingstoke. Therefore, the evolution of monogamy could be a reflection of this increased need for bi- parental care. Similarly, monogamy should evolve in areas of ecological stress because male reproductive success should be higher if their resources are focused on ensuring offspring survival rather than searching for other mates. However, the evidence does not support these claims. Due to the extreme sociality and increased intelligence of humans, H. sapiens have solved many problems that generally lead to monogamy, such as those mentioned above. For example, monogamy is certainly correlated with paternal care, as shown by Marlowe, but not caused by it because humans diminish the need for bi-parental care through the aid of siblings and other family members in rearing the offspring. Furthermore, human intelligence and material culture allows for better adaptation to different and rougher ecological areas, thus reducing the causation and even correlation of monogamous marriage and extreme climates. However, some scientists argue that monogamy evolved by reducing within-group conflict, thus giving certain groups a competitive advantage against less monogamous groups. Paleoanthropology and genetic studies offer two perspectives on when monogamy evolved in the human species: paleoanthropologists offer tentative evidence that monogamy may have evolved very early in human history whereas genetic studies suggest that monogamy might have evolved much more recently, less than 10,000 to 20,000 years ago. Orangutan males are not monogamous and compete for access to females. Paleoanthropological estimates of the time frame for the evolution of monogamy are primarily based on the level of sexual dimorphism seen in the fossil record because, in general, the reduced male-male competition seen in monogamous mating results in reduced sexual dimorphism.Moller AP (2003) The evolution of monogamy: mating relationships, parental care and sexual selection. Monogamy: Mating Strategies and Partnerships in Birds, Humans and Other Mammals:29‚Äì41. According to Reno et al., the sexual dimorphism of Australopithecus afarensis, a human ancestor from approximately 3.9‚Äì3.0 million years ago,Ash P, Robinson D (2010) The emergence of humans: an exploration of the evolutionary timeline . Wiley-Blackwell, Chichester, West Sussex, UK ;Hoboken, NJ. was within the modern human range, based on dental and postcranial morphology. Although careful not to say that this indicates monogamous mating in early hominids, the authors do say that reduced levels of sexual dimorphism in A. afarensis \\"do not imply that monogamy is any less probable than polygyny\\". However, Gordon, Green and Richmond claim that in examining postcranial remains, A. afarensis is more sexually dimorphic than modern humans and chimpanzees with levels closer to those of orangutans and gorillas. Furthermore, Homo habilis, living approximately 2.3 mya, is the most sexually dimorphic early hominid. Plavcan and van Schaik conclude their examination of this controversy by stating that, overall, sexual dimorphism in australopithecines is not indicative of any behavioral implications or mating systems. Cultural arguments Plough agriculture. The castle in the background is Lusignan. Detail from the calendar Les tr√®s riches heures from the 15th century. This is a detail from the painting for March. Despite the human ability to avoid sexual and genetic monogamy, social monogamy still forms under many different conditions, but most of those conditions are consequences of cultural processes. These cultural processes may have nothing to do with relative reproductive success. For example, anthropologist Jack Goody's comparative study utilizing the Ethnographic Atlas demonstrated that monogamy is part of a cultural complex found in the broad swath of Eurasian societies from Japan to Ireland that practice social monogamy, sexual monogamy and dowry (i.e. \\"diverging devolution\\", that allow property to be inherited by children of both sexes). Goody demonstrates a statistical correlation between this cultural complex and the development of intensive plough agriculture in those areas. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in intensive plough agriculture and extensive shifting horticulture. In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work and is associated with private property; marriage tends to be monogamous to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family (endogamy) are the preferred marriage partners to keep property within the group. A molecular genetic study of global human genetic diversity argued that sexual polygyny was typical of human reproductive patterns until the shift to sedentary farming communities approximately 10,000 to 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, and more recently in Africa and the Americas. A further study drawing on the Ethnographic Atlas showed a statistical correlation between increasing size of the society, the belief in \\"high gods\\" to support human morality, and monogamy. A survey of other cross-cultural samples has confirmed that the absence of the plough was the only predictor of polygamy, although other factors such as high male mortality in warfare (in non-state societies) and pathogen stress (in state societies) had some impact. Woman farming, using a digging stick in the Nuba Mountains, southern Sudan Betzig postulated that culture/society can also be a source of social monogamy by enforcing it through rules and laws set by third-party actors, usually in order to protect the wealth or power of the elite. For example, Augustus Caesar encouraged marriage and reproduction to force the aristocracy to divide their wealth and power among multiple heirs, but the aristocrats kept their socially monogamous, legitimate children to a minimum to ensure their legacy while having many extra-pair copulations. Similarly‚Äîaccording to Betzig‚Äîthe Christian Church enforced monogamy because wealth passed to the closest living, legitimate male relative, often resulting in the wealthy oldest brother being without a male heir. Thus, the wealth and power of the family would pass to the ‚Äúcelibate‚Äù younger brother of the church. In both of these instances, the rule-making elite used cultural processes to ensure greater reproductive fitness for themselves and their offspring, leading to a larger genetic influence in future generations. Furthermore, the laws of the Christian Church, in particular, were important in the evolution of social monogamy in humans. They allowed, even encouraged, poor men to marry and produce offspring, which reduced the gap in reproductive success between the rich and poor, thus resulting in the quick spread of monogamous marriage systems in the western world. According to B. S. Low, culture would appear to have a much larger impact on monogamy in humans than the biological forces that are important for non-human animals. Other theorists use cultural factors influencing reproductive success to explain monogamy. During times of major economic/demographic transitions, investing more in fewer offspring (social monogamy not polygyny) increases reproductive success by ensuring the offspring themselves have enough initial wealth to be successful. This is seen in both England and Sweden during the industrial revolution and is currently being seen in the modernization of rural Ethiopia. Similarly, in modern industrialized societies, fewer yet better-invested offspring, i.e. social monogamy, can provide a reproductive advantage over social polygyny, but this still allows for serial monogamy and extra-pair copulations. Arguments from outside the scientific community Karol Wojty≈Ça (later, Pope John Paul II) in his book Love and Responsibility postulated that monogamy, as an institutional union of two people being in love with one another, was an embodiment of an ethical personalistic norm, and thus the only means of making true human love possible. Some writers have suggested that monogamy may solve the problems they view as associated with non-monogamy and hypergamy such as inceldom. Alexandra Kollontai in Make Way for the Winged Eros argues that monogamy is an artifact of capitalist concepts of property and inheritance and wrote, \\"The social aims of the working class are not affected one bit by whether love takes the form of a long and official union or is expressed in a temporary relationship. The ideology of the working class does not place any formal limits on love.\\" Later, \\"Modern love always sins, because it absorbs the thoughts and feelings of 'loving hearts' and isolates the loving pair from the collective. In the future society, such a separation will not only become superfluous but also psychologically inconceivable.\\" One of the tenets of the new proletarian morality is \\"mutual recognition of the rights of the other, of the fact that one does not own the heart and soul of the other (the sense of property, encouraged by bourgeois culture).\\" Ancient societies The historical record offers contradictory evidence on the development and extent of monogamy as a social practice. Laura Betzig argues that in the six large, highly stratified early states, commoners were generally monogamous but that elites practiced de facto polygyny. Those states included Mesopotamia, Egypt, Aztec Mexico, Inca Peru, India and China. =Tribal societies= Monogamy has appeared in some traditional tribal societies such as the Andamanese, Karen in Burma, Sami and Ket in northern Eurasia, and the Pueblo Indians of the United States, apparently unrelated to the development of the Judeo- Christian monogamous paradigm.The Ethnographic Atlas, George P. Murdock =Ancient Mesopotamia and Assyria= Both the Babylonian and Assyrian families were monogamous in principle but not entirely so in practice since polygyny was frequently practiced by the rulers. In the patriarchal society of Mesopotamia the nuclear family was called a \\"house\\". In order \\"to build a house\\" a man was supposed to marry one woman and if she did not provide him with offspring, he could take a second wife. The Code of Hammurabi states that he loses his right to do so if the wife herself gives him a slave as concubine.Cf. R. de Vaux, Ancient Israel. Its Life and Institutions, London 1980 (5th impr.), p. 24 According to Old Assyrian texts, he could be obliged to wait for two or three years before he was allowed to take another wife. The position of the second wife was that of a \\"slave girl\\" in respect to the first wife, as many marriage contracts explicitly state.M. Stol: Private Life in Ancient Mesopotamia, in: Civilizations of the Ancient Near East. J. M. Sasson (ed.), J. Baines, G. Beckman, K. S. Rubinson (assist. ed.). Vol. 1. New York: Simon & Schuster Macmillan, 1995, pp. 488‚Äì493. ; Cf. Martha T. Roth, Age at Marriage and the Household: A Study of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian Forms , ‚ÄúComparative Studies in Society and History‚Äù 29 (1987), and Babylonian Marriage Agreements 7th‚Äì3rd Centuries BC (1989). =Ancient Egypt= Although an Egyptian man was free to marry several women at a time, and some wealthy men from Old and Middle Kingdoms did have more than one wife, monogamy was the norm.G. Pinch: \\"Egyptian society seems to have been based on the \\"conjugal household.\\" The basic family unit consisted of a man and a woman living together and any children they might have\\". Private Life in Ancient Egypt in: Civilizations of the Ancient Near East, pp. 370‚Äì71 There may have been some exceptions, e.g. a Nineteenth Dynasty official stated as proof of his love to his deceased wife that he had stayed married to her since their youth, even after he had become very successful (P. Leiden I 371). This may suggest that some men abandoned first wives of a low social status and married women of higher status in order to further their careers although even then they lived with only one wife. Egyptian women had right to ask for a divorce if her husband took a second wife. Many tomb reliefs testify to monogamous character of Egyptian marriages, officials are usually accompanied by a supportive wife. \\"His wife X, his beloved\\" is the standard phrase identifying wives in tomb inscriptions. The instruction texts belonging to wisdom literature, e.g. Instruction of Ptahhotep or Instruction of Any, support fidelity to monogamous marriage life, calling the wife a Lady of the house. The Instruction of Ankhsheshonq suggests that it is wrong to abandon a wife because of her barrenness.Pinch Geraldine, Private Life in Ancient Egypt in: =Ancient Israel= As against Betzig's contention that monogamy evolved as a result of Christian socio-economic influence in the West, monogamy appeared widespread in the ancient Middle East much earlier. In Israel's pre-Christian era, an essentially monogamous ethos underlay the Jewish creation story (Gn 2) and the last chapter of Proverbs. During the Second Temple period (530 BCE to 70 CE), apart from an economic situation which supported monogamy even more than in earlier period, the concept of \\"mutual fidelity\\" between husband and wife was a quite common reason for strictly monogamous marriages. Some marriage documents explicitly expressed a desire for the marriage to remain monogamous. Examples of these documents were found in Elephantine. They resemble those found in neighbouring Assyria and Babylonia. Study shows that ancient Middle East societies, though not strictly monogamous, were practically (at least on commoners' level) monogamous. Halakha of the Dead Sea Sect saw prohibition of polygamy as coming from the Pentateuch (Damascus Document 4:20‚Äì5:5, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls). Christianity adopted a similar attitude (cf. 1 Tm 3:2,12; Tt 1:6), which conformed with Jesus' approach. Michael Coogan, in contrast, states that \\"Polygyny continued to be practised well into the biblical period, and it is attested among Jews as late as the second century CE.\\" Under Judges and the monarchy, old restrictions went into disuse, especially among royalty, though the Books of Samuel and Kings, which cover entire period of monarchy, do not record a single case of bigamy among commoners ‚Äî except for Samuel's father. The wisdom books e.g. Book of Wisdom, which provides a picture of the society, Sirach, Proverbs, Qohelet portray a woman in a strictly monogamous family (cf. Pr 5:15-19; Qo 9:9; Si 26:1-4 and eulogy of perfect wife, Proverbs 31:10-31). The Book of Tobias speaks solely of monogamous marriages. Also prophets have in front of their eyes monogamous marriage as an image of the relationship of God and Israel. (Cf. Ho 2:4f; Jer 2:2; Is 50:1; 54:6-7; 62:4-5; Ez 16). Roland de Vaux states that \\"it is clear that the most common form of marriage in Israel was monogamy\\". The Mishnah and the baraitot clearly reflect a monogamist viewpoint within Judaism (Yevamot 2:10 etc.). Some sages condemned marriage to two wives even for the purpose of procreation (Ketubot 62b). R. Ammi, an amora states: > Whoever takes a second wife in addition to his first one shall divorce the > first and pay her kettubah (Yevamot 65a) Roman customs, which prohibited polygamy, may have enhanced such an attitude - especially after 212 AD, when all the Jews became Roman citizens. However, some Jews continued to practice bigamy (e.g. up to medieval times in Egypt and Europe). Fourth-century Roman law forbade Jews to contract plural marriages. A synod convened by Gershom ben Judah around 1000 CE banned polygamy among Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews.Walter Scheidel, Monogamy and polygyny in Greece, Rome, and world history , Princeton/Stanford Working Papers in Classics, June 2008 = Ancient Greece and ancient Rome = The ancient Greeks and Romans were monogamous in the sense that men were not allowed to have more than one wife or to cohabit with concubines during marriage.Scheidel W. 2009.

History Family14, 280‚Äì291 (doi:10.1016/j.hisfam.2009.06.001)10.1016/j.hisfam.2009.06.001 =Early Christianity= According to Jesus Christ monogamy was a primordial will of the Creator described in Genesis, darkened by the hardness of hearts of the Israelites. As John Paul II interpreted the dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees (Gospel of Matthew 19:3‚Äì8), Christ emphasized the primordial beauty of monogamic spousal love described in the Book of Genesis 1:26‚Äì31, 2:4‚Äì25, whereby a man and woman by their nature are each ready to be a beautifying, total and personal gift to one another: > Jesus avoids entangling himself in juridical or casuistic controversies; > instead, he appeals twice to the \\"beginning\\".

(...) it clearly leads the interlocutors to reflect about the way in > which, in the mystery of creation, man was formed precisely as \\"male and > female,\\" in order to understand correctly the normative meaning of the words > of Genesis. Contemporary societiesInternational= Western European societies established monogamy as their marital norm.MacDonald K. The establishment and maintenance of socially imposed monogamy in Western Europe . Politics Life Sci. 1995. 14, 3‚Äì23 Monogamous marriage is normative and is legally enforced in most developed countries. Laws prohibiting polygyny were adopted in Japan (1880), China (1953), India (1955) and Nepal (1963). Polyandry is illegal in most countries. The women's rights movements seek to make monogamy the only legal form of marriage. The United Nations General Assembly in 1979 adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, Article 16 of which requires nations to give women and men equal rights in marriage. Polygamy is viewed as inconsistent with the Article as it gives men the right of multiple wives, but not to women. The United Nations has established the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) to monitor the progress of nations implementing the convention. =People's Republic of China= The founders of Communism determined that monogamous marriage inherently oppressed women and therefore had no place in communist society. Friedrich Engels stated that compulsory monogamy could only lead to increased prostitution and general immorality, with the benefits of restricting capital and solidifying the class structure. As he spelled out in The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State (1884), > The first class antagonism which appears in history coincides with the > development of the antagonism between man and woman in monogamian marriage, > and the first class oppression with that of the female sex by the male. > ‚Ä¶[T]he wellbeing and development of the one group are attained by the misery > and repression of the other. The monogamous family is distinguished from the > pairing family by the far greater durability of wedlock, which can no longer > be dissolved at the pleasure of either party.

However, the communist revolutionaries in China chose to take the Western viewpoint of monogamy as giving women and men equal rights in marriage. The newly formed Communist government established monogamy as the only legal form of marriage. > \\"The 1950 Marriage Law called for sweeping changes in many areas of family > life.

While the protocol does not suggest making polygamous marriage illegal, Article 6 does state that \\"monogamy is encouraged as the preferred form of marriage and that the rights of women in marriage and family, including in polygamous marital relationships are promoted and protected.\\"Amnesty International, 2006.

Varieties in biology Recent discoveries have led biologists to talk about the three varieties of monogamy: social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy. The distinction between these three are important to the modern understanding of monogamy. Monogamous pairs of animals are not always sexually exclusive. Many animals that form pairs to mate and raise offspring regularly engage in sexual activities with partners other than their primary mate. This is called extra-pair copulation.  * Sometimes these extra-pair sexual activities lead to offspring. Genetic tests frequently show that some of the offspring raised by a monogamous pair come from the female mating with an extra-pair male partner. These discoveries have led biologists to adopt new ways of talking about monogamy: Whatever makes a pair of animals socially monogamous does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations. Social monogamy does not always involve marriage in humans. A married couple is almost always a socially monogamous couple. But couples who choose to cohabit without getting married can also be socially monogamous. The popular science author Matt Ridley in his book The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature, described the human mating system as \\"monogamy plagued by adultery\\". Serial monogamy Serial monogamy is a mating practice in which individuals may engage in sequential monogamous pairings,Wright R (1994) The moral animal: the new science of evolutionary psychology. Pantheon Books, New York. or in terms of humans, when men or women can marry another partner but only after ceasing to be married to the previous partner. One theory is that this pattern pacifies the elite men and equalizes reproductive success. This is called the Male Compromise Theory. Such serial monogamy may effectively resemble polygyny in its reproductive consequences because some men are able to utilize more than one woman's reproductive lifespan through repeated marriages. Serial monogamy may also refer to sequential sexual relationships, irrespective of marital status. A pair of humans may remain sexually exclusive, or monogamous, until the relationship has ended and then each may go on to form a new exclusive pairing with a different partner. This pattern of serial monogamy is common among people in Western cultures. =Reproductive success= Evolutionary theory predicts that males would be apt to seek more mating partners than females because they obtain higher reproductive benefits from such a strategy. Men with more serial marriages are likely to have more children than men with only one spouse, whereas the same is not true of women with consecutive spouses. A study done in 1994 found that remarried men often had a larger age difference from their spouses than men who were married for the first time, suggesting that serial monogamy helps some men extract a longer reproductive window from their spouses. =Breakup= Serial monogamy has always been closely linked to divorce practices. Whenever procedures for obtaining divorce have been simple and easy, serial monogamy has been found.It is said to have been \\"rife\\" in ancient Rome Alternative Forms of Marriage Serial Monogamy at Trivia- Library.com. As divorce has continued to become more accessible, more individuals have availed themselves of it, and many go on to remarry.In Canada, 46% of divorc√©es will remarry according to Till death do us part? The risk of first and second marriage dissolution by Warren Clark and Susan Crompton. Barry Schwartz, author of The Paradox of Choice: Why less is more, further suggests that Western culture's inundation of choice has devalued relationships based on lifetime commitments and singularity of choice. It has been suggested, however, that high mortality rates in centuries past accomplished much the same result as divorce, enabling remarriage (of one spouse) and thus serial monogamy.Timothy J. Owston, Divorce. 2nd edition, April 2006 Mating system Monogamy is one of several mating systems observed in animals. However, a pair of animals may be socially monogamous but that does not necessarily make them sexually or genetically monogamous. Social monogamy, sexual monogamy, and genetic monogamy can occur in different combinations. Social monogamy refers to the overtly observed living arrangement whereby a male and female share territory and engage in behaviour indicative of a social pair, but does not imply any particular sexual fidelity or reproductive pattern. The extent to which social monogamy is observed in animals varies across taxa, with over 90 percent of avian species being socially monogamous, compared to only 3 percent of mammalian species and up to 15 percent of primate species.Barash, D.P. & Lipton, J.E. (2001). The Myth of Monogamy. New York, NY: W.H. Freeman and Company. Social monogamy has also been observed in reptiles, fish, and insects. Sexual monogamy is defined as an exclusive sexual relationship between a female and a male based on observations of sexual interactions. However, scientific analyses can test for paternity, for example by DNA paternity testing or by fluorescent pigment powder tracing of females to track physical contact. This type of analysis can uncover reproductively successful sexual pairings or physical contact. Genetic monogamy refers to DNA analyses confirming that a female-male pair reproduce exclusively with each other. The incidence of sexual monogamy appears quite rare in other parts of the animal kingdom. It is becoming clear that even animals that are overtly socially monogamous engage in extra-pair copulations. For example, while over 90% of birds are socially monogamous, \\"on average, 30 percent or more of the baby birds in any nest [are] sired by someone other than the resident male.\\"Angier, Natalie (1990-08-21). \\"Mating for Life? It's Not for the Birds of the Bees \\" (\\"of\\" rather than \\"or\\" is how it shows in the article !). The New York Times. Patricia Adair Gowaty has estimated that, out of 180 different species of socially monogamous songbirds, only 10% are sexually monogamous. Offspring are far more successful when both the male and the female members of the social pair contribute food resources. An example of this was seen when scientists studied red winged blackbirds. These birds are known for remaining in monogamous relationships during the course of mating season. During the course of the study, the researchers gave a few select males vasectomies just before mating season. The male birds behaved like they do every season, establishing territory, finding a mate, and attempting to make baby birds. Despite apparent social monogamy, the female birds whose partners were surgically altered still became pregnant, indicating that overt social monogamy did not predict for sexual fidelity. These babies were cared for by their sterile adoptive fathers. The highest known frequency of reproductively successful extra-pair copulations are found among fairywrens Malurus splendens and Malurus cyaneus where more than 65 percent of chicks are fathered by males outside the supposed breeding pair. This discordantly low level of genetic monogamy has been a surprise to biologists and zoologists, as social monogamy can no longer be assumed to determine how genes are distributed in a species. Elacatinus, also widely known as neon gobies, also exhibit social monogamy. Hetereosexual pairs of fish belonging to the genus Elacatinus remain closely associated during both reproductive and non- reproductive periods, and often reside in same cleaning station to serve client fish. Fish of this genus frequently mate with a new partner after they are widowed. Evolution in animals Socially monogamous species are scattered throughout the animal kingdom: A few insects, a few fish, about nine-tenths of birds, and a few mammals are socially monogamous. There is even a parasitic worm, Schistosoma mansoni, that in its female-male pairings in the human body is monogamous. The diversity of species with social monogamy suggests that it is not inherited from a common ancestor but instead evolved independently in many different species. The low occurrence of social monogamy in placental mammals has been claimed to be related to the presence or absence of estrus‚Äîor oestrus‚Äîthe duration of sexual receptivity of a female. This, however, doesn't explain why estrus females generally mate with any proximate male nor any correlation between sexual and social monogamy. Birds, which are notable for a high incidence of social monogamy, do not have estrus. Researchers have observed a mixed mating system of monogamy and polygyny in the European pied flycatcher. PsychologyGenetic and neuroendocrine bases The prairie vole is an animal example for its monogamous social behaviour, since the male is usually socially faithful to the female, and shares in the raising of pups. The woodland vole is also usually monogamous. Another species from the same genus, the meadow vole, has promiscuously mating males, and scientists have changed adult male meadow voles' behaviour to resemble that of prairie voles in experiments in which a single gene was introduced into the brain by a virus. Referenced in The behaviour is influenced by the number of repetitions of a particular string of microsatellite DNA. Male prairie voles with the longest DNA strings spend more time with their mates and pups than male prairie voles with shorter strings. Summarized in However, other scientists have disputed the gene's relationship to monogamy, and cast doubt on whether the human version plays an analogous role. Physiologically, pair-bonding behavior has been shown to be connected to vasopressin, dopamine, and oxytocin levels, with the genetic influence apparently arising via the number of receptors for these substances in the brain; the pair-bonding behavior has also been shown in experiments to be strongly modifiable by administering some of these substances directly. The North American microtine rodent's (vole) complex social structure and social behavior has provided unique opportunities to study the underlying neural bases for monogamy and social attachment. Data from studies using the Microtus ochrogaster or prairie vole indicate that the neuroendocrine hormones, oxytocin (in female prairie voles) and vasopressin (in male prairie voles) play a central role in the development of affiliative connections during mating. The effects of intracerebroventricular administration of oxytocin and vasopressin have been shown to promote affiliative behavior in the prairie vole but not in similar, but non-monogamous montane voles. This difference in neuropeptide effect is attributed to the location, density, and distribution of OT and AVP receptors. Only in the prairie voles are OT and AVP receptors located along the mesolimbic dopamine reward pathway, presumably conditioning the voles to their mates odor while consolidating the social memory of the mating episode. This finding highlights the role of genetic evolution in altering the neuroanatomical distribution of receptors, resulting in certain neural circuits becoming sensitive to changes in neuropeptides.

It proscribes conduct perceived as threatening, harmful, or otherwise endangering to the property, health, safety, and moral welfare of people inclusive of one's self. Most criminal law is established by statute, which is to say that the laws are enacted by a legislature. Criminal law includes the punishment and rehabilitation of people who violate such laws. Criminal law varies according to jurisdiction, and differs from civil law, where emphasis is more on dispute resolution and victim compensation, rather than on punishment or rehabilitation. Criminal procedure is a formalized official activity that authenticates the fact of commission of a crime and authorizes punitive or rehabilitative treatment of the offender. History The first civilizations generally did not distinguish between civil law and criminal law. The first written codes of law were designed by the Sumerians. Around 2100‚Äì2050 BC Ur- Nammu, the Neo-Sumerian king of Ur, enacted written legal code whose text has been discovered: the Code of Ur-NammuKramer, Samuel Noah. (1971) The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character, p.4, University of Chicago although an earlier code of Urukagina of Lagash ( 2380‚Äì2360 BC ) is also known to have existed. Another important early code was the Code of Hammurabi, which formed the core of Babylonian law. Only fragments of the early criminal laws of Ancient Greece have survived, e.g. those of Solon and Draco. The Old Bailey in London (in 1808) was the venue for more than 100,000 criminal trials between 1674 and 1834, including all death penalty cases. In Roman law, Gaius's Commentaries on the Twelve Tables also conflated the civil and criminal aspects, treating theft (furtum) as a tort. Assault and violent robbery were analogized to trespass as to property. Breach of such laws created an obligation of law or vinculum juris discharged by payment of monetary compensation or damages. The criminal law of imperial Rome is collected in Books 47‚Äì48 of the Digest.Criminal Law. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition. After the revival of Roman law in the 12th century, sixth- century Roman classifications and jurisprudence provided the foundations of the distinction between criminal and civil law in European law from then until the present time.\\"Law, Criminal Procedure,\\" Dictionary of the Middle Ages: Supplement 1, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons-Thompson-Gale, 2004: 309‚Äì320 The first signs of the modern distinction between crimes and civil matters emerged during the Norman Invasion of England.see, Pennington, Kenneth (1993) The Prince and the Law, 1200‚Äì1600: Sovereignty and Rights in the Western Legal Tradition, University of California Press The special notion of criminal penalty, at least concerning Europe, arose in Spanish Late Scholasticism (see Alfonso de Castro), when the theological notion of God's penalty (poena aeterna) that was inflicted solely for a guilty mind, became transfused into canon law first and, finally, to secular criminal law.Harald Maihold, Strafe f√ºr fremde Schuld? Die Systematisierung des Strafbegriffs in der Spanischen Sp√§tscholastik und Naturrechtslehre, K√∂ln u.a. 2005 The development of the state dispensing justice in a court clearly emerged in the eighteenth century when European countries began maintaining police services. From this point, criminal law formalized the mechanisms for enforcement, which allowed for its development as a discernible entity. Objectives of criminal law Criminal law is distinctive for the uniquely serious, potential consequences or sanctions for failure to abide by its rules. Every crime is composed of criminal elements. Capital punishment may be imposed in some jurisdictions for the most serious crimes. Physical or corporal punishment may be imposed such as whipping or caning, although these punishments are prohibited in much of the world. Individuals may be incarcerated in prison or jail in a variety of conditions depending on the jurisdiction. Confinement may be solitary. Length of incarceration may vary from a day to life. Government supervision may be imposed, including house arrest, and convicts may be required to conform to particularized guidelines as part of a parole or probation regimen. Fines also may be imposed, seizing money or property from a person convicted of a crime. Five objectives are widely accepted for enforcement of the criminal law by punishments: retribution, deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and restoration. Jurisdictions differ on the value to be placed on each. *Retribution ‚Äì Criminals ought to Be Punished in some way. This is the most widely seen goal. Criminals have taken improper advantage, or inflicted unfair detriment, upon others and consequently, the criminal law will put criminals at some unpleasant disadvantage to \\"balance the scales.\\" People submit to the law to receive the right not to be murdered and if people contravene these laws, they surrender the rights granted to them by the law. Thus, one who murders may be executed himself. A related theory includes the idea of \\"righting the balance.\\" *Deterrence ‚Äì Individual deterrence is aimed toward the specific offender. The aim is to impose a sufficient penalty to discourage the offender from criminal behavior. General deterrence aims at society at large. By imposing a penalty on those who commit offenses, other individuals are discouraged from committing those offenses. *Incapacitation ‚Äì Designed simply to keep criminals away from society so that the public is protected from their misconduct. This is often achieved through prison sentences today. The death penalty or banishment have served the same purpose. *Rehabilitation ‚Äì Aims at transforming an offender into a valuable member of society. Its primary goal is to prevent further offense by convincing the offender that their conduct was wrong. *Restoration ‚Äì This is a victim-oriented theory of punishment. The goal is to repair, through state authority, any injury inflicted upon the victim by the offender. For example, one who embezzles will be required to repay the amount improperly acquired. Restoration is commonly combined with other main goals of criminal justice and is closely related to concepts in the civil law, i.e., returning the victim to his or her original position before the injury. Selected criminal laws Many laws are enforced by threat of criminal punishment, and the range of the punishment varies with the jurisdiction. The scope of criminal law is too vast to catalog intelligently. Nevertheless, the following are some of the more typical aspects of criminal law. Elements The criminal law generally prohibits undesirable acts. Thus, proof of a crime requires proof of some act. Scholars label this the requirement of an actus reus or guilty act. Some crimes ‚Äì particularly modern regulatory offenses ‚Äì require no more, and they are known as strict liability offenses (E.g. Under the Road traffic Act 1988 it is a strict liability offence to drive a vehicle with an alcohol concentration above the prescribed limit). Nevertheless, because of the potentially severe consequences of criminal conviction, judges at common law also sought proof of an intent to do some bad thing, the mens rea or guilty mind. As to crimes of which both actus reus and mens rea are requirements, judges have concluded that the elements must be present at precisely the same moment and it is not enough that they occurred sequentially at different times.This is demonstrated by R v. Church [1966] 1 QB 59. Mr. Church had a fight with a woman which rendered her unconscious. He attempted to revive her, but gave up, believing her to be dead. He threw her, still alive, in a nearby river, where she drowned. The court held that Mr. Church was not guilty of murder (because he did not ever desire to kill her), but was guilty of manslaughter. The \\"chain of events,\\" his act of throwing her into the water and his desire to hit her, coincided. In this manner, it does not matter when a guilty mind and act coincide, as long as at some point they do. See also, Fagan v. Metropolitan Police Commissioner [1968] 3 All ER 442, where angry Mr Fagan would not take his car off a policeman's foot Actus reus An English court room in 1886, with Lord Chief Justice Coleridge presiding Actus reus is Latin for \\"guilty act\\" and is the physical element of committing a crime. It may be accomplished by an action, by threat of action, or exceptionally, by an omission to act, which is a legal duty to act. For example, the act of A striking B might suffice, or a parent's failure to give food to a young child also may provide the actus reus for a crime. Where the actus reus is a failure to act, there must be a duty of care. A duty can arise through contract,R v. Pittwood (1902) 19 TLR 37 ‚Äì a railway worker who omitted to shut the crossing gates, convicted of manslaughter when someone was run over by a train a voluntary undertaking,e.g. the partner in Gibbons who was not a blood parent, but had assumed a duty of care a blood relation with whom one lives,R v. Stone and Dobinson [1977] QB 354, where an ill tended sister named Fanny could not leave bed, was not cared for at all and literally rotted in her own filth. This is gross negligence manslaughter. and occasionally through one's official position.R v. Dytham [1979] QB 722, where a policeman on duty stood and watched three men kick another to death. Duty also can arise from one's own creation of a dangerous situation.R v. Miller [1983] 1 All ER 978, a squatter flicked away a still lit cigarette, which landed on a mattress. He failed to take action, and after the building had burned down, he was convicted of arson. He failed to correct the dangerous situation he created, as he was duty bound to do. See also, R v. Santana-Bermudez (2003) where a thug with a needle failed to tell a policewoman searching his pockets that he had one. On the other hand, it was held in the U.K. that switching off the life support of someone in a persistent vegetative state is an omission to act and not criminal. Since discontinuation of power is not a voluntary act, not grossly negligent, and is in the patient's best interests, no crime takes place.Airedale NHS Trust v. Bland [1993] 1 All ER 821 In this case it was held that since a PVS patient could not give or withhold consent to medical treatment, it was for the doctors to decide whether treatment was in the patient's best interest. It was reasonable for them to conclude that treatment was not in the patient's best interest, and should therefore be stopped, when there was no prospect of improvement. It was never lawful to take active steps to cause or accelerate death, although in certain circumstances it was lawful to withhold life sustaining treatment, including feeding, without which the patient would die. An actus reus may be nullified by an absence of causation. For example, a crime involves harm to a person, the person's action must be the but for cause and proximate cause of the harm.e.g. R v. Pagett [1983] Crim LR 393, where 'but for' the defendant using his pregnant girlfriend for a human shield from police fire, she would not have died. Pagget's conduct foreseeably procured the heavy police response. If more than one cause exists (e.g. harm comes at the hands of more than one culprit) the act must have \\"more than a slight or trifling link\\" to the harm.R v. Kimsey [1996] Crim LR 35, where 2 girls were racing their cars dangerously and crashed. One died, but the other was found slightly at fault for her death and convicted. Causation is not broken simply because a victim is particularly vulnerable. This is known as the thin skull rule.e.g. R v. Blaue [1975] where a Jehovah's witness (who refuse blood transfusions on religious grounds) was stabbed and without accepting life saving treatment died. However, it may be broken by an intervening act (novus actus interveniens) of a third party, the victim's own conduct,e.g. R v. Williams [1992] Crim LR 198 where a hitchhiker who jumped from a car and died, apparently because the driver tried to steal his wallet, was a \\"daft\\" intervening act. c.f. R v. Roberts [1972] Crim LR 27, where a girl getting drunk jumped from a speeding car to avoid sexual advances and was injured and R v. Majoram [2000] Crim LR 372 where thugs kicked in the victims door scared him to jumping from the window. These actions were foreseeable and therefore creating liability for injuries. or another unpredictable event. A mistake in medical treatment typically will not sever the chain, unless the mistakes are in themselves \\"so potent in causing death.\\"per Beldam LJ, R v. Cheshire [1991] 3 All ER 670; see also, R v. Jordan [1956] 40 Cr App R 152, where a stab victim recovering well in hospital was given an antibiotic. The victim was allergic, but he was given it the next day too, and died. The hospital's actions intervened and pardoned the defendant through condemning themselves instead. Mens rea Mens rea is another Latin phrase, meaning \\"guilty mind\\". This is the mental element of the crime. A guilty mind means an intention to commit some wrongful act. Intention under criminal law is separate from a person's motiveR v. Mohan [1975] 2 All ER 193, intention defined as \\"a decision to bring about ... [the actus reus] no matter whether the accused desired that consequence of his act or not.\\" (although motive does not exist in Scots law).see https://archive.org/stream/cu31924024627675#page/n5/mode/2up A lower threshold of mens rea is satisfied when a defendant recognizes an act is dangerous but decides to commit it anyway. This is recklessness. It is the mental state of mind of the person at the time the actus reus was committed. For instance, if C tears a gas meter from a wall to get the money inside, and knows this will let flammable gas escape into a neighbour's house, he could be liable for poisoning.c.f. R v. Cunningham [1957] 2 All ER 863, where the defendant did not realise, and was not liable; also R v. G and Another [2003] UKHL 50 Courts often consider whether the actor did recognize the danger, or alternatively ought to have recognized a risk.previously in the U.K. under Metropolitan Police Commissioner v. Caldwell [1981] 1 All ER 961 Of course, a requirement only that one ought to have recognized a danger (though he did not) is tantamount to erasing intent as a requirement. In this way, the importance of mens rea has been reduced in some areas of the criminal law but is obviously still an important part in the criminal system. Wrongfulness of intent also may vary the seriousness of an offense and possibly reduce the punishment but this is not always the case. A killing committed with specific intent to kill or with conscious recognition that death or serious bodily harm will result, would be murder, whereas a killing effected by reckless acts lacking such a consciousness could be manslaughter.R v. Woolin [1998] 4 All ER 103 On the other hand, it matters not who is actually harmed through a defendant's actions. The doctrine of transferred malice means, for instance, that if a man intends to strike a person with his belt, but the belt bounces off and hits another, mens rea is transferred from the intended target to the person who actually was struck.[Note: The notion of transferred intent does not exist within Scots' Law. In Scotland, one would not be charged with assault due to transferred intent, but instead assault due to recklessness.]R v. Latimer (1886) 17 QBD 359; though for an entirely different offense, e.g. breaking a window, one cannot transfer malice, see R v. Pembliton (1874) LR 2 CCR 119 Strict liability Strict liability can be described as criminal or civil liability notwithstanding the lack of mens rea or intent by the defendant. Not all crimes require specific intent, and the threshold of culpability required may be reduced or demoted. For example, it might be sufficient to show that a defendant acted negligently, rather than intentionally or recklessly. In offenses of absolute liability, other than the prohibited act, it may not be necessary to show the act was intentional. Generally, crimes must include an intentional act, and \\"intent\\" is an element that must be proved in order to find a crime occurred. The idea of a \\"strict liability crime\\" is an oxymoron. The few exceptions are not truly crimes at all ‚Äì but are administrative regulations and civil penalties created by statute, such as crimes against the traffic or highway code. Fatal offenses A murder, defined broadly, is an unlawful killing. Unlawful killing is probably the act most frequently targeted by the criminal law. In many jurisdictions, the crime of murder is divided into various gradations of severity, e.g., murder in the first degree, based on intent. Malice is a required element of murder. Manslaughter (Culpable Homicide in Scotland) is a lesser variety of killing committed in the absence of malice, brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness. Settled insanity is a possible defense. Personal offenses Many criminal codes protect the physical integrity of the body. The crime of battery is traditionally understood as an unlawful touching, although this does not include everyday knocks and jolts to which people silently consent as the result of presence in a crowd. Creating a fear of imminent battery is an assault, and also may give rise to criminal liability. Non-consensual intercourse, or rape, is a particularly egregious form of battery. Property offenses Property often is protected by the criminal law. Trespassing is unlawful entry onto the real property of another. Many criminal codes provide penalties for conversion, embezzlement, theft, all of which involve deprivations of the value of the property. Robbery is a theft by force. Fraud in the UK is a breach of the Fraud Act 2006 by false representation, by failure to disclose information or by abuse of position. Participatory offenses Some criminal codes criminalize association with a criminal venture or involvement in criminality that does not actually come to fruition. Some examples are aiding, abetting, conspiracy, and attempt. However, in Scotland, the English concept of Aiding and Abetting is known as Art and Part Liability. See Glanville Williams, Textbook of Criminal Law, (London: Stevens & Sons, 1983); Glanville Williams, Criminal Law the General Part (London: Stevens & Sons, 1961).  Mala in se v. mala prohibita  While crimes are typically broken into degrees or classes to punish appropriately, all offenses can be divided into 'mala in se' and 'mala prohibita' laws. Both are Latin legal terms, mala in se meaning crimes that are thought to be inherently evil or morally wrong, and thus will be widely regarded as crimes regardless of jurisdiction. Mala in se offenses are felonies, property crimes, immoral acts and corrupt acts by public officials. Mala prohibita, on the other hand, refers to offenses that do not have wrongfulness associated with them. Parking in a restricted area, driving the wrong way down a one-way street, jaywalking or unlicensed fishing are examples of acts that are prohibited by statute, but without which are not considered wrong. Mala prohibita statutes are usually imposed strictly, as there does not need to be mens rea component for punishment under those offenses, just the act itself. For this reason, it can be argued that offenses that are mala prohibita are not really crimes at all. Defenses=Criminal law jurisdictions International Criminal Court in The Hague Public international law deals extensively and increasingly with criminal conduct that is heinous and ghastly enough to affect entire societies and regions. The formative source of modern international criminal law was the Nuremberg trials following the Second World War in which the leaders of Nazism were prosecuted for their part in genocide and atrocities across Europe. The Nuremberg trials marked the beginning of criminal fault for individuals, where individuals acting on behalf of a government can be tried for violations of international law without the benefit of sovereign immunity. In 1998 an International criminal court was established in the Rome Statute.

The mall is located on Lehigh Street, just south of Interstate 78 exit 57, near Allentown's southern border with Salisbury Township and Emmaus.  History  Hess's South, an early satellite location of the Hess's downtown Allentown department store, opened at the site of the mall in 1971. Hess's built a modest enclosed mall on the north side of the department store in 1975, adding a Weis Market and several specialty shops. In 1979, the Hess's department store chain, which developed and owned the mall and operated its largest tenant, was bought by Johnstown-based mall developing firm, Crown American. This sale caused Crown American to inherit the South Mall - it would be one of only two malls that Crown American would own that was built by a different firm. Crown American doubled the size of the South Mall in a 1986-1987 expansion that added a new section of enclosed mall on the southern side of Hess's South. Discount retailer Jamesway opened its 100th store at the South Mall to anchor the new expansion, and celebrated the milestone with skydivers landing on the parking lot. The mall expanded yet again in 1991 to add a third major anchor in the newer portion of the mall: discount drugstore Phar-Mor. The older portion of the mall on the north side of Hess's was de-malled sometime following the 1991 closure of the Rea & Derick drugstore due to its acquisition by CVS. The former mall space in this area was replaced by Staples and Petco by 1996. Jamesway closed in late 1995 as the whole chain folded during its second bankruptcy filing. A year later, a majority of the Jamesway space was occupied by Stein Mart, marking Stein Mart's first Pennsylvania location. The remainder of the former Jamesway was subdivided between Gold's Gym and Home & Gifts, before later becoming a Ross - Dress For Less. Weis closed its South Mall food market amid poor sales in 1999. The former grocery store has since been subdivided into a strip of several stores. Phar-Mor closed its anchor store at the South Mall in 2002 along with the remainder of the chain. This was replaced by Steve & Barry's, a casualwear chain. In 2003, mall owner Crown American was purchased by the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust (PREIT). Steve & Barry's went bankrupt and closed all stores in 2008. The anchor space it had occupied at South Mall was leased the following year to Black Rose Antiques and Collectibles, an antiques mall that featured over 100 individual dealers selling various curios. In June 2014, PREIT sold the mall for $23.6 million to Nicholas Park Mall LLC, a company formed by 7 New York area investors led by former Macy's executive Richard Krantz. This was one of more than a dozen underperforming malls that PREIT has sold since 2012 in order to focus on its most successful properties. Black Rose Antiques left the South Mall in favor of the former JCPenney anchor at the Phillipsburg Mall, with the new location opening on January 1, 2017. The anchor space it previously occupied in the South Mall was thereafter subdivided, with Limerick Furniture occupying the larger share of the space in early 2017. The remainder of the space was revamped to accommodate the Full Circle Training gym, which opened in early 2018. Meanwhile, The Bon-Ton, the oldest and largest anchor of the South Mall closed in 2018 along with all other remaining Bon-Ton stores. In 2019, Limerick Furniture closed as well, leaving the mall with just Stein Mart as a major anchor tenant. In recent years, the South Mall has shifted focus towards engaging community events including periodic flea markets and weekly summer food truck events. Nontraditional tenants, such as Cave Brewing Co. ‚Äì a full- service bar with live entertainment ‚Äì and the South Mall Mercantile antiques dealer, have been brought in to fill the voids left by typical mall retailers. On August 12, 2020, it was announced that Stein Mart would be closing all stores, including the South Mall location which will leave the mall with no traditional anchor stores.

Early life Prior to becoming a Councilman, Kraus worked as an interior design consultant and also served as president of the South Side Chamber of Commerce. He was a member of Mayor Tom Murphy's Graffiti Task Force and Clean Pittsburgh Commission. Political career Kraus first ran for the seat vacated by Gene Ricciardi, who resigned to become a district judge, in the 2006 special election. Though he was endorsed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, his bid was unsuccessful. In 2007, he ran again against incumbent Jeff Koch and won the primary. Kraus, a Democrat, faced only a Libertarian opponent, Mark Rauterkus, who was running simultaneously for Pittsburgh City Controller. Kraus won and was sworn in on January 7, 2008, as part of a trio of new Council members (including Patrick Dowd and Ricky Burgess). He sought re-election in 2011, facing another Democratic primary against Jeff Koch, who had the support of Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. Kraus won 54% of the vote to Koch's 38%, with two other candidates each receiving 4%. No Republican or third-party candidate filed for the seat so Kraus ran unopposed in the general election in November 2011. As a city councilman, Kraus drafted the city's first domestic partnership registry which passed in 2009. In 2014, he sponsored legislation to add gender identity and expression as an explicitly protected class with regard to housing, employment and public accommodation in the city. He has also been involved in trying to curb public drunkenness and overcrowding in South Side bars. In September 2009, City Council passed his ordinance banning public urination, creating the first such ban in Pittsburgh. He has authored ordinances increasing open- container fines and regulating the installation of sidewalk cafes.

In Christian hamartiology, the sins that cry to Heaven for Vengeance (, lit. \\"screaming sins\\") are four particularly serious mortal sins, specific instances of which are listed by the Bible. While the Bible only refers to specific acts by Biblical characters as \\"crying to Heaven for Vengeance\\", in Western Christianity, these references are expanded upon and treated as establishing a category of particularly serious sins. Along with the seven deadly sins and the eternal sins, the sins that cry to Heaven for Vengeance are the most serious transgressions against the Law of Christ.  Catholic Church  The expression is referenced in the Christian Bible, particularly in (\\"The Lord said to Cain ... the voice of thy brother's blood crieth to me from the earth\\"), , , and . The sins are numbered either as being four or being seven; they are listed as follows: * The \\"blood of Abel\\": homicide, abortion, infanticide, fratricide, patricide, and matricideCatechism 2268 The fifth commandment forbids direct and intentional killing as gravely sinful. the murderer and those who cooperate voluntarily in murder commit a sin that cries out to heaven for vengeance. Infanticide, fratricide, parricide, and the murder of a spouse are especially grave crimes by reason of the natural bonds which they break. Concern for eugenics or public health cannot justify any murder, even if commanded by public authority. * The \\"sin of the Sodomites\\": Non procreative sexual acts (sodomy). (cf. ).Genesis 19:5 - 13 * Oppression of the poor.Catechism 2448 \\"In its various forms - material deprivation, unjust oppression, physical and psychological illness and death - human misery is the obvious sign of the inherited condition of frailty and need for salvation in which man finds himself as a consequence of original sin. This misery elicited the compassion of Christ the Savior, who willingly took it upon himself and identified himself with the least of his brethren. Hence, those who are oppressed by poverty are the object of a preferential love on the part of the Church which, since her origin and in spite of the failings of many of her members, has not ceased to work for their relief, defense, and liberation through numerous works of charity which remain indispensable always and everywhere.\\" * The \\"injustice to the wage earner\\": taking advantage of and defrauding workers (cf. ).Catechism 2434 A just wage is the legitimate fruit of work. To refuse or withhold it can be a grave injustice.221 In determining fair pay both the needs and the contributions of each person must be taken into account. \\"Remuneration for work should guarantee man the opportunity to provide a dignified livelihood for himself and his family on the material, social, cultural and spiritual level, taking into account the role and the productivity of each, the state of the business, and the common good.\\" Agreement between the parties is not sufficient to justify morally the amount to be received in wages. Tom Hoopes of Benedictine College explicates the sins that cry to heaven for vengeance with respect to modern political thought: The seven deadly sins, along with the sin against the Holy Ghost and the sins that cry to Heaven for vengeance, are considered especially serious in the Western Christian traditions. The sins that cry to Heaven for Vengeance are referenced in the Douay Catholic Catechism of 1649, a compendium of Christian doctrine. The concept is particularly important in Catholic moral theology.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1867 The catechetical tradition also recalls that there are \\"sins that cry to heaven\\": the blood of Abel, the sin of the Sodomites, the cry of the people oppressed in Egypt, the cry of the foreigner, the widow, and the orphan, injustice to the wage earner.  Other interpretations  Many churches, particularly ones considered progressive, understand the \\"sin of Sodom\\" to oppression of the poor, in light of (\\"This was the guilt of your sister Sodom: she and her daughters had pride, excess of food, and prosperous ease, but did not aid the poor and needy\\").Dr. Ralph Blair, \\"The story of Sodom and Lot‚Äôs duty of hospitality to his guests.\\" Retrieved 24 April 2020.

Around 150 Indians, mostly from Punjab, have acquired a combined total of about 1500 hectares of agricultural land for cultivation in Georgia. This is facilitated by the Georgian Government's policy of encouraging immigration of people with agricultural knowledge to the country in an effort to boost its declining agricultural production. Indian farmers are attracted by the low cost of land in Georgia. One Punjabi Sikh farmer who emigrated to Georgia noted that he could purchase 200 hectares of land in Georgia from the money made by selling one hectare of land in Punjab.

Lech and Maria Kaczynski Boulevard under construction in Batumi, Georgia The documented ties between Georgia and Poland reach back to the 15th century, when the Georgian (Kartlian) King Konstantin sent a diplomatic mission to the Polish King Alexander Jagiellon. Later, Polish King Jan III Sobieski tried to establish contacts with Georgia. Many Georgians participated in military campaigns led by Poland in the 17th century. Bogdan Gurdziecki, a Georgian, who was the greatest authority on all things Persian working in the Polish king's diplomatic service, made frequent diplomatic trips to Persia, on which he obtained, among other things, guarantees upholding earlier privileges for missionaries. Already during the rule of King Jan Kazimierz, he sent on missions to Isfahan, and King Jan III Sobieski availed himself of Gurdziecki's talents in like manner (in 1668, 1671, 1676‚Äì1678, in 1682‚Äì1684, and in 1687). Gurdziecki remained at the court of the shah for several years in the capacity of special resident and representative of the Polish king; it was he who delivered to the shah Suleiman news about the victory of the Christian forces at Vienna (1683). During the brief period of Georgian independence in 1920, Poland and Georgia had established good relations and signed a short-lived alliance. During the War in South Ossetia in 2008, Poland strongly supported Georgia. The President of Poland, Lech Kaczy≈Ñski, flew to Tbilisi along with other Eastern European presidents to rally against the Russian military buildup and subsequent military conflict. After several attacks on the Georgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs website, the Polish president allowed the Georgian MFA to publish its messages on his website.

It is known from the Shanwang formation beds in the Shanwang National Geological Park, Shandong Province, China. Taxonomy Rana basaltica was described by C.C. Young in 1936 based on a single specimen. Although not explicitly designated as the holotype, this specimen is the holotype by monotypy. However, no information where it was deposited was given, and the holotype is now considered lost. Moreover, the description was cursory, and the name has even been considered a nomen dubium. Therefore, Roƒçek and colleagues designated a neotype for Rana basaltica in 2011. This specimen (IVPP V11706) originates from the same fossil locality and bed, fits the diagnosis, and is preserved similarly to Young's original specimen. Description Rana basaltica measured in snout‚Äìvent length. The skull is somewhat shorter than it is wide and is nearly triangular in shape. There are eight procoelous and non- imbricate presacral vertebrae. The hind limbs are comparatively long, with the tibiofibula (fused tibia and fibula) longer than femur, suggesting that this frog was a good jumper.

In 1919, at the time of its annexation, the middle part of the County of Tyrol which is today called South Tyrol (in Italian Alto Adige) was inhabited by almost 90% German speakers.Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): \\"South Tyrol in Figures 2008\\", Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol, Bozen/Bolzano 2007, p. 19, Table 11 Under the 1939 South Tyrol Option Agreement, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini determined the status of the German and Ladin (Rhaeto-Romanic) ethnic groups living in the region. They could emigrate to Germany, or stay in Italy and accept their complete Italianization. As a consequence of this, the society of South Tyrol was deeply riven. Those who wanted to stay, the so-called Dableiber, were condemned as traitors while those who left (Optanten) were defamed as Nazis. Because of the outbreak of World War II, this agreement was never fully implemented. Illegal Katakombenschulen (\\"Catacomb schools\\") were set up to teach children the German language.  Italianization programme = Fascist period (1922‚Äì1945)  Street sign in Innsbruck, North Tyrol, commemorating the separation of South Tyrol, set up in 1923 in response to the prohibition of the original southern Tyrolean place names. In 1923, three years after South Tyrol had been formally annexed, Italian place names, almost entirely based on the Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige, were made official by means of a decree. The German name \\"Tyrol\\" was banned, likewise its derivants and compound words such as \\"Tyrolean\\" and \\"South Tyrolean\\". German newspapers, publishing houses, organized clubs and associations, including the South Tyrolean Alpine Club had to be renamed, with the decree said to have been strictly enforced by Italian carabinieri on the ground.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 21-23 The basis for these actions was a manifesto published by Ettore Tolomei on July 15, 1923, called the Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige (\\"Measures for the Alto Adige\\"), becoming the blueprint for the Italianization campaign. Its 32 measures were:Provvedimenti per l'Alto Adige, in: Gruber, Alfons: S√ºdtirol unter dem Faschismus, Schriftenreihe des S√ºdtiroler Kulturinstitutes 1, Bozen 1974, pp. 21f. # Association of Alto Adige and Trentino in a single province with the capital city of Trento. # Appointment of Italian municipal secretaries. # Revision of the (citizenship) options and closure of the Brenner border for all persons to whom the Italian citizenship was not granted. # Entry and residence difficulties for Germans and Austrians. # Prevention of German immigration. # Revision of the census of 1921. # Introduction of Italian as the official language. # Dismissal of German officials or transfer to the old provinces (i.e. pre-war Italian provinces). # Dissolution of the \\"Deutscher Verband\\" (German association). # Dissolution of Alpine associations not under command of the Italian Alpine Club, transfer of all Alpine refuges to the Italian Alpine Club. # Prohibition of the name \\"S√ºdtirol\\" and \\"Deutsch-S√ºdtirol‚Äù. # Closure of the newspaper published in Bozen \\"Der Tiroler\\". # Italianization of German local names. # Italianization of public inscriptions. # Italianization of road and pathnames. # Italianization of the German surnames. # Removal of the Walther von der Vogelweide monument from the Walther Square in Bozen. # Increasing of Carabinieri troops (in the province) under the exclusion of Germans. # Preferential treatment for land acquisition and immigration of Italians. # Non-interference by foreign powers in South Tyrolean affairs. # Elimination of German banks, establishment of an Italian mortgage Bank. # Establishment of border customs offices in Sterzing and Toblach. # Generous support of the Italian language and culture. # Establishment of Italian nursery and primary schools. # Establishment of Italian secondary schools. # Strict control of foreign university diplomas. # Expansion of the \\"Istituto di Storia per l'Alto Adige\\" (Institute for the history of Alto Adige). # Realignment of the territory of the Diocese of Brixen and strict control of clergy activity. # Using only Italian in trials and court. # State control of the Chamber of Commerce and the agricultural authorities (Corporazioni). # Extensive programs for new rail junctions to facilitate the Italianization of Alto Adige (rail projects Milan-Mals, Veltlin-Brenner, Agordo-Brixen). # Increase military garrisons in Alto Adige. In October 1923, the \\"use of the Italian language became mandatory on all levels of federal, provincial and local government\\". Regulations by the fascist authorities required that all kinds of signs and public notices had to be in Italian only, while maps, postcards and other graphic material had to show Italian place names. In September 1925, Italian became the sole permissible language in courts of law, meaning that cases could be heard from now on only in Italian. The fascist law regulations remained in effect after World War II, becoming a bone of contention for decades until they were eventually reconsidered in the 1990s.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 23-24 The German-language press, which was still published, was harassed by the authorities and subjected to censorship prior to publication. In 1926 the fascist authorities began to publish their own German-language newspaper, the Alpenzeitung. Other German-language papers were obliged to follow a strictly pro-regime editorial policy.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 25-26 The programme of Italianization was particularly forcefully applied in schools, aiming at the destruction of the German school system. As of 1928, Italian had become the only language of instruction in 760 South Tyrolean classes, affecting over 360 schools and 30,000 pupils. Likewise, German Kindergarten were required to use Italian, while substitutes were forced to shut down. German teachers were systematically dismissed on the grounds of \\"insufficient didactics\\", or transferred to the south, from where Italian teachers were recruited instead. Degrees from Austrian or German universities became valid only through an additional stay of one year at an Italian university.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 26-27 In religious affairs, a royal decree of November 1923 required religious instruction in Italian for all Italianized schools. Fascist calls for the Italianization of German charitable organizations, religious orders and the complete abolition of German religious instruction to the Vatican were not entirely successful, not in the least due to the repeated interventions of the Bishop of Brixen and the setting up of informal Parish schools. In state schools, though, Italian became mandatory for the last five classes, while the use of German was only allowed in teaching the Italian catechism in the first three years.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 27-28 The German-speaking population reacted by the establishment of Katakombenschulen (\\"catacomb schools\\"), clandestine home schools outside the Italianized standard educational system. German schoolbooks were secretly smuggled across the border, often hidden in religious buildings before being distributed to the South Tyroleans pupils. After initial difficulties, secret seminars for the instruction of teachers were organized throughout the province, usually under the protection of the Catholic church. Fascist countermeasures ranged from searches and confiscations to imprisonments and deportations. The balancing act between the instruction in Italian and German schools, where often the exact opposite was taught, especially in history and the social fields, is said to have left many Tyrolean pupils with a torn identity.Steininger, Rolf (2003), pp. 29-32 The newly composed Bozner Bergsteigerlied quickly became one of South Tyrol's unofficial hymns by celebrating an unbroken attachment of the South Tyroleans to their homeland.  Post-war period  Austrian flag. The poster is located on the Austrian side of the border, not in South Tyrol. After the end of the Second World War, reform processes tolerated the dual use of names on street signs, while the Italian names remain as the official ones, based on the 1940 law. In the 1990s, a commission consisting of the Professors Josef Breu (Vienna, representing Austria in the Toponymy commission of the UN), Peter Glatthard (Berne) and Carlo Alberto Mastrelli (Florence, current \\"Archivio per l'Alto Adige\\") failed as Mastrelli insisted on the fascist decrees, while Breu and Glatthard promoted the UN-Guidelines.Namen in S√ºdtirol wecken nationale Leidenschaften Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 28 September 2000  See also  * Italianization * Prontuario dei nomi locali dell'Alto Adige ReferencesSources External links Fascism History of South Tyrol Cultural assimilation Italian language Geographical renaming ","title":"Italianization of South Tyrol"},{"id":"21351764","text":"This list is intended to provide a comprehensive listing of entries on the National Register of Historic Places in the Town of Huntington, New York.

History Opened with other stations on the branch line to Wirksworth on 1 October 1867, it was designed by the Midland Railway company architect John Holloway Sanders. Idridgehay remained open until 16 June 1947, when the Wirksworth branch passenger service was withdrawn on a temporary basis in response to postwar fuel shortages. This was made permanent with effect from May 1949, when the line was removed from the summer timetable. Freight facilities remained rail-served until 2 March 1964, while the branch continued to be used for mineral traffic until December 1989. The station has been restored as an operational station on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway in Derbyshire. The station building and nearby former station master's house have been sold off to private ownership in recent years, but the platform has been restored by volunteer members of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway Association, culminating in its reopening to passenger-carrying trains in March 2008.

It sets forth a leadership model to help professional people grow in virtue and lead effectively.Virtuous Leadership; New York: Scepter Publishers (2007); Virtuous Leadership has been translated into 15 languages including Russian and Chinese. As such, some commentators have called it the first systematic and holistic attempt to relate the classical virtues to professional leadership in modern times.Retorikk, etikk og n√¶ringsliv, Odd Nordhaug og Hans-Ivar Kristiansen (red.)., Oslo 2009 Havard‚Äôs leadership model is rooted in aretology‚Äîthe science of virtue. Derived from the Greek word for virtue‚Äîar√™te‚Äîthis branch of science stems from the work of the classical Greek philosophers‚Äîabove all, Aristotle‚Äîand was developed further by such Christian philosophers and theologians as Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas. A 10-point summary of Mr. Havard‚Äôs model: # Authentic leadership must be based on authentic anthropology, which is to say, an authentic study of man. Such an anthropology must comprise aretology‚Äîthe science of virtue‚Äîor it cannot be truly authentic. Virtue is a sound habit of the mind, the will and the heart that helps us achieve personal excellence and professional effectiveness. Leadership is all about virtue. Why? 1) Because virtue instills trust, the sine qua non of leadership. 2) Because virtue is a dynamic force, which enhances our capacity to act (the word \\"virtue\\" stems from the Latin word virtus, signifying \\"strength\\" or \\"power\\"). # Magnanimity and humility, which are virtues principally of the heart, are the essence of leadership. Magnanimity is the habit of striving towards great things. Leaders are magnanimous in their dreams, visions, and sense of mission; and also in their capacity to challenge themselves and those around them. Humility is the habit of service. Humility means that leaders pull rather than push, teach rather than command, inspire rather than berate. Thus, leadership is less about displays of power than the empowerment of others. Magnanimity and humility are two virtues that cannot be separated. Together they constitute a unique ideal: the ideal of the dignity and greatness of man. Magnanimity makes us conscience of our personal dignity and greatness; humility makes us conscience of the dignity and greatness of others. Magnanimity and humility are the fruits of a proper appreciation of the value of man; pusillanimity, which prevents man from understanding himself, and pride, which prevents him from understanding others, are the derive from a false appreciation of the value of man. Leadership is a life ideal that recognizes, assimilates and promotes the truth about man. # The virtues of prudence (practical wisdom), courage, self-control and justice, which are virtues principally of the mind and the will, are leadership‚Äôs bedrock virtues. Prudence enhances our ability to make right decisions; courage to stay the course and resist pressures of all kinds; self- control to subordinate passions to the spirit and direct them towards the fulfillment of the mission at hand, and justice to give every individual his due. # Leaders are not born, but trained. Why? Because virtue is a habit acquired through practice. Leadership is a question of character (virtue, freedom, self-improvement), not temperament (biology and genetics). Temperament may aid the development of some virtues and hinder others, but when virtues grow, they stamp character on our temperament so that temperament ceases to dominate us. Temperament is not an obstacle to leadership. The real obstacle is lack of character, which quickly leaves us drained of moral energy and quite incapable of leading. # Leaders do not lead by exercising the potestas, or power, inherent in their office. Instead, they lead through the auctoritas, the authority that stems from character. Those who lack genuine authority and succumb to the temptation to exercise unalloyed power are leaders in name only. In fact, they are non-leaders. This is a vicious circle: low authority leads to abuse of power, which leads to further erosion of authority, and the path to authentic leadership is blocked. # In order to grow in virtue one must a) contemplate virtue so as to perceive its intrinsic beauty and desire it strongly (a matter of the heart); b) act virtuously habitually (a matter of the will) and c) practice all the virtues simultaneously with special attention to prudence (a matter of reason.) # Through the practice of virtues, leaders achieve maturity in all its aspects‚Äîjudgmental, emotional, and behavioral. The unmistakable signs of maturity are self-confidence and consistency, psychological stability, joy and optimism, naturalness, a sense of freedom and responsibility, and interior peace. Leaders are neither skeptical nor cynical, but realistic. Realism is the ability to maintain the noblest aspirations of the soul even as one remains beset by this or that personal weakness. This is not giving in to weakness, but transcending it through the practice of virtues. # Leaders reject a utilitarian approach to virtue. The leader's motive in striving for virtue is not simply to become good at what he does. Rather, it is to realize himself fully as a human being in doing what he does well. Effectiveness is not the aim of self-improvement; it is merely one of its manifold (happy) results. Excellence comes first, effectiveness second. # True leaders live by virtue ethics, rather than by rules-based ethics. Virtue ethics does not deny the validity of laws and rules, but it does insist that rules cannot be the ultimate foundation of ethics. Laws and rules must be at the service of virtue. Virtue ethics redound to original and creative leadership. # Christian life has a formidable impact on leadership, because the supernatural virtues of faith, hope and charity (which are the heart of Christian life) elevate, strengthen, and transfigure the natural virtues, which are the foundation of leadership. No study of the impact of virtue on leadership is complete without taking into consideration the supernatural virtues.

Romania has an embassy in Riyadh and an honorary consulate in Jeddah. Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Bucharest. Official exchanges Since the Romanian revolution of 1989, the two countries have routinely engaged in friendly diplomatic exchanges. In October 1999, Romanian Prime Minister Radu Vasile received a delegation of the Majlis- ash-Shura (Consultative Council) of Saudi Arabia, headed by its chairman, Shaykh Muhammad bin Ibrahim bin Uthman bin Jubayr. Jubayr proposed development of an agreement for trade, economic, technical, cultural and sports cooperation, particularly cooperation in the oil sector. In March 2000, Romania's Foreign Affairs State Secretary Mihai RƒÉzvan Ungureanu met with Saudi Arabia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Bin Obaid Madani. Madani told reporters after the meeting that the main goal of his visit was to search for ways of diversifying and consolidating the Saudi-Romanian ties. In April 2000, King Fahd Bin Abd-al-Aziz met with Romania's deputy premier and foreign minister Petre Roman. Petre Roman also met with his counterpart Sa'ud al- Faysal and Crown Prince Abdullah, the secretary-general of the Gulf Cooperation Council. They discussed development of greater economic cooperations between the countries. In May 2000, the president of the Romanian Senate, Mircea Ionescu Quintus visited Saudi Arabia at the invitation of the chairman of the Saudi Consultative Council, Shaykh Muhammad Bin Ibrahim al- Jubayr. In March 2003, Chairman of the Romanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry George Cojocaru and vice-chairman of Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Chamber of Commerce and Industry Abdul Aziz al-Athel signed a memorandum on the setting up of the bilateral Romanian-Saudi Economic Council. Since 2006, relationships have become closer, with more tangible progress on trade and investment. In November 2006, Dr. Hashim Abdullah Yamani, minister of commerce & industry of Saudi Arabia, visited Bucharest, where a broader framework of economic cooperation was discussed. At the meeting, the Romanian vice Premier Bogdan Pascu said the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is an important economic partner and Romania is interested in developing the economic contacts existing between the two states. Also in November, Romanian Dr. Ion Dobreci presented his credentials to Prince Saud Al-Faisal, foreign minister, in Riyadh. He said Bucharest seeks to boost economic, technical, scientific and cultural cooperation with Saudi Arabia, and is examining the possibility of cooperation in oil & petrochemical sector. A Romanian economic mission was to visit Saudi Arabia and Bahrain in November 2007, meeting with the chambers of commerce and industry in Jeddah, Riyadh, Dammam and Bahrain. Trade and investment As of 2005, total Saudi-Romanian trade was relatively low, in the region of US$200 million per year. Although an oil producer, Romania imports oil from Saudi Arabia. Exports from Romania to Saudi Arabia include steel and aluminum products used in the oil industry. In May 2007, the Romanian ambassador to Saudi Arabia said that Saudi investors had made total investments of US$2.2 billion in Romania to date. For example, in 2001 it was reported that the Amiantit group of Saudi Arabia planned to invest at least 54M euro in existing pipe production units in Romania, and that the value of the group's production in Romania would rise to 109M euro a year. Another example was the 2007 acquisition of a controlling stake in Romania's state-owned Electroputere by a subsidiary of the Saudi Mada Group, which bought the controlling stake in the Romanian manufacturer of train engines, generators and electrical transformers for $174 million, and intends to invest $1 billion to modernize the company. Mada is involved in major railway project in Saudi Arabia, and plans to use the company's engines. The Electroputere deal was finalized in November 2007. Also in 2007, the Saudi Zamil Group was looking into investment in Romania's steel and pipe projects, and a major housing project of 25,000 units in Romania was being developed by a Saudi-Romanian joint venture. In 2008, Saudi Oger bought the Romanian cellular service provider Telemobil (Zapp).

Others in the bar had slipped LSD and other drugs into his beer without him knowing, and there was only a small amount of alcohol he had been drinking so he was not responsible for his intoxication which led to the violent actions. This case set a key precedent in Scots law for automatism, namely that since this case, if someone has been under the effect of drugs that they themselves did not voluntarily know they were taking or were under the influence of and commit a violent act, it may be a defence for them in court if they can prove or give evidence that their intoxication was not self-induced.

(see below: References). \\"Asterius of Amasea, Sermons (1904). Preface to the online edition\\", Roger Pearse (translator), Ipswich, UK, December 2003, webpage: ECWritings-Aste. He was born in Cappadocia and probably died in Amasea in modern Turkey, then in Pontus. Significant portions of his lively sermons survive, which are especially interesting from the point of view of art history, and social life in his day. Asterius, Bishop of Amasea is not to be confused with the Arian polemicist Asterius the Sophist. His feast day is October 30.http://catholicsaints.mobi/calendar/30-october.htm Life and work Asterius of Amasea was the younger contemporary of Amphilochius of Iconium and the three great Cappadocian Fathers. Little is known about his life, except that he was educated by a Scythian slave. Like Amphilochius, he had been a lawyer before becoming bishop between 380 and 390 AD, and he brought the skills of the professional rhetorician to his sermons.Introduction to his sermons Sixteen homilies and panegyrics on the martyrs still exist, showing familiarity with the classics, and containing an unusual concentration of details of everyday life in his time. One of them, Oration 4: Adversus Kalendarum Festum attacks the pagan customs and abuses of the New Years feast, denying everything that Libanius had said supporting it ‚Äì see Lord of Misrule for extensive quotations. That sermon was preached on January 1, 400 AD, which provides the main evidence, with a reference in another to his great age, to the dating of his career.Introduction Artistic references The Caesar Constantius Gallus in a later copy of the Chronography of 354, with one of the best surviving indications of what the pictures on clothes described by Asterius looked like. In Oration 11, On the martyrdom of St. Euphemia, Asterius describes a painting of the martyrdom and compares it to pictures made by the famous pre-Christian Hellenistic painters Euphranor and Timomachus;Google books partial translation Castelli, Elizabeth A; in Religions of Late Antiquity in Practice, Ed Richard Valantasis, Princeton University Press, 2000, , the speech was quoted twice in the Second Council of Nicaea in 787, which concluded the period of Byzantine iconoclasm, as evidence in favour of the veneration of images. As described, the icon was on canvas, and displayed in a church near her tomb; it has puzzled historians, as the manner of death, from fire, differs from all other accounts in the tradition. It is an exceptionally detailed ekphrasis, or description of a work of art, from this period, although scholars have wondered how well the description matched an actual work.See Castelli The intended audience is uncertain, though it was apparently all-male, as they are addressed as \\"gentlemen\\" (andres). In Oration 1, On the Rich Man and Lazarus,Online English text he objects to richly decorated clothes: > through vain devices and vicious desires, you seek out fine linen, and > gather the threads of the Persian worms and weave the spider's airy web;This > is hyperbole, built upon the preceding periphrastic description of silk and > going to the dyer, pay large prices in order that he may fish the shell-fish > out of the sea and stain the garment with the blood of the creature,See > Tyrian purple. this is the act of a man surfeited, who misuses his > substance, having no place to pour out the superfluity of his wealth. For > this in the Gospel such a man is scourged, being portrayed as stupid and > womanish, adorning himself with the embellishments of wretched girls. Clothes decorated with religious images, worn by laymen it seems, are also condemned: > having found some idle and extravagant style of weaving, which by the > twining of the warp and the woof, produces the effect of a picture,Tapestry; > The Hestia Tapestry is a 6th-century Byzantine tapestry. and imprints upon > their robes the forms of all creatures, they artfully produce, both for > themselves and for their wives and children, clothing beflowered and wrought > with ten thousand objects....You may see the wedding of Galilee, and the > water-pots; the paralytic carrying his bed on his shoulders; the blind man > being healed with the clay; the woman with the bloody issue, taking hold of > the border of the garment; the sinful woman falling at the feet of Jesus; > Lazarus returning to life from the grave. In doing this they consider that > they are acting piously and are clad in garments pleasing to God. But if > they take my advice let them sell those clothes and honor the living image > of God. Do not picture Christ on your garments. It is enough that he once > suffered the humiliation of dwelling in a human body which of his own accord > he assumed for our sakes. So, not upon your robes but upon your soul carry > about his image. Other interesting details of the lifestyle of the rich are mentioned in condemnation. The apparent contradiction of these positions confused Arnold Hauser, in his famous The Social History of Art, into wrongly claiming Asterius as an Iconoclast,The Social History of Art Online text but his objection to images on clothes is on the grounds of expense and frivolity. Texts Of Asterius's work, 16 homilies survive, and Photios lists four more. Some of these speeches have survived in medieval Latin, Georgian, and Church Slavonic translations. An English translation exists of five sermons by Asterius, which were published in 1904 in the US under the title \\"Ancient Sermons for Modern Times\\", and issued as a reprint in 2007. This is the main portion of his works to exist in English, and has been transcribed online.Barnes & Noble details Oration 11 has also been translated.In the article by Castelli, referenced above. Other sermons by Asterius of Amasea existed in the time of Photius, who referred to a further ten sermons not now known in Bibliotheca codex 271. One of these lost sermons indicates that Asterius lived to a great age. Philip Rubens, brother of the painter, produced an edition of the homilies, published posthumously in a memorial volume after his death in 1611, together with a short biography of Philip, a selection of Latin poems that he had written, and Latin poems written in his memory by his friends. Fourteen genuine sermons have been printed by Migne in the Patrologia Graeca 40, 155-480, with a Latin translation. along with other sermons \\"by Asterius\\" that were written by Asterius the Sophist. Another two genuine sermons were discovered in manuscript at Mount Athos by M. Bauer. Those two were first printed by A. Bretz (TU 40.1, 1914). Eleven sermons have also been translated into German.

Partly a black comedy, the film was released around the same time as the urban renewal of the Klara quarters in Stockholm, and could be seen as a comment both on the demolishing of the old buildings and on the welfare state in general. Out of the total running time of 77 minutes, about 50 minutes are animated. It is considered to be the first Swedish animated feature film, although the first one that was fully animated was Agaton Sax and the Bykoebing Village Festival. Plot On the way home to the run-down shack he lives in with a can of dog food meant for himself, Johan Bj√∂rk is accidentally covered by a pile of car tires thrown by a man who fails to notice him. His cries for help aren't perceived by anyone except one drunk, who is caught by the police when calling for assistance. Finally, at night, a young couple making love on the pile of tires notice him. They help him to get up and assist him to his home. He is hurt in the leg and understands that he can't take care of himself anymore, so he is put in a retirement home. At the home, Johan is sitting in a wheelchair staring out the window, mumbling for himself about his past to an animated flashback. Johan grew up on the countryside, when the grass was always green. His father was strong, his mother liked to bake. He was also harassed by a boy named Evert, while at the same time being in love with Evert's cute sister. At his confirmation, Evert tackled him so that all the girls' dresses were ruined by the sacramental wine. This made Evert's sister laugh at him, and with his heart broken he decided to run away to Stockholm. Johan started to work as a masonry, and carried bricks and bottles of beer to a foreman who consumed one bottle for ever brick he laid. In his loneliness, Johan fantasized about women, and made his first rousing visit to a brothel. He grew a moustache and visited an amusement park with two friends he had made, Sven and a man from V√§rmland who he has a hard time remembering the name of. They flirted with girls, and everybody laughed when Johan failed at kicking a can in order to camouflage a fart. A nurse brings Johan back to reality to give him his medicine. Johan fantasizes about constructing a pyramid scheme that will give him thousands of whiskey bottles. He imagines a life of luxury in Monte Carlo, where he is also being chased by gangsters. Once again Johan goes back to thinking about his past. He is struck by death angst while thinking of his dead parents. Johan also receives a letter from his son who ran away to America many years ago, since Johan wasn't a particularly successful father. The son is asking for money, while Johan is imagining what the American things mentioned in the letter might look like. Johan is thinking about the modern day. The blocks he was involved in building are being demolished to give room for modernistic city planning. He summarizes his failed life for himself: poverty ruined his relationship, his son ran away and the wife died. He befriends Sven, another man at the retirement home, and together they drink to make the memories fade.

History Ravenstor station came into existence through the activities of the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway Association (EVRA). Working with WyvernRail to reopen the former Wirksworth-Duffield branch line the decision was made to create a passenger carrying service where previously only mineral traffic (limestone) had ever been transported. The particular interest lay in the fact that the line was on an incline of 1 in 27; steep indeed for any railway line. Work over a number of years including the building of an entirely new platform culminated in August 2005 with the opening of the line for passenger services. The first service ran on 1 September 2005 and the station was opened in a ceremony by Gwyneth Dunwoody, MP, Commons Transport Committee Chairman, on 2 September 2005. Operation The full timetabled service at this station ceased in 2016, Wyvernrail Plc having terminated it in unexplained circumstances. It now operates an oddly incoherent service run by EVRA, a supporters group. Location Ravenstor was a former concentration site for local quarries and did not have a passenger service until one was introduced by the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway. It lies at the bottom of a disused incline which was built to link it to the Cromford and High Peak Railway, now the site of the National Stone Centre and the Steeple Grange Light Railway. However it is hoped that one day once funds will be made available for a possible extension up the incline towards Middleton Top, depending how steep it would be. It would also serve the nearby National Stone Centre above.

Currently, Belarus has an embassy in Bucharest, while Romania has an embassy in Minsk. Both countries officially established diplomatic relations on 14 February 1992. History Romanian President Ion Iliescu visited Minsk both in July 1992 and March 1994, while Chairman Stanislav Shushkevich of Belarus visited Bucharest in May 1993 and April 1994.https://minsk.mae.ro/en/node/393 2020 Belarusian protests In 2020, protests in Belarus against the outcome of the presidential elections of 9 August 2020 occurred. Two days later, the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Bogdan Aurescu said he was \\"very concerned\\" about the situation of the country and that the \\"only way\\" was to stop the violence and start a political dialogue. He also urged the country to respect fundamental human rights. Alexander Lukashenko, the president elected in the controversial 2020 elections, has been compared to the Romanian communist leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu. The latter suffered a revolution against him in 1989, which ended with his capture and execution. Some have said that Lukashenko could end in the same way as him. On August 14, three youth and student organizations condemned the Belarusian government for manipulating the elections and using violence. They urged Aurescu to defend the rights of civil society, \\"even through the adoption of sanctions\\". The three organizations were among the first in Romania to state their opinion on the matter. On 16 August, dozens of Romanians protested in front of the Belarusian embassy in Bucharest. They carried banners expressing their solidarity with the protestants, criticized the repression of the protests and expressed their desire for the elections to be repeated. At the beginning of the incident, most Romanian politicians or government officials said nothing, usually waiting for statements from the European Union instead of reacting individually. An exception was the political party Save Romania Union (USR), whose MPs proposed a joint statement by the two houses of the Romanian Parliament on the situation in Belarus. The president of the USR, Dan Barna, described Lukashenko as \\"a Ceau»ôescu lookalike, who will eventually be removed from power\\". Furthermore, leaders of several European Parliament political parties, under the initiative of the Romanian politician Dacian Ciolo»ô, called on 17 August for a repeat of the Belarusian elections. Russia was also asked to \\"refrain from any intervention\\". In 19 August, the Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said that the European Union should take measures against the situation in Belarus, including sanctions against those involved in the use of violence against protesters and in the electoral fraud. He also called for the release of the persons that were illegally detained. On the same day, the European Council of the European Union (of which Romania is a member) declared that the 2020 elections were not fair or free and rejected its results. In 24 August, an open letter was sent to Aurescu and Iohannis, as well as to the Prime Minister Ludovic Orban, to support civil society and human rights in Belarus. They compared the protests to the Romanian Revolution in 1989 and the Romanian protests of 2017‚Äì2019. Methods of torture committed in 1989 in Romania were also compared with those committed in 2020 in Belarus. The letter called on the Romanian government to take a firm position in favor of the rights of the Belarusian people, free elections, an end to torture and others. At the end of the letter, it urges the recipients to open communication channels with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya and the Coordination Council, to declare that Lukashenko is not recognized as president, to set a deadline for transfer of power to Tsikhanouskaya and to break diplomatic relations with Belarus in case Lukashenko does not cease the violent repression. The letter was signed by more than 200 political or cultural figures of Romania, including former Foreign Minister Andrei Plesu, writer Ana Blandiana, directors Cristian Mungiu and Adina Pintilie and the former political prisoner Radu Filipescu. On 26 August, Aurescu announced on Twitter that the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was preparing to allocate 100,000 euros to support Belarusian civil society and independent media. The next day, he said before an informal European Union meeting that Romania is \\"very concerned\\" about the situation in Belarus and the abuses against protesters and the opposition and that the country supports \\"a full list of sanctions\\" against various Belarusian officials. On 2 September, the Senate of Romania unanimously approved, after 124 votes in favor, to make a declaration regarding the violation of fundamental human rights in Belarus. The Romanian Parliament expressed solidarity with the Belarusian population, called for an end to violence to give place to peaceful protests and said that it believed that a \\"more articulate reaction\\" from the international community will be necessary in case the situation is not resolved. On 4 September, Aurescu confirmed that Romania would continue to call for an end to violence, for the beginning of a political dialogue and for respect of the human rights of the Belarusians. He also reiterated the intention to contribute 100,000 euros to Belarusian civil society and independent journalism and rejected the accusations of interference in the internal affairs of the country. On 9 September, PEN Romania, together with other international PEN centers, signed a document calling for the release of political prisoners from Belarus. It also criticized Lukasenko's repressive policies. Furthermore, on the same day, several diplomats from the European Union stayed at the home of the Belarusian writer Svetlana Alexievich, who is a member of the Coordination Council, to avoid her arrest. Among the diplomats were representatives from Romania, as well as Austria, Czech Republic, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia and Sweden.

As the County Surveyor and BridgemasterLancashire County Council, County Surveyor and Bridgemaster, of Lancashire County Council from 1945 to 1972 he led teams that designed the first stretch of motorway opened to the public, the Preston By-passM6 Preston By-Pass, (now the M6 from Junctions 29 to 32) on 5 December 1958. There then followed numerous contracts to extend the motorway in the north west of England, which, thanks to his role, probably still has the greatest density of motorways in the country. He was appointed a CBE in 1962 for his services as County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council and in 1973 he was knighted in recognition of his role as head of the North West Road Construction Unit and the Lancashire Sub-Unit, organisations that further extended his initial work.  Early life  Drake was born in Burnley, Lancashire, and was educated at Accrington Grammar School and the Victoria University of Manchester where he graduated in 1927 with a BSc in Civil Engineering, with first-class honours. He passed the professional exams of the Institution of Civil Engineers in April 1931, and was accepted as an associate in 1933 and as a full member in 1943. He married Kathleen Shaw on 6 July 1937 and they had two daughters, Diana and Jane.  Early work  His working life was spent in the north west of England, and, but for the first three years of his career when he worked for Stockport County Borough Council (1927‚Äì1930), he was based entirely in Lancashire. He spent seven years at Bootle County Borough Council (1930‚Äì37) and from there moved to Blackpool County Borough Council (1937‚Äì45), initially as Deputy Engineer and Surveyor and latterly as Borough Engineer and Surveyor. In the early part of his career he worked on the design of a wide range of municipal engineering schemes. These included a sports stadium and cycle track; an eighteen-hole golf course; municipal offices; housing estates; libraries; schools; sea defences; an 18-mile sewerage system; a 7-mile ring road; and the construction of Britain's first multi-storey car park with integrated bus station. In 1937 Drake travelled to Germany with the German Road Delegation to view autobahn construction. In the late 1930s and even during the Second World War many new road schemes were planned for the United Kingdom. The County Surveyors' Society and the Institution of Highway Engineers published reports that outlined the needs for and the benefits of a new high capacity highway network. During the Second World War, Winston Churchill had proposals drawn up to improve transport infrastructure. During this time Drake became a strong advocate of motorways for access, speed, safety and commerce. He went on to pursue his ideas locally, nationally and internationally.  Birth of the motorway network  In 1945 he was appointed the County Surveyor and Bridgemaster of Lancashire County Council, a post he would hold until 1972. Drake published his Road Plan for LancashireRoad Plan for Lancashire, in 1949.Wheels Within Wheels by Mick Hamer, https://books.google.com/books?id=eVo9AAAAIAAJ&pg;=PA47&dq;=%22James+Drake+motorway%22&ei;=I2Z3SaWyGYaoM-L55McE&client;=firefox-a Funds for public works were severely limited following the end of the Second World War and so Drake had a number of bridge engineers available, with little design work to occupy them, but with the necessary skills to measure and project traffic flows and manipulate data. This comprehensive document formed the basis of the County's development plan for more than thirty years and went on to become the basis of national highway planning procedures. Drake realised that following the Second World War there would not be large amounts of public money available for significant new developments. He considered that the only way to develop a strategic road network would be to let a series of contracts, each of which would extend or link up with previously constructed sections and thus lead to the creation of a new road network.  Preston by-pass From 1946 government plans incorporated a new north-south trunk route through Lancashire. So did Drake's plan, which he pressed on government from 1949 to 1955. Work began in 1956 on the Preston bypass with the county as the government's agent. This became the first section of Britain's motorway system, opened to traffic in 1958. Drake and Lancashire County Council had long recognised that a new type of highway was necessary for the mass movement of people and goods on a swift and safe basis. However Drake believed that the projected traffic figures for the by-pass justified the construction of three lanes in each direction. However, despite his requests for additional funding, the Ministry of Transport insisted that this could not be justified. Drake's response to this was to indeed create a motorway with two lanes in each direction, but with an extra wide central reservation. Bridges over the by- pass were built with sufficient clearance and headroom to accept dual three lanes in each direction without modification.Civil Engineering Heritage, Northern England by Robert William Rennison and M F Barbey, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Bv2BrOMo8cIC&pg;=PA218&lpg;=PA218&dq;=%22james%2BDrake%2Bmotorway%22&source;=web&ots;=PSmM8Qs0cj&sig;=kQDoHcnKtGRvlueej1wn15FmDH8&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=5&ct;=result This meant that when the inevitable widening took place it did so relatively easily. Drake realised that motorways would have a significant impact on the communities that they passed through and tried to ensure that their impact was minimised.The English Landscape in the Twentieth Century by Trevor Rowley, https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=SZWI2kYEhTcC&pg;=PA51&lpg;=PA51&dq;=%22james%2BDrake%2Bmotorway%22&source;=web&ots;=EqW87ABK4n&sig;=vtcNTbrrTSE58ifAhM4jXqIN6zw&hl;=en&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&resnum;=8&ct;=result#PPA51,M1 The scheme design and supervision was carried out by the County Surveyor's Department of Lancashire County Council, as Agent for the Ministry of Transport. The Contractor was Tarmac Ltd who carried out the roadworks, they engaged Leonard Fairclough Ltd as a sub-contractor for the majority of the bridgeworks. The two multi-span steel bridges, Samlesbury Bridge and Higher Walton Bridge were built under separate contracts by Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company Ltd and Dorman Long (Bridge and Engineering) Ltd respectively. The scheme was opened by the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan on 5 December 1958. It was the first length of motorway opened to the public in the United Kingdom, with no speed limit and the largest road signs in Europe.  Motorway expansion  Even as Preston By-pass was being opened Drake had Lancaster By-pass under construction and numerous other schemes at outline design or detail design stages.  Commemorative plaque  On 5 December 2008 Lancashire County Council, the Institution of Civil Engineers and the then Institution of Highways and Transportation arranged for the unveiling of a plaque to commemorate Drake's role in the development of the motorway network.ICE Plaque Commemorates Motorway Pioneer, http://www.ice- northwest.org.uk/news_events/news_view.asp?newsid=2443Highways Agency 50 Years of Motorways, http://www.highways.gov.uk/knowledge/20994.htm The event was held on the 50th anniversary of the opening of Preston By-pass, adjacent to the spot where the Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan had opened the first section of motorway. The plaque is sited at the back of the footway/cycleway adjacent to the A59 at M6 Junction 31. It is immediately to the west of Samlesbury Bridge, which takes the M6 over the River Ribble, at this location.

It is a popular sports fish and is the largest and most commercially valuable flounder in the western North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico.Paralichthys lethostigma Smithsonian Marine Station at Fort Pierce. Species reports It is a \\"left-eyed flounder\\", meaning the left side is pigmented and is the \\"up side\\".Flounder Texas Parks and Wildlife Department species descriptions  Description  The body color is brown with diffuse, unocellated spots and blotches. This species typically grows to around 12-14 inches in length.Southern flounder South Carolina Department of Natural Resources species descriptions  Diet  Larval and postlarval southern flounder feed on zooplankton. As juveniles, the southern flounder's diet consists of small invertebrates, and shifts to larger invertebrates and fish as they reach adult size. Southern flounder feed on the bottom of the ocean and in the water column, and are considered to be near top predators.  Habitat  Adult fish breed and spend the warmer season in coastal embayments and nearshore shelf waters, where the eggs develop until they are late stage larvae, which are then pushed by currents into the estuaries where the fish settle into the sediment and grow into juveniles. The juveniles stay in the estuaries until they reach sexual maturity and leave to spawn. The southern flounder can survive in lower salinities and have even been found to use freshwater habitats both as juveniles and as adults.  Reproduction and life cycle  Juvenile southern flounder stay in estuaries, and most leave to spawn offshore during the fall and winter as adults. Young fish are eventually pushed into the estuaries by ocean currents to mature. Southern flounder reach sexual maturity around two years of age. Older, larger fish tend to begin the spawning migration earlier. Female fish both grow faster and live longer than males. The annual growth cycle of the southern flounder starts in the spring and ends in the fall as the water temperature decreases. Males live for around 5 years, and females live for around 7‚Äì8 years.  Distribution  The southern flounder is distributed across the western north Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. This species is listed by the IUCN as near threatened due to both commercial and recreational overfishing, and mortality from the shrimp trawl industry. This species is also affected by habitat destruction from human causes.  Importance to humans  Southern flounders are a major and valuable species in the highly important commercial and recreational flounder fishery in the Gulf of Mexico. Most of the commercial catch in the Gulf of Mexico is incidental to the catch by shrimp trawlers. Recreationally, they can easily be caught by anglers on a line with either a lure or live bait. Another popular form of collecting flounders is by night gigging. In this sport, anglers use a gig, or a multi-pronged spear, to impale the fish after using a flashlight to spot it in the waters at night. Southern flounder caught in New Jersey by an angler Southern flounder are also considered valuable as an aquaculture species because of their ability to live in water of varying salinities. Research has been conducted on using soy based protein sources rather than fish meal to grow the fish to reduce environmental impact.  Etymology  The genus name, Paralichthys, is usually interpreted as \\"parallel fish\\" in reference to the deeply compressed body shape. However, some interpret it as \\"close to the sea\\", from the Greek word, para, meaning beside or near. This can be in reference to the way it buries itself in the sand and lies flat as if it is a part of the sea floor itself. The species name, lethostigma, comes from the Latin word, letho, meaning death, and the Greek word, stigma, meaning spots. The meaning \\"forgotten spots\\" or \\"death of spots\\" refers to the absences of conspicuous large occellaed spots that is common in other species of flatfish.

Bindon. \\"Thom, Adam\\", in the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, University of Toronto and Universit√© Laval, 2000, retrieved 1 February 2009) was a teacher, journalist, lawyer, public servant, and recorder.  Biography  Adam Thom was born in Brechin, in the Tayside region in Scotland. His father was Andrew Thom, a merchant, and his mother Elizabeth Bisset. He entered the King's College in 1819 and obtained a Master of Arts in 1824. He taught briefly at the Udny Academy, in Aberdeenshire and also in a school of Woolwich where he settled. He published a grammar of Latin entitled The Complete Gradus in 1832. He emigrated to Lower Canada in 1832 and settled in Montreal. He began articling in the law office of James Charles Grant. In January 1833, he became editor of the Settler, or British, Irish and Canadian Gazette until its closing on 31 December 1833. The Anti-Canadian opinions he expressed in his newspaper gave him the nickname of \\"Dr. Slop\\" in the Vindicator and Canadian Advertiser edited by patriot Edmund Bailey O'Callaghan. In November 1833, he was appointed secretary of the Beefsteak Club, which gathered some of the richest merchants of Montreal. He went back to teaching at the Montreal Academical Institution. He published a public letter addressed to Colonial Secretary Lord Stanley in 1834. In January 1835, he became editor of the Montreal Herald. He strongly opposed the policy of governor Gosford, which he judged too conciliating toward the parliamentary majority. In February 1836, he published the Anti-Gallic Letters, a collection of texts addressed to Gosford, which he originally signed under the pseudonym of Camillus in the Montreal Herald between September 1835 and January 1836. He was admitted to the Bar of Lower Canada in 1837. On 25 August 1838, Lord Durham who replaced Gosford, appointed him assistant commissioner in the commission on municipal administration presided by Charles Buller. He became the spokesman of Durham and the paper he wrote with fellow assistant commissioner William Kennedy was included in the Report on the Affairs of British North America. In December, he embarked for England to help with the drafting of the final document. He left England for Red River Colony to fill the position of recorder offered to him by George Simpson, governor of the Hudson's Bay Company. He was asked to reform the administration of justice, and to codify the laws of the colony. He arrived at Red River in the Spring 1839. In 1840, the King's College made him a doctor of laws. His career as a jurist for the Hudson's Bay Company was animated. He refused to use the French language, which he knew, even though the duties of his office required it. In 1845, he condemned to death a Saulteaux Indian by the name of Capineseweet, although according to the law, all capital cases had to be tried in Upper Canada. He entered in conflict with the M√©tis, which were mainly French-speaking and Catholic, when he recommended the governor Assiniboia, Alexander Christie, to repress the business of small independent fur traders on the company's territory. In consequence of the measures taken by the government, Pierre-Guillaume Sayer was tried before the court on 17 May 1849 and was declared guilty of illicit possession of furs by the jury. He was however unconditionally released and permitted to keep the furs in spite of the verdict, because the M√©tis who attended the trial, Louis Riel Sr. at their head, made it clear they were not going to let it happen. The M√©tis submitted a petition to the governor of the Hudson's Bay Company, George Simpson, in which they asked for the resignation of Thom. During a special meeting on 31 May 1849, the Council of Assiniboia arrived to a compromise with Thom, who agreed to make use of the French language in the performance of his duties. He however continued to displease a good part of the population of River Red and in the autumn of 1850, Louis Riel Sr. again requested his resignation. On 10 April 1851, Simpson informed Thom that he was relieved of his duties as recorder. Many of his duties were assumed by John Black, his former deputy. He however kept the title of clerk of the Court of Assiniboia and even continued to receive the same annual salary of ¬£700. He left Red River for Edinburgh in 1854. In 1865, he settled in London. He died in that city on 21 February 1890. His son, Adam Bisset Thom, inherited his fortune.

The Shock Theater package included Dracula, Frankenstein, The Mummy, The Invisible Man and The Wolf Man as well as a few non-horror spy and mystery films. A second package, Son of Shock, was released for television by Screen Gems in 1958, with 20 horror films from both Universal and Columbia. Horror Hosts Shock Theater usually aired on late night television on weekends, and in many markets was introduced by a costumed horror host;\\"Night Harbingers of Horror\\", Life, May 26, 1958, p. 63. a well-known example was Zacherley (John Zacherle) on Philadelphia's WCAU-TV (as 'Roland') in 1957‚Äì1958, and New York's WABC-TV in 1958‚Äì1959. Prior to Zacherely's arrival at WABC-TV, Shock Theater was hosted off-camera by ABC Staff Announcer Scott Vincent and three other ABC staff announcers who worked in rotation. Shock Theater continued the American tradition of horror film television shows that originated with Vampira (Maila Nurmi) at Los Angeles KABC-TV in 1954‚Äì1955. Shock Theater programs in major cities were often introduced by local hosts in the style of Zacherley or Vampira such as Terry Bennett's Marvin on Chicago's WBKB-TV.Okuda, Ted & Yurkiw, Mark 'Chicago TV Horror Movie Shows from Shock Theatre to Svengoolie Lake Claremont Press 2007 With the varying lengths of the features ranging from the 58 minutes of The Cat Creeps to the 99 minute Son of Frankenstein, the host's sequences could pad out the broadcast to a standard time slot. One of the most innovative of the series was produced during 1962-63 at the Los Angeles Television station KTLA-TV which was owned by Gene Autry. Autry brought in Bill Aken as musical director and overall producer. Aken re-vamped the commercial breaks making them as entertaining as the films themselves. With spooky music and actors costumed as monsters such as Frankenstein and Dracula, the commercials for sponsor Baldwin Chevrolet took on a whole new aspect. Host Joe Salazar was driven onto the set in an ambulance carrying a coffin which Salazar would emerge from to start the show. Joined by 'Monsters' in all the Chevrolet commercials, with a special theme song, the show garnered an avid fan base all over the Los Angeles area during the two years it was on the air. Screen Gems acquired a 10-year lease of the television rights to 550 Universal Pictures features in June 1957, with the intention of packaging them by formats and stars, including horror, crime, and comedy.\\"SG to 'Program' Universal's 550\\", Billboard, June 17, 1957, p. 18. The first Shock package was an instant success nationwide. Viewership measurements in five key television markets (New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Philadelphia, San Antonio) showed the program boosting ratings anywhere from 38 percent to 1,125 percent.\\"Huge Ratings Jumps Show Dialers Flocking to 'Shock!'\\", Billboard, Oct. 14, 1957, p. 8. Shock Theater stimulated interest in the classic horror films and actors, evidenced by the launching of Forrest J Ackerman's Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine in early 1958. Since 1957, Shock Theater has become a generic term, referencing either late night television showings of horror films in general or the genre of early horror films with their emphasis on spooky mood and implied horror, as opposed to the explicitly graphic horror films that followed.

Started in February 1989, it continued under various subtitles and publishing companies until 1995. Initially a monthly publication (from 1989 until 1991), Ritam's publishing frequency became fairly irregular from the beginning of the breakup of Yugoslavia in 1991 until the end of its run. History Ritam was founded in 1989 with the subtitle of Meseƒçni vodiƒç kroz popularnu muziku, film, video, strip... i jo≈° vi≈°e! (Monthly guide through popular music, film, video, comics... and more!). It was co-published by two companies ‚Äî Sportinvest from Belgrade and ROID Vuk Karad≈æiƒá from Paraƒáin. The magazine's first editor-in- chief was Momƒçilo Rajin. The first Ritam issue, featuring U2 band members, actor Jackie Chan, and comic book character Corto Maltese on the cover, was released on February 1, 1989. Until June 1990, 14 issues were released. From September 1990, the magazine adopted a new name, Novi Ritam (The New Rhythm), as well as a shortened subtitle, Meseƒçni vodiƒç kroz popularnu kulturu (Monthly guide through popular culture), and Rajin's post was taken over by Branko Vukojeviƒá. The magazine staffers also registered their own publishing company called Ritam, and continued to cooperate with Paraƒáin's Vuk Karad≈æiƒá. This lasted until May 1991, during which time 8 issues appeared. At the end of 1992, following a year-and-a-half long gap, the magazine's third incarnation appeared, entitled Ritam again. Under editorship of Dragan Ambroziƒá, and in addition to Ritam publishing company, record label Sorabia Disc was also listed as the magazine's publisher. Only two issues appeared under this setup, the first in October, with Rambo Amadeus on the cover, and the second in December, with Michael Stipe on the cover. In 1993, Ritam's fourth incarnation appeared. Again with Ambroziƒá as editor-in-chief, and with the subtitle Vodiƒç kroz popularnu kulturu (Guide through popular culture), the annual issue was published for the year 1993. Five more issues came out from May 1994 until June 1995 with irregular frequency. In 2004, online magazine Popboks was founded, containing a digitalized archive of Ritam.

He batted right and threw left-handed. He was born in Floyd, Arkansas and died in North Little Rock, Arkansas. He was inducted into the Arkansas Sports Hall of Fame in 1962. Roberson is also known as John Henry Robinson and Rube Robinson. Early Minor League Career Robinson was a successful semi-pro pitcher in Beebe, Arkansas, when he was recruited by the Argenta Shamrocks of the Arkansas State League in early July, 1908. He soon moved to the Newport Pearl Diggers in the same league, where he posted a 9-5 record. In 1909, Robinson pitched for Jonesboro in the Arkansas State League until a trade to Waco of the Texas league in mid-season. Robinson did not report to Waco, but returned instead to his home in Floyd, Arkansas, and pitched on the local semi-pro team until Newport secured his rights in August. According to newspaper accounts his combined win total with Jonesboro and Newport was at least 21 victories. Robinson won 14 games in 1910 with El Reno in the Western Association before the team failed financially on July 30, 1910. He finished the year with Caruthersville, Missouri in the Northeast Arkansas League. Newspaper accounts credit him with at least 7 more wins at Caruthersville. Robinson had an outstanding minor league season in 1911 with the Fort Worth Panthers in the Texas League. He won 28 games for Fort Worth and despite pitching only one season in the league, he was named to the Texas League Hall of Fame in 2011. Major League Career Robinson's career major league record was 42-37. After a brief trial with the Pirates in late 1911, he enjoyed two successful seasons with Pittsburgh in 1912 and 1913. His combined record with the Pirates was 26 - 17. Robinson was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals in the winter of 1913 and pitched for the Cardinals in 1914 and 1915. Manager Miller Huggins tried to convert Robinson to a reliever during his time in St. Louis, but arm trouble limited Robinson's success. His record with the Cardinals was 14-16, over the two seasons. Robinson preferred to remain near his Arkansas home and throughout his career turned down major league opportunities to remain in Arkansas. He was optioned by the Cardinals to the Pacific Coast League in the winter of 1915, but refused to report. Reluctantly, the Cardinals optioned him to the Little Rock Travelers for the 1916 and 1917 seasons. He was 32 - 18 over those seasons. In 1918, Robinson was 8-2 for Little Rock when the Southern Association closed the season on June 30 due to the effects of World War I. Miller Huggins, Robinson's former manager and now manager of the Yankees, signed him to finish the season for New York. Robinson was 2-4 with the Yankees before leaving unexpectedly in mid-August. His last game with the Yankees would be his last in the major leagues. Ironically, the game on August 12, 1918, resulted in a 2 - 1 victory for Robinson over the Red Sox. The losing pitcher for Boston was Babe Ruth. Although only a .170 hitter (37-for-218) in the majors, he fielded his position well, posting a .990 fielding percentage with only 2 errors in 210 total chances in 701 innings of work. Little Rock Travelers Hank \\"Rube\\" Robinson pitched all or part of 13 consecutive season's with the Little Rock Travelers from 1916 to 1928. During his career he won 190 games and pitched over 3,000 innings for the Travelers. His best seasons were the 1920 season when he won 26 games for the league champion Travelers and 1922 when he matched the 26 win total. Robinson was traded to Atlanta in June 1928 and pitched parts of two seasons with the Crackers. He was released in June 1929. Later Years In 1930 Robinson managed the Missouri Pacific Railroad semi- pro team to a national championship. He spent his later years as a volunteer in youth baseball and an employee of the Arkansas Highway Department. Robinson died in 1965 and is buried in North Little Rock, Arkansas, as John Henry Roberson.

Salter is also a proponent of geoengineering and is responsible for creating the concept of the mechanical enhancement of clouds to achieve cloud reflectivity enhancement. The wide tank at the University of Edinburgh‚Äîa novel design and invention by Salter, built in 1977‚Äîwas the world's first multi-directional wave tank equipped with absorbing wavemakers. Feedback control systems on the wavemaking flaps were used for the absorption of reflected waves, propagating along the water surface of the tank interior towards the 89 flaps. Salter is a Specialist Advisor at wave energy company Aquamarine Power advising on the development of the Oyster wave energy converter. Salter was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2004 Birthday Honours for services to engineering. In 2012 he received the Royal Academy of Engineering Sustained Achievement Award. Salter \\"has been one of the leading voices\\" of the marine cloud brightening movement. Salter's duck While historic references to the power of waves do exist, the modern scientific pursuit of wave energy was begun in the 1970s by Salter, in response to the oil crisis. His 1974 invention became known as Salter's Duck or Nodding Duck, although it was officially referred to as the \\"Edinburgh Duck\\". In small scale controlled tests, the Duck's curved cam-like body can stop 90% of wave motion and can convert 90% of that to electricity. According to sworn testimony before the House of Parliament, The UK Wave Energy programme was shut down on 19 March 1982, in a closed meeting. An analysis of Salter's Duck resulted in a miscalculation of the estimated cost of energy production by a factor of 10, an error which was only recently identified. Some wave power advocates believe that this error, combined with a general lack of enthusiasm for renewable energy in the 1980s (after oil prices fell), hindered the advancement of wave power technology.
