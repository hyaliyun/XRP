Kuma was on anti-submarine warfare exercises. She was flanked by destroyers and Tally-Ho could not get within range. She was able to plot the Japanese's route in and out of Penang and to take up a suitable position to intercept the cruiser. On the morning of 11 January, Tally-Ho's commander, Leslie Bennington, spotted a Mitsubishi F1M2 Pete floatplane flying westwards along the route on which the cruiser that had been sighted on 9 January was to be expected. It was felt that this heralded the approach of the cruiser. Just before 09:00, the officer of the watch sighted the masts of the cruiser on the port bow. Kuma had a destroyer‚ÄîUranami‚Äîas an escort. Whilst north west of Penang, at midday, Bennington fired a seven-torpedo salvo from .

She documented the role of the Protestant Reformation in the Poor Clares convent in Geneva. Early life Born to Louis and Jeanne de Jussie in Jussy-l'√©v√®que ‚Äì in the former province of Chablais ‚Äì Jeanne was the youngest of six children who survived infancy. She was apparently schooled in Geneva. Her father Louis died before 1519, leaving an estate; Jeanne's uncle, Am√©d√©e, named his own son (Georges) heir to the family castle in Jussy-l'√âv√™que, causing protest from Louis' wife and children. After a costly legal battle, the family was forced out of the castle and Jeanne's brothers sold off the remaining property. Jeanne would leave for the convent in 1521 at the age of 18. Her mother would pass away in 1535.Carrie F. Klaus, Volume Editor's introduction to The Short Chronicle (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006).Carrie F. Klaus, ‚ÄúArchitecture and Sexual Identity: Jeanne de Jussie's Narrative of the Reformation of Geneva,‚Äù Feminist Studies 29, no. 4 (2003): 281. Convent life The Poor Clares swore to ‚Äúchastity, poverty, obedience, and enclosure.‚Äù Although dowries were not required, families often provided a monetary contribution. Poor Clares kept short hair cuts and went barefoot, wearing wool garments, a coat, a linen hood and headband, and a simple rope belt with four knots to represent the four vows. They were excused from fasting only on Christmas and during illness. Otherwise, the nuns occupied themselves with housekeeping and chores. Because of her education, Jeanne was appointed the convent's secretary by 1530. She would be responsible for writing letters as the convent's √©crivaine to plead protection from the Duke of Savoy, the bishop, and other officials. The Convent of Saint Clare in Geneva (or ‚ÄúMonast√®re J√©sus de Bethl√©em‚Äù), established by Yolande of Valois in 1473, was situated where the Palais de Justice now stands. Because of Yolande's marriage to the Duke of Savoy the convent would maintain a close connection to the House of Savoy. In fact, Jeanne opens her work with mentions of Charles III of Savoy (Duke of Savoy) and Beatrice of Portugal (Duchess of Savoy), as well as their children ‚ÄúLouis, Monseigneur the Prince of Piedmont,‚Äù Philibert Emmanuel (Emanuele Filiberto), ‚ÄúLady Catherine Charlotte,‚Äù and Philippe.Jeanne de Jussie, The Short Chronicle, trans. Carrie F. Klaus (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006), 37‚Äì38. Fran√ßois, Count of Gruy√®re, donated land for the convent, which would begin construction in 1474 after purchasing additional land from Andr√© Baudichon and Claude Granger. The abbess at the time of Jeanne's writing was Louise Rambo, assisted by vicaress Pernette de Montluel, who would succeed Rambo after her death in 1538. Jeanne was elected abbess in 1548 after their move to the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Annecy in 1535 and passed the position to Claude de Pierrefleur after her death in 1561. Twenty- four nuns lived in the convent at the time Jeanne wrote The Short Chronicle, likely with eight discreets- as prescribed by the order of Saint Clare- portresses, a bursar, cooks, a nurse, lay sisters, tertiary sisters, and possibly a laundress, a sacristan, and a gardener. Because of the constant pillaging by Reformers, at times only the church of the convent remained open in the city- eventually forced to close- and priests and monks no longer wore their habits. Eventually, the situation came to a point where clerics carried weapons to defend themselves when in public. After moving to the Monastery of the Holy Cross in Annecy in 1535, the convent was officially dissolved on July 8, 1793. The building was turned into a hospital, then the Palais de Justice. The monastery where they found refuge was turned into a cotton mill with a plaque commemorating the Poor Clares. The Short Chronicle 1535 The work might have been written between 1535 and 1547.Kirsi Stjerna, Women and the Reformation (Malden, Mass: Blackwell Publishing, 2009), 27. According to Helmut Feld, Jeanne began writing around 1535 as a record for future nuns. Both extant copies of the manuscript are available at the Library of Geneva. It was first published in 1611 by the Catholic press of the Fr√®res Du Four in Chamb√©ry as Le levain du Calvinisme, ou commencement de l'heresie de Geneve (The Leaven of Calvinism, or Beginning of the Heresy of Geneva), despite the fact that Jeanne never mentions Calvin directly in the text. In the 19th century translations appeared in Italian and German, as well as critical editions in French. Finally, in 1996 a complete version of the text was published by Helmut Feld as Petite chronique, the basis for an English translation by Carrie F. Klaus. Henri Roth wrote a master's thesis on the chronicle, as well as an article in the Revue du Vieux Gen√®ve. Scholars today often study the text from a feminist view. Jeanne argued that ‚Äúwomen were truer Catholics than men,‚Äù fighting for their chastity against heretics such as Marie Denti√®re, who would attempt to persuade the nuns to marry.Jo Ann Kay McNamara, Sisters in Arms: Catholic Nuns through Two Millennia (Cambridge, Mass: Harvard University Press, 1996), 436‚Äì440. The perspective provided in the chronicle provided evidence that ‚Äúwomen played a more active role‚Äù in the Reformation than previously assumed.Jane Dempsey Douglass, Women, Freedom, and Calvin (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1985), 101, quoted in Stjerna, Women and the Reformation, 28. Jeanne not only describes events such as battles from the point of view of women and wives but recounts the instances in which they were ‚Äúseverely beaten, tricked, and tortured‚Äù for their beliefs, especially by their husbands. She went so far as to insist that women surpassed men in making deliberate decisions to preserve their religion. However, no other female authors would come to fame after the Genevan reformed church established women as subordinate. Jeanne's account also presents the importance of ‚Äúprivacy and sexual segregation‚Äù in the convent, dramatizing the struggle as an assault on the nuns' right to their own space. Several groups attempted to break into the convent, prevented largely by its architecture. More generally, the text also offers a Catholic perspective on the Protestant Reformation in Geneva, normally linked to Jean Calvin's advances starting in 1536. Some sources praise the chronicle for its literary merit.Arthur Tilley, The Literature of the French Renaissance, (London: Cambridge University Press, 1904), 242. =Historical references= Jeanne's writing, alternating between first- and second-person perspective, encapsulates Catholic sentiments of the time and provides an account of events between 1526‚Äì1535 as a witness and active defendant against the Reformation. She employs derogatory terms for Protestants, indiscriminately calling them Lutherans, Mammelukes, and Huguenots with only Catholics as true Christians. Like others at the time, Jeanne compares her enemies to Jews and Turks. She provides a short description of the Grand Turk as ‚Äúa glutton and a disloyal, insatiable dog‚Äù for having an unlimited number of wives as representative of the Turkish culture and defends disrespectful acts of Catholics towards others such as pouring urine on a heretic's grave. Throughout the work she describes the work of Protestants to destroy or pillage Catholic property, especially monasteries and churches, among them Vufflens-le-Ch√¢teau, Allaman Castle, Castle of Perroy, Nyon Castle, Rolle Castle, Castle of Saconnex, Ch√¢teau Gaillard, Castle of Villette, the castles of Madame of Saint-Genix and Madame of Rossylon, the church of Annemasse, Castle of Confignon, and Castle of Peney. Jeanne mentions the Shroud of Turin, then owned by the Duke of Savoy. She also uses saints' holidays to reference calendar dates, typical of Catholic nuns. Jeanne also describes general events. The plague was mentioned in 1530, spread by heretics who ‚Äúplotted to kill all the leaders‚Äù by ‚Äú[rubbing] it on the locks of doors and... in fruits and in handkerchiefs.‚Äù She mentions Martin Luther's Ninety-five Theses in 1518 and his subsequent excommunication by Pope Leo X. The Battle of Kappel took place in 1531. Halley's comet was seen the same year; another comet was again visible from August to November in 1532. The Grand Turk's army would be defeated in Esztergom, followed by a letter sent from him to the Pope. Jeanne by no means strives for what we would today describe as historical accuracy. Along with an apparent bias, she often credits her knowledge to gossip.Francis Henry Gribble, Lake Geneva and its Literary Landmarks (New York: Archibald Constable & Co. Ltd., 1901), 52. However, her chronicle holds importance in its singularity against the works of countless Reformers in Geneva. =Summary= The Short Chronicle's narrative involves many historical figures and dates important to the Protestant Revolution in Geneva and the surrounding areas. Jeanne names Pierre de la Baume as the bishop of Geneva in 1526, whom she calls the Monseigneur of Geneva throughout the chronicle. Jeanne claims Guillaume Farel gave a sermon in German, although more likely she mistook him for Gaspard Grossman. The Bishop of Belley was requested to help the city prevent future pillaging to no avail. Finally, Farel arrived in Geneva with two associates (Pierre Robert Oliv√©tan and Antoine Saunier), all tried by the Abbott of Bonmont and thrown out of the city. They would be followed by Antoine Froment. On March 28, 1533, a battle between Catholics and Protestants took place, described largely from the view of women and wives and finally resolved with the exchange of hostages and, later, peaceful laws. That December, both sides would prepare for civil war, witnessed personally by Jeanne. However, the government officials pacified them. From that point on, however, the situation for Catholics became increasingly dangerous. Jeanne reports constant cases of destruction to Catholic property, especially as iconoclastic actions, as well as executions. Four heretical preachers (Guillaume Farel, Pierre Viret, Antoine Froment, and Alexandre Canus) entered the city to preach and another battle almost occurred that December. Farel began to baptize and marry Protestants in 1534. A woman named Hemme Faulson visited the convent to see her aunt (Claudine Lignotte) and her sister (Blaisine Varembert) but was turned away after attempting to convert them. Defacement of Catholic icons reached a peak that summer and the bishop excommunicated the Genevans. In September, a captain from Bern breached the convent walls on orders to inspect the building, and from then on it would be targeted for abuse. After Farel and Viret establish themselves in a nearby monastery, they often harass the convent and distribute heretical articles to advertise a disputation, which was promptly forbidden by the bishop. Heretics came to the convent to inform the nuns that they were required to attend, but they remained vigilant. Later the father confessor recounted what he witnessed at the disputation: Reformer Jaques Bernard continuously lost his arguments against the Dominican friar Jean Chapuis, so Chapuis was excluded from the remaining days. Farel and Viret then attempt to preach at the convent, forcefully separating the nuns. After Hemme Faulson returns she initiates a long, successful affair to retrieve her sister Blaisine from the convent as well as much of its possessions under the claim that they belonged to Blaisine. In addition to Hemme Faulson and her sister, Marie Denti√®re, Claude Bernard, Claudine Levet, and city syndics approached the nuns, finally culminating in the nuns' decision to leave. After stopping in Saint-Julien and the Castle of La Perri√®re, where they resumed the cloistered life, the nuns finally arrived in Annecy, where they established themselves in the Monastery of the Holy Cross. Jeanne devotes the last pages of her chronicle to the family of Savoy, who provide shelter on the way to and within Annecy. =Women= Jeanne dedicates a section of the account to the ‚Äústaunchness‚Äù of Catholic women. These women refused to join their Protestant husbands and were punished. Jeanne especially praises young women and daughters for defying their fathers. She recounts those who sneaked out of prison, chased after men who took away and tortured Catholics, and one who stole her baby from a Lutheran baptism. Celibacy Throughout The Short Chronicle Jeanne goes so far as to forsake marriage as heresy. She admits that she has witnessed the corruption of priests but assures the reader that those deeds would not go unpunished. At some points, she refuses to describe marriages performed by Reformers such as Farel to shield herself from its perversion. Eventually, Reformers would breach the convent and preach their ideas of marriage, attempting to force the nuns to take a spouse. At other points, she simply records those events by insulting the married couple and Reformers as ‚Äú[having] a very bad reputation,‚Äù ‚Äúbastard,‚Äù ‚Äúwicked,‚Äù and ‚Äúmiserable.‚Äù Except in the case of Blaisine Varembert, the Reformers lost interest after the nuns refused to cooperate; they were given a safe departure from the city. Marie Denti√®re Jeanne most famously defends herself against Marie Denti√®re, a former nun. They disagreed most particularly about chastity and virtue and the right of women to preach. Jeanne calls her a ‚Äúfalse, wrinkled abbess with a devilish tongue‚Äù who ‚Äúmeddled in preaching and perverting pious people.‚Äù Jean Calvin himself ridiculed Denti√®re's ideas.

The subspecies was first described by Kenneth Neil in 1979. Description =Physical= O. l. sablensis shares many common characteristics with its mainland counterpart, O. l. plagiata. Males and females of O. l. sablensis share the same antennae, palpi, genitalia and vestiture as O. l. plagiata. Males of the subspecies have a rusty brown coloured forewing and have marking similar to that O. l. plagiata but are generally less distinctive. The grey colouring found on the median area of O. l. plagiata are generally absent in males on Sable Island, reduced to a small patch of colouring or absent altogether. The discal dot for males of the subspecies is obscure and indistinct. The undersides of both wings in males are a rusty brown colour, while the upper-sides are a solid rusty brown. Females of the subspecies are a very light grey colour, and have small wing pads present. =Behavior= Like O. l. plagiata, O. l. sablensis has a flight period that occurs from late July to mid-September. The subspecies is a general feeder, and its larva has been found in blueberry, cranberry, bayberry and several species of sedges and grasses.

Stovall (born February 19, 1944) is a retired Brigadier General in the United States Air Force who figured prominently in several search and rescue operations during the Vietnam War. A member of the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron based in Thailand, on June 2, 1972, he recovered Capt. Roger Locher from deep inside North Vietnam, the deepest rescue made during the entire Vietnam War. For his efforts in rescuing Locher, Stovall was awarded the Air Force Cross, which described how \\"he willingly returned to this high threat area, braving intense ground fire, to recover the downed airman from deep in North Vietnam.\\". Stovall was also recognized with the 1973 Jabara Award for Airmanship, two Silver Star awards and two Distinguished Flying Cross awards for other combat rescues among the 12 successful rescue missions he accomplished during his tour in Southeast Asia. Stovall retired from the Air Force as a Brigadier General on June 1, 1993. Background Stovall was born in Toppenish, Washington, and enlisted with the US Air Force in June 1962.http://www.veterantributes.org/TributeDetail.php?recordID=1165 The following year, he was accepted to the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado, and graduated with the class of 1967. =Rescue of Roger Locher= During the initial phase of Operation Linebacker in May 1972, an American F-4D was shot down by a North Vietnamese Shenyang J-6. Pilot Maj. Robert Lodge refused to eject, butDavies, Peter F-4 Phantom II vs. MiG-21: USAF & VPAF in the Vietnam War (Osprey, 2008), p62 his weapons officer Roger Locher was able to get out of the aircraft. Locher landed, unseen by either friendly or enemy forces, only from Hanoi, North Vietnam. Capt. Locher evaded capture and covered over , gradually losing and his strength. On June 1, 1972, his 22nd day behind enemy lines, he was finally able to contact a flight of American jets overhead, calling, \\"Any U.S. aircraft, if you read Oyster 1 Bravo, come up on Guard\\". Lt. James Dunn and others, including Capt. Steve Ritchie in one of the F-4 aircraft overhead, heard his radio call and remembered Locher's call sign. When the aircraft answered, Locher calmly responded, \\"Guys I've been down here a long time, any chance of picking me up?\\" His transmissions left some Americans who did not hear his call in doubt about the authenticity of his message, and they believed that the NVA may have manipulated a POW into impersonating him, setting a trap for the would-be rescuers. =Rescue operation= Capt. Stovall, based at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Navy Base in Thailand responded, piloting a HH-53 from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron along with a rescue force consisting of several A-1Hs and another HH-53. As they neared Locher's position, the A-1 Skyraiders and HH-53C helicopters came under attack from two MiGs, several surface-to-air missiles and gunfire. The rescue force eluded one MiG in a narrow canyon, but were eventually driven back by the enemy fire and failed to get through to Locher on June 1. On June 2, 1972, General John Vogt, commander of the 7th Air Force canceled the entire strike mission set for Hanoi on that day. He sent a task force of 119 aircraft including Stovall piloting his HH-53 rescue helicopter, bombers, and an array of F-4 escorts, EB-66s, A-1Hs, F105G Weasels, and KC135 tankers to get Locher out. \\"We shut down the war to go get Roger Locher,\\" Stovall later said. Capt. Ronald E. Smith in an A-1H guided Capt. Stovall to Locher's position. Only when Locher rose out of the jungle canopy riding the jungle penetrator were all of the Americans sure it was him. Despite their proximity to Y√™n B√°i Air Base, no aircraft were lost during Locher's rescue. At only 60 miles (97 km) from Hanoi, it was the deepest rescue inside North Vietnam during the Vietnam War.

Located in Muskegon County in the western portion of the Lower Peninsula, it is the type site for a certain type of Late Woodland period pottery produced by the Ottawa tribe.Emerson, Thomas E., et al. Late Woodland Societies: Tradition and Transformation Across the Midcontinent. Lincoln: U of Nebraska P, 2000, 550. The Michigan Archaeology Society excavated the Spring Creek Site in 1955 and 1956. Their results gained significant attention because of the large amounts of pottery recovered from the site.Brown, James A. \\"Review: Contributions to Michigan Archaeology\\". American Anthropologist 71.6 (1969): 1213-1214. The excavation covered approximately of land, finding sherds of 966 different pottery vessels.Fitting, James E., and Charles E. Cleland. \\"Late Prehistoric Settlement Patterns in the Upper Great Lakes\\". Ethnohistory 16.4 (1969): 289-302. This contrasts significantly with the number of stone tools at the village: lithic cores, bifaces, scrapers, lithic flakes, and other types of stone tools together only amounted to 344 objects. Such a large ratio of pottery to stone tools has been taken to suggest that the village was the year-round home of many women instead of being a seasonal hunting camp that only men would occupy. The uniformity of pottery at the site has enabled archaeologists to use it as a basis for radiocarbon dating of similar pottery from other sites in the region. Inhabited during the tenth century AD, Spring Creek appears to have been typical of Woodland period villages in the Great Lakes region: like many others in the region, it was the home of people who both farmed extensively and engaged in hunting. The number of animal bones found at the site is very small ‚Äî only enough to feed three individuals per year. Other evidence indicates a large population at the site; as a result, it is believed that most meat eaten at Spring Creek was processed at another location. Typical Ottawa villages were inhabited only by women and by old men during most of the year: the men of the village would generally gather into hunting parties that would make extended journeys from home, often departing both during summer and winter; only those individuals who could not participate in the hunts would remain in the village year-round. Spring Creek is recognized as one of the best examples of an Ottawa semipermanent village. It contrasts greatly with sites such as northern Michigan's Juntunen Site: excavations at Juntunen produced vastly different types of pottery, while Spring Creek's artifacts are highly uniform in their style. The two sites were likewise far from similar in their uses: Juntunen is believed to have been a hunting camp that was occupied seasonally for centuries, rather than being intensively inhabited for a small number of years. These two sites, along with similar camps and villages along Lake Michigan, are the basis for a theoretical understanding of the Ottawa economy during the early portion of the Late Woodland period.

He has worked with Anonymous, LulzSec, and other similar groups. He was an associate of the Internet group Anonymous,Inside Anonymous‚Äô Secret War Room Inside Anonymous' Secret War Room ‚Äì Gizmodo, 18 Mar 2011 which has publicly claimed various online attacks, including hacking HBGary, Westboro Baptist Church, and Gawker. They have also claimed responsibility for the defacing of government websites in countries such as Zimbabwe, Syria, Tunisia, Ireland, and Egypt. After serving his time and staying off the Internet for two years, Jake Davis is now a security researcher, disclosing bugs to corporations as a part of their bounty programs.  Anonymous  Davis was a member of hacker collective Anonymous,Inside Anonymous‚Äô Secret War Room Inside Anonymous' Secret War Room ‚Äì Gizmodo, 18 Mar 2011 where he was involved in the attack on HBGary in response to Aaron Barr, then CEO of the organization, claiming to have unmasked various members of Anonymous. The stolen HBGary emails were published and the small team who had been responsible splintered from Anonymous calling itself LulzSec.  LulzSec  On 24 February 2011, Topiary gained attention after he appeared on The David Pakman Show. He informed the host that Anonymous had replaced a Westboro Baptist Church webpage with a message from Anonymous during an on-air confrontation with Shirley Phelps-Roper. A recording of this event was placed on YouTube, where it reached over one million views in five days. Topiary was a member of LulzSec, and ran their Twitter account. The Guardian made a claim in a report that Topiary's name was Daniel. On 14 July 2011, The Guardian published an exclusive interview with Topiary, in which he spoke extensively about his motivations. Describing himself as \\"an internet denizen with a passion for change\\" he said he feared being tracked by the authorities: \\"I can only hope that they haven't pinned any of us, especially my friends from LulzSec.\\" Later, a full transcript of the lengthy interview surfaced on the website of freelance Guardian journalist Ryan Gallagher.  Arrest  An 18-year-old man suspected of being Topiary was arrested in the Shetland islands of Scotland on 27 July 2011. On 31 July 2011, the man was charged with five offences including unauthorised computer access and conspiracy to carry out a distributed denial of service attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency's website. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Jake Davis, a resident of the island of Yell.United States of America v Jake Davis aka Topiary aka Atopiary et al ‚Äì United States District Court, Southern District of New York. Indictment 6 March 2012 He was charged with unauthorised access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977. Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that had 16 different virtual machines. The hard drive also contained details relating to an attack on Sony and hundreds of thousands of email addresses and passwords. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his mother and have no access to the Internet. His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicise LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacked the technical skills to have been anything but a sympathiser. After his arrest, Anonymous launched a 'Free Topiary' campaign, which included adding a \\"Free Topiary\\" banner to their Twitter avatars, similar to the Free Bradley banner.  Guilty plea  Davis pleaded guilty on 25 June 2012 to DDoS attacks on several websites, but pleaded not guilty to two counts of encouraging others to commit computer offenses and fraud. Davis was due to be tried along with Ryan Cleary (Ryan), Ryan Ackroyd (Kayla), Mustafa Al-Bassam (tflow), beginning 8 April 2013. The court was informed it would take 3,000 hours to view the material against Ackroyd alone. They were released on bail, except for Cleary. Davis was not tried for a number of other crimes perpetrated by LulzSec.  Court appearance  On 8 April 2013, Davis again appeared in court with fellow hackers, Ryan Ackroyd, Ryan Cleary and Mustafa Al-Bassam. All four pleaded guilty to computer crimes and were sentenced on 14 May 2013. Davis faced a maximum of 10 years in prison but got 24 months in a young offenders institute. He served 38 days because he had been electronically tagged for 21 months and this counted against his sentence.Former Lulzsec hacker Jake Davis on his motivations  References  Living people People associated with computer security Internet activists People from Yell, Shetland British computer criminals Anonymous (group) activists 1992 births ","title":"Topiary (hacktivist)"},{"id":"31472294","text":"Mikasz√≥wka Lock - the eleventh lock on the August√≥w Canal (from the Biebrza).

It runs from 800 West in Bluffdale to Interstate 15 (I-15).  Route description  SR-140 begins at an intersection with 800 West and 14600 South in Bluffdale, proceeding east on 14600 South. Following a crossing of the East Jordan Canal,, there is an intersection with SR-131 at Porter Rockwell Boulevard. SR-140 then turns southeast to meet SR-287 (known as Pony Express Road), which serves the Utah State Prison. Shortly thereafter, there is a single-point urban interchange with I-15, where SR-140 ends. The road continues east as Highland Drive toward Draper. Just beyond the end of the state route, Highland Drive passes under a disused railroad viaduct, previously used by the Union Pacific Railroad, that is proposed for use by phase 2 of the TRAX Blue Line's Draper extension. The highway is maintained by the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), who is responsible for maintaining highways in Utah. As part of this role, they regularly survey traffic on their highways. These surveys are mostly presented in the form of annual average daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles that travel a road during an average day during the year. In 2009, UDOT calculated that approximately 3,920 vehicles used SR 140 daily. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads important to the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. The former western terminus of SR-140, as seen from SR-68 northbound History State Route 140, otherwise known as Bluffdale Road, was first designated as State Route 160 in 1933, renamed to State Route 161 in 1935, and deleted from the state highway system in 1953. In 1984, the route was once again added to the state highway system, this time as SR-140 (and in the process co-opted from the south end of SR-287). In 2016, the segment of SR-140 west of 800 West was turned over to the city of Bluffdale. This was done in exchange for UDOT taking over the already-built segment of Porter Rockwell Boulevard as SR-131, with plans to build a bridge over the Jordan River to connect to SR-68 (Redwood Road). Former eastbound SR-140 in Bluffdale Prior to 2016, SR-140 began at an intersection with SR-68 in Bluffdale. It crossed the South Jordan Canal before turning south for about . It then turned east again and crossed the Jordan River. After an intersection with Spring View Parkway within a residential area, it bumped slightly northward to cross over the Union Pacific Railroad and the FrontRunner commuter rail line. An area near this crossing was considered as a possible location for a FrontRunner station, but the Draper Station was built much further north. It passed a Sherwin-Williams building before entering a more commercial area.

Artificial muscles  These types of artificial muscles are made possible by creating synthetic materials which are very similar to the ones which make up human tissues and cells. These artificial materials are so similar that the body does not reject the material and instead allows normal cell growth in the materials which eventually become absorbed into the body. = Self-assembled gel = The gel molecule is composed of a tetra-alkane benzene-1,2,4,5-tetracarboxamide. The gel structure is made up of millions of tiny fibres, which form a 3D mesh by trapping a liquid in the same way that a sponge absorbs water, to form a solid. The unique feature of self-assembled gels is that they don't require any chemical reactions to form the fibres; it is simply a case of heating them up in a liquid and waiting for them to set. = Uses = There is huge range of potential applications for these gels. Aside from the artificial muscles, we could also use these gels for drug delivery in cancer patients, where we can inject the patient with a gel and it will slowly release a constant stream of anti-cancer drugs in the body. There are also applications for computer and television screens, where we use gels for LCDs. These gels could lower the manufacturing costs and be used to construct flexible display screens.

Having previously run in the 2008 Republican primaries, this was Romney's second campaign for the presidency. He filed his organization with the Federal Elections Commission as an exploratory committee and announced the organization in a video message on April 11, 2011. He became the party's presumptive nominee with his victory in the Texas primary on May 29, 2012. On August 11, 2012, in Norfolk, Virginia, Romney announced that Paul Ryan, the long-time U.S. Representative for , would be his running mate for vice president. (Later, in October 2015, Ryan was elected Speaker of the House.) On August 30, 2012, in Tampa, Florida, Romney formally accepted the Republican Party's nomination at the 2012 Republican National Convention.Lemire, Jonathan. Mitt Romney accepts nomination with speech declaring that Obama failed, warning that America‚Äôs greatness is in danger, New York Daily News, August 31, 2012. Romney's campaign came to an end on November 6, 2012, upon defeat by incumbent President Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. Romney received 60,933,500 votes, or 47.2% of the total votes cast, winning 24 states and 206 electoral votes. Had he won, Romney would have been the first Michigan native to serve as president (as Gerald Ford was born in Nebraska), and the second governor of Massachusetts to do so, after Calvin Coolidge. Ryan would have been the first vice president from Wisconsin. Six years later, in November 2018, Romney was elected as U.S. Senator from Utah. Background After the 2008 election, Romney built a strategy for the 2012 presidential campaign and saved PAC money to underwrite salaries and consulting fees for his existing political staff and to build up a political infrastructure for what might become a $1 billion campaign three years hence. He also had a nationwide network of former staff and supporters eager for him to run again. He continued to give speeches and raise campaign funds on behalf of fellow Republicans. Romney declined a lucrative job as head of a hedge fund, and instead began a yearlong self-education on foreign and domestic issues. Romney finished first in the CPAC straw poll in 2009 and second in 2010 and 2011, won the Southern Republican Leadership Conference straw poll in 2010, and won the New Hampshire Straw Poll in 2011. Romney released his 2010 tax return in early January 2012, along with a partial 2011 return which he promised to release in whole upon its completion. During the presidential campaign, he decided not to disclose additional returns citing the matter as a distraction from more important issues. Despite his preparations, Romney remained unconvinced on whether to run again. In December 2010 he asked his immediate family to vote on a 2012 campaign. Unlike the unanimous support before the 2008 campaign, this time 10 family members voted against another try; only Romney's wife Ann and one son voted in favor, and Romney told family members that he would not run again. In the spring of 2011, his wife and political allies persuaded him to change his mind, telling Romney that they believed he could fix the economy. Campaign formation =Exploratory committee= Before a slower start to the presidential campaign by all contenders than four years previous, on April 11, 2011, Mitt Romney announced by means of a video recorded that day at an athletics field at the University of New Hampshire that he had formed an exploratory committee as a first step for a potential run for a Republican presidential campaign, saying, \\"It is time that we put America back on a course of greatness, with a growing economy, good jobs and fiscal discipline in Washington.\\" =Formal announcement= Romney formally announced his candidacy for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination at an outdoor gathering in Stratham, New Hampshire, on June 2, 2011.Elliott, Philip; Ramer, Holly \\"Romney opens presidential bid challenging Obama\\", Seattle Times. June 2, 2011.\\"Romney Announces Bid For Presidency\\", NPR. June 2, 2011. In his announcement speech, he pledged to make the U.S. economy the main focus of his campaign, saying \\"My number one job will be to see that America is number one in job creation.\\"\\"Mitt Romney kicks off 2012 presidential bid\\", USA Today, June 2, 2011. =Fundraising= On May 16, 2011, the Romney campaign announced that it had raised $10.25 million \\"in connection with today's call day fundraiser in Nevada.\\" This was hailed in the media as \\"an impressive one day total.\\" Thereafter, however, the Los Angeles Times reported that \\"the amount actually represented pledges gathered earlier and tallied that day, not just funds actually taken in by the campaign.\\" Later, it was discovered that Romney had actually raised $2.403 million on May 16, about a quarter of the claimed amount. Coney Island Restaurant in Livonia, Michigan, during a campaign stop, June 9, 2011. For the entire second quarter, the campaign expected to raise only about $20 million, less than the $44 million raised in that period in 2007 but still more than any of the other Republican candidates. By the end of June, Romney's campaign raised $18.5 million, which was $14 million more than U.S. Representative Ron Paul, who came 2nd in funding amongst Republican candidates. By the end of March 2012, Romney had raised $88 million, far more than his nearest Republican rival, Ron Paul ($36 million). President Barack Obama had raised $197 million, more than twice as much as Romney, and the Obama campaign had nearly 10 times as much cash on hand (over $100 million compared to Romney's $10 million). By the end of April, Romney was far outstripping Obama in large-value campaign contributions from individual donors: most (62%) of Romney's contributions were at the legal limit of $2,500, compared to 16% of Obama's. Obama fared better among small-value donors, with almost half (43%) of his donations at $200 or less, compared to only 10% of Romney's. Romney is also supported by the Super PAC called Restore Our Future. As of the end of February 2012, Restore Our Future had raised over $43 million. In an article about 2016 Presidential election fundraiser Mary Pat Bonner, 2012 campaign finance chair Zwick was mentioned in regards \\"fund- raising fees paid by Mr. Romney's [2012] campaign committees to limited liability companies established by Mr. Zwick: about $34 million, according to campaign disclosure reports\\".Confessore, Nicholas, \\"The Secret World of a Well-Paid ‚ÄòDonor Adviser‚Äô in Politics\\", New York Times, February 5, 2015.

The poll is traditionally considered an important barometer of the sentiments of conservative activists. The New York Times wrote that the Romney campaign was busing in students from along the East Coast to support Romney. Rick Santorum finished second in the straw poll with 31%. Politico reported that the Romney campaign bought CPAC registration tickets to the conference, while the Santorum campaign did not. =Iowa caucuses= Iowa Republican caucus results by county.

Polls Suggest Gingrich‚Äôs Support May Have Peaked, New York Times, January 25, 2012. At least 200,000 Floridians voted via absentee ballots or early voting, a factor thought to favor Romney who aggressively campaigned in Florida in early January. Romney participated in both of the four-man debates that were held on Monday, January 23 and Thursday, January 26. Romney released tax returns for 2010 and estimates for 2011. He showed income over that period of $42.5 million. His effective tax rate for 2010 was 13.9 percent, and he estimated that it would be 15.4 percent for 2011. About $13 million of his income was in \\"carried interest\\" and hence eligible for favorable tax treatment under a provision that Democrats have sought to end. It was also disclosed that Romney had investments in the Cayman Islands and previously had a Swiss bank account until it was closed in 2010. On January 31 Romney won the 2012 Florida primary with 46% of the vote. =Nevada caucuses= The Nevada Republican caucuses were held on Saturday, February 4.

Romney lost to the former Pennsylvania senator by 5 points in the Colorado caucus, finished third with 17% behind Ron Paul and Santorum in the Minnesota caucuses, and, in a contest that did not actually award any delegates and did not include Newt Gingrich on the ballot, lost the Missouri primary to Santorum by a 30-point margin.Steve Holland (February 8, 2012), \\"Three-state sweep revives Santorum's White House hopes\\" Reuters =Maine= Romney was initially declared the narrow winner of the Maine Caucus, but the results were subject to a recount after several counties were not counted.\\"Maine Republicans to recount votes that gave Romney a win.\\" Reuters.

CNN moderated a Republican primary debate in Mesa, Arizona on February 22, 2012. The Arizona Republican primary is 'winner-take- all' and the Michigan Republican delegate results are allocated proportionately among the candidates by voting district. Romney won the Michigan primary narrowly, and won the Arizona primary by a wide margin. =Washington State= The state of Washington held their caucuses on Saturday, March 3, with Mitt Romney gaining momentum going into 'Super Tuesday'. Later, Washington held their state GOP convention June 2, 2012 giving Romney at least 34 delegates for the Republican National Convention. =Super Tuesday= The largest number of states in the Republican Primary race voted on March 6, 2012, with Romney winning six states (Alaska, Idaho, Massachusetts, Ohio, Vermont, Virginia); Santorum winning three states (North Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee); and Gingrich winning Georgia. =Presumptive presidential nominee= Vote share for Romney, by county. Darker colors mean higher voter percentage. Black indicates no votes were cast for Romney. After Super Tuesday, Santorum won in Kansas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi, while Ron Paul won the Virgin Islands Caucus. However, Romney maintained a solid lead with wins in Guam, Hawaii, American Samoa, Puerto Rico, Illinois, Wisconsin, Maryland, the District of Columbia, and the Northern Mariana Islands. As a result, Santorum dropped out on April 10. After Romney won the April 24 Delaware primary, Gingrich dropped out on May 2 in a move that was seen as an end to the nomination contest and resulted in the Republican Party declaring Romney the presumptive nominee. While Ron Paul never officially dropped out, he stopped campaigning on May 14. By April 2012, in the absence of viable alternatives to Romney for the Republican nomination, polls showed Romney gaining on Obama's earlier double-digit lead in a hypothetical head-to- head general election contest. However, polls (both nationally and in battleground states like Florida and Ohio) also showed that for most of those who said they would vote for Romney, the primary motivator was hostility toward Obama rather than affirmative support for Romney. On April 25, 2012, the Republican National Committee (RNC) declared Romney the party's presumptive nominee.Shear, Michael D.

The subsequent accumulation of the state's 155 delegates was enough to secure Romney the party's nomination assuming at least 34 unpledged delegates voted for him, which was very likely. After wins in California and several smaller states on June 5, Romney exceeded 1144 pledged delegates, giving him absolute certainty of the nomination and making the June 26th Utah Primary, the last contest of the cycle, purely symbolic. In July Romney described an Obama recess appointment as \\"Chicago-style politics at its worst,\\" introducing the meme into the rhetoric of the 2012 campaign On August 28, 2012, delegates at the Republican National Convention chose Mitt Romney as their presidential nominee against President Barack Obama. This formal nomination sets up a two-month final race to the elections on November 6. General election campaign The general election campaign began in earnest on Labor Day, September 3, 2012. =Bain Capital= Romney's record at Bain Capital and Bain's investments were a prominent issue, with Romney arguing his tenure at Bain demonstrated management and leadership skills that created thousands of jobs. Political opponents have argued that under Romney, some investments at Bain increased investor profits at the expense of middle-class workers who were laid off. Romney took a leave of absence from Bain Capital in February 1999 to manage the Salt Lake City Olympics. Romney remained named on company documents while reorganization of Bain and according to SEC filings, he continued to be the \\"sole shareholder, sole director, Chief Executive Officer and President\\" of Bain for 3 additional years. This discrepancy was reported by The Boston Globe in July 2012 and used by Obama and his campaign in its ads that Romney was responsible for the activities of Bain Capital during that period, from 1999 to 2002. According to Bain, Romney played no active role despite his name being on the required filings. FactCheck.org examined the issue and reported that Romney did leave Bain in 1999. A report by Glenn Kessler of The Washington Post reported that there is little or no basis for the assertions by an Obama campaign staffer of criminal charges or civil liability with respect to the SEC filings. Romney's campaign cried foul and Romney personally demanded an apology which was refused by the Obama campaign. In June 2012, former President Bill Clinton said that Romney, in having served as governor and having had a \\"sterling business career,\\" met the basic qualifications to perform the essential functions of the presidency.Bailey, Holly (June 1, 2012).Bill Clinton criticizes Obama's Bain attacks, praises Romney's ‚Äòsterling business career'.ABC NewsTrinko, Katrina (June 1, 2012).Clinton: Romney had a Sterling Business Career. National Review. Clinton also warned that Romney's economic proposals were \\"wrong-headed\\" and that a Romney presidency would be \\"calamitous\\" for the country and the world. =International trip= In July 2012, Romney undertook an international trip as the presumptive nominee of the Republican party, visiting the United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland to meet heads of state, and also to raise funds. In London, his comments in an NBC interview in which he referred to \\"disconcerting stories\\" over security concerns regarding readiness of the London 2012 Olympic Games were widely viewed as undiplomatic by the British press and leading politicians. British Prime Minister David Cameron defended the Olympic security preparations: \\"We are holding an Olympic Games in one of the busiest most active bustling cities anywhere in the world. Of course it's easier if you hold an Olympic Games in the middle of nowhere. I visited Naypyidaw recently, in Burma, they've got six-lane highways and no cars on them. This is a busy, bustling city so inevitably you're going to have challenges.\\" While Cameron's aides stated he didn't intend a jibe at Romney or Salt Lake City, the British press seized upon the \\"middle of nowhere\\" remark, construing it as an allusion to Utah where Romney had managed the Olympics in 2002.Crawford, Jan, ‚ÄúGaffe Olympics: Romney rankles Brits, Cameron also offends‚Äù, CBS News (July 26, 2012)Stringer, David, \\"Romney stirs Olympic tiff as European tour begins\\", Associated Press (July 26, 2012): \\"His aides said that was not intended as a jibe at Romney or Salt Lake City.\\" In Jerusalem, Romney discussed the possibility of a military strike against Iran with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres. He also discussed foreign policy regarding Iran with Israeli opposition Leader Shaul Mofaz. Romney said that the U.S. has a \\"solemn duty\\" to prevent Iran from harming Israel. He made no public promise that he would attack Iran's nuclear facilities if elected, but he reiterated that no option should be off the table in seeking to end Iran's nuclear program, although he hoped that diplomatic measures and economic sanctions would be successful. Romney called Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and later said that he would plan to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but would decide the timing of the move in consultation with the government of Israel. The Palestinian Authority and other Palestinian organizations denounced Romney's remarks about the political status of Jerusalem, which they hope will become the capital of a future Palestinian state, as well as Romney's refusal to meet with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas (he met instead with PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad). Some Palestinian leaders were also offended by remarks Romney made during a fundraiser, when he suggested that cultural differences and \\"the hand of providence\\" help explain why Israelis are more economically successful than Palestinians, and why similar economic disparities exist between other neighbors, such as the United States and Mexico, or Chile and Ecuador. A senior aide to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas called the remarks racist,Mitt Romney creates fresh divisions on Israel tour with ‚Äòracist‚Äô economic remarks, National Post, July 30, 2012. Retrieved August 2, 2012 as did American political scientist Angelo Falc√≥n, president of the National Institute of Latino Policy. The Embassy of Mexico in the United States also rejected Romney's comments, noting that Mexico currently has a higher economic growth rate and lower inflation than the United States. Romney later denied that his comments had been directed against \\"Palestinian culture or the decisions made in their economy.\\"Romney's Racist Reference To Palestinian Culture, FactCheck.org, July 31, 2012. Retrieved August 1, 2012CBS News Political Hotsheet. Retrieved June 1, 2012 In Warsaw, Romney called Poland a model of small government and free enterprise whose example other states should emulate. He praised Poland for rejecting \\"the false promise of a government-dominated economy\\" and for seeking to \\"stimulate innovation, attract investment, expand trade, and live within its means.\\" Romney also thanked the Polish people for supporting the U.S. in many conflicts. Romney briefly mentioned Russia, listing the country alongside Syria, Venezuela and Belarus, as examples of countries where \\"the desire to be free is met with brutal oppression\\". When American journalists tried to question Romney during a visit to Warsaw's Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, his campaign spokesman told journalists: \\"Kiss my ass. This is a holy site for the Polish people,\\" and told a reporter to \\"shove it\\". The spokesman later apologized for the outburst. In Gda≈Ñsk, Solidarno≈õƒá co-founder and former Polish President Lech Walesa endorsed Romney for president, but Solidarno≈õƒá's current leadership distanced itself from the event and criticized Romney as hostile to unions and labor rights. According to analysis of 21 major news stories by the Media Research Center, a conservative content analysis organization, coverage of the trip by ABC, CBS, and NBC was primarily negative. =NAACP speech= Romney accepted an invitation to address the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on July 11, 2012. On the issue of creating jobs, Romney said, \\"If our goal is jobs, we have to stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we take in every year. So to do that, I'm going to eliminate every non-essential, expensive program I can find. That includes Obamacare, and I'm going to work to reform and save --\\" Romney was cut off by prolonged boos from those in attendance. Romney later attended a fundraiser in Hamilton, Montana and reflected on the booing he received at the NAACP event, \\"Remind them of this: if they want more stuff from government, tell them to go vote for the other guy ‚Äì more free stuff. But don't forget, nothing is really free.\\" =Vice presidential selection= Mitt Romney with Paul Ryan after introducing him as his running mate for the 2012 presidential election, in Norfolk, Virginia, on August 11, 2012. According to the book Double Down, Romney's campaign narrowed down his list of potential nominees for Vice President to former Governor of Minnesota Tim Pawlenty, United States Senator from Ohio Rob Portman, eventual 2016 presidential candidates Senator Marco Rubio from Florida and Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, and longtime U.S. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Having returned from his overseas tour of the United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, Romney planned a bus tour of Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida with his then-yet to be announced running mate. On August 10, 2012, it was announced that Romney would introduce his running mate on August 11, 2012 in Norfolk, Virginia, after touring the USS Wisconsin, leading several news sources to speculate that his choice would be Ryan. Shortly after 7 a.m. on August 11, the Romney campaign officially announced Ryan as its choice for vice president through its mobile app titled \\"Mitt's VP\\". This decision made Ryan the major parties' first-ever vice-presidential candidate from Wisconsin.Ryan joins host of Wisconsin politicians in U.S. limelight (August 11, 2012), Wisconsin State- Journal. =\\"You didn't build that\\"= On July 13, 2012, Obama gave a speech in Roanoke, Virginia, that contained the phrase \\"you didn't build that\\":Remarks by the President at a Campaign Event in Roanoke, Virginia  The White House. Whitehouse.gov (2012-07-13). Retrieved August 1, 2012. Republicans claimed that the statement was indicative of Obama's support for big government. The Obama campaign said the statement was taken out of context, while Romney replied that 'the context is worse than the quote'. The Republican National Committee released a web ad with the full text of what Obama said titled, \\"The More Context You Get, The Worse It Sounds.\\" The following Monday, July 16, Mitt Romney spoke about the \\"you didn't build that\\" statement in a campaign stump speech in Pennsylvania, saying: The Obama campaign, Factcheck.org, and Politifact disagreed with that characterization, noting that the sentence immediately preceding the \\"you didn't build it\\" line referred to roads and bridges and the speech concluded with Obama applauding the hard work of individuals in the creation of their own businesses. Politifact rated Romney's attack as false. In its analysis, Factcheck.org said: Factcheck.org concluded their analysis by acknowledging that Romney provided a more complete account in a July 17 speech. Regarding government infrastructure and support, Romney stated: The Romney campaign followed with events with small business owners in multiple states (Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Virginia, Ohio, Iowa, Missouri, North Carolina, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Nevada), along with an attack ad. A new part of the Romney campaign website was created and merchandise related to the statement was produced. =Convention and post-convention bounce = The 2012 Republican National Convention was held from August 27‚Äì30. It featured appearances by Ann Romney, Chris Christie, Paul Ryan, Clint Eastwood, and Mitt Romney. While Romney's overall polling gains from the GOP convention were modest, the convention did improve his \\"likability\\" rating, even though he continued to trail Obama in this widely considered \\"critical\\" category.\\"Romney's bounce from convention looks short-lived: Reuters/Ipsos poll\\". Reuters, September 2, 2012. This was followed by a larger bounce in Obama's favor after the Democratic convention. =Cairo and Benghazi attacks= On September 11, 2012, the U.S. embassy in Cairo, anticipating possible unrest over an anti-Muslim film that had allegedly been produced in the United States, released statements denouncing \\"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims\\" and calling respect for religious beliefs of others \\"a cornerstone of American democracy.\\" Hours later, U.S. diplomatic missions in Cairo, Egypt and Benghazi, Libya were attacked. After the attack the U.S. embassy in Cairo tweeted, \\"This morning's condemnation (issued before our protests began) still stands. As does our condemnation of unjustified breach of the Embassy.\\" In her initial remarks to the press, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stated, \\"I condemn in the strongest terms the attack on our mission in Benghazi today.\\" Romney, apparently unaware of the chronology of the events that had unfolded, released a statement saying, \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\\" By the following day, it had been confirmed that the U.S. ambassador to Libya had been one of several Americans killed in the Benghazi attack. In a televised press conference and an interview, Romney again asserted that the administration had been wrong to, in his view, sympathize with the attackers and apologize for American values rather than to condemn the attackers' actions. Romney's remarks were widely criticized by media sources regarding the course of events and by political commentators for leaving Romney open to the appearance of seeking to gain personal political advantage from a national tragedy. Republicans initially distanced themselves from Romney's comments, but as he came under increasing criticism for the timing and nature of his comments, several conservative politicians defended his remarks. =Vote mobilization problems= Romney replaced the traditional GOTV system with the centralized Project Orca. The project failed to mobilize 40,000 volunteers in key states during the election day. Media issues =First TV advertisement and questions about context= In his previous campaign, Romney had begun television advertising in March 2007. In the 2012 cycle, however, his first advertisement did not air until November 2011. The 60-second spot, which was broadcast in New Hampshire, was widely criticized for using a quotation from Obama out of context. It included a clip of Obama apparently saying, \\"If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.\\" It did not disclose that Obama, speaking in the 2008 campaign, had been quoting an email from an aide to his opponent, John McCain, which concerned McCain's campaign strategy, not Obama's. The Romney campaign defended the ad. According to The Boston Globe, \\"Romney aides even said they were proud of the reaction and suggested that the ad was deliberately misleading to garner attention.\\" Romney campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom stated: \\"It was all very deliberate. We want to engage him on the subject he wants to avoid, which is his failure to create jobs and get this economy moving again.\\" In an article on the Romney campaign website, communications director Gail Gitcho wrote \\"Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent's campaign for saying 'if we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.' Now, President Obama's campaign is desperate not to talk about the economy.\\" Fact checking organization Politifact gave the Romney campaign a \\"pants on fire\\" rating for \\"distorting Obama's words, which have been taken out of context in a ridiculously misleading way,\\" while another fact-checking organization, FactCheck.org, declined to assess whether that particular clip in the Romney ad was misleading, and instead said: \\"We won't quibble with the spot's main message, which is that Obama has failed to fix the economy. That's true enough.\\" According to The New York Times, when the Obama camp put material on television that made \\"no effort to put any of Mr. Romney's statements into context\\", the Romney campaign responded by saying that Obama was trying to distract Americans from real issues such as high unemployment.Shear, Michael D., ‚ÄúReminders of Romney‚Äôs Comments, From the Obama Camp‚Äù, The New York Times (April 11, 2012). =Work requirement for welfare= In July and August 2012, Romney ran a recurring ad claiming that President Obama wanted to remove the work requirement for welfare recipients. Multiple news outlets and fact checking agencies rated the Romney ad false, Politifact assigning it the rating of \\"pants on fire.\\" FactCheck.org stated: \\"A Mitt Romney TV ad claims the Obama administration has adopted 'a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements.' The plan does neither of those things.\\" Eugene Kiely, Rina Moss. \\"Does Obama‚Äôs Plan ‚ÄòGut Welfare Reform‚Äô?\\", FactCheck.org (August 9, 2012). Factcheck.org elaborated that the waivers will not \\"inherently\\" gut the work requirements, because a lot will depend upon what kind of waivers states propose; moreover, \\"the way the administration implemented the new policy has not helped\\", because of questions about whether Congress ever granted to the president any legal authority to issue the waivers. =Dog incident= In 2007, the Boston Globe reported that, in 1983, Romney transported his pet dog Seamus on the roof of their automobile. Newt Gingrich aired an anti-Romney attack ad that featured the story, while Rick Santorum stated it was relevant as an issue of character. =Etch A Sketch= Eric Fehrnstrom, a top aide to Romney, was asked by comedian and political commentator John Fugelsang on CNN how their campaigning would change if and when Romney wins the Republican nomination. He answered it would be like an Etch A Sketch to shake-up and start over. Immediately, Santorum and Gingrich took the opportunity to say Romney flip- flops and was not a true conservative. Each held up an Etch A Sketch toy as a visual aid to their audiences. Ron Paul created a short ad saying \\"this is petty when we have $15 trillion in debt, 12 million unemployed, and USA at war.\\" Following the incident the Ohio Art Company saw a 30% increase in sales of Etch A Sketches. Mitt Romney explained the words of his advisor by saying, \\"A general election campaign takes on a different profile. The issues I'm running on will be exactly the same. I was a conservative Republican governor, and I'll be running as a conservative Republican nominee.\\" A poll by Pew Research Center taken in the days after the event found that a majority of voters were unaware that the comment had even been said, with a plurality of those that had heard of it saying that it had no effect on their opinion of Romney. =Little Face Mitt and other memes= Many called the 2012 presidential election the first real social media election, and the number of memes it engendered reflects that. Notable contributions included a Bad Lip Reading video, a campaign similar in scope to the campaign for the neologism \\"santorum\\" which aimed to create an alternate definition (or homophone) for \\"romney\\" that referred to \\"defecating in terror\\", and also the binders full of women gaffe. Perhaps most popular was the \\"Little Face Mitt\\" meme, which was created on August 22 by humorist Reuben Glaser. It showed a depiction of Romney with his facial features \\"shrunken\\" within an ordinary-scale blank outline of his face; the result resembled a Dick Tracy comic-strip villain. Within its first four days it had garnered the attention of Gawker, UPROXX, CollegeHumor, BuzzFeed, PostSecret, Mother Jones, Funny or Die and MSNBC's Alex Wagner. An Obama staffer claimed they were later used as desktop backgrounds on computers in his 2012 reelection headquarters in Chicago. At the end of its four-month tenure, Little Face Mitt had also been covered in The Huffington Post, Complex magazine, Mashable, Boing Boing and many local print publications and online news websites. Glaser was also interviewed by the Washington Examiner, The New York Times, The Daily Dot, The Young Turks and in articles from as far away as France and Germany. The International Business Times credited Little Face Mitt and its images as being one of the best political memes ever and described its notoriety as a \\"foray into the internet's lexicon\\" for Mitt Romney, and as \\"immortality\\". =Tax returns= Due to pressure from political rivals during the Republican primary campaign, Romney released an incomplete 2010 tax return in early January 2012, along with an estimate of the 2011 return. During the presidential campaign, he declined to disclose additional returns citing the matter as a distraction from more important issues, despite calls to do so by Democrats and several notable Republicans. Republicans who have urged Romney to release his tax returns include former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, Michael Steele and Bill Kristol. George Will said \\"The cost of not releasing the returns are clear. Therefore, he must have calculated that there are higher costs in releasing them.\\" Republican strategist Matthew Dowd said, \\"There's obviously something there, because if there was nothing there, he would say, 'Have at it.' So there's obviously something there that compromises what he said in the past about something.\\"Opinion: Read my lips, 'No more tax returns', Meghan Holbrook, KSL.com Utah, August 17, 2012.George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney For Not Releasing Tax Returns, George Stephanopoulos, ABC News, July 15, 2012. Retrieved August 17, 2012. In response to claims made to the contrary, Romney said that he never paid less than 13% in taxes over the past 10 years. Romney stated in a Parade magazine interview that he doesn't want to release his tax returns because he would like to keep his tithing to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints private,Romney says his Mormon tithing shouldn‚Äôt be public Thomas Burr, The Salt Lake Tribune, August 23, 2012. Retrieved August 27, 2012. though he has publicly released his tithing percentages for 2010 (7%) and 2011 (12%). For their 2011 tax returns, the Romneys paid nearly $2 million in taxes on an income of $13.7 million for an effective tax rate of 14.1%. They gave almost $4 million to charity, but only claimed $2.25 million in deductions in order to maintain his campaign pledge to pay at least 13% of his income in federal taxes.Raum, Tom. \\"Romney gives Dem support for tax deductions claim.\\" AP, September 22, 2012. The summary prepared by PwC stated the Romney's effective tax rate paid had averaged 20.2% from 1990 to 2009. =Doctored video= MSNBC anchorwoman Andrea Mitchell was caught showing a doctored video clip of Romney at a rally in Pennsylvania. In the edited version, Romney says how amazing ordering a sandwich with a touch screen device at a Wawa convenience store is. Removed from the clip was the context of Romney relating the story of an optometrist he met, who had faced an extensive amount of paperwork from the post office to change his address. Romney was expressing mock amazement at Wawa's efficiency to underscore how the private sector is often more efficient than government, a point that was not evident without the full context of his remarks. =Video of private fundraiser= On September 17, excerpts from a video recorded on hidden camera were published by Mother Jones showing Romney speaking at a private $50,000-a-plate fundraiser held at hedge fund manager Marc Leder's mansion in Boca Raton, Florida. The magazine learned of the video from James Earl Carter IV, a Democratic opposition researcher (and a grandson of former U.S. president Jimmy Carter), who found the video online and got the videographer in touch with a writer at the magazine. On March 13, 2013, on MSNBC's The Ed Show, Scott Prouty, a bartender at the event, revealed himself as the videographer. 47% comment In the video, recorded May 17, Romney responded to a question about his campaign strategy, saying: =Responses= In a press conference convened the night of the video's publication, Romney told reporters that while his \\"off the cuff\\" remarks could have been more eloquently stated, he had been conveying an important message: that his proposals to lower the Federal Income Tax would not be as persuasive to those who are not paying that particular tax. \\"The president believes in what I've described as a government-centered society, where government plays a larger and larger role, provides for more and more of the needs of individuals. And I happen to believe instead in a free enterprise, free individual society where people pursuing their dreams are able to employ one another, build enterprises, build the strongest economy in the world.\\" Several weeks later, Romney commented, \\"I was completely wrong.\\"\\"Romney admits: ‚ÄòI was completely wrong‚Äô on 47% comments\\", MSNBC. October 5, 2012. Retrieved October 23, 2012. Conservative columnist Peggy Noonan called the Romney campaign \\"incompetent\\" and \\"a rolling calamity\\", and argued that the Romney campaign \\"needs a new CEO\\". Columnist David Brooks wrote \\"[Romney is] running a depressingly inept presidential campaign. Mr. Romney, your entitlement reform ideas are essential, but when will the incompetence stop?\\" Conservative writer Bill Kristol initially described Romney's remarks as \\"arrogant and stupid\\" (a comment he later said \\"might have been a tad harsh\\"), but ultimately stood by Romney, saying, \\"It remains important for the country that Romney wins in November (unless he chooses to step down and we get the Ryan-Rubio ticket we deserve!).\\" Several Republicans campaigning for seats in the 2012 election disputed or criticized Romney's remarks, including Senate candidates Linda McMahon (CT), George Allen (VA), Sen. Dean Heller (NV), Sen. Scott Brown (MA), and Gov. Susana Martinez (NM). Some conservative Republicans, such as Erick Erickson and Rush Limbaugh, defended Romney's 47% remark.Condon, Stephanie (September 18, 2012).Conservatives defend Romney's \\"47 percent\\" remark.CBS News. PolitiFact has rated the 47% remark as factually true, assuming Romney was referring to the federal income tax‚Äîthe reasons being that many Americans were so poor as to be exempt from it, and others qualified for enough breaks and other exemptions that their tax liability amounted to zero. During the Vice Presidential Debate, after Joe Biden criticized Romney's comments, Ryan responded, \\"With respect to that quote, I think the vice president very well knows that sometimes the words don't come out of your mouth the right way\\", referring to Biden's reputation for gaffes. President Obama stated in an interview with David Letterman, \\"My expectation is if you want to be president, you've got to work for everybody, not just for some\\".Gavrov, Sergei (October 5, 2012) Mitt Romney has repented of his statements. Finam FM Several commentators noted that 47% was also Romney's share of the popular vote (rounded to the nearest percentage point), a result some considered ironic. Obama had led 50%‚Äì48% on election night, but the results edged toward 51%‚Äì47% as counting continued over the following weeks. Despite downplaying the original remarks during the campaign, Romney stated soon after the election that President Obama won the election by promising \\"gifts\\" to key Democratic voters such as the black and Hispanic communities. Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian peace process The video also showed Romney expressing doubt over whether the Palestinians were fully invested in working toward the success of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. He said the Palestinians are \\"committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel\\". In response, Chief Palestinian Negotiator Saeb Erekat said \\"only those who want to maintain the Israeli occupation will claim the Palestinians are not interested in peace.\\" Iran Another part of the video shows Romney saying: Analysts noted that a dirty bomb requires only radioactive materials, not fissile materials like those from a nuclear weapons program. =Candidate statements and campaign ads on GM and Chrysler auto production in China = Statements by Romney and his campaign have been called false by automakers Chrysler and General Motors (GM). During the final weeks of the campaign, the Romney campaign began to promote the idea that as a result of the Obama Administration's bailout of the automotive industry, U.S.-based auto manufacturing jobs would be outsourced to China. Bloomberg News had reported on October 21 that Fiat, the majority owner of Chrysler (the maker of Jeeps), was considering restarting production lines in China that had been idle since 2009. The article quoted Fiat/Chrysler's chief operating officer for Asia as saying that Jeep production sites would be added to China rather than shifted from current production sites in North America. On October 25, Romney said at a rally in the key battleground state of Ohio, \\"I saw a story today that one of the great manufacturers in this state Jeep ‚Äî now owned by the Italians ‚Äî is thinking of moving all production to China.\\" Within hours, Chrysler responded, saying in part: Two days later, on October 27, Romney began airing a television ad in Ohio that said, \\"Obama took GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy, and sold Chrysler to Italians who are going to build Jeeps in China.\\" Media observers noted that the campaign had taken the highly unusual step of releasing the ad without announcing the release to the press. Chrysler's CEO Sergio Marchionne responded, saying that the claim that production of Jeeps would be transferred from the U.S. to China, leaving U.S. factories idle, was completely false. He also said that not only would Jeep production lines remain in operation in the U.S. but Chrysler would be investing $500 million to expand production at the Toledo, Ohio Jeep plant. In spite of the denials by the auto manufacturer, the Romney campaign subsequently began airing a new radio ad in Ohio that repeated the false claim that Jeep would be cutting Ohio jobs in order to expand into China. The radio ad also said that the other auto manufacturer that had received government assistance during the auto manufacturer crisis, GM, was moving 15,000 American jobs to China. A GM representative denounced the Romney ad, saying, \\"We've clearly entered some parallel universe during these last few days.... No amount of campaign politics at its cynical worst will diminish our record of creating jobs in the U.S. and repatriating profits back to this country.\\" In December, Politifact described Romney's Jeep comments as their \\"Lie of the Year\\" for 2012.Holan, Angie Drobnic, \\"Lie of the Year: the Romney campaign's ad on Jeeps made in China\\", politifact.com, December 12th, 2012. As of 2018, the Ohio automobile factory at the center of the dispute, Toledo Complex, remains open and employs more workers than it did in 2009. Nonetheless, Chrysler has moved some of its production elsewhere; its Jeep Cherokee line was moved into Belvidere, Illinois and Changsha, China. The Changsha factory has begun production on 8 lines of Jeep-branded vehicles, partly as a response to rising demand from China's market. http://www.carscoops.com/2015/07/jeep-cherokee-will-be-built- in-china.htmlhttp://europe.autonews.com/article/20160419/ANE/160419872/fiat- chrysler-begins-jeep-renegade-production-in- chinahttps://www.marketplace.org/2018/11/13/nearly-decade-after-auto-bailout- some-industry-towns-are-thriving-and-others-still/ General election debates Romney had his first general election debate against Obama on October 3 in Denver, Colorado on domestic topics.\\"Presidential Debate Transcript: Denver, Colo.\\" ABC News, October 3, 2012. Snap polls shortly after the debate by CNN and others found that many people believe Romney did significantly better than Obama in the first debate, sometimes referred to the change in pace of the election.turner.com/cnn, 2012/images/10/03. Subsequent public opinion polls showed the debate had eliminated most of the gains in the polls that Obama had made over Romney after the two parties' national conventions. On October 11, Romney's running mate Paul Ryan debated Vice- President Joe Biden, in the only Vice-Presidential debate of the 2012 election cycle. Topics covered included the stimulus, the abortion debate, and foreign policy. The second presidential debate was a Townhall on October 16. The debate was noted for its heated exchanges, and had targeted discussions of Libya, immigration, and pay equity for women. During the second debate, Romney was perceived to have struggled compared to his previous performance. Polls conducted by CBS, CNN, and Reuters/Ipsos found a plurality of voters who believed Obama had done better. During the debates Romney said that he would charge China with currency manipulation. China responded that it would show \\"gradual progress and voluntarily reform China's exchange rate regime\\". The third and final debate between Romney and Obama was held two weeks before election day, on October 23 in Boca Raton, Florida. The topics discussed included a variety of foreign affairs and domestic policy issues. According to The Guardian, Romney \\"appeared unsure at times and occasionally stumbled over his lines as if struggling to remember his briefing notes.\\" Many viewers also noted that Romney was perspiring, which reminded some Twitter users of Richard Nixon's 1960 presidential debate. Instant polls by Public Policy Polling, CNN, and CBS showed that more viewers felt Obama had won the debate than felt that Romney had. Election day activities An attempt to apply security through obscurity to protect Romney's voting day smartphone based project ORCA ran aground when the system crashed under the full load of coordinating a nationwide election day effort. Another disadvantage of the ORCA system was that unlike Obama's Narwhal, ORCA only counted known voters and so predicted a Romney sweep, even as Obama's volunteers were bringing in voters that the Romney campaign had not expected. Post-campaign matters Romney \\"seems preoccupied with the futures of members of his campaign staff\\" and is working on a \\"system to organize the 400 r√©sum√©s of those staff members whose paychecks will run out in 21 days.\\" The Romney campaign has arranged for \\"severance pay through the end of November\\" for some members of his campaign staff. =Romney transition website= The Romney transition website briefly appeared online on Wednesday November 7, 2012. Its catchphrases were \\"Smaller, Simpler, Smarter\\" over \\"Believe in America\\". Blogger Taegan Goddard took screenshots of the site while it was live, showing pages linked from the front page headed \\"The President-Elect\\" (with details about \\"The Inauguration\\"), \\"Believe in America\\", \\"Newsroom\\", and \\"Join the Administration\\". The site had been prepared by Blue Host, a web-hosting company based in Utah, whose owner confirmed that the site had been prepared for Romney.Stableford, Dylan, \\"Romney 'transition' website briefly appears online\\", Yahoo! News, November 8, 2012. Retrieved November 9, 2012 =\\"Readiness Project\\"= The Romney campaign, in accordance with the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act, had made extensive pre-election plans for a potential transition, called the \\"Romney Readiness Project\\" should he be elected president. Former governor of Utah Mike Leavitt was selected in June 2012 by Romney to lead the planning for the project, which included a \\"200-day plan\\" outlining the legislative agenda of the first 200 days of a Romney administration. Leavitt, along with Beth Myers and Bob White, had formed a list of ten candidates for each Cabinet position to aid Romney in making appointments to those positions. The operation included task forces for transitioning specific areas of the federal government. Activities undertaken by the Readiness Project included preparing policy briefings for civil servants at federal agencies, which would be delivered by \\"parachute teams\\" following the election; creating a list of candidates to fill the several hundred political appointments made by the President; coordinating with the Obama administration for the transfer of occupancy of presidential residences, including the White House and the Number One Observatory Circle; liaising with the United States Armed Forces for the assumption of National Command Authority and launch control of nuclear weapons; and developing a post-election communications plan, which reportedly included a 1,000-word victory speech Romney would deliver. These included \\"landing\\" teams to be deployed to governmental agencies two weeks post- election and \\"beachhead\\" teams to guide the transition following Romney's would-be inauguration on January 20. The transition planning effort was divided into four segments, two of which were executed: the \\"readiness phase,\\" which lasted from June until the 2012 Republican National Convention and the \\"planning phase,\\" which lasted from the convention until election day. Two additional phases were planned, but were not executed owing to Romney's loss: the \\"transition phase\\" and the \\"hand-off phase,\\" both of which would have occurred post-election and would have culminated in the transition team's plan for the first 200 days following Romney's would-be inauguration as president. On the evening of the election, the Readiness Project's transition website, declaring Romney's victory, was accidentally pushed live, but was quickly taken down again. The site was built by a Utah-based web development company, SolutionStream. In accordance with the Pre-Election Presidential Transition Act of 2010, the project was provided with office space by the General Services Administration (GSA) beginning in September 2012, two months prior to the election. The offices of the Readiness Project were shuttered and completely cleared within three days following Romney's defeat. Total spending by the Readiness Project between its inception and dissolution was $8.9 million, with all of the funds appropriated by the U.S. government. In May 2013, the organization formerly responsible for the Romney transition preparation, \\"R2P\\", released a report detailing the preparations for a potential Romney administration. In the report, specific aspects of the transition were described, including post-election, pre-inauguration \\"corporate-style\\" management seminars for appointees/nominees and a restructuring of the Executive Office of the President to satisfy Romney's preferences, along with a PowerPoint presentation prepared to brief a President-elect Romney in the days immediately following the election. In 2013, Leavitt published a 138-page case study of the Readiness Project, Romney Readiness Project 2012: Retrospectives and Lessons Learned. =2016 presidential election= Romney announced on January 30, 2015 that he would not run for president in 2016 and would be \\"unlikely\\" to change his mind about it, saying that while he thought he could win the nomination, \\"one of our next generation of Republican leaders\\" would be better positioned to win the general election. =2020 presidential election= During the 2016 presidential campaign, Paul Ryan was reported to have considered a possible presidential bid for the 2020 election, if President Donald Trump or Vice President Mike Pence did not seek re-election. This could have made Ryan the first president from Wisconsin as well as the second House Speaker to later serve as president, the first being James K. Polk in 1845. Additionally Ryan would also have been the first person since Bob Dole to be nominated for both president and vice president two different elections (Dole was the vice presidential nominee in 1976 and the presidential nominee in 1996).  Explanations for the loss  In interviews after the election, Romney said of his loss, \\"The president's campaign, if you will, focused on giving targeted groups a big gift. He made a big effort on small things.\\" Robert Draper in the New York Times Magazine summarized interviews with technology savvy young Republicans to conclude that the Romney campaign's inability to understand and use modern technology caused Romney to lose a winnable election. \\"Criticism begins with the candidate‚Äîa self described data-driven chief executive who put his trust in alarmingly off-the-mark internal polls.\\" In contrast, the Obama campaign repeatedly and exhaustively polled and directed the actual expressed day-to-day shifting opinions of the electorate through such technological mediums as Reddit, Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter. \\"Romney's senior strategist, Stuart Stevens, may well be remembered by historians . . . as the last guy to run a presidential campaign who never tweeted\\" to get out the vote and to elicit real-time electorate feelings from all ethnic groups, all gender persuasions, and from rich and poor.

He specialises in infectious and tropical diseases, clinical immunology, and internal medicine, with a special interest in HIV/AIDS, respiratory infections, and diseases of poverty. He is internationally renowned for his extensive outputs and leadership of infectious/tropical diseases research and capacity development activities. He was awarded a Knighthood in the 2017 Queens Birthday Honours list for services to public health and protection from infectious disease. Early life Alimuddin (Ali) Zumla was born in Northern Rhodesia (now Chipata, Eastern Province, Zambia). His parents Haji Ismail and Hajiani Aman Zumla were of Gujarati Indian origin. He resided on Obote Road in the Kamwala district of Lusaka. He did his early education at the Lotus Primary School and Prince Philip Secondary School (now Kamwala Secondary School) in Lusaka, and his medical training at the University of Zambia's School of Medicine. In 1980, Zumla moved to London to pursue an MSc in tropical medicine at the University of London. In 1982, he contracted life-threatening tuberculous meningitis, and was told that he would never walk again, but went on to make a remarkable recovery and return to work a year and a half later to a star-studded career despite disabling and painful neurological sequelae resulting from his meningitis. He went on to pursue doctoral studies on leprosy human monoclonal antibodies at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, where his 1987 dissertation (advised by Keith McAdam) merited him the Alan Woodruff Medal.. See library record here. Career Following his graduation, Zumla spent a year at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine gaining the MSc degree in Clinical Tropical Diseases with a distinction and the Murgratroyd Prize. He subsequently worked at The Royal Northern and Royal Free Hospitals under the mentorship of David Geraint James obtaining his Membership of The Royal College of Physicians of London. After doing a PhD between 1985 and 1987 he worked as infectious diseases registrar and at the Rush Green Regional Hospital for Infectious Diseases in Romford under Ming Yong and Mervyn Medlock. Whilst working at Rush Green Hospital, he identified and notified the first cases of the 1988 Legionnaires' Diseases outbreak which he traced back to Broadcasting House, BBC, central London. Zumla subsequently spent four years in a senior registrar/honorary lecturer position at the Hammersmith Hospital, Royal Postgraduate Medical School in London under Sir Robert Lechler, and then two years at the University of Texas Center for Infectious Diseases working with Herbert DuPont. He then returned to his native Zambia to work on AIDS-related opportunistic infections at the University Teaching Hospital in Lusaka before moving to University College London in 1994. In 2003, there were media reports about a paper of Zumla's in The Lancet discussing a new test developed by a team he led for monitoring CD4 immune cell counts based on dried blood samples. Such counts are used in monitoring AIDS patients taking antiretroviral drug treatments; Zumla's subsequent work has led to development and evaluation of a range of rapid, cheap and more accessible diagnostic tests for TB and respiratory infections for use on patients in developing countries. Zumla was the guest editor of the Lancet TB Series which addressed key issues around TB treatment and diagnosis.

His current research interests include tuberculosis (particularly drug clinical trials, biomarkers, MDR-TB and TB in London), HIV/AIDS, tropical diseases, respiratory infections (and rapid diagnostics thereof), endocarditis, biomarkers, and transrenal DNA. Zumla's work focuses on improving global health, especially for disadvantaged populations, with an emphasis on assisting poorer and disadvantaged peoples of the world. He established and directs a multi-country collaboration with several African, Middle Eastern, European and United States institutions on collaborative research and training program on TB and HIV/AIDS. During the past two decades Zumla and his collaborators have set up research and training programs in Africa, focusing attention on development of local infrastructure and capacity development. Several of his doctoral students now occupy academic positions in institutions in Africa. Zumla has established north‚Äìsouth partnerships for TB research. His collaborations now span five countries in Europe and 10 in sub- Saharan Africa, where he leads several multi-country research projects. His team's research findings have contributed to the development of WHO's management guidelines on treatment and prevention of TB and TB/HIV, and to improvements in the care of patients worldwide. In 2014, together with colleagues from Public Health England, World Health Organization, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and the Middle East, Zumla co-led The Lancet series on Mass Gatherings Medicine which was launched at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva.

The branch line joins the Blayney-Demondrille line at Cowra.  Construction  The Cowra to Canowindra Railway Act was passed on 15 December 1908. Land acquisitions proceeded rapidly, with the first sod of the new lined turned at Cowra West on 11 January 1909. John Bradfield, who went on to design the Sydney Harbour Bridge, prepared layout plans as assistant engineer on the project. The line was built to so-called \\"pioneer\\" standards - earth ballasted with no fences. The branch line to Canowindra was opened with great fanfare on 4 July 1910. The opening of the line proved an economic boon to the town, with Canowindra's population increasing from 400 prior to 1900, to 1500 and rising in 1911. An extension to Eugowra was opened on 11 December 1922. Further extensions to link up with the Main Western Line, one at Gregra and another at Parkes, were approved in 1924, but never built. Freight and passenger services Canowindra Station, the site of the original railhead, has been abandoned since 2001 Due to the relative shortness of the branch, the main use of the line was for grain haulage rather than passengers. In 1927 a rail-motor coach replaced steam locomotives for passenger transport. The \\"Tin Hare\\", as the coach was affectionately known, provided a daily return service on weekdays between Cowra and Eugowra. With improving road transport links, demand for passenger services on the line gradually decreased. In the years leading up to the service's cessation on 10 August 1974, the few passengers that used the service had been carried in the brake carriage of the regular grain service. Freight services continued into the 1990s. A washout near Eugowra in 1991 resulted in the line being truncated at Trajere. The entire line was closed by the end of the year. The Lachlan Valley Railway operated a tourist railway on the line from 1994. Floods in 2001 damaged a bridge at Cucumber Creek, closing the line permanently. As of 2014, there are no plans to reopen the branch.

He is a member of the Revolutionary Socialists and the Center for Socialist Studies. Early life and career El-Hamalawy started working as a journalist in 2002 for the English language Cairo Times, where he covered protests, trials of dissidents and police torture news. He later joined the Los Angeles Times as a correspondent in Cairo. El-Hamalawy also freelanced for a broad array of local and foreign news organizations, including Bloomberg News and the BBC, and worked as a researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW). He also worked as a managing editor for the leftist daily El-Badeel and was the founding managing editor of Al-Masry Al-Youm's English Edition as well as being one of founding editorial team of Ahram Online. El-Hamalawy was a visiting scholar at the Graduate School of Journalism in UC Berkeley, in 2007. He is regarded as \\"influential\\" according to a diplomatic cable sent by US Ambassador Francis J. Ricciardone, Jr. in 2007. Activism = Student activism = Hossam taking photos. El-Hamalawy attended the American University in Cairo (AUC) where he graduated with a BA in economics in 1999. Afterward, he pursued an MA in political science at the same university, writing his dissertation on the 1977 Egyptian \\"Bread Uprising\\". While still an undergraduate student at the AUC, el-Hamalawy joined the Revolutionary Socialists in 1998. He belongs to the second generation of the organization which joined the movement in the second half of the 1990s. This particular group of activists were credited with reviving the political left on university campuses, after two decades where the Islamists held the upper hand. El-Hamalawy was detained and tortured by deposed Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak's State Security Investigations Service (SSI) in 2000, allegedly with the institution's complicity. Because of his student activism, the Egyptian government maintained a security file on el-Hamalawy. As a result, he was refused employment as a professor by Egyptian universities and he was banned from entering the AUC campus for a year after he finished his MA in 2002. A picture of him was also left with the AUC security guards for several years later with instructions not to be let into campus if there were any ongoing protests. He was later an invited as guest speaker at lectures at AUC nonetheless.Loewenstein, p.72. = Anti-government protests = El-Hamalawy was involved in a series of demonstrations in Cairo in 2000 expressing solidarity with the Palestinian al-Aqsa Intifada. According to el-Hamalawy, that particular protest served as the precursor to further anti-Mubarak protests which occurred in later years. He was picked up after one week from the start of the protests by the (SSI).Loewenstein, p.74. In May 2002, he was detained and held at the local Nasr City SS office, during a crackdown on leftist activists prior to planned pro-Palestine protests on the Nakba anniversary. On 20 March 2003, he attended a demonstration in Tahrir Square protesting the US invasion of Iraq and was allegedly beaten by Egyptian security forces dispersing the rally. On 22 March, el-Hamalawy was arrested by four plainclothes security officers while leaving a restaurant in Cairo. He was detained with other youth activists at al-Gamaliyya Police Station and was released shortly afterward.Human Rights Watch, pp.21-22. Hamalawy was a core member of Kefaya, a grassroots Egyptian movement founded in 2004 that organized demonstrations against the Mubarak government in the years preceding the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.LeVine, p.60.  2006 el-Mahalla el-Kubra strike  El-Hamalawy was involved in the el-Mahalla strikes of 2006. Through utilizing his ability to spread the news of the strike through his blog, he was able to give the strikes wider attention which was ultimately one of the key factors that led to their success. In 2008 he made a speech over viewing the events that occurred on the ground in el-Mahalla during the strikes, noting that the women of el-Mahalla were the essential and initial figures who lead the demonstrations and ignited them to the point that they chanted \\"Where are the men? Here we are, the women!\\" Even though el-Hamalawy comes from a middle-class family, the workers were pleased with his passion and help, even calling him the \\"strike's foreign minister.\\" El-Hamalawi also helped the workers organize and mobilize, which made the strike very effective and was another reason why the workers were able to have their demands fulfilled.  2008 Egyptian general strike  El-Hamalawy addressing a protest demonstration in April 2008 Demanding a higher minimum wage, in February 2008 left-wing activists such as Kamal el-Fayoumi who worked in the state-run textile industry in el-Mahalla organized one of the largest anti- Mubarak labor protests since Mubarak became president in 1981, with around 10,000 factory workers protesting in the streets. Meanwhile, the doctors union voted to go on a national strike on March 15 and university professors launched a national strike on March 23. On 6 April 2008, thousands of policemen occupied el-Mahalla and took control of many of the factories in an attempt to obstruct the strike. Thousands of residents including the urban poor, unemployed youth, and other workers joined the street demonstrations, protesting Mubarak, suspected corruption in his government, and price inflation. El-Hamalawy stated that \\"The demonstrators were met with police tear gas, rubber bullets, and live ammunition,\\" and at least two men were killed. The protest continued for two more days with demonstrators hurling stones at security forces and armored vehicles. Bloggers and citizen journalists (including el-Hamalawi, Wael Abbas, Alaa Abd El-Fattah and others) used Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, blogs and other social media tools to report on the strike, alert their networks about police activity, organize legal protection and draw attention to their efforts. = Blogging = Hossam El- Hamalawy AKA 3arabawy. Since May 2006, el-Hamalawy maintained a blog on the website The Arabist. The Arabic and English-language blog covered various topics mostly related to Egypt, but also the Arab world, focused particularly on workers strikes, police abuse, corruption and global revolutionary movements.Schneider, p.33. In 2006, he left The Arabist to set up his own website named \\"3arabawy\\" (\\"the Bedouin\\") which has since been one of Egypt's most popular blogs. El-Hamalawy has noted that the Egyptian blogosphere has undergone a rapid expansion and ideological diversification since the 2005 Egyptian parliamentary election. He views social media as a means of publicly communicating to the outside world abuses carried out by the Egyptian authorities as well as street protests against the government. Despite the popularity of el-Hamalawy's blog, only a minority of his readers are working class Egyptians due to the lack of internet access in the country and because most of his posts are written in English. Most of his Egyptian followers are young, urban and educated (Half of the internet traffic coming to his blog is from Cairo). Nonetheless, el-Hamalawy's blog posts are in demand by the Western English-language press. Relevant sectors of the Western mainstream media rely on local bloggers‚Äîespecially el-Hamalawy who had spent time as a freelance journalist for various Western news agencies‚Äîfor immediate and first-hand accounts of events in Egypt that were not covered by mainstream Egyptian media. El-Hamalawy believes it is because of his independence from any editorial hierarchy, that he, among other bloggers, was able to regularly document and publish allegations of torture by the Egyptian authorities and the increasing occurrence of sexual harassment and assault in Egypt. The use of photographs and videos made it difficult for the Egyptian government or state-run media to deny the allegations. = 2011 Egyptian revolution = Hossam El-Hamalawy at Tahrir Square. Because of his experience in earlier demonstrations against the Mubarak government, el-Hamalawy was one of the first participants and organizers of the Egyptian Revolution that commenced on 25 January 2011. On that first day of protest, el-Hamalawy stated to Al- Jazeera that the demonstrations were \\"necessary to send a message to the Egyptian regime that Mubarak is no different than Ben Ali and we want him to leave too.\\" Tunisian president Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali had been previously overthrown on January 18 as a result of mass popular protests against his government. He also told Al-Jazeera, \\"People are fed up of Mubarak and of his dictatorship and of his torture chambers and of his failed economic policies. If Mubarak is not overthrown tomorrow then it will be the day after. If it's not the day after it's going to be next week.\\"Three dead in Egypt protests. Al-Jazeera English. 2011-01-25. Accessed on 2012-01-16. Mubarak resigned from his post on 11 February, transferring his authority to the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces (SCAF). El-Hamalawy stated that the revolution was the result of \\"a process brewing for several years.\\" He claims that the overthrow of Mubarak had been stirring as early as 2002, when pro-Palestinian riots around Cairo University fought Central Security Forces chanting: \\"Hosni Mubarak is just like Sharon.\\" El-Hamalawy further noted that \\"activists from small groups have been agitating for these days of anger ... but no one can claim it [the revolution].\\"El-Deeb, Sarah. Egypt's uprising unites society in rage. Associated Press. NBC News. 2011-01-29.  Post-Mubarak  Hossam el- Hamalawy and Alaa Abd El-Fatah. After the fall of Mubarak during the revolution, el-Hamalawy was among many protesters who stormed and seized the offices of the State Security Investigations Service (SSI) in Nasr City and was able to visit the cell where he had been imprisoned, later writing on his Twitter feed that he could not stop crying. He wrote \\"Entered the small compound where I was locked. Man, I can't believe it still... Many are literally crying. We can't find the interrogation rooms. This is a citadel.\\" Since storming the SSI offices, el-Hamalawy has become the main force behind a \\"naming and shaming\\" website \\"(Piggipedia)\\" targeting former SSI personnel who were involved in the alleged torture of dissidents. Their names are linked to allegations and photos. On 30 May 2011, el-Hamalawy and television host Reem Maged were given a summons on 30 May 2011 to appear before military prosecution after Maged brought el-Hamalawy on her show where he criticized the role of military police; Adding: \\"I hold the head of the military police responsible for torturing activists\\". He claimed several cases of torture by the military police towards the demonstrators and about the attacks to uncover virginity, which were widely raised in Egyptian public opinion afterward. El- Hamalawy had also criticized the lack of transparency regarding military finances, stating \\"any institution in the country that takes taxes from us should be open to question.\\"Quote of the Day. TIME. 2011-06-01. Accessed on 2012-01-17. Both were released Tuesday after \\"chatting\\" with Military Prosecution and el-Hamalawy was asked to hand in reports of army abuses to authorities. SCAF escalated its tone against Egypt activists since Mubarak stepped down. They informed the Egyptian people of an attempt to \\"topple the state,\\" as state-run media said a plot had been discovered. Hossam el-Hamalawy said the statement could signal a new wave of arrests against revolutionary groups like the Revolutionary Socialists, which organizes labor movements. The group which Hossam is a member of, came under criticism in state media after footage of a group meeting showed, Sameh Naguib saying popular pressure must be built against the military to remove Mubarak's loyalists. Hossam said that they saw this move by the SCAF coming a while ago and will continue due to other political forces are withdrawing from the streets. he said. \\"That is not going to intimidate us.\\" He added \\"The military is the backbone of the dictatorship. They are the ones who run this country since 1952\\". El-Hamalawy boycotted the 2011-2012 Egyptian parliamentary election held from November 2011 to January 2012. He described them as \\"theater\\" that would serve to solidify the old guard, but with different faces. El-Hamalawy contended that continued protests, civil disobedience and strikes would bring real change.LeVine, Mark.Egypt's 12,001 missing votes. Al-Jazeera English. 2011-12-04. Accessed on 2012-01-17. He also boycotted the 2012 Egyptian Shura Council election (held from 29 January to 22 February 2012) and boycotting the 2012 Egyptian presidential election citing the same reasons. Positions and views = Arab Spring revolutions = Philip Rizk & Hossam el-Hamalawy taking about the Arab Spring. During the Libyan Civil War, el-Hamalawy viewed the role of NATO in providing a no-fly zone and other military assistance for the Libyan rebels against Muammar Gaddafi as unnecessary, stating \\"In all cases, the Libyans would have succeeded, even if it took more time.\\" Commenting on ties between various members of the National Transitional Council (NTC)‚Äîwhich served as the representative of the anti-Gaddafi factions‚Äîand the Gaddafi government, el-Hamalawy maintained that as long as the NTC was supported by the Libyan people, he would consider it to be legitimate. However, he opposed any future relations between the NTC and NATO.Shukrallah, Salma and El-Sharnoubi, Osman. Arab revolutions through Egyptian eyes . Internationalist. 2011-09-29. Accessed on 2011-12-25. El- Hamalawy condemned the support of leftist and Arab nationalist factions in Lebanon for the government of Bashar al-Assad during the 2011 Syrian uprising. He argues that those particular groups often make the mistake of depending on tyrannical governments for supporting armed resistance against Israel. El- Hamalawy claims that, historically, Arab dictatorships have not positively contributed to the Palestinian cause and are in fact hypocritical, since they solely act on their own personal interests. Unlike other Arab leftists, he does not fear a weakening of relations between Syria and the militant opposition against Israel stating \\"the future of the resistance depends on the Syrian people, who are anti-Zionist in their majority.\\" Referring to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's support for the Syrian government, el-Hamalawy believes that Nasrallah damaged his credibility in that decision. Regarding the Bahraini uprising, el-Hamalawy considers it to be a non-sectarian people's movement, but not yet a revolution. He condemned the description by prominent Muslim cleric Sheikh Yusuf al-Qaradawi of the uprising as a Shia Muslim insurrection against Sunni Muslim rule. = SCAF government(s) = El-Hamalawy has criticized the newly appointed Justice Minister Mohamed Abdel Aziz el- Gendy, for his ties to deposed president Mubarak, in relation to the freezing of assets of the ousted dictator. = Socialism = Hossam El-Hamalawy in Cairo El-Hamalawy said that one of the main demands of most of the left leaning forces in Egypt is the re-nationalization of all the privatized manufacturers. He added that a complete freedom must be given to the Egyptian workers to establish their own independent unions. He said: \\"I mean, the workers in some sectors are still facing the old managers, who are trying to sabotage their attempts to establish independent unions and the national minimum wage. We have fought so long to raise our national minimum wage to at least 1,200 Egyptian pounds a month.\\" El-Hamalawy holds the view that Egyptian communism is trapped in a \\"Stalinist\\" legacy, an inverse of Trotsky's theory of Permanent Revolution which states that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks. = Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict = Hossam supports a one-state solution (one secular, democratic, non- denominational state) to resolve the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, rather than the politically mainstream two-state solution. = Political Islam = El- Hamalawy believes that relations between some leftist groups and the Muslim Brotherhood improved significantly from the 1990s, when the groups fought physically on university campuses, to 2005‚Äì2006, when leftists and Muslim Brothers coordinated street demonstrations together. He attributes this to the Revolutionary Socialist Organization and \\"a growing left-leaning human rights community\\" forming the core of a \\"new left in Egypt\\" and to the Second Palestinian Intifada, which \\"revived Egyptian street politics\\" and forced generational change in the \\"new left\\" and the Muslim Brotherhood. Following the revolution in 2011, el-Hamalawy levelled criticism against the Muslim Brotherhood and the Islamists for their collaboration with military, and later when Morsi was elected. He denounced the Rabaa Massacre and stood against the police crackdown on the Brotherhood. Although el-Hamalawy opposes Islamism as an ideology, during times of war, he regarded Lebanese and Islamist groups Hezbollah and Hamas, to be defending their respective countries, playing an anti-imperialist role. But he's critical of sectarian policies of Hezbollah and its role in Syria, and has slammed Hamas for its authoritarian rule in Gaza.

Born into a wealthy merchant family in Russia, she moved to England as a young girl and remained there for most of her life. She devoted her time to social activism and used her wealth to fund numerous women's causes. She began her activism in the Anglican deaconess movement in the 1860s. There she organized members and raised awareness of the goals of the movement. Hubbard then began promoting elementary education as a career for women. Hubbard capitalized on increased awareness of the demand for elementary teachers. She then helped to establish a college to train women as elementary teachers. She was concerned that many women were unable to find work as teachers due to poor educational practices. After establishing the college for teachers, she began promoting other careers for women. Hubbard spent much of her life promoting employment opportunities for women who had to work to support themselves. She particularly focused on unmarried women and impoverished gentlewomen and the disdain in which society held the idea of their employment. She also published several pamphlets and newspapers that argued in favour of educating and providing employment for women. She published A Handbook for Women's Work, later known as The Englishwoman's Yearbook, from 1875 to 1889. She also published The Woman's Gazette, later known as Work and Leisure, from 1875 until 1893. Hubbard initially contributed most of the articles to the publications and later served as editor. Though they became well known, they were mostly unprofitable and Hubbard was forced to subsidise them with her personal wealth. Hubbard also established the Women's Emigration Society to help single women find work overseas after she learned of the job opportunities that were available in the British Colonies. She also helped organise other groups that promoted emigration. Early life Hubbard was born in Saint Petersburg to William Egerton Hubbard and Louisa Ellen Hubbard (n√©e Baldock). Her father was a merchant whose family had established business interests in Arkhangelsk Saint Petersburg in the mid 18th century. Her mother was the daughter of a captain. Louisa was the eldest of seven children in the family. In 1843, the Hubbards left Russia for England. They settled on a estate in Leonardslee, where Hubbard was privately educated. She never had to work to support herself due to her family's wealth. Deaconess movement In 1864, Hubbard became an Anglican deaconess and became active in the deaconess movement after a friend introduced her to the society. The movement, which had been present in the Anglican church since 1850, focused on providing community life for women and training them work with the poor as nurses or teachers. She began serving with the society and organized a number of gatherings. In 1871, she published a pamphlet entitled Anglican Deaconesses; or Is There No Place for Women in the Parochial System? This work contained descriptions of meetings that she had with church leaders, including Harold Browne. She also met with potential donors to tell them about the movement. She also published a letter in John Bull detailing the aims of the movement. However, she later became discouraged by the slow pace of growth that came to characterise the movement. She ceased active involvement with the group in 1874. Education Hubbard first began interested in the idea of training teachers after the editor of John Bull, who had been impressed by her writings about the deaconess movement, asked her to contribute a letter on the subject. She responded by writing several letters advocating the creation of schools to train women as teachers. These were later re-published as a pamphlet. The Elementary Education Act 1870 created a great demand for school teachers. Hubbard sought to train women to fill these roles, and worked to establish Otter College in Chichester in 1873 to train women as elementary school teachers. The idea of opening this school was first suggested to her by Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth. Hubbard promoted to idea in several venues and attempted to win public support for the venue. Otter College had been established in 1849 as a school for male teachers, but the school had ceased operations several years previous. Hubbard felt that many girls were unused to the type of academic discipline that was required to become a teacher. She continued writing about the importance of educating women and published two works in 1878 and 1880 that were meant to convince parents to educate their daughters. She also sought to establish a school for girls age 15 to 18, but was unable to do so due to a lack of funding. At this time, working as a schoolteacher was viewed as a position not suited for many women. Women who were middle-class or above were limited to roles as governesses by social convention. This created a dramatic shortage of qualified elementary teachers. She was initially worried about the difficulties that middle-class women would face working in schools with members of lower social classes, but ultimately decided that such sacrifices would be justified because education was a noble cause. Otter College assured middle-class parents that their daughters would be educated around women of similar backgrounds. Employment After helping establish Otter College, Hubbard began broadening her focus from helping women become teachers to helping them find work in general. She became convinced that there were many women who would not be able to find work as teachers, due to the limited number of teaching positions and the limited skills of many unemployed women. Hubbard fought against the stigma that accompanied women's employment in part through religious justifications. She argued that women were designed by God to be self-sacrificing and devoted to the welfare of others. Employment was described as a way for single women to fulfill this calling. Martha Vicinus has argued that Hubbard's tone at times casts work as a sort of penance. Though Hubbard promoted women's employment and never married, she often fought against the perception that employment would make women less likely to marry. She fought against the idea that women who did not married should be seen as failures by society. She sought to convince single women to counter this idea with self-reliance and self-respect. In the first issue of The Women's Gazette Hubbard published a letter from Elizabeth Missing Sewell that advocated the creation of a club for impoverished gentlewomen. This resulted in the creation of an organization known as the Working Working Ladies' Guild in 1876. Hubbard frequently corresponded with the leadership of the guild often attended their committee meetings. Correspondence published in The Women's Gazette also led to the founding of the Teachers' Guild in 1884. She also supported the Gentlewomen's Employment Club in London, donating a significant sum of money in 1889. In The Women's Gazette and Work and Leisure Hubbard also promoted the idea of Friendly societies for women. In 1889 Hubbard served as the provisional president of a new group known as the Court of the United Sisters' Friendly Society. Several other organizations were formed by readers of Hubbard's publications. She often sought to unify and coordinate philanthropic activities by different women's groups. Many of the idea that she advanced were dramatically opposed to the prevailing views in society at the time she began her activism, but became commonplace by the end of her life. She also promoted midwifery as a career and argued that better training was needed for women in the field. She also helped establish the Trained Midwives Registration Society with Zepherina Veitch, initially serving as the organising secretary. Hubbard sought to provide suitable housing opportunities for urban single women, who were often unable to afford to rent housing in London. During meetings held at the offices of The Woman's Gazette, the idea of promoting inexpensive housing for women was frequently discussed. Though there were boarding houses available, they were often deemed unsuitable for gentlewomen. Hubbard then published several articles discussing this issue in her paper. These publications led to the establishment of the \\"Ladies Dwelling Co.\\" in 1887, which built a house that eventually held 150 women. British General William Feilding served as the Chairman of the company until 1895. Hubbard left the organisation in 1889 due to disagreements with the company committee about how to deal with the company's financial problems. Hubbard also helped organise a group that sought to protect female travelers from scams in 1885. Hubbard also gathered statistics about the number of women engaged in philanthropic work. In 1893, she performed a survey of the women's philanthropic movement along with Angela Burdett-Coutts. Their survey found that there were at least 500,000 women engaged in philanthropy \\"semi- professionally\\" and 20,000 paid by women's charities. These figures did not include nurses or missionaries. Hubbard later stated that exact numbers were difficult to determine and that their figures were basic estimations. Women's Emigration Society After a writer told Hubbard in 1877 that far more men than women had emigrated from England and that there were many opportunities for women in the British colonies, she became interested in promoting emigration. She then began advocating emigration as an option for indigent women and published information about emigration to Australia in The Women's Gazette. Hubbard proceeded to publish several articles about emigration in The Woman's Gazette and Work and Leisure, which drew the attention of several other emigration activists. The largest established emigration society for women in London at that time often tried to discourage applicants from emigration. In 1880, Hubbard established the Women's Emigration Society in order to promote and facilitate emigration. The group initially focused on emigration to Canada, but later expanded to New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States. Most women sought to become governesses or helpers for families. Emigration was also promoted as a way for single women to find husbands. The society often worked with branches of the YWCA and local bishops in the locations that they sought to place women. The leadership of the society later encountered organisational difficulties and folded in 1884. Hubbard later sought to unify societies that were working interdependently to promote emigration. She published a book titled The United Englishwomen's Emigration Register and founded the United Englishwomen's Emigration Association to try to unify the women's emigration movement. The United Englishwomen's Emigration Association soon floundered, as well. Writing In addition to advocating increased training for women, Hubbard also worked to raise awareness of existing employment opportunities. From 1869 to 1878, she published a guide to charitable institutions that were targeted towards women titled A Guide to all Institutions for the Benefit of Women. In 1875, she began writing A Handbook for Women's Work, which was later known as The Englishwoman's Yearbook. She edited the yearbook until 1898. This publication detailed the qualification, required training, and potential salaries for several careers. These guides tracked the dramatic increase in such institutions during its period of publication. She updated the guide by periodically issuing new editions. Though she listed 82 such groups in 1869, by 1898 her guide was over 200 pages. In 1871, she wrote a series of letters for women seeking employment titled Work for Ladies in Elementary Schools. Hubbard published The Woman's Gazette which she began work on in 1875 and continued editing until 1893. She decided to publish it monthly so she could update it more frequently than her other guides. Using the pseudonym \\"L.M.H.\\", She initially wrote most of the articles in the paper. She often found her work exhausting, periodically suffered from poor health that forced her to turn some of the operations over to friends. In 1884 she left England for an extended vacation in order to rehabilitate after a period of poor health. She also hired a personal assistant to help respond to letters that she received. She employed Emily James as her personal secretary until 1890. In 1890 James began organising conferences about women's employment full-time in an organisation known as the Central Conference Committee. Hubbard served as the chairwoman of the group. She devoted all of the profits from her papers to funding women's causes. The Woman's Gazette cost two pence, making it too expensive for all but middle and upper class women. After the paper failed to turn a profit for several consecutive years, Hubbard renamed it Work and Leisure and began including articles on broader topics. However, the paper never became profitable and Hubbard spent a significant amount of money funding its operations. Hubbard saw herself as an activist rather than a businesswoman, and admitted a lack of business skill. In her papers, Hubbard avoided directly addressing political subjects, although she suggested that women should attempt to promote sensible political positions. Work and Leisure also published financial advice for women, information about inexpensive holiday destinations, warnings about scams, and articles contributed by lawyers about common legal issues women faced. Using Florence Nightingale as an example, she argued in The Woman's Gazette that nursing, both in hospitals and in private homes, was a career path that women should pursue. Other careers that she promoted included typesetting, massage, and gardening. She was one of the earliest writers in England to suggest these as suitable careers for women. These publications have since been credited with helping to change the perception and awareness of women's employment opportunities. Hubbard also published books on other subjects, including The Beautiful House and Enchanted Garden. Later life Hubbard often rode horses and painted landscapes in her spare time. She lived on her family's estate until 1883 when her brother, a cotton executive, built her a new home in Leonardslee. In 1893 she ceased most of her activity because of failing health. Though Work and Leisure folded, The Englishwoman's Yearbook continued under another editor. She suffered a stroke while in Tyrol in 1899. She stayed there for the last seven years before her death in 1906. At the time of her death, she had a net worth of ¬£2675.

His style was exemplary of Sydney architecture during the 1960s and was significant to the modernist movement.  Life  Fombertaux was born in France and was brought up in the French colonies of South East Asia. The adolescent Fombertaux arrived in Australia when he was sixteen years old, after fleeing the war. His father worked in the French Foreign Service and he had to endure a strict upbringing. In later years, Fombertaux studied architecture at the Sydney Technical College with Russell Jack and Bruce Rickard. Like many of the Sydney-based architects, Fombertaux chose to build his own house on the North Shore where he built one of Australia‚Äôs iconic houses, the Fombertaux House. In the year of the house's completion, Fombertaux was offered a position in the office of Le Corbusier, but never returned to France to take the offer. His son, Andr√© Fombertaux, has spent most of his life has living in and working on Fombertaux House.  Architecture  Jean Fombertaux was raised in a pokey and dim Federation era house; his style of architecture was in revolt against such environments and was heavily influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright and Alvar Aalto. Fombertaux's style has been likened to that of Harry Seidler, with whom he collaborated for an entry to the Sydney Opera House competition. = Notable projects = ;Fombertaux house The Fombertaux house was designed by Jean Fombertaux in 1966 and is located on the sandstone ledges of Sydney‚Äôs North Shore. Fombertaux designed the house as his own family home, and lived there with his wife and children from 1966 until his death in 1976. Fombertaux‚Äôs proposal was an open and transparent environment with openings in walls to create a visual connection between rooms inside. He also incorporated large floor to ceiling windows to tie the sunlight and surrounds into the house. The house is constructed of 16 slender steel columns laid out in a grid. The floors are a series of concrete slabs that spiral upwards, defining the differently programmed areas of the house. A light well runs down the centre of the house which contains a staircase connecting all three levels. The house was not completed to its original design at the time of construction, due to financial limitations. Less durable steel was used in construction, and eaves were left off, among other things. Due to local council regulations, no major modifications may be made to the house which has created difficulties for the family when they wanted to complete the project to its original design. The house is still in the possession of the Fombertaux family and Jean's son, Andr√© Fombertaux, currently occupies and works on the house. 1935 births 1976 deaths People from Sydney 20th-century Australian architects 20th-century French architects ","title":"Jean Fombertaux"},{"id":"31473086","text":"Memed My Hawk is a 1984 British-Yugoslav drama film directed by Peter Ustinov (the final film he directed) and starring Ustinov, Herbert Lom, Denis Quilley and Michael Elphick. It is an adaptation of the 1955 Turkish novel Memed, My Hawk by Ya≈üar Kemal, cinematographer Freddie Francis. Music Manos Hadjidakis, producer Fuad Kavur. Background Memed, My Hawk is the first novel written by the Turkish novelist Ya≈üar Kemal. As soon as it was published, it also appeared in an English translation, and Kemal was nominated for the Nobel prize for literature. Twentieth Century Fox, then led by Darryl F. Zanuck, acquired the film rights to the book. Zanuck announced that Fox was going to turn Memed into an epic motion picture. The cast included Peter Ustinov as Abdi Aga. However, the Turkish government of the day asked the US State Department to intervene so that Fox would drop the project. The reason behind this was the Turkish government's belief that Memed My Hawk was Communist propaganda. Fox obliged, and the project was dropped. It was not until 1982 that the project was revived, due to Fuad Kavur, an opera stage director, who was working as an assistant to Ustinov. Kavur asked Ustinov if he would be interested in reprising the part in Memed, that of the ruthless Turkish landlord, \\"Abdi Agha\\", in the aborted Zannuck production. When Ustinov agreed, Kavur bought back the film rights from Twentieth Century Fox. Soon thereafter, he was able to raise the finance for the movie in Turkey, and the preparations for filming started. Kavur visited the then prime minister of Turkey, B√ºlent Ecevit, to make sure that the permission to film in Turkey would not be withheld. Ecevit, a socialist, assured Kavur that there would be no problems, though as a formality, Ustinov's screenplay had to be submitted to the Turkish Film Censorship Committee. However, the Censorship Committee refused to grant permission, and Ecevit reacted to this decision, by promptly dismissing the Committee. This became headline news in Turkey, as it represented a confrontation between Ecevit and the military controlled Censorship Committee. Ecevit, who led a minority government, lost a vote of confidence in the parliament, and he and his cabinet fell. The incoming administration, led by Suletmen Demirel, which was a right-wing party, upheld the decision of the (sacked) Censorship Committee, and the permission to film Memed My Hawk was once more denied. Kavur, the producer of Memed, had to move the production in a hurry to Yugoslavia. There was no government interference there, and the film was made with no further political problems Memed My Hawk had a Royal Gala Premiere in London in May 1984, in aid of UNICEF. The event was attended by Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, and some thirty ambassadors in London; however, except the Turkish ambassador who declined due to a \\"previous engagement\\". Simultaneously, the Turkish government announced that the exhibition of Memed My Hawk in Turkey was banned. Soon afterwards, Fuad Kavur, the producer of the film, renounced his Turkish citizenship, in protest of the oppressive policies of the Ankara government. As of 2012, the exhibition in movie theatres, and/or broadcasting of it on television, or the sale of it as DVD, remained banned.

Many individuals must be recruited to forage for food to provide for the hive. Some bee species have highly developed ways of communicating with each other about the location and quality of food resources ranging from physical to chemical displays. Honey bees are known for their specialized dances, such as the waggle dance which recruit other bees to the precise location of the food source.Winston ML, 1987. The biology of the honey bee. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. Bumblebees are not capable of transmitting this type of detailed information. Instead, the nest serves as a hub where bees receive information about the foraging bouts of her conspecifics. Differences between the communication methods of honeybees and bumblebees are mainly due to differences in colony size and nest structure. Bumblebees are distinct from honeybees because they lack receiver bees (bees in the nest which receive pollen and nectar from incoming foragers during unloading) and are not capable of trophallaxis (the transfer of nectar from one bee to another). They deposit collected nectar directly into the honey pots and don't share information of the quality of the resource with other bees through nectar transfer. Another bee may sample the nectar brought into the nest, and if the colony is in need of food or the nectar is high quality she will likely go out foraging herself.Dornhaus A and Chittka L. 2005. Bumble bees (Bombus terrestris) store both food and information in honeypots. Behavioural Ecology. 16:661-666.

N.p., n.d. Web. 10 Apr. 2011. http://www.dornhaus.de/www.anna/aprojects.html Their next major paper on the food alert system in bumblebees came in 2001 probing the potential evolutionary mechanisms of forager recruitment in a bumblebee nest. In 2004 they, along with A. Brockmann (University of Wuzburg) published another paper regarding the pheromone released by bees upon returning to the nest and the type of information it provides other bees. Monitoring honey pots Bumblebee nest with full visible honey pots A bumblebee nest differs in size and structure from that of a honeybee. Bumblebee nests are smaller and contain far fewer individuals which is mostly due to differences in the method of colony reproduction. Honeybee colonies can contain up to 20000 individuals whereas bumblebee colonies usually only contain a few hundred. This means the number of bees available for foraging is low and resources must be allocated accordingly. Assessing the level of food stores is not seen in honeybees, likely because the large colonies make such assessment inefficient. Bumblebees only store enough honey for a few days.Heinrich B, 1979. Bumblebee economics. Cambridge: Harvard University Press By monitoring the levels of the honey pots a bumblebee colony can either up or down regulate the number of bees out foraging. Lab experiments by Anna Dornhaus and Lars Chittka in 2005 showed evidence of this up or down regulation by monitoring the activity level of the hive after the addition of 'nectar' to the honey pots. Hive activity increased when high quality nectar was injected into the honey pots, provided the wells weren't already full. When the honey pots were full, there was no significant change in activity regardless of whether the nectar imported was from a high or low quality source. They hypothesized that either the foraging bee does not signal the nest or the nest bees ignore the signal because the demand for food is low. The tropical bumblebee Bombus transversalis has also been shown to respond to honey pot levels in a similar way. Excited runs Honeybees have very controlled patterns of movement, such as the waggle or tremble dance which serve to deliver specific coordinates of fruitful sources to potential foragers. Bumblebee movement is comparatively random and does not supply coordinates to other bees. Other experiments by Dornhaus and Chittka (2001) showed increased movement of successful foraging bees upon returning to the nest. Successful bees ran faster and longer compared to unsuccessful bees. A bee may spend several minutes running around the nest before flying out again. As the bee runs, it has been hypothesized that the bee may also offer a form of communication based on the buzzing sounds made from her wings. These 'excited' runs serve in part to rouse other bees into foraging. Pheromones = Pheromone distribution = Bumblebees produce a signalling pheromone from tergal glands located on their dorsal abdomen as discovered in experiments performed by A. Dornhaus, A. Brockmann and L. Chittka in 2003. They monitored the activity of bee colonies after exposure to products from several glands located along the bee's body. The only one yielding significant changes in activity level came from the tergites VI and VII. This is similar to a pheromone produced from the Nasanov gland in honeybees, but differs in the active compound. It has been suggested that this pheromone may facilitate learning of floral scents, since its release is coupled with the import of the floral scent from the nectar collected by the successful forager. Experiments by Molet, Chittka and Raine in 2009 showed that bumblebees may be able to learn floral scents associated with rewarding flowers better if the particular scent is found in nectar deposited in the honeypots. = Brood recognition pheromones = Many bumblebee species have been observed to use pheromones in the process of brood recognition. In the species Bombus vosnesenskii, brood recognition, and subsequently, brood clump incubation, has been shown to be pheromone induced. Queens will deposit chemical signals on a brood clump to help herself and her workers identify the eggs. However, these pheromones appear to be species' specific, as opposed to specific to individual queens, as queens will also incubate the eggs of conspecific bees. = Queen pheromones = As in other social Hymenoptera, bumblebee queens have also been shown to release characteristic pheromones to signal their presence and stop the workers from reproducing. In Bombus terrestris, for example, two studies have shown that workers resorbed oocytes more often and had fewer developing oocytes in their ovaries after treatment with the queen-characteristic cuticular hydrocarbon pentacosane. Similar activity of queen-specific cuticular hydrocarbons has also been documented in Bombus impatiens, as well as in several other species of ants and wasps.

It is part of the Iruya Department in Salta Province, located northeast of the village of Iruya at 3,000 m altitude on the Cordillera Oriental on the Nazareno River. La Mesada consists of the two districts of La Mesada Grande and La Mesada Chica. La Mesada has the status of a civil association called Centro de La Aborigen Mesada Grande (center of the indigenous inhabitants of La Mesada Grande). The village has a small, scarcely equipped hospital, a primary school and a parish and cultivates corn and potatoes for their own use. From Iruya the village of La Mesada can be reached through a valley along the Nazareno River, which has to be crossed several times. With off-road vehicles this is possible in the months from April to November. In the summer months from December to March, the river carries too much water, so that the only possibility to reach the village is over the considerably longer mountain trails. The final part of the way into town can only be made on foot or with mounts.

And the lots would be combined to allow for a set of larger-scale, 17-story apartment buildings. He said his goal was to \\"recreate the entire district as a modern counterpart of the high-class residential section it once was\\" saying it would \\"rival Central Park West and the fashionable east side within a few years.\\" He cited the goal of neighborhood reinvention as the reason for the simultaneous building, saying his hope was that \\"complete transformation of the section may be achieved as quickly as possible.‚Äù\\"Bing & Bing Plan $40,000,000 Apartment Development on Lower West Side,\\" New York Times, April 2, 1929 Also, in more practical terms, he mentioned the \\"imminent\\" IND Eighth Avenue Line, and recent completion of the West Side Elevated Highway and even the Holland Tunnel as increasing accessibility to‚Äîand demand for‚Äîthe area.

Statue of Hermann in Neuss. Hermann IV of Hesse (; \\"the Peaceful\\", , Latin: Pacificus) (1450‚Äì1508) was the Archbishop-Elector of Cologne from 1480 to 1508 and the Prince-Bishop of Paderborn from 1498 to 1508. Biography =Early years, 1450‚Äì1473= Hermann IV of Hesse was born in Bonn in 1450, the son of Louis I, Landgrave of Hesse and his wife Anna, daughter of Frederick I, Elector of Saxony. As a younger son, Hermann was groomed for the church and received a number of benefices at a young age, including the provost of Aachen Cathedral and Fritzlar Cathedral; Dean of St. Gereon's Basilica; and canon of Cologne Cathedral (in 1461) and Mainz Cathedral (in 1463). He is listed on the register of University of Cologne for 1462 and later studied at the Charles University in Prague. In 1472, Hermann made a bid to become Bishop of Hildesheim, but was forced to withdraw from the episcopal election after he failed to secure papal recognition. He became diocesan administrator of the Archdiocese of Cologne in 1473. =Role in the Siege of Neuss, 1474‚Äì1475= As diocesan administrator of the Archdiocese of Cologne, Hermann was involved in the Cologne Ecclesiastical Conflict () at the time that Charles the Bold launched the Siege of Neuss. In November 1475, Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor appointed Hermann Stiftsgubernator. =Archbishop of Cologne, 1480‚Äì1508= Hermann assumed control of the administration of the Archdiocese of Cologne following the arrest of Archbishop Ruprecht of the Palatinate in 1478. After Ruprecht's death on 26 July 1480, Hermann was elected as his successor on 11 August 1480. Pope Innocent VIII confirmed his appointment in November 1480. After many turbulent years, Hermann devoted himself to the administrative and financial recovery of the archdiocese. For the 28 years of peace and stability, Hermann earned himself the moniker of \\"the Peaceful\\". Prince-Bishop of Paderborn, 1498‚Äì1508 In 1495, Hermann became coadjutor bishop of the Prince-Bishopric of Paderborn. He was elected Prince- Bishop of Paderborn on 7 March 1498. He set himself against Philip of Cleves, Dean of Strasbourg Cathedral and his brother John II, Duke of Cleves but could not ultimately prevail. Hermann was allied with Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor and Pope Alexander VI. The Reichskammergericht upheld Hermann's jurisdiction over the eastern part of Paderborn. He held a Lehenstag in Paderborn on 1 October 1500 to allow the nobles of Paderborn to pay homage to him. The Reichskammergericht also restored Helmarshausen and Delbr√ºck to the bishop. Hermann took his role as a spiritual pastor seriously and intensified episcopal oversight of the monasteries. He read mass and prayed the breviary regularly, and performed other episcopal liturgical acts. He arranged for the financing to build the church in Bevern in 1501, and consecrated the church in 1506. =Death= Hermann died on 19 October 1508. He was buried in Cologne Cathedral and his heart was buried in the castle church in Br√ºhl, North Rhine- Westphalia.

The dam is a \\"run-of-the-river\\" dam because it can generate electricity without needing to store additional water supplies behind the dam. Black Eagle Falls Black Eagle Falls is the first in a series of five waterfalls which constitute the Great Falls of the Missouri River in the state of Montana in the United States. Before being dammed, water dropped over the falls.Cutright and Johnsgard, p. 26. Black Eagle Falls formed on a fall line unconformity in the Great Falls Tectonic Zone. Botkin, p. 255. The Missouri River in this area flows over and through the Kootenai Formation, a mostly nonmarine sandstone laid down by rivers, glaciers, and lakes in the past. Some of the Kootenai Formation is marine, however, laid down by shallow seas.See, generally, Farshori and Hopkins, 1989; Haney and Schwartz, 2003. The river is eating away at the softer nonmarine sandstone, with the harder rock forming the falls themselves. The Mandan and the South Piegan Blackfeet, among other Native Americans, knew of the falls.Robbins, 2008, p. 165; Howard, p. 16-17; Federal Writer's Project, p. 353. On June 13, 1805, Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition became the first white person to see the Great Falls (the largest of the five waterfalls). On the second day that the expedition camped near the series of falls, Meriwether Lewis discovered Black Eagle Falls. I arrived at another cataract of 26 feet...below this fall at a little distance a beautiful little Island well timbered is situated about the middle of the river. in this Island on a Cottonwood tree an Eagle has placed her nest; a more inaccessible spot I believe she could not have found; for neither man nor beast dare pass those gulphs which separate her little domain from the shores. the water is also broken in such manner as it descends over this pitch that the mist or sprey rises to a considerable height. this fall is certainly much the greatest I ever beheld except those two which I have mentioned below. it is incomparably a greater cataract and a more noble interesting object than the celebrated falls of Potomac or Soolkiln &c.;Lewis and Clark, p. 134-135 (grammar and punctuation in original). It is unclear which member of the expedition named the falls, but the expedition called them \\"Upper Pitch.\\"Cutright, p. 156.Howard, p. 66. The falls were eventually named for the black eagle which Lewis saw on June 14, 1805.Vaughn, p. 83. In 1872, Thomas P. Roberts, a survey engineer for the Northern Pacific Railway, formally named the cataract \\"Black Eagle Falls\\" after the incident recorded in Lewis' journal.Peterson, p. 20. =1890 dam= Looking northeast across Black Eagle Dam circa 1907. The south powerhouse is at the bottom of the image, and dam is at the left. The Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Company was formed in 1887,The Montana Almanac, p. 381. with the goal of developing the town of Great Falls; providing it with power, sewage, and water; and attracting commerce and industry to the city. Railroad magnate James J. Hill organized the investors, who were primary owners of large amounts of stock in the Great Northern Railway. It was capitalized at $5 million. Hill sold stock to many of his friends, including Philip Danforth Armour, Charles Arthur Broadwater, Marshall Field, John Murray Forbes, Daniel Willis James, John Stewart Kennedy, Leonard Lewisohn and Charles Elliott Perkins.Martin, p. xxi. One of the stockholders in the Great Falls Water Power & Townsite Co. (GFWPTC) was Paris Gibson, a friend of Hill's and the driving force behind the founding of the city of Great Falls.Malone, 1996, p. 132; Guthrie, p. 20; Taliaferro, p. 120-121. Gibson realized that the Great Falls of the Missouri could provide abundant, cheap electricity for industry, and proceeded to promote the town on this basis.Taliaferro, p. 121. But Gibson's plan meant actually building one or more dams to supply the dreamt-of power. The company immediately began purchasing riverside land and water rights along the Missouri River from Black Eagle Falls down to Sheep Creek (a distance of about ). In time, it owned almost all the land set aside for the city of Great Falls as well as an additional of waterside property. GFWPTC employed J.T. Fanning, a hydraulic engineer, to survey Black Eagle Falls in the summer of 1887 to determine the suitability of the falls and the best location for a dam. Plans for a dam were drawn up, but no action was taken at that time. Black Eagle Dam was built in order to supply power to a copper smelter. The Boston and Montana Consolidated Copper and Silver Mining Company was organized on July 22, 1887, by the merger of Leonard Lewisohn's Lewisohn Brothers (a copper trading company), the Montana Company (a mine holding company), and C. X. Larrabee (owner of the highly productive and famous Larrabee and Mountain View mines).\\"A Montana Mining Deal.\\" New York Times. July 23, 1887; \\"Death of Leonard Lewisohn.\\" New York Times. March 6, 1902. On September 12, 1889, the Boston and Montana signed an agreement with GFWPTC in which the power company agreed to build a dam that would supply the mining firm with at least 1,000 horsepower (or 0.75 MW) of power by September 1, 1890, and 5,000 horsepower (or 3.73 MW) of power by January 1, 1891.Hyde, p. 86. In exchange, Boston and Montana agreed to build a $300,000 copper smelter near the dam. Construction began on Black Eagle Dam in 1890.Peterson, p. 60. GFWPTC engineers designed a rock-and-timber crib weir overflow dam, in which dressed and shaped heavy timbers formed a closed structure filled with rock or rubble. The dam was not a large one. The goal was to merely create a pond behind the dam, which would create enough water pressure (or \\"head\\") to turn turbines and generate electricity. The dam was built at a cost of about $515,000Another report claims the cost was only $275,000, but that may be for just the cost of labor and not materials and the associated powerhouses. See: \\"Great Falls, Mont.,\\" p. 240. (roughly $12,335,000 in inflation-adjusted 2010 dollars) on the upstream brink of the falls (to create the deepest reservoir possible). Construction bids were opened on February 5, 1890, with the request for bids specifying that all work must be finished by December 1, 1890. All the bids were rejected, and mechanical engineer Maurice Parker was employed to design and construct the dam. Coffer dams were constructed in April 1890 to divert the river from the work areas. Work on the dam itself began on April 15. A shanty town named \\"River Bank\\" was constructed just upstream of the construction site on the north bank for the river to house the Croat, Scandinavian, Slovak, and Welsh workers who helped construct the dam. (Most of these workers helped found the town of Black Eagle, and earthen foundations for the shanty town can still be seen.) The red sandstone riverbed was leveled as much as possible, and large timbers bolted and cemented (perpendicular to the river's flow) to the rock. Each timber was from the next one downstream, and six cribs were built to form a dam deep at its base.The dam's downstream face had a pitch of 1.05:1. From the crest of the dam, a face (at a pitch of 1:08:1) extended for about before it became vertical. A masonry wall was built on the south end of the dam to form the foundation of and to protect the powerhouse, and the construction worked inward from either end of the dam. Every across the face of the dam, a floodwater spillway made of concrete was created (for a total of eight spillways). Flashboards in height were installed along the entire top of the dam to add water storage capacity. The dam was high and long. The dam began generating electricity in December 1890.Peterson, p. 86. Water was permitted to flow over the crest of the dam on January 6, 1891, and the dam was considered complete on March 15, 1891. A two-story brick powerhouse, , was built on the south side of the river. It contained three twin, horizontal \\"Victor\\" reaction turbines (to which up to six generators could be mounted), each of which generated 1.27 MW of power. The south bank and a masonry wall some distance offshore created a forebay (or short headrace) which fed the iron-enclosed penstocks, and water flow into the penstocks was partially controlled by a gate at the upstream end of the forebay. The main penstock was long and in diameter, and fed water to the turbines. (Three other penstocks were built but not put into use immediately.) The interior of the north bank powerhouse at Black Eagle Dam, showing the ropes and pulleys used to transfer mechanical power to the smelter. On the north side of the river was another powerhouse (completed in 1892), which contained seven more Victor turbines, capable of generating a total of 1.94 MW of power. Rock and debris carved from the river bottom was piled near the north bank to create a small island (Tailrace Island), and the powerhouse was built on this manmade shore.Talwani, Sanjay. \\"Race Is On at Tailrace Island.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 7, 1999. The island and the north bank of the Missouri River formed the tailrace (or channel for water leaving the powerhouse) of Black Eagle Dam. Tailrace Island was jointly owned by the power company and the Boston and Montana. A wooden pedestrian bridge was built to the island to connect the powerhouse with the smelter above. The north bank and a masonry wall offshore formed a long, concrete-lined forebay ( across at its widest part) for the northern powerhouse. The flow of water into this forebay was also controlled by gates. Three iron-enclosed penstocks were built to feed the northern powerhouse. The mechanical power generated by the turbines in the north powerhouse was not converted into electricity, however. Most of the power was transferred mechanically to the smelter's equipment via a system of ropes and pulleys. Thomson-Houston generators were used to transform some of the mechanical energy generated by the two powerhouses into electricity. A single person could operate the powerhouse during an eight-hour shift. A secondary powerhouse, which contained an Armington & Sims steam-powered turbine and generator, was built next to the south powerhouse and used to provide electricity to clients whenever the main turbines were shut off. A funicular (or inclined railway) provided access to the south powerhouse from the bluff above. A , pedestrian suspension bridge ran from the bluffs above each powerhouse over the river. The dam's life expectancy was estimated at 50 years. 1890 dam operational history Ground was broken on the smelter in the spring of 1890.

The cost of the original plant was $2 million,Raymer, p. 18. and by 1892 more than 1,000 workers were employed at the smelter. On April 7, 1908, construction began on the \\"Big Stack,\\" a chimney for dispersal of fumes high, with an interior measurement of in diameter at the base and in diameter at the top. Built by the Alphonse Custodis Construction Co. of New York, it was completed on October 23, 1908, and was the tallest chimney in the world when finished.Marcosson, p. 289. In 1893‚Äì1894, GFWPTC constructed a second powerhouse just downstream of its existing south bank powerhouse. This powerhouse mechanically transferred power to the Royal Milling Company flour mill on the bluff above. In 1897, GFWPTC built yet another powerhouse (this time next to its north bank powerhouse) to supply even more power to the smelter above. Black Eagle Dam is dynamited on April 14, 1908, to allow floodwaters from collapsed Hauser Dam to pass.

The Missouri River rose above flood stage (which itself was above the median water level). Five people in the city drowned. The Boston and Montana smelter toppled four fully loaded railroad cars into the Missouri just north of Black Eagle Dam in an attempt to divert the floodwaters from the plant. The worst flood in the city's history at the time, several buildings in town were also washed away. They smashed against Black Eagle Dam, and some went over the dam to break up on the waterfalls below. The pedestrian suspension bridge over the dam also washed out. (A plaque was placed on the 6th Street underpass to mark the extent of the high water. It can be seen there today.) The dam itself suffered some damage as well. This damage was repaired, and the old wooden bridge to Tailrace Island replaced with a single- span steel Warren truss bridge capable of handling automobiles. The island now began to also serve as a parking lot for powerhouse and smelter workers.Wilmot, Paula. \\"On the River's Edge.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 5, 2001. Ownership of the dam changed twice in the second decade of the 20th century. In 1908, John D. Ryan (president of the Daly Bank and Trust Co. in Butte and the Anaconda Copper Company, and a future Assistant Secretary of War)Morris, p. 227; \\"John D. Ryan Dies Unexpectedly.\\" New York Times. February 12, 1933. purchased most of the shares in the GFWPTC.\\"Butte, Montana.\\" Mining and Scientific Press. July 25, 1908. In 1910, GFWPTC organized a subsidiary, the Great Falls Power Co., to take over ownership and operation of Black Eagle Dam and its other hydroelectric properties (then being built). A second ownership change occurred in 1912. Cost overruns on Holter Dam, waning investor enthusiasm for dam-building, and the liability associated with the collapse of Hauser Dam nearly drove Samuel Thomas Hauser, the largest shareholder in the United Missouri River Power Company (owner of Hauser and Holter) into bankruptcy.\\"Holter Hydroelectric Facility,\\" HAER No. MT-94-A/HAER MONT 25-WOCRE-1A, Historic American Engineering Record, National Park Service, November 1994, p. 2.Clary, Lewis & Clark on the Upper Missouri, 1999, p. 137. Hauser sold his interest in United Missouri River Power to John D. Ryan, who on October 25, 1912, merged United Missouri River Power with the Great Falls Power Co., Butte Electric and Power Company, Billings and Eastern Montana Power Company, and Madison River Power Company to form the Montana Power Company.Aarstad, et al., p. 125; Malone, 2006, p. 204; Goodsell and Wallace, p. 649. That same year, most of Black Eagle Dam's power (3.9 MW to 5.7 MW) was delivered to the new smelter. In comparison, only about 0.7 MW was delivered to the nearby city. Another 300 horsepower of mechanical energy was created by a water wheel and delivered physically, through a rope and pulley system, to the Royal Milling Co. In 1913, Montana Power upgraded Black Eagle Dam to generate more electrical (rather than mechanical) power. It abandoned its second powerhouse on the south bank, and installed two Leffel turbines. The old generators in the first powerhouse were replaced with two new ones capable of generating 1.5 MW each.\\"Big Power House Will Be Erected,\\" The Troy Tribune, April 2, 1926. Two surge chambers were built in the powerhouse as well, and a penstock connected to each chamber. The refurbished south powerhouse now provided power to the smelter, as well as to the flour mill (which had been converted to electricity). =1926 dam= In 1909, engineers for Great Falls Power Co. proposed building dams at Rainbow Falls (Rainbow Dam) and the Great Falls (Ryan Dam), and a third dam (Cochrane Dam) between the other two in a canyon of the Missouri River. In 1914, Montana Power considered raising the height of Black Eagle Dam to increase its power generation capacity. In 1916, much of the Boston and Montana smelter plant was replaced by a modern copper and zinc smelter, and a wire and cable manufacturing plant was added.Federal Writer's Project, p. 150. But Black Eagle Dam, even with upgrades to its turbines and other power generation equipment, still only generated about three MW of electricity. More power was required. By the early 1920s, the needs of the city of Great Falls had outstripped Black Eagle Dam's ability to generate electricity, and the smelter was planning a new electrolytic zinc manufacturing plant that would require 10 MW of power. By 1925, the north powerhouses were seriously outdated. The Montana Power Company began planning for a new dam and powerhouse in late 1925. The Charles T. Main Company oversaw the redevelopment of the dam. Harry Cochrane, Montana Power's chief consulting engineer, supervised the dam's redesign (nearby Cochrane Dam is named after him).\\"Talk of the Town.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 30, 2003. On April 1, 1926, the company announced it would spend $1 million to build a new powerhouse at Black Eagle Dam. But as work progressed, the engineers realized that the dam and its four powerhouses were too outdated to meet power generation needs. The company adjusted its plans, and planned for an entirely new dam to be built downstream from the first dam.Aarstad, et al., p. 25. The south forebay would be abandoned, while the north forebay would be retained (and significantly rehabilitated). The 1897 north bank powerhouse was demolished, and a new, concrete powerhouse built on the same location. The design and location of the new powerhouse was influenced by the company's experiences during the June 1908 flood (during which its south bank powerhouses had been flooded and damaged). Work began that summer with the removal of the south bank powerhouses. The existing dam was used as a coffer dam while workers poured concrete for the new dam. The new dam was finished on August 1, 1927, and began generating electricity in September. The new dam's reservoir completely drowned the old dam behind it. The new dam was long and high, with a spillway long. Its height was limited by the city's freshwater and sewage facilities, which were just upstream from the dam and would be inundated if the dam were any higher.Peterson, p. 62. The dam had an ogee-shaped crest to permit improved water flow over the top. The new dam also had eight floodgates, and a pedestrian walkaway with railing was along the dam's crest to give maintenance workers access to the flashboards and dam.Peterson, p. 63. Turbines in the Black Eagle Dam north bank powerhouse in 1996. The dam's new powerhouse was concrete. The company had planned to build a brick powerhouse. But local bricklayers demanded that they be paid the salary offered by the city rather than the lower rate offered by Montana Power. The company refuse to hire the workers, and built the structure of concrete instead. Concrete and masonry retaining walls north and south of the powerhouse were also built to help prevent erosion of the riverbank into the forebay and tailrace. The new forebay was long and wide. The forebay was slightly extended downstream to the new powerhouse, and brick arches of the old powerhouse incorporated into the forebay's walls. The new powerhouse contained three vertical Kaplan turbines (supplied by the S. Morgan Smith Company) capable of generating 18 MW of power, which gave Black Eagle the largest generating capacity of any of Montana Power's five dams in the Great Falls area. The Smith company also made the oil-pressure governors (which regulated each turbine's speed) and draft tubes (which slowed the water down as it left the turbine, allowing the faster-moving water above to keep imparting energy to the turbine's propellers). The scroll-shaped inlets and wicket gates around the turbines were cemented into the powerhouse's basement, and each turbine installed in its own pit. Each turbine connected through the first floor roof to an Allis- Chalmers generator rated at 7,000 kVA. DC generators acted as exciters for the Allis-Chalmers generators. Six 6,600/2,200 volt transformers stepped down the power for usage. Black Eagle Dam suffered four major floods after its 1926 reconstruction, but survived them all. The first major flood occurred on June 4, 1953, when early spring rains and sudden snowmelt caused the Missouri River to rise above flood stage.Searl, p. 182. No damage to the dam was reported. On June 10, 1964, heavy rains in the Rocky Mountains caused the Missouri River to rise above flood stage‚Äî higher than the 1908 flood. Swift Dam on Birch Creek collapsed, killing 19 people.Parry, p. 125-126. Lower Two Medicine Lake Dam also collapsed, killing nine. Although 3,000 people were forced out of their homes in Great Falls due to heavy flooding, the 1964 event did no damage to Black Eagle Dam. (Mel Ruder was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for Breaking News Reporting for his coverage of the flood.)Lawrence, p. 8-9. A third major flood occurred on June 21, 1975. More than of rain fell in the Rocky Mountains in a 24-hour period.National Climatic Center, p. June 1975-22. More than 5,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Great Falls\\"5,000 Persons Flee Montana Floods.\\" Associated Press. June 22, 1975. after the Sun River rose to ( above flood stage). More than $17 million in damage occurred, and were submerged. Floodwaters almost overwhelmed Black Eagle Dam, but no damage to the structure occurred.Peterson, p. 64. A fourth major flood hit on June 17, 1997.Peterson, p. 8. Heavy, swift snowmelt caused the Missouri River to rise above flood stage.\\"Floods a Menace in Idaho, Mont.\\" USA Today. June 16, 1997. But no damage to the dam was reported. Black Eagle Dam is also equipped with an emergency \\"trip face\\" that releases all the flashboards on the dam so that up to per second of water can pass over the dam. The Long Pool Black Eagle Dam created a reservoir about long behind it. The reservoir behind the first dam was about deep immediately behind the dam, and contained of water behind it.The Long Pool's average depth was estimated in 1892 to be . See: Report of the Chief of Engineers..., Part I, 1892, p. 265. The current dam has a storage capacity of to of water. The reservoir formed behind Black Eagle Dam has no official name. However, due to the slow current, stillness of the water, and low incline of the water from the upriver town of Cascade to Black Eagle Falls (a distance of about along the winding Missouri River), this body of water has long been known as the \\"Long Pool.\\" Thomas P. Roberts, who named Black Eagle Falls, gave this body of water its name in 1872. The United States Army Corps of Engineers referred to it by this name beginning at least as early as 1883, and as recently as 1910.Report of the Chief of Engineers... 1883, p. 1340; Annual Reports of the War Department for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1903, p. 406; Annual Reports of the War Department for the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 1906, p. 484; War Department Annual Reports, p. 645. The Montana Legislature has used the name, and the name was in popular use as early as 1891 and as late as 1917. Sweetser and King, p. 513; Beach and McMurry, p. 1254. Modern historians have referred to it as such,Lass, p. 379, 380. and it was in use by power industry publications as late as 1949.Nichols, p. 329. Today, the area from the 1st Avenue North BridgeThe 1st Avenue North Bridge is about upstream from Black Eagle Dam. to the confluence of the Missouri with the Sun River (a distance of about ) is known as Broadwater Bay (after Charles Arthur Broadwater, the noted Montana railroad executive, real estate investor, and banker).Peterson, p. 77. Operation of the dam After the dam's reconstruction in 1926, workers and local people were permitted to walk across the top of the dam as a means of getting to work and school.Wilmot, Paula. \\"The Big Stack.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 18, 2002. For security reasons, the Montana Power Company closed the dam to such foot traffic during World War II and never allowed it to resume afterward. Montana Power was forced to license Black Eagle Dam and most of its other hydroelectric dams under the Federal Power Act in 1950. The controversy arose in December 1937 when the Federal Power Commission (FPC) began a proceeding (FPC Docket #IT-5840) to license all dams built prior to 1935 (the year the Federal Power Act became law).Gatchell, p. 50. The act gave the Federal Power Commission the authority to license all dams on navigable waters in the United States.Plum, p. 398. After almost a decade of extensive research and data collection as well as unfruitful negotiations, a hearing began before an FPC trial examiner on November 18, 1946, to determine whether the rivers where Montana Power had constructed dams prior to 1935 were navigable and therefore should be licensed under the act.Smith, 1951, p. 316. In Opinion No. 170, issued on September 30, 1947, the trial examiner found that the rivers in question were navigable and the dams (including Black Eagle Dam) should be licensed.Federal Power Commission, p. 678.\\"Navigability of Missouri Argued.\\" Associated Press. February 17, 1948. The company appealed to the full FPC, which began holding hearings on February 16, 1948. When the full FPC found against Montana Power, the company appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. On October 4, 1950, Judge David L. Bazelon, writing for a 2-to-1 majority, held in Montana Power Co. v. Federal Power CommissionMontana Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 185 F.2d 491 (App.D.C.Cir.; 1950), cert. den'd. 340 U.S. 947. that \\"the 263 mile stretch of the Missouri River from Fort Benton to Three Forks is a 'navigable water of the United States,' and hence subject to the licensing requirements of the Federal Power Act.\\"Montana Power Co. v. Federal Power Commission, 185 F.2d 491, 495. The court of appeals held that Black Eagle, Morony, Rainbow, and Ryan dams were on navigable waters and occupied public land without any authority.\\"F.P.C. is Upheld on Dam Licenses.\\" New York Times. October 5, 1950. Hauser Dam was on navigable waters and held an invalid license to occupy public land. Holter Dam had a valid license, but that license did not extend to the navigable waters which it used. Hebgen and Madison dams were on non-navigable waters, but occupied public land without a valid license. The court of appeals remanded the issue of Canyon Ferry Dam back to the district court, as that dam had recently been sold to the federal government. Montana Power appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari (refused to hear the case) in March 1951.\\"United States Supreme Court.\\" New York Times. March 13, 1951. Montana Power subsequently sought and won licenses for Black Eagle Dam and the seven others required to do so by the court's ruling. (Black Eagle dam was relicensed by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the successor agency to the FPC, on September 27, 2000 for 40 years. The license, number P-2188, is for PPL's entire Upper Missouri-Madison project.)\\"Complete List of Issued Licenses.\\" Licensing. Hydropower. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. November 23, 2010. Accessed 2011-04-11. The three Allis-Chalmers generators were rewound in 1978, and again in 1982. In 1997, Montana Power repainted and renovated the Tailrace Island bridge. On November 2, 1999, Montana Power announced it was selling all of its dams and other electric power generating plants to PPL, Inc. for $1.6 billion.Johnson, Charles S. \\"MPC to Sell Power Plants.\\" The Missoulian.

March 3, 1999. In November 2001, citizens of Montana‚Äîupset with energy price increases announced by PPL‚Äîsought passage of a ballot initiative that would have required the state to buy all of PPL's hydroelectric dams in Montana, including Black Eagle Dam.Gallagher, Susan. \\"Drive to Buy Montana Hydroelectric Dams Announced.\\" Associated Press. November 20, 2001. Montana voters rejected the initiative in November 2002.Berg, Christian. \\"Montanans Reject Buying PPL Dams.\\" Allentown Morning Call. November 7, 2002. At the time Montana Power sold Black Eagle Dam to PPL, Montana Power was installing controls that would allow the dam to be remotely operated from Rainbow Dam. At that time, PPL Montana said it had no plans to expand electrical generation capacity at Black Eagle Dam. Also in 1999, Montana Power turned most of Tailrace Island over to the city of Great Falls for use as a recreation area.Wilmot, Paula. \\"The Rebirth of Smelter Hill.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 21, 1999. In addition, Montana Power and ARCO (the successor company to the Boston and Montana) laid of topsoil on the island, spent $500,000 to landscape it and enhance the safety perimeter around the powerhouse, and agreed to fund a portion of the island's annual upkeep. In the late 1990s, historian Stephen Ambrose suggested removing Black Eagle Dam to restore the falls to their original condition.\\"The Edge.\\" Great Falls Tribune. December 11, 1999. Refurbishment of power generation and transmission systems at Black Eagle Dam began in 2010. In June of that year, PPL Montana initiated a $55 million effort to replace overhead power lines connecting the dam to the area's electric grid.\\"PPL Planning $55 Million Transmission Upgrade.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 21, 2010. The new power lines (which replaced equipment more than 80 years old) were more widely spaced apart, to permit large birds to pass safely through or perch on the power lines. PPL also said it was replacing the electrical substation next to the dam's powerhouse. Both projects are expected to be complete in 2012. =Sediment, water flows, debris issues, and emergencies= Sediment load carried by the Missouri River and its tributaries is a problem for Black Eagle Dam. The Sun River joins the Missouri River just a few miles upstream from Black Eagle Dam. The Sun River has long been derisively referred to as the \\"Scum River\\" due to the heavy load of sediment, nutrients, and unhealthy aquatic plant growth (such as algae) it contains.\\"Sun River Cleanup Effort Has Done Much in Short Time.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 3, 2000. The Sun River is the color of chocolate milk where it enters the relatively blue waters of the Missouri, and it leaves the Missouri noticeably muddier. Silt has reduced the reservoir's capacity, filled up the forebay, and caused damage to the powerplant. In 1988, the Montana Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) listed the Missouri River from the Sun River to Rainbow Dam (just downstream from Black Eagle Dam) as \\"impaired\\" under Section 303(d) of the 1972 Clean Water Act due to sediment and suspended solids in the river. Black Eagle Dam (which slows the water and allows sediment to fall to the bottom of the reservoir) has been listed as one of the contributing sources of this problem. To combat this problem, in 1994 seven federal agencies, eight state agencies, 10 local Montana governments, four environmental organizations, and several Montana landowners began working together to reduce nutrient and sediment flows into the Sun River and its primary tributaries (Muddy Creek and Careless Creek). About $623,500 of Clean Water Act funds, $2 million in other federal funds, and $2.5 million in state and local funds were used to restore streambank vegetation, improve streamside grazing practices, restore sloping to streambanks, and improve irrigation practices. The program has seen success: By 2010, after just four years of abatement, sediment load dropped by 75 percent in Muddy Creek and 25 percent in Careless Creek.\\"Montana: Section 319 Success Stories.\\" Vol. III. Office of Water. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. October 13, 2010. Accessed 2011-04-09. Black Eagle Falls are not always flowing due to the needs of Black Eagle Dam. Typical median water flows of per second occur in the Missouri River in May of each year.Lee, Sonja. \\"Falls Won't Be So Great.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 25, 2001. In October 2000, water levels behind the dam were drawn down and the falls shut off for about four weeks while PPL Montana made repairs to the forebay, gates, forebay, and penstock screens.\\"PPL to Work On Black Eagle Dam.\\" Great Falls Tribune. October 26, 2000. PPL Montana's license for the dam requires it to send at least per second of water over Black Eagle Dam between 9 A.M. and 8 P.M. on weekends and holidays between Memorial Day and Labor Day, although water may flow (and flow at higher rates) if the dam's power generation requirements and water levels permit it. In May 2001, PPL Montana said it would shut down Black Eagle Falls after July 4 because of water flows only about 40 percent of normal.\\"Not Much Waterfall Action Likely in Great Falls This Summer.\\" Associated Press. May 26, 2001.\\"PPL's Request to Shut Down Dams This Summer Approved by FERC.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 2, 2001. Reservoir levels were lowered again in September 2004 to repair flashboards.Black, JoDee. \\"PPL Lowers River to Improve Dam.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 18, 2004. The lack of water exposed the Missouri's original channel near Giant Springs. The reservoir was drawn down again and the falls turned off in June and July 2008. Flashboards on the dam were removed after a heavy rain to allow runoff to pass over the dam.\\"Replacement of Flashboards Creates Temporary Mud Flats on the Missouri near Black Eagle Dam.\\" Great Falls Tribune. July 2, 2008. Once the runoff passed, the flashboards were replaced. But little water remained in the reservoir and river, and the falls ran dry for several days until the reservoir filled again. Alvis Stalwart, used for amphibious maintenance at Black Eagle Dam. Because Black Eagle Dam is an overflow dam, it is common for debris to jam against the dam or obstruct the penstock intakes. Driftwood and logs are the most common forms of debris, but unusual objects such as boat docks, bowling balls, canoes, hot tubs, and small wooden and steel sheds and buildings also sometimes become lodged against the dam.Schulz, Kathleen. \\"Bob: Bound for New Orleans?\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 27, 2004. Removing hollow items can be dangerous, because the water pressure against them can cause them to implode. In addition to large amounts of driftwood, about 100 animal carcasses (cattle, deer, dogs, and various small animals) become lodged against the dam or the penstock intake screens each year. Floating screens at the entrance to the forebay catch many items, as do the penstock intake screens.Hall, Ryan. \\"Hundreds Tour Black Eagle Dam.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 30, 2009. Workers use a crane to remove items from these screens, and bury the items retrieved at a landfill. Dam operators also use a yellow civilian version of the Alvis Stalwart amphibious vehicle to remove objects, and to maintain the dam.\\"PPL Montana Holding Open House.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 26, 2009. (This vehicle caused a stir in Great Falls in June 2006, when local residents driving on a nearby road mistook the vehicle for a sport utility vehicle which had fallen into the water.)\\"Amphibious Vehicle in River Causes Stir.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 24, 2006. Ice is another form of dangerous debris for the dam. In December 2010, blocks of floating ice overwhelmed the top of the dam, tearing the handrails off the maintenance walkway.Evaro, Donna. \\"Missouri River Ice Jam Being Watched Closely.\\" Great Falls Tribune. December 23, 2010. For many years, Black Eagle Dam's owners were required to hold simulations every five years to plan for various kinds of emergencies (flood, sabotage, mechanical breakdown, etc.) which might affect the dam and public safety.Adcock, Clifton. \\"Are We Prepared?\\" Great Falls Tribune. January 16, 2006. After the September 11 attacks, these exercises were required to happen every year. PPL Montana works with local and state government and law enforcement, other companies, and the news media to plan for various contingencies and improve how it might respond in a disaster or emergency. =Tax dispute and Supreme Court riverbed case= Taxation of the dam has been an issue of contention since 2000. During the 2002 ballot initiative fight, PPL Montana said its dams were worth at least $767 million.\\"Lawyer Calls PPL Protest Short-Sighted.\\" Associated Press. April 27, 2004.\\"Montanans Reject Buying PPL Dams.\\" Allentown Morning Call. November 7, 2002. But in 2003, PPL argued that the dams were worth much less. PPL Montana challenged the amount of property taxes assessed on Black Eagle and its four other dams in the area, protesting 10.87 percent of the $4.48 million 2000 tax assessment, 6.5 percent of the $4.8 million 2001 tax assessment, and 85.65 percent of the $4.96 million tax assessment.\\"Property Taxes Paid By Private Electricity Generating Plants and Dams in Montana.\\" Great Falls Tribune. January 26, 2003. This amounted to 30 percent of its total property tax assessment in the state of Montana‚Äîwith one-third of amount owed payable solely in Cascade County. In February 2005, the Montana State Tax Appeal Board gave the state a partial victory, reducing the state's assessments by 10 percent but otherwise upholding the assessment method.Dennison, Mike. \\"State Wins PPL Tax Appeal.\\" Great Falls Tribune. February 12, 2005; Johnson, Charles S. \\"Revenue Dept. Still Assessing Impact of Ruling.\\" Billings Gazette. February 15, 2005. However, the tax board did not address PPL Montana's primary claim that the state was assessing its plants differently solely because they were unregulated. PPL Montana appealed the ruling to the Montana Supreme Court in 2007.\\"Supreme Court Hears PPL Montana Tax Appeal.\\" Montana Standard. June 13, 2007. On December 4, 2007, the Montana Supreme Court unanimously ruled in State Dept. of Revenue v. PPL Montana that the tax appeal board had properly assessed PPL Montana's dams.Dennison, Mike. \\"PPL Wants to Resolve Tax Protest.\\" Helena Independent Record. December 14, 2007. However, PPL Montana had continued to dispute its tax assessments from 2003 to 2007, and the ruling did not directly address those challenges. But on December 14, 2007, PPL Montana offered to pay its 2003-to-2007 tax assessments at the slightly lower rate established by the tax appeal board. Another tax issue arose in 2007. The parents of several Montana schoolchildren filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against PPL Montana.Hurley, Lawrence. \\"Supreme Court Asks Obama Admin to Weigh In on Riverbed Dispute.\\" New York Times. November 1, 2010. The parents argued that all riverbeds in Montana are owned by the state, are held in trust for the benefit of all the people, and that such riverbeds constitute a portion of state lands which must be taxed or leased to provide support for public schools. The plaintiffs argued that PPL Montana and its predecessor, Montana Power, only leased these riverbeds from the state and did not own them. The parents sued to force PPL to pay rent due. (At no time in the past had the state sought rental income from Montana Power, and no payments by Montana Power or PPL Montana had ever been made.) Although the federal suit was dismissed for lack of a federal issue, PPL Montana filed suit in Montana's First Judicial District Court seeking a declaratory judgment in its favor, arguing that the Federal Power Act preempts the parents' suit and denies states the power to make companies pay for the use of riverbeds. The state district court held against PPL's request for summary judgment on all counts. The two parties then went to trial, which lasted from October 22 to October 30, 2007. On June 13, 2008, the state district court ruled in favor of the state (although it denied the state's request for interest on the rent due). PPL Montana appealed to the Montana State Supreme Court. On March 30, 2010, the Montana State Supreme Court held (5-to-2) that the state district court had not erred in its rulings on various issues of summary judgment, that riverbeds were state public trust lands (but not school trust lands) under the Montana Constitution, and that the district court's calculation of payments due was appropriate.Dennison, Mike. \\"State: PPL, Others Have No Case for U.S. Supco Appeal of Riverbed-Rental Case.\\" Billings Gazette. October 4, 2010. PPL Montana, appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, and in November 2010 the Supreme Court asked the United States Solicitor General for the views of the federal government. Finally, on February 22, 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held in PPL Montana v. Montana (No. 10‚Äì218, dec. February 22, 2012) that the Montana Supreme Court had erred in finding all of the riverbeds beneath all PPL Montana dams navigable. The unanimous U.S. Supreme Court held that the correct test is whether the portion of the riverbed under each specific dam (not the entire river, nor even a large or small portion of a river) was navigable at the time of statehood. If it was, then the riverbed is \\"navigable\\" and may be taxed. The case was remanded back to the state supreme court for further hearings.Dennison, Mike. \\"U.S. Supreme Court Overturns Montana Courts on PPL Riverbed Rent.\\" Billings Gazette. February 23, 2012. Flashboards on the dam were slightly damaged during flooding in the spring and early summer of 2011.

The river above and below Black Eagle Dam is used for fishing. Westslope cutthroat trout were first identified at Black Eagle Falls by Lewis and Clark in 1805, and the fish still are plentiful in the area.Behnke and Tomelleri, p. 139. Rainbow trout are also plentiful upstream from the dam.Evaro, Donna. \\"FWP Seeks Comments on Fishing Regulations for Season Starting in March.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 12, 2010.

The change also instituted a new limit on trout caught and killed below the dam of five fish per day (only one of which could be over ). Limits on the number of walleye caught per day were lifted in 2010 to protect the rainbow and brown trout populations (they had been five daily and 10 in possession).Babcock, Michael. \\"Anglers Disagree Over Proposed New Fishing Regs.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 2, 2010. According to dam officials, there are no screens to prevent fish from going over the dam or through the penstocks and turbines. Fish \\"go right through the turbines, it doesn't seem to bother them,\\" dam operators say. Since 1988, the Long Pool and the Missouri River in and around the city of Great Falls have been listed as an \\"impaired\\" waterway under the 1972 Clean Water Act. This area was first listed as impaired due to sedimentation, siltation, and suspended solids in 1988. High levels of chromium, mercury, and selenium were listed as impairing factors in 1992. High turbidity (haziness of water due to suspended particles) was added as an impairing factor in 2000. Sources of these impairments include Black Eagle Dam, upstream abandoned mines, irrigation runoff, industrial sources, and stormwater runoff. The MDEQ has given the area a quality ranking of B-2 (fourth out of 18), declaring it suitable for human consumption and recreation (after treatment) but only marginal for salmonid fish, other aquatic animals, waterfowl and fur-bearing animals. MDEQ has scheduled the Long Pool and Missouri River watershed in this area for future improvement. In 2011, the former smelter next to Black Eagle Dam was listed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a Superfund hazardous and toxic waste site.Puckett, Karl. \\"EPA Adds Black Eagle Site to Superfund List.\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 9, 2011. The EPA also said it would begin sampling for the riverbed above and below Black Eagle Dam, as well as residential areas in the town of Black Eagle, for heavy metals contamination. Historic records show that plant wastes were routinely dumped into the Missouri River below Black Eagle dam.Environmental Protection Agency. \\"EPA Adds Anaconda Copper Mining Co. Smelter and Refinery in Cascade County to Superfund Site List.\\" Press release. March 8, 2011.Ecke, Richard. \\"Stack's Environmental History.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 27, 2007. MDEQ estimated in 2002 that between and of waste were dumped into the river between 1892 and 1915. EPA samples indicated that the contamination could extend as far downstream as Fort Benton, away. Toxins present in the water and riverbed, according to the EPA, include antimony, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, silver, sodium, and zinc. =Wildlife and hunting= The area around the falls, despite its urban setting, is a habitat for many animal and bird species. Among the birds commonly found in the area are bald eagles, California gulls, Canada geese, cliff swallows, eared grebes, egrets, golden eagles, American goldfinches, gray catbirds, house wrens, ibises, ospreys, red-necked grebes, sandhill cranes, snow geese, tundra swans, turkey vultures, western grebes, western meadowlarks, white pelicans, and numerous species of duck, owl, and warbler.Robbins, 2008, p. 165-166; Crawford, p. 167; Tirrell and Reddy, p. 48. Common animal species in the area include beavers, mule deer, muskrats, river otters, and white-tailed deer.Robbins, 2008, p. 166. Beavers are so common in the area that officials consider them pests, and trees in city parks have had to be protected against them.Kotynski, Tom. \\"Talk of the Town.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 7, 1999. (At one point, beavers were chewing down two trees nightly on Black Eagle Memorial Island.Ecke, Richard. \\"Beavers Leave Their Mark.\\" Great Falls Tribune. November 30, 2010. These included two red oak trees found growing on the hill above the dam‚Äîthe only two red oak trees in northcentral Montana). As of 2006, most of the north shore of the Missouri River below Black Eagle Dam was undeveloped as far down a Sulphur Spring (a distance of about ).Lee, Sonja. \\"Cleanup Project Planned for Today.\\" Great Falls Tribune. September 30, 2006. Known as the Lewis and Clark Greenway, this area is under a permanent conservation easement. Although the area below Black Eagle Dam is open for bird hunting, the reservoir and river upstream from Black Eagle Dam to Sand Coulee Creek is a no-hunting area.Babcock, Michael. \\"For Area Goose Hunters.\\" Great Falls Tribune. January 13, 2005. Wildlife hunting is also available on the north shore of the Missouri River from below Black Eagle Dam to Morony Dam.\\"Check Rules Before Heading Out to Hunt on State Lands.\\" Great Falls Tribune. August 31, 2006. Most of this land is owned by PPL Montana, but there is some private land here which is not open to hunting. The PPL Montana lands are open to hunting due to a conservation easement, but the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks requires hunters to obtain a map of these lands before using them for hunting. There are also restrictions on the type of weapons which may be used in this area, and where hunters may park. =Recreation area improvements= Lewis & Clark National Historic Trail Interpretative Center, located just downstream of Black Eage Dam. Black Eagle Dam is also utilized as a recreation area. The whitewater just below the falls is a good place for canoeing, inner-tube floating, and kayaking.Fischer and Fischer, p. 129; Babcock, Michael. \\"Where to Float Your Boat.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 5, 2003; Harrison, Elizabeth. \\"Outdoor Fun Begins With Indoor Kayak Class.\\" Great Falls Tribune. January 31, 2010. Hiking and bicycling also occur in the area. Beginning in 2006, the Black Eagle Dam Run (a run/walk and run) has been held at Black Eagle Dam in mid-July.\\"Regional Briefs.\\" Great Falls Tribune. July 8, 2006. The annual Lewis and Clark Festival, celebrated in late June (the anniversary of the discovery of the Great Falls), focuses on events held around Black Eagle and other dams on the Great Falls of the Missouri.Sorich, Jake. \\"Luminaria Walk is Saturday.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 25, 2010. In mid-July, the River's Edge Trail Luminaria Walk occurs around Black Eagle Dam and the falls, and are illuminated with colored spotlights during the event. On May 5, 1998, the United States Forest Service opened the Lewis and Clark Interpretive Center, a $6 million museum and education center (which includes an exhibit hall, theater, store, and classrooms) which tells the story of Lewis and Clark's passage through central Montana and their discovery of the Great Falls of the Missouri.Skornogoski, Kim. \\"L&C; Center's Sixth Birthday.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 3, 2004; \\"Indians Unsung Heroes for Lewis and Clark.\\" Deseret News. May 23, 1999; \\"Lewis and Clark Center Details Indian Influence.\\" USA Today. June 26, 1998; Dresser, Michael and Dresser, Sheila. \\"A Symbol of Real American West: Waterfall.\\" Baltimore Sun. October 13, 1997. Much work has been done in the past two decades to create public access to and public viewing areas of the dam and falls. For decades, two gravel spaces existed on River Drive North near the Bob Speck Municipal Golf Course where drivers could stop, get out, and view Black Eagle Falls and the dam.Uda, Take; Newhouse, Eric; Winslow, Larry; and Loznak, Robin. \\"Lewis & Clark Portage Then and Now.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 26, 2005. In 1991, the River's Edge Trail, a paved and gravel pedestrian recreational trail, opened along tracks of the former Burlington Northern Railroad on the south bank of the Missouri River at Black Eagle Dam.Ecke, Richard. \\"Trail a Real 'Survivor'.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 2, 2001. In 2001, Tailrace Island was renamed Black Eagle Memorial Island (in honor of those workers who lost their lives while working on or at the dam) and turned over to the River's Edge Trail. A new section of the trail linking the existing trail was also opened that year. The same year, a public boathouse was constructed on Black Eagle Memorial Island for use by canoeists, kayakers, and other watercraft; observation decks; public restrooms; and parking lot. The boat landing was completed in October 2001.Wilmot, Paula. \\"New Canoe Landing Going In Below Black Eagle Dam.\\" Great Falls Tribune. October 19, 2001. Construction also began on a section of trail designed to link Art Higgins Memorial Park (on the north bank of the Missouri River just behind the dam) with the island. Most of the construction costs were paid for by PPL Montana. In 2001, another segment of the trail was added, leading from the Black Eagle Memorial Island spur up Smelter Hill.Johannes, Katie N. \\"2002 Planned Trail Improvements.\\" Great Falls Tribune. January 14, 2002. The trail was paid for by a Community Transportation Enhancement Project grant.The Community Transportation Enhancement Program is a program administered by the Montana Department of Transportation which provides small grants to transportation-related projects that strengthen the cultural, aesthetic, and environmental aspects of transportation. The program's focus is on non-traditional projects. There is no fee to enter Black Eagle Memorial Island, which is open daily to the public from 9 A.M. to 8 P.M. and is maintained by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks.\\"Outdoor Notebook.\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 25, 2004. In 2004, the River's Edge Trail was extended along the north bank of the Missouri River from the Black Eagle Dam powerhouse westward about to the 15th Street Bridge.Wilmot, Paula. \\"City Kicks Cash Toward Soccer Park, Trail.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 2, 2004. About $175,000 of the $204,500 cost of the extension was paid for by the Community Transportation Enhancement Program, and the remainder by the Montana Air Congestion Initiative (a state program), the American Public Land Exchange (a nonprofit organization), and Recreational Trails (a nonprofit which manages the trail).Lee, Sonja. \\"Island Day-Use Area Open to Public.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 3, 2005. Black Eagle Memorial Island opened to the public on June 2, 2005.\\"River's Edge Trail Runs 25 miles Over Hill and Dale.\\" Great Falls Tribune. March 20, 2005; Babcock, Michael. \\"Come for Ice Cream, Stay for the View.\\" Great Falls Tribune. June 2, 2005. The development of the River's Edge Trail and the growing importance of riverside parks and attractions around Black Eagle Dam and along the banks of the Missouri River led the city of Great Falls to develop its first Missouri River Urban Corridor Plan in 2003.\\"River's Edge Trail.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 31, 2003. The master plan, which covered both banks of the Missouri River from White Bear Island to Black Eagle Dam, inventoried the entire shoreline and assessed the riverbanks for condition, rehabilitation and refurbishment, and improvement opportunities. The plan laid out a number of options above and below Black Eagle Dam for improvements to public access, recreation, and beautification.Wilmot, Paula. \\"Commissioners OK Missouri Corridor Plan.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 5, 2004; Lee, Sonja. \\"Neighbors Give Cold Shoulder to Ice Proposal.\\" Great Falls Tribune. May 12, 2004. Black Eagle Dam has changed very little between its construction in 1926 and 2010. The ruins of the powerhouses from the 1890 dam and the 1913 reconstruction were still visible as of 2005. The large cast-iron sheets which formed the south bank penstocks can also still be seen.

The school, which was located next to George Pepper Middle School, was part of the School District of Philadelphia's Comprehensive High School Region; in its later years, it operated as a campus of John Bartram High School, which is still in operation. In 2013, amid the rapid growth of publicly-funded charter schools in Philadelphia, the City shut down Communications Technology High School, along with 22 other district-run schools, to cut costs and consolidate the district's remaining students on fewer campuses. Students enrolled at Communications Technology at the time were automatically re-enrolled at the main campus of John Bartram High School.  History  Communications Technology High School was originally known as the George Wolf School, named for the 19th century Pennsylvania governor nicknamed the \\"father\\" of the state's public schools. Construction began on the school building, designed by noted Philadelphia schools architect Irwin T. Catharine, in 1926, and the project was completed the following year. The building's three yellow brick stories, which are arranged in nine bays with projecting end bays and a raised basement, are built in the Late Gothic Revival-style; the design features an arched main center entrance surrounded by stone, a two-story projecting stone bay window, and a crenellated parapet.

The school's name was later changed to Communications Academy, as the school was made a part of John Bartram High School. In 2005, the name was changed again to Communications Technology High School. As of 2018, the City of Philadelphia planned to convert the former high school to a community center, while the adjacent Pepper Middle School building was slated for demolition.  School uniforms  Communications Technology High School students were required to wear school uniforms, which consisted of either white golf shirts with the school's name on the right or black shirts with navy blue or black khaki bottoms and skirts.

Ancient Egyptian clothes refers to clothing worn in ancient Egypt from the end of the Neolithic period (prior to 3100 BC) to the collapse of the Ptolemaic Kingdom with the death of Cleopatra in 30 BC. Egyptian clothing was filled with a variety of colors. Adorned with precious gems and jewels, the fashions of the ancient Egyptians were made for not only beauty but also comfort. Egyptian fashion was created to keep cool while in the hot desert. Elements of Egyptian clothing Sample of ancient Egyptian linen from Saqqara, dating to 390-343 BC (Late Period) In ancient Egypt, linen was by far the most common textile. It helped people to be comfortable in the subtropical heat. Linen is made from the flax plant by spinning the fibers from the stem of the plant. Spinning, weaving and sewing were very important techniques for all Egyptian societies. Plant dyes could be applied to clothing but the clothing was usually left in its natural color. Wool was known, but considered impure. Only the wealthy wore animal fibers that were the object of taboos. They were used on occasion for overcoats, but were forbidden in temples and sanctuaries. Peasants, workers and other people of modest condition often wore nothing, but the shenti (made of flax) was worn by all people. Slaves often worked naked. The most common headdress was the khat or nemes, a striped cloth worn by men. Deities There were several ancient Egyptian deities related to fabrics, clothing and weaving, chiefly the god Hedjhotep and the goddess Tayt. Pharaohs Royal clothing is particularly well documented, as well as the khat, nemes, and crowns of the pharaohs. The pharaohs would often wear animal skins, usually leopard or lion, as a sign of their station. Men From about 2130 BC during the Old Kingdom, garments were simple. The men wore wrap around skirts known as the shendyt, which were belted at the waist, sometimes pleated or gathered in the front. During this time, men's skirts were short. As the Middle Kingdom of Egypt (1600 BC), came, the skirt was worn longer. Then, around 1420 BC, there was a light tunic or blouse with sleeves, as well as a pleated petticoat. Women Network dress. Faience, blue and black cylinder beads, two breast caps and two strings of Mitra beads. 5th Dynasty. From burial 978 at Qau (Tjebu), Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Egyptian woman in a kalasiris During the Old, Middle and New Kingdom, ancient Egyptian women mostly wore a simple sheath dress called a kalasiris. Women's clothing in ancient Egypt was more conservative than men's clothing. The dresses were held up by one or two straps and were worn down to the ankle, while the upper edge could be worn above or below the breasts. The length of the dress denoted the social class of the wearer.Ancient Egypt: Clothing. Reshafim.org.il. Retrieved on 2012-05-05. Beading or feathers were also used as an embellishment on the dress.Egypt: Daily Life. sptimes.com Over the dress, women had a choice of wearing shawls, capes, or robes. The shawl was a piece of fine linen cloth around 4 feet wide by 13 or 14 feet long. This was mostly worn pleated as well. Until the mid-Eighteenth Dynasty women wore a tight-fitting sheath dress, a simple garment that falls from just below the breasts to just above the ankles, being held up by two shoulder straps. On statues the straps cover the breasts, but in painting and relief the single breast depicted in profile is exposed. The dress hugs the body with no slack. Also when women are shown in movement, sitting or kneeling, the dress still clings to the outline of the body as if elasticated. However Egyptian clothes were mostly made from linen, which tends to sag. Surviving dresses consist of a body made from a tube of material sewn up one side, supported not by straps but by a bodice with sleeves. In contrast to dresses shown in art, such linen garments tend to be baggy, and would conceal rather than reveal the body.Gay Robin: Women in ancient Egypt (p. 181-2), British museum press, 1993, Children Children wore no clothing until 6 years old. Once they turned six years old they were allowed to wear clothing to protect them from the dry heat. A popular hairstyle among the children was the side-lock, an unshaved length of hair on the right side of the head. Even though children usually wore no clothing, they wore jewelry such as anklets, bracelets, collars, and hair accessories. When they grew up, they wore the same styles as their parents. Wigs Painting of a woman with a wig and head cone, circa 1250‚Äì1200 BCE Wigs were worn by the wealthy of both sexes. Made from human hair and sometimes supplemented with date palm fiber, they were often styled in tight curls and narrow braids.Alfred Lucas et al., Ancient Egyptian Materials and Industries. Dover, 1934. p. 30-1. For special occasions, both men and women could top their wigs with cones of perfumed fat that would melt to release their fragrance and condition the hair.Chaudhri, S, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutics (Jul 2009), p. 164 Jewelry Pectoral of Senusret II, Metropolitan Museum of Art Jewelry was very popular in ancient Egypt, no matter the social class. It was heavy and rather voluminous. The main reason for wearing jewelry is because of its aesthetic function. The Egyptians were quite soberly dressed in white linen fabrics, and jewelry offered a possibility for contrast. The Egyptian preference was towards the use of bright colors, lustrous stones and precious metals. Gold was won in large quantities in the eastern desert of Egypt, but also came from Nubia, that was an Egyptian colony for centuries. On the other hand, silver was rare and was imported from Asia. Therefore, it was silver that was often considered more precious than gold. The eastern desert was also an important source for colorful semi-precious stones such as carnelian, amethyst and jasper. In the Sinai were turquoise mines, the deep blue lapis lazuli had to come from far away Afghanistan. Glass and faience (glaze over a core of stone or sand) were favorites to replace rocks because they could be produced in many colors.‚Äì Ancient Egyptian Jewelry. Dr. Maarten van Raven, Curator Archaeological Museum, Leiden, the Netherlands 2016-01-02. Retrieved on 2016-03-17. The Egyptians became very skilled when making jewelry from turquoise, metals like gold and silver, and small beads. Both men and women adorned themselves with earrings, bracelets, rings, necklaces and neck collars that were brightly colored. Those who could not afford jewelry made from gold or other stones would make their jewelry from colored pottery beads.Clothing ‚Äì Ancient Egypt . Historyonthenet.com (2010-04-30).

One creation that was specific to ancient Egypt was the gorgerine, an assembly of metal discs worn on the chest, either over bare skin or over a shirt, and attached in the back. Cosmetics Ancient Egyptian cosmetic set from c. 1550‚Äì1458 BC, featuring, from left to right, a kohl tube, a razor, a pair of tweezers, a whetstone, and a mirror Embalming allowed the development of cosmetics and perfumes. The perfumes of Egypt were the most numerous, but also the most sought and the costliest of antiquity, which used them extensively. The Egyptians used makeup most of all the ancient people. Nails and hands were painted with henna. Black kohl, which was used to mark eyes, was obtained from galena. Eye shadow was made from crushed malachite. Red, which was applied to lips, came from ochre. These products were mixed with animal fat to make them compact and to preserve them. Both men and women wore galena or malachite eyeliner to protect the eyes and enhance their beauty. Findings were published by American Chemical Society in the journal Analytic Chemistry suggest that the use of lead in makeup was intentional. Findings suggest that the lead in combination with salts produced naturally by the body produce nitric oxide which boosts the immune system. It is believed that the production and result were intentional. The increase in immune productivity would help to prevent infections like conjunctivitis.\\"Cleopatra's Eye Makeup Warded Off Infections?\\" nationalgeographic.com Retrieved on 2012-05-05. Footwear 18th Dynasty sandals, circa 1390‚Äì1352 BCE Footwear was the same for both sexes. It consisted of coiled sewn sandals of leatherwork, or for the priestly class, papyrus. Since Egyptians were usually barefoot, sandals were worn on special occasions or at times when their feet might get hurt.

Max was introduced in the 2001 third- person shooter Max Payne, which was written by Sam Lake and developed by Remedy Entertainment. The game's publisher, 3D Realms, intended Max to serve as the \\"foundation of a new gaming franchise\\". In the first game, the character was portrayed by Lake, with Timothy Gibbs and James McCaffrey later taking over the role, and consistently voiced by McCaffrey. Mark Wahlberg portrayed Max in the film adaptation. The first game in the series presents the story as retold by Max from his point of view, while the sequel, Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, alternates between his and that of the femme fatale character Mona Sax. In the original Max Payne, Max is an NYPD police detective and an undercover special agent for the DEA. Max becomes a vigilante following the murder of his family and, later, the murder of his police partner, which he was framed for. Later, he returns to the department as a detective before his life is soon shattered by death and betrayal. At the start of Max Payne 3 by Rockstar Games, he finds himself employed as a bodyguard for Rodrigo Branco, a wealthy man in Brazil. Max Payne has been well received by media. Character development Sam Lake created the character; his face was used in the original Max Payne In the creation of Max Payne, the publisher 3D Realms \\"wanted to develop another strong character that would be the foundation for a new gaming franchise, much like we [3D Realms] had done with Duke Nukem.\\" The titular character of Max Payne was originally named Max Heat, and 3D Realms spent over $20,000 worldwide trademarking this name before someone at the company suggested the last name Payne, which was immediately adopted. He was modeled after Sam Lake (Sami J√§rvi), who wrote the game's story and script for the Finnish company Remedy Entertainment. Lake also dressed up and played this role for the graphic novel-style cutscenes. For Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne, however, Lake declined the role. Due to having a much larger budget this time, the developers were able to hire professional actors, choosing Timothy Gibbs to be the new model for Max. In both games, Max's voice actor was James McCaffrey. McCaffrey recalled: \\"Originally, I‚Äôd worked on a show called Swift Justice, and there were some similarities between the two characters in terms of them both having experienced some family tragedy and were familiar with the concept of vengeance, but there weren‚Äôt any specific characters that Max is based on.\\" In an early announcement from Rockstar Games (the franchise's new developer and publisher), Max's voice actor was to be recast with an older actor. In the end, however, McCaffrey did return to the role of Max in Max Payne 3, for which he also provided the motion capture material. McCaffrey said that performing motion capture helped match the dialogue to the scenes and compared it to \\"having to act in Avatar.\\" Payne's look changed significantly for the third game, featuring an older, bald and bearded Max; this move received overwhelmingly negative reactions. In response, Rockstar Games made changes to the game, as Max's appearance shifts over the course of the game, including his 'classic' appearance during flashbacks of his time in New Jersey. According to Rockstar's Sam Houser, \\"This is Max as we've never seen him before, a few years older, more world- weary and cynical than ever.\\" McCaffrey compared Max in the third game to Charles Bronson's character Paul Kersey in the film Death Wish. =Attributes= Max Payne has been put into a fatalist situation against his will, in the style of a classic element of many noir films, the fall guy. Max is an antihero, as he himself states: \\"I was not one of them, I was no hero.\\" The character is noted for his complex use of both metaphors and wordplay to describe the world around him within his inner monologues, which often contradict his external responses to characters he speaks with. He is an extreme introvert and his life is largely illustrated through dramatic and often morbidly cynical soliloquies describing his feelings about his actions and situation.For example, regarding his bullet time abilities, Max comments: \\"Einstein was right. Time is relative to the observer. When you're looking down the barrel of a gun, time slows down. Your whole life flashes by, heartbreak and scars. Stay with it, and you can live a lifetime in that split second.\\" (Max Payne 2) It is also hinted through the games that Max has a questionable grip on reality. At the beginning of the first game, Max is seen differently as a smiling, happily married extrovert with a bright personality. However, after his family is murdered, Max loses his meaning of life and blindly works toward his only remaining purpose: vengeance. However, he has not nullified his feelings, as he is taken with the femme fatale contract killer Mona Sax when they first meet, and befriends Vladimir Lem. All the while, Max shows signs of survivor's guilt and self-destructive behaviour, considering his life to have ended \\"in a New York minute\\". At the end of the second game, he finally seems to find peace within himself, saying: \\"I had a dream of my wife. She was dead. But it was alright.\\" However, this is not the case in Max Payne 3 as in the opening cinematic, the drunk Max angrily throws a portrait of what is implied to be his family against his apartment wall. He regrets this act and picks up the picture. Rockstar vice-president Dan Houser described Max Payne in the third game as \\"a drunk, somewhat morose, widowed ex-cop, trying to find some kind of peace with himself. [...] A man who has spent his life killing, even in the service of his idea of what is right or wrong, is going to be extremely damaged. [...] He wants to be a thinker but he's much better as a doer. When he thinks, he gets wrapped up in himself or makes mistakes. When he acts, he is brilliant, almost super human. That is his character, and the dichotomy between the two is the reality of his life and at the heart of the game. He cannot seem to move forward emotionally, but physically, he is relentless.\\" Max is shown to be quite aware of his shortcomings and flaws, stating: \\"I'm not slipping. I'm slipped. I'm a bad joke.\\" Max Payne 3 has him display not only extreme violence but also more restraint than in the previous games. Appearances =In video games= An outfit worn by Sam Lake for Max's role in the original game's cutscenes on display at Game On exhibition in the Science Museum In the original game, spanning the period of three years between 1998 and 2001, Max Payne (voiced by James McCaffrey) is a former New York City Police Department (NYPD) homicide detective whose wife Michelle and six-month-old daughter Rose were brutally murdered in a home invasion connected with the investigation of a new street drug known as Valkyr. Enraged, Max joined the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) as a secret agent and went undercover in the Mafia. Eventually, framed for the murder of his NYPD and DEA partner Alex Balder, and with his identity exposed, Max becomes a fugitive wanted by the Mafia and the police alike while waging his personal war on the crime. Eventually, he discovers and seemingly destroys a powerful conspiracy behind all these events. After solving the Valkyr case and avenging his family, Max is cleared by his contact in the powerful secret society known as the Inner Circle, and returns to the NYPD. In the first sequel, taking place in 2003, Max begins investigating a series of murders by a shadowy group of professional killers called the Cleaners. Soon, Max reunites with the murder suspect Mona Sax to solve the mysteries of the Inner Circle; the investigation leads to Mona's death. Following the events of the second game, Max is dismissed from the force, and is now addicted to alcohol and painkillers. After a violent mob confrontation, he eventually leaves New York City for the unfamiliar streets of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Max gets a job working in a security detail for Rodrigo Branco, a wealthy businessman along with Raul Passos who went through police training with Max. After Rodrigo's wife is kidnapped, Max and Raul discover and then destroy a human organ harvesting ring involving local street gangs, right-wing paramilitary mercenaries and a corrupt Brazilian special police force. =In film= Mark Wahlberg at the premiere of the film version In the film adaptation, loosely based on the plot of the first game in the series, Max Payne, played by Mark Wahlberg, is a NYPD cop seeking revenge against his family's killers. When Mark Wahlberg first read Beau Thorne's script he thought it was \\"awesome\\" but became wary after finding out it was based on a video game. Describing his role, Wahlberg said: \\"It's probably one of the edgier roles I've played but also the most layered. Here's a very happy guy who worked a dismal job, had a beautiful family. But the beauty in his life was taken away. He just goes on a rampage. It's all driven by emotion.\\" 3D Realms' Scott Miller, however, said Max Payne was poorly portrayed in the film, falling short of the game's standards. =Other appearances= A three-issue Max Payne 3 tie-in digital comic, created and released in partnership between Rockstar Games and Marvel Comics explores Max's early years and the events prior to the third game in the series. Max was born to Helen and Jack Payne. Max's father was a PTSD suffering Vietnam veteran who cheated on and sometimes beat his wife. An important influence on the boy was his maternal grandfather; a college professor who would tell him stories of ancient mythology. Helen died in 1976, possibly due to her alcoholism; Jack's death followed three years later. As a young man, Max graduated from the New York City Police Academy as the top trainee in his class. Several years later, he has first met his future wife Michelle by saving her from two robbers. They married six months later and their daughter was born on February 4, 1998. In 2012, several sets of Max Payne's Xbox Live Avatar clothes from the original game were released by Rockstar on the Xbox Live Marketplace. Max Payne 3 Special Edition was bundled with a 10\\" tall collectible Max Payne statue made by TriForce. According to an Easter egg in Remedy Entertainment's Alan Wake, Max died 13 years after the events of Max Payne 2 (in 2016). However, this is not canonical, as the rights to the series have moved to Rockstar Games. In Rockstar's 2013 Grand Theft Auto V, the player character Michael can be customized to look like Max in Max Payne 3. Reception Max Payne was named the year's best game character by Eurogamer in 2001. In 2008, PC Zone ranked him as PC gaming's seventh-best character, commenting: \\"He might be a film noir clich√©, but Max Payne is a relatively unique specimen in games, with a superb script and suitably smooth voice acting to match.\\" Game Informer included him on their list of game characters that \\"shaped the 2000s,\\" as chosen by the staff and readers alike. In 2011, readers of Guinness World Records voted Max as the 42nd-top video game character of all time. In 2012, GamesRadar ranked him as the 23rd on their list of the \\"100 best heroes in video games\\", saying that while he had the worst luck on the planet, \\"he managed to maintain his sanity and prevail\\". Gulf News ranked him as second on their 2011 list of top video game characters, adding that \\"his no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners attitude won him legions of fans.\\" That same year, 360 ranked his name as fifth on their list of the top \\"manliest\\" character names on Xbox 360. IGN featured Max prominently in their 2012 article \\"A History of Badasses,\\" ranked him as the gaming's \\"most notorious\\" antihero that same year, and called him \\"one of video games' most troubled characters.\\" That same year, GamesRadar included Max among the \\"13 unluckiest bastards in gaming,\\" stating that \\"it‚Äôs hard to think of a protagonist who gets shit on more relentlessly than Max Payne\\" and noting him for having \\"the most comically overwrought internal monologues ever to appear in a game.\\" In 2013, Complex ranked him as the 42nd \\"most badass\\" video game character of all time. Max's relationship with Mona Sax was considered to be one of the most \\"disastrous game romances\\" by GamesRadar in 2011. The sex scene between Max and Mona was described by Games.net as \\"one of the most fitting ever seen in a video game,\\" considering it to lack the gratuitousness that most sex scenes in video games exhibit. In 2013, Complex included Max Payne at the number-two spot on their list of \\"old school\\" video game characters who were style icons, as \\"the gritty, hard-boiled NYC cop look was a perfect fit.\\" The character's initial design changes during the long development cycle of Max Payne 3 brought severe criticism from the fan community as well as the media; UGO commented that \\"his suave, noir look got booted by trailer trash sensibilities\\" and blamed Obadiah Stane, Bam Bam Bigelow, John McClane and Kerry King for being \\"most responsible for Max's new style.\\" Keith Stuart of The Guardian opined that, with the third game, Rockstar succeeded in turning \\"its ex-cop anti-hero into a credible character,\\" even as there is a \\"slight disconnect between the shambling Max of the cinematic sequences and the athletic psychopath we control in the interactive sections.\\" See also *List of fictional police detectives *List of vigilantes in popular culture References Action video game characters Fictional alcohol abusers Fictional American people in video games Fictional bodyguards in video games Fictional characters from New York City Fictional characters with neurological or psychological disorders Fictional Drug Enforcement Administration personnel Fictional mass murderers Fictional painkiller addicts Fictional New York City Police Department detectives Male characters in video games Max Payne Fictional police officers in video games Video game characters in comics Video game characters in film Video game characters introduced in 2001 Video game protagonists Vigilante characters in video games ","title":"Max Payne (character)"},{"id":"31473499","text":"The Coshocton County Career Center (CCCC) is a Vocational School located in Coshocton County, Ohio.

As of March 2011, the gompa was said to house 2,500 monks. However, reports indicate its population has declined substantially as a result of a crackdown by authorities. History Kirti Gompa was founded in 1472 by Rongpa Chenakpa, a disciple of Tsongkhapa. It was established as a branch of Taktsang Lhamo Kirti Gompa (Nama Ge‚Äôerde Si) near the border with Gansu Province in 1693 but has outgrown its mother monastery. The first Kirti Monastery founded by Kirti Rinpoche was in Gyelrang. These days the two main Kirti Monasteries are in Taktsang Lhamo and Ngawa prefecture, in Sichuan, China. Prior to the reorganisation of provincial administrations in 1955, the area was in Sikang province, and was part of the largely autonomous and culturally Tibetan region of Kham. Taktsang Lhamo was destroyed during the Cultural revolution and has now been rebuilt.Marc Moniez, Christian Deweirdt, Monique Masse, Le Tibet, 1991, , p. 513 There are numerous (approximately 30‚Äì40) smaller monasteries affiliated with the Kirti Monasteries spread throughout the region. The 11th Kirti Tsenzhab Rinpoche was born in 1926 and moved to Lhasa in 1957 and accompanied the Dalai Lama into exile in India in 1959. During a period of relative freedom in China, in 1984 he visited the People's Republic as the head of a delegation from the Tibetan Government-in- Exile, meeting Chinese government representatives in Beijing and touring Tibetan regions, including Ngawa. However, after the hardening of Chinese government policy in the aftermath of the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, relations between Beijing and Dharamsala soured, and in response he founded a Kirti Monastery in Dharamsala in India in April 1990, with monks coming across the border to join the new monastery.Kirti Monastery He died in 2006. The current, 12th Kirti Rinpoche, born in 1940, is the 55th lama to head the monastery. Ngawa Kirti Gompa Ngawa Kirti Gompa (sometimes referred to as Ge‚Äôerdengsi or Gerdeng Monastery), properly known as Kirti Kalari Gon Tashi Lhundrub, is a Gelugpa monastery on the northwestern edge of Ngawa City, the main city in Ngawa County, within the Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture in northwestern Sichuan, China. It is located on the Tibetan plateau at an elevation of 3,200 metres (10,499 ft.) Outside the north wall of the monastery is a towering statue of Shakyamuni Buddha. The imposing Assembly Hall or Tensi Dratsang (Dialectical College) has 120 pillars. It contains an 8-metre (26 ft) statue of Maitreya, flanked by Jowo Shakyamuni and Kirti Lobzang Chungla. There are also several other important buildings including: the Chokhang (Offering Chapel), the Lhabrang or residence of Kirti Rinpoche, the Zhungkhang (Monastic Office), the Gyupa Dratsang (Tantric College), the Menpa Dratsang (Medical College), and the Dukhor Dratsang (Kalacakra College). Kirti Gompa is also famous for its 30-metre (98-ft) high white chorten known as the Dudul Chorten which has numerous chapels on the various floors respectively dedicated to Shakyamuni Buddha, Mahakarunika, and the Three Deities of Longevity, Tsongkhapa and Sitatapatra. It the largest Tibetan Monastery in Ngawa town. =Incidents= The monastery is the center of the wave of Tibetan self-immolation. It is under close supervision by the People's Armed Police. The monks at Kirti monastery have long been restive, engaging in political protests, A self-immolation of a monk occurred in March 2011, for which several other colluding monks were arrested. The Free Tibet Campaign (FTC) says that the monastery's population declined from 2,500 to 600 in March 2011 because of a crackdown on political and other illegal activities. In October, a series of monks under the age of 24 attempted copycat suicides by self-immolation at Kirti Monastery. Police are investigating their motives: the International Campaign for Tibet alleges that the monks shouted anti- government slogans while setting themselves on fire, but independent media did not have access to the area. The ITC and FTC say that nine monks and nuns in the area have self-immolated in 2011, and that police and military surveillance has increased as a result. Tibet expert Dibyesh Anand said that the peer pressure of fellow monks to prove their own \\"patriotism\\" was partly to blame, as well as the desperation of disciplined monks who had only religious and no vocational training. A spokesperson for the Tibetan government-in-exile told the BBC that Tibetan Buddhism did not condone such violence, but the 14th Dalai Lama led a prayer service to honor the suicided monks. A spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry accused the Dalai Lama of thus \\"glorifying\\" and \\"inciting\\" more suicides. Taksang Lhamo Kirti Gompa The Taksang Lhamo Kirti Gompa is located in the Zorge district, Sichuan Province. It has approximately 700 monks in residence. Kirti Jepa Datsang Gompa Kirti Rinpoche in a demonstration in Washington in 2011 Kirti Jepa Datsang Gompa is located in Dharamsala, India. It was built in 1992 to house Tibetan exile monks from Tibet. Today, the monks number approximately 200 and includes Kirti Rinpoche. Darjeeling Kirti Gompa This is a small Kirti Monastery in Darjeeling, India with approximately 40 monks. Ceremonies New Year (Losar) Festivals in the first Lunar month include masked dances and the display of a large thangka. As part of the Monlam Festival there is a ceremony for \\"Sunning the Buddha\\", and a big thangka of Tsongkhapa is displayed on a huge Thangka Wall behind the monastery. This Khakhl Sham (Appliqu√© Tangkha Show) was first held in 1468 by the First Dalai Lama, Gendun Drub (1391‚Äì1474). Originally the thangka was smaller, but after the 4th Panchen Lama, Lobzang Chokyi Gyeltsen (1567‚Äì1662), the size was increased more and more until it reached its present dimensions.

Ahmad Chaudhry is an American radiologist, Associate Professor at the University of Vermont, and Interim Associate Dean for Research, in the College of Nursing and Health Sciences.http://www.uvm.edu/~cnhs/?Page=faculty/chaudhry.html He received a Ph.D. degree in molecular biology from the University of Manchester, UK. He did postdoctoral research work at the University of Alberta in Canada, before joining the University of Pennsylvania as a Senior Research Investigator. His research interests are micro-RNA responses to radiation exposure, radiation- induced bystander effect, cell cycle perturbations and the enzymatic processing of clustered DNA damage.  Education  * Ph.D., University of Manchester, UK, Molecular Biology, 1990 * M.Sc., University of Manchester, UK, Molecular Biology, 1987  Research Interests  * Radiation Biology * DNA repair * Micro-RNA  The role of micro-RNA in the cellular response to radiation treatment  Ionizing radiation interferes with cellular functions at all levels of cell organization. The ionizing radiation-induced stress response is very complex and involves many cellular processes. Dr. Chaudry is investigating the involvement of small non-coding micro-RNA in the response of human cells exposed to ionizing radiation. Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are small non- protein-coding single-stranded RNAs of ~22 nucleotides that function as negative gene regulators. miRNA negatively regulate their targets either by binding with perfect or nearly perfect complementarity to protein coding mRNA sequences to induce the RNA-mediated interference (RNAi) pathway. Most miRNAs do not cleave their mRNA targets as a mechanism of gene regulation. These miRNAs bind to imperfect complementary sites within the 3‚Ä≤ untranslated regions (UTRs) of their mRNA targets. In this case the target-gene repression occurs post-transcriptionally at the level of translation resulting in reduced protein levels but the mRNA levels remain unaffected. A single miRNA has the capability to bind to as many as 200 diverse gene targets ranging from transcription factors, secreted factors, receptors and transporters, thus potentially controlling the expression of about one-third of human mRNAs. Research has identified cell type specific modulation of several miRNA in gamma radiation and X-ray-treated human cells. Other studies from our laboratory showed that the expression of many miRNA markedly differ within the same cell line after exposure to either low or high doses of radiation. His work also identified radiation-induced modulation of miRNA in cells with altered DNA repair capability. These studies have provided evidence that miRNA are involved in the response to ionizing radiation exposure in human cells. Selected publications *Chaudhry, M. A., Kreger, B. and Omaruddin, R. A.

It aired on April 11, 2011. Plot Ted and the others realize how much he and Zoey argue, a polar opposite of Lily and Marshall‚Äôs relationship, where the two always seem to be in support of each other. Ted and Lily argue throughout the episode about whose relationship is better. However, Ted begins to feel Lily is right and is growing tired of his constant feuding with Zoey; he is also especially annoyed that Zoey had requested the Arcadian be listed as a landmark, which could scrap his entire project if accepted. When Ted argues again with Zoey about his dream to build a skyscraper in New York, he begins thinking he needs to break up with her. However, Ted realizes he has grown fond of their arguing (\\"graduation goggles\\"), and instead kisses her. Future Ted muses on which type of relationship is better, but promptly decides a supportive one is best, a fact his younger self would have to learn the hard way. Marshall has been growing increasingly displeased with his job at GNB, and is considering quitting to get a job with the Natural Resources Defense Council. Lily assures him that he has her full support no matter what, despite Barney pointing out Marshall's new job would pay considerably less. Lily's resolve is tested, however, when Marshall quits GNB and begins work at the NRDC, but only in a volunteer capacity. Marshall later offers his home to host an NRDC fundraiser, and Lily takes Ted to pick up a guest from the airport. When they arrive, however, Lily reveals she is fed up with Marshall's plans, and worried that their future may be in jeopardy due to the lack of income. She promptly leaves to head to Spain, a trip she had been hoping to take with Marshall, but one that now seems impossible. Later, at the fundraiser, Ted attempts to tell Marshall about Lily, but she makes a surprise return and assures Marshall again that he has her support. When Ted glances skeptically at her, Lily breaks down and reveals her doubts, but Marshall thanks Lily for her support and states that he will begin looking for another job with pay. Upon hearing Marshall's decision to quit GNB, Barney is considerably shaken, prompting Robin to wonder if it is because of Barney's recent estrangement from his father. After Robin witnesses Barney tearing up his office, the two finally talk about it. Barney explains the real reason: some time ago, Marshall had pointed out some marinara sauce on Barney's suit while eating a meatball sub. Extremely irked by this comment, Barney spent months plotting his revenge, designing an exploding meatball sub to give to Marshall. Marshall had quit on the day Barney had planned to have Marshall receive the sub, denying him his chance at revenge. In the end, ten years later, Barney is shown apparently on his death bed, with his grieving friends beside him. Barney tells Marshall to eat a meatball sub as his last request; the sub promptly explodes in Marshall's face, and Barney reveals he isn't actually sick, rejoicing at having finally taken his revenge. When Ted points out some marinara sauce on Barney's clothes, Barney begins eyeing Ted in the same vengeful way he had with Marshall. Reception Donna Bowman of the A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ score. She said the subplots about the GNB headquarters project, Marshall and Lily's efforts to have a baby, and Marshall's dream to be an environmental lawyer, melded together after being sidelined for weeks because of the death of Marshall's father and the appearance of Barney's father. Robert Canning of IGN rated the episode at 6.5 out of 10, saying the episode had very unsatisfying results in trying to be grounded in reality.

Nonetheless, President Uribe offered him another diplomatic post, and this time the host nation permitted it; Iguar√°n was sworn in as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Colombia to the Republic of Egypt by Chancellor Jaime Berm√∫dez Merizalde on 2 March 2010 and travelling that same day to Egypt to assume his official duties, and presented his letters of credence to Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak on 27 June 2010. He served as ambassador until early 2012.

Overseas Taiwanese may or may not be Taiwanese nationals. Description =Taiwanese national identity= The Taiwanese national identity began to emerge in prominence during Japanese rule in Taiwan. Several organizations and political parties were founded within Taiwan during this period in order to advocate for Taiwan Independence, such as the Taiwan Cultural Association. Following the controversial Chinese annexation (reclamation) of Taiwan on 25 October 1945, which is celebrated annually as \\"Retrocession Day\\", Taiwan has been claimed by the Republic of China. However, there is a strong case that Taiwan has actually never been incorporated into China's national territory and that Taiwan's current political status is \\"undetermined\\" but functions as its own nation; this is contrasted against arguments that claim that Taiwan is a province of the Republic of China or a province of the People's Republic of China. Since the end of martial law in Taiwan and the development of democratic multi-party elections under the political framework of the Republic of China, the political status of Taiwan has remained controversial. There exists within Taiwan a polarising \\"Blue/Green\\" political divide, wherein the Pan-Blue Coalition believes that Taiwan is (or should be) a province of China, whereas the Pan-Green Coalition believes that Taiwan is (or should be) an independent country. Meanwhile, the People's Republic of China claims Taiwan as its own \\"Taiwan Province\\". = Early Taiwanese diaspora = In 1895, Japan emerged victorious over China in the First Sino-Japanese War. As a result, the Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed. In this treaty, Japan outlined several of its demands, one of which was that the islands of Formosa and the Pescadores (i.e. Taiwan) should be transferred from Chinese sovereignty to Japanese sovereignty. Following the signing of the treaty, the Chinese Government abandoned Taiwan and permitted a Japanese seizure of Taiwan. A short-lived republic was established on the island in 1895, in order to deter a Japanese invasion and annexation of Taiwan, but it was defeated in the same year, and the island of Taiwan was then absorbed into Japan. Within the Treaty of Shimonoseki, it was agreed that the inhabitants of Taiwan would be permitted to sell their property and leave the island within a two-year period from 1895 until 1897. A minuscule percentage of the population of Taiwan opted to return to China, and an unknown number fled as refugees to other countries in the Asia-Pacific Region, such as the Netherlands East Indies (Indonesia). Those Taiwanese who remained on the island were, by the terms of the treaty, deemed to be Japanese subjects. They would later lose their Japanese nationality in 1952 with the signing of the Treaty of Taipei between Japan and the Republic of China in Taiwan. However, the legitimacy of the treaty is disputed. Travel between China and Japanese Taiwan was possible. The small number of Taiwanese people living in China were re-absorbed into Chinese culture, though some became advocates of Chinese Unification. It is known that members of the early Taiwanese Communist Party were closely affiliated with the Chinese Communist Party prior to the establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949. The failed Taiwanese Communist Party would later evolve into the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League, one of eight officially-recognised political parties within the People's Republic of China which is ultimately subservient to the Chinese Communist Party. Many members of this party have been Taiwanese people residing in China. During World War II, roughly 600 Taiwanese people living in the Netherlands East Indies (NEI) were arrested on the basis of their Japanese nationality or other links to the Japanese empire. Because the NEI government suspected that they would support the Japanese invasion of Indonesia or might provide the Imperial Japanese Army with sensitive information, the ~600 Taiwanese prisoners were deported to Australia in December 1941, and they were interned in Australia until March 1946. Several Taiwanese (Indonesian) children were born in Australia during the period of internment, receiving Australian citizenship at birth, and effectively creating a new \\"Taiwanese Australian\\" community. Taiwanese people had previously had a very minor presence in Australia. =Laws regarding overseas Taiwanese citizens= Overseas citizens must return to Taiwan to legally vote in elections, as Taiwan does not use absentee ballots. =Taiwanese in North America (US, Canada)= In the United States, there are 230,382 to 919,000 people of Taiwanese descent living in the country.

It first aired on Fox in the United States on October 2, 2011. The episode's plot mainly revolves around the Smith family, who prepare for evacuation in response to an oncoming hurricane. Reluctant to leave his home, Stan encourages his family to ride out the storm in their house with him. The hurricane sends a flood to the city of Langley Falls, which puts the entire family in danger. \\"Hurricane!\\" is the final part of the Night of the Hurricane block with Family Guy and The Cleveland Show. Kevin Reilly, the president of the entertainment division of Fox Broadcasting Company, introduced the idea of a crossover to Seth MacFarlane, the creator of all three shows. The episode was first announced at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. The episode's plot is loosely modeled to that of the disaster film The Poseidon Adventure. Originally scheduled to air on May 1, 2011, as the season finale for the seventh season, \\"Hurricane!\\" was postponed due to the 2011 Super Outbreak. The episode was well received by television critics, who praised its humor and cultural references. It was viewed by 5.72 million viewers upon its initial airing, while also receiving a 2.6/6 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. \\"Hurricane!\\" was written by Erik Sommers, and directed by Tim Parsons. It featured the guest voices of Mike Barker, Lisa Edelstein, Jeff Fischer, Mike Henry, Matt McKenna, Kevin Michael Richardson, and Kristen Schaal. Plot When a hurricane arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their home with their neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing it is the best way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have been left behind in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the Smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater. Roger cries when his girlfriend falls to the floor and gets impaled by a moose antler chandelier (although it is only because she is wearing his favourite sweater). Later, The attic starts to fill it with water. Hayley tries to get the door shut, but they cannot get it open due to many boxes and items on top of it. Klaus, seeing the home being flooded, says he is able to go wherever he wants and says \\"See you never, fkers!\\" . He jumps out of the fishbowl into the water, but his skin burns due to the water being ocean water. Hayley puts Klaus back in his fishbowl. The others make a rope out of curtins to get them out of the attic after removing the boxes out of the way of the door. Roger picks up his wigs instead of Klaus so that he can still go to cowboy weddings, leaving him behind. Francine tells the family to go down the rope one at the time as it is too weak. Unfortunately, Jeff panics and jumps on the rope, which ends up tearing it down, angering Hayley as the Smiths are now stuck in the second floor of the tipped over house. As the storm worsens, the family becomes increasingly frightened and distrustful of Stan, especially when his latest advice leads Hayley to be attacked by a great white shark. With the shark loose in the house, the family fights for survival. Stan loses hope and admits Francine's suggestions are better than his own, until Klaus gives him an encouragement speech which inspires him to prove himself reliable in a crisis once more. Stan obtains a grizzly bear from the zoo to battle the shark, which only further aggravates the situation when the two animals work together to kill the family. Refusing to accept Francine's pleas to just get help, Stan instead throws a javelin which, instead of killing the bear, accidentally impales Francine in the shoulder much to Stan's horror. Buckle enters the house with a tranquilizer gun and sedates the two predators before also shooting Stan on the grounds that he was an equal threat, who later tells Buckle that he made the right call. Despite the whole ordeal, Stan is no longer convinced that he should stay out of a future crisis. After the storm clears, Stan looks out to scope the damage done by the storm, only to find himself in a stand-off with Cleveland Brown and Peter Griffin, whose houses have ended up on both sides of the Smiths' house, since the same hurricane hit their respective towns earlier. When Francine comes out the front door, Stan accidentally shoots her, which Peter claims to be \\"classic American Dad!\\" due to its unpredictability. Production The episode was first announced in July 2010 by series creator Seth MacFarlane at the Comic-Con International in San Diego, California. Kevin Reilly, the entertainment president of the Fox Broadcasting Company, originally pitched the idea for the crossover, which was inspired by theme nights of comedy shows from the 1980s. MacFarlane described the crossover event to be an \\"enormous challenge\\" and a \\"substantial undertaking\\"; he chose to do one central story line so that each writing staff would not have to write stories for unfamiliar characters. He was also willing to do another crossover event if this one received successful ratings. Much of the episode plot in \\"Hurricane!\\" was modeled after the action adventure disaster film, The Poseidon Adventure. In his interview on the plot of the final part of the crossover episode, Mike Barker, a producer for American Dad, stated that \\"[they] end up flooding the house and turning it upside down.\\" He continued: \\"Ultimately, the house drifts and ends up in the same neighborhood as the Griffin and Brown homes.\\" The actual crossing over of the event occurs at the end of this episode when Stan gets involved in a stand off with Cleveland Brown of The Cleveland Show and Peter Griffin of Family Guy. In April 2011, executives of the Fox Broadcasting Company officially announced that \\"Hurricane!\\" would air on May 1 as part of the Night of the Hurricane crossover, along with The Cleveland Show episode \\"The Hurricane!\\" and Family Guy episode \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\". However, on April 29, it was announced that the crossover event would be removed from the schedule, in response to a series of tornadoes that killed nearly 300 people in the Southern United States. The crossover was subsequently replaced by reruns of \\"I Am the Walrus\\" from American Dad!, \\"Brian Writes a Bestseller\\" from Family Guy, and \\"Ain't Nothin' But Mutton Bustin'\\" from The Cleveland Show. MacFarlane later agreed with the decisions after being consulted with the executives of Fox, and a spokeswoman for the company later announced that the episode would air the succeeding season. \\"Hurricane!\\" was directed by Tim Parsons, in his first directing credit of the season. This episode marked the first time Parsons has directed an American Dad! episode since the seventh season episode \\"I Am the Walrus\\". It was written by Erik Sommers, which also served as his first writing credit for the season. Sommers' last production credit was the sixth season episode \\"You Debt Your Life\\". In addition to the regular cast, voice actor Mike Henry, actress Lisa Edelstein and voice actress Kristen Schaal guest starred in the episode as Cleveland Brown, Sharri Rothberg, and Roger's One Night Stand respectively. Recurring voice actors Jeff Fischer, Mike Barker, Matt McKenna, and Kevin Michael Richardson reprised their roles of Jeff Fischer, Terry Bates, Buckle, and Principal Brian Lewis respectively. In addition to his American Dad! roles of Stan, Roger, and Greg Corbin, MacFarlane reprised his Family Guy role of Peter Griffin, while Henry guest starred as his role of Cleveland Brown. This episode marked the first time Henry made a guest appearance on American Dad since the season four episode \\"Stan's Night Out\\". Edelstein and McKenna reprised their roles of Shari and Buckle, having last done so in the season seven episode \\"Best Little Horror House in Langley Falls\\". Reception =Ratings= \\"Hurricane!\\" first aired in the United States on October 2, 2011 as part of the animation television night on Fox. It was preceded by episodes of The Simpsons, and its sister shows The Cleveland Show and Family Guy. It was viewed by 5.71 million viewers upon its initial airing, despite simultaneously airing with Desperate Housewives on ABC, The Amazing Race on CBS, and a match between the Baltimore Ravens and the New York Jets on NBC. Total viewership for the episode was the third highest of the animation television block on Fox, having moderately higher ratings than that of The Cleveland Show but lower ratings than that of The Simpsons and Family Guy. \\"Hurricane!\\" garnered a 2.6/6 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, according to Nielsen ratings. Total viewership and ratings were slightly down from the previous episode, \\"Hot Water\\", which was watched by 5.83 million viewers and garnered a 3.0/7 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. =Television reviews= Critics generally praised the episode, with many deeming \\"Hurricane!\\" as the best part of the crossover. Terron Moore of Ology praised the episode, giving it an 8.5 out of ten rating. Points of acclaim went to the humor of the episode, to which Moore opined that it \\"was packed with a lot of funny lines, a lot of ridiculous Stan antics [...], and a pretty funny arc involving Roger and his girlfriend\\". Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club was polarized with the episode. Although she stated that the episode was not bad, Kaiser stated that it \\"didn't quite work\\". Kaiser went on to give the episode a 'B-' grade, scoring higher than the Family Guy episode \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\", but lower than The Simpsons episode \\"Bart Stops to Smell the Roosevelts\\". Another writer felt that the interactions between Stan and Francine were inferior to previous episodes of the series and wrote, \\"It breaks away from Francine and Stan's fun relationship and veers into the more conventional cartoon relationship, where the husband is a buffoon and the wife has to keep him check.\\" See also *Night of the Hurricane *The Cleveland Show: \\"The Hurricane!\\" *Family Guy: \\"Seahorse Seashell Party\\" References External links 2011 American television episodes American Dad!

The album was released onto CD in 1993 and was re-released three more times, in 2000, 2005 and 2009. Musical style Critics have noted how Orgasm anticipated the rise of noise rock, industrial and no wave genres that came into existence in the following decades.Kelly, Jennifer \\"Cromagnon ‚Äì Cave Rock\\" . Dusted Reviews, 29 June 2009. Retrieved 12 April 2011. Alex Henderson of AllMusic described the track \\"Caledonia\\" as sounding \\"like it could be a Ministry or Revolting Cocks recording from 1989 rather than a psychedelic recording from 1969.\\" Another critic, describing the album, said: Legacy Allmusic's Alex Henderson writes of the album: \\"Depending on one's point of view, Cave Rock is either a ridiculously self-indulgent artifact of the '60s counterculture or an underground gem that was way ahead of its time ‚Äì and it's probably a little bit of both.\\" Jennifer Kelly of Dusted Reviews agrees with Henderson, writing \\"There‚Äôs a palpable fog of self-indulgence hanging over the whole enterprise, a sense of weirdness for weirdness‚Äô sake and lack of discipline or structure. Still, there‚Äôs no question that Cromagnon achieved something remarkable in its strange concoction of noise, spoken word, folk, electronics and field recordings.\\" Pitchfork Media ranked the song \\"Caledonia\\" at number 163 on its list of \\"The 200 Greatest Songs of the 1960s\\".

TCC was incorporated as a non-profit organization in 2002 and received charitable status in 2003. The organization was originally established under the name Canadian Thyroid Cancer Support Group (Thry‚Äôvors) Inc. and changed its name to Thyroid Cancer Canada/Cancer de la thyroide Canada in October 2009. As a charitable organization registered with the Canada Revenue Agency, Thyroid Cancer Canada holds an Annual General Meeting (AGM) and elects a Board of Directors each year. Thyroid Cancer Canada is operated entirely by volunteers. TCC has no ongoing financial support from any institution or government program, nor does it receive core funding from any source. All of the funds raised by TCC go directly to supporting patients.  History  Thyroid Cancer Canada was started in 2000 after some Canadian women participating on an American online forum realized their commonality. These women had a few conversations off-line, and those who lived in the Toronto area met a few times over coffee. The first in-person meeting of these thyroid cancer survivors, some of whom became the founders of TCC, was held on May 7, 2000. In the fall of 2001, the TCC founders attended a meeting at a Toronto hospital with others working in the field of thyroid disease, including doctors, representatives from a thyroid foundation and reps from pharmaceutical companies. The main focus of the meeting was to look for ways to offer support to Canadian thyroid cancer patients. After this meeting, the TCC founders who attended decided to meet again and formalize their own group. The first formal meeting of the TCC founders occurred in Kingston, Ontario on January 19, 2002. Some items that were on the agenda for that first meeting have remained priorities. They looked at providing credible information to thyroid cancer patients in the form of printed material and a website. They also set out to offer support and information in various ways such as by telephone, email, online, and through hard copy publications. They discussed advocacy issues and the support of thyroid cancer research. Soon after the meeting the TCC founders started an Online Forum, which was modeled after the American one where they had first met. They also decided on a name for their group. A friend of a group member suggested that they not refer to themselves as ‚Äúsurvivors‚Äù, but rather as ‚Äúthri-vers‚Äù, since they were and still are thriving despite having cancer. They coined the spelling of ‚ÄúThry‚Äôvors‚Äù as a combination of three words ‚Äì thriving, thyroid and survivors. Although the organization has recently changed its name to Thyroid Cancer Canada, TCC will continue to refer to its members as Thry‚Äôvors.History, Thyroid Cancer Canada  Mandate and goals  Thyroid Cancer Canada is working towards creating an environment in which people who are dealing with thyroid cancer, especially the newly diagnosed, are met with support and information. Thyroid Cancer Canada draws on the medical community to provide a consistent and high standard of support for all individuals dealing with the disease. TCC‚Äôs goals and objectives include facilitating communication among thyroid cancer patients, providing credible information about the disease, providing emotional support, and assisting thyroid cancer patients with voicing their needs to health care professionals and those who are responsible for health care policy.

The organization was first established in 1989 by Dawn Leppan and Alan Paton, originally as a program to feed those in poverty and suffering from the effects of HIV/AIDS. After seeing the overwhelming number of people in need, it was concluded that something more would need to be done, thus founding 1000 Hills Community Helpers. The Community is located in KwaZulu-Natal, east of the city of Pietermaritzburg almost to the Indian Ocean just north of the coastal city of Durban. It consists of a health and wellness clinic, children's infirmary, feeding scheme, and education and development facility. The clinic is open five days a week, dedicating different days to the elderly, children, open clinic days, and counseling groups for those who need support. Founder Dawn Leppan was raised by her grandparents who owned a restaurant near the main highway which meandered through the Valley, en route to Durban. She mirrored her grandmother's humanitarianism and founded the 1000 Hills Community Helpers organization. Leppan has won many awards in recognition for her accomplishments, including the Paul Harris Award. Community Clinics The clinic at the centre operates with the help of retired and volunteer doctors and paediatricians as well as nursing sisters. There is a pharmacy run by a retired pharmacist as well as an emergency ward and a 24-hour emergency service run by Dawn.

Story Mukhayriq was a wealthy, well learned and well respected rabbi, and a leader of the Jewish Arab tribe of Tha'labah. Tha'labah was a notable tribe of Jews in Medina, but it is not entirely clear if the tribesmen were not actually Arabs who adopted Judaism. Also left unanswered is a question about Mukhayriq's conversion to Islam. According to Omid Safi, Ibn Ishaq, who wrote the biography of the prophet, was \\"perhaps deliberately ambiguous on the question whether Mukhayriq formally became Muslim, or whether he was a righteous Jew who had affection for Mohamed.\\" According to Norman A. Stillman, Ibn Ishaq says about Mukhayriq: \\"He recognized the Apostle of Allah ‚Äî may Allah bless him and grant him peace ‚Äî by his description and by what he found in his scholarship. However, he was accustomed to his own religion, and this held him back, until the Battle of Uhud (625) which fell upon the Sabbath.\\" The Battle of Uhud was fought between a force from the Muslim community of Medina, led by the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and a force led by Abu Sufyan ibn Harb from Mecca on March 19, 625. This day happened to be Saturday, the seventh day of the Jewish week and a very important day of rest in Judaism that Jews call Shabbat. In spite of the required observance of Shabbat, Mukhayriq decided he had to fight together with Muhammad. He then asked his tribesmen to join the battle too. Some agreed, but others reminded the rabbi about the Sabbath. To that, Mukhayriq answered, \\"You have no Sabbath,\\" and severely censured his tribesmen for not understanding the hidden meaning of the Sabbath. He commanded that, if he were killed in the battle, all his wealth including date palms should go to Muhammad. Mukhayriq was killed in the battle. As Dr. Muqtedar Khan puts it, Rabbi Mukhayriq became \\"the first Jewish martyr of Islam.\\" When a severely wounded Muhammad was told about the heroic death of Mukhayriq, Muhammad said: \\"He was the best of Jews.\\" The seven gardens and the other wealth Muhammad inherited from the rabbi were used for the establishment of Waqf, the first ever \\"charitable endowment of Islam.\\" Aftermath In 622 Muhammad and the different tribes that lived in Medina, including Jews of Tha'labah, signed the Constitution of Medina. In accordance with this constitution, all tribes living in Medina entered one nation Ummah and were obligated to help each other, to fight their enemies and each to bear their own expenses. Two Jewish tribes that were allied with Mecca in the Battle of Uhud were expelled from Medina soon after the battle. Two years later, after another battle, the men from the Jewish tribe of Qurayzah were executed. Opinions Dr. Muqtedar Khan calls the story of Rabbi Mukhayriq's sacrifice \\"fantastic\\". Dr. Khan believes that if this story about a Jew who was \\"a true Islamic hero\\" would have been told more often, \\"it would contribute to manifestations of increased tolerance by Muslims toward others.\\" Dr. Khan continues: \\"There are many such wonderful examples of brotherhood, tolerance, sacrifice and good citizenship in Islamic traditions that undergird the backbone of Islamic ethics.\\" References Muhammad and Judaism ","title":"Mukhayriq"},{"id":"31474254","text":"thumb The spil√•pipa (or spelpipa, sp√§lapipa, l√•tapipa) is a type of fipple flute traditional in Sweden. It is traditionally from the pastoral/transhumant cultures of that country, though more widespread in the modern era. It is originally most common in the transhumant areas, generally north of Svealand. During the 1900s, √Ñlvdalen was a centre of conservation of spil√•pipa music, and accordingly that area's name for the instrument has become the most widespread. A significant variation of the instrument is the h√§rjedalspipa, but it has many variants. The instrument has experienced a revival in recent decades as modern folk musicians have become curious about traditional instruments. Construction The spil√•pipa is a fipple flute, in which a narrow gap is blow into which directs the airstream onto a blade in the frame which produces the sound. The instrument has eight finger-holes on the top, but no thumb-holes. It has a modal tuning, which is not necessarily compatible with much of modern Western music. The player is easily able to affect the intonation.  Notable players  An important spil√•pipare (player) was Sv√§s Anders Ersson (1872-1968) from Evertsberg in √Ñlvdalen, Dalarna. In modern times, players include Anders Ros√©n (Malung), Pelle Jakobsson, Hars √Öke Hermansson (Malung) and Ulrika Bod√©n.

Location and features The Bundara River rises east of Mount Hotham and Mount Loch in the Australian Alps in the Alpine National Park at an elevation of , and flows into the Big River about north of Anglers Rest. The river flows generally to the east, travelling through the national park for most of its course. About north of Anglers Rest the Omeo Highway crosses over the river, and about north of this crossing it reaches its confluence into the Big River at an elevation of . The Big River forms its confluences with the Cobungra River just south of this point to form the Mitta Mitta River. The river descends over its course. =Tributaries= Key tributaries of the Bundara River include High Plains Creek, Waterfall Creek, and Tea Tree Creek. The main tributaries flow off the southern slopes of Mount Jim (), Mount Bundara () and Mount Cope (), and the hills to the east of the main ridge of the Australian Alps. =River health= The Bundara River and its tributaries are generally protected within the Alpine National Park. Most of the waterways in the Mitta Mitta basin are recognised as being in good to excellent condition. Extensive forest covers much of the catchment area. Despite some land clearing and livestock damage to river banks, the aquatic habitat is generally very good. The Bundara River is noted as being particularly good for brown trout fishing. The Bundara River is part of the North East Catchment Management Authority's Victorian River Health Program, aimed at achieving healthy rivers. In early 2003, large areas of forest around the Bundara River and its catchments were severely impacted by the massive Eastern Victorian alpine bushfires. These fires burnt through approximately of the area's bushland for close to two months. The damage resulting from the fires impacted river health for some time after the fires.

In September 2013, the company announced plans to raise $400 million in an IPO. The company announced it would list on the NASDAQ under the ticker symbol EIGI. It went public in October 2013 raising $252 million selling shares to the public at $12 each. This was below the company's target goal of $400 million. In a 2015 investor earnings conference call, the company reported having 4.2 million worldwide customers. This path to increased size is similar to the path networking company Verio followed in the 1990s, using free cash flow and access to capital markets in acquiring assets to add to their corporate portfolio. The concept was to roll up small ISPs into one large national ISP and achieve economies of scale. Endurance is acquiring hosting companies domestically and internationally.

In August 2015, EIG announced the acquisition of Site5 and Verio Web Hosting from NTT. It is estimated that EIG gained 86,000+ new subscribers through these acquisitions. In November 2015, the company acquired Constant Contact, and days later laid off 15% of their workforce. Also in November 2015, EIG acquired the assets of Ecommerce, LLC for $28 million. This acquisition included a total of 72,000 subscribers from three different hosting brands: IX Web Hosting, Cloud by IX, and Host Excellence.

She is a practicing Roman Catholic and was baptized in Richardson, Texas. Her mother was an elementary school teacher, and her father is an engineer turned entrepreneur, the owner of a small lawn-care company. Carter excelled academically in school; her parents told her she would have to work her way through college. She graduated in 1996 from Plano East Senior High School and earned a full scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin, where she graduated with highest honors with a Bachelor of Arts in Government and a Bachelor of Science in Journalism. During Carter's undergraduate years at UT she interned at the White House during the Clinton administration. After UT, Carter graduated with a Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School. She also obtained a master's degree in Public Policy from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. During Carter's years at Harvard, she became a Republican and contributed articles to USA Today. After law school, she returned to Dallas and served Collin County as an assistant district attorney. Political career Carter decided to run for office in the 102nd House District in Texas, taking on Democrat Carol Kent. Carter won by simply pointing to Kent's record as being far too liberal for her area of Dallas and that voters in the district were far more conservative than the person who was representing them. Carter won in 2010 with 54.63 percent of the vote, having unseated Kent by a ten-point margin of victory. Carter was named the 32nd most conservative member of the legislature, but she crossed party lines at times to support bills regarding public education. Carter and Ted Cruz, then the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate from Texas, gave commentary at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Dallas Morning News called Carter \\"a posterwoman for GOP outreach to minority candidates and voters.\\" In November 29, 2016, Carter was named as a Transition Landing Team member for the newly elected President Donald Trump in the Department of Justice. Election of 2014 Carter had announced on July 9, 2013 that she would be a candidate for the Texas Railroad Commission in the Place 1 seat vacated by the outgoing incumbent, Barry Smitherman, who ran instead for Texas Attorney General in 2014 to replace the three-term incumbent, Greg Abbott, the 2014 gubernatorial nominee who seeks to succeed the retiring Governor Rick Perry. However, on October 22, 2013, Carter announced that she was ending her bid for the Railroad Commission and would instead seek reelection to a third two-year term to her state House seat. In the March 4, 2014 Republican primary for House District 102, Carter trailed her conservative challenger, Linda Koop, a former member of the Dallas City Council, by 163 votes. Koop led with 3,646 votes (34.7 percent) to Carter's 3,483 (33.2 percent). Two other candidates held another 32 percent of the ballots cast. In the May 27 runoff election, Koop unseated Carter, 5,072 (59.8 percent) to 3,405 (40.2 percent). In the November 4 general election, Koop then defeated the Democrat, George M.

Founded in 1988, it opened for operations in 1993; it encompasses an area of , with the objective of conservation of wildlife. The community project is managed by a Trust titled the \\"Kalahari Conservation Society\\", which has members drawn from the four villages of Nata, Sepako, Maposa and Manxotae in the vicinity of the sanctuary. The prominent wildlife species in the sanctuary are reported to number 165 bird species. The sanctuary is of international importance due to its population of 250,000 lesser flamingo (Phoenicopterus minor) and greater flamingos (Phoenicopterus roseus), which visit the sanctuary every year during the winter period to breed, after the rainy season, when the water sources are full. The community- initiated sanctuary received the coveted \\"Tourism for Tomorrow\\" award for the Southern Hemisphere in the first year it opened, in 1993. Geography The Nata sanctuary is situated at the mouth of the Nata River delta, about from the Nata village at the northeastern border of the Sua Pan (salt pan) within the larger Makgadikgadi. The Makgadikgadi Pans Landscape, located in the Central Kalahari Game Reserve to the southeast of the Okavango Delta, is the most important of natural habitats. It covers wild life conservation parks such as the Makgadikgadi National Park and the Nxai Pan National Park, apart from the Nata Bird Sanctuary, which is \\"one of the largest breeding sites of Lesser and Greater flamingo in the world.\\" This region was inhabited by the Nata, Sepako, Maposa and Manxotae communities, who grazed their 3500 and odd cattle in the area. The villagers were persuaded to move their cattle so that a securely fenced sanctuary could be established covering an area of ; 45% of the sanctuary lies in the Sua Pan. A raised wooden platform within the sanctuary provides vistas of the Sua salt pan and the rich bird life of the sanctuary. The roads within the sanctuary are now well maintained. Some areas of the park, where black \\"cotton\\" soils are found, can pose problems for road transport during the rainy season. History The Nata Conservation Committee began planning in 1988 to establish a bird sanctuary in the delta of the Nata River, to conserve and preserve the wild life, particularly the bird species. These dominate the Sua Pan at the mouth of the Nata River; it is an ephemeral stream bordering the Sua Pan. The Kalahari Conservation Society, with funds contributed by national and international organisations, is credited with ensuring voluntary participation of the local people. The local people not only relocated their cattle of about 3,500 heads to adjacent land but also built a network of dirt roads. Nata Bird Sanctuary, now one of the three breeding grounds of flamingos in Africa, is the largest. It has been recognized by UNESCO as one of the ‚Äúlargest breeding sites of lesser and greater flamingo in the world‚Äù and a site of international importance. Fauna African fish eagle Among the wild life species noted in the sanctuary are 165 bird species. Other species of wild life are also reported, though of limited numbers. =Avifauna= Great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) The bird sanctuary has about 165 species of birds; the lesser and greater flamingos, great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus) and pink-backed pelican (Pelecanus rufescens) are the most dominant species, they arrive annually in large numbers as part of their migration during the winter season. Some of the other notable bird species recorded are: avocet, blackwinged stilt (Himantopus himantopus), blacksmith lapwing (Vanellus armatus), black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis), bustards, carmine, darters, African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer), geese, korhaans, pied kingfisher (Ceryle rudis), black- chested snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), blue-cheeked bee-eater (Merops persicus), Cape teal (Anas capensis), kori bustard (Ardeotis kori), Hottentot teal (Anas hottentota), martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus), red-knobbed coot, (Fulica cristata), secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), spoonbills, and white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata). The birds migrate from Etosha, in the border state of Namibia. Greater flamingos feed on brine shrimps (Artemia), worms and tiny crustaceans, while the lesser flamingos feed on algae; all are plentiful in the warm shallow waters of salt pans. =Other fauna= Other wildlife faunal species reported are: the antelope, hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), kudu (Tragelaphus imberbis), reedbuck (Redunca arundinum), springbok, steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), springhare (Pedetes capensis), jackals, foxes, monkeys, squirrels, eland (Taurotragus oryx), gemsbok (Oryx gazella) and zebra.

The inaugural event was held at the 2011 FIRST Championship in St. Louis, Missouri. History The possibility of a college-level FIRST competition has been discussed for many years. At the 2010 FIRST Championship in Atlanta, Georgia, a group of college students and faculty were invited to a discussion in which FIRST Founders Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers and Editor-in-chief of Wired Magazine Chris Anderson proposed the idea of a college-level FIRST program. Chris Anderson suggested the inclusion of aerial robots in the college level program and demonstrated a robotic quadcopter (a Parrot AR.Drone) and an RC blimp. As a result of the meeting, a planning committee was formed to design and promote a college-level program, chaired by Dr. Karina J. Powell and Dr. Christopher L. Jones. In December 2010, a kickoff video was released giving an overview of the program. Further documents and team updates have established and clarified the demonstration competition and game rules. The possibility of having a full college-level FIRST competition is still being discussed. Games =2011= There are two games played on fields equivalent to the FRC standard size (54 feet by 27 feet). For both games there were two competing alliances, each with two teams each composed of one air vehicle and one ground vehicle. The first game, All Your Base, involves a 3 by 3 grid of 4'6\\" tall rectangular bases. Ground robots capture bases by shooting projectiles (tennis balls) through openings on one or two sides of the base. Aerial robots capture bases by picking up a virtual payload from their starting location and then landing on top of the base. Teams score bonus points by capturing three bases in a row. The second game is The Best Trajectory. Ground robots score points by shooting projectiles across a large trapezoidal barrier placed at midfield into mobile goals on the other side. Aerial robots can retrieve foam cube \\"payloads\\" from the top of the barrier and drop them into the goals to multiply the score of that goal. Drivers will not be able to see past the barrier. Teams may use their aerial robots to relay targeting data from the other side of the barrier. This game was never played at the 2011 demonstration in order to maintain the learning curve for teams playing All Your Base, as the result of a collective team and planning committee decision.

The pipeline and the Haifa refineries were considered strategically important by the British Government, and indeed provided much of the fuel needs of the British and American forces in the Mediterranean during World War II. The pipeline was a target of attacks by Arab gangs during the 1936‚Äì1939 Arab revolt in Palestine, and as a result one of the main objectives of a joint British- Jewish Special Night Squads commanded by Captain Orde Wingate was to protect the pipeline against such attacks. Later on, the pipeline was the target of attacks by the Jewish Irgun paramilitary organisation.

In his youth, he was a keen footballer who played for Oxford University in the 1873 FA Cup Final and for England in 1871 in a representative match against Scotland. Family and education Paton was born in Hanover Terrace in the Regent's Park area of Westminster, London, the youngest son of George Paton, a barrister, and Laura Coore. He was educated at Harrow School before going up to University College, Oxford in 1872. He graduated with a BA in 1876 and was awarded his MA in 1879. Paton was married to Adeline Loftus, the daughter of Capt. Arthur John Loftus and Lady Catherine Loftus, who was the daughter of John Loftus, 2nd Marquess of Ely. His wife was a lady-in-waiting to Queen Victoria from 1889 to 1892. His brother, Frederick Lechmere Paton, was married to Frederica Chenevix Trench, daughter of Maj.-Gen. Frederick Chenevix Trench and granddaughter of Richard Chenevix Trench (1807‚Äì1886), Archbishop of Dublin. Football career Paton first made his mark as a footballer during his years at Harrow, becoming team captain. He was still at school, aged only 17 years 214 days, when he was selected to play as a forward for the English XI in a representative match against a Scottish XI on 19 November 1870. In Charles Alcock's Football Annual, Paton was summed up as \\"a strong and persevering forward [who] keeps side (the wing) well\\". Later in his career, he was described as \\"a very pretty dribbler but disinclined to pass the ball; can play extremely well when he likes\\". In February 1873, he scored one of the goals in a 4‚Äì0 victory over Maidenhead in the Fourth round of the FA Cup, as a result of which Oxford University reached the FA Cup Final at the first attempt. In the final, the University played the Wanderers who were defending champions and had been given a \\"bye\\" direct to the final. Despite having several key players absent, the cup-holders were victorious by a 2‚Äì0 margin. Paton again scored for the University in a 4‚Äì0 victory in the First round of the following season's cup tournament, this time against Upton Park although he was not part of the team that won that year's final. He was also a member of the Wanderers club, as well as Old Harrovians and their sister club Harrow Chequers. Legal career On leaving university, Paton qualified as a barrister, becoming a student of the Inner Temple on 21 June 1876 and was called to the Bar on 25 June 1879. He then practised on the Western Circuit until he retired in 1916.

John Paterson, founder of the Eastern Province Herald (1822-1880)  John Paterson was born in March 1822 in Aberdeen, Scotland, the son of a vintner/farmer/stone-mason, John Paterson Snr. and his wife Barbara. When John was six years old his father died as a result of an accident in a stone quarry. After John Snr's death, Barbara undertook to educate the boy but in 1832 she was persuaded to send him to Aberdeen Grammar School which he attended until 1836. While there he studied mathematics under Dr James Gordon of the Mathematical Public School of Aberdeen. One Titan at a Time by Pamela FFolliott and E L H Croft, Howard Timmins, Cape Town, 1960. In November 1836, he went to Marischal College, applied for a bursary and won one which saw him through the next four years of his University training. In his first year there he came third in Greek. The following year he studied Natural Philosophy, Higher Greek and Latin. During his third year he came second in Mathematics. On October 6, 1840, he was awarded his M.A. When Professor James Rose-Innes returned home to Aberdeen from the Cape Colony to recruit teachers for the senior government schools planned by Sir George Napier and Sir John Herschel. The founding of the Eastern Province Herald The paper was founded by Scottish immigrant John Paterson (Cape politician - Jock Paterson) on May 7, 1845. In 1841 Paterson was contracted by the Cape Government to become a teacher at the free school in Port Elizabeth. His contract forbade him to hold two jobs so he registered the newspaper in the name of his partner, John Ross Phillip. After an argument with Ross regarding the printing of the newspaper, Paterson temporarily ceased publication of the Eastern Province Herald but after a few months, he resumed publication. In 1857 he sold the Eastern Province Herald to his friend Robert Godlonton, owner of the Grahamstown Journal. Philip opened the competing Port Elizabeth Mercury newspaper shortly after the split with Paterson. In the mid-1870s the Cape Colony underwent a massive economic and social growth, and the paper finally became a daily paper in 1878, as well as a full printing company.

Kumamoto Prefecture is the eastern half of Hinokuni (meaning \\"land of fire\\"), and corresponds to what was once called Higo Province. Exceptions are the part of Kuma District, which had once been part of Sagara Domain, and Nagashima which was included in Kagoshima Prefecture. Mount Aso and Aso Caldera from Daikanbou Kumamoto Prefecture is roughly divided into three areas, namely, the northern area with Kikuchi River, Shirakawa River and Mount Aso Area; the Kumagawa Area including the Hitoyoshi Basin and the Amakusa Island Area. The first one is the Kumamoto han, and the second the Hitoyoshi han and the third one is the Amakusa Area, once controlled by the Tokugawa shogunate. The history of Kumamoto is characterized by kofuns in natural beauties or volcanic activities, the ritsury≈ç and the following rise of samurais, the arrival of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa from Nagoya, wars around the Bakumatsu including the Satsuma Rebellion, and public problems concerning Minamata disease. After the establishment of the Yamato Government or Yamato Ouken, the history of Kumamoto has been constantly under the influence of the Central Government. Prehistoric Kumamoto About one-third of the archaeological sites of the Lower Paleolithic age in Japan were found in Kumamoto Prefecture. A few of these have been excavated. Mainly these were in the outer Aso mountain areas and Kuma district. The oldest one is the Ishinomoto Site in Hirayama machi in Kumamoto City; dating back more than 30,000 years ago by the radiocarbon dating method. A large number of artifacts or stone tools such as stone axes and knives were excavated, suggesting that Ky≈´sh≈´ was inhabited by a number of hunter-gatherer societies. At the same time, Ky≈´sh≈´ experienced volcanic activity at Mount Aso, Aira Caldera in Kagoshima Prefecture and Kikai Caldera. There were four large series of Mount Aso volcanic eruptions, with structural changes. The last one was about 90,000 years ago. The lava produced stone materials that would later be used for bridge construction in the Prefecture. J≈çmon period and Yayoi period =J≈çmon period= There is little evidence of human activity in the early part of the J≈çmon period in the Kumamoto Prefecture, because of volcanic activity about 7300 years ago by the Kikai Caldera in Kagoshima Prefecture. The Goryo midden and Kurohashi midden date to the middle age of the J≈çmon period. Later, 13 middens in Kumamoto were situated at the height of 5 meters above sea level. In Souhata midden, stored acorns were found. Fish hooks made of stone were found in Amakusa. A peculiar style of earthenware called kokushokukenmadoki was developed according to the development of living styles. Burned rice corns and barley corns were found in a dugout (shelter) dwelling in Uenobaru midden in Kumamoto City.The History of Kumamoto City 770 Archaeological sites were found in the J≈çmon period in Kumamoto Prefecture, including Kannabe midden, Kumamoto in which Dog≈´s and ground stones were found. =Yayoi period= In the Yayoi period, there appeared dwellings in ring-formed groups in which onggis, tsubo jars, and stone axes were found. Dwellings rose into higher places, moving from the seashores. Cultivation and agriculture started in the Yayoi period, because the Kumamoto plane started to rise because of stream sediments from the rivers. Cultivation of rice started, while there were shell heaps along the seashore. Salt was produced by burning sea weeds; which has been verified by the presence of burned small seashells. In later years, there were middens with ironware along the Kurokawa river, Shirakawa river, and Kikuchigawa River and in the Futagozuka midden in Kumamoto City, suggesting the production of ironware there. In the Yayoi period, there were 740 middens in Kumamoto Prefecture, comprising 13% of middens in Japan. In the Tokuo midden and the Kogabaru midden, bronze mirrors were excavated. Land of Fire Expanding Yamato Ouken(red) around the 7th century;Kumamoto Prefecture is in southern Ky≈´sh≈´ In the Nihon Shoki, Japan's earliest official document, the early countries of Yamato Ouken, Wa (Japan), appointed a king of a small area which came under the Yamato Ouken, a head of Agata Nushi (an agata was an autonomous district under leadership of a chieftain or warlord). Yamato Ouken is considered to be the forerunner of the Japan's Imperial House of Japan existing in the Nara area or somewhere and started in the 3rd century. In the same document and in the Chikushi-koku- fudoki, there were three Agatas or Districts in the present Kumamoto Prefecture: Kuma agata, corresponding to Kuma Area; Asonken, corresponding to the Mount Aso area; and Yatsushiro area, which is considered to have been larger than today. There are about 1,300 Kofuns in Kumamoto Prefecture, and comprise 24% of kofuns in the country. Near the Uto Peninsula area are about 120 large kofuns, or megalithic tombs or tumuli, constructed between the early 3rd century and early 7th century. In Kumamoto Prefecture, there are a concentrated distribution of decorated kofuns, in which various patterns were drawn, for instance, breasts of a woman in Chibusan kofun in Yamaga city. In another kofun in Uto city, the burial of a woman in her thirties was confirmed, suggesting the presence of miko, a \\"female shaman, spirit medium\\" who conveyed oracles from kami. A sword in a kofun named Etafunayama kofun had Chinese characters describing Emperor Y≈´ryaku. Because of this, historian Wakatakeru has suggested that this area was under the control of Yamato Ouken. One of the g≈çzokus was named Takebe-no-Kimi, a family of samurai nature, who was given such a name by Yamato Ouken, and who was assumed to live near Kokai- HonmachiÔºõin those days, near Takebe. Etafunayma Kofun A group of kofuns at Nozu are considered to be the site of Hinokimi or the King of fire or possibly King of the Hi River. Hinokimi was considered to be a descendant of one who answered to Emperor Keik≈ç. In the mythological period, Emperor Keik≈ç in his journey for expanding the Yamato Ouken, saw unexplainable spots of moving fire, Shiranui, (In Japanese, literally \\"unknown fire\\") in the Ariake Sea, and a Gozoku in that land replied that he did not know the fire. Today, it can be seen only on one day or so, and it is an optical phenomenon on the horizon of seeing moving spots of fire caused by fishing boats through heated air layers. See also Shiranui (optical phenomenon). In 527AD, the Iwai Rebellion in Fukuoka Prefecture was quelled by the Yamato court. The rebellion was named after its leader, Iwai, who is believed by historians to have been a powerful governor of Tsukushi. The rebellion was quelled by the Yamato court, and played an important part in the consolidation of early Japan. The eruption of Mount Aso was described in the Book of Sui, probably through the influence of Yamato Ouken. History of Aso Faith by Aso Sogen Saisei Kyogikai =Explanation of Yamato ≈åken= There are various Japanese names for a political/governmental organization present starting in the third century of kofun period in Kinki area of Japan, composed of several powerful families, with ≈å (king) or ≈åkimi (great king) as its center. These names include Yamato Ch≈çtei (Court), Yamato ≈åken, Wa ≈åken, and Yamato Seiken. At the same time, there are views that the presence of smaller regional states should be respected. At the present time, Yamato Ch≈çtei (Yamato Court) is employed in the textbooks censored by the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. There is a view that Ch≈çtei (Court) should not be used before the 4th and 5th century. At the present time, Yamato ≈åken is tentatively used here. Higo and the Ritsuryo system The name Higo first appeared in the Nihon Shoki, the official history of Japan, in its description of a soldier who returned from the Tang empire in 696 AD after 33 years of captivity after the Battle of Baekgang; he was Mibu no Moroishi of Kohshi gun of Higo Province. In the same book, the construction of Kukuchi castle in preparation of a possible attack, was described in 696. This castle is considered to be a storage place.Why was Kukuchi Castle built ? Kikukamachi Kankyo Kyokai Under the ritsury≈ç system of Japan, a branch of the central government called Kokufu was placed in areas under the influence of the central government. In Kumamoto Prefecture, the Kokufu was placed in Mashiki, according to the Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç, and in other places according to other books. As the name of a place, Kokubu was in Kumamoto city, and there was a building in the 9th century; which was found destroyed in a flood. As a government post, Higonokami Michinokimi Obina was recorded; he was born in 663, and he assumed the post of the head of Higo Province. He was also a poet and his name was in Kaif≈´s≈ç. As the heads of Higo Province, there were Ki Natsui, Fujiwaha Yasumasa and Kiyohara no Motosuke; the last one was a nobleman, waka poet, and the father of Sei Sh≈çnagon who wrote The Pillow Book. Unlike other governors, Kiyohara went to Kumamoto. The ritsury≈ç system was introduced in the Asuka period, and silk was transferred to the capital for taxation. This was confirmed in the Wamy≈ç Ruijush≈ç and in the Shoku Nihongi. Fish and rice were also items for taxation and Higo was a big country in this respect. Division of land by roads was started and a transportation infrastructure, with stations, was prepared. Kokai Station was found within the campus of Kumamoto University.Kokai Station is within the campus of Kumamoto University,as described in the Home Page of Kumamoto University. White turtles In 768, a white turtle was presented to Yamato Ouken from Ashikita, and in 771, two white turtles were presented from Ashikita, and Mashiki, both from Kumamoto coinciding with the enthronement of Emperor K≈çnin, and the death of Empress K≈çken, and the title of the years was changed from Jingokeiun to H≈çki, meaning a precious turtle. D≈çky≈ç, the lover of Empress K≈çken lost power. At the same time, those under the influence of Fujiwara clan gained power among Kumamoto people over those under the influence of Ohtomo family. The rise of the Samurai In the latter part of the Heian period, groups of samurai gained power. This was also so in the land of Higo, though unification was not achieved until the 16th century. Well known groups of samurai included the Kikuchi clan, Aso clan, Kihara of the Midorigawa area, Moroshima of Amakusa, Sagara clan of Hitoyoshi, and Kumabe ; some of them fought in the Toi invasion of 1019. =Kikuchi Clan= The Kikuchi clan started with Fujiwara Noritaka, grandson of Fujiwara no Takaie, who fought in the Toi invasion. However, at present, there are several views concerning its origin; 1) Local G≈çzoku who worked at Dazaifu, Fukuoka Prefecture, 2) A descendant of Kishitsu Fukunobu from Korea, 3) A descendant of the Kukuchi family, 4) A descendant from the Minamoto clan. The Kikuchi clan enjoyed a powerful presence in the Kikuchi area, belonging to the group in the center of Japan by maintaining their land in the sh≈çen system. In the days when the Taira clan was in power, the Kikuchi clan approached the Taira clan, but then the Minamoto clan came to power, the Kikuchi favored the Minamoto. In the Kamakura period, the Kikuchi clan fought successfully against the enemy at Fukuoka during the Mongol invasions of Japan. Kikuchi Taketoki (1292‚Äì1333) was the 12th head of the Kikuchi Clan. Emperor Go-Daigo asked Taketoki for help. He was Go-Daigo's first man and was awarded for this. Taketoki gathered many people in Ky≈´sh≈´ and planned to attack Chinzei Tandai's H≈çj≈ç Hidetoki (Akahashi Hidetoki), but the plan was discovered and the Hojo attacked first. Taketoki and his son Yoritaka died in this attack. However, the Kikuchi clan remained powerful in this area. Kikuchi Taketoki =Aso Clan= The Aso clan started with Kannushi worshiping the kami of Mount Aso area and later became the head of the Agata by presenting their land to the Yamato Ouken and later to the group in power as an organized manor (sh≈çen). They became a powerful group of samurai, and they named themselves a Dai-guji, or great Kannushi and the top of g≈çzokus or samurai combined. It is said that Aso Shrine was the earliest shrine in Higo Province and included lower shrines such as Kengun Shrine in Kumamoto, Kosa Shrine, and Kouriura Shrine which extended the area of influence. The formation of Samurai groups =Legend of Minamoto no Tametomo= In the latter half of the Heian period, samurai had waged wars in almost all areas of Japan, and Shirakawa Jokyo in cloistered rule started to control kokushis; the situation became very complex. In Ky≈´sh≈´, Minamoto no Tametomo, a hero from Kyoto, was the subject of a number of legends. The legend of Minamoto no Tamotomo was interpreted as the uprising of groups of samurai in rural or peripheral areas of Japan against the previously authoritative groups of samurai. When Taira no Kiyomori had power, smaller groups of samurai had to choose either to side with the Heike clan or resist. The Rebellion of Chinzei was recorded in the Azuma Kagami, The Tale of the Heike, Genpei J≈çsuiki, and it coincided with the uprising of Minamoto no Yoritomo. Defeated, their groups were incorporated within the Heike clan. Kamakura Shogunate and Mongol invasions of Japan The Kamakura period covers 1185 to 1333. Samurais in east Japan occupied the post of Soujitou, and the Kikuchi clan sided with Gotoba-joko, and lost to some extent. In 1268 and 1271, the Kamakura shogunate rejected the proposal of envoys from Mongol for peace. It ordered all those who held fiefs in Ky≈´sh≈´ to resist any Mongol Invasions. Fortunately Takezaki Suenaga left vivid pictures concerning the Mongol invasions of Japan. =Takezaki Suenaga= Mongol Invasion Illustrated showing Takezaki Suenaga (right) Takezaki Suenaga (1246‚Äì1314) was a retainer of Higo Province who fought in both campaigns against the Mongols. Suenaga commissioned the M≈çko Sh≈´rai Ekotoba, a pictorial scroll showing his own valor in war, composed in 1293. During the Mongol invasion of 1274. Suenaga fought at Fukuoka under Muto Kagesuke. Suenaga sold his horses and saddles in order to finance a trip to Kamakura, where he reported his deeds in battle to the shogunate. In order to receive rewards for valorous deeds from the bakufu, it was necessary for the deeds to be witnessed by others and reported directly. By his own account in the scrolls, Suenaga says, \\"Other than advancing and having my deeds known, I have nothing else to live for\\", showing that, first, he wanted to advance in terms of measurable money and rank, and that, just as importantly, he sought fame and recognition. Muromachi period The Muromachi period is subdivided into the Nanboku-ch≈ç period and the Sengoku period. =Nanboku-ch≈ç period= Nanboku-ch≈ç period is between 1336 and 1392. Emperor Go-Daigo started to overthrow the shogunate H≈çj≈ç Takatoki and the order to join in the revolt was given by Prince Kanenaga (or Prince Kaneyoshi) to various samurai groups in Ky≈´sh≈´. Kikuchi Taketoki was killed in a battle in Fukuoka. The Kikuchi and Aso clans sided with the Southern Court in Kyoto. Later, the Northern Court won over the Southern Court. In order to strengthen the Kikuchi clan, Kikuchi Takeshige was made Yoriaishu Naidan no Koto in 1338, meaning the rules of decision within the Kikuchi clan were made with blood signature. This was translated into the Kikuchi Constitution, the oldest blood signature, and this was stored in the Kikuchi Shrine. =Muromachi period= Shibukawa Mitsuyori assumed the Ky≈´sh≈´ branch of central government, Ky≈´sh≈´ Tandai, the military branch of the Ashikaga shogunate. The Kikuchi clan initially resisted, however, it approached the Ashikaga shogunate later. The Kikuchi clan started to trade with Korea and gained some strength. In 1481, a large meeting for \\"10,000 Renga\\" (collaborative poetry) was held in Kikuchi, the land of the Kikuchi clan, thus showing high standards of culture was there. Later the Kikuchi clan declined. Sagara families fought within their own families in Hitoyoshi area, but stayed there because the Hitoyoshi area is encircled by mountains. Aso families staged conflicts within their families in the Aso area. =Sengoku period= The Sengoku period is roughly between 1467 and 1572. The Kikuchi clan declined, and Higo Province became the land of Field Mowing, meaning that the strong could take the land of the weaker. Azuchi-Momoyama period Azuchi‚ÄìMomoyama period was from 1573 to 1603. It was followed by the Edo period. =Sassa Narimasa= Sassa Narimasa In 1587, Toyotomi Hideyoshi started to invade Ky≈´sh≈´ in his war to unify Japan and reached Kumamoto on April 16. He gave letters of reassurance of the possession of land to 52 persons in Kumamoto, and gave Sassa Narimasa the Province of Higo. Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered that the measurements of land should not be examined in the following three years. However, Sassa Narimasa could not observe the order and conflict started; Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered the groups of samurai in Higo be destroyed. Sassa Narimasa was responsible for this conflict and he was ordered to commit seppuku. On the following day, Toyotomi Hideyoshi gave the northern half of Higo Province to Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and the southern half to Konishi Yukinaga. Sagara clan in Hitoyoshi lost Yatsushiro and Ashikita, but finally the possession of Hitoyoshi was reassured. Five groups of samurai in Amakusa resisted Konishi Yukinaga, but were finally defeated. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa Kat≈ç Kiyomasa Kumamoto Castle photographed in the 1870s The decisive Battle of Sekigahara (October 21, 1600) cleared the path to the Shogunate for Tokugawa Ieyasu. In Ky≈´sh≈´, Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, and other samurai lords such as Kuroda, Nabeshima, Hosokawa took the side of Tokugawa Ieyasu; while Konishi Yukinawa, Shimazu, ≈åtomo, Tachibana acted on behalf of Toyotomi Hideyoshi. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa attacked Uto Castle, and he won the battle when the news of the defeat of Ishida and the capital punishment and defeat of Konishi Yukinaga reached Uto. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa was given the province of Higo with the exception of Hitoyoshi and Amakusa. His rice income reached 540,000 koku (bales of rice) and he was asked to add his followers, and accepted the previous samurai belonging to Konishi Yukinaga and Tachibana. He started to strengthen Kumamoto Castle and completed it in 1607. Kiyomasa was one of the three senior commanders during the Seven-Year War (1592‚Äì1598) against the Korean dynasty of Joseon. Together with Konishi Yukinaga, he captured Seoul, Busan and many other crucial cities. He defeated the last Korean regulars in the Battle of Imjin River and pacified Hamgyong. Some Korean artisans were taken to Kumamoto by Kiyomasa. A town named Ulsan (Urusan) is in Kumamoto now. Kato shrine is a shrine in Kumamoto Castle, Kumamoto, in which Kat≈ç Kiyomasa, ≈åki Kaneyoshi and Kin Kan, a Korean who followed Kat≈ç, are enshrined. Kiyomasa was an excellent architect of castles and fortification. During the Imjin war, he built several Japanese style castles in Korea to better defend the conquered lands. Ulsan castle was one of these fortresses that Kiyomasa built, and it proved its worth when Korean-Chinese allied forces attacked it with far superior force, yet the outnumbered Japanese successfully defended the castle until the Japanese reinforcements arrived. After the meeting of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Toyotomi Hideyori, he became ill on a ship on his way to Kumamoto, and died shortly after arrival in 1611. His child, Kat≈ç Tadahiro, was transferred to Dewa Maruoka-han in the T≈çhoku region in 1632, for fear of his becoming too powerful and thus the Kato clan came to an end. Hosokawa Clan Hosokawa Tadatoshi of the Hosokawa clan entered Higo Province in 1632; he declared that he respected Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. Retired Hosokawa Tadaoki entered Yatsushiro castle. Hosokawa Tadatoshi introduced the system of tenaga, which was larger than a village; this system had been observed in his previous Han. The top of a tenaga was originally by heritage, but later the head of a tenaga was appointed from above. It was a bureaucracy, but a more suitable system than heritage alone. Christianity =Catholic culture and Amakusa= The first Japanese Embassy to Europe, who brought a printing machine to Amakusa in 1586. Top, from left to right: Juli√£o Nakaura, Father Mesquita, Mancio Ito. Bottom, from left to right: Martin√£o Hara, Miguel Chijiwa. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa was an earnest Nichiren sect Buddhist, and did not like Christians. He proposed that Amakusa and Tsurusaki (≈åita Prefecture) be exchanged when he obtained the land of Kumamoto, and this was realized. G≈çzoku in Amaksa repeatedly fought each other in the Sengoku period. In 1560, they realized the superiority of the arquebus which Matsuura Takanobu had introduced into local warfare. In 1566, a g≈çzoku asked Cosme de Torr√®s to send a Catholic missionary. Lu√≠s de Almeida was dispatched in the same year. He built a church with the permission of the rulers. In 1568, a congress of foreign missionaries was held in Amakusa. In 1570, missionaries baptized the Shiki, Amakusa, and Amakusa ruling families. In Amakusa, five jizamurai also became Christian. As a result, Catholic culture flourished. Amakusa College (College Amacusa) graduated scholars between 1591 and 1597, at Hondo or Kawaura of Amakusa.Which one is correct remains undecided It published more than twelve books including Aesop's Fables in Japanese in 1593 and the Tale of the Heike (Feique No Monogatari), in 1592, with the Gutenberg press, imported from Italy by overseas scholars It≈ç Mansho (Mancio It≈ç), Miguel Chijiwa, Hara Maruchino, and Nakaura Julian. Upon returning, they continued their studies at Amakusa College.The book of the Aesoop's Fables was reprinted in Japanese ESOPO by Tetsuko Nakagawa Kumamoto Nichinichi Shimbun, 2009 The number of Christians in Amakusa was great, more than a half of inhabitants, 9,000‚Äì11,000 (1580) or 23,000 (1592) were documented. After the martyrdom of 26 saints at Nagasaki and the prohibition of Christianity, the printing machine was transferred to Nagasaki.Iwamoto C. et al. History of Kumamoto in topics Gen Shobou, 2007, p98‚Äì99 =Shimabara Rebellion= The Shimabara Rebellion was an uprising largely involving Japanese peasants, most of them Catholic Christians, in 1637 and 1638. In the wake of the Matsukura clan's construction of a new castle at Shimabara, taxes were drastically raised, which provoked anger from local peasants and lordless samurai (r≈çnin). In addition, religious persecution against the local Christians exacerbated their discontent, which turned into open revolt in 1637. The Tokugawa shogunate sent a force of over 125,000 men and defeated them. The rebel leader Amakusa Shiro, a charismatic 15-year-old Christian, died when the castle fell. Executed in the aftermath of the fall, his head was displayed on a pike in Nagasaki for a long time afterward as a warning to any other potential Christian rebels. Persecution of Christianity was strictly enforced. Japan's national seclusion policy was tightened, and formal persecution of Christianity continued until the 1850s. In 1641, Amakusa was put under the direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate. =Hidden Christians in Amakusa= The Virgin Mary disguised as Kannon, Kirishitan cult, 17th century Japan. Salle des Martyrs, Paris Foreign Missions Society. In 1805, 5,200 underground \\"hidden\\" Christians were found in Amakusa. The Tokugawa shogunate treated this problem with unexpected leniency and recognized religious conversion. =Amakusa and Christianity in later years= People in Amakusa heard that the ban on Christianity had been lifted and some people reported that their faith was converted to Christianity in 1876. However, it was not accepted, and some others were punished because they conducted funerals according to the Christian style. In 1892, a French father, Fr√©d√©ric Louis Garnier (1860‚Äì1941), started a church in Oe, Amakusa.He was mentioned in 5 Pairs of Shoes by Yosano Tekkan, Mokutaro Kinoshita, Kitahara Hakushu, Hirano Banri and Yoshii Isamu Edo period The town area of Kumamoto had been completed at the time of Kat≈ç Kiyomasa. Tsuboi Kawa (river) had been separated from the Shirakawa. Portions of Tsuboi Kawa and Iseri Kawa were made into moats of Kumamoto Castle. Samurai residential areas were placed around Kumamoto Castle, and the areas for townspeople were separated. Choroku Bridge was the only bridge crossing the Shirakawa (river); it was the only one for the defense of Kumamoto Castle. Suizenji Park, a Japanese style garden, was made for the exclusive use of the Hosokawa clan in 1634. A factory for wax production was completed in 1803; the products were transported over the rivers to the sea. Suizen-ji Park Temples had been burnt in the Sengoku period, especially those in the Mount Aso area, but some were later reconstructed. In those areas, hot spring sites were constructed between 1804 and 1829 in Kurokawa and Yamaga. Sake production flourished. Uto castle was once destroyed, but it was rebuilt and there was water supply service, which works even today. Although Higo (Kumamoto and Yatsushiro) was then one domain, Yatsushiro Castle was made a single exception to the rule of one castle in one domain; because there was need to defend Kumamoto against the powerful Satsuma Han to the south and to defend Japan from foreign invasion. Kat≈ç Kiyomasa and the Hosokawa clan increased the productivity of Kumamoto han by various means, such as the control of rivers and land reclamation by drainage on the sea. One example was the construction of Ts≈´jun Bridge which made barren land fertile land. Ts≈´jun Bridge discharges water in May 2007 Hitoyoshi enjoyed the status of a separated han, and there was a special taxation system; various items were available for taxation products in addition to rice, and they were transported via the Kuma River. In Amakusa, Suzuki Shigenari was the head of the regional branch of the Tokugawa shogunate and governed Amakusa, and he repeatedly asked the shogunate for the reduction of rice taxation, from 42,000 koku to 21,000 koku. He committed ritual suicide (seppuku) to achieve this reduction successfully, though there was a view that he died through disease. Horeki Reform Hosokawa Shigekata, benevolent lord who saved Kumamoto. Hosokawa Shigekata (January 23, 1721 ‚Äì November 27, 1785) was the 6th lord of Kumamoto, of the Hosokawa clan, and noted for his successful financial reform of the Kumamoto Domain. His elder brother, the 5th daimy≈ç, unfortunately and unexpectedly was killed, and so Shigekata had to face the financial difficulties of the Kumamoto Han. The deficit at the time of his father reached 400,000 ry≈ç. The finance of his Han had worsened because of the policy of the Tokugawa shogunate which required the sankin-kotai, a policy where a daimy≈ç had to spend alternating years in the city of Edo. This policy was a great financial burden for a daimy≈ç, who had to pay for travel to the capital in a manner befitting his status, and had to maintain an appropriate residence in the capital and in his domain. In 1752, Shigekata appointed Hori Katsuna to the post of \\"great bugy≈ç\\". Hori immediately went to Osaka to negotiate with Kohnoike family and others for loans, but the wealthy families refused the request. Then, Hori was successful in borrowing a huge sum of money from Kajimaya in return for the 100,000 koku of rice from Kumamoto Han. Kajimaya requested a considerably reduced financial policy of Kumamoto han. The Kokudaka or the system of koku refers to a system for determining land value for tribute purposes in the Edo period Japan and expressing this value in koku of rice. This tribute was no longer the percentage of the actual quantity of rice harvested, but was assessed based on the quality and size of the land. The system was used to value the incomes of daimy≈çs, or samurai under daimy≈çs. Originally, the samurai kept 40% of all rice produced. After the reform, 20 koku per 100 went to a samurai, and then 13 koku, this meant a reduction of 65%. =Education, commercial, and criminal law reform= Kumamoto han wanted the samurai to be satisfied with the H≈çreki reforms, and at the same time, they should train themselves as strong warriors. One way to meet this goal was to build a school for samurai and others. Another idea was to rehabilitate those who went against the rules, and Shigekata created a completely new criminal law. He also started a medical school called Saishunkan. In addition, Shigekata and Hori started various new industries involving Japanese paper, silk, and wax. =Famine and tsunami= In 1634, there was a considerable famine which may have contributed to the Shimabara Rebellion of 1637. The reduced production of rice was observed occasionally from time to time; 1729 was also the year of famine, and it was recorded that there was only 11% of the mean annual production. In addition to famine, there was a peculiar tsunami. In 1792, a large mountain, Mayu Yama (Maeyama), at the foot of the volcano Mt. Unzen (Nagasaki Prefecture) collapsed with volcanic earthquakes, produced a great tsunami that struck the seashore of Kumamoto Prefecture. In all, 15,000 people died. This was the second largest tsunami in the history of Japan, after the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami.. Farmers' uprisings Usually translated as peasant uprising, it was reported that wealthy farmers also participated; in Higo Province, more than 100 cases of farmers' uprisings were recorded. These cases were characterized by small numbers of participants, less than 300 people, and their claims were the reduction of taxation, about the instability of han money, request for the resignation of the shoya and employees. In 1747, farmer uprising occurred in Ashikita, requesting the withdrawal of the resignation of Inatsu Yaemon, a high-ranking official who had an understanding of farmers. Its participants numbered 7,000 to 8,000 people. 19th Century =Yokoi Shonan and the Bakumatsu= Yokoi Shonan The Bakumatsu was a period toward the end of Tokugawa shogunate. Yokoi Sh≈çnan (1809‚Äì1869) was a scholar and political reformer in Japan, influential around the fall of the Tokugawa shogunate. Yokoi was a samurai born in Kumamoto, was sent by the domain to Edo in 1839 for studies, and developed contacts with pro-reform members of Mito Domain. After his return to Kumamoto, he started a group to promote the reform of domain administration along Neo- Confucian lines. In 1857, he was invited by the daimy≈ç of Echizen, Matsudaira Yoshinaga, to become his political adviser. Although he was highly evaluated at that time, he was assassinated in 1869. =Meiji Restoration= Imperial Japanese Army officers of the Kumamoto garrison, who resisted Saig≈ç Takamori's siege, 1877 General Tani Tateki There was a chain of events from the Bakumatsu, Meiji Restoration (1868), Abolition of the han system (1871) and Satsuma Rebellion (1877). The name of the Prefecture was finally made Kumamoto Prefecture in 1876. The Sword Abolition Edict and the abolition of the caste system were issued in 1876, and samurai were angered and became furious. Saig≈ç Takamori, the hero and leader of Meiji Restoration, left the central Meiji Government and returned to Kagoshima, with disaffected samurai followers. Satsuma Rebellion In 1877, the Satsuma army came to Kumamoto, but languished for two months during the Siege of Kumamoto Castle, which proved the unrivaled durability of the castle. Shortly before their attack on Kumamoto Castle, the surrounding townscape was burned in preparation for the battle. Kumamoto Castle also burned down, though the cause of the fire is unknown. The commander of Kumamoto Castle was Tani Tateki who was fresh from the Taiwan Expedition of 1874. Count Sano Tsunetami In 1877, Sano Tsunetami (1823‚Äì1902) created the Hakuaisha, a relief organization to provide medical assistance to soldiers wounded in the Satsuma Rebellion. This organization became the Japanese Red Cross Society in 1887, with Sano as its first president. Souha Hatono VIII of Kumamoto (1844‚Äì1917) was a Japanese physician. During the Satsuma Rebellion, he treated wounded soldiers from both sides equally. He faced a trial for trying to benefit the enemy, but was proved innocent. His activities were in accord with the spirit of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement. Modernization =Imperial Army= Chinzei Tandai, one of the six large units of the Japanese Army, was placed in Kumamoto in 1871. After the Satsuma rebellion in 1877, the 6th Infantry Division was formed in Kumamoto City on May 12, 1888, as one of the new divisions to be created after the reorganization of the Imperial Japanese Army away from six regional commands and into a divisional command structure. The headquarters were placed in Kumamoto Castle, with the infantry battalion, the cavalry battalion and artillery battalion, and this arrangement came to an end at the end of World War II. Japan experienced the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. After the Russo-Japanese War, Kumamoto accepted about 5,000 prisoners of war at Toroku. A large-scale military exercise was held in Kumamoto, attended by Emperor Hirohito, 1931. =To Prosperous Kumamoto= The army's Yamasaki Training Area, placed after the Satsuma Rebellion, blocked traffic and the development of Kumamoto City. In consideration of public opinion, other military buildings were transferred to Toroku and Oe Mura, but the Yamasaki Training place was still there. At the cost of Kumamoto City, it moved to Oe Mura, starting as late as 1898. In the wake of the Yamasaki Training place, Renpei Cho and Karashima (then mayor) Cho were named, and Shinshigai became the busiest section of Kumamoto City. In 1907, Kumamoto Light railway company started, which later changed to Kumamoto Electric Railway Company and then to streetcars. Public organizations were invited, such as the 5th Higher Middle School in 1887 which changed to the 5th High School in 1894, Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in 1911. Infrastructure such as construction of roads, water supply (1924), streetcar lines were completed, which was the basis of development for Kumamoto City. Disasters Near the end of World War II, Kumamto experienced several air raids, and the greatest one on the night of June 30 to July 1, 1945. About one third of the city was burned, and more than 300 people died. After the war, there were a considerable number of floods due to typhoons, possibly exacerbated by deforestation and delay in river control. In June 1953, there was a combination of Mount Aso eruption and floods, causing debris to flow into the center of Kumamoto city, and more than 500 people died in Kumamoto Prefecture. Various dams, such as Ichifusa dam, Midorikawa dam, Ryumon dam, have been constructed to prevent another disaster. Tateno dam is under construction. The 1973 Taiyo Department Store fire occurred in the center of Kumamoto City. The fire started at 1:15 pm on November 29, 1973; and 103 people died. After the fire, national regulations pertaining to the construction of buildings were strengthened, one of which was the building of external steps outside of the high-storied buildings. Industry Since early times agriculture has remained an important industry. In 1911, the government encouraged agriculture by placing agricultural experiment stations in Kumamoto Prefecture. Since 1964, industrialization started, with factories for the production of motorcycles and semiconductors. Kumamoto Technopolis Project was started to invite various factories near Kumamoto Airport. The Five Bridges of Amakusa linked the Ky≈´sh≈´ mainland and the Amakusa Islands, and opened on September 24, 1966. The Five Bridges not only gave hope and confidence in the development of Japan's bridge construction technology, but also changed many aspects of life in the Amakusa Islands. Mount Aso and Amakusa became sightseeing destinations. Minamata disease The Chisso factory and its wastewater routes The Chisso Corporation („ÉÅ„ÉÉ„ÇΩÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, Chisso kabushiki kaisha) started a factory in Minamata city in 1908. In 1956 that Minamata disease was identified and described; it was caused by the release of methylmercury in the industrial wastewater from the factory. The symptoms of the disease include ataxia, numbness in the hands and feet, general muscle weakness, narrowing of the field of vision, and damage to hearing and speech capability. As of March 2001, 2,265 victims were officially recognised (1,784 of whom had died) and over 10,000 received financial compensation from Chisso. By 2004, Chisso Corporation had paid $86 million in compensation. On March 29, 2010, a settlement was reached to compensate as-yet uncertified victims.

Early life She was born as Eveline Allen on September 19, 1856 in Ogden, Utah to James T. Allen, and Elizabeth Pidd. Her family moved to St. Joseph, Missouri, while she was an infant. Living there until she was ten years of age they moved to St. Louis, where she attended the Franklin and High schools, graduating from the latter in 1875 as valedictorian of her class. Career Eveline Burgess Burgess did not remember when she began playing chess, having been, taught by her father, Dr. James X. Allen, an Englishman, from Lancashire, who was very fond of the game. He was a surgeon in the Union Army. Much of his leisure time was devoted to playing chess. He taught his little daughter and insisted that she play a game at noon hour while attending school, and she remembers frequently after finishing she would have to run all the way back to school to be on time. She became very enthusiastic and always played her best. After she finished school, and until about twelve years after her marriage, she did not play chess, but when her brother, a lad of sixteen years, came to visit them he was very anxious to try his skill against her. While she felt that she did not \\"even remember the moves,\\" she asked Mr. Burgess to bring home a set of chessmen from the book store, and the next day played seventeen games with her brother, losing only the first. It was after her husband became interested that the different chess players in North St. Louis assembled and organized a club known as \\"The North St. Louis Chess Club.\\" Burgess was the only woman member and played against five men, and often eight. She won the first prize three times, and the second once, in four tourneys; one of the prizes being a handsome shopping bag with gold mountings, beautifully engraved. In 1901 a Woman's Chess Club was founded and held its meetings once each week at the rooms of the Office Men's Club on Washington Avenue. Mrs. Coldwell, a visitor from Canada, aided greatly in the organization, having been the first one to suggest this move. Miss Fitzgerald, daughter of Bishop Fitzgerald; Mrs. Woodward, wife of Professor Woodward; Mrs. Bouton, Miss Overall, daughter of Judge John Overall, and Mrs. S. B. Burgess were the members. A tourney was played in which Mrs. Burgess won first prize with a score of nine and one-half wins and one-half game lost. This club existed for one winter only. The \\"West End\\" Chess Club was organized in 1907 at the home of W. F. Burden, 5029 Maple Avenue. The charter members were W. F. Burden, A. A. Hardy, E. F. Schrader, J. D. Bichardsons, J. G. Nix, P. B. Eversden and H. S. Frazer, M. D. Dr. Frazer was appointed secretary and held that office three years. The members number were about twenty. It was the courtesy of the club to elect Burgess and Mrs. Hewit alternately to the office of vice-president, they being the only active women members. Mr. S. B. Burgess was the president, Mrs. Hewit the vice-president, with Mr. Lee L. Backer as secretary. Mrs. Hewit ranked second to Burgess among the women players in St. Louis. She planned a brilliant game and never missed the Monday evening meetings of the West End Chess Club, at the Cabanne Branch Library. Mrs. J. H. Hewit was Eleanor Tomlinson, of Connecticut. Her father, like Burgess', was a surgeon in the army and taught her to play while she was a child. She was much admired and liked by the chess players for her charming personality and skillful game. Eveline Burgess held the chess championship, among women in the United States, since March 1907, having won it from Mrs. Clarence Frey, then living in Newark, N. J., but a member of the Woman's Chess Club of New York. The match was played at the club headquarters of the Martha Washington Hotel in New York. For this victory Burgess was awarded a gold medal. Soon after this she was challenged by Mrs. Natalie Nixdorff, of Cambridge, Mass., but did not make arrangements to play until the following year, when she was again the winner ‚Äî four to one. Another and larger gold pin was presented her, with a shield, enameled in colors on a chess board surmounted by a crown. After that Burgess was challenged by Mrs. Lynn, of Chicago, but at the time agreed upon Mrs. Lynn was unable to keep the appointment. Mrs. Nixdorff, being very anxious for another match, again challenged Mrs. Burgess, who accepted, but the game was indefinitely postponed. Personal life She taught school and music for one year in Montgomery County, and on July 4, 1876 married Samuel Rostron Burgess (1851‚Äì1918), who was born in St. Louis and lived here all his life. Mr. Burgess was the secretary of the Boland Book Company until he retired. She taught her grandson, Walter Richard Evans, to play chess. Burgess had five children, who all play chess \\"a little,\\" but only the oldest son, Samuel Allen, played a really good game, having won in simultaneous play against Pillsbury, while he was yet a student at Washington University. Not one of the children, however, were fond of chess, and only Mr. and Mrs. Burgess belong to the chess clubs. She died on July 10, 1936, in Independence, Missouri.

It was a relatively new concept at the time, but 30 years later, multidisciplinarity is viewed as the best approach cancer treatment.https://www.europeancancer.org/ It was consequently decided to bring together major players in cancer research, treatment, and care in order to create awareness of patients‚Äô wishes and needs, encourage progressive thinking in cancer policy, education, and training, and continue to promote European cancer research and its application through the organisation of a multidisciplinary conference called ECCO -the European Conference on Clinical Oncology (later renamed ECCO-the European Cancer Conference).https://www.europeancancer.org To strengthen and further develop these ideas six professional societies, ESMO, ESTRO, ESSO, EACR, EONS, SIOPE legally founded FECS (Federation of European Cancer Societies). After a period of reflection in 2006 and 2007, during which many players in oncology were consulted, FECS was transformed into a new dynamic entity: the European Cancer Organisation.

This new strategy included two pillars: Policy & Advocacy being the first pillar, achieving consensus among Member Societies and Patient Advocacy Groups and then advocating for those agreed policies. The second pillar saw the creation of eight Focused Topic Networks which were launched during 2020. These Networks are focused on Quality Cancer Care, HPV Action, Health Systems & Treatment Optimisation, Digital Health, Survivorship & Quality of Life, Workforce, Inequalities and Prevention. A new Special Network was launched in June 2020 on the Impact of Covid-19 on Cancer.

Biography  After the October Revolution of 1917, his stepfather brought the young Eisner to the Princes' Islands. Thus began a life in exile. Eisner graduated from the Grand Duke Constantine Constantinovich Russian Cadets Corps in Sarajevo. He remained in Europe where he made a living washing windows and working at construction sites. He started writing poetry and met with many famous Russian √©migr√©s such as Georgy Adamovich, Marina Tsvetaeva and her husband Sergei Efron. His poem \\"Looming Autumn, Yellow Bushes ...\\" was published in 1932 and became a textbook and was very popular in literary √©migr√© circles. The line \\"Man begins with grief ...\\" from this poem is often cited. Eisner joined the literary association of Russian √©migr√©s in Prague. In the late 1920s, he sought to return to the Soviet Union and in 1934 he joined the \\"Homecoming Union\\". In 1936, he joined the XII International Brigade which fought on the side of the Republicans during the Spanish Civil War. He was an adjutant to M√°t√© Zalka, the Hungarian writer who served as a general under the name of Luk√°cs (General Luk√°cs). At the end of the Civil War, he reportedly ran into Ernest Hemingway who wrote him a blank cheque that Hemingway ensured him he could draw upon should he choose to visit Hemingway in the United States. Eisner returned to the Soviet Union in January 1940 without cashing the cheque. Four months later, his was searched by the secret police, who found the blank cheque signed by Ernest Hemingway. He was arrested and sentenced under Article 58 of the Criminal Code of the USSR to 8 years of hard labour in the Vorkuta camp. After completion of this period he was sent for \\"perpetual exile\\" to the Karaganda region in Kazakhstan. In 1956 he was rehabilitated and was permitted to return to Moscow where he was active as a translator and journalist. He wrote several books and published memoirs on General Luk√°cs, Haji Mamsurov (who fought in Spain under the name of Colonel Xanthi), Ilya Ehrenburg and Ernest Hemingway.

She later went on to study at Wollongong TAFE and then won a statewide scholarship to attend East Sydney Tech, where she earned two trade certificates. Upon completion, she undertook work experience with a fashion company and then was then offered a full‚Äêtime job in the fashion industry in Sydney, where she lived for eight years prior to moving to the North Coast in 1989, where she currently resides. Barham quickly became involved in local environmental groups and campaigning in the area. When the then state government granted support and the local council approved the development of a local resort by multinational tourism organisation Club Med, Barham founded and acted as secretary of Byron Shire Businesses for the Future to oppose the resort. The organisation legally challenged the approval by the council, and were ultimately successful in the Land and Environment Court.

He was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 2011 to 2019. He was a Greens member from 2011 to 2018, but resigned from the party on 20 December 2018. He was unsuccessful in retaining his seat in the Legislative Council in the 2019 state election. Early life Buckingham was born in Launceston, Tasmania and spent his early life living in the historic homestead 'Hillgrove', adjacent to the Taroona Shot Tower site south of Hobart. He attended Taroona Primary, Taroona High School and graduated from The Hobart College. After school he spent two years working as a benchman in a small country sawmill run by Kim Booth (later a Greens member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly) in central Tasmania. In 1994 Buckingham fronted heavy metal band Amplifire as singer, with other band members including his brother Jessie 'Tambo' Buckingham, as well as Michael Kell and John Salter. Buckingham moved to Sydney in the mid 1990s, where he worked as forklift driver, hardware store salesman and builders' labourer. Buckingham relocated to Orange in the central west of New South Wales in 1997 with his wife Sarah, where he worked as production manager for monumental stonemason McMurtrie & Co. In his time at the stonemason, Buckingham worked on public works such as the Australian War Memorial in London, the Federation Square project and the Sydney Olympic Games site. After a back injury rendered him unfit for heavy lifting, Buckingham enrolled and completed an Advanced Diploma in Ecological Agriculture and Land Management at the University of Sydney, which he completed in 2006. He continued to work as a stonemason until his election to state parliament in 2011. Political career Buckingham unsuccessfully contested the state Legislative Assembly seat of Orange in the 2003 and 2007 state elections. Buckingham was elected to the City of Orange council in 2004 and re-elected with an increased vote in 2008. He was the first member of the Australian Greens elected to a council west of the Great Dividing Range. As a councillor, he implemented Australia's first stormwater harvesting project for drinking water supply, initiated the city's first statement of commitment to the Aboriginal community, fought against homophobia and for the rights of same sex couples, campaigned to protect an agricultural research station from developers, and fought to protect water supplies from the Cadia gold mine that operates on the outskirts of Orange. Buckingham was elected convenor of the Central West Greens in 2008, a position which he held until 2011. Buckingham was the sixth candidate on the Greens' Senate ticket for the 2004 Australian federal election. He contested the lower house seat of Calare in the 2007 and 2010 federal elections without success. Buckingham was then preselected to third spot on the Greens' Legislative Council ticket in the 2011 state election. He was locked in a close race with Pauline Hanson and the Nationals for the final spots. After preferences were distributed he was elected with 2,437 votes ahead of Pauline Hanson, and 1,306 votes ahead of Sarah Johnston of the National Party. Since being elected, Buckingham has campaigned against the expansion of the coal and coal seam gas (CSG) industries in New South Wales and Australia. He has managed to build broad links across both sides of politics in the CSG campaign, and has made a personal ally of conservative radio show host Alan Jones who alongside Buckingham was sued by the former leader of the National Party (Andrew Stoner) for defamation. Buckingham initiated Australia's first parliamentary inquiry into coal seam gas. Buckingham introduced bills into the NSW Parliament attempting to restrict mining. The \\"Coal Seam Gas Moratorium Bill 2011\\" sought a moratorium on the granting of exploration licences for coal seam gas. The \\"Responsible Mining (Protecting Land, Water and Communities) Bill 2012\\" seeking to prohibit exploration and mining of minerals and petroleum in urban areas, National Parks, and drinking water catchments. Jeremy Buckingham & CSG pipe layer For the Greens, he held the portfolios of Mining and Resources, Primary Industries, Trade and Investment, Regional Infrastructure and Services, Agriculture, Health and Sport. Alongside former Greens leader Christine Milne, Buckingham had set up a country arm of the Greens party and was convenor of the Australian Country Greens. In October 2016, Buckingham tabled a motion in response to U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump's recently leaked statements. This included the phrase stating the NSW parliament \\"agrees with those who have described Mr Trump as 'a revolting slug' unfit for public office\\". The president of the upper house, Don Harwin, found the term \\"revolting slug\\" was not unparliamentary language. The motion was passed. =Resignation from the Greens= In November 2018 Greens MP Jenny Leong used parliamentary privilege to accuse Jeremy Buckingham of sexual violence toward a staff member whose job he then allegedly threatened, and following this the Greens NSW State Delegates Council passed a motion calling for Buckingham to resign due to violations of their sexual harassment policy. In retaliation Buckingham threatened other party members and candidates with defamation proceedings if they supported the former staff member. In December 2018, Buckingham resigned from the Greens NSW. His resignation followed a motion passed by more than three quarters of the Greens' branches asking that he step down from the 2019 election ticket following an allegation of sexual assault and other claims of internal bullying. Buckingham claimed that the allegations had seen party processes \\"abused and co-opted for factional purposes\\" and that the allegations had not been substantiated. Buckingham described the party as \\"toxic\\", and said the NSW Greens had \\"abandoned the core principles they were founded on\\" and were more focused on \\"bringing down capitalism\\" and \\"divisive identity politics\\" than acting on climate change. He said that as an independent, he would run on a ‚Äúreal green‚Äù platform to ‚Äúchallenge the party‚Äôs Marxist agenda‚Äù. =2019 state election= Buckingham contested the 2019 election as an independent. He ran on a platform of climate action and pressuring the market on gas. He also said he would team up with an independent candidate who would run against Jenny Leong in the lower house seat of Newtown. Buckingham was unsuccessful in retaining his seat at the election. He announced on 26 March 2019 that he would retire from public life.

He spent the latter part of his life at Epsom, where he died on 21 February 1797. His monument by John Flaxman in St Martin's parish church, Epsom carried an inscription by his friend William Jones of Nayland.

As a student at Oxford University, he first studied Greek vases that John Beazley had brought in, but soon switched to Menander and developed a lifelong interest in Greek comedy that resulted in \\"reconstructions of the plots of lost plays and ... collections of evidence from widely disparate sources bearing on the history of the Greek theater\\". Career He followed William Moir Calder (1880‚Äì1960) as Hulme Professor of Greek at Manchester University, a position he held 1931‚Äì48, when he was followed by H. D. (Henry) Westlake (1906‚Äì92). He then was Professor of Greek at University College London 1948‚Äì68 and in 1953 established the Institute of Classical Studies. During World War II he served as an officer in the military intelligence. After his wife, the Classicist A. M.

Details When the variable x appears in two sets of constraints, it is possible to substitute the new variables x1 in the first constraints and x2 in the second, and then join the two variables with a new \\"linking\\" constraint, which requires that : x1=x2. This new linking constraint can be relaxed with a Lagrange multiplier; in many applications, a Lagrange multiplier can be interpreted as the price of equality between x1 and x2 in the new constraint. For many problems, when the equality of the split variables is relaxed, then the system is decomposed, and each subsystem can be solved independently, at substantial reduction of computing time and memory storage. A solution to the relaxed problem (with variable splitting) provides an approximate solution to the original problem: further, the approximate solution to the relaxed problem provides a \\"warm start\\", a good initialization of an iterative method for solving the original problem (having only the x variable). This was first introduced by Kurt O. J√∂rnsten, Mikael N√§sberg, Per A. Smeds in 1985. At the same time, M. Guignard and S. Kim introduced the same idea under the name Lagrangean Decomposition (their papers appeared in 1987).

He is best remembered for his 25 seasons spent with the Metropolitan Opera, between 1941 and 1966. Life and career Born ethnic German-Jewish in Prague on March 15, 1908, Kurt Baum attended high school in Cologne, Germany where his father did business and attended medical school at the University of Prague. Robust and athletic, Baum was at one time the amateur heavyweight boxing champion of Czechoslovakia and member of Max Schmeling's Sports Club in Cologne. Baum never considered a career in music until a friend urged him to study music after hearing him sing a German drinking song at a party. In 1933, he dropped out of medical school and began attending the Music Academy of Berlin where he studied for less than a year. In 1933 Baum won first prize at the Vienna International Singing Competition, and his operatic d√©but came in the same year in Zurich in Zemlinsky's Der Kreidekreis. Baum spent his early year performing lyric roles at Zurich and dramatic roles at Deutsches Theater, and after furthering his studies with Eduardo Gabin in Milan and the faculty of Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia he toured the major theatres of Europe including Paris, Vienna, Budapest, Monte Carlo, and Salzburg. In 1939, Baum escaped the war threatening Czechoslovakia by migrating to Paris, and accepted a 3-year contract with the Chicago Lyric Opera. He made his debut there as Radames in Verdi's Aida. Baum's debut with the Metropolitan Opera, which became his artistic home, came in November 1941 as the Italian singer in Der Rosenkavalier. Baum's roaring spinto voice easily reach the high-D flat in the Rosenkavalier Italian singer aria, in which he had express permission (via a letter) from the composer to interpolate the note. He appeared in his first major role at the Met, Don Alvaro, in January 1943. In 1952, Baum performed Radames in London at the behest of Queen Elizabeth II shortly after her coronation. Baum remained on the Met's full-time roster until the 1965-1966 season, appearing there for the last time as Radames at the Old Met's Farewell Gala in April 1966. His repertoire included cornerstone spinto roles such as Don Alvaro, Radames, Cavaradossi, Manrico, Lohengrin, Walther von Stolzing, Don Jos√©, Canio, Samson, Des Grieux, Turiddu, Enzo, Pollione, and Andrea Ch√©nier, which he played beside such illustrious colleagues such as Maria Callas, Renata Tebaldi, Zinka Milanov, Eleanor Steber and Ris√´ Stevens. He won renown especially for his heroic voice, which can otherwise turn metallic over a performance, reliable technique and an amazing top register, which was lauded for its strength and virility. Baum became an American citizen and spent later years in New York City, where after the death of his wife he could often be found walking his dog around Central Park. He also wrote several treatises on preservation of the voice and singing well in old age. Baum died in New York on December 27, 1989 due to unspecified causes, leaving no immediate survivors. Recordings include the Lohengrin Bridal scene with Helen Traubel from 1945 which finds him in an ardent, heroic mood, underpinned by his characteristically strident technique. Several of his live performances as Pollione, Radames and Manrico beside Maria Callas in their 1950 Mexico tour were especially noted for the high degree of excitement generated, though he never sang at anything less than full volume.  excerpts from Norma, Il trovatore and Aida from the 1950 Mexico tour (retrieved June 6, 2011) References *Kurt Baum, Tenor, Is Dead at 81; He Sang at Met in 1940s and 1950s - New York Times' obituary, published December 29, 1989 (retrieved April 12, 2011) *Kurt Baum: Ending On A High Note - Los Angeles Times article, published February 22, 1987 (retrieved June 6, 2011) *Biography and Credits (retrieved June 6, 2011) 1908 births 1989 deaths American operatic tenors Czechoslovak emigrants to the United States Czech operatic tenors 20th-century American opera singers Musicians from Prague 20th-century male singers ","title":"Kurt Baum"},{"id":"31475169","text":"Chamanthedon tapeina is a moth of the family Sesiidae.

Somalis have a long history of maritime trade and interaction with the peoples of India as well as Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal, having established various commercial settlements, trade stations and partnerships with the Malacca Sultanate and the Kingdom of Cambaya, among other ancient Indian polities. After the outbreak of the Somali Civil War in 1991, some Somalis sought asylum in India. This small community of an estimated 600 people today comprises the bulk of Somali immigrants in the country. History The Somali people have a strong tradition in trade, with a long history of maritime enterprise. After the Roman conquest of the Nabataean Empire and the Roman naval presence at Aden to curb piracy, Arab and Somali merchants by agreement barred Somali ships from trading in the free port cities of the Arabian peninsulaEric Herbert Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India, p.54. to protect the interests of Somali and Arab merchants in the extremely lucrative ancient Red Sea‚ÄìMediterranean Sea commerce.Eric Herbert Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India, p.229. However, Indian merchants continued to trade in the port cities of the Somali peninsula, which was free from Roman interference.Eric Herbert Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India, p.187. Somali maritime trade and interaction with ancient Indian empires stretches back to antiquity. The Indian merchants for centuries brought large quantities of cinnamon from Sri Lanka and Indonesia to Somalia and Arabia. This is said to have been the best kept secret of the Arab and Somali merchants in their trade with the Roman and Greek world. The Romans and Greeks believed the source of cinnamon to have been the Somali peninsula, but in reality, the highly valued product was brought to Somalia by way of Indian ships.Eric Herbert Warmington, The Commerce Between the Roman Empire and India, pp.185-186. Through collusive agreement by Somali and Arab traders, Indian/Chinese cinnamon was also exported for far higher prices to North Africa, the Near East and Europe, which made the cinnamon trade a very profitable revenue generator, especially for the Somali merchants through whose hands large quantities were shipped across ancient sea and land routes. During the Age of the Ajurans, the Somali sultanates and republics of Merca, Mogadishu, Barawa, Hobyo and their respective ports flourished and had a lucrative foreign commerce, with ships sailing to and coming from India, Arabia, Venetia,John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver, Journal of African History, p.50. Persia, Egypt, Portugal and as far away as China. In the 16th century, Duarte Barbosa noted that many ships from the Kingdom of Cambaya in modern-day India sailed to Mogadishu with cloth and spices, for which they in return received gold, wax and ivory. Barbosa highlighted the abundance of meat, wheat, barley, horses and fruit on the coastal markets, which generated enormous wealth for the merchants.Sir Reginald Coupland, East Africa and its invaders: from the earliest times to the death of Seyyid Said in 1856, (Russell & Russell: 1965), p.38. Jewish merchants from the Hormuz also brought their Indian textile and fruit to the Somali coast in exchange for grain and wood.R. J. Barendse, The Arabian seas: the Indian Ocean world of the seventeenth century /c R.J. Barendse, (M.E. Sharpe: 2002), p.343. In addition, trading relations were established with the Indian Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century,Gujarat and the Trade of East Africa p.30 with cloth, ambergris and porcelain being the main commodities of the trade.Caroline Sassoon, Chinese porcelain marks from coastal sites in Kenya: aspects of trade in the Indian Ocean, XIV-XIX centuries, Volumes 43-46, (British Archaeological Reports: 1978), p.2. Hindu merchants from Surat, seeking to bypass both the Portuguese blockade and Omani meddling, also used the Somali ports of Merca and Barawa (which were out of their jurisdiction) to conduct their trade in safety and without interference.Edward A. Alpers, East Africa and the Indian Ocean, (Markus Wiener Publishers: 2009), p.21 More recently, a few Somalis have sought asylum in India as a consequence of the Somali Civil War, which broke out in 1991. This small community of expatriates today comprises the bulk of Somali immigrants in the country. Distribution Somalis mainly live in the following cities: Pune, New Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Mysore and Aurangabad. There are an estimated 600 Somali refugees in India, 80 to 90 percent of whom are concentrated in the city of Hyderabad as opposed to New Delhi. Social issues Somali asylum seekers in India often face greater challenges than do other immigrant groups in terms of gaining access to medical treatment and education, as well as locating suitable housing accommodations. This is primarily due to a lack of familiarity with both Hindi and English, which makes it difficult to find adequate jobs. As many are also not issued resident permits by the government, employers are often reluctant to hire the foreigners for fear of attracting the attention of the local police. Most of the Somali expatriates are young adults and unaccompanied minors who live in shared accommodation with little access to institutional support, as most of the services that they require are located in New Delhi. Despite this, some of the immigrants have reported better living conditions in Hyderabad on account of the lower overall cost of living, particularly in terms of housing and food. Hyderabad's large Muslim population and culture has also made for an easier transition.Human Rights Law Network: Report of Refugee Populations in India, November 2007 See also *Somali diaspora *Somali people *UNHCR India References External links *Voice of Somali Refugees in India Ethnic groups in India Somali India ","title":"Somalis in India"},{"id":"31475267","text":"Chamaesphecia seyrigi is a moth of the family Sesiidae.

Amateur career Dodson's first Olympic appearance came as a 17-year-old competing in the light welterweight division. He won his first two fights against Bilal el-Masri of Libya and Vuka≈°in Dobra≈°inoviƒá of Yugoslavia before losing to eventual bronze medallist Reiner Gies of West Germany in the third round. In 1989 he competed in the 147-pound division of Golden Gloves and won the Sugar Ray Robinson award as the outstanding boxer of the tournament. After moving to England he was the ABA welterweight champion in 1990, fighting out of Lynn ABC. He then took his mother's last name Dodson and made his second Olympic appearance competing for Great Britain at the 1992 Games in Barcelona. Due to the presence of Robin Reid in the team Dodson was forced to drop from his favoured light middleweight to the welterweight division in order to compete.

Dream TV was the first Egyptian private television channel, and now offers two channels on Nilesat: Dream TV 1 and Dream TV 2. The network provides cultural programming, news analysis, and a platform for talk shows - most notably \\"10:00 pm\\" () with Mona el-Shazly on Dream TV 2. Launch Dream TV was launched by business magnate Ahmad Bahgat in 2001. It was the first satellite channel to respond to the government of Egypt's limited opening of private satellite channels from a designated media 'free zone' in Media Production City (EMPC), which is a media and information complex near Cairo, Egypt. In 2000, the Egyptian government made the decision to allow private Egyptian-owned satellite broadcasters to start transmitting - with certain restrictions - from EMPC. Those businessmen with close relations to President Hosni Mubarak benefited most, and an Ahmad Bahgat, head of the Bahgat group and owner of Dreamland leisure and residential complex near Cairo, took the initiative by being the first to sponsor and launch Dream TV on 2 November 2001. Bahgat accepted part ownership of Dream TV by the Egyptian Radio and Television Union (ERTU). The ERTU is also the main shareholder of Egyptian Media Production City and Nilesat, which are both essential to private broadcasters' operations. As a result, there were limitations put on Dream TV's programming by ERTU. For example, as the ERTU already possessed its own Egyptian news networks, it had no interest in promoting news competition on Dream TV. Additionally, companies that operate within the EMPC are subject to intervention by the Public Authority for Investment and Free Zones, which has authority to suspend licenses. Political Content A dilemma for Dream was finding a balance between attracting viewers with compelling programming and not provoking authorities to suspend their broadcasting license. Vaguely worded prohibitions on criticizing those in power were a threat to Dream TV's broadcasting discretion. Moreover, Egypt's Emergency law grants Egypt's government carte blanche to take action against political criticism. Since its launch, Dream TV has received repeated warnings for its political content. The Egyptian free-zone authority warned Dream TV in 2002 that was at risk of losing its license after a week of programming that was deemed sexually explicit and critical of local politics. Although the sexual content was cited as the official reason for the warning, many suspected that political commentary was the real cause. In 2005, Wael Al Ibrashi, a Dream TV presenter and journalist on Sawt al-Umma, was one of three journalists put on trial for publishing the initials of judges accused of condoning electoral fraud while overseeing parliamentary elections. Ibrahim Eissa, host of Aala al-Qahwa on Dream TV and also editor of Al-Destour and Sawt al-Umma, was dropped in 2003 from the network as a condition of the prime minister for Ahmad Bahgat debt rescheduling to state-owned banks. In June 2006, Eissa was one of two people on Al-Destour to be sentenced to one year in prison after reporting a legal case that had accused President Mubarak of misusing public money in the privatization of public companies. Ibrahim Eissa's contract with Dream TV guaranteed that he would be allowed to express himself freely and use his program to 'present what people are feeling.' Role in 2011 Egyptian Revolution On 7 February 2011, following 11 days of detention by Egyptian authorities, Google executive and political activist Wael Ghonim was interviewed by Dream TV's \\"10:00pm\\" host Mona el-Shazly. During the interview, an emotional Ghonim praised and mourned protesters who had died demonstrating across Egypt. When el-Shazly began a segment narrating pictures of those killed, Ghonim began to weep uncontrollably. ‚ÄúThey went out only for the sake of Egypt,‚Äù said el-Shazly. ‚ÄúThey said what the previous generations couldn‚Äôt do, we can do.‚Äù Ghomin rose up from the table in the studio and walked off camera while Ms. Shazly took out her earpiece and followed him. Ghomin immediately went to Midan Tahrir in downtown Cairo to address the protesters, which in hindsight was one of many seminal moments of the Egyptian Revolution.

His father was Albert Jensen, architect, professor and Royal Building Inspector, and his mother Sophie Jensen n√©e Nebelong, daughter of the architect Niels Sigfred Nebelong. He adopted the surname to Falkentorp in 1899. He was enrolled at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, where Historicism still dominated and his father was a central figure, but left shortly after. Instead he took classes at a technical school and apprenticed as a mason. He was then articled to Heinrich Wenck, head of the architectural office of the Danish State Railways. There he met Carl Petersen and Povl Baumann with whom he would later collaborate on several projects. Falkentorp's architectural expression moved from Neoclassicism through Modernism to Functionalism. Important works, all in Copenhagen, include the housing development Classen Have (1924, with Carl Petersen and Povl Baumann), the copper-clad office building Ved Vesterport (1930‚Äì32, with Povl Baumann) and the Hornb√¶k Badehotel (1935) and Hotel Astoria (1935) next to Copenhagen Central Station.

Johanna Koerten Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature According to the RKD, she was known as a knipkunstenaar or papercut artist and draughts(wo)man.Johanna Koerten in the RKD Joanna Koerten died on 28 December 1715 aged 65, and is buried in the Oudezijds Chapel, Amsterdam. After her death her gallery continued as a place of interest to artists and a visitors book kept by her surviving husband shows the names of many notable artist and poet visitors, both during her lifetime and beyond. Among them are artists Gerard de Lairesse, Melchior Hondecoeter and Nicholas Verkolje; calligraphers Jacob Gadelle, and Mary Strick; and poets , John Brandt, Gesine Brit and Katharina Lescailje.  Technique  Koerten's paper cutting technique imitates the high art characteristics of oil painting and sculpture of the 17th century. She focused to create the effect of the tectural and perspectival nature of painting while at the same time achieving the monumental nature of sculpture. She emphasized the pictorial and illusionistic aspects of paper cutting, making her an innovative artist of her time as compared to typical paper cut art with delicate interlaced and calligraphic strands. She used a wide variety of cut shapes to more accurately imitate the appearance of gradually chiaroscuro, similar to painting. In her portrait of Peter the Great (c.1697), she portrays varying textures and contrast shown in the rough stonework through small slits as well as in Peter's armor shining in dark wedge cuttings contrasting against the white paper. Peter's fur ermine cape utilizes cutting techniques created with sharp spiked cuts, soft molded carvings, and short, ragged snips. Koerten's Frederik III shows linework depicting a deeper illusion of interior space in her use of linear perspective. Textured stonework and shimmering fabrics are also shown in this work along with curved, sweeping cuts resembling the appearance of hair. Works Intricate Paper cutting of a hunting scene by Dutch artist Joanna Koesten. c 1700. Original in Willet-Holthuysen Museum, Amsterdam. Only fifteen of her works survive.

It has smooth, powdery white bark, lance-shaped to curved adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, white flowers and cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical fruit.flower budsfruit Description Eucalyptus mannifera is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth, powdery, white or grey bark, sometimes with red patches, and which is shed in short ribbons, flakes or plates. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are linear to lance-shaped or curved, long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped to curved, the same shade of green on both sides, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of seven on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical or rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between January and May and the flowers are white. The fruit is a woody cup-shaped, hemispherical or conical capsule long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim of the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus mannifera was first formally described in 1834 by Robert Mudie from a specimen collected in the Blue Mountains, and the description was published in the Transactions of the Royal Medico-Botanical Society of London. Mudie did not give a reason for the specific epithet (mannifera) but did give the species the common name \\"manna gum tree\\". In 1962, Lawrie Johnson reduced Eucalyptus maculosa and Eucalyptus praecox to subspecies of E. mannifera and Eucalyptus praecox. Three subspecies names have been accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. gullickii (R.T.Baker & H.G.Sm.) L.A.S.Johnson; * Eucalyptus mannifera Mudie subsp. mannifera; * Eucalyptus mannifera subsp. praecox (Maiden) L.A.S.Johnson. Distribution and habitat Brittle gum is widespread in south-eastern New South Wales, south from Rylstone and in eastern Victoria. It usually grows in shallow, rocky soils.

Chauka comes from the Hindi word for square. The system consists of square shaped embankments. On three sides there are nine inch walls and one side is left open to allow rainwater to fill the structure. As one structure fills, then the overflow fills the next chauka and so on. Retaining the rainwater in this way helps prevent soil erosion and recharges the surface water enabling various grasses to thrive. This has the effect of holding the soil together and, as the chauka system is used mostly on common land, provides grazing areas for cow and goat herds. For this to be effective it is combined with the planting of grass seeds and trees. This system is widely in use in the Dudu block of Jaipur district in Rajasthan, India. Here a local village development organisation GVNML, working in the area of Natural Resource Management, has been responsible for its uptake among local villages.

Life He was born in Edinburgh in 1797, and in 1809 was apprenticed to the publisher Adam Black. Having completed his term he came to London in 1818 and entered the establishment of Ogle, Duncan, & Cochran, 295 High Holborn, who carried on a trade in theological books. He remained with them until 1825, when he started in business on his own account at Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields. For many years he was a member of the Scottish presbyterian church, and was one of the friends of the Rev. Edward Irving; subsequently he joined the Church of England. Acting on a suggestion of several clergymen, he in 1839 began a library for the use of theological students. It was at first named the Clerical Library and afterwards the Metropolitan Library. Every subscriber of one guinea was to have the privilege of borrowing from the library any volume he pleased, and subscribers were also entitled to make use of the reading-room as a kind of club, with papers, reviews, and magazines being supplied. The Clerical Library was not successful as a business, and Darling returned to work as a bookseller. Darling died at his residence, Fortess Terrace West, Kentish Town, London, on 2 March 1862. Works Darling compiled in 1843 the ‚ÄòBibliotheca Clericalis, or the Catalogue of the Books in the Clerical Library and Reading Rooms, 21, 22, and 23 Little Queen Street, Lincoln's Inn Fields,‚Äô a volume of 316 pages, giving an abstract of the contents of all the major works. In 1851 he brought out the first part of the ‚ÄòCyclop√¶dia Bibliographica, or Library Manual of Theological and General Literature: Authors,‚Äô a rival to the works of Robert Watt and William Thomas Lowndes. The first part, ‚ÄòAuthors,‚Äô was completed in 1854. It contains the names of notable theological authors, gives a short biographical or descriptive notice of their writings, and then an analysis of each volume. The second volume appeared in 1859. It contained ‚ÄòSubjects,‚Äô and gave an account of works bearing on the scriptures, a list of commentators on every book, and a list of all the sermons on every verse of the Bible. Darling had then an assistant in his son. A promised third volume of ‚ÄòGeneral Subjects in Theology‚Äô was never published. Another work bearing his name is ‚ÄòCatalogue of Books belonging to Sir William Heathcote at Hursley Park, 1834,‚Äô lithographed in imitation of manuscript.

Reopened in 1950, it seats 800 people. The Kleines Haus was remodelled in the 2012/13 season, seating up to 200 people, and presents plays and dance theatre. The foyer has a stage called \\"noon\\" for chamber concerts, lectures and other events. Moks is a theatre for children and youth, offering performances for school classes in the morning and young people and their families in the evening. All spectators are close to the stage. The quality of productions has been regarded as high, receiving more than regional attention. Several plays were presented at a theatre competition. The Brauhauskeller is located in the basement vaults of the former St. Pauli brewery. A small stage is intended for events for up to 60 spectators. It is the venue for the group Junge Akteure (young actors), which was founded in 2005, based on the Moks, as the theatre school of Theater Bremen. The stage is narrow and long, requiring unconventional sets. The theatre has around 400 employees.  Awards  In 1979, Theater Bremen was named ' (theatre of the year) by Theater heute.

Nevertheless he soon acquired renown as an architect of numerous lavish theatre buildings throughout Germany, starting with the construction of the Stadttheater Halle in 1886.

In March 1938, he published a report entitled \\"the North Africans in France\\", which criticised the Service de surveillance et de protection des Nord-Africains, organised by the Prefecture of Police.Blanchard, Emmanuel (2004), La dissolution des Brigades nord-africaines de la Pr√©fecture de police : la fin d‚Äôune police d‚Äôexception pour les Alg√©riens de Paris (1944-1953) ? , in Bulletin de l'IHTP, n¬∞ 83, June 2004, dossier ¬´ R√©pression, contr√¥le et encadrement dans le monde colonial au XXe si√®cle ¬ª. In his report, he predicted the dissociation of social protection activities and repressive activities concerning the immigrants of North African origin, but these reforms were not carried out by the Front populaire, the party of the time. Sacked in October 1940 due to his Jewish roots, he joined the private sector, in Lyon joining the r√©sistance organisation \\"Combat\\" and moved to London in April 1943. Returning to France in June 1944 with General de Gaulle, he was named Director General of social security on 5 October 1944. He then played a considerable part in the setting up of ordinances founding and organising social security. Replaced by Jacques Doublet, he returned to the Conseil d'√âtat in October 1951. In 1953, he was named President of the Sous-Section du Contentieux, then vice President in 1959, for which he was decorated by 1962 for aiding General de Gaulle with an exercise on special powers named in article 16 of the Constitution. President of the national social security budged, he was a member of and presided over the \\"Commission d'√âtude des probl√®mes de la Vieillesse\\", which in January 1962 published the celebrated \\"Rapport Laroque\\".

After the band split in 1995 they reformed in 2006. Since then the band has released a fifth studio album Boy's town and a sixth album Kalifornia. Band frontman Andy Pierce died in 2013. History =Gigolos on Parole= The band first formed in 1987 with the lineup of Andy Pierce on (Vocals), Jonnie Wee on (Lead Guitar), Dick Qwarfort on (Bass), George Swanson on (Drums), Roger White on (Keyboards) and were more of a straight up glam metal in the style of bands such as M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Poison & Hanoi Rocks. Their first gig was played at a local festival in Sweden taking inspiration from such acts as early M√∂tley Cr√ºe, Kiss, Sweet and Alice Cooper. After the release of their self-financed single Don't Walk From Love/Easy Come, Easy Go they signed to independent label HSM/CBS Records. Their debut record was released soon after in 1989 named Gigolos on Parole which then followed by more shows and an ever increasing fan-base. =First line-up changes= Changes were soon made in the band's line-up resulting in Peter Espinoza coming into the line-up to replace Jonny Wee on (Lead Guitar) which led to recording of some of the first tracks for their next record. In 1991 the band released Cruel Intention which was greeted by a number of high rating reviews from numerous magazines. \\"Cool Way of Living\\", \\"Can't Get Ya' Off\\" and \\"Trashed N' Dirty\\" had music videos recorded for them and were played heavily on MTV's Headbangers Ball. The album was soon released afterwards in Germany and Japan. =Vicious= In 1993 the band released their third record, Vicious. The album did not do as well as their previous record, due in part to the decreasing hold the glam metal sound was having at the time over the mainstream. Interest was moving more to the new sound of grunge popularized by bands such as Alice in Chains, Nirvana and Soundgarden. Most hard rock bands resorted to changing their core sound to more of a darker and heavier tone as an attempt to pique interest in the genre. \\"Heads Down (In Tinseltown)\\" and \\"Ain't Got Nothin\\" were made as videos; the latter being a much darker one than previous releases. =Nasty Idol's demise= By 1994 the grunge wave had all but created a mass of lost interest in the glam metal genre which increasingly made life even harder for most bands. Some even resulted in using drugs a lot more as bands were not making much money from gigs or record sales. Peter Espinoza left the band at this time to move on with other projects that he had. A fourth record was known to be under development at the time named The Fourth Reich but the label soon went bankrupt before the record was finished. The record would later be released in 2002 as Heroes for Sale by Perris Records. The band split up in 1995. =Other projects= The band's remaining members tried their best through the years to survive through a more degrading music industry. The most notable band being Majestic, Peter Espinoza's brainchild, which enjoyed success in Japan, as well as vocalist Andy Pierce's band Machinegun Kelly and later United Enemies. American label Perris Records later re-released all of the band's studio record's including a best-of and 1995 record The Fourth Reich renamed as Heroes for Sale. =Reunion= As 2006 came the band was announced as playing a reunion gig at the Sweden Rock Festival. This was later followed by the release of The Rejects on the Road tour. Throughout the same year the band played numerous shows in Sweden which were then followed by playing gig's and touring in Italy and the UK. The band spent much of 2008 recording their follow-up to Vicious and Heroes For Sale named Boys Town. The 12-track album was later released on 27 April 2009 through Metal Heaven records. The record was met with a warm reception from fans, and some percentage of the media that still knew of the band outside of Sweden. =Kalifornia= The band went for a short break in 2010 to ready themselves for a comeback with them playing a few shows in the year. On their official website the band named a few songs for the next record; \\"Kalifornia\\", \\"Nitestalkin\\", \\"Without Mercy\\", \\"Jack In A Box\\", \\"Roadtrip\\" and \\"No More Rules\\". Kalifornia was released on 3 July 2012. =2013= On 27 February 2013 the band revealed via their official website that founding member Dick Qwarfort had decided to leave the band. On 5 December 2013 frontman Andy Pierce, the last remaining original member of the band, died suddenly at the age of 45, from a brain hemorrhage. It is currently unknown whether the band will continue in light of recent events.

Sprott (born March 1, 1936) is a Canadian former professional wrestler, better known by his ring names Ricky Hunter and the masked wrestler The Gladiator. He was best known for his title-winning success in Championship Wrestling from Florida in the late 1960s, and for his stint from the mid-1980s in the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). Sprott was active for over 30 years, mainly performing in a number of National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) promotions. He wrestled throughout the United States and Canada, and internationally, including in Australia, Japan, and England.  Professional wrestling career  =Early career (1957‚Äì1962)= Sprott made his debut on October 16, 1957 in his hometown of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, wrestling under a variation of his real name, Buddy Sprott. He won his first championship, the Atlas Wrestling Club junior heavyweight title, by defeating Ray Lasko in September 1958 in Lockport, Manitoba. In September 1961 he teamed with George Eakin to defeat John DePaulo and Stan Mykietowich to win the Madison Wrestling Club tag team titles in Winnipeg, losing them two months later to Bob Brown and John DePaulo. =Leaving Canada (1962‚Äì1968)= In early 1962 Sprott expanded from his base in Manitoba, entering the larger wrestling market in the United States. He went to train with Verne Gagne of the American Wrestling Association in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Don Owen of the Pacific Northwest Wrestling promotion in Portland, Oregon. He then wrestled with Ed Francis' promotion in Hawaii and Worldwide Wrestling Associates in Los Angeles run by Mike and Gene LeBell under the name Rocky Hunter, in the Pacific Northwest as Ricky Hunter, as well as still appearing in Manitoba as Buddy Sprott. During this time he faced notable opponents such as Mad Dog Vachon, Pat Patterson, and Mr. Fuji. Sprott continued to develop his in-ring ability and success rate, wrestling mainly in Hawaii and the American and Canadian Pacific Northwest through to 1966, but including at least one international tour, wrestling in Australia in 1963. In March 1966 Sprott began wrestling in Roy Shire's NWA San Francisco territory, where he would remain for most of that year. Sprott credits his time in California with Shire as the point where they developed his masked wrestling character The Gladiator. In early 1967 Sprott moved onto Central States Wrestling where he would compete with the likes of Lou Thesz and Bob Orton, and later that year he entered Georgia Championship Wrestling. At the start of 1968 he undertook an extensive tour of Japan, wrestling with the Japan Wrestling Association, and then returned via Hawaii to again wrestle in Georgia. =Championship Wrestling from Florida (1968‚Äì1969)= At the start of November 1968 Sprott moved to the Championship Wrestling from Florida promotion, where he started performing as his masked persona of The Gladiator. He became one of the first wrestlers to employ the inverted suplex manoeuvre, and it was in this promotion that he had his greatest success, winning multiple titles over the next year. On 23 November 1968 The Gladiator defeated Nick Kozak in Tampa to win the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship for the first time. The Gladiator dropped the belt to Hans Mortier two-and-half months later, on 4 February 1969. Following this, on 3 April 1969 in Jacksonville The Gladiator defeated Boris Malenko for the NWA Florida Brass Knuckles Championship, which he lost back to Malenko two weeks later on 17 April. On 23 April The Gladiator fought the reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion and future Hall of Famer Dory Funk, Jr. to a sixty-minute time-limit draw, with a rematch on 21 May going for ninety minutes before The Gladiator lost by disqualification. The Gladiator teamed with Lester Welch to defeat the team of The Medics (Billy Garrett and Jim Starr) for the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on 29 April in Tampa, becoming only the second team to hold this title. The Gladiator and Welch lost these belts to the team of Yasuhiro Kojima and The Missouri Mauler on 27 May. The Gladiator then regained the NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship by defeating Mortier on 13 June 1969 to become a two time heavyweight champion, but shortly after again lost the belt back to Mortier. =Around the territories (1969‚Äì1985)= Following his successful run in Florida, Sprott again moved around the wrestling territories of the time. Throughout the remainder of 1969 and 1970 he returned to Hawaii as Ricky Hunter, and fought through Shire's San Francisco territory as The Gladiator. In early 1971 he again toured Japan as Ricky Hunter, and then spent several months in the NWA Western States promotion, based in Amarillo, Texas, famous as the home territory of the Funks. Wrestling as The Spartan, on 14 April 1971 he defeated Pak Song to win the NWA Western States Heavyweight Championship, losing the belt to Terry Funk in May. He returned to the Hawaii and California territories through to 1972, wrestling again as Ricky Hunter. In April 1972 he returned to the Pacific Northwest, where he remained for the rest of the year. In 1973 he moved onto World Class Championship Wrestling based in Texas. All-South Wrestling Alliance (1973) In mid-1973, adopting the new moniker of The Super Gladiator, he entered the recently created independent All-South Wrestling Alliance (ASWA) based in Atlanta, a non-National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) competitor to Georgia Championship Wrestling. On 31 July 1973 in Atlanta The Super Gladiator teamed with Tommy Seigler to beat Rock Hunter and Assassin #2 to win the ASWA Georgia Tag Team Championship, which they would hold until 9 October before losing them back to the same opponents. On Friday, 24 August 1973 The Atlanta Constitution & Journal reported that Sprott had sued the reigning NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jack Brisco for slander and harassment, seeking a $75,000 payment plus losses. The lawsuit arose from an alleged incident in the parking lot of WTCG-TV the previous month, where Sprott claimed Brisco had called him names \\"in hearing distance of a number of wrestling fans\\" waiting for a wrestling television taping. The result of the case is not known, but the alleged incident would have occurred at the height of tensions between the NWA's Georgia Championship Wrestling and Sprott's rebel independent All-South Wrestling Alliance. Just over two weeks after losing the tag team titles he shared with Tommy Seigler, on 27 October 1973 The Super Gladiator defeated Seigler to win the ASWA Georgia Television Title. He would never relinquish this title, retaining it in his last recorded title defence against El Mongol in March 1974. Although briefly successful and attracting several high-profile wrestlers, the ASWA was squeezed out of business by the powerful NWA, with The Super Gladiator being the last recorded television champion when the promotion closed in November 1974. California and the Northwest In mid-1974 Sprott went back to wrestling in California as Ricky Hunter. In April 1975 he again returned to wrestle in the NWA Pacific Northwest promotion and the Canadian Northwest Wrestling promotion's NWA: All- Star Wrestling based in British Columbia. On 16 June 1975 he teamed with Guy Mitchell to defeat Gene Kiniski and Dale Lewis for the NWA Canadian Tag Team Championship in Vancouver. This was Sprott's first and only title as the maskless Ricky Hunter, and the last championship title he would hold; they dropped these belts to Lewis and Mr. Saito on 10 August 1975. Sprott remained wrestling chiefly in California and the Northwest until mid- to late 1979. He then spent several months in the American Wrestling Association (AWA) in Minneapolis, and from mid-1980 divided his time between the AWA and the NWA Pacific Northwest, as well as spending some time overseas, including in England. Sprott said after retiring that the Portland territory was by far his favourite, and he also enjoyed wrestling in the San Francisco territory, thus explaining the extended time he spent in these areas. Throughout this period Sprott shared the ring with many of the biggest names in wrestling, as both opponents and tag team partners. This included both past and future World Champions, and future Hall of Famers, including the likes of Andr√© the Giant, Jesse The Body Ventura, Rowdy Roddy Piper, Superfly Jimmy Snuka, Superstar Billy Graham, and Soulman Rocky Johnson. =World Wrestling Federation (1985‚Äì1996)= Approaching fifty years of age, and beyond his prime, Sprott joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) (now WWE) in mid-1985, shortly after the first WrestleMania event. In the WWF he performed as both Rick Hunter and The Gladiator, with both characters taking on the role of a jobber, cleanly losing to the stars of the day. Both Rick Hunter and The Gladiator made regular appearances on WWF Championship Wrestling and the later WWF Superstars of Wrestling, the WWF's nationally and internationally broadcast weekly television programs of the time. Despite the sustained record of losses at this time, Sprott's personas, particularly Rick Hunter, put up many creditable performances, and he was sometimes teamed with bigger name characters to take the pinfall in tag team matches. By performing as both a masked and an unmasked wrestler, Sprott was often used as a heel or 'bad guy', losing to the big-name face or 'good guy' characters, while his other persona could be a face, losing to the big-name heels. This, along with his ability to put on credible matches, made Sprott a very useful jobber for the bookers as he was able to take on a multitude of roles. Sprott stated that at times he would wrestle two matches in a night, one as each of his characters. Sprott's last recorded match with the WWF was on 9 March 1988 in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where he was defeated by the One Man Gang. Despite this, Sprott stayed in the business, wrestling occasionally as a fill-in for absent or injured wrestlers in house shows or dark matches, as well as assisting with setting up the ring. With his decades of experience, during his last five years with the WWF Sprott also took on the role of referee. Sprott finally left the sport around 1996, stating in a 2006 interview that \\"... for thirty- six years I was a professional wrestler and loved every minute of it\\". Personal life Sprott was reported to have been a firefighter with the Winnipeg Fire Department from the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, when he quit to take up wrestling full-time. Sprott retired to Clearwater, Florida, and was married to Sharon, however is now a widower.

Ray and produced by L.C. Borden. Plot summary Concert violinist Arthur Williams (Clarence Muse) and his manager Earl Wells (Earle Morris) are involved in a car accident in which Arthur's fingers are paralyzed. Instead of playing at concerts he becomes a music teacher. He favors his student Dickie Morley's (Matthew \\"Stymie\\" Beard) classical musical preferences over his own son John's (William Washington), which tends towards modern swing. Williams' daughter Grace (Sybil Lewis) is romantically interested in a man named Gus (Pete Webster), and they both work for the same company that makes hair products, which is owned by a James Stilton. Stilton's son, Sam (Edward Thompson), has a thing for grace and is jealous of the attention she gives Gus. As a result, Sam refuses to give Grace an advance when she needs to pay for her father's appointment at a doctor that specializes in neurology, Dr. Charles Matson (Jess Lee Brooks). The doctor promises Grace that she can pay the fee of $1,000 later, when her brother John has raised the money. Sam goes on to frame Gus for something he didn't do, and when Gus finds out, both he and Grace quit their jobs at the Stilton company. Fortunately, Johnny is a big success at the Miller Caf√© when he is playing swing. Arthur is mad and chastizes his son for playing such, in his view, awful music, and punishes him by making him play the violin until he faints. Soon after, Grace tells her father that Johnny only played at the club so that they could pay for the neurologist and support themselves since she is currently between jobs. Arthur feels guilt over how he treated his son. Johnny and Grace go on to enter a music contest broadcast on the radio. At first it looks like their performance will be stopped when two strings on his violin, but then he gets the idea to play swing, since there are enough strings for that. The rest of the radio musicians all start playing the same way, and the performance is a success. When his son wins the contest, Arthur realizes his talent, and starts to regain sensitivity enough in his fingers to applause his son. Later it turns out that Dickie had sabotaged the violin before the contest, for which he apologizes. Arthur continues his career as a violinist.

It is registered under the Rajasthan Society Registration Act 28 1958, FCRA, 80G and 12A, PAN, TAN and TDS. Registration Number: 489 / 85-86. Unofficially its work began in 1977 in the village of Laporiya which is in the Dudu block of Jaipur district, Rajasthan, India. The organisations founder Laxman Singh began work on mobilizing local communities to rebuild local rainwater collection structures that had fallen into disrepair. This community group quickly evolved into GVNML which literally means Village Development New Youth Group Laporiya, and it was registered as an NGO in 1986. The organisation has since, amongst other works, promoted the use of a unique water harvesting technique known as the chauka system which has been used to reduce soil erosion and provide year-round fodder on communal lands for cow and goatherds. GVNML facilitates local action by building alliances and carrying out capacity building in community-based organisations, believing that empowering villagers is the only way to sustainably develop. Mission To work as a catalyst for grassroots development and local empowerment by assisting rural communities in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan to live with dignity by democratic principles and pursue the lifestyle of their choice. Approach to development GVNML facilitates grassroots action, providing technical, legal and managerial support to the community. But GVNML believes that empowering villagers to cooperate is the only way to ensure sustainable development. The aim is to build alliances and carry out capacity building in Community Based Organizations to render them capable of continuing the projects without external support. Since the organization‚Äôs establishment in 1977, the development approach has evolved from needs to a rights-based approach, and now many of their programmes focus on personal rights development and community development The state and national government continue to pass bills giving citizens the Right to Education, the Right to Food and the Right to Information, GVNML has a local impact in ensuring that these rights are claimed. Areas of intervention =Climate change adaptation= GVNML works in the fields of Common Property Resources, Agriculture and Water Management. Common property resources Animal Husbandry is the one of the major sources of livelihood in Rajasthan, and regulation of pasturelands is of utmost importance. In the pre-Independence era, Rajasthan was divided into small sub-states called Riyasats and each Riyasat was considered as a unit of development work. Villagers managed common lands without external intervention. Natural Resource Management was based on mutual agreement to follow a set of unwritten norms on animal grazing, penalty to encroachers etc. Under this system, there was control over cutting trees, encroaching on common land etc. But Post Independence, this system collapsed and the pasturelands came under the control of the village Panchayats. The Panchayats usually looked upon the village common lands as a source of income and did little to regulate use of the same. This led to malpractice and degradation of the pasturelands. GVNML initiated a programme to revive the degrading pasturelands in 1986. After much deliberation within the organisation as well as discussions with agriculture experts, GVNML decided to implement what came to be known as the chauka system. Though similar land management systems exist in Kenya, Somalia etc., the chauka system was the first of its kind to be implemented in Rajasthan. Literally translated, chauka means ‚Äòrectangular enclosure‚Äô. It's a small gradient enclosed by earthen bunds on three sides, which effectively traps rain water helping in recharging ground water. The ground velocity of rain water is checked in a chauka, leading to a significant reduction in soil erosion. When the water level in a chauka touches 9 inches, the rain water flows to the chauka at the immediately lower gradient. The water from the chaukas eventually drains into a channel that empties into a pond called nadi providing drinking water to the cattle. Agriculture Local farmers attempted to increase their produce using pesticides and chemical fertilizers. Overuse of the same led to increased cost of production and eventually lowered the productivity of the soil. GVNML has aided farming communities in 94 villages of the Jaipur, Tonk, Dausa, Pali, Jodhpur and Barmer districts of Rajasthan in building field bunds. Most farmers in the region cannot afford to construct field bunds even though lack of bunds leads to soil erosion. Besides preventing soil erosion, field bunds also help in reducing the salinity of the soil. The organization also took up projects to construct rain water harvesting structures in various districts. Nadas are constructed to harvest rain water in large catchment areas on private land and the stored water can be used to irrigate fields further in the downstream. Nadas, ponds, Anicuts and local water bodies (talabs) are seen to increase the agricultural productivity of the land. GVNML promotes sustainable organic farming without the use of pesticides and chemical fertilizers. The organization spreads awareness in the agricultural community about bio-compost and bio-insecticides. GVNML organizes demonstration-based training session for farmers to spread awareness on sustainable agricultural practices. Sessions have been organized on compost treatment, seed selection and treatment, weed control etc. Village Information Centers (VICs) have been established for capacitating village communities by providing required information as and when required. VICs have aided in sustainable community development of by enabling people to avail of government sponsored subsidized schemes for vermi-compost and drip irrigation. Water management With population increase some see mechanical farming as the only way to feed their families, regardless of the long term environmental effects. Much of the GVNML operational area is downstream from Sambhar Salt Lake, where, unless ground water can be recharged farmers have to rely on salt water for irrigation. This water has high levels of Total Dissolved Solubles (TDS) leading to reduced soil fertility. These area specific problems are coupled with droughts leading to real challenges for sustainably managing natural resources. The community has been hit hard by the repercussions of declining agriculture. Against an average rainfall of 600 mm, Laporiya gets only 323 mm When the monsoon does come, it is essential to carry out surface water storage to establish moisture, provide drinking water for animals, domestic use and gravity flow irrigation. Most villages have a large water holding structure, or talab to use either for irrigation or recharging ground water. Village tube wells with hand pumps and open wells can only function if the recharging structures are in place. Drinking water supplies are fully dependent on ground water, and agriculture relies on it for 80% of its needs, so it must be recharged. Without an adequate management system some families purchase power pumps to irrigate their fields from the talabs, therefore certain talabs are set aside only for recharging drinking water. These are kept clean, sanitized and undisturbed. Garbage pits have been constructed next to the talabs to ensure waste in not dumped in the talab. If a talab has been set aside for irrigation, it is ensured that the water is shared equally, by numbering each field such that everyone gets a turn. One of the main lakes created in this process for instance (Annasagar) helped the contiguous farms earn an annual revenue of INR 3.6 Million last year. Man-made ponds (Nadas and Nadis), and anicuts are built to use ground water for irrigating surrounding fields, and can also be cultivated because of the moisture locked inside them. Nadis can store overflow water from the chauka system, used on common property resources. The Village Development Committee (VDC), guided by GVNML, carries out village level surface and ground water management, setting rules, enforcing and renewing them. Rules forbid the installation of power pumps at drinking water sources and surface water harvesting structures. In some villages the selling of ground water is banned, and private wells cannot be constructed. =Reproductive health= Maternal and Child Health conditions in rural Rajasthan are extremely poor with high mother and infant mortality rates during pregnancy and birth. Health issues exist due to illiteracy amongst women, poor sanitation, lack of health care centers, deep rooted local belief in superstition and poverty. Child marriage leads to early pregnancy which often proves fatal for mother and infant. Lack of nutrition can lead to anemia and malnourished infants. Frequent pregnancies and deliveries by untrained birth attendants add to the problem. GVNML started working in the rural health sector in 1985. The organization focuses chiefly on awareness generation in the community on all aspects of health, nutrition, vaccination etc. In particular GVNML promotes institutional delivery to ensure safe childbirth. Training camps are regularly organised to train traditional birth attendants ( Dais) GVNML has organised health camps and formed village health groups in around 200 villages of Jaipur, Tonk, Pali and Sawaimadhopur districts with the financial aid of Catholic Relief Services, Mac-Aurther Foundation, UNICEF, Save the Children Finland and National Rural Heath Mission. A vaccination schedule is prepared for pregnant women and infants and vaccination camps are held for their benefit in accordance with the schedule. GVNML has undertaken distribution of nutrition supplements to pregnant women, lactating women and their infants. In 8 villages GVNML has set up two maternity centers run by a paramedic staff to provide treatment services and deliveries. Awareness camps on HIV/AIDS have also been held in many villages. GVNML creates awareness about Reproductive Health through discussions at Village Health Groups, Adolescent groups and women‚Äôs Self Help Groups. Events such as Nutrition Day, World Breast Feeding Day, World Health Day and International Women‚Äôs Day are celebrated by GVNML to raise awareness towards health as well as social issues. =Child rights= Around 10-25% of the children in GVNML‚Äôs operational area are engaged in child labour. Most of these children belong to the perceived ‚Äòlower‚Äô castes and belong to financially challenged families. Labour usually involves animal grazing, agricultural work, household work, daily wage earning, working in shops etc. In the 7-13 age group, the number of girls engaged in labour exceeds that of boys. Other violations of child rights in rural Rajasthan include child marriage, sexual and physical abuse of children and sexual discrimination. Many families refrain from sending their children, especially children to school. GVNML has been working for children‚Äôs rights since 1984. The organisation aims for all round development of children while ensuring they have claim to their basic rights. From 1984 to 1992 GVNML ran Gwal Bal Pathshaala, a night school for children who were engaged in animal grazing or other forms of labour during the day, and hence unable to attend school during the day. GVNML worked in the Tonk district on different schemes for children‚Äôs development such as Family Upliftment Programme, Child Survival and Development Programme, Right of Children to Safe Drinking Water etc. Save the Children Finland and UNICEF Rajasthan extended their support to GVNML for the aforementioned projects. GVNML works in collaboration with the Gram Panchayat in several villages to spread awareness about the importance of birth registration. Educational events are organized for the recreation of local children. Bal Sansad (Child Parliament), Bal Patrika (published children‚Äôs magazine), Bal Mela (Child Fair) and cultural programmes by children have had local impact in helping children hone their creative skills and expanding their knowledge on many subjects. GVNML is also involved in the process of mainstreaming the students of Gwal Bal Pathshaalas (informal night schools) to Government schools. GVNML has also organised training sessions for Primary School Teachers and Instructors of Gwal Bal Pathshaalas in the villages of Jaipur and Tonk districts.

In 2001 Masovia was re- established in Potsdam. History The Mazovian people represented a unique minority. They were Lutheran Protestants, commonly spoke Polish and devoted themselves to the Prussian kings. Even after the Second World War they declared themselves as Germans. The Protestant pastors, many of them corps members, helped to preserve this heritage. In the 19th century most corps members came from and returned to the remote and poor, but wonderful land. 500 corps members had had their education in Lyck and Rastenburg. The Mazovian people considered the Corps Masovia as theirs and took over the blue-white-red flag. In 1855 Friedrich Dewischeit, a Mazovian teacher, composed songs about Masovia. Dedicated to the Corps Masovia, the Masurenlied still is the hymn of the Mazovian people. The Corps Masovia was founded in June 1830 and until 1935 played an important role at the K√∂nigsberg university. On occasion of the centenary in 1930, the Mazovian mayors donated a library cupboard with the arm coats of their 30 towns. =Prussian heritage= Masovia in Karzer, University of Greifswald (1893) In East Prussia many pastors, teachers, judges, physicians, civil servants and mayors proudly showed Masovia's colours, i.e. light blue, white and fire-red. 15 members of the Prussian Parliament (Abgeordnetenhaus) were corps members, three conservatives and twelve liberals. Two sat in the Prussian House of Lords, four in the Reichstag. Jews and Catholic priests, French and Polish members illustrate Masovia's unconstricted freedom of spirit. 115 corps members fell in both world wars. In the First World War six obtained the K√∂nigliche Hausorden von Hohenzollern (prestage of the Pour le M√©rite). In the Second World War three had the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, one with Oak Leaves. In 1935 Masovia had to resign herself to the Nazi rules of academic life. In January 1950 Masovia joined the Corps Palaiomarchia which had been expelled from Halle (Saale) and restituted in Kiel. When it became evident that this had not been a formal restitution Masovia re-established herself in Potsdam, just 300 years after Prussia becoming a kingdom.

Taxonomy The genus was created by Thomas de Grey, 6th Baron Walsingham in 1881 to house the new species Idioglossa bigemma. Because Lord Walsingham had created a monotypic genus at the time, the species I. bigemma is considered the type species by monotypy. The next year, in 1882, Lord Walsingham proposed to rename the taxon as Idiostoma, because he considered the name inappropriate, but by the rules of taxonomy this is considered unnecessary. The Australian entomologist Ian Francis Bell Common classified it in the subfamily Stathmopodinae of the family Oecophoridae in 1996.

It was alarmed by such measures and their impact on the maintenance of peace and security between Eritrea and Ethiopia. The Security Council reaffirmed the role of the Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) as provided for in the Algiers Agreement, and stressed that peace could not be achieved without the demarcation of their mutual border. There was also concern at the failure of the Ethiopian government to accept the binding decision of the boundary commission, and the high concentration of troops on both sides of the TSZ. =Acts= The Council condemned restrictions placed by Eritrea on its UNMEE mission, and demanded their full reversal. It called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to exercise restraint and refrain from threats and the use of force, and to return their deployment of forces to 16 December 2004 levels.

Fernandes trained as a navigator in Spain at the famed Casa de Contrataci√≥n in Seville, but later took up arms against the Spanish empire, preying upon Spanish shipping along with fellow pirate John Callis. Charged with piracy in 1577, he was saved from the hangman's noose by Sir Francis Walsingham, becoming a Protestant and a subject of the Queen of England. In 1578 Fernandes entered the service of Sir Humphrey Gilbert and later Sir Walter Raleigh, piloting the failed 1587 expedition to Roanoke, known to history as the \\"Lost Colony\\". Fernandes disappears from the records after 1590, when he sailed with an English fleet to the Azores, a journey from which he most likely did not return alive. However, a copy of one of his charts of the East coast of North America still survives in the Cotton Collection, and was probably one of the chief sources used by John Dee for his 1580 map justifying English claims to North America. Early life Fernandes was born Sim√£o Fernandes in c.1538 in Terceira in the Portuguese colony of the Azores. He received his navigational training in Spain, at the renowned Casa de Contrataci√≥n pilot training school in Seville,Miller, p. 64.

Retrieved April 2011 Career =Pirate= Sir Francis Walsingham saved Fernandes from the hangman's noose. At some point Fernandes severed his loyalty to the Spanish crown and in the 1570s he took up a career in piracy, operating out of South Wales in association with the notorious pirate John Callis, preying upon Spanish shipping. England was at peace with Spain at this time and piracy was an offence punishable by hanging, but in practice Fernandes was engaged in exactly the sort of behaviour to which Queen Elizabeth I of England was inclined to turn a blind eye. However, the Portuguese ambassador Francisco Giraldi vigorously protested Fernandes's activities to the Queen's ministers, after the alleged murder of seven Portuguese sailors, and in 1577 the 39-year-old Fernandes was arrested in Cardiff and taken to London to face trial.Miller, p. 171. Retrieved April 2011 However, far from being hanged for his crimes, Fernandes was released, apparently with the connivance of Queen Elizabeth's spymaster Sir Francis Walsingham, who appears to have been well aware of the Portuguese navigator's potential usefulness in challenging the Spanish trade monopoly in the New World. Certainly Giraldi blamed Walsingham, excoriating him and demanding justice for his country's dead sailors. The fact was that Fernandes likely had more experience of navigating the Indies than almost any man in England, making him a unique asset to the early English voyages of discovery in the New World. =Navigator= Fernandes' patron, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, c. 1583 John White of the Roanoke area c. 1585 In 1578, the year following his arrest and release, Fernandes was appointed pilot to Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who was planning an expedition to colonise the Americas with the backing of Walsingham. Fernandes was of course well known to the Spanish authorities, who did not approve of his activities. In 1578 the Spanish Ambassasor wrote to King Philip II of Spain, referring to Gilbert's proposed voyage of discovery: : \\"They are taking with them one Simon Fernandes, a Portuguese, a thorough- paced scoundrel, who has given and is giving them much information about that coast, which he knows very well. As I am told, he has done no little damage to the King of Portugal...\\" Wallis, p. 195. Retrieved April 2011 In 1580 Gilbert sailed to America in the Squirrel, piloted by Fernandes, apparently making the Atlantic crossing in record time.Miller, p. 71. Retrieved April 2011 Undoubtedly he was a skilled navigator, trained by the inestimable Thomas Harriot in the latest navigational tools, and \\"not without almost incredible results\\". During the voyage he shocked the ship's chaplain, Richard Madox of Oxford, by announcing that he was \\"at war with the King of Spain\\". Asked how this could be, since Fernandez was by now a subject of the Queen, and therefore officially at peace with the Spanish empire, Fernandes replied that he had a \\"free pardon from five Privy Councillors for carrying on the war with Spain\\".Miller, p. 174. Retrieved April 2011 In 1583 Sir Humphrey Gilbert was drowned returning from a journey to Newfoundland. Fernandes was now without a patron, and he soon entered the service of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had inherited his half-brother's Patent of Discovery in Virginia. Fernandes was undoubtedly a skilled sailor but he appears to have been unpopular among his fellow explorers. He served as master and chief pilot to Raleigh's 1585 expedition to Roanoke, which was led by Sir Richard Grenville, returning to England later that year. During the course of the voyage, his shipmates dubbed him \\"the swine\\",Milton, p.201 though it is possible that his fellow sailors simply objected to a foreigner (and a former subject of Spain at that) being elevated to such a senior position in the voyage.Kupperman, p. 17. Retrieved April 2011 =The Lost Colony= Fernandes' patron, Sir Walter Raleigh In May 1587 Fernandes piloted a new expedition, a group of colonists led by governor John White which sailed for Virginia in The Lion. This time White and his fellow settlers included women and children, with a view to establishing a permanent colony in Virginia. White and Fernandes evidently disliked one another, and White's journal reveals his arguments with his pilot, accusing the Portuguese of many outrages against the interests of the settlers, including \\"lewdly\\" abandoning the expedition's flyboat in the course of the voyage.Kupperman, p. 109. Retrieved April 2011 In 1587 the settlers' chosen destination was not Roanoke but the Chesapeake Bay but, on reaching Roanoake in late July, and allowing the colonists to disembark, Fernandes refused to let White's men re-board ship. According to White's journal, Fernandes' deputy \\"called to the sailors in the pinesse, charging them not to bring any of the planters back againe, but leave them on the island\\".Milton, p. 215 Faced with what amounted to a mutiny by his navigator, White appears to have backed down and acquiesced in this sudden change of plan. Despite the governor's protests, Fernandes held that \\"summer was farre spent, wherefore hee would land all the planters in no other place.\\".Milton, p.216 Fernandes's motive for landing the colonists in the wrong spot is not clear, but it may be that he was prompted by his desire (and that of his crew) to return to the West Indies to pursue opportunities for privateering against Spanish shipping.Kupperman, p. 111. Retrieved April 2011 If Governor White's journal is to be believed, Fernandes' actions appear to have contributed to the poor outcome of the settlement, known to history as the \\"Lost Colony\\". Indeed, some modern historians (notably Lee Miller)Miller, p. 69. Retrieved April 2011 have suggested that he may have deliberately intended to sabotage the entire enterprise.Winkler, p. 36. Retrieved April 2011 However, if this was the case then (as Miller herself concedes) his motives for doing so remain unclear. Miller does however suggest a motive, not for Fernandes himself, but for Walsingham. In somewhat oblique language Miller suggests that the colony may have become a victim of court politics; Walsingham's jealousy at Raleigh's spectacular rise led him to sabotage the colony. In this analysis, Fernandes appears as Walsingham's tool, willing and able to defeat the plans of his master's rival.Miller, p. 191 Whatever the truth of this, the fiasco of 1587 appears to have ended Fernandes' relationship with Raleigh. He participated in no further ventures across the Atlantic, though he did take part in the battle against the Spanish Armada.Milton, p. 270 He disappears from the records after 1590, when he sailed with an English fleet to the Azores, a journey which he most likely did not survive.Milton, p. 271 Legacy A copy of one of Fernandes' charts of the East coast of North America still survives in the Cotton Collection, cotton roll XIII.48. This map appears to be one of the chief sources used by John Dee for his 1580 map which he prepared for the Queen, justifying English claims to all of North America north of Florida.

Retrieved 8 April 2011.SITRA: Innovative Technologies for Clean Innovation.\\". Retrieved 8 April 2011. The network aims to bring together expertise from Finland's clean technology industry and research and to support clean technology companies internationally. Cleantech Finland is owned by the Confederation of Finnish Industries (Finnish: Elinkeinoel√§m√§n keskusliitto or EK). Cleantech Finland's concept is based on the Finland‚Äôs \\"national action plan for environmental business\\", which has been developed by representatives of the Finnish Government, such as the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry (now the Ministry of Employment and the Economy), the Ministry of Environment, other research and innovation agencies, environmental organisations and universities in 2006. The ownership of Cleantech Finland was moved from SITRA to the Confederation of Finnish Industries in December 2008. Cleantech Finland's digital expert service Solved spun-off as an independent company in September 2013.  Strategy  The Strategic Cleantech Programme of the Government of Prime Minister Jyrki Katainen was launched in 2012. The strategic goal of the programme is for Finland to be known as a global superpower of cleantech in 2020. The numerical goals for the strategic cleantech programme by 2020 as defined in the strategy of May 2014 are: ‚ñ™ to raise cleantech companies‚Äô turnover to EUR 50 billion, of which exports account for over 75% ‚ñ™ to double the cleantech home market to about EUR 20 billion ‚ñ™ to raise the number of cleantech companies from 2000 to about 3000 ‚ñ™ to create at least 40,000 jobs in clean technology in Finland.  Management  Cleantech Finland is managed by Finpro (an association providing internationalization services for Finnish small and middle-sized enterprises), and through Finpro‚Äôs global network, Cleantech Finland has offices in 40 countries. Cleantech Finland seeks to provide a contact and cooperation platform for clean technology companies and organizations operating in following clean technology branches: * Water  Efficient use of water  Purification  Waste water treatment * Energy  CHP  Energy efficiency  Biomass & bioenergy  Renewable energy  Smart grid * Waste  Industrial waste management  Logistics  Recycling  Waste-to-energy * Built- environment  Air quality  Energy management systems  Low-energy housing  Smart mobility  Urban planning  Purpose  The purpose of Cleantech Finland is to provide a global network of clean technology expertise. In Finland alone, the highly diversified cleantech sector comprises approximately 2,000 enterprises. Cleantech Finland serves as an umbrella corporation and coordinator in internationalization efforts, such as conferences and seminars. Additionally, it aims to build contacts between environmental technology companies and national ‚Äì as well as international ‚Äì stakeholders. In order to support its member organizations in financing their environmental research projects, Cleatech Finland is co-operating closely with numerous government- backed innovations support and finance organizations, of which the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation (Tekes) and Finnish Innovation Fund (SITRA) are the most notable.  Background  = Cleantech Industry = Cleantech is a concept, which comprises knowledge-based products and services that improve operational performance in terms of sustainable development by using limited or zero non-renewable resources and creating significantly less waste than conventional technologies. A driving force behind cleantech concept is the growing concern of corporations and consumers about climate change and environment, energy costs, as well as energy security.PriceWaterhouseCoopers (2008): \\"Cleantech Comes of Age\\". Retrieved 8 April 2011. Motored by political, environmental, and economic developments, the industry has globally attracted increasing amount of venture capital investments with strong exit potential and it has brought new technologies to the markets. International Energy Agency (IEA) calculates that the world will need to spend $46 trillion between now and 2050 to be sure half of all electricity comes from renewable sources. This includes improving energy efficiency. = Clean technologies in Finland = Finland‚Äôs greenhouse gas emissions per capita and energy consumption per capita are both one of the highest in the world. This is particularly due to energy intensive industry (particularly paper and pulp industry), cold climate, and long distances. Finland has no natural oil and gas reserves, and also hydropower capacity is in comparison to neighboring Norway and Sweden. Energy efficiency and energy security issues combined with the Finns‚Äô economic dependency on clean nature have forced the Finns to seek for innovative energy and other green technology solutions. Finland has been a leading innovator across multiple sectors. R&D; investments amount to roughly 4 per cent of GDP, positioning Finland as having the third-highest R&D; funding of any country in the world as a percentage of GDP. That funding is targeted at cutting edge opportunities, especially in power electronics, clean combustion technologies, and environmental monitoring and utilizing ICT in cleantech. The total turnover of the Finnish cleantech industry was up to 25.8 billion euros (35.8 billion U.S. dollars) in 2013, after a 15 percent surge in 2012.

Although the holistic dental community is diverse in its practices and approaches, common threads include strong opposition to the use of amalgam in materials in dental fillings, nonsurgical approaches to gum disease, and the belief that root canals may endanger systemic health of the patient through the spread of trapped dental bacteria to the body. Many dentists who use these terms also regard water fluoridation unfavorably. Many practices and opinions among alternative dentists are criticized as not being evidence-based by the mainstream dental community and skeptics of alternative medicine in general. Generally speaking, such dentists charge far more for the same dental treatment compared to mainstream dentists, as they consider themselves to be providing specialized care. The Holistic Dental Network defines the field as: \\"an approach to Dentistry that promotes health and wellness instead of the treatment of disease. This approach to Dentistry encompasses both modern science and knowledge drawn from the worlds great traditions on natural healing...Holistic Dentistry acknowledges and deals with the mind, body, and spirit of the patient, not just his or her \\"Teeth\\". They attempt to coin the following basic principles as being unique to holistic dentistry: *Proper nutrition for the prevention and reversal of degenerative dental disease *Avoidance and elimination of toxins from dental materials *Prevention and treatment of dental malocclusion (bite problems=physical imbalance) *Prevention and treatment of gum disease at its biological basis The Holistic Dental Association writes of that organization's founding: \\"In 1978, concerned, dedicated dentists came together to share their common interest in treatment modalities that were not included in dental school curriculum. Some of these modalities were very new and others were very old; the one thing that they shared in common was they offered additional options for treatment. These dentists wished to establish an organization that would provide a forum for the development and sharing of health promoting therapies. A shift from the early emphasis of the dentist on modalities to a consideration of the attitudes and feelings of the patient and the dentist has occurred. But the primary goal to teach and to learn has not changed since the founding members first met.\\" Criticisms Practitioners of holistic or biological dentistry can vary a great deal in terms of the techniques and services they offer. While many conventional dentists recognize there is significant merit to different preventative approaches to dentistry, some of these dentists have criticized holistic practices for lack of efficacy of approach and false marketing in their practices. A significant part of the critique of holistic dentistry is related to the unsubstantiated use of certain services and treatments, many of which have either been investigated and found ineffective, or have not been researched enough to be declared safe and effective for practice. For example, herbal remedies are often recommended in the form of mouthwash and toothpaste in order to prevent or treat certain dental conditions. They are supposedly safer products because they are ‚Äònatural‚Äô. However, there is a lack of scientific research which supports such treatments, and in fact herbal remedies have been found to impact the safety of more invasive or prolonged dental procedures, and can lead to additional complications if they interact with a patient‚Äôs current medications. However, some traditional herbal dental techniques, such as the use of the Miswak stick has been shown to be of possible effectiveness. However, the realm of herbal dental hygiene remains a largely understudied realm, and further rigorous scientific evaluations will be necessary to determine the efficacy of different methods. Some critics of holistic dentistry practice also note that the fees charged by such practitioners are generally several times higher than those of mainstream dentists. Some claim that alternative dentistry is merely the exploitation of niche health beliefs and gimmicks to justify higher fees. A potential example of this is the Cavitat, a non validated ultrasound device purported to be able to detect alleged lesions described \\"cavitations\\" (see: neuralgia-inducing cavitational osteonecrosis), or the non evidence based utilization of breathing apparatus by certain \\"biologic dentists\\" during removal of amalgam fillings, intended to reduce mercury toxicity by eliminating inhaled airborne material. However, others argue that such practices are not representative of the entire field of holistic dentistry.

Esteban was Raoul's boon companion in the days of their youthful indiscretions. Also present are Raoul's young secretary, Jacques Rijar, and confessor, Father Clement. Raoul toasts the young couple, urging them to live with \\"clarity of purpose and humility of spirit\\".Coward, p. 184 Esteban thinks his old friend has become overserious, and his own advice to the couple is, \\"Enjoy yourselves as much as possible; it will pass the time pleasantly and lead you into old age with a few gay memories to cheer you\\".Coward, pp. 185‚Äì186 During Esteban's speech Jacques abruptly leaves the room. The young people go out on the terrace, and Father Clement says good night, leaving the two old friends together. Under the influence of his late wife and her confessor, Raoul has settled down into respectable dullness, and he is uncomfortable when Esteban reminisces about their misspent youth. Raoul admits to one real love-affair, about which Esteban never knew, but before he can say more Miguel and Adrienne return. The older men go into the library. Adrienne is not in high spirits: she tells Miguel that he does not really love her. He admits it: he is in love with a dancer in Paris. She confides that she is in love with her father's secretary. Miguel promises to help her, and when Jacques comes in he leaves them together. They embrace passionately but briefly before Esteban comes back with Raoul, to take his leave. When Adrienne has gone to bed, Raoul reproves Jacques for leaving the table during the Duke's speech. Jacques answers his employer recklessly, accusing him of being \\"Afraid ‚Äì of youth ‚Äì afraid of life ‚Äì afraid of suffering ‚Äì afraid of happiness\\".Coward, p. 201 Raoul angrily replies that Jacques has taken leave of his senses, and tells him to go to bed. Raoul remains, gazing at a portrait of his late wife, until he is startled by a tapping at the terrace window. He opens it, and the Marquise de Kestournel steps in, exquisitely dressed for travelling. She is the woman with whom he had his one genuine love affair in his youth, and he had believed her to be dead. After a brief exchange about minor matters, she asks, \\"Where is my child?\\" He replies that her child is dead ‚Äì \\"as far as you are concerned.\\"Coward, p. 204 Adrienne, he says, believes that his wife was her mother. He asks Eloise why she has sprung this surprise on him. Saying she has come back for good, she shows him a letter he wrote to her at the time of their parting, in which he said that, if ever she felt weary and alone, he would always be waiting for her. He replies that his wife changed him completely: he has repented of his loose living and now has faith and peace and nobility of purpose. Eloise walks out. He calls after her, but she has gone. He unlocks a cabinet and takes out a box containing a packet of Eloise's letters, trinkets and other mementos. He smashes it open and flings the contents into the fire. Roused by the noise, Adrienne comes down. Her father sharply orders her to go back to bed; she refuses, saying firmly that she wants to talk to him: she will not marry Miguel because she loves Jacques Rijar. Having declared that Jacques will be dismissed, the Count appeals to her in the name of her \\"dear dead mother\\".Coward, p. 214 Adrienne says furiously that her mother cared nothing for either of them. \\"She only loved herself and God and Father Clement\\". She adds that Raoul's life is a pretence ‚Äì he does not love her, or he would not force her to marry against her will. So adds that he can send her to a convent but she will not marry Miguel. As she sobs the front door bell clangs, and the servant Hubert ushers in \\"Madame la Marquise de Kestournel\\". Eloise, followed by her maid Alice, stands in the doorway. She greets Raoul formally as though a stranger, explaining that her coach has lost a wheel and she is obliged to ask hospitality for the night. Raoul refuses it, saying there is no room, but his daughter (encouraged by Hubert, who has recognised the Marquise) insists that she shall stay. =Act II= The next morning Miguel calls, in response to a note from Adrienne, who is distraught because her father is dismissing Jacques. Miguel consoles her, promising to seek his father's help, and goes to find Esteban. Jacques is dejected, believing it his duty to renounce Adrienne; she begs him not to go away immediately. As they go out to the terrace, Eloise enters. She exchanges a few words with Hubert, who is pleased to see her back, and tells her that both the Count and his daughter are in need of cheering up. Father Clement brings a message from Raoul, regretting that a headache will prevent him from saying goodbye to her before she leaves; she ignores the hint. Adrienne re- enters. Eloise has taken an immediate liking to her, and a candid exchange follows in which Adrienne tells Eloise about her difficulties. She slips off as her father appears. He is in a bad temper and bids Eloise go at once, repeating that she is sinful and shall not enter his life again; she can go back to her own house. She replies that her house is sold, so sure was she that he would welcome her with open arms, and honour his old promise. She hands him a document, which he throws into the fire thinking it is his letter; she then tells him she has given him her dressmaker's bill by mistake. He leaves the room in a fury. As Jacques comes downstairs, dressed for travelling and carrying a large bag, Eloise stops him, tells him to stay, and promises that she will find him work and help him win Adrienne. He goes back upstairs just as Esteban is announced. At the sight of each other, Esteban and Eloise are astonished. They fall into each other's arms, and she asks him for news of her child, Fran√ßois. Esteban explains that the boy was re-named Miguel, and realising that this is Adrienne's fianc√©, Eloise goes into gales of hysterical laughter. It becomes clear (although not yet to Esteban) that she had had affairs with Esteban and later Raoul with neither man knowing about the other, and that Miguel and Adrienne are half-brother and -sister. Unlike Raoul, Esteban is warmly disposed to his former lover, and they vow to be good friends. Having recovered his temper, Raoul comes to say that he is taking Adrienne away to Paris; meanwhile, his house is at the service of Madame la Marquise. Esteban invites Eloise to have supper with him, and leaves. After a last appeal to Raoul not to make Adrienne marry Miguel, Eloise takes matters into her own hands. She sends for Father Clement, and at pistol point forces him to marry Adrienne to Jacques; Raoul furiously bangs in vain at the locked door. =Act III= Later the same day Raoul is seated alone at supper. He sends for Hubert, calls for cognac, and drinks copiously. When Esteban comes to take Eloise to supper, he is surprised to find Raoul still in residence, and taken aback when his staid friend professes a longing for Paris, the city of sin: \\"Vivid, scarlet sin ‚Äì it warms one up, you know\\".Coward, p. 256 Hubert tells Esteban that the Marquise and Father Clement have both left, and Adrienne has married Jacques and gone to Paris with him. Not entirely sober, Raoul addresses his wife's portrait, saying that he forgives her for being \\"a determined and unmitigated bore\\".Coward, p. 259 He drinks black coffee to clear his head, and he confirms Hubert's account of the morning's events. Esteban and Raoul compare notes and discover that Eloise has had an affair, and a child, with each. The two men drink to her damnation. As they do so, she quietly enters from the terrace, where she has been listening. Both men accuse her of having deceived and betrayed them. She responds that she is expecting one or the other to marry her. Raoul loses his temper, accuses Esteban of being a traitor and a hypocrite, and slaps his face. This leads to a duel; Raoul sends Hubert to fetch a rapier, the furniture is pushed back, and Esteban draws his sword. Eloise sits at the side on a spinet, eating an orange and urging the combatants on (\\"Really, considering your joint ages, you're doing magnificently!\\").Coward, p. 269 When she decides they have fought enough, she throws an embroidered cloth over their blades and commands them to stop. Esteban is still angry, but she tells him that if he slaps Raoul's face it will be a quid pro quo and honour will be satisfied. He does so, lightly, and bursts out laughing. The two men embrace. Having reconciled them, Eloise reveals that she has never been married ‚Äì they were the only two men in her life, and for the past sixteen years she has lived an entirely virtuous existence ‚Äì \\"in this depraved age it's rather humiliating to admit it\\" ‚Äì earning a successful living as a singer.Coward, p. 271 Her reason for leaving Esteban was to prevent his family from disinheriting him and ruining his career; she left Raoul because he never once suggested marriage to her. Esteban chivalrously offers her his hand; Eloise makes no immediate reply, and Raoul suddenly exclaims that he loves her. He walks out to the terrace. Esteban is plainly relieved that her choice will fall on Raoul. She kisses him good night, and he leaves them. Eloise sits down at the spinet and begins to play, as Raoul comes in again. He tells her, \\"I mean what I said. I do love you\\",Coward, p. 275 and she replies that it has \\"been obvious since the first moment I came into the house\\". He rests his head on her shoulder as the curtain falls. Critical reception The theatre critic of The Morning Post called the play \\"a very amusing and well-constructed piece ‚Ä¶ the first of Mr. Coward's plays to have a good first act\\". His only complaint about the piece was the love scene between Adrienne and Jacques: \\"Mr Coward still cannot write an effective love scene; his imagination is defeated when he cannot be flippant about the mating of true lovers. In time, no doubt, his innate sincerity will enable him to conquer such scenes, but that time is not yet, and I am obliged frankly to say that what should have been a fragrant interlude was tiresomely banal\\". He found the rest of the play \\"delicious and done with dexterity and delicacy\\".The Morning Post, 17 February 1927, quoted in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 103 In The Manchester Guardian, Ivor Brown thought the play a \\"dried and brittle little piece\\", made successful chiefly by Marie Tempest's \\"genius\\".Brown, Ivor. \\"La Marquise: Mr Coward's Period Piece\\", The Manchester Guardian, 17 February 1927, p. 14 The Daily Telegraph found the play \\"flaming and theatrical and deft in the extreme ‚Ä¶ written with a sense of style\\".Quoted in The Play Pictorial, January 1927, p. 25 The Daily Mail thought \\"Mr Noel Coward has done far, far better things than this\\", and thought the best thing about the play was that \\"Miss Tempest is given such ample opportunities to exploit her delectable personality\\". The Times thought the third act weak, finding that after the climax of the second act, with the marriage at pistol-point, the duel and reconciliations of Act III did not engage the attention.\\"Criterion Theatre\\", The Times, 17 February 1927, p. 12 Punch also praised the first two acts but found the last act weak.\\"At the Play\\", Punch, 23 February 1927, pp. 217‚Äì218 Much of this criticism was echoed by Coward. He had not been able to attend rehearsals and saw the piece for the first time on the second night of the run; he later wrote: Revivals and adaptations In the US in the 1940s Lilian Gish played Eloise in an out-of- town production, which she wanted to bring into New York, but was prevented from doing so by a veto from Coward, for reasons that are not recorded.Hoare, p. 373 A British touring production in 2004 starred Kate O'Mara, Michael Jayston and Denis Lill.Edmonds, Richard. \\"Coward is still able to spring surprises\\", The Birmingham Post, 25 February 2004 The BBC broadcast the play in December 1969 as part of the celebrations of Coward's seventieth birthday.

HOPE deals with offenders who have been identified as likely to violate the conditions of their probation or community supervision. HOPE participants include offenders who have committed a violent crime, including sex offenders and domestic violence offenders, reaching a demographic of abusers untouched by Drug Court programs. Unlike Drug Court and other substance-abuse treatment programs, HOPE does not attempt to impose drug treatment on every participant. Under HOPE, probationers receive drug treatment only if they continue to test positive for drug use or if they request a treatment referral. HOPE employs a warning hearing notifying offenders at the onset that detected violations will have consequences; conducts frequent and random drug tests; responds to detected violations - including failed drug tests and skipped probation meetings - with swift, certain and appropriate terms of incarceration; responds to absconding probationers with quickly enforced warrant service and sanctions; and mandates drug treatment only upon request or for those probationers who do not abstain from drug use while on the testing and sanctions regimen. HOPE model The HOPE model was started by Hawaii State Judiciary First Circuit Court Judge Steven Alm in an effort to address what he viewed as a farcical probation system. It was often seen that drug-offenders would violate their probation, despite the relatively relaxed guidelines of their punishment. The punishment for violating these rules was often slow and cumbersome. To address the high rates of recidivism, Judge Steven Alm focused on delivering swift, certain and proportionate sanctions to those who failed to comply with the rules. HOPE participants received randomized and frequent drug tests throughout the duration of the program. Probationers are warned that if they test positive for drugs they will be arrested immediately, and warrants issued immediately for probationers who miss an appointment or a drug test. Those found guilty face a short stint in jail - usually starting with a few days but increasing with repeated violations. =Warning Hearings= Participation in a HOPE \\"Warning Hearing\\" is the mandatory first step for a person after being recommended by his or her probation officer and being accepted by the judge. The warning hearings take place in a group format in open court. The probationers, with their attorneys, and the prosecutor appear in person before the judge, who impresses on each probationer the importance of compliance and the certainty of consequences for noncompliance. HOPE probationers are warned that positive drug tests and/or admissions to drug and/or alcohol use will result in an immediate, on-the-spot arrest, and missing a drug test or a probation appointment will result in the immediate issuance of a bench warrant. Also, HOPE probationers are told they are expected to acknowledge when they have violated and not to abscond from the system. Absconding offenders will face harsher sanctions than those who do not run away. During the hearing, the judge emphasizes personal responsibility and the hope of all involved that the probationer succeed. =Drug Testing Hotline= The Drug Testing Hotline is one of the major components of the HOPE Program. Probationers are required to call the hotline recording every weekday of their probation and listen for the randomly selected colors of the day. Colors are assigned to probationers for privacy and efficiency reasons, and are reassigned as probationers progress in the program and their colors are called less frequently. Probationers whose colors are named in the recording are required to report to the downtown Honolulu courthouse the same day for drug testing between 6:30AM and 2:30PM HST. The hotline is refreshed each day of the work week at 4:00AM HST. During the first two months of HOPE, a probationer's color is called six times a month, becoming less frequent as the program continues and dwindling to a minimum of once a month. Exceptions for weekdays in which the hotline is not in service are state holidays. To induce probationers to appear for testing even when they know their drug test will be positive, HOPE provides for more severe sanctions for those who abscond than for those who test dirty but admit and turn themselves in. To make the threat effective, law enforcement officers are available to promptly arrest those who failed to appear. = HOPE Probation Modification Hearings = A HOPE probation modification hearing is held shortly after a probationer has been arrested for violating the terms and conditions of his or her probation, often within two working days. High bail is set, and the probationer is usually confined in the interim. A probationer found to have violated the terms of probation is immediately sentenced to a short jail stay (typically several days servable on the weekend if employed, but increasing with continued non- compliance), with credit given for time served. The probationer resumes participation in HOPE and reports to his or her probation officers on the day of release. Unlike a probation revocation, a modification order does not sever the probation relationship. A probationer may request a treatment referral at any time, but probationers with multiple violations are mandated to intensive substance abuse treatment services (typically residential care). The court continues to supervise the probationer throughout the treatment experience and the probationer is still subject to court-ordered sanctions for noncompliance. HOPE history The HOPE program was launched in 2004 by Judge Steven Alm, currently a First Circuit Judge, in an effort to reduce probation violations by high risk offenders. Alm's inspiration stemmed from a mid-1990s presentation by David M. Kennedy about an intensely supervisional deterrence program for Boston youth gangs, called Operation Ceasefire. Mirroring the supervision aspect of Operation Ceasefire, Alm created HOPE Probation. The first HOPE Probation hearings, held October 1, 2004, had 18 sex offenders and 16 drug offenders. HOPE program results Only 10% of the HOPE probationers needed further drug treatment. In a 12-month follow-up study, 61% of HOPE probationers had zero positive drug tests, 20% had one positive drug test, 9% had two, 5% had three, and less than 5% had four or more.Hawken, Angela. Kleiman, Mark. Managing Drug Involved Probationers With Swift and Certain Sanctions: Evaluating Hawaii's HOPE Washington, DC: National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice, 2009. A randomized controlled study compared probationers assigned to HOPE (n = 330) to individuals assigned to regular probation (n = 163). After one year, HOPE probationers were 55% less likely to be arrested for a new crime, 72% less likely to use drugs, 61% less likely to miss appointments with their supervisory officers, and 53% less likely to have their probation revoked than those on regular probation. HOPE participants were sentenced on average to 48% fewer days of prison than regular probationers.Hawken, Angela. Kleiman, Mark. Managing Drug Involved Probationers With Swift and Certain Sanctions: Evaluating Hawaii's HOPE Washington, DC: National Institute of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, U.S. Department of Justice; 2009. When offenders are placed on Probation in Hawaii rather than being sent to prison, the probation period is now typically for 4 years. The court, pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) Sec. 706-624(2)(a), can impose a term of imprisonment not exceeding two years in Class A felony cases, eighteen months in Class B felony cases, and one year in Class C felony cases. If a court at any point revokes probation under HRS 706-625, the judge may impose on the defendant any sentence that might have been imposed originally for the crime of which the defendant was convicted. A person who is convicted of a Class A felony is subject to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of twenty years. A person sentenced to prison for a Class B felony is subject to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of ten years. A person sentenced to prison for a Class C felony is subject to an indeterminate term of imprisonment of five years. HOPE Probation requires close coordination among many different criminal justice system agencies. It requires the criminal justice professionals to work smarter and faster. Change is always hard. Issues about HOPE program A recent study has raised many issues about HOPE probation. In particular that study refers to the evidences of HOPE effectiveness brought by Hawkens and Kleiman as limited, while those are the main references used in this document. It identifies seven issues about the HOPE project: 1. An Over-Emphasis on a Potentially Weak Key Ingredient: 2. An Under-Emphasis on Active Ingredients 3. Failure to Identify Alternative Explanations for HOPE's Effectiveness 4. Over-Selling the Promise of Applicability for Other Jurisdictions 5. Delivering an Intervention That May be Inappropriate for Some Offenders 6. Focusing on Something That Might Not Matter 7. Opening a Pandora's Box through Punishment-Oriented Probation In developing these seven points, the authors have made the following arguments among others: a - \\"Notably, research also suggests that compared with leniency, harsher sanctions for technical violations, such as confinement, may actually be criminogenic (Clear, Harris, & Baird, 1992; Drake & Aos, 2012).\\" b - \\"Although Hawaii's HOPE program includes a variety of offenders (sex, property, assault), its evaluation studies have only been performed on drug-involved offender.\\" c - \\"James Finckenauer (1982) has used the term \\"panacea phenomenon\\" to describe initiatives that, with very little criminological or empirical scrutiny, arise, are quickly embraced, and are imposed on the wayward with very little understanding of their true impact.\\" d - \\"HOPE was designed to use revocation as a punishment of the last, rather than first, resort.\\" HOPE probation started around 2004 in the State of Hawaii. However no statistics for other classes of offenders under HOPE probation (sex, property, assault) than drug- related offenders from that State have ever been studied. When prison terms are given to avoid revocation they should remain within the legal boundaries (defined by Hawaii Revised Statute (HRS) 706-624-(2)-(a) in the State of Hawaii). The results reported in the previous section rely heavily on the work of Hawkens and Kleiman, who are not criminologists, but faculty members of a School of Public Policy. Hawkens' graduate program ranks 87-th among the Graduate programs of US schools of public policy.

Andrew Quinn had a remarkable college career with St. Flannan's, winning Munster under-15 hurling and football, Munster under-16 hurling and football, Dean Ryan and Frewen Cups, and won two Dr. Harty cups and one all Ireland in 2000 and denied a third Harty Cup in 2001. At club he won Minor A championship in 2000. He is also a county club championship medalist with Tulla. He contributed high scores on the path to final scoring 1-43 and contested Munster Club and Clare Cup finals after. At the college level he collected a Fitzgibbon Medal with Ul. In 2007 when Tulla reached the final of the county championship for the first time in almost seventy-five years. Crusheen, a team whichhad never won the title, provided the opposition. Quinn's brother Brian scored a crucial goal as Tulla secured a 1-7 to 0-9 victory. His brother Mark played at centre back and another brother Karl was a substitute. The victory gave Quinn a Clare Senior Hurling Championship medal. Inter-county Quinn first came to prominence on the inter-county scene at under-age levels with Clare playing at all levels. He played minor and under-21 for three years. He made his senior debut for Clare in a National Hurling League game against Meath in 2002 and later became a regular impact substitute during the subsequent championship campaign. In spite of losing their opening game, Clare surprised the hurling world by qualifying for the All-Ireland final. Quinn came on as a substitute once again as his side put up a good fight against Kilkenny. A combined tally of 2-13 for Henry Shefflin and D. J. Carey gave \\"the Cats\\" a seven-point victory. In 2003 he started at full forward in Clare's Munster championship win over Tipperary scoring 1-2. Quinn continued to line out with Clare for the next few seasons contesting a league final in 2005 and an all Ireland semifinal later that year, only to lose to a late Cork rally. He called time on his inter-county career following the team's exit from the 2007 championship and went on to win a championship with Tulla.

The Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim line was opened in 1879 as a branch of the Murr Valley Railway from Waiblingen to Hessenthal and left the current route at Beihingen-Heutingsheim (now part of Freiberg am Neckar). The section between Beihingen-Heutingsheim and Bietigheim (now called Bietigheim- Bissingen) was damaged during the Second World War and was never returned to operation. Between Ludwigsburg and Marbach the line has been part of the Stuttgart S-Bahn network since 1980. The Marbach‚ÄìBacknang section is currently being rebuilt so that it can be integrated into the S-Bahn. The Ludwigsburg‚ÄìBacknang line is sometimes referred to as the Kleine Murrbahn (\\"Little Murr Railway\\"). The fully electrified and partially double track line is of considerable importance for freight transport as a link between the Kornwestheim marshalling yard (Kornwestheimer Rangierbahnhof) and Nuremberg. Route  =Backnang‚ÄìLudwigsburg line= The line starts in the heights above the Murr at Backnang station. While the Murr Railway runs to the southwest and, after separating from the Little Murr line to Ludwigsburg under the B 14 highway, leaves the Murr valley, swinging south towards Waiblingen. The Little Murr line follows the twisting valley of the Murr to Kirchberg. Thereafter, the line leaves the floor of the valley and after Erdmannhausen runs through a 2 km long and up to 11 m deep cutting through the watershed between the Murr and the Neckar. After Marbach station a siding branches off to the north of the line and runs to Marbach power station‚Äîuntil 1989 there was a remnant here of the former 750 mm gauge Bottwar Valley Railway (Bottwartalbahn). After crossing the 335 m long Neckar Viaduct over a loop of the Neckar it reaches Benningen. From Freiberg the line is now double-track. The line passes through Favoritepark and crosses the B 27 highway to reach Ludwigsburg station. The line runs over a flying junction over the tracks of the Stuttgart‚ÄìBietigheim-Bissingen line and ends at Ludwigsburg's S-Bahn platforms. =Freiberg Bietigheim‚ÄìBissingen line= The now abandoned northern route of the Little Murr railway ran from Freiberg further to the west. The A 81 autobahn now crosses over the line on a bridge and near Bietigheimer Wilhelmshof and the line runs for 4 km through deposits of glacial debris in cuttings up to 13 m deep. These cuttings were at the time of its construction the deepest of their kind in W√ºrttemberg. After crossing the line from Stuttgart, the Little Murr line ended on the west side of Bietigheim station. History =Background and Planning = After the opening of the W√ºrttemberg railway lines in the internal expansion of the 1860s (see History of railways in W√ºrttemberg), the cities of Stuttgart, Heilbronn, Crailsheim and Aalen were connected by a railway that spanned the northern part of the country. In 1853, the first east‚Äìwest route through W√ºrttemberg was completed as the Western and Eastern Railways. Additional connections to Bavaria were added with the Rems Railway in 1863 and the Kocher Railway to Crailsheim in 1867, which was connected to the Bavarian railways in 1875. To improve links through the area spanned by the square of lines that had been opened, a line was proposed from Waiblingen on the Rems Railway to Schw√§bisch Hall on the Kocher Railway. Together with the G√§u Railway, this would create a northeast‚Äìsouthwest line through W√ºrttemberg, running through Stuttgart. In a speech the W√ºrttemberg Minister of Transport, Karl von Varnb√ºler announced on 28 April 1865 that the Murr Valley Railway would be built from Waiblingen to Schw√§bisch Hall with a branch from Backnang to Bietigheim. The Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim line came to have a high strategic importance as a through route. The plan was welcomed in many petitions from the communities on the route, but the town of Marbach in 1864 and 1865 called for a railway connection from Marbach to Bietigheim or Ludwigsburg. After the Franco- Prussian War of 1870-1871 and the subsequent Unification of Germany, construction of the Backnang-Bietigheim line was sought by the national government for military-strategic reasons. In Bietigheim a connection had previously been planned north of the station, which would have meant that trains running in an east‚Äìwest direction would have had to reverse in the station. To allow troops to be speedily transported in the east‚Äìwest direction from northern Bavaria to the French border, the plans were adjusted so that the line ran in a curve from the south to reach Bietigheim station via an underpass under the railway from Stuttgart. Since the entrance building was built on an island between the tracks of the Northern and Western Railway, a complete renovation of Bietigheim station was considered. Freiberg station (Jan 2008) GES with a museum train in Marbach (June 2004) Steam freight train between Freiberg am Neckar and Benningen, 1972 Maintenance of old embankment on abandoned Freiberg‚ÄìBietigheim line in Freiberg Road bridge over the former route in Bietigheim-Bissinger Wilhelmshof (April 2007) With the impending agreement to build the Kraichgau Railway between Eppingen and Heilbronn, W√ºrttemberg was faced with an unfavourable situation in that the Kraichgau and the Kocher Railway were emerging as a new transport corridor between the Rhine and Bavaria, with only a relatively short section through W√ºrttemberg. The planned Murr Valley Railway would be competitive with this route if an additional northern bypass was built around the highly congested Stuttgart station, connecting the Murr and the Western Railways. An alternative bypass route with access to the Western Railway would have been the Untert√ºrkheim‚ÄìKornwestheim freight bypass, which had not yet been built; it was planned from 1890 and opened in 1896. In addition, to the west of the proposed crossing of the Neckar, a 5 km long branch line would be built to Ludwigsburg to improve connections between Marbach and the Bottwar Valley to Ludwigsburg and Stuttgart. Construction of the Murr Valley Railway from Hall to Backnang with the two branches to Waiblingen and to Bietigheim were authorised under an order of 22 March 1873. A few months later, on 29 December 1873, the W√ºrttemberg and Baden governments signed an agreement for the construction of the Kraichgau Railway to Heilbronn. =Construction of the Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim line= An order of 19 June 1874 released funds that enabled the construction of the Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim line to begin. Construction camps were established in Backnang, Marbach and Bietigheim and a construction headquarters was established in Marbach. The entire route was built as a single-track main line, but the line was prepared for eventual duplication. During the construction of the line there were some significant problems: cuttings of up to 13 m deep‚Äîthe deepest in W√ºrttemberg‚Äîwere needed through glacial moraine between Beihingen-Heutingsheim and Bietigheim. The moraine was highly saturated and was subject to water seepage and landslides. Three fountains were built to dispose of the water and were used to supply Bietigheim station. Some animal remains ablated by Ice Age glaciation was found in the excavated earth. The most complex structure in the stretch was the Neckar Viaduct at Marbach, which was built as a five-span steel truss bridge with a total length of 345 m. Trains began running on the Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim line on 8 December 1879. The rebuilding of Bietigheim station made it the second largest in W√ºrttemberg. The Murr Valley Railway was completed on 5 May 1880, so this new east‚Äìwest axis was open before the completion of the Kraichgau Railway on 7 August 1880. =Construction of the Beihingen Heutingsheim-Ludwigsburg line= The construction of the Beihingen‚ÄìHeutingsheim‚ÄìLudwigsburg branch line was authorised in 1870, but construction was delayed first due to W√ºrttemberg's difficult financial situation, increasing wages for construction workers as a result of skill shortages and the lack of profitability of the W√ºrttemberg Railways. An order of 25 August 1879 made available the necessary funds, which could also be used for a partial reconstruction of Ludwigsburg station. The only station on the line is at Favoritepark halt. The single track railway was opened on 15 October 1881 and the reconstruction of Ludwigsburg station was completed in 1883. =Further development= Although the Ludwigsburg line was opened later, its role grew significantly in the following years: in 1894, the opening of the Bottwar Valley Railway (Bottwartalbahn) produced passenger traffic from the Bottwar Valley to Stuttgart and in 1918 the opening of the marshalling yard in Kornwestheim meant that freight traffic ran on the Franconia‚ÄìHessental‚ÄìBacknang‚ÄìKornwestheim route. After Deutsche Reichsbahn took over the facilities of the Royal W√ºrttemberg State Railways in 1921, the original constrained stations at Backnang, Burgstall, Marbach and Ludwigsburg were expanded. This was accompanied by the duplication of the Favoritepark‚ÄìLudwigsburg line. Due to its strategic importance as an east‚Äìwest axis, the line was the repeated target of Allied air attacks at the end of the Second World War. On a Sunday morning in the spring of 1945, a freight train running towards Bietigheim through Beihingen (now part of Freiberg am Neckar) was covered with bombs by a fighter-bomber and destroyed. The deep cuttings near Bietigheim were also badly damaged by bombs. On 20 April 1945 all railway and road bridges over the Neckar and the Neckar canal were destroyed by retreating German troops. In addition, on 20 April 1945 German troops blew up the bridge over the Reichsautobahn (now the A 81 autobahn). The Neckar Viaduct at Marbach was repaired and reopened in 1947. Deutsche Bundesbahn occasionally considered the reconstruction of the Freiberg‚ÄìBietigheim line, but decided against it because of low traffic forecasts, caused particularly by the shift of the primary traffic flow from east‚Äìwest to north‚Äìsouth. After the route had previously been partially dismantled, it was formally closed on 15 January 1958. The formation of the town of Freiberg am Neckar from the communities of Beihingen, Heutingsheim and Geisingen led to Beihingen-Heutingsheim station being renamed Freiberg (Neckar) on 1 June 1975. =Electrification and integration into the S-Bahn network= Two years after operations commenced on Stuttgart S-Bahn lines S1, S5 and S6 in 1978, the Backnang‚ÄìLudwigsburg line experienced a significant upswing with the extension of the S-Bahn line on 27 September 1980. Since then, line S4 services have operated between Ludwigsburg and Marbach. Extensive construction work was required ahead of the introduction of regular-interval timetables. The Neckar Viaduct at Marbach was replaced by a modern bridge, part of the Benningen‚ÄìFavoritepark section was duplicated, a flying junction was built in Ludwigsburg and the section was electrified. Passenger services between Marbach and Backnang continued to be operated with diesel-hauled trains. With the financial support of the state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, which provided half of the cost, electrification of the remaining section of the Backnang‚ÄìLudwigsburg line and the Murr line between Backnang and Crailsheim began on 12 September 1994. After the completion of the work it on 2 June 1996, it was possible for electrically hauled freight trains to run directly from Kornwestheim marshalling yard to Nuremberg. Compared to the existing route via the Schuster Railway to Untert√ºrkheim yard, where trains had to reverse (with the locomotive running around) in order to continue on the Rems line, the new route accelerated freight trains by 35 minutes. S-Bahn EMU on the Marbach Neckar Viaduct (January 2006) Work on the duplication in Freiberg (September 2009) S-Bahn line S4 has been extended from Marbach to Backnang, replacing Regionalbahn services. To create this S-Bahn ring, the Freiberg‚ÄìBenningen section needed to be duplicated. This work began in December 2005. In July 2008 the participating municipalities and districts signed an agreement to finance the extension between Marbach and Backnang. This allowed the S-Bahn extension to open on 8 December 2012. The total estimated cost of the works for the extension of the S-Bahn amounted to almost ‚Ç¨40 million. Operations The Backnang‚ÄìBietigheim route was originally built as part of an east‚Äìwest axis for freight transport. To a much lesser extent there were also long-distance passenger services on the east‚Äìwest route: for example, in the summer 1914 timetable an express train (D-Zug, a fast and luxurious express using carriages with compartments and having a corridor) ran from Cheb (then a largely German speaking city called Eger) to Bietigheim with some of its coaches running from Nuremberg to Paris and a fast train (S-Zug, slower and less luxurious than a D-Zug and using carriages with compartments but having no corridor) from Hof to Bietigheim, with through coaches from Nuremberg to Luxembourg and Trier. These trains use this line to bypass Stuttgart Hauptbahnhof. From 1931, an express service ran for two years on this line between Nuremberg and Strasbourg with through coaches from Prague to Paris. Until the early 1960s, passenger trains were hauled by steam locomotives of class 75.0 (W√ºrttemberg T 5) and 93.5 (Prussian T 14.1). After the phasing out of these locomotives they were replaced by Einheitsdampflokomotive (\\"standard steam locomotives\\") of class 64 and 86 based in Stuttgart until the mid-1960s. These were replaced by class 212 diesel locomotives based at Kornwestheim. In September 1980, the S-Bahn S4 opened between Marbach and Stuttgart-Schwabstra√üe. The original 20-minute interval service was increased to a 15-minute interval service in 1996. The S-Bahn service uses class 420 electric multiple units. Until 8 December 2008, services on the eastern section Regionalbahn ran from Marbach to Backnang during peak hours at 30-minute interval and hourly at other times. On Saturdays Regionalbahn trains ran hourly. These used a class BR 426 electric multiple unit. The additional service in the peaks used a class BR 110.3 with three Silberling carriages. On Sundays the places between Marbach and Backnang were served only by bus. Since 8 December 2012, S-Bahn line S 4 has served the whole route on weekdays until 8 pm at 30-minute intervals. After 8 pm and on weekends, it operates hourly. Since the electrification of the route in 1996, freight services have also run between Kornwestheim and Nuremberg and it is now not necessary for electrically-hauled freight trains to run via the Schuster line and reverse in Untert√ºrkheim yard.

Never a robust child, he preferred the company of a book or drawing materials to that of his peers. His first schooling was at Tot Nut van 't Algemeen in Cape Town, and there came under the mentorship of Charles Fanning, the art master. Charles Fanning, though a competent teacher, was of as retiring a nature as Willie, declining to sell his work for fear of exciting jealousy and resentment on the part of other artists. At the age of 14, Schr√∂der was compelled by his family's straitened circumstances to leave school and work for a photo colourist, becoming proficient at this art. Later he was employed by a photographer, S. B. Barnard, for some twelve years during which period he attended evening classes in art, first studying under Thomas Lindsay of the Roeland Street School of Art, and later under Lindsay's successor, W. McGill. Schr√∂der started regularly contributing cartoons and caricatures to newspapers and periodicals. One of his first works was a portrait of James Barry for The Zingari in 1871. He worked for the Zingari until it closed in 1875. John Schr√∂der, his father, died of dropsy in 1872 after a lifetime of abstaining from spirits and tobacco. The burden of responsibility for the family's welfare naturally fell on the eldest son. Schr√∂der now started giving art classes and painting portraits. He briefly worked for the Cape Town-based publication The Lantern, starting from when it opened in 1877, before moving to Port Elizabeth for a few years to work for The Observer newspaper in 1878. His cartoons were used by the Cape Argus, Het Volksblad, The Lantern, Excalibur and his own weekly The Knobkerrie. He moved to the Transvaal in 1889 where after working on several journals, he joined The Press in Pretoria.

A ruckman, Newton played 13 matches for Melbourne in his first season at the club, 1997. He was struck down by injuries the next two seasons, which resulted in him not playing a senior match. Melbourne delisted Newton at the end of 1999. Despite this, Newton remained with the club for many years, working as a ruck coach and media manager, before moving to become Hawthorn's ruck coach in 2009. Early life Newton is originally from Whitfield, a small town of around 200 people, located near Wangaratta in north-eastern Victoria. He began playing football for King Valley United Football Club, located near his hometown of Whitfield, in the Ovens & King Football League; he first played senior football at the age of 15. Later he moved to play for the larger Albury Football Club in the Ovens & Murray Football League, before being selected to play for the Murray Bushrangers in the TAC Cup. Newton played for Albury and for the Bushrangers in 1996, earning the attention of AFL recruiters by winning the award for the best and fairest player in the Ovens & Murray Football League, the Morris Medal. Despite not being selected in the 1996 AFL draft, Newton was invited to do a pre-season with Melbourne in the hope of being selected in the pre-season draft. He had an impressive pre- season; his track work was described as \\"stunning\\", he put on a lot of muscle and he played well in intra-club practice matches. As a result, Melbourne selected Newton with their first selection (third overall) in the pre-season draft, to be a back-up for Brownlow Medal winner, Jim Stynes. AFL career One week after being drafted, Newton played in Melbourne's only 1997 Ansett Australia Cup match, a loss to Carlton. Having been dubbed Melbourne's \\"key signing\\" of the off-season, the expectation at the start of the season was that Newton would \\"play at some stage\\". Newton made his AFL debut in round 3 against Sydney, kicking a goal with his first kick. He remained in the side for the next two matches before being dropped for round 6. Newton was back in the team the following week against Fremantle and his performance was described as \\"encourag[ing]\\". Two weeks later, Newton kicked two of Melbourne's three goals in a big loss to Port Adelaide. In round 10, after playing in five consecutive losses to begin his career, Newton played in his first AFL victory in a match where he was occasionally a tall target in Melbourne's forward line. At the halfway mark of the season, Newton's \\"encouraging\\" form was described as one of the few good points of the Demons' disappointing season. Newton missed the next three games after his first win, but was recalled to the side in round 14 and remained in it until round 20, kicking three goals in the seven matches. He was injured in the round 20 game against West Coast and subsequently missed the rest of the season. After a promising first season in which he played 13 games, Newton was expected to improve in 1998 and become a regular in the side. However, he was sidelined by a groin strain early in the season, which recurred regularly throughout 1998. Newton was only able to return to the reserves in mid-July. His groin injury then flared up again and, by August, it became so bad that he was required to miss the rest of the season. After his horror 1998 season, Newton had a much better pre-season for 1999. He played in a practice match against Fremantle and was considered to be on track to play in round 1. Midway through April, Newton played his first full game in the reserves, kicking four goals in the process, only for a hernia operation to sideline him for a month. He returned to the reserves in June, but then suffered a shoulder injury that ruled him out for the rest of the season. After two injury-riddled seasons where he was unable to make a senior appearance, Newton was delisted by the Demons at the end of 1999. He nominated for the pre-season draft, but went undrafted and so retired from football. Post-AFL career In 2003, Newton was appointed Melbourne's media manager, a role he filled for six seasons. In conjunction with his media responsibilities, Newton also became the Demons' ruck coach in 2008. Newton left the Demons at the end of 2008, becoming the ruck coach at Hawthorn and public relations and marketing executive at the Moonee Valley Racing Club. Personal life Newton's three brothers, Michael, Cohan and Brent, were all accomplished country football players in the Ovens & King Football League and Ovens & Murray Football League.

He is Director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd. Professional background Weston was born in Leicester in 1953. He attended Wyggeston Boys Grammar School. He went on to study architecture at Manchester University, gaining a BA in 1975 and BArch in 1977. Supported by the Thouron Award, he attended the University of Pennsylvania (USA) to study landscape architecture, gaining an MLA (Penn) in 1979. From 1979‚Äì1982 he worked in practice and was appointed as a lecturer at the Welsh School of Architecture (WSA) in Cardiff. He subsequently taught at the Leicester and Portsmouth schools of architecture before returning to Cardiff in 1999 as a professorial research fellow. In 2003 he was appointed to the Chair of Architecture, a position he holds today. In addition to his teaching at the WSA, he is editor of arq (Architectural Research Quarterly, Cambridge University Press) and director of Richard Weston Studio Ltd and Earth Images Ltd. Alongside his teaching duties, Weston is an experienced researcher with numerous books and publications to his name. Most notably, he is author of two award-winning books, a monograph on the architect Alvar Aalto and a study of the modernist movement titled Modernism. In addition he is the author of the definitive work on the life and achievements of Sydney Opera House architect, J√∏rn Utzon. Famously reclusive and private, Utzon granted Weston unlimited access to his archives and himself, enabling the publication of a unique study. Architectural work In 1992, Weston designed a glass roof to cover the sunken courtyard of a house built in a redundant water tank in Hampshire. Formed of stainless steel 'gutter trusses' whose profile, like a river, widens and deepens in response to the flow of water, and between them span laminated glass arches, with an interlayer to reduce heat gain from the sun. Weston's interest in structural glass found dramatic expression in a house he built for himself as part of FutureWorld (an exhibition designed to provide the public with a glimpse of the way homes might operate in the 21st century) in Milton Keynes. The 5.5 tonne stressed-skin plywood roof of Radiant House is supported only by glass ‚Äì a feat achieved in collaboration with engineer Mark Lovell. In 2002, he entered two architectural competitions, taking the opportunity they posed to explore ideas. The first for the Royal Playhouse in Copenhagen (in collaboration with John Pardey Architects and eventually won by Lundgaard & Tranberg Arkitekter, who went on to build it) and the second for the Great Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Whilst it did not win, the proposal, consisting of a 230m limestone dome, was selected for publication by the judges and Weston's learning of the Egyptians' fascination with the stars later became an inspiration for the designs for his own house and studio in Sully, South Wales - although sadly this was to remain on the drawing board. =Competitions and buildings= *Grand Egyptian Museum (selected for publication), 2002. *Royal Playhouse, Copenhagen, 2002. *Finalist in two-stage open competition for National Wildflower Centre, Liverpool, 1997. *Finalist in two-stage open competition for Public Artwork, Hamilton, 1997. *Radiant House, Milton Keynes (pub. in various magazines and newspapers). *Glass Roof for Howard Smith, Hampshire (pub.

Design work Described by the Independent on Sunday as \\"the break out star of Britain's Next Big Thing\\", he appeared in the seven-part BBC2 television series tracing the development of new products for leading retailers. Using high-resolution scanners, he has generated designs for a collection of silk scarves from natural materials such as minerals and stones. This idea was presented at the 'Best of British Open Design Call' at Liberty in London (the world's leading retailer of scarves) and, since their debut on the shelves in 2010, have quickly established themselves as amongst Liberty's best selling lines. The images, which can be printed on most natural and man-made fibres, offer a wide range of application in architecture, interior design and fashion. In addition to the scarves, they have appeared in Liza Bruce's new ranges of swimwear. Architectural applications are also currently being developed, with leading British architects Patel Taylor featuring an 'agate fa√ßade' in a house in Camden Town. The London Olympic Games in 2012 followed suit, with four 5x3m images greeting athletes in the Olympic Village in Stratford. Weston's most recent public work is a four-storey banner installed in the atrium of the new Health Library at the Heath Hospital in Cardiff. The scope of Weston's work has been extended by the purchase, in September 2014, of a sophisticated optical microscope and he is gaining increasing recognition internationally, with publications in the USA (Vincent Mok in Maniac Magazine, May 2013, p58-9), Ukraine (in Russian in Salon magazine, September 2013, p82-7) and The Netherlands (Mark magazine, June/July 2014, p160-167), as well as in two books on textile design published in the UK, the first by Melanie Bowles, Digital Textile Design (Laurence King, 2012), the second, Simon Clarke's Print: Fashion, Interiors, Art (Laurence King, 2014).

It is a farce following the consequences of an adulterous affair between a married man and his boss‚Äôs wife and their attempts to cover their tracks by roping in a third couple to be their alibi, resulting in a chain of misunderstandings, conflicts and revelations.How The Other Half Loves (1969) ‚Äì Alan Ayckbourn‚Äôs official website The play is known to have secured Ayckbourn‚Äôs runaway success as a playwright.Allen, Paul (2001). Alan Ayckbourn: Grinnin at the Edge. Methuen. pp. 122‚Äì3. . Cast and plot summary The play has a cast of six: Frank and Fiona Foster, Bob and Teresa Phillips, and William and Mary Featherstone. The well-to-do Frank and Fiona have a polite and emotionally distant relationship, while Fiona is in a secret affair with Frank's employee Bob, whose marriage with Teresa is very stormy; she feels neglected by him, and her suspicions are heightened by ghost phone calls. The contrast between the nature of the Fosters' and Phillips' relationships is heightened by the visual difference in their respective living spaces and furnishings, both of which co-exist in the same space on the stage. Asked where they have been, both Bob and Fiona lie to their spouses that they have been comforting, respectively, William and Mary Featherstone, each of whom is alleged to believe their spouse to be having an affair. The Fosters and the Phillips have each invited the Featherstones to dinner on successive evenings, with both being played out simultaneously on the same set, the Featherstones shifting back and forth between them; William is revealed as a very controlling husband who systematically intimidates Mary. Teresa and Bob's conflict culminates in her throwing soup at him but mistakenly hitting William, while in the Fosters' dinner party, his drenched state is the result of a leak from the bathroom above. Teresa, whose marriage with Bob is on the rocks, visits the Fosters and discovers Bob and Fiona's affair. In Teresa's absence, Mary visits the Phillips, and while Bob is in the next room, she answers a phone call from Frank, leading him to believe that she and Bob are having an affair. He tells William, who goes to the Phillips' house and physically attacks Bob but is knocked out by Teresa. After Frank invites everyone to his house to clear the air, William half-apologises to Mary, who chews him out over his controlling nature, but ultimately forgives him, while Bob and Teresa make up. When they are alone, Frank forgives Fiona after she admits to having cheated. Although she does not reveal with whom, Frank thinks he has worked it out, and calls Bob, but Teresa answers. Assuming that he was the ghost caller, she suggests meeting him in private to discuss his problems, to which he bewilderedly agrees.

Long known to science, it remained almost unstudied until its unusual sexual behavior was described in the early 21st century.BBC News 2011-APR-12: Cannibal wolf spiders are ladykillers This ground-dwelling spider is native to mainly coastal areas, from southeastern Brazil via Uruguay and Argentina to southern Chile, though its known occurrences are patchy. To what extent it is found on the Atlantic coast south of the R√≠o de la Plata remains largely unknown, for example. While the males have been known for over a century, the females were only described in 1980.Casanueva (1980), Capocasale (1990), Platnick (2010) Description A. brasiliensis is a mid-sized cryptic light brown spider of robust build, with a body size of well over 1 cm (0.5 in and more) when fully grown, up to almost twice this size in the largest specimens. The cephalothorax has an inconspicuous darker stripe pattern reminiscent of that found in many lycosids, but the opisthosoma is patterned with yellower and darker spots the approximate size of sand grains. Males and females look alike in color, but differ in size and genitals.Casanueva (1980), Capocasale (1990), Aisenberg et al. (2009) Adult females have a cephalothorax carapace some 4‚Äì5 mm wide and some 6‚Äì7 mm long on average. Quite unusually for spiders in general, adult males are about 20% larger. Still, as usual for wolf spiders the females are more robustly built, wider-bodied and shorter-legged. In both sexes the four middle legs are shortest, the hind pair longest and the front pair intermediate. Even the shortest four legs of the adult females usually measure more than 1 cm. The longest leg pair is usually 2 cm or more in adult males and may measure up to about 2.5 cm (1 in). In females, it may grow to almost 1 in, but is usually around 2 cm. Taxonomy A. brasiliensis was first described to the New York Academy of Sciences in 1909 by Russian- American arachnologist A. Petrunkevitch; the description was based on a male from Brazil and published in the Academy's annual volume released in 1910. Petrunkevitch placed the species in a new genus Moenkhausiana, due to its unusual and distinct spinnerets and leg proportions. Initially considered monotypic, C.F. de Mello-Leit√£o later described a presumed relative \\"M.\\" argentinensis.Petrunkevitch [1910], Platnick (2010) But soon thereafter, when he studied spiders from northern Argentina, he became so convinced of their distinctness as to consider them ant spiders (Zodariidae) and in 1945 re- described the present species as Glieschiella senex, perhaps not recognizing it because he misidentified his specimen as a female (it was actually also a male, like the type specimen of A. brasiliensis). In the supposed ant spider genus, it was associated with \\"G.\\" alticeps (see below) and the type species of Glieschiella, \\"G.\\" halophila.Mello-Leit√£o (1945), Capocasale (2001), Platnick (2010) Yet in 1951 Mello-Leit√£o, when studying some spiders caught at Maullin (Chile), again described A. brasiliensis anew, in yet another monotypic genus Araucaniocosa. Subsequently it was mainly studied under the 1951 name - Araucaniocosa difficilis -, and affiliated closely with the \\"European tarantulas\\" (Lycosa), even included there as a sub-genus. When the females were first described, they were also treated under the 1951 name, as they were also based on individuals from Chile.Mello-Leit√£o (1951), Casanueva (1980), Platnick (2010) Today, Moenkhausiana and Glieschiella are treated as junior synonym of the large genus Allocosa, which is not considered to be very close to Lycosa as wolf spiders go. As regards the species which were historically affiliated with A. brasiliensis, A. alticeps is generally considered valid, while \\"A. argentinensis\\" and \\"A. halophila\\" are apparently based on immature specimens and considered nomina dubia. The former at least was described from outside the known range of A. brasiliensis - from Isla Tehuel Malal, R√≠o Negro Province, southeastern Argentina -, but restudy would be needed to determine whether any of them is a distinct taxon. Whether the (possibly widely allopatric) Chilean population is a taxonomically distinct subspecies has not been studied in detail; certainly however, it does not seem to be a distinct species and has no conspicuous difference in size.Casanueva (1980), Capocasale (1990), Aisenberg et al. (2009), Platnick (2010) Ecology and behavior A. brasiliensis is nocturnal, resting at daytime in burrows in sand dunes along river mouths and the coast of at least part of the Southern Cone. The burrows of adults are quite exactly 1 cm wide and usually run steeply down, with a length of a few cm (1‚Äì3 in). Male burrows tend to be longer/deeper, up to 10 cm and more (4 in). The spiders are more frequently found on the land-side of dunes, which is better protected against strong winds, and prefer open habitat to vegetation when outside their burrows. The reproductive peak takes place in January (after midsummer), with the highest surface and foraging activity shown during Southern hemisphere summer.Capocasale (1990), Aisenberg et al. (2009) In general, the habitat is cool and humid for its region, at best subtropical, the air being constantly moistened, usually by brine that is carried from the sea by the wind. In typical habitat at El Pinar, Uruguay, average air and ground temperatures were measured just around in November (early summer). Relative humidity was almost 100%, even though the air was constantly exchanged even in the area of ground effect. The vegetation was rather monotonous, dominated by ragwort (Senecio) and Panicum grass. Potential A. brasiliensis prey that was commonly encountered were Acromyrmex ants, Tetragonoderus ground beetles and striped earwigs of genus Labidura. Rhino beetles of the genus ThronistesTronistes in Capocasale (1990) is a lapsus. were also common in that habitat, but presumably too tough for the spiders to eat. As a possible predator of the spiders, a dune-adapted species of tree iguana (Liolaemus) was noted.Capocasale (1990) Owing to its harsh habitat, with high variability of weather conditions and prey availability, A. brasiliensis is a highly opportunistic free-roaming predator, feeding mostly on spiders, beetles, flies and ants. Altogether, the species prefers to feed on spiders, which make up about one-third of its diet; indeed, other Allocosa are typically eaten more often than any other kind of prey during the life of any wild-living A. brasiliensis. But the mainstay food actually varies quite a lot between the seasons, and in general these spider's food choice is shaped by availability more than by preference. Less frequently other arthropods are caught, e.g. true bugs (Hemiptera) or crickets, grasshoppers etc. (Orthoptera). Ants such as Acromyrmex or DorymyrmexDorymirmex in Aisenberg et al. (2009) is a lapsus. are often caught on their trails or during their nuptial flights, and the nimble and well-camouflaged spiders manage to surprise Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) resting on the ground surprisingly often. As regards cannibalism, the adult female A. brasiliensis are if anything less prone to eat conspecifics than spiders in general, let alone the adult females which in many species are famous for habitually feeding on their mates. In A. brasiliensis by contrast, immatures are voraciously cannibalistic on each other and even more often eat females of the smaller sympatric relative A. alticeps. Most remarkably however, the adult males include a considerable number of conspecific females in their diet.Aisenberg et al. (2009) Adults reach maturity at around 9‚Äì10 months of age and after around 10 (up to one dozen) moults; females grow up somewhat faster than males, and often have one moult less. On average females tend to be slightly shorter-lived than males at least in captivity, where the latter typically live for almost 500 days. An extreme age of almost 2 years has been recorded in a captive female; generally the species seems to be semelparous.Aisenberg & Costa (2008) In captivity, these spiders have been maintained from wild-collected eggs to maturity and senescence in petri dishes, one spider per dish. A thin layer of sea sand and a watered lump of clean cotton wool create a favorable microclimate and allow the spiders to drink. Spiderlings fared well in dishes of 3.5 cm diameter and about 1 cm height; as they grow (around the third to fourth instar) they will need to be housed in larger dishes (about 10 cm in diameter and over 1 cm in height). As captive-bred food, Drosophila flies up to the fourth instar and subsequently Tenebrio mealworms of appropriate size, and for adults also small Orange-spotted Cockroaches (Blaptica dubia), were used with success. Adults will need three such food items per week. Captive breeding attempts require sizeable terraria due to the spiders' burrowing and cannibalistic habits; a 15-cm (>5 in) sand bottom with 5 cm (2 in) air above has been found to work; the base area should not be much less than 450 cm2 (0.5 ft2). The mating terrarium needs to be divided by a barrier, the above ground part of which is removed when male and female have constructed their burrow. =Sexual role reversal= A. brasiliensis males use pheromones to attract females, in contrast to most other burrowing wolf spiders, where the females attract the males.Aisenberg et al. (2010a) Males have been observed to specifically cannibalize on older females that were lured into the male's burrow, while preferring mating with virgins. The first egg sac of A. brasiliensis females contains more eggs than later ones, which, together with the harsh habitat, gives this behavior an evolutionary advantage. The smaller and stronger-marked relative Allocosa alticeps, which lives sympatrically in the same habitat, seems to show a similar sexual role reversal. Although cannibalism is not rare among spiders, the selective hunting of females by males is as of 2010 unknown in any other spider species; even A. alticeps does not seem to be conspicuously cannibalistic. These Allocosa are the only known wolf spiders adapted to living on the Uruguayan coastline (though see above for possible relatives). Sexual size dimorphism seems to be more pronounced in A. brasiliensis, while A. alticeps females and males are often enough about the same size. Both sexes of the present species are usually found equally frequently; in A. alticeps females appear to outnumber males by far. Reproductive isolation is ultimately achieved via behavior and genital anatomy, but quite often inspecting the differently-sized and differently- smelling burrow entrance will already allow these spiders to identify conspecifics. In addition, the species also seem to have different microhabitat preferences.Aisenberg & Costa (2008), Aisenberg et al. (2009), Aisenberg et al.

PASASA is headquartered in Cape Town, South Africa and has offices in Durban, King William‚Äô Town and Pretoria, South Africa. The goal of Paraffin Safety Association of Southern Africa is three-fold: 1. Provide training and educational material to paraffin users though a network of partnerships. These include NGOs community groups, emergency and healthcare workers, herbalists or any other group or individual who can effectively disseminate safety information. It has trained a corps of master trainers who will train and provide educational material in 11 official languages to these community partners. 2. Work with industry, regulatory organisations and other bodiesMinerals and Energy Minister acknowledges the need to resolve the issue of paraffin safety to set safety standards and lobbying government to have these made mandatory.State of Energy in South African Cities 2006 Now that government has gazetted legislation on stove standards, the Paraffin Safety Association is focussing on packaging standards to ensure paraffin is sold in clearly marked, childproof containers. 3. Compile a knowledge base about the domestic use of paraffin and its consequences by conducting incidence surveillance, research, and collating and interpreting all available information. Provincial presence In 2003 the Paraffin Safety Association of Southern Africa decided to extend its interventions beyond the head office in Cape Town so that there could be a provincial presence and projects across the country. In 2004, two provincial offices were opened in Durban and Johannesburg. The Johannesburg office moved to Pretoria in October 2008. The PASASA strategy in provinces is to select an area whose community uses paraffin as their main source of energy, do a baseline survey on this community and then design an intervention programme based on the results of the survey. These programmes are termed Area Specific Interventions (ASIs) at PASASA. As at January 2011, PASASA had ten ASIs in eight provinces of South Africa and works with them for a period of a year and half before moving to the next ASI.  Programmes and activities  = Public Communications Programme (PCP) = The purpose of the Public Communications programme is to coordinate all media, publications and communications projects of PASASA. The main aim is to make PASASA visible and audible and also to streamline communication messages across the whole organisation, ensuring that there are no ambiguities to our messaging. Our ultimate goal is to develop communication strategies for PASASA to deal with our various stakeholders. = Community Engagement Programme (CEP) = The Community Engagement Programme is to interface with communities, local authorities, and energy and paraffin users on the ground. This is done by delivering on community awareness, education, and training and information dissemination projects. Interactive interaction with local hospitals, mortuaries and clinics to collect household energy related injury data as part of our surveillance system. It is to lobby and advocate amongst local councilors and provincial governments and other stakeholders to ensure household energy safety. It is to establish partnerships to ensure that interventions and legacy are sustained. It is to deepen the implementation of our Area Specific Interventions. Conduct social and scientific surveillance work. = Scientific, Technical, Education, Research and Industry Programme (STER) = The purpose of this programme is to coordinate and conduct researched solutions to the Household energy safety problems. STER's purpose is to participate in the development of new paraffin fuel and appliance standards. And also deals with packaging and labeling issues. STER also handles all technical issues like dealing with the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) of the South African Petroleum Industry Association (SAPIA). STER's partners are hospitals, clinics and SABS enforcement of standards. The ultimate goal for STER is to establish an Industry Association for safe Household Energy appliances. The programmes above will be broken down into the following Service Delivery projects: Safer Systems Project This project is to ensure that all household appliances are safe and meet specific regulatory requirements. Surveillance for Impact System The surveillance for impact system deals with burns and injury surveillance in hospitals and countries across the country. Research Projects PASASA in collaboration with GTZ recently did a study to inform stakeholders regarding the market potential for safe paraffin appliances in South Africa. Education Projects Working with service departments like Disaster management and The Department of Health to train their staff on paraffin safety.  Achievements and awards  2009 - The first non-pressure stove is granted homologation against the SANS 1906:2006 standard for non-pressure paraffin stoves and heaters. 2008 - PASASA is included by the National Regulator for Compulsory Specifications in its newly established committee to oversee the enforcement of paraffin appliance regulations. 2007 - Winner of NSTF Award 2006/2007 for outstanding contributions to science, engineering and technology. 2006 - Finalist in the National Science and Technology Forum Awards. 2005 - Winner of the Department of Trade and Industry Award for Consumer Champions.

Formann (August 27, 1949, Vienna, Austria ‚Äì July 12, 2010, Vienna) was an Austrian research psychologist, statistician, and psychometrician. He is renowned for his contributions to item response theory (Rasch models), latent class analysis, the measurement of change, mixture models, categorical data analysis, and quantitative methods for research synthesis (meta- analysis). Biography Anton K. Formann studied psychology with statistics and anthropology (individual curriculum approved by the university) at the University of Vienna, Austria, where he received his PhD in psychology in 1973 under the supervision of Gerhard H. Fischer at the university's Department of Psychology. He worked as a post doc researcher and Assistant Professor at Fischer's division until 1985, when he earned his postdoctoral professorial qualification (habilitation in psychology) and became Associate Professor at the University of Vienna. He also studied statistics at Sheffield Hallam University (UK) where he graduated (MSc with distinction) in 1998. In 1999, he gained his second postdoctoral professional qualification (habilitation in applied statistics). In 2004, after being substitute chair holder for 5 years, he became full professor for psychological methods at the University of Vienna, succeeding the chair of mathematical psychology of Gerhard H. Fischer. From 2005 onwards, Formann was Vice Head of the Department of Basic Psychological Research within the Faculty of Psychology at the University of Vienna, and during 2006-08 additionally Vice Dean of the Faculty.  Scientific Work  Formann led long-standing research collaborations with colleagues in the statistical, medical, and psychological sciences. His substantial research activities in all these fields are documented in numerous books and more than 50 publications in prestigious high-impact journals, including Biometrics,Formann, A. K. (1993).

D. (2010). In memoriam Anton K. Formann. Psychological Test and Assessment Modeling, 52, 491-492. As a senior author, Formann also showed that the common assumption that the EM estimation of the two-parameter logistic model is not influenced by initial values is incorrect.  Viennese Matrices Test  Formann was probably the first researcher to practically apply Fischer's linear logistic test model (LLTM) for test development. The LLTM is a special case of the Rasch model, which allows the construction of items with item difficulties based on the user's demand. This resulted in the development of a Rasch-scaled abstract reasoning testFormann, A. K., & Piswanger, K. (1979). Wiener MatrizenTest. Ein Rasch-skalierter sprachfreier Intelligenztest [Viennese Matrices Test: A Rasch-scaled culture-fair intelligence test]. Weinheim: Beltz. (based on Raven's matrices test) which has since been widely used in research and practice. A revised version of this language-free intelligence test that has been calibrated against large contemporary samples of men and women is forthcoming.Formann, A. K., Waldherr, K., & Piswanger, K. (2011). Wiener Matrizen-Test 2 (WMT-2): Ein Rasch-skalierter sprachfreier Kurztest zur Erfassung der Intelligenz [Viennese Matrices Test 2: A Rasch-scaled language- free short test for the assessment of intelligence]. G√∂ttingen: Hogrefe.  Latent Class Analysis  For his first habilitation (in psychology), Formann published a comprehensive monograph on latent class analysisFormann, A. K. (1984). Latent Class Analyse: Einf√ºhrung in die Theorie und Anwendung [Latent class analysis: Introduction to theory and application]. Weinheim: Beltz. which continues to be widely cited for its clarity, depth, and originality, and hence is considered a true modern classic on this topic. = Quantitative Methods for Research Synthesis (Meta-Analysis) = In his later research, Formann addressed, among other things, the problem of publication bias in meta-analytic research. He introduced a novel method that allows estimating the proportion of studies missing in meta-analysis due to publication bias based on the truncated normal distribution.Formann, A. K. (2008). Estimating the proportion of studies missing for meta-analysis due to publication bias. Contemporary Clinical Trials, 29, 732-739. In 2010, as the senior author, Formann debunked in a meta-analysis the famous Mozart effect as a myth.Pietschnig, J., Voracek, M., & Formann, A. K. (2010). Mozart effect‚Äì‚ÄìShmozart effect: A meta-analysis. Intelligence, 38, 314-323. = Other =  Newcomb-Benford Law  Formann provided an alternative explanation for the Newcomb-Benford law ‚Äì a formalisation of the remarkable observation that the frequencies with which the leading digits of numbers occur in large data sets are far away from being uniform (e.g., the leading digit 1 occurs in nearly one third of all cases). In addition to the prevailing explanations based on scale- and base invariance, Formann directed the attention to the interrelation between the distribution of the significant digits and the distribution of the observed variable. He showed in a simulation study that long right-tailed distributions of a random variable are compatible with the Newcomb-Benford law, and that for distributions of the ratio of two random variables the fit generally improves.Formann, A. K. (2010). The Newcomb- Benford law in its relation to some common distributions. PLoS ONE, 5, e10541.  Piaget's Water Level Task  The water-level task refers to a task developed by Jean Piaget where bottles filled with different levels of water are presented in different angles of orientation. It is used to assess the level of mental development of spatial abilities (e.g., recognition of the invariance of horizontality). Formann criticized the established method of dichotomizing water-level responses by the subjects into \\"right\\" versus \\"wrong\\" ‚Äì he showed that this method was inappropriate because it ignored the heterogeneity of the task difficulties - and instead recommended using latent class models or Rasch models.Formann, A. K. (2003). Modeling data from water- level tasks: A test theoretical analysis. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 96, 1153-1172. He showed that subjects and tasks can be arrayed on a unidimensional scale and, by employing the linear logistic test model, that the task difficulty could be attributed to a single parameter associated with the angle of inclination of the bottle. Furthermore, he provided the first empirical data of task performance of the elderly and found that there was an age-associated non-linear decline of performance.Tran, U. S., & Formann, A. K. (2008). Piaget‚Äôs water-level tasks: Performance across the lifespan with emphasis on the elderly. Personality and Individual Differences, 45, 232-237.  Misconception of Probability  Formann compared the performance in the classic birthday problem (i.e., guessing the probability P for any coincidence among N individuals sharing the same birthday) and the birthmate problem (i.e., guessing the probability P for the specific coincidence among N individuals of having a birthday today) in psychology undergraduates, casino visitors, and casino employees. Psychology students and women did better on both task types, but were less confident about their estimates than casino visitors or personnel and men. Higher confidence ratings were related to subjective estimates that were closer to the solutions of birthday problems, but not of birthmate problems.Voracek, M., Tran, U. S., & Formann, A. K. (2008). Birthday and birthmate problems: Misconceptions of probability among psychology undergraduates and casino visitors and personnel. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 106, 91-103.  Parallel Analysis in Retrieving Unidimensionality in the Presence of Binary Data  Formann provided both theoretical and empirical evidence that the application of the parallel analysis for uncovering the factorial structure of binary variables is not appropriate. Results of a simulation study showed that sample size, item discrimination, and type of correlation coefficient considerably influence the performance of parallel analysis.Tran, U. S., & Formann, A. K. (2009). Performance of parallel analysis in retrieving unidimensionality in the presence of binary data. Educational and Psychological Measurement, 69, 50-61.

Woods Coffee was founded in Lynden, Washington in 2002. History Woods Coffee was established in 2002 by the Herman family of Lynden, Washington. With a dream of starting a chain of coffee shops, the Hermans pooled their talents and resources to create the first Woods Coffee shop in Lynden. \\" In early 2005, Woods Coffee updated their earlier customer loyalty program, one involving paper cards that were punched at the time of purchase. The new system used radio-frequency identification (RFID) embedded in plastic cards suitable for carrying in a wallet or on a keychain. The RFID system was named SpeedBean, and by 2007 when Woods Coffee operated six coffee shops, about 7,500 SpeedBean cards were in use, carried by about 40% of customers. The cards were replenished automatically with funds drawn from the customer's bank account or credit card. The system accounted for 26% of all transactions in 2007, and it was determined that customers using the RFID system spent 22% more than customers paying cash. In October 2008, the Bellingham/Whatcom Chamber of Commerce & Industry chose Woods Coffee as the Green Business of the Year. Two months later, The Bellingham Herald in its annual awards issue announced Woods Coffee as the best local coffee. The next year, the newspaper announced that the company ran the best coffee shop. In January 2011, Woods Coffee opened their own bakery and introduced a line of in-house baked goods after realizing that outsourcing the baking to other companies did not maintain the quality of non- Fair Trade goods the company regularly sold, including sandwiches and bakery products. In January 2014, Woods Coffee began serving its own in-house roasted coffee., and in April 2016, Woods Coffee opened Woods Coffee Roastery, a public roasting and tasting room, which includes a brew bar and a 300-gallon twin tank cold brew system. Locations Woods Coffee's first coffee shop was opened near Bender Fields in Lynden, Washington. In 2015 Woods Coffee announced that it was planning on opening up its first store in Canada, and the doors opened to their Tsawwassen Springs location in Delta, BC in July 2016. A Bellevue store opened in 2016 was the chain's first King County location. Controversy In 2011, founder Wes Herman announced plans to create a sculpture that was to be built in front of their Flatiron location in Bellingham, Washington. The sculpture design was chosen in a community contest,http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2011/01/25/1834931/woods-coffee- holding-contest-to.html and was to depict a \\"coffee cup pouring coffee onto the sidewalk\\". The plan was opposed by some residents of the city primarily over environmental concerns about depicting a disposable cup and opposition to the logo on the cup. Initially, City representatives informally went along with the idea. However, a more formal investigation showed that the private property location was smaller than originally thought, and would have some difficulty being approved by the City Planning Department. \\" 'We had responses that were both positive and not positive, and the not positive group was very vocal,' said Herman, noting that's not what they intended when they created the design contest.\\" Herman said that he still wants to do something to support the Arts District.http://www.bellinghamherald.com/2011/03/02/1894507/the-woods-coffee- scraps-plan-for.html  References  {{Ambox  name = Citations broken  subst =  type = content  image = 50x40px  issue = This {} uses citations that link to broken or outdated sources. {{#if:{}{}}}  fix = Please or discuss this issue on the talk page.

For one or more months, hundreds of painted elephant sculptures specially created by artists are placed in the streets of one or more host cities with the aim of increasing public awareness of the plight of the elephant and gaining support for Asian elephant conservation. They are then auctioned off, with the proceeds going to the Elephant Family organisation. History The event was created in 2006 by Marc Spits and his son Mike. It was inspired by Marc Spits' visit (while logging in Myanmar) to the elephant hospital in Thailand, which constructs prosthetic legs for elephants that encounter landmines. There he saw Mosha, a baby elephant who lost her foot when only seven months old. Mosha was the first elephant to receive a prosthetic limb. She is fitted with a new leg every year, and must then learn to walk all over again. The documentary film The Eyes of Thailand, (narrated by Ashley Judd), shows the work of Mosha's caregiver Soraida Salwala. The first Elephant Parade was held in Rotterdam in 2007. Antwerp followed in 2008. In 2009, Elephant Parade visited Amsterdam. In 2010, Elephant Parades were held in Emmen and London. In 2011 they were held in Heerlen, Copenhagen, Milan, Singapore, Hasselt, and in 2013 in Trier, Luxembourg and Dana Point, California. In 2014, Elephant Parade visited the UK during a National Tour and later Hong Kong, followed by Calais, Suzhou, Bangkok and Florian√≥polis in 2015. In 2016 Elephant Parade came to Taiwan and celebrated its 10th anniversary in Chiang Mai, Thailand. Elephant Parade returned to The Netherlands in 2017 and held another anniversary parade in Laren. Expositions were also held in S√£o Paulo in 2017 and in India in 2017/2018. The elephant sculptures in the Elephant Parade are all unique works donated by the artists, who include both established and emerging unknowns and celebrities. They are exhibited in the streets of the host city for one or more months and then auctioned off (by a well known auction house such as Christie's or Sotheby's), with the proceeds going to Elephant Family and the Friends of the Asian Elephant Hospital, home of Mosha, in Lampang, which seeks to save the Asian elephant and return it to its natural habitat. The sculptures are tall. Limited-edition miniatures are also made of most, varying in size between ; these are hand-painted in Thailand and sold on the Elephant Parade website, with the proceeds from all online sales associated with the Elephant Parade also going to Elephant Family and FAE. Money raised through Elephant Parade has been used to support projects from elephant medical care to leasing land where elephants have sufficient space to migrate, breed and live in peace. =Elephant Parade Amsterdam= In 2009 over 100 art elephants participated in Elephant Parade Amsterdam, created by artists including Jan des Bouvrie, Henk Schiffmacher, Menno Baars, Ilse DeLange, Corneille, Rob Scholte, Raymond Hoogendorp and Daryl van Wouw. The elephants were auctioned by Christie's in November 2009. The best-selling elephant was by Corneille, a well known Dutch painter of the COBRA group, and was sold for ‚Ç¨42,000. The BaarsFant by Menno Baars was sold for ‚Ç¨30,000. Only a few weeks after the auction, Baars designed a second elephant, named BabyBelly. This time, however, he painted the elephant during a live session at the Kalvertoren, a shopping mall in the Kalverstraat, a famous shopping street in Amsterdam. BabyBelly is a smaller art elephant and is pregnant, depicting the conservation of its species. =Elephant Parade London= In 2010, UK conservation charity, Elephant Family, executed the exhibition. Over 250 art elephants were designed for London by Marc Quinn was sold to Amanda Eliasch, others designed by Tommy Hilfiger, Graeme Le Saux, Lulu Guinness, Martin Aveling, Diane von Furstenberg and others. The elephants were transported by Eco Movers over the course of the parade, up to the celebrity auction held in June 2010. The auction raised over ¬£4 million ($7,150,000). The elephant created by Jack Vettriano attracted the highest bid, ¬£155,000 ($252,600). =Elephant Parade Emmen Zoo= Also in 2010, Elephant Parade visited Emmen, in the north of the Netherlands, for the 75th anniversary of the Emmen Zoo. From Ascension day, 13 May, until the end of August, 75 art elephants were exhibited in the centre of the town and in the zoo itself. Most were created by artists from the region. The auction, held by Christie's, was at the Eden Hotel in Emmen on 9 September 2010. The best-selling elephant was again by Corneille, and was sold for ‚Ç¨68,000 ($98,188). By a sad coincidence, Corneille had died only three days earlier. =Elephant Parade Tour Bergen= In Bergen, Netherlands, the first Elephant Parade Tour was organized. 65 smaller, elephants were exhibited in the windows of shops and galleries in the centre of the town beginning on 22 August (broken link) and then auctioned by Christie's on 30 October. ‚Ç¨127,000 ($181,600) was raised. On the last day of the Elephant Parade Bergen Tour, it was announced that the town council had acquired an art elephant by George Jurriaens to be placed at the local Museum Kranenburgh. Elephants from previous Elephant Parades had been temporarily placed in museums such as the Natural History Museum in London, but Bergen's was the first to acquire a position in the permanent collection of a museum. =Elephant Parade 2011= In 2011, Elephant Parade elephants swarmed the streets of four cities. The first Elephant Parade that year was in Heerlen, from 25 March through 25 May, organized by Stichting Vrouwen laten Heerlen Glimlachen (Foundation Women Put a Smile on Heerlen) and exhibited 40 art elephants. The auction was held on 28 May 2011. Elephant Parades were also held in Copenhagen (1 June - 25 August 2011, 102 elephants), in Milan (16 September - 15 November 2011) and in Singapore (11 November 2011 - January 2012). =Elephant Parade 2012= In 2012, the Elephant Parade was held in Hasselt, Belgium, from 1 September to 1 November. =Elephant Parade 2013: Trier and Luxembourg= From 18 July to 18 October 40 elephants were on display in Trier and 55 in Luxembourg, the first time cities in Germany and Luxembourg have hosted the Elephant Parade. =Elephant Parade 2014: Hong Kong= In 2014 Elephant Parade came to Hong Kong where it had over 100 statues on display. The auction raised approximately $277,398 which was donated to the Asian Elephant Foundation, whose conservation efforts range from funding hospitals to lobbying governments. =Elephant Parade: Welcome to America= Also in 2013, for the first time on American soil, dozens of life- size baby elephant sculptures were on display in the Orange County, California seaside city Dana Point. Elephant Parade USA Ambassador Dana Yarger appeared on a local Los Angeles news station in May 2013 to advertise the event. Since Dana Point is only south of Hollywood, actors and artists, (including Khloe Kardashian, Lily Tomlin, Loree Rodkin, Phyllis Stuart, Li Bingbing, and other entertainment industry personalities) were participating artists. = Elephant Parade 2015: Florian√≥polis = In December 2015, for the first time in Brazil, Elephant Parade was held in Florian√≥polis, until March 2016. The sculptures were placed around the city, both the island and the continent. = Elephant Parade 2017: S√£o Paulo = In June 2017, Elephant Parade was held in S√£o Paulo. Around 85 sculptures were created and placed in public places around the city, making the Parade the largest art exhibition in the city's history.https://www.elephantparade.com/parades/s%C3%A3o-paulo-2017/ = Elephant Parade 2018: Rio de Janeiro = From August to November 2018, Elephant Parade was held in Rio. The concept of the event was \\"Colorir o Rio √© a Parada\\".http://elephantparade.com.br/rio2018/ Supporters Supporters of Elephant Parade include Boris Johnson (Mayor of London), Sarah, Duchess of York, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, Goldie Hawn, Khloe Kardashian, Katy Perry, Tommy Hilfiger, Isaac Mizrahi, Lucy Fleming, jewellery designer Loree Rodkin, Diane von F√ºrstenberg, Paul Sorvino, Ilse DeLange, Jan Mol, Joanna Lumley, Job Cohen (mayor of Amsterdam), Jonnie Boer, Michael Palin, Rob de Nijs, and Prince Henrik of Denmark, who also created an elephant for Elephant Parade Copenhagen.

Wards in grey were not contested in 2011. The 2011 Great Yarmouth Borough Council election took place on 5 May 2011 to elect members of Great Yarmouth Borough Council in Norfolk, England. One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. At the same time as the election, the introduction of a directly elected mayor in Great Yarmouth was rejected in a referendum. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 24 *Labour 15 Background Before the election the Conservatives ran the council with 24 seats, compared to 15 for Labour. 13 seats were being contested with Labour targeting Caister North and St Andrews, while the Conservatives were threatening Caister South and Nelson wards. Election result The results saw the Conservatives remain in control of the council, with no change in their majority. The Conservatives gained one seat from Labour in Caister South, but lost a seat back in St Andrew's by 54 votes. The successful Labour candidate in St Andrew's ward was Barbara Wright, the wife of the former Member of Parliament for Great Yarmouth Tony Wright. Meanwhile, Kerry Payne held the seat in Nelson for Labour, despite being challenged by the incumbent councillor Brenda Taylor, who ran as an independent after being de-selected by Labour. Referendum on an elected mayor At the same time as the council election Great Yarmouth held a referendum on whether to introduce a directly elected mayor. This came after the Labour councillors Michael Castle and Trevor Wainwright collected the necessary 3,500 signatures, 5% of the population of the area. However both the local Conservative and Labour parties opposed the introduction of a directly elected mayor, with the Conservative leader of the council, Barry Coleman, leading the campaign for a no vote. The results of the referendum saw 15,595 vote no, as against 10,051 yes, with 291 ballot papers being spoilt, therefore the introduction of a directly elected mayor was rejected.

It originally aired on NBC on April 21, 2011. The episode was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling. \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" guest stars Will Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers and Jack Coleman as State Senator Robert Lipton. The series depicts the everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) trains his office replacement, Deangelo Vickers (Ferrell) on how to properly host the branch's annual Dundie Awards. Michael soon learns that Deangelo has a terrible problem with speaking in front of others. Meanwhile, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) grows to dislike her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). The episode‚Äîwhich was originally going to be called \\"Goodbye, Michael Part 1\\"‚Äîwas the first installment in the series to be both written and directed by Kaling, who also portrays Kelly Kapoor on the series. The episode also marks the second appearance of Ferrell as Deangelo Vickers; Ferrell had signed onto the series to make Carell's exit transition easier. The episode received mostly positive reviews from television critics. \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" was viewed by 6.849 million viewers and received a 3.3 rating among adults between the age of 18 and 49. The episode was the highest-rated NBC series of the week that it aired, as well as the sixth-most watched episode in the 18‚Äì49 demographic for the week it aired. Plot At the office, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) announces to the employees that Deangelo Vickers (Will Ferrell) will be his co-host at the Dundies. The Dundies are an annual award program created by Michael to motivate his employees. The idea of performance is worrisome to Deangelo, but Michael insists he take the job. Michael brings some of the staff together in the conference room to help Deangelo get prepared for the show, but he struggles to be humorous. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) tries to help him, saying he should just think of performing like conducting a meeting, but Michael objects, wanting Deangelo to mimic his style. Michael tries a number of different things to help Deangelo, such as sitting on his stomach and making him listen to a Walkman at full volume so he cannot hear himself think, but none are effective. Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) and Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) see Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) eating lunch alone in her car. She explains that she has begun doing this to get some time away from Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods), whom she is starting to despise. Pam advises Erin to tell Gabe her real feelings as soon as possible. This amuses Jim, given Pam's history with Roy Anderson, and he leaves in order to avoid the temptation to comment on the irony. After work, the employees arrive at an Italian restaurant named Louie Volpe's to celebrate the Dundies. Moments after being introduced, Deangelo disappears into the bathroom to vomit. Eventually, Michael is able to psych him up, and the show begins. The show continues to go poorly, with most of Michael's jokes offending more than amusing the employees. Dwight wins the \\"Promising Assistant Manager\\" Dundie, but as he is still mad at Michael for not recommending he replace Michael, he tosses his award in the trash. Erin wins the \\"Cutest Redhead\\" award and gives a speech in which she breaks up with Gabe, who takes the stage to protest, then leaves in humiliation. Michael awards Deangelo with the \\"Best Dundies Host\\" award. The staff urges him to make a speech, but as he nervously tries to yell over his Walkman, the ceremony is kicked out of the restaurant. Michael is upset that his last Dundies Award show was a disappointment, but the staff convinces him to continue the event at the office. After Dwight, still angry with Michael, insults the Dundies and leaves, Michael and Deangelo continue the event in the conference room. After the last award, Andy leads the employees in serenading the soon-to-depart Michael with an altered version of the song \\"Seasons of Love\\" called \\"9,986,000 Minutes;\\" Michael is touched, stating that \\"this is gonna hurt like a motherfker.\\" Production \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" marked Will Ferrell's second appearance on The Office. \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" was written and directed by co-executive producer Mindy Kaling, the first time that she has both directed and written an episode of the series. Kaling was also the writer of the second season episode \\"The Dundies\\", an episode to which \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" serves as a sequel in many ways. The episode was originally titled \\"Goodbye, Michael Part 1\\" before NBC announced that \\"Goodbye, Michael\\" would be an extended 36-minute episode and this episode was re-titled \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\". In the episode, a cue card features Dwight's last name spelled incorrectly as \\"Shrute\\". Kaling later admitted on Twitter that she had spelled the name that way \\"in every script I've written since 'Hot Girl'.\\" The episode is the second of Will Ferrell's four-episode guest stint on the series. Ferrell signed on to appear in Carell's final three episodes, and the first episode without Carell, \\"The Inner Circle\\", to make Carell's transition easier. Ferrell initially called the producers and offered to appear in a few episodes in Carell's last season, because he is \\"a fan and wanted to commemorate Carell‚Äôs swan song\\". He had previously starred alongside Carell, in the 2004 film, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. The Season Seven DVD contains a number of deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Michael talking about his last Dundies using comedians as metaphors, Dwight booing Deangelo in order to adequately prepare him for his actual speech, various clips from the actual Dundies awards and of people accepting their awards, a cut scene featuring a video of Michael interviewing Danny Cordray (Timothy Olyphant) at his house, and Andy talking to Erin about loading the printer so that she can take her mind off of Gabe. Cultural references In this episode, Michael Scott describes the Dundies as \\"like the Golden Globes but less mean\\", referring to Ricky Gervais' hosting of the 2011 Golden Globe Awards, which left critics questioning if he had gone \\"too far\\". As executive producer of the American series and creator of the original British series, Gervais stated on his blog that the line was intended as \\"a little in-joke\\". Near the beginning of the episode, Deangelo compares Meredith Palmer's (Kate Flannery) house to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Michael notes that \\"When Larry King died, they didn't just cancel his show\\", showing that Michael is unaware that Larry King is not deceased. Later, he notes that \\"they got Piers Morgan to come in and do his show\\" instead. The final song that the office sings to Michael is a parody of \\"Seasons of Love\\" from the Broadway musical Rent. Dwight later reveals in a talking head that he is always the padawan learner, and never a Jedi knight, a reference to the 1977 film Star Wars and its franchise. Michael notes that he wanted his last Dundies celebration to be like the 1990 film The Godfather Part III, rather than the \\"confusing\\" 1972 film The Godfather I, which he notes had \\"three big laughs\\". Additionally, the episode contains several references to the film The King's Speech, notably during the scene in which Deangelo gives his speech at the Dundies while listening to his Walkman played at a high volume. Reception In its original American broadcast, \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" was viewed by an estimated 6.849 million households and received a 3.3 rating/10% share in the 18‚Äì49 demographic. This means that it was seen by 3.3% of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 9% of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of the broadcast. This marked a significant drop in the ratings from the previous episode, \\"Training Day\\". Despite this, the episode became the highest-rated NBC program for the original week it aired and also became the sixth-most-watched show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 18‚Äì49. The episode received a moderately positive review from Cindy White of IGN. She said \\"the laughs were scarce this episode\\" but the lack of humor was compensated by the \\"emotional highlights\\". However, she praised the performances of many of the supporting cast. She ultimately gave the episode a 7 out of 10, denoting a \\"good\\" episode. Alan Sepinwall of HitFix felt that the episode was \\"very up-and-down\\", largely due to inconsistent writing. He did, however, feel that the ending song was \\"beautiful\\" and \\"enough to justify\\" the episode. Dan Forcella of TV Fanatic awarded the episode four-and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"funny and sweet\\" and \\"a perfect penultimate episode for Steve Carell\\". Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\". He felt that it was appropriate that Steve Carell's time on the series was bookended largely by the Dundies; he noted that the episode in which the awards were introduced‚Äîthe eponymous second season entry‚Äîserved as \\"a second pilot of sorts\\" for the series, and the idea to bring the Dundies back made sense at the time in order to see how the characters had grown. However, he felt that the episode at large did not live up to its source material, and that it was \\"occasionally funny but unfortunately meaningless\\". The ending song, however, in McNutt's opinion, was a highlight of the episode. Will Ferrell's character received criticism in the episode. White criticized Deangelo Vickers, noting that she did not have a handle on the character and that he was too \\"downright normal\\" and \\"practically boring\\". McNutt argued that, while Ferrell \\"is not really the problem with the role\\" of Deangelo Vickers, the actions between Ferrell and Carell felt more like \\"hanging out to commemorate the former‚Äôs departure from a television show\\" rather than the two playing believable characters. He also felt that Deangelo \\"feels disruptive to the show‚Äôs narrative\\" because his character gets in the way of the plot. Sepinwall felt that parts of the episode fell flat because it spent \\"so much time giving Will Ferrell stuff to do\\". He further noted that \\"nobody has come up with a good reason for him being here other than that he's Will Ferrell.\\" References External links * \\"Michael's Last Dundies\\" at NBC.com The Office (American season 7) episodes 2011 American television episodes Television episodes written by Mindy Kaling ","title":"Michael's Last Dundies"},{"id":"31477188","text":"The Secret of Blood Island is a 1964 British war film directed by Quentin Lawrence and starring Jack Hedley, Barbara Shelley and Patrick Wymark.

In 2011 Russian Helicopters and the Italian company AgustaWestland agreed to establish HeliVert, a joint company, in order to start production in Russia of the AW139 twin-engine multipurpose helicopter. The production plant is located in Tomilino, Moscow Region. In 2016 the company delivered 189 aircraft to customers in 13 countries. In the same year, it ended a partnership with the Ukraine-based engine maker Motor Sich. In 2017 the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) formed a consortium comprising leading Middle Eastern funds and finalized a deal to acquire a minority stake in Russian Helicopters (part of the Rostec State Corporation). Russian Helicopters valuation was estimated at $2.35 billion. No details have been revealed about the identity of the Middle Eastern investors. The transaction consists of two stages. The first stage involves the sale of a 12% stake and an investment of $300 million, as well as an agreed-upon subsequent potential increase in investment to $600 million. The deal will increase the authorized capital of the holding company. This will accumulate a significant amount of funds within the Company. These funds are necessary for the implementation of the Company‚Äôs strategy and business plan, including the development of new types of helicopters. In addition, these funds will help implement the investment program of the holding company, as well as finance possible M&A; activities aimed at increasing the holding‚Äôs value and finance capital programs.

Along with the Huntsman Marine Science Centre, the Atlantic Salmon Federation, and the Charlotte County campus of the New Brunswick Community College, SABS is the core of a network of fisheries research and educational institutions in the area. SABS is Canada's first marine biological research station, having been established by the Department of Marine and Fisheries in 1899 as a temporary floating laboratory. The permanent station was officially established in 1908. The current Director is Dr. Thomas W. Sephton. Dr. Robert Stephenson is the leader of its Gulf of Maine Section, while Dr. Peter Lawton, Director of the Centre for Marine Biodiversity, is a Research Scientist at SABS. History In 1899, university professors from around Canada came to St. Andrews over the summer months to do field research work at Canada‚Äôs first marine biological station, which, at the time, was a floating scow. In 1908, permanent installations of the biological station were established with the main laboratory, a residence building, and an attic. There were long working tables, and storage area for materials and supplies. Dr. Archibald Gowanlock Huntsman was the Curator from 1912 to 1921 and Director from 1921 until 1933. The main lab was destroyed by fire in 1932 and replaced the following year by a fireproof lab, part of the complex that houses the SABS' library. After establishing the first freshwater biological research station in Canada at Gimli, Manitoba in 1929, the fisheries biologist Alexander Dimitrivitch Bajkov came to work at SABS in the 1930s. In 2009, a contract was awarded to construct a new wet laboratory building through consolidation of existing buildings into one state of the art wet lab facility that will house the majority of marine life and research operations; completion is expected by June 2012. Services The station's research includes aquaculture, oceanography, the sustainability of fisheries, stock assessments, aquatic environment, species at risk, and the biology of commercially harvested fish. SABS maintains a reservoir. It provides several services such as saltwater, freshwater and chemistry labs; quarantine water and marine fish rearing facilities; and electron microscopy. Minimal incubator spaces are available at SABS but they are available at the adjacent Huntsman Marine Science Centre. One of the labs studies Multi-trophic Aquaculture, growing different species in the same containers. The St. Andrews Biological Station Library did contain the world‚Äôs largest collection of northwest Atlantic material. It has collections in the areas of aquaculture, environmental chemistry, environmental sciences, marine biology, ocean sciences, population ecology, and toxicology. Library resources are available on site to the public. Charlotte McAdam is the Head Librarian. SABS publication is entitled \\"Environmental Science Research - St. Andrews Biological Station\\".

It is one of the general plant defense strategies against herbivores, the other being resistance, which is the ability of plants to prevent damage (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). Plant defense strategies play important roles in the survival of plants as they are fed upon by many different types of herbivores, especially insects, which may impose negative fitness effects (Strauss and Zangerl 2002). Damage can occur in almost any part of the plants, including the roots, stems, leaves, flowers and seeds (Strauss and Zergerl 2002). In response to herbivory, plants have evolved a wide variety of defense mechanisms and although relatively less studied than resistance strategies, tolerance traits play a major role in plant defense (Strauss and Zergerl 2002, Rosenthal and Kotanen 1995). Traits that confer tolerance are controlled genetically and therefore are heritable traits under selection (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). Many factors intrinsic to the plants, such as growth rate, storage capacity, photosynthetic rates and nutrient allocation and uptake, can affect the extent to which plants can tolerate damage (Rosenthal and Kotanen 1994). Extrinsic factors such as soil nutrition, carbon dioxide levels, light levels, water availability and competition also have an effect on tolerance (Rosenthal and Kotanen 1994). History of the study of plant tolerance Studies of tolerance to herbivory has historically been the focus of agricultural scientists (Painter 1958; Bardner and Fletcher 1974). Tolerance was actually initially classified as a form of resistance (Painter 1958). Agricultural studies on tolerance, however, are mainly concerned with the compensatory effect on the plants' yield and not its fitness, since it is of economical interest to reduce crop losses due to herbivory by pests (Trumble 1993; Bardner and Fletcher 1974). One surprising discovery made about plant tolerance was that plants can overcompensate for the damaged caused by herbivory, causing controversy whether herbivores and plants can actually form a mutualistic relationship (Belsky 1986). It was soon recognized that many factors involved in plants tolerance, such as photosynthetic rates and nutrient allocation, were also traits intrinsic to plant growth and so resource availability may play an important role (Hilbert et al. 1981; Maschinski and Whitham 1989). The growth rate model proposed by Hilbert et al. (1981) predicts plants have higher tolerance in environments that does not allow them to grow at maximum capacity, while the compensatory continuum hypothesis by Maschinski and Whitham (1989) predicts higher tolerance in resource rich environments. Although it was the latter that received higher acceptance, 20 years later, the limiting resource model was proposed to explain the lack of agreement between empirical data and existing models (Wise and Abrahamson 2007). Currently, the limiting resource model is able to explain much more of the empirical data on plant tolerance relative to either of the previous models (Wise and Abrahamson 2008a). It was only recently that the assumption that tolerance and resistance must be negatively associated has been rejected (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). The classical assumption that tolerance traits confer no negative fitness consequences on herbivores has also been questioned (Stinchcombe 2002). Further studies using techniques in quantitative genetics have also provided evidence that tolerance to herbivory is heritable (Fornoni 2011). Studies of plant tolerance have only received increased attention recently, unlike resistance traits which were much more heavily studied (Fornoni 2011). Many aspects of plant tolerance such as its geographic variation, its macroevolutionary implications and its coevolutionary effects on herbivores are still relatively unknown (Fornoni 2011). Mechanisms of tolerance plants utilize many mechanisms to recover fitness from damage. Such traits include increased photosynthetic activity, compensatory growth, phenological changes, utilizing stored reserves, reallocating resources, increase in nutrients uptake, and plant architecture (Rosenthal and Kotanen 1994; Strauss and Agrawal 1999; Tiffin 2000). =Photosynthetic rates= An increase in photosynthetic rate in undamaged tissues is commonly cited as a mechanism for plants to achieve tolerance (Trumble et al. 1993; Strauss and Agrawal 1999). This is possible since leaves often function at below their maximum capacity (Trumble et al. 1993). Several different pathways may lead to increases in photosynthesis, including higher levels of the Rubisco enzyme and delays in leaf senescence (Stowe et al. 2000). However, detecting an increase in environment does not mean plants are tolerant to damage. The resources gained from these mechanisms can be used to increase resistance instead of tolerance, such as for the production secondary compounds in the plant (Tiffin 2000). Also, whether the increase in photosynthetic rate is able to compensate for the damage is still not well studied (Trumble et al. 1993; Stowe et al. 2000). =Compensatory growth= Biomass regrowth following herbivory is often reported as an indicator of tolerance and plant response after apical meristem damage (AMD) is one of the most heavily studied mechanisms of tolerance (Tiffin 2000; Suwa and Maherali 2008; Wise and Abrahamson 2008). Meristems are sites of rapid cell divisions and so have higher nutrition than most other tissues on the plants . Damage to apical meristems of plants may release it from apical dominance, activating the growth of axillary meristems which increases branching (Trumble et al. 1993; Wise and Abrahamson 2008). Studies have found branching after AMD to undercompensate, fully compensate and overcompensate for the damage received (Marquis 1996, Haukioja and Koricheva 2000, Wise and Abrahamson 2008). The variation in the extent of growth following herbivory may depend on the number and distribution of meristems, the pattern in which they are activated and the number of new meristems (Stowe et al. 2000). The wide occurrence of overcompensation after AMD has also brought up a controversial idea that there may be a meristem relationship between plants and their herbivores (Belsky 1986; Agrawal 2000; Edwards 2009). As will be further discussed below, herbivores may actually be mutualists of plants, such as Ipomopsis aggregata, which overcompensate for herbivory (Edwards 2009). Although there are many examples showing biomass regrowth following herbivory, it has been criticized as a useful predictor of fitness since the resources used for regrowth may translate to fewer resources allocated to reproduction (Suwa and Maherali 2008). =Phenological change= Studies have shown herbivory can cause delays in plant growth, flowering and fruit production (Tiffin 2000). How plants respond to these phenological delays is likely a tolerance mechanism that will depend highly on their life history and other ecological factors such as, the abundance of pollinators at different times during the season (Tiffin 2000). If the growing season is short, plants that are able to shorten the delay of seed production caused by herbivory are more tolerant than those that cannot shorten this phenological change (Tiffin 2000). These faster recovering plant will be selectively favored over those that cannot as they will pass on more of their offspring to the next generation. In longer growing seasons, however, there may be enough time for most plants to produce seeds before the season ends regardless of damage. In this case, plants that can shorten the phenological delay are not any more tolerant than those that cannot as all plants can reproduce before the season ends (Tiffin 2000). =Stored reserves and resource reallocation= Resource allocation following herbivory is commonly studied in agricultural systems (Trumble et al. 1993). Resources are most often allocated to reproductive structures after damage, as shown by Irwin et al. (2008) in which Polemonium viscosum and Ipomopsis aggregata increased flower production after flower larceny. When these reproductive structures are not present, resources are allocated to other tissues, such as leaves and shoots as seen in juvenile Plantago lanceolata (Trumble et al. 1993; Barton 2008). Utilizing stored reserves may be an important tolerance mechanism for plants which have abundant time to collect and store resources, such as perennial plants (Tiffin 2000; Erb et al. 2009). Resources are often stored in leaves and specialized storage organs such as tubers and roots, and studies have shown evidence that these resources are allocated for regrowth following herbivory (Trumble et al. 1993; Tiffin 2000; Erb et al. 2009). However, the importance of this mechanism to tolerance is not well studied and it is unknown how much it contributes to tolerance since stored reserves mostly consist of carbon resources, whereas tissue damage causes a loss of carbon, nitrogen and other nutrients (Tiffin 2000). =Plant architecture= This form of tolerance relies on constitutive mechanisms, such as morphology, at the time of damage, unlike the induced mechanisms mentioned above. plant architecture includes roots to shoots ratios, stem number, stem rigidity and plant vasculature (Marquis 1996, Tiffin 2000). A high roots to shoots ratio will allow plants to better absorb nutrients following herbivory and rigid stems will prevent collapse after sustaining damage, increasing plant tolerance (Tiffin 2000). Since plants have a meristemic construction, how resources are restricted among different regions of the plants, referred to as sectoriality, will affect the ability to transfer resources from undamaged areas to damaged areas (Marquis 1996). Although plant vasculature may play important roles in tolerance, it is not well studied due to the difficulties in identifying the flow of resources (Marquis 1996). Increasing a plant's vasculature would seem advantageous since it increases the flow of resources to all sites of damage but it may also increase its susceptibility to herbivores, such as phloem suckers (Marquis 1996, Stowe et al. 2000). Measuring tolerance Tolerance is operationally defined as the slope of the regression between fitness and level of damage (Stinchcombe 2002). Since an individual plant can only sustain one level of damage, it is necessary to measure fitness using a group of related individuals, preferably full-sibs or clones to minimize other factors that may influence tolerance, after sustaining different levels of damage (Stinchcombe 2002). Tolerance is often presented as a reaction norm, where slopes larger than, equal to and less than zero reflect overcompensation, full compensation and undercompensation, respectively (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). =Scales of measurement= Both fitness and herbivory can be measured or analyzed using an absolute (additive) scale or a relative (multiplicative) scale (Wise and Carr 2008b). The absolute scale may refer to number of fruits produced or total area of leaf eaten, while the relative scale may refer to proportion of fruits damaged or proportion of leaves eaten. Wise and Carr (2008b) suggested that it is best to keep the measure of fitness and the measure of damage on the same scale when analyzing tolerance since having them on different scales may result is misleading outcomes. Even if the data were measured using different scales, data on the absolute scale can be log-transformed to be more similar to data on a relative (multiplicative) scale (Wise and Carr 2008b). =Simulated vs natural herbivory= A majority of studies use simulated or manipulated herbivory, such as clipping leaves or herbivore exclusions, due to the difficulty in controlling damage levels under natural conditions (Tiffin and Inouye 2000). The advantage of using natural herbivory is that plants will experience the pattern of damage that selection has favored tolerance for, but there may be biases resulting from unmeasured environmental variables that may affect both plant and herbivores. Using simulated herbivory allows for the control of environmental variables, but replicating natural herbivory is difficult, causing plants to respond differently from imposed and natural herbivory (Tiffin and Inouye 2000). Growing plants in the control environment of the greenhouse may also affect their response as it is still a novel environment to the plants. Even if the plots are grown in natural settings, the methods of excluding or including herbivores, such as using cages or pesticides, may also affect plant tolerance (Tiffin and Inouye 2000). Lastly, models have predicted that manipulated herbivory may actually result in less precise estimates of tolerance relative to that from natural herbivory (Tiffin and Inoue 2000). =Fitness traits= Many studies have shown that using different measurements of fitness may give varying outcomes of tolerance (Strauss and Agrawal 1999; Suwa and Maherali 2008; Banta et al. 2010). Banta et al. (2010) found that their measure of tolerance will differ depending on whether fruit production or total viable seed production was used to reflect fitness in Arabdopsis thaliana. Careful considerations must be made to choose traits that are linked to fitness as closely as possible when measuring tolerance. Tolerance-resistance trade-off It is classically assumed that there is a negative correlation between the levels of tolerance and resistance in plants (Stowe et al. 2000; Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). For this trade-off to exist, it requires that tolerance and resistance be redundant defense strategies with similar costs to the plant (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). If this is the case, then plants that are able to tolerate damage will suffer little decrease in fitness and so resistance would not be selectively favored. For highly resistant plants, allocating resources to tolerance would not be selectively favored as the plant received minimal damage in the first place. There is now increasing evidence that many plants allocate resources to both types of defense strategies (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). There is also evidence that there may not be a trade-off between tolerance and resistance at all and that they may evolve independently (Leimu and Koricheva 2006; Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007; Muola et al. 2010). Models have shown that intermediate levels of resistance and tolerance are evolutionary stable as long as the benefits of having both traits are more than additive (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). Tolerance and resistance may not be redundant strategies since tolerance could be necessary for damage from large mammalian herbivores or specialist herbivores which have the ability to circumvent resistance traits of the plant (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007; Muola et al. 2010). Also, as traits that confer tolerance are usually basic characteristics of plants, the result of photosynthetic on growth and not herbivory may also affect tolerance (Rosenthal and Kotanen 1994). =Ontogenetic shifts= It has been suggested that the trade-off between resistance and tolerance may change throughout the development of the plants. It is often assumed that seedlings and juveniles are less tolerant of herbivory since they did not develop the structures required for resource acquisition and so will rely more on traits that confer resistance (Boege et al. 2007; Barton 2008, Barton and Koricheva 2010; Tucker and Avila-Sakar 2010). Although many studies find lower tolerance in seedlings, this is not always the case, as seen in juveniles of Plant ago lanceolata which can fully compensate for 50% defoliation (Barton 2008). There is also the added complexity of shifts in herbivore communities as the plant develops and so may favor tolerance or resistance at different life stages (Barton and Koricheva 2010). Effects of resource levels on tolerance The response of plants to herbivory is often plastic and varies according to the conditions it is experiencing (Wise and Abrahamson 2005). The major resources that affect plant growth and also tolerance are water, light, carbon dioxide and soil nutrients. Water and light levels are generally assumed to be positively associated with tolerance (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). However, there are exceptions such as evidence of decreased tolerance in Madia sativa with increased water availability (Wise and Abrahamson 2007, Gonzales et al. 2008). Many studies have found CO2 levels to decrease tolerance in plants (Lau and Tiffin 2009). Increased nutrient levels are also commonly found to be negatively associated with tolerance (Wise and Abrahamson 2007). There are currently three prominent models that predict how resource levels may alter a plants 's tolerance to herbivory. =Growth rate model (GRM)= The GRM proposes that the growth rate of the plant at the time of damage is important in determining its response (Hilbert et al. 1981). Plants that are growing in stressful conditions, such as low resource levels or high competition, are growing below their maximum growth rate and so may have a higher capacity for regrowth after receiving damage (Hilbert et al. 1981). In contrast, plants in relatively benign conditions are growing near their maximum growth rate. These plants are less able to recover from damage since they are already near their innate maximum growth rate (Hilbert et al. 1981). =Compensatory continuum hypothesis (CCH)= The CCH suggests that there is a continuum of responses to herbivory (Maschinski and Whitham 1989). It predicts that plants growing in less stressful environment conditions, such as high resource or low competition, are better able to tolerate herbivory since they have abundant resources to replace lost tissues and recover from the damage. Plants growing in stressful environments are then predicted to have lower tolerance (Maschinski and Whitham 1989). =Limiting resource model (LRM)= This recently proposed model takes into account the resource that is limiting plant fitness, the resource affected by herbivory and how the acquisition of resources is affected by herbivory (Wise and Abrahamson 2005). Unlike the GRM and CCH, it is able to incorporate the type of damage received since different modes of herbivory may cause different resources to be affected by herbivory. The LRM encompasses every possible outcome of tolerance (i.e. equal tolerance in both environments, higher tolerance in low stress environments and lower tolerance in low stress environments) and allows multiple pathways to reach these outcome. Currently, the LRM seems to be most useful in predicting the effects that varying resources levels may have on tolerance (Wise and Abrahamson 2007). Meta-analyses by Hawkes and Sullivan (2001) and Wise and Abrahamson (2007, 2008a) found that the CCH and GRM were insufficient in predicting the diversity of plant tolerance to herbivory. Banta et al. (2010), however, suggested that the LRM should be represented as a set of seven models, instead of one, since each individual part of the LRM requires different assumptions. Selection on herbivores It is classically assumed that tolerance traits do not impose photosynthetic on herbivore fitness (Strauss and Agrawal 1999). This is in contrast to traits that confer resistance, which are likely to affect herbivore fitness and lead to a co- evolutionary arms race (Stinchcombe 2002; Espinosa and Fornoni 2006). However, there are possible mechanisms in which tolerance may affect herbivore fitness . One mechanism requires a genetic association between loci that confers resistance and tolerance either through tight linkage or pleiotropy (Stinchcombe 2002). photosynthetic for either trait will then also affect the other. If there is a positive correlation between the two traits, then photosynthetic for increased tolerance will also increase resistance in the plants. If there is a negative correlation between the two traits then photosynthetic for increased tolerance will decrease resistance. How common this association exists, however, is uncertain as there are many studies which find no correlation between tolerance and resistance and others which find significant correlations between them (Leimu and Koricheva 2006; Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007; Muola et al. 2010). If the traits that allow for tolerance affects the plant tissue's quality, quantity or availability, tolerance may also impose photosynthetic on herbivores. Consider a case where tolerance is achieved through activation of dormant meristems in the plants . These new plant tissues may be of lower quality than what was previously eaten by herbivores. herbivores which have higher rates of consumption or can more efficiently use this new resource may be selectively favored over those that cannot (Stinchcombe 2002). Espinosa and Fornoni (2006) was one study which directly investigated whether tolerance may impose photosynthetic on herbivores. As suggested by Stinchcombe (2002), they used plants which had similar resistance but differed in tolerance to more easily differentiate the effects of each trait. As expected, they found evidence that resistance in plants affected herbivore fitness, but they were unable to find any effects of tolerance on herbivore fitness . A recent model by Restif and Koella (2003) found that plant tolerance can directly impose photosynthetic on pathogens. Assuming that investment in tolerance will reduce plant fecundity, infection by pathogens will decrease the number of uninfected hosts. There may then be photosynthetic for decreased virulence in the pathogens, so that their plant host will survive long enough to produce enough offspring for future pathogens to infect (Restif and Koelle 2003). However, this may only have limited application to herbivores. Species interactions =Plant communities= Herbivory can have large effects on the succession and diversity of plants communities (Anderson and Briske 1995; Stowe et al. 2000; Pejman et al. 2009). Thus, plant defense strategies are important in determining temporal and spatial variation of plant species as it may change the competitive abilities of plants following herbivory. (Anderson and Briske 1995; Stowe et al. 2000). Past studies have suggested plant resistance to play the major role in species diversity within communities, but tolerance may also be an important factor (Stowe et al. 2000; Pejman et al. 2009). Herbivory may allow less competitive, but tolerant plants to survive in communities dominated by highly competitive but intolerant plant species, thereby increasing diversity (Mariotte et al. 2013). Pejman et al. (2009) found support for this idea in an experimental study on grassland species. In low resource environments, highly competitive (dominant) plants species had lower tolerance than the less competitive (subordinate) species. They also found that the addition of fertilizers offset the negative effects of herbivory on dominant plants. It has also been suggested that the observation of species that occur late in ecological succession (late-seral) being replaced by species that occur in the middle of ecological succession (mid-seral) after high herbivory is due to differences in tolerance between them (Anderson and Briske 1995; Off and Ritchie 1998). However, tolerance between these two groups of species do not always differ and other factors, such as selective herbivory on late-seral species, may contribute to these observations (Anderson and Briske 1995). =Mutualisms= The large number of studies indicating overcompensation in plants following herbivory, especially after apical meristem damage, has led some authors to suggest that there may be meristem relationships between plants and herbivores (Belsky 1986; Agrawal 2000; Edwards 2009). If herbivores provide some benefit for the plant despite causing damage, the plant may evolve tolerance to minimize the damage imposed by the herbivore to shift the relationship more towards mutualism (Edwards 2009). Such benefits include the release from apical dominance, inducing resistance traits to temporally separate herbivores, providing information of future attacks and pollination (Agrawal 2000). Ipomopsis aggregata One of the best examples occurs in Ipomopsis aggregata where there is increased seed production and seed siring in damaged plants compared to undamaged plants (Figure 4; Edwards 2009). The probability of attack after the first bout of herbivory is low in the environment inhabited by I. aggregata. Due to the predictability of attacks, these plants have evolved to overcompensate for the damage and produce the majority of their seeds after the initial bout of herbivory (Edwards 2009). Another example involves endophytic fungi, such as Neophtodium, which parasitize plants and produce spores that destroy host inflorescences (Edwards 2009). The fungi also produce alkaloids which protect the plant from herbivores and so the plant may have evolved tolerance to flower damage to acquire this benefit (Edwards 2009). Tolerance may also be involved in the mutualism between the myremecophyte, Cordia nodosa, and its ant symbiont Allomerus octoarticulatus (Edwards and Yu, 2008). The plant provides the ant with shelter and food bodies in return for protection against herbivory, but the ants also sterilize the plant by removing flower buds. C. nodosa is able to compensate for this by reallocating resources to produce flowers on branches not occupied by castrating ants (Edwards and Yu, 2008). A similar type of meristem involves plants and mycorrhizal fungi (Bennett and Bever 2007). Mycorrhizal fungi inhabit plant roots and increase nutrient uptake for the plant in exchange for food resources. These fungi are also able to alter the tolerance of plants to herbivory and may cause undercompesation, full compensation and overcompensation depending of the species of fungi involved (Bennett and Bever 2007). Agriculture Modern agriculture has focuses on using genetically modified crops which possess toxic compounds to reduce damage by pests (Nunez- Farfan et al. 2007). However, the effectiveness of resistance traits may decrease as herbivores fungi counter adaptations to the toxic compound, especially since most farmers are reluctant to assign a proportion of their land to contain susceptible crops (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007). Another method to increase crop yield is to use lines that are tolerant to herbivory and can compensate or even overcompensate for the damage inflicted (Nunez-Farfan et al. 2007; Poveda et al. 2010). Alterations in resource allocation due to herbivory is studied heavily in agricultural systems (Trumble et al. 1993). Domestication of plants by selecting for higher yield have undoubtedly also caused changes in various plant growth traits, such as decreased resource allocation to non-yield tissues (Welter and Steggall 1993). Alterations in growth traits is likely to affect plant tolerance since the mechanisms overlap. That domesticated tomato plants have lower tolerance to folivory than their wild progenitors suggests this as well (Welter and Steggall 1993). Most agricultural studies however, are more focused on comparing tolerance between damaged and undamaged crops, not between crops and their wild counterparts. Many have found crops, such as cucumbers, cabbages and cauliflowers, can fully compensate and overcompensate for the damaged received (Trumble et al. 1993). A recent study by Poveda et al. (2010) also found evidence of overcompensation in potato plants in response to tuber damage by the potato tuber moth, Phthorimaea operculella. Unlike previous examples, the potato plant does not reallocate resources, but actually increases overall productivity to increase mass of tubers and aboveground tissues (Poveda et al. 2010).

Although many of these vehicles would be dedicated 'radio vans' and would have the complex and expensive radio sets installed, the intention was also that general purpose vehicles could be issued in 'FFW' state with the low-cost but time-consuming cabling and equipment mounts already prepared. The actual sets themselves could be installed later, if a new radio vehicle was required owing to damage or breakdown. 'Wireless' is a period term for 'radio', particularly in British use. The two 'Fitted For ...' terms had distinct, but not obvious, uses in this particular context and are often confused.  Fitted For Wireless  = World War II = FFW was the first term to be used and was applied to radio vehicles during World War II. Vehicle mounted wireless equipment early in the war was typically the Wireless Set No. 9 or No. 11, but after introduction in 1941, the No. 19 quickly became the standard set. This was a large, heavy, valve set, requiring a large power supply from heavy lead-acid batteries. A typical radio vehicle at this period would be a Bedford MW light truck of 8cwt or 15cwt capacity. In its FFW configuration, this might be equipped with two No. 19 sets, one low-power operating alone and one high-power set equipped with an additional Amplifier RF No. 2. These sets were arranged on a fitted desk across the body of the truck, with four or eight 6 V lead-acid batteries beneath. Wartime sets generally required a 6 V or 12 V supply, and batteries were charged by a small petrol-engined charging set (generator) of 300 W, often the 'Chorehorse' type. When in use, this generator was carried out of the vehicle on a carrying frame and placed on the ground outside. The vehicle's own engine and lighting batteries were separate. Some vehicles were fitted with additional radio charging dynamos driven from a gearbox PTO. Later in the war, 24 V vehicles began to appear, firstly US-supplied armoured vehicles, further complicating the wireless supply considerations. In the case of the 19 set, a composite power supply that allowed 12 V, two-wire 24 V and 3-wire (i.e. 0 - 12 - 24 V) systems was introduced. This power supply also contained a vibrator type HT section so that the receiver section of the set could be run more economically. The largest of these World War II FFW vehicles were the 3-ton command vehicles on lorry chassis and the 6√ó6 AEC Armoured Command Vehicle., pp. 78‚Äî95 These were built for the use of staff officers and carried map tables, several telephones and other equipment, with space for a senior officer and his staff in command. As well as No. 19 sets, they also carried the high power and long range transmitter Wireless Sender BC-610. In this case they still carried the small 300 W charging set, but also a 3 kW generator set, usually an American-made Onan. Most radio use would be made when established as a temporary headquarters with long-wire aerials rigged, in which case the generator set would be used dismounted. When on the move, or during the course of a battle, the low-power radios could still be used from batteries, with vertical whip aerials. The small charging set could be used to recharge these, with less effort and also less noise to give away a position. = Post-World War II = After World War II, FFW configurations were produced for the Jeep, Austin Champ and Land Rover. In these smaller vehicles, it was necessary to construct racking to hold the sets and often to remove the rear seats. Owing to the small capacity of the Jeep and early Landrover charging systems, the 300W charging set was still required, although there was little space for it and was sometimes even mounted between the front seats. The Austin Champ was provided with a high-output generator and shielded ignition system from the outset, and was also built in a dedicated FFW version from 1954. Single-set installations were produced for the Jeep during World War II The introduction of the post-war and smaller C42 & C45 sets allowed a dual-set installation, even in these small 5cwt or ¬º-ton vehicles. Whip aerials for the VHF set(s) were installed on the front wings of these vehicles, together with their base-mounted Aerial Tuning Units to obtain maximum separation from any HF antenna. This practice became a distinctive feature of British Army vehicles in later years. Larger vehicles, such as the Austin K9 1-ton the Humber FV1600 series 1-ton or the 3-ton Bedford RL had a less rigid installation. While these vehicles were available in FFW versions that were merely cargo vehicles fitted with additional generator capacity and outlets, dedicated communications vehicles had wood-framed 'house bodies' built on the chassis with a fitted desk inside and a standard Wireless Control Harness type B The radio sets installed varied, according to the tactical role of the vehicle. Power was standardised at 24 volts (nominal) and in vehicles not equipped with power take-off facilities, still depended upon separate batteries and the use of a charging set.  Fitted For Radio  Land Rover 110 FFR, with wing mounted TRFA (Tuner Radio Frequency Antenna) boxes In the 1950s, two factors changed the provision of vehicle radio within the British Army. The first of these was a change of philosophy for battlefield radio communication as a result of wartime experiences and the political and military situation in Europe after 1945 which was addressed by the \\"New Range\\" of sealed, primarily VHF/FM Combat Net Radio introduced from 1954. This would later become known as the Larkspur series of equipment after the 1962 project to equip the whole army with the new radio system. This modern design of equipment, although still using valves, was lightweight and where possible avoided the motor-generator/ rotary converter power supplies of earlier generation equipment such as the No. 19 set, in order to reduce the sets' power requirements. The second factor was the development of the 'CT' (a contraction of CombaT) range of soft-skin combat vehicles, as a purpose- designed and more rugged alternative to the General Service vehicles based on modified commercial (CL) vehicles. These CT vehicles, particularly the FV1801 Austin Champ ¬º ton and the FV1600 series Humber 1 ton, were powered by the new Rolls-Royce B range engines. Drawing on wartime experience, these engines were designed with built-in radio suppression, especially their ignition system, and they were also available with purpose-designed high-output generators, and were based on 24v systems in accordance with agreements reached with the US and Canadian armies in 1948. These 25A generators were initially thought sufficiently powerful to supply and charge the radio batteries directly, no longer needing the separate charging set. The generator had an internal two- speed automatic gearbox, which increased the charging rate when the engine was running at near-idling speed. However it soon became clear that this was insufficient to meet the demands of the new sets and higher output systems based on alternators were later introduced. Fitted For Radio versions of the Champ and Humber were soon developed. This new term also represented a re- definition of the old FFW. FFR vehicles were those intended for immediate service with radios, and had the sets installed already. FFW now meant vehicles that were only partially equipped for radio use: the standard engine was suppressed against radio interference, the radio mounting racks were either installed, or their mounting brackets were attached to the vehicle body, and aerial mounts had been installed. The intention was that FFW was a low-cost addition at manufacture, but any FFW vehicle could now be rapidly upgraded to full FFR status in the field. Some FFR vehicles were supplied for specialised use (for example to the Royal Artillery) where non-standard radio equipment was to be fitted immediately, by unit workshops. Two radio versions of the soft-skin Humber were developed: the FV1602 with the same canvas-roofed general service truck body of the FV1601, with the addition of radio equipment. Secondly the FV1604 as a dedicated radio van, with a coachbuilt house body. When the supply of new Champs ceased in 1956, the production of FFR Land Rovers commenced, initially as 12Volt Rover Mk III and Mk V FFR's, but from 1958 (the start of the Series II Land Rover production - military designation Rover Mk VI) FFR switched to 24 Volt. The standard dynamo generator was initially replaced by a 40 Amp alternator with external rectifier stack mounted in front of the radiator for cooling giving the vehicle a distinctive appearance seen from the front of the vehicle, behind the radiator grille. Later vehicles were fitted with the AC90 alternator system manufactured by CAV which became a standardised system in light and medium British vehicles. FFR Land Rovers also had the front wing-mounted boxes for the 'Tuner Radio Frequency Antenna (TRFA)' antenna tuning units, with whip aerials mounted above them.

The Minister of Defence is appointed and removed from the post by the Prime Minister of Georgia. The ministry is currently headed by Irakli Garibashvili. History In the midst of dissolution of Soviet Union and political turmoil in Georgia in late 1980s, the Georgian military played an important role in the struggle for and retaining power. In November 1992, the Parliament of Georgia passed a law creating Council for National Security and Defense. The council reported all its activities to the parliament but was directly subordinate to the head of state and commander in chief of the armed forces. Eduard Shevardnadze was then appointed the Council Chairman. Georgian politicians Jaba Ioseliani and Tengiz Kitovani were appointed deputy chairmen by Shevardnadze while Tedo Japaridze, the Georgian MFA expert on the United States became the chairman's aide. The council had the full right to issue binding resolutions on military and security matters of Georgia. In May 1993, Ioseliani and Kitovani were relieved of their duties in the council and disbanded of their government power bases, allowing Shevardnadze to assume greater power. Ministry of Defence headquarters in Tbilisi The Ministry of Defence was established in 1991. When the Soviet Union ceased to exist, Georgia was able to retain only a few military assets of the Soviet Army stationed in the Georgian SSR with modest amounts of military equipment, most of them obsolescent. Due to the Georgian Civil War, the Georgian military shrunk and was limited in resources. Lack of financial resources forced the Georgian government to allocate less money to defence with defence budget being as little as GEL 55 million ($36.7 million) in 1999. There also was lack of coordination between seven independent armed forces which existed in Georgia in 1999, among them the Armed Forces, National Guard of Georgia, Border Guards, Interior Troops, Independent Assault Brigade, Police Special Duties Unit and Special Service for the Protection of the State (SSPS). By 2005 Georgian government consolidated the seven branches of the defence forces. The National Guard and the Independent Assault Brigade were incorporated into the Georgian Armed Forces under the Ministry of Defence, the Border Guards and Police Special Duties Unit were subordinated to the Ministry of Internal Affairs. The number of the active duty personnel in the Armed Forces was reduced to 15,000. As a part of Georgian foreign and security policy, the government has been trying towards progressive integration into European and Euro-Atlantic political, economic, and security structures. State Ministry for Euro-Atlantic Integration was also created as a part of the process. According to the amendment to the law on \\"Approval of the Number of Georgian Military Forces\\" passed on July 15, 2007 the number of military servicemen in the Georgian Military was increased by 5,000 servicemen bringing the total number to 37,000 military servicemen. =Ministers of War of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918‚Äì1921)= * Grigol Giorgadze, May 26, 1918 ‚Äì February 13, 1919 * Noe Ramishvili, February 14, 1919 ‚Äì December 1919 * Grigol Lordkipanidze, January 1920 ‚Äì September 23, 1920 * Ilia Odishelidze, (acting), September 23, 1920 - November 10, 1920 * Parmen Chichinadze, November 10, 1920 ‚Äì February 25, 1921 =People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs of the Georgian SSR (1921‚Äì1923)= * Shalva Eliava, September 15, 1921 ‚Äì November 14, 1923 =Ministers of Defense of the Republic of Georgia (From 1991)= Former Minister Sikharulidze with U.S. Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff James Cartwright (right) in 2009 * Joni Pirtskhalaishvili, September 15, 1991 ‚Äì January 2, 1992 * Levan Sharashenidze, January 2, 1992 ‚Äì May 8, 1992 * Tengiz Kitovani, May 8, 1992 ‚Äì May 5, 1993 * Giorgi Karkarashvili, May 6, 1993 ‚Äì February 11, 1994 * Eduard Shevardnadze (acting), February 11, 1994 ‚Äì April 25, 1994 * Varden Nadibaidze, April 25, 1994 ‚Äì April 27, 1998 * David Tevzadze, April 28, 1998 ‚Äì February 17, 2004 =Ministers of Defense of Georgia (From 2004)= * Gela Bezhuashvili, February 17, 2004 ‚Äì June 10, 2004 * Giorgi Baramidze, June 10, 2004 ‚Äì December 17, 2004 * Irakli Okruashvili, December 17, 2004 ‚Äì November 10, 2006 * David Kezerashvili, November 10, 2006 ‚Äì December 9, 2008 * Vasil Sikharulidze, December 9, 2008 ‚Äì August 27, 2009 * Bachana Akhalaia, August 27, 2009 ‚Äì July 4, 2012 * Dimitri Shashkin, July 4, 2012 ‚Äì October 25, 2012 * Irakli Alasania, October 25, 2012 ‚Äì November 4, 2014 * Mindia Janelidze, November 4, 2014 ‚Äì May 1, 2015 * Tinatin Khidasheli, May 1, 2015 ‚Äì August 1, 2016 * Levan Izoria, August 1, 2016 ‚Äì September 8, 2019 *Irakli Garibashvili - September 8, 2019 ‚Äì present Subordinate Institutions/Units Georgia MoD structure The ministry is headed by the Minister, aided by the First Deputy and two Deputy Ministers.

Career The sources are in some conflict as to the early career of this vessel. According to one source, Monte Cristo was built in 1891 in Everett, Washington.Findlay and Paterson, Mosquito Fleet of South Puget Sound, at 49. According to another source, Monte Cristo was built in Ballard, Washington, by John J. Holland, with engines provided by the Moran Brothers.Affleck, Edward L., ed., A Century of Paddlewheelers, at 96. The vessel's first owner was Henry Carstens, who had been a purser for the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company. He intended to use the boat on the Snohomish River. The vessel was 90 feet long. In 1893, Carstens sold Monte Cristo to Ernest Shellgren, who owned a store in Longbranch, Washington, where he was also the postmaster. Shellgren sold the vessel in 1896. In 1898, Monte Cristo was sold to interests who took the vessel to Alaska for use on the Stikine River, which was then thought to be an alternative \\"All-Canadian\\" route to the Klondike gold rush. Monte Cristo was the second vessel to ascend the Stikine River in the 1898 season. The vessel was reregistered in Canada and rebuilt to be longer, narrower, and heavier. In 1900, Monte Cristo was transferred to the Skeena River in British Columbia under the ownership of the firm of R. Cunningham and Son, of Port Essington, British Columbia, who were mounting a challenge to the domination of the Hudson's Bay Company on the Skeena River trade. Monte Cristo was later chartered by the Dominion government to be used again on the Stikine River for the construction of a telegraph line to the Yukon. One source says Monte Cristo was abandoned in 1903; another gives the year as 1922.

Police Technology and Forensic Science: History of the Lie Detector or Polygraph Machine.About.com Inventors. He was the first American police officer having an academic doctorate and to use polygraph in criminal investigations.Carlsen E (2010). Truth in the machine.

After a famed career in criminal investigation, he died of a heart attack in Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 72.Milestones on Time magazine Early life and career Larson was born in Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Canada, to Nordic parents. His family moved to New England in his early childhood, though his parents soon divorced. He studied biology at Boston University holding down odd jobs to support himself, ranging from busboy and paperboy to stonecutter and elevator operator. In 1915, he earned a master's degree with a thesis on fingerprint identification. This work inspired his interest in forensic science and led him to the University of California, Berkeley, where he obtained a Ph.D. in physiology in 1920.Alder, K (2007). The Lie Detectors: The History of an American Obsession. Free Press, Simon and Schuster, Inc, pp. 23-25. Having done moonlighting work as a student for the Berkeley Police Department, he joined the force in 1920. His great insight was to integrate a test for blood pressure, developed by William Moulton Marston, with measurements for pulse, respiration and skin conductivity, to make a comprehensive lie detection tool. He was also highly encouraged by his police chief August Vollmer. At the time of the invention of the polygraph, Larson was a 21-year-old medical student at the University of California, Berkeley. He later entered the field of forensic psychiatry. Invention of polygraph The instrument, with its diverse collection of physiological indices, became known as the polygraph, which Larson then fully developed for forensic use in 1921, and applied it in police investigations at the Berkeley Police Department.Matt√©, J A (1996). Forensic psychophysiology using the polygraph: scientific truth verification, lie detection. J.A.M. Publications, p. 22. Segrave, K (2004). Lie detectors: a social history. McFarland, pp. 18-19. His instrument provided continuous readings of blood pressure, rather than discontinuous readings of the sort found in Marston's device. The first practical use was in the summer of 1921. The San Francisco Call and Post arranged for Larson to use the apparatus to test William Hightower, accused of murdering a priest in San Francisco. The newspaper reported Larson‚Äôs findings the following morning: Hightower was pronounced guilty by impartial science. The graphic results of the interrogation were printed large across the page, with arrows marking each presumed lie. Vollmer exalted the machine to the press, which renamed it the 'lie detector.' However, Larson himself used to refer to his apparatus as a 'cardio-pneumo psychogram,' which basically consisted of a modification of an Erlanger Sphygmomanometer.The Polygraph Museum John Larson's Breadboard Polygraph Legacy Larson married Margaret Taylor, the freshman victim of the College Hall case and the first person he ever interrogated on the lie detector. Over the next fifteen years, he collected hundreds of files on successful criminal cases where his polygraph solved murders, robberies, thefts and sex crimes. His instrument was nicknamed 'Sphyggy' by the press who covered Larson‚Äôs crime solving escapades in the 1920s and 30's; Sphyggy because they couldn‚Äôt pronounce 'Sphygmomanometer.' John Larson‚Äôs California The polygraph is included in the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Almanac 2003's list of 325 greatest inventions. This first polygraph instrument of Larson is now at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.. It first appeared in action in a moving picture in 1926 in the silent police serial ‚Äò‚ÄôOfficer 444‚Äô‚Äô. Due to differing methods of using his device that Larson felt were incorrect and abusive by some law enforcement, he eventually came to regret having invented it.

Anne Dowriche was the daughter of Sir Richard Edgecombe and Elizabeth Tregian Edgecombe, who were from a prominent family in Cornwall. In 1580, she married a Puritan minister from Devon, with whom she had several children.Joann Ross, \\"Anne Dowriche\\" in Diana Maury Robin, Anne R. Larsen, and Carole Levin (eds.), Encyclopedia of Women in the Renaissance: Italy, France, and England. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2007; p. 115. Dowriche wrote The French Historie about the French Wars of Religion, \\"a 2,400 line poem, a long and inherently gory narrative epic about the long-winded French Wars of Religion during the C16\\",Sampson, Julie, Anne Dowriche/Edgcumbe's 'The French Historie' & its Westcountry connections, 2011 in which she speaks out against tyranny and justifies the Protestant Reformation. She described several tyrants who were slain by subjects and gave an account of the gruesome death of Charles IX of France, during whose reign the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre had taken place. After this, she addressed Elizabeth I of England, calling upon her to protect and lead her Protestant subjects.Mihoko Suzuki, \\"Warning Elizabeth with Catherine de' Medici's Example, Anne Dowriche's French Historie and the Politics of Counsel\\" in Anne J. Cruz, and Mihoko Suzuki (eds.), The Rule of Women in Early Modern Europe. Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 2009; p. 183. Dowriche also wrote Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, upon the Jailor's Conversion. She is also credited for writing other poetry that has not survived. Biography =Early life= Anne Edgecombe was born into the English gentry.White, Micheline, \\"Women Writers and Literary Religious Circles in the Elizabethan West Country: Anne Dowriche, Anne Lock Prowse, Anne Lock Moyle, Ursula Fulford, and Elizabeth Rous\\", 2005: p. 8 The Edgecombe family owned land and held a degree of economic and political power. The Edgecombes were ardent followers of the Protestant religion, which made them part of a minority in England and Europe as a whole. They were connected to a network of Protestants who used available literary talent, wealth, and power to promote Protestant causes.White 2005, p. 7. Anne was well educated as a girl, which is one indicator of her privileged social class. Some of Anne‚Äôs writing suggests that she may have been able to read Latin, which would be further evidence of the extent of her education.Bawcutt, N. W., \\"The ‚ÄòMyth of Gentillet‚Äô Reconsidered: An Aspect of Elizabethan Machiavellianism\\", p. 11 Some members of the Edgecombe family supported controversial Protestant activists. For instance, Anne‚Äôs brother Richard supported the Calvinist minister Melanchthon Jewell.White 2005, p. 11. Jewell preached illegally and was repeatedly imprisoned for his religious and political convictions. Despite this type of religious oppression, the Protestant faith was a cornerstone in Dowriche‚Äôs life and she was devoted to Protestant causes. Though she was limited by her gender at a time when women could not own property, Dowriche used her talents as a writer to promote her views.White 2005, p. 18. The writer Anne Locke was a fellow Protestant reformer who was connected to Dowriche through intermarried family members.White 2005, p. 12. Like Dowriche, Anne Locke was a female poet who also wrote in support of the Protestant faith. Some scholars have noted similarities between Locke‚Äôs poem entitled \\"The Necessitie and Benefite of Affliction,\\" and Dowriche‚Äôs \\"Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion\\".White 2005, p. 14. Both poems advocate Protestantism and encourage the reader to repent and follow God. Some scholars speculate that, given the women‚Äôs geographic and ideological proximity, Dowriche and Locke may have directly impacted one another‚Äôs writing.White 2005, p. 13. =Marriage= In 1580 Anne Edgecombe married Rev.

Anne and Hugh had 6 children, Elkana, Walter, Mary (born 1587), Elizabeth, Anne (born 1589), and Hugh (born 1594). =Politics= A Protestant, Dowriche supported Queen Elizabeth I, who faced death threats because she led a Protestant regime.Sondergard, Sidney L., Sharpening Her Pen: Strategies of Rhetorical violence by Early Modern English Women Writers, 2002: p. 67 Controversially, Dowriche was a proponent of eradicating the Catholic faith, arguing that Protestantism was the rightful path to God. Dowriche was linked to other Protestants who also held the radical belief that Catholicism should be abolished. Works Dowriche‚Äôs writings focus on the Protestant faith and what she viewed as the rightful path to God. In her poem The French Historie, Dowriche wrote about the plight of French Protestants, a religious group which was persecuted during the 16th century.. Martin, Randall, \\"Anne Dowriche's ‚ÄòThe French History‚Äô, Christopher Marlowe, and Machiavellian Agency\\", 1999: p. 1 =The French Historie= Dowriche published her 2,400-line poem The French Historie in 1589.Martin 1991, p. 2. The poem is a fictionalized retelling of the French Wars of Religion, a bloody conflict primarily occurring between Catholics and Huguenots from 1562 to 1598. Huguenots were French Protestants who harshly criticized the Catholic Church. They were widely persecuted in France, which led to a mass exodus of Huguenots to other countries. Dowriche recalls the persecution of Huguenots with tales of Huguenot martyrs. By poetically describing the Huguenots‚Äô resistance in the face of Catholic persecution, Dowriche endeavored to inspire English Protestants to rebel against Catholicism.Matchinske, Meagan, \\"Moral, Method, and History in Anne Dowriche‚Äôs The French Historie\\", pp. 5‚Äì6 The French Historie opens with a fictional exchange between an Englishman and a Huguenot refugee from France. Their exchange acts as a frame for the narrative of the poem, a common device in Elizabethan writing. The plight of the Huguenots in The French Historie echoes the stories of suffering and redemption of the Israelites in the Old Testament. Dowriche‚Äôs allusions to both contemporary and biblical texts are evidence that she was well read, an unusual trait for the majority of English women at this time. The French Historie chronicles three pivotal events in the French Wars of Religion, beginning with an uprising against Huguenots in Paris. The poem then moves to the execution of Anne du Bourg, a counselor in the Parliament of Paris who opposed using capital punishment for crimes of heresy.Matchinske, p. 2. The third major event of the poem is a retelling of the bloody St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Day Massacre, an attack against Huguenots which began in Paris in 1572 and spread throughout France. Dowriche imagines the queen of France, the devoutly Catholic Catherine de Medici, fiercely proposing the infamous St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Day Massacre. While St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Massacre was a real series of events, Dowriche invented the detail that Catherine de Medici proposed the killings. Though Catherine de Medici is a villainous character in The French Historie, Dowriche also imbues her and other female characters with capabilities which were traditionally ascribed only to men. Dowriche‚Äôs imagining of de Medici‚Äôs power, will, and ruthlessness subverts traditional representations of women as meek and submissive. In The French Historie, Dowriche characterizes the targeted murders of Huguenots as the work of Satan. Satan appears in the text to influence Catherine de Medici and others to commit atrocities. Dowriche sympathetically portrays Huguenot scholars and preachers who were martyred for their religious beliefs. Ultimately, the French narrator calls on Queen Elizabeth to defend Protestants in England.Matchinske, p. 9. =The French Historie in relation to other literary works= For historical information, Dowriche consulted Thomas Tymme‚Äôs The Three Partes of Commentaries, Containing the Whole and Perfect Discourse of the Civill Warres of Fraunce. Tymme‚Äôs work is a translation of an earlier historical account written by Pierre de La Place, who was killed during the St. Bartholomew‚Äôs Day Massacre. Numerous scholars argue that Dowriche‚Äôs The French Historie may have inspired Christopher Marlowe‚Äôs The Jew of Malta.Hager, Alan, Encyclopedia of British Writers: 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries, 2005: p. 123 The Jew of Malta, in turn, influenced William Shakespeare‚Äôs The Merchant of Venice. =\\"Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor's Conversion\\"= Anne Dowriche published her poem \\"Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon a Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion\\" in her husband Hugh‚Äôs 1596 work, The Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion. The Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion is a sermon describing Acts 16:30, in which the jailer of Paul and Silas experiences a conversion.White 2005, p. 9. Hugh argued that this sermon, which he delivered 16 years before it was published, was relevant once more due to what he saw as a time of spiritual regression. Anne‚Äôs poem \\"Verses Written by a Gentlewoman, Upon the Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion\\" occurs in the prefatory material of Hugh‚Äôs sermon and follows a ballad meter. In her poem she criticizes magistrates who mask the truth as \\"sedition and conspiracy.\\" Both Anne and Hugh praise believers who are willing to repent and sacrifice for God. They also emphasize willingness to suffer for one‚Äôs faith through imprisonment and are strongly anti-Catholic. In this respect, their writings are in keeping with the Puritan faction of the church, which also focused on resisting Catholicism. The Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion urges readers to completely submit to the Bible‚Äôs authority and admonishes what the Dowriche‚Äôs view as rampant spiritual lethargy. The Jaylor‚Äôs Conversion would have found a receptive audience among the network of Protestant activists and believers connected to Anne Dowriche.

Crime rates soared, and reporter Bill Seldon for the Atlanta Constitution highlighted the project in a series of articles comparing the high number of killings in Atlanta to Vietnam. These articles led to East Lake Meadows gaining the nickname of \\"Little Vietnam\\", and helped contribute to the turning of public opinion against public housing. In the 1990s, as part of his efforts to revitalize the East Lake neighborhood, developer and philanthropist Tom Cousins began working with the AHA to replace East Lake Meadows with a mixed-income community. This took place in a larger context of tearing down Atlanta's public housing.

The site is now classified as part of the neighborhood of Brookview Heights. In 1980, a water tube boiler explosion at the onsite Gate City Day Care Center killed four children and a teacher and injured seven others. The residents of Bowen Homes thought the deaths were related to the Atlanta child killings of the late 1970s to early 1980s but it turned out to be a faulty water tube overheating. A furnace exploded on June 4, 2007, with no fatalities and one injury. The explosion caused damage to the interior of the building. A.D. Williams Elementary School is still standing to this day.

The pistol can fire .177 pellets, ball bearings, darts and also corks. The Gat pistol has also become popular in funfairs and arcade stalls. Another example is the Gat Air Rifle,Gat air rifle produced from 1988.  History  The Gat was produced from the late 1930s to the mid 1990s by T J Harrington & Co Ltd. of Magda Works, Walton on Thames, Surrey. There was a break in production during World War II, resuming shortly afterwards. Production finally ended with the death of Mr Harrington, increasing overseas competition and a declining public interest in 'nasty bits of machinery'. Other Harrington products included the 'Ding Dong' slingshot and the 'Little Kraka' fishing reel, both using similar die-cast construction.  Operation  Cocked Breech open The 'push barrel' operating mechanism of the Gat is simple and distinctive. The mechanism is an 1871 invention by Quakenbush. A cocked Gat appears to have a fixed circular barrel protruding from a receiver that is also of roughly circular section. When fired, an inner section of the barrel, previously hidden, is driven forward by a spring and so the fired Gat then appears to have a three-section barrel (as illustrated). Cocking is performed by pushing this inner section back into the middle section. The middle 'barrel' is no more than a shroud over the operating spring and was not part of Quackenbush's original patent. This forward-moving barrel has given rise to the view that the Gat is not an air weapon at all, but simply a spring catapult. This is incorrect. The piston is a leather seal around the outside of the inner barrel, running in a larger concentric cylinder within the receiver. The barrel and piston are driven forward when fired, air passing into the chamber from two small transfer ports drilled at the rear of the barrel, just ahead of the leather seal. Loading is by a screw breech at the rear. The pellet is pushed far down the barrel by a long pin on this breech, until it is past the air port. If the breech pin is lost, the pistol cannot be loaded. A common replacement, given the nature of the pistol's users, was to replace the pin with another screw or other sort of extemporised plug. This does not work, the pellet in some cases even being fired backwards out of the breech. The Gat is a low power and inaccurate weapon. The moving barrel during firing did not improve accuracy. Gats were supplied with a mixture of dart, pellet and cork ammunition. It was least inaccurate with darts, having inadequate power to give a pellet sufficient velocity for accuracy. It was this inaccuracy that made the cork firing Gat a favourite with shooting gallery stall owners at travelling fairs. A silver- coloured adapter screwed into the front of the barrel. This was used to fire bottle corks. Final versions of the Gat even included a plastic flyswatter that could be fired from this same adapter. A similar mechanism, although with rather better build quality and wooden grips, was used for the German-made Hy- Score 814 pistol and Diana Model 2.  Construction  The Gat was constructed cheaply and with little attempt at accuracy. Both frame and barrel were die- cast. In later years, plastic parts appeared in the trigger guard. Being die- cast rather than steel, the pistol was not blued but was painted black. A more expensive version was available in chrome plate, although these were rare.

G. Wodehouse from the 1924 Hungarian play J√°t√©k a Kast√©lyban (Play at the Castle) by Ferenc Moln√°r. It premiered in 1926 in New York.McIlvaine (1990), J30, p. 304. In the play, a playwright named Sandor Turai comes up with a plan to save the engagement between his nephew Albert and an actress named Ilona after Albert overhears a flirtatious conversation between Ilona and an obnoxious actor. The title comes from a quotation from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Act 2 Scene 2. Moln√°r's play was also adapted into an English-language play by Tom Stoppard, under the title Rough Crossing (1984). Plot The play takes place in summer in a castle on the Italian Riviera. The first act takes place at 2 a.m., the second act at 6 a.m., and the third act at 7:30 p.m., all on the same Saturday, August the twenty-first.Wodehouse (1983), pp. 4, 8. Sandor Turai, who has been a playwright for thirty years, and fellow playwright, Turai's life-long collaborator Mansky, are spending a couple of weeks at a castle, along with Sandor's young nephew, composer Albert Adam. Albert is engaged to prima donna Ilona Szabo. She is also staying at the castle, though they have not told her they are there yet. Turai, Mansky, and Albert overhear from Ilona's bedroom suggestive flirting between Almady, an actor who is married with children, and Ilona, who was once romantically involved with Almady. She eventually tells him to leave, but only after Albert has stopped listening. Albert is depressed because of what he heard and Turai is concerned for him. He thinks of a plan and starts writing in the library. At 6 a.m., polite footman Dwornitschek and two lackeys in livery deliver Turai's breakfast. Turai tells Ilona that he and Albert overheard her and Almady. She is alarmed since she truly wants to marry Albert. Turai says that he has a plan to help her, and also explains the situation to Almady, threatening to reveal the truth to Almady's wife in a telegram if he does not follow the plan. Turai's idea is that Ilona and Almady will pretend that they were merely rehearsing lines from a play. To make this believable, Turai spent the previous two hours writing the play, which includes the overheard lines. Turai insists the two actors must learn their lines and perform the play that night, to explain why they had to rehearse at 3 a.m. that morning. There will be a dress rehearsal in the evening and then the play will be performed in the after-dinner concert, in which Ilona and Almady were already scheduled to perform other acts. Following Turai's directions, Ilona notifies Mr. Mell, who is running the concert, about the change, and claims the play they will be performing was written by Sardou. In the evening, Mell oversees the rehearsal and Dwornitschek brings the props. Albert watches Ilona and Almady rehearse their scene. Turai helps prompt them in their lines, though he clearly gave Almady unnecessarily difficult names and lines to memorize. Mansky and Albert notice that some of the lines are identical to the ones they overheard and are convinced that Ilona and Almady were only rehearsing those lines earlier, while Turai feigns surprise. The suggestive dialogue from before is reworked with props to be innocent. Almady struggles more with his lines, which become very unflattering and self- deprecating. The rehearsal ends, and Almady decides to leave by train immediately after the concert. Albert praises Ilona's performance. He happily exits arm in arm with her and Turai is satisfied.

More than this, the WTMM is capable of partitioning the time and scale domain of a signal into fractal dimension regions, and the method is sometimes referred to as a \\"mathematical microscope\\" due to its ability to inspect the multi-scale dimensional characteristics of a signal and possibly inform about the sources of these characteristics. The WTMM method uses continuous wavelet transform rather than Fourier transforms to detect singularities singularity ‚Äì that is discontinuities, areas in the signal that are not continuous at a particular derivative. In particular, this method is useful when analyzing multifractal signals, that is, signals having multiple fractal dimensions.  Description  Consider a signal that can be represented by the following equation: : f(t) = a_0 + a_1 (t - t_i) + a_2(t - t_i)^2 + cdots + a_h(t - t_i)^{h_i} , where t is close to t_i and h_i is a non-integer quantifying the local singularity. (Compare this to a Taylor series, where in practice only a limited number of low-order terms are used to approximate a continuous function.) Generally, a continuous wavelet transform decomposes a signal as a function of time, rather than assuming the signal is stationary (For example, the Fourier transform). Any continuous wavelet can be used, though the first derivative of the Gaussian distribution and the Mexican hat wavelet (2nd derivative of Gaussian) are common. Choice of wavelet may depend on characteristics of the signal being investigated. Below we see one possible wavelet basis given by the first derivative of the Gaussian: : G' (t,a,b) = frac{a}{(2pi)^{-1/2}}(t - b) e^{left(frac{-(t-b)^2}{2a^2}right)} , Once a \\"mother wavelet\\" is chosen, the continuous wavelet transform is carried out as a continuous, square-integrable function that can be scaled and translated. Let a > 0 be the scaling constant and binmathbb{R} be the translation of the wavelet along the signal: : X_w(a,b)=frac{1}{sqrt{a}} int_{-infty}^infty x(t)psi^ast left(frac{t-b}{a}right), dt where psi(t) is a continuous function in both the time domain and the frequency domain called the mother wavelet and ^{ast} represents the operation of complex conjugate. By calculating X_w(a,b) for subsequent wavelets that are derivatives of the mother wavelet, singularities can be identified. Successive derivative wavelets remove the contribution of lower order terms in the signal, allowing the maximum h_i to be detected. (Recall that when taking derivatives, lower order terms become 0.) This is the \\"modulus maxima\\". Thus, this method identifies the singularity spectrum by convolving the signal with a wavelet at different scales and time offsets. The WTMM is then capable of producing a \\"skeleton\\" that partitions the scale and time space by fractal dimension.  History  The WTMM was developed out of the larger field of continuous wavelet transforms, which arose in the 1980s, and its contemporary fractal dimension methods. At its essence, it is a combination of fractal dimension \\"box counting\\" methods and continuous wavelet transforms, where wavelets at various scales are used instead of boxes. WTMM was originally developed by Mallat and Hwang in 1992 and used for image processing. Bacry, Muzy, and Arneodo were early users of this methodology. It has subsequently been used in fields related to signal processing.  References  * Alain Arneodo et al.

He is also regarded as one of the early innovators of the basketball jump shot and as a pioneer in the field of biomechanics and human movement. Biography =Early years= Cooper was born in Smith Mills, Kentucky in 1912. He was the oldest of six children born to Clay Calhoun Cooper, a cattleman, and Martha Barrett Randolph, a homemaker and boarding house operator.National Cremation Service, \\"John Miller Cooper, Ed.D.,\\" September 18, 2010. www.isurfnewshopkinsville.com/ Retrieved April 13, 2011. He attended Corydon High School (now closed) in Henderson County, Kentucky, transferring to Hopkinsville High School in Hopkinsville, Kentucky, in his senior year.Josh Weinfus, \\"Jump Shot Legend a Hoosier: Emeritus Professor of Kinesiology Popularized Technique,\\" Indiana Daily Student, December 13, 2002. Cooper received his Bachelor's in physics from the University of Missouri (MU). He later received his Masters' and Doctorate degrees in Education from that same institution. Cooper's doctoral studies were interrupted in 1940, when he joined the U.S. Army Air Forces. Cooper served 40 months in the military, achieving the rank of Captain, before being honorably discharged so that he might resume his studies. =Jump shot innovator= Cooper earned varsity letters in three separate sports at MU, including basketball. He is recognized by some basketball scholars as an early innovators of the jump shot, being perhaps the first college basketball player to use the technique as his primary offensive weapon. According to journalist Bill Pennington, writing in the New York Times in 2011, the origins of the \\"jumper\\" are a matter of significant scholarly dispute: > Basketball historians have narrowed the jump shot incubation period to the > early 1930s. And they have focused on a handful of athletes, with Cooper, a > college teenager eager to be airborne in a flat-footed, set-shot-taking > world, at center stage.Bill Pennington, \\"In Search of the First Jump Shot,\\" > The New York Times, April 2, 2011, New York edition, pg. SP6. According to Cooper himself, he learned the revolutionary shooting technique by watching a player from the University of Chicago team practicing at his high school's gym. \\"The ball came off the board; he jumped and shot it back in, in mid-air,\\" Cooper later recalled, noting that in the early days of the game shots were taken from a stationary position on the floor and that players catching the ball in mid-air would only throw the ball at the basket if they had no place to pass it. Inspired by what he had seen, Cooper intentionally practiced jumping and shooting the ball in mid-air during his high school career and brought the shot with him to MU. At MU, he was named All-Conference in the former Big Six Conference in 1932. Cooper's coach, George Edwards, was secretary of the College Basketball Coaches Association at the time and during one of their meetings, he asked his colleagues whether they had ever seen a player make regular use of the jump shot technique in game action. The coaches said they had not, lending credence to the assertion that Cooper was the first collegiate player to make use of the offensive innovation. The Basketball Hall of Fame, in Springfield, Massachusetts, has thus far rejected Cooper's claim to fame as originator of the jumper at the collegiate level, instead recognizing Kenny Sailors as the father of the technique. \\"Sailors was after my time,\\" Cooper later remembered. \\"He took the jump shot into the pros.\\" =Kinesiologist= In 1945, Cooper moved to California, where he taught kinesiology at the University of Southern California (USC) until 1966. While there, Cooper co-authored textbooks in kinesiology with his colleagues on the USC staff. In 1966, Cooper decided to return to his midwestern roots, accepting a position at Indiana University (IU). Cooper remained at IU until his retirement in 1982. Known internationally as the father of modern biomechanics and human movement, Cooper was the recipient of numerous prestigious honors. Noted for his unique and pioneering work in the field of kinesiology, the National Academy of Kinesiology sponsored a national lectureship in his name. In 1994, Cooper was awarded the Hetherington Award by the National Academy, and in 1995, he was the recipient of the Luther Gulich Award, the highest honor given in the field of Kinesiology. In 1991, he was inducted into the MU's Intercollegiate Athletics Hall of Fame. =Death and legacy= Cooper died on September 18, 2010, in Studio City, California, at the age of 98. He was preceded in death by his wife of 65 years, Charlianna. Cooper was eulogized by David M. Koceja, chair of IU's Department of Kinesiology: > [Cooper] was one of the most widely known researchers, authors, and > educators in the history of kinesiology. His research and teaching at > Indiana University brought international recognition to the reputation of > our graduate programs in general, and biomechanics in particular.

It is also equal to the highest rate at which entanglement can be generated over the channel, and forward classical communication cannot improve it. The quantum capacity theorem is important for the theory of quantum error correction, and more broadly for the theory of quantum computation. The theorem giving a lower bound on the quantum capacity of any channel is colloquially known as the LSD theorem, after the authors Lloyd, Shor, and Devetak who proved it with increasing standards of rigor.  Hashing bound for Pauli channels  The LSD theorem states that the coherent information of a quantum channel is an achievable rate for reliable quantum communication. For a Pauli channel, the coherent information has a simple form and the proof that it is achievable is particularly simple as well. We prove the theorem for this special case by exploiting random stabilizer codes and correcting only the likely errors that the channel produces. Theorem (hashing bound). There exists a stabilizer quantum error-correcting code that achieves the hashing limit R=1-Hleft(mathbf{p}right) for a Pauli channel of the following form: : rho mapsto p_{I}rho+p_{X}Xrho X+p_{Y}Yrho Y+p_{Z}Zrho Z, where mathbf{p}=left(p_{I},p_{X},p_{Y},p_{Z}right) and Hleft(mathbf{p}right) is the entropy of this probability vector. Proof. Consider correcting only the typical errors. That is, consider defining the typical set of errors as follows: : T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}equivleft{ a^{n}:leftvert -frac{1}{n} log_{2}left( Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} right) -Hleft( mathbf{p}right) rightvert leqdeltaright} , where a^{n} is some sequence consisting of the letters left{I,X,Y,Zright} and Prleft{E_{a^{n}}right} is the probability that an IID Pauli channel issues some tensor-product error E_{a^{n}}equiv E_{a_{1}}otimescdotsotimes E_{a_{n}}. This typical set consists of the likely errors in the sense that : sum_{a^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}}Prleft{E_{a^{n}}right} geq 1-epsilon, for all epsilon>0 and sufficiently large n. The error-correcting conditions. for a stabilizer code mathcal{S} in this case are that {E_{a^{n}}:a^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}} is a correctable set of errors if : E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}} otin Nleft(mathcal{S}right) backslash mathcal{S}, for all error pairs E_{a^{n}} and E_{b^{n}} such that a^{n},b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}} where N(mathcal{S}) is the normalizer of mathcal{S}. Also, we consider the expectation of the error probability under a random choice of a stabilizer code. Proceed as follows: : begin{align} mathbb{E}_{mathcal{S}}left{p_{e}right} &= mathbb{E}_{mathcal{S}} left{ sum_{a^{n}} Pr left{ E_{a^{n}}right} mathcal{I}left(E_{a^{n}}text{ is uncorrectable under }mathcal{S}right) right}  &leq mathbb{E}_{mathcal{S}} left{ sum_{a^{n} in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}} Prleft{E_{a^{n}}right} mathcal{I}left(E_{a^{n}}text{ is uncorrectable under }mathcal{S}right) right} + epsilon  &= sum_{a^{n} in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}} Prleft{E_{a^{n}}right} mathbb{E}_{mathcal{S}} left{ mathcal{I}left(E_{a^{n}}text{ is uncorrectable under }mathcal{S}right) right} + epsilon  &= sum_{a^{n} in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}} Prleft{E_{a^{n}}right} Pr_{mathcal{S}} left{E_{a^{n}}text{ is uncorrectable under }mathcal{S}right} + epsilon. end{align} The first equality follows by definition‚Äîmathcal{I} is an indicator function equal to one if E_{a^{n}} is uncorrectable under mathcal{S} and equal to zero otherwise. The first inequality follows, since we correct only the typical errors because the atypical error set has negligible probability mass. The second equality follows by exchanging the expectation and the sum. The third equality follows because the expectation of an indicator function is the probability that the event it selects occurs. Continuing, we have : =sum_{a^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}}Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} Pr_{mathcal{S}}left{ exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p} ^{n}}, b^{n} eq a^{n}, E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}}in Nleft( mathcal{S} right) backslashmathcal{S}right} : leqsum_{a^{n}in T_{delta}^{A^{n}}}Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} Pr_{mathcal{S}}left{ exists E_{b^{n}}:b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p} ^{n}}, b^{n} eq a^{n}, E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}}in Nleft( mathcal{S} right) right} : =sum_{a^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}}Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} Pr_{mathcal{S}}left{ bigcuplimits_{b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n} }, b^{n} eq a^{n}}E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}}in Nleft( mathcal{S}right) right} : leqsum_{a^{n},b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}, b^{n} eq a^{n}} Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} Pr_{mathcal{S}}left{ E_{a^{n}}^{dagger }E_{b^{n}}in Nleft( mathcal{S}right) right} : leqsum_{a^{n},b^{n}in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}, b^{n} eq a^{n}} Prleft{ E_{a^{n}}right} 2^{-left( n-kright) } : leq2^{2nleft[ Hleft( mathbf{p}right) +deltaright] }2^{-nleft[ Hleft( mathbf{p}right) +deltaright] }2^{-left( n-kright) } : =2^{-nleft[ 1-Hleft( mathbf{p}right) -k/n-3deltaright] }. The first equality follows from the error-correcting conditions for a quantum stabilizer code, where Nleft( mathcal{S}right) is the normalizer of mathcal{S}. The first inequality follows by ignoring any potential degeneracy in the code‚Äîwe consider an error uncorrectable if it lies in the normalizer Nleft( mathcal{S}right) and the probability can only be larger because Nleft( mathcal{S}right) backslashmathcal{S}in Nleft( mathcal{S}right) . The second equality follows by realizing that the probabilities for the existence criterion and the union of events are equivalent. The second inequality follows by applying the union bound. The third inequality follows from the fact that the probability for a fixed operator E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}} not equal to the identity commuting with the stabilizer operators of a random stabilizer can be upper bounded as follows: Pr_{mathcal{S}}left{ E_{a^{n}}^{dagger}E_{b^{n}}in Nleft( mathcal{S} right) right} =frac{2^{n+k}-1}{2^{2n}-1}leq2^{-left( n-kright) }. The reasoning here is that the random choice of a stabilizer code is equivalent to fixing operators Z_{1}, ..., Z_{n-k} and performing a uniformly random Clifford unitary. The probability that a fixed operator commutes with overline{Z}_{1}, ..., overline{Z}_{n-k} is then just the number of non-identity operators in the normalizer (2^{n+k}-1) divided by the total number of non-identity operators (2^{2n}-1). After applying the above bound, we then exploit the following typicality bounds: : forall a^{n} in T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}:Prleft{ E_{a^{n} }right} leq2^{-nleft[ Hleft( mathbf{p}right) +deltaright] }, :leftvert T_{delta}^{mathbf{p}^{n}}rightvert leq2^{nleft[ Hleft( mathbf{p}right) +deltaright] }. We conclude that as long as the rate k/n=1-Hleft( mathbf{p}right) -4delta, the expectation of the error probability becomes arbitrarily small, so that there exists at least one choice of a stabilizer code with the same bound on the error probability.

Architecture =Exterior= The church is constructed in sandstone, and the chancel and north wall have been rendered. The roof is tiled. The plan of the church is simple, consisting of a nave, a chancel with a north vestry, and a relatively large but short tower, through which the church is entered. The tower is in a single stage, and stands on a moulded plinth. It has diagonal buttresses, a battlemented parapet, and a pyramidal roof surmounted by a 20th-century cast iron weathervane. The bell openings are lancets and are louvred, with slit openings beneath them. On the west face of the tower is a plain round-headed doorway, with a double-lancet window above it. In the south wall of the nave are four two- or three-light windows, and in the north wall are two lancet windows. In the south wall of the chancel is a priest's door. The east window dates from the 19th century and is in Early English style. =Interior= Inside the tower is a porch and a timber staircase. The walls of the interior of the church are lime-washed, and the floors are tiled. On the north wall of the nave are wall paintings probably dating from the 13th century. They depict biblical scenes, including Cain and Abel and Christ's entry into Jerusalem. They were discovered in 1967 and restored by Mrs Eve Baker. Towards the west end of this wall is a niche. The chancel contains a 20th-century stone altar. The communion rails are dated 1662. The oak pulpit dates from the 19th century. The stone font is probably medieval, and consists of an octagonal bowl on a cylindrical shaft. Apart from brass plaques commemorating those who died in the World Wars, the only memorial in the church is a plain marble plaque dated 1834. Above the tower arch is a board painted with the royal arms. Also on the west wall are further boards inscribed with the Lord's Prayer and the Ten Commandments. The stained glass in the east window is dated 1905. External features In the churchyard are two chest tombs and 15 headstones, each of which has been designated as a Grade II listed building. One chest tomb is anonymous and dates from the 16th or 17th century. The inscription on the other tomb is illegible, but it is dated 1768. The named single headstones are to Jane and Samuel Brook, dated 1781, to Elizabeth Daniel, dating from the 17th century, to Thomas Larkin and his wife, dated 1769, to John Larkin, dated 1753, to John Millesden, dated 1758, to Elizabeth Relph, dated 1759, to Ann Town dated 1732, and to Ambrose Vineen and his wife, dated 1784. There are pairs of headstones to the Hubble family, dating from the middle of the 18th century, to the Kipping family dated from the 1680s, and to the Mills family from the late 18th century. There are also four illegible or anonymous single headstones.

It is given by the quantum mutual information of the channel, which is the input-output quantum mutual information maximized over all pure bipartite quantum states with one system transmitted through the channel. This formula is the natural generalization of Shannon's noisy channel coding theorem, in the sense that this formula is equal to the capacity, and there is no need to regularize it. An additional feature that it shares with Shannon's formula is that a noiseless classical or quantum feedback channel cannot increase the entanglement-assisted classical capacity. The entanglement-assisted classical capacity theorem is proved in two parts: the direct coding theorem and the converse theorem. The direct coding theorem demonstrates that the quantum mutual information of the channel is an achievable rate, by a random coding strategy that is effectively a noisy version of the super-dense coding protocol. The converse theorem demonstrates that this rate is optimal by making use of the strong subadditivity of quantum entropy.

History The castle was founded in 1100 and a new building was built around 1294/95. The castle was apparently built by the Saugern-Pfeffingen family as a seat for a Kastvogtei (or a vogt with authority over a religious structure) who ruled over Beinwil Abbey. The first mention of the castle comes from 1321 when it was called Bello. As heirs of the Saugern-Pfeffingen family, in the late 12th Century, the count of Thierstein took over the castle and the Kastvogtei post. By 1400 it was known as Thierstein Castle. The castle was occupied by the Canton of Solothurn in 1445, 1467 and 1499. After the extinction of the counts of Thierstein in 1522, Solothurn acquired the castle and made it the administrative center of the secular bailiwick of Thierstein. In 1798 the castle was sold for demolition. However, in the 19th Century, the destruction of the castle are stopped by private individuals who wanted to repair the ruins. The ruins were surveyed and archeologically investigated in 1985. Castle site The castle ruins are on a small rocky outcrop above the municipality of B√ºsserach. The ruin consists of a residential tower with ancillary buildings. Traces of a bailey and the old gate house on the south side can still be seen.

It is sometimes referred to as a Pleistocene lake. Lisan means tongue in Arabic relating to the shape of the Lisan Peninsula where studies of the sediment formations were taken. The sediment formations left by the lake extend from Lake Tiberias (the Sea of Galilee) in the north to a boundary ridge ca. 35 km south of the Dead Sea. The lake left behind a layer of lacustrine sediment that blankets the Jordan Valley with terraces of sediment up to 40 m thick. These sediments are commonly called marls and are composed of layers of true loam and calcareous silt loams mixed with other chemicals and salts. At its height, the lake covered several other basins in the area with a maximum area of ca. 2000 km2, a length of 200 km and a width of no more than 17 km. The formations were named the Lisan deposits and first described by Lartet in 1869 after visiting the Dead Sea in the Spring of 1864. He noted a correlation of a wet period in the Levant with a glacial period in Europe. It was not until geographer E. Huntindon visited in 1909 that it was realized it was measure of historical precipitation for the area. The first stratigraphic study of the sediments was carried out by Picard in 1943 who developed a chronology he called the Lisan series. It was not until later studies were carried out at lake level that a more detailed chronology of the lacustrine record was developed. These studies determined the highest stand of the lake to be around 160 metres below sea level at around 24,000 to 26,000 BC. when it formed a complete lake all the way along the Jordan Valley, approximately 200 metres higher than the current level of the Dead Sea. This started to decline around 17,000 BC with the sharpest drop in level occurring through 14,000 to 13,000 BC to around 500 metres below sea level, representing possibly the largest lake level drop in the last 70,000 years, occurring over a period of only around 1000 years. This rapid lowering created a flattened valley floor, known in modern times as the Ghor. Tectonic factors have been suggested as a possible cause for these events and it has been argued that the level receded as far as 700 metres below sea level, then gradually refilled. Climatic and tectonic changes caused the level in the Jordan Valley to fluctuate into the Holocene, leaving Lake Beisan in the basin around Beit She'an still extant into the Bronze Age. Archaeological evidence also supports these levels with no Kebaran sites located between 17,000 BC and 13,500 BC below a level of 203 metres below sea level. Early Natufian sites are also located between 215 and 230 metres below sea level, indicating a high level and receding shoreline after this date.

Myldred Cicyll' are stamped on the cover and the titlepage bears the autograph 'Mildred: Cecili' According to Caroline Bowden, she was educated at home by her father, Sir Anthony Cooke, who provided his five daughters with an education equal to that afforded to his sons.Mildred Cooke (August 24, 1524-April 4, 1589), A Who‚Äôs Who of Tudor Women: Cl-Cy,compiled by Kathy Lynn Emerson to update and correct Wives and Daughters: The Women of Sixteenth-Century England (1984) . In 1559 William Bercher attested to their learning in his Nobility of Women. John Strype lauded her ability to speak Greek as easily as English, and Roger Ascham, tutor to the future Elizabeth I, ranked Mildred Cooke and her sisters alongside Lady Jane Grey for their erudition. She served briefly at court as a lady of the privy chamber when Elizabeth I came to the throne in 1558. She had charge of her children's education, as well as that of the various royal wards for whom her husband was responsible, including Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, whom her daughter Anne eventually married. Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex was the ward of William Cecil. The Burghley household was one in which learning was valued: > Unlike Dudley [Cecil] was a scholar, a lover of books, and a man of great > intellectual curiosity. He and his wife Mildred...had their children tutored > to a high degree of erudition, and in their house Classical studies, > philosophy and science, and at least certain kinds of poetry and music could > seek refuge. Indeed, Cecil House was England‚Äôs nearest equivalent of a > humanist salon since the days of More. Lord Burghley went on to become Elizabeth I's most trusted adviser, and he and Lady Burghley entertained the queen on several occasions at their residences, including Theobalds. As the wife of the queen's chief adviser, Lady Burghley exercised influence in various ways, a circumstance that was recognized by the Spanish ambassador Guzman da Silva in 1567. While negotiations were ongoing for a marriage between the queen and Charles II, Archduke of Austria, Guzman wrote to Philip II that: > Cecil desires this business so greatly that he does not speak about the > religious point, but this may be deceit as his wife is of a contrary > opinion, and thinks that great trouble may be caused to the peace of the > country through it.

In 1560 three Scottish leaders corresponded with her regarding the Treaty of Edinburgh then being negotiated.

She also translated a work by John Chrysostom, which has not survived. In his will Lady Burghley's father, Sir Anthony Cooke, left her only three books; however she built up 'an impressive library mainly in Latin and Greek', described by Bowden as 'one of the finest private libraries of the day'. More than thirty books inscribed with her name are still extant, seventeen of them at Hatfield House. Her library included works in Greek, Latin, French, and English on a wide range of topics including history, literature, medicine, and theology, many of them printed on the continent. In 1580 she presented a polyglot Bible to St John's College, Cambridge, according to one source accompanied by a letter in her own hand written in Greek. In 1587 she presented eight volumes by Galen, five in Greek and three in Latin, to Christ Church, Oxford. She later gave two books to St John's College, Oxford, and two books to Westminster School. She provided an exhibition for two scholars and four quarterly sermons at St John's College, Cambridge, Lord Burghley's old college. Lady Burghley died on 4 April 1589 after 43 years of marriage. She was buried with her daughter, Anne Cecil, Countess of Oxford, in Westminster Abbey, where an enormous Corinthian tomb 24 feet high was erected. Lady Burghley is depicted lying on a sarcophagus. At her head are her three granddaughters, Elizabeth de Vere, Bridget de Vere, and Susan de Vere, and at her feet her only son, Robert Cecil. In a recess is the recumbent figure of her daughter Anne, Countess of Oxford. In the upper story Lord Burghley is depicted kneeling in his robes. A long Latin inscription composed by Lord Burghley describes his eyes dim with tears for those who were dear to him beyond the whole race of womankind. Lord Burghley lay in state here, but was buried at St Martin's Church, Stamford. After her death, Lord Burghley wrote a Meditation of the Death of His Lady, which is among the Lansdowne manuscripts at the British Library (C III 51), recounting, among other things, the charitable works which she had kept secret from him during her lifetime. There are two known portraits of Lady Burghley, both at Hatfield House; one shows her during a pregnancy, probably that of 1563. The artist has been called \\"the Master of Mildred Cooke\\", but both portraits have recently been attributed to Hans Eworth. Marriage and issue In December 1545 she married William Cecil as his second wife. Their first child, a daughter, Francisca, was born in 1554, nine years after their marriage, but did not long survive.Cecil Papers - December 1594, 26-31 - British History Online [retrieved 13 August 2014]. A second daughter, Anne, was born in 1556, and married, as his first wife, Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. Two sons, both named William,died shortly after their respective births in 1559 and 1561. In 1563 a third son was born, Robert, who succeeded his father at court and was created Earl of Salisbury by James I. Another daughter, Elizabeth, was born in 1564, who married William Wentworth, but both she and her husband died shortly afterward without issue.

It is one of the oldest mountain rescue associations in the world. Each potential rescuer is required to complete a special training course (lasting between 1.5 and 3 years), in which every volunteer is to exhibit excellent knowledge in Tatra topography as well as practical abilities including climbing, skiing, spelunking, lifesaving and first aid. After completing the training the rescuer takes an oath on the director's hand. In 2011 TOPR consisted of around 250 members, 140 of whom had acquired permission to participate in rescue missions. The majority of the rescuers are volunteers; only 33 are professional rescuers. TOPR is one of the few organizations in the world that does not require a mountain insurance policy and does not charge payment for the rescue.  History  The initial project launch of the mountain rescue association began in 1908. The death of a Polish composer Mieczys≈Çaw Kar≈Çowicz by avalanche hastened the creation of the organization, which was ultimately registered on 29 October 1909 in Lw√≥w, Poland. under its current name with Kazimierz D≈Çuski as the president and Mariusz Zaruski as the director. The TOPR headquarters, Dworzec Tatrza≈Ñski, are located in Zakopane. TOPR headquarters in Zakopane In 1910, during a rescue mission on the northern wall of the , one of the rescuers, Klemens Bachleda, died in a rockfall, despite the distinct order of the director commanding Klemens to abort the operation due to weather conditions. The heroic sacrifice was in vain as the mountaineer, Stanis≈Çaw Szulakiewicz, was dead by the time the team reached him. During the first few years TOPR consisted of only 11 rescuers. The number of volunteers increased until in 1939, 20 years after its launch, TOPR had 50 trained rescuers. In 1939, after the World War II outbreak, TOPR ceased to function and people of Zakopane scattered across the country. In 1940, during the German occupation of Poland, Germany was able to influence TOPR to resume its rescue services and TOPR operated as Freiwillige Tatra Bergwacht for the duration of the war. In 1952, the Tatra Volunteer Rescue Service was incorporated into the GOPR. TOPR first used a helicopter during a rescue mission in 1963. Tadeusz Augustyniak, an experienced rescue pilot and an honorary member of the organization, operated the SM-1. The vehicle transported a tourist with a broken leg from the Valley of the Five Lakes to a hospital in Zakopane. TOPR Rescuers operating SM-1 In 1974, the rescuers adopted Cygan, a dog with avalanche rescue license. Cygan was a German Shepherd. Land Rover Defender in Tatra mountains In 1991, TOPR became an independent organization and was withdrawn from GOPR. A year later, the President of Poland, Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, awarded the Tatra rescuers with a PZL W-3 Sok√≥≈Ç. The new vehicle had a more advanced hovering system than the MI-2 used prior, and thus made rescue missions in the higher, less accessible areas of the mountains safer. PZL W-3 Sok√≥≈Ç had an increased weight capacity as well, allowing the transport of more rescuers. Less than 3 years later, the aircraft crashed during a rescue operation. Two pilots (Bogus≈Çaw Arendarczyk and Janusz Rybicki) and 2 rescuers (Janusz Kubica and Stanis≈Çaw Mateja) were killed. In 1999 Tatra Search and Rescue was incorporated in International Commission for Alpine Rescue (IKAR). The most tragic disaster in the Tatra mountains occurred in January 2003. A group of high school students from Tychy heading towards Rysy mountain were caught in an avalanche, resulting in 8 fatalities. During the second day of the rescue mission, a critical error occurred in one of the helicopters, \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\", halting the functions of both of the engines. The pilot, Henryk Serda, was able to perform autorotation landing, causing major damage to the vehicle but avoiding harm to any terrestrial objects. Shortly after the incident the pilot was fired for breaking the aviation safety laws. Henryk re- appealed and was found innocent due to discrepancies in the officials' reports. A vehicle inspection, confirmed by the manufacturer, raised the possibility \\"Sok√≥≈Ç\\" may have not been maintained properly. This tragedy was adapted into a movie, \\"Cisza\\" (The Silence), premiered in 2010.

The project addresses concerns about patient safety around the world. The High 5s name derives from the Project's original intent to significantly reduce the frequency of 5 challenging patient safety problems in 5 countries over 5 years. Organization The countries that initiated the High 5s Project were Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. France, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore have subsequently joined the Project. All the countries set up Lead Technical Agencies for coordination of national project activities.Fact Sheet: High 5s Project Overview The project is supported by the U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, WHO, and the Commonwealth Fund and is coordinated by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Patient Safety which is led by The Joint Commission and Joint Commission International.Press Release Activities The major components of the High 5s Project include the development and implementation of problem-specific Standardized Operating Protocols (SOPs); creation of an Impact Evaluation Strategy; collection of data, reporting and analysis; and the establishment of an electronic collaborative learning community. The High 5s Project is designed to generate learning that will permit the continuous refinement and improvement of the SOPs, as well as assessment of the feasibility and success of implementing standardized approaches to specific patient safety problems across multiple countries and cultures. Achievement of the Project goals is expected to provide valuable lessons and new knowledge to support the advancement of patient safety around the world. Five SOPs have been developed to support the Project. These SOPs address: #Assuring Medication Accuracy at Transitions in CareSOP for Implementation: Assuring medication accuracy at transitions in care #Managing Concentrated Injectable MedicinesSOP for Implementation: Managing concentrated injectable medicines #Performance of Correct Procedure at Correct Body SiteSOP for Implementation: Performance of correct procedure at correct body site #Communication failures during patient handovers #Addressing health care-associated infection. The Impact Evaluation Strategy includes on-site observation of SOP implementation; the use of SOP-specific performance measures; use of an event analysis framework to identify occurrences that may represent SOP failures: and baseline and periodic hospital safety culture surveys.

Background  The Whites had no clear political aims in common, other than stopping the communist revolutionary Reds from taking power and returning to constitutional rule by the Senate (the government of the Grand Duchy of Finland) which was formed by the non-socialist parties of the Eduskunta (parliament) and returning to the Rule of Law. The provisional head of state of White Finland was Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, chairman of the senate at the time, and its military was commanded by Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. The refugee government was supported by the remnants of the Finnish Legion stationed along the eastern front. This emerged as the paramilitary White Guard, J√§ger troops, and were expanded with the addition of other recruitees and draftees, as well as the political right, separatist-minded from Russia. The J√§gers had left to Germany between 1914 and 1917 for military training and returned at eve of the civil war, many already as First World War veterans. They also received military support from the German Empire.  Campaign  The Whites' campaign was initially challenged by the goal of capturing the Varkaus industrial center. The 1,200 Red forces defending the city finally surrendered after the invading troops secured the surrounding areas. This battle was one of the turning points of the civil war since it gave the Whites control of the northern part of Finland. The success of the campaign is attributed to the White's better equipment, organization, and unity. By February 1917, Finland was already divided with the Whites controlling the area north of Pori, Tampere, Lahti, Lappeenranta, and Vipuuri while the urban areas to the south were under the Red zone. With the assistance of the Germans under General R√ºdiger von der Goltz, the Whites were able to capture Helsinki and Tampere until the Reds finally fled to Soviet Russia in April and the victors claimed the entire former Grand Duchy of Finland. The initial frontlines were established rather quickly, and over the course of the war, Whites conquered all of Finnish territory. The Finnish constitution of 1919 established the modern Republic of Finland, and the Treaty of Tartu between Finland and Russia (1920) confirmed the outcome. Thus, the Republic of Finland is the sole successor of White Finland.

Ren√©e, Lily Ren√©e, or Reney, is an American artist best known as one of the earliest women in the comic-book industry, beginning in the 1940s period known as the Golden Age of Comics. She escaped from Nazi-occupied Vienna to England and later New York, whereupon she found work as a penciller and inker at the comics publisher Fiction House, working on such features as \\"Jane Martin\\", \\"The Werewolf Hunter\\", \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"Senorita Rio\\".  Early life  Willheim was raised by well-to-do Jewish parents in Vienna, Austria, in the 1930s. Her father, Rudolf Willheim, worked as a manager at the Holland America line, a transatlantic steamship company. As a child, she frequented art museums and often drew as a hobby. In 1939 or 1938 at age 14, Willheim was boarded onto the Kindertransport, leaving her parents behind in Nazi-occupied Austria. She arrived in Leeds, England, and lived there for two years, working as a servant, nanny and candy striper while waiting for her parents' escape. When Willheim was 16, she received a letter from her parents saying they had emigrated to America. After joining them, living in a rooming house on West 72nd Street on Manhattan's Upper West Side, she took up art again.

She said in 2011 she had worked with the feature's writer to steer it from lycanthropy toward more general gothic horror, concerned that she could not properly draw wolves. Other work included the science-fiction feature \\"The Lost World\\", with scripts credited to \\"Thornecliffe Herrick\\", in Planet Comics #32-49 (Sept. 1944 - July 1947); and \\"Se√±iorita Rio\\", about a South-of-the- border adventuress doing wartime espionage for the U.S. government, with scripts credited to \\"Morgan Hawkins\\" and appearing in Fight Comics #34-44, 47-51 (Oct. 1944 - Aug. 1947).

The two also drew comic books for the dairy company Borden, starring mascot Elsie the Cow. After she left comics, Ren√©e said she \\"did some children's books and I also wrote some plays\\", with at least one, the black comedy Superman in Sleep's Embrace, produced at Hunter College in Manhattan. She designed textiles for Lanz of California, and jewelry for Willy Woo. In 2007, Ren√©e attended Comic-Con International in San Diego, where Friends of Lulu nominated her to its Hall of Fame.

History The east wing of the present building was originally built as Hoddesdon House for Marmaduke Rawdon. He was a prominent wine merchant, Master of the London Clothworkers Company, Member of Parliament and friend of King James I, who visited his house from time to time. Although fighting in the Civil War on the Royalist side, the Rawdon family were nevertheless able to hold on to the property throughout the Commonwealth, after which it passed by marriage in 1734 to Richard Plomer. It was subsequently let to a series of tenants, including John Dymoke, the King's Champion. In 1840 the house was bought by the Quaker John Warner, an educational reformer, who rented it to Sarah Stickney Ellis to establish the Rawdon House School for young ladies there, which moved away in 1865. The next owner, Henry Ricardo, commissioned architects Ernest George and Harold Peto to design a north wing to the house, at right angles to the original block, which was completed in 1879. In 1898 the house became St Monica's Priory, run by nuns of the Order of St Augustine. At this point 'the best C17 fittings were taken out' including 'fireplaces now at Rothamsted Manor'.Nikolaus Pevsner (revised Bridget Cherry), The Buildings of England.

Since its opening, it has held various sports at the venue ‚Äì including Cricket, Rugby League, Cycling and Football. The oval also has a velodrome in the grounds, between the field and the stands. The ground was opened in 1911. Since 2015 it has been one of the home grounds of JLT Cup team Cricket Australia XI. Sports used =Cycling= The St George Cycling Club, originally known as Hurstville Bicycle Club, started competition at the oval in 1906 on grass. They later built a cinders track prior to the amalgamation of several small clubs into St. George Cycling Club in 1920. The club benefited from the membership of Dunc Gray, the Olympic champion, who also established his home and business just a kilometre away from the track. St. George Cycling Club staged national titles at Hurstville in the 1950s and under the guidance of Charlie Manins as an administrator and legendary coach Joe Buckley, developed into a powerful and ultra-competitive club. Since 1956, the club has had representation in every cycling team that has represented at Olympic or Commonwealth Games (28 in succession) and continues to develop outstanding talent on an annual basis. On some occasions 40 per cent of the national team were St. George members. The names have been great legends of Australian cycling including Dunc Gray, Warren Scarfe, Frank Brazier, Ian Chapman, Max Langshaw, Dick Paris, Gary Sutton, Kevin Nichols, Martin Vinnicombe, Shane Sutton, Brett Dutton, Graeme Brown, Steve Wooldridge, Julie Speight, Kathleen Shannon, Clayton Stevenson, Ben Kersten, Ian Christison, Ben Brooks, Ashlee Ankudinoff, Steve Griffiths, Kaarle McCulloch ‚Äì all have stood on the podium at the Olympics, World Titles, or Commonwealth Games. =Rugby Union= The St. George Rugby Union Football Club used the Oval from 1928 until 1939, and then again from 1950 until 1988. The club produced 18 Wallabies in that period, starting with Dan Carroll being the first in 1908, two years after the club was formed. Prior to 1928, the club played at Brighton Le Sands, Arncliffe and also used Kogarah Oval. =Rugby League= During the NSWRL competition, the St George Dragons club used the ground as their home-ground matches, from 1921 until 1924, before moving to Earl Park in 1925. The club later returned to the ground in 1940, and remained there until 1949. The Dragons moved to Kogarah Oval in 1950, where they remained for many years. The Dragons' Jack Lindwall has two club records for the club ‚Äì scoring most points in a match and most tries in a match ‚Äì both records were held at Hurstville Oval (on 3 May 1947, against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. =Cricket= The St George Cricket Club, who currently play in the Sydney Grade Competition, use the Ground as their home ground, ever since 1921, when the club joined the competition. Famous Australian Cricketer, Don Bradman, played for the club from 1926 until 1933. He played numerous games at the ground. Hurstville Oval was one of the host venues of the 2013‚Äì14 Ryobi One-Day Cup, the major interstate one-day cricket competition in Australia. The first game at the ground saw New South Wales defeat Western Australia by 5 wickets on 13 October. The second and last game at Hurstville saw Tasmania defeat Queensland by 2 wickets on 15 October. Since 2015 it has been used as one of the home grounds of Cricket Australia XI in the JLT Cup. It is also used to host various other games in the competition taking place in New South Wales.

A deep‚Äìlying forward player, Lorton enjoyed two spells at Arsenal Ladies as well as playing in Iceland and Sweden. Club career Lorton emerged from the Wembley Ladies team managed by John Jones, at the same time as Kelly Smith. Alongside several other promising youngsters, Lorton and Smith won the FA Women's Premier League Cup with Wembley in 1995‚Äì96. The following season, Lorton moved to Millwall Lionesses and won both the 1996‚Äì97 Premier League Cup and FA Women's Cup, beating old team Wembley in the final of the latter competition. Louise Waller headed the winning goal from Lorton's corner, in front of 3,015 supporters at Upton Park. Lorton moved to Arsenal in 1998. In the 1999 FA Women's Cup final against Southampton Saints, Lorton created both goals in Arsenal's 2‚Äì0 win. From 1999 until 2001 Lorton enjoyed three short but productive spells in Icelandic football with Stjarnan, scoring eight goals in a total of 24 appearances. She also played for a Swedish club before returning to England. After joining Charlton Athletic, in March 2003 Lorton hit a late winner from the penalty spot to defeat Arsenal in the FA Women's Cup semi‚Äìfinal and take Charlton into their first final. This was despite \\"shaking like a leaf\\" due to nerves. However, Lorton was then on the losing side as The Addicks were soundly beaten by professional Fulham in the final. She finished as Charlton's top goalscorer in the competition with four goals. In 2003‚Äì04 Lorton was back with Arsenal and was a 90th-minute substitute as The Gunners recaptured the FA Women's Cup, beating Charlton 3‚Äì0 in the final at Loftus Road. On her second debut for Arsenal Lorton scored in a 9‚Äì2 win over Tranmere Rovers. Lorton also featured from the bench during Arsenal's run to the 2004‚Äì05 UEFA Women's Cup semi‚Äìfinal.

Currently these organizations are focused on bringing veterans of World War II to the National World War II Memorial, and any veteran with a terminal illness to see the memorial of the war they fought in. Organizers plan to \\"naturally transition\\" their programs to focus on veterans of the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and subsequent wars as the veterans of those wars get older. Honor flights arrive at all three of the Washington's area airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. The veterans are generally escorted by volunteer guardians, who help them on the flight and around DC After landing, the taxiing airplane may be saluted by fire trucks, and passengers are often met by cheering crowds in DC or upon their return flight home. Honor Flight Network The Honor Flight Network is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which works as an umbrella organization with local chapters and various subgroups. The Honor Flight Network reports that it has flown over 159,000 veterans to the Washington, DC, memorials since 2005. =History= The network was cofounded by Earl Morse, a physician assistant and retired Air Force captain, and Jeff Miller, a small business owner and son of a WWII veteran. Morse worked in a Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Springfield, Ohio, where he saw many patients who were World War II veterans. After the National World War II Memorial in Washington was completed in 2004, he asked many of his veteran patients if they were going to see it, and most said yes. \\"I would see my World War II veterans some three, six months later,\\" Morse said, \\"and I'd ask them if they'd gone to see it. Three hundred of them, and not one of them had been to it. Reality set in. They were never going.\\" Morse offered to fly with two veterans to Washington to see the memorial, and after seeing them break down and cry and graciously accept the offer, he pitched his idea to a local aeroclub of 300 private pilots at a local Air Force base, proposing that the pilots would pay for the flights for the veterans to Washington and personally escort them around the city. Eleven volunteered, and the network was formed; by 2005, a board was formed, funds were raised, and volunteers had joined. Ft. McHenry WWII Honor Flight, April 2016 The first honor flight took place in May 2005, when six small planes flew 12 veterans to Washington, DC. Due to high participation, the program began using commercial flights. At the end of 2005, the program had transported 137 veterans to the memorial. In late 2005, Jeff Miller, a dry cleaning company owner in Hendersonville, North Carolina, inspired by Morse's vision, had a similar idea but on a larger scale. Miller, the son of a World War II veteran and nephew of a B-24 bomber pilot who died in the war, had been a charter member of the National World War II Memorial Foundation. Like Morse, Miller lamented that many World War II veterans would be unable to visit the memorial. The seed that Morse had planted grew to a veritable forest of volunteerism, fundraising and goodwill toward the Greatest Generation veterans, who had been too busy building their communities to demand recognition for wartime service. On 23 and 24 September and 4 November 2006, HonorAir flew more than 300 World War II veterans from the Asheville Regional Airport to Washington, free of charge. HonorAir provided everything: a medical doctor and several EMTs, guardians who would attend to the needs of three to four veterans each, tour buses to take them the World War II Memorial and other national memorials, and a box lunch. Ticket agents and passengers lined the ropes as veterans emerged from the charter jets into the terminal. CBS Sunday Morning aired a moving feature about the HonorAir effort in September 2006. Bill Geist updated the story in 2007 because it was a story that was so important to him. The Springfield group and HonorAir soon merged to form the Honor Flight Network. As of 2014, the Honor Flight Network is still headquartered in Springfield, Ohio. Both Jeff Miller and Earl Morse were awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal in 2008 for their extensive work with the program. Alt URL In 2015 the first all-female honor flight was held, with 140 female veterans. On 21 May 2019, Honor Flight celebrated their 14th Anniversary of their first Honor Flight trip. They have transported 225,000 veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit their memorials.Honor Flight Network =Logistics= Flights arrive in any of Washington's three area airports: Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport, and Washington Dulles International Airport. Southwest Airlines is the official commercial airline of the Honor Flight Network, although the network utilizes many national airlines. The veterans on the honor flights are escorted by volunteer guardians, who help them on the flight and around D.C. An honor flight of 100 people, including veterans and volunteers, costs about $30,000. Costs are covered by donations with assistance from the airline. Honor Flight Network says that as of November 2010 it has transported 63,292 veterans of World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War to Washington. By 2012, the group had expanded to include 114 chapters; by 2014, the movement had grown to 133 chapters serving veterans in 41 states and the District of Columbia. =Heroes' Welcome= Heroes' Welcome is a sub-group of the Honor Flight Network which organizes welcoming ceremonies for the honor flights at the three Washington-area airports. Heroes' Welcome is a project of the American Legion Auxiliary Unit 180 in Vienna, Virginia. The ceremonies typically involve a group waiting inside or outside the gate where the flight arrives, clapping and cheering as they walk in. Active duty military members are often present, as are other volunteers such as school children. Triangle Flight of Honor Thousands turn out at a Triangle Flight of Honor return celebration at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport in April 2012 A similar but independent organization organized flights for veterans in the area of North Carolina known as \\"The Triangle\\". The Triangle Flight of Honor has organized eight flights, each serving over 100 veterans. The trips originated from Raleigh Durham International Airport and concluded with a \\"Heros Welcome\\" return with marching bands, local celebrities, and attended by thousands of family members, friends, and area residents. Honor Flight film The premiere of the 2012 documentary Honor Flight: One Last Mission at Miller Park in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, set a new Guinness World Record for the largest attendance at a film premiere: 28,442 people. The film, shown on a video board, depicts the lives of four World War II veterans who were part of the first Honor Flight from Milwaukee's Stars and Stripes Honor Flight Hub. Legislation On 9 June 2014, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) introduced the \\"Honor Flight Act\\" in Congress. This bill would direct the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to establish a process for providing expedited and dignified passenger screening services for veterans traveling on an Honor Flight to visit war memorials built and dedicated to honor their service. It became law on 16 December of the same year, after being passed in the House and the Senate without amendment.

He previously played for the San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, Washington Nationals, and New York Mets. Early life Strickland was born in Thomaston, Georgia. Career =Boston Red Sox= Strickland was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 18th round, 564th overall pick, of the 2007 Major League Baseball draft. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On July 22, 2009, he was acquired by the Pittsburgh Pirates along with Argenis D√≠az in a trade with the Red Sox in exchange for Adam LaRoche. In November 2012, the Pirates added Strickland to the 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft. =San Francisco Giants= On March 27, 2013, Strickland was designated for assignment by the Pirates, and on April 2, the San Francisco Giants claimed Strickland off waivers. Strickland underwent Tommy John surgery in May and was designated for assignment in July and re-signed to a minor league contract with the Giants. He was re-added to the Giants' 40-man roster on November 20, 2013. 2014 Strickland was called up to the majors for the first time on September 1, 2014. He pitched one scoreless inning of relief against the Colorado Rockies later that day. In the 2014 regular season, Strickland appeared in 9 games, allowing 5 hits and no runs in 7.0 innings pitched. In Game 1 of the 2014 National League Division Series versus the Washington Nationals, Strickland entered the game with the bases loaded and two outs in the sixth inning and struck out Ian Desmond to preserve the Giants' lead. In Game 2, Strickland recorded the save in the longest (by time, tied for longest in innings) playoff game in Major League history, as the Giants defeated the Nationals 2‚Äì1 in 18 innings. However, Strickland set a postseason record for a reliever by allowing six home runs, even though the Giants went on to defeat the Kansas City Royals in the 2014 World Series. 2015 Strickland started the 2015 season with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats, posting a 1.66 ERA in 21.2 innings, before being called up on May 24, 2015. Strickland did not yield a home run until August 3, a string of 188 batters between Triple-A and the majors. In 2015, Strickland appeared in 55 games, recording a 2.45 ERA with 50 strikeouts in 51.1 innings pitched. Strickland's 0.857 WHIP was the third-lowest among relievers with at least 50 innings pitched. 2016 In 2016, Strickland was named to the opening day Major League roster for the first time in his career. He remained in the Giants bullpen throughout the season, collecting an ERA in the low 3's. 2017 In a May 29, 2017, game against the Washington Nationals, Strickland hit Bryce Harper's right hip with a 98-mph fastball, which resulted in a benches-clearing brawl. Strickland had to be physically removed from the field by teammates after exchanging several punches with Harper. He received widespread criticism for his role in starting the brawl, as sports analysts and Harper have suggested that the intentional hit-by-pitch was the result of a grudge from the two home runs by Harper against him in the 2014 National League Division Series, a series the Giants ended up winning in 4 games en route to a World Series championship. The next day, on May 30, he was suspended for six games. 2018 With Mark Melancon heading to the disabled list at the beginning of the season, Strickland was named the Giants closer. He earned his first save in a 1-0 victory on Opening Day against the Los Angeles Dodgers.https://www.sfgate.com/giants/article/Giants-blank-Dodgers-on-Opening- Day-win-on-Panik-12792677.php While playing against the Miami Marlins on June 18, Strickland allowed three runs, blowing a save, and the Giants lost 5‚Äì4.

During the campaign, a blackmailer identified by the pseudonym \\"Sally\\" sent letters to Tesco stores threatening to harm customers if his demands‚Äîfor Clubcards, modified so that the holder could withdraw cash from ATMs‚Äîwere not met. Several months after the threat first came to light, \\"Sally\\" sent out several letter bombs, one of which was received and exploded in the face of the householder, causing her shock and minor injuries, while the Royal Mail intercepted several other packages, which had been held up because insufficient stamps had been put on them. In October 2000, \\"Sally\\" threatened to use pipe bombs against Tesco customers and the threat was taken seriously enough that Tesco began the production of the modified Clubcards, but were unable to produce the required number before the deadline set by the blackmailer. In November, \\"Sally\\" claimed to have placed a pipe bomb in a garden in the Ferndown area of Dorset. No bomb was found. Police eventually mounted a surveillance operation on the postbox to which several of the extortion letters had been traced and identified \\"Sally\\" as Robert Edward Dyer. Dyer was arrested in February 2001, over six months since the beginning of the extortion attempt, and charged with several offences, including nine counts of blackmail and one of common assault, of which he was found guilty in May 2001. He was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment on 12 June 2001, later reduced to 12 years on appeal. A number of similar extortion attempts against supermarket chains and other businesses and subsequent attacks on Tesco have since been compared to Dyer's campaign by the media. Beginnings The campaign began in August 2000, when John Purnell, director of security for Tesco, the United Kingdom's largest supermarket chain, was telephoned by a newsagent in Bournemouth who had discovered a copy of an extortion letter left on his shop's photocopier. The letter demanded that Tesco give away Clubcards, modified for use in cash machines, in the Bournemouth Daily Echo. Over the following days, Dorset Police received two other letters, threatening to send bombs to Tesco customers if the demands were not met. Investigation The police investigation into the campaign, codenamed Operation Hornbill, was one of the most secretive ever undertaken by Dorset Police and one of the largest in British policing history. After receiving the second letter, which had been damaged by fire, police made enquiries with the Royal Mail and discovered that a fire had been reported in a postbox on Bradpole Road, Bournemouth, leading to speculation that \\"Sally\\"‚Äîthe alias by which all the letters were signed‚Äîhad changed his mind and attempted to destroy the letter. They received a third letter on 29 August 2000, in which \\"Sally\\" claimed to have prepared letter bombs to send to Tesco's customers. After receiving the third letter, the police attempted to communicate with \\"Sally\\" by covertly taking out a classified advert in the Bournemouth Daily Echo to buy more time. After receiving no response in three weeks, the senior investigating officer, Detective Superintendent Phil James, convened a meeting with other senior officers from across the United Kingdom to assess the threat posed. Bombings A Tesco store in Bournemouth During James' meeting, he was informed that a letter bomb had exploded in a suburb of Bournemouth. In a documentary about the investigation in 2009, James said \\"There was a knock at the door and I was told by one of my officers that an incendiary device had just gone off. The atmosphere of the meeting changed. Clearly there was a risk and the threat was very real.\\" Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb, was taken to hospital with minor injuries, and a bomb disposal team from the British Army was dispatched to the scene. The device had used a party popper to detonate gunpowder inside the envelope. Immediately after the first letter bomb, Dorset Police alerted Royal Mail to look out for similar packages and several were found in a sorting office, having been delayed because insufficient stamps had been placed on them, and defused by the Army. A further seven of the packages were delivered to the homes of Tesco customers. Following the spate of letter bombs, the Army's bomb disposal team was stationed in Bournemouth‚Äîsomething that only usually happens when political party conferences are held in the town‚Äîand placed on stand-by. Another threatening letter was sent in October, threatening to attack Tesco customers with pipe bombs if the demands were not met. The letter contained a cipher which allowed the police to communicate with \\"Sally\\" in code through cryptic adverts in the Bournemouth Daily Echo. James contacted the editor of the Echo and the police were allowed to place the messages in the Echo, disguised as Mensa puzzles and made to look like word searches. By this time, the police had narrowed the focus of their investigation on a square-mile area of Bournemouth and James became convinced that they would find \\"Sally\\" through the postbox on Bradpole Road, through which the fire-damaged letter had passed in August. The box was placed under surveillance and, eventually, the October letter was traced back to that box. The footage from the surveillance operation was reviewed, but the image was of poor quality. In November 2000, \\"Sally\\" lost patience and sent a letter in which he said he would place a pipe bomb in the garden of a Tesco customer if his demands were not met, prompting the police to seriously consider producing the modified Clubcards. They discovered that they could not produce sufficient cards by 12 December, the deadline \\"Sally\\" had set. Approximately 100,000 Clubcards, modified for use in ATMs, were eventually produced, but none were distributed. At the end of November, \\"Sally\\" sent another letter, telling the police that he had planted a bomb in a garden in the Ferndown area, giving a grid reference which included over 500 houses. The claim prompted the mobilisation of hundreds of police officers to the area, but no bomb was found. Arrest The police received another letter from \\"Sally\\" on 7 December. Once again, the letter was traced back to the Bradpole road postbox, where the surveillance operation had continued. The operation had captured good-quality footage of all the users of the postbox that day, but, as it was close to Christmas, the postbox was busier than normal, with 172 items posted by 38 people. Royal Mail regulations meant that detectives could not open or delay the letters, so they made enquiries with the recipients to identify the senders. They eventually managed to identify all but a small number of the senders. On 17 February 2001, over six months after the receipt of the first demand and three months since the last letter from \\"Sally\\", the police made a major breakthrough. Detective Constable Alan Swanton, a junior detective on the case, spotted one of the people caught by the surveillance of the postbox who had yet to be identified. The man was carrying a fuel container, which Swanton believed had come from a nearby filling station. Officers obtained CCTV footage from the filling station, where their suspect had paid by cheque, and identified the man as Robert Edward Dyer. Dyer, who, at the time, was a 51-year-old widower and unsuccessful businessman living with his two teenage daughters, was placed under surveillance. The surveillance operation did not yield any results, so the police decided to confront Dyer and visited him at his home on 19 February, where they found an extortion note on his computer and cryptic notes in his handwriting. Dyer was arrested and interviewed. The police later intercepted the final letter from \\"Sally\\", which surveillance footage showed Dyer posting the day before he was arrested and which was an exact match to the letter found on Dyer's computer. Detective Superintendent James later revealed that Dyer \\"was an individual in desperate need of money and believing that Tesco was the answer to all his problems.\\" Conviction Dyer was charged and, in May 2001, pleaded guilty on nine counts of blackmail, as well as a sole count of common assault against Jean Evans, the woman who opened the letter bomb. On 12 June 2001, he was sentenced to 16 years' imprisonment by a judge at Dorchester Crown Court. The sentence was reduced to 12 years' imprisonment on appeal and Dyer was released from prison in 2007. During the trial, it emerged that Dyer had worn gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints on the letters and used water to stick the stamps rather than licking them, but that he had made errors, such as leaving a copy of an extortion demand on a newsagent's photocopier; however, there is speculation that this was done so his letter would reach Tesco by a person other than himself.Real Crime: The Tesco Bomber. Perf. Mark Austin. ITV, 2009. Although Dyer initially demanded only ¬£200,000, Tesco would have lost an estimated ¬£5 million had they complied with Dyer's demand to place cards in every copy of the Bournemouth Echo. Aftermath The investigation was one of the largest and most secretive that had ever been undertaken by Dorset Police. The campaign media to other similar extortion attempts against Tesco and other British businesses. Dyer got inspiration for the campaign from an article he read about Rodney Whitchelo, who attempted to extort ¬£4 million from H. J. Heinz Company by spiking jars of baby food. Witchelo was sentenced to 17 years' imprisonment in 1990. Dyer's campaign was also compared to that of Edgar Pearce, dubbed the \\"Mardi Gras bomber\\" by the media. Over three years, Pearce had used bombs in an attempt to extort money from Barclays Bank and Sainsbury's supermarkets. He was sentenced to 21 years' imprisonment in 1999. Later incidents have also been compared to Dyer's campaign, including another against Tesco in 2007. An episode of the crime documentary series Real Crime was made about the campaign in 2009 and broadcast by ITV. The documentary featured interviews with Neal Butterworth, then-editor of the Bournemouth Daily Echo and DSI James, the police officer who led the investigation.

Biography Although she would say that she was born in Tours, France, Marie Louise Anna Beaudet was baptised in the parish of Saint-Louis-de-Lotbini√®re, province of Qu√©bec, Canada, in December 1859. She was the ninth child of Marie-√âlisabeth (Eliza) Jobin dit Boisvert (1824-?) and farmer Cl√©ment Beaudet (1817-1863). The tragic loss of her father in 1863 and the subsequent move to Montr√©al deeply affected her childhood years. She was uprooted again in 1870 when her mother married Nathaniel B. Clapp and settled in Boston, Massachusetts. Eliza divorced her second husband six years later and moved to New York City with Louise and eldest daughter Marie Arceline (Amy). Louise performed in amateur productions of H.M.S. Pinafore before being \\"discovered\\" by actor Frank Drew of the famous Drew-Barrymore clan who offered her the role of Violet in his production of The Life of an Artist and the major role of Fanchon in Fanchon, The Cricket, in January and February 1879, at the Budlong's Opera House in Jersey City. In March of that year, she was hired by James C. Duff to play the duchess in The Little Duke at Booth's Theatre in New York and in the fall, Maurice Grau's French Opera Company gave her the same role of Blanche, la duchesse de Parthenay, in the American version of Le Petit Duc. The French actress Maire- Aim√©e Tronchon, known as Mlle Aim√©e, who starred in this production, took Louise under her wing. \\"Anything that I have ever done in comic opera I owe to Aim√©e\\", she would later confide to Alan Dale.[3] Shortly after, she joined the Baldwin Theatre Stock Company of San Francisco where she played the ing√©nue roles. It was there that she met one of the greatest dramatic actors of that period the actor Daniel E. Bandmann who encouraged her to take on more serious roles and with whom she became romantically involved. They founded a theatrical touring company, Beaudet playing all of Shakespeare‚Äôs principal female roles to Bandmann's leading men. They toured the world together for nearly four years, covering more than 70,000 miles. [10] They continued touring successfully in North America and England with such productions as A Strange Case, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Narcisse, East Lynn, The Corsican Brothers, etc. before ending their famous relationship in 1889. In August of that year, \\"Little Miss Beaudet\\" returned to the New York stage as a member of the James C. Duff Opera Company and rapidly became one of the \\"petites\\" favourites playing such roles as: Chilina in the comic opera Paola, or the First of the Vendettas, Maid Marian in Robin Hood and his Merry Men or Babes in the Woods, Pitti-Sing in The Mikado, Edith in Pirates of Penzance, Iolanthe in Iolanthe, Lady Angela in Patience, Christel in The Tyrolean and \\"la Jolie Plaignante\\" in Trial by Jury. In March 1891, Rudolph Aronson asked her to join his Casino Theatre Company for the theatrical season. Louise Beaudet played Paresina in the opera Apollo; or the Oracle of Delphi with Lillian Russell, Toffana in the adaptation of the burlesque opera Indigo, then again Christel in The Tyrolean, co-starring Marie Tempest and also Frinke in The Jolly Students. In 1892, she accepted the principal female role of Elizabeth in Pauline Hall's production of the comic opera in two acts Puritania, or the Earl and the Maid of Salem. In 1893, Beaudet starred in the eight-month run of Imre Kiralfy's America during the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, then began her own touring opera company, performing repertoire of French Op√©ra bouffe. They presented Jacinta, the Maid of Manzanillo at the Castle Square Theatre in Boston and at Miner's Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York with Louise in the leading role and The Dragoon's Daughter in Boston and Chicago before breaking-up the company due to the lack of funds. In 1895, she was hired by the great George Edwardes to replace Marie Tempest in the production of An Artist's Model at Daly's Theatre in London, England. The role of Adele gave her the chance to display her lovely mezzo-soprano voice in popular songs such as : Love is a Man's Delight, a Fancy of Today; On a Silent Summer's Night, When the Moon Shone Clear and Bright. She then toured quite successfully throughout England with Mr. Edwardes's theatrical company. Poster for Mademoiselle Fifi starring Louise Beaudet (1899) Between 1896 and 1899, Louise Beaudet was at the height of her popularity as a music-hall and vaudeville queen. She became one of the best paid stage performers. In June 1897, she was invited at Buckingham Palace for a Royal Command Performance before Queen Victoria .[11] She was adored by English, South African and American audiences alike and continually made headlines. Her power of fascination, her talent, her panache, her fabulous French gowns and bon go√ªt filled theatre halls. They wrote her songs, put her photographs on cigarette cards and associated her name with different brands of products. The famous Flo Ziegfeld asked her to star in his lavish 1899 production of Mademoiselle Fifi at the Manhattan Theatre. The play became the talk of the town. All New York showed up to see her enter the stage in her striking costume covered with more than 60 hand-sewn jewels. This \\"belle\\" of the Belle √âpoque continued playing first roles on stage until her voice could no longer support them. In 1912, she joined the Edison Studios in the Bronx and then the Company Players at Vitagraph Studios in Manhattan. She wrote a few scenarios and played supporting roles in sixty-six black and white silent films, including Heartbroken Shep (1913) with Helen Costello, Sawdust and Salome (1914) with Van Dyke Brooke, My Official Wife (1914) with Clara Kimball Young, The Battle Cry of Peace/A Call to Arms Against War (1915) where she was acclaimed for bringing educational acting to the screen [12], A Price for Folly (1915) with Edith Storey, Her Lord and Master (1921) with Alice Joy and The Gold Diggers (1923) with Hope Hampton. Her last appearance on screen was in 1926 at the age of 67. But Louise Beaudet continued to perform on Broadway and in theatres in Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Boston and Chicago until her retirement in 1934. She died on December 31, 1947, in City Hospital, Manhattan, aged 88. She is buried with her sister Arcelina Martel at Calvary Cemetery, in Woodside, New York. The fact that she always refused to divulge her true age explains why the dates on her death certificate and on her tombstone are erroneous. She left no descendants.

In 2006, while publicising his memoir (Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles), recording engineer Geoff Emerick stated that \\"God only knows\\" how the effect worked.  Technique  STEED was developed at EMI/Abbey Road Studios, where much of The Beatles' material was produced The technique was developed at EMI/Abbey Road Studios in the late 1950s, by EMI engineer Gwynne Stock.Kehew & Ryan, Recording The Beatles,p. 286 It involved delaying the recorded (dry) signal, sending it into the studio's echo chamber using a tape machine. The dry signal (without delay) was also sent to the chamber via the tape machine's replay head. The resulting sound was picked up by two condenser microphones. These microphones then fed the wet signal back to the recording console. The amount of feedback could be controlled allowing multiple delays to be sent to the reverb chamber, which could lengthen the effect's decay time. An identical technique was used for the production of Anthology 1 in 1995, where speakers were used to play the sound within the echo chamber.  Use  One notable example of the use of STEED is on George Harrison's lead vocal on \\"Everybody's Trying to Be My Baby\\" (1964). Mark Lewisohn describes the effect as a \\"vast amount\\", and likened Harrison's vocal to singing inside a tin can. He notes that some of the musical backing tracks were also affected by the technique due to microphone spill from Harrison's headphones. Other examples of the use of STEED on Beatles recordings include the vocal fermata in \\"Paperback Writer\\" (1966), and Paul McCartney's piano on \\"Birthday\\" (1968). The effect was also used on \\"Revolution 9\\" (1968), and was used in the mixing of tracks for Anthology 1 in 1995.

Saint Ambrose influenced the anti-paganism policy of several late Roman emperors including Gratian, Valentinian II and Theodosius I. Under the influence of Saint Ambrose, Theodosius issued, in the year 391, the \\"Theodosian decrees,\\" a declaration of war on paganism, and the Altar of Victory was removed by Gratian. Ambrose prevailed upon Gratian, Valentinian and Theodosius to reject requests to restore the Altar. Altar of Victory removal Ambrose was equally zealous in combating the attempt made by the upholders of the old state religion to resist the enactments of Christian emperors. The pagan party was led by Quintus Aurelius Symmachus, consul in 391, who presented to Valentinian II a forcible but unsuccessful petition praying for the restoration of the Altar of Victory to its ancient station in the hall of the Roman Senate, the proper support of seven Vestal Virgins, and the regular observance of the other pagan ceremonies. To this petition Ambrose replied in a letter to Valentinian, arguing that the devoted worshipers of idols had often been forsaken by their deities; that the native valour of the Roman soldiers had gained their victories, and not the pretended influence of pagan priests; that these idolatrous worshipers requested for themselves what they refused to Christians; that voluntary was more honourable than constrained virginity; that as the Christian ministers declined to receive temporal emoluments, they should also be denied to pagan priests; that it was absurd to suppose that God would inflict a famine upon the empire for neglecting to support a religious system contrary to His will as revealed in the Holy Scriptures; that the whole process of nature encouraged innovations, and that all nations had permitted them even in religion; that heathen sacrifices were offensive to Christians; and that it was the duty of a Christian prince to suppress pagan ceremonies. In the epistles of Symmachus and of Ambrose both the petition and the reply are preserved. Influence on Theodosius I Theodosius I, penitent after having been excommunicated by Ambrose for the Massacre of Thessaloniki, was much under Ambrose's influence.. Ambrose told Theodosius to imitate David in his repentance as he had imitated him in guilt ‚Äî Ambrose readmitted the emperor to the Eucharist only after several months of penance. This incident shows the strong position of a bishop in the Western part of the empire, even when facing a strong emperor ‚Äî the controversy of John Chrysostom with a much weaker emperor a few years later in Constantinople led to a crushing defeat of the bishop. Ambrose's influence upon Theodosius is credited with eliciting the enactment of the \\"Theodosian decrees\\" of 391 which were the most systematic attack on paganism to that date.

First as a secretary-jurist, and then as a senior executive and Vice-President of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), Pictet was instrumental in drafting the 1949 Geneva Conventions for the protection of victims of war, their Commentaries, and negotiating the 1977 Additional Protocols (Protocol I and Protocol II). He also proposed the Red Cross Movement‚Äôs seven Fundamental Principles, which were adopted at Vienna in 1965: Humanity, Impartiality, Neutrality, Independence, Voluntary Service, Unity and Universality. In 1989, an international humanitarian law competition for students was founded and named after him. Life After secondary education in Paris, Pictet completed his study of law at the University of Geneva, earning a doctorate in 1935 and then practiced law in Vienna and Geneva. In 1937, he began working as a legal assistant at the International Committee of the Red Cross. During the Second World War he wrote most of the ICRC's appeals on behalf of prisoners of wars and civilian victims of the war. and was one of the key staff of the Committee and worked directly with ICRC President Max Huber. Even before the war ended, he embarked on a project for a complete overhaul of the Geneva Conventions, in particular including the protection of civilians, despite Huber's pessimism about its prospects. 1946 he became Director in the Directorate and the ICRC. In 1966 he became Director General of the ICRC Directorate and thus held the highest office in the administration of the committee. From 1967 to 1979 he was a member of the ICRC (restricted to 25 Swiss citizens) and from 1971 to 1979 was the Vice President. Pictet was responsible for directing the establishment of the general report on the work of the ICRC during the global conflict. He ran for the ICRC, the work and negotiations that led to the revision of the Regulations of the Red Cross International in 1952, and agreements with the League of Red Cross. He also chaired the conference of experts to prepare for the negotiation of the two Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1977. He was the general editor of the four volume commentary on the Conventions. His short 1955 volume Les Principes de la Croix-Rouge (Red Cross Principles) was a decisive step in formulating common principles of the different organizations of the Red Cross Movement, and led to the unanimous adoption by the 1965 XXth International Conference of the Red Cross in Vienna, of the seven Fundamental Principles of the Red Cross. He was also involved in drafting the statutes of the Movement. Jean Pictet hall at the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum Pictet was appointed lecturer at the University of Geneva and Professor of International Humanitarian Law at the Faculty of Law and Associate Professor 1974 to 1979. He also lectured at the Academy of International Law (1950) and the International Institute of Human Rights (1971, 1972, 1982). From 1975 to 1981 he was director and president of the Henry Dunant Institute, research center, training and teaching of the International Red Cross. Pictet was the main author of the commentary on the four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and in 1977 completed two additional protocols. He also published the 1948 \\"Report of the International Committee of the Red Cross on its activities during the Second World War (1 September 1939-30 June 1947)\\" and later presented with the basis for publications in 1965 adopted seven principles of the International Red Cross - and Rothalbmond movement. Among his other works include several works on international humanitarian law and about the Native Americans. Honours Pictet received honorary doctorates from the Universities of Leiden, Zurich, and Leuven, as well as several awards from the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, including posthumously in 2005 the Henry Dunant Medal, the highest award of the movement. The bilingual, international Jean-Pictet Competition, which focuses on international humanitarian law, was named after him. =Works= (Translation of Le droit humanitaire et la protection des victimes de la guerre.)

The initial park land was established in 1962, with an additional section added in 2001. Holmdel Park is also the home of the Holmdel Arboretum; aka David C. Shaw Arboretum and the Longstreet Farm, a living history farm set in the 1890s. The park is a popular destination for local elementary school trips and cross-country runners. In August 2017 it was announced that a further was being donated. In 2018, it obtained an additional 52 acres of land. Activities and facilities The park's recreational offerings include fishing (with permit), individual and group picnic areas, tennis courts, playgrounds and 10 miles of hiking trails. Ice skating and sledding are permitted when conditions are deemed safe. The park contains four distinct visitor areas, each with its own parking; three are accessed via the main park entrance while the fourth is located at the activity center further north on Longstreet Road. The Pond View area provides access to the arboretum, Longstreet Farm, Upper and Lower ponds and the shelter building; the shelter building also houses a seasonal concession. The Forest Ridge area provides access to group picnic areas, trails and activity fields; the Forest Ridge parking lot also acts as an overflow lot for the Pond View area. The Hill Top area as the name implies is located at the top of a fairly steep hill; this area provides parking for the parks tennis courts as well as access to additional trails. The Activity Center provides indoor facilities for scheduled county sponsored activities. Historic Longstreet Farm The Longstreet Farm is a living history farm that recreates agricultural life of the 1890s. Interpreters dress in period costume and perform typical year round farming and domestic actives including seasonal planting and harvesting of crops and raising livestock. The farm is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The farm was purchased by the Monmouth County Park System in 1967 to preserve the county's rural past. The farm opened to the public in 1972 as Historic Longstreet Farm. Longstreet Farm is a fairly complete example of a typical nineteenth-century farm created by Dutch settlers in New Jersey. The farmstead consists of a 14-room Federal-style farmhouse, a Dutch barn, and a collection of nineteenth-century farm outbuildings. Historic Longstreet Farm is open daily year round, free of charge. David C. Shaw Arboretum The David C. Shaw Arboretum is a horticultural display created by the Monmouth County Shade Tree Commission. The arboretum was created in 1963 and is named for a former superintendent. The arboretum initially started with 87 trees but now boasts nearly 3000 specimens.

Previously part of the Dundee Biocentre and receiving significant Wellcome Trust funding from 1995 onwards, it was awarded Wellcome Trust Centre status in 2008. Professor Tom Owen-Hughes is the Centre‚Äôs Director. The Centre aims to enhance our understanding of how genes are regulated at both the single cell and whole organism level. Researchers use a wide range of advanced techniques, including live cell fluorescent imaging and mass spectrometry-based proteomics, to explore the functions of key proteins and molecular mechanisms in cell biology. Research and discoveries Live cell imaging and proteomic studies have allowed researchers at the Centre to gain fresh understanding of protein function and cell behaviour. The Centre is studying many aspects of the cell cycle, including the way in which chromosomes replicate and separate during cell division and how DNA damage is detected. Failure of these events can lead to major faults within a genome, potentially leading to the rise of cancerous cells. The Centre is also investigating how DNA is tightly wound and compacted so that it can fit into the nuclei of eukaryotic cells, as well as the protein-DNA complexes that are involved in this packaging. The controlled unravelling of DNA is an important step in the regulation of gene function. Researchers Angus Lamond, a Wellcome Principal Research Fellow, studies the composition and function of organelles and multiprotein complexes found within the nucleus. This work is helping to explain how a cell‚Äôs nucleus is organised, an area that has particular importance to human diseases such as inherited genetic conditions which can have modified or disrupted organelles. Jason Swedlow is a Wellcome Trust Senior Research Fellow and investigates how chromosomes are separated during cell division. The driving force behind this process are strands known as microtubules, which pull the chromosomes apart. His work looks at specialised structures known as kinetochores and the mechanisms which monitor the correct attachment of microtubules to the chromosomes. Tomo Tanaka studies the processes by which eukaryotic cells maintain their genetic integrity. His group use budding yeast to study chromosome duplication and segregation. By understanding the processes that occur during cell division, it is hoped that a better knowledge will be gained of human diseases such as cancer which are often characterised by chromosome instability.

In the 1960s, it was taken up as an alternative to the then young QCD theory by several theorists, including Abdus Salam, who showed that the particle level gravity approach can produce confinement and asymptotic freedom while not requiring a force behavior differing from an inverse-square law, as does QCD. Sivaram published a review of this bimetric theory approach. Although this approach has not so far led to a recognizably successful unification of strong and other forces, the modern approach of string theory is characterized by a close association between gauge forces and spacetime geometry. In some cases, string theory recognizes important duality between gravity-like and QCD-like theories, most notably the AdS/QCD correspondence. The concept of strong gravity follows from applying the potential gravitational energy to the term of heat in the equation of the first law of thermodynamics (E = Q + W), where the total energy is mass-energy and the work is also the kinetic energy: mc^2 = kT + KE, becomes mc^2 = Gm_s*m/r + KE  References  Gravity Particle physics ","title":"Strong gravity"},{"id":"31478659","text":"Online presence management is the process of presenting and drawing traffic to a personal or professional brand online. This process combines web design and development, blogging, search engine optimization, pay per click marketing, reputation management, directory listings, social media, link sharing, and other avenues to create a long-term positive presence for a person, organization, or product in search engines and on the web in general. Online presence management is distinct from web presence management in that the former is generally a marketing and messaging discipline while the latter is Governance, risk management, and compliance (GRC) discipline. Theory of Online Presence Management Due to the evolving nature of Internet use, a web site alone is not sufficient to promote most brands. To maintain a web presence and brand recognition, individuals and companies need to use a combination of social tools such as Google Maps, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Flickr, YouTube, and Pinterest, as well as cultivating a brand presence on mobile apps and other online databases. The online presence management process starts by determining goals that will define an online strategy. Once this strategy is put in place, an ongoing and constant process of evaluating and fine-tuning is necessary to drive online presence towards the identified goals. An online presence management strategy has several parts. Generally these will include search engine placement (making sure the brand appears high in search engine results when the end user has a relevant query), monitoring online discussion around the brand, and analyzing the brand's overall web presence. Elements of Online Presence Management Online profile or reputation is a sum of multiple activities and platforms. It includes following: =Web Portfolio Management= Online portfolio helps build visibility of a brand or individual. It works as a centralized hub for all the activities related to the brand and includes, contact info, about the brand (history, vision etc.) and a product showcase. The Web portfolio ranges in type. The most common form of portfolio is the website. A website, usually built on the same domain as the brand's name, represents the business/person throughout the web. However, there are niche-based portfolio websites too that help brands reach out to a more targeted audience through purpose built features and spot on galleries to brag about their work and achievement. =Blog= A blog provides the brand a way to express. It allows the brand to talk and get their voice/opinion heard on any topic they choose. Blogging can promote a brand through consistent, interesting content generation associated with a particular brand or the market brand caters to. Blogs can be created on the website or on third party platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Quora, Wordpress, Blogger.com and Medium, etc. Apart from conventional blogging, social media enabled Microblogging (through services such as Twitter and Tumblr) is particularly effective in establishing a brand name and build recognition through interaction with masses. It is also a quick way to respond to brand-related complaints and queries. =Search Engine Optimization (SEO)= Search Engine Optimization is one of the most popular technique to build traction and turn a web page into a revenue generation machine. Search Engine Optimization or SEO allows companies or individuals to: # Identify keywords that are likely to bring potential customers or audience to their website # Embed those keywords into the web content, naturally and in a value added way # Allow search engines to crawl the web page and index all the content Search engines use a spider or a crawler to gather listings by automatically \\"crawling\\" the web. The spider follows links to web pages, makes copies of the pages, and stores them in the search engine's index. Based on this data, the search engines then index the pages and rank the websites accordingly. Major search engines that index pages using spiders are Google, Yahoo, Bing, AOL, and Lycos. Some methods that help optimize a web page for the search engine include: * Link Building i.e. creating relevant and natural links for the website. * Creating great, keyword-optimized, content. =Internet Advertising= Internet advertising is a form of broadcasting and promotion of products, ideas, or services using the Internet to attract customers. Internet advertising has overtaken other traditional advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, and radio. Internet advertising targets users interested in relevant keywords and displays a text or image ad next to search results or within social media. =Reputation Management= Reputation management is the process of tracking actions and opinions, looking for positive and negative reviews that reflect the opinion of the users about any particular service or product, and removing negative opinions (if any) and converting them into positive ones. It is important, however, not to attack or try to obscure negative opinions through devious means, as this is likely to have an overall negative effect on the brand. A better strategy is to respond to complaints with information and an apologetic attitude, cultivating later positive reviews. =Social Media Marketing= Social media marketing uses social media platforms to create and foster communities and relationships. Social media marketing is focused on creating content that attracts attention and encourages readers to share content with their social networks. Social messages are often effective because they usually come from a trusted, third- party source, rather than the brand itself. Understanding what tools are available and how to use them effectively is key to success in social media marketing. Some of these tools include: # Social media content management # Social media publishing and scheduling # Social media monitoring # Social aggregation # Social bookmarking and tagging # Social analytics and reporting # Automation # Validation =Social Media Management= Many of the tools listed above are often found in a social media management system. This is a collection of procedures used to manage workflow in a disparate social media environment. These procedures can be manual or computer-based and enable the manager (or managing team) to listen, aggregate, publish, and manage multiple social media channels from one tool. The common features of a social media management system include access control, content libraries, publishing and scheduling, workflow, aggregation, mention listening, sentiment, analytic and archival functionality. Jeremiah Owyang is often attributed with defining this term while he was working at Altimeter Group, now part of Prophet.

Military career  He was born in Mykonos in 1901, and graduated from the Hellenic Naval Academy in 1921. Due to his participation in the Venizelist coup d'√©tat attempt in March 1935, he was dismissed from the service, but was recalled on the outbreak of the Greco-Italian War in October 1940. He served as commander of the Karaburun Naval Fort until the German invasion of Greece in April 1941. Fleeing to the Middle East, he continued to serve in the exiled Greek Armed forces, assuming command of the destroyer in 1941‚Äì1942. On 20 July 1942, he assumed command of the Adrias, a Hunt-class destroyer, at Newcastle, United Kingdom. With her, he undertook convoy escort duties in the Mediterranean Sea from January 1943, during which the ship sunk two German U-boats. Adrias also covered the Sicily landings in July, and on 10 September she represented Greece in the Allied flotilla that accepted the surrender of the Italian Navy's battle-fleet. Toumbas' finest hour came on 22 October 1943, during the naval operations of the Dodecanese Campaign, when Adrias struck a sea mine and lost her entire bow. After makeshift repairs, Toumbas led the ship back to Egypt, arriving at Alexandria on 6 December. In April 1944, he took part in the violent suppression of the pro-leftist Navy mutiny, leading one of the boarding detachments. Following the liberation of Greece in October 1944, he served as chief of staff of the Fleet and CO of the Destroyer Squadron, until he assumed command of the Salamis Naval Base in 1945. In 1946 he was appointed as chief of the Coastal Forces Command, and in 1947 he was sent to Washington, DC as a naval attach√©. Promoted to Rear Admiral in 1950, he assumed the post of chief of the Aegean Naval Command, and served as Chief of the Fleet Command in 1952‚Äì1953. He resigned in 1953, retiring as a Vice Admiral.  Political career  Toumbas became involved in politics in 1955, initially with the Liberal Democratic Union of Sofoklis Venizelos, and subsequently with the Liberal Party and the Centre Union of Georgios Papandreou, whose close associate he became. He was elected a member of the Greek Parliament in all elections from 1956 to 1964 (in 1956 with the LDU). He was named Minister without Portfolio in Papandreou's first cabinet in winter 1963, and Minister for the Interior in his second cabinet, from February 1964 to January 1965, when he resigned. An honest, but politically rather naive and deeply conservative man, he joined all three palace-appointed cabinets during the \\"Apostasy\\" crisis of 1965‚Äì1966. He served as Interior and Public Order Minister under Georgios Athanasiadis-Novas, Minister for Public Works in the Ilias Tsirimokos cabinet, a post he initially kept in the Stefanos Stefanopoulos government, before moving to the ministries of Industry and Northern Greece, finally becoming Foreign Minister in 1966. He was politically inactive during the Greek military junta of 1967‚Äì1974, and after its fall he joined the right-wing New Democracy party, with which he was elected on the nationwide list in the 1974 elections. In 1979 he became a member of the Academy of Athens, and served as its president in 1991. He died in Athens on 7 May 1995.  Writings  * ŒïœáŒ∏œÅœåœÇ ŒµŒΩ œåœàŒµŒπ [Enemy in Sight], Athens 1954.

After completing that mission, shortly before reaching Cadiz the squadron was surprised by a sudden storm and made for Saint Vincent, meeting a British squadron on 14 February 1797 in the Battle of Cape St Vincent, with Pr√≠ncipe de Asturias having 10 killed and 19 wounded. At Trafalgar she flew the flag of general Federico Gravina, who died a year later from wounds he gained during the battle, with Rafael Hore as his flag captain. The ship suffered 50 killed and 110 wounded and after the battle she had to be towed by the French frigate Th√©mis and then undergo major repairs in C√°diz. She then fought in the Peninsular War, capturing the French ships Heros, Neptune, Algesiras, Vainqueur, Plut√≥n and the frigate Cornelie. In September 1810 she and the Santa Ana crossed the Atlantic to Havana to avoid capture by the French. She struck a rock in 1814 and was scrapped in 1817.

The Academy‚Äôs focus is on skill development. It is open to all regardless of place of origin. The Academy currently has seven coaches who are all former international football players with coaching certificates. Objectives Students at play The Kwara Football Association was a private initiative that was brought to life with the support of the state government. It was established as a center for youth development, using football as the medium of empowerment. The Academy provides a conducive and unique surrounding to keep youths away from drugs, violence and other unhealthy activities. With 81 students currently, KFA is aimed at training footballers between the ages of 13 and 21 years to compete favourably with their counterparts at international levels. It is also focused on developing the skills of the footballers such that after graduation, they can pursue careers as professional footballers with international football clubs. Kwara Football Academy is the first of its kind in Nigeria: it provides opportunities for potential footballers to receive a first class education whilst honing their football skills. The football academy sets the stage for Kwara State to become the ultimate center for the future development of football in Nigeria. Overview KFA offers talented youths the opportunity to acquire a formal education for free while training as professional footballers. The Academy offers a full on campus boarding experience to ensure student concentration and full engagement while in school. The curriculum is modelled after the Nigerian educational system and some aspects of the British curriculum, allowing the students to be able to write exams such as the West African School Certificate Examinations, (WASC), National Examination Certificate (NECO), International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE), Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and the International Baccalaureate (IB). As part of the academic training, students are exposed to languages, including English and other Modern European Languages, General and Applied Mathematics, Humanities and Social Sciences, Creative, Technical and Vocational studies and Natural Sciences as areas of study. The students are grouped into three categories; The junior cadre comprise student between ages 13‚Äì14, the intermediate cadre comprise students between ages 15‚Äì16 while the elite cadre comprise student between ages 17‚Äì19. While the Junior and Intermediate group combine academics with football, the elite group combines football with management courses. The Facility Cross section of administrative buildings at KFA The academy is situated on about 35 hectares of land within the Kwara State Stadium Complex in Ilorin. The existing facilities have the capacity to accommodate 200 students. Some of the existing structures include: four standard football pitches well grassed with submersible sprinklers, one tennis court, one basketball court, one gymnasium, three blocks of students hostels (27 rooms each) and a medical center. Achievements Players of KFA have participated in try-outs with several international clubs. In 2009, two of the players were invited for trials with Chelsea Football Club England and two also for trials at Portsmouth Football Club in England. Some products of the Academy are currently playing in different clubs within and outside Nigeria. Some of these include Ahmed Abdul- Taofik who is playing for FK Ventspils of Latvia Premier league, four players at the Kwara United and four players for Bukola Babes Football Club. In 2009, three of the students from KFA were in the Nigerian U-17 team, which won silver at that year‚Äôs U-17 World Cup.

Turkey is a large country with many geographic and climatic regions and a great diversity of plants and animals, each suited to its own particular habitat. About 1500 species of vertebrates have been recorded in the country and around 19,000 species of invertebrate. There are about 11,000 species of flowering plants; some of the world's staple crops were first cultivated in this area, and many of their wild relatives are still found here. The country acts as a cross roads with links to Europe, Asia and the Near East, and many birds use the country as a staging post during migration. Ecoregions Topographic map of Turkey with the Aegean Sea to the west, the Black Sea to the north and the Mediterranean to the south The geography of Turkey is roughly rectangular, being more than east-west and north-south. Turkey's of land is divided into two parts by the Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara and the Dardanelles; European Turkey makes up only 3% of the country, with the rest being in Asia and often known as Anatolia. The country has varied topography with fertile coastal plains contrasting with mountainous regions in the centre and eastern part of the country. The climate of Turkey also varies, with the weather systems found near the coasts contrasting with those prevailing in the interior. The Aegean and Mediterranean coasts have hot, fairly dry summers and cool, rainy winters. The interior of the country has a continental climate with severe weather on the Anatolian plateau in winter, and hot, dry summers. These large differences in climate are reflected in an extremely diverse flora and fauna. The ecoregions of Turkey include the important terrestrial Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests and Southern Anatolian montane conifer and deciduous forests. Turkey includes portions of three biodiversity hotspots: the Mediterranean Basin, the Caucasus, and the Irano-Anatolian. Flora In the whole of Turkey there are about 11,000 species of flowering plant, about a third of which are endemic to the country. This area played a key role in the early cultivation of wheat, other cereals and various horticultural crops. The country is divided into three main floristic areas; the Mediterranean area; the Euro-Siberian area; and the Irano-Tranian area. The flora of the European part of Turkey is similar to that of adjoining Greece. The ecoregions here include Balkan mixed forests dominated by oaks and containing Scots pine, Bosnian pine, Macedonian pine, silver fir and Norway spruce, and Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests where some of the main species are oaks, strawberry tree, Greek strawberry tree, Spanish broom and laurel. The Euro-Siberian area is a mountainous part of western Turkey. Here the flora transitions from the Mediterranean vegetation type to the Anatolian plateau. The dominant vegetation cover here is forests of oak and pine, especially Anatolian black pine and Turkish pine. Further east is the Anatolian plateau, a largely treeless area of plains and river basins at an average altitude of . This area is characterised by hot dry summers and cold winters. Salt steppes and lakes are found here, as well salt-free grassland areas, marshes and freshwater systems. Immediately around the large Lake Tuz and other saline areas, saltmarsh plants grow, and beyond this is a sharp divide, with the flora being dominated by members of the families Chenopodiaceae and Plumbaginaceae. The mountainous eastern half of the country is separated floristically from the rest of the country by the Anatolian diagonal, a floral break that crosses the country from the eastern end of the Black Sea to the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea. Many species found to the east of this break are not found to the west and vice versa, and about four hundred species are only found along this divide. The natural vegetation in eastern Turkey is the Eastern Anatolian deciduous forests; in these oaks such as Brant's oak, Lebanon oak, Aleppo oak and Mount Thabor's oak predominate in open woodland with Scots pine, burnet rose, dog-rose, oriental plane, alder, sweet chestnut, maple, Caucasian honeysuckle (Lonicera caucasica) and common juniper. Fauna Human-made nests for Northern bald ibises in Birecik Loggerhead sea turtle nesting places by the Mediterranean Sea Turkey has a large range of habitat types and a great faunal diversity. Nearly 1,500 vertebrate species were recorded, of which over 100 species, mostly fish, are endemic. The country is on two major routes used by migratory birds which increase in numbers during spring and autumn. The invertebrate fauna is also very diverse, with about 19,000 species being recorded including 4,000 endemics. Fungi There are over 12,000 varieties of mushroom in Turkey. Threats Threats to biodiversity include desertification due to climate change in Turkey, which is forecast to move the ecoregions northwards, and large scale infrastructure projects such as those near Istanbul. Policy The government plans to increase protected areas from the 9% in 2019 to 17% by 2023. There are restrictions on access to environmental information.

Life  Gvardjanƒçiƒç was born in ≈†kofja Loka in Slovenia and was educated at the local primary school. After this he attended the Ljubljana School of Design and later continued painting at the Art Academy in Ljubljana. He finished his studies under Professor Maksim Sedej in 1968 and then specialised under Professor Zoran Didek in 1970. His studies brought him into contact with other famous Slovene painters including France Miheliƒç, Marij Pregelj and Gabrijel Stupica. After his graduation he continued his studies in Poland and Germany. From 1971 he worked as a teacher in a primary school until in 1987 he began work as a Professor at the Pedagogical Academy in Ljubljana. Since 1997 H. G. has worked as a professor of painting and drawing at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design in Ljubljana. He continues to live in ≈†kofja Loka, the town of his birth. Art Work Throughout his life Gvardjanƒçiƒç has proved to be an important contributor to the field of art in all its manifestations. He has helped to decipher the problematic, multi- layered world of painting as it has evolved during his own creative life. His creations are always based on the subject rather than on the abstract. In his opus we recognise that he is a painter of culture and ethics of late modernism and, despite the widespread use of new media, he insists on the expressive power of traditional painting and drawing. He trusts the visual power of his work through which he expresses the existential validity of the subjective experiences of birth, life and death. He manages to capture this with a remarkable sense of balance, composition and integrity to which he also adds his subtle touch. The concluding thought is therefore that from H.G‚Äôs works there radiates a primal instinct of the mental state of the artist. His works are present in several collections in Slovenia and abroad (Karlovac, Sombor, Rijeka, Zagreb, Belgrade, Graz, Kunsan, Lisbon, Hiroshima, Tokyo, Vienna). For his work he received the Pre≈°eren Foundation Award in 1981, the Grohar Award in 1988 and the Jakopiƒç Award in 1990. In an interview (Art Words No. 81 - 82) H.G.said: Important periods, paintings and exhibitions Between 1970 and 1972 (during the pop art movement in Europe and America) Gvardjanƒçiƒç made a series of landscape paintings in the pop art style. This resulted in his paintings entitled: Road, Figure and Landscape. Between 1972 - 1975 Gvardjanƒçiƒç enters a period of photorealism, where he was a broker in their perception of the nature of the use of photography. During this period, significant paintings are:, Southern Sky and Superpanorama. Between 1975 and 1977 he entered a period of painting entitled ¬ªTypical Landscape¬´. Two major paintings from this period are Dandelion and Shadows. In 1976 he exhibited at the Venice Biennale and in 1977 at the International Fine Arts in Belgrade. In 1978 he exhibited at the 12th Mediterranean Biennale in Alexandria. From 1977 to 1979 he painted the so-called ¬ªminimalist landscape¬´. In 1980 he produced a series of paintings entitled Grasses. Between 1982 and 1985 resulting from cycles of drawings, paintings and watercolors, he produced In Memoriam, and Reminiscence. In 1983 cycles of drawings and paintings on the theme of House of Suicide Silva, Suicide Silva fence and Intimacy. In 1984 he completed a series of images with a key painting entitled Gray sun. In 1991 he exhibited at the exhibition Kunst Europa in Siegen. In the same year he drew a picture entitled Solea and Saita (the theme music Miles Davis). In the period 1997 - 2005 he worked under the influence of the music of Nico. In 2008, he had retrospective exhibitions at the International Graphic Centre in Ljubljana, City Art Museum in Ljubljana and in the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Celje. On this occasion, his monograph was also published. Between 2008 - 2010 he painted a series entitled and Sigur Ros (Sigur R√≥s is a band from Reykjav√≠k).

The Dasamongueponke (or Dasamonguepeuk) is the name given to a Native American tribe of Secotan people and also the name of a village encountered by the English during their late 16th century attempts to settle and establish permanent colonies in what is now North Carolina, known at the time as Virginia. Together with the rest of Secotan people they formed a part of the Native American group known as the Carolina Algonquian Indians, and spoke the now extinct Carolina Algonquian language. Roanoke colony Sir Richard Grenville was the leader of the 1585 expedition which first attempted to land English settlers on Roanoke island. When Grenville left Roanoke, he left behind fifteen men, battle-hardened soldiers. When Governor John White returned in 1587 he searched for the fifteen, but found only bones.Milton, p.217 White quickly made contact with friendly natives led by Chief Manteo, who explained to him that the lost fifteen had been killed by hostile Secotan, Aquascogoc and Dasamongueponke warriors,Milton, p.218 choosing a time and place of attack \\"of great advantage to the savages\\".Milton, p.220 On August 8, 1587 White led a dawn attack on the Dasamongueponkes that went disastrously wrong. White and his soldiers entered the Dasamongueponke village in the morning \\"so early that it was yet dark\\",Miller, Lee, p.131 Retrieved April 2011 but mistakenly attacked a group of hitherto friendly Indians, killing one and wounding many. \\"We were deceaved\\", wrote White in his journal, \\"for the savages were our friendes\\". Henceforth relations with the local tribes would steadily deteriorate.Milton, p.235 Chief Manteo was granted the title of baron, the Lord of Roanoke and Dasamongueponke - the first peer created by the English in North America. Legacy Much of what is known about the lives of the Dasamongueponke and other Algonkin tribes in 16th century North Carolina survives thanks to the watercolor paintings and the journal kept by Governor John White who was commissioned in 1585 to \\"draw to life\\" the inhabitants of the New World and their surroundings.Article in Smithsonian Magazine by Abigal Tucker, December 2008 Retrieved March 2011 During White's time at Roanoke Island, he completed numerous watercolor drawings of the surrounding landscape and native peoples. These works are significant as they are the most informative illustrations of a Native American society of the Eastern seaboard, and predate the first body of \\"discovery voyage art\\" created in the late 18th century by the artists who sailed with Captain James Cook. They represent the sole surviving visual record of the native inhabitants of America, encountered by England's first settlers. White's enthusiasm for watercolor was unusual - most contemporary painters preferred to use oil-based paints.Milton, p.199 White's watercolors would soon become a sensation in Europe and it was not long before the paintings were engraved by the Flemish master engraver Theodore de Bry,Milton, p.200 and through the medium of print, became widely known and distributed; published in 1590 under the title \\"America\\".

This 10 article law is derived from the first part of a longer draft bill, drafted and released by the Pact of Unity by November 2010. The law defines Mother Earth as \\"a collective subject of public interest,\\" and declares both Mother Earth and life-systems (which combine human communities and ecosystems) as titleholders of inherent rights specified in the law.Ley (Corta) de Derechos de Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 5. The short law proclaims the creation of the Defensor√≠a de la Madre Tierra a counterpart to the human rights ombudsman office known as the Defensor√≠a del Pueblo, but leaves its structuring and creation to future legislation.Ley (Corta) de Derechos de Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 10. A heavily revised version of the longer bill was passed as the Framework Law of Mother Earth and Integral Development for Living Well (; Law 300) on October 15, 2012. Investing nature with rights The law defines Mother Earth as \\"...the dynamic living system formed by the indivisible community of all life systems and living beings whom are interrelated, interdependent, and complementary, which share a common destiny; adding that \\"Mother Earth is considered sacred in the worldview of Indigenous peoples and nations.Ley (Corta) de Derechos de Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 3. In this approach human beings and their communities are considered a part of mother earth, by being integrated in \\"Life systems\\" defined as \\"...complex and dynamic communities of plants, animals, micro-organisms and other beings in their environment, in which human communities and the rest of nature interact as a functional unit, under the influence of climatic, physiographic and geologic factors, as well as the productive practices and cultural diversity of Bolivians of both genders, and the world views of Indigenous nations and peoples, intercultural communities and the Afro-Bolivians.Ley (Corta) de Derechos de Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 4. This definition can be seen as a more inclusive definition of ecosystems because it explicitly includes the social, cultural and economic dimensions of human communities. The law also establishes the juridical character of Mother Earth as \\"collective subject of public interest\\", to ensure the exercise and protection of her rights. By giving Mother Earth a legal personality, it can, through its representatives (humans), bring an action to defend its rights. Additionally, to say that Mother Earth is of public interest represents a major shift from an anthropocentric perspective to a more Earth community based perspective. Content The law enumerates seven specific rights to which Mother Earth and her constituent life systems, including human communities, are entitled:Ley (Corta) de Derechos de Madre Tierra, December 2010, article 7. *To life: It is the right to the maintenance of the integrity of life systems and natural processes which sustain them, as well as the capacities and conditions for their renewal *To the Diversity of Life: It is the right to the preservation of the differentiation and variety of the beings that comprise Mother Earth, without being genetically altered, nor artificially modified in their structure, in such a manner that threatens their existence, functioning and future potential *To water: It is the right of the preservation of the quality and composition of water to sustain life systems and their protection with regards to contamination, for renewal of the life of Mother Earth and all its components *To clean air: It is the right of the preservation of the quality and composition of air to sustain life systems and their protection with regards to contamination, for renewal of the life of Mother Earth and all its components *To equilibrium: It is the right to maintenance or restoration of the inter-relation, interdependence, ability to complement and functionality of the components of Mother Earth, in a balanced manner for the continuation of its cycles and the renewal of its vital processes *To restoration: It is the right to the effective and opportune restoration of life systems affected by direct or indirect human activities *To live free of contamination: It is the right for preservation of Mother Earth and any of its components with regards to toxic and radioactive waste generated by human activities Drafting and legislative process The Pact of Unity (which gathers the major Bolivian indigenous and campesino organizations) drafted the long version of the Law between the April 2010 World People's Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth and October 2010, when they finished the final version in a joined effort with a commission of the Plurinational Legislative Assembly, the Bolivian Vice- Ministry of Environment, and a legal team of constitutional development from the Vice President's Office. Later, a ten-article short version was agreed with then Senator Freddy Bersatti and Deputy Galo Silvestre, to be passed by the Legislative Assembly in December 2010. The short version was rushed so as to be presented by president Evo Morales at the 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference. The Framework Law was expected to be considered by the Assembly in 2011, but was not. In February 2012, Senator Eugenio Rojas, who heads the governing party's delegation, describes the law as among six priorities for early passage in 2012. It was passed in October 2012. Precedent The law is considered to be the first national environmental law, other than Ecuador's 2008 constitutional provision, to recognize the rights of a natural entity. It may also allow for citizens to sue individuals and groups as part of \\"Mother Earth\\" in response to real and alleged infringements of its integrity. Thus far, however, the impact of this law appears to be limited.

To maintain morale, wartime censors minimized early reports of illness and mortality in Germany, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the French Third Republic, and the United States. Papers were free to report the epidemic's effects in neutral Restoration-era Spain (such as the grave illness of King Alfonso XIII).
