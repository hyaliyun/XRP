His four pickoffs through September 6 were the most in the majors in 2020, and he needed only 12 pickoff attempts to do so. Since his major league debut in 2017, Fried's 14 pickoffs were the most in the majors, and he was successful on 19% of his attempts. In that same time-span, pitchers in all of baseball had been successful in picking off runners in only 0.017% of attempts. Fried started the season by becoming the first left-handed pitcher to not allow any home runs through eight starts, with his team winning every game, since Babe Ruth in 1917. In the Covid-shortened 2020 regular season, Fried was a perfect 7-0 with a 2.25 ERA and a 1.09 WHIP.

He was 2nd-lowest in home runs per nine innings pitched (0.32), 6th in ERA, ground ball percentage (53.0%), and highest percentage of ground balls (22.5%), 7th in LOB% (82.0%), and 10th in lowest batting average against (.209), lowest line drive percentage (19.5%), and lowest fly ball percentage (27.5%). He allowed only two home runs (in 56 innings), both after he tweaked his ankle fielding a bunt in his only inning of work in his last start of the season. On defense, he led all major league pitchers in assists for the second consecutive season, with 15. Fried throws a 94‚Äì96 mph four-seam fastball. He also throws two types of a 74 mph \\"plus\\" curveball (which he patterned after that of Sandy Koufax), an 84 mph slider (since 2019), a 93 mph sinker, and an 84 mph change-up.

Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre y C√≠a. (1979-88) The company started under the name Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre y C√≠a Ltda. in 1979. In the licitaci√≥n of that year, it received a paltry 1 1/2 hours a week of programming. The flagship program of this programadora, which aired in one of Colombian television's best timeslots (Sundays, 8pm, Primera Cadena), was Revivamos nuestra historia (Let's Revive Our History). Since Lemaitre lived in Cartagena (and since most of the national television infrastructure was and is centered in Bogot√°), Promec Televisi√≥n produced the programs (but Lemaitre had final approval of the scripts and contents). Promec also marketed the other half-hour a week that this programadora was allocated (Friday 5pm, Cadena Dos; originally home to the program Debates Lemaitre, it soon was replaced with The Pink Panther Show. In the licitaci√≥n of 1983, in which Lemaitre received 3.5 hours a week, Revivamos nuestra historia (renamed in 1985 to Revivamos la historia) moved from 8pm to 8:30pm (directly after Noticiero Promec), where it would remain until its cancellation in 1987 due to high program costs. Other programs in this time period included Telesemana with Jota Mario Valencia on Saturday mornings, then on Saturday afternoons in conjunction with Producciones Cinevisi√≥n; a spinoff of Revivamos nuestra historia known as Revivamos Nuestra Historia Universal featuring world history topics; and a Saturday afternoon sports news program called Deportev√© con Oscar Renter√≠a. The licitaci√≥n of 1987 awarded Lemaitre 4 hours a week, used to broadcast shows like the TV series Genghis Khan , the journalistic program Nuestro Colombia, Grandes Series Mundiales, and the animated El Correcaminos. Lemaitre also teamed up with Promec in another area: the programming of movies for holidays (festivos), beginning in 1984 and continuing through 1991. In 1988, Producciones Eduardo Lemaitre was sold to Humberto Arbel√°ez, the founder of Promec. Under his direction, the programadora took on a new name: CPT (Compa√±√≠a Productora de Televisi√≥n). CPT (1988-93) This first incarnation of CPT inherited Lemaitre's four hours a week of programming, plus it continued to program festivos. Most of the programs stayed. Debts piled up, and CPT (like Promec and Gegar Televisi√≥n) did not place a bid in the licitaci√≥n of 1991, exiting television in August of that year. CPT however did come back briefly in 1992-93 to program festivos on Canal A. CPT (1997-2003) In 1997, the dead CPT was acquired by Fernando Barrero Ch√°vez, Gustavo Castro Caicedo and Francisco Jos√© Pereira, placing a bid in that year's licitaci√≥n. It was awarded 9.5 hours a week on Canal A, airing programs including Sexo Sentido con Luc√≠a Nader, the War of the Worlds TV series, and Todo por la Plata, transferred from DFL Televisi√≥n. It also partnered with Andes Televisi√≥n to air the Premier Caracol movie for the first seven months of 1998. (Caracol was not awarded any timeslots on Saturday prior to becoming a private channel; S√°bados Felices was being presented by Coestrellas, CPS and Proyectamos Televisi√≥n.) CPT, however, did not receive a news license, for which it had bid. By 2001, CPT, amidst the rapidly growing programadoras crisis, had fallen under Ley 550, Colombia's then-bankruptcy reorganization law. It would leave the air in 2003.

Ken Albala, Food Cultures of the World Encyclopedia: Four Volumes, ABC-CLIO, 1400 pages, 2011. Oil down is a stew of breadfruit, salted meat, chicken, dumplings, callaloo, and other vegetables, all stewed in coconut milk, herbs, and spices to make a hearty and flavorful one-pot meal.Jeanne Jacob, Michael Ashkenazi. The World Cookbook for Students, Volume 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007 - 296 pages, It is called oil down because the coconut milk simmers down and releases its rich flavored oil into the pot. All of the liquid is cooked down (dried out), hence the name oil down. Grenadians might also use the term oil down in reference to a traditional neighborhood party where they serve the oil down stew cooked over an open fire. Traditionally it is the men who cook the oil down at such parties. Oil down is also very popular in local restaurants. There is no one, set recipe for oil down, as each household and each parish makes it to suit their preference. > Unlike most stews, in which the ingredients get a thorough mixing during the > cooking process, a pot of oil down is \\"packed.\\" Exactly how to \\"pack the > pot\\" is a matter of taste and tradition, as well as a subject of occasional > controversy. Everyone has a different order and method, but usually the > breadfruit and meat goes on the bottom, most of the vegetables in the > middle, and the callaloo leaves and dumplings on top. The ingredients simmer > in situ. > Traditionally, the dish is finished when all the liquid has been absorbed, > which usually takes at least an hour, depending on the size of (the) pot. Oil down is not unique to Grenada, as it is also very popular in nearby Trinidad and Tobago, which shares a long history of cultural influences from the Spice Isle. There are differences in how each island makes its oil down, however, with Grenadians preferring dasheen, dumplings, and turmeric while Trinis tend toward a simpler dish without dumplings, but with hot peppers. There are different versions of this stew in other Caribbean countries as well. In Guyana they make mettagee, or mettem, and in Jamaica they have a seafood version called run downJamaica - Montego Bay, Port Antonio and Ocho Rios - John Bigley - Google Books p. (unlisted). Historical significance On the small Caribbean island of Grenada, where locals have to deal with limited freshwater, seasonal rainfall, and natural disasters, and where the majority of the food is imported from the US and neighboring islands, oil down is one dish that Grenadians can call their own. > Although many things in Grenada have been influenced by the Europeans over > the years, oil down remains something purely Grenadian. No imported spices > or seasonings, no choice cuts of meat here. This one-pot meal is made up of > local vegetables, ‚Äúprovisions‚Äù (the local term for starchy root vegetables, > tubers, and bananas that fill you up), salted meat, and aromatic seasoning ‚Äî > all easily accessible, affordable ingredients in Grenada. Nearly every ingredient in this hearty stew has a unique origin and story to tell. For example, callaloo, and its root, dasheen, are indigenous to the Caribbean and were cultivated by Grenada's earliest Amerindian inhabitants. Today, oil down is a staple at the family table and at special gatherings, during the annual Carnival bacchanal or simply as a weekend feast.

This innovation was reported in the Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics, and recognized by Time magazine as one of the top 10 medical breakthroughs in 2010. In this work, Carson, et al. introduced theca cells donated by reproductive-age patients into \\"3-D Petri dishes\\" designed to resemble the sponge-like cells of a human ovary. In the lab, the cell types interacted with one another and functioned for all intents and purposes like a real ovary, even successfully maturing a human egg from its earliest stages in the follicle to a fully developed form. To build the ovary, honeycombs of theca cells were formed, one of two key types in the ovary, donated by reproductive-age patients at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island. Together with human egg cells, donated granulosa cells were inserted into the honeycomb shape the theca cells formed. In days, the theca cells enveloped the granulosa and eggs, mimicking a real ovary. Clinically, the artificial ovary could play a significant role in the future, eventually yielding new infertility treatments for women by preserving the fertility of cancer patients, for example: immature eggs could be salvaged and frozen before chemotherapy or radiation, and then matured outside the patient in the artificial ovary. In parallel with this effort and a scientific first, Carson co-directed a research team by extracting information about gene expression from fertile human egg cells without hurting them. In this work the team was able to sequence the transcribed genetic material, or mRNA, in egg cells, in smaller structures pinched off from them called polar bodies. Polar bodies are nonfunctional and incapable of being fertilized. This new technique could ultimately give parents and doctors a preview of which eggs are likely to make the most viable embryos.  Education  Carson earned her medical degree from Northwestern University Medical School. She is a diplomate of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology with sub-specialty certification in reproductive endocrinology and infertility. Career Carson has more than three decades of experience as a scientist, clinician, and teacher, much of which has focused on the field of reproductive endocrinology. Carson has served as the chair of REI Board of the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ABOG) and chair of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs. She currently serves as editor-in-chief of Sexuality, Reproduction and Menopause. Carson most recently served as Vice President of Education with the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and is an Adjunct Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, where she served as Director of the Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility from 2007-2014.

It was heard in the Transvaal Provincial Division on April 28 and 29, 1949, with judgement on July 15. Murray AJP, Ramsbottom J and Blackwell J presided. A. Shacksonvis KC (with him A. Mendelow) appeared for the appellant, and A. Suzman KC (with him MJ Hart) for the respondent. The appellant's attorneys were Schwartz & Goldblatt; the respondent's were Podlashuc, Meintjes, Liebson & Klagsbrun. The case was an appeal from a decision in the Witwatersrand Local Division by Neser J. Its significance lies in the area of civil procedure, with its determination that the court in application proceedings, where a material fact arises which cannot be resolved by viva voce evidence, may either direct the parties to trial or dismiss the application with costs.  Judgment  Ramsbottom J and Blackwell J concurred in the judgment of Murray AJP, who reiterated that, except in interlocutory matters, it is undesirable to attempt to settle disputes of fact solely on the probabilities disclosed in contradictory affidavits. Where no real dispute of fact exists, there is no reason for incurring the delay and expense involved in a trial action: Motion proceedings in such a case are generally recognised as permissible. Where a dispute of fact is shown to exist, however, the court has a discretion as to the future course of the proceedings. If the dispute of fact cannot properly be determined by viva voce evidence under Rule 9,The calling of evidence under this Rule rests with the court or judge, regardless of whether or not the parties request it. It is, in other words, solely in his discretion. the parties may be sent to trial in the ordinary way (either on the affidavits as constituting the pleadings, or else with a direction that pleadings be filed); otherwise the application may be dismissed with costs.

The club was constructed by the Bagdad Enterprises, Inc., a Texas corporation, controlled by Eastern capital. The corporation was a subsidiary of a large Eastern company that confined itself to various theatrical lines. The architect was W. Scott Dunne (1886‚Äì1937), a well-known designer of theaters in Texas.  Facilities  The building was a Moorish style, two-story building, clad in pinkish gray stucco. The exterior had rounded spires, influenced by old buildings of the Moors. It was distinctively oriental in all of its features. The building was built on . The building was set back three hundred feet from the road and featured a horseshoe driveway to the main entry. There was a walkway leading to the entry with a large fountain in the center. When the club opened, it had a parking lot for over three hundred automobiles. The interior featured a stage, dance floor, dining rooms, and lounging rooms.

Fils du jardinier des Roussy, Edouard Muller, ancien du coll√®ge de Vevey, √©tait entr√© √† Nestl√© en 1903 et s'√©tait distingu√© pendant la Premi√®re Guerre mondiale √† la direction des agences de vente du Proche-Orient, √† Constantinople, √† Salonique et √† Ath√®nes. Un quart de si√®cle plus tard, il va rendre de plus grands services encore en Am√©rique. C'est une force de la nature. C'est aussi une force d'√¢me. Autant Dapples √©tait un banquier, homme de haut lignage, catapult√© d'en haut, .... Edouard Muller meurt brusquement en 1948 √† la fin d'un voyage en Am√©rique latine et aux Etats-Unis.\\" Childhood Edouard Muller was born on February 16, 1885, the son of Edouard Johann Muller, and grandson of Johann Muller owner of a gasthouse (large inn), who was born in Untersiggenthal in canton of Aargau, Switzerland. His father moved from his home village to seek gardening work in the shores area of Lac Leman. His father found employment at the home called La Beque, owned by the family of a wealthy founder of the Nestl√© company whose family patriarch was Emil-Louis Roussy who served on the Nestle Board of Directors from 1905 until 1920. Edouard Johann earned acclaim in the Vaud Horticultural Society while employed by the Roussy's and he married Philippine Denereaz from nearby Chardonne and Corsier. Edouard Johann and Philippine had two children, Rose and Edouard Muller. They enjoyed the lakeside, the gardens, the orchard and the Roussy yacht ‚ÄúVesta‚Äù. Young Edouard explored the old underground passages of the old castle of La Tour-de-Peilz. His schooling records were good but noted some indiscipline. His formal education ended at age 16. Early business career Muller started his outside employment career with the bank Credit Leman at age 16 as an apprentice. He was fired in three days because he played a trick on a friend. Or so he thought. He locked the door at lunch time expecting his friend to look through the old large keyhole of the door to see what he could to explain why the door was locked. When Edouard squirted water through the hole after the rattling when the next person came to enter, he squished that water into the manager's eye. He was excused for his youthful indiscretion and remained there for two years. Nestl√© Muller was given an introduction to start employment at Nestle Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company when Emil-Louis Roussy used his influence to help the 18-year-old. Edouard became the corresponding secretary for Mr. Alfred Liotard, who together with Mr. Louis Aguet headed Nestle's overseas business starting October 1, 1903. Edouard was multi-lingual at this time. He spoke German, French and English. He enjoyed the hectic pace of work after the mail arrived by boat monthly. Edouard became friends with Ariste Lehmann, another Swiss in England and they saved and ventured to Paris to enjoy its cultures that differed from those in London. He did not enjoy the gray and damp London weather and longed for the warmer lakeside climate he grew up in. Edouard's first manager's position was in the Chocolate Export Department. In 1908 he was made manager of the South American Department. He was later made manager of the Near East Agencies covering the Balkans, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The headquarters to one of the countries was in Constantinople, now Istanbul. Mr. Liotard suggested Edouard move to Constantinople which was happily accepted by Edouard and his family. Arriving in Istanbul in 1911 at the age of twenty-six he conceived the idea of promoting chocolate sales among women by including movie-coupons in the wrappers.Wilson library bulletin: Stanley Kunitz, Marie D. Loizeaux, H.W. Wilson Company - 1948 \\"Edouard Muller, head of Nestles milk ... Sent to Turkey at the age of twenty-six to promote Nestle's products, he conceived the idea of movies for the harem-bound women of Istanbul, having chocolate labels for entrance fees.\\" Unfortunately, the war between the Turks and the Bulgarians soon forced a move for Edouard and family to Athens, where they lived at the Hotel de Grand Bretagne and then at a rented home in Kephica.  World War I  World War I started in August 1914 while Edouard was in the Near-East where British and German forces were active. Condensed milk and chocolate were very much in demand for the troops. Moving goods was a constant problem with some items being scarce and travel was difficult because individuals needed special military permits. Edouard worked with gentlemen Nestl√© associates named Brander, Riggenbach and Gredinger who were also Swiss citizens. Edouard was in Salonika during a five o'clock in the morning bombing led by the Germans. A squadron of 20 airplanes dropped bombs. The zeppelin could not reach Salonika according to Edward. He, while still in his pajamas, jumped into a small boat with someone from the Hotel Olympos and watched the bombing. The target district was where the customs offices were near the Olympos Hotel. He noted in a letter to his wife that business had deteriorated because no one wanted to stock up at this time. Edouard wanted to centralize near East operations in Egypt but the military would not provide such a permit. Edouard therefore centralized activities in Athens. Once while in Athens when the city was a target for bombing from battleships Edouard used his body to cover his son and protect him in the staircase of the hotel in which they were staying. Edouard was appointed a delegate of the Swiss Red Cross which allowed him access to Swiss diplomatic pouches. Edouard was asked favors by persons wanting to use that diplomatic pouch. Edouard did have to obtain dismissal at a military court of spying charges as a result of suspicions. As the First World War was drawing to an end Nestl√© move the Muller family to Paris where it now had one of its headquarters. Nestl√© at this time was in trouble due to the huge stocks of products, including large quantities of sweetened condensed milk with coffee flavor. In order to sell products a good deal of traveling was necessary. Edouard traveled to Egypt in sweltering heat. In 1918 the British troops were still in Egypt and they could use the goods he had to dispose of. Edouard was promoted to manager for the European and Latin American markets at the Paris headquarters. Edouard faced a surplus of canned food for which demand had dropped and disposal became a difficulty. All merchants faced difficult times as well. Nestl√© and the Anglo Swiss Milk Company did not escape the financial crisis that developed after the 1914 to 1918 war. The company had suffered such losses that the nominal value of its shares had to be cut in half in 1921. Creditor banks took some control over the organization and lent additional monies to the business and controlled the corporate recovery to some degree. Louis Dapples, a Swiss who had been living in Italy, with a long banking career and international ties was appointed Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Nestl√©. At that time, Nestl√© had several head offices including one in London with Mr. L. Auget as President, one in Paris with Mr. A Liotard and another in Cham with Mr. Page and one in Vevey, Switzerland with Mr. Roussy, whose family held a large block of Nestl√© stock. Dapples reorganized Nestl√© and those four aforementioned managers were forced to quit. Dapples looked for someone who had overall knowledge and sales experience to run the business with him. Muller was selected and was sent all over Europe to report on the actual situation facing various branches of the Nestl√© group. Muller was away from home for months at a time collecting information and creating numerous reports. Edouard's opinion and heart felt that the foundation of Nestl√© was still in healthy condition. Inter-war years After this extensive field research work, Muller was made a general manager of Nestl√©. Dapples wished to relocate the head office to London; Muller simply refused to go. He had not liked the weather in London when he was stationed there before. Dapples then asked if Muller would consider staying in Switzerland in Vevey, to which he readily agreed. Many key Nestl√© men moved from London and Paris and Cham to consolidate headquarters in Vevey. Edouard faced considerable corporate jealousy due to his new position. Edouard had to take many driving journeys to France, Germany, Spain and other countries to keep full control over the reorganization and marketing activities. He had very little time to spend at home. When Muller was at home, had a massage at 7:00 AM and then reviewed mail in the quiet of his home because he would not have a quiet moment at work. Generally his work day in Vevey started at 9:00 AM and continued to 7:00 PM. During travel, his days were usually even longer. Edouard lost his first wife, Jeanne Levillain from Paris, to septicimia in 1929. Edouard had married Jeanne, a blonde secretary in early 1910, when he was 25. They had three children: two sons who were grown and a young daughter. Edouard married his second wife, Else Ellen Margery Hemmeler, in Zurich on October 7, 1930. In 1931 Edouard and Ellen took the boat-train from Paris to Le Havre and then left on the SS Paris for a six- day cruise. This was the first trip to the US for the couple. They stayed at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. Edouard had business at the Nestle offices on Lafayette Street. After the NYC stay, they traveled to Cuba via Key West on a train and then to Cuba by boat. On their return by train they met a Cuban friend of Edouard's who shared with them his contraband alcohol in their Pullman car. It was during prohibition. They returned through Miami staying at the Pancoast Hotel. Then returned through New York where they were entertained by Mr. Hardenberg, a Nestle Manager in New York, and continued on to Niagara Falls en route to Montreal. They returned to Europe, sailing from Quebec on the SS Empress of Australia to Liverpool. Edouard took many trips by the Renault convertible through France to Spain. They went via Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, Algeciras and Gibraltar. They were entertained by Nestle officials in each small factory location including Mr. Trais, a Nestle legal advisor, Mr. Pfersich in Santander and Jaime de Semir, who became the Chairman of Nestle in Spain, in Sitges. Mr. Hardenberg was succeeded as Nestle manager in New York by Daniel F. Norton, President of Nestle, succeeding Louis Dapples as Nestle President. In the spring of 1935, Edouard and Ellen returned to New York for their second trip via Genua aboard the Conte di Savoia in May. They stayed at the new Waldorf Astoria Hotel and then went to Cuba with the Dan Norton's. They toured the Nestle factory in Sancti Spiritu. They visited Veracruz and Mexico City by train and Teotihuacan and Chapultepec and a factory in Ocotlan. They went by train to Mazatlan and then sailed to Los Angeles. They returned to New York by train. In the spring of 1936, Muller was in Madrid, Spain staying at the Ritz Hotel, experiencing the sentiments of the Spanish Civil War that broke out that year. Nestle had their Spanish headquarters in Barcelona. Those offices were taken over by the revolutionary workers‚Äô committee. Edouard's good friend Jaime de Semir was a declared a loyalist and he was charged for crimes and condemned to death. He fled to the sanctuary of Edouard's home in La Tour de Peilz, Switzerland via protection of the French Consulate aboard a French battleship that left Barcelona from Marseille. The deSemir family returned to San Sebastien in 1937, an area that had not been taken over by the revolutionaries. In 1937, Dapples died shortly after a trans-Atlantic trip to his home in Genua. Muller had secretly assured that a doctor discreetly accompany the Dappleses during the trip on the ship. That helped ease Dapples's pain but did not improve his condition. Edouard was elected Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Nestle-Anglo Swiss Condensed Milk Company in August 1937, the month of Dapples's death. In September 1937, Edouard and Ellen went to the Mediterranean for both pleasure and business. They toured Delphie, Mikaene, Olympos, Athens and Kyphissia and historical sites of the area. They toured the offices in Athens and Istanbul where they toured the chocolate factory. They sailed to Smyrna, where they toured the factories processing figs and raisins. They cruised on the Milwaukee, ending their trip on October 12 returning to Milan by car. Edouard then turned to more Swiss business requirements of the new corporation head. He dined with the Brandts of Omega, at Colonel Divisionnaire Henri Guisan's (later the General of the Swiss Army in 1939), at Mr. and Mrs. Schulthess, then the President of the Swiss Confederation. Other heads of state included Mr. and Mrs. Musy and Mr. Pilet-Golaz. Muller addressed the General Assembly of Nestle-Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company as its President in April 1938 at Cham. Present were C. J. Abegg, G. Huguenin, M. Patternot, A. Perrochet and P. Visinand. Edouard's third trip to the United States was in May 1938 via the S.S. Normandy, leaving from LeHavre with about 950 passengers on a five-day crossing. They started in the Waldorf Towers and then toured factories in Columbus, Ohio, Sunbury, Marysville and Greenville. After meetings in New York, they sailed to Cuba on the S.S. Roma for three days of factory tours and then sailed to Crisotbal, Panama on the steamer Veraqua. Mr. Blau, the Nestle manager in Panama, took them to Colon and through the Panama Canal and then by train to Panama City. They drove over 100 miles to the La Venta area to visit the factory being built in Nata. They returned to Cristobal to sail to Kingston, Jamaica to see the Minister of Agriculture regarding Nestle business in Jamaica, where they stayed at the Myrtle Bank Hotel. They sailed to Haiti and then sailed on the S.S. Santa Rosa to New York. They returned to Europe on the Normandy at the end of June, arriving in Le Havre after five days at sea and taking a train to Paris and then returned home.  World War II  The fall of 1938 led to an agreement signed on September 29, by Chamberlain, Hitler and Mussolini in Munich, that there would be no war. In late October, Edouard and Ellen toured Germany, Frankfurt and the Nestle factory in Hattersheim. They went to Hamburg and to the factory in Kappeln. In Berlin they stayed at the Adlon Hotel, Unter den Linden. Business affairs took place at the Sarotti offices in Tempelhof. During the visit, they noticed signs indicating ‚Äúair raid shelter‚Äù in the hotel and at the theater. When Edouard returned to Switzerland, he ordered 150 suitcases to be sent to the Vevey office. His plan was that if war was to be started that all the important papers of Nestle should be sent to the London office. In February 1939 on a ski trip to Arosa with his friend and business associate H. Riggenbach from the Berlin office, they reviewed the political situation in Germany. They agreed that the situation was desperate. Muller signed a declaration of moral rearmament. Shortly thereafter, Hitler's troops marched into Czechoslovakia. During his work trip to a board meeting of the Credit Suisse in April in Z√ºrich, he also went to the United States Consulate. There he obtained immigration visas to go to the United States. He planned a trip to the United States and South America for his family and to visit factories in those countries. On June 1, 1939, on the SS Washington, they had their daughters in tow, ages thirteen, seven and six. Their son Roland remained in Switzerland completing his doctorate in Z√ºrich and their son Andre went back to Spain, working for Nestl√©. The trip started in New York, where they enjoyed the New York world's fair. There were numerous business affairs to attend to in New York. In early July, the family left for South America on the White Star line of the Barbados. They landed in Rio de Janeiro and left Santos, arriving in Montevideo on August 1. Edouard toured the factory there with Nicanor Fernandez. The following day, they arrived in Buenos Aires and stayed at the Alvear Palace Hotel. Edouard met the president of Argentina, Dr. Ortiz, at an auction for Champion bull. Fernandez accompanied the couple to Chile for a week of inspection of the Nestl√© organization there. The children were left in Buenos Aires with their governess. They left Argentina on August 21 on the SS Avilaof the British Star Line. They returned to Brazil on August 27 after enduring a trip when all portholes were darkened due to German submarines in the surrounding waters. While in Rio de Janeiro' they received word that Hitler declared war against Poland on September 1. England and France declared war against Germany on September 3. Consequently, Edouard had many meetings, cables and discussions including one with the Minister of Switzerland, Mr. Traversini. Concluding that Switzerland would be surrounded by warring factions, Edouard made a decision for the family to emigrate to the United States. The family departed for New York on the SS Brazil on September 6. Edward's pre-planning for contingency developments then took place. The heads of the international departments, and the technical and accounting departments who already had their immigration visas, began to arrive in New York via London. The many suitcases with the import documents for Nestl√© were sent to New York. Nestl√© would be able to transfer royalties and international income through Panama through Unilac, Inc. Some of the important Nestl√© managers, and their families, that moved were Guy Parker, Gustave Huguenin, Pepin, Dommens, Menziz, F. Gysler, and Dr. Warner Oppikofer, the legal advisor. Therefore, many more, including secretaries, who had Nestl√© pre-agreed their contingency departure. The Nestl√© offices were at 44th St. in New York. One of the responsibilities was to find housing for the incoming employees and additional office space. Edouard Muller settled at One Atlantic Street in Stamford, Connecticut for additional office space. Edouard and the family settled in a rented house on the Sound at Smithfield Point. It reminded them of their lakeside home in La Tour De Peilz. The family recognized that US citizens had no understanding of the horrors of war that they had experienced while in Europe. At the end of June 1940, Andre Muller arrived in New York on the SS Washington from Spain. It had been impossible to get his passage on the only plane flying from Lisbon to the US. Ticket sales had entered into a black market. His ship had been stopped by a German submarine while en route. Passengers were forced to jump into lifeboats and dangle over the ocean until the Germans understood their mistake since the United States was not yet at war with them. The incident made New York newspapers. Andre returned via LaGuardia Airfield on a Yankee clipper for Lisbon in August. Edouard developed his contacts with the assistance of Daniel Norton and other Nestl√© employees in the United States. Edward met Homer Cummings, Atty. Gen. of the United States and friend of President F. D. Roosevelt. He played at the Pinehurst Golf Course for the Homer Cummings Tournament and was able to network with many US leaders and senators to the benefit of Nestl√©. October 1, 1943 was the 40th anniversary celebration for Edouard Muller having joined Nestle-Anglo- Swiss Milk Company in London in 1903. A private party at his house was done first and the event was again commemorated at the annual Christmas party for Nestle at the Roosevelt Hotel in New York City. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Edouard's advice about Europe become more sought after by US heads of state and industry. Many high-level meetings took place with Swiss and US business interested people. Edouard and family stayed in touch with expatriated Swiss nationals while in the US. The Nestle annual Christmas party was given in 1945 after the end of the war. Things were returning to normalcy. Gas rationing had ended. Post-war years Muller was a co-sponsor for the \\"Declaration of European Interdependence\\", advocating that \\"only a continental confederation can coordinate the common political, economic and military interests of Europe and the personal rights of all Europeans.\\" This concept was in an article was presented on March 26, 1945 in Time Magazine. The principal sponsor of the declaration was Count Richard N. Coudenhove-Kalergi, a visiting professor of history at New York University. In the summer of 1946, Edouard and Ellen Muller went to Canada and visited the factories in Toronto and Fulton. Edouard was dismayed by the lack of distribution of Nestle products in Montreal and Quebec and so he redirected his brother-in-law, a Nestle employee who had been destined to go to the Dutch Indies but had been refused by the government, to develop the markets in Canada. Rolf Hemmeler and his family became stationed in Toronto in November 1946. Edouard arranged a reorganization of the Stamford offices by having A. Perrochet and R. de Salis move to the US to perform the task as Edouard prepared to return to Switzerland and the Vevey offices. On March 19, 1947, Edouard Muller and his family returned to Le Havre on the way home on the S.S. America. They had a large reception at landing and then overnighted in Paris to return home on March 29. Muller returned to find internal corporate rivalries within the Vevey offices. He gave a speech at an event he organized at the Casino du Rivage in Vevey called ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAmerique, un people sur rou√©s‚Äù. His speech was noted as demonstrating his kindness, cheer, guidance and leadership. Muller was involved in secret negotiations with the Maggi Group. They worked with Credit Swiss and the federal government and the President of Maggi, C. J. Abegg. Most meetings were in Zurich or Bern. In April 1948, the successful merger was approved by the general assembly of the shareholders and the company changed names from the Nestle-Anglo-Swiss Milk Company to Nestle Alimentana.  Retirement  On May 21, 1948, the family returned to Connecticut on the S. S. America for the June 19 wedding of their oldest daughter. On July 16, they departed for South America to have a working vacation, as usual. They ported at Santa Paula, Cura√ßao and in Venezuela. They went on car trips to factories and met with location managers to get briefed on operations. Edouard weighed the idea of going to Australia to see operations there but recognized that he was too important an employee for the corporation to allow the three months of absence from the offices to do so. He would have to rely on reports from those factories and offices. Muller felt that air travel was too risky for him for the same reasons. In August 1948, Muller went to the west coast with the Dan Norton couple to see operations there. They were also scoping out the possibility of having US Nestle operations in the Midwest somewhere. They traveled on the 20th Century Railroad from New York to Chicago and then took the City of Portland train to Portland, Oregon. Then they traveled by train to Oakland and took the ferry to San Francisco. They visited the factory in San Jose. Then they went again by train with lots of luggage to Los Angeles and stayed at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel for four days. The employees toured many places in the greater LA area. The Mullers left on August 16 for the Grand Canyon. In Colorado Springs, where they stayed at The Broadmoor resort, Edouard met with local officials to discuss the possibility of building Nestle US headquarters in their city. He and Dan Norton had visited several building sites and locations suitable for such a headquarters. Edouard felt unrest remained in both the Pacific and the Atlantic so he was seeking a place remote from the coasts as long-term planning for Nestle. The family returned by train through Denver to Chicago to New York to Stamford. Edouard complained of a headache on September 15, 1948. At 10:30 AM at work, he collapsed with a temperature of 104¬∞ and was nearly unconscious. Doctors felt it was a cerebral hemorrhage. He died of an abscess behind his left ear that developed into an infection of the brain on September 28, 1948. He was 63 years old.  Management philosophy  At Credit Leman, Muller witnessed a peasant wanting to borrow 5 francs to buy a scythe because he had nothing and needed to earn money. Edouard remembered other incidents of those who needed to borrow to live. He did not forget that experience. ;Humor:Muller has many examples during his life in which he demonstrated his good sense of humor. There is a photo of him in Taormina in 1930 with ears held in place on his head made from cactus sections. He also has his wife hold a camel in 1937 in front of an Egyptian pyramid. And in 1935 when he and friends and Ellen went to The Brown Derby in Los Angeles upon departure made some autograph hunters happy by signing for himself ‚ÄúTom Collins‚Äù and his friends en suite signed as ‚ÄúJohn Haig‚Äù and as ‚ÄúJohnny Walker‚Äù. He also sent home photos of him seated on boxes in front of his tent in the desert while selling products and of him waiting at a railway station with many suitcase and trunks declaring on the photo ‚ÄúPoor me‚Äù. ;Gather intelligence:In 1918 Edouard used his intelligence to gather information about the stern and serious quartermaster who was a colonel. He learned from a bartender that the colonel collected scarabs and was quite a specialist in that field. So Edouard bought several cheap scarabs and added to them an old and expensive one. When Edouard showed the scarabs wrapped in a cloth to the bartender at the colonel glanced over and of course got involved in the conversation with Edouard. Edouard sold the entire lot of sweetened condensed milk with coffee flavor to the colonel who of course likely gained a rare scarab. ;Know your employees:Edouard almost daily ate his meals with staff at the Epicure, across the street from the offices where they ate in the back of the kitchen in casual surroundings. He entertained often at his home and organized trips and events for staff. He took staff on working vacation retreats where much problem solving took place. ;Not be too ostentatious:Muller refused the suggestion in the early 1940s to buy a Cadillac, the top of the line car in the US, and instead bought a Packard. He reasoned he could buy two cars for the price of one Cadillac and they were not as showy.  Personal life  Edouard married a blonde secretary, Jeanne Levillain, from Paris in early 1910. He was 25. His father died after a brief illness in April 1914 at the age of 64. Edouard was 29. His mother did not die until the late 1950s or early 1960s. His first child, a son, Andre, was born in 1911. The home he occupied in La Tour de Peilz was initially constructed as a vacation home. As his family grew, Edouard decided to build a second smaller house on the large property along Lake Geneva. The home was built for his mother Philippine Denereaz-Muller in 1928. It was called Villa La Basque. His mother had lived in Edouard's house during his absence. The new home had a room for laundry and garden tools and a garage, something lacking at his own home. At the same time, he added a winter garden called the Jardin d‚ÄôHiver to his home. Son Roland was born in Athens just before the family moved to Paris in 1918. He was born in a downstairs room facing the Place de le Constitution in the Hotel Grande Bretagne. That room was the hotel bar in 1937. Daughter Micheline was born March 9, 1926. Edouard lost his first wife Jeanne in 1929 after she succumbed to sepsis. Edouard married his second wife, Else Ellen Margery Hemmeler, in Zurich on October 7, 1930. He had met her during a business trip attending to the Galak Company. She was the daughter of the manager of the company. They had met in 1926 when she had brought a gift for the new daughter to the Muller house. They had seen each other at a New Year's celebration in 1928‚Äì1929 in the Netherlands. The courtship started in February 1930 with a box of chocolates and a request to be able to write the young college student studying in Berlin and completing her studies in Lausanne, Switzerland. Their honeymoon was a tour of Italy by car. Edouard and Ellen had their first daughter in December 1931. Their second was born on New Year's of January 1933. With these two additions, the attic of the home was expanded to make two bedrooms and a playroom. His home had a staff of five: cook, chauffeur, gardener, maid and governess. On March 21, 1943, Lieutenant Roland Muller, Edouard's second son, was killed during a Swiss military exercise. The family received news of the death with no explanation at first. It took three days to get more details about the tragedy, which was a tank accident in Curtilles with the ground concealed Roland, age 25. In 1947‚Äì1948, the Mullers added a large addition to their home including a two-car garage, a studio and office with a large bathroom and kitchenette with a large view of Lac Leman. The architect started work in 1947 after the family returned from Connecticut. They returned with two cars, a Pontiac and his wife's Cadillac. Edouard only smoked Havana cigars and kept them carefully in a humidor. He never smoked cigarettes. Edouard enjoyed good food and wines and liked to search out restaurants with specialties like crayfish soup, country ham, and wild berries and cream with meringues. He became a Chevalier of the Chevaliers du Taste-Vin in 1948. Boating and fishing were a favorite pastime. Edouard enjoyed fishing for lake perch which were fried and served. He organized long walks through the Swiss Alps with the associate expert mountaineer, Jean Fatton. Edouard had an automobile early after their first availability in Switzerland. However Edouard chose to never drive. He was always driven. His vehicles tend to be the very long and large automobiles with the rear for passengers separated by glass partition from the driver. He wore a driver's leather helmet. Edouard enjoyed good Swiss cheese and wines. The family cook who lived with them throughout his life, Therese, was an excellent chef. Edouard collected stamps with his second wife. It was a good portable hobby for when she traveled with him and friends and business associates from around the world traded stamps with them. Edouard enjoyed skiing and did so in Gstaad, Davos and Arosa. Edouard was an Abraham Lincoln buff. He read about him extensively. He was given statuary of the past president for his office and home. Nestl√© social works  Nestle donated funds to the Canton of Vaud for building the Nestle Hospital in Lausanne. The Pouponierre, a medical health facility for babies, was created as a charity organization with Muller and Dapples. It opened in September 1938.

The riots happened during a series of Catholic religious pilgrimages related to the Jubilee year declared by Pope Pius IX. The first riot occurred on September 22, during a pilgrims' march to the bishop's palace at St. Michael's Cathedral. The parade had been advertised in the Irish Canadian newspaper, which led a group of opponents to petition Mayor Francis Henry Medcalf to have the event banned. It proceeded, however, with a pledge from the Catholic clergy that is would remain \\"quiet, peaceful, and Christian\\".The Jubilee Riots in Toronto, 1875 by Martin Galvin. CCHA, Report, 26 (1959), 93-107. Stone throwing between pilgrims and onlookers started at Spadina Avenue and Queen Street and spread to several nearby streets. There were reports of shots being fired on Simcoe Street. The police attempted to separate the pilgrims and their attackers, but were briefly overwhelmed before charging the rioters with batons and seizing several firearms. Commentary following the riots was divided. Editorials in the Mail criticized those who attacked the pilgrims as having started the riot but questioned the wisdom and tact of the Catholic organizers of the parade for the route chosen and for advertising it in the Irish Canadian. The Globe defended the pilgrims as law- abiding. The Leader suggested that asking members of Catholic societies to line the streets to watch the parade was asking for trouble. The Toronto Orange Lodge demanded that similar future marches be suppressed. A tense public meeting was held where the city fathers implored the Catholics not to march again. A second riot broke out on October 3. Stone throwing began at McGill Square and was soon accompanied by pistol fire. This led to a full- pitched battle between pilgrims and anti-processionists, which spilled out into multiple locations. Many were hurt, with rioters being beaten back by police. Cavalry, under the command of the mayor himself, was brought up to defend the pilgrims. Following the second riot, the press roundly condemned the anti-processionists, and praised the authorities. They were especially keen to point out that while the mob may have been Protestant, the mayor and troops that had defended Catholics' right to worship were also largely Protestant. An offshoot of the Orange Order called the Young Britons was accused of incitement by witnesses and in editorials by the Toronto Globe.

The app is also associated with a now-discontinued music streaming service, Groove Music Pass which was supported across Windows, Xbox video game consoles, Windows Phone, as well as Android and iOS. As of 2014, The Groove catalogue had over 50 million tracks. Its subscription service Groove Music Pass was officially discontinued on December 31, 2017, and the Android and iOS versions of the Groove Music app were discontinued on December 2018, restricting the player to its native Microsoft Store base.  History  Microsoft had previously ventured into music services with its Zune brand. The Zune Music Marketplace included 11 million tracks. The line of Zune players and Zune music store were somewhat unsuccessful, and the brand was largely discontinued at the beginning of the 2010s, although it continued to exist on different devices and the Zune Music Pass offered unlimited access to songs for US$9.99 per month. During its E3 2012 press conference, and in the wake of the upcoming release of Windows 8. Microsoft announced the relaunch of the service as Xbox Music. With the accompanying announcement of Xbox Video, this move was intended to position Xbox as the company's main entertainment brand. Both services launched October 16, 2012. On July 6, 2015, Microsoft announced the re-branding of Xbox Music as Groove to tie in with the impending release of Windows 10. The new brand utilized the Microsoft-owned \\"Groove\\" trademark formerly used for the unrelated product Microsoft Office Groove (now OneDrive for Business). Joe Belfiore explained that the re-branding was intended to disassociate the service from the Xbox product line, making it more inclusive to non-Xbox platforms. On October 2, 2017, Microsoft announced that it would discontinue its subscription service Groove Music Pass and music purchases on Windows Store after December 31, 2017, leaving support for playing music stored locally and on OneDrive. At this time, Microsoft began advertising the competing service Spotify, displaying a banner ad for the service within the Groove Music user interface, and offering the ability to migrate music collections and playlists to the service. As a side effect of the discontinuation, Microsoft additionally announced on May 31, 2018 that the Groove Music apps for Android and iOS would also be discontinued and cease functioning on December 1, 2018, with users being redirected to Google Play Music and iTunes Match for similar cloud synchronization functionality (the OneDrive app still offers limited music playback functions within).  Groove Music Pass  Groove Music Pass (formerly Xbox Music Pass and Zune Music Pass) was a discontinued pay subscription service that allowed unlimited streaming of the service's catalog on any device with the service installed. The pricing in the U.S. included monthly and annual subscriptions. A one-month trial offer was available, but those who previously tried the Zune Music Pass subscription prior to the rebranding were ineligible for this offer. An advertising- supported streaming tier was previously available, but discontinued effective December 1, 2014. Music could also be purchased directly from Windows Store. Users' purchased music, and playlists consisting of songs available on the service could be synced through OneDrive and accessed from multiple devices. Songs in a user's local library on a Windows 8.1 PC could be matched and made available to other devices if available on Groove Music Pass. Custom \\"radio stations\\" could be generated using songs related to user-selected songs. Songs could be downloaded for offline listening on smartphones. Uploading of non- Groove music became available on Windows 10. Windows 10's Anniversary Update allowed users to hide features that require a Groove Music Pass from the interface. On October 2, 2017, Microsoft announced the discontinuation of the Groove Music Pass service effective December 31, 2017. Existing subscribers were refunded, and Microsoft began promoting Spotify as an alternative by allowing saved playlists to be migrated to the service.  Cloud Collection  Groove Music let users create a collection of songs and playlists that roam through the cloud on all the supported devices. The songs could be added from the Groove Music Store or matched (within the Groove Music Catalog) to songs either saved locally on the user's machine or uploaded to the user's OneDrive account for the country the user was in.

The 1874 Transit of Venus Expedition to Hawaii was an astronomical expedition by British scientists to observe the December 8 transit of Venus at three separate observing sites in the Hawaiian Islands, then known as the Sandwich Islands.Chauvin 2004; Lomb 2011, 132-134. It was one of five 1874 transit expeditions organized by George Biddell Airy, Astronomer Royal at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich. The purpose of the expedition was to obtain an accurate estimate of the astronomical unit (AU), the distance from the Earth to the Sun, by measuring solar parallax. Previous efforts to obtain a precise value of an AU in 1769 had been hampered by the black drop effect. There is a collection of papers relating to this expedition at the Cambridge Digital Library. Background George Biddell Airy began preparations for the expedition in 1869 and procured funds in June of that year. Airy spent 1870‚Äì71 acquiring the necessary supplies and equipment. He made George Lyon Tupman, a captain in the Royal Marine Artillery, the lead astronomer of the Sandwich Islands expedition (known as Station B) in April 1872 and Tupman was also given responsibility for overseeing the organisation of all five official British expeditions and training the 22 observers. Tupman's journals recording the pre-expedition work at Greenwich have been digitised. Team The Sandwich Islands team was composed of seven observers - Professor George Forbes, Henry Glanville Barnacle, John Walter Nichol, Lieutenant Francis Edward Ramsden, Lieutenant E. J. W. Noble, Captain George Lyon Tupman, and Richard Johnson - plus three Sappers of the Royal Engineers.Chauvin 2004, 42-49. In June 1874, the team left Liverpool in two groups carrying 93 tons of provisions on . They stopped along the way and met up in Valpara√≠so, Chile; they reached Honolulu Harbor on 9 September. The voyage out, and the rest of the expedition, were depicted in a series of caricature drawings by Lieutenant Noble, which have been digitised. The team manned observing stations on three different islands. The primary observing station was established by George Lyon Tupman on the island of Oahu in the Apua district of Honolulu. The site was atop the bell tower of Kawaiaha\`o Church. Nearby Ali\`iolani Hale, at that time the Hawaiian Kingdom's capitol building, was a second Oahu location atop the building's clock tower manned by an American observer. Two auxiliary stations were established, one in Waimea, Kauai, manned by Richard Johnson with assistance from Lieutenant R.H. Wellings of HMS Scout, and another in Kailua, Hawaii, manned by George Forbes and Henry Glanville Barnacle.\\"Science & Technology - The Key to Hawaii's Economic Future\\" State of Hawaii Department of Business, Economic Development & Tourism October 1998. As well as observing the transit on 8 December 1874, the observers undertook a large amount of work to establish the positions, particularly the longitudes, of the three observing sites. This information was fed into the Trigonometrical Survey of the Kingdom of Hawaii, then in progress and led by Professor William DeWitt Alexander. Tupman's journal of the Honolulu Station and Forbes's journal of the Kailua (Hawaii) Station have been digitised. Charles Darwin's son, Leonard Darwin, was a photographer on the 1874 Transit of Venus Expedition to New Zealand, after which he traveled to Hawaii aboard the Mikado to meet the team in Honolulu. Publications George Biddell Airy published an Account of Observations of the Transit of Venus in Hawaii in 1881, with more than 200 pages about the expedition.Airy, George Biddell, ed. 1881.

According to legend, Daochuo visited the temple of Tan-luan in 609 and read an epitaph on the wall that venerated Tanluan. Daochuo was so impressed by this inscription that he took up the pursuit of Pure Land Buddhism over his previous studies, including nianfo and daily recitation of the Infinite Life Sutra (). Among Daochuo's contributions to Pure Land Buddhism was his distinction that there existed two Paths in Buddhism: the holy path (monastic practices leading to the purification of the mind) and the pure land path (relying on AmitƒÅbha's grace). He also linked the Buddhist concept of the Three Ages of Buddhism with the salvation of AmitƒÅbha by teaching that AmitƒÅbha's compassion was particularly suited on those living in the current degenerate age.

It was edited from the pilot, \\"Solo\\", which was shot in colour, but was broadcast in black-and-white, to conform with the rest of the first season. It was first broadcast in the USA on NBC on September 22, 1964. The hero is Napoleon Solo and his antagonist is Andrew Vulcan, an evil scientist working with THRUSH. The episode was subsequently expanded with additional footage and released in colour as the feature-length movie, To Trap a Spy. Synopsis The episode opens with several THRUSH agents raiding the UNCLE headquarters via a covert entrance from the back of a common tailor shop in New York City. They are at first successful, until Napoleon Solo defeats them. A sequence in Solo shows the death of the captured agents due to THRUSH having them take a slow acting poison killing them regardless of the success or failure of their mission. The raid is discovered to be connected to a deceased UNCLE agent discovering THRUSH plans to assassinate an African political leader through Andrew Vulcan, a senior THRUSH operative who is a major American industrialist. By investigating Vulcan's past he locates a housewife who was a former university girlfriend of the reclusive Vulcan to aid him. They board an airplane and head to Washington D.C.. Once there, they go to a party hosted by Vulcan for the African leader and his two fellow diplomats. There, the housewife flirts with Vulcan to acquire information, and he invites her for a tour of his chemical plant. (He plans to give the African leader and his friends a tour the following day.) Seeing a good espionage chance, she agrees. She distracts Vulcan while Solo sneaks in the plant. Vulcan and his men find them out and pursue them through the plant. They get in a car, and find the African leader inside. In reality, he is complicit in the plan and working with Vulcan; he plans to kill his two friends with an explosion at the plant during their tour. They are captured, and almost killed, but Solo manages to free them and they rescue the two men. The leader and Vulcan are killed in the explosion. Production The episode was mostly shot in six days in late November 1963 but some additional footage was shot in three days in the following spring. The director was Don Medford with Maurice Vaccarino assisting and Henry Berman editing. The producer was Norman Felton who had conceived the original idea for the show and then developed it in consultation with the creator of James Bond ‚Äî Ian Fleming. Sam Rolfe was given the job of writing the detailed background for the series and wrote the script for this episode. The score was composed by Jerry Goldsmith including the catchy theme tune which was performed by The Gallants. Casting This first episode featured Napoleon Solo as the eponymous Man from U.N.C.L.E. as the series concept was to focus upon this individual agent as the hero. Robert Vaughn was cast in this role to give the character an urbane, sophisticated style similar to Cary Grant's role in Notorious. The Russian agent, Illya Kuryakin, only had four lines in this episode as the role had yet to attract the attention which it subsequently achieved due to the casting of blond actor David McCallum, who was a great favourite of female fans. The other main regular character appearing was the leader of U.N.C.L.E., Alexander Waverly. He was played by Leo G. Carroll who was cast because he had played a similar avuncular role in North by Northwest. This was however a late change as, in the pilot, the leadership role was Mr Allison, played by Will Kuluva. He was removed from the show after an NBC executive ordered that the character whose name started with \\"K\\" should go. He had meant Kuryakin but it was Kuluva that went and the role was reshot with Carroll in the part. The standard front for U.N.C.L.E. in New York was a tailor's shop. In this first episode, the part of the tailor, Del Floria, was played by Mario Siletti. Each episode was expected to include an innocent character caught up in the action, as Cary Grant was in North by Northwest. Patricia Crowley played this role well in this episode as housewife Elaine May Bender Donaldson. She had previously played opposite Robert Vaughn, as his wife in The Lieutenant, and was cast by Norman Felton. Janice Rule was originally considered but rejected due to both Vaughn and Rule preferring to be photographed from the left side.Vaughn, Robert A Fortunate Life: An Autobiography JR Books Limited, January 1, 2009 Crowley played the part gamely, having to hang from steam pipes in one scene. The other major guest star was Fritz Weaver who played the villain Andrew Vulcan. The episode featured William Marshall, Ivan Dixon and Rupert Crosse as three diplomats from a newly independent African nation seeking industrial assistance from the West.

Dowse House, more commonly known as the Dowse Sod House, is a sod house in Custer County in the central portion of the state of Nebraska, in the Great Plains region of the United States. It was built in 1900 and occupied until 1959. After a long period of neglect, it was restored beginning in about 1981, and opened as a museum in 1982. The house is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, as \\"an excellent example of the sod house phenomenon\\", and as one of the few surviving sod houses in Nebraska. Sod houses on the Great Plains The Homestead Act of 1862 was a major factor in opening the Great Plains to white settlement. Under the provisions of the Act, settlers could obtain title to a quarter-section (160 acres, or ) of land for a nominal fee, provided that they built a house, made certain improvements, farmed the land, and occupied the site for at least five years. Settlers in the regions east of the Missouri River had found ample trees with which to build log houses. The eastern quarter of Nebraska was also well supplied with timber. However, as settlers moved further west, they encountered the treelessness that had led Major Stephen H. Long, exploring the region in 1820, to label it the \\"Great American Desert\\". Especially before the arrival of the railroad, the cost of importing building materials was prohibitive; and many homesteaders had spent all that they had on farming equipment, and could barely afford the filing fees for their land claims. There is no consensus among scholars regarding the origin of sod construction on the Plains. Some maintain that the inspiration came from the earth lodges of the local native peoples, including the Omahas and the Pawnees. However, these earth lodges were circular in cross-section, and built upon heavy timber frameworks. It has also been suggested that the idea of building with sod came from European immigrants, either Russian-Germans, who are known to have built rammed earth dwellings in the Plains, or immigrants from the British Isles, particularly from Ireland, where turf houses were built with stone foundations and frames to support the turf. None of these closely resembled the unframed sod-block houses built in the Midwestern United States, but they might have engendered the idea of building with earth. A simple sod house could be built in about a week, and for a cost of less than five dollars. Cost was not the only advantage. The thick walls provided insulation against summer heat and winter cold; the latter was particularly important in light of the dearth of firewood on the plains, which forced the early settlers to burn corncobs, twisted grass, or dried buffalo dung. The walls also withstood prairie winds better than framed walls; even sod houses struck by tornadoes generally survived with no worse damage than the loss of the roof, leaving the walls standing. Sod houses also provided a safe refuge against prairie fires, especially when surrounded by a plowed and back-burned firebreak. South-facing kitchen window. Note thickness of wall and beveling of window well. The sod house was not without its disadvantages, however. Initially, at least, most had dirt floors, which had to be sprinkled with water to abate dust. To protect against invasion by rodents, insects, and snakes, the interior walls were often shaved smooth and plastered with lime, or with a mixture of local clay and sand or ashes; the lower portions of the exterior walls could also be reinforced, with planks or concrete if they were available, or with a second layer of sod to thicken them. Leaky roofs were also a problem; to protect the inhabitants and the interior furnishings from falling water, dirt, and vermin, it was common to make a ceiling of a white muslin sheet tacked to the walls. Since windows were one of the most expensive elements of a sod house, pioneers on a budget were often forced to make do with windows that were small and few in number; a light muslin ceiling and plastered walls helped to illuminate the house by reflecting daylight through the interior. Sod houses continued to be occupied and built even after wood for construction became available. A number of contemporary photographs show occupied sod houses adjacent to frame barns and outbuildings. The Dowse house was built in 1900, although the Burlington and Missouri River Railroad had reached the nearby town of Comstock in 1899, and a lumber company was available there. During the Great Depression of the 1930s, several Custer County farmers who had lost their homes relocated to vacant land and built sod houses there. As late as 1940, a sod house was built near Dunning, Nebraska. The sod houses of Custer County are particularly well documented, owing to the efforts of Solomon Butcher. An itinerant photographer, Butcher conceived the idea of creating a photographic history of pioneer life in Nebraska. Between 1886 and 1912, he produced nearly 3,500 glass plate negatives; over 1,800 of these were taken in Custer County, and over 1,500 show sod houses. Butcher's photographs are now owned by the Nebraska State Historical Society. Sod construction In constructing a sod house, a site had to be chosen that was close to good sources of sod. All prairie grasses were not alike for purposes of construction sod; the best were those with a strong and dense root network to hold the blocks together. Preferred species included buffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides), slough grass (Spartina pectinata), and big bluestem (Andropogon gerardi). At the house site, the grass was removed. Often, the soil was excavated one to two feet () below ground level; this reduced the height of the walls, and thus the amount of sod that had to be cut. The ground that would form the house floor was moistened and then tamped with a fencepost to flatten and harden it. Footings were rarely laid, due to the cost or unavailability of material. Sod blocks in upper portion of north wall of Dowse house. Before the sod blocks were cut, the grass was mown short or burned off. At times, the surface was scored with a cutter or disc; the blocks could then be removed with a spade. This approach, however, tended to produce rough and non-uniform blocks, which complicated the task of laying them in even courses. Blocks could also be cut with a plow. An ordinary plow could be used, given considerable skill and care on the part of the operator; however, the mouldboard tended to turn over and break up the blocks; even if intact blocks were produced, they were generally not of uniform thickness. In the late 19th century, a modified plow designed specifically for sod cutting was invented: this \\"grasshopper plow\\" replaced the mouldboard with a set of adjustable rods, which allowed the operator to cut a uniform strip of sod three to six inches () deep and wide. This strip could then be cut into blocks. The dimensions of these depended, among other things, on the strength of the builder--the blocks were dense, and had to be sized so that the builders could lift them. Typical blocks cut with a grasshopper plow might measure four inches () deep by wide by long. In building the walls, the sod blocks were laid one course at a time; each course was completed before the next was begun. Walls were generally two or three wythes thick; the vertical joints were staggered to avoid creating a direct path through the wall for wind and vermin. To bind the wythes and increase the stability of the wall, every second, third, or fourth course was laid crosswise. Early sod houses were roofed with sod. The weight of the roof helped to keep it from blowing away in strong winds, and the insulating power of such a roof helped to moderate temperatures within the house. However, the sod roof's weight also posed the risk of collapse if there was insufficient wood support for it, and sod roofs tended to drip water, mud, and insects. In later sod houses, for which the material was more readily available, roofs were shingled or covered with tarpaper, boards, or metal. Monument at Lewis Dowse homestead site. History The first homestead established in Custer County was that of Lewis R. and Sarah M. Dowse, who in August 1873 occupied a site on the Middle Loup River. Lewis Dowse was born in 1845 in Sherborn, Massachusetts. After service in the Civil War, he moved to Iowa in 1868. In the following year, he married Sarah Wagner, who was born in 1854 in Auglaize County, Ohio. In 1871, their oldest child, William R. Dowse, was born. The family moved to Nebraska in 1873, accompanied by Sarah Dowse's parents; the latter remained in Loup City while their daughter and son-in-law established their homestead, then moved to Custer County in 1874. The Dowses initially occupied a dugout on their claim; in 1874, they built a slab house, using material brought from Loup City. There, they raised nine children, including an adopted daughter. Building the house In October 1900, William Dowse married 18-year-old Florence Murphy, daughter of John and Leah Thrist Murphy. At the beginning of that year, he was living in a dugout just south of his parents‚Äô farm; by April 1900, a sod house was under construction, to be occupied by the couple. John Murphy was an experienced builder of sod houses, and the William Dowse house was built with his aid and that of neighbors and friends. The new house was located northwest of the homestead of the senior Dowses. William Dowse did not homestead the site. The property was originally acquired in 1884 by Kate Prescott, under the provisions of the Timber Culture Act of 1873; it is not known whether Prescott had built a dwelling on the parcel. The blocks for the house were cut from bluestem sod, probably obtained from a site very close to the house. The grass was mown to a height of 1/4 inch (); the blocks were then cut with a grasshopper plow, to dimensions of about long by wide by thick. Blocks were laid with the grass side down, in a one-course common bond; the walls were battered, measuring thick at ground level and thick at the top. Restored parlor-dining room. The window at right faces south. The plan of the house was L-shaped, with stems projecting to the east and to the south. It occupied a rectangle measuring 29 feet by 31 feet 3 inches ( by ); each stem of the L was approximately wide. The single-story house was topped with a steeply-pitched wood-shingled hip roof. The interior was divided by wood partition walls into three rooms. A small bedroom occupied the northwest corner, at the angle of the L. The eastward projection contained a large kitchen and hall; the southward projection, a somewhat smaller parlor and dining room. A steep stairway led up to an unfinished attic. The floors were packed dirt; the ceiling was muslin tacked beneath boards. The interior of the sod walls was plastered with a mixture of clay, straw, and hog hair. Two east-facing doors led into the house. One, at the end of the eastern projection of the L, led into the kitchen-hall. A second, on the east side of the southern projection, led from the space enclosed by the arms of the L into the parlor-dining room. Two windows faced northward: one from the kitchen- hall, one from the bedroom. Two more faced southward: one from the kitchen- hall and one from the parlor-dining room. A single window faced eastward from the kitchen-hall. Windows were flush with the exterior walls of the house. The window wells were beveled, widening toward the interior of the house; this admitted more light to the house. The configuration of the west wall is not known, since the wall was removed in 1924. North wall of house, with concrete coating on lower portion and exposed sod blocks visible under eaves. Living in the house William and Florence Dowse raised five sons, born between 1905 and 1919: Harold, William Jr., Philip, Curtis, and Kermit. After occupying a crib in his parents' bedroom, each son moved up to the attic room, where they slept on straw ticks. As the family expanded, the house was enlarged and improved. In 1915, the muslin ceiling was replaced with plaster. Two years later, wood tongue-and-groove flooring was installed. In 1924, two additions were made. The space between the two arms of the L was framed in and covered with a shed roof; the resulting southeast corner room was left unfinished and used as a laundry room. The west sod wall of the house was removed completely, and a second shed-roofed addition constructed to extend the house to the west. Both additions were clad in wooden shingles. William Dowse, Jr. and his wife Inez occupied the western addition. At some point, the house was wired for electricity. Plumbing was never installed. The last major alteration to the house took place in 1935, when it was realized that the projection of the eaves was not sufficient to protect the house's walls from erosion. At that time, concrete was applied to the lower portion of the exterior sod walls: boards were placed against the wall and concrete poured into the space between board and wall, then allowed to dry before the boards were raised and the process repeated. The durability of the house was tested in the early 1940s, when a tornado struck the farmstead. All of the farm's outbuildings were destroyed; but the house escaped undamaged, apart from a sawhorse blown through one of the windows. William Dowse lived in the house until his death in 1951. Florence Dowse remained for another two years before moving to Comstock; she died in 1969. The final occupants of the house were the family of William Dowse, Jr., who remained there until 1959, the year before his death. Restored kitchen. Camera is facing northwest. Restoring the house After the departure of the last occupants, the house stood neglected for over two decades. Fire damaged the roof and shingles were blown off, allowing leakage; all of the windows and doors were broken or destroyed. With nothing to bar their entrance, cattle passed through the house, leaving a foot (30 cm) of manure on the floors. In about 1981, descendants of William and Florence Dowse decided to restore the house. The project was spearheaded by two of the Dowse sons, Philip and Curtis, and supported by the Comstock Community Club. In the course of several years, over $6,000 was raised for the project. A fence was built to exclude cattle from the house. The roof was repaired and reshingled. The exterior walls were reinforced and repaired with new sod blocks, cut with a horse-drawn plow about from the house; additional concrete coating was applied in places. The porch walls were re-shingled, and doors and windows were replaced. Inside the house, the manure covering the floors was removed, and the wood flooring repaired; the plaster on the walls was patched or replaced, up to 20 layers of old wallpaper was removed, and new wallpaper applied in places. Pioneer-era interior furnishings such as a cast-iron stove were installed. In May 1982, the house was opened as a museum. In 1986, the house was listed in the National Register of Historic Places, under the name \\"William R. Dowse House\\". In the form nominating it for the register, it was described as \\"an excellent example of the sod house phenomenon\\", and as one of the few surviving sod houses in the state. For their efforts in restoring the house and opening it to the public, Philip and Curtis Dowse received the Nebraska State Historical Society's Nebraska Preservation Award in 1990. In the 21st century, the Dowse Sod House is promoted as a tourist destination by the village of Comstock and by the Nebraska Division of Travel and Tourism.

Sources differ on the date of the house's last occupancy: some give the date as 1959, others as 1965. The earlier date appears to be more accurate. The source cited for it, a hand-lettered sign in the house, was presumably made by a member of the family with access to the family's records. Moreover, several of the sources that give the later date also state that William Dowse, Jr. was the last occupant (e.g. Howard, 1983); it is difficult to reconcile this with the 1960 death date on his tombstone (see photo). \\"Dowse Sod House\\".

It was developed by SCE London Studio in conjunction with J. K. Rowling and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment as a companion to the Harry Potter series. The game is based on Book of Spells, a fictional book by Miranda Goshawk released about 200 years from the event date. Book of Spells received mostly positive reviews from critics, praising the use of augmented reality and the PlayStation Move, while criticizing the game's short length. Gameplay The user casts spells by drawing shapes with the PlayStation Move controller, while the book itself uses augmented reality technology to appear on screen via the PlayStation Eye. The Move controller itself appears on screen as a wand, and may draw patterns on screen to launch spells. Book of Spells is designed to be an interpretation of learning spells at Hogwarts School in the Harry Potter universe, with the \\"book\\" itself having been written in the Harry Potter universe over 200 years ago by Miranda Goshawk. At the end of each chapter, a poem will describe a failed Hogwarts student in order to teach the user a lesson in the manner of Aesop's fables. At the start of the game, players choose one of the four Hogwarts houses, and one of three different wands. If, however, the player has a Pottermore account, they can link it to the game, in which case the in-game choices will reflect those they made on the site. In addition to the specific spells covered by each chapter, the player is sometimes given the opportunity to briefly make use of other spells, such as the Oppugno Jinx. The player, however, does not actually learn the gestures for these spells and thus is not tested over this material. Development Promotion at IgroMir 2012 To develop the game the Sony Computer Entertainment team worked with Harry Potter author J. K. Rowling, who described it as \\"the closest a Muggle can come to a real spellbook\\". Rowling had previously worked with Sony on her Pottermore website, and the company at one point had an exclusive contract to release Harry Potter e-books. The game was launched as the first title for the Wonderbook on the PlayStation 3 at the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released in the United States on 13 November, 15 November in Australia, and 16 November in Europe. Reception Book of Spells received mixed to positive reviews from game critics. It holds a 72 on Metacritic, indicating \\"Mixed or Average reviews.\\" Critics praised the use of the Wonderbook technology by the use of both the PlayStation Move and augmented reality, while criticizing the game's short replay value. The Book of Spells was nominated for a BATA in the ‚ÄòGame Innovation 2013‚Ä≤ category. Sequel The second Harry Potter-themed Wonderbook game is Book of Potions, released in 2013.

It is widespread across the continent, commonly found in open, sandy, desert habitats. It is a popular pet and can often be found in zoos. Description Central netted dragon The central netted dragon is a medium-sized terrestrial lizard with a pale reddish-brown to bright orange-brown body. It gets its name from the dark-chocolate brown, reticulated (net-like) pattern which overlays its head and body.Shannon Plumber. \\"CentralNettedDragon.com - About \\". Retrieved 2012-06-05 This pattern acts as camouflage, helping the lizard to blend in with its habitat to avoid predators.Horner, P. & Hutchinson, M. 2010. \\"Ctenophorus nuchalis- IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Version 2011.2.\\". Retrieved 2012-06-05 Its limbs are short and strong, with long toes and strong claws, which allow it to run at great speeds and dig burrows. The head is short and blunt in comparison to other iguanids and agamids, thought to be related to its herbivorous and burrowing behaviour. The ears are exposed, and a row of enlarged scales curves under each eye. Small spines surround the head. It has a low crest along the top of the neck, a narrow vertebral stripe along the length of the body, and the scales of the body are small and smooth to the touch. Adult males measure around 25‚Äì28 cm from snout to tail, with about 10 cm being snout-to-vent length, and the tail making up the remainder of the length. They are sexually dimorphic, with males being slightly larger overall and having a larger head in relation to their bodies compared to females. This dragon is relatively short- lived in the wild, perhaps living 2-4 yr. Taxonomy Charles Walter De Vis first identified Ctenophorus nuchalis in 1884. The Ctenophorus (comb- bearing dragons) genus contains the most diverse group of dragons in Australia. Many of these have been grouped by a similar morphology. Several synonyms exist for this species: *Amphibolurus inermis (De Vis, 1888) *Amphibolurus nuchalis (De Vis, 1884) *Amphibolurus reticulatus (Sternfeld, 1919) *Grammatophora inermis (De Vis, 1888) *Macrops nuchalis (De Vis, 1884) Distribution Central netted dragons are found throughout the desert plains of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Western Queensland and New South Wales. They are abundant in open, sandy areas with sparse vegetation, and surveys have found this species increases in abundance in grazed areas and likewise may increase in cleared or burnt areas. Ecology and habitat Example of habitat of the central netted dragon Central netted dragons are burrowing, diurnal (day-active), and terrestrial (ground-dwelling), spending their days basking on logs, stones and termite mounds. Like the majority of reptiles, they are ectotherms, relying on their environment to regulate their body temperature (that averages 36.1 ¬∞C). A dragon's day will start with basking in the sun to raise its body temperature to gain energy. Without adequate body heat, these lizards cannot digest their food. When the desert temperature peaks in the middle of the day, they will either retreat to their burrows to cool down, or climb plants to escape the extreme heat. They are known to have several burrows, typically six to eight, often constructed at the base of stumps of living spinifex (Triodia) grasses, or within hillocks such as those formed by dead grass hummocks. These tend to be relatively shallow, dead-end burrows in different parts of their home range, and are used primarily as nocturnal retreats and for predator escape. They will often back- fill the entrance to this burrow to prevent entry by predators, and to keep the heat out. They prefer perches with high vantage points, such as termite mounds (which also serve as a source of food for this insectivore), dirt hills, logs, and fence posts. Vegetation cover is an important part of the ecology of the central netted dragon. The species predominates in areas of low vegetation, for example, following a period of drought when Spinifex has died back and ground cover is sparse (<10%). As with many of the dragon species, central netted dragons will communicate with other members of their species by bobbing their heads and waving their legs. Males can be quite territorial, and will use these display signs to intimidate rival males, in an attempt to ward off any potential takeover bids. Reproduction Central netted dragons are oviparous, meaning they lay eggs rather than give birth to live offspring. Females are known to lay two or three clutches of two to six eggs, typically during spring and summer depending on the location and conditions. During the breeding season, male dragons actively defend territories and often fight with other males for dominance. They have annual lifecycles, with adults predominating during the breeding season and juveniles predominating in other seasons. Juveniles typically attain sexual maturity after winter at 5-6 mo of age. The timing of reproduction is dictated primarily by rainfall, with breeding occurring predictably after winter rains in the southern part of its range, and in late summer following cyclonic rains in the Pilbara region further north. It may also breed in spring in the latter region, but only if winter rain has been substantial. Rainfall appears to be tied to enhanced survival, growth, and possibly clutch size and hatching success. Diet Perched on a termite mound Central netted dragons have varied diets, consuming mostly insects, but also flowers and other vegetation. They actively hunt, but more often wait for an insect to pass by before striking. In the wild, this dragon's diet consists of 75% insect prey and 25% vegetation, including hogweed (Zaleya galericulata) and small flowers, such as aster, daisy and dandelion. It is one of the most herbivorous of Australian desert lizards. Its diet overlaps broadly with that of many other lizards, and it frequently occurs in sympatry with up to 20-30 other reptilian species. Much of its preferred insect prey are primarily found in microhabitats and on bare sand, a large reason why the success of this species relies on low vegetative ground cover. Predators Predators of the central netted dragon include larger reptiles, such as goannas and snakes, and birds of prey, as well as the red fox and cats. Burrows act as the primary mechanism of escape, but may facilitate some predators, such as snakes and digging lizards, since burrows are usually simple dead ends. Threats This species is tolerant of habitat degradation caused by grazing and is under no major threats at this time.

He also was a member of the Toronto Argonauts in the Canadian Football League. He was drafted by the Chicago Bears in the third round of the 1951 NFL Draft. He played college football at Arizona State University and became the school's first College Football All-American. Early life White was born in Mesa, Arizona. He attended Mesa High School, where he was a multi-sport athlete and a stand-out in track and field. In football, he received first- team All-State honors as a junior and senior. He led his school to the state title in his final season, while rushing for 181 yards per game, which was a state record that lasted 46 years. He was known as \\"The Mesa Meteor\\" and \\"The Wizard of the Harmonica\\", until receiving the nickname \\"Whizzer\\" by the media. College career White accepted a football scholarship from Arizona State University, leading the team in rushing from 1947 to 1950, with a total of 3,173 yards. In 1950, he had a season for the ages, his 1,502 yards rushing total (150.2 yards per game) led the nation and still ranks second in school history for a season. He also scored 22 touchdowns and 136 points, which ranked third in the nation and still are school single-season records. At that time, he was only the second player in college football history to run for so many yards in a season, thus becoming the first football player from Arizona State University to be named All-American. In 1951 White participated in the College All-Star Game and the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game. To this day, he is considered one of the greatest running backs in school history, with many of his records still standing. He also practiced basketball and the decathlon, where he finished fifth and sixth nationally as a junior and senior behind Olympian Bob Mathias. He was inducted into the Arizona State University Athletics Hall of Fame, the Sun Devil Ring of Honor and had his jersey number retired (33). Professional career White was selected by the Chicago Bears in the third round (36th overall) of the 1951 NFL Draft and played two seasons in the NFL, until suffering a knee injury. Perhaps White's most famous play that he made was when, as quarterback, White ran backwards over 48 yards when being pursued by Los Angeles Rams defenders. White ended up fumbling the ball at the 1 yard line, and a Rams defender recovered it and ran it in for a touchdown. In the NFL Films video, 100 Greatest Follies, where White's play was named the #3 greatest folly of all time, White's son, Danny White, said that he never even saw the play for years, until NFL Films showed it to him. Danny joked that White was probably so embarrassed that he obtained every possible copy of the play's film so that nobody would see it. Personal life As noted above, White was the father of Danny White, a former Pro Bowl quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. His grandson Max Hall also played quarterback in the NFL. On August 1, 2013, he died en route to a Phoenix-area hospital of a heart attack.

Its origins were influenced by tech house and electro. The term has been used to describe the music of many DJ Mag Top 100 DJs, including Benny Benassi, Daft Punk, Skrillex, and Steve Aoki. Characteristics Electro-house is typified by its heavy bass. This is often in the form of buzzing basslines, such as those created with sawtooth waves and distortion. It is also often in the form of large bass drum sounds in a four-on-the-floor pattern. The tempo of electro house is usually between 125 and 135 beats per minute. Electro house sometimes resembles tech house, but it can contain melodic elements and electro-influenced samples and synths. History In his book on Rave music and Dance culture, Simon Reynolds asked friend DJ Josiah Schirrmacher described electro house, a style as provided by artists like Zedd, Erol Alkan and Bloody Beetroots as being called electro house despite it having \\"little relationship with either house or electro\\". Reynolds described the sound as being influenced by Discovery by Daft Punk as well as music by Justice and Digitalism. The sound was popuarlized in the United States by deadmau5 and noted the style's distinct style had a 'dirty bass' with \\"grinding and whirring sawtooth b-lines\\". More recently, the word \\"electro\\" has been seen as an adjective that denotes \\"hard electronic dance music\\". Early songs that have been labelled retroactively as electro house include \\"Dark Invader\\" by Arrivers in 1996 and \\"Raw S*it\\" by Basement Jaxx in 1997. Mr. Oizo's 1999 hit \\"Flat Beat\\" has also been considered an early example of the genre. Italian DJ Benny Benassi, with his track \\"Satisfaction\\" released in 2002, is seen as the forerunner of electro house who brought it to the mainstream. By the mid 2000s, electro house saw an increase in popularity. In November 2006, electro house tracks \\"Put Your Hands Up For Detroit\\" by Fedde Le Grand and the D. Ramirez remix of \\"Yeah Yeah\\" by Bodyrox and Luciana held the number one and number two spots, respectively, in the UK Top 40 singles charts. Since then, electro house producers such as Feed Me, Knife Party, The M Machine, Porter Robinson, Yasutaka Nakata (English translation) and Dada Life have emerged. Subgenres=Big room In the early 2010s, a type of electro house known as \\"big room\\" began to develop, particularly gaining popularity through EDM-oriented events and festivals such as Tomorrowland. Big room then began to subside from the classification of a subgenre of electro house and develop more as its own genre. Big room songs resemble Dutch house, often incorporating drops, minimalist percussion, regular beats, sub-bass layered kicks, simple melodies and synth-driven breakdowns. The layout of a big room track is very similar to the layout of a typical electro house song. Big room is thought of as a subgenre of electro house. Complextro Complextro is typified by glitchy, intricate basslines and textures created by sharply cutting between instruments in quick succession. The term, a portmanteau of the words \\"complex\\" and \\"electro\\", was coined by Porter Robinson to describe the sound of the music he was making in 2010. He has cited video game sounds, or chiptunes, as an influence on his style of music along with 1980s analog synth music. Other producers of the genre include Adventure Club, Kill The Noise, Knife Party, Lazy Rich, The M Machine, Madeon, Mord Fustang, Savant, Virtual Riot and Wolfgang Gartner. Dutch house Dutch house, sometimes referred to as 'Dirty Dutch', is a style of electro house that originated in the Netherlands and found prominence by 2009, mainly pioneered by Vato Gonzalez and DJ Chuckie. It is primarily defined by complex rhythms made from Latin-influenced drum kits, a lower emphasis on basslines and squeaky, high-pitched lead synths. Influences on the subgenre include Detroit techno, hip hop and other urban styles of music. Fidget house Fidget house, or fidget, is \\"defined by snatched vocal snippets, pitch-bent dirty basslines and rave-style synth stabs over glitchy 4/4 beats.\\" It contains influences from Chicago house, Detroit techno, Baltimore club, Kuduro, Pimba and hip hop. Purveyors of the genre include The Bloody Beetroots, AC Slater, Danger, Herv√©, Sinden, Jack Beats and Switch. The term fidget house was coined by DJs/producers Jesse Rose and Switch, \\"as a joke, which has now gone a little too far.\\" Jungle terror Jungle terror is a music genre that developed in the 2010s. It is often described as a \\"chaotic\\" mix of house with grime and drum 'n' bass rhythms. There are also animal noises as well as vocal cuts and percussions. The Dutch DJ and music producer Wiwek is named as the founder of the genre, who made the style popular in the EDM scene between 2013 and 2016. Meanwhile, musicians such as Skrillex, Diplo and KURA are also associated with the genre. Melbourne bounce Melbourne bounce is a subgenre of electro house characterized by the progression from the uptempo, horn-infused Dutch house style, tech trance synths, electro house stabs, and scouse House-influenced bass lines from around 128 up to 150 bpm. The term has been used to describe the music of DJ/Producers, including Deorro, Joel Fletcher, Will Sparks, SCNDL, Reece Low, VINAI, and TJR. The genre is generally characterized by a standard 128 bpm. It is composed of bouncy offbeat bass, whiny vocal cut/saw lead, raucous horns, 8-bar snare fills before the drop. It often features a repetitive beat structure with some amount of build-ups and mild drops throughout. It started as a cross between elements of m√°kina, acid house, acid techno, psytrance, and underground Melbourne House/minimal style. Melbourne Bounce has gained mainstream popularity around mid to late 2012 and had a steady rise from 2013. In 2014, productions of pioneers like Joey Fletcher, Will Sparks, and Uberjak‚Äôd were in huge demand and their songs were not only being played on Aussie commercial radio, but also spreading to worldwide and influencing international EDM style with Steve Aoki, TJR, and more. Further development=Moombahton Moombahton came as a mixture of slowed-down Dutch house and reggaeton. Its identifying characteristics include \\"a thick, spread-out bass line; some dramatic builds; and a two-step pulse, with quick drum fills\\", but it has \\"no real rules beyond working within a 108 bpm range.\\" A portmanteau of \\"moombah\\" and \\"reggaeton\\", moombahton was created by DJ Dave Nada when he slowed down the tempo of the Afrojack remix of the Silvio Ecomo & Chuckie song \\"Moombah\\" to please party-goers with tastes in reggaeton. Other producers of the genre include Dillon Francis, Diplo and Munchi. Moombahcore is a style of moombahton with elements of breakcore, dubstep, techstep and newstyle hardcore. Characteristics of the genre include chopped vocals, dubstep-influenced bass sounds and extensive build-ups. Artists who have produced moombahcore include Delta Heavy, Dillon Francis, Feed Me, Knife Party and Noisia.

Biography A sketch of Kaufman, circa 1906 Kaufman, born on September 25, 1888 in North Dakota, was a heavyweight boxer and one of the \\"White Hopes\\" of the era when Jack Johnson, an African American, was the world heavyweight champion. The 6‚Ä≤1‚Ä≥ Kaufman, a German-American, fought out of his hometown of San Francisco, California at a weight of between 185 and 205 lbs. in a career that stretched from 1905 to 1915. He was a muscular boxer, who fought cautiously but who could punch hard. Kaufman fought Johnson for the world heavyweight title. Before that bout, Johnson had attended a match between Kaufman and Tony Ross held at the Fairmont Athletic Club in The Bronx on April 13, 1909. Kaufman, who was being touted as a contender for Johnson's title. won a newspaper decision in the 10-round bout. It was reported that Johnson, at ringside, laughed at the two boxers. Five months later, on the 9th of September, Kaufman met Johnson at the San Francisco's Mission Street Arena in a championship fight. The Associated Press reported that Johnson landed his punches at will and could have ended the fight at any time during its 10 rounds. The fight went the distance and Johnson won a newspaper decision. Kaufman only landed two effective punches during the fight. Two years later, on 28 December 1911, Kaufman was K.O.ed in the fifth round of scheduled 10-rounder in Brooklyn by Al Palzer, the winner of a \\"White Hope\\" elimination tournament who would later fight for the World White Heavyweight Championship against Luther McCarty. McCarty, in turn, beat Kaufman on 12 October 1912 via a T.K.O. in the second round of a scheduled 20-round bout in San Francisco. McCarthy had floored Kaufman three times with rights to the chin, sending him through the ropes into the lap of a journalist who helped him into the ring. The fight was stopped by the San Francisco chief of police. Six months later, Kaufman served as the sparring partner for McCarty, who had won the World Heavyweight title from Palzer on New Year's Day. On 16 May 1913, fighting on the undercard in Philadelphia (McCarty beat Fireman Jim Flynn in the main event, Kaufman won his last fight when he scored a T.K.O. over Al Benedict in the fourth round of a six-rounder. After a 15-month layoff, he fought and lost twice in 1914 and scored a no decision in his last pro fight on New Year's Day 1915. Kaufman finished his career with an official record of 22 wins (17 via K.O.) against seven losses (having been K.O.ed five times). In addition, he won five newspaper decisions and lost one.

It is a protected area within the Porcupine Gorge National Park. Access to the gorge and national park is via the Kennedy Development Road. The sandstone gorge has incised up to 40 m below the adjacent plateau surface. In winter the base of the gorge is a series of waterholes while in the wet season it becomes a raging cascade which has excavated a deep chasm. There is an annual race held in the gorge called the Porcupine Gorge Challenge. It starts at the bottom of the gorge at The Pyramid. The gorge is a natural attraction for a diverse array of birdlife.  Stratigraphy = Betts Creek Beds  The Betts Creek Beds are located at the far end of the study area and are quite a small unit. The lower section is primarily interbedded siltstone and mudstone with coal seams formed within these layers. The coal itself is sub-bituminous and has well defined cleats with an overall waxy texture. Above these are larger mudstone beds which have well preserved fossil leaves of Glossopteris fauna, this is a clear Permian indicator and gives a good indication of the source of organic matter needed for coal formation. Above these are sandstone beds with very clear channelization, the layers also have well defined load structures. Then proceeding upwards, the rest of the Betts Creek Beds is dominated by coarser grained sandstone with intermittent mudstone beds every few meters. A normal fault cuts through the sandstone units and releases hydrothermal fluids, the way this is seen is that the sandstone present in the hanging wall is much whiter than the sandstone present in the footwall. The reasoning for this is that when the spring created by the fault released hydrothermal fluids into the system, the oxidizing iron(II) in the sandstone was leached into the fluid and transported elsewhere. On the footwall the iron(II) has not been transported away during the fault release. The fault has also produced a fault breccia culminating in downstream accretion with large clasts, indicating a high flow regime at the time of faulting. From the lithology and structures present the system is thought to have originally begun as a swamp area with plenty of Glossopteris dying and producing an anaerobic system to produce the kerogen necessary. After time progresses, the system is flooded with sand moving with flooding waters. From this we know that the swamp area was close to the coastline, and then due to sea level rise in the area, flooded over burying the kerogen. The fluvial channelization continued for some time, and created a larger channel, originally thought to be a boudin. This is disproved however by channelization in the upper parts of the formation. At periods of higher sea level herein, the sandstone was covered by muddy shales and these layers are distinguishable due to the fact that they are able to grow trees. Once the normal faulting has occurred, the kerogen becomes cracked, allowing coalification to take place. Pyrite present in the system would be removed from the beds and transported by the hydrothermal fluids as the iron(II) cation with dissolved sulfur in solution. This is the source of iron in the hydrothermal fluid.  Warang Sandstone  The Warang Sandstone is a litharenite sandstone unit within the gorge consisting of Early to Mid- Triassic fluvial channel deposits. One of the most interesting parts of the formation occurs at the contact between the Warang Sandstone and Betts Creek Beds. In this area the sandstone has been fractured by a strike-slip fault system that has encouraged the release of the underlying hydrothermal fluids sourced from the Betts Creek Beds. Due to the leaching that has happened of the sandstone units below, the iron(II) must accrete somewhere, and this has happened along the faults, creating very dense, ferric build up in the sandstone pores. Moving upwards from where the shearing outcrops, the destination of the fluids becomes apparent in an area that initially appears to have been folded however this is not the case at all. As the sandstone becomes fractured, it gets broken into segments, a sort of sedimentary box. These begin to trap the hydrothermal fluids, most especially the ferric components and the remaining solution escapes as water. The resulting ‚Äúfolded‚Äù pattern is in fact a boxwork concretion, and shows how the fluid has arrived at that point. From this point upwards, the more distinct fluvial channels are present in abundance. These are primarily fine grained sandstone with infill of more coarse grained material. Interbedded mudstone and shale layers become compressed by the overlying sediments and these compress to become load structures. The channels contain finely laminated mud clasts that have been carried through, and due to being softer sediments, these have preferentially weathered leaving behind imprints of where they once lay. These continue upwards until reaching the point where much larger portions of sandstone have been removed exposing honeycomb structures and large overhangs in the sequence. These are mainly as a result of modern-day flash flooding within the gorge, however the preface to this modern analogy also comes as a result of past channelization exposing the surfaces, as we know that the area is heavily influenced by fluvial channels. Within these upper beds the sandstone also undergoes a distinct colour change moving from a red to yellow to white sandstone, as a result of leaching and weathering processes. The higher up and further away in the Warang Sandstone, the more trough cross-stratification is observed. This becomes most noticeable in the White Mountains National Park as the trough cross stratification is most well preserved. The composition of the rock unit remains relatively uniform, however the amount of lithics increases the more distal from the source. The deposition of sandstone during channelization of the coastline occurred leading to the area becoming a sequence of fining and coarsening sandstone. This further buried the Betts Creek Beds allowing more compaction of the kerogen prior to faulting, and continued the build-up of sediment with each channel filled in over time. These were covered afterwards by thicker sediments that created the trough cross stratification sitting on top; in the more distal part of the Warang Sandstone the trough cross stratification increases to the point of removing all traces of channelization and a clearer flow direction. The sandstone is then cut at the top by a thin mudstone layer as denoted by the fauna growing at the contact of the Warang and Blantyre Sandstones.  Blantyre Sandstone  The Blantyre Sandstone is the continuation of channelization into the Jurassic. The formation is not easy to observe at a close scale, however by using Figure 2 above and knowledge of the Warang Sandstone an accurate description can be made. The channels are well preserved by coarse grained infill material, these are marked by parting lineations in the lower beds, and load structures in finely interbedded silty layers. Another feature that occurs within these are mudclasts that due to modern weathering have been removed to the point of having, what appear as, large gouges in the rock face. Within the upper part of the Blantyre formation trough cross stratification is present, and the angle of these troughs is in the order of around 25 degrees dipping in a north ‚Äì south direction. Due to the increasing jointing in the Blantyre, we can surmise that the sandstone is influenced very little by the hydrothermal fluids, and preferentially weathers mud clasts. The environment here is one that has not as much water moving through, and the jointed layering could be as a result of drought at the time. This unit proceeds for some time until migrating alluvial fans cover the Blantyre Sandstone creating thick paraconglomerate layers above.  Gilbert River Formation  The Gilbert River Formation consists of paraconglomerate litharenite layers. In the lower part of the formation flaser cross bedding in fine grained sandstone is found in abundance, however a little further up the system becomes awash with volcanic and chert clasts typical of alluvial debris. These then are buried underneath fine grained material once more until a significant occurrence of fining upwards in thin layers shows a sharp change in depositional environment. The formation proceeds to become much more coarse grained and large, pebble to cobble sized clasts are enclosed. These are also noted to be largely sedimentary and volcanic in origin. The paleocurrent values for the formation are also highly variable, denoting a high energy flow regime with sufficient force to move large amounts of sediment. This is shown well in Plate 10 below and the imbrication of these pebble clasts is a good indicator for flow direction. From the state of the system it can be confirmed that the flow regime of the beds has changed over time, with the most definite change marked by the thin, fining upwards bedding. The most logical control on these being the fact that the formation has had an influx of fluids most likely from the coastline splaying out into an alluvial fan. The final section of the Gilbert River Formation is baked by the overlying Sturgeon Basalt, and this has created the baked psammite layer at the top of the Gilbert River Formation.

The facility opened in February 2010 and features two ice hockey arenas, an aquatic centre, and a fitness centre. Outdoor sports facilities are also located on site. Construction A new community recreation centre was first proposed in the 1970s; however, the project was swiftly rejected by local residents in a public referendum. The idea was revived in 2006 by a group of local residents looking for ways to develop recreational opportunities in the area. A year later, the city and neighboring Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie officially created a planning committee for the new Portage multiplex and began making financial commitments to the project. Construction of the new complex began in September 2008. The projected final cost was $36 million, with $16 million coming from the city, $8 million from the municipality, $5 million from the federal government, and another $5 million from the provincial government. Another $1.2 million was generated from the sale of naming rights and the rest was raised through private and corporate donations. The complex was slated for completion in fall of 2009; however, delays pushed its opening to February 27, 2010. The final cost of the project was $44 million, with cost overruns absorbed by the city. The building has a LEED silver rating. Stride Credit Union, formerly Portage Credit Union, owns the naming rights to the building through the year 2030. Facilities=Arenas Stride Place has two indoor arenas: the larger Stride Credit Union (SCU) Arena and the smaller Portage Mutual Arena, both of which have National Hockey League regulation size ice surfaces. The SCU Arena has a seating capacity of 1,675 plus standing room for an additional 300 spectators. The Portage Mutual Arena holds 300 spectators, plus standing room for an additional 100. The Portage Terriers of the Manitoba Junior Hockey League are the SCU Arena's primary tenant. The arenas are also used by local minor hockey, ringette, figure skating and for non-hockey events such as trade shows and concerts.

The only species in the genus Afrasia, it was a small primate, estimated to weigh around . Despite the significant geographic distance between them, Afrasia is thought to be closely related to Afrotarsius, an enigmatic fossil found in Libya and Egypt that dates to 38‚Äì39 million years ago. If this relationship is correct, it suggests that early simians (a related group or clade consisting of monkeys, apes, and humans) dispersed from Asia to Africa during the middle Eocene and would add further support to the hypothesis that the first simians evolved in Asia, not Africa. Neither Afrasia nor Afrotarsius, which together form the family Afrotarsiidae, is considered ancestral to living simians, but they are part of a side branch or stem group known as eosimiiforms. Because they did not give rise to the stem simians that are known from the same deposits in Africa, early Asian simians are thought to have dispersed from Asia to Africa more than once prior to the late middle Eocene. Such dispersals from Asia to Africa also were seen around the same time in other mammalian groups, including hystricognathous rodents and anthracotheres. Afrasia is known from four isolated molar teeth found in the Pondaung Formation of Myanmar. These teeth are similar to those of Afrotarsius and Eosimiidae, and differ only in details of the chewing surface. For example, the back part of the third lower molar is relatively well-developed. In the Pondaung Formation, Afrasia was part of a diverse primate community that also includes the eosimiid Bahinia and members of the families Amphipithecidae and Sivaladapidae. Etymology The name Afrasia derives from the continental names \\"Africa\\" and \\"Asia\\", and refers to the occurrence of eosimiiform primates on both continents. The species, A. djijidae, was named in memory of a young girl from Mogaung village in central Myanmar. Evolutionary history Afrasia djijidae was first described in 2012 on the basis of isolated teeth from the 37-million-year-old Pondaung Formation, which is close to the village of Nyaungpinle in Myanmar. Prior to the discovery of A. djijidae, early Asian simians were typically classified in two families, Eosimiidae and Amphipithecidae. While eosimiids are generally considered the most basal simian clade (a stem group of simians), the phylogenetic placement of amphipithecids is more disputed. Amphipithecids are usually considered to share affinities with either eosimiids or crown simians (those simians that are part of the smallest clade that contains the living simians); the latter view is favored. Eosimiids were first described from findings in China in 1994 and are still best known there (two genera are now known, Eosimias and Phenacopithecus), but have also been recorded in Pakistan (Phileosimias) and Myanmar (Bahinia). All species had a small body size and a mix of primitive (ancestral) and derived traits (. The largest eosimiid, Bahinia, is from the Pondaung Formation, the same stratum as Afrasia, and the morphology of its molars bridges the gap between the more primitive molars of Eosimias and the more derived molars of the later Eocene African simians. Afrasia, on the other hand, is more comparable in size to the eosimiids from China. The upper molars of Afrasia are nearly identical in morphology and size to those of Afrotarsius, an animal known from 38- to 39-million-year-old deposits in Libya (species Afrotarsius libycus) and about 30-million-year-old deposits in Egypt (A. chatrathi). Afrotarsius was originally described as a tarsier, but later suggested to be related to primitive simians. Because of their close similarities, Afrasia and Afrotarsius are together placed in the family Afrotarsiidae. A phylogenetic analysis placed Afrasia as a sister group to Afrotarsius, forming the family Afrotarsiidae. Afrotarsiidae was found to be most closely related to Eosimiidae, and unrelated to tarsiers. The clade formed by Afrotarsiidae and Eosimiidae was designated as the infraorder Eosimiiformes by Chaimanee et al. in 2012. Eosimiiformes are the sister group of crown simians. However, the classification of Afrotarsius as a stem simian is not accepted by all researchers, and the phylogenetic claims and their implications rest on only the four molars of Afrasia initially discovered. Biogeography stem simians dispersed from Asia to Africa around that time.alt=Two molars, one of Afrotarsius (left) and one of Afrasia (right), are compared, with an Eocene map of the globe showing where each came from. In the lower-left, a life reconstruction of Afrotarsius is shown. Several hypotheses compete to explain the geographic origins of simians. Of the two most popular views, one hypothesis states that simians originated in Asia, while the other favors Africa as their place of origin. Both their ancient origins and the sparse fossil record in Africa and Asia complicate the debate. Convergent evolution also makes it difficult for researchers to determine the relationships between fossils. Also, the earliest fossils, which do not match up with molecular clock estimates for simian origins, have been found in both Afro-Arabia and Asia. At the time, both landmasses would have been separated by the Tethys Sea. The oldest undisputed simians from Africa also date to the late middle Eocene. Afrotarsius was found in the Dur At-Talah escarpment in Libya, which dates to 38‚Äì39 million years ago and also contains the parapithecid Biretia and the oligopithecid Talahpithecus. Although diverse, these primates were all very small in size, much like eosimiids. Simian classification for older fossils from Africa are more contested. Altiatlasius, the oldest suspected fossil primate known from the late Paleocene of Morocco, is too fragmentary to ascertain its true affinities. Algeripithecus was popularly considered an early middle Eocene simian; however, less fragmentary remains uncovered between 2003 and 2009 suggest it was a type of azibiid, a group of strepsirrhine primates likely related to lemuriform primates (lemurs and lorisoids). According to the team who discovered Afrasia, headed by Jean- Jacques Jaeger, the similarities in tooth morphology, body size, and age suggest a phylogenetic relationship with Afrotarsius despite the geographic separation. They suggested that afrotarsiid simians from Asia dispersed across the Tethys Sea to Africa around the middle Eocene, giving rise to Afrotarsius. A reverse migration‚Äîas suggested by the hypothesis of the African origin for simians‚Äîis not favored due to the close phylogenetic relationship between the older Asian eosimiids and Afrasia. However, to explain the origins of Proteopithecidae, Parapithecidae, and crown simians from the African fossil record, a higher simian clade also needed to disperse from Asia to Africa before the late middle Eocene since neither Afrasia nor Afrotarsius could have given rise to this group. Such dispersals from Asia to Africa were not uncommon, since hystricognathous rodents, anthracotheres, and possibly other mammalian fauna from Asia arrived around the same time. Anatomy Afrasia is known from four isolated teeth: a first upper molar (M1), with a length of 2.13 mm and width of 3.06 mm; a second upper molar (M2), the holotype, of 2.27 mm by 3.35 mm; a second lower molar (m2) of 2.09 mm by 1.41 mm; and a third lower molar (m3) of 2.05 mm by 1.27 mm. Like other eosimiiforms, it was a small primate that weighed around , which is estimated based on the measurements of its m2 and M1, respectively. It is generally similar to other eosimiiforms in general and Afrotarsius in particular; some distinguishing features are the well-developed small cusps (conules) on the upper molars, the variable development of the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) of the upper molars, and the unreduced talonid (posterior portion) on the m3. Its teeth are smaller than those of the eosimiids Phenacopithecus, Bahinia, and Phileosimias. The M2 is similar to that of eosimiids and almost identical to that of Afrotarsius libycus. It shows well-developed small accessory cusps (the paraconule and metaconule) that are connected to equally well-developed crests. The conules are stronger than in Eosimias and Bahinia, but weaker than in Phileosimias. The stylar shelf, the outer area of the tooth, is broad, particularly at the metacone cusp. However, the shelf is better developed near the paracone cusp in Afrasia than in Afrotarsius, which makes the ectoflexus (an invagination in the outer wall of the tooth) more symmetrical in the former. The parastyle, a small cusp in the outer front corner of the tooth, is located more buccally (towards the outer side of the tooth) than in Afrotarsius and is larger. The stylar shelf is larger than that of Bahinia and Phileosimias, but smaller than that of Eosimias. The parastyle is also less developed than in Eosimias, but the protocone, the main cusp on the lingual side of the tooth, is more expansive. The lingual cingulum is incomplete; it is stronger in Phenacopithecus. M1 is similar to M2, but somewhat smaller. The ectoflexus is less apparent, the stylar shelf is narrower, there is no crest behind the metaconule, and the lingual cingulum is continuous. The condition of the parastyle more closely resembles that in Afrotarsius. In m2, the trigonid (the front portion of the tooth) consists of three very distinct cusps: the paraconid at the front, and behind it the paired protoconid (on the buccal side) and metaconid (on the lingual side). These three cusps are less discrete in Afrotarsius. The paraconid is distinct from the paracristid, the crest that connects it to the protoconid, and is located more lingually than in Afrotarsius. Between this cusp and the metaconid behind it, the central basin of the trigonid is open towards the lingual margin of the tooth. The protoconid has a V shape, with one arm reaching towards the metaconid and the other towards the paraconid. The back portion of the tooth, the talonid, is broader; Eosimias has a narrower talonid. The main cusps, the buccal hypoconid and lingual entoconid, are opposite each other on the margins of the tooth (the entoconid is further to the front in Phenacopithecus). A crest, the cristid obliqua, connects the front side of the hypoconid to the protoconid. It is nearly in line with the main axis of the tooth, contrasting with its more diagonal position in Eosimias and Phenacopithecus. A crest, the postcristid, descends from the hypoconid along the back margin of the tooth and almost reaches the entoconid, which is separated by a notch. It incorporates the third talonid cusp, the hypoconulid, which is indistinct in Afrasia. In Afrotarsius and eosimiids (except the Pakistani Phileosimias), this crest reaches the entoconid. There is a cingulum, or shelf, on the buccal side of m2. The last lower molar, m3, is smaller and has a longer talonid, with a well-developed hypoconulid lobe at the back, and generally resembles that of Phenacopithecus, but the trigonid is smaller. The paraconid is distinct. The hypoconulid lobe is longer than in Afrotarsius and the entoconid is located further to the front. Unlike on m2, there is no notch between the hypoconulid and entoconid, though a shallow valley is present. Range and ecology Afrasia has only been found in the Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it at the end of the Bartonian stage, near the Middle‚ÄìLate Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been screened for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a rare species.

She has gathered like-minded individuals to introduce the charm of hanbok (Korean traditional clothes) to youth. Park organized the society after she went to Japan and saw people on the streets wearing traditional clothes. In Korea, encountering someone wearing hanbok on the streets is unthinkable. This is because Koreans perceive hanbok as too uncomfortable and formal to wear casually. To overcome such a perception, and to enhance an understanding of the traditional glamour and beauty that hanbok entails, Park decided to create the group. Park traced the reason for the bad impression of hanbok to a lack of recreational environments where people can enjoy themselves while wearing hanbok. She began to search for unique events that people could participate in. Park was looking for an event or some popular entertainment that has an immense ripple effect online, which led her to select the flash mob. A flash mob is often videotaped to depict people performing an unusual act for the purpose of entertainment. Park decided to create a flash mob video showing a group of people wearing hanbok who suddenly assemble in a public place, perform a brief dance, and quickly disperse. On 26 September 2011 at Hongdae Playground, 200 people in vivid and colorful hanbok gathered and began identical, choreographed movements to music. For its creative motivation and its devotion to Korean culture, Hanboknoridan is supported by Cyworld Dream Campaign, which strives to make a person‚Äôs vision come true.

Mary leaves the comfortable familiarity of her urban life and goes to live on Dick's struggling farm.

History An Allison Legacy Series car at Columbus 151 Speedway in 2012 The series was conceived in 1996 by Donald, Kenny, and Ronald Allison, the sons of former NASCAR driver Donnie Allison. The vehicles were designed to be 3/4 size stock cars. Kenny Allison said that the cars were designed to be decently affordable and have decent maintenance costs yet be a class that fans can relate to. The cars began to compete regularly in 1998 with the formation of a national series. The national touring series is run out of the Allison Brothers shop at Salisbury, North Carolina. By 2004, eight regional touring series had formed in the United States, including the Maine Legacy Series which had Canadian dates in Quebec and Nova Scotia. The cars are typically raced on road courses and or less short tracks. Feature events are typically 50 laps or less. Vehicle The series uses a tubular chassis with a fiberglass body. Body styles include a Ford Thunderbird and Chevrolet Monte Carlo. The vehicle is wide, long, high, with an wheelbase. The chassis is powered by a Mazda B2200 2.2-liter engine. The chassis must weigh (without the driver) and it utilizes Goodyear tires. As of August 2004, the vehicles were estimated to cost around $16,800 by Stock Car Racing Magazine. Racing enhancements including an aluminum radiator, adjustable front suspension, aluminum front hubs, a quick- change rear end, steel racing wheels, and coil over shocks and springs. An aluminum racing seat, 5-point harness, and window nets are required for safety. Drivers Drivers in the series are part-time, including children who are old enough to have jobs.

Outnumbered 5-1 a Confederate force successfully defended a critical section of the Charleston-Savannah railroad. This engagement was historically significant because it was one of the rare occasions when United States Marines fought in combat during the Civil War, in addition the Confederate forces included the entire Corps of Cadets from the South Carolina Military Academy (now The Citadel), who comprised more than a third of the Rebel force; this battle is also the only occasion when the entire student body of an American college fought in combat. Background In early December 1864 Major General William T. Sherman and his formidable army numbering an estimated 62,000 men approached the South Carolina border and their final objective of Savannah, Georgia. Sherman had ordered his men to apply \\"scorched earth\\" tactics which resulted in the burning of crops and homes, confiscation and killing of livestock and the consumption of any supplies available for his army. This total war strategy, though brutal was believed to cause mass desertion among Confederate troops and break the South's will to fight. Tulifinny was one of eight engagements in which cadets from the South Carolina Military Academy (SCMA) (also known as the Battalion of State Cadets) participated. The amphibious landing on the Tulifinny River conducted primarily by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps was successful in moving 5,000 troops to Gregorie Point (also known as Deveaux's Neck) which is a peninsula bounded by the Tulifinny and Coosawatchie Rivers located near the town of Yemassee and some 45 miles north of Savannah. Much of the peninsula was covered with swamps, thick foliage and large trees. General Francis Marion, \\"The Swamp Fox\\" of American Revolutionary War fame fought the British and encamped near the Tulifinny on several occasions. The Union objective was to cut the Charleston-Savannah rail line by destroying a railroad trestle that crossed the Tulifinny River.

White who served as Superintendent of the South Carolina Military Academy at the time of the battle \\"Every Cadet acted with conspicuous gallantry and showed that the discipline of his Academy had made him a thorough soldier for the battlefield. The privations of the succeeding months proved him as well prepared for the hardships of the march and the camp.\\"Report of Major J.B. White, Battalion State Cadets, Constitution of the State of South Carolina and the Ordinances, Reports and Resolutions adopted by the Convention of the People, held in Columbia, SC September, 1865. Julian Selby, Printer to the State, 1866. In early December, 1864 the South Carolina Battalion of State Cadets, 343 strong, which consisted of the Citadel Academy in Charleston and the Arsenal Academy in Columbia was deployed to defend the state. Founded in 1842 the South Carolina Military Academy (now The Citadel) consisted of cadets who were enrolled at the Arsenal Academy for their first year then transferred to the Citadel Academy to complete the remaining three years of their education. Major James B. White, SCMA Class of 1849 and Superitendent of SCMA, commanded the Battalion of State Cadets which consisted of Company A (Citadel cadets) and Company B (Arsenal cadets). Captain Hugh S. Thompson, Class of 1856 and Professor of Belles Letters and Ethics, served as commander of Company A and Captain John P. Thomas, Superintendent of the Arsenal Academy commanded Company B. Some Citadel cadets were assigned to Company B to serve as leaders and mentors to the younger Arsenal Academy cadets. Upon arrival at Pocotaglio on December 6, the Battalion of Cadets marched at the \\"double quick\\" (a run) to reach the railroad trestle at the Tulifinny River four miles away. As the cadets reached the river they were met by Major John Jenkins, CSA, and were immediately dispatched to the area where Union troops were advancing toward the railroad. Unfortunately for them, they had arrived too late as the enemy was entrenched on the Gregorie Point peninsula and within striking distance of the railroad trestles that cross the Tulifinny and Coosawatchie Rivers. General Jones assigned the cadets to protect the strategic bridge that crosses the Tulifinny. Near the trestle they built entrenchments and fortifications and despite the fact that they had no shelters or tents they dubbed their new home \\"Camp Tulifinny\\". Those who were not sleeping served on guard duty and patrolled the local area to prevent a surprise attack. Before sunrise the cadets heard the news that Union forces were too close to the railroad line and they were ordered to mount an attack to drive them back. Under cover of darkness the entire force of cadets gathered their muskets and ammunition, fixed bayonets and prepared to attack. Second day of battle At sunrise on December 7 the skirmish line composed of Citadel cadets and three companies of the 5th Georgia Infantry, all under the command of Major White, advanced to test the strength of the Union forces occupying a fortified hill. The Arsenal cadets followed, with the 47th Georgia on the right and Colonel Bacon's militia on the left, as the skirmish line advanced swiftly across a field of brown broom grass and into a wooded area; as the force reached the far edge of the woods in front of the Federal position they encountered a brisk fire. Farish Furman, a third class cadet from Greenville, S.C. later recalled \\"....marching through the woods when I saw a stream of fire shoot out from the bushes in front of me, accompanied by the sharp crack of a rifle,...I was the second man shot at by the enemy. The first had his jacket cut, the third (Greene) was shot in the face; the ball fired at me missed my head a few inches and buried itself in a tree close by.\\" The Confederate front shifted until it crossed a road at right angles, thus engaging the entire Yankee line; fighting became general against the Federals who had deployed five regiments in a strong skirmish line. The Confederate troops and cadets, partially sheltered by trees, poured a heavy fire into the enemy. This surprise attack drove the union troops back several hundred yards to their original entrenchments. One of the Georgia veterans who had fought alongside General John B. Hood complimented the Battalion of State Cadets by saying, \\"Dang, them fellers fight like Hood's Texicans!\\" But the attack came at a high cost, several cadets and faculty/staff were wounded and one, Cadet William Patterson was killed. The remainder of the day and through the 8th was spent caring for wounded, guarding captured enemy troops and building entrenchments. Third Day of Battle 2Lt (Brevet LtCol) George Stoddard (standing) who commanded a battalion of US Marines at Tulifinny On the morning of the 9th, the cadets repulsed a disciplined Union counterattack, the battalion of U.S. Marines fought on the extreme right of the union line engaging cadets who were encamped at Camp Tulifinny near the railroad trestle. The union forces were pushed back into their trenches and pursued through the thick swamp when their left flank gave way and they retreated by following the Tulifinny River southward. This was the last attack made by federal forces during the battle. After the battle The Battalion of State Cadets remained at Camp Tulifinny until Christmas when they redeployed to James Island, near Charleston. After Tulifinny the SCMA cadets remained in the field for five more months; they were assigned to remain with the Confederate Army to assist with the evacuation of James Island and they marched as far north as Asheville, North Carolina before being recalled to their home state by the Governor. Sherman's troops burned the Arsenal Academy in Columbia during their march to the sea and it never reopened. The Citadel Academy was seized by Union forces when Charleston fell a short time after the Tulifinny battle and they remained until 1882.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from a story by Merriwether Williams, Tim McKeon, and Adam Muto. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on April 26, 2010. The episode guest stars George Takei as the title character, Ricardio. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn believes that Princess Bubblegum's (voiced by Hynden Walch) new friend, a heart named Ricardio, is evil, and is proven right after learning that Ricardio is the heart of the Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny). Ricardio reveals that he wants to \\"make out\\" with Bubblegum's heart, but he is defeated by Finn and Jake. Ricardio would become a minor recurring villain, reappearing in the fourth season entry \\"Lady & Peebles\\". After the episode aired, series composer Casey James Basichis posted a video explaining his inspiration and the method in which he produced the music featured in the episode. Basichis largely scored the episode with opera music, because he felt the genre suited Ricardio. \\"Ricardio the Heart Guy\\" was watched by 1.91 million people and received largely positive critical attention, with many reviews praising Takei's voice work. Plot Ice King has kidnapped Princess Bubblegum. Finn and Jake throw snowballs at Ice King's eyes which stalls him enough for them to replace Princess Bubblegum with Jake's butt, which Ice King still thinks is Princess Bubblegum and kisses it. Princess Bubblegum thanks the boys by hugging Finn (making him embarrassed) and honoring them with a party. Finn makes a paper crane for Bubblegum as a gift, and Jake says that Finn has a crush on her, which he denies. But when they arrive at the party, no one notices them and only watch as a heart-shaped man gives Lumpy Space Princess a massage called the Best Friend Massage. Bubblegum walks in and the heart-shaped man introduces himself as Ricardio. He begins talking to Princess Bubblegum about Plantoids and Zanoits and other science subjects. Finn immediately gets jealous and he tries to impress Bubblegum by doing the Science Dance, but embarrasses himself by saying \\"I'm not jealous, I'm WEIRD!\\" when Bubblegum accuses him of being jealous. Finn thinks Ricardio is a villain, but Jake does not, so they spy on him to see if he is evil or not. They see Ricardio going into a dumpster, holding a rope and broken bottles. Then they see him throwing the Ice King into the dumpster, so they question him about being a super-villain. Finn punches Ricardio right when Bubblegum comes. Mad and upset, she takes Ricardio away. And when Finn begins to believe Bubblegum hates him and that he was wrong, Ice King then crawls to Finn and Jake and tells them that Ricardio is a villain. He says that during an experiment where he tried to take control of Princess Bubblegum's heart, he messed up and lost control of his. Ricardio said that he was going to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart and make out with it. Without Ricardio, Ice King grew weak but managed to get to the Candy Kingdom and pleaded to Ricardio for him to return to Ice King's body, but instead Ricardio threw him into the dumpster and left him for dead. Finn and Jake hurry to the Princess Bubblegum's Castle and find Princess Bubblegum tied to a chair, being held hostage by Ricardio. Finn and Jake then fight Ricardio and manage to beat him up. The Ice King crawls into the castle and places Ricardio into his chest. He then believes that Bubblegum would marry him, but Finn kicks him in the face which causes him to fly away. During dinner, Bubblegum tells Finn that he does not need to be jealous anymore, but Finn denies that he was jealous in the first place. Then, Princess Bubblegum says \\"Kiss me, Finn,\\" which causes Finn to blush. Princess Bubblegum was just acting like Jake did in the beginning of the episode; she was upside-down with a picture of Jake on her dress. Finn then screams \\"NOOOOO!\\" Production The episode guest stars George Takei. \\"Ricardio the Heart Guy\\" was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Sean Jimenez, from a story by Merriwether Williams, Tim McKeon, and Adam Muto. Directed by Larry Leichliter, the episode introduces the recurring villain Ricardio, played by George Takei, a character that Tom Kenny later called \\"the valentine from Hell\\". Takei later reprised the role in the season four episode \\"Lady and Peebles\\". Initial drafts of the character featured him looking more like an anthropomorphic heart, complete with arteries and ventricles. Ricardio is one of the few individuals in the Adventure Time universe to have a highly detailed face; during the commentary for the episode, his design was compared to that of the face on the moon in the 1902 French silent film Le Voyage dans la Lune, based on H.G. Wells's 1901 novel The First Men in the Moon. After the episode aired, series composer Casey Basichis posted a video explaining his inspiration and method of producing the music featured in the episode. According to the video, Basichis created a \\"skeleton\\" of the score in his shower using his voice and a ukulele; the audio was captured on a phone. Originally, the score was going to have a \\"New York City, taxi, and jazz\\" feel, but Basichis was unhappy with the genre choice, and changed the feel. For the music that played while the Ice King interacted with Ricardio, Basichis was inspired by the score from the original seven-minute short. In addition, opera singer Karen Vuong lent her voice to the episode. According to Basichis, Vuong was able to record her vocals successfully in one take. Basichis chose opera because he knew it had a reputation for being \\"sickeningly intellectual\\" and \\"preoccupied with murder\\", traits that he felt suited Ricardio. Reception \\"Ricardio the Heart Guy\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on April 26, 2010. The episode was watched by 1.91 million viewers, and scored a 1.3/2 percent Nielsen household rating, meaning that it was seen by 1.3 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2011 Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People DVD, which included 12 episodes from the series' first two seasons. It was later re- released as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012; commentary for the episode was also included on the DVD. The episode garnered mostly positive reviews from critics. Matt Fowler of IGN, in a review of the My Two Favorite People DVD, noted that while \\"the idea of a walking, talking heart named Ricardio [‚Ä¶] who plans to cut out Princess Bubblegum's heart is potent nightmare fuel\\", the show nevertheless \\"finds a way to make that grim idea accessible and fun.\\" Takei's appearance as Ricardio gained critical favor. Charlie Anders of io9 named Takei's appearance in the episode as one of his \\"greatest moments\\", noting, \\"how could we have missed that Takei did the voice for this sleazy science-talking heart on Adventure Time, our new favorite show?\\" Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called Ricardio one of the highlights of the season. The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava, in a review for \\"Lady & Peebles\\", wrote that Ricardio is \\"always welcome on this series, largely due to Takei‚Äôs delightful voice work.\\" Furthermore, he praised the way that Takei delivered his lines, noting that \\"there‚Äôs a theatrical smarminess to his vocals that is a stark contrast to the Ice King‚Äôs nasality\\", and that \\"Takei always sounds like he‚Äôs having a great time reading the ridiculous lines that are written for him.\\" Explanatory notesReferencesExternal links 2010 American television episodes Adventure Time (season 1) episodes ","title":"Ricardio the Heart Guy"},{"id":"36043188","text":"Clarissa Ward (born January 30, 1980) is an American television journalist who is currently chief international correspondent for CNN.

The entry was directed by Larry Leichliter. Ward made sure that the ending \\"turn[ed] the moral on its head\\", by adding the line \\"No man, let's always be stupid‚Ä¶ forever!\\" Ward explained, \\"I just cringe when there's a serious moral to be learned at the end of a story.

The episode was watched by 1.65 viewers, and scored a 1.1/2 percent Nielsen household rating, meaning that it was seen by 1.2 percent of all households and 2 percent of all households watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the eponymous 2011 DVD, Adventure Time: My Two Favorite People, which included 12 episodes from the series' first two seasons. It was later re-leased as part of the complete first season DVD in July 2012. Critically, the episode was well- received. It was later nominated for a 2010 Emmy Award for Short-format Animation, although the episode did not win. The DVD release that the episode lent its namesake to was mostly well-received by critics, although several reviewers were slightly displeased at the apparent randomness of the episodes included. Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk complimented the release, calling it a \\"short random assortment, presented in good quality\\" that \\"is fun to watch and might satisfy younger fans\\". However, he noted that, because full season collections were on their way, \\"you may want to [rent it] for now.\\" Matt Fowler of IGN awarded it a 7 out of 10 rating, denoting a \\"good\\" release.

The Thai State claims to function as a civil society with an intersectionality between gender inequality and activism in its political spheres. In the Thai state, feminist activism is pivotal upon class structures, which focus on specific facets of public policy based on a woman's socioeconomic status. The hierarchy of a feminist's issue lies in one's class social strata. The Thai elite focusing on public policy, social equality, and increase in women's presence within economic confines. The younger Thai generation is depicted as less concerned with their public policy and formal politics; while middle class feminist Thai women express their political concerns through more antiquated and traditional mediums such as artistic performances and published works. History of the Thai women‚Äôs movement=1920s * In 1927, for the first time in Thai history, seven female students were admitted to Chulalongkorn University. 1930s * In 1932 Thai women gained the right to vote, the first of Asian countries to grant suffrage to women. * Three of the seven original women admitted to Chulalongkorn University graduated with the first female BA in Medicine. 1940s * Orapin Chaiyakan is the first woman elected to a post in the Parliament of Thailand, on June 5, 1949 Chaiyakan was elected as member of the House of Representatives of Thailand of The National Assembly of the Kingdom of Thailand. 1950s ‚Ä¢ The rights of a wife to matrimonial property management were imposed. 1960s * While under the military dictatorship in the 1960s, a group of upper class, educated Thai women began to address Thai public policy facets which were inequitable, beginning with family law. This initial upper-class women's movement was contributed as a continuation of a less publicized law reform movement in the 1950s where women activist focused on issues which entailed the rights of a wife to matrimonial property management and the impeding of males who double registered their marriages. In tandem with the upper-class women's policy concerns, the 1960s Thai Student's Movement emerged along with women's groups at Thammasat University. These students focused on 'building women's consciousness' while gaining public attention through book publishing and protesting. * The women's groups during this time period also participated in the People's Movement (in lieu of the fact that many men were involved in activism and protests). The People's Movement played a quintessential role in the 1973 student uprising anti-military demonstrations in Bangkok (now enshrined in the memories of Thai people as hok tulaa) which aided in the Thai State becoming an 'unstable democracy' beginning in 1973. This 1973 movement was highly publicized though the platform of feminist journalists, alongside the academic, professional, and public institutions of its time. See-History of Thailand (1973‚Äì2001) 1970s * Feminism in the 1970s in the Thai state gained momentum through the 1974 constitutional change of an Equal Rights Protection Law. The Equal Rights Protection Law was the first in Thai history to focus on women's issues and gender equality. This law was a foundational step towards the proliferation of women's groups in the Thai State. In 1976 there was a right-wing backlash against the Thai People's Movement and women's groups from students in Thammasat University. The army and right-wing organization \\"The Scouts\\" spread propaganda that the pro- democratic liberal Thammasat University students were communists who would lead to the downfall of Thailand as they were 'working with the underground'. In October 1976 'The Scouts' engulfed Thammasat University and began to open fire on the university's grounds. Though Thai police were present, it is said that the police were of no aid to the seventy activists who were killed, hidden, and buried. Women's group participants were raped, sexually mutilated, and buried alive. After this backlash against Thailand's unstable democracy the Thai state defaulted back to its past dictatorship rule, with many who participated in 'The Scout's' organization fled to the forest to become 'guerrillas'. 1980s * Throughout the late 1970s to early 1980s Thailand began to shift away from communism due to the lack of support from China. This shift away from hierarchical structures facilitated a political climate which would become The International Women's Decade 1975-1985. This political movement paved the way for the foundation of women's studies programs, and in 1985 the elimination of many governmental forms of discrimination against women. * The 1980s also brought a rise in a higher ratio of women to men in tertiary education. 1990s * The 1990s feminist movement focused on political equality between genders. In 1992 Thai activists participated in Operation Black, a peaceful protest by which the people help demonstrations against Thailand's 1992 ‚Äòillegitimate‚Äô Prime Minister. 2000s * Thailand outlawed marital rape in 2007. * In 2011 the Thai state appointed Yingluck Shinawatra as the first female and 28th Prime Minister. Yingluck Shinawatra won by the majority vote of 265 of 500 parliament seats (52% of the votes). She was removed from office on 7 May 2014 by a controversial Constitutional Court decision. Thai Buddhist Feminist Theory :The conceptualization of Thai Buddhist Feminist Theory is founded upon feminist activists who seek to find spiritual rejuvenation. Participating in mediation while practicing mindful eating habits Thai Buddhist Feminist activists Ouyporn Khuankaew and Ginger Norwood pay specific attention to breathing techniques while taking action in local communities through the facilitation of workshops which aid refugees, victims of sexual violence, and the rejuvenation of other women's organization directors. Through the communication between activist Thai women Khuankaew believes that change will take place. In one interview Khuankaew states, 'Sometimes, women who come to the retreats are so overwhelmed by the trauma they have witnessed that listening to each other is very difficult. I tell them that listening is a form of meditation. Mediation does not only involve watching and letting go of your own mind‚Äîgetting lost in a space separate from other people. Mediation can also include being a witness, seeing each other as survivors, as activists, as mothers and visionaries. Deep listening is a skill we practice together' Activism and movements * International Women's Partnership for Peace and Justice (IWP) is a feminist grassroots organization which aims to support activism in Thailand amongst other Asian regions. Focused on community, spirituality, sustainability, and support of progressive local movements. The IWP serves as a retreat center for community peace groups, with facilities which include mediation rooms, libraries, and guest facilities. According to the IWP's website the organization's foundation encompasses three core principles: feminism, social activism, and spiritual practice.' * The Association for the Promotion of the Status of Women (APSW) was founded in 1974 as an emergency home in Bangkok, Thailand. Providing women and children with food, mental health assistance, and temporary shelter, the APSW has helped over 50,000 women countrywide. Within the APSW is a Women's Clinic, which was constructed upon 1987 the US$1 million 1987 donation from US President Jimmy Carter and wife Rosalynn Carter. With as many as 20 women in its facility per day, the Women's Clinic focuses on the healthcare and reproductive rights of pregnant women and infant health. In 2003 the APSW opened a Rape Crisis Center- the Kanitnaree Center to provide services to rape victims. Other facilities within the APSW include its Women's Education and Training Center, Youth Center, Teen Training House, and its Gender and Development Research Institute. * The Foundation for Women (FWW) is a non-governmental organization based out of Bangkok, Thailand. The original establishment manifested in 1984 as Women's Information Center giving advice to Thai women traveling overseas. In 1986 the FFW opened a women's shelter for victims of domestic violence. The FFW focused on providing services such for Thai women such as shelters and education of human rights. In 1988 the FFW began its Kamla project, which centered on educating the Bangkok community on child prostitution and human trafficking. In 1922 the Kamla project reached a national awareness when the FFW's research was printed in the UN Plan of Action Combating the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography. The FFW continues to aid women and children in the development of advocacy and autonomy in their communities by aiding in volunteer training through community biased work and connecting women to the proper authorities to voice their own opinions to facilitate problem solving and social change. The FFW provides assistance for individuals victim to gender based violence, including sexual and domestic violence. The foundation also participates in campaigning against marital rape and the ‚Äòprotection and prevention of the rights of women‚Äô. The FFW gains awareness through its proliferation of educational videos, newspapers, and national publications. * Women Network Reshaping Thailand (WREST) whose website slogan reads 'Reinvent the country's network'. The WREST advocates for the promotion of gender equality and the engagement of Thai women to participate in the government's decision making processes. WREST trains rural women in the education of Thai economy and reform process. Sexuality in Thai culture :Organizations such as Thailand's Women‚Äôs Health Advocacy Foundation focus on Thai women's reproductive rights and sexuality issues based on choice which is a traditional feminist topic. Located in Bangkok, The Women's Health Advocacy Foundation includes research, training of skilled nurses. and hosting of international conferences on the facilitation of safe abortions. :Issues of sexuality are often debated as Thai feminist subject due to an array of sexual preferences within Thai culture. The subject of sexuality is quantified based on an individual's societal class 'norms'. In Chalidaporn Songsamphan's article, \\"Localizing Feminism: Women‚Äôs Voices and Social Activism in Thai Context\\" Songsamphan (Associate Professor of Political Science at Thammasat University) states that, 'while some Thai feminists do not tolerate commercial sex, others looked at it as a type of work women might choose due to their particular reasons and circumstances.' Sex workers and human rights :Sex workers in Thailand have been resisting and organizing for decades. In 1985 with support from the Thai activist and women's human rights defender Chantawipa Apisuk they formed their first organization - Empower Foundation. In 2004 a second sex worker organization created by Empower members SWING began. Empower has had a leading role in creating many other networks and organizations to address issues of HIV, migration, political reform, natural disasters e.g. tsunami. Sex workers are often unrecognized in their roles as leaders of Thai feminism and movement building. www.empowerfoundation.org Women's studies academic degrees :Two institutions in Thailand offer a graduate level Women's Studies degree: Chiangmai University in 2000 and the Women's and Youth Studies Programme in Thammasat University. The first Women' Studies Centre was established in 1981. The Gender and Development Studies (GDS) Field of Study at the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT). According to a Bangkok independent economist, Sethaput Suthiwart-Narueput, by 2020 there will be one million more women than men in Thailand and 'The top 10 faculties of the top 10 universities in Thailand have more women students than male students except for accounting and education.'

BWC focuses on vegan and \\"natural\\" products that can't chemically harm humans and do not need to be tested on animals. BWC has worked to support the Humane Cosmetics Act on its mission to end cosmetic animal testing in the United States. History After being founded officially in England (1963) by BWC Charitable Trust, BWC began work on its cosmetics line. BWC's goal was to create natural cosmetics that did not contain animal ingredients and had never been tested on animals. Katherine Long, a well known cosmetician and animal welfare activist, worked with Noel Gabriel to lead the organization in creating these products. Muriel Dowding offered her assistance to the organization after Long's death in 1969 to stop it from being shut down. Later in 1978, Joseph Piccioni became the managing director of BWC in Great Britain. With his business expertise and dedication to animal rights, Piccioni helped lead BWC to launch its lines in the United States in 1989.

The game stars a submissive who eagerly goes to Anni, her dominant partner, only to find that Anni plans on eating her for dinner in her house. The player is forced to make branching choices which affect the game's outcome. Anthropy was inspired by her real-life submissive to create a dating sim that reflected real carnal desires instead of a more standard dating sim, which she perceived to be somewhat exploitative and inhuman. The game has received praise from critics for its unique take on the genre. Gameplay Encyclopedia Fuckme and the Case of the Vanishing Entree is a dating sim with simple branching choices for the player to choose. The player is shown two options at each stage of the plot which change how the main character will act in reaction to the events as they unfold, in a way that is somewhat similar in structure to the Choose Your Own Adventure series. After the player reaches the end of each playthrough, they are allowed to restart and try for a different ending. Plot The plot is told in the second person, directed towards the player, as if they are themselves the main character. The female main character, who is unnamed, receives a note from her dominant lover, Anni, who invites the main character to Anni's house. Arriving at the house and engaging in various acts of foreplay, the main character is eventually tied up. Anni begins to draw lines on the main character with a magic marker, announcing that she intends to eat the main character for dinner as she brings out a large knife. The main character escapes, but is eventually recaptured by Anni, who forces the main character to take a bath so she can be cleaned before being eaten. In most of the branching paths, if the submissive main character resists completely or gives in completely during the bath, she is carved alive afterwards by Anni. Another ending exists, in which the main character both submits and resists, where the player is allowed by Anni for one last request. Upon asking Anni to \\"...please fuck me,\\" the main character reveals that she has vagina dentata; her vagina eats Anni's fist. Anni bleeds to death and the main character survives. Development Anna Anthropy, an independent game developer, decided to create Encyclopedia Fuckme because her real-life submissive inspired her to write a dating sim. In an interview with The Escapist, Anthropy rejected the stereotypical dating sim plot, which she felt fit into a \\"lonely nerd harem fantasy\\" mold every game, and instead created Encyclopedia Fuckme as a dating sim which was based on real human sexuality and emotion. Anthropy stated that Encyclopedia Fuckme was \\"the first game that ever got Twine much attention\\". Reception Encyclopedia Fuckme and the Case of the Vanishing Entree has received mostly positive reception from critics. Kill Screen praised the game for turning established genre convictions on their head, noting \\"... it seriously pushes against the status quo of the medium.\\" The A.V. Club noted that by placing the story in the second-person, \\"binds readers into the role of a voracious submissive,\\" and noted that \\"Anthropy writes good smut.\\" The Escapists Leigh Alexander encouraged her readers to play the game, noting that the game \\"reflects a facet of the inner lives of two adults in a healthy, playful relationship,\\" something from her perception that was new to the dating sim genre.

It is a toxic and explosive gas at room temperature. It is used in organic synthesis and can be produced by pyrolysis of cyanuric fluoride or by fluorination of cyanogen.  Synthesis  Cyanogen fluoride (FCN), is synthesized by the pyrolysis of cyanuric fluoride (C3N3F3) at 1300 ¬∞C and 50mm pressure; this process gives a maximum of 50% yield. Other products observed were cyanogen and CF3CN. For pyrolysis, an induction heated carbon tube with an internal diameter of 0.75 inches is packed with 4 to 8 mesh carbon granules and is surrounded by graphite powder insulation and a water-jacketed shell. The cyanuric fluoride is pyrolyzed (becoming a pyrolysate) at a rate of 50g/hr, and appears as fluffy white solid collected in liquid nitrogen traps. These liquid nitrogen traps are filled to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen or helium. This process yields crude cyanogen fluoride, which is then distilled in a glass column at atmospheric pressure to give pure cyanogen fluoride. Another method of synthesizing cyanogen fluoride is by the fluorination of cyanogen. Nitrogen trifluoride can fluoridate cyanogen to cyanogen fluoride when both the reactants are injected downstream into the nitrogen arc plasma. With carbonyl fluoride and carbon tetrafluoride, FCN was obtained by passing these fluorides through the arc flame and injecting the cyanogen downstream into the arc plasma.  Properties  Cyanogen fluoride (FCN) is a toxic colorless gas. The linear molecule has a molecular mass of 45.015 gmol‚àí1. Cyanogen fluoride has a boiling point of -46.2 ¬∞C and a melting point of -82 ¬∞C. The stretching constant for the CN bond was 17.5 mdyn/A and for the CF bond it was 8.07 mdyn/A, but this can vary depending on the interaction constant. At room temperature, the condensed phase converts rapidly to polymeric materials. Liquid FCN explodes at -41 ¬∞C when initiated by a squib.  Spectroscopy  The fluorine NMR pattern for FCN showed that there was a triplet peak centered at 80 ppm (3180 cps) with a 32-34 cps splitting between adjacent peaks because of the N14 nucleus. This splitting is absent near freezing point and it collapses to a singlet peak. The IR spectrum of FCN shows two doublet bands at around 2290 cm‚àí1 (for the C ‚â° N) and 1078 cm‚àí1 (for the C-F). The C-F doublet band has a 24 cm‚àí1 separation between the two branches. A triplet band is observed at around 451 cm‚àí1.  Chemical reactions  Cyanogen fluoride reacts with benzene in the presence of aluminum chloride to form benzonitrile in 20% conversion. It also reacts with olefins to yield an alpha,beta-fluoronitriles.Lipscomb, R. D., & Smith, W. C. (1961). U.S. Patent No. 3,008,798. Washington, DC: U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. FCN also adds to olefins which have internal double bonds in the presence of strong acid catalyst.  Storage  FCN can be stored in a stainless steel cylinders for over a year when the temperature is -78.5 ¬∞C (solid carbon dioxide temperature).  Safety  Cyanogen fluoride undergoes violent reaction when in the presence of boron trifluoride or hydrogen fluoride. Pure gaseous FCN at atmospheric pressure and room temperature does not ignite by a spark or hot wire. FCN air mixtures however are more susceptible to ignition and explosion than pure FCN.  Uses  FCN is useful in synthesis of important compounds such as dyes, fluorescent brighteners and photographic sensitizers. It is also very useful as a fluorinating and nitrilating agent. Beta-fluoronitriles, which are produced when FCN is reacted with olefins, are useful intermediates for preparing polymers, beta-fluorocarboxylic acids and other fluorine containing products. Useful amines can be obtained. Cyanogen fluoride is a very volatile fumigant, disinfectant and animal pest killer.

The central raised axis, that is defined by a furrow, is moderately convex and narrow, at its widest about ‚Öõ of the maximum width of the headshield (or cephalon). The part of the axis in the cephalon, called glabella, tapers forward, is rounded-truncate at its front, is inserted by for pairs of furrows that do not contact across the midline, and one at the back that defines the occipital ring. The fourth pair of lateral furrows curve strongly inward until parallel with the midline. A border is defined by a furrow running parallel to the margin of the cephalon, and this border furrow is deep at the front. The areas outside the axis are almost flat. Between the front of the glabella and the border, is a somewhat convex area of the cheek that is comparable in length (along the midline) to the occipital ring. In well preserved specimens the cheeks in front of the eye are adorned with very fine ridges (or striae) that probably represent parts of the digestive system (see Kordule, 2006, p. 283, figure 2.a/f). The eye ridges are threadlike, evenly curved, extending from the anterior corners of the glabella to halfway the genal angles, while the visual surface makes an abrupt angle, is shaped like a bracket parallel to the midline and ¬±‚Öõ of the length of the cephalon. Like in most trilobites, the division between the outer free cheek (or librigena) and the inner fixed cheek (or fixigena) is a line (or suture) where the exoskeleton splits to assist in moulting. It always follows the inside of the visual surface of the eye. In Ptychoparia, the part of this suture behind the eye cuts to the posterior margin just to the inside of the genal spine (or the suture is gonatoparian), and the part in front of the eye diverges from the midline. There is a spine in the back corners of the cephalon (or genal spine) that reaches approximately to the third thorax segment, and is confluent with the outer margin of the cephalon. The articulate midsection of the body (or thorax) has 13 (P. striata) or 14 (P. dubinka) segments. Tail shield (or pygidium) is slightly over half as wide as the cephalon (a state called micropygous). The pygidial axis (or rachis) has 5 or 6 rings and a termination and 4 or 5 ribs in the outlying pleural regions. The pygidium in Ptychoparia lacks a border.

The suite exists in versions for solo piano and piano four-hands. Weihnachtsbaum does not demand great virtuosity, and it has been described as a distant relation of Schumann's Kinderszenen and Debussy's Children's Corner. It occupies an unusual place in Liszt's output, and it may be for these reasons that it has received relatively little attention from performers. Background Liszt dedicated Weihnachtsbaum to his first grandchild Daniela von B√ºlow (1860-1940; daughter of Cosima and Hans von B√ºlow). Daniela had accompanied her grandfather to Rome due to his frail condition. The first performance was on Christmas Day 1881 in Daniela's Rome hotel room. This was the day on which her mother Cosima always celebrated her birthday, although she was actually born on Christmas Eve. Structure A number of the pieces are based on Christmas carols. The individual pieces are: #Psallite; Altes Weihnachtslied (Psallite; Old Christmas Song; originally a choral work by Michael Praetorius) #O heilige Nacht!; Weihnachtslied Nach Einer Alten Weise (O Holy Night!; Christmas Song on an Old Theme) #In dulci jubilo: Die Hirten an der Krippe (In dulci jubilo: The Shepherds at the Manger) #Adeste fideles: Gleichsam als Marsch der heiligen drei K√∂nige (Adeste Fideles: March of the Three Holy Kings) #Scherzoso: Man z√ºndet die Kerzen des Baumes an (Scherzoso: Lighting the Candles on the Tree at Last) #Glockenspiel (Carillon) #Schlummerlied (Slumber Song) #Altes proven√ßalisches Weihnachtslied (Old Proven√ßal Christmas Song) #Abendglocken (Evening Bells) #Ehemals (variously trans. as In Days Gone By, Old Times, Long Ago, Formerly) #Ungarisch (Hungarian; this is separately dedicated to Liszt's friend Korn√©l √Åbr√°nyiLeslie Howard, Notes to Hyperion recording) #Polnisch (Polish). The work is divided into three books of four pieces each. Not all of the pieces have a Christmas connection. In particular, the last three are believed to be autobiographical in nature, depicting Liszt's relationship with Princess Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein. Ehemals is said to depict their first meeting, and is similar in mood and spirit to the Valses oubli√©es. Ungarisch and Polnisch are said to represent Liszt and Carolyne individually.Classical ArchivesJoseph Banowetz, Notes to Dover Publications edition of the duet version Versions The first version was for solo piano, written in 1873‚Äì74. This was not published, and is catalogued as S. 185a. In about 1875 Liszt arranged it for piano four hands (S. 612a). This was also not published. The version for solo piano (or harmonium) was revised 1874‚Äì76 (S. 186) and the version for piano four hands was revised 1876-81 (S. 613). These were both published in 1882 by Adolph F√ºrstner, Berlin. No. 2, O heilige Nacht!, was revised in 1881 for tenor solo, female chorus and organ or harmonium (S. 49). The solo piano version of No. 7. Schlummerlied. was revised 1879-81 (S. 186/7a) and this was published by Schirmer, New York, in 1950.IMSLP The manuscript came into the possession of Liszt's American student Carl Lachmund (1857-1928); it was discovered among a sheaf of assorted papers given to him by Liszt's valet. Lachmund was not aware that it belonged to Weihnachtsbaum specifically; he says in the foreword: \\"The Roman VII over the title would indicate that the piece might have been intended for some collection\\".

They were also known as Miris in the past and still recognized as Miris in the Constitution of India. Miri is the older name and traces back to the ancestor Abotani. Misings are recognised as a Scheduled Tribe by the Indian government under the name 'Miri'. Their language, Mising, is part of the Sino-Tibetan family. History The Misings belong to the greater group of Tani people, who speak languages of the Sino-Tibetan family, which comprise many tribes of Arunachal Pradesh in India and Tibet. All Tani tribes share linguistic, cultural and genetic similarities. Mising women dancing on Ali Ay√© L√≠gang, a traditional festival of the Misings There is no written history of Misings about their migration from the Himalayas to the plains of Assam but history was passed down orally in the form of folk songs and stories by the ancestors from generation to generation and is still prevalent among their society. Although, they were initially hill dwellers, they later migrated to the plains and started living on the banks of rivers of Assam. The reason for this change of habitat is not known, but one theory says that the Misings presently living in plains of Assam were not one single tribe, but it evolved into one when many tribes from various Tani tribes of Arunachal Pradesh migrated to the plains of Assam. This explains the presence of many Mising clans with different Mising dialects as well as different levels of development.  Autonomy movement  The Misings currently has some state autonomy under the Mising Autonomous Council (MAC), which was formed in 1995 following violent clashes in early 90s for greater autonomy. MAC includes 40 constituencies in eight upper Assam districts comprising core areas and satellite areas. Executive councillor (EC) from 36 constituency are elected democratically while 4 other members are represented by the ruling government of Assam. Tensions exist between the Mising tribe and other communities regarding the inclusion of few Non-Mising villages in MAC. Although no violence occurred between Misings and non-Misings, however some non-Mising unions clashed with the police. MAC area constitute of more than 60% ST population and other communities are a minority. Most of the Misings today reside in the districts of Dhemaji and Lakhimpur, bordering Arunachal Pradesh, while a significant number is present in the Majuli district as well. Since 1983, Mising organizations have been demanding Sixth Schedule status under the Constitution of India. Various Mising nationalist organizations have been formed, like Takam Mising Porin K√©bang (Mising Students' Union) and Mising Bahne Kebang (Mising Council) after inclusion of education in Mising areas. In 2009, an armed Mising organization under the banner of Liberal Democratic Council of Misingland (LDCML) was formed for a separate homeland for Misings in Upper Assam. They seek secession from Assam state and reason cited are years of discrimination against the marginalized indigenous ST/SC communities by the Assam government. Many young people have joined the organization and received training somewhere in Bodoland (Assam) and Myanmar. The base camp is probably located somewhere on the Indo-Myanmar border. Political and social awareness among Misings, and fear of outside non- indigenous encroachment on their language and culture have caused many young Misings to carry on their struggle. Population According to the Census of India conducted in 2011, the population of Mising in Assam is approximately 7 lakhs with a good sex ratio. They live in 10 districts of Assam: Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Sonitpur, Tinsukia, Dibrugarh, Sivasagar, Majuli, Charaideo, Jorhat and Golaghat, and in three districts of Arunachal Pradesh: East Siang district, Lower Dibang Valley, and Lohit. The most prominent Mising villages in Arunachal Pradesh include Oyan, Namsing, Leku, Jelam of East Siang district. In Lohit District's Namsai, a good number of Missing are found, especially in the areas around Silatoo Mising village.  Culture =Music and dance The Misings have a variety of different types of folk songs. Ahbang - It is a verse of hymn of praise and worship of gods and goddesses. Ahbang is sung by the Mibu (priest) at rituals. There is also community Ahbangs generally used in Pobua, a ritual festival, praying for better crops, health and happiness. Kaban - It is one of the oldest forms of Mising folk songs. It is lamentation music and recalls sad events. At the death of a dear one, the women burst out into a sort of cry and song which for an outsider may sound funny. Tebo Tekang - It is a romantic lyric, narrating some love encounters. Siuhung Nihtom - It is a melancholic song, sung in lonely places like jungle. Bini - These are lullabies sung either at home or in the field, taking babies to places of work. The baby is tied to the back of the mother or the young babysitter. Midang Nihtom - This is usually sung at the time of ushering in a bride to her new home, often in order to tease her. These too are rather melancholic, since they depict the sadness of brides wailing at being separated from her family, friends and the familiar childhood environment. Oi Nihtom - It is the most popular form of Mising folk song, sung by Mising youths when they are working or moving about the fields, woods, etc. It is an integral part of the Mising Sohman (dance). It has a variety of themes ranging from romance, humour, tragedy, and socio-cultural motifs. Each line in an Oi-Nihtom is of seven syllables. Misings have rich folk music. Apart from dumdum, luhpi, lehnong, marbang, bali, etc. used in Gumrag dance and which are common to other locals, the following are the typical type of traditional instruments played in Mising folk music: ejuk tapung, derki tapung, tumbo tapung, tuhtok tapung, ketpong tapung, gekre tapung, dendun, dumpak cor√©g, gunggang, tulung etc. These are mostly wind instruments made of bamboo. Yoxa (sword) is used as a musical instrument by the priest (Mibu) during religious dances. There are many types of Mising dances, and each has their particular rules. Gumrag is performed five times in circles. Drums and cymbals are the usual musical instruments for the dances. Mibu Dagnam - It is a priestly dance performed mostly during Po:rag, the harvesting festival, observed in the Murong, the community hall of the Misings. The priest sings the Ahbang while performing this ritual dance. Selloi - This is a kind of merry-making song and dance often performed for fun, by young boys and girls with the accompaniment of drums or cymbals. It marks the beginning of the influx of the Mising people from hills to plains of Assam.A cute little Mising girl, in their traditional dress Lereli - Occasionally, all sections of Mising people indulge in singing and dancing lereli in sheer fun and merriment, especially at meeting old friends. Ejug Tapung Sohman - This is a very ancient form of dance performed to the accompaniment of ejug tapung, a wind instrument resembling the snake charmer‚Äôs been. Gumrag Sohman (Gumrag Paksong) - This dance is performed on the occasion of Ali-Aye-Leegang and in Mishing Bihu. Lotta Sohman - This dance is performed on any occasion, as an expression of joy or community celebration. Old and young, all join in these dances Marriage The Misings are a patrilineal and patriarchal society and so, as per customary law, only the male children are entitled to inherit the property of a family. However, daughters can inherit the clothes and jewelry of their mothers. Marriages amongst the Misings take place in four ways: formal marriages through negotiation, marriage by elopement, marriage through a very simple ceremony, and marriage by force (this was not a practice of the Mising tribe but was the mentality of the parents like other people too). The last one, in which a man makes a woman his wife against her will by whisking her away from someplace and starting to live together, is no longer in practice. Extreme poverty or inconvenience force families to arrange a marriage of the third kind, in which a few elders, invited to the house of the groom, bless the would-be couple over a few bowls of rice beer ‚Äì and the wedding is over. The most common form of marriage in rural areas even today is the one by elopement. When a boy is in love with a girl and intends to marry her, but cannot afford the cost of a formal marriage, or expects some opposition to the marriage from some quarter, or would like to start a conjugal life without delay, he chooses elopement with the girl as the best option. More often than not, marriages by elopement are followed by due social recognition through simple formalities. Formal marriages are arranged through two or three stages of negotiation, but although arranged by parents or guardians, the marriage of a boy and a girl totally unknown to each other, would be very rare. Formal marriages amongst them appear to have been influenced to a great extent by the practice of such marriages amongst their neighbors in the valley. It is now common for the educated and the well-to-do parents to perform the marriages of their children in the formal way. Polygamy is permissible as per customary law, but it is not looked upon as an act of honor anymore. Polyandry is unknown altogether. Widows or widowers can remarry. Customary law allows divorces, but they are not very common. It is also customary for a groom‚Äôs parents or guardians to pay bride price ‚Äì mostly nominal ‚Äì to the parents or guardians of the bride. Clan endogamy is taboo. Social structure The Misings believe in Abotani as their ancestor and is supposed to be a son of mother Sun and father Moon of the Heavenly abode. The Mising people inhabiting by the plains believe Gu:m√≠n as one of the earliest ancestors, the forefather of a lineal family of Abotani. The sons of Guhm√≠n are grouped in multiple opin, or clans, the names of which are represented by the existing surnames in the society. They are all blood-related brothers with a social restriction of the matrimonial relationship among them. The Misings have other groupings such as Moyengia, Oyengia, and Sayengia etc., which do not correlate to opin. Misings were also divided into Barogam and Dohgam, which was an administrative system introduced during Chutia Kingdom, but this system is no longer used. The concepts of Guhmin and Opin have remained the basis of Mising social structure. The Opin of Guhmin are all blood-related brothers known as urom bibosunam b√≠rrang, originating from a common ancestor father and there is no restriction in offering prayers in the rituals in common platform generations together. There is another form of brotherhood existing in the society which has been traditionally accepted as an affiliated brother or tomin sunam b√≠rrang from different opin. In both types of brotherhood marriage among themselves is forbidden in the society. The different opin include: Doley, Pegu, Bori, Gam, Charoh, Dao, Darig, Dang, Jimey, Kuli, Kutum, Kumbang, Kaman, Kardong, Kari, Lagachu, Loying, Modi, Moyong, Morang, Mili, Medok, Misong, Narah, Ngate, Pangging,Pasar,Perme, Pertin, Pait, Pagag, Patir, Patiri, Padi, Payeng, Payun, Pao, Padun, Regon, Ratan, Chungkrang, Chintey, Charoh, Taw, Taye, Taid, Tayeng, Tayung and Yein. There are further classification as Delu, Dagdung, Dagtok, Mohying, Padam, Pagro, Oyan. The traditional chief of a Mising village was called a Ga:m. He presided at the sittings of the village council, the Kebang, which deliberated upon different matters concerning the wellbeing of the village as well as complaints of individual members or groups in the community. The Kebang was the legal, judicial and executive authority of the community, although the final say on all matters, barring the ones relating to their faith, was that of the Ga:m. Cases of social and criminal offenses were heard by the Kebang, and persons found guilty were penalized. The Gam has been replaced with Gambura (gaonburha in mipak language) a petty village level agent of the government, since the days of the British. Kebang now denotes any organization, similar to sabha and sangha in other Indian languages. Housing A traditional Mising house is stilted. It has a thatched top and is patterned simply like the letter 'I.' It is built usually with wooden posts, beams, truss and supporting forks, but bamboo is used extensively for flooring and roofing. The more the number of nuclear families living in the same house, the longer the ‚Äò I ‚Äô would be. The granary is built a little close to the house and a cowshed too would not be far away. Mising villages are generally large in size, consisting of around fifty-to-sixty households on an average.  Clothing  Traditional Mising male dressThe traditional craft of weaving is a very important aspect of Mising culture. It is an exclusive preserve of the Mising woman, who starts her training in the craft even before she reaches her teens. All clothes the Mising wear are woven by the women of the household. Men wear cotton jackets (Mibu Galuk), light cotton towels, endi shawls, thick loin cloths, and, occasionally, even shirtings. Women wear a variety of clothes, depending on the occasion. The ege is a lower garment, comprising a sheet of cotton. Above this may be draped a ri:bi or Gaseng, both cotton sheets used to cover the ege and a blouse. However, while the ri:bi has narrow stripes, the gaseng has broad stripes of contrastive colours. Instead may be worn a Gero: a sheet, usually off-white, wrapped round the waist to cover the lower part of the body, or round the chest to cover the body down to the knees or so, or a seleng gasor: a light cotton sheet, worn occasionally instead of a ri:bi or a gaseng. Other forms of clothing include the riya, a long, comparatively narrow, sheet, wrapped, a bit tightly, round the chest. Married women will wear the segrek, a loose piece of cloth, wrapped round the waist to cover the ege down to the knees. Other accessories inlcude a po:tub: a scarf used to protect the head, and nisek: a piece of cloth to carry a baby with. Before yarn, produced by modern textile factories, was available in the market, Misings used to grow cotton and obtain cotton yarn by spinning. The use of endi yarn, obtained from worms fed on leaves of castor-oil plants, was once common amongst them. However, they have learnt the use of muga (silk obtained from silkworms fed on a kind of tall tree, called som in Assamese) and of paat (silk obtained from silkworms fed mulberry leaves) from neighbouring indigenous communities in the valley. Even now Mising women weave cloths, using muga and paat silk, very sparingly. Thus weaving cotton clothes is the principal domain of the Mising weaver. She has good traditional knowledge of natural dyes. The Mising also have a special and complex blanket called gadu, fluffy on one side, and woven on a traditional loin loom. The warp consists of cotton spun into thick and strong yarn, and the weft of cotton turned into soft yarn and cut into small pieces for insertion, piece by piece, to form the fluff. Weaving a gadu is a very laborious affair like weaving expensive carpets, requiring the weaver to spend a lot of time on her loin loom, and, as the younger women in a family would, generally, not have enough time for such a work, it is the aging ones staying at home that do it. There has been a drastic decline of the gadu craft during the years after independence because of the availability of inexpensive blankets in the market. Economy Agriculture is the lifeblood of the economy of the Misings. They grow different varieties of rice paddy, some of which they sow in spring for harvesting in summer, some others being transplanted during the rainy season and harvested in autumn. They also grow mustard, pulses, maize, vegetables, tobacco, bamboo, areca, etc., chiefly for their own use, with the exception of mustard, which brings them some cash. Generally speaking, they are poor horticulturists. The women contribute to the income of the family by rearing pigs, fowls and, occasionally, goats. They are buyers, not makers, of metallic utensils and jewelry. They are also not known for carpentry. However, they make almost all the tools required for their day-to-day life, such as baskets, carry bags, trays, boxes, fish traps of various kinds, hencoops, etc., using bamboo and cane as material. The wooden items they make include their boat-shaped mortar and the pestle, and, of course, canoes, so indispensable for riparian people living in flood-prone areas. Today a small percentage of their population have different categories of jobs, especially in the public sector, small trading, etc. as sources of income Religion The Misings follow their own traditions, sometimes called Donyi Polo viz, the Sun and the Moon God. They are still mainly animists and adopted some aspects of Vaishnavism after the bhakti movement that was started by Sankardev. They believe in different supernatural beings haunting the earth, usually unseen. These supernatural beings fall into four categories: uyu or ui - usually malevolent spirits inhabiting the waters, the woods, the skies, etc. capable of causing great harm including physical devastation, urom po-sum - hovering spirits of the dead, who may cause illness or other adverse conditions, guhmeen-sohing - benevolent ancestral spirits, and epom-yapom - spirits inhabiting tall, big trees, who are generally not very harmful, but who may abduct human beings occasionally, cause some physical or mental impairment and release them later. Barring the epom-yapom, all the supernatural beings need to be propitiated with sacrificial offerings (usually domestic fowl), both periodically and on specific occasions of illness, disaster, etc. Even the benevolent guardian spirits are propitiated from time to time for the all- round wellbeing of a household. Nature worship as such is not a common practice amongst Misings. But the god of thunder is propitiated from time to time, and although not worshipped or propitiated, the Sun (who they call Ane- Donyi ‚ÄòMother Sun‚Äô) and the Moon (who they call Abu Polo ‚ÄòFather Moon‚Äô) are invoked on all auspicious occasions. The leader of their animistic faith is called a mibu (also called miri earlier), their priest or medicine man, who is supposed to be born with special powers of communion with supernatural beings. While mibus are on their way out amongst the Misings owing to the introduction of modern education and healthcare amongst them, propitiation of supernatural beings continue to mark their religious life. In addition, they have embraced in the valley some kind of a monotheistic Hinduism as passed on to them by one of the sects of the Vaishnavism of Sankardeva (1449-1568 A.D.), the saint-poet of Assam. As faiths, the two forms, animism, and Vaishnavism, are poles apart, but they have coexisted in the Mising society without any conflict whatsoever, primarily because of the fact that the form of Vaishnavism, as they have been practising it, has not interfered with their traditional customs (drinking rice beer and eating pork, or using them on socio-religious occasions, for instance). Their religious life in the valley has thus assumed a fully syncretistic character. Festivals Mising people celebrate various festivals, though, the two chief traditional festivals of the Misings are the Ali-Ay√©-L√≠gang, and the Po:rag, both connected with their agricultural cycle.Mising women dancing on Ali Ay√© L√≠gang Ali-Ay√©-L√≠gang is a festival marking the beginning of the sowing season, and marks the start of a new agricultural calendar. Ali-Ay√© means seeds in a row, and L√≠gang means sowing of seeds. Ali-Ay√©-L√≠gang starts on the second Wednesday of February, considered an auspicious day, and lasts for five days. Ali-Ay√©-L√≠gang is a five-day festival. The celebrations begin with the heads of families sowing ceremonially rice paddy seeds in a corner of their respective rice fields in the morning hours and praying for crop abundance. Young men and women participate in the occasion by singing and dancing at night in the courtyard of every household in the villages to the accompaniment of drums, cymbals, and a gong. The gong is not used on any festive occasion other than the Ali-Ay√© L√≠gang. Similarly, the drums have specific beats for this festival. The troupe accepts from each household offers of rice beer and fowls. After the singing and dancing in this way is over, the youths hold a feast on the third day. Po:rag is the post-harvest festival of the Misings. Harvesting of paddy rice in autumn is very common now amongst the Misings and so a Po:rag is usually observed now sometime in early winter or early spring. But there was a time when a harvest in summer too was very common amongst them and so Po:rag was celebrated earlier in the months of August or September also. It is a very expensive three-day festival (reduced to two days or even one these days, depending on the extent of preparation on the part of the organizers in terms of items of food and drinks) and so held once in two-to-three years or so. Entertainment during the celebrations is open to everyone, young and old, of the village, and invitations are also extended formally to many guests, including some people of neighbouring villages, to join the celebrations. More significantly, it is customary on this occasion to invite the women who hail from the village but have been married to men of other villages and places, far and near. This makes Po:rag a grand festival of reunion. Moreover, apart from the husbands of the women so invited, a group of young men and women, who can sing and dance, is expected to accompany each of them. No formal singing, dancing and drumming contests are organized, but the congregation of many singers, dancers, and drummers from different villages, in addition to the ones in the village, turns the festival into some kind of a friendly music and dance tournament, as it were. This has an amplifying effect on the air of joy that the festival exudes. The sole responsibility for organizing the festival is vested in a body of young men and women, called Meembir-yamey (literally, ‚Äòyoung women-young men‚Äô). The organization is run with a good degree of discipline, following the provisions of an unwritten but well-respected code of conduct. Erring individuals are given hearings and penalized if found guilty. Another occasion called Dobur is an animistic rite performed occasionally by the village community by sacrificing a sow and some hens for different purposes, such as to avert a likely crop failure and ensure general well being of the community, or to avert the evil effects of a wrongdoing on the part of a member of the community, etc. The form of observance of Dobur varies according to the purpose. In the most common form, the younger male members of a village beat the walls of every house in the village from one end to the other with big sticks to drive away the ghosts and goblins hiding in nook and corner and perform the sacrificial rite at some distance away from the village, and hold a feast there. Anyone passing unwittingly through the venue of the rite has to stop in the place till evening or pay a fine. Some of the features of Bihu dances, boys and girls dancing together for instance, may have been borrowed from the Misings.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 5, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn and Jake are forced to listen to The Ice King's fanfiction about the gender-swapped Fionna (voiced by Madeleine Martin) and Cake the cat (voiced by Roz Ryan). In his story, Fionna goes on a date with Prince Gumball (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) and fights the evil Ice Queen (voiced by Grey DeLisle). The concept of Fionna and Cake was based on sketches that series' character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri made. Ward was pleased with her creations, and decided to canonize them. Originally, the episode did not feature the Ice Queen at all, and the middle part of the episode saw Fionna go on a date with Gumball to a restaurant; this subsequently changed. The episode was watched by 3.315 million people, making it‚Äîat the time‚Äîthe most-watched episode of the series. \\"Fionna and Cake\\" received largely positive reviews from fans and critics alike. Two sequels to the episode‚Äî\\"Bad Little Boy\\" and \\"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\\"‚Äîwere produced during the show's fifth and sixth season, respectively as well as a comic book miniseries titled Adventure Time with Fionna and Cake published by kaBOOM. Plot Fionna and Cake are helping Prince Gumball decorate for the Biennial Gumball Ball when Gumball asks Fionna if she would like to go to it tonight with him. Their conversation is interrupted when the Ice Queen breaks into the castle and tries to kidnap Gumball. Fionna and Cake start to fight her before she mysteriously disappears. Gumball (who is apparently unharmed) arranges a date with Fionna. At the Tree Fort, Fionna and Cake argue over whether or not Gumball asked Fionna on a date. Cake decides to come along to help Fionna out. At the Castle Gardens, the two are met by Gumball and his steed Lord Monochromicorn. The group then flies through the air while Gumball serenades Fionna with the song \\"Oh, Fionna\\" and eventually asks her to be his girlfriend. When Fionna and Cake get to the ball, Prince Gumball takes Fionna to his room (decorated with candles and rose petals) and locks the door. She becomes flustered and backs away when he begins to take his shirt off. A drop of water lands on her shoulder, she looks up to see the real Prince Gumball trapped inside a giant icicle on the ceiling. The fake prince is revealed to be Ice Queen. Fionna is soon incapacitated; Cake senses trouble and rushes to her rescue. Enraged by the deception, Fionna takes out the crystal sword to fight. The sword turns out to be another one of Ice Queen‚Äôs tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna‚Äôs hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince Gumball free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees Gumball standing next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real Gumball asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment. The episode reveals that the entire story was a fanfiction created by the Ice King that he is reading to Finn and Jake (who are incapacitated in ice). The Ice King asks how they enjoyed his story; Finn hesitates at first but hurriedly placates him when Ice King threatens them with his ice powers. Cast Neil Patrick Harris voiced Prince Gumball in the episode \\"Fionna and Cake\\", taking place in a gender-swapped universe, likewise features gender- swapped versions of the inhabitants of Ooo. A list of the major characters that feature in \\"Fionna and Cake\\" follows. * Fionna (voiced by Madeleine Martin) ‚Äì Fionna is the gender-swapped version of Finn. Fionna is a brave and adventurous girl who struggles with issues pertaining to attraction and romance. * Cake (voiced by Roz Ryan) ‚Äì Cake is the gender-swapped version of Jake, and is a cat instead of a dog. Cake is sarcastic and boisterous but is also Fionna's loyal friend.Olson, p. 104 Much like Jake, she possesses the power to stretch her body into a myriad of convoluted shapes. * Prince Gumball (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) ‚Äì Gumball is the gender-swapped version of Princess Bubblegum.

While Lady speaks in Korean & English, Lord Monochromicorn communicates exclusively via Morse code. Lord Monochromicorn and Cake are in a relationship together. Production \\"Fionna and Cake\\" was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward; it was directed by Larry Leichliter. The genesis for the episode were drawings that character designer and storyboard revisionist Natasha Allegri posted online. Her creations were eventually canonized by the show's producers. Allegri even re-rerecorded the show's theme‚Äîwhich had originally been sung by series creator Pendleton Ward‚Äîfor the episode. Alt URL Sugar intended \\"Fionna and Cake\\" to both be \\"a jab [and] a huge celebration of, the feeling of being fan\\" and \\"allowing something completely ridiculous to make your heart tighten\\". Sugar and Muto significantly changed the story from its original outline, as the very first version of the episode did not feature the Ice Queen, the ball, or the crystal sword. The second act of the story featured Gumball and Fionna going on a date in a restaurant, rather than on an adventure. Sugar also wrote several lines for Marshall Lee‚ÄîMarceline's male counterpart‚Äîbut they were cut for time. Sugar \\"begged\\" Ward to let her work the character back into the story somehow, but the character only appeared in a non-speaking cameo. Sugar originally wanted the character to be voiced by Dante Basco, although he would later be voiced by Donald Glover in subsequent Fionna and Cake episodes. Neil Patrick Harris was Sugar's first choice to play Prince Gumball; she explained that she \\"wanted to impress [her] brother Steven, who was obsessed with the Music Meister\\" (portrayed by Harris) \\"from Batman: The Brave and the Bold at the time.\\" The scene which featured the song \\"Oh Fionna\\" was designed by Sugar to be a blend of the setting from the song \\"A Whole New World\\" from the 1992 film Aladdin, as well as scenes featuring the Romani Ranch aliens from the video game The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask (2000). Reception \\"Fionna and Cake\\" aired on Cartoon Network on September 5, 2011. The episode was viewed by 3.315 million viewers and saw a dramatic increase in the ratings for all boy demographics. It also marked a 42 percent increase in viewers when compared to a year earlier. At the time, this made \\"Fionna and Cake\\" the highest-rated entry of the series. The episode first saw physical release as part of the 2013 Fionna and Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' first three seasons. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk praised the episode for its creativity and complimented the entry's humor and its message to girls. Furthermore, he applauded the song \\"Oh Fionna\\", calling it \\"wonderful\\". Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle noted that the episode was \\"an adventure in cross play\\". He felt that Fionna's characterization appealed to the show's universality and managed to also retain respect for the show's audience. and that the \\"strong but emotionally vulnerable\\" Cake was written in a way that successfully provided a female analog for Jake. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club called the \\"Fionna and Cake\\" one of \\"the most fascinating aspects of the Adventure Time craze\\" in a review of the fifth season episode \\"Bad Little Boy\\". He wrote that \\"'Fionna and Cake' was reminiscent of the series' earlier episodes, in regards to its bright animation, well-paced plot, music, its successful blend of fantasy action and comedy, and its focus on character- based drama. As a result, he felt that the entry was composed of elements that make the series as a whole great. In a separate article, Sava named the entry one of the ten most representative episodes of the series and wrote that it is also \\"the most aggressively girl-friendly episode of the series\\". After it aired, \\"Fionna and Cake\\" was particularly successful with the fans of the series. Sava noted that although the characters had, at the time, appeared in only a single episode, they had rapidly become among the series' most popular characters. According to the Entertainment Examiner, fans of the series responded positively to the characters, and wanted them to appear in more episodes.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and Rebecca Sugar, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on September 26, 2011. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, Finn, Jake, Princess Bubblegum, and Marceline the Vampire Queen form a band in order to defeat the Door Lord and recover what the creature had stolen from them. Sugar noted that while the episode may appear to be about friendship, it is really about the power of telling the truth, as exemplified by the episode's songs. Episode composer Tim Kiefer played all of the conventional instruments himself, and used unique instruments, like a Game Boy, to make some of the loops heard in the episode. The episode was watched by 2.185 million people and caused a controversy due to the suggestion of an intimate (and possibly romantic) history between Marceline and Bubblegum, a fact that also garnered praise for the episode from several LGBTQ-oriented review sites. Plot Jake and BMO decide to give Finn some \\"alone time\\" with him and his piece of Bubblegum's hair, which he acquired in the second season episode \\"To Cut a Woman's Hair\\". However, a Door Lord suddenly materializes and snatches the lock, along with Jake's beloved blanket, and BMO's controller. Finn and Jake chase through the creature's various doors, stumbling upon Princess Bubblegum and Marceline, who both appear to be victims of the Door Lord's theft. Finally, the Door Lord jumps through a door that the group is unable to get past. They realize that they must sing a song to pass through the door; the group decides to create a band. Jake gets his viola, and Marceline retrieves her bass. Princess Bubblegum decides to play BMO as an 8-bit instrument, and Finn beat-boxes. Tensions amongst the band members, however, boil over. Marceline sings a song (\\"I'm Just Your Problem\\") lamenting her and Bubblegum's estranged relationship, which almost opens the door, due to it being a song based on truth. Marceline and Bubblegum begin arguing, and Jake joins in; the band disbands. Finn, dismayed at his friends' behavior, sings \\"My Best Friends in the World\\", bemoaning the fact that his friends are fighting. Bubblegum, Marceline, and Jake join in, and the four are able to open the door. Inside, Finn, Jake, and BMO reacquire their belongings. The group also finds a black rock T-shirt which they mistake to be Marceline's. However, it is revealed that it is Bubblegum's; it was a gift given to her by Marceline in the past. Finally the group turn to Marceline, asking what she had lost. When they realise she only wanted to spend time with the friends, Marceline feels embarrassed and chases Finn, Jake, BMO and Bubblegum from the Door Lord's abode. Production Episode composer Tim Kiefer used a Game Boy to make some of the percussion loops heard in the episode. \\"What Was Missing\\" was written and storyboarded by Rebecca Sugar and Adam Muto from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. The episode was directed by Larry Leichliter, with Cole Sanchez serving as creative director and Nick Jennings serving as art director. The original title for the episode was \\"Door Jam\\", but this was later changed because, according to Muto, the show tries to avoid pun-based titles. \\"What Was Missing\\" was Sugar and Muto's second episode dealing with Marceline (the first being \\"It Came from the Nightosphere\\" from season two), and because of this, Sugar \\"wanted to get it right\\". Sugar later explained on her Tumblr that, \\"It might seem like this episode is about friendship, but I wanted it to be about honesty! Marceline almost gets the door open because she drops her guard and tells the truth for a second while she sings this song.\\" She later likened the theme of the episode to a quote by Bob Fosse‚Äî‚ÄúThe time to sing is when your emotional level is too high to just speak anymore\\"‚Äînoting that she \\"really wanted to try for that feeling.\\" All of the songs featured in the episode were initially composed by Sugar, who released her demo version of \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\" on her official Tumblr page. Her father, Rob, later released the demos for both \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\" and \\"My Best Friends in the World\\" on YouTube. \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\" was actually the last song written for the episode; Sugar was down to the last minute, and as such, she argued that her emotionally exhausted state informed her songwriting. The song was inspired by an incident that Sugar had experienced with a former roommate. Although the two often fought, Sugar desperately wanted them to be friends despite not particularly liking her. Sugar transferred this situation onto Marceline, writing the song so that Marceline‚Äîwhile having issues with Princess Bubblegum‚Äîwanted to become her friend. \\"My Best Friends in the World\\" was written by Sugar as a celebration of the friendship she shared with her coworkers, especially her storyboarding partner, Muto. Ward later admitted on the commentary track for \\"What Was Missing\\" that, while he was editing the animatic for the episode, he started to cry because the songs featured in the episode were so full of emotion. Adventure Time composer, Tim Kiefer, played the instruments featured in the episode himself. To complement the tones of the bass and viola, he created percussion sounds with Game Boy loops, and then used an autochord for \\"Princess Bubblegum's melodies\\" to make \\"pretty, melodic swoops to accompany BMO's rigid, robotic patterns, loops, and structures.\\"Basichis, Casey James (Composer). 2012. \\"Adventure Time Music With Time + Casey\\" [Featurette], Adventure Time Season One [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: Cartoon Network. Reception \\"What Was Missing\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on September 26, 2011. The episode was viewed by 2.185 million viewers and scored a 0.4 Nielsen rating in the 18‚Äì49-year-old demographic. This means it was seen by 0.4 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episodes' airing. Tyler Foster of DVD Talk called the episode a \\"highlight\\" of the Fionna & Cake DVD. Specifically, he praised the song \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\", calling it both a \\"fan favorite\\" and \\"significant as the moment I decided I was a fan\\". Dana Piccoli of AfterEllen.com enjoyed the way the episode \\"alluded to perhaps, more than platonic feelings between\\" Princess Bubblegum and Marceline, as well as the fact that \\"What Was Missing\\" was underlined by potential lesbian \\"subtext\\". The A.V. Club named the episode one of the ten additional installments of the series that illustrates that \\"emotional complexity\\" lies \\"beneath Adventure Times weirdness\\". Controversy \\"What Was Missing\\" became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum. The controversy largely began after an accompanying \\"Mathematical\\" recap‚Äîa behind the scenes video series produced by Frederator Studios that implied that there were lesbian relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans. This incident was addressed by Fred Seibert, the show's executive producer, who said that \\"in trying to get the show‚Äôs audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far.\\" Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of YouTube, although \\"What Was Missing\\" still airs during reruns. Alt URL Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; Bitch magazine later wrote an article about how the episode \\"handled female desire‚Äîfemale queer desire at that‚Äîin a subtle but complex way\\", and that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television. Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view, saying that, because there were \\"so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet\\", he did not \\"really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo.\\" In August 2014, Marceline's voice actress Olivia Olson told a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes & Noble book signing from The Adventure Time Encyclopedia, that, according to Ward, Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself. In the finale of Adventure Time, \\"Come Along with Me\\"which aired on September 3, 2018the relationship was officially confirmed when Marceline and Princess Bubblegum shared a kiss. Media release The episode was first physically released as part of the 2013 Fionna & Cake DVD, which included 16 episodes from the series' second, third, and fourth seasons. It was later re-released as part of the complete third season DVD in February 2014. In addition, the 2015 limited edition 12\\" vinyl record release Marceline the Vampire Queen Rock the Nightosphere included \\"I'm Just Your Problem\\" alongside other songs sung by Marceline.

It was founded in 1933. Most of the previous piano bars closed upwards of thirty years ago. The bar looks like a saloon or 1920s alleyway with wood shingles and windows in the interior. Writer Kimberly Chun has described the interior as being designed by \\"a drunken Walt Disney\\". It has booths throughout it similar to those found at a diner. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 business cards from visitors are displayed all over the walls, attached with staples. Business cards from Jerry Brown and Gregg Allman can be found. Dinner, which is served nightly, focuses on American cuisine such as steaks and burgers. An average steak dinner costs around $10. A piano is located past the main bar surrounded by a lacquered wood bar. Twelve seats sit at the bar and a pianist sits on the far end. Songbooks and microphones also rest on the bar. They primarily play songs from the Great American Songbook. The bar used to be owned by Jody Kerr, who owned it from the 1940s until her death in 1995. Kerr's relative Jackie Simpkins owns the bar today. When she became the owner she wanted to remove the business cards, but the regular bar guests protested. In order to keep in compliance with the fire code, the bar sprays the business cards with fire retardant. In 2010, an apartment next to The Alley caught on fire. The fire destroyed the apartment but did not spread to the bar. Rod Dibble Pianist and singer Rod Dibble performed nightly at the bar until his death in December 2017. Visitors to the bar could sing solos accompanied by Dibble. He started playing piano in 1938 when he was six years of age. He performed at The Alley for over fifty years starting in 1960. Dibble walked to practice ten miles every day. He often practiced at the Claremont Resort or the Berkeley Marina. When he practiced, he played in 10-minute increments and learned one new song a week. He knew more than 4,000 songs by heart and changed the key based on the participating singer. San Francisco Chronicle writer Peter Hartlaub describes Dibble's voice as a mix of \\"Louis Armstrong and Tom Waits on the raspy spectrum.\\" He played a Baldwin piano. When a participating singer did exceptionally well Dibble ringed a cowbell in their honor. When a participating singer made his or her debut at singing at The Alley, Dibble ringed a much smaller bell in honor of the singer being an \\"Alley Virgin\\" regardless of whether the singer did exceptionally well. In the 1980s, Dibble accepted a recurring request, providing \\"frontier-style\\" incidental piano accompaniment to the poem \\"The Shooting of Dan McGrew\\", recited by \\"Tex\\", a regular patron who said he was a Texas Ranger. Dibble was married, had two children and four grandchildren. He lived in Berkeley. When asked if he would ever retire, Dibble stated \\"I'll never retire, I'll be very happy to die right behind this piano here.\\" Reception The Alley has been mentioned in travel and restaurant guides to Oakland and the San Francisco Bay Area. The book, GrassRoutes Travel Guide to Oakland: The Soul of the City Next Door, said of The Alley that it was \\"an old-time alternative to karaoke\\" and that it represented \\"Oakland at its friendliest.\\" The bar attracted \\"a wacky mix of hams and crooners\\", said the Lonely Planet, and there were no beers on draft but the mixed drinks were \\"strooooong.\\" Rough Guides listed The Alley as a bar in 2003 then as a live music venue in 2011. A guide to dive bars in the San Francisco Bay Area listed The Alley among five of Oakland's best dive bars, the group including Smitty's, a local bar several doors up the street from The Alley.

Founded in 1913, College of the Holy Spirit Manila was established originally as Holy Ghost College through the invitation of then Manila Archbishop Jeremias Harty. Located originally at Legarda Street, the present campus is now located in the historic Mendiola Street, inside the Malaca√±an Palace Complex. It is one of the schools which comprises the Mendiola Consortium (MC) for academic cooperation along with Centro Escolar University Manila, La Consolacion College Manila, San Beda College Manila, and St. Jude Catholic School. Initially the school admitted only girls but in 2005 started admitting male students for the high school department and the following year for the college department when the Nursing program decided to accept male students. The college offers academic programs for high school, undergraduate courses, post-graduate degrees and short-term certificate programs. The undergraduate programs include course in Arts and Education, Business, Fine Arts and Health Sciences. Post-graduate courses include master's degree in Business Administration, Business Administration for Health Professionals, Tourism and Hospitality Management, Guidance and Counseling, and Special Education. The school also offers professional courses in Special Education, Caregiver Program and Women Leadership. Starting in the 2013 school year, it also opened two new short courses in Digital Arts and Gerontology. In 1957, College of the Holy Spirit Manila became one of the founding charter member of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU) to ensure the quality of education. Since then, the college undergoes voluntary accreditation. And the last March 6‚Äì7, 2013 the college was re-accredited. CHSM was granted Level III re- accreditation status for arts, sciences and business programs by PAASCU with five years validity until 2018, which deviates to the normal three-year validity. As a SSpS school, for 98 years it was administered by SSpS religious sisters. On 11 June 2011, the SSpS Philippines North Provincial Leadership entrusted the administration of the school to its alumna Dr. Felina Co-Young, making her the first lay woman president of the college. The SSpS sisters remain in the school as heads of different administrative departments and as instructors. History The foundation of the College of the Holy Spirit Manila was through a mistaken response to an anonymous letter with a five- dollar bill. The SSpS sisters in Tayum of the province of Abra, Philippines thought it was from then Manila Archbishop Jeremias Harty, and thus sent a letter of gratitude to the Archbishop. The prelate responded that it was not from him but, pleased with the sisters, he invited them to start a free school for the poor street children of Manila. During the period, Archbishop Harty was calling religious orders to establish Catholic schools in Manila to preempt the spread of Protestantism in his archdiocese. Finally, after a year of stay in Tayum, Abra, the pioneer Sisters moved to No. 663 Legarda Street in Manila to establish the Holy Ghost School on 17 June 1913 as a response to the invitation of the Archbishop. Holy Ghost College Five SSpS sisters were sent to a small house in Manila to start the second school of the congregation in the Philippines. Sisters Heronima, Sebastiana, Ludwiga, Laetitia and Gerena gave the nickname Holy Ghost College for their foundation, the Holy Ghost College (HGC). Dubbed by their benefactor Archbishop Harty as \\"the poorest children of Manila,\\" he donated several furniture for the use of the school. At the start of the school, it had 23 primary school pupils enrolled in the first semester and during the second semester it grew to 93 students. American Governor-General of the Philippines Francis Burton Harrison through the Division Superintendent of Schools granted Government Recognition and Permit to Operate in 1915. As years went on, enrollment increased such that the Sisters need to rent the neighboring house for them to hold classes. In 1919, there were a total of 274 grade-school pupils. Mendiola property As the school opened the secondary (high school) department, there was a need for expansion. Thus, the 12,000-square-meter present campus located on the intersections of E. Mendiola Street, J.P Laurel Street, and C. Aguila Street was bought on 7 July 1920. With the buildings already constructed, the school was moved to the Mendiola property on 25 March 1922. In 1924, HGC became the Provincial Motherhouse of the SSpS congregation in the Philippines until it was finally moved in Poinsettia Street, New Manila, Quezon City in 1945. The first batch of high school students graduated in March 1924. On 2 April 1925, the college department started when it was given government recognition to operate with a two-year course, Associate in Art. In 1928, three Bachelor's Degree programs were offered: Liberal Arts, Preparatory Law, and Education. In 1932, it added BS Home Economics and BA Fine Arts and, in 1936, BS Commerce and the Secretarial Course. Two years later, the Master of Arts in Education was introduced in 1938. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines in 1941, the school operation was interrupted when the Japanese Army requisitioned some of the school's buildings. When schooling resumed in 1943, the classes were crammed in the remaining buildings and some neighbor houses. In 1944, Bachelor of Music was offered with various majors through the years: piano, organ, violin, marimba, voice, and others. After the war, new buildings were constructed as student population grew more: Elementary Building (1947), Paraclete Auditorium (1948), Canteen (1949), College Building (1956), College Building-Annex (1961‚Äì62), the College Library Annex (1964), New Elementary Building (1966), and the College Cafeteria (1970). The college department continued to offer new courses. Thus, five major academic departments were formed in 1951, namely, Liberal Arts Education, Home Economics (later changed to Nutrition and Dietetics), Fine Arts, Commerce, and Science. During the 1950s, maintaining that there was need for a higher level of collegiate excellence than that required by the Bureau of Education, 11 Catholic Educational Association of the Philippines (CEAP) institutions, HGC being one of them, spearheaded a voluntary accreditation. Thus, in 1957, HGC underwent its first survey visit for accreditation and became a charter and founding member of the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU). The Science Department opened three more courses in 1963: BS in Medical Technology, Pre-Nursing, and Pre-Medicine. During the celebration of its Golden Jubilee in 1963, the college made major curricular changes. Some degree programs were phased out while new major fields in the basic programs were introduced. Organization In line with the congregational decision of lay empowerment and consistent with the liberating education thrust of the College of the Holy Spirit, Administration adopted participatory management in 1991. Three clusters (Academic, Internal and External Relations, and Administrative) made up the President's Council of ten (10) members in 1991-94. The reorganization in 1995 increased the participation of middle managers through the academic and non-academic offices/councils. The 16 members of Academic Council was composed of nine (9) area chairpersons and the Dean of Academic Affairs who was ex-officio chair. In 1997, the Non-Academic Council (later named Administrative Council) was organized to serve as a clearing house for the various concerns of the student services and support offices. Global studies CHSM's network in the global village was initiated in 1989 with the Culture and Language Program of Seirei Women's Junior College, Akita, Japan. In 1995, International Education Specialist, College of the Holy Spirit and the Swiss Association Hotel Management School of Le Roche, Switzerland forged a Memorandum of Agreement \\"One-Year Study Abroad Program\\" for BSHRM students. For two successive years, students went to Switzerland (4 in 1995 and 5 in 1996). In 2000, BSHRM students also participated in the Practicum Program in Australia. In 1998 CHS, Inter-Ed and College of St. La Salle in Montreal agreed to offer a \\"One-Year Study Abroad Program\\" for Fine Arts Students of the College of the Holy Spirit. In 1999, the President's Council reviewed the functions and the scope of responsibilities of the Dean of Non-Academic Affairs and decided that the title Dean of Non-Academic Affairs be changed to a more appropriate title‚ÄîDean of Administrative Affairs, the functions of which would include student affairs. In 2003-2004, the Board of Trustees approved the re-creation of the Office of the Dean for Student Affairs. In 2003, practical training of CHS students from different disciplines, HRM, Tourism, International Studies and Communication Arts was facilitated by First Place Inc. Second and Third year students take their summer work and study program in the United States. This was further enhanced by the signing in March 2005 of a Memorandum of Agreement between the CHSM President and the Presidents of four other schools: University of the Philippines (UP), San Sebastian College, St. Paul College and Philippine Women's University (PWU) with the Swiss Education Group for students to undertake training in Montreux Institute, Montreux, Switzerland. Reception The college has received Level III Accreditation, the second highest possible level, from the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAASCU). It was granted full autonomous status by the Commission on Higher Education of the Philippines in 2003. It received the National Consumers Quality Award as the Top Exclusive Catholic School for Girls in 2003.Official prospectus, College of the Holy Spirit, 2006. Alumnae In the mid-1950s, the Alumnae Association was formed which supported the Holy Spirit pre-school in Maria Clara, Sampaloc, Manila, as well as other projects. In the mid-1980s, the outgoing Board of Trustees members of the CHS Alumnae Foundation who have been involved in community service for the resettled urban poor from Smokey Mountain (later relocated to Bulihan), organized the Paraclete Foundation, Inc., now on its 25th year. Alumnae in North America formed themselves into the College of the Holy Spirit North America Foundation (CHSNAF), which endeavours to assist the College to improve its facilities. Basic needs of the less fortunate, especially need for proper housing, has been responded to through Habitat for Humanity and \\"Gawad Kalinga\\". The local CHS Alumnae foundation as well as the different batches have always been supportive of the school and have recently launched the \\"Adopt a Scholar Project\\"-100 scholars for 100 years.

Remnants of the Long Jetty are just visible in front to the groyne and behind the Old Kerosene Store. Fremantle Long Jetty was constructed in 1873 to replace the smaller South Jetty which had become too small for the large amounts of vessels entering the colony in Western Australia. The jetty lies in Bather's Bay which has been an occupation site since the Swan River Colony was established in 1829. It was a centre of trade and communications that served Fremantle and Perth until Fremantle Harbour was opened. An increased amount of shipping made it necessary to improve the harbouring facilities by the late 1860s. Long Jetty was built as a less expensive alternative to building a harbour at the mouth of the Swan River due to a lack of funds and technological shortcomings.Garratt, D. The Long Jetty: A Case Study in Salvage Archaeology, Department of Maritime Archaeology, Western Australian Maritime Museum, No. 57, 1990 In July 1984 the Maritime Archaeology Department of the Western Australian Museum was notified of plans to construct a marina for the 1987 America's Cup that would be close to the remains of the Long Jetty. This prompted an archaeological excavation to ascertain the importance of the site. History Construction on the Long Jetty in Fremantle was finished in 1873. This new jetty replaced the original South Jetty that was built in 1857.Garratt, D. The Long Jetty Excavation 14 July to 20 August 1984: A Report on the Long Jetty Excavation. Department of Maritime Archaeology Western Australia Museum, No. 78, Western Australia, 1994 The Long Jetty was originally known as the Ocean Jetty and the original section was built out of jarrah wood by Mason, Bird and Co., who owned the Canning Saw Mills.Hitchcock, J. K. & J. W. B. Stevens, The History of Fremantle: the Front Gate of Australia, 1829 - 1929, Fremantle City Council, 1929 The jetty extended south- west from Anglesea Point. From the 1870s to the 1920s the Long Jetty in Bathers Bay was an important maritime centre for the colony of Western Australia. It served as the region‚Äôs point of access for trade and communication until it was replaced by the opening of Fremantle Harbour in 1897. The original jetty construction was 15 feet wide and extended to a length of 750 feet. At its original size vessels weighing up to 700 tons could be accommodated, but larger vessels were forced to anchor offshore and have their cargo ferried in on smaller boats. The main commodities exported from the colony were wool, wheat, and timber. All of these materials were shipped in large vessels that could not be directly loaded from the jetty and required the use of smaller vessels for loading purposes. In December 1887 the jetty was extended to a length of 2,387 feet and the original south-westerly section was widened to 42 feet. This would allow six large vessels to be berthed at one time in water that was deeper than provided by the original structure. This addition led to the Ocean Jetty becoming known as the Long Jetty. In 1896 a final extension stretched the jetty an additional 457 feet out into the ocean. This extension was brought about due to the difficulty of lightering. With a total length of 3,294 feet, it was possible to facilitate eight large ships at once; however, lightering was still required. Evidence states that the original jetty was too shallow for most ocean-going vessels and lengthened multiple times, but never reached an adequate length. It was always necessary to use lighters to help with the removal of cargo from larger vessels. Of the 600,000 tons of materials that went through the Long Jetty in 1897, over one third of the materials required lightering with smaller vessels. In 1897 the jetty was a total of one kilometre in length and reached a total depth of only 7 metres at its furthest end.McCarthy, M. The archaeology of the Jetty: an examination of jetty excavations and 'port-related structure' studies in Western Australia since 1984. Bulletin of the Australasian Institute of Maritime Archaeology, No. 26, 2002 The two extensions were built by R.O. Law and Mathew Price. In 1887, when the contract was first given to R.O. Law, he was still a minor. R.O. Law was also given the task of demolishing Fremantle Long Jetty after it was considered a hazard to pedestrians. In the early 1890s, during the Australian gold rushes, Long Jetty reached a period of maximum use whereby ships where constantly coming and going. Even at its full length, it was necessary to use lightering with smaller vessels to bring in many of the shipments. The opening of Fremantle Harbour eliminated the need for lightering and helped to make Long Jetty obsolete as an importing and exporting structure. Disuse The Fremantle Jetty fell into disuse in the late 1890s due to the creation of the new Fremantle Harbour. Other factors also played a role in the demise of the Fremantle Long Jetty including the weather, geographical issues, and problems with how the port operated. All of these factors and more made the jetty a failure. It is also apparent that the users of this jetty found it and the port of Fremantle to be unsatisfactory. In 1892 in a letter to the owners of the Saranac, Captain D.B. Shaw wrote: ‚ÄúGentleman, I have been in a good many places in my time, but this is the worst damn hole I ever saw. The stevedores are half drunk all the time and don‚Äôt care what they do. The ship has to feed them and give them all the money and tobacco they want or they will make trouble. They are a dirty lot.‚Äù One week later on 19 November 1892 he wrote again: ‚ÄúI was never so sick of a place in my life, and may the curse of Christ rest on Fremantle and every son of a bitch in it. God damn them all. I remain gentlemen, your obedient servant.‚Äù In 1904, after a period of abandonment, the jetty was turned into a promenade. In 1906 a hall was built at one end for entertainment purposes. The new incarnation of the jetty was unpopular with the public and by 1910 it was closed off and fell into a state of disrepair. In 1921 it was completely demolished except for its piles that remained in place but were cut down lower to the ocean floor. Municipal Baths During the 1890s the Municipal Sea Baths became a popular destination as a public bathing site with several popping up around Perth and the foreshores of Fremantle. The Municipal Sea Baths were located between Long Jetty and South jetty and were demolished in 1917. The Municipal Sea Baths are now covered by a sea-wall associated with the Fishing Boat Harbour. Archaeological excavations The jetty received renewed interest with antique bottle collectors in the late 1960s as the ocean floor surrounding the jetty was covered with soda and beer bottles. Bottle collectors had frequently visited the site since its use was discontinued, but it was noticed that storms would reveal new materials from under the sea bed.McCarthy, M. The Ocean Jetty: The Colonial Beer Garden? Australian Archaeology No. 24, 1987, p. 32 - 35 The remains of the site were frequently visited by Scuba divers for recreation or bottle collecting. The site is pockmarked by holes dug by these collectors. These collectors had removed almost everything that is deemed attractive material leaving only broken pieces scattered across the site. In 1984 plans for a new marina that would facilitate the 1987 America's Cup threatened to bury large sections of what remained of Long Jetty. After many years of disuse, the jetty had been reduced to a row of piles that were barely visible above water except for one which remained exposed, three metres out of the water. The Western Australian Maritime Museum was only given a four-week notice to record the site before construction on the new marina would commence. This was because construction plans for the new marina involved covering a large portion of the old jetty. Archaeological investigations were headed by Michael McCarthy from the Department of Maritime Archaeology at the Western Australian Maritime Museum. The excavation was essentially a case of salvage archaeology; therefore, the museum instigated immediate assessment of the impact that a marina would have on the old jetty. The Aims for the excavation were described as ‚Äòmapping the remaining jetty structure to ascertain the spread of material and to gauge the extent to which it could later be covered or disturbed by the [marina] development. Archaeological work included plotting the jetty piles with the use of triangulation and photography in order to create a map of the site. McCarthy was allocated a budget of $2,000 to conduct the excavations on the Long Jetty. Due to the low funding available to McCarthy, volunteers from the Maritime Archaeological Association of Western Australia (MAAWA), a volunteer organisation intent on furthering protection and education about maritime sites, were used due to their experience with swim-line searches and archival research. There were also other volunteers who came from a local high school who were on work experience. These MAAWA divers were responsible for conducting swim-line searches of the sea floor for any artefacts and high concentrations of artefacts were marked by buoys which would require further investigation from the Museum staff. $1,315 of the $2,000 was spent on the excavation phase. Because of time constraints, McCarthy implemented the use of airlift and propeller wash excavation methods to shift sediment. Seventy test excavation holes were created to excavate the site. Most of the artifacts found during the excavations were made of glass originating from Australia or Great Britain, but some of the glass materials were from the United States of America. All of the bottles recovered from the excavation were found to be from a date range of 1840 to 1920. Alcohol and soft drink bottles were the most common types of bottles discovered, but pickle, sauce, and medicine containers were also frequently excavated on the site. The most common type of bottle found was a champagne style bottle which is similar to those used today. Artefacts A large number of artifacts were recovered from the site during the excavations. Most of the artefacts were covered by a protective layer of sediment up to 2 metres deep. Artefacts recovered included buttons, buckles, fasteners, rings, toys, pipes, munitions, shoes, fishing equipment, and other materials. A sample of artefacts were catalogued and conserved for public display. Seeing as the site was so close to the Maritime Museum, recovered artefacts were placed in tubs of fresh water to start the desalination process, while fragile artefacts were wrapped in soft nylon mesh to protect them from damage during the short transit to the Museum. Exhibition Soon after the excavation was completed, the Western Australian Maritime Museum opened an exhibition pertaining to the Long Jetty in an effort to educate the public about its history. The publicity that was generated through the excavations, public education, and press articles were sufficient enough to change the designs of the marina wall so that it would miss the jetty piles, thereby protecting the remains of the Long Jetty from destruction. However, a small section of the jetty would still be affected. Now The jetty is one of the most tangible links to the past and represents a valuable historic resource which can help to look at the economic and social evolution of the city of Fremantle. The site is also important due to its link with the immigration of people into Western Australia. Joan Campbell created illustrated ceramic plaques detailing the work of the museum as well as the history of the Fremantle Long Jetty that were placed at the beach end of the structure. The area is now used for public recreation activities. Remains of the Long Jetty are still visible with approximately 30 of the original piles protruding from the surface of the water. Legislation In 1988 the sea bed surrounding the section of the jetty that was built before 1900 was designated a historic site. This was implemented as a requirement under the Maritime Archaeology Act of 1973. The Act required that all areas of the sea- bed underneath jetties in Western Australia be designated as maritime archaeological sites if the jetty was used before 1900. This meant that the Act encapsulated basically all of the area where the Long Jetty stood.

His most famous novel, it chronicles inter-generational conflict between old ways and progressive aspirations in an upper-class family in the city of Chengdu, a prosperous but provincial city in the fertile Sichuan basin in the early 1920s following the New Culture Movement. The novel was wildly popular among China's youth and established the author as a leading voice of his generation. The novel was first serialized in 1931-2 and then released in a single volume in 1933. The original title was Turbulent Stream (ÊøÄÊµÅ Jƒ´li√∫), but changed after Ba Jin released it as a single volume. Synopsis The novel focuses on three brothers from the Gao family, Juexin, Juemin and Juehui, and their struggles with the oppressive autocracy of their fengjian and patriarchal family. The idealistic, if rash Juehui, the youngest brother, is the main protagonist, and he is frequently contrasted with the weak eldest brother Juexin, who gives in to the demands from his grandfather, agrees to an arranged marriage and carries on living a life he does not like to live. Characters * Gao Juexin (T: È´òË¶∫Êñ∞, S: È´òËßâÊñ∞, P: GƒÅo Ju√©xƒ´n, W: Kao Ch√ºeh-hsin) - The eldest brother, who was forced into quitting his university studies and into marrying a woman other than the one he loved. ** Juexin obeys the Gao family, despite the disapproval from his two brothers. Even though Juexin is in love with Mei, his cousin, he marries Li Ruijue on the orders of Master Gao after he graduates from middle school. After Juemin escapes from the Gao household, Master Gao asks Juexin to find Juemin. Juexin asks Juehui to help him, but the youngest brother accuses Juexin of being a coward. After learning about Mei's death, Juexin is saddened.Han, p. 260. Han said that \\"[t]he miserable experience\\" awakens Juexin, who begins opposing Master Gao.Han, p. 261. ** Mei Han, author of the entry on \\"Family\\" in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that Juexin \\"is a victim of conservatism\\" who is asked to stop observing idealism, loses the women who are dear to him, and \\"does nothing but cries in the corner.\\" Jin Feng, author of The New Woman in Early Twentieth-Century Chinese Fiction, said that Juexin is \\"a character used by a foil to impress upon the reader Juehui's revolutionary courage as compared to people of his own generation and gender.\\"Feng, p. 90. Feng added that while Juehui believes that Juexin is a '\\"coward who makes \\"unnecessary sacrifices\\" of himself and the women he loves', Juehui \\"cannot help but sympathize with Juexin dilemma, and in fact often depends on him as a buffer against abuses by their grandfather and uncles.\\" Han says that Juexin is also an \\"accomplice\\" since he helps Master Gao try to find Juemin, and that Juexin \\"insists on nonresistance\\" despite the fact that he agrees with his brothers. Han argued that Juexin's obedience to the family angers Juehui despite the mercy that Juehui feels for Juexin, \\"reflecting the author's own attitude toward\\" Juexin. * Gao Juemin (T: È´òË¶∫Ê∞ë, S: È´òËßâÊ∞ë, P: GƒÅo Ju√©m√≠n, W: Kao Ch√ºeh-min) - The middle brother. ** Juemin wears glasses. Juemin is in love with Qin, his cousin. Juemin anticipates the time when his academy begins admitting female students so that the two can get together and marry. Master Gao asks Juemin to marry the Grandniece of Milord Feng, but Juemin instead leaves the house, with Juehui helping him escape. Master Gao later ends the engagement and gives permission for Juemin and Qin to marry. * Gao Juehui (T: È´òË¶∫ÊÖß, S: È´òËßâÊÖß, P: GƒÅo Ju√©hu√¨, W: Kao Ch√ºeh-hui) - The most rebellious of the brothers. ** Juehui has an interest in the ideals of the May Fourth Movement. Juehui has a romantic interest in Ming Feng. Han says that Juehui \\"pays more attention to the rebellion\\" than to Ming Feng. After Ming Feng's death he feels remorse. At the end of the novel, he believes staying in the family is too suffocating, so he leaves Chengdu to go to Shanghai. ** According to Feng, Juehui is \\"the center of consciousness\\" in Family.Feng, p. 89. Feng said that while Juehui \\"is apparently the most fearless and rebellious of the three brothers\\" he also \\"is by no means the heroic role model that he has read about in new books and journals‚Äîthe sources of all his new ideas.\\" Feng argues that \\"Juehui betrays the most pronounced contradictions through his interactions with his family\\" and that Juehui \\"often finds himself helplessly entangled in ambivalent feelings\\" while dealing with his family, using his interactions with Juexin as an example. Han argued that while being \\"high-spirited youth rebelling against his family's restrictions\\", Juehui \\"still possesses ideas\\" from the Gao Family traditions. As an example she cites his pattern of affection for Ming Feng. Han argues that despite the fact that he likes her, \\"he never expresses his love or his hidden dreams: If only Ming Feng were a lady like Qin, he would marry her in a heartbeat.\\" * Li Ruijue (T: ÊùéÁëûÁé®, S: ÊùéÁëûÁèè, P: L«ê Ru√¨ju√©, W: Li Jui-ch√ºeh) - Juexin's wife. She marries him and falls in love with him, but realizes that Juexin still loves Mei more than her. She dies in childbirth. ** Han said that Ruijue \\"is beautiful and mild, and their intensive love produces their first boy, Hai Chen.\\" After Master Gao dies, as Ruijue is pregnant with a second child, relatives cajole Juexin into moving Ruijue out of the city to avoid giving the coffin of Master Gao. Despite Juehui's pleas to have it reversed, Juexin allows the move to happen, and Ruijue dies of childbirth as Juexin is prevented from entering the delivery room during the period of mourning for Master Gao. * Mei (C: Ê¢Ö, P: M√©i, W: Mei) - Juexin's cousin and the love of his life. She falls ill and dies. ** Han said that Mei \\"lives a miserable life.\\" Within a year from the start of the novel she marries and becomes a widow. Because her mother-in-law had not treated her well, she lives with her mother. Han said that the Gao family's younger members, especially Juexin, \\"are sympathetic\\" to Mei. * Ming Feng (T: È≥¥È≥≥, S: È∏£Âá§, P: M√≠ngf√®ng, W: Ming-feng) - A maidservant who is forced to marry an older man. She commits suicide. ** Han describes Ming Feng as \\"another tragic woman\\" in the Gao family. Ming Feng wants to marry Juehui but Master Gao arranges to have her be a mistress to Milord Feng, a man who is at the same age level as Ming Feng's grandfather would be. Ming Feng begs other members to remove her from the situation but nobody can challenge Master Gao. At midnight before she is to be given to Feng, she appears in Juehui's bedroom but he is so busy working on academic articles that he does not notice Ming Feng and her pleas. She commits suicide by drowning herself in a pool of water. Han says \\"Jue Min [sic] and others pity the girl, while Jue Hui [sic] now regrets his carelessness. However none of the people could have changed Ming Feng's fate.\\" * Qin (C: Áê¥, P: Q√≠n, W: Ch'in): A female cousin of Gao Juexin, and a student. ** Feng said that Qin \\"is ensconced, somewhat ironically, in extensive and complex familial relationships\\" so that the book rarely mentions her life away from the Gao family. Feng explained that because Ba Jin made the female student Qin as a more \\"feminine\\" and \\"inferior\\" counterpart to the male student Juehui, the \\"domestication\\" of Qin is \\"necessary\\". Feng argued that \\"at first glance\\" Qin and Juehui \\"seem to me more similar than different\\", and their parallel and symmetrical placement within the storyline of Family \\"serves both to segregate the domains of their activities by gender and to differentiate the degree of their radicalism.\\" For instance Feng notes that Qin does not come into conflict with male characters in her immediate or extended family and \\"acts as a dutiful and loving daughter to her widowed mother\\" while Juehui \\"usually displays an antagonistic attitude\\" towards older men in the Gao family and Juehui leaves the Gao family home. Feng concluded that the fact that Juehui leaves his house means that \\"his conflicts with the traditional family system are more fundamental and irreconcilable than those in Qin's case.\\" Feng argued that the author \\"deployed Qin to magnify Juehui's revolutionary zeal\\" by emphasizing differences that the two characters have in their emotional responses and respective relationships to the members of the Gao family and also \\"located the source of Qin's weakness in her gender and thus reaffirmed Juehui's superiority.\\" * Master Gao - The head of the Gao family. ** As Master Gao grows older, he attempts to reunite the Gao family. ** Han argues that Master Gao is \\"complex\\". She explained that Master Gao in fact loves his family and takes steps to enlarge it to accomplish his goal of having a large family, and that he does not believe that his decisions, which are based on ancestral rules, would harm his children. Han concluded that \\"Withdrawing his order on his deathbed shows that he remained a kind grandfather at the end, even if he was an ironhanded patriarch.\\" * Madam Zhou Publication history, translations, and adaptations The novel was first serialized in 1931-2. Together with Spring and Autumn, two novels Ba Jin wrote in the period 1939-40, it forms the trilogy, Turbulent Stream Trilogy (ÊøÄÊµÅ‰∏âÈÉ®Êõ≤). An English translation by Sidney Shapiro was published in 1958 by Foreign Languages Press (Beijing), with a third edition in 1978. Shapiro's translation was based on the 1953 People's Publishing House text, in which the author made corrections. Ba Jin made further changes for Shapiro's translation. The 1972 Anchor Books (New York) edition was edited by Olga Lang, Ba Jin's biographer. The New York edition omits the article \\"the\\" from the title, which makes \\"family\\" a more general concept rather than limiting it to this particular family. In her Editor's Note, Lang discusses the history of the text, pointing out that certain passages, the anarchist elements, had been deleted from the 1958 Foreign Languages Press edition. The Anchor edition restored three prefaces by the author, newly translated, as well as some of the omitted passages.Anchor edition., Editor's Note, p. v; Introduction, p. xix. A play and two films were based on the novel. The play was adapted by famous playwright Cao Yu in 1941.Anchor edition., Introduction, p. xxiii. A Mainland Chinese TV adaptation, starring Huang Lei, Lu Yi and Huang Yi, was produced in 2007. Ba Jin mentions Wu Yu (a.k.a. Wu Youling), when Juemin and Juexin discuss in a favorable manner how he is going to teach at their school. In the Sidney Shapiro translation Wu Yu is not mentioned by name; instead he is referred to as \\"the man who wrote that article, 'Cannibal Confucian Morality' in the New Youth magazine\\"Stapleton, p. 144. Quote from p. 17 of the Sidney Shapiro translation (Prospect Heights, Illinois: Waveland Press, 1989) Comparative perspective Family mentions many of the books and authors which inflamed the young protagonists, giving a vivid picture of intellectual life in a provincial capital. The tone and theme was influenced by works that also influenced many Chinese authors of Ba Jin's generation, for instance A Doll's House by Henrik Ibsen,Anchor edition., p. 34. about the fate of a woman trapped in the physical and social structures of her marriage. Family is often compared to the 18th-century novel, Dream of the Red Chamber, a richly poetic and tragic chronicle of the life of a prominent family living within a great house. Though he did not mention it as a model, Ba Jin, like all educated Chinese of his time, had been familiar with the work from his youth. Where the earlier work is fatalistic and told with philosophical allegory, however, the young heroes of Family leaves home to pursue lives of worldly engagement.Olga Lang Pa Chin and His Writings: Chinese Youth Between Two Revolutions (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1967), pp. 83-84 Reception Mei Han, author of the \\"Family\\" entry in The Facts on File Companion to the World Novel: 1900 to the Present, said that the most \\"moving\\" portions of Family were the deaths of Mingfeng, Mei, and Ruijue.

It exhibits artwork from across Canada and around the world. The Reach is also the regional archival repository and houses a significant collection of material culture from the Abbotsford region. The entire structure is a 20,000 square foot Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) building with 6,100 square feet of exhibition space. In addition to the Great Hall and two community exhibition spaces, The Reach has a multi-purpose studio for innovative arts and heritage programming, two climate controlled storage areas, and a flexible, multi-purpose public programming space.  Location  The gallery is located at 32388 Veterans Way, Abbotsford, British Columbia. It is part of the municipal complex that includes City Hall.  History  Abbotsford City Council, with the support of the majority of its citizens, believed the municipality would benefit from a dedicated, professional arts and culture facility. In December 2005 the City established the Abbotsford Museum and Art Gallery Steering Committee in order to explore community aspirations for the planned centre. From the outset, community stakeholders voiced their desire for a unique design. Draft plans were developed and public information sessions and open houses in 2006 and early 2007 invited public input on these plans. Construction, undertaken by PCL Constructors Inc. began shortly after that in June 2007 and the building was officially opened on September 22 of 2008 with a ceremony presided over by then mayor George F. Ferguson.The finished building had cost approximately $10.5 million, original estimates stating the project was about $345,000 under budget. The Reach Gallery Museum  Exhibitions  The Gallery has both permanent and rotating art exhibitions featuring significant local, regional, and national content. In 2015, The Reach opened Voices of the Valley, the permanent history exhibition, sharing stories of the significant events and individuals that shaped the present-day community. The Voices of the Valley exhibition was developed in conjunction with the Matsqui-Sumas-Abbotsford Museum Society, now Heritage Abbotsford Society, which operates Trethewey House Heritage Site. The Reach offers a robust annual schedule of events and programs that includes professional talks, panel discussions, classes, workshops, tours and special events. In 2015, the Gallery relaunched their Young Contemporaries program changing the name to Emerge, a program for aspiring artists and arts professionals between the ages of 16 and 30. The program provides emerging talent from the Fraser Valley with the opportunity to develop professional skills, exhibit their work and learn from established professionals in a collaborative and supportive environment. In 2016 The Reach was the recipient of a Governor General's History Award for Excellence in Community Programming for the permanent exhibit Voices of the Valley. In 2018 The Reach received the Award of Merit-Excellence in Exhibitions from the BC Museums Association (BCMA), for the exhibition Grand Theft Terra Firma. Also in 2018, The Reach celebrated its 10th anniversary with a public art program called Ramble: Art Outdoors. The Archives The Reach is the base for the Abbotsford Archives. In 2010, they launched an online photo archive with an initial collection of 3000 images from time periods between the 1890s and the 1980s, and the online archive continued to grow.

It was released for the Wii U as one of its launch games in November 2012. In the game, the player assumes control of a human survivor amid a 2012 zombie apocalypse. Featuring a permadeath system, it uses the Wii U GamePad extensively to scan the environment and maintain the survivor's inventory. ZombiU was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in 2015 as Zombi. The port, handled by Straight Right, adds new melee weapons and removes the multiplayer feature. Ubisoft was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for its gaming console, Wii U. Originally envisioned as a spin- off of the Raving Rabbids franchise and a fast-paced first-person shooter, Killer Freaks from Outer Space (with small, agile monsters), the game was retooled as ZombiU after the development team realized that the Wii U GamePad was suitable for slower-paced games. Many of the game's features, including the GamePad feature and the permadeath feature, went through several iterations. Among other video games, ZombiU was influenced by Resident Evil, Condemned: Criminal Origins and Peter Jackson's King Kong. London was chosen as the game's setting because of its blend of modern and medieval architecture and its rich history. Ubisoft Bucharest led development of the game's multiplayer portion. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with the game's emphasis on survival horror, atmosphere, and the permadeath system praised. Critics had mixed opinions about gameplay, multiplayer, story and use of the GamePad. Technical problems, such as glitches and load times, were criticized. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, prompting it to turn another Wii U exclusive, Rayman Legends, into a multiplatform game. A prototype for a sequel was developed, but was canceled when the game failed financially. Gameplay Screenshot of a player wielding a cricket bat against a zombie In ZombiU, a first-person survival horror game set in London, the player is a survivor of a zombie apocalypse. They are contacted by the Prepper, a mysterious figure who tasks them to maintain his safe house in order to be properly prepared for survival in this new destroyed London, all while the survivor seeks out a cure for the infection at the behest of Dr. Knight, a scientist/doctor stationed at Buckingham Palace. The player has a number of ways to deal with enemies, and can confront the zombies with firearms, land mines, and Molotov cocktails. They can use an unbreakable cricket bat, which does less damage than other weapons. There are several types of zombies, including those which explode, are armored, or spill corrosive fluid. The zombies are sensitive to light, and are attracted to a player who is using a flashlight or flare. Sound produced by firearms will also attract nearby enemies to a player, who can push them away with their weapon. The player can also use stealth to avoid being noticed by enemies. Exploration is encouraged in the game. By exploring the game's world, players can find beds (which are save points) and routes leading them back to their safe houses. New weapons, ammunition, and scarce items can be collected by searching areas or dead bodies. These items include food and medkits (which restore health), plywood scraps (used to barricade doors), and weapon parts (which can be used in the safe house to upgrade weapons). As players discover new items during the game, previously-inaccessible areas can be entered. These items are stored in the player character's inventory (known as a bug-out-bag) or a cache in the safe house. If the player's character is killed by a zombie (which can occur with one bite), the character will permanently die and the player will then assume the role of another survivor. The previous character will become a zombie, whom the player must kill to reclaim their inventory. If Miiverse is enabled, other players' characters may also appear as zombies carrying the items they collected. A player can also place symbolic clues and hints, visible to other players, on walls. In addition to the normal- difficulty mode, ZombiU has a \\"Chicken\\" mode, which lowers the game's difficulty, for new and inexperienced players and a survival mode where the game ends when the player's original character dies. The game's controls make extensive use of the Wii U GamePad. During normal play, the touchscreen manages player inventory and displays a mini-map of the immediate area (indicating the locations of the player and nearby enemies). The touchscreen is also used for context-sensitive actions such as executions, escaping from enemies, and hacking combination locks. The GamePad's gyroscope, which allows the controller to sense its rotation and tilt in three-dimensional space, is also used. While viewing the touchscreen, a player can move the controller to scan different areas to find items. While performing these actions, the television's perspective switches to a fixed third-person view of the player character and the surrounding area. The player is vulnerable to attack in this state, and must watch the GamePad's touchscreen and the television screen in to avoid harm. The Wii U camera allows players to import a face, which will be \\"zombified\\", into the game. ZombiU has three multiplayer modes. In Time Attack mode, players must kill as many zombies as they can in a limited time. In survival mode, players stay alive as long as possible with a limited supply of resources. The results of these two modes will be posted on the game's online leaderboard. The third mode, King of Zombies, is an offline asymmetrical multiplayer mode. A player, using the Wii U Pro Controller, plays a human survivor who must navigate a map to obtain all capture points. Another player, known as King Boris and using the Wii U GamePad with a top-down perspective, must deploy a maximum of 10 zombies to halt the players' progress and capture a flag. A progression system is present, in which the Pro Controller player and the GamePad player unlock more-powerful weapons and different types of zombies. Plot In ZombiU, John Dee made what was known as the Black Prophecy, which was realized in a 2012 zombie apocalypse. Four hundred years ago, scientist John Dee made what was known as the Black Prophecy. The Prepper (an ex-army, no-nonsense man) prepares for the coming apocalypse, and a secret society known as the Ravens of Dee researches Dee's predictions to stop them from taking place. In November 2012, the Black Prophecy begins to be realized in the form of an outbreak of zombies in London. After the outbreak the player character is led to the Prepper's bunker, where he receives weapons, a bug-out bag and the Prepper Pad, a device with a built-in scanner and radar. The Prepper, a Raven of Dee, left the organization due to a difference in interpreting Dee's prophecy. According to the scientist, Black Angels would save the world; the Ravens thought that Dee was referring to their organization, but the Prepper believed that he was talking about something worse. The player goes underground while scavenging at Buckingham Palace and is contacted by Dr. Knight, a physician for the Royal Family who is trying to find a cure. He orders the player to find diaries and notes left by Dee in exchange for scanner upgrades and a virucide, a chemical capable of killing the virus in those that are infected. This is done without the Prepper's knowledge, who believes that a cure is impossible. After leaving the palace the player is contacted by Sondra, who leads him to the remnants of the Ravens of Dee and tries to escape with the player in a helicopter on the Tower of London. A supernatural force drives a flock of ravens into the propeller, making the helicopter crash. The player returns to the Prepper's bunker, and Sondra promises to save them. In the bunker, the generator is running out of fuel and the Prepper tells the player to get petrol from a man named Vikram. The player finds Vikram, who has gone mad; he and his young child tell the player to go to a local nursery to get antibiotics for his wife. Despite the Prepper's protests (who thinks the player should raid the petrol station), he goes to the nursery; the staff and children have been eaten by a nurse, who became a ghost-like monster capable of teleportation. The player returns with the antibiotics to find that Vikram has become a zombie and eaten his family, forcing the player to kill him. On the way back to the bunker with the petrol, the player receives a distress signal from a young girl that she and her family are barricaded in St. George's Church. Although the Prepper correctly insists it is a trap, the player goes to rescue her. The player is kidnapped by Boris (the self-proclaimed King of Zombies) and his gang, who force survivors to fight off waves of zombies in the church's courtyard. Boris' lights, microphone, and music attract a horde of zombies, and he and his gang are eaten whilst the player escapes. The player has enough upgrades to collect Dee's remaining letters for Dr. Knight, who believes that he can now make a Panacea. He returns to the safe house, where Knight informs him that the Panacea is not a cure but a vaccine. The Prepper expresses profound disappointment in the player as he returns to Buckingham Palace. Knight has left his bunker for the queen's quarters to access data on a USB key. The player makes his way through the palace, discovering that Knight has been killed and turned into a zombie. The player uses Knight's eye to bypass a retinal scanner and collect the USB key. They run back to the Tower of London as the RAF is about to firebomb London and Sondra tries to keep her promise to rescue the player. This enrages The Prepper, who orders the player to leave the safe house and vows to outlive the Ravens of Dee. After the player leaves, the Prepper (who has been using survivors to stock his food supplies) finds a new lackey to do his bidding. The player reaches Sondra and leaves London as the RAF (the prophecy's Black Angels) destroy the city. Development=Origin Fighting small, agile alien monsters in Killer Freaks from Outer Space ZombiU was developed by Ubisoft Montpellier with an 80-person team; Ubisoft Bucharest provided additional assistance. The game's development paralleled that of Rayman Legends, another Montpellier project. It was produced by Guillaume Brunier, with Gabrielle Shrager its director and lead writer; Brunier and Shrager had collaborated on the development of From Dust. The team was approached by Nintendo to develop a mature game for their Wii U platform. The team developed the game using the proprietary LyN game engine. Since the hardware design was incomplete, the team made a number of prototypical games and decided that the new title would extensively utilize the Wii U GamePad. Originally conceived as a tie-in for Raving Rabbids, ZombiU was described as an experiment by Montpellier in adapting the Rabbids franchise for a more \\"hardcore\\" audience. According to Guillaume, the monsters were based on the Rabbids because some people found the sound generated by the Rabbids annoying; in the game, players can \\"trash and destroy\\" them. The association with Rabbids was eliminated by Ubisoft during development, since they thought that turning Rabbids into monsters did not suit the Raving Rabbids franchise. Announced at E3 2011 as Killer Freaks from Outer Space, the arcade first-person shooter had players with extravagant weapons killing small monsters. Although reaction to the game's announcement satisfied the studio, they realized that its fast pace would make extensive use of the GamePad while muting the TV display's utility; players must focus on one screen while ignoring the other. The tiny monsters were problematic, since shooting them was unsatisfying. The issues were singled out by Ubisoft management at a Ubisoft Paris meeting, and the team decided to slow the game's pace. The enemies were changed from small monsters to zombies, since their movement is slower and they are easily identified as monsters. According to Jean-Karl Tupin-Bron, the team was saddened by the fact that Killer Freaks would not work but delighted by the results of the transition. By September 2011, most of the Killer Freaks team had joined the zombie-game team. During the transition, the game's tone became more serious. The team tried to distinguish itself from other zombie games in the video-game market, making the GamePad its central feature. They were inspired by the 2007 film, I Am Legend, in which the protagonist is the only survivor left in a city and must be constantly on guard against zombies. ZombiU, the game's working title, became its official name since it was a zombie game for Wii U. Design Antony Johnston was ZombiU co-writer The team chose London as ZombiU setting because the city hosted the 2012 Olympics, and its dark history (including Jack the Ripper) matched the game. Although the zombie theme originated in the US, the UK has a blend of modern and medieval architecture which contributes to the game's dark tone. London's proximity to the French developer also allowed the team to research the city. According to writer Antony Johnston, the game features environments from a lavish palace to decaying ruins to \\"reflect the contrast of modern London\\". London allowed the development team to use Beefeaters, royal guards and a cricket bat inspired by Shaun of the Dead. The cricket bat was the only melee weapon in the game's original Wii U version. After realizing that some players used the bat almost exclusively while playing the game, Shrager regretted not adding more melee weapons and thought that the players deserved a more-varied experience. The Wii U GamePad was described as a survival kit for players. It was inspired by the studio's previous game, Peter Jackson's King Kong, in which players make use of the environment to survive (such as using a torch to scare off enemies); the team made the GamePad a survival kit, taking considerable time to fine-tune the GamePad's functions. Although it was initially possible for players to plan strategy with the GamePad, they rarely did so. The team then retooled the system to include features such as the mini-map, resulting in players focusing on the GamePad and ignoring the action on the TV. Eventually, the team balanced player time on both screens by switching from first- to third-person perspective when the player uses the survival kit. Players are vulnerable when using the kit, prompting them to look at the TV screen while using the GamePad. This increases the game's tension, making it more scary to play. According to Guillaume, the team realized this potential when they implemented the lock-pick feature (when players must be aware of their surroundings while trying to unlock a door). To further immerse players in the game, the voice of the Prepper is channeled through the GamePad's speakers and players need to read text with the pad; since the GamePad is a real-world object, the experience is more intimate. The pad displayed most crucial information to the player, and the game did not have a user interface. ZombiU was designed as a realistic zombie game. Fear was the game's core emotion and it should be played slowly, similar to some classic horror games. According to game director Jean-Phillipe Caro, players will do badly if they try to play it as a fast-paced action shooter like Call of Duty and ignore the GamePad. A prominent game mechanic is the permadeath system, intended to increase its tension. With the system, the game featured several survivors instead of a hero character. Its narrative was designed to rely on environmental storytelling rather than cutscenes, and players would understand the story through the game experience. The team introduced a persistent level design, in which when players continue playing after their initial survivor is killed. Action by the previous survivor will still affect the game's world; previously-killed zombies will not re-spawn. The permadeath system was debated, with concerns about loading times and backtracking. To ensure that the game's narrative would continue after a player-controlled character died, the survivors were not voiced to avoid narrative dissonance; this made the player, not the survivors, the protagonist. Although Shrager was relieved when the central character was dropped, writing the game was the \\"toughest challenge\\" she had ever faced in games. Since survivors can die anywhere in the game, linking the story became difficult. The team introduced the Prepper, an important character who communicates with the survivors by radio to link them and advance the narrative. During development, the permadeath concept was nearly removed. A core team goal was a game which was difficult but fair, inspired by difficult games such as Dark Souls and Demon's Souls. The permadeath system ensured that players are often challenged, since every zombie can be a deadly threat. It fit the game's survival theme, giving players an incentive to continue. The game was designed for players to learn by experience, slowly improving their skill. The Metroid franchise inspired ZombiU structure, enabling players to backtrack; Left 4 Dead inspired enemy placement, and Condemned: Criminal Origins influenced the game's first-person perspective. Its content was inspired by Capcom's Resident Evil and zombie comics, films and books such as Dead Set and Night of the Living Dead: London. ZombiU offline multiplayer mode was developed by Ubisoft Bucharest. Conceived during early development, it was kept when the core game was reiterated; its asymmetrical experience made the developer believe in the Wii U's potential, and was the demo Ubisoft showed the public during E3 2011. A cooperative multiplayer mode and online play were planned by the developer, but were removed due to time constraints. Cris Velasco was the game's composer. By the time Velasco began composing its music, ZombiU was playable; its audio director sent him game footage to help him understand the type of music needed. He spent 10 days composing the music, and assembled a string quintet of two violins, a viola, and two cellos to record it. Known as the Apocalypse Ensemble, it played \\"rawer sound\\" which makes the soundtrack menacing. Release ZombiU was introduced during Ubisoft's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012. A webcomic, written by Johnston and illustrated by Kev Crossley, was published on November 12 to promote the game. The 14-page comic, Z-14, was the game's prequel and linked ZombiU to the initial zombie outbreak. ZombiU was released on November 18, 2012 as the Wii U launch game. At release, European players could only purchase the game from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. due to a Nintendo-imposed restriction. According to Nintendo of Europe, a German law required that games with mature content be played only at night. After negotiations with the German entertainment software self- regulating organization, the restriction was lifted in March 2013. A Wii U package with the game was released on February 13, 2013. In addition to the Wii U, its accessories and ZombiU, the package contained a downloadable copy of Nintendo Land and ZombiU artwork and developer commentary. Ubisoft executive Tony Key said that although the game was designed for the Wii U, the company might bring it to other platforms. Following several leaks, Ubisoft confirmed Zombi for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Developed by Straight Right (who had developed Mass Effect 3 Wii U version), it was released on August 18, 2015. The game is similar to the original, with minor updates and enhancements. Second-screen gameplay was moved to the main screen, only appearing when required. Although the cricket bat was the only melee weapon in ZombiU, Zombi added two weapons. The shovel has a longer range and the ability to hit more than one zombie at a time. The second (a nailed bat) inflicts more damage, has a higher critical-hit chance and can also hit more than one enemy at a time. ZombiU flashlight can switch to a wider, further- reaching beam which uses more battery life and increases the risk of attracting zombies. The flashlight must be kept off for 30 seconds to recharge, requiring that its use be planned. Zombi has only the solo campaign, without local multiplayer or online single-player features. The boxed game was released on January 21, 2016. Reception=Critical reception ZombiU received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic, with scores ranging from 4/10 given by GameSpot to 9.2/10 awarded by Official Nintendo Magazine. Although Montpellier was initially disappointed by some of the critical reviews, the studio was pleased with the game's overall reception. Jim Sterling of Destructoid wrote that ZombiU zombies were intimidating by comparison with other zombie games. Sterling called it an \\"oppressive\\" experience, since players were diverted by the GamePad while the game continued in real time. This was echoed by Rich Stanton of Eurogamer, who thought that the system made the game experience scarier. According to Stanton, it was one of the few zombie titles which lived up to the phrase \\"survival horror\\". Hollander Cooper of GamesRadar agreed, saying that ZombiU \\"[honed] in on the 'survival' part of the 'survival horror' genre better than any release in recent memory\\". Patrick Klepek of Giant Bomb wrote that the game had some very scary moments, which players who liked survival horror would enjoy. Richard Mitchell of Joystiq praised its atmosphere, which he compared favourably with Condemned: Criminal Origins. Chris Schilling of VideoGamer.com agreed, calling its atmosphere \\"authentic\\" and \\"rich\\". However, Schilling found the later stages of the game disappointing as the game become less frightening with the introduction of more-powerful weapons. Sterling wrote that the permadeath system makes the game feel scarier, saying that the emotional impact on players is more significant than the typical game over screen; the former player character could be considered a \\"mute monument\\" to player failure. According to Klepek, seeing a player character becomes a zombie was depressing and \\"soul-crushing\\". Arthur Gies of Polygon wrote that the system helped create an \\"overwhelming sense of fear and risk\\", and made him play the game in a more careful, tactical manner. Stanton wrote that the system often leads to \\"fraught backpack hunts\\", since players must retrieve their items from the previous player character; if they die, the items would be lost forever. According to Stanton, the system makes the game's items more meaningful and backtracking more fun. Greg Miller of IGN found the game paradoxically cool and nonsensical. Sterling called the plot \\"typical\\", writing that it was a basic backstory to complement the game's survival theme. Miller agreed, saying that ZombiU did not require a strong narrative. Stanton found the game's narrative not particularly engaging, but the environmental storytelling was \\"skillfully done\\". Turi found its concept interesting, but was disappointed with the lack of a central character and the game's excessive backtracking. Cooper called the story \\"light\\", but too complicated by the end; he was dissatisfied with the lack of interesting characters. Gies appreciated the game world's development, praising Ubisoft for creating a believable setting; however, he and Schilling were disappointed by the story's supernatural elements. ZombiU extensive use of the Wii U GamePad received mixed reception Sterling wrote that there was too little enemy variety, which made the game's combat repetitive. He also criticized its map design, saying that in his 11-hour experience with the game, he could not find his way to objectives for at least two hours. Turi called the game's map confusing, agreeing with Sterling that players would easily get lost. He criticized the game's melee weapon as unsatisfying to use, comparing it unfavorably to Dead Island and Left 4 Dead 2. According to Turi, the melee-combat shortcomings were highlighted by the game's shortage of ammunition. Maxwell McGee of GameSpot and Miller shared similar concerns, calling the melee combat repetitive. According to McGee, the game's simplistic mission design and puzzle offer little variety. Stanton wrote that although the game's combat was simple, it developed into \\"something special\\" since players needed to choose their weapons wisely. Cooper found several flaws in the systems, such as characters not acknowledging the death of a previous player character and forcing players to replay some game segments. Klepek found the gunplay to be mediocre, but thematically correct. Sterling found the use of the Wii U GamePad \\"hit-and-miss\\", stating that the scanning and radar functions are enjoyable. He noted that he was annoyed by the lock-picking and barricading minigames, which required players to press the touchscreen rapidly. According to Sterling, the latter two functions were pointless filler. Stanton praised the scanning system for immersing players in the game. Turi found the two- screen experience a noble effort, but was dissatisfied with its controls. According to McGee, the GamePad adds little to the game and some of its functions are better handled with a controller. Klepek called most of GamePad features well-implemented with the exception of the gyroscope controls. Mitchell wrote that the GamePad enhanced the overall gameplay, but disliked the screen-taping minigame in certain GamePad features. Sterling compared its graphics to a Wii title and noted technical flaws, including glitches and slow loading times. He and Stanton thought that some of the game's assets were used excessively. Turi severely criticized the game's lighting system, saying that it looked blurry even given its nighttime setting. Miller also noted the game's sub-par texture, and was disappointed by its lack of visual appeal. Turi and Gies noted the difficulty of dragging items with the GamePad, but Gies thought it added tension to the game. Sterling called the multiplayer mode King of Zombie being fun to play; playing as King Boris was more enjoyable than playing a zombie survivor. Turi echoed him, noting that a player should only play as a human survivor with a Pro Controller; playing with the nunchuck was \\"unbearable\\". McGee enjoyed this mode more than the single-player campaign for its action. Cooper liked the mode, but felt that the lack of online multiplayer limited its longevity. Klepek also liked the mode's concept but called the two-player mode a bit limited and not sufficiently enjoyable, a sentiment shared by Mitchell. Schilling thought the mode offered only \\"brief entertainment\\" and was an \\"afterthought\\". The game's Zombi version also received mixed reviews, according to Metacritic. Christopher Livingston of PC Gamer noted that the PC version had many glitches and occasionally crashed. Shabana Arif of GamesRadar found the system unrefined and repetitive, even with new melee weapons. Disappointed with the lack of enhancement of the original game's graphics, the limited 30 frames per second and the GamePad transition to other home consoles, she called the package a wasted opportunity. James Orry of VideoGamer.com also criticized the lack of visual upgrading and overall improvement and the exclusion of the multiplayer mode, but found the game \\"an excellent entry in the survival horror genre\\". Sales and legacy ZombiU was the 17th-bestselling game in the UK in its first week of release, the bestselling third-party Wii U launch title. The game was unprofitable for Ubisoft, and a sequel (which would have had cooperative multiplayer and levels with multiple paths) was cancelled. ZombiU helped shape the asynchronous gameplay of Ubisoft's 2014 game, Watch Dogs; its disappointing sales prompted Ubisoft to turn Rayman Legends (an announced 2013 Wii-U exclusive) into a multi-platform game to reach a larger audience.

William Connolly was born in Milltown, County Galway, to Liam D√°ll Connolly (whose grandson was piper John Burke). His brother John, was also a piper. Early in life, he and his brother John travelled to Liverpool, sailing from there to the United States, where John settled. William travelled on to Canada, playing, \\"in that country for an unusually long time\\"http://billhaneman.ie/IMM/IMM-XXI.html on steamers up and down the St. Lawrence River. Having made a great deal of money, he relocated to Brooklyn, New York, where he bought a house. This was sold in 1863 as Connolly feared he would be drafted into the Union army as a result of the ongoing American Civil War. \\"Besides, he realized that it was much easier for him to handle a chanter than a rifle, so he lost no time in getting back to Liverpool, in which cosmopolitan city he remained four years.\\" He returned to Milltown after leaving Liverpool and before sailing again to the US, \\"Modesty evidently was not his most conspicuous virtue, for we are told that he engaged a boy to carry his set of bagpipes through Milltown, with a view to impress the people with a due sense of his importance.\\" He settled this time in Waltham, Massachusetts, where he built a dance hall. Restless, he made San Francisco his home for a time, returning to Waltham, then back to San Francisco. He left California for the last time intending to buy the Hibernian Hall in Brooklyn, but was unable, \\"as his wife would not consent to the sale of her home in Waltham\\". He then moved to Pittsburgh, where he died sometime in the 1870s or perhaps 1880s. His brother John also appears to have spent some time in San Francisco. According to fellow piper, Patsy Touhey, John Connolly died about 1895 at Milford, Massachusetts. O'Neill reported that, \\"Mr. Burke, to whom we are indebted for the above information, says \\"William Connolly was the best general player on the Irish pipes on either side of the Atlantic.\\" Michael Egan, the famous maker of the Irish or Union pipes, who knew all the best pipers of his day, was of the same opinion.\\" See also * Paddy Conneely (died 11 September 1851), Irish piper. * Patsy Touhey (1863-1925), piper * Johnny Doran (c.1907-9 January 1950), piper References * Famous Pipers who flourished principally in the second half of the nineteenth century Chapter 21 in Irish Minstrels and Musicians, by Capt.

It expands on the concept of disruptive technologies, a term he coined in a 1995 article Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave.Bower, Joseph L. & Christensen, Clayton M. (1995). However the concept of new technologies leading to wholesale economic change is not a new idea since Joseph Schumpeter adapted the idea of creative destruction from Karl Marx. Schumpeter (1949) in one of his examples used \\"the railroadization of the Middle West as it was initiated by the Illinois Central\\". He wrote, \\"The Illinois Central not only meant very good business whilst it was built and whilst new cities were built around it and land was cultivated, but it spelled the death sentence for the [old] agriculture of the West.\\"Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave\\" Harvard Business Review, January‚ÄìFebruary 1995 Subject matter Clayton Christensen demonstrates how successful, outstanding companies can do everything \\"right\\" and still lose their market leadership ‚Äì or even fail ‚Äì as new, unexpected competitors rise and take over the market. There are two key parts to this dilemma. # Value to innovation is an S-curve: Improving a product takes time and many iterations. The first of these iterations provide minimal value to the customer but in time the base is created and the value increases exponentially. Once the base is created then each iteration is dramatically better than the last. At some point the most valuable improvements are complete and the value per iteration is minimal again. So in the middle is the most value, at the beginning and end the value is minimal. # Incumbent sized deals: The incumbent has the luxury of a huge customer set but high expectations of yearly sales. New entry next generation products find niches away from the incumbent customer set to build the new product. The new entry companies do not require the yearly sales of the incumbent and thus have more time to focus and innovate on this smaller venture. For this reason, the next generation product is not being built for the incumbent's customer set and this large customer set is not interested in the new innovation and keeps demanding more innovation with the incumbent product. Unfortunately this incumbent innovation is limited to the overall value of the product as it is at the later end of the S-curve. Meanwhile, the new entrant is deep into the S-curve and providing significant value to the new product. By the time the new product becomes interesting to the incumbent's customers it is too late for the incumbent to react to the new product. At this point it is too late for the incumbent to keep up with the new entrant's rate of improvement, which by then is on the near-vertical portion of its S-curve trajectory. Through this compelling multi-industry study, Christensen introduces his seminal theory of \\"disruptive innovation\\" that has changed the way managers and CEOs around the world think about innovation. Christensen then argues that the following are common principles that incumbents must address: * Resource dependence: Current customers drive a company's use of resources * Small markets struggle to impact an incumbent's large market * Disruptive technologies have fluid futures, as in, it is impossible to know what they will disrupt once matured * Incumbent Organizations' value is more than simply their workers, it includes their processes and core capabilities which drive their efforts * Technology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets are often the ones that have the greatest value in emerging markets He also argues the following strategies assist incumbents in succeeding against the disruptive technology: * They develop the disruptive technology with the 'right' customers. Not necessarily their current customer set * They place the disruptive technology into an autonomous organization that can be rewarded with small wins and small customer sets * They fail early and often to find the correct disruptive technology * They allow the disruption organization to utilize all of the company's resources when needed but are careful to make sure the processes and values were not those of the company Reception Shortly after the release of the book, Christensen \\"received the Global Business Book Award for The Innovator‚Äôs Dilemma and The Economist named it as one of the six most important books about business ever written\\".\\"Aiming high\\", Jun 30th 2011. http://www.economist.com/node/18894875 It also received the Global Business Book Award as the best business book of the year (1997).Innosight,(2014). Clayton Christensen-Innosight Co-founder. [online] Available at: http://www.innosight.com/about-us/clayton-christensen.cfm [Accessed 15 Oct. 2014]. One criticism of the book by Ben Thompson is that the theory applies best to businesses with business customers. Thompson says that consumers are not as rational and single-minded as business customers, and hence are less susceptible to disruption. Thompson points to the iPhone as a consumer product that is not easily disrupted by a low-end disruption; Christensen maintains that the iPhone and Apple are good candidates for disruption. Impact on business world Christensen at the World Economic Forum Annual Meeting in 2013The term disruptive technologies was first described in depth with this book by Christensen; but the term was later changed to disruptive innovation in a later book (The Innovator's Solution). A disruptive innovation is an innovation that creates a new market and value network that will eventually disrupt an already existing market and replace an existing product. Recent work Since the book was published, various articles have been written, both critiquing and supporting Clayton Christensen's work. The Innovator's Dilemma proved popular; not only was it reprinted, but a follow-on book entitled The Innovator's Solution was published. His books Disrupting Class about education and The Innovator's Prescription about health care both utilize ideas from The Innovator's Dilemma.

It was released in Japan in April 2012 by Agatsuma Entertainment, and in North America by Atlus USA in October 2012, Agatsuma Entertainment also published the game in Europe and Australia in March 2013, exclusively as an eShop title. A version for Microsoft Windows was released in April 2016. An enhanced port entitled Code of Princess EX launched for the Nintendo Switch between July and August 2018, courtesy of Nicalis worldwide, and Pikii in Japan. Gameplay Code of Princess is a hack and slash video game that features several game modes and over 50 playable characters. In single-player mode there is a story- driven campaign mode with several scenarios where only 4 characters (Solange, Ali, Zozo and Allegro) are playable, a \\"free play\\" mode that allows playing any campaign scenario with any available character, and a \\"Bonus Quests\\" mode where additional scenarios are unlocked and must be beaten with specific requirements. The game also has RPG elements, at the completion of a scenario, the player receives experience points, money, and sometimes equipment to use on the playable characters. When a character levels up the player can allocate status points freely. There is also a multiplayer mode that supports local and network play where players can play several scenarios cooperatively, or they can fight each other in a Versus Mode, up to four combatants in a fight. Plot In a world populated by humans and monsters, Princess Solange Blanchefleur de Lux is exiled from her home Kingdom of DeLuxia after it is attacked by monsters, and the royal family is blamed for the attack by the Distron army. Armed with the Sacred Blade DeLuxcalibur, Princess Solange sets out to find the cause of the monsters' violent behavior while also avoiding the Distron Army, who are looking for the DeLuxcalibur. On her journey Solange meets several people, including female thief Ali Baba, zombie-like Necromancer Lady Zozo, bard/sage Allegro, martial artist Master T Drakkhen, blind samurai \\"Shooting Star\\" Tsukikage, business-driven cat Marco Neko, and warrior/nun Sister Helga \\"Hel\\" Wilhelmina. Zozo, Tsukikage and Master T join Solange because they feel \\"drawn\\" to the DeLuxcalibur. Zozo also explains that she isn't currently in her real body, but rather created a body for herself because her real body was stolen. Solange and her team eventually learn that Distron's leader Queen Distiny is behind the monster attacks, and then fight the generals of Distron, which include ninja Baku Juppongi, a former acquaintance of Ali; sorcerer Alchemia, and General Liongate, who actually is Solange's brainwashed brother Schwartz. Solange's team eventually discovers that Queen Distiny is actually a cover identity for fallen angel Dios Diablos Distille, who in the past tried to destroy the world but was defeated, and now was trying to recover her strength to try again to destroy the world. Zozo reveals that her real name is Milk Macchiato and that her body was stolen by Alchemia, who in reality is her sister Cocoa, who had her own body stolen as well, by Queen Distiny. They also learn that Distille's power source is her \\"Code\\" and the Empyrean Stone, and learn that the gods created the stone and the monsters as means to keep the human population in check, because in the past human civilization grew unchecked and nearly destroyed themselves. Schwartz explains that Solange also has a \\"Code\\" of her own, the titular Code of Princess, capable of countering Distille's Code. The team briefly considers destroying the Empyrean Stone but don't do so as it is also the source of the world's magic and the monsters. Solange's team then proceed to confront Distille who reveals that she sealed her \\"Code\\" in a group of humans (Zozo, Master T and Tsukikage) and lured them to come to her, and that she also needed the DeLuxcalibur to put her Code back together and fully revive. Distille's plan failed, however, because Zozo wasn't in her true body but rather in a corpse constructed from \\"spare parts\\" animated by magic, and thus she didn't have the full portion of Distille's code sealed into her. A weakened Distille is forced to flee to the Tower of Wrenne, location of the Empyrean Stone, seals herself inside it, and taunts Solange, telling her that she won't dare to destroy the stone as she fully knows the consequences of doing so, and then threatens that she will return in a thousand years at full strength. Whether Solange destroys the stone or not triggers one of the two endings: * Destroy the stone: Solange destroys the stone using the DeLuxcalibur and Distille is defeated; this brings the side effect of magic and monsters disappearing. As Zozo's corpse is animated by magic she begins to die; however Alchemia/Cocoa takes her body back from Distiny and also returns Zozo's body; thus Zozo is finally able to return to her real body. * Don't destroy the stone: Things are left as they are, and Solange is confident that everyone's descendants will be able to fight Distille in the future. The team then continues their journey, to return Zozo to her true body. Development It has been noted that the game looks and plays very similar to the Sega Saturn title Guardian Heroes. Guardian Heroes director and character designer Tetsuhiko Kikuchi and lead programmer Masaki Ukyo worked on Code of Princess. Both of them served as contractors for the title. Atlus USA provided a full localization for the North American release on the Nintendo 3DS, including English voice acting. Agatsuma Entertainment adopted this localization for the PAL region release. Albeit the PC version of the game was released worldwide, the game's new publisher Degica failed to provide a full English localization, only translating text and menus whilst retaining the original Japanese vocalization, making the English vocalization exclusive to the Nintendo 3DS version. Reception The game has received mixed to positive critical reception, and currently has a score of 68/100 on Metacritic based on 22 reviews. ZTD Game Domain gave it 9.3 out of 10. IGN gave it 6.9. GameSpot gave it 7.0. Legacy In 2013, the team behind the first game has expressed interest in developing a sequel to the game for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Solange, Ali, Liongate and Master T all appear as playable characters in the 2018 crossover fighting game Blade Strangers. Solange also appears as a playable character in the 2019 puzzle game Crystal Crisis.

Etymology  Mesolenellus is a contraction of meso - middle - and Olenellus, the genus from which it was split off. The epithet hyperborea is a contraction of hyper (Greek ·ΩëœÄŒ≠œÅ \\"excess\\") and Boreas (), god of the North Wind in Greek mythology, referencing the current geographical position of the deposits of its type location. M. svalbardensis has been named for the Norwegian island group Svalbard or Spitsbergen, where it was originally collected.  Taxonomy  It was considered a subgenus of Olenellus before. The nearest relatives of Mesolenellus are the species of the genus Mesonacis, with which it constitutes the subfamily Mesonacinae.  Distribution  * Mesolenellus hyperborea occurs in the Botomian (Nevadella-zone) of the paleocontinent Laurentia, now Greenland (Upper Buen Formation, above Brilles√∏, 1.5 km east of Borglum Elv, Peary Land, North-Eastern end of the island). The occurrence of M. hyperborea has been specified as the early mudstone layer of the Upper Buen Formation. The famous Sirius Passet fauna (e.g. Kleptothule and Aaveqaspis) occurs in the lowest (sandy) member of the Buen Formation and thus predates Mesolenellus. * M. svalbardensis has been found in the Botomian (Nevadella-zone) of Laurentia, now Svalbard/Spitsbergen (lower Slakli Series, Sofiekammen Formation, northern side of the Hornsund, West-Spitsbergen). A specimen that probably belongs to M. svalbardensis or is closely related was found in Greenland (Schley Fjord Formation, Peary land). There is a further mention of the occurrence in Greenland for the late mudstone layer of the Upper Buen Formation, indicating that M. hyperborea predated M. svalbardensis.  Habitat  The mudstone in which both species were found indicates deeper, quiet waters.  Ecology  Mesolenellus hyperborea occurs together with Limniphacos perspiculum, Serrodiscus, hyoliths, Petrianna fulmenta (Bradoriida), and inarticulate brachiopods.  Description  As with most early trilobites, Mesolenellus has an almost flat exoskeleton, that is only thinly calcified, and has crescent- shaped eye ridges. As part of the suborder Olenellina, Olenellus lacks dorsal sutures. Like all other members of the superfamily Olenelloidea, the eye- ridges spring from the back of the frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon, that is called glabella. Mesolenellus also shares the typical character of the whole family Olenellidae that the frontal (L3) and middle pair (L2) of lateral lobes of the glabella are partially merged. This creates two very typical, isolated slits. Mesolenellus is a genus within the Mesonacinae, with eye-ridges curved but almost parallel to the midline. The back of the eye-ridges is opposite the most backward ring of the glabella (L0 or occipital ring). Genal spines are 6-8 times as long as L0. The outer furrows of the glabella are parallel to the midline between the back of the cephalon and the furrow between side lobes L2 and L3. The thorax is 3 times as wide as the axis at the 3rd segment. Mesolenellus can be distinguished from the sister-genus Mesonacis, where the back of the eye-ridge extends only to the most backward side lobes (L1), genal spines are only 1-5 times as long as L0, and the glabella widens forwards along L1 and L2. Except for in Mesonacis fremonti the curved eye-ridges are at an angle of 15¬∞-20¬∞ with the midline. A third genus Olenellus, that constitutes the second subfamily of the family Olenellidae differs from Mesolenellus in having genal spines 4-5 times as long as L0, the glabella widens forwards along L1 and L2, and the thorax 4-4¬Ω times wider that the axis at the 3rd segment.  Key to the species  { - valign=\\"top\\" align=\\"left\\" ! scope=\\"row\\" width=\\"3%\\"  1  A short ridge (called plectrum) connects the frontal lobe of the glabella with the frontal border of the headshield. The section of the border of the back of the head (posterior cephalic border) halfway between the midline and the genal angle (between the axis and the intergenal angle) has a backward angle. The base of the genal spine is opposite the most backward ring of the glabella (L0). The furrow between the 2nd and 3rd ring (S2) does not contact the furrow that outlines the glabella (or axial furrow). Nevadella-zone.

Metal hydroxides are also known as strong bases. Many common metal hydroxides are made up from hydroxide ions and the ion of the particular metal that it is made up of. Example: When NaOH (sodium hydroxide) is dissolved in water, it forms OH ions and Na ions. Some metal hydroxides, like alkali metal hydroxides, ionize completely when dissolved, so that is why they are known as strong bases. Their pH is above 7, labeling them as bases. Since ions conduct electricity, alkali hydroxides carry electricity very well when they are dissolved. Some metal hydroxides are weak electrolytes and dissolve only partially in aqueous solution.

A cross originally in the back was removed upon purchase by Father Giovanni Rizzo. The 17-centimeter high statue with arms stretched out wide and wearing a traditional pink robe or tunic has an inscription \\"Yo reinar√©\\" (\\"I will reign\\") at its base. It is one of the most popular religious images in Colombia, especially among Roman Catholics and it is claimed to have miraculous powers of fertility and healing. History The statue's image and religious devotion began with a Salesian priest named Father Giovanni Rizzo (Anglicized: John Rizzo), from Arenzano, Italy. His bishop once assigned him to an impoverished town or barrio in Bogot√°, Colombia. In 1914, Rizzo and his Salesian priestly companions were building a new church in Barranquilla, Colombia. With limited financial resources, Rizzo is believed to have had a mystical vision of the child Jesus in a standing posture while beckoning out his arms. The boy in the vision spoke \\"Take me with you, I want to accompany you.\\" The statue In 1942, after years of finishing church construction, Rizzo discovered a child Jesus statue in a nearby shop called El Vaticano. In the shop was the statue by an anonymous Italian sculptor who fashioned a likeness of the child Jesus with a cross in the back, as in Rizzo's vision. Rizzo ordered the cross to be removed from his back and that the owner inscribe the words Yo reinar√© (English: I will reign) at the base of the statue, which he brought to his new parish,\\"History of Divino Nino\\", The House of Divino Nino where he began to preach about the favors the Christ Child does for those who have faith and who help the poor.\\"Our Stained Glass Windows\\", St. Thomas Acquinas Chapel, park Slope, Brooklyn Apparition to Mother Angelica Shrine of the Most Blessed Sacrament, Hanceville, Alabama where a statue of the Divine Child of Mother Angelica's version is prominently displayed in the plaza square. Foundress of Eternal World Television Network, Mother Angelica has a strong devotion to the child Jesus. Various religious reports claim that in 1995, she travelled in Colombia to expand their evangelizing work of her then-new network in the Spanish language. In Colombia, Angelica met Padre Juan Pablo Rodriguez, who introduced her and her companion sisters to the shrine of the Divino Ni√±o. Angelica recalled that upon praying before the image, the statue came alive and spoke to her, commanding her to build a temple where he will bless her benefactors. In a later biography by Raymond Arroyo, Angelica recalls that she has brief conversations with the child Jesus and has also seen him in the hallway of her convent.Mother Angelica: The Remarkable Story of a Nun, Her Nerve, and a Network of Miracles - Raymond Arroyo. Double Day Publishings, 2005. Mother Angelica brought this devotion back with her to Alabama, where she and her companion sisters propagate the devotion. A variant of their child Jesus image portrays him holding a burning heart, rather than with the traditional outstretched arms found in Bogot√°. Angelica also attributes her many network and television successes to this pious religious devotion. On her visit to Colombia noted that she shared the same last name as the founder of the devotion, Salesian Father John Rizzo.

Anatomy Originally described from the right mandible (lower jaw), its confusing anatomy resulted in it being classified as an ape‚Äîits name translates \\"near ape\\". Plesiopithecus teras, the only species so far identified, was discovered in 1992 by Elwyn L. Simons in Egypt at the base of the Jebel Qatrani Formation at Fayum in quarry L-41. Within two years, a more complete, crushed skull was found, demonstrating that it was a strepsirrhine primate. It is thought to be a close relative of lemuriforms (extant strepsirrhines), and a sister group to either lorisoids or all lemuriforms. Plesiopithecus was a medium-sized strepsirrhine primate, with large orbits, a high muzzle, and a skull exhibiting klinorhynchy (a marked angle between the palate and the basicranium, or the lower region of the braincase). Its large orbits indicate that it was nocturnal, and its teeth suggest that it bored holes in wood in search of soft-bodied insects, just like the aye-aye.  Etymology  The genus name Plesiopithecus derives from the Greek root plesi- (œÄŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒøœÇ, plƒìsios), meaning \\"near\\", and the Greek word œÄŒØŒ∏Œ∑Œ∫ŒøœÇ (pithekos), meaning \\"trickster\\", which has historically been used to mean \\"ape\\". The species name derives from the Greek word œÑŒµœÅŒ±œÉ (teras), meaning \\"wonderful or amazing animal\\".  Evolutionary history  Although Plesiopithecus is now clearly recognized as being related to lemuriforms (extant strepsirrhine primates), its phylogenetic relations among the fossil primates are unclear. Phylogenetic analyses using 359 morphological traits place it as a sister group of lemuriforms, along with other Eocene African sister taxa, the djebelemurids, which include Djebelemur and 'Anchomomys' milleri. This Afro- Arabian clade, which includes crown lemuriforms and possibly the disputed azibiids, excludes the Holarctic adapiforms and may be descended from an early Asian branch of adapiforms such as a primitive branch of cercamoniines predating Donrussellia (one of the oldest European adapiforms). A general consensus places Plesiopithecus at the base of the lemuriform clade, possibly closer to the lemuriforms than the djebelemurids. Due to its combination of the lack of a toothcomb (a specialized dental structure found in most lemuriforms) and a front dentition that is enlarged and procumbent, Plesiopithecus has been considered a possible relative of the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), suggesting a possible close relationship. This close relationship between Plesiopithecus and the aye-aye within the lemur radiation was recovered by Gunnell et al. (2018), suggesting that lemur evolution involved two dispersal events from Africa to Madagascar.Gregg F. Gunnell; Doug M. Boyer; Anthony R. Friscia; Steven Heritage; Fredrick Kyalo Manthi; Ellen R. Miller; Hesham M. Sallam; Nancy B. Simmons; Nancy J. Stevens; Erik R. Seiffert (2018). \\"Fossil lemurs from Egypt and Kenya suggest an African origin for Madagascar's aye-aye\\". Nature Communications. 9: Article number 3193. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05648-w.Godinot, M. Lemuriform origins as viewed from the fossil record. Folia Primatol. 77, 446‚Äì464 (2006). Alternatively, it may have closer ties to the aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis) within the lemuroid (lemur) radiation. The cranial and dental morphology of Plesiopithecus resemble what is predicted of an aye-aye ancestor, with an arched cranial vault suggesting klinorhynchy (a marked angle between the palate and the basicranium, or the lower region of the braincase) similar to that of aye-ayes, significantly enlarged canines and/or incisors, reduced molars and premolars, a high muzzle, and anteriorly placed orbits. However, it lacked ever-growing incisors and the diastema found in the aye- aye. The increased anterior dentition is peculiar because it has only happened in lemuriforms, and has never been observed in any of the numerous adapiforms. Key to this possible close affinity with the aye-aye is the identity (canine vs. incisor) of the procumbent front teeth of both species, neither of which is definitively known. If they are different between the two species, then the similarities would be due to convergence. If they are the same tooth, then it may suggest a close phylogenetic relation and African origins for the aye-aye. If Plesiopithecus is an African relative of the aye-aye, it would suggest lemuroid primates colonized Madagascar twice. Molecular studies show that the aye-aye diverged early in the evolutionary history of lemurs, followed later by a sudden burst of diversification of the other four lemur families. If Plesiopithecus is an aye-aye relative, lemurs and aye-ayes would have diverged in Africa and the aye-aye ancestor would have colonized Madagascar separately from the other lemurs, which would have diversified immediately upon arrival to the island. If aye-ayes are more closely related to lemurs than Plesiopithecus, then only one colonization event occurred, with the aye-aye branching off first and then the other lemuroid families diverging several million years later following a major extinction event.  Taxonomy  Plesiopithecus teras was first described in 1992 by paleoanthropologist Elwyn L. Simons. The holotype, which was found at the base of the Jebel Qatrani Formation at the Egyptian Fayum in quarry L-41 and dated to the latest Eocene, included a right mandible with intact dentition ranging from the third molar up to the first anterior tooth. Simons acknowledged that the taxonomic interpretation was complicated, though he initially decided to classify under superfamily Hominoidea (apes) due to its flat and broad lower molars. Its bizarre and specialized traits made it difficult to classify until the discovery of its skull, reported in 1994, showed it had a postorbital bar, proving that it was a strepsirrhine primate. Plesiopithecus was then placed within a new superfamily, Plesiopithecoidea tentatively under \\"Infraorder cf. Lorisiformes\\". The superfamily has also been grouped under the infraorder Lemuriformes. As of 2010, P. teras was represented by a nearly complete and partially crushed cranium and three partial mandibles. Prior to Simons' discovery of the right jaw, one of its molars had been found a few years earlier and incorrectly attributed to an Eocene lorisoid. Several cranial and facial similarities with living lorisoids indicate that it is closely related to lemuriforms (lemurs and lorisoids), although its lack of a toothcomb precludes it from being ancestral to either branch of the lemuriform clade. Due to the differences in dental anatomy, Plesiopithecus is thought to be a sister group to either lorisoids or all living lemuriforms.  Anatomy and physiology  With a skull length of nearly , Plesiopithecus was a medium- sized strepsirrhine primate. Its skull is marked by a high muzzle, klinorhynchy, and relatively large orbits. It has very large and procumbent upper canines that are straight and compressed on both sides, and have roots that extend deep into the maxilla (upper jaw). No upper incisors have been found. The unidentified lower front tooth is also enlarged and procumbent. It has three premolars and three molars that decrease in size from front to back. The upper molars are simple and lack a hypocone. The lower molars are relatively broad.  Behavior  Its large orbits suggest Plesiopithecus was nocturnal. Due to cranial and dental similarities with the aye-aye and signs of wear on the tips of its front teeth, it is thought to have bored holes in wood in search of soft-bodied insects, which likely make up its diet.

It crashed from Melbourne. All ten occupants were killed in the accident. The aircraft was one of four Stinsons imported in 1936 by Airlines of Australia (AoA). Three had now crashed with the loss of 17 lives, and the fourth would not be permitted to fly again. It was determined that the accident was caused by a fatigue crack in the main spar of the left wing that caused the outer part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, to separate from the remainder of the aircraft. The expert panel investigating the accident believed this to be the first fatal aircraft accident anywhere in the world directly attributable to metal fatigue. Stinson Model A in original trimotor configuration The accident and related matters were investigated by a Supreme Court judge who also found that the aircraft's left wing failed in flight due to a fatigue crack. The judge made five recommendations including one that a safe flying life should be fixed for each metal aircraft registered in Australia to avoid further failures due to metal fatigue. This practice is now called safe-lifeing. The flight The aircraft was a modified Stinson Model A registered VH-UYY and operated by Australian National Airways (ANA) as the Tokana. On 31 January 1945 the Tokana departed from Melbourne's Essendon Airport at 7:55 am local time for a flight to Broken Hill, stopping at Kerang and Mildura. On board were two pilots and eight passengers. A strong and gusting wind was blowing from the south-west and the sky was mostly overcast with the base of the clouds about above sea level. About 20 minutes after takeoff the aircraft was approaching Redesdale and several people observed it flying about above ground level, just below the cloud base. Several witnesses reported hearing a sharp crack followed by cessation of noise from the engines. When they looked up they saw the Stinson spiralling downwards. Part of one wing had separated from the remainder of the aircraft and it was drifting slowly towards the ground. As they watched, they saw the whole tail assembly break free from the fuselage. Moments later the wreckage struck the ground and a pall of black smoke rose into the air.\\"A.N.A. Plane Exploded In Mid Air\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 1 February 1945, p.2 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 Part of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, continued to drift down slowly and reached the ground about ¬æ mile (1.2 km) from the main wreckage.

The bodies of the eight passengers were found in what remained of the cabin but were burned beyond recognition. The violent gyration of the fuselage threw the two pilots through the roof of the cockpit. Their bodies were found unburned from the main wreckage. The tail of the aircraft broke away from the fuselage and fell to the ground about from the main wreckage. The outer section of the left wing, outboard of the engine nacelle, was found about ¬æ mile (1.2 km) from the main wreckage. Apart from the fracture surfaces on the inboard ends of the spars it was almost undamaged. The right wing was torn into three sections by the violence of the gyrations and struck the ground from the main wreckage. The right engine was torn away from the right wing and struck the ground about from the main wreckage. It was slightly damaged by the fire. The main wreckage trail was about long.\\"Fatal Passenger Plane Crash\\" The Argus ‚Äì 1 February 1945, p.7 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 In the gyrations of the aircraft after separation of the outer part of the left wing, other parts broke free and separated from the main wreckage. Many small pieces of wreckage were found scattered over a wide area. The aircraft The Stinson Model A was a tri-motor with three Lycoming R-680 radial engines, each of . It was approved to fly at a maximum weight of . Four Stinson Model A aircraft were imported to Australia in 1936 and operated by Airlines of Australia. After the outbreak of war in the Pacific in December 1941, Airlines of Australia had found it impossible to obtain spare parts for the Lycoming R-680 engines in its two remaining Stinsons (a Stinson had crashed in February 1937 and another in March 1937). In early 1943 the decision was made to convert both aircraft to twin-engine configuration by removing the Lycoming engines and installing a 9-cylinder Pratt & Whitney R-1340-AN1 Wasp engine on each wing. These engines had been imported to Australia in large numbers for use as tank engines. The noses of the two aircraft were to be re-built by installing streamlined structures made of aluminium sheet. By October 1943 VH-UYY had been converted to twin-engine configuration in the Essendon Airport facilities of Australian National Airways which had taken over Airlines of Australia. The increase in total power from improved the takeoff, climb and one-engine-inoperative performance of the aircraft and permitted the maximum weight to be increased to for takeoff. For the next 15 months Tokana was used on the Melbourne-Kerang- Mildura-Broken Hill route. VH-UYY flew for 13,763 hours, including 2,797 hours since its conversion to a twin-engine aeroplane. Investigation Investigators were able to determine the most likely sequence of the in-flight break-up: #left outer wing #tail assembly #right wing #right engine Investigators found nothing in the wreckage to indicate there had been an explosion or fire in the aircraft prior to it striking the ground. It was immediately clear that the outer part of the left wing had broken away from the aircraft. The lower boom in the main spar had failed at the outboard edge of the engine nacelle and then the upper boom had also failed as the result of the wing folding upwards under the air loads imposed on it. The rear spar had then failed, allowing the entire outer part of the wing to separate from the aircraft and drift slowly to the ground. The fracture surfaces on the outer part of the left wing were examined by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research at its Division of Aeronautics in Melbourne. These examinations determined that separation of the left wing was initiated by metal fatigue of the lower main spar boom attachment socket. The primary structure of the Stinson was of welded steel tube construction. A fatigue crack had initiated in weld metal on the inner surface of the socket. After propagating through the weld metal during a large number of flights, the fatigue crack entered the socket's parent metal. This crack eventually affected 45% of the cross-section of the socket before the lower boom failed on the fatal flight. Investigators noted the amount of metal in the socket that was unaffected by the fatigue crack at the time of the accident and calculated that the wing was capable of supporting loads up to about 2.5 times the weight of the aircraft on its fatal flight. This suggested the gusting winds prevailing at the time, and the turbulence associated with the low altitude at which the aircraft was flying, were partly responsible for the failure.\\"Air Liner Crash Due To Unseen Crack In Wing\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 24 February 1945, p.2 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012\\"Crack In Joint Led To Stinson Crash\\" The Argus ‚Äì 24 February 1945, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 The matching socket in the spar in the right wing was also examined and found to be affected by a similar fatigue crack in the interior of the weld metal. This crack was detected by magnaflux inspection but could not be seen by visual examination. The Investigation Panel determined that the conversion from three-engine to two-engine configuration was not a cause of the accident. It found that fatigue failure of the wing was inevitable, and this modification and subsequent operation at a higher weight caused only slight shortening of the time before the failure occurred. In its report, the Investigation Panel wrote: > \\"The crash is, as far as is known to the Panel, the first example of a > failure inflight of an aircraft structure attributable directly to fatigue. > \\"In the type of construction embodied in these aircraft, where concentrated > loads are carried by a small number of heavy members, a single fatigue > failure can, and in fact has caused, a complete structural collapse. > \\"The Panel feels impelled to assert that neither the original design nor > the original manufacture was at fault ... the tragedy has several new > lessons to teach all concerned with aviation, and that learning provides > some small degree of compensation for the loss of valuable human lives.\\" The Investigation Panel's report was completed in two weeks and included five recommendations: #Critical joints of all heat treated, welded steel tube aircraft structures should be examined annually by the magnaflux method. #The unique nature of the accident should be drawn to the attention of the Australian Council for Aeronautics. The Council should be asked to study the phenomenon of metal fatigue in aircraft structures. #The certificate of airworthiness of VH-UKK Binana, the sole Stinson Model A surviving in Australia, should be cancelled immediately. #Both wings of VH-UKK should be sent to the Division of Aeronautics laboratories for test and examination to advance the knowledge of fatigue of aircraft structures. #The Department of Civil Aviation should obtain a suitable number of V-G recorders and install them in airline aircraft operating in Australia to survey the conditions arising on major air routes. The Minister for Civil Aviation, Mr Arthur Drakeford, made a detailed statement to Parliament that an undetected fatigue crack in a welded joint in a boom attachment fitting in the left wing caused the crash. Drakeford also said he was satisfied the work of the Investigation Panel was completed competently and thoroughly. Inquiry Mr Joseph Clark, a member of parliament, had flown in Tokana five days prior to the crash. Two Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) aircraft mechanics who were fellow- passengers had shown him a small crack in the aircraft's elevator hinge bracket.\\"Evidence Of Crack In Airliner's Elevator Hinge\\" The Argus ‚Äì 29 March 1945, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 Clark had advised the two to tell the pilot about the crack if they thought it was serious.

He repeated his statement in the House of Representatives.\\"Alleged Defect In Elevator Of ANA Plane\\" The Canberra Times ‚Äì 3 February 1945, p.2 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 There was also criticism from Mr Thomas White that the Investigation Panel's report had not focussed attention on the major alteration involved in the conversion from a three-engined aeroplane to a two- engined aeroplane. Thomas White was a member of parliament and a former RAAF group captain. Following this criticism in the Parliament House of Representatives the Minister for Civil Aviation, Arthur Drakeford, appointed Mr Justice Philp of the Supreme Court of Queensland to conduct an inquiry into the accident using the powers of the National Security Act.\\"Judge For Stinson Crash\\" The Argus ‚Äì 2 March 1945, p.6 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012\\"Inquiry Into Crash Of Stinson\\" The Argus ‚Äì 28 March 1945, p.8 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 The Air Court of Inquiry first sat on 27 March 1945 in Melbourne, chaired by Mr Justice Philp. The terms of reference for the Inquiry were to inquire into the causes of the accident; to investigate Mr Clark's allegations about a crack in the elevator hinge bracket; and to investigate Mr White's concerns that the Investigation Panel had neglected to consider the significant alteration made by removing three engines and replacing them with two engines. The Inquiry heard evidence that the annual inspection of VH-UYY had been completed on 2 November 1944 and since then it had flown for 525 hours.\\"Expert Says Cracked Bracket Did Not Cause Crash\\" The Argus ‚Äì 31 March 1945, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012\\"Stinson Completely Airworthy\\" The Argus ‚Äì 4 April 1945, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 At an inspection of this kind it was possible to examine most of the welded joints in the wing, but not the welded spar joint that ultimately failed.

The Inquiry also heard that the maximum weights of all civil aircraft registered in Australia were determined conservatively and in a manner that was consistent with the International Convention on Aerial Navigation. The increase in maximum weight of VH-UYY was only granted after all appropriate calculations had been performed to ensure the aircraft was safe at the increased weight.\\"Conservative Loads Fixed For Planes\\" The Argus ‚Äì 5 April 1945, p.4 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 Mr Justice Philp presented the Court's report to the Governor-General on 10 April 1945.

It found that the presence of a crack in the elevator hinge bracket could not be determined but even if a crack had been present it had not contributed to the cause of the accident. It also found that the change of engines was not part of the cause of the accident but the increase in maximum weight had caused the accident to occur a little earlier than would have happened otherwise.\\"Inquiry Into Stinson Crash Ends\\" The Argus ‚Äì 6 April 1945, p.5 (National Library of Australia) Retrieved 25 May 2012 Mr Justice Philp's report contained five recommendations: #Ground engineers and aircraft inspectors should receive instruction in the inspection of welding in aircraft structures. #ANA should be given a licence to import a detector for examining welding used in aircraft structures.

The accident drew public attention to the potential for metal fatigue to cause sudden failure of the structure of a modern civil aircraft. The Department of Civil Aviation began a practice of calculating the safe retirement life of metal aircraft registered in Australia. In December 1946 the University of Melbourne organised an international symposium titled The Failure of Metals by Fatigue, the first such symposium in an English-speaking country. Five of the thirty technical papers presented at the symposium dealt specifically with the problem of metal fatigue in aircraft. The Structures and Materials Division of the Division of Aeronautics laboratory at Fishermen's Bend, Melbourne began a long-term program aimed at advancing the knowledge of metal fatigue in aircraft structures. Surplus wings, manufactured by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation during its licence-production of North American P-51 Mustang aircraft, were tested by repeated loading to examine the characteristics of fatigue in aircraft structures. Eventually, approximately 200 Mustang wings were tested in this way.

The method  Let P and c be arrays of length n with 1-based indexing (i.e. the first entry of an array has index 1). The algorithm for generating all n! permutations of the set {1, 2, ..., n} is given by the following pseudocode: P ‚Üê [1, 2, ..., n]; yield P; c ‚Üê [*, 1, ..., 1]; (the first entry of c is not used) i ‚Üê 2; while i ‚â§ n do left- rotate the first i entries of P; (e.g. left-rotating the first 4 entries of [4, 2, 5, 3, 1] would give [2, 5, 3, 4, 1]) if c[i] < i then c[i] ‚Üê c[i] + 1; i ‚Üê 2; yield P; else c[i] ‚Üê 1; i ‚Üê i+1; In the above pseudocode, the statement \\"yield P\\" means to output or record the set of permuted indices P. If the algorithm is implemented correctly, P will be yielded exactly n! times, each with a different set of permuted indices.

All computer clusters, ranging from homemade Beowulfs to some of the fastest supercomputers in the world, rely on message passing to coordinate the activities of the many nodes they encompass.Beowulf Cluster Computing With Windows by Thomas Lawrence Sterling 2001 MIT Press pages 7‚Äì9 Message passing in computer clusters built with commodity servers and switches is used by virtually every internet service.Computer Organization and Design by David A. Patterson and John L. Hennessy 2011 page 641 Recently, the use of computer clusters with more than one thousand nodes has been spreading. As the number of nodes in a cluster increases, the rapid growth in the complexity of the communication subsystem makes message passing delays over the interconnect a serious performance issue in the execution of parallel programs.Recent Advances in the Message Passing Interface by Yiannis Cotronis, Anthony Danalis, Dimitris Nikolopoulos and Jack Dongarra 2011 pages 160‚Äì162 Specific tools may be used to simulate, visualize and understand the performance of message passing on computer clusters. Before a large computer cluster is assembled, a trace-based simulator can use a small number of nodes to help predict the performance of message passing on larger configurations. Following test runs on a small number of nodes, the simulator reads the execution and message transfer log files and simulates the performance of the messaging subsystem when many more messages are exchanged between a much larger number of nodes. Messages and computations=Approaches to message passing Historically, the two typical approaches to communication between cluster nodes have been PVM, the Parallel Virtual Machine and MPI, the Message Passing Interface.Distributed services with OpenAFS: for enterprise and education by Franco Milicchio, Wolfgang Alexander Gehrke 2007, pp. 339-341 However, MPI has now emerged as the de facto standard for message passing on computer clusters.Recent Advances in Parallel Virtual Machine and Message Passing Interface by Matti Ropo, Jan Westerholm and Jack Dongarra 2009 page 231 PVM predates MPI and was developed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory around 1989. It provides a set of software libraries that allow a computing node to act as a \\"parallel virtual machine\\". It provides run-time environment for message-passing, task and resource management, and fault notification and must be directly installed on every cluster node. PVM can be used by user programs written in C, C++, or Fortran, etc. Unlike PVM, which has a concrete implementation, MPI is a specification rather than a specific set of libraries. The specification emerged in the early 1990 out of discussions between 40 organizations, the initial effort having been supported by ARPA and National Science Foundation. The design of MPI drew on various features available in commercial systems of the time. The MPI specifications then gave rise to specific implementations. MPI implementations typically use TCP/IP and socket connections. MPI is now a widely available communications model that enables parallel programs to be written in languages such as C, Fortran, Python, etc.Grid and Cluster Computing by J. Prabhu 2008 pages 109‚Äì112 The MPI specification has been implemented in systems such as MPICH and Open MPI. Testing, evaluation and optimization The Virginia Tech Xserve cluster of Apple computers Computer clusters use a number of strategies for dealing with the distribution of processing over multiple nodes and the resulting communication overhead. Some computer clusters such as Tianhe-I use different processors for message passing than those used for performing computations. Tiahnhe-I uses over two thousand FeiTeng-1000 processors to enhance the operation of its proprietary message passing system, while computations are performed by Xeon and Nvidia Tesla processors.The TianHe-1A Supercomputer: Its Hardware and Software by Xue-Jun Yang, Xiang-Ke Liao, et al in the Journal of Computer Science and Technology, Volume 26, Number 3, May 2011, pages 344‚Äì351 U.S. says China building 'entirely indigenous' supercomputer, by Patrick Thibodeau Computerworld, November 4, 2010 One approach to reducing communication overhead is the use of local neighborhoods (also called locales) for specific tasks. Here computational tasks are assigned to specific \\"neighborhoods\\" in the cluster, to increase efficiency by using processors which are closer to each other. However, given that in many cases the actual topology of the computer cluster nodes and their interconnections may not be known to application developers, attempting to fine tune performance at the application program level is quite difficult. Given that MPI has now emerged as the de facto standard on computer clusters, the increase in the number of cluster nodes has resulted in continued research to improve the efficiency and scalability of MPI libraries. These efforts have included research to reduce the memory footprint of MPI libraries. From the earliest days MPI provided facilities for performance profiling via the PMPI \\"profiling system\\".What is PMPI? The use of the PMIPI- prefix allows for the observation of the entry and exit points for messages. However, given the high level nature of this profile, this type of information only provides a glimpse at the real behavior of the communication system. The need for more information resulted in the development of the MPI-Peruse system. Peruse provides a more detailed profile by enabling applications to gain access to state-changes within the MPI- library. This is achieved by registering callbacks with Peruse, and then invoking them as triggers as message events take place.Recent Advances in Parallel Virtual Machine and Message Passing Interface by Bernd Mohr, Jesper Larsson Tr√§ff, Joachim Worringen and Jack Dongarra 2006 page 347 Peruse can work with the PARAVER visualization system. PARAVER has two components, a trace component and a visual component for analyze the traces, the statistics related to specific events, etc. PARAVER: A Tool to Visualize and Analyze Parallel Code by Vincent Pillet et al, Proceedings of the conference on Transputer and Occam Developments, 1995, pages 17‚Äì31 PARAVER may use trace formats from other systems, or perform its own tracing. It operates at the task level, thread level, and in a hybrid format. Traces often include so much information that they are often overwhelming. Thus PARAVER summarizes them to allow users to visualize and analyze them.Computational Science-- Iccs 2003 edited by Peter M.A. Sloot, David Abramson, Alexander V. Bogdanov and Jack J. Dongarra page 183 Performance analysis When a large scale, often supercomputer level, parallel system is being developed, it is essential to be able to experiment with multiple configurations and simulate performance. There are a number of approaches to modeling message passing efficiency in this scenario, ranging from analytical models to trace-based simulation and some approaches rely on the use of test environments based on \\"artificial communications\\" to perform synthetic tests of message passing performance. Systems such as BIGSIM provide these facilities by allowing the simulation of performance on various node topologies, message passing and scheduling strategies.Petascale Computing: Algorithms and Applications by David A. Bader 2007 pages 435‚Äì435 Analytical approaches At the analytical level, it is necessary to model the communication time T in term of a set of subcomponents such as the startup latency, the asymptotic bandwidth and the number of processors. A well known model is Hockney's model which simply relies on point to point communication, using T = L + (M / R) where M is the message size, L is the startup latency and R is the asymptotic bandwidth in MB/s.Modeling Message Passing Overhead by C.Y Chou et al. in Advances in Grid and Pervasive Computing: First International Conference, GPC 2006 edited by Yeh-Ching Chung and Jos√© E. Moreira pages 299‚Äì307 Xu and Hwang generalized Hockney's model to include the number of processors, so that both the latency and the asymptotic bandwidth are functions of the number of processors.High-Performance Computing and Networking edited by Peter Sloot, Marian Bubak and Bob Hertzberge 1998 page 935 Gunawan and Cai then generalized this further by introducing cache size, and separated the messages based on their sizes, obtaining two separate models, one for messages below cache size, and one for those above. Performance simulation The IBM Roadrunner cluster supercomputer Specific tools may be used to simulate and understand the performance of message passing on computer clusters. For instance, CLUSTERSIM uses a Java-based visual environment for discrete-event simulation. In this approach computed nodes and network topology is visually modeled. Jobs and their duration and complexity are represented with specific probability distributions allowing various parallel job scheduling algorithms to be proposed and experimented with. The communication overhead for MPI message passing can thus be simulated and better understood in the context of large-scale parallel job execution.High Performance Computational Science and Engineering edited by Michael K. Ng, Andrei Doncescu, Laurence T. Yang and Tau Leng, 2005 pages 59‚Äì63 Other simulation tools include MPI-sim and BIGSIM.Advances in Computer Science, Environment, Ecoinformatics, and Education edited by Song Lin and Xiong Huang 2011 page 16 MPI-Sim is an execution-driven simulator that requires C or C++ programs to operate. ClusterSim, on the other hand uses a hybrid higher-level modeling system independent of the programming language used for program execution. Unlike MPI-Sim, BIGSIM is a trace-driven system that simulates based on the logs of executions saved in files by a separate emulator program.Languages and Compilers for Parallel Computing edited by Keith Cooper, John Mellor-Crummey and Vivek Sarkar 2011 pages 202‚Äì203 BIGSIM includes an emulator, and a simulator. The emulator executes applications on a small number of nodes and stores the results, so the simulator can use them and simulate activities on a much larger number of nodes. The emulator stores information of sequential execution blocks (SEBs) for multiple processors in log files, with each SEB recording the messages sent, their sources and destinations, dependencies, timings, etc. The simulator reads the log files and simulates them, and may star additional messages which are then also stored as SEBs. The simulator can thus provide a view of the performance of very large applications, based on the execution traces provided by the emulator on a much smaller number of nodes, before the entire machine is available, or configured.

The author is involved in the study of revealed knowledge, contained in the Qur'an and other religious scriptures for last several years. In the present book, he presents several pointers from the epistemological study of the Qur'an on the origin of life and man. These pointers try to explain where the life was created on the primeval earth, what is its link with the man, and how, where and when the first ancestor of modern man and his mate were created on earth. The research presented in the book differs from the traditional view and presents support from standard lexicons to explain how the Qur'anic/Arabic words were originally understood by Bedouins of the area. The book also argues that the phenomenon of Revelation is global and non-human, and several of its premises such as the human pair was born 59000 years ago from a female of a previous specie(s) are likely to generate a lot of controversy amongst the traditionalists of all faiths. The book suggests \\"collective scientific investigation\\" of the information by a panel of linguists, science historians and scientists of various disciplines, for in-depth verification of the research and premises made in the book. The book has outlined a mechanism based on information theory precepts for this purpose. Author's earlier book The Ultimate Revelations published in 1996 was a science fiction based on Qur'an.

Its common names include clusterleaf, silver cluster-leaf or silver terminalia in English, vaalboom in Afrikaans and mususu in Venda. Etymology The generic name is derived from the Latin terminus meaning \\"boundary\\" and describes the concentration of the foliage at the very end of the twigs. The specific name \\"sericea\\" comes from the Latin sericatus meaning \\"clothed in silken hair\\" and describes the downy foliage. Description The silver cluster-leaf grows to a height of about in woodland but isolated trees can be up to tall. The bark is a reddish or greyish brown colour and peels away in strips. The bluish-green leaves tend to be clustered at the tips of the branches. They are ovate with entire margins and both the upper and lower surfaces are clothed in silvery hairs. The flowers are white and are borne in short axilliary spikes. They have an unpleasant smell and may be pollinated by flies. The fruit are winged nuts containing a single seed and turn a darker pink colour as they ripen. They may remain attached to the branch for a year and are dispersed by the wind. They sometimes become contorted and hairy as a result of the activities of parasitic insect larvae. Distribution and habitat The silver cluster-leaf is endemic to Africa from Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo southwards to South Africa. It grows in open mixed woodland on sandy soils. It is often found growing with miombo (Brachystegia spp.), mopane (Colophospermum mopane), Acacia spp. and bush willows (Combretum spp.). It is often one of the dominant species in mixed woodland. Requirements Close-up of the inflorescence, December Ripening fruit, February The silver cluster-leaf grows readily from seed. It is a pioneer species, easily becoming established in previously unwooded areas and may form dense shrubby thickets. It is tolerant of waterlogged soils and of drought conditions and fairly tolerant of saline soils. It needs full light to grow well and tends to shade out weeds so its presence helps climax species to become established. It has been used in land improvement and to control erosion. The leaves are shed in autumn and flowering takes place after the rainy season has started and the new foliage developed. Flowering may be reduced after a bush fire. Uses The timber of the silver cluster-leaf is yellow and hard-grained and is resistant to attack by wood-boring insects and termites. It is used in building construction and to make tool handles, furniture and fencing posts. It is used for firewood and the making of charcoal. The bark has been used to make ropes and is also pounded to produce a substance for waterproofing boats. The leaves are eaten by cattle during the dry season when grass becomes unavailable. In traditional medicine, both leaves and roots have been used as a remedy for stomach ailments and a concoction of the roots for treating bilharzia, diarrhoea and pneumonia. The bark is used against diabetes and to dress wounds.

It was the scene of lively conversations between Catalan artists Santiago Rusinol, Ramon Casas, Maurice Utrillo, Pablo Picasso and Isidre Nonell. Casas decorated the cafe with two large paintings: \\"one, entitled Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem, features the painter with Pere Romeu, the owner of the cafe, on a bicycle; the other depicts the car which Casas, one of the first car owners in Catalonia, drove himself.Art i esport a Catalunya, p. 19.

Description  Giving the poster its allure, a female cyclist dressed in a black and white dress with hints of red details on her sash and bow, is the main focus.

Taking inspiration from English graphic art, \\"Riquer incorporated elements from many diverse influences; this ability to assimilate a range of styles helped him produce highly creative works and put an end to the banal, literary quality that had dominated poster aesthetics until then.

He was one of the leading figures of Modernism in Catalonia. Riquer studied at B√©ziers, located in France from 1869 to 1871. For his interest in drawing classes, he enrolled in the School of Fine Arts in Toulouse of Languedoc. In the year 1894, he was introduced to the movement of the pre-Raphaelites. Riquer distinguished himself as a graphic designer with great drawing skills. He created posters, etchings, illustrations, certificates, postcards, stamps, menus, sheet music, business cards, and bookplates (which Llu√≠s de Yebra documented 142 articles between 1900 and 1924).Alexandre de Riquer  Analysis  Salon Pedal is one of Alexandre de Riquer's notable works which he created during the evolution of his art career as a professional graphic artist in Barcelona. He was known to experiment with many different styles from the very beginning of his art training; From traditional landscape painting to mastery of illustrative creations.

The outcome was a Muslim victory.  Context  After the death of Emir Abd ar- Rahman II in the year 852, the population in the area around Toledo rose in revolt as they had done on many previous occasions. Their reasons were both internal, such as corrupt governance, and external as they identified more with the Christian kingdoms to the north. They also frequently were harassed by the Moz√°rabes people who resided in the Muslim borderlands. Hence, the people of Toledo rose in arms, seeking the assistance of the Kingdom of Asturias and Basques as is reported by Ibn Khaldun, quoting verbatim from Spanish-language chronicles of the tenth century:  The battle  The organized forces of Muhammad I were easily able to rout the town rabble and their Christian men at arms from Asturias and Navarre. They were however, unable to take the actual city for another 7 years.  Consequences  After the Toledan and Asturian forces were defeated at Guadalacete, Muhammad I failed to capture the city. The rebellion, which was inspired by the Christian clergy and aided by the Muladi, was prolonged until the year 858 due to a continued desire for independence from Cordoba. In 858 Muhammad finally conquered the city and jailed Bishop Eugenio; he was executed the following year.

The movement is supported by Ganga Seva Abhiyanam, Pune-based National Women's Organisation (NWO) besides those of many other like-minded organisations and with the moral support from many religious leaders, spiritual and political, scientists, environmentalists, writers and social activists. Ganga Calling ‚Äì Save Ganga is another such campaign supported by Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action (ICELA).  Causes  Pollution at the ghats of Varanasi. Ganga Dashahara in 2005 brought throngs of bathers to the riverfront in Haridwar. (Religious association of Ganga also accounts for an appreciable degree of pollution.) Wastes and left overs of tours and picnics flowing in Ganges. Timeline of retreat of Gangotri glacier. (Note that the blue contour lines drawn here to show the recession of the glacier‚Äôs terminus over time are approximate.) Ganges is the largest and the most sacred river of India with enormous spiritual, cultural, and physical influence. It provides water to about 40% of India's population in 11 states. It is estimated that the livelihoods of over 500 million people in India are dependent upon the river, and that one-third of India's population lives within the Ganges Basin. Despite this magnitude of influence and control by the river over present and future of the country, it is allegedly under direct threat from various man made and natural environmental issues. Pollution River Ganges flows through the most densely populated regions of India passing 29 cities with population over 100,000, 23 cities with population between 50,000 and 100,000, and about 48 towns. A sizeable proportion of the effluents in Ganges are caused by this population through domestic usage like bathing, laundry and public defecation. Countless tanneries, chemical plants, textile mills, distilleries, slaughterhouses, and hospitals contribute to the pollution of the Gangas by dumping untreated toxic and non-biodegradable waste into it.\\"Sacred Ganges Carries Toxic Pollution.\\" It is this sheer volume of pollutants released into the river every day that are causing irreparable damage to the ecosystem and contributing to significant sanitation issues. Dams Built in 1854 during the British colonisation of India, the Haridwar dam has led to decay of the Ganges by greatly diminishing the flow of the river. The Farakka Barrage was built originally to divert fresh water into the Bhagirathi River but has since caused an increase of salinity in the Ganges, having a damaging effect on the ground water and soil along the river. Apart from this, Bangladesh and India faced major tensions due to this barrage. The government of India planned about 300 dams on the Ganges in the near future and the tributaries despite a government-commissioned green panel report that has recommended scrapping 34 of the dams citing environmental concerns.\\"300 dams on the Ganga: A bane or a boon?\\" Global warming Gangotri glacier which feeds the river Ganges is 30.2 km long and between 0.5 and 2.5 km wide is one of the largest in the Himalaya. However, Due to global warming it has been receding since 1780, although studies show its retreat quickened after 1971. Over the last 25 years, Gangotri glacier has retreated more than 850 meters, with a recession of 76 meters from 1996 to 1999 alone. The UN 2007 Climate Change Report has suggested that the glacial flow may completely stop by 2030, at which point the Ganges would be reduced to a seasonal river during the monsoon season.  Failure of Ganga Action Plan  The Ganga Action Plan or GAP was a program launched by Rajiv Gandhi in April 1986 to reduce the pollution load on the river. But the efforts to decrease the pollution level in the river became abortive even after spending ‚Çπ 9017.1 million (~190 million USD adjusting to inflation).Ganga Action Plan Therefore, this plan was withdrawn on 31 March 2000. This plan is described as failure by many scientist and NGOs in their studies.  Background  The movement did not build up suddenly. Concerns about the condition of the Ganges were raised for decades which gained impetus in the past few years owing to awareness and support from keen environmentalists. Furthermore, different studies revealed the deteriorating health of the river. In 1998, Smt Rama Rauta, the founder of National Women's Organization (NWO) under the leadership of Dr. Sushila Nair conceived the necessity to initiate public mobilization based on the principles of non-violence to seek support for Save Ganga Movement ‚Äì against the pollution of the Ganges and its tributaries. A seminar on Ganga aur hamaaraa daayitvaon (Ganga and our duty) was conducted on 13 November 1998 at Kanpur. Soon popular Gandhians, Shri Sunderlal Bahuguna and Dr. Kanchanlata Sabarwal, also joined the Movement.  Movement  Swami Avimukteshwaranand Sarasvatƒ´, convener of Gangas Seva Abhiyanam alleged the Central Government of overhearing their demands and trying to obstruct the movement.  Mega rally of June 2012  Moved by the government's inaction towards saving the Ganges, the eminent Ganga Mukti Sangram Saamiti decided to initiate a mass drive by gathering thousands of Ganga Devotees along with the Ganga Rath which travelled through Varanasi on 14 June and then to Allahabad, Kanpur, Matura, Vrindavan and finally reach to Delhi on 17 June. Shankaracharya of Dwarka Sharda Pithas Swami Svar≈´pƒÅnanda Sarasvatƒ´ who also joined the movement at Jantar Mantar in Delhi gave an ultimatum of three months to the Central government over the government's apathetic attitude towards the protection and conservation of the National River.  Activists Swami Jitendranand Saraswati alias Acharya Jitendra= Swami Jitendranand Saraswati alias Acharya Jitendra is National General Secretary of Ganga Mahasabha. He is working for Ganga since 2000. He is a well known Social Activist(Environmentalist) in India. It was his effort to convince Mr. Lal Krishna Advani in 2008 to compel the Chief Minister B.C. Khanduri to abandon all state hydro-dam projects on the Ganga and persuade Professor Guru Das Agrawal G. D. Agrawal to give up his fast within 24 hours. In 2010 Again Acharya Jitendra played a crucial role to stop the Loharinag Pala Hydel Project ‚Äì On The Ganga. As K.N. Govinda said he worked behind the scenes for three years, interfacing with people and like Baba Ramdev and Acharya Jitendra, environmentalists and politicians of all hues. He even approached senior Congress leaders for their support. When a favourable atmosphere was created, he met Pranab Mukherjee, leading a delegation of the Ganga Mahasabha. He then spoke to senior Vishva Hindu Parishad leader Ashok Singhal and the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs Rajnath Singh, who persuaded CM Ramesh Pokhriyal to write to the PM, asking him to scrap the Loharinag Pala project. =Nigamanand= In early 2011, a Hindu seer named Swami Nigamananda Saraswati fasted unto death, protesting against illegal mining happening in the district of Haridwar (in Uttarakhand) resulting in pollution. Following his death in June 2011, his Ashram leader Swami Shivananda fasted for 11 days starting on 25 November 2011, taking his movement forward. Finally, the Uttarakhand government released an order to ban illegal mining all over Haridwar district.\\"Shivanand breaks fast after forcing curb on Ganga bed quarrying\\" According to administration officials, quarrying in the Ganges would now be studied by a special committee which would assess its environmental impacts the river and its nearby areas. =Prof. G. D. Agrawal= Noted environmental activist, Prof. G. D. Agrawal Patron of Ganga Mahasabha sat ng construction in this sensitive and sacred region of India. Due to support from other social activists like Anna Hazare, the Prime Minister of India, Manmohan Singh admitted publicly to cease any further hydroelectric damming of the Ganga in Uttarakhand. He also called for a National River Ganga Basin Authority (NRGBA) meeting and urged the authorities to utilize the 26 billion (about 520M US$) sanctioned \\"for creating sewer networks, sewage treatment plants, sewage pumping stations, electric crematoria, community toilets and development of river fronts\\". =Narendra Modi= Chief Minister of Gujarat, now Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi has been very bent on the issue of the holy river, and has promised the Parliament of India to clean the river as the density of coli-form bacteria have risen from 5,000 per 100ml to 58,000 per 100ml, nearly 121 times over the acceptable limit. So far, ‚Çπ 20,000 crore has gone into the cleaning of the Ganga. Narendra Modi has also offered the gifts he received during his tenure as PM of the nation for bidding. The amount received from the bidding will be utilized for the cause. = Rama Rauta = Rama Rauta founded the Save Ganga Movement in 1998 with a seminar on 'Ganga Aur Humara Daayitva' at Kanpur understanding the need of a nationwide collective movement to the cause and also a need of a holistic solution to the various issues faced by the river. She conceptualised the movement with Gandhian ideology and soon this movement was supported or joined by various eminent Gandhians, religious leaders from various faiths, legal experts , eminent political leaders and various scientific organisations such as IIT, CSIR labs such as NEERI, NBRI, ITRC and many like-minded NGOs. A holistic roadmap detailing short-term and long-term solution to the impending ecological crisis drafted by the continuous churning of the intellectuals associated with this movement has been a reference guide to the Governments working towards making the Ganga \\"Aviral \\" and \\"Nirmal\\".  Demands  The movement is solely aimed at one goal ‚Äì to prevent the anti- nature, anti-human, anti-environment activities against Ganges and sustain the cultural importance, holiness and age old heritage of the same. Though most of the demands are directly related to the pollution and construction works overs Ganges, there are ought to be several demands related indirectly to these.  No construction  It is demanded that the Upper course of Ganges should be strictly disallowed any kind of damming and construction work. It should be declared a Wild River zone and visits by tourists and people to Gangotri National Park should also be regulated and toned down. Eco-friendly tourism should replace the present eco-hostile tourism. Time-bound steps for non- commercial afforestation of the Uttarakhand should be undertaken and these activities should be carried by the local people, using samplings of local plants. This demand was backed by a recent report prepared by the state-funded Wildlife Institute of India that recommended scrapping 34 of the Ganges dam projects, citing environmental concerns.  Pollution regulation  Ganga suffer from a large scale pollution due to common practices like bathing, washing, putting flowers and idols into the river creating filthy and unhygienic conditions. Dismal civic conditions, bad smell and unavailability of basic amenities like toilets and changing rooms could be seen. Most of the ghats could be seen with a series of iron grills erected on stony platform, laden with heaps of garbage and rotten stuff. Animal loitering on ghats, troubling the residents and devotees is the other problem. It is necessary to frame some rules and guidelines for the Civic authorities and municipalities to carry out a scheduled and continued cleaning effort from the concerned officials.  Industrialization control  Since, Industries dump a large quantity of inorganic and non-bio degradable wastes into the Ganga and other rivers, It is demanded that further establishments of any kind of new Industry with poor management shouldn't be undertaken. Also, those who are flouting the pollution regulation norms should be checked at once. Afforestation and efforts to save wild life in the Himalayas should be regulated by a high powered committee.  Awareness  Mass awareness against environmental degradation, especially against pollution of air, water and land and deforestation and destruction of wildlife should be undertaken. :* T.V. and Radio are to be persuaded to give a substantial amount of prime time to create such awareness, informing regularly about the water pollution levels of major rivers and of air pollution levels in big cities and their adverse effect on the common people. :* National laboratories such as NEERI, Thermal Research Centre (CPRI), etc., must regularly monitor the pollution levels of major rivers and inform the public about the hazardous effects through various forms of mass media. :* A comprehensive website on the Ganges and other rivers of our country should be created for networking of various organisations and people involved in the Ganga Action Plan and for creating necessary mass- awareness for saving the Ganges and other rivers of our country. :* Environmental ethics should be taught as a part of the syllabus on ethics, both at the school as well as at the college level. Teaching environmental ethics without discussing the value and means of an ethical life would be of little significance. We must study critically the views of great religions and of great teachers and thinkers of mankind about various fundamental issues of ethics.  Monitoring committee  It is demanded that a committee of experts to monitor the progress of the governmental course of actions in this direction should be appointed. It should report all of its findings and actions to the Supreme Court of India which direct the Central and State Governments.  Government's efforts = Panel to review projects on Ganges  Amid the building pressure from the Hindu leaders in the June mega rally, the government proposed to set up an expert-panel which would review the situation and examine the ecological impact of hydel projects taken on the Himalayan rivers. The committee includes representatives from the ministries of environment, power, and water resources and other authorities and research institutions. From outside the government, the PMO has chosen director general of Centre for Science and Environment Sunita Narain, former professor of IIT- BHU and mahant of Sankat Mochan temple at Varanasi Virbhadra Mishra and head of Tarun Bharat Sangh-Rajendra Singh. The committee will also inspect previous reports by IIT Roorkee and Wildlife Institute of India.  NGRBA  To fulfill the demands of activists to have an independent monitoring committee for Ganges, the government has proposed to upgrade the existing National Ganga River Basin Authority (NRGBA) to the level of an independent commission along the lines of the National Human Rights Commission through a new law.  Controversies  * Those groups who backed the construction of Hydel Power projects on course of river Ganga, alleged that the agigators protesting against them were funded by US, so that India would buy Uranium from them to run its Nuclear Power Plants. * Controversies were raised about alleged fixing of the agitation among the sadhus and the Congress party. It is known that senior Congress leaders share old association with the Shankaracharya of Shrada Jyotish and Dwarka Peeths Swami Swaroopanand Saraswati. Since the launch of stir by the Ganga Seva Abhiyanam, initiated by the disciples of Shankaracharya, the latter stayed away. However, the union government soon sprung into action after the Shankaracharya reached the city to participate in the agitation. It raised rumours of having this meet up between the two to be fixed.  Present status  The movement which made most of the news for 168 days, culminated to a halt by its organizers after the then union coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal arrived in Delhi with the then PM Manmohan Singh's letter assuring of no new dam projects to start while works on those which have already started would also be stopped. An inter-ministerial committee constituted by the Prime Minister itself will submit its study report on dams creating hurdle in the flow of Ganga in the same period. It was decided by the organising committee that the Mahasangram would be halted only for three months and shall resume again in September if no sufficient action is taken.

Other names for major-thirds tuning include major-third tuning, M3 tuning, all-thirds tuning, and augmented tuning. By definition, a major-third interval separates two notes that differ by exactly four semitones (one-third of the twelve-note octave). The Spanish guitar's tuning mixes four perfect fourths (five semitones) and one major-third, the latter occurring between the G and B strings: :E-A-D-G-B-E. This tuning, which is used for acoustic and electric guitars, is called \\"standard\\" in English, a convention that is followed in this article. While standard tuning is irregular, mixing four fourths and one major third, M3 tunings are regular: Only major-third intervals occur between the successive strings of the M3 tunings, for example, the open augmented C tuning :G-C-E-G-C-E. For each M3 tuning, the open strings form an augmented triad in two octaves. For guitars with six strings, every major-third tuning repeats its three open-notes in two octaves, so providing many options for fingering chords. By repeating open- string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings, major-thirds tuning simplifies learning by beginners. These features also facilitate advanced guitarists' improvisation, precisely the aim of jazz guitarist Ralph Patt when he began popularizing major-thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964. Avoiding standard tuning's irregular intervals M3 tuning partitions its fretboard into four-fret segments. In standard tuning, the successive open- strings mix two types of intervals, four perfect-fourths and the major third between the G and B strings: :E-A-D-G-B-E. Only major thirds occur as open- string intervals for major-thirds tuning, which is also called \\"major-third tuning\\", \\"all-thirds tuning\\", and \\"M3 tuning\\". A popular M3 tuning has the open strings :G-C-E-G-C-E, in which the low G is a major third above the low E of standard tuning. Consequently, a seventh string for the low E is often added to restore the standard E-E range. While M3 tuning can use standard sets of guitar strings, specialized string gauges have been recommended. Besides this M3 tuning, which has the open notes {G, C, E}, there are exactly three other M3 tunings, which have distinct sets of open-note pitch classes. The other major-thirds tunings respectively have the open notes {A, C, F}, {A, D, F}, and {B, D, G}. For six-string guitars, the M3 tuning :F-A-D-F-A-D loses the two lowest semitones on the low-E string and the two highest semitones from the high-E string in standard tuning; it can use string sets for standard tuning. Properties Minor, major, and seventh chords are played with the same shape on two-three consecutive frets. Shifting a chord by three strings raises it by one octave. Chords are inverted by shifting notes by three strings on their original frets. Major-thirds tunings require less hand- stretching than other tunings, because each M3 tuning packs the octave's twelve notes into four consecutive frets. The major-third intervals allow major chords and minor chords to be played with two‚Äìthree consecutive fingers on two consecutive frets. Every major-thirds tuning is regular and repetitive, two properties that facilitate learning by beginners and improvisation by advanced guitarists. Four frets for the four fingers In major-thirds tuning, the chromatic scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets. This four-fret arrangement facilitates the left-hand technique for classical (Spanish) guitar: For each hand position of four frets, the hand is stationary and the fingers move, each finger being responsible for one fret. Consequently, three hand-positions (covering frets 1‚Äì4, 5‚Äì8, and 9‚Äì12) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar, which has exactly 12 frets. Only two or three frets are needed for the guitar chords‚Äîmajor, minor, and dominant sevenths‚Äîwhich are emphasized in introductions to guitar-playing and to the fundamentals of music. Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings, and therefore each needs only two fingers. Other chords‚Äîseconds, fourths, sevenths, and ninths‚Äîare played on only three successive frets. For fundamental-chord fingerings, major-thirds tuning's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning, whose seventh-chord fingering is discussed at the end of this section. Repetition Each major-thirds tuning repeats its open-notes after every two strings, which results in two copies of the three open-strings' notes, each in a different octave. This repetition again simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation. This advantage is not shared by two popular regular-tunings, all-fourths and all-fifths tuning. Chord inversion is especially simple in major-thirds tuning. Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings. The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes. Thus, major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3 tuning even when they are inverted. In contrast, inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets, in standard tuning, the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major-third. Regular musical-intervals In each regular tuning, the musical intervals are the same for each pair of consecutive strings. Other regular tunings include all-fourths, augmented- fourths, and all-fifths tunings. For each regular tuning, chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard, a property that simplifies beginners' learning of chords and advanced players' improvisation. In contrast, chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in standard tuning, which requires four chord- shapes for the major chords: There are separate fingerings for chords having root notes on one of the four strings three‚Äìsix. =Shifting chords: Vertical and diagonal= The repetition of the major-thirds tuning enables notes and chords to be raised one octave by being vertically shifted by three strings. Notes and chords may be shifted diagonally in major-thirds tuning, by combining a vertical shift of one string with a horizontal shift of four frets: \\"Like all regular tunings, chords in the major third tuning can be moved across the fretboard (ascending or descending a major third for each string)....\\" In standard tuning, playing scales of one octave requires three patterns, which depend on the string of the root note. Chords cannot be shifted diagonally without changing finger-patterns. Standard tuning has four finger-patterns for musical intervals, four forms for basic major-chords, and three forms for the inversion of the basic major-chords. Open chords and beginning players { \\\\clef \\"treble_8\\" \\\\time 6/4 < c, e, aes, c e aes c' e' aes' >1.  < c, e, aes, >2 4 4 4 < c, e, aes, >4  < c e aes >2 4 4 4 < c e aes >4  2 4 4 4 < c' e' aes' >4  1\\\\. } Sevenths chords, constructed in closed position by stacking third intervals on the C-major scale, are played on 3 frets in M3 tuning. Major-thirds tunings are unconventional open tunings, in which the open strings form an augmented triad. In M3 tunings, the augmented fifth replaces the perfect fifth of the major triad, which is used in conventional open-tunings. For example, the C-augmented triad (C,E,G) has a G in place of the C-major triad's G. (The note G is enharmonically equivalent to A, as noted above.) Consequently, M3 tunings are also called (open) augmented-fifth tunings (in French \\"La guitare #5, majeure quinte augment√©e\\"). Instructional literature uses standard tuning. Traditionally a course begins with the hand in first position, that is, with the left-hand covering frets 1‚Äì4. Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C, G, and D. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major-keys and their relative minor-keys (Am, Em, Bm) may prefer standard tuning over an M3 tuning. In particular, hobbyists playing folk music around a campfire are well served by standard tuning. Such hobbyists may also play major-thirds tuning, which also has many open chords with notes on five or six strings; chords with five-six strings have greater volume than chords with three-four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars (for example, acoustic-electric guitars without amplification). Intermediate guitarists do not limit themselves to one hand-position, and consequently open chords are only part of their chordal repertoire. In contemporary music, master guitarists \\"think diagonally and move up and down the strings\\"; fluency on the entire fretboard is needed particularly by guitarists playing jazz. According to its inventor, Ralph Patt, major-thirds tuning > \\"makes the hard things easy and the easy things hard. [...] This is never > going to take the place of folk guitar, and it's not meant to. For difficult > music, and for where we are going in free jazz and even the old be-bop jazz, > this is a much easier way to play.\\" Left-handed chords Major-thirds tuning is closely related to minor- sixths tuning, which is the regular tuning that is based on the minor sixth, the interval of eight semitones. Either ascending by a major third or by descending by a minor sixth, one arrives at the same pitch class, the same note representing pitches in different octaves. Intervals paired like the pair of major-third and minor-sixth intervals are termed \\"inverse intervals\\" in the theory of music. Consequently, chord charts for minor-sixths tunings may be used for left-handed major-thirds tunings; conversely, chord charts for major- thirds tunings may be used for left-handed minor-sixths tunings. Fingering of seventh chords In standard tuning, the closed-voicing root-bass C7 chord on frets 3‚Äì8 is difficult to play, and so an open voicing is conventional. Major-thirds tuning facilitates playing chords with closed voicings. In contrast, standard tuning would require more hand-stretching to play closed- voice seventh chords, and so standard tuning uses open voicings for many four- note chords, for example of dominant seventh chords. By definition, a dominant seventh is a four-note chord combining a major chord and a minor seventh. For example, the C7 seventh chord combines the C-major chord {C, E, G} with B. In standard tuning, extending the root-bass C-major chord (C,E,G) to a C7 chord (C, E, G, B) would span six frets (3‚Äì8); such seventh chords \\"contain some pretty serious stretches in the left hand\\". An illustration shows this C7 voicing (C, E, G, B), which would be extremely difficult to play in standard tuning, besides the openly voiced C7-chord that is conventional in standard tuning: This open-position C7 chord is termed a second-inversion C7 drop 2 chord (C, G, B, E), because the second-highest note (C) in the second- inversion C7 chord (G, B, C, E) is lowered by an octave.The illustration designates B by its enharmonic equivalent, A. Guitar fretboards use (twelve- tone) equal-temperament tuning, in which B and A denote the same pitch. These notes represent distinct pitches in tuning systems that are not equally tempered. History Standard tuning's mixture of one major-third and four perfect-fourths did not meet Ralph Patt's needs for improvisation, so he invented M3 tuning. Major-thirds tuning was introduced in 1964 by jazz- guitarist Ralph Patt. He was studying with Gunther Schuller, whose twelve-tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher, Arnold Schoenberg. Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane. Seeking a guitar-tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve-tones, he introduced major-thirds tuning by 1964, perhaps in 1963. To achieve the E-E open-string range of standard (Spanish) tuning, Patt started using seven-string guitars in 1963, before settling on eight-string guitars with high G (equivalently A) as their highest open-notes. Patt used major-thirds tuning during all of his work as a session musician after 1965 in New York. Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major- thirds tuning.

Objectives The objective of the Apifresh project is to provide European beekeepers with the scientific and technological aids necessary to improve the quality of European pollen and royal jelly and also to promote the regulatory means that will allow European bee products compete under fair conditions against lower quality or adulterated products. Pollen samples These core objectives will be realised by means of the following achievements: # The development of a quality standard aimed at protecting European pollen and royal jelly products against adulteration and contamination induced by environmental and bee-treatment toxic components # The development of the knowledge and technological aids necessary to enforce compliance with the proposed standard, including: #* Definition of the analytical methods necessary to determine sensory properties, bacterial load, water content, chemical composition, and presence of pesticides and heavy metals. #* Determination of bee-product authenticity and unambiguous origin identification by means of PCR techniques #* Determination of the health enhancing compounds present in bee products. #* Development of a set of best practice guidelines for beekeep #* Development of a low-cost computer vision based decision support system for the identification of pollen vegetal species, relative proportions and geographical origin. Kinds of pollen The development of best practice guidelines aimed at improving the quality of pollen and royal jelly products in all phases of the production chain: harvesting, collecting, storage, transportation and presentation at the point of sale. Need The competitiveness of the European beekeeping sector is progressively falling as a consequence of decreased bee populations and abrupt snatching of market share by imports. These facts cause reduction of beekeepers‚Äô production, implying underutilised resources, lower economies of scale, and higher production costs.Bee health in Europe: Facts and Figures, OPERA Research Center, http://www.pollinator.org/PDFs/OPERAReport.pdf In addition, products manufactured in countries with much lower quality standards and/or adulterated with substitutes are gaining market share through unfair competition. Lack of specific regulations with respect to bee products are another threat for the beekeeping market and public health safety. Currently, there are no accepted standards for certain products like pollen and royal jelly. Few countries have guidelines or standards for products other than honey.

Currently the project has collected more that 400 pollen and 20 royal jelly samples from ten European countries. These samples have been analyzed in the two laboratories participating in the project: Marchamalo (Spain) and Tubitak (Turkey) with a third reference laboratory in Germany. A set of guidelines have been produced for the beekeepers to ensure samples are collected according to a given protocol; ensuring the quality of harvesting, transportation and storage conditions. Also strict interlaboratory validation protocols have been defined; including: a validation protocol, a validation master plan and standard format for inter- laboratory reports. A complete set of analytics has been specified in the protocol; including the following: * Proteins * Lipid * Total carbohydrates * Dietary fiber * Ash * Foreign Materials * Genetically modified organism * Water Content * Flavonoids * Enzymes * Chloramphenicol (CAP) * Sulfanomides and Trimethoprim * Tetracyclines * Streptomycin * Chlorfenvinphos * Nitrofurans Metabolites * Aflatoxins * Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons * Pesticides * Heavy metals (Cadmium Mercury, Lead, Tin) * Macrolides : Tylosin A, Tylosin B, Erythromycin A, Erythromycin A metabolite, * Clindamycin, Josamycin, Leucomycin, Lincomycin, Spiramycin, Tilmicosin * Aerobic Bacteria * E. coli * Coliform * Mold * Yeast These analyses have been performed already in the set of available samples and the results from the 2011 sample collection campaign area available. Validation for the chemical analysis has been performed following Eurochem /Citac Guide GC 4 (QUAM:2000.1, second edition) while validation studies for microbiological analysis has been done based on ISO 19036. In addition the first computer vision software module has been completed and is already available. The module is able to separate pollen samples by its color, categorize them according to an internal dictionary of pollen species and count the relative proportions of the different pollen types in the sample. All this is done automatically in a few seconds, using a low cost video camera and PC computer. No expertise in computer vision or Melissopalynology is required. Before, this same process required at least two hours work by a skilled operator separating pollen grains by hand. As reported in scientific publications, the software achieves 94% accuracy in the identification of the pollen proportions; much higher than what is reasonably possible with a human operator.

Llimona contributed to the founding of the Artistic Circle of Sant Lluc, the intention of which was to preserve art from the excesses of contemporary artists. Female nudes were prohibited in the Circle's initial statutes, but later the prohibition was lifted; Llimona did not depict the female nude until then. It was then that he sculpted Desolation, a work he exhibited for the first time in 1907 and which demonstrates the artist's ability to communicate feelings that reflect a deep humanity through a naked female figure. Desolation, a paradigm of Modernisme sculpture, magisterially represents the formal traits of Symbolism as adopted by the more outstanding Catalan sculptors of the day. These traits include undulating lines and softened contours, features that derive from The Danaide by Auguste Rodin. Even so, a notable difference exists between the resigned, melancholic and chaste attitude of Desolation and the vitality, strength and sensuality of the French sculptor's work. With Desolation, Llimona brought his process of sculptural renewal to a peak while also summing up the Symbolist aesthetic of one of Catalan art's most brilliant periods.MNAC's artwork at their Online CollectionModernismoDanaid at the Rodin Museum  Description  A Virtue by Llimona hold at the Art Museum of Cerdanyola, in Catalonia. Desolation is a nude version of a figure produced for a burial vault in the Montjuic CemeteryMNAC Audio Guide for Desolation by Josep Llimona The sculpture¬¥s measurements are 67 cm x 76 cm x 67 cm (26.4 in x 29.9 in x 31.5 in).Desconsol by M.Carme Aranda The sculpture belongs to a group of works created specifically for new pantheons built during the early 1900s. Artists created sculptures of angels or Virtues that included consoling women overcome by the weight of their grief and allegorical figures reflecting sublime thoughts and feelings relating to death such as despair, grief, or resignation. In short, they modeled desolate, meditative, and mysterious women with no regard to their beauty. The characteristics these works had to have in order to illustrate the general spiritual state led artists to adopt languid, bowed female figures with long hair dressed in tunics that sprang straight from the skin. Although this style wasn't adopted in all the works, female figures predominate and their formal characteristics passed into the artistic language used by modernist sculptors in the works they produced for collectors, without those elements more suited to funerary images associated with death.Do√±ate, Merc√®. Modernisme in the MNAC Collections. Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and Lunwerg, Spain 2012. Desolation is full of feeling, an aspect in the Symbolist vein. The most notable characteristic of the work is the ease with which it transmits inner emotions. The Hermeticism and mysterious nature the sculpture evokes have to do with its posture. The hidden gaze, the closed composition of the body, and its curved contours seem to enclose the figure within its own silence.History of beauty-Desconsol (in Spanish)Symbolism- Art History  History  Replica in front of the Parliament of Catalonia () The sculpture can be found at The National Art Museum of Catalonia (MNAC).Llimona, Merc√® Escales. Josep Llimona i Joan Llimona: Vida y Obra. Ediciones de Nuevo Arte Thor, Barcelona. (1977) The work earned a gold medal in the V Exposition of Fine Arts of Barcelona in the year 1907. That same year, a photograph of the work was published in the catalog of the International Exhibit of Art in Barcelona. In 1909, Desolation was purchased by Barcelona's Major Dom√®nec Sanllehy who donated or gifted the statue to The Museum of Modern Art of Barcelona. The statue was later moved to the Modern Art gallery of The National Museum of Contemporary Art of Catalonia.Llimona, Merc√® Escales. Josep Llimona i Joan Llimona: Vida y Obra. Ediciones de Nuevo Arte Thor, Barcelona. (1977)  Replica  In addition to the original, Josep Llimona produced replicas utilizing diverse materials.MNAC Website, accessed 05 Jun 2012 The bronze replica is somewhat bigger in size than the original. It was presented at an art exhibition that commemorated the work of Josep Llimona at the Par√©s Salon in 1934. The stone replica is a variation of the original, in which the female figure is clothed. The sculpture is the same size as the original and it is part of a funerary monument dedicated to Mercedes Casas de Vilanova. The stone variant of Desolation can be found at the Southeast Cemetery in Barcelona. In 1917 Josep Llimona produced a second marble replica, much bigger in size than the original, it measures 78.8 cm x 68.8 cm (31.0 in x 27.1 in.) The sculpture was damaged over time and was replaced by a plaster replica produced in 1984. The sculpture is the centerpiece of a pond situated in front of Parliament of Catalonia at the Ciutadella park.Parc de la Ciutadella  Analysis  Desolation represents a mysterious, delicate woman hiding her face in an attitude of despair and is one of the paradigmatic works of the Catalan Modernist movement. One of the principal points of reference for the Catalan modernist artists was the French sculptor Auguste Rodin. The artwork reflects the influence of Rodin's work Danaid but with a more melancholy, chaste approach.MNAC Audio Guide for Desolation by Josep Llimona The similarities between Llimona's Desconsol and Rodin‚Äôs Danaid lie primarily in the modeling technique used by the artist, the composition of the figure, and the thoughtful use of light and shadow. Llimona's masterful work arises from a block of stone, but the softness and roundness of its forms contrasts strongly with the roughness of the material. The female figure evokes contained melancholy that can be perceived subtly; her pose hides much of the inner world of the character. Her face, covered by a thick mass of hair, is unknown. Only the gesture of the hands, slightly touching, give life to the sculpture.Barcelona Tourism  References  Further reading  * Sculpture Guide Barcelona (English, Catalan and Spanish Edition) by Eduardo Tolosa and D.

It is located in the historic Glendower Street and Chippenhamgate Street neighbourhood, within the medieval town walls. The building served as a public house during most of its history, but for the last several decades has been the headquarters of the Monmouth Rugby Football Club. History The Druid's Head Inn on Glendower Street in Monmouth is a grade II listed building. It is located on the south side of Glendower Street, within the medieval town walls that were built around 1300. The building is adjacent to the Monmouth Police Station, and both have had the 19 Glendower Street address at times (see below). The street on which the Druid's Head Inn is situated was referred to as Grinder Street or Grinders Street in the medieval and post-medieval periods, as late as the mid nineteenth century. The building is located at the corner of Glendower Street (where it veers to the north) and Chippenhamgate Street and, at times, the address has been recorded as Chippenhamgate Street (see below). Pigot's Directory of Monmouthshire for 1844 indicated that the proprietor of the Druid's Head on Grinder Street was William Beavan. The London Gazette of 16 October 1877 reported that David Evans, tailor and licensed victualler of the Druid's Head Inn, Glendower Street, Monmouth, had declared bankruptcy. In Kelly's Directory of Monmouthshire for Monmouth in 1901, John Pembridge is listed as the proprietor of the Druid's Head Inn at Chippenhamgate Street. By 1969, Monmouth Rugby Football Club purchased the public house as its headquarters. The Druid's Head Inn was grade II listed on 15 August 1974. The listing text indicated that there was a nameplate on the house which claimed a Chippenhamgate Street address, but asserted that it was in error. The pub has a two-storey, two-bay elevation with a roughcast exterior. During the mid-1980s, the club added an extension which included a lounge and dressing rooms. A two-storey extension was constructed in 1998, to accommodate a larger bar on the ground floor and a function room and kitchen on the first floor. The second renovation cost more than ¬£85,000 and was realised through the fundraisers held by the club's volunteers. The Druid's Head Inn remains the headquarters of the Monmouth Rugby Football Club.

Subsequent owners of Beaulieu have included John Jacob Astor III, Cornelius Vanderbilt III, and his wife Grace Vanderbilt, n√©e Grace Graham Wilson. History One of Newport's oldest mansions, Beaulieu was originally built in 1859 by the Peruvian merchant, Federico Barreda, who made his money in the 1850s guano trade. Beaulieu was designed for Barreda by New York architect Calvert Vaux, who also designed the bridges in New York's Central Park. In July 1859, Barreda paid $24,000 for about nine acres on the Bellevue Avenue hill overlooking Narrangansett Bay. He then hired Vaux for a five percent fee on a construction budget of $100,000. Eventually he went over his budget, and spent at least $26,000 more on furnishings and interior decoration. This seasonal \\"cottage\\" had sixteen bedrooms, a library, billiard room, a wide surrounding veranda and ample quarters for housekeepers, nannies and cooking staff. It was once described as \\"the most pretentious and elaborate villa in Newport,\\" and Barreda's wife later claimed that she supervised up to eighteen servants there. Shortly after the mansion was completed, Barreda was named Peru's minister in Washington. He hired New York City's Delmonico's restaurant to cater one of the first social events held in Beaulieu. The Astors and Vanderbilts After the Barredas suffered a reversal of financial fortune, John Jacob Astor III, who was a friend of the Barredas, purchased the mansion and gave it the name Beaulieu, which means \\"Beautiful place\\". The mansion neighbored Beechwood, the Newport estate of Astor's brother, William Backhouse Astor Jr. and his wife Caroline, known as \\"The Mrs. Astor\\", who ruled society in both New York City and Newport. Caroline considered Astor's daughter-in- law, Mary Dahlgren (n√©e Paul) Astor, the wife of Astor's only son William Waldorf Astor (who inherited Beaulieu after the death of John Jacob Astors III's wife in 1887), her only serious social rival. In 1892, the new-moneyed Vanderbilts, who made much of their wealth in shipping and railroads, spent $11 million to construct Marble House between Beaulieu and Beechwood, at which point Caroline was forced to compete with the formidable Alva Vanderbilt for social prominence. Caroline Astor made social life so unbearable for Mary and William Waldorf Astor, that William left the country and moved to England in 1901, where he later became the 1st Viscount Astor. After William Waldorf Astor moved abroad, he agreed to rent his home to Cornelius Vanderbilt III \\"Neily\\", a great-grandson of the \\"Commodore\\" Cornelius Vanderbilt. The Vanderbilt family eventually bought the house outright from the Astors in 1911. Once occupied by Neily and his wife, Grace Vanderbilt, the home was again the scene of many social gatherings and popular society. Present day After the death of Cornelius Vanderbilt III in 1942 and his wife in 1953, the house was vacant for several years until it was eventually purchased in 1961 for $100,000 by the U.S. Ambassador to Austria and Luxembourg Wiley T. Buchanan Jr., who immediately built a vast porch on the home. The first formal party after the new owners took possession was to host and honor the future King Juan Carlos and Queen Sof√≠a of Spain. Currently, the house is in private hands and is not available for public viewing. The Gilded Age edifice is owned by the family of the late widow of former Ambassador Wiley T. Buchanan Jr., Ruth Buchanan Wheeler, an heiress to the Dow Chemical fortune and mother of Dede Wilsey. References ;Notes ;Sources External links * 2016 Photographs of Beaulieu in Town & Country.

The only entrant to start, it had to be withdrawn after a landing accident two-thirds of the way through the race. Design and development The Circuit of Britain biplane was a four-bay tractor biplane with a square- section fuselage with the forward part covered with aluminium back to the aft cockpit and the remainder covered with fabric. The forward sections of the longerons were made of ash and the rear sections of spruce. Lateral control was effected by ailerons on both the upper and lower wings, which were staggered and had spruce spars spindled to an I section and hollow interplane struts.\\"The Sopwith Tractor Water-Plane\\" Flight 16 August 1913 The tail surfaces consisted of unbalanced elevators mounted on the large semi-circular tailplane and an aerodynamically balanced rudder, with no fixed vertical surface. The single step main floats had a framework of ash and spruce covered with two layers of cedar and were divided into three watertight compartments. It was powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) Green E.6, the radiators of which were placed either side of the fuselage. Operational history The competition was to start at Southampton on Saturday 16 August, the rules permitting the attempt to take place during any 72-hour period before the end of the month. Of the four entrants to the race, the Sopwith, piloted by Harry Hawker with Harry Kauper as passenger, was the only aircraft to start. Samuel Cody had been killed while testing the aircraft he had built for the competition, the aircraft entered by James Radley and Gordon England had been damaged during trials and Francis McClean's Short biplane was delayed by engine problems which kept it from competing.Round Britain Waterplane Flight Flight, 30 August 1913. Hawker and Kauper started shortly before noon and reached Great Yarmouth on the East Anglian coast at 4.38. where Hawker collapsed shortly after landing. This was ascribed to sunstroke but may have been due to Carbon monoxide poisoning.Blackmore 1993 p. 80. (The exhaust pipe of the aircraft was subsequently lengthened, but this may have been to reduce noise). Under the competition rules there was no flying on the Sunday, so an attempt was made to resume the flight on the Monday, with Sydney Pickles taking over as pilot, but this was impossible due to deteriorating weather conditions.Round Britain Waterplane Flight Flight, 23 August 1913. A second start was allowed by the race authorities, and the aircraft was returned to Southampton by rail. The second attempt started on Monday 25 August when Hawker and Kauper took off at 5.30 am. Flying via Ramsgate, Yarmouth and Scarborough, Seaham - where an unscheduled hour stop was made to effect repairs and replace lost radiator water - and ending the day at Beadnell, about short of the control point at Berwick-on-Tweed, due to one of the radiator hoses having been burnt through. The next day they left Beadnell at 8.05, stopping at Montrose, Aberdeen and Cromarty and reaching Oban on the west coast of Scotland at six in the evening, and took off on the third day at 5.42 am; after a stop at Kiells due to engine problems Larne was reached at 9.30. At 11 they took off for Dublin, but a few miles short of their destination Hawker decided to land in order to make adjustments to the engine valves. Unfortunately his foot slipped from the rudder bar and the aircraft sideslipped into the water, breaking Kauper's arm and damaging the aircraft too seriously for the flight to be continued. Although they had only covered two-thirds of the course, Hawker was awarded a prize of ¬£1,000 and was also awarded the Royal Aeronautical Society's silver medal; Kauper was awarded a bronze medal.Daily Mail ¬£5,000 Prize Flight, 6 September 1913 SpecificationsOther 1913 Circuit of Britain aircraft *Cody floatplane *Radley-England waterplanes References=NotesBibliography *Blackmore, L.K.

The lament The Battle of Aughrim (commemorating the Battle of Aughrim which occurred in his home village in July 1691, was his signature tune. He taught it to his pupil, John Coughlan, and his nephew, William Madden of Ballinasloe. He emigrated to New York City in 1845 with the Coughlan family and his nephew, William, where he died in 1855. According to O'Neill > \\"He was well along in years when he came to America, about 1845 and as he > had no family, he lived for years with Mr. James Quinn in New York City. > Money was showered on him as he played in the streets, so keen was the > appreciation of his wonderful music, which we can well believe was > voluminous as well as melodious.

Originally designed for the dining room of Casa Batll√≥ on Barcelona's Passeig de Gr√†cia, the chair is currently exhibited in the Modern Art collection of the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya and at Casa Museu Gaud√≠ (Gaud√≠ House Museum) in Barcelona. Replicas are displayed at the Gaud√≠-designed Casa Batll√≥ and Casa Mil√† (La Pedrera).  Description  Despite being described as a bench, the confidant is in fact composed of several pieces and does not resemble the classic linear bench with a single solid seat. Instead, two individual seats are divided by a shared central armrest, and each seat is slightly angled away from the armrest. Because of the angled seats, the confidant has three legs in the front, with the center front leg shared by both seats, but only two legs in the back. Constructed in ash wood in the Casas i Bard√©s workshops, the curved, organic shapes of the confidant's seats and backrests are meant to mimic the shape of the seated person's body, and the lack of ornamentation highlights the natural grain and texture of the wood.  Antoni Gaud√≠  Antoni Gaud√≠ (25 June 1852 ‚Äì 10 June 1926) was a Spanish Catalan architect and figurehead of Catalan Modernism. Gaud√≠'s works reflect his highly individual and distinctive style and are largely concentrated in the Catalan capital of Barcelona, notably his magnum opus, the Sagrada Fam√≠lia. Much of Gaud√≠'s work was marked by his four life passions: architecture, nature, religion and love for Catalonia. Gaud√≠ studied every detail of his creations, integrating into his architecture a series of crafts in which he was skilled: ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencad√≠s, made of waste ceramic pieces. After a few years under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaud√≠ became part of the Catalan Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by nature. Gaud√≠ rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he was conceiving them. Gaud√≠‚Äôs work enjoys widespread international appeal and many studies are devoted to understanding his architecture. Today, his work finds admirers among architects and the general public alike. His masterpiece, the still-uncompleted Sagrada Fam√≠lia, is one of the most visited monuments in Spain.Torres, I. √Ålvarez. \\"La Sagrada Familia de Barcelona ultima los preparativos para su apertura al culto\\" (in Catalan). Lavoz Digital. Archived from the original on 16 October 2011. Retrieved 3 August 2008. Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO.

Retrieved 21 April 2011.(Puig i T√†rrech 2010, p. 66)  Gaud√≠'s furniture design  Though Gaud√≠ is known primarily as an architect, he often applied his design skills to the furniture and interior decorations of the homes and buildings he renovated or constructed, such as \\"cupboards, tables, seats of every kind, priedieus, screens, mirrors, windows, doors, door knobs and handles, grilled, and spyholes for identifying a visitor before opening the door.\\"Robinson, W. H., Falg√†s, J., & Lord, C. B. (2006). Barcelona and Modernity: Picasso, Gaud√≠, Mir√≥, Dal√≠. Yale University Press. He was known for his high attention to detail in his architectural works, continually checking and modifying his plans even as the buildings were being constructed, and he gave this same level of attention to his furniture design, insisting that furniture must be specific to its space, its function, and the needs of the client. As with his building designs, his furniture designs underwent constant studying, testing, and adjustment before being installed. Most importantly, Gaud√≠ aimed for what he called the \\"idea,\\" the harmony between the furniture's elements and of its \\"functionality, form, symbolism, structure, and especially construction.\\" He said that \\"for an object to be attractive its first quality must be that it fulfills the purpose for which it is intended,\\" a sentiment that suggests the ideals of modern industrial design. Gaud√≠‚Äôs early furniture designs mimicked existing popular or historic styles, but as he sought to make a more personal statement, he soon found inspiration in nature and its organic, curved lines and shapes, resulting in highly ergonomic designs. As with his architecture, Gaud√≠ made three-dimensional clay and plaster models of his furniture, allowing him to create organic shapes with malleable material. For Palau G√ºell (1884-1887), Gaud√≠'s furniture design style was still rather traditional, though he did create some curved, asymmetrical pieces, and he also sought to mix styles of furniture even within the same room, desiring to create a level of \\"disorder.\\" By the time he was designing furniture for Casa Calvet (1898-1899), Gaud√≠ was creating \\"fluid and abstract\\" designs that would bring out the grain, texture, and color of the wood but also produce \\"clarity of structure and cleanliness of construction.\\" Constructed of oak in the Casas i Bard√©s workshops, the pieces‚Äî including chairs, benches, a table, a desk, a stool, and a mirror with a gilded frame‚Äî display Gaud√≠'s move towards fluid, organic designs while still retaining somewhat traditional elements. However, the armchair he designed for the office, though containing ornamental flourishes and featuring a distinctive heart-shaped seat back and a round seat, breaks away from tradition, lacking a single straight line. An example of \\"free-form\\" furniture, the chair was designed to \\"cradle the human body,\\" and its lines are reminiscent of Art Nouveau furniture without being strictly classified as Art Nouveau.Banham, J. (Ed.). (1997). Antoni Gaudi. In Encyclopedia of Interior Design (p. 476). Routledge. Soon, Gaud√≠ would strip away remaining elements of \\"superfluous ornamentation\\" in favor of simple \\"comfort and utility.\\" From this point on, his furniture designs feature \\"solid forms and simple profiles,\\" sometimes suggesting the simple lines of medieval furniture design while still containing his trademark \\"sinuous and zigzagging lines.\\"  Casa Batll√≥ and the confidant  The furniture that Gaud√≠ designed for his renovation of Casa Batll√≥ (1904-1906) is much more simplified than any of his designs for previous projects, eliminating all ornamentation and upholstery while emphasizing practicality and functionality.Martinelli, C. (1975). Gaud√≠. University of Michigan, MI: Editorial Blume. p. 140. Whereas his furniture for Casa Calvet still retained recognizable callbacks to traditional design, the Casa Batll√≥ furniture broke away entirely from tradition, with shapes that gave the appearance of being molded with soft material and tables and benches that were broken up into multiple sections instead of having solid surfaces. Benches and chairs such as the confidant not only had seats that were rounded to fit the human form, but also had sizes and shapes that allowed them to fit perfectly against the wall where they were meant to be placed. Even though Mrs. Batll√≥ begged Gaud√≠ to add traditional upholstery and other textile elements to the furniture for her house, he refused and even went further, eliminating marquetery and carved elements as well, techniques that were in vogue with other designers of the time. Gaud√≠'s radical furniture designs for the Casa Batll√≥ received acclaim from surrealist artists and especially from Salvador Dal√≠.  After Casa Batll√≥  Gaud√≠'s furniture design continued to evolve after Casa Batll√≥ as he designed buildings and spaces that presented new challenges in integrating furnishings with their surroundings. For Casa Mil√° (1906-1912), he wanted the walls, ceilings, balconies, door handles, and furniture not only to share the same curved forms but also to reflect and complement the \\"sandstone and cement\\" colors of the building's tiles and exterior.Cline, E. (2011). The Lasting Relationship between Antonio Gaud√≠ and Barcelona, Spain. Retrieved 19 January 2016. One of the last furniture pieces that Gaud√≠ designed before devoting the remainder of his life to the design and construction of Sagrada Fam√≠lia, the bench for the unfinished Col√≤nia G√ºell, demonstrated that he was still unafraid to add new elements to his design to adapt to the space, in this case the crypt in the church. Needing to add \\"solidity and stability\\" that wood alone could not provide, Gaud√≠ used iron elements to support the structure of the bench.  Art Nouveau  Art Nouveau is an international philosophyDuncan (1994), 7. and style of art, architecture and applied art‚Äîespecially the decorative arts‚Äîthat were most popular during 1890‚Äì1910.Sterner (1982), 6. The name \\"Art Nouveau\\" is French for \\"new art\\". A reaction to academic art of the 19th century, it was inspired by natural forms and structures, not only in flowers and plants but also in curved lines. Architects tried to harmonize with the natural environment. It is also considered a philosophy of design of furniture, which was designed according to the whole building and made part of ordinary life.Art Nouveau ‚Äì Art Nouveau Art In Spain, the style was based mainly in Barcelona and was an essential element of the Catalan Modernisme, often understood as an equivalent to a number of fin-de-si√®cle art movements, such as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Secessionism, and Liberty style. Architect Antoni Gaud√≠, whose decorative architectural style is so personal that he is sometimes considered as practising an artistic style different from Art Nouveau, nonetheless uses Art Nouveau's floral and organic forms.James Grady, \\"Special Bibliographical Supplement: A Bibliography of the Art Nouveau\\", The Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, vol. 14 (May, 1955), pp. 18‚Äì27. His designs from about 1903, the Casa Batll√≥ (1904‚Äì1906) and Casa Mil√† (1906‚Äì1908), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau.Duncan (1994): 52. However, famous structures such as the Sagrada Familia characteristically contrast the modernising Art Nouveau tendencies with revivalist Neo-Gothic.

Description  Casas painted Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem in 1897 specifically for the interior of Els Quatre Gats, a bar that was at the center of the Modernisme art movement in Barcelona.McCully (1978), p. 64. It depicts Casas and Pere Romeu, one of the promoters of Els Quatre Gats, on a tandem bicycle against the Barcelona skyline. Casas is seen in profile with his pipe, while Romeu looks directly at the viewer.Robinson et al, p. 81. Although painted on canvas, the composition has the graphic quality of a huge poster with its bold drawing and simplified forms, reflecting the fact that the artist was a skilled poster designer and illustrator.Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem and In an Automobile on the National Art Museum of Catalonia's YouTube channel The original inscription on the right side of the painting, which was later cut off, read \\"to ride a bicycle, you can't go with your back straight.\\" The message described the attitude of the bar founders (two of whom are depicted here), that in order to make progress, you must break with tradition, as was done at Els Quatre Gats. In 1901, this painting was replaced with another large composition by Casas, entitled Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu in an Automobile, in which the tandem bicycle has given way to a car, symbolizing the new century. When reproductions of the two paintings appeared in the magazine Pel & Ploma, they were referred to as The End of the 19th Century and The Beginning of the 20th Century, respectively.Robinson et al., p. 82.  Ramon Casas  Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu in an Automobile, 1901 Ramon Casas i Carb√≥ was a Catalan artist. Living through a turbulent time in the history of his native Barcelona, he was known as a portraitist, sketching and painting the intellectual, economic, and political elite of Barcelona, Paris, and beyond; he was also known for his paintings of crowd scenes ranging from the audience at a bullfight to the assembly for an execution to rioters in the Barcelona streets. His posters and postcards helped define the Modernisme art movement.  Els Quatre Gats  The emerging Modernisme art movement gained a center with the opening of Els Quatre Gats, a bar modeled on the Parisian caf√© Le Chat Noir, whose founder, Rodolphe Salis, had recently died. ‚ÄúFour Cats‚Äù is a colloquial Catalan expression for ‚Äúonly a few people‚Äù and the name of Els Quatre Gats is derived from this saying.McCully (1978), p. 16. Casas largely financed the bar on the ground floor of Casa Mart√≠, a building by Architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch on Montsi√≥ Street near the center of Barcelona; it opened on June 12, 1897 and closed in 1903 (and was later reconstructed in 1978). His partners in the enterprise were Pere Romeu, as well as Santiago Rusi√±ol and Miquel Utrillo. The bar organized tertulias and revolving art exhibits, including the first -man shows by Pablo Picasso; Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem was the most prominent piece in its permanent collection.Robinson et al., p. 81.  Modernisme  Modernisme (Catalan for \\"art nouveau\\") was a cultural movement associated with the search for Catalan national identity. It is often understood as an equivalent to a number of fin-de-si√®cle art movements, such as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Secessionism, and Liberty style, and was active from roughly 1888 (the First International Exhibition of Barcelona) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall, the most important Modernista poet). The Modernisme movement was centered on the city of Barcelona, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially the work of Antoni Gaud√≠, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theater, and painting.

The complexity of the open doors at the far end of the room contribute a mysterious quality to the painting, allowing the viewer to question where this young woman really is. The painting's original title was replaced for some time with \\"Summer Study.\\" But Miguel Utrillo changed the title of the painting back to \\"Over My Dead Body\\" after a solo exhibition at the Sala Pares in May 1900. The title of the work is listed in Pel & Ploma as \\"Summer Study.\\"  About the Artist  Ramon Casas i Carb√≥ (4 January 1866 - 29 February 1932) was a Catalan Spanish artist. Living through a turbulent time in the history of his native Barcelona, he was known as a portraitist, sketching and painting the intellectual, economic, and political elite of Barcelona, Paris, Madrid, and beyond; he was also known for his paintings of crowd scenes ranging from the audience at a bullfight to the assembly for an execution to rioters in the Barcelona streets. Also a graphic designer, his posters and postcards helped to define the Catalan art movement known as modernisme. In the 1890s, Casas was one of many artists exercising their artistic talents around the Moulin de la Galette in Paris. Casas and his friend, and fellow artist, Santiago Rusinol, constructed several exhibitions back in their native city of Barcelona, that exhibited their first-hand experiences of the French culture and art. Over time, these exhibitions quickly evolved into a center of progressive painting scenes within the Modernist movement. Casas became a leading figure in the revival of Catalan culture, and was one of the first Spanish artists to introduce French Modernisme to Spain in the late nineteenth-century.  Modernisme  Modernisme (Catalan for \\"modernism\\") was a cultural movement associated with the search for Catalan national identity. It is often understood as an equivalent to a number of fin-de-si√®cle art movements, such as Art Nouveau, Jugendstil, Secessionism, and Liberty style, and was active from roughly 1888 (the First International Exhibition of Barcelona) to 1911 (the death of Joan Maragall, the most important Modernista poet). The Modernisme movement was centred on the city of Barcelona, and is best known for its architectural expressions, especially the work of Antoni Gaud√≠, but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting‚Äînotable painters include Santiago Rusi√±ol and Ramon Casas.Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, , p. 253. Modernistes largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a bohemian or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (Modernista architects and designers, playwrights inspired by Henrik Ibsen, some of Maragall's poetry, etc.)  Further reading  In 1931, Josep M. Jorda wrote the publication Ramon Casas, Pintor, based on personal friendship with the artist. J.F. Radols wrote a two volume critical assessment of the artists life: Ramon Casas, pintor and Ramon Casas, Dibuiante. The most recent text on Casas is a retrospective catalog entitled, Ramon Casas, and is sponsored by Barcelona's City Hall. This includes several short analytical essays and a partial exhibition history for Casas.

Old Heidelberg () is a German romantic play by Wilhelm Meyer-F√∂rster first performed in 1901. While studying at the Heidelberg University, Prince Karl from Saxony falls in love with K√§thie, an innkeeper's daughter, but has to give her up when his father dies, and he is called to return to his homeland and rule as King. The play was based on Meyer-F√∂rster's own 1898 novel Karl Heinrich. The play's title alludes to a poem by Joseph Victor von Scheffel. The work was a major international success and became one of the most performed plays in Germany during the first half of the 20th century. Adaptations=Film Owing to the story's popularity it has been turned into films on numerous occasions, including the American silent film Old Heidelberg (1915), the German silent film Old Heidelberg (1923), Ernst Lubitsch's The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg (1926), and Ernst Marischka's Old Heidelberg (1959). Operetta In 1924 the play provided the basis for the 1924 operetta The Student Prince composed by Sigmund Romberg to a libretto by Dorothy Donnelly. The operetta was the basis for the 1954 film The Student Prince. Opera In 1908, the play was the basis for a libretto by Alberto Colantuoni, titled Eidelberga Mia, with music by Ubaldo Pacchierotti; it was later translated into German by Ottoman Piltz in 1909 under the original German title.

Eupterodactyloids lived on all continents except Antarctica. Classification Eupterodactyloidea was named by S. Christopher Bennett in 1994 as an infraorder of the suborder Pterodactyloidea. Bennett defined it as an apomorphy-based clade. However, in 2010, Brian Andres re-defined the group as a stem-based taxon in his dissertation, A preview that shows the cladogram without clade names and then formalized the definition in 2014 as all pterosaurs more closely related to Pteranodon longiceps than to Pterodactylus antiquus. The slightly more exclusive group Ornithocheiroidea was re-defined in 2003 by Alexander Kellner. He defined it as the least inclusive clade containing Anhanguera blittersdorffi, Pteranodon longiceps, Dsungaripterus weii, and Quetzalcoatlus northropi. Ornithocheiroidea has often been used for a much more exclusive group including only the branch of traditional ornithocheirid pterosaurs, though this use has since fallen out of favor by many researchers after years of competing definitions for the various pterodactyloid clades. The compromise definitions by Andres and others have since become more widely adopted.

The Stories of St. Stephen and St. John the Baptist is a fresco cycle by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi and his assistants, executed between 1452 and 1465. It is located in the Great Chapel (Cappella Maggiore) of the Cathedral of Prato, Italy. History Geminiano Inghirami, the preposto of the Cathedral of Prato, then capitular church, was at the time an influential man in culture and politics, with important friendships in Rome and Florence. Himself a humanist, he often commissioned artworks to Renaissance artists, and sometimes called them to Prato, such as with Donatello and Michelozzo for the cathedral's external pulpit. The city decided to decorate the Great Chapel in the church in 1440, allocating a budget of 1200 gold florins for the work. Inghirami asked archbishop Antonino Pierozzi to call Fra Angelico. However, the aging friar, perhaps due to the extent of the work or because he was already committed to other works, declined the offer. Next was Fra Filippo Lippi, who accepted and established himself in Prato in 1452. Collaborators he brought with him included Fra Diamante, who had been his companion in novitiate. The Cappella Maggiore in the Prato Cathedral. Left: Life and martyrdom of St. Stephen. Right: Life and beheading of St. John the Baptist. The completion of the work took fourteen years, with lates, pauses and scandals, such as that involving the painter (also a professed Carmelite friar and ordained priest) and a nun from the monastery of Santa Margherita, where Lippi had been chaplain from 1456 to the issue of a tamburazione (secret accusation) in May 1461. Her name was Lucrezia Buti: after acting as his model for some paintings, she gave birth to two children, Filippino Lippi in 1457 and Alexandra in 1465. The two lived together in a house near the city's Duomo. Once the scandal broke out, Lippi and Buti fled from the city. According to his biographer Giorgio Vasari, Pope Eugene IV released, only after the intercession of Cosimo de' Medici, Lippi from his vows and \\"had offered in his lifetime to give him a dispensation, that he might make Lucrezia (...) his legitimate wife, but [that] Fra Filippo desiring to retain the power of living after his own fashion, and of indulging his love of pleasure as might seem good to him, did not care to accept that offer.\\" It was however Pope Pius II that granted them the dispensation allowing them to marry. The frescoes were finished in 1465 under the supervision of the new preposto Carlo di Cosimo de' Medici. The following year Lippi moved to Spoleto, with his son Filippino and his apprentice Sandro Botticelli, where he died four years later. In October 1993 the paintings were vandalized with a black pen by Pietro Cannata who had already performed vandalistic acts on other works of art among which the David of Michelangelo in 1991. They were restored starting from 2001, the chapel being reopened to the public in 2007. The Funeral of St. Stephen. Description The cycle occupies the two lateral walls and the end wall of the Cappella Maggiore, covering a surface of in total. At the left (looking from the nave towards the high altar) are the Stories of St. Stephen, the titular saint of the church and patron saint of Prato; at the right are the Stories of St. John the Baptist, the protector of nearby Florence. The end wall, at the side of the stained glass window (also designed by Lippi) are two saints in painted niches and, below, bent around the corners, are the martyrdoms of St. Stephen (left) and St. John the Baptist (right). At the top, in the pendentives of the cross- vaults, are the four Evangelists. The two saints' stories are to be read from the top to the bottom, and mirror each other on the opposite walls. The two lunette depict scenes of the birth of the two saints, while in the central scenes is their abandon of the secular life to take the vows; finally, the lower scenes show their martyrdom (central wall) and their death or funeral (side walls). The Stories of St. Stephen include: *Kidnapping of Newborn St. Stephen. Set in a house seen through the sectioned front wall, the scene shows a winged demon exchanging the future saint, who had been born into a well- endowed family, with a small devil having the same appearance. At the right is the meeting between the young St. Stephen and Bishop Julian, who, according to the legend, took care of him during his adolescence. *St. Stephen Leaving. It shows the saint leaving Julian for his mission in Cilicia. *Stoning of St. Stephen (central wall) *Funeral of St. Stephen. Set in a Palaeo-Christian basilica, it shows numerous characters taking part in St. Stephen's funeral. They include a portrait of people from Lippi's time, such as a red-dressed Pope Pius II, Carlo di Cosimo de' Medici behind him, and, next to them, the artist's self-portrait. The Stories of St. John the Baptist include: *Birth of St. John the Baptist *St. John the Baptist Leaving his family, Prayer and Predication in the Desert *Beheading of St. John the Baptist *Feast of Herod, including the dance of Salome (perhaps a portrait of Lucrezia Buti) and the presentation of the saint's head to a cold Herodias Lippi's frescoes were largely completed a secco (i.e. after the plaster used for fresco painting had dried), and therefore numerous details are now mere halos (for example, in the Feast of Herod the vases on the right and the table companions at the left).

Mission According to \\"Role of the Reconstruction Agency\\", the agency will: > 1\\\\. Plan, coordinate, and implement the national policy on reconstruction; > 2\\\\. Bear the responsibility for a unified point of contact, assistance, etc. > to local public bodies. History and function The Reconstruction Agency was established to replace the Reconstruction Headquarters in response to the Great East Japan earthquake, created on June 24, 2011. The Reconstruction Agency was headed by the Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda. Noda was named direct head of the agency in an effort to strengthen the leadership of the organization. Tatsuo Hirano, a native of Iwate Prefecture, served as the agency's first Minister of State for Disaster Management until he was replaced by Osamu Fujimura on June 4, 2012. The Reconstruction Agency is not part of the Cabinet Office, but will have authority over other government ministries. The agency will exist for ten years, the length of time estimated to fully restore the region after the disaster, and be dissolved on March 3, 2021. A wooden tablet for the new agency was made from materials from the earthquake zone. Prime Minister Noda placed the tablet at the Akasaka Agency headquarters as a reminder of the responsibility to residents of the disaster-hit regions. Tatsuo Hirano, former Minister of State for Disaster Management, at the World Economic Forum on East Asia 2012 The Reconstruction Agency established three Regional Offices for Reconstruction in Iwate, Miyagi, and Fukushima prefectures, and two smaller regional offices in Hachinohe, Aomori Prefecture and Mito, Ibaraki Prefecture. The agency also sought to work with business associations in Japan in order to establish or revive economic activity in the Tohoku region affected by the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear disaster. The agency, as well as the Japan Business Federation, the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and their affiliated corporations, formed the Reconstruction Design Council in response to the Great East Japan earthquake.

Residents and officials in regions affected by the disaster, notably Y≈´hei Sat≈ç, governor of Fukushima Prefecture, publicly noted the lack of speed in which the agency was created: Legislation in the National Diet to establish the agency was slowed by the resignation of Prime Minister Naoto Kan in September 2011. The bill to create the agency passed in December 2011, nine months after the disaster occurred, delaying the opening of the agency until February 2012. Kan acknowledged the slow pace of government response to the disaster on March 3, 2011, and pledged to speed up recovery efforts. Residents displaced by the tsunami have opposed Agency-led plans to rebuild towns on higher land away from the coast, and see it as a disconnect between the central government and the population in the T≈çhoku region. After a strict review of initial projects, the Agency approved a large number of projects in a second round of reviews in May 2012, including funds for urban and agricultural renewal.

The delegation was welcomed by Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun. Agenda The agenda included discussions about the 2011-2012 Syrian uprising and criticism by the Western world of Russia and China's approach towards sanctioning the government of Syria. Host President Hu Jintao also said that the SCO would support a security paradigm that would give its member states sovereignty over what is deemed to be its own interests in accordance with individual state's conditions. It also sought to counter \\"interventionism.\\" Rules for the admission of further member states were expected to be issued. Turkey was considered for admission as a \\"dialogue partner\\" and Afghanistan joined as an \\"observer.\\" China did not object to either states citing their status as \\"NATO-friendly countries.\\" Afghanistan is already currently involved as part of the SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group, which is working on reconstruction projects in the country. However, Vice Foreign Minister Cheng Guoping said the observers were unlikely to become full members as yet due to expectations for more \\"preparatory work,\\" though the current members would maintain an \\"open attitude\\" towards future relations: > The relevant countries should work hard towards political, legal and > technical preparations for [membership]. The relevant work is going on about > expansion of membership. The decision should be made through consensus and > consultation, and no timetable should be set. That is to say, when the > conditions are ripe, the decision should be made through consensus. The founding ethos for the SCO, counter-terrorism, was also expected to be high on the agenda. Other issues suggested for discussion were a bigger role for SCO after NATO withdraws its forces following the War in Afghanistan (which could be enhanced by Afghanistan's acceptance as an observer) and in working towards a solution to Iran's nuclear programme, for which a statement criticising further Western sanctions would be issued. Cheng also said that a road transport agreement would be signed, while discussions would continue in order to develop a financing safeguard mechanism and an SCO development bank. Non-member initiatives India sought to work with the Uzbekistan-based Regional Counter-Terrorism Structure, participate in discussions with the other trade ministers and coordinate its own work with the SCO over reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan, more so after the announced phased withdrawal of ISAF troops from that country, in what Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called the \\"economic and political revival of Afghanistan.\\" Schedule On 6 June, a group meeting between the six member states was scheduled in Beijing. The next day a larger meeting, business summit and a signing ceremony to conclude the summit was scheduled. Discussions At the start of the summit, Hu said: \\"We will continue to manage regional affairs by ourselves, guarding against shocks from turbulence outside the region. We will play a bigger role in Afghanistan's peaceful reconstruction. We'll strengthen communication, co-ordination and co-operation in dealing with major international and regional issues.\\" Conclusions Host leader Hu Jintao announced the conclusions to the summit as including: *Afghanistan and Turkey were included in the roles they were expected to have done as observer and dialogue partner, respectively. *Vows to foster and facilitate trade and investment. *Vows to enhance cooperation in the finance, transportation, energy, telecommunications and agriculture sectors in line with a furtherance of regional economic development *Pursue the establishment of a Special Account and Development Bank. *Approval of a development strategic plan. *Vows to increase capacity to deal with crises situations such as terrorism, separatism, extremism and transnational crime and make the SCO a \\"reliable guarantor of regional security.\\" *Agreement on the necessity to enhance cultural and educational exchanges and create opportunities for more people- to-people contact. *Further cooperation with observer states and dialogue partners, the United Nations and other affiliates, including international and regional organisations. There were also ten agreements that were signed, including the Declaration on Building a Region with Lasting Peace and Common Prosperity, the Strategic Plan for the Medium-Term Development of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, as well as agreeing to unify the SCO's response to regional security threats. Hu then further told the summit delegations that \\"we should enhance consultations with international and regional organizations through the platform to safeguard peace, promote development and boost world multipolarization and democratization of international relations.\\" Kyrgyzstan then took over the rotating presidency of the organisation the next day. Bilateral meetings The day prior to the commencement of the summit featured Russian President Vladimir Putin and host President Hu Jintao present for the signing of bilateral cooperation agreements in the fields of energy, industry, innovation technologies and tourism, as well an agreement to deepen China-Russia relations and strategic cooperation. Putin was scheduled to meet China's chairman of the Committee of the National People's Congress Wu Bangguo, Premier Wen Jiabao, Vice President Xi Jinping and Vice Premier Li Keqiang. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Putin decision to come to China as part of one of his foreign visits as president was indicative of burgeoning relations between the two countries. China's Wen Jiabao met Kyrgyz President Almazbek Atambayev and discussed Kyrgyzstani stability and development. Wen said that the two states would work towards developing infrastructure in railways, energy and trade relations with an increase in the exchange of persons between the two countries. Atambayev added that he appreciated China's support and that Kyrgyzstan was working to enhance cooperation with China in the spheres trade, transportation, energy, agriculture and security. Hu also met Kazakhstan's Nursultan Nazarbayev with him whom he pledged to enhance their \\"strategic partnership.\\" Nazarbayev also met Jinping. The same pledges were made by Hu with Tajikistan's Emomali Rahmon, specifically in the sectors of energy, resources, infrastructure, agriculture and security. Rahmon also said that China National Petroleum Corporation was invited to explore for both crude oil and natural gas in Tajikistan following the signing of an agreement on 5 June. He also signed an agreement with China for a US#50 million loan for a road construction project, as well as inviting Zijin Mining Group Company Limited to explore for copper. Afghan President Hamid Karzai said that Afghanistan and China would sign a preliminary agreement for the \\"creation of a strategic partnership\\" and work towards deepening relations. Putin was also scheduled to meet with his Iranian and Afghani counterparts. The latter two would also hold talks with their Chinese counterpart. Indian Foreign Minister S. M. Krishna is scheduled to meet Chinese Vice-Premier Li Keqiang to discuss border issues and the incarceration of Indian nationals in China.

The artwork originated from the southern apsidiole of the Church of Sant Quirze de Pedret and is currently exhibited in the Romanesque Art collection at the Museu Nacional d‚ÄôArt de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain.MNAC Website  History  At the end of the eleventh century, the Romanesque mural painting of northern Italy arrived in Catalonia with a spread similar to that of Lombardic Romanesque architecture. The work of Italian painters, then, accompanied the architecture and soon had important repercussions. The clearest example of this Lombardy-related painting is the Sant Quirze de Pedret ensemble, which stylistically comes close to the paintings of Sant Pere in √Äger, Santa Maria in √Äneu, and Sant Pere in El Burgal, and to those of Saint-Lizier in Couserans (France), preserved in situ. The church at Pedret, located in the Pyrenees, was thought to have been elaborately decorated (even without a written history of worshippers) since it was located on the roads connecting Berga, Bag√†, and Cerdanya, thus it may have been an important location. Scholars agree that the church's original architecture was Visigothic due to specific construction elements such as the horse-shoe arches, which divide the nave and give entrance to the apses, as well as the insulation of the apses themselves.Pijoan, J., \\"A Rediscovered School of Romanesque Frescoes\\", The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, April 1911, p. 72-73, XIX, XCVII However, an additional description of Mozarabic has been given as well to describe the architectural style.Miller, D.C., The Romanesque Mural Paintings of Pedret, Parnassus, New York, March 15, 1929, I, III, p. 20. Various theories on the age of the frescoes have been presented taking into account stylistic trends of the tenth through the twelfth centuries AD and renovations that took place on the church during those time periods as well.Post, Ch. R., A History of Spanish Painting, Cambridge, 1930, I, P. 130-136; 1941, VII (2), p. 540-544 The Museum where the frescoes currently reside dates them to be from the end of the eleventh century to the beginning of the twelfth. Due to the fresco's age, it is probable that the Southern apse from Pedret is one of the oldest of all Catalan Romanesque wall paintings. The National Art Museum of Catalonia keeps the two side apses from Sant Quirze de Pedret and the Museu Dioces√† i Comarcal in Solsona keeps the decoration of the central apse. Taken together they present an important apocalyptic series in which the subject of the Church is related to the coming of the Day of Judgement in a way that is not frequent, centering on the parable of the wise and foolish Virgins in the southern apsidiole.  Description  The apse's dimensions are 325 x 315 x 320 cm, and it contains several images although the most prominent one is a fragmentary image of the Wise and Foolish Virgins parable found in Matthew 25:1-13. Three of the five Wise Virgins' heads have been removed due to historic construction on the church building; however, all figures seem to be wearing similar embroidered dalmatics and tunics with close-fitting sleeves that are worn below the open-fitted sleeves of the dalmatics. The Virgins are crowned with bridal crowns resting on caps and are seen wearing spiral earrings. The crowns resemble those found in Rome during the sixth century. Originally, all five Wise Virgins were depicted seated at the marriage supper with burning cressets in their left hands. The Bridegroom figure (Christ) is all but gone however his hand can be seen extending over the table. On the other side of the scene are the five Foolish Virgins. The Foolish Virgins are not clothed in the intricate dalmatics as the Wise Virgins, and they do not wear crowns. Instead, they don coifs that are arranged in folds over their hair. Also unlike the Wise Virgins, the five Foolish Virgins hold their cressets inverted with oil vessels hanging from them. Beneath the virgins is a pattern described as ‚Äúmedallions of beasts.‚Äù A young figure is also pictured sitting upon a church with the head encircled by a nimbus (halo). There is a discrepancy as to whether the figure is male or female, and to the object that is held in the figure‚Äôs hand. Suggestions have been wand, lily or palm. What can be agreed upon is that this image is a personification of the church.Anthony, E.W., Romanesque Frescoes, Princeton, 1951, p. 161-163 Trace figures of the Archangel Gabriel and the Virgin Mary were once reported, but have since faded entirely although the inscription SCA (Sancta) MARIA was recorded. An image of the Theotokos holding the infant Jesus was also present but was covered with mortar during repairs. There is a fret pattern below the illustrated figures along with simulated drapery present. The apse's window is also decorated with a geometric pattern.  Composition  The composition of this painting is fresco transferred to canvas and the artwork is attributed to the Circle of the Master of Pedret.  Analysis  These frescoes are attributed to have created by Circle of the Master Pedret and are said to be examples of the early Catalan school. Stylistically their frescoes are linked to similar Italian artwork and show signs of early Byzantine iconography as well as illusionism. The parable of the Wise and Foolish Virgins found in Pedret is related to earlier religious illustrations such as Coemiterious Maius and the Rossano Gospels. In the parable, those who are wise and have kept their torches lit are received by the Bridegroom, whereas those who are foolish and who have let their torches become extinguished have been excluded from Paradise. This is in reference to Judgment Day where only those who are prepared will be able to enter the Lord's house. This particular parable seems to become extremely popular around the eleventh century. Personification of the Church appears to be influenced by Mozarabic liturgy, whereas reference to the ten virgins is found in other liturgies.  Notes  References   *Klein, P.K.

The decoration of the apse of the church of Santa Mar√≠a d‚Äô√Äneu combines themes and motifs from the Old and New Testaments. Originally painted at the Church of Santa Mar√≠a d‚Äô√Äneu (La Guingueta d‚Äô√Äneu, Lleida)Comment on Apse of Santa Mar√≠a d'√Äneu  History  The church of Santa Mar√≠a d'√Äneu is located in the upper valley of the Noguera Pallaresa, Pyrenees mountain region. The building once belonged to a Benedictine Monastery, it is divided into a nave and aisles by six pairs of piers, taking the shape of a cross. The east end concludes in three semicircular apses, the central apse was decorated with frescoes.Kuhn, Ch. L., Romanesque Mural Painting of Catalonia, Cambridge, 1930, p. 45. Santa Maria in √Äneu was the most important church in the √Äneu Valley and belonged to the cathedral chapter of Urgell. From the stylistic circle of Pedret, of Lombardic influence, the decoration of the apse reveals the existence of an elaborate iconographic and theological programme setting off the prophetic hopes of the Old Testament‚Äîthat is, hope in the coming of a Messiah who was to redeem humanity‚Äîagainst fulfillment of the prophecies‚Äîthat is, the coming of the Messiah announced by the prophets.Post, Ch.R., A History of Spanish Painting, Cambridge, 1930, I, p. 136-140. Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya dates the original work at the end of 11th century ‚Äì beginning of 12th century.Technical Aspects from MNAC Catalog However, there is speculation that the paintings were completed at the beginning of the 13th century at the time when Romanesque styles were breaking down and Gothic Art was coming of age.  Description  The iconography of the painting is suggestive of the Old Testament through the presence of the prophets in reverential attitudes. In the vault portion of the apse, the Epiphany or Adoration of the Magi is represented, with Mary, Jesus, and the three eastern kings baring gifts. Wheels of fire from Jehovah‚Äôs chariot are depicted in the lower register, conforming to Ezekiel‚Äôs vision.Esteller, E.,MNAC Romanesque Art Guide, Barcelona, 1998, p. 40-43. To the right and left are the archangels Michael and Gabriel holding banners and scrolls with the inscription PETICIVS and POSTVLATIVS. Bordering the central window of the lower zones are two six- winged seraphim, in their hands they hold live coals with tongs which they place in the mouths of two crouching figures. In the left lower zone, there are two tonsured (meaning scalp has been shaved) figures who might be Saints Benedict and Bernard or one of them might be a portrait of a local deacon on account of the realism in the face of the figure. The theory that these figures are patrons of the church is strengthened by the discovery of similar figures in related frescoes at the monastery of Saint Peter of Berga. The third archangel, Raphael, does not appear with the others in the semidome but in the lower section. At the bottom is the announcement, the biblical prophecy, represented by means of combined images of the visions of Isaiah and Ezequiel. In keeping with the first, two magnificent seraphim with three pairs of wings each purify the mouth of the prophets with glowing embers which they are holding with tongs. Next to them are the prophets, represented with their hands together in an attitude of reverence. At the same time, the seraphim intone the Trisagion, or song of praise to the Lord, represented by the letters SCS, SCS, SCS, which mean ‚Äòholy, holy, holy‚Äô. From this moment, the word of the prophets will be the word of God. Beneath the central window are the wheels of fire of Yahweh‚Äôs chariot, described in Ezequiel‚Äôs vision, which symbolise the presence of the Lord. On the vault was the Virgin and Child, representing the accomplishment of the prophecies, in the scene from Epiphany, with two archangels, Michael and Gabriel, patrons of sinners, in a representation very similar to that in the apse from Santa Maria in Cap d'Aran (The Cloisters, New York). A third archangel, Raphael, is represented on the right of the semicylinder, perhaps as the introducer of the two donor clergymen who appear on the left of the apse.  Composition  The frescoes are attributed to the Circle of the Master of Pedret. The Master of Pedret was the first significant painter of the Catalon Romanesque period and is named for the wall paintings at the church of San Quirze de Pedret in Berga.The Metropolitan Museum of Art (1993). The Art of Medieval Spain (AD 500-1200), New York. Distributed by Harry N Abrams, p. 194 The Apse at Aneu represents the end of a tradition, during this time the painter might have felt himself at liberty to relax old rules and abandon strict division into zones, therefore filling the bottom section not with lines of Apostles, but with less rigid elements of the prophetic vision.  Analysis  The √Äneu frescos make a complete break with the normal Catalan artistic scheme. The lower zone is unique and unrelated to the upper portion of the apse. The Byzantine influence appears to be strong in the style of the frescos, the seraphim have been noted to resemble those in the crypt at the cathedral of Anagni, near Rome. In addition there are touches of pure realism, this is seen in the details such as the unshaven face of the figure at the left of the lower register and the thin and deeply wrinkled face of Magus. The painting could represent direct borrowings from Byzantium or importations from Byzantine Art via Lombardy, Italy. This influence is shown in the costume of the Wise Men (or Maji) which is representative of the eastern court. Other features linking the artwork to Italy are the decorative border, simulated drapery (they have waves and circular medallions), and the geometrical border is similar to the one in the Roman church of San Carlo in Prugiasco (Switzerland).

The clashes resulted in casualties on both sides. Background The two countries fought a war in the early 1990s over the enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, while tensions have recently escalated. Since the beginning of 2011, 63 people have been killed in skirmishes between Armenia and Azerbaijan. The most recent tensions have been concentrated along the section of the Armenia-Azerbaijan border that runs between Tavush Province and Qazakh Rayon and started in April with cross-border firing on unknown origin. Previously, it had been noted that Azerbaijan was increasing its defense spending with the goal of ending occupation of Nagorno-Karabakh following a US$1.6 billion purchase of military equipment from Israel after it had been largely kept out of other arms markets with the Armenia-Russia relations and Armenia-United States relations hampering their efforts to acquire arms. On June 2, in response to the reported wounding of a Nerkin Karmirarghbyur resident by gunfire from Azerbaijan hours after a scheduled OSCE monitoring visit, OSCE monitoring officials conducted a unilateral field monitoring mission in the Tavush region to investigate recent incidents along the line of contact at the villages of Aygepar, Moses and Nerkin Karmiraghbyur, and make photographic and video records of the traces of the shelling.  Events  The first clashes occurred early on June 4, in which three Armenian soldiers were killed and six wounded near the villages of Berdavan and Chinari in Tavush Province. An Armenian Defense Ministry statement issued the same day said the soldiers had died while fighting back a cross-border incursion by Azerbaijani forces into the northern Tavush region during which \\"the enemy was repelled, suffering casualties.\\" The following day, four Azerbaijani soldiers were killed near Asagi Askipara, in the Qazakh Rayon of western Azerbaijan. An Armenian Defense Ministry statement said they had been part of a unit of 15 to 20 soldiers who had tried to infiltrate Armenian positions in the vicinity of Voskepar village in Tavish province. A separate shooting killed a fifth Azerbaijani soldier in the same district.Another Enemy Incursion in Tavoush; Armenian Forces Kill 5 Azerbaijani Soldiers http://hetq.am/eng/news/15184/another-enemy--incursion-in-tavoush;-armenian- forces-kill-5-azerbaijani-soldiers.html Initially, Azerbaijan refuted allegations of gunfire at the border or any Azerbaijani deaths and explained the incident involving deaths of three Armenian soldiers as a result of \\"internal disagreements within the Armenian army.\\" Azerbaijan's Defence Ministry later confirmed that the June 5 skirmish had taken place and had resulted in the death of five Azerbaijani soldiers, four of whom died during the confrontation, with a fifth killed later, shot from a distant position. Azerbaijan said that the fighting took place as a result of a subversive group from Armenia trying to penetrate into Azerbaijani territory at the village of Asagi Askipara. On June 6, according to Nagorno Karabakh's Defence Ministry, Azeri soldiers attempted to infiltrate into Nagorno-Karabakh, near Horadiz. One Karabakhi soldier was killed and two others were wounded. Panorama reported shooting from the Azeri side the next day.  Reaction  At the start of the incidents, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Armenia as part of a visit to the three southern Caucasus states. Both sides accused each other of a military diversion timed to coincide with her visit to the Caucasus. In Armenia, on June 4 and after hearing of the June 4 deaths, Clinton stated at a press conference that \\"I am very concerned about the danger of escalation of tensions and the senseless deaths of young soldiers and innocent civilians. The use of force will not resolve the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and therefore force must not be used.\\" She said that she had told President Serzh Sarkisian she would make those points in Baku when there. At the same press conference, Armenia's Foreign Minister Edward Nalbandian stated \\"Azerbaijan is not satisfied by the fact that every day there are violations by Azerbaijanis on the line of contact of Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh. They are trying to transfer the tension, to escalate the situation onto the border between Armenia and Azerbaijan which greatly undermines the negotiation process, as well as threatens the regional stability. The responsibility for all possible consequences of such activities lies on the Azeri side.\\" On June 6, after talks with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev in Baku, Clinton said that \\"the cycle of violence and retaliation must end.\\" On June 8, Deputy Prime Minister of Azerbaijan Ali Hasanov said that Azerbaijan's forces \\"were ready to clear Nagorno-Karabakh of its Armenian occupiers.\\" The U.S., Russian and French diplomats co-chairing the OSCE Minsk Group commented saying; Media Speaking about why international bodies did not make statements \\"naming and shaming\\" whichever side started the violence, Thomas de Waal explained that there was no way for them to know due to the small number (six) of OSCE monitors in the field, and 20,000 soldiers on both sides. The Armenia media suggested that Azerbaijan's aim is to increase tension along the border so that Azerbaijan can accuse the OSCE Minsk Group of an inability to control the situation and guarantee peace. Azerbaijan would then attempt to transfer the Karabakh issue from the OSCE to the United Nations because that organisation has recognized Azerbaijan's territorial integrity within its Soviet-drawn borders. Also, in 2012 Azerbaijan assumed non-permanent membership of the UN Security Council.

He played as a fly-half. He won 4 England caps, the first two on the 1990 England rugby union tour of Argentina, came on as a replacement during the 1992 Six Nations match against France and started at full back against France two years later. Schooldays He grew up in the village of Seaton, on the outskirts of Workington, playing junior Rugby League for the village youth teams coached by his father Reggie. He first went to Moorclose Secondary School before attending Workington Grammar School. Whilst playing school rugby David‚Äôs unique skills drew the attention of two physical education teachers, Tom Borthwick and Malcolm Brown, both county stalwarts and stars of Aspatria Rugby Union Football Club. At the age of fifteen he naturally came to Aspatria, after captaining an array of county school sides at both codes of Rugby and Soccer.Aspatria The History of a Rugby Union Football Club pages 70-71 Aspatria Rugby Union Football Club He made his senior debut in the 1985-1986 season when he helped Aspatria win the Cumberland Rugby Union Challenge Cup on two occasions. The 1987 final against Moresby was a personal triumph for Pears who scored fifteen of his sides nineteen points, including a winning try in the final five minutes. He starred again in the following season when Aspatria gained a narrow victory over Cockermouth, with Pears kicking three conversions. However it was the home tie against Wasps in the third round of the John Players Cup that brought him national attention. Although the Wasps fielded a side littered with internationals with Rob Andrews and Nigel Melville the opposition half-backs it was David Pears and his colleague George Doggart who earned the praise. After leading the County Colts to several memorable victories he was selected to play for the North of England Colts. In 1987 he was called into the squad for the England B international against Italy but suffered an injury and missed the game. Although the 1987-88 season was his last with the Aspatria club he made a memorable exit. He was without doubt the star of the Cumberland Cup winning side that shattered the dreams of Moresby. He made an outstanding contribution to the rejuvenation of the county side; he played magnificently against Wasps and other Pilkington Cup opposition and was instrumental in assisting Aspatria secure a position in the Courage North Division 2 League.Aspatria The History of a Rugby Union Football Club pages 70-71 Sale Rugby Union Football Club At the beginning of the 1988-99 season, in conjunction with teammate George Doggart, Pears signed for Sale.David Pears: My Life in Rugby, The Rugby Paper 3 March 2015 Shortly afterwards he was invited to attend an under 21 international training session at Nottingham. He gained his first England B cap on 22 October 1988, when England were beaten by Australia. He gained his first North Divisional representative cap against the Midlands, a few days before his 21st birthday, scoring nineteen points with five penalties and one try. By 1989, Pears career was riding high, he finished 8th overall in the ‚ÄòTop Points‚Äô competition, scoring 239 points, including seven tries, fourteen conversions, fifty-four penalties and seven drop goals.Aspatria The History of a Rugby Union Football Club pages 70-71 Harlequins Rugby Union Football Club After spending a season with Sale, Pears moved further south to join Twickenham based club Harlequins, where he spent most of the 1990s. During his time at Harlequins the club reached two Pilkington Cup finals. They won the first against Northampton in 1991 and lost the second against Bath the following year. Both went to extra-time. His junior international career was also gaining strength, with games against the United States of America, Roumania, Ireland, Italy, Fiji, France and Russia.David Pears: My Life in Rugby, The Rugby Paper 3 March 2015 International Pears won four caps for England, the last two against France in Paris, where they won both matches. The first game, in 1992, was a brutal affair. Two of the French forwards were sent off and England won quite convincingly, 31-13. Pears came on midway through the first half after Rob Andrew suffered a nasty gash to his head. However, within a minute of stepping on the field Jean-Fran√ßois Tordo gave him a crack and broke his nose. That was nothing compared to the rest of the injuries he sustained through his career. He once suffered a suspected broken neck playing in a Seven-a-side game for Harlequins. On another occasion on the Friday before an international against Wales, he tore a hamstring in training, denying him the chance to play at Twickenham. He also broke his ankle the week before Andrew announced his retirement, and missed three whole seasons as a result. He was regarded by many as Andrew's natural successor in the England No.10 jersey but Mike Catt got the opportunity instead.David Pears: My Life in Rugby, The Rugby Paper 3 March 2015 Final years After leaving Harlequins he had a short spell at both Bracknell and Worcester.

The first recording of the song to be released by any artist was by Ronnie Burns, first as a B-side to his Exit, Stage Right single in June 1967 and a month later on his Ronnie LP. In 1969, Barry and Maurice Gibb performed an acoustic version with their sister Lesley, in a BBC Two special, made during the period when Robin Gibb had left the group to pursue a solo career.

It is in the deanery of Winwick, the archdeaconry of Warrington, and the diocese of Liverpool. History In 1850 Knott's Mill was built in the village, some distance from the nearest church of St Luke. Initially services were held in the Church Inn, and it was decided to build a church for the mill workers. It was designed by the Lancaster architect E. G. Paley, and built between 1859 and 1861 at a cost of ¬£1,073.75 (). The church was consecrated on 21 November 1861 by the Bishop of Chester. It provided seating for 345 people. In 1961 to celebrate the centenary of the church, a new choir vestry was added, and was dedicated by the Bishop of Warrington. Architecture The church is described as being \\"modest\\". The west front contains a three-light window flanked by buttresses. Above this is an arch carrying a double bellcote. There are no aisles. The two-manual pipe organ was built in 1932 by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool, and rebuilt in 1988 by David Wells, also of Liverpool.

The films are set during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. They particularly focused on Frederick the Great, who ruled Prussia from 1740 to 1786 greatly expanding its territory (hence known widely as Fridericus-Rex-Filme). The films were extremely popular with German audiences and an estimated forty four were produced by the end of the Second World War (twenty-seven of them during the Weimar era).Kreimeier p.93-94 Origins While there were Prussian-themed films as far back as 1912‚Äì1913, the breakthrough came with the release in 1922 of the first two parts of the Fridericus Rex series featuring Otto Geb√ºhr as Frederick the Great. Two further parts were released in 1923.Kreimeier p.93-94 The success of Fridericus Rex cemented the popularity of the genre and many similar films were produced in following years. Otto Geb√ºhr became closely associated with Frederick and played him numerous times in both the Weimar and Nazi periods. The boom in Prussian films came shortly after the end of the First World War. Following its defeat Germany had been forced to accept the loss of territory - badly denting national pride. The Kaiser Wilhelm II, a member of the Hohenzollern dynasty which had ruled in parts of Prussia since the sixteenth century, was deposed in 1918, and Germany became a Republic. The films are sometimes seen as prefiguring the rise of Nazism, but may at the time have represented a nostalgic wish for a restored monarchy. End Following the collapse of the Nazi regime and the Allied Occupation of Germany in 1945, strict rules were enacted concerning German films and any perceived promotion of German ultra-nationalism which might lead to a revival of Nazism was outlawed. This effectively ended the cycle of \\"Prussian films\\", although films set in the Prussian-era continued.

Based on a story by Jack Natteford, the film is about a young Englishman who inherits a ranch that he wants to sell, but is turned into a real Westerner by a singing cowboy. Plot Following the death of his father, Edward (Ronald Sinclair), the young Earl of Granville, travels from England with his solicitor, Henry Wyndham (John Ward), to his father's ranch in the Western United States. There he is welcomed by ranch foreman Gene Autry (Gene Autry) and his sidekick Frog Millhouse (Smiley Burnette) who promised their late friend that they would make a real Westerner of his son. Gene is surprised by Edward's arrogant demeanor and dismayed to learn that Wyndham plans to sell the ranch, which is deeply in debt. After Gene rescues Edward from a runaway horse, Edward apologizes for his earlier behavior, leading Gene to conclude that the young Englishman is a \\"regular fellow\\". They give him the nickname \\"Spud\\", which was also his father's nickname, and encourage him not to sell the ranch. Soon after, Jim Neale (Bill Elliott), a wealthy rancher to whom the late earl owed money, approaches Edward and offers to buy the ranch, warning him that if he does not pay the money his father owed him, he will take him to court. Neale unknowingly inspires them to sell their cow ponies to the Army to raise the money necessary to save the ranch. A few days later, proves his mettle by helping round up the horses and drive them back to the ranch. Intending to sell the horses to Colonel Allen (Guy Usher) at Fort Wayne, Gene and the others head along the dusty roads in their wagons, at one point deliberately dusting the passengers of a buggy. Gene doesn't know that the buggy contains Neale, Colonel Allen, and his daughter Bernice (Judith Allen). Later at the fort, Bernice recognizes Gene when he comes to the colonel's quarters. Pretending to be a maidservant, she falsely tells Gene that Colonel Allen is hard of hearing, and the next day, the colonel is annoyed by Gene's yelling at him during the horse auction. The bids offered by Gene and Neale are identical, so Colonel Allen proposes that they each race twelve horses the next morning to see who wins the contract. That night, while Gene manages to elude Neale's henchment, Edward locks up a process server attempting to serve a summons giving Neale all their property. Meanwhile, Gene reveals to Bernice that he knows who she is. While they are quarreling, Gene spots a fire in the barn where his horses are being kept and rushes to save them. Afterwards, Frog tells Gene that he doesn't know who knocked him out and started the blaze, but he did manage to grab the man's watch in the struggle, which can be used to identify the arsonist. The next morning, Gene enters the race with the five horses he has left. Edward tells Bernice what a fine person Gene is for helping him. Frog discovers that the watch belongs to Neale's henchman, Joe Larkins (Bud Osborne). Despite Neale's dirty tricks, Gene manages to win the race, and Edward's ranch is awarded the contract. Afterwards, Larkins reveals Neales's underhanded schemes, and Gene and Bernice put their differences behind them.

It was thought to be built in the 1660s, although later research seems to suggest it was built around 1715, and it includes a terraced walled garden. It is located east of Drogheda less than half a mile from the estuary of the River Boyne. Beaulieu House History The lands around the current Beaulieu were owned by the de Verdun family at the end of the 12th century. The Plunkett family, originally from Dublin, married into the de Verduns and became associated with the area from the early 14th century onwards. The Plunketts had to surrender the lands after the Confederate war in the mid-17th century. The predecessor to the present house was a Jacobean manor house constructed in 1628. Sir Benjamin Tichborne, 1st Baronet of England (c.1540 - 6 September 1629), MP for Petersfield 1588-1589 and Hampshire 1593 had a younger son and judge, Sir Henry Tichborne who went on to defend the attempted siege of Drogheda in 1642 in the Irish Confederate Wars. Henry was awarded lands at Beaulieu in 1666Dunlop, Robert \\"Henry Tichborne\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol. 56 pp.375-7 and the manor on which to rebuild if he wished and he did so with the input of two further generations. His eldest son was Sir William Tichborne of Beaulieu whose eldest son was another Henry Tichborne and who was created a Baronet (1697) and later Baron Ferrard of Beaulieu (1715) however he, Henry Tichborne (1663‚Äì1731), had no surviving sons. The family later intermarried with the family of Admiral Nelson. The house remains with descendants and the rural villages of Beaulieu Cross and Beltichburn in the nearby country was named after the house and them respectively. The walled garden has of formal plant landscape and a good variety of horticulture. Today Guided tours of the estate are available on selected days during the summer months. The grounds and house also offer the ability to host weddings, trade shows, conferences, training days or photograph backdrop. Motor racing museum Gabriel De Freitas, the late owner who was in the 10th generation of the Tichbornes raced under the name Gabriel Konig, and was a prominent 1960s-1970s female racing driver. She collected classic racing and rally saloons with alongside a few other classic, luxury cars which form the motor racing museum. As such the venue has parallels to Beaulieu Abbey and its National Motor Museum in Hampshire in the United Kingdom.

Biography Born to a lowly family, Vatatzes had managed to accumulate great riches through his position of apographeus (chief tax official), which he exercised in Thessalonica and eastern Macedonia (Serres, Boleron, Strymon, and Mosynopolis) from 1333 to 1341, as attested in a series of official acts bearing his name. These acts also testify to his bearing the court office of protokynegos (head huntsman). His wealth enabled him to attach his family to some of the leading men in the state: his son married a daughter of Patriarch John XIV Kalekas, and one of his daughters married a son of the megas doux Alexios Apokaukos. At the outbreak of the civil war in 1341, he initially sided with John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347‚Äì1354), commanding troops around Didymoteicho, but in early 1342 he switched to the regency under Empress- dowager Anna of Savoy. He was appointed to the post of megas chartoularios in 1342 and appointed briefly governor of Thessalonica in 1343. Despite the familial ties to the leaders of the anti-Kantakouzenos faction, however, in summer 1343, he defected back to Kantakouzenos, surrendering several fortresses to him. In gratitude, Kantakouzenos named him megas stratopedarches. Soon after, Vatatzes defeated a loyalist army under a certain Aplesphares. One of his daughters married Suleyman, the Emir of Karasi, one of Kantakouzenos's Turkish allies. Following the death of Apokaukos in June 1345, however, he tried to re-approach the regency, by promising to turn the Turks against Kantakouzenos. According to the account provided in Kantakouzenos's own memoirs, Kantakouzenos twice sent envoys bidding him to abandon his treasonous designs, offering him pardon and more honours. Vatatzes refused, crossed into Thrace with a Turkish army, and tried to have them attack the towns held by Kantakouzenos. The Turks refused and killed him at Garella, taking his son and the other Byzantines of Vatatzes's entourage as slaves.

Benjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, has been described as the greatest exemplar of the self-made man. Inspired by Franklin's autobiography, Frederick Douglass developed the concept of the self-made man in a series of lectures that spanned decades starting in 1859. Originally, the term referred to an individual who arises from a poor or otherwise disadvantaged background to eminence in financial, political or other areas by nurturing qualities, such as perseverance and hard work, as opposed to achieving these goals through inherited fortune, family connections, or other privileges. By the mid-1950s, success in the United States generally implied \\"business success\\". Origins Benjamin Franklin, c. 1785. Oil by DuplessisBenjamin Franklin, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, has been described as \\"undoubtedly the original self-made man.\\" and the greatest exemplar of the \\"self-made man\\". Both the American Dream and the self-made man concepts are inextricably linked and are rooted in American history. Franklin's autobiography was described by the editor of the 1916 edition, as the \\"most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men\\". His autobiography, which was dedicated to his son William Franklin, with the first chapter based on a 1771 letter to William, was used as illustrative of the journey of the self-made man in the eighteenth century in Colonial United States. Franklin's introduced the archetypal self-made man through his own life story in which in spite of all odds he overcame his low and humble origins and inherited social position‚Äîhis father was candle-maker‚Äîto re-invent himself through self-improvement based on a set of strong moral values such as \\"industry, economy, and perseverance\\" thereby attaining \\"eminence\\" in the classic rags to riches narrative. Franklin's maxims as published in his Autobiography provide others, specifically his own son, with strategies for attaining status in the United States, described as a \\"land of unequaled opportunity\\" in the last quarter of the 18th century. In his 1954 book The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches, Irvin G. Wyllie described how on February 2, 1832 Henry Clay had \\"coined the phrase 'self-made men'\\" during his speech to the United States Senate.The Mississippi Valley Historical Review Clay used the classic phrase to describe the \\"autonomy of our manufacturers ... in behalf of a paternalistic tariff\\" and the \\"irony has persisted throughout the history of the idea of self-help\\". The essential doctrine behind the self-made man is that success lies within the person himself and not with outside conditions. Wyllie investigated intellectual history, \\"not the history of a great abstraction but the saga of an idea that had power among the people.\\" To Wyllie, success in the United States by the mid-1950s, generally implied \\"business success.\\" Franklin and Frederick Douglass, describe the \\"self-made man in similar language: \\"Being possessionless and unencumbered by authority is the necessary beginning state for the potential self-made man. One cannot be \\"made\\" by the help of a father, teacher, mentor, etc. ..., but must rise by one's own grit, determination, discipline, and opportunism. The irony is that they have made themselves free from bounds and possessions, in a sense impoverished, so that they can then begin to acquire power and wealth on their own. The key is to acquire those possessions and power without help. The goal, then, is not to become famous or wealthy in the literal sense, but to participate in something precise and mythical.\\" Frederick Douglass, photographed between 1850 and 1860. Frederick Douglass developed the concepts in a series of lectures \\"Self-Made Men\\" from 1859 onward, for example 1895,Folder 1 of 16 (Series: Speech, Article, and Book File‚ÄîB: Frederick Douglass, Undated) which were published and archived in \\"The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress\\". In his 1872 lecture Douglass noted that there were \\"no such men as self-made men. That term implies an individual independence of the past and present which can never exist ... Our best and most valued acquisitions have been obtained either from our contemporaries or from those who have preceded us in the field of thought and discovery. We have all either begged, borrowed or stolen. We have reaped where others have sown, and that which others have strown, we have gathered.\\" However, he then provided one of his most detailed descriptions of the self-made man, Self-made men F. W. Pine wrote in his introduction of the 1916 publication of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin, that Franklin's biography provided the \\"most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men\\" with Franklin as the greatest exemplar of the \\"self-made man\\". Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, P. T. Barnum, Booker T. Washington, and Andrew Carnegie have also been described as self-made men. Both Carnegie and Lee Iacocca acknowledge that their own autobiographies were influenced by Franklin's. In theirs, both Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Reagan described their own origins as somewhat disadvantaged to reflect the narrative of self-made men. Blumenthal began his 2016 biography of Lincoln‚ÄîA Self-Made Man‚Äîwith the phrase, \\"I used to be a slave\\", referring to Lincoln's claim in 1856 that his \\"domineering and uneducated father\\" \\"exploited\\" young Lincoln by \\"renting\\" him out to \\"rural neighbors in Indiana.\\" Following his escape from servitude, Lincoln re-invented himself. Lincoln was inspired by Franklin's Autobiography. In an 1893 article in a railway magazine, Eugene V. Debs offered Andrew Johnson (18081875), the 17th President of the United States, Henry Wilson (1812‚Äì1875) was the 18th Vice President of the United States (1873‚Äì1875), Daniel Webster(17821852) who served twice as United States Secretary of State, Edward Everett, and Rufus Choate as exemplary nineteenth- century self-made men. Debs contrasted the successful self-made men to those whose \\"illiteracy, stupidity, lack of ambition, forever keeps them at the bottom ... [who] prefer pool to school, and choose to hammer coal and shovel it into a fire-box rather than employ their leisure in learning what they must know if they expect to rise.\\" He calls on them to \\"resolve upon a change of habits ‚Äî renounce follies and vices, obtain elementary books and study.\\" In John G. Cawelti's 1965 book Apostles of the self-made man, he listed Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Horatio Alger, and John Dewey as individuals \\"who either played a major role in shaping the success ideal or were associate with it in the public mind.\\" In the restaurant business Frank Giuffrida, the owner and manager of the Hilltop Steakhouse which opened in Saugus 1961 and became the biggest restaurant in the United States by the 1980s, is described as self-made man in the Slate article. Frank Giuffrida's parents were Sicilian immigrants who lived in Lawrence, Massachusetts. He began to work before he completed high school to run the family butcher shop when his father died. He opened the Hilltop Steakhouse after he sold the family store. His innovative strategy was to offer large size portions in a large scale restaurant, making up for the extra cost of generous portions by the economy of scale. According to the New York Times, the \\"Hilltop exceeded $27 million gross\\" in 1987. In the field of modern art, Arshile Gorky has been described as a self-made man who rose from \\"a dark, rich peasant culture\\" to prominence among \\"New York modern artists\\" through his \\"self-taught erudition and aggressive principles.\\" In literature and popular culture=Ragged Dick (1868) Horatio Alger Jr.'s six-volume Ragged Dick series which began with the first full-length novel, Ragged Dick published in May 1868, a Bildungsroman \\"whose name became synonymous with the rags-to-riches narrative\\", where young Dick eventually became the successful and distinguished Richard Hunter. In 1947, the Alexandria, Virginia-based Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, which was named after Horatio Alger, to honor the importance of perseverance and hard work. The Association grants scholarships and gives the Horatio Alger Award annually. All scholarships are funded by the generosity of the members of the Horatio Alger Association. The Great Gatsby (1925) In F. Scott Fitzgerald's magnum opus The Great Gatsby, describes the downfall of the \\"archetypal, if somewhat misguided\\" \\"socially ambitious self-made man\\" Jay Gatsby who rose from \\"an obscure and impoverished Midwestern childhood to become a wealthy and sought- after center of Long Island society\\". Gatsby contrasts with Ben Franklin and the characters in Horatio Alger Jr. novels, as successful self-made men. His story serves as a cautionary tale regarding the American Dream where \\"an unhappy fate is inevitable for the poor and striving individual, and the rich are allowed to continue without penalty their careless treatment of others' lives.\\" Ultra high-net-worth individuals According to the 2017 \\"World Ultra Wealth Report\\" by research company Wealth-X, \\"wealth creation\\" from 1997 through 2017 has been \\"driven largely by self-made individuals\\", mainly men. According to the report, ultra high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI), those who have a net worth of at least US$30 million, were \\"predominantly self-made\\" having \\"earned their fortunes\\". Two-thirds of the UHNWI sourced \\"their wealth from their own efforts\\" such as \\"fruitful business ventures or successful investments.\\" Of the 226,450 UHNWIs, 66% were self-made; of the 7,200 UHNW millennials (born between 1980‚Äì1995), 66% were self-made; of the 28,985 UHNW women, 45% were self-made; of the 33,290 UHNWI from emerging Asia (excluding Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong), 68% were self-made; and of the 34,961 UHNW Ivy League individuals, 75% were self-made. Cultural history In his 2000 book Creating the Modern Man, cultural historian Tom Pendergast traced the way in which the concept of the self-made man was referenced in men's magazines from 1900 through 1950. Pendergast divided masculinity into only two periods: Victorian, which was \\"based on property-ownership and family\\", and \\"post- Victorian\\", which was \\"based on a cult of personality, self-improvement, and narcissism\\". He described the \\"ideal Victorian man\\" as a \\"property owning man of character who believed in honesty, integrity, self-restraint, and duty to God, country, and family\\". The post-Victorian image of the self-made man was crucial to Pendergast's study.
