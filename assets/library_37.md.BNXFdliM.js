Biography She is the daughter of novelist Tony Hillerman and his wife Marie Unzner, and is married to photographer Don Strel. Anne has served as arts editor and editorial page editor, as well as writer, for The Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper and the Albuquerque Journal. Her first books were primarily about travel, local New Mexico points of interest, and restaurants. She and Strel collaborated on Santa Fe Flavors: Best Restaurants and Recipes and Gardens of Santa Fe. Tony Hillerman, who died in 2008, was best known for his Leaphorn and Chee mystery novels. Tony Hillerman's Landscapes: On the Road with Chee and Leaphorn was begun by Anne before his death, and includes his comments. With Anne gleaning locale details from her father's novels, and her husband taking the photographs, she intended it as a book to draw in readers of his novels, a guide for the reader to visualize the New Mexico and Arizona sites from the perspective of the two main protagonists Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. After her father's death, Anne continued the Leaphorn and Chee series, but Leaphorn's involvement is curtailed in the first chapter of the first book, Spider Woman's Daughter. Leaphorn is the victim of an assassination attempt, spends half of the book in a coma, and later was severely limited in his ability to communicate. Chee and Bernadette Manuelito are the crime solvers from that book forward in the series, with Leaphorn mentioned sporadically in the background but never fully active in the investigations. Spider Woman's Daughter garnered the 2014 Spur Award for Best First Novel from the Western Writers of America, and landed on the New York Times Best Seller list. She followed that with three more in the series, Rock With Wings, Song of the Lion and Cave of Bones, released April 2018, all of which have also been on the New York Times Best Seller list.

Early years Pierre-Auguste Roy was born on 26 August 1818 in Asni√®res, Charente-Inf√©rieure. He studied law, obtained his license and entered the bar of Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly, where he mainly dealt with financial matters. After the February Revolution, in 1848 he was appointed General Councilor of Charente-Inf√©rieure for the canton of Loulay. He was elected president of the Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly Agricultural Society. Second Empire Roy de Loulay became mayor of the town of Loulay, a few kilometers from Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. He ran as government candidate for election to the Corps l√©gislatif as deputy for the fourth constituency of Charent-Inferieure to replace the viscount Anatole Lemercier(fr), who was running for reelection. Roy was elected on 31 May 1863 and sat with the dynastic majority. He won 17,293 votes to 5,973 for Lemercier and 5,900 for a M. Simonnent. He was interested in all questions that affected the agriculture and viniculture in his district. On 4 April 1866 an imperial decree authorized Auguste Roy to change his surname to Roy de Loulay. Auguste Roy de Loulay was made a Knight of the Legion of Honour on 30 August 1868. He was reelected on 23 May 1869 and sat with the center right. He voted for the war with Prussia. He left office when the Third Republic was declared on 4 September 1870. Roy and Baron Eug√®ne Eschass√©riaux offered to organize national defense for the new government, but their offer was declined. Third Republic Auguste Roy de Loulay was elected a representative for Charente-Inf√©rieure on 8 February 1871, holding office until 7 March 1876. He sat with the Appel au peuple parliamentary group. His fellow deputies for Charente, Eug√®ne Eschass√©riaux and Alfred de Vast-Vimeux also sat with the Appel au peuple. He was one of five deputies who protested the degradation of Napoleon III. He joined the deputies in favour of free trade, voted for peace, voted to repeal the laws of exile, voted for the resignation of Adolphe Thiers, against the ministry of Albert de Broglie and against the constitutional laws. Roy de Loulay voted for public prayers, He voted against Henri-Alexandre Wallon's proposed amendment to the constitutional laws, and against the law on higher education. On several occasions he left the Right and voted with the Left. He does not seem to have made any speeches in the Assembly. Ch√¢teau de Mornay Roy de Loulay was reelected general councilor for the canton of Loulay. In 1876 he campaigned to be elected to the senate. During his campaign Roy de Loulay and the former deputies Jean-Baptiste Boffinton and Alfred de Vast-Vimeux signed a circular in which they declared, Roy de Loulay was elected Senator for Charente- Inf√©rieure on 30 January 1876. He voted for the dissolution of the chamber requested by the Broglie government. Roy de Loulay left office on 24 January 1885. After failing to be reelected Auguste Roy de Loulay gave all his attention to his Ch√¢teau de Mornay(fr), which he made into a virtual museum. He continued to serve in the General Council of Charente-Inf√©rieure, which he had entered in 1848, until his sudden death on 21 February 1896 in Paris.

Jacono also served prior to this as the Bishop of Molfetta after World War I and had worked in a trade before entering the priesthood. He was noted for his kindness and for his humble disposition; his holiness was evident to his flock during his episcopal tenure. His reputation for holiness endured in the decades after Jacono's death and this led to the introduction of his beatification cause in Caltanissetta on 24 October 2007; he was titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis named him as Venerable on 7 November 2018 upon confirming that Jacono lived a life of heroic virtue. Life Giovanni Jacono was born in Ragusa on 14 March 1873 to humble parents. He was baptized on the date of his birth in the church of San Giovanni. He did mandated service with the armed forces following the completion of his high school education and it was following this that he asked the Archbishop of Catania Giuseppe Francica-Nava de Bontif√® if he could commence his ecclesial studies. The archbishop allowed this and Jacono commenced his education. He first worked in a trade as a mason after high school despite harboring desires to become a priest. During this time he encountered his old schoolteacher who helped him enroll in a technical school in Ragusa. But his call to the priesthood grew stronger and so he acted upon it; he had not acted on it in the past because he deemed it improbable to have materialized. He became a porter and slept behind the main door each night. He had to undo his bed each morning since the bed could not be left there. Nava ordained Jacono to the priesthood in 1902 in Catania in San Giovanni la Punta and then sent the new priest to Rome to the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare to complete further studies. It was in that school that he befriended Angelo Giuseppe Roncalli ‚Äì the future Pope John XXIII. He returned to Catania following the completion of his studies where he was made a spiritual director for seminarians and a canon for the archdiocesan cathedral; he was later appointed as a rector. Pope Benedict XV later named Jacono in 1918 as the Bishop of Molfetta; he received his episcopal consecration from Nava in the metropolitan cathedral before his installation in his new see. The pope later named him as the Bishop of Caltanissetta in 1921 and Jacono was enthroned in that new see on that following 28 September. His predecessor (now Venerable) Antonio Augusto Intreccialagli defined him as \\"a true man of God\\" in a letter to Ms. Antonietta Mazzone (whom he would later encounter on one occasion). Jacono became noted for his deep devotion to his faith as well as for his kindness and his humble disposition. This made him an accessible individual for his people and there were often crowds when he was in the confessional booth. In late 1928 he granted the Extreme Unction and an apostolic benediction to Cardinal Nava on his deathbed; he attended Nava's funeral not long after and was the homilist. It became clear over time that his age was preventing him from some of the duties required of him. To that end Pope Pius XII ‚Äì in 1953 ‚Äì named Francesco Monaco as Jacono's coadjutor bishop with the right of succession upon Jacono's death or resignation. It proved to be the latter for Jacono resigned in 1956 and returned to Ragusa. But Pius XII also elevated him \\"ad personam\\" to the rank of archbishop and named Jacono as the Titular Archbishop o Mocissus (a ceremonial position). Jacono died in Ragusa in mid-1957 and left no last will; there was but one thing found on his desk: an envelope with 15 000 lira enclosed. There was written on the envelope: \\"For the poor of Saint Vincent\\". His remains were interred in the Ragusa Cathedral. Beatification process The beatification process opened under Pope Benedict XVI on 24 October 2007 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Jacono as a Servant of God and declared nihil obstat (no objections) to the cause. On the same date came a decree that transferred the forum for the cause from Ragusa (where Jacono died) to Caltanissetta (where Jacono served as its bishop). The diocesan process was inaugurated on 13 January 2008 and closed on 27 September 2012 before documentation from the investigation was sent to the C.C.S. who validated the process in Rome on 11 April 2014. The postulation later compiled and submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. for evaluation in 2017 and the theologians met and approved the dossier on 19 April 2018. Pope Francis titled Jacono as Venerable on 7 November 2018 after confirming that the late prelate had lived a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Discalced Carmelite priest Romano Gambalunga.

Written in High Tamil distich form, it has 25 chapters each containing 10 kurals or couplets, making a total of 250 couplets all dealing with human love. The term inbam or kamam, which means 'pleasure', correlates with the third of the four ancient Indian values of dharma, artha, kama and moksha. However, unlike Kamasutra, which deals with different methods of lovemaking, the Book of Inbam expounds the virtues and emotions involved in conjugal love between a man and a woman, or virtues of an individual within the walls of intimacy, keeping a·πüam or dharma as the base. Etymology Inbam is the Tamil word that corresponds to the Sanskrit term 'kama', and pƒÅl refers to 'division'. It is one of the four mutually non-exclusive aims of human life in the Indian philosophy called the Puru·π£ƒÅrthas, the other three being a·πüam (dharma), poru·∏∑ (artha), and veedu (moksha).See: * A. Sharma (1982), The Puru·π£ƒÅrthas: a study in Hindu axiology, Michigan State University, , pp 9‚Äì12; See review by Frank Whaling in Numen, Vol. 31, 1 (Jul., 1984), pp. 140‚Äì142; * A. Sharma (1999), The Puru·π£ƒÅrthas: An Axiological Exploration of Hinduism, The Journal of Religious Ethics, Vol. 27, No. 2 (Summer, 1999), pp. 223‚Äì256; * Chris Bartley (2001), Encyclopedia of Asian Philosophy, Editor: Oliver Learman, , Routledge, Article on Purushartha, pp 443 The concept of inbam is found in some of the earliest known verses in the Vedas,Rig Veda Book 10 Hymn 129 Verse 4Ralph Griffith (Translator, 1895), The Hymns of the Rig veda, Book X, Hymn CXXIX, Verse 4, pp 575 Upanishads,Klaus Klostermaier, A Survey of Hinduism, 3rd Edition, State University of New York Press, , pp. 173-174 and epics such as the Mahabaratha. Although inbam sometimes connotes sexual desire and longing in contemporary literature, the concept more broadly refers to any desire, wish, passion, longing, pleasure of the senses, the aesthetic enjoyment of life, affection, or love, with or without sexual connotations. The term also refers to any sensory enjoyment, emotional attraction and aesthetic pleasure such as from arts, dance, music, painting, sculpture and nature.See: * Kate Morris (2011), The Illustrated Dictionary of History, , pp 124; * Robert E. Van Voorst, RELG: World, Wadsworth, , pp 78 Inbam in its sanskritized form kama is common to all Indian languages. Inbam is considered an essential and healthy goal of human life when pursued without sacrificing the other three goals of aram or dharma (virtuous, proper, moral life), poru·∏∑ or artha (material prosperity, income security, means of life) and veedu or moksha (liberation, release, self-actualization).The Hindu Kama Shastra Society (1925), The Kama Sutra of Vatsyayana, University of Toronto Archives, pp. 8Gavin Flood (1996), The meaning and context of the Purusarthas, in Julius Lipner (Editor) - The Fruits of Our Desiring, , pp 11-13 In spite of the Tamil term inbam referring to pleasure, Valluvar preferred to call the book KƒÅmattuppƒÅl rather than InbattuppƒÅl in line with the trivarga of the Puru·π£ƒÅrtha. The book and its chapters The Book of Inbam talks about the emotions gone through by a man and a woman when they fall in love with each other. It covers the emotions of love both in the pre-marital and the post- marital states. With 25 chapters, the Book of Inbam is the smallest of the three books of the Kural text. ;Book Three‚ÄîBook of Love (25 chapters) * Chapter 109.

The Pleasures of 'Temporary Variance' (‡Æä‡Æü‡Æ≤‡ØÅ‡Æµ‡Æï‡Øà ≈´·π≠aluvakai): 1321‚Äì1330 As with Books I and II of the Kural text, the author did not group the chapters under any subdivisions. However, the ten medieval commentators, who were the first to write commentaries about the Tirukkural, divided the Book of Inbam variously between two and three portions. For example, while Parimelalhagar's division consists of two parts, other medieval scholiasts have divided the Book of Inbam into three portions. Parimelalhagar's two-part division includes Kalavu and Karpu. However, Manakkudavar goes to the extent of dividing the book into five: Kurinji, Mullai, Marudham, Neidhal, and Paalai, in accord with the Sangam practice that divides the land into said five divisions. Kaalingar and Mosikeeranar divide Book III into three parts: masculine sayings (Chapters 109 to 115), feminine sayings (Chapters 116 to 127), and common sayings (which includes both masculine and feminine sayings; Chapters 128 to 133). While some of the medieval commentators consider couplets 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Chapter 115 as feminine sayings, Kaalingar considers these as masculine ones and goes on to elaborate accordingly. Pari Perumal divides Book III into three, likening it to the Kamasutra text. However, modern scholars such as M. V. Aravindan oppose this idea of comparing Kural's Book III with Kamasutra. Poetic aspects It is generally accepted by scholars that of all the three books of the Kural, the Book of Inbam is where the poetic genius of Valluvar attains its greatest height. This is possibly because the traditions of early classical literature of the Sangam poetry continue to remain strong in the domain of \\"pleasure.\\" According to T. P. Meenakshisundaram, every couplet of the Book of Inbam may be considered a \\"dramatic monologue of the agam variety.\\" According to Czech Indologist Kamil Zvelebil, true poetry in the Tirukkural appears in the Book of Inbam, where \\"the teacher, the preacher in Valluvar has stepped aside, and Valluvar speaks here almost the language of the superb love-poetry of the classical age\\": :\\"Shall I draw back, or yield myself, or shall both mingled be, :When he returns, my spouse, dear as these eyes to me.\\" (Kural 1267) :\\"Withdraw, it burns; approach, it soothes the pain; :Whence did the maid this wondrous fire obtain?\\" (Kural 1104) :\\"A double witchery have glances of her liquid eyes; :One glance is glance that brings me pain; the other heals again.\\" (Kural 1091) Comparison with other ancient texts The subject of pleasure that the Book of Inbam deals with is often compared by scholars chiefly with the Kamasutra. However, the Kural's approach of the subject differs entirely from the Kamasutra, which is all about eros and techniques of sexual fulfillment. With a virtuous attitude, the Book of Inbam remains unique as a poetic appreciation of flowering human love as explicated by the Sangam period's concept of intimacy, known as agam in the Tamil literary tradition. In the words of Zvelebil, while Kamasutra and all later Sanskrit erotology are sastras, that is, objective and scientific analyses of sex, the Book of Inbam is \\"a poetic picture of eros, of ideal love, of its dramatic situations.\\" The Kural differs from every other work in that it follows ethics, surprisingly a divine one, even in its Book of Love. According to Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the Book of Inbam helps date the Kural literature since it \\"describes the hero as a one-woman man and concubines are absent. This is in conformity with Valluvar's views on personal morality.\\" While the work of Confucius shares many of its philosophies with the first two books of the Kural text, the subject of conjugal love expounded by the Book of Inbam is entirely absent in the work of Confucius. Translations Of the three books of the Kural, the Book of Inbam has the fewest translations available. The chief reason behind this was that many translators, particularly non-Indian translators, had long mistook the content of the book for something similar to Vatsyayana's Kamasutra and considered it inappropriate to translate after studying the two previous Kural books on virtue and polity. Many of the early European translators, including Constantius Joseph Beschi, Francis Whyte Ellis, William Henry Drew, and Edward Jewitt Robinson had this misconception. For instance, Drew remarked, \\"The third part could not be read with impunity by the purest mind, nor translated into any European language without exposing the translator of it to infamy.\\" Later Western translators such as Satguru Sivaya Subramuniya Swami, too, avoided translating Book Three of the Kural. Nevertheless, several later scholars of the nineteenth century realized that the Book of Inbam is only a poetic expression of the emotions involved in conjugal human love and started translating it too. For example, Pandurang Sadashiv Sane, a twentieth-century Marathi translator of the Kural, said, \\"The translation of this book is available in Hindi with the name of 'Tamil Veda', but it includes only two sections: 'Dharma' (Arattuppal) and 'Artha' (Porutpal). The third section discussing 'Kama' (Kamattuppal) has been dropped. Actually in this section there is nothing which can be said to be obscene or vulgar. It is a very fine section. I have translated that section in full.\\" See also * Tirukkural * Aram (Kural book) * Porul (Kural book) Citations= References Primary sources (Tamil)= * Alathur Kilar, K·∏ªuvƒÅi Illai!, ‡Æ™‡ØÅ‡Æ±‡Æ®‡Ææ‡Æ©‡ØÇ‡Æ±‡ØÅ [PuranƒÅnuru] (Verse 34), See original text in Tamil Virtual University.

In 1597 he commanded a ship in the expedition to the Azores. In 1601, Scott was implicated in Essex's Rebellion but succeeded in clearing himself, and in the same year was a parliamentary candidate for Kent in 1601. He was unsuccessful on this first attempt, but was elected its MP in the Parliament of 1604 and for Maidstone in the Addled Parliament of 1614. He became a member of the Council for Virginia in 1607, the year when that colony was re-established, subscribing ¬£75, and was a councillor of the Virginia Company of London in 1609. He died in 1616 and was buried at Brabourne in Kent. Early life John Scott was born about 1564 according to his HOP biography.

Beds had been specially endowed on the condition that they should be in the care of a woman practitioner. Here she built up a large gynaecological out-patient department. Later she was also appointed honorary surgeon to the Liverpool Samaritan Hospital. In Liverpool she fought to have more women appointed to hospital posts, and became a leading member of the North of England Medical Women's Society. She was active in the suffrage movement and was chair of the Liverpool branch of the Conservative and Unionist Women's Suffrage Society.Leneman, L.

Surgeon at Royaumont Frances Ivens inspecting wounded French soldiers in Royaumont, painted by Norah Neilson Gray In December 1914, she volunteered to serve in France as head of the unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital, which was established in the Abbaye de Royaumont under the French Red Cross. Before the war, as her practice was confined to women and children, she had not treated men. Nor had she any experience of treating battle casualties, and read widely on the subject, as shown by the books which she later donated to the Liverpool Medical Institution. The hospital treated the French wounded from the Western Front. The excellence of her leadership and the work of the unit was recognised by the French Army. Initially 100 beds were opened but by the end of the conflict this had risen to 600. She continued as m√©decin chef until February, 1919, with only one period of leave in England, which she spent largely in lecturing to raise money for the hospital. In 1917 another hospital at Villers-Cotter√™ts was opened, closer to the Western Front. There she operated under shell fire during the German advance in March, 1918, until they were forced to evacuate back to Royaumont. Over the course of the war Ivens and her team treated over 10,861 patients including 8,752 soldiers. The bulk of the major surgery was carried out by Ivens and her second in command Ruth Nicholson. The remarkably low mortality rate of 1.82% was lower than similar military hospitals.McLaren, E.S. (1919) A history of the Scottish Women‚Äôs Hospital. London: Hodder and Stoughton. p. 8. The Royaumont doctors pioneered a new approach to the treatment of gas gangrene, using X-rays and bacteriology for diagnosis, followed by extensive surgical debridement of the affected tissue. She published accounts of these in the medical literature. They were also able to use antiserum supplied by the Pasteur Institute in Paris. The hospital was inspected and approved by many French generals and government officials, and its reputation was largely due to the leadership of Frances Ivens. Post-war career After the war, Ivens returned to hospital practice in Liverpool. She was closely involved with the rebuilding of the Maternity Hospital, and with the formation of the Liverpool Women's Radium League. She was also a leader in the establishment of the Crofton Recovery Hospital for Women. During this period, Ivens was active in promoting the cause of women in medicine, and was elected president of the Medical Women's Federation from 1924 to 1926. A few years later, she was the first woman to be elected vice president of the Liverpool Medical Institution in 1929 when she became a founder fellow of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists that same year.Peel, J.

At the age of sixty, she married Charles Knowles, now a widower, whom she had known from student days. They moved to London where she continued a consultant practice until she and her husband retired to Truro in Cornwall. She was succeeded in her posts in Liverpool by Ruth Nicholson who had been her assistant at Royaumont. With the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 she acted as medical inspector for the Red Cross in Cornwall. She also played a leading role in the activities of the Royaumont and Villers Cotter√™ts Association and was chairman of the Cornwall committee of the Friends of the Fighting French. Later years and death A fluent French speaker she made regular visits to France where she would visit former patients and many of the wounded whom she had treated at Royaumont wrote regularly to her. She kept in touch too with former staff members who would meet annually at the annual dinner of the Royaumont Association. She died on 6 February 1944, at the age of 74, in Killagorden, St Clement, Cornwall. Honours and awards In recognition of her service at Royaumont she was decorated by the French President with the Cross of the L√©gion d'honneur.Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

Some of the members of this branch converted to Christianity in the late 6th century and migrated to what is today Syria where they allied with the Ghassanid tribe (here are some known Ghassanid families: Atiyah, Ayoub, Aridah, Azar, Barakat, Chalhoub, Chedid, Dib, Fares, Farhat, Gebara, Gharios, Ghanem, Habib, Haddad, Howayek, Hbeish, H√©lou ‚Äì who came to Lebanon in the 14th century from Ayn Halya in Syria -, Kandil, Khazen, Khoury, Lahd, Maalouf, Madi, Makhlouf, Matar, Nawfal of Tripoli, Obeid, Oweiss, Rached, Rahhal, Razouk, Saab, Salam√©, Saliba, Sarkis, Sayegh, Shammas, Semaan of Kaftoun, Sfeir, Sweidan and Tyan among many others) who are also Qahtani (or Qahtanite)-Kahlani (or Kahlan) ‚Äì but members of the Azd tribe (like apparently the Kanaan family who moved from Khanawna or Kanunah or Kunawnah to what is now Syria and from there, some members went to what are now Palestine and, for the Christians among them, Cyprus and Lebanon - in Jezzine, in Aabey in Aley and in Brummana and in Khenchara in Northern Metn -) ‚Äì and also converted mostly to Christianity. During the Byzantin era, like all the Christian families, the Fayad family has been moved to Izra in Hauran (Syria). Other members of the Jadila branch, members of the Banu (or Bani) Lam sub-branch, later converted to Islam and migrated to what are today Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran as well as Egypt, Syria, Jordan and Palestine and later to Lebanon. The contemporary history of the family, however, starts with a Greek-Orthodox priest, Father Hanna Fayad, known as Father Sophronius. In the 16th century, one of his son, Chehadeh, and his family moved in Byblos (Mount-Lebanon). Since the 17th century, the family has branches in Beirut, in Akkar and in Koura, and also in Homs (Syria). The Fayad family is one of the seven founding families of the contemporary Beirut, the capital of Lebanon, along with the Trad, Tu√©ni, Gebeily, Dagher, Saba and Bustros families. Following the independence of Lebanon, Boulos Fayad became one of its main ministers, being in charge of the following portfolios: justice, economy, agriculture and health. His nickname was ‚Äúpatriarch of the Greek-Orthodox‚Äù. His son, Halim Fayad, later became governor (mohafez) of South-Lebanon and then deputy head of the municipality of Beirut. There have been also other members of the Fayad family who became ministers such as Elias Fayad (agriculture) and Nicolas Fayad (Posts & Telegraph). A large portion of the Fayad family is Christian Maronite. The Fayad family is also one of the two prominent families (along with the H√©lou family) of Baabda, the capital of Mount-Lebanon. The H√©lou family moved from B√©char√© to Byblos and then to Kesrwan, Aley, Baabda and Jezzine while some moved from Byblos to Machta in Syria and then to Beirut and Tripoli. Other families of Baabda are Khoury, Asmar, Abi Rashed, Malat, Abou Khalil, Rahal, Saab and Maatouk. The Fayad family settled in Baabda at the end of the 18th century and are Christian Maronites. The Lebanese presidency palace is in Baabda. Fayadiyeh, ‚ÄúFayad‚Äôs village‚Äù, is part of the municipality of Baabda. The Lebanese military academy is in Fayadiyeh. On October 3, 1918, Habib Saleh Fayad, head of the municipality of Baabda, became the first Head of the State of Mount-Lebanon after the end of the Ottoman rule. Later, Joseph Fayad was also the head of the municipality of Baabda. In 1981, at the request of Bachir Gemayel (head of the Lebanese Forces) who became President of Lebanon (in 1982) ‚Äì because of the war, the members of the Lebanese Parliament met in the Lebanese Military Academy in Fayadiyeh, rather than in the Parliament Building in Beirut, to elect him ‚Äì , Najib Fayad, originally from Baabda, was appointed as head of the Gamma Group (that succeeded to Dar al- Amal, a popular committee, led by Raymond Arab) to transform it into the first Lebanese think-tank including specialists, academics and intellectuals (such as Georges Freiha ‚Äì former coordinator of the popular committees and chief of staff of Bachir Gemayel presidential campaign -, Joseph Maila, Selim Jahel, Selim Catafago, Ibrahim Sahyoun and Najib Amiouni). The Gamma Group planned the building of a modern and strong state in all of its sectors. It was like a ‚Äúshadow government‚Äù composed of eighteen branches equivalent to eighteen ministries. The Gamma Group is behind the launching of the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation (LBC) in 1985, one of the current most popular MENA TV channels. The wealth of this aristocratic family originally comes from the silk industry (before its decline) and the agriculture (on their lands). Kamal Fayad‚Äôs investment fund, private equity fund and hedge fund, KAF Investments, is active in equity derivative products on various stock exchanges and in other diverse business areas, such as single-stock trading, corporate derivatives, mergers and acquisitions, stock financing, capital guarantees and baskets of stocks. Kamal Fayad is originally from Baabda. His hedge fund uses statistical arbitrage and event-driven strategies. KAF Investments is also investing in the digital market as well as in several industrial sectors. In Lebanon, KAF Investments owns KAF Contemporary Art Gallery (in Beirut), KAF Real Estate (in Baabda) and Brains Brewery (961 and LB). Some members of the Fayad family moved to Mexico, the United States, Canada, Argentine, Colombia, France and the United Kingdom. There are mostly Christians, either Greek- Orthodox or Maronites. The Fayad family has been the partner of France for trading and exporting its products as well as developing business development and strategies in the emerging countries.

The book details how racial hierarchies impact family interactions and treatment in Brazil and how these actions impact the well-being of the family members.  Synopsis  Hordge- Freeman aims to examine the role that families play in race-making and race negotiation in Brazil. Specifically, she examines how families socialize race and teach their family members how to act appropriately in society according to their race. This is especially important since the majority of family studies research compares different families to each other instead of looking within families. Hordge-Freeman argues that affective capital, which refers to experiences of love and affection, are unequally distributed in families. Specifically, white family members receive more affective capital than darker family members. Hordge-Freeman goes further to explain the consequences of this imbalance and how it negatively impacts the psychological well-being of darker family members. Hordge-Freeman also analyzes how Afro-Brazilians have to manipulate their image in order to look more professional and acceptable by society, which Hordge-Freeman refers to embodied capital. Examples of this include changing hairstyles and dressing in clean and professional clothes. Lastly, Hordge-Freeman examines the racial fluency tendencies of families, which pertain to their responses to racism. The family can either choose to accept these racist ideas or actively resist them. The book is broken into three parts. Part I focuses on how families operate in Brazil and their role in racial socialization. In addition, Part I also explores how racial stigma affects familial relationships. Part 1 consists of three chapters. Part II focuses on how racial socialization from the family translates to behaviors in the public sphere, examines three families that are racially transgressive and their attempt to resist racism, and a conclusion. The book ends with a conclusi Part II contains four chapters. Lastly, an appendix of how interviews were coded is offered at the end. = Part 1 = Part 1 begins by arguing that families normalize racial stigma and further it in Brazil. Hordge-Freeman uses examples from observations and interviews. For example, one family is anxious about the color of their unborn child because they view African features as bad and ugly. Although once the child is born she has mostly white features, she possesses a wide nose which is considered black. Thus, the mother participates in a common practice in Brazil in which she pinches the baby‚Äôs nose for thirty seconds to narrow it. The mother not only does this voluntarily, but by the pressure from neighbors and other family members. Interviews with other families affirm the desire for the baby to have white characteristics, such as a narrow nose, light skin, and straight hair. These desires influence how the child is treated once they are born, as darker children are given less attention, praise, love than their whiter siblings. Part 1 also examines how this dynamic plays out in interracial relationships, as families tend to reject the darker partner of their family member. However, resistance is examined in Brazil as more Afro-Brazilian do not hesitate to say that they are negra and keep their natural hair instead of straightening it. Unfortunately, some families reject other family members when these actions are taken. The last section of Part 1 addresses how stigma and differential treatment damages the psychological well-being of Afro-Brazilians. = Part II = Part II focuses on how people identify themselves racially and color-wise so that they can navigate society. Most Afro-Brazilians who would be considered preta identity as morena, a vague racial term to identify anyone of color. Also, when asked to identify others, people tend to use the term morena to make sure they do not offend anybody. Race is also impacted by wealth and class, as poor Afro-Brazilians with light skin are still considered negra and wealthier Afro-Brazilians with darker skin are considered morena. This refers to racial fluency and how people learn how to identify race appropriately. This chapter also reveals how families tend to ignore their African heritage completely and are unaware of the history of slavery and what happened after slavery was abolished. This section then progressed to talk about how Afro- Brazilians navigate the public sphere, specifically by tolerating racism at the work place, avoiding certain white places, and learning how to act during social events. Lastly, the author explores how racially transgressive families behave differently. These families embrace their race by acknowledging racism exists, talking about their African heritage, and talking about instances where racism occurs, although humor is often used to address these situations. These families tend to be more aware about the history of Afro-Brazilians and embrace their African features like their hair.  Critical reception  Critical reviews of The Color of Love: Racial Features, Stigma and Socialization of Black Brazilian Families are mostly positive. Jan Hoffman French, an anthropology professor at the University of Richmond, did not have a negative comment about the book in her review. In fact, she states that this book is, \\"an important contribution to the growing academic literature on race and color in Brazil.\\" She also praises the clarity in which the book was written, in which she states that, \\"This book is readable, while being nuanced and sophisticated, making it useful in a variety of settings...\\" The critical review by Andrew Kettler, a history professor at the University of Toronto, echoes these compliments about the book. However, Kettler offers more criticisms of the book, which include lack of quantitative data and also questions the reliability of depending on scenarios that happened to one specific family to make broader implications of Brazilian society as a whole. However, overall Kettler praises the book as he states, \\"In summary, the reader is delivered a cynical though decidedly interesting summary of how racial and phenotypic ideals perpetuate within Brazilian families.‚Äù  Awards  Winner of 2016 Section on the Sociology of Emotions Outstanding Recent Contribution (Book) Award at the American Sociology Association. 2016 Finalist at the Harlem Book Fair/ Phyllis Wheatley First Non-Fiction Book Award 2017 Charles Horton Cooley Award for Recent Book, Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction  References  History books about Brazil Racism in Brazil Sociology books Sexism in Brazil Family sociologists Books about Brazil ","title":"The Color of Love (book)"},{"id":"56394111","text":"Ed Bussey is an internet entrepreneur who has been named in the 2015 and 2016 Sunday Times list of Debretts‚Äô 500 most influential people in Britain..He is currently the founder and CEO of Quill.

Twine investigated racism under the idea of racial democracy while using a small town Vasalia (renamed for the research), Rio de Janeiro as her research site in January 1992 and February 1994 as two separate periods. The book revealed the idealization of racial democracy in Brazil with the reality of daily racism for Afro-Brazilians, and some Afro- Brazilians‚Äô unawareness and avoidance of racism.  Synopsis  Racism in a Racial Democracy: The Maintenance of White Supremacy in Brazil by France Winddance Twine explores the racism in Brazil from a sociological perspective. Even though Brazil nowadays stresses racial democracy, which claimed that every race has equal opportunities, Afro-Brazilians are still experiencing racism in their daily life. Twine researched in Vasalia (renamed the town), Rio de Janeiro to investigate the community dynamics between Afro-Brazilians and other non-Afro-Brazilians in the community, and she found a huge difference between them on perception of races and miscegenation, socioeconomic status, politics and social life. Twine interviewed Afro- Brazilians in the community about their perception of racism, their physical appearance and their family history. While interacting with Afro-Brazilians, Twine also interviewed some Euro-Brazilians and mixed race Brazilians on their perception on Afro-Brazilians, racism, perspectives on relationships and marriage. Chapter one started with the community practices of racism based on white supremacist theories and structures. Chapter two traced the history of Vasalia and the according political and economic development, when Portuguese and Italian immigrants were the coffee plantation owners and Afro-Brazilians were the slaves. Chapter three focused on the accountability of racism by interviewing Afro-Brazilians on their perception of racism, and many Afro- Brazilians answered with the nonexistence of racism. Chapter four explored the concept of racial democracy in Vasalia and the practices of white supremacy under the concept. Chapter five analyzed miscegenation and whitening issues among Vasalians while many Afro-Brazilians, and many Afro-Brazilians embraced whiteness. Chapter six explored Vasalians‚Äô perception on relation to African descent and their family history on slavery. In chapter seven, Twine interviewed Afro-Brazilians professionals on their interpretation of racism.  Critical Reception = Peter Wade's Book Review = Review by Peter Wade in the Journal of Latin American Studies 30 (1998): 668-670. Wade thinks the book Racism in a Racial Democracy was powerful because it addresses the problem of racism in Brazil under the ideology of racial equality. Wade commented that Twine gave representative everyday racism which was compelling and detailed. Twine also had the risk of falsely associating racial equality with racism. The book effectively reveals the problem that Brazilians deny the existence of racism with the premises of Brazil is a mixed race country and socioeconomic status was the main element that sets differences. Twine has successfully addressed racism as a problem in the Brazilian society when it was still a taboo. Twine made effective communications with the Afro- Brazilians through her interview questions, as she revealed Afro-Brazilians' perception in the community and their thoughts on racism. Twine tended to understand racism in Brazil from an American point of view, and showed Vasalians' false perceptions and unawareness of racism. Wade would like to hear more comments about the town of Vasalia in a bigger picture, and its comparison with Bahia, where the majority of the population was Afro- Brazilians. = Evandro Camara's Book Review = Review by Evandro Camara in the American Journal of Sociology 104 (1998): 911-913. Camara reviewed Twine's Racism in a Racial Democracy and impressed by how Twine addressed racism and white supremacy in the book, which raised readers' awareness. However, Camara thought that the work displayed \\"the familiar sins of the revisionist scholarship.\\" White supremacy was not only a problem exist in Brazil, but it generally exists in the Western society. Camara suggested that Twine should go on to identify particular aspects of the race problem across Brazil instead of narrowing in Vasalia, Rio de Janeiro. While the book was addressing the problem of racism under white supremacy, Twine also portrayed a dual society in Brazil, which is made up of whites and non-whites with the ideology of whitening into one entity. Camara also thought that the book should not simply generalize all the social problems into racism, as some might be related to socioeconomic status. From Camara's perspective, Brazil from the book would be just a country that resembles the US. = Bonilla-Silva's Book Review = Review by Eduardo Bonilla-Silva NACLA Report on the Americas vol. 35 issue 6 (May/Jun2002): 60. Racial problems brought attention to scholars, as in Latin America they stressed about their identity as a whole picture. Bonilla-Silva complimented that the book was an advancement on the literature on race in Latin America. Bonilla-Silva thought that Twine had successfully addressed the race issues in Brazil, as Brazil portrayed an ideal image of race equality and inequalities were led by class differences. Twine had effectively provided how Afro-Brazilians thought about race in their daily life, which offered an insight of the problem on racism in a racial democracy background. Bonila- Silva thought that the book lacked a theory on stratification in Brazil. Bonilla-Silva recommended people to read the book as the book would be a powerful source of information to look deeply into Latin America's racial inequalities.

History=Pretext for founding= Following the 1950s city demolition of Black Bottom and Paradise Valley for highway construction, the residents of Detroit increased the presence of the Black Power Movement, and the Civil Rights Movement, throughout the 1960s. By 1967, Pastor Albert Cleage, founder of the Central United Church of Christ, later named the Shrines of the Black Madonna of the Pan-African Orthodox Christian Church, founded the Black Star Market, the first black communal cooperative business. The co-op closed within two years, but started forming the framework for much of DBCFSN's work. Mayor Coleman Young of Detroit developed and implemented the Farm-A-Lot program in 1975 to encourage urban agriculture in the city, but the impact of this effort faded at the turn of the century. Outside and foreign investors, white flight, and the collapse of the automobile industry have made it difficult for local Detroit residents to own land, a reflection of the trend since 1910 of African American land ownership.White, M.

Classified as a food desert, 80% of Detroit residents rely on \\"fringe food\\" provided by fast food chains, liquor stores, and corner stores. To address food insecurity, the city of Detroit has launched the Detroit Agricultural Network (DAN) in 1997, and the Garden Resource Program in 2004, later named Keep Detroit Growing in 2013. The Detroit Food and Fitness Collaborative is an overarching group of 40 organizations, including Keep Growing Detroit and the Detroit Food Justice Task Force. The organizations work to ensure that children and families have access to healthy, locally-grown food, and they work to promote healthier life styles. The city is also one of nine communities across the country to receive assistance from the W.K. Kellogg Foundation in efforts to promote community involvement and growth in ensuring lifestyles of health and fitness. The W.K. Kellogg Foundation promotes the idea that all children should have equal opportunity to live and thrive, focusing on communities where children and families are vulnerable. Communities within Detroit utilize these efforts along with several other organizations to address the growing issue of poverty, and to spread awareness of the impacts that these social issues can pose. =Founding= In 2000, Malik Yakini, principal of Nsoroma Institute Public School Academy charter school, worked with staff, parents and supporters (including Anan Lololi of the Afr-Can FoodBasket from Toronto) to implement organic gardening and to develop a food security curriculum.Wallace, H.

The founding meeting of DBCFSN occurred in 2006 when Yakini assembled a group of 40 community members strongly connected to food at the Black Star Community Bookstore. This would have not been possible without the organizations effect in influencing public policy. People such as JoAnne Watson and council man Kwame Kenyatta were crucial characters in connecting this cause to the people within the Detroit City Council who eventually approved the food security policy. The specific policy in which DBCFSN is particularly concerned is \\"the Right to Farm act.\\" This states no higher power has authority to create laws and regulate agriculture in their area. This is an important case for DBCFS because they need to refrain from breaking any laws and regulations while carrying out the mission to develop healthy urban agricultural systems. The group discussed the need for black community involvement in urban agriculture, as well as food justice, security and sovereignty. The newfound Detroit Black Community Food Security Network began gardening on a quarter-acre plot of land in Detroit's east side, quickly moving to a half-acre plot in Detroit's westside. In 2008, DBCFSN secured a long-term lease on seven acres of property in Rouge Park, establishing D-Town Farm as the city's largest community run farm. Currently, DBCFSN operates the D-Town Farm, The Food Warriors Youth Development Program (under the leadership of Education and Outreach Director Hanifa Adjuman) and is opening the Detroit People's Food Cooperative in 2019.

This board determine the organizational policies of DBCFSN and appoints the Executive Director. Nikolette Barnes is also on the staff of Keep Growing Detroit, an organization that promotes the growth and production of urban gardening throughout Detroit. The organization works closely with efforts similar to those of the DBCFSN, urging community members to think proactively about the sources of their food, and encouraging the support of local gardening efforts. Similar to the DBSFSN, Keep Growing Detroit also includes educational efforts, such as youth programs, which aim to provide more information about food sovereignty to the community. The organizations work simultaneously towards the same goal, which is to increase efforts of community engagement combating food insecurity. =Membership information= There are three levels of membership in DBCFSN: an individual membership which is $10 in annual dues, a family membership which is $25, and an organizational membership which costs $120. All of the money supports DBCFSN's community work, and members are eligible for D-Town farm produce discounts.

Attack Shortly after 9:00am local time on 24 January 2018, a suicide bomber in a car detonated his explosives at the front of the Save the Children compound. The blast was followed up by at least four armed militants attempting to storm the building, according to witnesses some of the attackers were wearing Afghan police uniforms. A firefight broke out between Afghan security forces and the attackers that lasted more than eight hours. 45 people in the compound had to be rescued by commandos. All the attackers were killed and six civilians, including three Save the Children employees, were killed with at least 27 people, including three Afghan troops, injured. Responsibility The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. ISIL claimed responsibility, saying it was targeting Western institutions. In the aftermath of the attack, Save the Children suspended its operations in Afghanistan.

Peacock and John Zeigler, Jr. John Asbury Zeigler, Jr. (February 5, 1912 ‚Äì October 2, 2015) was the owner of the Book Basement in Charleston with his longtime partner Edwin D. Peacock. Biography John Asbury Zeigler, Jr. was born on February 5, 1912. Originally from Manning, South Carolina, he attended high school in Florence. He attended the Citadel where he founded the literary magazine The Shako and participated in the playwright competition of the Dock Street Theatre. In 1940, he met his longtime partner Edwin Peacock on the Isle of Palms. During World War II, Zeigler served as a radioman. His time in the Navy inspired him to write poems about his experiences at sea and his time living in Yakutat Bay, Alaska. In one such experience, he was on a ship carrying the American flag erected at the end of the battle of Iwo Jima, even steering the ship at one time during the battle when there were too many unused radiomen. Back home from the war, in 1946 Zeigler and Peacock opened a bookshop \\"The Book Basement\\", in Charleston, on the ground floor of 9 College Way, Zeigler's family home. The Book Basement became a leading independent bookstore, the meeting place for various civil rights groups. Gay men passing through Charleston knew to visit the bookshop, including Maurice Sendak and Langston Hughes, who became friends of the owners. A drawing of the building by Prentiss Taylor was used on advertising events for the store for many years. Harlan Greene, a friend of Zeigler since the 1970s, said the bookstore was an \\"oasis [...] open to all\\". They closed the bookstore in 1971 and the College of Charleston bought the building. Today a plaque in front of the building remembers Peacock and Zeigler. Zeigler and Peacock were serving members of the Charleston chapter of the NAACP.John Zeigler in the Book Basement, June 1948 Zeigler was a member of the Poetry Society of South Carolina and published a cycle of memorial poems on their relationship, The Edwin Poems. Zeigler appeared with a nickname in Jeb and Dash: A Diary of Gay Life 1918-1945, the diaries recounting the life of C.C. Dasham and Jeb Alexander.Ina, Russell (1994).

It does not use the traditional Price Comparison Website (PCW) model adopted by comparison sites such as Moneysupermarket.com and search engines such as Google Shopping where retailers pay to list their products for sale. Since its inception, it has listed products from online retailers, without charging a listing fee or commission for sales. Product search results are consequently unaffected by a retailer's marketing budget or lack thereof. Shoppers are able to use the vertical search engine as a price-checking tool, to see whether the goods they find 'on sale' elsewhere are genuinely a good deal.  History  Pricesearcher began as a small, self-funded project by Samuel Dean in 2011, with the aim of indexing all products available to buy online to give shoppers a clear picture. Dean used Peopleperhour in the early days to find freelancers to work on the initial project. Then in 2014, he recruited Raja Akhtar, a PHP specialist, and the two worked together in their spare time. Akhtar is now Head of Web Development at Pricesearcher. In 2015, they recruited a freelance DevOps engineer, Vlassios Rizopoulos, to help speed up the product indexing process. In 2017, Rizopoulos became Pricesearcher's Chief Technology Officer. Their goal was to list a searched-for item in one view, from retailers, marketplaces, classified advertising sites, brands and shopping comparison sites. As the product index increased, funding was sought. In 2016, Pricesearcher was launched and received its first outside seed funding from private investors. Retailers who joined the Pricesearcher search engine in their first year were Amazon, Argos, IKEA, Mothercare, Currys, PC World, Dreams (bed retailer), Wilko, King of Shaves, JD Sports. Many more have joined since. In September 2018, Pricesearcher was selected to join the London Stock Exchange's capital-raising programme. In October 2018, former Amazon UK Head of Pricing Weldon W. Whitener joined Pricesearcher as Chief Analytics officer. In January 2019, Pricesearcher becomes a Google CSS Partner (Comparison Shopping Services) In March 2019, Pi Datametrics and Pricesearcher Launched a Joint product for digital retailers \\"The first ever combining of organic search data and online product price data in a single report, PricePoint allows retailers to highlight where the winning pricing opportunities exist online, alongside organic visibility.\\" Pricesearcher enters a new partnership with latestdeals.co.uk where their technology is powering product search and product comparison for their consumers. Latestdeals.co.uk is a uk website dedicated to the promotion of deals, vouchers, and freebies. Pricesearcher went into Administration and on the 12th March 2020 Appointed Quantuma LLP On the 20th March, Founder Samuel Dean and Jack Sundt formed a new business, Pricesearcher Technology Group Ltd  Technology  Pricesearcher uses PriceBot, its custom web crawler, to search the web for prices, and it allows direct product feeds from retailers at no cost. The search engine's rapid growth has been attributed to its enabling technology: a retailer can upload their product feed in any format, without the need for further development. Pricesearcher processes 1.5 billion prices every day and uses Amazon Web Services (AWS), to which it migrated in December 2016, to enable the high volume of data processing required. The rest of the business uses algorithms, NLP, Machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence to organise all the data. As of February 2018, Pricesearcher is processing 2,500 UK retailers through PriceBot. A further 4,000 retailers are using product feeds to submit product information to the search engine.  Web crawler  Like Google's web crawler, GoogleBot, PriceBot identifies online retailers and crawls their websites looking for products that are being sold. Retailers can submit their own websites for crawling by PriceBot.  Business model  Pricesearcher is free to use for both shoppers and retailers. It operates like Google and indeed.com as a free-to-list search engine. Future revenue will come from an Adwords-type advertising model; the most traditional advertising model for search engines  Research  Data collected by Pricesearcher was presented at the Brighton SEO Conference in a presentation: \\"What we have learnt from indexing over half a billion products\\". Using the first 500 million products, Pricesearcher found that the average length of a product title was 48 characters (including spaces). Product descriptions averaged 522 characters, or 90 words. 44.9% included shipping costs. 40.2% did not provide dimensions such as size and colour. Their research shows that many retailers could improve their product listings by using brand terms as product keywords, using GTINs and putting product attributes in separate fields. Between December 2016 and September 2017, Pricesearcher recorded 4 billion price changes globally. The country with the most price changes was the UK ‚Äì one every six days.

He was called to the Bar of the Inner Temple in 1947. Marshall was awarded a doctorate from University College, London (UCL) in 1948. He taught law at UCL, and in 1956 he obtained a chair in law at the University of Sheffield.

The author writes about the Vargas Era of Brazilian history with a focus on Vargas' life, his political history, Brazilian political atmosphere and a critique of the Revolution being ‚Äúincomplete.‚Äù Vargas‚Äôs daughter, Alzira, is also credited with helping provide information to Levine for the content of the book. Synopsis  The book covers the origins of Vargas, including his family history, until his death in 1954. It also includes how society and various political actors felt about the ‚ÄúEstado Novo‚Äù period including the accounts on the Integralists and Communists. The detailed history provided in the first four chapters that primarily refer to Vargas and his policies. Vargas‚Äôs policies included but not limited to, worker empowerment programs, political reforms, that often involve censorship, and giving women the right to vote in 1937. The Vargas dictatorship according to Robert M Levine, had \\"populist\\" elements in addition to being very totalitarian. Vargas promoted a nationalist economic policy with his dictatorship. These economic reforms aided in industrializing Brazil and provided clarity to the working class. Workers received education, health, and dental care for the first time. The censorship of political parties played a role in characterizing the Vargas Period. Vargas' former political allies, the Integralists, tried to influence Vargas policies and were perceived as a threat by the government. With the parties censored, he and his loyalist cabinet were able to accomplish many tasks and strengthened the domestic affairs of the state. The final chapters of the book cover the legacy and a critique of the ‚ÄúEstado Novo‚Äù dictatorship and Vargas‚Äô character. One of the primary observations made by Robert was the politics Vargas was in, drove him to suicide in 1954. With the threat of military coup at any point, it caused anxiety in Vargas. The army had a history of rebelling against the government and attempted to overthrow the Old Republic at various times. Finally, the last section of the book is a detailed timeline, information on sources and a picture gallery of the Estado Novo era. The Chronology section includes dates and times that are considered important to understanding the Vargas regime until its collapse.  Critical reception  Review by Peter M.

N. Dyer and first published in the April 1991 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction. The story was nominated for the 1992 Nebula Award for Best Novella. It has since been reprinted in various anthologies. Synopsis The story follows Dr. Watson, a female hospitalist, over a day in an urban medical center. John Doe #3, an unnamed victim of drug violence, arrives brain dead where Watson, Tom, her medical student, and the rest of her medical team inspect the comatose body. The team determines that the body must be kept on a ventilator until the next of kin can be contacted. In the meantime a transplant surgeon suggests that they should harvest the body‚Äôs organs before contacting the family. Soon, another patient arrives, left paraplegic from another incident of gang violence. The patient warns that the opposing gang will be coming into the hospital to get him. A family member of John Doe #3 has been contacted and they refuse to allow the organs to be donated. Soon after, John Doe #3 dies from complications and the surgeon berates Tom. The situation overwhelms Tom causing him to feel guilty for the patient‚Äôs death. Dr. Watson realizes Tom is about to make a foolish decision and follows him down into the depths of the hospital cellars to stop him from entering a door labelled ‚ÄúThe July Ward.‚Äù She insists John Doe #3's death was not his fault and that the surgeon was overly accusatory. Watson tells Tom about her own mistake and the patient who died because she failed to recognize a case of rhabdomyolysis. Tom and Dr. Watson return to the hospital floors. Two gunmen soon arrive to assassinate the paraplegic patient and throw the hospital into havoc. Dr. Watson escapes the ward and the two men follow her back into the hospital's underground floors. They chase her through rooms with preserved body parts and specimens until she turns and enters the door labelled ‚ÄúThe July Ward.‚Äù In this ghostly ward, orderlies attend to neat and clean rows of patients in beds. Dr. Watson stops to visit the first patient she killed, apologizes once more, then compliments healthcare workers. The two gunmen are apprehended by the ghost staff and Dr. Watson recalls that ‚Äúonly two kinds of people may enter the July Ward‚Äî doctors, and the dead. And only the doctors may leave.‚Äù Themes ‚ÄúThe July Ward‚Äù draws on traditional Gothic imagery that \\"mixes medical technology with the classic ghost story.\\" The title is a reference to the July effect, a controversial observation that most hospital observe a spike in patient deaths when newly graduated physicians begin their residency.

These Persians had been garrisoned in Sanaa and its surrounding after the Sasanian reconquest of Yemen in the 570s. Their leaders converted to Islam and were active in the early Islamic conflicts. They were gradually absorbed into the local population. Name According to a commentary on a poem by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani in Kitab al-Aghani, up to his time (10th century), these people were called ban≈´ al-a·∏•rƒÅr (, literally \\"sons of the free people\\") in Sanaa and al-abnƒÅ æ () in Yemen. They were called \\"Sons of the free people\\" because it was narrated that in ancient times a strong storm hit Yemen and revealed a stone inscription that says, \\"who rules Dhamar? Himyar the Good. Who rules Dhamar? The evil Abyssinians. Who rules Dhamar? The free Persians\\". A similar stone inscription was said to have been found under Ka'aba in pre- Islamic times. History What is known about their history is mostly about their early (Persian conquest of Yemen) and their late history (during the rise of Islam). It is uncertain whether they kept practicing Zoroastrianism, or had been influenced by the South Arabian paganism and the local Christianity. According to al-Tabari, Kharrah/Khurrah Khosraw (), the fourth Sasanian governor of Yemen, was replaced by Badhan () due to too much assimilation of the former to the local society. The authority of the Persian governors of Yemen was reduced during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian War of 602‚Äì628. This coincided with the rise of Islam. The Persian leaders in Yemen, including Badhan, Fayruz al-Daylami, and Wahb ibn Munabbih, responded favorably to the diplomatic missions from Muhammad, and converted to Islam in 631. After Badhan's death, his son Shahr () partially replaces his father as governor, but is killed by the rebellious Al-Aswad Al-Ansi, who claimed prophet-hood, in the First Ridda War. Al-Aswad was later killed by Fayruz al-Daylami, who became the governor of Yemen. After that, Ghayth ibn Abd Yaghuth rebels, this time against al-abna' themselves, seeking their expulsion from the Arabian Peninsula. DƒÅdawayh (), an al-abna' leader, was killed, while Fayruz al- Daylami and Jushnas (Gushnasp) managed to flee with their allies, and later defeated Ghayth ibn Abd Yaghuth. Fayruz al-Daylami and the abna' were later active in the fertile crescent and Yemen under Caliph Umar during the Second Ridda War. The abna' retained their distinct identity during the Islamic period. Their nisba was al-AbnƒÅwƒ´ (). These people were gradually absorbed into the local population and thus disappeared from records. Descendants of al-Abna' live in the al-Furs village in Wadi Rijam, al-Abna' village in Wadi al-Sir in Bani Hushish District and in Khulan al-Tyal, Bayt Baws and Bani Bahlul.ŸÖÿπÿ¨ŸÖ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸÑÿØÿßŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÇÿ®ÿßÿ¶ŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸäŸÖŸÜŸäÿ©ÿå ÿßÿ®ÿ±ÿßŸáŸäŸÖ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÇÿ≠ŸÅŸäÿå ÿµ Ÿ°Ÿ® This title \\"al-abna'\\" may have been the root of the title \\"al-abna'\\" used to refer to the influential Persians of Baghdad in Abbasid period.

British Army Independent Companies of Foot were first established in North America in 1664. The first independent company in South Carolina was organized in 1721. With the raising of Oglethorpe's Regiment in 1737 it was disbanded. In 1746 three understrength independent companies were sent to South Carolina, but they were disbanded three years later. When Oglethorpe's Regiment was disbanded the same year, three new independent companies were raised in South Carolina, partly recruited with soldiers from the disbanded regiment. These three companies participated in the French and Indian War and the Cherokee War, participating in the Battle of Fort Necessity, the Braddock Expedition, the battle of the Monongahela, and the siege of Fort Loudoun. They were disbanded in 1763, with the rest of the British army independent companies in North America. Background Independent companies are military units not belonging to a regimental organization. In England, independent garrison companies existed since the end of the 15th century. The first three English independent companies in North America arrived in Boston in 1664, and were used to conquer the Dutch colony of New Netherland. During the French and Indian Wars, independent garrison companies were stationed not only in the New York Colony, but also in Massachusetts Bay, Virginia, and South Carolina. In 1740, the four independent companies of New York were the only in the Thirteen Colonies, but after the disbandment of Oglethorpe's Regiment in 1748 three new independent companies were raised for service in South Carolina. The four companies in New York and the three companies in South Carolina were the independent companies that served during the French and Indian War.Army List 1740, p. 57.Army List 1756, p. 88.Foote 1966, pp. 6-7, 151, 314.Brumwell 2002, p. 13.Lee Offen, The British Military Presence in America, 1660-1720. Retrieved 2018-01-23. Standing in the community The independent companies were recruited in Britain and the soldiers rarely, if ever, returned to the old country after having left the service. The British Army was largely recruited among the poor and the criminal classes; yet, the independent companies had lower status. Their ranks were often filled with people who had left the regular service; former soldiers mainly, but also deserters. The officers were often promoted non-commissioned officers. As the independent companies were virtually ignored by the military authorities in Britain they became dependent on the local American communities, often relying on them for food, clothing, and housing. Soon they became rooted in the local society; transforming the military service into a sideline of a civilian occupation.Fortescue 1899, pp. 43-45.Guy 1994, p. 97. South Carolina 1721‚Äì1737 Facing an expected Spanish threat, the province of South Carolina in 1719 requested military aid from the motherland. The British government drafted men from all garrison companies in Britain, thereby managing to create an independent company of 100 men, which was sent to South Carolina in 1721. The company was used to garrison Fort King George, previously built and garrisoned by provincial scouts, until a fire in 1727 destroyed the fort, when the company was moved to Port Royal. In 1730 part of the company was transferred to St. Simons Island, Georgia where they built and garrisoned Fort Delegal. When the raising of Oglethorpe's Regiment was authorized in 1737, the South Carolina independent company ceased to exist, forming the nucleus of the new regiment.Jones 1878, p. 63.Foote 1966, pp. 301-304, 309-310.Ivers 2015, p. 333. South Carolina 1746‚Äì1749 During King George's War, South Carolina was not content with being protected by troops based in Georgia, and asked the government in London for troops stationed in the colony. In 1746 three understrength independent companies were sent to South Carolina, their 60 officers and other ranks forming a core for enlargement; the missing men to be recruited in Charleston and Virginia. After the end of the war, the companies were disbanded together with Oglethorpe's Regiment. Three new independent companies would be recruited, however, to serve in South Carolina. The discharged soldiers could enlist in the new companies, return to England, or remain in Georgia.Foote 1966, p. 314.Cashin 2009, pp. 79-80. South Carolina 1749‚Äì1763 In the preludes to the French and Indian War, Lieutenant Colonel George Washington had been ordered to remove the French from Fort Duquesne. In addition to the 300 men from his own provincial Virginia Regiment, an independent company from South Carolina was sent under the command of Captain James Mackay to his aid; ultimately suffering defeat and surrender with Washington at the Battle of Fort Necessity. Captain Mackay, being an officer with the King's commission, refused to obey Washington's orders, as coming from a provincial officer. Washington left Mackay and his company at Fort Necessity when initially moving forward towards Fort Duquesne, since the captain refused to let his men work on the road Washington was making through the woods, without extra pay. At the battle, however, they fought with fervor, suffering greater losses than the Virginians.McCabe 1876, pp. 42-43.O'Meara 1979, p. 105.Washington 2004, pp. 36, 139. Later, the company, now under Captain Paul Demere, participated in Braddock's Expedition, again suffering a defeat, now at the battle of the Monongahela. When inspected, it was found to be in much better military order than the two independent companies from New York also joining the expedition. At the battle they formed the rearguard together with a provincial company of Virginia rangers. During the expedition's confused retreat, the steadfastness and fighting spirit of these two companies saved the remnants of the army from being surrounded and totally annihilated.Preston 2015, pp. 40, 244, 251, 259-260. A second South Carolina independent company, under Captain Raymond Demere participated in the construction of Fort Loudon on the Tennessee River in 1756, built on the request of the Cherokees in the Overhill Cherokee country. The fort was then garrisoned by the company, with Captain Demere as its commandant. In 1757, the command was transferred to Captain Paul Demere.Wood & Bullard 1996, p. 76. The beginning of the Cherokee War saw South Carolina Independent Companies in garrison at Charleston, Fort Prince George, and Fort Loudon. Soon hostile Cherokees invested both forts. Fort Loudon had to surrender in 1760; all the officers except one being killed after the surrender, the men becoming Cherokee hostages. After the war, the prisoners were ransomed and released. Fort Prince George held out until finally relieved in 1761.Arthur 1996, pp. 568-570.Anderson 2000, p. 459-463.Corkran 2016, pp. 10, 195-196. Disbandment In 1763, all the independent companies in British North America were disbanded as a matter of policy; being replaced by regular British army regiments permanently stationed in America.Foote 1966, p. 323.

Through 3sat the show could also be seen in Germany and Switzerland. Measured by market share Wir sind Kaiser was the most successful self-produced weekly broadcast production on ORF 1 between 2007 and 2010. Since the end of 2010, new special episodes are broadcast on a quarterly basis.  Concept  Emperor Robert Heinrich and his steward Seyffenstein on their way to the Austrian Parliament in 2008 The show is a political satire in which the Austrian people have become so disappointed with the politics of their country after decades that they decided to restore the Austrian monarchy. There, Robert Palfrader plays \\"Emperor Robert Heinrich\\" based on the Emperors of Austria. His duty is to bring imperial glory back to the depressed nation. Emperor Robert Heinrich always uses the majestic plural when speaking of himself and also addresses others in the third person singular (\\"he shall goes there ...\\", \\"what is she doing there?\\"). He is supported by his grand steward Seyffenstein (Rudolf Roubinek, who is also the main author of the program together with Klaus Oppitz) and the servant Vorm√§rz (FM4 presenter Rudi Sch√∂llerbacher). In the later broadcasts also a second servant named Biedermeier (Florian Perger) appears. There is also the emperor's playmate (Karin Chvatal). Both servants and the playmate however do not speak normally. The broadcasts are recorded in front of a live audience in the Great Hall in the House of Industry at Schwarzenbergplatz in Vienna. At the opening of the public 40 minutes long \\"audience\\" of the emperor, the \\"Emperor's Anthem\\" is sung to the tune of The Internationale but with a text that praised the emperor to lead the beautiful country out from bad times. Afterwards, Seyffenstein reads the post to the emperor. These are usually petitions to the emperor from national and international personalities. Subsequently, \\"His Majesty\\" receives guests which are mostly Austrian celebrities and politicians, sometimes also Germans. In his audience he solves political conflicts and shows records of his daily life as a beloved head of state. His actions are mostly faked and in reality they are carried out by his dutiful servant Vorm√§rz. Robert Heinrich I often shows great concern for his country during the show. However his guests are often treated in a provocative manner and even disdain. In addition, most Austropop artists performed in the program for musical entertainment, such as Zweitfrau and Excuse Me Moses. A running gag was the weekly appearance of the entrepreneur Richard Lugner, who always appeared in a different disguise or pretended to be someone else and asked for an audience, but was always refused. Only in the episode of January 3, 2008 was he finally allowed to enter the audience chamber. Another running gag is the gifts of the guests to His Majesty, which are usually snow globes with penguins, which the emperor regularly passes Vorm√§rz for the special tray. In the end the emperor always offers the departing words to his guests: \\"S/he may retire, but s/he must also be a bit obedient!\\"  Reception  The show ran successfully with top ratings up to 28% market share and is thus considered one of the most successful programs since the 2007 program reform. The last episode of the first season of January 17, 2008 reached 462,000 viewers (24% market share). Record rates reached the edition of 4 December 2008 with 603,000 viewers (27% market share). The highest market share was achieved on September 24, 2009 at 30%. The show was critically acclaimed. Palfrader received in 2008 the Romy TV award for his role as the emperor. The show received in 2017 the Viewers Choice Award of the Austrian Cabaret Price.https://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_20171121_OTS0139/oesterreichischer- kabarettpreis-wir-sind-kaiser-erhaelt-publikumspreis  References  External links  * https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1296328/ * https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXH_wpbIm-uY6CP-9KUKkBg Official YouTube channel Austrian television shows Television sketch shows Television talk shows ","title":"Wir sind Kaiser"},{"id":"56394794","text":"Ernesto A.

To date, his disappearance remains unsolved and the investigation has not determined with absolute certainty whether he ran away voluntarily, was involved in a hit and run, or was abducted and/or murdered.  Biography  Lucas Tronche was born on 18 April 1999 and is the youngest of three brothers. His parents, Nathalie and √âric, are both engineers with the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission at the Marcoule Nuclear Site. Lucas's family and friends describe him as a balanced, rounded, happy, kind and helpful teenager who loves animals and nature and does not like disappointing others. He is described as an ordinary 15-year-old boy with no personal or family issues. He was in his first year of the three-year French high school system at the Lyc√©e Albert Einstein in Bagnols-sur-C√®ze. According to teachers, he was a good student and wanted to become a vet. He was introverted, sociable, and passionate about scouting, having been a member of his local scout troop for several years. He was also in badminton and swimming clubs. He rarely used social media but was often on Snapchat. At the time of his disappearance, he and his family were planning a trip to the United States.  Disappearance  At 5.10 pm on Wednesday 18 March 2015, Lucas had planned to go on his kick scooter to a bus stop, where he would take a coach to the public swimming pool in Laudun-l‚ÄôArdoise for swimming practice with his 17-year-old brother, Valentin. Valentin left before Lucas, expecting Lucas to join him at the bus stop. Lucas left the family home and locked the door but did not turn up at the bus stop. Valentin attempted to contact Lucas at around 5.30 pm, but Lucas's mobile phone was switched off. Technical analysis would later reveal that Lucas's phone was turned off at 5.14 pm, a few minutes before he left the house. Lucas left without his swimming gear, but did leave with a rucksack containing very few items. He did not take any money, a sleeping bag or a knife with him ‚Äì items that, as a keen scout with a good knowledge of outdoor survival, he would have known to take if he had been planning to leave home. His intentions after leaving the house remain unknown. At around 8 pm, Nathalie Tronche went to the bus stop to pick up Valentin and Lucas. Valentin told his mother that Lucas had not come to the swimming pool; Valentin assumed that Lucas had missed the bus and had stayed at home. Nathalie had been at home for the last two hours, so she knew that Lucas was not there. Nathalie contacted A&E; to see if Lucas might have been in an accident and gone to hospital. She then contacted Lucas's friends, none of whom knew of his whereabouts. Following that, she contacted the police, who opened a missing persons investigation. √âric Tronche was informed of his son's disappearance when he returned home from work at around 11 pm.  Investigation  The police opened an enqu√™te pour disparition inqui√©tante (investigation into a concerning disappearance) in the evening of 18 March 2015, immediately after being contacted by Nathalie Tronche. On 25 March, the investigation was handed over to the Montpellier Regional Judicial Police Service (SRPJ) and the Office central pour la repression des violences aux personnes (Central agency for eliminating violence against persons, OCRVP). Lucas did not fit the profile of a runaway, and on 30 March, the prosecutor's office in N√Æmes opened a judicial investigation into abduction and illegal confinement. Due to Lucas's profile and the lack of supporting evidence, some theories were dismissed, such as suicide and fleeing to the Middle East to fight either for or against the Islamic State. The police interviewed Lucas's friends, teachers, sports coaches and teammates on multiple occasions, as well as drivers who had passed through Bagnols-sur-C√®ze on the day of his disappearance. A formal judicial request was submitted to the United States authorities to access Lucas's conversations and exchanges on Snapchat, which are deleted from the app after a few seconds but remain on Snapchat's servers. The request was granted but the Snapchat activities did not reveal anything of assistance to the investigation. Lucas's computer and tablet were seized and searched, but nothing of any interest was found. Several witnesses reported seeing a person who may have been Lucas a few hours after his disappearance. A neighbour claimed to have seen Lucas between 5.15 and 5.30 pm on the day of his disappearance, heading down the chemin de Saduran towards the vineyards, in the opposite direction to the swimming pool. 500 metres from that point, another woman reported that at midday on Thursday 19 March, she saw someone who may have been Lucas, crossing a yard in front of her farm. A dog followed the person's scent northwards for 1 kilometre. Also on 19 March, at 6.30 pm, Rachid Ghamri, a Tronche family friend, was out searching with volunteers when he spotted the distant silhouette of a person with a youthful appearance standing at the top of a hill. Ghamri took a photograph, but due to the fact that it was dusk, the photograph was unclear and the person could not be identified. Another team of volunteers later claimed to have seen Lucas in the hills above Saint-Gervais at 10.30 am on Monday 23 March. The person believed to be Lucas was seen watching vineyard workers before disappearing into the woods. A week after the disappearance, a 25-year-old motorcyclist passing through a neighbouring village reported seeing Lucas in the late afternoon of 23 March. The boy was walking with a rucksack along a track towards Esbrezun, a hamlet in the commune of Saint-Andr√©-de-Roquepertuis, heading towards a hill. The area was searched by dogs and a helicopter. In a final sighting, a teenage boy and his father reported seeing Lucas on the afternoon of Saturday 28 March in a Cultura shop in Le Pontet, in the Vaucluse d√©partement. He was allegedly accompanied by a woman aged 45 to 50. Investigations into this lead proved fruitless. A few days after Lucas's disappearance, investigators used Luminol ‚Äì a product that reacts to the presence of blood ‚Äì to look for potential traces of DNA from Lucas's bedroom and the rest of the house. Some traces of blood were found on the carpet by his bed and were examined to ascertain whether they were blood or simply the Luminol reacting to a household cleaning product. New tests were carried out in May 2017. No results of either test have been released publicly. In October 2015, seven months after Lucas's disappearance, his parents started receiving strange anonymous letters, informing them that Lucas was in good health and they had no need to worry. A total of eleven letters were sent until the start of summer 2016, when investigators managed to identify the sender thanks to a CCTV camera at the sorting office where one of the letters was posted on 12 July 2016. However, it turned out that the sender was a 57-year-old mythomaniac from Valence who had nothing to do with Lucas's disappearance. In October 2017, he was sentenced by a court in N√Æmes to one year's imprisonment, with a further year suspended. In December 2016, France's National Police released a composite sketch in an attempt to locate a witness seen by a passer-by near Lucas's home on the day of his disappearance. The sketch was modified and made more precise in September 2017. On 1 March 2016, almost a year after Lucas's disappearance, in Clarensac, a village 62 km (38 miles) from Bagnols-sur-C√®ze, 16-year-old Antoine Zoia disappeared after leaving his home at around 1.30 pm. Antoine was a second-year high school student majoring in Science at the Lyc√©e Albert Camus in N√Æmes and his personality was considered similar to Lucas's. Antoine was last seen buying a packet of cigarettes from a tobacconist's shop. An investigation was launched to establish whether there could be a link between these two disappearances of teenage boys with similar characteristics from nearby locations in under a year. However, on 2 October 2018, Antoine's skeletonised body was found hanging in a remote wooded area near Clarensac; no foul play was involved in his death. On 11 January 2018, investigators began examining whether Nordahl Lelandais, the main suspect in the August 2017 disappearance of Ma√´lys de Araujo, could be linked to both disappearances. Lelandais has regularly been in the Gard and has relatives near Bagnols-sur- C√®ze. On 27 February 2018, he was cleared as a suspect in Lucas's disappearance after analysis of his mobile phone placed him more than 100 miles (160 km) away on the day in question. On 18 October 2018, the witness seen near the bus stop on the day of Lucas's disappearance was located and taken in for questioning, but police said that there was nothing linking him to the disappearance.  Initiatives and search efforts  Lucas's disappearance prompted a national outpouring of emotion and many searches were undertaken by the authorities, Lucas's family, and many private citizens who did not know the family. As early as the day after the disappearance, soldiers patrolled the surrounding areas and organised numerous searches. Hills, cliffs and paths were searched in a 4 km radius of both Lucas's home and the River C√®ze. Helicopters with thermal vision, dog teams, and water search and rescue personnel also took part in searches. Appeals for witnesses have regularly been made and renewed. In the days following Lucas's disappearance, more than 1,500 people took part in searches. Thousands of others shared news on social networks, posting photographs and information along with the slogan ‚ÄúJe cherche Lucas‚Äù (‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking for Lucas‚Äù). French public figures such as Maurane, Bernard Weber, Jean-Pierre Foucault, R√©mi Gaillard and Renan Luce have made public appeals to find Lucas. In the months following Lucas's disappearance, his parents appeared on many television programmes to spread awareness of the case as widely as possible and to aid the investigation. These programmes included Crimes en direct: Mon enfant a disparu on NRJ 12 with Jean-Marc Morandini in November 2015; Toute une histoire on France 2 with Sophie Davant in January 2016; and Dans les yeux d‚ÄôOlivier with Olivier Delacroix in September 2017. The case has also been widely reported on television news programmes such as Sept √† huit and 13 h 15, le samedi. Posters have been put up in more than 1,000 towns and cities across France. In October, the non-profit organisation Retrouvons Lucas (‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Find Lucas‚Äù) was created to continue the efforts to find him. On 19 March 2016, a year and a day after Lucas's disappearance, a balloon release took place in Bagnols-sur- C√®ze and about 30 other towns and cities across France. In May 2016, a major poster campaign was launched in an attempt to locate Lucas. Giant 4-by-3-metre placards were installed on roadsides across the Gard, Dr√¥me and Vaucluse d√©partements. Between August and October 2016, billboard company JCDecaux provided hoardings all around France free of charge to Retrouvons Lucas, the first time such a measure has been taken for a missing person. A 10-second video advertisement was broadcast at service stations across France. On 18 March 2017, the second anniversary of Lucas's disappearance, a large gathering ‚Äì which included another balloon release ‚Äì was held in Bagnols-sur-C√®ze, attended by the local mayor. The event also hosted a mannequin challenge, in which more than 200 people participated, to show how time has stopped for Lucas's family ever since the day he disappeared.

Originally from Ghent he travelled abroad and became portrait painter to the ruling houses in Portugal, Spain and France.Joris van Straeten at the Netherlands Institute for Art History A polyglot, van der Straeten was a versatile courtier, who worked primarily as a portraitist for queens.Annemarie Jordan, Jooris van der Straeten: Habsburg Court Portraitist in Portugal, Spain, and France, paper presented on 24 March 2007 Life Jooris van der Straeten was originally from Ghent, which explains his alias of Joris van Gent (Joris of Ghent). It is believed he was a pupil of the prominent history and portrait painter Frans Floris in Antwerp.Abraham de Rijcke in: Karel van Mander, Schilder-boeck, 1604, It is possible that he also trained under the prominent portrait painter Antonis Mor and travelled with him to the Iberian peninsula. He likely accompanied the future Spanish King Philip II when the travelled to England to marry the English Queen Mary I of England in 1554 as evidenced by the portrait he made of the future king with the order of the Garter.Colecci√≥n Abell√≥, Centro Centro Cibeles de Cultura y Ciudadan√≠a, 2014 There are also bust and rondella versions of this work. After leaving England he worked in Portugal. Catherine of Austria, Queen of Portugal paid him in 1556 for a portrait of her grandson, the future King Sebastian of Portugal at the age of two.Julia de la Torre Fazio, El retrato en miniatura espa√±ol bajo los reinados de Felipe II y Felipe III, Tesis Doctoral, Universidad de M√°laga, Departamento de Historia del Arte, M√°laga, 2009 Portrait of Philip II of Spain In 1559 he was recorded in Spain, with a commission to paint a Resurrection of Lazarus for the church of Santiago de C√°ceres. He was documented from 1560 to 1568 under the name Jorge de la R√∫a as painter of Elisabeth of Valois, the Spanish queen consort. He was her portrait painter together with the local painter Alonso S√°nchez Coello, with whom he had also worked in Portugal. He also painted devotional works for queen Elisabeth. She paid a high sum for a painting of the Immaculate Virgin with five figures that hung over the queen's bed.P√©rez de Tudela, Almudena, Retrato de Isabel Clara Eugenia y Catalina Micaela de Jorge de la R√∫a, Ars Magazine, n¬∫ 29, enero-marzo 2016, pp. 66-76 He was still at the Spanish court in January 1571, as he is documented at that time occupied with a portrait of the infantas Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catherine Michelle. The portrait had been commissioned by the Duchess of Alba. He made two copies, one of which was sent to the grandmother of the infantas, the queen of France Catherine de' Medici while the other was sent to the Duchess. The Duchess refused the work because of its high price. It is possible that this is the work preserved in the British Royal Collection that portrays the sisters with a puppy and a parrot. At the Royal Collection website this work is attributed to Alonso S√°nchez Coello and workshop.Attributed to artist and workshop of Alonso S√°nchez Coello (1531-88), Isabella Clara Eugenia and Catharina, Daughters of Philip II, King of Spain, c. 1569-70 at the Royal Trust Prince Don Carlos in armor The artist moved to France where he worked as a painter of Elisabeth of Austria, Queen of France, wife of Charles IX of France. He painted a portrait of the queen in 1573. This is the only signed and dated work by the painter and is preserved in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales in Madrid. To Jorge de la R√∫a is also attributed a portrait of Prince Don Carlos in armor in the Convent of Las Descalzas Reales. This work was previously attributed to the Portuguese painter Crist√≥v√£o de Morais.Breuer-Hermann, Stephanie, Alonso S√°nchez Coello y el retrato en la corte de Felipe II, cat√°logo de la exposici√≥n celebrada en el Museo del Prado, June/July 1990, pp. 154-155 The artist worked in France also for Catherine de' Medici. The artist made his testament in April 1577 while lying ill in bed in at a residence in Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s. He stated in his testament that he was a painter and valet de chambre (valet) of the French queen Louise of Lorraine. He further declared that he was the creditor of the queen and Nicholas Hilliard, painter to the English queen. The artist likely never married nor did he become a naturalised Frenchman.Alexandra Zvereva, Le portrait de la Renaissance fran√ßaise Work While Jooris van der Straeten is mainly known as a portrait painter for rulers of the Habsburg and Valois, he also created Christian devotional scenes for his royal patrons. At the time he was working for the courts on the Iberian peninsula, many other portrait painters were active as court painters for the same ruling dynasty. They included Flemish painters Antonio Moro and Roland de Mois, as well as Spanish painters Alonso S√°nchez Coello and Juan Pantoja de la Cruz and Italian painter Sofonisba Anguissola.Anne J. Cruz, Juana of Austria : patron of the arts and regent of Spain, 1554-59, in: Anne J Cruz (Editor), 'The Rule of Women in Early Modern Europe', Mihoko Suzuki, 22 June 2009, pp. 103‚Äì122 As these artists were working within a same ideological framework, their depictions show many similarities. This has made attributions of unsigned works difficult and some works have been attributed to one artist and later to another one. For instance, the Portrait of Don Juan of Austria is now attributed to van der Straeten but was earlier attributed to Alonso S√°nchez Coello.Jorge de la R√∫a (Attributed to), Portrait of Don Juan of Austria at Art UK Portrait of a gentleman, said to be Perari Di Cremona The coherence of portraits made by painters working at the court of Philip II can be explained by the propagandistic purpose behind their creation and use. The conception behind the portraits of the Habsburg ruling family was to project an image capable of conveying the family's leading position in the world, its interests and dynastic destiny. Achieving a likeness in the portrait of the king and his family was secondary to giving form to the concept of the Habsburg majesty. The establishment and repetition of a series of conventions repeated by each court painter forged a uniform court painting procedure.Leticia Ruiz G√≥mez, In the king's name : the portrait of Juana of Austria in the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, in: Bulletin of the Bilbao Fine Arts Museum, no. 2, 2007, pp. 85-12 This so-called 'Spanish school of portrait painting' typically depicted the royal sitters at full or three-quarter length in a not overly heroic but rather personal manner. This was because portraits also had a semi-private and familial as well as genealogical role. As the royal family was spread out over Europe, the portraits could be kept to remember close family members as well as serve in the negotiation of royal marriages to give a preview of the prospective spouse's appearance.

Born in Wood Green in London, Bundock trained as a journalist with the Christian Commonwealth. He then moved to Manchester to work for the Independent Labour Party's (ILP) Labour Leader and joined the National Union of Journalists (NUJ). A supporter of the ILP and particularly of Fenner Brockway, Bundock regularly spoke on behalf of the party, and during World War I contributed to its pamphlet, \\"Why I Am A Conscientious Objector: Being Answer to the Tribunal Catechism\\". He spent some time in London as the paper's Parliamentary correspondent, before in 1919 becoming editor of the Leicester Pioneer. From 1920 to 1922, Bundock served as the Midlands representative on the National Administrative Council of the ILP. Through the ILP, Bundock was active in the Labour Party, chairing the Leicester Labour Party in 1922, and standing unsuccessfully in Bosworth at the 1922 United Kingdom general election. In 1923, he was appointed as full- time National Organiser of the NUJ, a controversial appointment on account of his socialist and pacifist views. He proved immediately successful in the role, particularly in negotiations with employers. During the UK general strike, he tried to get the Trades Union Congress paper, the British Worker, printed in Leicester, but was overruled by the union, which felt that journalists should not undertake any work during the action. Bundock was elected as general secretary of the NUJ in 1937, holding the post until 1952. That year, the International Federation of Journalists was re-established, and Bundock became its president. In retirement, he wrote a history of the NUJ, and also one of the National Union of Printing, Bookbinding and Paper Workers.

The company is headquartered in Vancouver, and was founded in 2007, and was then listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, then later listed on the New York Stock Exchange and the Namibian Stock Exchange. The company was formed by several executives from Bema Gold following its acquisition by Kinross Gold. The company built itself up through mergers with several other mining companies, including Central Sun Mining, CGA Mining, Auryx Gold and Papillon Resources to give it five operating mines, two of which have been divested, and several exploration properties.  History  B2Gold was founded in 2007 by Clive T. Johnson and other former executives at Bema Gold which was in the process of being acquired by Kinross Gold for $3.5 billion. The terms of the deal allowed the newly created B2Gold to take Bema Gold's exploration properties in Colombia and Russia. Their initial public offering in December 2007 on the Toronto Venture Exchange raised $100 million for exploration and valuation purposes. In 2008, the exploration company graduated to the Toronto Stock Exchange. In 2009, the B2Gold became a gold producer with its acquisition of the TSX-listed, and financially distressed company, Central Sun Mining. This all-stock deal, estimated to be valued at $67 million, gave B2Gold its first two mines, El Limon and La Libertad both in Nicaragua. The company produced 21,200 ounces of gold in 2009 up to 157,885 ounces in 2012. B2Gold added a third mine, in 2012, with its merger with ASX- listed CGA Mining. The deal gave B2Gold the Masbate mine in the Philippines and CGA Mining shareholders received 38% of the combined company. Around this time, in 2013, B2Gold also acquired Volta Resources in an all-stock deal worth US$63 million for its Burkina Faso exploration properties, and lost an exploration property in Rancho Grande (El Pav√≥n), Nicaragua, due to community opposition. With three operating mines, B2Gold produced 366,000 ounces of gold in 2013 and 391,000 ounces in 2014. B2Gold's fourth mine came from the development of the Otjikoto project, acquired in its 2011 merger with TSX- listed Auryx Gold which gave Auryx shareholders 10% of the combined company. the Otjikoto mine in Namibia achieved commercial production in February 2015. With the four mines, the company produced 493,265 ounces of gold in 2015 and 550,423 ounces in 2016. Their fifth mine was developed from the Fekola property in Mali acquired with B2Gold's merger with ASX-listed Papillon Resources. The 2014 deal, with an estimated value of US$570 million, gave Papillon shareholders 26% of the combined company, and resulted in the Fekola mine beginning production in November 2017. The five mines resulted in the company producing approximately 960,000 ounces of gold in both 2018 and 2019. The company sold its assets in Nicaragua to Vancouver-based mineral exploration company Calibre Mining.  Operations  As of 2020, B2Gold has three operating mines: * Fekola mine, located in Mali, near the Senegal border, is the second mine B2Gold developed itself, after having acquired the project from Papillon Resources. During that development phase, several B2Gold executives were taken hostage during the 2015 Bamako hotel attack but rescued by the Malian military. It is the company's largest mine as it has been producing over 400,000 ounces of gold each year. * Masbate mine, located in Aroroy, Masbate, the Philippines, came to B2Gold in the 2012 merger with CGA Mining. The open pit mine, which produces upwards of 200,000 ounces of gold annually, was subject to several killings in 2014-15 involving security guards and small-scale miners. * Otjikoto mine in Otjozondjupa, Namibia, is a combined open pit and underground mine that produces between 150,000 and 200,000 ounces of gold annually. Beginning production in 2015, it was the first mine B2Gold developed itself, and it is powered by its own solar power plant. =Past operations= * La Libertad gold mine, located in Chontales, Nicaragua, was acquired by B2Gold with its merger with Central Sun Mining in 2009 and sold to Calibre Mining in 2019. It consisted of several open pits, along with an underground operation, whose expansive reach necessitated the relocation of a neighbourhood of La Libertad. * El Limon mine, located on the border of Le√≥n and Chinandega Departments in Nicaragua, was acquired in 2009 and sold 2019 along with the La Libertad mine. It was the site of protests that resulted in one death and 31 injuries, damage to the mine and temporary closure, in 2015, following the sacking of three workers. Producing between 40,000 to 50,000 ounces of gold a year, it was B2Gold smallest mine.

He had right-wing views, and for most of his career he was a Bonapartist. He was a passionate orator, but somewhat inconsistent in his politics. Early years Edgar Raoul Raoul-Duval was born on 9 April 1832 in Laon, Aisne. His father was Charles-Edmond Raoul-Duval (1807‚Äì93), a senator from 1876 to 1879. His father's surname was originally Duval, later changed to Raoul-Duval. His mother was Octavie Say (1804‚Äì65). She was the daughter of the economist Jean-Baptiste Say, and he was the cousin of L√©on Say. He was a Protestant. His father and grandfather were both magistrates. Raoul-Duval completed his law studies and in 1853 was appointed a substitute magistrate in Nantes at a very early age. On 8 January 1857 at Le Havre he married Catherine Foerster (1834‚Äì1922). Their children were Marianne (1857‚Äì1940), Valentine (1860‚Äì1932), Edmond (1862‚Äì1932) and Andr√© (1870‚Äì1927). Edgar Raoul-Duval was in turn advocate-general at Angers, at Bordeaux, and from 1866 to 1870 at Rouen. He resigned on 4 September 1870 to register at the bar in Rouen as a prelude to entering militant politics. Political career Raoul-Duval ran unsuccessfully for election to the legislature on 8 February 1871. He was elected later that year as conservative candidate in a by-election for Seine- Inf√©rieure, where there were four vacant seats. He was a representative in the National Assembly for Seine-Inf√©rieure from 2 July 1871 to 7 March 1876, and sat with the Union des Droites parliamentary group. He later joined the Appel au peuple group. Raoul-Duval was soon one of the most active deputies of the conservative majority and one of its favorite speakers. He adopted Montesquieu's definition, \\"Freedom is the right to do anything the law does not prohibit.\\" Raoul-Duval was rather inconsistent in his politics. A critic wrote of him, \\"M. Raoul Duval has plenty of entrain, of √©lan, of fire, of repartee, but he lacks the power of continued pursuance of one subject. ... He begins with a good and substantial address; he finishes with rolling fire of passionate responses to attacks hurled at him.\\" Raoul-Duval was responsible for forcing the retirement from office of the Minister of the Interior, Victor Lefranc. He did not succeed in an attack on the treaty Adolphe Thiers had made with Germany after the Franco-Prussian War. In 1872 Raoul-Duval intervened in several important debates. On economic questions Raoul Duval always defended the principles of free trade. He opposed the first constitutional laws and the \\"great council\\" proposed by Albert de Broglie, and also fought the proposal to extend the powers of Marshal MacMahon for seven years. He once said that any person who ventured to hint at dissolution was fit to be classed with Communists. However, several times between 1873 and 1875, when he sat with the Bonapartist group, he called for the dissolution of the Chamber. He demanded a plebiscite to sanction the constitution, and voted against the constitutional laws on 25 February 1875. In the 1876 legislative elections Raoul-Duval ran both in the 8th arrondissement of Paris and in the Louviers district of Eure. He failed in Paris but was elected in the second round in Louviers. He rejoined the Bonapartist group. He was rapporteur of the budget of the navy and colonies for 1877, and intervened several times in the budget discussions. After the 16 May 1877 crisis he was one of 11 deputies who abstained from the vote of confidence requested by the Broglie ministry. He held office until 25 June 1877. In the elections of 14 October 1877 after the dissolution of the House he was defeated in his attempt to be reelected in Louviers. He tried again on 21 August 1881, but was again defeated. Raoul-Duval won in a by- election on 25 May 1884 in the Bernay district of Eure to replace Eug√®ne Janvier de La Motte(fr), who had died. On 4 October 1885 he was elected on the conservative list of the Eure department. He broke with the Bonapartists. In mid-1886 he proposed to Lucien Millevoye that a broad conservative coalition should be formed that would include conservative republicans and Protestants. The idea was discussed vaguely by the conservatives but did not have much effect. Most monarchists were not interested apart from a small clique of business-related northern deputies. In 1886 Raoul-Duval was a member of the Central Committee of the newly founded French Association for the Propagation of Volap√ºk. The association was authorized on 8 April 1886 as a union of French enthusiasts of the Volap√ºk constructed language. Due to poor health Raoul-Duval went to Monte Carlo in December 1886, where he died of a chill on 10 February 1887 at the age of 54. A bronze statue of Edgar Raoul-Duval was erected in 1890 in Notre-Dame-du-Vaudreuil, Eure. Publications Numerous reports, proposals and speeches by Raoul-Duval were published.

The embassy was opened on January 4, 2018, although a previous embassy was also established in the early 1990s. History Poland did not initially open a resident embassy in the Philippines when diplomatic relations between the two countries were formally established on September 22, 1973, with relations initially being conducted through the Polish embassy in Tokyo. In 1993, a resident embassy was opened in Manila, but the mission was closed the following year. Following the closure of the resident embassy, the Philippines was placed under the jurisdiction of the Polish embassy in Bangkok, and eventually the embassy in Kuala Lumpur. While there was no resident embassy in the Philippines, Poland conducted its diplomatic relations through its honorary consulate in Manila, which was first opened in 1938. A second honorary consulate was opened in Cebu City in 2009, followed by a third in General Santos in 2013. In 2013, the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a delegation to the Philippines to discuss the possible reopening of the embassy in Manila, owing to the growing Philippine economy and the possibility of enhancing political, economic and touristic exchanges through having a permanent presence in the Philippines. Three years later, Foreign Minister Witold Waszczykowski announced in a speech delivered on the floor of the Sejm that the embassy in Manila would be reopened, coinciding with Poland's desire to expand its economic involvement in Asia. On August 23, 2017, Deputy Foreign Minister Marek Magierowski presented a note verbale to Patricia Ann Paez, the Philippine ambassador to Poland, informing the Philippine government that it would be reopening the embassy on January 2, 2018, and after 24 years of closure, the Polish Embassy in Manila was finally reopened on January 4, 2018. Location and staff The Polish Embassy is provisionally headed by a charg√© d'affaires, pending the appointment of an ambassador by the Polish government. The current charg√© d'affaires is Jaros≈Çaw Szczepankiewicz, who had previously served as the Polish ambassador to Ethiopia between 2008 and 2012.

Founded in 2012 and led by Azad Shabo, the Azad√Æ Battalion is opposed to the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and fights on the side of Turkey in the Syrian Civil War.  History = Early phase of the civil war and decline = Azad Shabo, commander of the Azad√Æ Battalion, in May 2016, when it was part of the Army of Mujahideen. Mustafa Cumma's Kurdish Freedom Party is a long-standing rival of the Democratic Union Party (PYD) and strongly opposes its policies. In early 2012, members of the Kurdish Freedom Party came together in the village of Tel Aren, Afrin District, where they announced the formation of the Azad√Æ Battalion under the leadership of Azad Shabo. Though considered \\"supporters of the Kurdish Freedom Party\\", the Azad√Æ Battalion denied an affiliation to any party. It subsequently joined the anti-PYD Free Syrian Army and the Aleppo Revolutionary Military Council, led by Abdul Jabbar al-Oqaidi; the pro-PYD Hawar News Agency has accused the militia of directly working with the al- Nusra Front in Ras al-Ayn. After the formation of a PYD/YPG-aligned FSA group, named the Kurdish Front, at the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, the influence of other Kurdish FSA groups such as the Azad√Æ Battalion and the Saladin Ayubi Brigade began to decline. Meanwhile, Cumma's Kurdish Freedom Party left the Kurdish Supreme Committee, an attempted coalition government of pro- and anti-PYD parties for the Syrian Kurdish-held territories, in February 2013. Hostilities between the two parties consequently grew, and the Azad√Æ Battalion clashed with the YPG at the villages of Burj Abdilla and Abdilla in the Afrin Region on 7 March 2013. Both sides blamed each other for this incident that left four fighters dead. Sporadic fighting between the two groups continued, and Azad√Æ Battalion fighters reportedly took part in attacks on the YPG-held Sheikh Maqsood neighborhood of Aleppo since September 2013. The group also fought with other rebels against the Syrian Army in Aleppo's Khan al-Asal and Rashidin. When the al-Nusra Front and allied FSA units attacked and overran the Kurdish Front's positions at Tall Hasil and Tall Aran southeast of Aleppo International Airport, the Azad√Æ Battalion was accused of having taken part in the fighting. The battalion itself denied this, while a FSA member declared that the Azad√Æ Battalion had simply started policing the villages after their capture by the FSA. Nevertheless, the Kurdish Supreme Committee consequently started an investigation of the Azad√Æ Battalion \\"for allegedly taking part in the attacks against West Kurdistan\\". The Kurdish Institute of Brussels condemned the Azad√Æ Battalion for the same reasons. Meanwhile, hardcore Islamist rebel groups accused the Azad√Æ Battalion of working with the Kurdish Front. By 2016, the Azad√Æ Battalion had joined the Army of Mujahideen. In May 2016, Azad Shabo gave an interview to Halab Today, claiming that the Syrian government, not the FSA, was shelling Sheikh Maqsood, while also accusing the YPG forces in Sheikh Maqsood of being allied to the government. He also said that the YPG helped to break the Siege of Nubl and al-Zahraa, and that the PYD's rule over Afrin was a brutal, mismanaged dictatorship. Though the Azad√Æ Battalion continued to fight against the YPG, its power reportedly dwindled over time, and pro-PYD media claimed that parts of the militia under Mahmut Hamo eventually split off and joined the Sultan Murad Division. The rest of the Azad√Æ Battalion eventually joined the Elite Army while remaining under Azad Shabo's command. The unit thereafter came to call itself the \\"Elite Battalion\\", though also continued to use its old name. It is unclear how numerous the unit still is; Shabo said in late January 2018 that there were \\"dozens\\" of Kurds fighting with pro-Turkish forces in Syria, though claimed a few weeks later that his unit included \\"100 Kurdish fighters affiliated with the FSA\\". = Operations with the SNA = The Azad√Æ Battalion became part of the Syrian National Army in 2016 and took part in Operation Euphrates Shield against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In course of that campaign, it fought at Jarablus, Azaz and al-Bab. In March 2017, Azad Shabo stated that his militia was supporting the deployment of Rojava Peshmerga to Syria. In September 2017, someone attempted to assassinate Azad Shabo by placing a bomb under his car, though the explosive device was found and destroyed before it could harm anyone. In early 2018, the Azad√Æ Battalion participated in Operation Olive Branch, causing the pro-PYD Hawar News Agency to claim that Azad Shabo's men acted as \\"mercenaries\\" for the Kurdish National Council and Turkey. On the other side, Azad Shabo accused the YPG of being \\"agents of the Syrian regime\\" and said that the campaign would not end before Afrin had been captured from the YPG. In another interview, he further stated that \\"Afrin will return to the arms of the Syrian revolution and will win back the rights of its people. The YPG is no different from Assad‚Äôs regime. They have both practiced tyranny and murder against Kurds. Operation Olive Branch will liberate Afrin's inhabitants.\\" An Azad√Æ Battalion commander accused Iran of increasing its presence through proxy militias in southeastern Aleppo in October 2018, claiming that said militias were lawless and not loyal to Syrian authorities. In late 2019, the Azad√Æ Battalion took part in the Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria.  Ideology  The Azad√Æ Battalion claims to fight for democracy and the liberation of all Syrians from the rule of the al-Assad family. It regards the PYD and YPG/YPJ as Ba'athist, chauvinist and racist proxies of the Kurdistan Workers' Party who are thought by the Azad√Æ Battalion to be controlled by Iran and closely allied with the Syrian government. Furthermore, Azad Shabo has stated his belief that the \\"PYD was formed to fight Islam\\". The Azad√Æ Battalion officially voiced support for the Kurdish National Council in 2017.

The main motifs are wreaths and strapwork, more rarely they are in the shape of monograms and figures. The ornamental shapes were filled in with other materials (gravel, grit, broken brick, glass shards, coal etc.).

After his service, McCooey worked at Benton & Bowles, an advertising agency in New York, NY. In the early 1960s, Richard returned to Washington, D.C. at the invitation of the Rev. Edward B. Bunn, the president of Georgetown University from 1952 to 1964. Father Bunn finally agreed to Richard's vision of opening a restaurant and a student rathskeller near the main campus; a dream Richard had since his freshman year at Georgetown. In 1962, with support of the university which owned the land, Richard realized his dream, opening a restaurant named 1789 and a student rathskeller in the basement called The Tombs. Despite initial opposition from the Georgetown community, Richard, with the help of Eugene L. Stewart, Esq., also a Georgetown University alumnus and Georgetowner newspaper founder, Ami Stewart, won the legal battle 1960, 1, 1 \\"Town Gown\\". Richard‚Äôs deep connection to Georgetown and to history inspired the naming of 1789 restaurant. There were 3 reasons why Richard came up with the name 1789: John Carroll (bishop), founded Georgetown in 1789, the first Catholic and Jesuit institution of higher learning in the United States. That year, too, the state legislature made the port of Georgetown a Maryland town. Finally, 1789 was the year the U.S. Constitution was enacted. Richard named The Tombs after a poem from T.S. Eliot's \\"Old Possum‚Äôs Book of Practical Cats‚Äù in ‚ÄúBustopher Jones, The Cat About Town‚Äù enjoys lunch at the tomb. During his service in the Air Force, Richard‚Äôs nickname was ‚ÄúBustopher Cat.‚Äù 1789 is decorated with original antiques in an upscale and classic ‚ÄúOld Georgetown‚Äù setting. The Tombs reflects themes of sports, the bar is surrounded by original World War One posters, while the Sweeps section celebrates rowing with original antique prints of the sport and oars painted in the colors of the great rowing collegiate teams. Richard loved Georgetown Rowing and supported them through the years; especially the Cadle years. Don Cadle was a coach at Georgetown and a key to the team's success when the program was revived half a century ago. A Rhodes Scholar and former Balliol College Boat Club rower at Oxford, Don Cadle came to Washington, D.C., to serve as a NASA official. While working at the agency, Cadle also coached the Georgetown crews. Within one season, the team was winning Dad Vails and racing in the Olympic Trials. Cadle led the Hoyas to tremendous success on the water and instilled in the team traditions that continue to this day. The 1789 and The Tombs share a federal-style townhouse dating from the mid-1800s. In 1964, Richard established the tradition of the ‚ÄúChimes Nights‚Äù for the Georgetown Chimes, inspired by the Whiffenpoofs‚Äô weekly performances at Yale local establishment Morey‚Äôs. Richard purchased two adjacent properties in the mid 1960s and opened a laundry and market. He re-envisioned the spaces and in 1975 opened F. Scott‚Äôs, a nightclub with art-deco design and ambiance, named for novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald. F, a distant cousin of Francis Scott Key, a Georgetowner famed for writing the national anthem, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\". After selling to Clyde's, F. Scott's was transformed into a private event space before closing in the summer of 2016. In 2018, it was disassembled and redesigned as a part of 1789 restaurant and named the 1789 Bar & Club Room. In 1980 Richard along with fellow restaurateur, Stuart J. Long, and the president of Washington Boat Lines, Willem Polak, had received a $225,000 loan from the National Trust for Historic Preservation to buy and restore the 50-year-old yacht, the Williamsburg, now in poor condition at a Philadelphia dock. The project had drawn opposition from some local citizens' groups but apparently received all the necessary permits to proceed. In its heyday, the Williamsburg was used extensively by Harry Truman and briefly by Dwight Eisenhower, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin. President Eisenhower had the 243-foot ocean-going vessel decommissioned and sold in 1953 as a \\"needless luxury.\\" It was turned into a floating restaurant in New Jersey. Since 1977, the yacht has served as home to a private Philadelphia club. Ultimately the project never got underway. In 1985, Richard sold his restaurants to Clyde‚Äôs Restaurant Group, a deal organized by John Laytham, President and CEO of Clyde‚Äôs, a graduate of Georgetown University (F'66), School of Foreign Service, and close friend of Richard. The restaurants remain in operation today by Clyde‚Äôs. The serene, white-tablecloth setting remains a frequent spot for fine dining for the Washington crowd, including Former President Barack Obama's dinner with German chancellor Angela Merkel. Then in 1986 Richard founded his restaurant design company Persona Studios.. Clyde‚Äôs was Persona Studios first client and Richard remained heavily involved in the design of their restaurants as they expanded. Over the next 20 years, Richard and Karen's Persona Studios developed a long list of design clients all across the country with some outside the US such as The Polo Club dining room at the Moscow Marriott Royal Aurora Hotel.  Awards  In San Francisco 1966, Richard was the recipient of the Georgetown University John Carroll Award,. named after Archbishop John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop in North America and founder of Georgetown University and the University's highest alumni honor. Established in 1951, the John Carroll Award is conferred upon alumni whose achievements and record of service exemplify the ideals and traditions of Georgetown and its founder. McCooey was a longtime Georgetown volunteer, and previously served on the Board of Governors of the Georgetown University Alumni Association. In a surprise dinner in 2012 held on the 50th anniversary of the restaurants' opening, he added: \\"I am so appreciative. I did all I wanted to do. As a freshman, walking along this street, I had that dream. I kept the dream.\\"  Legacy  Richard died on August 6, 2014, in Greenwich, Connecticut at the age of 83 with Karen his wife of 24 years by his side.. Richard lived his entire adult life in Georgetown, a community and a university for whom he worked his entire life. Karen held his funeral Mass at their parish, Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. The Chimes, nearly all their alums and actives, sang and were an integral part of the liturgy. Richard loved the sport of rowing and the GU rowers. He attended rowing regattas to spur on Georgetown University's teams and supported them over the years. It was in 1962 when he first opened the doors to the Tombs that Richard met the burgeoning Georgetown University Rowing Team. A new and faithful fellowship was forged. If Richard could be out on a launch to watch a race, he would be in heaven. $18,000 for a new launch was raised. It was christened the \\"Richard McCooey\\" in the Spring of 2015. Richard's design legacy lives on through Karen who resides in Washington DC and works in Georgetown at her firm, Karen McCooey Design, designing restaurants and homes, and working on non-profit efforts in Richard's name.

Designed as a sequel to Human Resource Machine, players solve puzzles through by moving multiple data cubes with human workers, using an in-game programming language.  Gameplay  Similar to Human Resource Machine, players are tasked with over 60 programming puzzles, typically involving the movement of numerical data cubes by human workers. For example, a task might ask the player to program the humans to sort the numbers on data cubes in order. The programming language is similar to assembly language, allowing for simple loops, logic, memory storage and calculations. As with its predecessor, the code can be edited in a textual form by copying-and-pasting. The same program is used to control all humans simultaneously, while allowing each human to follow its individual logic through the project based on their current state, such as moving left or right based on comparing the value of the data cube they are holding. The humans will run through the program until either the program solution is met, or all the humans reach the end of the program and the problem solution is not met, in which case the player must rework the program. The player is able to step through the program and select any individual human to watch their progress through the program for debugging purposes. Once a player achieves a working solution for a given problem, the game will then simulate 25 additional cases where random factors (such as values of data cubes) change, which might cause a program to fail and require the player to account for that. Otherwise, the player is then ranked on the number of program steps they have, and the number of seconds (cycles) it takes for the program to complete, measured against average marks determined by Tomorrow Corporation. Most levels provide two optional challenges, to beat the average steps and average seconds with optimization of their program; these are sometimes diametric goals and do not need to be completed within the same program. Other puzzles are fully optional, requiring more advanced techniques to solve.  Reception  The game was generally reviewed positively by critics. Destructoid called the game \\"work...but enjoyable work\\" and stated that while there \\"could be some hard- to-ignore faults\\", that overall \\"the experience is fun.\\" Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer summarised the game as \\"a brilliant mixture of coding, humour, and puzzling,\\" rating it 4.5/5 stars.

Its best friend is an eagle-owl Schuhu. By shaking its bunch of keys, the Little Ghost can open everything that it wants, either a door or a treasure chest, without touching it. The biggest wish of the Little Ghost is to see the world during daylight.However, all its tries to stay awake after the witching hour fail. One day, after the Little Ghost gives up all its hope, it suddenly awakes at noon and not at midnight. During the discovery tour of the castle it suddenly sees a school class. While it tries to hide from them, it gets hit by a sunbeam and suddenly changes its color from white to black. Afterwards, it jumps into the castle well and opens a small door and gets to the sewer system of the city Eulenburg. Due to the large amount of pipes of the channel system, it cannot find its way back home to the castle Eulenstein, although it opens every channel output and causes a lot of chaos among the inhabitants of the City of Eulenberg, who start to call the Little Ghost black stranger Schwarzer Unbekannter. Finally the Little Ghost causes a big disaster during the festival of the 325th anniversary of the siege of the Swedish soldiers. It attacks the actor of the Swedish Generals Torstenson, believing that the General came back, after the little Ghost frightened him away 325 years ago. 325 years ago it felt disturbed by the loud noise of the cannons. After causing the chaos during the festival, it asks the children of the pharmacist for help, thereupon they go to the castle Eulenstein to search for Mr. Schuhu at midnight. Mr. Schuhu blames the wrong adjusted town hall clock for the unfortunate coincidence, as every ghost has to obey a special chime of the clock. After the watch master maker adjusts the town hall clock from the noon to the midnight hour, The Little Ghost finally wakes up at night and can return to its castle. While its return to the castle, it gets hit by a moon beam and finally it color changes back to white. Due to its happiness, because everything turned out all right, it dances on the castle pinnacle all witching hour long.  Characters = The Little Ghost = The Little Ghost is a friendly night ghost. During the day it sleeps in an oak coffer, covered with iron, in the attic of the castle Eulenstein. Normally, The Little Ghost is very peaceful and does not harm anybody, except if somebody disturbs it, like the Swedish General Torsten Torstenson or the Governor of the castle, Mr. Georg-Kasimir . The Little Ghost feels disturbed by the loud noise of the cannons from the Swedish General Torsten Torstenson and banishes him from the castle. The governor of the castle, Mr. Georg-Kasimir, plans to throw out the Little Ghost from the window, so that it frightens him so much, that he jumps in the muddy castle moat. Moreover, the Little Ghost frightens the mayor of Eulenberg, as he claims that he does not believe in ghosts. On the other hand, the Little Ghost is very helpful, curious and friendly. It helps the countess Genoveva Elisabeth Barbara to find her valuable earrings, which were stolen from the window sill by a magpie. Moreover, it is very sad that the inhabitants of Eulenberg are scared of its black appearance. = The Eagle-Owl Schuhu = The eagle-owl Schuhu is the best friend of the Little Ghost and lives in an empty oak on the castle hill. As an old and wise bird, the eagle- owl insists that everybody talks respectfully to it and it always has a good advice for the Little Ghost. Both, The Little Ghost and the eagle owl, like to tell stories. With the help of the eagle-owl, the little Ghost can return to the castle Eulenstein. = The General Torsten Torstenson = The Swedish General Torsten Torstenson besieged the castle and the city of Eulenberg. As the Little Ghost could not sleep during the day, due to the loud noise of the cannons, it frightened the Swedish General so badly, that he terminated the siege and left the castle and the city with his army the next day. A portrait of the Swedish General Torsten Torstenson still remains in the knight hall of the castle, as a reminder of his siege and once in a while the Little Ghost speaks to it. Furthermore, the Little Ghost tries to stay awake after the witching hour with the valuable pocket alarm clock, which the General Torsten Torstenson lost during the siege. During the 325th anniversary of the siege of Eulenburg, the brewery director plays the role of the Swedish General Torsten Torstenson, so that the Little Ghost believes that the General returned. = The Children of the Pharmacist = The eleven year old Herbert and his siblings, the nine year old twins Jutta and G√ºnther, help the Little Ghost to find its way back home to the castle. While the Little Ghost spends the night in the cellar of the pharmacy, it hears the conversation between the children and it finds out that the Swedish General and his soldiers, whom the Little Ghost saw earlier that day, were actors. At night, the three children sneak out to find the eagle-owl Mr. Schuhu in his empty oak, to ask for its advice. They can understand the eagle-owl with the help of the bunch of keys from the Little Ghost. After speaking with Mr. Schuhu, the children go to the watch master maker and ask him to adjust the town hall clock. He repairs it. Furthermore, the three children write together with the Little Ghost a letter to the mayor in which it apologizes for its behavior.  Origin  When Otfried Preu√üler was a child, his grandmother Dora told him stories very often. One of these stories was about a White Lady (ghost) who predicted births and deaths in the family of her descendants and who moreover protected her home very often. Once, the white lady closed away the Swedish General Torstenson Torstenson from the castle of her father, by shooing him out of his bed, giving him a telling off, while he was only wearing his night clothes and begging for mercy. Preu√üler always kept this scene in mind and while he was writing the book of the history of the white lady, the white lady converted to the Little Ghost.

Poll (born April 18, 1957) is an American restaurateur based in New York and the founder of the Poll Group, owner of Manhattan's Loeb Central Park Boathouse and Gallagher's Steakhouse. Background and early career Born in Manhasset, on Long Island's North Shore, Dean Poll is the second of three sons of Alexandra and Dimitri Poll. He played center on the Paul D. Schreiber High School basketball team in Port Washington. On weekends and during school breaks he worked as a ‚Äúwater boy‚Äù in Pappas Restaurant, his family's high-volume, 250-seat seafood restaurant in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn. Poll started working full-time after high school when he became the purchasing manager for the family's newest property, a 14,000 sq ft. food complex in Midtown Manhattan's Time & Life Building. It comprised Dawson's Pub, La Petite Brassiere, Bon Jour coffee shop and Southampton Caterers that served the office building-dense Rockefeller Center neighborhood. Diving into the restaurant's back-of-house trenches, Poll excelled at inspecting seafood in the legendary Fulton Fish Market, negotiating with meat brokers in Manhattan's once-gritty Meatpacking District, and sourcing vegetables in the South Bronx's Hunts Point, the largest produce market in the world. The Long Island years In 1980, Dean Poll and his brothers, Gillis and George, recreated Pappas Restaurant in Williston Park, renaming it Riverbay Seafood Bar & Grill in 1989. In 1986, they opened Bryant & Cooper Steak House and butcher shop in Roslyn. By 1997, The New York Times called Bryant & Cooper ‚Äúarguably the best steakhouse on Long Island‚Äù and Riverbay, ‚ÄúNassau-Suffolk's No. 1 seafood restaurant.‚Äù Entering Manhattan market Interested in expanding into Manhattan, Dean Poll dissolved his partnership with his brothers in 1998-1999. Dividing the assets, he retained ownership of Riverbay, while setting his sights on the Central Park Boathouse, a city-owned concession that was requesting proposals. Central Park Boathouse In June 2000, New York City's Department of Parks and Recreation awarded Dean Poll the concession for the Loeb Boathouse property, one of only two restaurants in Manhattan's Central Park. It consists of a lakeside fine dining restaurant, a fast casual caf√© and an event space. Poll transformed the Boathouse into ‚Äúa must-have NYC experience\\" and \\"a proven money-maker, too.\\" Of the Parks Department's 1,800 concessions, the Boathouse is a significant contributor to the city's coffers, second only to the parking facilities at Shea Stadium. In 2016, the city renewed the Boathouse's 15-year lease. Tavern on the Green In August 2009, the Parks Department granted Dean Poll the concession for Tavern on the Green, the second of two restaurants in Manhattan's iconic Central Park. A major labor dispute erupted between Dean Poll and the union representing Tavern workers. The dispute resulted in Poll backing out of the deal and the union organizing a 44-day strike [11] at the Boathouse. Ultimately the two sides came to terms. Today they enjoy an exceptionally good relationship. Gallagher's Steakhouse In January 2013, Dean Poll bought legendary Gallaghers Steakhouse from longtime owner Marlene Brody. Rescuing the 200-seat, Prohibition-era restaurant 14 days before it was scheduled to close, Poll began a strategic 7-month renovation that the New York Post's Steve Cuozzo likened to ‚Äústirring the resurrection of a classic.‚Äù In February 2011, Gallaghers reopened to rave reviews that celebrated Poll's success restoring its vintage horseshoe bar, iconic glass-encased meat locker. On November 14, 2017, Gallagher's hosted its 90th birthday with a cocktail party that attracted 600 colorful Broadway stars, sports icons, business moguls and socialites. In December 2017, Poll's resurrection of Gallagher's was the subject of a New York Times article by James Barron. Personal life Dean Poll and his wife Linda, whom he met in 1980, are parents of two sons. He is on the Board of the Boys‚Äô Club of New York and has served on the Board of the New York Athletic Club. An active member of New York's Greek-American community, Poll served as the president of the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity from 2013 - 2016. The Greek Orthodox Ecumenical Patriarch named Dean Poll an Archon, [17] Nomophylax, protector of laws and defender of the faith, one of the highest civilian honors given by the Greek Orthodox Church of the Order of St. Andrew.

It was discovered on 8 October 1785 by astronomer William Herschel.  Observation history =Historic observation= Herschel described his discovery as \\"faint, pretty large, irregular round, brighter middle\\". Further observations were made by both his son, John Herschel, who simply noted \\"big\\" on his first and \\"very faint\\" on his second observation, as well as R. J. Mitchell, who noted \\"pretty big, spiral galaxy, disc enveloped in faint outlying neby and looks like an unresolved cluster.\\" NGC 521 was later catalogued by John Louis Emil Dreyer in the New General Catalogue, where the galaxy was described as \\"faint, pretty large, round, gradually brighter middle\\". =Supernovae= A total of three supernovae have been assigned to NGC 521, with SN 1966G being the first to be observed in 1966, followed by SN 1982O in 1982 and the most recent being SN 2006G in 2005.  Description  The galaxy's large apparent size can be attributed to the fact that it is face-on. Despite its size, it only has an apparent visual magnitude of 11.7. It can be classified as spiral galaxy of type SBbc using the Hubble Sequence. The object's distance of roughly 220 million light-years from the Solar System can be estimated using its redshift and Hubble's law.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. It now houses the Montague Place Apartments. History Charles Montague was born near London, Ontario in 1847 and moved to Caro in 1863. After a stint in the Union Army, he joined his uncle's mercantile business. He bought out his uncle in 1867, and continued in business with William E. Sherman. Montague and Sherman constructed a commercial block, located at this site in Caro, in 1869. Over the next few years, Montague continued to construct commercial enterprises in Caro. He also opened a bank in Caro in 1875, and a sugar beet factory in 1899. At this point, Montague realized the need for a first class hotel in Caro. In 1900, Montague's earliest business block was demolished and work began on the first Hotel Montague. The hotel opened in 1902. Montague continued in various business interests for the next 20 years, and even planned to construct an opera house adjacent to the hotel. However, in 1921, he was overcome by illness and died January 10. On November 21, 1923 the first Hotel Montague burned down. The Caro Board of Commerce, realizing the need for a hotel in town, began planning to construct a replacement structure almost immediately. By late December they were reviewing plans from Saginaw architects Cowles & Mutscheller, and by March 1924 had gathered funds to build the hotel. Construction began in May, and was completed by December 1924. The hotel continued to operate as a hotel through the Great Depression and beyond. The hotel changed owners in 1962, but by the late 1960s, much of the hotel business had moved to newer motels on the outskirts of the community. It was again sold in 1978, and in 1984, a fire closed the hotel for good. The building remained vacant through 1991. Description The Hotel Montague is a 3-1/2 story L-shaped brick and cut fieldstone building sited on a corner lot. The main facade is Classical Revival in form, and includes a pedimented, double-deck, brick-pier portico at the join of the legs of the L. Concrete stairs at both ends of the portico provide access to the main entrance. The lower 1-1/2 story is clad with fieldstones, a remnant of the original 1902 hotel. The upper two stories are covered with a brown face brick. The flat roof is hidden behind a parapet. Two small additions from the 1950s are in the rear. All windows are double hung wood, with a single light.

The Manchester-based charity aims to promote early diagnosis of breast cancer, improve cancer screenings, and change the habits and lifestyles of high-risk patients. Based at The Nightingale Centre & Prevent Breast Cancer Research Centre in Wythenshawe, Manchester, where the NHS co-ordinates the breast-screening programme for the Greater Manchester area.  History  Prevent Breast Cancer, previously named Genesis Breast Cancer Prevention, was officially launched in 1996. The charity raises funds for research into the breast cancer gene BRCA2. From 2000 until 2007 the charity raised ¬£2 million towards the building of Europe's first breast cancer prevention centre, which opened at Wythenshawe Hospital in 2007. Genesis changed their name to Prevent Breast Cancer in 2016 to better represent their overall mission. The charity was founded by Lester Barr, who is the current chairman of Prevent Breast Cancer and a Consultant Breast Surgeon. He has been practicing oncology for more than 30 years and currently runs a One Stop Breast Clinic at Manchester Hospital. He has been practicing surgery for more than 30 years and currently runs a One Stop Breast Clinic at Spire Manchester Hospital. Lester is also Associate Hospital Dean at Wythenshawe Hospital. = The Nightingale Centre = The charity's flagship medical centre, The Nightingale Centre, was opened in August 2007 at Wythenshawe Hospital, Manchester. The ¬£14m centre was funded by Greater Manchester Strategic Health Authority (GMSHA) and Prevent Breast Cancer donations. The centre was the first of its kind in Europe, and was designed to provide diagnostic and prevention services to patients across the North West. More than 50,000 people from the Greater Manchester area are screened at the centre every year. Before it was built, it was housed at Withington Hospital.  Research  The charity's research is focused on four distinct pillars: Gene Research ‚Äì Examining how changes and mutations in genes can affect an individual‚Äôs risk of developing breast cancer Early Detection & Improved Screening ‚Äì Identifying new and unique screening methods to ensure early and accurate diagnoses Preventative Drug Research ‚Äì Investigating drugs that can be used as a preventative measure to reduce an individual‚Äôs risk of developing breast cancer Diet & Lifestyle ‚Äì Research into lifestyle factors that contribute to breast cancer risk and how diet and exercise can reduce this. = Predicting Risk of Cancer at Screening (PROCAS) SNP study = The PROCAS1 recruited over 58,000 women and was the largest recruiting study in the UK. It was led by Prevent Breast Cancer Researcher, Professor of Genetics, Gareth Evans. The study evaluated the feasibility of introducing personalised breast cancer risk estimation into the NHS Breast Screening programme through the collection of information on breast cancer risk factors. Prevent Breast Cancer funded the collection of saliva samples and DNA extraction from 10,000 women on the study and testing genetic fragments (SNPs) for key information. The information for each woman was collated in order to provide a risk score. PROCAS 2 launched in October 2017 and will involve a further 18,600 women, whose risk of developing the disease within the next ten years will again be calculated. Professor Evans and his team developed a gene test in October 2017 to provide more accurate risk information to families specifically with the BRCA gene mutation. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are known to increase the risk of breast cancer in patients between 45 and 90 per cent. The test analysed 18 genetic variants Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms ‚Äì SNPs in blood or saliva across 1,400 women who carried the BRCA high-risk gene. Researchers believe the test could reduce the number of pre-emptive mastectomies in the UK from 50 to 36 per cent.[7] The plan is for the genetic test to enter clinical practice in the UK in six months.  The Angelina Jolie Effect  Referrals for the gene test more than doubled in 2013 after Angelina Jolie shared her own experiences with the media. She decided to undergo a double mastectomy after learning she had an up to 87 per cent chance of developing breast cancer. The increase in referrals was dubbed the \\"Angelina Jolie effect\\" by the media. = The 2-Day Diet = The 2-Day Diet was developed by Professor Tony Howell and Dr Michelle Harvie, both of whom have spent years researching and developing the optimum diet for weight loss and the links to breast cancer risk. The 2-Day Diet has been proven to reduce fat, which reduces insulin levels and controls other hormones, such as oestrogen. High levels of oestrogen in the body are known to cause cancer. Prevent Breast Cancer funded a study by Dr Harvie which involved 1,000 women, split into two groups. The study was published in the peer-reviewed Breast Cancer Research journal. To date, the centre's 2-Day Diet book and cookbook have sold more than 340,000 copies in the UK and has been published in over 16 countries. The book was ranked number 64 in the bestselling printed books of 2013 and the cookbook was ranked number 4 on the Sunday Times Bestselling Manual List for 2013. Author proceeds from the book sales enabled Prevent Breast Cancer to fund the BRRIDE-2 study which analyses the effect of an intermittent diet (The 2-Day Diet) versus a daily energy restriction diet on the body and the link to fat stores in and around the liver as fats here are found to contribute to insulin resistance and therefore breast cancer risk.  Partnerships = Manchester City Football Club = Prevent Breast Cancer was Manchester City Football Club's chosen charity in 2000. The partnership was celebrated by a launch of 2,000 balloons at the City of Manchester Stadium. Each balloon signified one of the 2,000 women in the Greater Manchester area diagnosed with breast cancer each year. Prevent Breast Cancer were able to use their ¬£50,000 funding to establish a temporary prevention centre at Withington Hospital. = Stagecoach Manchester = To celebrate the launch of their new partnership in October 2015, Prevent Breast Cancer decorated a Stagecoach Manchester bus with a 26-metre long, four-layered tutu which was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the \\"World's Largest Tutu\\". A staff vote saw Stagecoach Manchester select Prevent Breast Cancer as their chosen charity for two years and the company raised ¬£21,000.  Fundraising Events = Stars In Their Eyes = On 2 June 2018 Stars in their Eyes, the musical talent show in which amateur lookalikes and soundalikes impersonate their favourite singer, returned for one night only, in aid of Prevent Breast Cancer. The live revival special was held at The Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester, and enabled over 630 audience members to watch past contestants perform, including the very first winner Maxine Barrie, who won awards impersonating Dame Shirley Bassey in a TV Documentary called The Real Shirley Bassey. The show was recreated as accurately as possible, and all branding usage rights were granted by ITV and Endemol Shine. Most of the original production crew worked on the show, which was hosted by original host Matthew Kelly. Over ¬£32,000 was raised for the charity.

Making his professional debut in January 1950, he reached the top makuuchi division in May 1954. His highest rank was sekiwake. He won four special prizes and three gold stars for defeating yokozuna. He retired in January 1964 and became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association under the name of Onoe. Career Born in Nishikasugai District, Aichi, in the town of Nishibiwajima, he was spotted by scouts on a 1949 regional tour of Nagoya and joined Takasago stable in January 1950. Initially he fought under his own surname of Yui, but in 1952 changed his shikona to Wakamaeda, with the second kanji of Maeda taken from his stablemaster, the former yokozuna Maedayama. He reached the j≈´ry≈ç division in March 1953 and the top makuuchi division in May 1954. In his top division debut he was suffering from acute appendicitis from Day 9 but managed to stay in the tournament with pain-killing injections, and only withdrew on Day 13 once he had clinched a majority of wins against losses, or kachi-koshi. In May 1955 he defeated Yoshibayama in his first ever bout against a yokozuna, earning his first kinboshi, and he made his sanyaku debut at komusubi in January 1958, after a strong 11‚Äì4 record in the previous tournament. His komusubi debut was a memorable one as he defeated two yokozuna (Yoshibayama and Kagamisato) and was awarded the Fighting Sprit prize. Two 10‚Äì5 records in the next two tournaments, which included wins over yokozuna Wakanohana and Chiyonoyama, saw him move up to sekiwake and win two more Fighting Spirit prizes. However his quest for ≈çzeki promotion was ended when he scored only 5‚Äì10 in July 1958. He returned to komusubi in January 1959, defeating Tochinishiki and winning the Technique prize, and was promoted back to sekiwake for the March 1959 tournament, but narrowly failed to get a majority of wins. His 3‚Äì12 at komusubi in the following May 1959 tournament was his final appearance in the sanyaku ranks. He was to win two further kinboshi, both against Wakanohana, in November 1960 and January 1962. He was finally demoted from the top division in September 1963 after a poor 2‚Äì13 score.

Now, Mrs. Watson suggests that she and Charlotte open \\"Sherlock's\\" consultations to the general public, with Charlotte playing the role of Sherlock's sister, ministering to her fictitious brother while he is bedridden with illness. = Part Two = When Lady Shrewsbury (Roger Shrewsbury's domineering mother), dies soon after a violent argument with Charlotte's older sister, Olivia, Charlotte becomes alarmed that \\"Livia\\" or her parents will be suspected in the death. \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" writes a letter to Scotland Yard, suggesting a connection between Lady Shrewsbury's death, and the deaths, occurring within weeks of each other, of Lady Amelia Drummond and The Honourable Harrington Sackville. All three victims were connected by family or marriage ties, and all three appeared to have died from an accidental overdose of chloral hydrate. Inspector Treadles, a firm believer in \\"Sherlock Holmes\\"' abilities, investigates Sackville's death more closely, but does not find any definite proof of foul play until a consultation with \\"Holmes\\" via Charlotte, leads him to discover that the local doctor's supply of strychnine ‚Äì the most effective antidote for an overdose of chloral ‚Äì was removed before the night of Mr. Sackville's death. Charlotte's consultation business and Treadles's investigation overlap when she realizes that one of her clients, Mrs. Marbleton, who claims to be looking for her absent husband, is actually a woman named Sophia Lonsdale, who was disgraced by an affair with a married man (much the same way Charlotte herself was) and fled to Europe twenty years earlier. She has returned to England, and fabricated a case for \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" to discover more about \\"his\\" progress in the Sackville case. Treadles eventually confronts Sackville's valet, Hodges, who admits to poisoning Sackville with arsenic, but with the intent of incapacitating, not killing, him. Hodges had learned that Sackville was a paedophile who frequented an illegal brothel in London, offering underage girls. Hodges was trying to prevent Sackville from visiting the brothel until Hodges could discover its exact location and report it to the police. Armed with this revelation, Charlotte solves the case: Sackville molested his niece, Clara, as a young girl, then discarded her after she reached adolescence. Clara killed herself at age 14, leaving behind a diary which her friend never read, but passed upon her own death to Ms. Lonsdale. Reading it, Ms. Lonsdale learned not only of Sackville's actions, but that Lady Shrewsbury and Amelia Drummond had discovered Sackville, but kept silent for their own selfish reasons. Ms. Lonsdale visited each of them and offered the same choice: public exposure, or suicide. All three chose the latter. Ms. Lonsdale has already left the country, but enough of the truth is revealed to clear the Holmes family of suspicion in Lady Shrewsbury's death. Livia proposes that Charlotte write a fictionalized account of the case. Charlotte declines, but encourages Livia to do so. Reception Sarah Wendell, reviewing the book for NPR, said \\"You'll probably finish it, and start the first page over again, because it's that good.\\" Constance Grady for Vox gave it two and a half stars saying \\"A Study in Scarlet Women has a killer premise, some interesting character work, and a regrettably poorly structured plot.\\" Book riot listed it as one of their \\"favorite under-the-radar-books\\" of the year.

The fee goes toward the upkeep and maintenance of airports, and is setup and capped according to US federal law. The law allows airports to charge up to $4.50 for every enplaned passenger at public agency-controlled commercial airports. Airports must use the money from the fees to pay for projects approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that, according to the FAA, \\"enhance safety, security, or capacity; reduce noise; or increase air carrier competition.\\"  History  Beginning June 1, 1992, commercial airports that were controlled by public agencies began collecting passenger facility charges. The charges were added to airline tickets and, at the time, were $3 per passenger, per leg. Effective 2001, due to passage of the Wendell H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century, Congress raised the PFC cap to $4.50 per ticket or $18 per round trip. Each month, the FAA publishes the \\"Key Passenger Facility Charge Statistics\\". The report summarizes the annual amounts given to airlines by the airports that collect the PFCs. When the PFC program began, airlines were given 12 cents out of each PFC. In 1994, that amount went down to 8 cents. Between 2000 and 2004, the rate increased to 11 cents. President Barack Obama, in his 2015 budget request, asked for the cap on fees to be raised to $8, which is slightly less than what airports had wanted.  Statistics  In 2017, it was estimated that airports across the U.S. charged $260 million in passenger facility fees per month. The estimated collection in all of 2017 was $3.264 billion; in 2018, it was $3.367 billion.https://www.faa.gov/airports/pfc/monthly_reports/media/stats.pdf In 2014, the collection was approximately $3 billion.  Legislation and lobbying  In early 2017, Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced a bill, the \\"Investing in America: Rebuilding America's Airport Infrastructure Act\\", which would allow airports to increase PFCs. The bill would eliminate the $4.50 cap per flight segment. In exchange, funding for federal Airport Improvement Program grants would be reduced from $3.35 billion per year to $2.95 billion. In 2016, a measure to increase the PFC cap to $8.50, which was backed by airport and travel industry trade groups, failed. In June 2017, airports asked President Donald Trump to remove the PFC cap, \\"painting it as a way to raise money for infrastructure improvements while also making airports more self-sufficient,\\" according to The Hill newspaper.  Debate over a PFC increase = Opponents = In 2014, the year before Congress was set to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, the airline industry lobbied against a $4 increase in PFCs. Airlines for America, the trade association representing major U.S. airlines, argued that a fee increase would amount to an undue tax that would reduce demand for air travel. The association argued that airports have plenty of resources to fund their taxes and that travelers already paid enough in special taxes and fees. A representative from Airlines for America told the Huffington Post that the debate over increasing PFCs was really a disagreement about how airport infrastructure projects should be funded. In response to comments from the trade association representing airports that airlines were being hypocritical in opposing a PFC increase, the airline industry responded, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a difference between charging someone directly for an optional service and a PFC, which is not optional. We consider a government-imposed tax much different than an optional fee.‚Äù = Supporters = During the 2014 fight before Congress, airports argued that the $4.50 per flight cap no longer carried the same purchasing power as it did when it was set in 2000. Airports wanted the limit raised to $8.50 per flight and indexed to inflation. Airports pushed back at the airline industry's arguments, saying that airlines aren't \\"in a place to talk about fees.\\" A lobbyist for airports told the Huffington Post, \\"Airlines for America has been really hyperventilating about increasing the PFC.\\" According to Airports Council International, a trade association for airports, PFCs \\"have become a foundation of airport capital investment, funding projects that benefit their local communities and meet airline and passenger demands to accommodate future growth and improve levels of service. Airports need to build now to meet the needs of the estimated one billion passengers who will use the U.S. aviation system by 2015.\\"http://www.aci- na.org/static/entransit/Passenger%20Facility%20Charges%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf ReferencesExternal links * PFC Statute (49 U.S.C.

He was one of two known Allied soldiers killed in the line of duty on the border of West Berlin and East German territory between the beginning of the joint occupation of Berlin in summer 1945 and the beginning of the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961. Death Staff was on a private trip with two other soldiers and two young women. All three soldiers were wearing uniforms, and in an automobile that was clearly marked as an official US Forces vehicle. On the Hauptstra√üe in Gatow (in the British occupation sector), near the border between West Berlin and the GDR, they got lost; it remained disputed whether or not they were actually in East German territory. Once the occupants realized that they were lost, and attempted to return to Gatow, they were fired upon by two East German border guards and a Soviet soldier who were posted at the nearby East German border checkpoint. Several bullets hit the car, and Staff was severely wounded by a bullet in his head. His friends took him to the military hospital at the British airfield in Gatow, where Staff died a short time later as a result of the shots. An American newspaper stated that the vehicle had driven up to the checkpoint, clearly in East German territory, so the driver could ask for directions. It stands to reason that the driver overlooked the hazard of the new border, and did not expect the zeal with which the East German guards and the protective power of their Soviet masters defended the sovereignty of the newly established German Democratic Republic, or the unexpected shooting of a clearly marked military vehicle. Aftermath The following day, the American Commandant of Berlin, Major General Maxwell D. Taylor, lodged a formal protest with the Soviet Commandant of Berlin, Major General Alexander Kotikov, in a letter that he delivered personally to his Soviet counterpart. In his letter, General Maxwell protested the unnecessary brutality against members of the armed forces of a friendly nation. This also punctuated the official attitude of the US Government, which did not recognize the establishment of the GDR or its government, and regarded the Soviet authorities as the only legitimate authority in East Germany. A few days later, the Deputy Soviet Commandant of Berlin, Colonel Ivan Yelisarov, answered the protest, stating that the soldiers refused to identify themselves, and since the guards were busy with another vehicle, they took the opportunity to flee. The driver ignored warning shots. The border guards had targeted only the tires, and Staff was hit accidentally. This closed the case for the Soviet side. Coverage of the shooting in Berlin newspapers was very limited, with extremely brief news articles. Coverage of the American protest was broader, probably due to the clear words that General Taylor had used. The meager coverage was initially surprising, but in Berlin in 1949 it was the norm. The Tagesspiegel headlines were devoted to the European Recovery Plan and resources provided by the Marshall Plan for Berlin, diplomatic tensions between France and Poland, and strikes in France initiated by the Communist Union. On the other hand, coverage of this incident in the American press was much greater. The California-based and surprisingly well-informed Madera Tribune reported on this event far more extensively than the Berlin press just after the event. The Daily Illini and Mt. Vernon Register newspapers in Illinois, Staff's home state, reiterated the Soviet response to Taylor's protest. Nationwide newspapers such as the Pennsylvania-based Sunday Independent and the New York Herald Tribune also reported on the exchange of notes between the two Allied city commanders. Burial Staff is buried at the Ramsey Cemetery in his hometown.

Born in Market Weighton near Kingston-upon-Hull,1911 England Census Kneeshaw became a bricklayer and joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He moved to Birmingham to become a full- time organiser for the ILP, and in 1911 was elected to the city council, serving until 1919. He served for several years as the Midlands representative on the National Administrative Council of the ILP, and was also active in the Union of Democratic Control. He was adopted as the Labour Party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Birmingham West in 1914. The expected election was not held due to World War I. Kneeshaw opposed the war, and was fined ¬£51 for distributing anti-war leaflets. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election, Kneeshaw contested Birmingham Ladywood. He took second place, behind Neville Chamberlain, but only 19.0% of the vote. He became the ILP's Organising Secretary in 1922. He stood again for Labour in the 1926 Howdenshire by- election, only handing his nomination papers in ten minutes before the deadline, as he mistakenly believed they should be delivered to Beverley, rather than Pocklington. He polled poorly, taking third place and losing his deposit. In 1928, Kneeshaw became the Labour Party's Lancashire Area Organiser, and soon fell into conflict with the ILP, which complained that he was acting as a \\"witchfinder\\" attempting to disqualify left-wing ILP members from Parliamentary candidacies. The post was broadened to North West Regional Organiser in 1931, and Kneeshaw remained in the role until his retirement. During World War II, he served as Welfare Officer for miners in Whitehaven.

Manuscript The manuscript is found in the Biblioteca Palatina, Parma, Italy.Parma MS de Rossi 933, source The catalog editor (de Rossi) categorized the manuscript as a copy of Sefer Mitzvot Katan by Isaac of Corbeil. As a result, the manuscript was ignored for many years. In the 1970s, the manuscript was rediscovered and printed (by Machon Yerushalayim). The manuscript contains novellae to the Talmudic tractates Berachot, Megillah, Beitzah, Pesachim, Avodah Zarah, Gittin, Sanhedrin, Niddah, Bava Metzia, and Kiddushin. It also contains a reference to the author's novellae on Ketubot, indicating that the author also produced novellae on additional tractates. The author The author's identity is unknown. He mentions ideas in the name of his father, his brother-in-law R' Aharon, and his friends R' Avraham, R' Yitzhak, and R' Yisrael. Beyond this, no biographical details are known about him. Tosafists mentioned in the work As with all Tosafist compositions, the author collected interpretations from other Tosafists and other commentators, including R' Shemaiah, RIBaN, Rabbeinu Tam, Rashbam, Ri HaZaken, Shitah √âvreux, and his father and brother-and-law. English Tosafists mentioned in the work are: R Moshe ben Yom Tov of London (author of the work \\"Tosefet Alfasi\\" on the Rif), and his sons R' Eliyahu of London and R' Berechiah de Nicole, R' Meir ben Eliyahu de Nicole, R' Yosef de Nicole, R' Meir of London, and more. The author also quotes from Kobetz Leviah, an anonymous Tosafist collection. That work mentions English Tosafists, though it is not known whether its author was English. About the work The work, like other commentaries of the Rishonim, deals primarily with the simple meaning of the Talmudic sugyot. The author focuses on Rashi and analyzes the latter's concise language. The work includes many halachic rulings. Among them, in the chapter Keitzad Mevarchim in Berachot it mentions rulings regarding the blessings before food. Like all Tosafist works, this work copies from other Tosafists, and has many parallels to other Tosafist works. At the same time, it is often worded differently from other works, which occasionally affects the meaning.

Spyer is the author of Days of the Fall: A Reporter's Journey in the Syria and Iraq Wars (Routledge, 2017), based on his numerous trips to Syria and Iraq, and The Transforming Fire: The Rise of the Israel-Islamist Conflict (Bloomsbury, 2010). Bio Spyer was raised in London. He is of Russian Jewish and Asian heritage. Spyer immigrated to Israel from Britain in 1991. He earned a PhD in International Relations from the London School of Economics and a master's degree in Middle East Politics from the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) in London. From 1992 to 1993, he served in the 188th Armored Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces and fought in the 2006 Lebanon War as a reservist. During that war, Spyer narrowly escaped death when his tank was hit by two Kornet missiles, while deployed in a valley beneath the town of Al-Khiam. Spyer resides in Jerusalem. In September, 2020, Spyer revealed that he had been banned from travel to the USA, on the grounds of Section 212 of the US Immigration and Nationality Act 'which prohibits issuance of a visa to a person who at any time engaged in terrorist activities or was associated with a terrorist organization.' Spyer wrote of his suspicion that his acquaintance with senior officials of the PKK might have been the cause of the ban. ' Career YPG fighters in Ras al-Ayn, northeastern Syria.

In the 2010s, Spyer has traveled to Syria and Iraq numerous times, generally for around two-week periods. He has spent about half the time of his trips in Kurdish-held areas. These experiences were the basis for Spyer's 2017 book, Days of the Fall: A Reporter‚Äôs Journey in the Syria and Iraq Wars, published by Routledge. In October 2014, Spyer revealed evidence of possession and use of chemical weapons, likely mustard gas, by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), in northern Syria. In June, 2015, Spyer traveled with the Iraqi Shia militia Ktaeb Hizballah in Iraq's Anbar Province and observed the militia in action against Islamic State forces.

Recognized as an anti racism organization by the French court system, the organization has brought several cases before court and won a few cases in the Court of Cassation in the 1990s, but has had little legal success more recently.  Background  A change to the Law on the Freedom of the Press of 29 July 1881 in 1972 outlawed hate speech and gave anti-racist organizations the right to bring charges in such cases. The provision, known as Loi Pleven, was generally understood to protect vulnerable minorities and all cases brought before the Court of Cassation (France) before 1993 involving minorities, but the law was written in race neutral language.  History  Following electoral successes for Jean Marie Le Pen and Front National (FN), AGRIF was started by a member of the European Parliament for FN, Bernard Antony, in 1984 to fight against what the organization referred to as anti- French and anti-Christian racism. Antony was a leader for the traditionalist Catholic and integrist fraction of FN.Hugo Frey (2014) Nationalism and the Cinema in France: Political Mythologies and Film Events p. 212Peter Davies (1999) The National Front in France: Ideology, Discourse and Power p. 29 He later left the party in 2008 and ran unsuccessfully for Party of France the following year. After a legal waiting period after establishment of five years, AGRIF brought a case for recognition as an anti-racism organization for court in 1989. A tribunal court in Paris initially refused to accept the organization's legal standing as it didn't consider it a legitimate anti- racism organization, but this decision was overturned by the appellate court of Paris and, on 16 April 1991, the Court of Cassation recognized AGRIF as having legal standing as an anti-racism organization, stressing the neutral language of the hate speech regulation that the court found did not exclude non-majority groups like French people and Christians from being possible subjects of punishable racism.  Court cases  AGRIF sued writer Marek Halter and the Le Figaro for defamation against Catholics for an assertion in the newspaper by Halter that the Catholic churches in Eastern Europe were \\"archaic, xenophobic, often racist and anti-semitic.\\"; alternatively, as a single article, pp. 20-21. The appellate court of Paris acquitted Halter and Le Figaro on the basis that the statement only referred to some Catholic churches at a certain place and time and did not refer to Catholicism itself. The case came for the Court of Cassation in 1993. AGRIF referred to a 1991 Court of Cassation decision where the court had found that accusations that American Jews exploited Holocaust for their own interest constituted hate speech against Jews even if the statement only referred to a sub-group of Jews, and argued that this also meant that statements that only targeted part of the Catholic community could constitute hate speech. The Court of Cassation, citing both its 1991 decision on AGRIF and its 1991 decision on American Jews, ruled that Halter's statement about the Eastern Churches targeted Christians in Eastern Europe in a way that violated the hate speech provision. After a retrial at the appellate court of Orleans where Halter and Le Figaro were found guilty of defamation of Catholics, the Court of Cassation upheld the conviction in 1995. Yoram Dinstein Israel Yearbook on Human Rights: 1995 p. 408 In the mid-1990s, AGRIF also got the support of the Court of Cassation in three other cases of alleged anti-Catholic hate speech, including one case against Charlie Hebdo. After that time however, the Court of Cassation would mostly rule against AGRIF. Legal experts attribute this to a legal reform that made it easier to appeal decision to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) which more strongly tended to rule in favor of free speech, and did not typically interpret hate speech law to protect majority groups. In the 2006 Giniewski v. France case, the ECHR in a chamber judgement ruled that a civil case decision by the Orl√©ans Court of Appeal upheld by the Court of Cassation where Paul Giniewski had been obligated to pay one Franc to AGRIF as damage for implying Veritatis splendor could be linked to the Holocaust violated Article 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights.Press Release 31 January 206 CHAMBER JUDGMENT - GINIEWSKI v. FRANCE Council of Europe. The organization lost a case in a tribunal court in Avignon against Collection Lambert where AGRIF had demanded that Lambert removed a print version of the photograph Piss Christ as well as an internet version. AGRIF was instead ordered to pay Lambert 8000 euros for filing a prejudiced lawsuit.

Early life The eighth son of John Ibbetson Cooper, a coalfitter and shipowner, he was born on 13 September 1839, at Bishopwearmouth, County Durham. He was educated at the Grange School there, under James Cowan. He was then sent to a tutor in Sussex, where his health failed. Cooper was advised to take a voyage to Australia. There he made journeys into the outback. In 1859 he went to India, and worked in Madras, in the house of Arbuthnot & Co. In 1861 he left his appointment, and went to Sindh on a visit to a brother who was living there. The following year, he visited Bombay, and moved in by way of Beypore and Madras to Burma. At Rangoon he studied the Burmese language. In China In 1863 Cooper took ship to rejoin his brother, who was now at Shanghai. He became involved with the Shanghai volunteers of the Taiping Rebellion. When it ended, the opening up of China to foreign commerce proceeded. In 1868 Cooper, at the invitation of the Shanghai chamber of commerce, tried to travel through Tibet to India. On 4 January he left Hankou and travelled by way of Chengdu, Kangding, and Litang to Batang. From this point he had hoped to reach Rima on the Lohit River, over the Hengduan Mountains watershed, in eight days. The Chinese authorities then intervened, forbidding Cooper to continue westwards. He therefore decided to take the Dali City route to Bhamo. It involved at that time traversing the Panthay kingdom, the site of a Muslim insurgency, with its capital at Dali. Cooper therefore struck southwards, following the valley of the Lancang Jiang and reached Zegu on its western bank. This was the most westerly point that had been explored by Westerners starting from China, in the region of the major rivers north of Bhamo. Here he was within a hundred miles of Manchi (Mangkyi), then in Hkamti Long, a Shan state. It is on the N'Mai River, and had been visited by the military surveyor Richard Wilcox, from India, in 1826. Still continuing his journey southwards, Cooper arrived at Weixi City, nearly due west of Lijiang, where he obtained passports for Dali City. At a distance of three days' journey from Weixi, however, he was stopped by a local chief, who refused to allow him to proceed. He was compelled, therefore, to return to Weixi, where he was imprisoned and threatened with death by the civil authorities: he was suspected of being in touch with the Panthay rebels. For five weeks he was kept prisoner, and was then (6 August) allowed to depart. Cooper then returned to Ya'an, and travelled down the Min River to Yibin, on the Yangzi River. He descended the Yangzi to Hankou, where he arrived on 11 November 1868. He shortly returned to England. 1869 expedition Having failed to reach India from China, Cooper attempted in 1869 to reverse the process, and to enter China from Assam. On this journey he left Sadiya in October of that year, and passing up the line of the Brahmaputra, through the Mishmi country, reached Prun, a village about twenty miles from Rima. Here he again met with such determined opposition from the authorities, that he was obliged to turn back. Later career and death Shortly after his return to England, Cooper was appointed by the India Office to accompany the Panthay mission which had visited London to the frontier of Yunnan. On arriving at Rangoon, however, he learned that the rebellion had been crushed, and his mission was therefore at an end. Lord Northbrook appointed him political agent at Bhamo. Ill-health then obliged him to return almost immediately to England, where he was attached to the political department of the India Office. In 1876 Cooper was sent to India with despatches and presents to the viceroy in connection with the imperial durbar of Delhi, and was subsequently reappointed political agent at Bhamo. While there (1877) he welcomed William Gill, author of River of Golden Sand, after his journey through China. Cooper was murdered on 24 April 1878 at Bamo by a sepoy of his guard, over a grudge.

It is found in deep water in the Atlantic Ocean where it lives on the seabed, feeding on small invertebrates. Description D. atlanticus has a disc-shaped, vertically compressed body with a flat ventral surface, and grows to a standard length of . The dorsal fin, which is set far back near the tail, has no spines and five to seven soft rays, and the anal fin has no spines and four soft rays. The pectoral fins are robust and held at right angles to the body; they are limb-like and are used to \\"walk\\" over the seabed, and the more slender pelvic fins serve the same purpose. Under the operculum there is a sturdy multi-pointed spine. The bases of the fins, apart from the dorsal fin, are decorated with tubercles (cone-shaped scales) and the ventral surface of the disc is covered by distinct scales. The dorsal surface of the fish is usually a uniform reddish-grey, but specimens in the eastern Atlantic sometimes have reticulated markings. The ventral surface is paler. Distribution and habitat D. atlanticus is found in both the western and eastern Atlantic Ocean. Its range extends from the coasts of Canada and the United States, southwards through the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico to South America, as far south as Rio de Janeiro. In the eastern Atlantic its range includes northwestern Ireland and extends southwards to the Gulf of Guinea and Angola. Its depth range is from , but it is most common between . It is a bathypelagic species found on the seabed on muddy and sandy sediments. Biology This fish may be bioluminescent, as there has been a report that in the laboratory, its skin can emit flashes of light when stimulated with peroxidase, but this effect has not been observed in living specimens. It lures prey to the vicinity of its mouth; its diet consists of small invertebrates such as polychaete worms, amphipods, clams, starfish, brittle stars and sea spiders. Status This deep sea fish is of no interest to commercial fisheries but it is often caught in deep water trawl surveys and appears to be common.

The project celebrated the Municipal Art Society's centennial and was completed in 2004. The sculpture was given to the City as a gift. Critical reception Male/Female has generated considerable controversy ever since its installation. Its defenders cite the contemporary imagery and artistic expression as complementing an urban landscape, while opponents criticize what they decry as a clash with Penn Station's Beaux-Arts architecture, detracting from its classic lines. It has been named both Baltimore's kinkiest piece of public art, \\"The Invasion of the 50-Foot She-Male\\" that \\"bends genders and may very well affirm life\\", and one of the city's best \\"bizarre\\" statues. The Baltimore Sun editorially characterized it as \\"oversized, underdressed, and woefully out of place\\" at the time of its unveiling. Two years later, the Sun continued its criticism, saying: Baltimore Sun columnist Dan Rodricks also ridiculed the artwork, writing on August 26, 2007, \\"Patrons of art here paid $750,000 for a 51-foot sculpture ... that looks like Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still. I look at it and want to say: 'Klaatu barada nikto!'

She was launched as hull #101 on June 23, 1888. There is a story that as Barge 101 was being launched in Duluth, McDougall's wife Emmelin said to her sister in law, \\"There goes our last dollar\\". This was because McDougall had trouble finding investors for this unusual ship. With no investors, he had to spend his own money on building and financing the building of these vessels. In 1889. Barge 101 was lengthened by the American Steel Barge Company of Superior, Wisconsin to 191-feet in length. She grounded at Lime Kiln, near Detroit in April 1892, and immediately was filled with water. Workers started raising her shortly after the incident. In 1903 she was sold to the Barret Manufacturing Company for ocean service. In 1906 she was purchased by the Coast Transit Company of New Jersey.

He was born circa 1796 to a French father, Bernard Belanger (b.c. 1760), and a Nakoda mother, Kakakewachin (b. 1765) near Slave Lake in what is now the province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Due to the dwindling buffalo population caused by excessive hunting, he was forced to look for new strategies to ensure the survival of his people and their culture. The loss of the buffalo threatened his people and he believed that the only way to save his people would be to negotiate with the Canadian Government. He held great influence over his people and it was due to this influence that he, and his close ally Ahtahkakoop, were able to argue successfully for the adoption of Treaty 6 by his fellow Cree. Mistawasis made history as the first signatory of Treaty 6. After the treaty was signed he remained an ally of the Canadian government until his death.  Early life  The exact date of Mistawasis‚Äô birth is disputed. Estimations indicate that may have been born sometime between 1796 and 1813. The location of his birth was in the area of Slave Lake, Saskatchewan. He was born to a French father by the name of Bernard Belanger and a woman of Assiniboine descent. His birth name was Pierre Belanger, though it was rarely used in his adulthood. He had siblings, though the exact number is unknown, one of them went by the same name as their father, Bernard Belanger. Mistawasis married Iskwesis Sitipinatowe and had at least two children. He then married Ann Awasis Mashe Nah Sho Wishk (b. 1800) and had 5 children. The Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) would utilize his prowess as a provider, commonly trading for buffalo meat in exchange for other goods. He also worked as a freighter for the HBC. He was known to some as Piwapiskomostos, a name meaning \\"Iron Buffalo\\". He received this name after a hunting accident where he was tossed from horseback onto one of the buffalo he was hunting. Despite this he sustained no injuries from the encounter, earning him the moniker of Piwapiskomostos. The famous Cree Chief Pitokwahanapiwiyin (Poundmaker) is his maternal nephew.  Disappearance of the Buffalo  The American buffalo's habitat once ranged in the general area from the American east coast, south-west to near Mexico, and northwards to Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. They are the largest land mammals found on the continent of North America. The Buffalo's first contact with Europeans most likely occurred in the 1500s when they were spotted by Spanish conquistadors. Estimates suggest that at this time there was roughly 25-30 million wild buffalo living in North America. This number would dwindle severely to less than 100 in the American Great Plains states by the 1880s, with between 10-15 million dying over a ten-year period. In Canada the buffalo were most commonly hunted for the purpose of acquiring their skins or for preserving the animals meat for later ingestion in the form of pemmican. The fur trade was especially detrimental to populations as the hunters would, more often than not, prioritize acquiring the furs of the females over that of the males. This was due to their relative lightness as well as the ability to tan the furs at a quicker rate then the males. The majority of hunts were carried out in the winter, due to the buffalo's hair growing thicker in this time of the year. Winter happened to coincide with the buffalo's breeding season, meaning that many of the buffalo killed had a high possibility of being in some stage of pregnancy at the time. Being that buffalo only have one calf per year, the removal of large numbers of pregnant buffalo significantly weakened the animal's ability to naturally replenish its population. = Significance of Buffalo to Cree = One of the most important features of the Cree's way of life was the buffalo. It was a resource which was used extensively by the Cree for many different purposes. Its meat was used as food for personal sustenance as well as for trade with the Hudson's Bay Company. Its skin was used in the construction of living quarters. It was also used by the various indigenous groups of the region to make clothing, amounting to roughly two buffalo skins per person per year to be dedicated to the production of new clothing. The animal's bones were often used to create most of the tools used by the Cree people. Buffalo were important for trade with the Hudson's Bay Company as this trade was the only possible way for the Cree to acquire such useful goods as guns, as well as the ammunition needed to use the weapons. The Cree would hunt buffalo often without horses, to over come the difficulties associated with this they would often herd the animals into corrals so they could then kill them in a more manageable way. = Buffalo Wars = The sudden decrease in buffalo further destabilized the region by causing the Cree to trespass into Blackfoot territory in search of buffaloes. This trespassing would often lead to skirmishes between the two groups which could often end in loss of life on both sides. This fighting included numerous battles which resulted in the deaths of many Cree warriors. The Cree and Blackfoot would see peace in 1857, though it was short lived and war was restarted in 1860. The Cree would continue to use the war as a means to venture west, in search of the buffaloes which no longer existed in their homelands. The war would then continue in a sporadic and destructive nature until a permanent peace was finally signed in 1871. The war had caused extensive loss of life for the Cree and failed to result in the expansion of their territory to the buffalo rich areas of the west. Area Covered by Treaty 6 (In Light Green)  Treaty 6  The sudden loss of an abundance of buffalo caused fear to spread throughout native communities in the 1870s. It was from this fear, and a hope for the future, that Mistawasis began to think about what he wanted his people's future to look like. It was from this perspective that Mistawasis and other leaders of the Cree communities began to believe that negotiation with the Canadian Crown Authorities would be their best course of action. One of the items Mistawasis hoped to acquire for his people was access to education. He perceived a European education as important to the future survival of his people and attempted to gain access to this through the Canadian government. He wanted to ensure that his people would be provided not only with school houses but also the teachers to operate and instruct in them. It was due to this belief that his peoples' way of life was disappearing along with his hope of an improved future that caused him to attend the negotiations at Fort Carlton in late August 1876. The British crown was represented by several men with British Treaty Commissioner Alexander Morris taking the leading role. Mistawasis argued for the treaty as a necessity for acquiring food by claiming that \\"Our way of living is gone, there are no more buffalo, we have to find a new way to feed our people.\\" During much of the treaty negotiation process, Mistawasis' points of view were shared by his friend and ally Ahtahkakoop. Ahtahkakoop, like Mistawasis, was also concerned about the decrease in available buffalo. Ahtahkakoop was also quite interested in obtaining an education for his people, as well as help in gaining a better understanding of agriculture to fill the void in food left by the disappearance of the buffalo. Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop were met with resistance by other Chiefs of the Cree nation. The Cree Chief Poundmaker disagreed with the ideas of Mistawasis. He was supported by other dissenting opinions of Chiefs Young Chipewyan, and The Badger. Poundmaker's main argument against the signing of the treaty was his belief that the Canadian government would only adhere to the Cree demands in exchange for hegemony over all of the Cree's lands, a price he did not want to pay. Mistawasis countered the argument of the chiefs who shared Poundmaker's outlook by challenging them to provide a better solution that what the Canadians were offering. Mistawasis further argued \\"‚Ä¶that the Great White Queen Mother has offered us a way of life when the buffalo are no more. Gone they will be before many snows have come to cover our heads or graves if such should be.\\" He further argued that the queen would \\"stop the senseless wars among our people, against the Blackfoot, Peigans, and Bloods.\\" He also believed that by allying himself with the Queen that he could restrict the sale of alcohol to his people, a goal that he was personally passionate about. On top of all this he argued that none of them could hope to survive in the face of the increasing flow of immigrants from the east on their own. Mistawasis ended his argument by declaring \\"I for one will take the hand that is offered.\\" Ahtahkakoop shared the same sentiments as Mistawasis. After presenting his points to the other Chiefs, Mistawasis became the first of the men gathered to sign Treaty 6. The other Cree Chiefs were swayed by the word of Mistawasis and Ahtahkakoop and agreed to sign the treaty, which would from then on be known as Treaty 6. Treaty 6 would later be added onto by other members of the Cree nation at Fort Pitt in September 1876. = The provisions of Treaty 6 = When the initial stage of Treaty 6 was complete it contained many provisions which were favorable to the Cree people. It contained all rights and protections previously awarded in Treaties One through Five. This meant that the Cree were entitled to: monetary compensation/assistance from the federal government, the establishment of reserve lands which were off limits to outsiders, they would be fully provided with farm equipment, and finally that their Chiefs would receive uniforms and medals befitting their positions. In addition to these basic tenets it also contained some additional decrees. In response to the dwindling buffalo populations, the Cree were promised protection if they were to suffer from famine during their conversion to agriculture, in other words the Canadian Government agreed to send food relief in times of need. The other major provision added to Treaty 6 was that each Indian agent would maintain a fully stocked medicine chest to be utilized by the Cree in the event of any disease outbreaks.  Later life  After the signing of Treaty 6, Mistawasis maintained a close relationship to the crown authorities. He used his power to attempt to stop the flow of alcohol into his people's territory, his work in doing so was one of the reasons the Canadian Government created the Northwest Mounted Police, to help in this venture. He is also responsible for the establishment of Mistawasis First Nation, which was named after him. Mistawasis would later allow a Presbyterian Mission to be established on his reserve. Mistawasis maintained a positive relationship with the Canadian Government during the 1885 Riel Rebellion, when he offered to defend the city of Prince Albert from any incursion by Riel. Mistawasis was in attendance at the unveiling of the Joseph Brant Memorial in 1886. During this visit to Ontario he met Prime Minister John A. MacDonald, and became enamored with the culture and technology of Canada.  Death  Like his birth date, the exact date of Mistawasis‚Äô death is also not known, although his final resting place is in the cemetery of the Presbyterian church built on his reserve. Dates of 1886, 1896, and 1903 have all been given as the true date. After his death he was succeeded as chief by George Dreaver, who remained Chief until he passed away in 1938. George was then succeeded by his son, and Mistawasis' grandson, Joe Dreaver who served as Chief of Mistawasis First Nation for 25 years.  Honours  The City of Saskatoon named its newest vehicular bridge the Chief Mistawasis Bridge on June 21, 2018.

History Rogers Ranch was named for Martha A. and C.M. Rogers, who had a ranch covering portions of Caldwell, Hays, and Travis counties in the 1880s. It was then divided into many different lots and was sold that next decade, and the portion in Caldwell County, which was the southeastern portion of the ranch, became the Rogers Ranch community. A majority of the families who bought the land in this area were German immigrants who came from nearby New Braunfels, and a church and a school were taught in both English and German for several years. New residents then came to the new, thriving community, and they were Mexican and Black. A combined bowling alley and community center was built in the settlement in 1910, but then burned down a decade later, in 1920. There were several separate church and school campuses for White, Black, and Mexican families living in the settlement until either the 1930s or 1940s. The schools in the community were then joined up with the Lockhart Independent School District in 1950. Larger farms bought the other family farms in Rogers Ranch, and only about two or three cemeteries were the only things in the settlement in the early 1960s.

The team (when it was known as NextGen Motorsports) has also competed in the ARCA Menards Series East and NASCAR Xfinity Series in the past. Xfinity Series In 2017, the team made their first foray into the series, helping MBM Motorsports to field two of their drivers in MBM's Nos. 13/40 cars at the road-course races: Enrique Baca at Watkins Glen and Mid-Ohio and Ernie Francis Jr. at Road America. Later that year, NextGen fielded an Xfinity team on their own for the first time, the No. 55 Toyota, in two races. Their first attempt was at Kansas in mid-October with Josh Berry, finishing 33rd. The second attempt was at Homestead with Matt Mills, but he did not qualify for the race. Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series In 2018, NextGen made their Truck debut, initially planning to do so at Martinsville in March 2018 when they entered the No. 35 Chevrolet for Travis Kvapil, but the team wound up withdrawing the entry when there was rain in the forecast and they would have failed to qualify due to having no owner points. They later attempted the race at Kentucky, fielding the No. 83 for Tyler Matthews in a partnership with Copp Motorsports. Matthews made contact with the wall on lap one and finished 32nd. NextGen announced on October 24, 2018 that Inspectra Thermal Solutions would sponsor Parker Kligerman at Texas Motor Speedway in the JAG Metals 350, however, Kligerman later decided to back out and Brennan Poole was named as his replacement.

However, due to lack of sponsorship, he only ended up attempting the season opener at Daytona that year. Vizion later ran the No. 35 at Charlotte with Devin Dodson. Also, Bobby Dale Earnhardt tried to run some races with the team, but sponsorship was not found. =Car No. 36 history= A second car for Vizion, the No. 36, driven by Paul Williamson, ran at Daytona along with the No. 35 of Queen. Salvatore Iovino was originally going to drive that car at Daytona as well as some other races throughout the season with sponsorship from Body Symmetry MD, which did not end up happening. In September 2019, it was reported by ThePitLane.com that Josh White signed with Vizion to potentially run the ARCA season opener at Daytona and some Truck races if the team can find sponsorship. This was later confirmed by the team on December 19, 2019. White will drive the No. 36 Toyota at Daytona and other races during the 2020 ARCA season, and possibly the full schedule if sponsorship is found.

His widow, Marie Kofoed, established a memorial foundation in his name- Early life Kofoed was born in Svaneke on Bornholm. He grew up on the Kofoedg√•rd estate in √òstermarie as the son of merchant Peder J√∏rgensen Kofoed (1707-1778). He moved to Copenhagen as a young man where he passed the Skippers' Guild's navigational exam on 16 December 1764. Career A few years later, he sailed as amate on the merchant ship Prinsesse Louis on St. Croix. He became captain of the ship in 1772 and was licensed as skipper that same year.. In the period 1772-1782, Kofoed completed a total of 10 voyages to St. Croix as a skipper.

Over the course of his 30-year career as a skipper, he owned shares in a total of 23 ships. He mainly imported sugar, rum and other colonial goods. He was also very active in the market for loans to the plantation owners on St. Croix. He sold his ships in 1807 after the war with England had made trading on the Danish West Indies less profitable. His two last ships were sold in 1809. Property In 1783, he purchased an old property overlooking Christianshavns Kanal in the Christianshavn district of Copenhagen.

Plot As described in a film magazine, Edmund Kean (Farnum), at the height of his popularity in London, has as his inspiration the Countess Koefeld (Bonillas). Among his devoted followers is Anna Damby (Shaw), whose guardian is attempting to force her into marriage with the roue Lord Melville (Carillo). Anna goes to Edmund for advice, and Melville's spy Needles (Boring) reports at a reception, given at the Koefeld home where the Prince of Wales (Herbert) is a guest, that Edmund has eloped with Anna. Edmund arrives shortly and refutes the rumor, and hands a note to Countess Koefeld asking her to come to his dressing room. Edmund advises Anna to forget her stage ambitions. He then announces a benefit performance for a crippled child. Meanwhile, Melville lures Anna to an inn with a decoy note that has Edmund's name, intending to kidnap her. Edmund, who was entertaining at the inn, thrashes the gang of kidnappers. On the night of the benefit the Countess goes to the Kean dressing room and makes violent love to him. Her husband the Count (McAllister) and the Prince of Wales later arrive, and the Count picks up a fan that his wife had left behind in the dressing room. Edmund, believing that the Prince is a rival for the affections of the Countess, begs him not to appear in the Koefeld box after the performance begins, but the Prince refuses. Edmund discovers that the fan is missing and, angered, refuses to go on. However, when Little Emily (Goodwin) hobbles in, he relents. Edmund sees the Prince in the Koefeld box and a fit of madness seizes him. He denounces the Prince from the stage and is carried fainting to his dressing room, his career apparently ended. Edmund tells Anna that his madness was feigned. Melville sends the police to arrest Edmund. The Prince and Count Koefeld arrive and the Prince, shielding Edmund, explains that he had borrowed the fan from the Countess. The Count apologizes to the actor.

Published in 1950, the manifesto paved the way for the government-controlled Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) of Protestants. This movement proclaimed the three principles of self-government, self-support, and self-propagation. The drafting and content of the manifesto was, and remains, controversial to this day. The manifesto was devised after Protestant leaders presented their concerns with religious freedom to Zhou Enlai, the Premier of China. Instead of receiving their report, Zhou demanded them to come up with a statement in support of the new communist leadership. Y. T. Wu and other leftist clergymen espoused the task and presented a draft manifesto that, after some opposition and changes, became a foundational text of Christianity in the new People's Republic. It condemns missionary activities in China as a form of imperialism, pledges loyalty to the communist leadership, and encourages the Church to take up an indigenous Chinese stance toward Christianity. Published on the front page of the People's Daily, the manifesto was accompanied by a campaign to gather signatures. Many Christian leaders and laymen signed, while others refused to do so. After the Korean War broke out, the campaign became an increasingly politicized test of loyalty that became merged with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries. Some view the manifesto as a betrayal of the Church, while others find sympathy for the position of Chinese Christians struggling to reconcile their faith with the changed political situations. The manifesto ended missionary activities in China and the separation of church and state. It led to the founding the TSPM and brought persecution to dissidents.  Background  After the declaration of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, religious life in mainland China was forced to adapt itself in relation to the new rulers. Of all religions in China, Christianity was particularly susceptible to such pressure, because its inherently foreign character made the government think of it as a political threat. The Communist Party of China (CPC) was compelled to draw up a plan to persecute Christians whose religion it viewed as an ideological competitor of Marxism, or at least, to make the Christian population politically accountable. At the same time, the Common Program adopted by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949, the de facto interim constitution of the PRC, guaranteed freedom of religion. Chinese Protestants dispatched envoys all over China to see how this provision was being met in practice. Upon their return, they planned to write a report about the situation and present it to the Chinese government. The Chinese church faced four problems in the changed reality: it was dependent on foreign funding, its confession was fundamentally at odds with the communist ideology, it was wary of how local CPC cadres would implement religious policy of the new government, and finally, the Church was uneasy with China's foreign policy of friendly ties with the Soviet Union. In order to exert control, the government supported those Christian groups that were willing to accommodate. One such group were Chinese Protestants who were based in Shanghai, headed by Y. T. Wu, the secretary of YMCA in China. Wu had envisioned transforming the Chinese church even before 1949: he developed ideas ranging from advocating the Social Gospel to Christian socialism and communism. The government's political goals thus coincided with his. The core ideas of The Christian Manifesto had already been presented by Wu in a 1948 article \\"The Present-Day Tragedy of Christianity\\". Similarly, in December 1949 Wu's associates published an open letter \\"Message from Chinese Christians to Mission Boards Abroad\\" that declared foreign missionary activities unwelcome in China and called for their legacy to be critically reassessed. Wu and his associates would implement the government's desires by publishing a document outlining Chinese Christianity in the new era. By late summer of 1950, The Christian Manifesto had become part of a campaign to establish the Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM) to replace its more outward-oriented predecessor, the National Christian Council of China (NCC). The TSPM would not be a church, but a government-sponsored parachurch organization directly controlled by the Religious Affairs Division (RAD, now State Administration for Religious Affairs), which in turn is under the United Front Work Department of the CPC. The role of the TSPM was, and still is, to ensure that Protestant churches approved by officials operate according to the government's religious policy.  History  Y. T. Wu (left) having a conversation with Mao Zedong in June 1950, between the approval and publication of \\"The Christian Manifesto\\" Y. T. Wu and other Shanghai churchmen were joined by Protestants from the northern regions of China to hold talks with Premier Zhou Enlai in May 1950. Some of the other Christian leaders included in the 19-strong delegation were Deng Yuzhi, T. C. Chao, and . Three such meetings were arranged, on the 2nd, 6th, and 13th, each lasting several hours. On the agenda were, most likely, all four problems of the church: reliance on foreign funding, irreconcilability of faith and the communist ideology, suspicion towards local party cadres, and resistance to China's friendly ties with the Soviet Union. It was, however, the local CPC cadres that were the church leaders' main concern and the reason they had requested audience with Zhou. The churchmen had prepared a letter to Zhou explaining the adversities faced by the church and likely hoped to get assurances of protection from him. Zhou, however, \\"turned the tables on them\\", insisting that they came up with a new document that supported the government instead. The delegation was forced to cancel its future appointments in the provinces and start working on the manifesto. At the final meeting, a first draft manifesto was presented by Wu and approved by the government. The manifesto had been largely composed by Wu. It is possible that Wu and Zhou had privately agreed on writing the manifesto beforehand. Wu was in contact with Zhou throughout drafting, but accusations at home and abroad that Zhou had personally penned the manifesto have proven unsubstantiated. Some attributed the work to Chen Xingui of the China Democratic League whose writings were very similar in content. Among the Protestant parties concerned, attitudes to the situation varied widely and so writing the manifesto had been \\"as painstaking as it was controversial\\". Churches in China protested the draft, and Wu was forced to make some changes, although he refused other suggestions on the grounds of time constraints. The draft ultimately went through several revisions, some of which were discussed with the leaders of the CPC in Beijing. Some members of the clergy were left discontent and they withdrew from the movement led by Wu. The manifesto was issued on 28 July. Later, on 23 September, it was published on the front page of the People's Daily; with editorials and signatures the release spanned three pages. Wide circulation followed. Over the subsequent days, the Christian magazine Tian Feng and other newspapers, particularly in Shanghai, published it as well. It was the publication in the newspaper of the CPC that made it an authoritative statement, however. Both the Chinese church and foreign missionaries were left out of the process from that point on. The publication was accompanied by a campaign among Protestants to collect signatures in support of it. = Signatures = The document's 40 original signatories were all church leaders, including T. C. Chao, Jiang Changchuan, , , Zhao Fusan, and . The initial publication in the People's Daily was accompanied by 1,527 signatures from Christian leaders. These names included Han Wenzao, Yu Zhihai, Zhu Guishen, and Sun Yanli. Tian Feng closely followed the success of the manifesto and the number of its signatories. By the end of August, more than 1,500 had signed, 3,000 by September and 20,000 by November. January 1951 saw the figure go up to 90,000 and April 180,000. The campaign ultimately reached 417,389 claimed signatories before the circulation was over, in 1954, amounting to about half of all Chinese Protestants. More than one million additional signatures were gathered after the official circulation had been concluded. The high number of signatures has since been disputed by journalist David Aikman and others. For instance, more Lutherans purportedly signed the document than were in existence in China. It has also been claimed that many names were included without consent. Regardless, the number of signatories can be interpreted in two ways: a relatively high number of signatories testifies to the success of Wu and the campaign to accommodate to the communist government. Conversely, the number of people who did not sign the manifesto count as people who did not want the Chinese church to sever its links with foreigners. It was feared that the NCC, which had facilitated cooperation between Chinese Protestants and foreign missionaries since 1922, would lose its independence. Most appear to have signed the document out of patriotic sentiments, not because of fundamental agreement with the actual provisions of the manifesto: not all were convicted Marxists. It is also possible that becoming a signatory was initially on a voluntary basis, but after the Korean War had broken out, doing so certainly became a test of loyalty that could not be avoided. The war resulted in the campaign rising to an unforeseen level of political urgency, and by early 1951 it had become mingled with the Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries. Similar intensification affected other government-led campaigns as well. After China's entry into the war, leaders of independent Chinese churches who refused to sign the manifesto began to be persecuted: they lost their churches, pastors were arrested, congregations forced underground, and dissidents were dragged to \\"denunciation meetings\\" that sometimes could result in imprisonment or execution. Though only a small number of Christians ended up being indicted or executed, the meetings were very humiliating for the dissidents. Some notable Protestant ministers, such as K. H. Ting, did not sign the document. In Ting's case, the reason remains unclear. He stated that he supported the document but said, nonetheless: \\"it just happened that I haven't signed it\\". It could have been that the reason was that he was abroad at the time of the manifesto's circulation. He could have, like many did, sign it after official circulation, but never did. This casts some doubt on his stated rationale. Wang Ming-Dao outright refused to sign The Christian Manifesto. This, and his deliberate failure to register his church with the RAD, led to his imprisonment for 23 years and ensued his worldwide fame. Robin Chen, too, refused to sign, although he took part in the activities of the TSPM later. Notably, Watchman Nee did sign, as did many members of his Little Flock church. Nee was able to gather as much as 34,983 signatures in total, though most of them had been for a petition against the nationalization of Little Flock property; Nee simply included them in The Christian Manifesto as well. The move proved to be controversial. Joseph Tse- Hei Lee thinks that Nee complied with the wishes of the campaign, but Tang Shoulin, an associate of Nee, has said that he was just trying to appear cooperative on the surface, but in reality sabotaged the campaign. The share of signatures gathered by Nee was 17% of total signatures of the manifesto at the time. Of earlier signatories of the manifesto, the largest segment had been members of the indigenous Jesus Family church. The NCC, which was the highest Protestant authority in the country, also signed the manifesto. After years of inactivity, the organization convened a meeting in October 1950. The meeting was initially scheduled for August, but proponents of The Christian Manifesto were able to postpone it in order to further the success of the manifesto. The preparatory committee of the meeting tried to fend off attempts to have the manifesto endorsed at the meeting, and even planned writing a counter-manifesto. Its efforts failed, and even though the TSPM was not even on the agenda of the meeting, it ended up unanimously supporting the manifesto and the TSPM, effectively terminating its own organization. It was the first meeting in history where all Chinese Protestants were represented, and so its signing of the manifesto was of special importance. From that point on the road was open for both the inception of the TSPM and the success of the manifesto. For China author Richard C. Bush, it was this moment rather than the initial publication that marked the manifesto's transforming of Chinese Christianity.  Content  The manifesto is short, less than 1,000 Chinese characters, and unambiguous in its message. The manifesto has four sections. The first section condemns Protestant missionary activities in China as a form of imperialism. The second part examines the task of the Church and sides with government policy. The third focuses on future aims of the Church in patriotic terms. The last section lays out concrete methods. The Christian Manifesto makes three central claims: first, the Chinese church should obey the new communist government and partake in the building of a \\"new China\\". Second, the church should cut its ties with Western \\"imperialism\\". Finally, the church should strive to construct a Christianity indigenous to China embodying the so-called \\"Three-self principles\\": self-government, self-support, and self- propagation. The manifesto urged Chinese Christians to pledge allegiance to the new People's Republic. Its main theme is anti-imperialism. The manifesto stresses that imperialism had used Christianity to extend its reach, \\"consciously or unconsciously, directly or indirectly\\", and that present-day Christianity ought to be \\"purged\\" from such tendencies. The United States is blamed for supporting reactionaries in the guise of religion. The wording of the manifesto remains controversial to this day. Written in \\"carefully measured and relatively polite\\" terms, it goes out of is way not to blame the church outright. The document urges Christians to accept the new communist reality, rather than to denounce their faith. The manifesto adopts the propagandistic language of the Chinese revolution resulting in overly optimistic and naive terms. It however failed to give the Chinese church any guidance concerning its future in China under the CPC. The manifesto implied that compliance would be rewarded and Chinese Christianity would prosper. In truth, the government would soon engage in persecution of many Christians. The manifesto was intended for both domestic and foreign audiences. The covering letter accompanying it states that its target audience is people outside the church and aims to educate them about the social and political position of Christianity in China.  Responses by other parties  Many, if not most, Chinese Protestants thought that the manifesto was too radical. The Methodist Church in China refused to sign the manifesto, as did, initially, the Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Church in China). Both issued alternative manifestos of their own. All Anglican bishops in China later caved in and signed The Christian Manifesto, and almost all of them became TSPM associates. Initially, foreign missionary societies were perplexed by the manifesto that had been preceded by mixed messages. It was labeled as a partisan work of a faction within the Chinese Church. China Inland Mission, naively, brushed off charges of imperialism on the grounds that churches they had founded were relatively independent. When it was discovered that even \\"devout believers\\" had signed the manifesto, it was attributed to political pressure. When missionaries finally realized the implications of the manifesto, they had no choice but to condemn it, regarding it as a unilateral termination of their relationship with Chinese Christians. Although Chinese Protestants took no immediate action against missions, the manifesto marked the beginning of the end. The manifesto did not specify a time frame for the end of missionary activities, other than \\"within the shortest possible time\\". Consequentially, new missionaries were called to China even after the manifesto had been issued. Missionary activities effectively ended in China after a tit-for-tat involving the Chinese and American governments. First, in November 1950, the United States forbade any transfer of funds to China. China retaliated by prohibiting organizations in the country from receiving funding from abroad. By December, both countries had frozen each other's assets. An immediate order to Chinese churches to cease all cooperation with foreign missionaries soon followed. Although Chinese Catholics were particularly defiant, they were as unable to resist as Protestants, their key positions having been domesticated by the government. Consequentially, the Catholics issued a manifesto very much like the Protestant one, in November 1950.  Further analysis  Affiliates of the Chinese house churches (unofficial Protestant churches not affiliated with the TSPM) and other critics of the manifesto think that it sold out Christianity in China to the political elites. Leslie Theodore Lyall, for instance, called it outright a \\"betrayal\\". Gao Wangzhi, however, points out that the manifesto paints a sympathetic picture of the Chinese church: its past allegiance to imperialism is called \\"unfortunate\\", and overall the church's contributions are recognized. Gao, however, concedes that the manifesto \\"misled\\" Chinese Christians into thinking that they would be well- off with the new government. Foreign missionaries went as far as calling the manifesto \\"the failure of Christian conscience in China\\". Gao argues that the manifesto is not to be entirely blamed on Wu. Rather, it was \\"a product of a particular time ‚Äì from 1948 to 1950 ‚Äì that witnessed the victory of the CCP and the establishment of the PRC\\". Similarly, Bob Whyte argues the manifesto was appropriate in its historical setting, as \\"[t]he tide of history had left them with no other choice\\". Chinese academics and the TSPM attribute the Chinese Church's modern successes to The Christian Manifesto. Official Chinese historiography claims that the initiative for The Christian Manifesto came from the Chinese Protestant church, and Premier Zhou Enlai merely granted their wish. According to George A. Hood, it is more likely that Zhou had effectively forced the church leaders to draft a manifesto in support of the government. Similarly, Oi Ki Ling attributes the church's role to public pressure. Philip Wickeri, however, points out that the talks with Zhou were initiated by the church. The project of securing religious freedom in China, although conditioned by Chinese patriotism, was thus a Christian endeavor instead of a government fiat. In other words, the church had assumed agency and independence in relation to the CPC within the united front. Wickeri also points to the absence of Ting's signature and the initial failure of other Anglicans to sign as proof of alternatives to total submission in the early TSPM. Ting managed to become the head of the organization, and other prominent Anglicans were given positions in the movement, too. Most experts think that the large number of signatories cannot be explained with reference to political convenience or pressure only. Robert G. Orr thinks that the number of signatories indicated that Chinese Christians agreed with the CPC with regard to its analysis of imperialism in China. In this sense, it was a self- imposed condemnation of the missionary past of the Chinese church. According to Wickeri, this was not necessarily a disadvantage, since it allowed the church to discover an indigenous Chinese identity and a new social conscience. This was central to the project of the TSPM as well. According to K. H. Ting, Chinese Christians genuinely espoused the \\"three-self\\" ideology. Chee Kong-Lee cites patriotism as the reason for the manifesto's success. A middle of the road position holds that Chinese Church leaders acted with the sincere aim to preserve the Church, but by signing the manifesto they had to compromise with the leaders of the country to achieve that end. Theologically, The Christian Manifesto reflects upon Wu's idea that the \\"Spirit of God\\" is discernible in the socio-political progress. According to Wickeri and Peter Tze Ming Ng, The Christian Manifesto is, however, not so much a theological treatise as it is a political statement. Wickeri contends that this was the only way that the church could make its position understood by the largely non-Christian Chinese population who shared their patriotism but not their religion. Before the manifesto, the Chinese Church had separated church and state matters, but according to Oi, The Christian Manifesto marked a turning point in this regard.

In 2018, he announced his candidacy for Chair of the Council of the District of Columbia. Early life and education Lazere attended Harvard and later earned a master's degree in public policy from the University of Maryland. Career Lazere was an inaugural staff member of DCFPI, which he joined in 2001 and has led since its inception. Previously, he held positions at Higher Achievement, an education advocacy group, and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a progressive think-tank with a national scope. =DC Fiscal Policy Institute= Following the end of the Control Board, which oversaw DC finances with a congressional mandate, Lazere's involvement was the only counterbalance outside the regular checks and balances built into D.C.'s budget system. Lazere has argued against public subsidies for developers. When the DC government gave $75 million in Tax increment financing to support the construction of Gallery Place, Lazere insisted that the land, some of the most valuable in the city, would have been developed regardless. Lazere took a similar stance when Mayor Anthony Williams provided a lucrative package to developers for construction of Nationals Park and bringing baseball to DC. In 2004, Lazere and DCFPI lost the fight and Nationals Park was built as one of the most heavily publicly financed stadiums in the country. In 2003, Lazere worked with DC Councilmember Jack Evans legislation to close corporate loopholes in the city's tax code. Later that same year, Lazere supported of the mayor's proposal for temporary tax increase for D.C. residents earning more than $100,000, a move Evans opposed. Lazere has been a regular advocate on DC's annual budget. Among his progressive proposals are not dedicating a percentage of future revenue to fund capital projects, asking DC's universities to pay some kind of payment in lieu of taxes, taxing all new commercial property refinancings, and increasing the floor on property taxes. =Other positions= Lazere was Chair of the Public Education Finance Reform Commission in 2011-2012 and a member of the DC Tax Revision Commission in 2012-2013. He has served on other non-profit boards. Campaign for Council In 2018, Lazere took leave from the DCFPI to run for Chairman of the Council of the District of Columbia, opposing incumbent Phil Mendelson. He said that the reason for his campaign was because DC was not responding forcefully enough to inequality that has allowed homelessness to increase and affordable housing to diminish despite a period of economic expansion. Lazere made affordable housing an emphasis of his campaign, claiming that housing accounts for only 3 percent of DC's budget, but is more than 3 percent of the city's problems. Among his policy proposals, Lazere wants the DC Government to increase its research capacity. He called for lawmakers to look more at \\"best practices\\" across the country when considering legislation. Personal Lazere resides in Brookland, where he has lived for 20 years.

He discusses how the Right Wing activist use the military regime in Brazil to spread a very \\"modest\\" and \\"morally correct\\" population, attitudes, and laws.

He poses a question as the chapter title and in the next chapter he answers it. (Chapter 2: Sexual Revolution? and Chapter 3: Sexual Revolution!).

This book takes an interdisciplinary approach to understand public security, government operations, and drug related operations in Rio de Janeiro's favelas. Enrique Desmond Arias travels to Brazil to investigate the main reasons for a dramatic surge in crime, and he is also interested in figuring out what can be done. His main focus is the intertwined relationships among all the different agents in Rio de Janeiro: governments, police, drug organizations, and the civilians caught in the cross hairs of the violence. Desmond Arias suggests that ethnographic research on Rio de Janeiro's crime problems must be approaches in a more complex method than what has already been done. His research in Rio de Janeiro is essential in providing an alternative solution to reducing crime that does not involve a higher military presence in the favelas or other conventional approaches taken by Brazilian governments to try and mitigate crime. As the city of Rio polarizes itself and segregates communities, the wealthier Brazilians in Rio move into gated communities and begin walling off themselves from the much poorer Brazilians who are pushed to the peripheries of Rio. As the impoverished communities grow, their density allows crime to rise as there is less public security assigned to these unofficial shantytowns by the local governments. This has allowed drug traffickers to take control of these areas and expand their drug related operations. As a result, local governments have tried to minimize crime, but the highly militarized police presence in these shantytowns has only led to wars between the police and anyone who may live in the favelas. Corruption is also another factor that contributes to the chaos, and Desmond Arias notes that these networks that connect the government and drug organizations is the main reason Rio cannot move out of this continuous violent state. Desmond Arias travels to three large favelas in the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. The three favelas he spends his time are Tubarao, Santa Ana, and Vigario Geral. His work is primarily empirical research while he stays with people of the favelas and intimate interviews with people who are general citizens of the favela populations.  Synopsis  In the first page of the introduction he explains what Rio de Janeiro's social violence is like up until the time of his research. Rio de Janeiro's people have now been forcibly segregated by their income, and those who have been pushed out the favelas are now under drug trafficking organizations' jurisdiction. Desmond Arias makes a distinction of the main agents who are simultaneously the perpetrators and victims of this violence, \\"impoverished, poorly educated, non-white, adolescents and young men.\\"Arias, Enrique Desmond. Drugs and Democracy in Rio De Janeiro: Trafficking, Social Networks, and Public Security. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2006. (Page 1-2) Desmond Arias suggests that violence in Rio is not the ineffective policies or inability of Brazilian leaders to govern the people, but it is a mixture of the several factors that look at policy, relationships among different agents, and the inequality in Brazil. He makes an extremely important note in the introduction of the approaches ethnographers, anthropologists, and sociologists have taken when researching Rio's problems.Arias, Enrique Desmond. Drugs and Democracy in Rio De Janeiro: Trafficking, Social Networks, and Public Security. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2006. (Page 1-2) According to Desmond Arias there are two conventional and widely accepted approaches to approaching Rio's crime problem where the divided city approach and the neo-clientelism approach. The divided city approach is an assumption that there is a stark difference between drug trafficking organizations and the local governments they are at war with. This approach suggests that there is no close relationships among the two agents and the hostile adversity among them can be traced back to the 80s after the transition from the dictatorship. This approach alludes to a weak Brazilian state incapable of governing and policing its own people.Arias, Enrique Desmond. Drugs and Democracy in Rio De Janeiro: Trafficking, Social Networks, and Public Security. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2006.(Page 5-6) In response to the violence perpetrated by the drug trafficking organizations, the military police retaliate with their own violence and it fuels the never ending conflict among them. While this holds some truth, Desmond Arias believes this is incomplete and universally acceptable for all favelas and agents. The other approach suggested by Desmond Arias is the neo-clientalism approach that believes there is deeply-rooted intimate relationships among favela leaders and local politicians engaged in mutually beneficial relationships. As the drug trafficking organizations bribe politicians and police to conduct their regular illicit activities, politicians are re-elected and they collect bribes, and on the other hand the drug trafficking organizations are not as heavily policed by the state.Arias, Enrique Desmond. Drugs and Democracy in Rio De Janeiro: Trafficking, Social Networks, and Public Security. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2006.(Page 5-6) Desmon Arias' nine years in Rio are very important because he deviates away from these two approaches as the strict methods for understanding Brazil. He believes that one or the other cannot be fully encompassing of the complex relationships, violence, and inequality in Brazil. Although he is more leaning to the neo-clientilism approach, he believes that people, communities, and outside factors produce a much more complex reality. =Tubarao, Santa Ana, and Vigario Geral= In his time at these favelas he looks at the main political agents associated with each favela. He thoroughly explains the geography of each of the favelas and describes their creation over time. Tubarao is located near a wealthy area of Rio, has not been neglected like other favelas, and generally has a decent relationship with government officials and the people. At the same time, this is one of the most violent favelas in Rio. Its murder rate has been increasing quickly over the years. Santa Ana is different from Tubarao. It is closer to an industrial region populated mostly by working-class people in Rio. This favela is further from the core of Rio and police are known for their corruption. Vig√°rio Geral has a dense afro-Brazilian population. Each of these favelas has a different economic situation, yet they all are continuously plagued by corruption and violence by drug trafficking organizations, police and elected officials. Arias does intimate and careful interviews of the people in these favelas. Through his research, we are opened to a world of continuous corruption and violence that the people feel first-hand. His work is important for understanding the differences among the actors to which we are introduced in the beginning of the book. His research is also reflective of his approach to Rio. He understands that the relationships among all actors is much more complicated than we know and we are used to seeing in Rio. Lastly, Desmond Rias alludes that although Rio's situation may seem bleak there are possibilities of a better future. He proposes a solution that may mitigate some of the violence and corruption in Rio. Desmond Arias believes a more transparent network between local governments and the people would help some issues such as corruption and by doing so, the network between the drug trafficking organizations and politicians would dissolve power from corrupt officials and drug trafficking leaders.

It was Warren's first directorial effort and the first film distributed by his Associated Producers, Inc. The film is about a young woman who persuades some mountain climbers to trek up to the Himalayas to attempt to find her missing brother, who hasn't been heard from since he went there on an earlier expedition to find the Abominable Snowman. A mysterious guide befriends them, but winds up actually in league with the Yeti who inhabit the mountains, and he secretly works against the explorers behind their backs, killing them off one by one. Film historian Bill Warren said a lot of the mountain climbing footage was taken from an unfinished foreign film, \\"probably of Mexican origin\\". The film was shown as early as April 1956, and opened in Los Angeles on December 5, 1956. The film was distributed in the United States as a double feature with Prehistoric Women.McGee, Mark Thomas; Robertson, R.J. (2013). \\"You Won't Believe Your Eyes\\". Bear Manor Media. . Page 254 Plot Connie Hayward (Virginia Maynor) and Trevor Hudson (Lloyd Nelson) travel to the Himalayas with a guide named Steve (Tom Maruzzi) to locate Connie's missing brother, who disappeared in that region while on an earlier expedition looking for the Abominable Snowman. Together with the help of a Dr. Erickson (George Wells Lewis), they manage to locate her brother's camp, but it is abandoned, except for a mysterious native guide named Varga (George Skaff) who attempts to befriend them. The group is attacked by the snowmen, with the treacherous Varga working against them behind the scenes. Hudson falls off a cliff while being chased by a yeti, and Dr. Erickson is lured into a cave by Varga, who then shoots him dead. When most of the party is dead, Varga reveals to Connie that he is actually a fifth-generation descendant of the Yeti, who for decades have been kidnapping human women and forcing them to breed with the male snowmen in an attempt to eventually wipe out the yeti strain from their DNA. He plots to kidnap Connie and mate with her, so that their progeny will be another step closer to being human. Steve comes to Connie's rescue, and manages to knock Varga unconscious. Steve and Connie attempt to escape down the mountain, but Varga follows them down a rope to insure they do not make it. The rope slips loose from its mooring, Varga falls to his death, and Connie and Steve (now in love) make their way back to civilization. Cast * Tom Maruzzi as Steve Cameron * Virginia Maynor (aka Asa Maynor) as Connie Hayward * George Skaff as Varga * George Wells as Dr. Erickson * Lloyd Nelson (aka Lloyd Cameron) as Trevor Hudson * Jack Haffner * Brianne Murphy as the Yeti * Wong Sing Listed among the cast was a \\"Rock Madison\\", which was a fictitious name made up by Jerry Warren to make the cast appear to be larger than it was. Production Warren grew up wanting to get into the film business in Los Angeles. He appeared in small parts in a few 1940s films such as Ghost Catchers, Anchors Aweigh and Unconquered. After meeting with producers, he took on his first film as a director and producer with Man Beast. Discussing his choice of topic, Warren later explained that the Abominable Snowman was receiving a lot of publicity at the time, and thought it seemed like \\"a natural for my first picture\\". He rented the small Keywest Studio off Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood, and cast the film with actors from the Pasadena Playhouse and other small theater groups. He also used Hollywood's famous Bronson Cavern as a background for some of the exterior scenes, and spliced in stock footage from an old 1940s Monogram picture and some old Allied Artists Studios pictures. Lloyd Nelson (billed as Lloyd Cameron in the credits) stated the script for the film was created around footage they had bought from an unnamed Mexican film that was never finished, stating \\"they wrote a script around what they had\\". To film certain scenes representing Tibet, Warren had his actors climb over a fence into a major studio lot and shoot the scenes on their Mongolian sets. Warren reworked the old gorilla costume from the PRC film White Pongo into his Man-Beast. When asked about the budget for the film, Warren described it as \\"about one-half of what the normal low-budget picture cost in those days. This was very, very low-budget.\\" Although a \\"Rock Madison\\" was given top billing in the credits for playing the part of \\"Lon Raynon,\\" there is no such character anywhere in the film. Modern sources state that \\"Rock Madison\\" was just a fake name made up by Jerry Warren to make his cast seem larger. Older sources used to state that Rock Madison may have been the man in the Yeti costume, but Warren's ex- wife Brianne Murphy said years later in an interview that she played the man- beast herself. She said Warren met her in Hollywood around this time and offered her a $50-a-week job handling props, makeup, hair, wardrobe, script and stills on \\"Man Beast.\\" She said she wore the furry Snowman costume in a couple of scenes, but she was too short for the suffocating rubber suit. Brianne Murphy also stated she had no idea who the credited screenwriter \\"B. Arthur Cassidy\\" was either, saying it may have been Jerry Warren himself under an alias. Warren wrote some of his films' screenplays under the pen name \\"Jacques Lecoutier\\" (which he sometimes misspelled in the credits). Murphy and Warren were wed right after finishing Man Beast in 1956, and went on a honeymoon in Las Vegas, where Warren wrote the screenplay for Teenage Zombies in less than a week.Warren, Bill (2009). Keep Watching the Skies!: American Science Fiction Movies of the Fifties, The 21st Century Edition. McFarland. \\"Teenage Zombies\\" chapter. . Release Man Beast was shown as early as April 1956, and opened in Los Angeles on December 5, 1956. The film was distributed in California by Favorite Films of California and by states rights release elsewhere. Warren tried to get it distributed as a single feature so he wouldn't have to share the box office receipts, but his film was relegated to a second-billed feature on a flat fee that generated little capital for him. In the future, he tried to put out two films at once on double bills, so he could take the entire box office share for himself. =Home media= The film was released for the first time on DVD by Rhino Home Video on July 30, 2002. It was later released on dvd by VCI Video on December 10, 2013 as a part of its \\"Jerry Warren Collection\\", along with deleted scenes and a Katherine Victor audio interview as extras. Reception In contemporary reviews, Variety referred to the film as \\"exploitable, but just fair entertainment wise.\\" Motion Picture Exhibitor declared it \\"hardly more than filler for the lower half\\" In Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide, it was rated BOMB, his lowest rating. Fred Olen Ray wrote, \\"Man-Beast leaves quite a bit to be desired. It is slow, plodding and incredibly boring. Even the sight of the dreaded Man Beast himself does not pull this one out.\\" References=Bibliography= External links  1956 horror films 1950s monster movies American films American independent films American black-and-white films American monster movies English-language films Films directed by Jerry Warren Yeti in fiction 1950s independent films ","title":"Man Beast (film)"},{"id":"56397661","text":"The Wehrmachtbefehlshaber () was the German chief military position, in countries occupied by the Wehrmacht which were headed by a civilian administration.

Wehrmachtbefehlshaber in the occupied areas=Balkan= Following the Invasion of Yugoslavia, the commander of the 12th Army was designated \\"Commander-in-Chief of the German troops in the Balkans\\", which was later renamed Wehrmachtbefehlshaber S√ºdost. =Belgium and Northern France= In Belgium and Northern France, control was originally given to a Military Administration. However, in July 1944, after the dismissal of Alexander von Falkenhausen and the creation of the Reichskommissariat of Belgium and Northern France, the post of Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Belgien-Nordfrankreich was established. Greater Paris On 1 August 1944, Hitler appointed Dietrich von Choltitz, Commanding general and Wehrmachtbefehlshaber of greater Paris (). =Channel Islands= Following the German occupation of the Channel Islands, command was given to the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Kanalinseln. =Denmark= Following the German occupation of Denmark, on 9 April 1940, the post of Befehlshaber der Deutsches Truppen des Heeres in D√§nemark was created, with Leonhard Kaupisch initially holding the position. The Befehlshaber's task was to provide military security for Denmark and to prevent hostile landings. Following the Telegram Crisis and the breakdown of cooperation between the Danish government and the German occupation force, Erich L√ºdke was removed from the post, and its role was expanded to Wehrmachtbefehlshaber D√§nemark. The post lasted until the surrender of Germany. =The Netherlands= With the creation of the Reichskommissariat Niederlande, the post of Wehrmachtbefehlshaber in den Niederlanden was established, having control over the military in the area. By order of 17 May 1942, the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber received the position and powers of an army commander-in-chief. =Norway= On 25 July 1940, Wilhelm Keitel added a supplement to the F√ºhrer Decree of 24 April 1940 on the exercise of governmental powers in Norway, which ordered that the commander of XXI Army Corps should immediately bear the name \\"Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Norwegen\\". In order to prepare for the war against the USSR and the subsequent command on the Finnish theater of action, a \\"Command Center Finland\\" of the AOK Norway was set up. The Army High Command in Lapland emerged from this command post. On 14 January 1942, it took command of the AOK Norway's forces on the Finnish front. On 22 June 1942, AOK Lapland was renamed 20th Mountain Army. When the German troops on the Scandinavian Peninsula had to withdraw, there was a reorganization of the command structure. The AOK Norway was dissolved on 18 December 1944; the powers of the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber passed to commander of the 20th Mountain Army. =Ostland= In the Reichskommissariat Ostland the military command was controlled by the Wehrmachtsbefehlshaber Ostland. The Wehrmachtsbefehlshaber was responsible for security within the occupied territories (including partisan control), to protect traffic connections and to record the harvest. It was created on 25 July 1941 and was transferred to Kolberg on 10 August 1944 as part of the withdrawal, and was dissolved on September 30, 1944. Belarus The Wehrmachtsbefehlshaber Wei√üruthenien staff was created on 18 April 1944 from the Commanding general of security forces and commanders in the Army Group Rear Area staff. From 15 October 1943, this staff was subordinate to the Wehrmachtsbefehlshaber Wei√üruthenien as \\"Commanding general of security forces and commanders in White Ruthenia\\". Parts of the staff were used in July 1944 for the formation of the Rothkirch General Command, which was reclassified as General Command LIII Army Corps on 13 November 1944. =Ukraine= In Reichskommissariat Ukraine the military control was given to the Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Ukraine, which was created on 1 September 1941. =Sardinia and Corsica= Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Sardinien und Korsika WB Korsika was formed in September 1943 in direct succession to Wehrmachtbefehlshaber auf Sardinien und Korsika when the latter HQ was renamed officially for the last time. The combined staff for Sardinien and Korsika was created before in summer 1943 by merging the before existing staffs of Kommandant der deutschen Wehrmacht auf Korsika and Kommandant der deutschen Wehrmacht auf Sardinien. With the evacuation of Sardinia in Sep already and the evacuation of Corsica on 3 October 43 (entirely finished on 5 October) finally, the staff ceased to exist.

He was the architect of the first NCAA Championships in both the sport of wrestling and golf. Early life Otopalik, a native of David City, Nebraska, attended the University of Nebraska competing in football, wrestling, and track & field. On the gridiron Otopalik played halfback and his squads were three time MVIAA champions in 1915, 1916 and 1917. He was also a standout wrestler at Nebraska. He was an All-American and the 175 lb Western Conference champion in both 1916 and 1917. Post-college, Otopalik fulfilled his military duty by serving in the Army during WWI. He served under General John Pershing and rose to the rank of First Sergeant before the end of the War in 1918. Wrestling Otopalik was recruited to become the assistant wrestling coach at Iowa State under head coach Charles Mayser in 1920. In 1923 Mayser unexpectedly resigned and Hugo volunteered to take over on a temporary basis. He remained the head coach for 29 years until his death in 1953. Otopalik took over an Iowa State program that was in its infancy and was able to establish the groundwork of a powerhouse. He led the Cyclones to their first ever NCAA team title in any sport, in 1933. Additionally he coached seven individual NCAA champions: Arthur Holding, Hugh Linn, Richard Cole, Robert Hess (twice), Merrill Frevert and George Martin. He also coached the team to five conference titles in 1929, 1933, 1937, 1941 and 1947. At the international level, Otopalik coached the U.S. squad at the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics. Under his leadership, Robert Pearce, Jack van Bebber and Peter Mehringer brought home gold while Edgar Nemir and Jack Riley took silver. Otopalik assisted in organizing the first NCAA Wrestling Championship. It was hosted by the Cyclones in Ames, Iowa. Hugo served as the first secretary of the National Wrestling Coaches Association from 1932 to 1936, and served in leadership positions developing AAU wrestling in the United States. Golf When the Big Six began sponsoring men's golf as an official sport, Iowa State needed a coach. Golf was not as elevated as football or basketball so the athletic administration didn't see a need to \\"hire a real coach\\". Otopalik was free because the golf season didn't overlap with the wrestling season, so he added head golf coach to his job description. Otopalik helmed the golf program from 1931 to 1953, except the 1947 season, which Jack McGuire coached. His team's had Big Six Championships in 1940 and 1947 as well as a Big Seven Title in 1953. They also placed in the NCAA tournament in 1939, 1940, 1947, 1949, 1952, and 1953 with 4th, 8th, 34th, 12th, 22nd, and 19th-place finishes respectively. In addition to his coaching duties at Iowa State, Otopalik was also instrumental in creating the first NCAA Golf Championship. As a result, he was the Tournament Director of the first NCAA Championship held at the Wakonda Club in Des Moines, IA. Honors In 2006, Otopalik was inducted into the Iowa State Cyclones Hall of Fame. In 2012, he was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame.

Based in Sherrills Ford, North Carolina, the team currently fields the No. 97 Chevrolet Silverado part-time for Jesse Little and Robby Lyons. Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series=Truck No. 97 history= In 2015, the team made their Truck Series debut at Dover as Team Little Motorsports fielding No. 97 Toyota Tundra in a partnership with ThorSport Racing, but an early crash ended Jesse Little's day early finishing 30th. The team also attempted the Chicagoland race but also finished 30th. The team returned at Texas and Homestead and finished 15th at Texas and 14th at Homestead respectively. In 2016, the team was renamed to JJL Motorsports. The No. 97 truck made two attempts in the fall races at Texas and Homestead finishing 20th and 18th respectively. In 2017, Jesse Little returned to the No. 97 truck, running 4 races. The first one was at Dover, where he finished 14th. Jesse Little then finished a season best 8th in Iowa. Little next raced at Bristol, continuing his strong performance, finishing 13th. His last start of 2017 came in Phoenix, where he was involved in a late race crash, finishing 18th. In 2018, JJL Motorsports and Jesse Little returned for 9 races, and the team also switched manufacturers from Toyota to Ford, keeping their alliance with ThorSport, who also switched from Toyota to Ford that year. As part of this switch, JJL acquired trucks and equipment from the closed Brad Keselowski Racing team, which is why their trucks were the same blue color that Keselowski's trucks had used to run. Little finished with six top tens, the highest finish a 6th at Iowa, the team's best finish to date in the Truck Series. Roger Reuse drove the 97 at Mosport in collaboration with Jordan Anderson Racing. In 2019 JJL and Jesse Little increased their schedule again, planning to run 12 to 15 races in the newly renamed Gander Outdoors Truck Series. The team announced over the summer that following the 2019, they were looking to sell the team to a new owner, as driver Jesse Little was looking to move up to the Cup or Xfinity Series in 2020. Little eventually was announced to run in the Xfinity Series full-time for JD Motorsports. Before the season- ending Ford EcoBoost 200, it was announced that Logan Puckett, the president of Diversified Utility Group LLC, would be purchasing the team, and renaming it to Diversified Motorsports Enterprises for the 2020 season. His company also sponsored the No. 97 truck at Homestead, the team's final race with the Little family as the owners of the team. Although his father Jason will no longer be an owner of the team, Jesse Little was still announced as the driver for DME in their part-time 2020 schedule, beginning at Daytona.

The book examines ‚Äúthe changes in Brazilian football from the era of Charles Miller and the sportsmen to the consolidation of the ideas of the beautiful game and of Brazil‚Äôs ownership of the game, the transition from foot-ball to futebol.‚Äù  Synopsis  In the book, the author links football to larger historical themes of contemporary Brazil, and further divides into four chapters that each focuses on separate time frames in the perspective of race, class, region, gender, and nationality. Moreover, through social, cultural, and political lenses, the book explores ‚ÄúBrazilian ideas about the game between 1894 and 1938, and the choices Brazilians made about how to explain football during that period.‚Äù In analyzing his collected historical evidences, the author emphasizes several key terms such as professionalization, amateurism, nationalization, popularization, racial exclusivity, and social hierarchies. The book contains 20 illustrative figures and incorporates historical records of prominent football clubs, popular magazines, and sports press as evidence for the author‚Äôs research.  Critical Reception  Critical reception was generally positive. In a review for the Hispanic American Historical Review, writer Bernardo Borges Buarque de Hollanda states that he believes the book made an impactful contribution to adding multiple perspectives to Brazilian football through ‚Äúquestioning the nature of a much-used clich√©, the beautiful game, which was crucially internalized as part of common sense and by a portion of the national intellectual community.‚Äù Moreover, he marks the book‚Äôs preeminence in taking an unorthodox way of historical research yet still leaving an impressive remark in providing a fresh content with historical objectivity that was not ‚Äúswayed by the native exoticism or stereotypes.‚Äù H-Net also reviewed the work, with the reviewer stating that the book was ‚Äúa nuanced and insightful analysis of the contending narratives about the emergence and expansion of football in Brazil, and of how they have produced the powerful nationalist narrative of the futebol nation.‚Äù Writing for the Luso-Brazilian Review, Christopher Gaffney praised the book as \\"a well-written, expertly researched examination of the ways in which [futebol] unfolded among and for elites in Rio and S√£o Paulo\\" while also commenting that Bocketti \\"neglect[ed] to reinsert football into broader urban and cultural dynamics\\".

Its shape was a geodesic sphere about in diameter, similar to a large disco ball. It was launched into polar orbit on an Electron rocket by Rocket Lab in January 2018 and reentered the atmosphere on 22 March 2018. According to Rocket Lab, it was meant to be \\"a bright symbol and reminder to all on Earth about our fragile place in the universe\\". Launch and orbit Humanity Star was launched on 21 January 2018 at 01:43 UTC from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1, located on the Mahia Peninsula of New Zealand. It orbited the Earth every 92 minutes in a polar orbit of approximately in altitude. According to Rocket Lab, the satellite's orbit was expected to decay after nine months, eventually burning up completely in Earth's atmosphere. However, the satellite re-entered several months early on 22 March 2018 at about 13:15 UTC. Visibility Because of its highly reflective surface, Rocket Lab claimed Humanity Star could be seen by the naked eye from the surface of the Earth. Its apparent brightness was estimated to be magnitude 7.0 when half illuminated and viewed from a distance of , while its maximum brightness was estimated to be magnitude 1.6. The satellite was most likely to be visible in the night sky at dawn or dusk. Its orbit could be tracked at Heavens-Above and at the satellite's website. Reactions Initial reactions by astronomers were negative, since reflective objects in orbit can interfere with astronomical observations. It has been described as an act of vandalism of the night sky, space graffiti, a \\"publicity stunt\\" and \\"glittery space garbage\\". Others argue that flares by existing satellites and the ISS are much brighter than Humanity Star. Alice Gorman suggests that Humanity Star and Elon Musk's Tesla Roadster are statements with very different but related messages: while Humanity Star may be seen as promoting a unifying vision and the Roadster as a reminder of inequality, \\"each tells the story of attitudes to space at a particular point in time.\\" See also * KiwiSAT * Light pollution * Lincoln Calibration Sphere 1 * Project Echo ReferencesExternal links * 2018 in New Zealand 2018 controversies Passive satellites Spacecraft launched in 2018 Spacecraft which reentered in 2018 Satellites of New Zealand Spacecraft launched by Electron rockets ","title":"Humanity Star"},{"id":"56397828","text":"Henderson Motorsports is an American professional stock car racing team that currently competes in the NASCAR Gander RV & Outdoors Truck Series.

They are the first cloned primates produced by this technique. Unlike previous attempts to clone monkeys, the donated nuclei came from fetal cells, not embryonic cells.Scholarly sources: Popular sources: The primates were born from two independent surrogate pregnancies at the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai.  Background  Since scientists produced the first cloned mammal Dolly the sheep in 1996 using the somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) technique, 23 mammalian species have been successfully cloned, including cattle, cats, dogs, horses and rats. Using this technique for primates had never been successful and no pregnancy had lasted more than 80 days. The main difficulty was likely the proper programming of the transferred nuclei to support the growth of the embryo. Tetra (born October 1999), a female rhesus macaque, was created by a team led by Gerald Schatten of the Oregon National Primate Research Center using a different technique, called \\"embryo splitting\\". She is the first \\"cloned\\" primate by artificial twinning, which is a much less complex procedure than the DNA transfer used for the creation of Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua. In January 2019, scientists in China reported the creation of five identical cloned gene-edited monkeys, using the same cloning technique that was used with Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, and the same gene-editing CRISPR-Cas9 technique allegedly used by He Jiankui in creating the first ever gene-modified human babies Lulu and Nana. The monkey clones were made in order to study several medical diseases.  Process  Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua were produced by scientists from the Institute of Neuroscience of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Shanghai, led by Qiang Sun and Muming Poo. They extracted nuclei from the fibroblasts of an aborted fetal monkey (a crab-eating macaque or Macaca fascicularis) and inserted them into egg cells (ova) that had had their own nuclei removed. The team used two enzymes to erase the epigenetic memory of the transferred nuclei of being somatic cells. This crucial reprogramming step allowed the researchers to overcome the main obstacle that had precluded the successful cloning of primates until now. They then placed 21 of these ova into surrogate mother monkeys, resulting in six pregnancies, two of which produced living animals. The monkeys were named Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua, a reference to Zhonghua (, a Chinese name for China). Although the success rate was still low, the methods could be improved to increase survival rate in the future. By comparison, the Scotland-based team that created Dolly the sheep in 1996 required 277 attempts and produced only one lamb. The scientists also attempted to clone macaques using nuclei from adult donors, which is much more difficult. They implanted 42 surrogates, resulting in 22 pregnancies, but there were still only two infant macaques, and they died soon after birth. Implications According to Muming Poo, the principal significance of this event is that it could be used to create genetically identical monkeys for use in animal experiments. Crab-eating macaques are already an established model organism for studies of atherosclerosis, though Poo chose to emphasize neuroscience, naming Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease when he appeared on the radio news program All Things Considered in January 2018.* The birth of the two cloned primates also raised concerns from bioethicists. Insoo Hyun of Case Western Reserve University questioned whether this meant that human cloning would be next. Poo told All Things Considered that \\"Technically speaking one can clone human[s] ... But we're not going to do it. There's absolutely no plan to do anything on humans.\\"  See also  * List of animals that have been cloned  References  External links  2017 animal births 2017 in biology 2017 in China Cloned animals Identical twins Individual animals in China Individual monkeys Macaca Science and technology in China ","title":"Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua"},{"id":"56398132","text":"Gordon H. ‚ÄúNick‚Äù Mueller (born 1940 Philadelphia) is an American historian and Founding President and CEO Emeritus of The National WWII Museum.

Many naturalists at the time recognized the relationship between biogeography (the way species are distributed) and the evolution of species. The 20th century saw the growth of the field of speciation, with major contributors such as Ernst Mayr researching and documenting species' geographic patterns and relationships. The field grew in prominence with the modern evolutionary synthesis in the early part of that century. Since then, research on speciation has expanded immensely. The language of speciation has grown more complex. Debate over classification schemes on the mechanisms of speciation and reproductive isolation continue. The 21st century has seen a resurgence in the study of speciation, with new techniques such as molecular phylogenetics and systematics. Speciation has largely been divided into discrete modes that correspond to rates of gene flow between two incipient populations. Today however, research has driven the development of alternative schemes and the discovery of new processes of speciation.  Early history  The only figure in Darwin's 1859 On the Origin of Species, a tree of lineages splitting to form new species Charles Darwin introduced the idea that species could evolve and split into separate lineages, referring to it as specification in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species. It was not until 1906 that the modern term speciation was coined by the biologist Orator F. Cook. Darwin, in his 1859 publication, focused primarily on the changes that can occur within a species, and less on how species may divide into two. It is almost universally accepted that Darwin's book did not directly address its title. Darwin instead saw speciation as occurring by species entering new ecological niches. = Darwin's views = Controversy exists as to whether Charles Darwin recognized a true geographical-based model of speciation in his publication On the Origin of Species. In chapter 11, \\"Geographical Distribution\\", Darwin discusses geographic barriers to migration, stating for example that \\"barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions [of the world]\\". F. J. Sulloway contends that Darwin's position on speciation was \\"misleading\\" at the least and may have later misinformed Wagner and David Starr Jordan into believing that Darwin viewed sympatric speciation as the most important mode of speciation. Nevertheless, Darwin never fully accepted Wagner's concept of geographical speciation. The evolutionary biologist James Mallet maintains that the mantra repeated concerning Darwin's Origin of Species book having never actually discussed speciation is specious. The claim began with Thomas Henry Huxley and George Romanes (contemporaries of Darwin's), who declared that Darwin failed to explain the origins of inviability and sterility in hybrids.Mallet, James (2013). Darwin and species. In Michael Ruse (eds) The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Darwin and Evolutionary Thought, Cambridge University Press, Pp. 109‚Äì115. Similar claims were promulgated by the mutationist school of thought during the late 20th century, and even after the modern evolutionary synthesis by Richard Goldschmidt. Another strong proponent of this view about Darwin came from Mayr. Mayr maintained that Darwin was unable to address the problem of speciation, as he did not define species using the biological species concept. However, Mayr's view has not been entirely accepted, as Darwin's transmutation notebooks contained writings concerning the role of isolation in the splitting of species. Furthermore, Many of Darwin's ideas on speciation largely match the modern theories of both adaptive radiation and ecological speciation.  Biogeographic influence  The German traveller Moritz Wagner (1813‚Äì1887) Recognition of geographic factors involved in species populations was present even before Darwin, with many naturalists aware of the role of isolation in species relationships. In 1833, C. L. Gloger published The Variation of Birds Under the Influence of Climate in which he described geographic variations, but did not recognize that geographic isolation was an indicator of past speciation events. Another naturalist in 1856, Wollaston, studied island beetles in comparison to mainland species. He saw isolation as key to their differentiation. However, he did not recognize that the pattern was due to speciation. One naturalist, Leopold von Buch (1825) did recognize the geographic patterns and explicitly stated that geographic isolation may lead to species separating into new species. Mayr suggests that Von Buch was likely the first naturalist to truly suggest geographic speciation. Other naturalists, such as Henry Walter Bates (1863), recognized and accepted the patterns as evidence of speciation, but in Bate's case, did not propose a coherent model. In 1868, Moritz Wagner was the first to propose the concept of geographic speciation in which he used the term Separationstheorie. Edward Bagnall Poulton, the evolutionary biologist and a strong proponent of the importance of natural selection, highlighted the role of geographic isolation in promoting speciation, in the process coining the term \\"sympatric speciation\\" in 1904. Wagner and other naturalists who studied the geographic distributions of animals, such as Karl Jordan and David Starr Jordan, noticed that closely related species were often geographically isolated from one another (allopatrically distributed) which lead to the advocation of the importance of geographic isolation in the origin of species. Karl Jordan is thought to have recognized the unification of mutation and isolation in the origin of new species ‚Äî in stark contrast to the prevailing views at the time. David Starr Jordan reiterated Wagner's proposal in 1905, providing a wealth of evidence from nature to support the theory, and asserting that geographic isolation is obvious but had been unfortunately ignored by most geneticists and experimental evolutionary biologists at the time. Joel Asaph Allen suggested the observed pattern of geographic separation of closely related species be called \\"Jordan's Law\\" (or Wagner's Law). Despite the contentions, most taxonomists did accept the geographic model of speciation. Many of the early terms used to describe speciation were outlined by Ernst Mayr. He was the first to encapsulate the then contemporary literature in his 1942 publication Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist and in his subsequent 1963 publication Animal Species and Evolution. Like Jordan's works, they relied on direct observations of nature, documenting the occurrence of geographic speciation. He described the three modes: geographic, semi-geographic, and non-geographic; which today, are referred to as allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric respectively. Mayr's 1942 publication, influenced heavily by the ideas of Karl Jordan and Poulton, was regarded as the authoritative review of speciation for over 20 years‚Äîand is still valuable today. A major focus of Mayr's works was on the importance of geography in facilitating speciation; with islands often acting as a central theme to many of the speciation concepts put forth. One of which was the concept of peripatric speciation, a variant of allopatric speciationMayr, E. 1954. Change of genetic environment and evolution. In: Evolution as a Process (J. Huxley, A. C. Hardy & E. B. Ford, eds), pp. 157‚Äì180. Unwin Brothers, London.Mayr, E. 1982. Processes of speciation in animals. In: Mechanisms of Speciation (A. R. I. Liss, ed.), pp. 1‚Äì19. Alan R. Liss Inc., New York. (he has since distinguished the two modes by referring to them as peripatric and dichopatric). This concept arose by an interpretation of Wagner's Separationstheorie as a form of founder effect speciation that focused on small geographically isolated species. This model was later expanded and modified to incorporate sexual selection by Kenneth Y. Kaneshiro in 1976 and 1980.  Modern evolutionary synthesis  Many geneticists at the time did little to bridge the gap between the genetics of natural selection and the origin of reproductive barriers between species. Ronald Fisher proposed a model of speciation in his 1930 publication The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, where he described disruptive selection acting on sympatric or parapatric populations ‚Äî with reproductive isolation completed by reinforcement. Other geneticists such as J. B. S. Haldane did not even recognize that species were real, while Sewall Wright ignored the topic, despite accepting allopatric speciation. The primary contributors to the incorporation of speciation into modern evolutionary synthesis were Ernst Mayr and Theodosius Dobzhansky. Dobzhansky, a geneticist, published Genetics and the Origin of Species in 1937, in which he formulated the genetic framework for how speciation could occur. He recognized that speciation was an unsolved problem in biology at the time, rejecting Darwin's position that new species arose by occupation of new niches ‚Äî contending that reproductive isolation was instead based on barriers to gene flow. Subsequently, Mayr conducted extensive work on the geography of species, emphasizing the importance of geographic separation and isolation, in which he filled Dobzhansky's gaps concerning the origin of biodiversity (in his 1942 book). Both of their works gave rise, not without controversy, to the modern understanding of speciation; stimulating a wealth of research on the topic. Furthermore, this extended to plants as well as animals with G. Ledyard Stebbins‚Äôs book, Variation and Evolution in Plants and the much later, 1981 book, Plant Speciation by Verne Grant. Ernst Mayr, an influential evolutionary biologist In 1947, \\"a consensus had been achieved among geneticists, paleontologists and systematists and that evolutionary biology as an independent biological discipline had been established\\" during a Princeton University conference. This 20th century synthesis incorporated speciation. Since then, the ideas have been consistently and repeatedly confirmed.  Contemporary work  After the synthesis, speciation research continued largely within natural history and biogeography ‚Äî with much less emphasis on genetics. The study of speciation has seen its largest increase since the 1980s with an influx of publications and a host of new terms, methods, concepts, and theories. This \\"third phase\\" of work ‚Äî as Jerry A. Coyne and H. Allen Orr put it ‚Äî has led to a growing complexity of the language used to describe the many processes of speciation. The research and literature on speciation have become, \\"enormous, scattered, and increasingly technical\\". From the 1980s, new research tools increased the robustness of research, assisted by new methods, theoretical frameworks, models, and approaches. Coyne and Orr discuss the modern, post-1980s developments centered around five major themes: # genetics (also a primary factor in the Modern Synthesis), # molecular biology and analysis (namely, phylogenetics and systematics); # comparative analysis; # mathematical modeling and computer simulations; and # the role of ecology. Ecologists became aware that the ecological factors behind speciation were under-represented. This saw the growth in research concerning ecology's role in facilitating speciation ‚Äî rightly designated ecological speciation. This focus on ecology generated a host of new terms relating to the barriers to reproduction (e.g. allochronic speciation, in which gene flow is reduced or removed by timing of breeding periods; or habitat isolation, in which species occupy different habitats within the same area). Sympatric speciation, regarded by Mayr as unlikely, has become widely accepted. Research on the influence of natural selection on speciation, including the process of reinforcement, has grown. Researchers have long debated the roles of sexual selection, natural selection, and genetic drift in speciation. Darwin extensively discussed sexual selection, with his work greatly expanded on by Ronald Fisher; however, it was not until 1983 that the biologist Mary Jane West-Eberhard recognized the importance of sexual selection in speciation. Natural selection plays a role in that any selection towards reproductive isolation can result in speciation ‚Äî whether indirectly or directly. Genetic drift has been widely researched from the 1950s onwards, especially with peak-shift models of speciation by genetic drift. Mayr championed founder effects, in which isolated individuals, like those found on islands near a mainland, experience a strong population bottleneck, as they contain only a small sample of the genetic variation in the main population.Mayr, Ernst (1954). Change of genetic environment and evolution. In J. Huxley, A. C. Hardy, and E. B. Ford. (eds) Evolution as a Process, George Allen and Unwin, London, Pp. 157‚Äì180. Later, other biologists such as Hampton L. Carson, Alan Templeton, Sergey Gavrilets, and Alan Hastings developed related models of speciation by genetic drift, noting that islands were inhabited mostly by endemic species.Provine, William Ball (1989). Founder effects and genetic revolutions in microevolution and speciation. In L. V. Giddings, K. Y. Kaneshiro, and W. W. Anderson. (eds) Genetics, Speciation, and the Founder Principle, Oxford University Press, New York, Pp. 43‚Äì76. Selection's role in speciation is widely supported, whereas founder effect speciation is not, having been subject to a number of criticisms. = Classification debate = allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric) can exist within this continuum, as well as other non-geographic modes. Throughout the history of research concerning speciation, classification and delineation of modes and processes have been debated. Julian Huxley divided speciation into three separate modes: geographical speciation, genetic speciation, and ecological speciation. Sewall Wright proposed ten different, varying modes. Ernst Mayr championed the importance of physical, geographic separation of species populations, maintaining it to be of major importance to speciation. He originally proposed the three primary modes known today: geographic, semi- geographic, non-geographic; corresponding to allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric respectively. The phrase \\"modes of speciation\\" is imprecisely defined, most often indicating speciation occurring as a result of a species geographic distribution. More succinctly, the modern classification of speciation is often described as occurring on a gene flow continuum (i.e., allopatry at m=0 and sympatry at m=0.5) This gene flow concept views speciation as based on the exchange of genes between populations instead of seeing a purely geographic setting as necessarily relevant. Despite this, concepts of biogeographic modes can be translated into models of gene flow (such as that in the image at left); however, this translation has led to some confusion of language in the scientific literature. allopatric, parapatric and sympatric; with peripatric speciation included as a special case of allopatric speciation. As research has expanded over the decades, the geographic scheme has been challenged. The traditional classification is considered by some researchers to be obsolete, while others argue for its merits. Proponents of non-geographic schemes often justify non-geographic classifications, not by rejection of the importance of reproductive isolation (or even the processes themselves), but instead by the fact that it simplifies the complexity of speciation. One major critique of the geographic framework is that it arbitrarily separates a biological continuum into discontinuous groups. Another criticism rests with the fact that, when speciation is viewed as a continuum of gene flow, parapatric speciation becomes unreasonably represented by the entire continuum‚Äîwith allopatric and sympatric existing in the extremes. Coyne and Orr argue that the geographic classification scheme is valuable in that biogeography controls the strength of the evolutionary forces at play, as gene flow and geography are clearly linked. James Mallet and colleagues contend that the sympatric vs. allopatric dichotomy is valuable to determine the degree in which natural selection acts on speciation. Kirkpatrick and Ravign√© categorize speciation in terms of its genetic basis or by the forces driving reproductive isolation. Here, the geographic modes of speciation are classified as types of assortive mating. Fitzpatrick and colleagues believe that the biogeographic scheme \\"is a distraction that could be positively misleading if the real goal is to understand the influence of natural selection on divergence.\\" They maintain that, to fully understand speciation, \\"the spatial, ecological, and genetic factors\\" involved in divergence must be explored. Sara Via recognizes the importance of geography in speciation but suggests that classification under this scheme be abandoned.  History of modes and mechanisms = Sympatric speciation = Sympatric speciation, from its beginnings with Darwin (who did not coin the term), has been a contentious issue. Mayr, along with many other evolutionary biologists, interpreted Darwins's view of speciation and the origin of biodiversity as arising by species entering new ecological niches‚Äîa form of sympatric speciation. Before Mayr, sympatric speciation was regarded as the primary mode of speciation. In 1963, Mayr provided a strong criticism, citing various flaws in the theory. After that, sympatric speciation fell out of favor with biologists and has only recently seen a resurgence in interest. Some biologists, such as James Mallet, believe that Darwin's view on speciation was misunderstood and misconstrued by Mayr. Today, sympatric speciation is supported by evidence from laboratory experiments and observations from nature. = Hybrid speciation = For most of the history of speciation, hybridization (polyploidy) has been a contentious issue, as botanists and zoologists have traditionally viewed hybridization's role in speciation differently. Carl Linnaeus was the earliest to suggest hybridization in 1760, √òjvind Winge was the first to confirm allopolyploidy in 1917, and a later experiment conducted by Clausen and Goodspeed in 1925 confirmed the findings. Today it is widely recognized as a common mechanism of speciation. Historically, zoologists considered hybridization to be a rare phenomenon, while botanists found it to be commonplace in plant species. The botanists G. Ledyard Stebbins and Verne Grant were two of the well known botanists who championed the idea of hybrid speciation during the 1950s to the 1980s. Hybrid speciation, also called polyploid speciation (or polyploidy) is speciation that results by an increase in the number of sets of chromosomes. It is effectively a form of sympatric speciation that happens instantly. Grant coined the term recombinational speciation in 1981; a special form of hybrid speciation where a new species results from hybridization and is itself, reproductively isolated from both its parents. Recently, biologists have increasingly recognized that hybrid speciation can occur in animals as well. = Reinforcement = The young naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace in 1862 The concept of speciation by reinforcement has a complex history, with its popularity among scholars changing significantly over time. The theory of reinforcement experienced three phases of historical development: # plausibility based on unfit hybrids # implausibility based on the finding that hybrids may have some fitness # plausibility based on empirical studies and biologically complex and realistic models It was originally proposed by Alfred Russel Wallace in 1889, termed the Wallace effect‚Äîa term rarely used by scientists today. Wallace's hypothesis differed from the modern conception in that it focused on post-zygotic isolation, strengthened by group selection.Littlejohn, M. J. (1981). Reproductive isolation: A critical review. In W. R. Atchley and D. S. Woodruff (eds) Evolution and Speciation, Cambridge University Press, Pp. 298‚Äì334. Dobzhansky was the first to provide a thorough, modern description of the process in 1937, though the actual term itself was not coined until 1955 by W. Frank Blair. In 1930, Ronald Fisher laid out the first genetic description of the process of reinforcement in The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, and in 1965 and 1970 the first computer simulations were run to test for its plausibility. Later, population genetic and quantitative genetic studies were conducted showing that completely unfit hybrids lead to an increase in pre-zygotic isolation. After Dobzhansky's idea rose to the forefront of speciation research, it garnered significant support‚Äîwith Dobzhansky suggesting that it illustrated the final step in speciation (e.g. after an allopatric population comes into secondary contact). In the 1980s, many evolutionary biologists began to doubt the plausibility of the idea, based not on empirical evidence, but largely on the growth of theory that deemed it an unlikely mechanism of reproductive isolation. A number of theoretical objections arose at the time. Since the early 1990s, reinforcement has seen a revival in popularity, with perceptions by evolutionary biologists accepting its plausibility‚Äîdue primarily from a sudden increase in data, empirical evidence from laboratory studies and nature, complex computer simulations, and theoretical work. The scientific language concerning reinforcement has also differed over time, with different researchers applying various definitions to the term. First used to describe the observed mating call differences in Gastrophryne frogs within a secondary contact hybrid zone, reinforcement has also been used to describe geographically separated populations that experience secondary contact. Roger Butlin demarcated incomplete post-zygotic isolation from complete isolation, referring to incomplete isolation as reinforcement and completely isolated populations as experiencing reproductive character displacement.Butlin, Roger K. (1989). Reinforcement of premating isolation. In Otte, D. and Endler, John A. (eds) Speciation and its Consequences, Sinauer Associates, pp. 158‚Äì179, Daniel J. Howard considered reproductive character displacement to represent either assortive mating or the divergence of traits for mate recognition (specifically between sympatric populations). Under this definition, it includes pre-zygotic divergence and complete post-zygotic isolation.Howard, D. J. (1993). Reinforcement: origin, dynamics and fate of an evolutionary hypothesis. In: Harrison, R. G. (eds) Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process, Oxford University Press, pp. 46‚Äì69. Maria R. Servedio and Mohamed Noor consider any detected increase in pre-zygotic isolation as reinforcement, as long as it is a response to selection against mating between two different species. Coyne and Orr contend that, \\"true reinforcement is restricted to cases in which isolation is enhanced between taxa that can still exchange genes\\".

(in Russian) Since 1921 Jack R. Hunter and the another well- known American collector of Fechin's works, William S. Stimmel, had been working to prepare Fechin's move to America. It was Hunter who played the main role in obtaining the necessary documents for the Fechin family's entry into the United States. Thanks to efforts of Jack Hunter Stephen G.

(in Russian) The emigration quota for Russians was then 5000 peoples in a year. In addition, the United States did not recognize Soviet Russia and an American visa could not be placed on the Fechin's Soviet passport. With the assistance of Hunter, an exit was organized through Riga. Fechin had the necessary letters of recommendation addressed to various American consuls. By the request of William Stimmel and Jack Hunter Fechin's family was met at the port of New York by the Russian emigrant artist Aaron Harry Gorson, who also placed the Fechins in a hotel, and then rented an apartment for them. Soon J. Hunter came to New York and their first personal meeting with Feshin took place. Fechin expressed a wish to paint a portrait of Jack R. Hunter in gratitude for his help with moving artist's family to America and it was done. Since 1923 until recently The Portrait of Jack R. Hunter was kept in the family of a collector. In 1958 soon after Fechin's death Jack Hunter wrote his memories of Fechin at the request of Iya Nikolaevna Feshin-Branham, Fechin's daughter.  Russian acquisition  In the middle of 2010 Portrait of Jack R. Hunter appeared in the art market and was put up for sale by one of the galleries in New Mexico (US). In 2016 the portrait was purchased by Mrs. Elena Buhtina, the owner of the \\"Blue Hall Gallery\\" from St. Petersburg, Russia, located in the building of the Saint Petersburg Union of Artists at Bolshaya Morskaya Street, 38. It was officially imported to Russia on August 31, 2016. In course of the next two days experts of the Russian Museum carried out an examination of the painting, which confirmed the authorship of N. Fechin. On September 3, 2016 Elena Bukhtina was detained by customs officers at Pulkovo Airport while trying to illegally export Portrait of Jack R. Hunter to China. The undeclared picture had been hidden by Bukhtina in a suitcase. She did not have the permits for the export of paintings as well as documents on the payment of export duties. According to V. Kraevsky, senior investigator for especially important cases of the FSB Directorate for St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region, \\"the very scheme of the crime was simple and banal.

Collins, and published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2016. This book delves into the intricacies of the Brazilian prison gang Premeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), or First Command of the Capital. Biondi's extensive ethnographic analysis of the group challenges the traditional definitions of organized crime and hierarchy through the analysis of the politics and history of the PCC. This is Biondi's first full-length book; her prior research also focuses on the PCC.  Synopsis  This book describes years of research conducted by Karina Biondi within and outside of many of Sao Paulo's prisons. After conducting her in person interviews and through examining her personal experiences with PCC members, Biondi argues that the typical portrayals of the PCC are incorrect and that the organization is very complex. She primarily focuses on the PCC in terms of their political actions as well as their lack of hierarchy which is touched upon in four different chapters. In Chapter 1, Biondi gives a brief history of the PCC and the various myths that surround the origin of the founding of the organization. Her historical story begins with the description of the 1992 Carandiru prison massacre which left 111 inmates dead. This massacre sparked a wave of prison riots and within these organized revolts, the PCC emerged as an influential organization. The true origin of the PCC is debated, but overall Biondi concludes that understanding the uniting purpose of prison mistreatment is a central element to be able to understand the PCC and its control in today's prisons. Chapter 2 focuses on the PCC's emphasis on pedagogy and politics within the prison walls. In this section, Biondi stresses the necessity for both prisoners within and visitors to a PCC-controlled to learn their appropriate roles and how which actions are deemed appropriate. This emphasis on teaching the correct actions leads to a greater adherence to the PCC's standards. Biondi stresses that this obedience, while prevalent, is not uniform across all prison's due to the command structure of the group. The main ideas and focuses of Chapters 3 and four overlap because they both focus on the politics and categorization of the PCC as a whole. Biondi goes into detail about the various positions that each member of the PCC could hold and their importance within an organization that is not categorized by a strict hierarchy. Biondi counters traditional thoughts on group hierarchical structures and argues that within the PCC there is an idea that each member, or \\"Brother\\", singularly speaks for the group. That being said, within the organization there are a few that are considered to lead, called \\"Towers\\", statements and initiatives, called \\"salves\\", but these leaders do not think of themselves as giving orders but instead as speaking for the collective. The lack of hierarchy, Biondi argues is what has allowed the PCC to gain and hold onto their power. She describes their political actions as \\"transcendent\\" of both typical power structures as well as the usual need for territory.  Critical Reception  Critical reviews of Sharing this Walk are primarily positive. Eraldo S. Santos, a PhD candidate from the University of Paris, shared his review of the book through the London School of Economics and Political Science. In his review, Santos describes this book as \\"more relevant than ever\\" and that this book \\"invites the reader to see prison life in a different, more critical light\\". Alongside his praises of the book, Santos does critique Biondi on her decision to focus primarily on the idea of \\"equality\\" instead of framing the discourse around \\"exclusion\\" versus \\"inclusion\\". The lack of a different and traditional theoretical frame was also touched upon by Francesca Cerbini in an issue of Current Anthropology. Cerbini critiques Biondi's little use of the existing anthropological theoretical frameworks within her analysis, but also describes this book as \\"one of the most insightful works on the 'inner' Brazilian society\\".

Early life Whitehouse was born on February 5, 1883 in New York City. He was one of five children born to William Fitzhugh Whitehouse (1842‚Äì1909), a New York lawyer, and Frances Sheldon (1852‚Äì1944), the niece of William B. Ogden, the first Mayor of Chicago. His brothers included Norman Ogden Whitehouse, Henry John Whitehouse and William Fitzhugh Whitehouse Jr. His sister, Lily Whitehouse, was married to the Hon. Charles Coventry, a British Army officer who was the second son of George Coventry, 9th Earl of Coventry. Their son, and Whitehouse's nephew, was Francis Henry Coventry, 12th Earl of Coventry. Another sister was Frances Whitehouse, who married Baron Constantine Ramsay of Russia, a gentleman-in-waiting to the Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in 1903. His paternal grandparents were Henry John Whitehouse, the 2nd Episcopal Bishop of Illinois, and Evelina Harriet (n√©e Bruen).

Whitehouse was a member of the Knickerbocker Club, the Brook Club, the Huguenot Society, and the Sons of the Revolution. In 1952, his wife Mary, along with Helen Rogers Reid (the wife of Ogden Mills Reid) and Mary Cushing Astor (the wife of Vincent Astor), became the first women elected trustees of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Mary was the granddaughter of railroad executive Charles Crocker. Mary's sister, Harriet Alexander, was married to Winthrop W. Aldrich, who was the CEO of Chase Bank and the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom. The Whitehouses' had a home in Newport, Rhode Island built by his father and known as \\"Eastbourne Lodge\\", an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue on the Upper East Side of New York City, and a large estate outside Tallahassee, Florida.

After successive magazine editorships during the 1970s, she joined The Washington Post as section editor. She later became founding editor of Manhattan, inc. magazine, and was widely credited with making it into a dynamic, National Magazine Award-winning magazine. She later joined the New York Post, becoming the first female editor of a major New York City newspaper. At the New York Post, she worked to increase the paper's credibility and journalism standards. By the time she left the Post in 1989, she was one of only six women in the country editing a newspaper with a circulation of over 100,000. Early life and career Jane Amsterdam was born June 15, 1951, in Philadelphia; the third of four children. Her mother, Fay, was a housewife and her father, Morton, a dentist and university professor. She was raised in Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania, and worked for her high school newspaper. She attended Cedar Crest College, during which she interned at Philadelphia magazine. After graduating in 1973, she joined Connecticut Magazine where she worked until 1976, successively as assistant editor, associate editor, and executive editor. In 1976 she became the founding managing editor of New Jersey Monthly, which she left in early 1978 to become editor of New Times magazine. which folded by the end of the year. In 1979 she edited The American Lawyer for six months, then spent seven weeks as executive editor of New York magazine. Later that year she was hired by The Washington Post as Style section editor, where she worked until 1983. At the Post, she collaborated with reporters Bob Woodward and Patrick Tyler on an article regarding allegations of improper stock practices by CIA deputy director Max C. Hugel., who resigned the day after the article broke. Shortly afterward, Amsterdam was made deputy editor of an investigative unit under Woodward. Manhattan, inc. In 1983, Amsterdam was hired by D. Herbert Lipson to begin assembling his new magazine, Manhattan, inc. The first issue debuted in September 1984, and after only four issues it won the 1985 National Magazine Award for General Excellence. Under Amsterdam's editorship the magazine was also a National Magazine Award finalist for the same category in 1986 and 1987, and for the Single-Topic Issue category in 1988. Amsterdam was widely credited for the magazines's success. A colleague at Manhattan, inc. recalled: \\"one of her great gifts is that she packages stories so that people love to read them.\\" She also had a reputation for being hard to work with, going through two executive editors before the third issue. In March 1987, Amsterdam abruptly resigned in a dispute over editorial control, accusing Lipson of wanting to favor advertisers. Afterwards, the Wall Street Journal approached her to develop a new business magazine, but the proposal was dropped after the October 1987 stock market crash. Fortune editor John Huey lists Amsterdam as a formative influence. Journalist Ron Rosenbaum dedicated his 1987 book Manhattan Passions to Amsterdam. New York Post and beyond In January 1988, Amsterdam joined book publishing company Alfred A. Knopf as senior editor. In May of that year she was hired by the New York Post as editor, replacing Frank Devine. Amsterdam was given full control over all sections except the editorial division. Within six months the paper, famous for tabloid journalism and headlines such as \\"Headless Body in Topless Bar\\" had toned down the sensationalism and increased investigative reporting. She also oversaw the debut of the Posts new Sunday edition, a feature intended to compete against rival New York tabloids the Daily News and Newsday, and worked on the section's book review and travel supplements. Within a year after her hiring, Amsterdam was forced out by Post publisher Peter Kalikow, who reportedly complained that the more credible form of journalism was not helping sell more papers. After departing the Post, Amsterdam turned down a job offer from the Los Angeles Times and dropped plans for a proposed magazine about competition between people. Amsterdam was a member of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and served as a judge for the National Magazine Awards in 1988 and 1989, and the Pulitzer Prize in 1989 and 1990. Her alma mater awarded her an honorary degree in 1989. In 1993 she became a senior producer on the ABC News program Day One before retiring from the media industry. That same year, she took up the sport of competitive carriage driving. From 1985 to 2000 she was married to writer Jonathan Z. Larsen, former editor-in-chief of The Village Voice, with whom she adopted a son, Edward Roy, in 1990.

Baladna was co- founded by Qatari businessman Moutaz Al-Khayyat and Ramez Al-Khayyat, and is part of Power International Holding. The farms and Dairy Factories are managed by CEO Malcolm Jordan. History The company was founded as a sheep and goat farm. In May 2017, it began producing processed dairy products for the Qatari market. In the wake of the June 2017 suspension of diplomatic ties of several Gulf countries with Qatar, Baladna, with state support, expanded rapidly into producing cow's milk, which had been supplied to Qatar primarily by Saudi Arabia. The company purchased 3,400 cows, and began milking them in July at a farm in Umm al Hawaya. Baladna planned to continue expanding its herd. The farm is now home to 22,000 cows, with a potential current capacity of 24,000. The cows are fed hay imported from Asia, Europe and Africa. Baladna's current facilities cover 2 million square metres and are spread across two farms that house 40 barns with state-of-the-art milking parlours. Baladna has a current capacity to manufacture 700,000 to 900,000 litres of beverages per day. About 80% of the farm's output is enough to meet domestic Qatari demand, with the remainder exported. Baladna‚Äôs main goal is to reach self-sufficiency of dairy production in Qatar. After reaching self-sufficiency the company will move to exporting their dairy products and begin producing juice products. On 17 October 2019, Baladna announced its intention to float on the Qatar Exchange. By the end of October, Baladna launched an initial public offering that is expected to raise 1.426 billion riyals ($392 million). The stocks were offered only to Qatari individuals and companies at first. However, foreigners will be able to own up to 49% of shares from an unspecified future date. In June 2019, exactly two years after the diplomatic crisis, Baladna confirmed that it is now supplying half of Qatar‚Äôs fresh milk. The company also started exporting milk to Afghanistan, Yemen with plans to extend to Oman and other countries soon. On August 6 2020, the company announced a 7-month net profit of QR 84million and revenues reaching QR 442million, which they attributed to improved productivity ‚Äúpositively strengthening margin delivery‚Äù.

Standex is divided into 12 units and 5 reporting segments. The company was incorporated in 1955 and contains multiple subsidiaries including Bakers Pride and Standex Electronics. History After World War II John Bolten, Sr. and his sons founded a vinyl sheeting company under the name, Bolta Plastics. In 1954, General Tire and Rubber bought the company for $4 million. Bolten reinvested the funds into Standard Publishing, a religious publishing company founded in 1866, and Roehlen Engraving, a steel engraving company. In 1955, Bolten incorporated his company. Standard Publishing was acquired by the Wicks Group in 2006. During the corporation's early years multiple acquisitions were made including a Coca-Cola bottling company in South America and cleansing product manufacturers consisting of Everedy cookware, Lestoil, and Bon Am. Daniel Hogan, Bolten Sr's son-in-law, succeeded Bolten as company president. Under his management the corporation experienced massive expansion. Hogan took the company public in 1964 and renamed the corporation in 1973 to Standex. Between 1971 and 1975, Standex's net sales increased by 48%, growing from $119 million to $176 million. By 1984 the company's expansion was halted after a series of rash mergers and acquisitions. In 1985 the company debt-to-capital ratio fell to 20%. Hogan, after 37 years with Standex, stepped down as president passing the position to Thomas L. King. In 1994, Standex purchased Toastswell, a company founded in the late 1920s from the Pavelka family. Toastswell assets were later purchased from Standex in 1997 by Star Manufacturing International. In July 2020, Standex acquired Renco Electronics for $28 million. Company In November 2017, Standex began trading ex-dividends at $0.18 per share. This represented a 12.5% increase over the prior dividend payment. SXI's earnings per share was measured at $3.61.

The missions were established by religious individuals or churches and they were controlled by those churches and missionaries with limited government involvement. More than ten missions were established in NSW between 1824 and 1923. Relocation to missions denied Aboriginal people access to their traditional lands, hunting grounds, and sacred sites, and disrupted kinship systems. The origin of laws seeking to protect Aboriginal people in the Australian colonies and to provide religious instruction and missionaries can be found in the Report of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Aboriginal Tribes, (British settlements.) which was presented to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1837. The missions were primarily run by Christian churches, whose religious teaching and western values greatly influenced day-to-day life for the communities. In New South Wales, there were two non-denominational Missions, the United Aborigines Mission (UAM) also called the Australian Aborigines' Mission (AAM) and the Australian Inland Mission (AIM).

The designs used a cylindrical anode and a concentric cylindrical grid electrode; the cathode was directly heated thoriated tungsten wires, which after the first types were all oxide coated to improve electron emission. One type, the NT99 developed by GEC could produce up to 200 kW peak output (for a pair of tubes) when used in 600 MHz radar sets.

(2017 photo) Lessingstra√üe, in Teltow, as seen from the Teltow side of the former East German border (former East German territory). (2018 photo) Sergeant Robert F. DeBrake, United States Army (January 9, 1927 ‚Äì September 7, 1951), was one of two known Allied soldiers killed in the line of duty on the border of West Berlin and East German territory between the beginning of the joint occupation of Berlin in summer 1945 and the beginning of the construction of the Berlin Wall on August 13, 1961 (the other was Sergeant John E. Staff, United States Army). Death Sergeant Robert F. DeBrake was shot on shot on the evening of September 6, 1951, He died the following day, on September 7, 1951. Only the statements of three East German border guards, the shooter and his two comrades, were available to conclude what happened on the evening of September 6. At about 8:45 PM, DeBrake crossed the border in his car, coming from Lichterfelde-S√ºd, the American sector of West Berlin, into the community of Teltow, belonging to East Germany, and approached an East German border police checkpoint on Lessingstra√üe. One of the border police went to the vehicle, and told the driver to stop, which was ignored. The same border guard said a day later that he had to jump aside, so as not to get run over, and only now noticed that an American soldier in uniform was sitting in the car. He called to him, \\"Hands up!\\", and while opening the car door, gestured to him that he was on East German territory. DeBrake replied, as he was closing the car door again, that he was still in West Berlin, and drove on slowly. By now, he was more than 20 meters in East German territory. DeBrake shouted to the border guard, to say that he should go away or that he would shoot. The East German border guard told him to stop twice more, and then, feeling threatened, while aiming from his hip, fired into the car, which hit DeBrake in the hip area. The sergeant's Mercedes drove on for a few more meters, and crashed into the barrier. With the help of two comrades, the shooter pulled the injured DeBrake out of the car, and provided first aid. Immediately, the command of the Soviet battalion responsible for this section was notified. A little later, Soviet soldiers appeared, first bringing DeBrake to their battalion location in Teltow. DeBrake succumbed to his injuries in the Soviet military hospital in Potsdam the following day. Aftermath Half an hour after the shooting, the Criminal Department of the Border Police was called in, which began its investigation at about 9:30 PM. The Ministry for State Security in Potsdam and the Soviet occupation authorities also conducted investigations. A commission of American and Soviet officers found that, on the afternoon of September 7, that DeBrake had actually traveled 42 meters into East German territory. Subsequently, the American officers got the car back. The investigations of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Border Police were limited to the interrogation of the three border guards present, including the shooter, and a superficial forensic investigation. It was determined that DeBrake was not deliberately drawn into East German territory, but rather it seems as if he had accidentally crossed the badly marked border area, in the dark. No weapon was found on him, so the shooter and the other two border police could not realize that the threat that he was going to shoot was an empty threat, something he could not do. This suggests that DeBrake panicked, and desperately tried not to fall into the hands of the East German police and Soviet authorities. In such cases, Western Allied soldiers had to be prepared to spend several weeks or more in Russian custody. Immediately after the event, the border police informed the Soviet occupying power, and the same night the Chief of the People's Police and Interior Minister, Karl Maron. In the early hours of September 7, the U.S. Command Berlin sent a telegram to the State Department in Washington regarding the incident at the sector border. The owner of the vehicle had now been identified on the basis of the license plate. Whether the American soldier was still alive, however, had not yet been clarified. Until late in the morning, the Soviet Commissariat officially insisted on not knowing about the incident, even though representatives of the Soviet and American commandants were already present at the scene. Burial The following day, the West Berlin daily press reported that DeBrake had succumbed to his injuries. Sergey A. Dengin, the Soviet Commandant of Berlin, expressed his condolences to the US Commandant of Berlin, officially apologizing to him, and assuring him that the gunman was being held accountable. Reportedly from Antioch, California, he was buried at the Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno, California. (including a photo of DeBrake) A few days after the fatal incident, the District Mayor of Steglitz made sure that the border at the spot in question was clearly marked by white paint, in order to avoid such incidents in the future.

The Nunes memo (formally titled Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation) is a four-page memorandum written for U.S. Representative Devin Nunes by his staff and released to the public by the Republican-controlled committee on February 2, 2018. The memo alleges that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \\"may have relied on politically motivated or questionable sources\\" to obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) warrant in October 2016 and in three subsequent renewals on Trump adviser Carter Page in the early phases of the FBI's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were false or misleading, corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats. Nunes was the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee at the time and was a supporter of FISA surveillance extension. Former Trump campaign CEO and chief strategist Steve Bannon has described Nunes as Trump's second-strongest ally in Congress. In April 2017, Nunes stepped aside from chairing the House Intelligence Committee's Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee conducted an inquiry into whether Nunes had violated applicable ethics rules with respect to his apparent secret coordination with White House officials. Nunes then began his own parallel secret investigation. The Ethics Committee investigation ended in December 2017, after which Nunes claimed that he had never recused himself. Republican legislators who favored public release of the memo argued that the memo presents evidence that a group of politically biased FBI employees abused the FISA warrant process for the purpose of undermining the Donald Trump presidency. These congressmen alleged that there was excessive and improper dependence on the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier, which was funded in part by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee, when the Justice Department applied to the FISA court to conduct electronic surveillance on Trump aide Carter Page during the course of the campaign. Political allies of Donald Trump attempted to use the memo to pivot attention away from the Special Counsel investigation of the Trump presidential campaign's role in Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Prior to release of the memo, news media reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation. A social media campaign, under the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo, emerged in mid-January 2018 to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents. Journalist and national security advocacy groups reported that Russian-linked bots on Twitter helped spread the controversial hashtag. Trump approved release of the Republican document over the objections of the FBI and the U.S. Intelligence Community. The FBI issued a rare statement expressing \\"grave concerns\\" about factual omissions and the accuracy of the memo. Within Congress, anticipation of the release of the memo sparked controversy, mainly along political lines. House Republicans released the memo on February 2, 2018. Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee prepared a classified 10 page rebuttal of claims in the Nunes memo, which was initially blocked for release. After the Nunes memo was released to the public, the House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously to release the Democrats' memo. On February 9, Trump blocked release of the Democrats' memo, saying the committee should redact classified and sensitive material before releasing it to the public. A redacted version of the Democratic memo was ultimately released on February 24. Contents The memo states that a FISA warrant on Carter Page was sought and obtained on October 21, 2016, and that there were three subsequent 90-day renewals. The memo notes that FISA submissions are classified information. The memo \\"raise[s] concern as to the legitimacy and legality\\" of the FISA application process relating to Page, and that probable cause was not made in the warrant application. It makes five main points. First it alleges that the Steele dossier \\"formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application.\\" The memo asserted that Christopher Steele was paid $160,000 by the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign. In fact, Perkins Coie, which represented the DNC and Clinton campaign, had no contact with Steele, and never paid him directly. Instead, they paid Fusion GPS $1.02 million in fees and expenses, $168,000 of which was paid to Orbis by Fusion GPS and used by them to produce the dossier. The DNC and Clinton campaign disclosed the total amount paid to Perkins Coie on campaign finance reports. The memo also alleged that information about the payment was not disclosed in the initial October 2016 FISA application or subsequent renewals. However, the FBI's application for a FISA warrant did describe, in a footnote, the origins and political background of the dossier, a fact conceded by Nunes and other Republican leaders on February 5, after the memo's release. Second, the memo alleges that the FISA application relied \\"extensively\\" on a Yahoo! News report from September 2016 by Michael Isikoff, which referenced Page's July 2016 trip to Moscow and used information from Steele. It asserts that the article was \\"derived from information leaked by Steele himself to Yahoo News.\\" Isikoff has stated that the information he got from Steele was actually information that the FBI already had. He also described Steele as serious and credible. Third, the memo accuses Steele of being biased against the candidacy of Donald Trump, stating he was \\"desperate\\" and \\"passionate\\" that Trump would lose. It goes on to say Bruce Ohr knew about this bias and that it was not reflected in the FISA applications. Ohr however did not work on counter intelligence matters and had no role in obtaining the FISA warrants on Page. The memo's fourth point quotes Bill Priestap saying that the corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its \\"infancy\\" in October 2016 during the FISA application. The memo further alleges that Andrew McCabe testified that \\"no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) without the Steele dossier information.\\" Other members of the House Intelligence Committee and sources close to the matter have stated that the Nunes memo \\"misquoted\\" and \\"mischaracterized\\" McCabe's testimony, which was given in private and has not been made public. The memo also confirms that the spark for the FBI investigation into potential collusion between Trump's campaign and the Russians was not the Steele dossier, but rather the comments made by Trump adviser George Papadopoulos, who told an Australian diplomat in May 2016 that the Russians possessed \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked emails. That confirmation contradicts earlier claims by some that the investigation had been triggered by the Steele dossier. The memo notes that Papadopoulos is mentioned in the Page FISA application, and says \\"there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos.\\" It also says the FBI's Russia investigation was opened nearly three months before the FISA surveillance application in late July 2016 by Peter Strzok, who is accused of having \\"a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton.\\" The memo also shows that the FISA warrant on Page was renewed three times. In each instance, the FBI had to show the signing judge that the warrant had merit. News accounts in 2017 indicated that because of the nature of his ties to Russia, Page had been under FBI scrutiny and had already been the subject of a FISA warrant in 2014, at least two years before the Trump campaign. Finally, the memo asserts that former FBI Director James Comey testified to Congress that the Steele dossier was \\"salacious and unverified.\\" However, Comey's prepared remarks show that he was referring specifically to \\"some personally sensitive aspects\\" of the dossier, not the entire dossier. Background The memo was produced by a small group of House Republicans and staff, led by Devin Nunes, as part of an investigation into how the FBI used the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. Democratic committee members were not informed about the investigation into the FBI or the preparation of the memo, a possible violation of committee rules. Adam Schiff, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said that Nunes had not read all of the relevant source material, although Nunes had argued for months that the FBI and DOJ had taken part in a conspiracy. Nunes had previously recused himself from the committee's investigation into Russia's interference in U.S. elections due to a House ethics investigation into Nunes' coordination with the Trump administration. The House Ethics Committee stated that \\"Nunes may have made unauthorized disclosures of classified information, in violation of House Rules, law, regulations, or other standards of conduct\\" (the ethics investigation ended when the committee was unable to obtain the relevant classified information). However, after offering to step aside from the investigation into Russian interference, Nunes began his own \\"parallel\\" investigation, whose purpose appeared to be to undermine the original ongoing investigation. Since January 18 a growing number of Republicans began calling for the release of the memo. Adam Schiff released a statement and a letter to Nunes on January 31, 2018, stating that Nunes had \\"made material changes to the memo he sent to White House ‚Äì changes not approved by the Committee\\" and that the White House was \\"reviewing a document the Committee has not approved for release.\\" In response Peter King, who also sits on the Intelligence Committee, stated, \\"My understanding is this was agreed on beforehand among Republicans. There's one small part in the memo which in no way affects the substance in the memo.\\" He said it involved removing only \\"three or four words\\" and came at the request of the FBI. =Social media influence= A social media campaign under the hashtag \\"#ReleaseTheMemo\\" emerged on January 19, 2018, to publicly release the memo despite some of its classified contents. According to the Hamilton 68 project run by the bipartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD) which tracks Russian propaganda efforts on Twitter, the hashtag was promoted by Russian Twitter bot accounts, with a 230,000 percent spike in the promotion of the hashtag by these accounts. Clint Watts, one of the founding researchers of ASD, said the social media campaign started trending after Julian Assange advocated for the memo's release, which was then repeated by Russian influence networks. Twitter stated that a \\"preliminary analysis of available geographical data for tweets with the hashtag #ReleaseTheMemo ... has not identified any significant activity connected to Russia with respect to tweets posting original content to this hashtag.\\" According to an analysis by CNN the hashtag was pushed by over a thousand newly created accounts, of which 460 were without a profile picture. CNN also noted that the hashtag was promoted by prominent American conservatives and Republicans, including Donald Trump Jr. and Mark Meadows. =Historical background= Carter Page originally came to the attention of the FBI counterintelligence unit in 2013, prior to his becoming a Trump campaign adviser, when the unit learned that Russian spies were trying to use Page as a source of information and to recruit him as an agent; this resulted in Page being interviewed by the FBI in June 2013. He was under secret intelligence surveillance beginning in 2014. Page claimed that the information he provided to the Russians was innocuous. Page was the subject of at least one FISA warrant, going back to 2014, when he was alleged to have been colluding with the Russian government or knowingly working as an agent on its behalf. In March 2016, then-candidate Donald Trump listed the little-known Page as one of his foreign policy advisers. In a May 2016 meeting in London, Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos told the Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, Alexander Downer, that the Russians possessed \\"dirt\\" on Hillary Clinton in the form of hacked emails. Two months later, Australian officials passed this information to American officials. This began the inquiry into Trump's relationship to Russia. In July 2016, Page traveled to Moscow for five days, where he spoke at two meetings on July 7 & 8. Page had received permission from the Trump campaign to make the trip. On July 8, Page emailed Trump campaign officials about his presentation at the New Economic School in Moscow and described meeting Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. He said Dvorkovich \\"expressed strong support for Mr. Trump and a desire to work together toward devising better solutions in response to the vast range of current international problems.\\" Page was later forced, under oath, to reveal he had met Dvorkovich during the visit. The Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier alleges that in July, Carter Page secretly met Rosneft chairman Igor Sechin in Moscow, together with a \\"senior Kremlin Internal Affairs official, DIVYEKIN\\"; that Sechin offered Trump a 19% stake in Rosneft (worth about $11 billion) in exchange for lifting the sanctions against Russia after his election, and that Page confirmed, on Trump's \\"full authority\\", that he intended to lift the sanctions. In September, after reports surfaced about Page's July trip to Russia, the Trump campaign said Page was not part of the campaign and never had been. Page then said he was taking a leave of absence. A month later, in October 2016, and after Page left the campaign, the FBI sought a FISA warrant to investigate his connections to Russia. The warrant was granted by a FISA court judge and has since been renewed thrice, with each 90-day extension requiring new evidence \\"pertinent to intelligence-related collection\\" in order to back up the original application and to show that the warrant continues to be productive. Shortly after the release of the memo, Time magazine reported that in 2013, Carter Page bragged about being an \\"informal adviser to the Kremlin\\" in a letter to the editor. Page was asked about this admission on February 6, 2017, on ABC's Good Morning America program, and had trouble explaining how he reconciled his dual roles as Trump adviser and Kremlin adviser. Page also claimed that he, despite being named foreign policy adviser, had never actually met Trump, contradicting his earlier statements in which he said he had been in a \\"number of meetings\\" with Trump and had \\"learned a tremendous amount from him\\". =Purpose= Republicans posited that politically-motivated FBI employees attempted to undermine the Trump presidency, citing the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier, which they say was an essential part of the evidence used for obtaining a FISA warrant to wiretap Page. According to this argument, the FBI did not disclose to the FISA court that their request for a warrant depended on evidence in the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier, a document funded by the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee; according to this line of argument, Rod Rosenstein, Trump's Deputy Attorney General, knew of the funding from Democrats, and his approval of an application that failed to disclose that fact potentially implies that Rosenstein harbors some form of anti-Trump bias. Republicans did eventually concede that the FBI disclosed this information in a footnote. Fusion GPS, the firm behind the document, started its research into Trump with funding from the Paul Singer's conservative news outlet The Washington Free Beacon as part of the Never Trump movement. However, the news outlet stopped funding this research during May 2016 when Donald Trump became the presumptive nominee on May 3, 2016. Attorney Marc Elias then hired Fusion GPS on behalf of his clients, the Democratic National Committee and the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, to continue this research and compile what would become the Donald Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier. Fusion GPS paid Christopher Steele to write the dossier, and the FBI also paid Steele for the expenses he incurred on \\"a trip to Rome to meet with FBI officials\\". Allies of Trump tried to move focus away from the Trump presidential campaign's alleged role in the Russian election interference by attempting to use the Nunes memo to portray the Special Counsel investigation as the real scandal. In the hours before the expected release of the memo, sources reported that Trump told his associates that release of the memo would discredit the investigation and give him reason to fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the supervisor of the Special Counsel investigation. On February 3, 2018, Trump praised the Nunes memo and tweeted: \\"This memo totally vindicates 'Trump' in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction.\\" Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) disagreed, stating on February 4 on CBS' Face the Nation: \\"I actually don't think it has any impact on the Russia probe.\\" He went on to say: Gowdy went on to say he was \\"100 percent\\" behind Mueller: \\"Look, Russia tried to interfere with our election in 2016 with or without a dossier.\\" Glenn Kessler, a fact checker for The Washington Post, analyzed an accusation made by Devin Nunes in a February 7, 2018, interview on the Hugh Hewitt Show. Kessler's \\"Pinocchio Test\\" rating was: \\" is no evidence that Clinton was involved in Steele's reports or worked with Russian entities to feed information to Steele. That's where Nunes's claim goes off the rails‚Äîand why he earns Four Pinocchios.\\" According to Kessler \\"Four Pinocchios\\" equals a \\"Whopper\\" (the equivalent of an outright lie). Responses=U.S. intelligence community= Shortly after becoming a trending topic, the memo drew polarizing reactions from government officials and the media, and generally along party lines for lawmakers. The Justice Department (DOJ) released a letter to Congress calling a release of the memo without review \\"reckless\\" because it could expose intelligence sources and methods. FBI Director Christopher Wray was allowed to read the memo and did so on January 28. On January 29, the majority of the House Intelligence Committee disregarded the DOJ's warnings and voted to approve the memo's release. In response, Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee drafted a ten-page rebuttal memo on January 24. Both memos were released to the full House. The Republicans voted against making public the competing memo Democrats had crafted, and rejected a proposal to give the Justice Department and FBI more time to vet the document. The President then had up to five days to review it before it could be officially released. Republicans sought a committee vote that would request the release through the President, which would keep the memo confined to committee members until the President responded. The memo could be made public by a vote in the House of Representatives if the President did not act or denied the request, but no vote was scheduled for the full House. Nunes and the House Intelligence Committee denied access to the memo by the Senate Intelligence Committee and the FBI, which expressed a desire to investigate any alleged wrongdoing. The Department of Justice sent a letter to Nunes and called the release of the memo \\"extraordinarily reckless.\\" Nunes' panel refused to allow the FBI and the Justice Department to view the memo despite their requests. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement saying it was \\"[r]ife with factual inaccuracies\\" and was \\"meant only to give Republican House members a distorted view of the FBI.\\" Schiff also said the memo omits key information on evidence other than Steele's dossier, used in the application for the FISA warrant. On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released a heavily redacted version of the October 2016 FISA warrant application for Carter Page, which stated in part \\"The FBI believes that Page has been collaborating and conspiring with the Russian government\\" and \\"the FBI believes that the Russian government's efforts are being coordinated with Page and perhaps other individuals associated with Candidate #1's campaign.\\" On December 9, 2019, Michael E. Horowitz, the Inspector General, released his report stating that the FBI found 17 ‚Äúbasic and fundamental‚Äù errors and omissions in its applications to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court), but did not find political bias during the investigation of Trump and Russia, nor did he find evidence that the FBI attempted to place people inside the Trump campaign or report on the Trump campaign.http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/read-full-text- doj-ig-michael-horowitz-s-report- origins-n1098431https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/inspector- general-report-trump-russia- investigation/2019/12/09/d5940d88-184c-11ea-a659-7d69641c6ff7_story.htmlhttps://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/09/fbi- russia-probe-report-released-by-justice-department- watchdog.htmlhttps://www.justice.gov/storage/120919-examination.pdf However, in a Senate hearing, Horowitz stated he could not rule out political bias as a possible motivation.https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/doj- watchdog-tell-senate-he-has-deep-concerns-about-fbi-n1099636 The report found that the FBI had a legal \\"authorized investigative purpose and with sufficient factual predication\\" to ask for court approval to begin surveillance of Carter Page, a former Trump campaign adviser. =Trump administration= On January 24, 2018, Trump expressed support for releasing the Nunes memo. He reportedly told close advisers that he believed the memo would reveal the FBI's bias against him, and provide grounds for him to fire Rod Rosenstein. White House Counsel Don McGahn wrote that \\"the memorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors\\" and that the reason for its release was \\"significant public interest in the memorandum.\\" After its release, Trump claimed in a tweet that the memo \\"totally vindicates\\" him. =Republicans= Before the memo was released, House Speaker Paul Ryan warned his fellow Republicans against overplaying the contents of the memo and tying it to the Mueller investigation. After the memo was released, Ryan said, \\"The matter of concern outlined in this memo is a specific, legitimate one. Our FISA system is critical to keeping America safe from real and evolving threats. It is a unique system with broad discretion and a real impact on Americans' civil liberties.\\" Ryan also supported the release of the Democrats' counter-memo. Representative Trey Gowdy, the only Republican on the House Intelligence Committee who actually read the underlying classified material, said the FISA application cited other material besides the dossier, but in his opinion the warrant would not have been authorized without the dossier. He added that the dossier does not invalidate the Russia investigation, which would have been launched with or without it. He said he has confidence in Rosenstein, Wray, and Mueller. On February 2, John McCain rebuked his fellow Republicans with the statement, \\"The latest attacks against the FBI and Department of Justice serve no American interests‚Äïno party's, no president's, only Putin's. ... If we continue to undermine our own rule of law, we are doing Putin's job for him.\\" =Democrats= Democrats' rebuttal memo Democratic leaders in Congress --House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer --called upon House Speaker Paul Ryan to remove Nunes from the House Intelligence Committee, accusing him of abusing his position as committee chairman and of working in coordination with the White House that the committee is supposed to be investigating. Pelosi referred to the document as a \\"bogus\\" memo which was part of a Republican cover-up campaign; she also said Nunes had disgraced the House committee. Schumer said that the memo aimed to spread \\"conspiracy theories\\" and attacked federal law enforcement in order to protect Trump from investigation. Democratic House Whip Steny Hoyer also called for Nunes to be removed, saying Nunes' behavior had undermined the American people's trust in his chairmanship of the committee. Jerry Nadler of New York, the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, issued a six- page analysis rebutting the memo's legal basis and accusing Republican House members of being part of \\"an organized effort to obstruct\\" Mueller's investigation. Nadler, who reviewed the classified material used to obtain the FISA warrant, called the memo \\"deliberately misleading and deeply wrong on the law.\\" He argued the FISA Court had probable cause to believe Page was acting as \\"an agent of a foreign power.\\" Adam Schiff has stated that the \\"Nunes memo is designed to ... [\\"put the government on trial\\"] by furthering a conspiracy theory that a cabal of senior officials within the FBI and the Justice Department were so tainted by bias against President Donald Trump that they irredeemably poisoned the investigation.\\"  Rebuttal memo  Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee drafted a classified ten-page rebuttal memo on January 24. However, when the committee voted along partisan lines to release the Nunes memo, it also voted not to release the Democratic memo. On February 5 the committee voted unanimously to release the Democrat's minority memo, subject to Trump's approval. On February 9, Trump declined to release the rebuttal memo, with the White House suggesting sensitive sections be removed before the memo is made public. McGahn stated this was because of its \\"numerous properly classified and especially sensitive passages.\\" After redactions in consultation with the FBI, the Democratic memo, titled Correcting the Record -- The Russia Investigation, was released on February 24. This rebuttal memo has also been referred to as the Schiff memo after Adam Schiff. =Criticism= Revelations about the Nunes memo and its surrounding controversy, including speculation about the potential firing of Mueller or Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, gave rise to comparisons to the Saturday night massacre, alluding to the firing of special prosecutor Archibald Cox by President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. Glenn Greenwald called the Republican-led campaign to release the memo \\"a bizarre spectacle\\" since the Republicans were \\"holding a document that only they can release, while pretending to be advocating for its release.\\" In response to the release of Nunes's document, former FBI director James Comey wrote, \\"That's it? Dishonest and misleading memo wrecked the House intel committee, destroyed trust with Intelligence Community, damaged relationship with FISA court, and inexcusably exposed classified investigation of an American citizen. For what?\\" In an interview on Meet the Press, former CIA director John O. Brennan said that Nunes had presented only \\"one side, in a very selective, cherry-picked memo.\\" He said that for Nunes and the Republicans to deny the Democratic minority the ability to release their own memo \\"is just appalling, and it clearly underscores just how partisan Mr. Nunes has been.\\" Brennan accused Nunes of an abuse of power in the use of his position on the House Intelligence Committee. \\"I don't say that lightly,\\" he added.Shane Harris, Nunes 'abused' his power on intelligence committee, former CIA director says, Washington Post (February 4, 2018). Three former CIA analysts (Jeff Asher, Nada Bakos and Cindy Otis) wrote that the \\"politically motivated, recklessly drafted\\" Nunes memo \\"does not support its main thesis\\" alleging abuse by the FBI and Department of Justice regarding their investigation of Carter Page as it \\"doesn't offer any evidence of the potential abuse and, in fact, the memo undermines itself\\". Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has accused the authors of the memo of \\"using selective declassification as a tactic‚Äîthey use declassified information to tell their side, and then the rebuttal is classified.\\" Jane Mayer stated that this leaves Christopher Steele's defenders no possibility \\"to respond without breaching national-security secrets\\". Paul Rosenzweig, former Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and former Whitewater investigator, has analyzed the Nunes memo and explained several reasons for why he believes \\"it makes no sense\\", is \\"not a serious effort at oversight\\", and \\"fails to make its case\\": the timing of the FISA warrant shows that any findings would first have come to light after the election and thus could not have affected it; Carter Page was no longer a member of the Trump campaign at the time of the application; it ignores that Page was under FISA surveillance as early as 2013 because of his proven Russian connections; the attempt to tie the October FISA application to Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein is flawed because Rosenstein was a U.S. attorney for the district of Maryland at the time and had nothing to do with that application; the memo \\"uses language that is intended to create a misimpression\\" by implying that the Trump‚ÄìRussia dossier was central to the FISA application, when it was only a part of it; and that the memo \\"tries to bury\\" its \\"admission deep in the document\\", in the final paragraph, that the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections was not triggered by the Steele dossier but by information from Trump advisor Papadopoulos. Release of Carter Page FISA warrant applications Carter Page FISA warrant applications On July 21, 2018, the Justice Department released heavily redacted versions of four FISA warrant applications for Carter Page which showed that key assertions made in the Nunes memo were false or misleading, corroborating the rebuttal made by Democrats. The Nunes memo: * Contended the application did not \\"disclose or reference the role of the DNC, Clinton campaign or any party/campaign in funding Steele's efforts, even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior DOJ and FBI officials,\\" an assertion Democrats disputed in their rebuttal. While the Nunes Memo was correct in that the DNC was not identified, the application provided a lengthy footnote that explained that the person who commissioned Steele was \\"likely looking for information to discredit\\" the Trump campaign. The application also explained that, despite the political motives of those who commissioned Steele, the FBI found Steele credible. * Faulted the application for not identifying Hillary Clinton or the DNC by name. However, the application showed the standard practice of omitting the names of American individuals and organizations. For example, Trump and Clinton were identified only as \\"Candidate #1\\" and \\"Candidate #2,\\" respectively. While Hillary Clinton was identified as Candidate #2 in the application, it was not in reference to the dossier. * Asserted the DOJ referenced a Yahoo News article as corroboration of Steele's information, even though it later became known that Steele had been a source for the article, an assertion rebutted by Democrats. However, the application actually cited the Yahoo News article only to show that Carter Page had denied allegations against him, under a section entitled \\"Page's Denial of Cooperation With the Russian Government.\\" Multiple sources also noted that after its publication, the wiretap warrant was approved, and later renewed, four times by four different judges, all of whom were appointed by Republican presidents, weakening Nunes' claim of partisan bias. Similarly, all four judges ‚Äî Rosemary Collyer, Anne Conway, Raymond Dearie and Michael Mosman ‚Äî were assigned to serve on the FISA court by Chief Justice John Roberts, a conservative. The day after the applications were released, Trump asserted without evidence that they confirmed the Justice Department and FBI had misled the FISA court and as a result his campaign had been illegally spied on to benefit the Clinton campaign. Trump also quoted conservative writer Andrew McCarthy, who had called into question the integrity of the FISA court itself.

During the Second French Empire he was a prefect of various departments. During the French Third Republic he served as deputy for Pas-de-Calais between 1872 and 1889. He held right-wing Bonapartist views and consistently voted against the republican governments. Early years Charles-Alphonse Levert was born on 11 June 1825 in Sens, Yonne. His parents were Antoine Levert (1793‚Äì1865) and Caroline Colombe Tarb√© (1800‚Äì1847). He studied at the Coll√®ge Sainte-Barbe in Paris. In the French Revolution of 1848 he declared for the republicans. He joined the administration as secretary of √âmile Ollivier, Commissioner General of the Provisional Government in Bouches- du-Rh√¥ne. He was adviser to the prefecture of Arras in 1850‚Äì51. He joined the cause of Prince Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte. Second Empire After the coup d'√©tat of 2 December 1951 Levert was named sub-prefect of Saint-Omer thanks to the influence of his uncle Pierre Carlier(fr), prefect of police of Paris at the time of the coup d'√©tat. He was appointed sub-prefect of Saint-Omer on 6 December 1851. He became known for his strong action against the republicans. Under the Second French Empire he was in turn sub-prefect of Valenciennes (1856) and prefect of Ard√®che. On 25 June 1857 he married Elise Canonne (1836‚Äì1923). Their son Maurice was followed by their daughter Caroline Fathima in 1859. Levert was prefect at Algiers from October 1859 to December 1860, when he was replaced by Nicolas Mercier-Lacombe(fr). In Algiers he had to fight sharp opposition in the local press by Cl√©ment Duvernois(fr). In 1861 Levert was prefect of Vienne, in 1864 prefect of Loire, then he was prefect of Pas-de-Calais (1864‚Äì66) and finally prefect of Bouches-du-Rhone. Levert was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honour on 14 August 1867. He succeeded Senator Charlemagne de Maupas as prefect of Bouches-du-Rhone at Marseille in 1866 at a time of growing republican agitation. With relaxation of the press laws on 11 May 1868, new opposition daily newspapers like Le Phare de Marseille and Le Peuple started to flourish. During the revolution of 4 September 1870 Levert tried to resist a crowd of 5,000 people who invaded the prefecture in Marseille. He was badly injured and went into hiding for twelve hours. He managed to escape to Belgium, then went to stay close to Napoleon III at Schloss Wilhelmsh√∂he. Third Republic After the end of the Franco- Prussian War and the conclusion of peace Levert returned to France and ran for election to the National Assembly in a by-election in Pas-de-Calais on 7 January 1872 to succeed General Louis Faidherbe, who had resigned. He ran as a Bonapartist, and received 74,629 votes against 57,248 votes for his republican opponent. In the Assembly he sat with the Appel au peuple parliamentary group. He voted for the resignation of Adolphe Thiers on 24 May 1873 and abstained from the vote on the presidential septennat (seven-year mandate). In 1874 he was awarded an annual pension of 6,000 francs as a former prefect, with payment of arrears of over 18,000 francs. This caused an outcry in the democratic press. He voted against the ministry of Albert de Broglie on 16 May 1874, for the dissolution of the Chamber, against Henri-Alexandre Wallon's amendment to the constitutional laws, for Pascal Pierre Duprat's amendment and against the constitutional laws. His term ended on 7 March 1876. On 30 January 1876 Levert ran for election as senator of Pas-de-Calais, but failed when the Legitimists formed an alliance with the Republicans against Levert in the third round. On 20 February 1876 he was elected as deputy in the 2nd district of Saint-Omer. He continued to follow a Bonapartist line, did little to support the government during the 16 May 1877 crisis, and abstained from the vote of no confidence against the Broglie-Fourtou cabinet. He was reelected on 14 October 1877 and again on 21 August 1881. He opposed the internal and external policies of the cabinets of L√©on Gambetta and Jules Ferry and voted against the Tonkin credits. On 4 October 1885 he was elected on the conservative list of Pas-de-Calais and continued to side with the right-wing of the Bonapartist group. He voted against reinstatement of the district poll on 11 February 1889, for indefinite postponement of revision of the Constitution, against the prosecution of three members of the Ligue des Patriotes, against the draft Lisbonne law restricting freedom of the press and against prosecution of General Boulanger. Levert ran for reelection in September 1889 for the 2nd district of Saint-Omer, but was defeated. His last term ended on 14 October 1889. After this he abandoned politics. Charles Levert died on 6 April 1899 in Paris.

He went into local politics in later life, becoming Provost of Perth. He was the patriarch of the Pullar dynasty which spawned a number of notable figures in Scottish history. Life The grave of John Pullar, Wellshill Cemetery, Perth He was born on 22 April 1803 at Pomarium in Perth, the son of Robert Pullar (1782‚Äì1835), a cloth manufacturer, and his wife, Elizabeth Black (died 1857) In 1824 he set up his own dyeworks at Burt's Close in Perth with six employees. His premises dyed cloth for his father and provided dyeing and laundry services for the public. In 1828 he relocated to 36 Mill Street to distance himself from neighbours and have an area of expansion with good water supply. The firm benefitted from the arrival of trains in 1847. In 1851 they exhibited at the Great Exhibition in London and received the patronage of Queen Victoria in 1852, thereafter being by appointment to the Queen.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Sir Robert Pullar By 1856 they employed over 100 persons and had over thirty premises gathering clothes for cleaning. In 1865 the Mill Street premises was rebuilt and renamed the North British Dyeworks. The building remains and is now known as \\"Pullar House\\" and houses Perth and Kinross Council. In 1867/8 Pullars began dry cleaning (the first dry cleaning service in Scotland) due to his son James marriage to Adelgunde Spindler, daughter of Wilhelm Spindler who invented the benzene method of dry cleaning. John (already 63 years old) left this element of the business wholly in the hands of James. Robert Pringle handled the remainder of the business whilst John took a new role as Provost of Perth, serving (as a radical Liberal) 1867 to 1873.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: John Pullar During his time as Provost he brought improvements to the railway system and various city improvement schemes.

Kirkendall published by the University of North Carolina Press in 2010. It discusses the involvement of Brazilian educator and critical pedagogy philosopher Paulo Freire (1921-1997) in literacy programs in Latin American during the Cold War, and analyzes the effect of politics on literacy programs. The book also details Freire's work with organizations such as the World Council of Churches and the spread of his ideas.  Synopsis  This book is an analysis of Paulo Freire's work in Latin American literacy campaigns during the mid 20th century. The first chapter, \\"Entering History\\", helps set the stage for the rest of the book. It summarizes Freire's early life and the historical context of Brazil in the 1940s and 1950s. It goes on to explain how the need for improving literacy rates was becoming apparent during this time, and describes Freire's ideas regarding education and politics.Kirkendall, Andrew J. Paulo Freire and the Cold War Politics of Literacy. Univ Of North Carolina Pr, 2014 The second chapter, \\"The Revolution that wasn't and the Revolution that was in Brazil\\", describes Freire's work in the northeast of Brazil during the presidency of Joao Goulart. It describes the literacy programs that he set up in the region, particularly in Angicos, and also discusses Freire's methods of education. It explains how the issue of literacy became increasingly prominent during the 1960s due to the government's need to define itself and expanding student movements. The chapter also argues that talk of a \\"revolution\\" in Brazil, which was common on in Goulart's party, was interpreted in widely varying ways with some fearing that it could lead to communist uprisings and others believing that it simply described rapid progress towards literacy and democracy. The involvement of the United States, which tried to promote literacy through the Alliance for Progress but also was preoccupied with preventing the spread of communism, was also discussed. The chapter ends with the 1964 coup, motivated by fears of a radical Left, that deposed Goulart and forced Freire to flee the country.Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 28-60 \\"Reformist Chile, Peasant Consciousness, and the Meaning of Christian Democracy\\" describes Freire's time in Chile from 1964 to 1969. During this time, he served under the administration of Eduardo Frei, who made the eradication of illiteracy a central aspect of his vision for the county. This chapter argues that Freire experienced some of his most productive years in Chile due to the success of his programs in spreading literacy in the Chilean countryside. This helped him gain increased international recognition and ensured that his ideas would spread globally. However it also points out that many of the attempts to increase the political awareness of the illiterate were also designed to promote Christian Democratic views at the expense of other political parties. Frei's party also encouraged the formation of unions in rural areas in order to gain political support. By the end of the chapter the Christian Democratic party has lost much of its support despite its achievements, and failed to receive a mandate in the 1970 election. Freire, who now increasingly viewed himself as a revolutionary, left Chile.Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 61-89 In the fourth chapter, \\"Paulo Freire and the World Council of Churches\\", Freire travels extensively on behalf of the World Council of Churches (WCC). His brief visit to the United States, where he exchanged ideas with academics such as Jonathan Kozol and Denis Goulet, is summarized. Freire also spends time in Europe, particularly in Geneva, the base of the WCC. Freire also worked on literacy programs in many African countries, such as Angola, Guinea-Bissau, and Tanzania. This chapter also describes the influence of Freire and his ideas on the WCC, particularly his belief that education should be for \\"liberation and continuity\\". The contradictions between Freire's political ideas and his reliance on American liberals, who often disagreed with his beliefs, for funding are also pointed out. Finally, Kirkendall points out that during this period in Freire's life, he started working with single party states rather than multiparty democracies.Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 90-117 The fifth chapter, \\"The Sandinistas and the Last Utopian Experiment of the Cold War\\", focuses on Freire's work in Nicaragua from 1979 to 1980. It gives an overview of the history of Nicaragua starting from the rise of the Somoza family dynasty in 1936. Kirkendall then describes the rise of the Sandinista party and describes the political importance of literacy within the revolution. Many Sandinistas believed that becoming literate was an important part of the process of self transformation that defined the revolution. After the Sandinista victory, education became an important part of their agenda and a \\"National Literacy Crusade\\" was started. Freire's help was requested and he arrived in Nicaragua in October 1979. Kirkendall states that one of the most important contributions of Freire was to legitimize the Sandinista literacy campaign. He also points out that the United States contributes a large amount to the literacy campaign despite being historically opposed to the Sandinistas. The literacy campaign was partially successful, but by 1985 illiteracy rates had risen back to 20 percent. Kirkendall argues that Freire remained proud of the accomplishments of the literacy campaign.Kirkendall, 2010, 118-152 In the last chapter, \\"The Long, Slow Transition to Democracy in Brazil\\", Freire's role in restoring democratic government in Brazil is discussed. After his return was facilitated by the 1979 Amnesty Law, Freire helped found the Workers Party. Kirkendall describes the process of democratization and describes the Freire's work as education secretary during this time. The book ends with a description of the end of the Cold War.Kirkendall, 2010, pp. 153-164  Arguments = The Political Importance of Education = Throughout the book, Kirkendall makes the argument that politics and education significantly influenced each other in Cold War era Latin America. He claims that following the rise of Joao Goulart, \\"national and international dynamics turned illiteracy into a national issue of great political importance\\"Kirkendall, 2010 p.28 He also argues that education itself was used by political parties as a tool to generate support. Indeed, according to Kirkendall, \\"the Brazilian student Left in the early 1960s considered politicizing and raising the consciousnesses of the Brazilian popular class to be a central part of their own political activity\\".Kirkendall, 2010, 45 He further claims that this phenomenon was not confined to Brazil but also manifested itself in Chile and Nicaragua. Frei's emphasis on education in the countryside, he claims, was \\"hardly apolitical\\" and probably motivated by the fact that \\"the Christian Democrats lagged behind the Marxist parties in organizing the industrial and mining sectors\\".Kirkendall, 2010, p.77 Finally, Kirkendall claims that the United States involved itself in literacy programs for the purpose of stopping the spread of communism.Kirkendall, 2010, p.25 = Influence of Paulo Freire's Ideas = Kirkendall argues that Freire's ideas about education have gained international importance. He points out that Freire's belief in the importance of consciousness-raising among the lower classes and his idea that the illiterate should be the agents of their own education rather than mere recipients of knowledge have influenced literacy campaigns throughout the world. To corroborate these claims, Kirkendall points out that \\"phraseology reminiscent of Freirean programs\\" was used in Nicaragua even though Freire himself spent a very limited amount of time in the country.Kirkendall, 2010, p.124 Kirkendall also argues that Freire's ideas contained some contradictions, such as the fact that he helped implement literacy programs supposedly designed to promote democratization in one party states, therefore legitimizing undemocratic governments.  Critical Reception  The book has received positive reviews with many people citing its thoroughness and balanced commentary on Freire's life.

Ordained as a priest at a relatively young age, Lazareviƒá was described as a lively, gun- wearing horseman who joined the Serbian rebels in their fight against the renegade Janissaries (Dahije) to avenge his cousin. He quickly showed prowess and by the time the uprising against the Ottomans had begun he was chosen as the commander of a unit in western Serbia. Participating in all notable battles in that region, the Ottoman suppression forced him and other leaders to flee the country. He returned to Serbia in 1832 after many years in Russia, and worked for the Serbian government (now autonomous) in his late years. Early life Lazareviƒá was born in Svileuva, in the ≈†abac nahiya of the Sanjak of Smederevo (now Serbia). His father was named Todor, his mother Jevrosima. His surname was adopted from his paternal uncle Lazar. As a child he was sent to Syrmia, at the time part of the Habsburg Monarchy, where he was educated for three and a half years. After his return home and marriage, he was ordained a priest by bishop Danilo of Valjevo in 1796 and was given the care of the villages of Ljutice and Koceljeva. His wife died after seven years of marriage, and he was left taking care of their two sons, Mihailo and Kuzman., Described as lively, Lazareviƒá wore guns and was a great rider., Lazareviƒá's paternal cousin Ranko, the son of Lazar, was a knez (Christian village chief) in the Tamnava area. When the Janissaries in the sanjak conflicted with the local Turks that were loyal to the Sultan, Ranko supported the latter. Serbs that supported the Empire were harassed by the Janissaries; Bego Novljanin who sat at ≈†abac killed Ranko at the beginning of 1800. Luka Lazareviƒá now awaited the time for revenge. It was said that Lazareviƒá was more of a warrior than a priest. Serbian Revolution When the uprising against the Dahije in ≈†umadija broke out in the beginning of 1804, Lazareviƒá joined the rebels. The uprising spread over Kolubara, with Jakov Nenadoviƒá from Valjevo reaching ≈†abac. In a short time, Lazareviƒá became one of the leading fighters in the band, and eventually the leader of the Tamnavci and Posavci of ≈†abac (the rebels from the Tamnava and Posavina areas in the ≈†abac nahiya). When the ordinary leader of the ≈†abac rebels was to be appointed, at a time when Mateja Nenadoviƒá pursued that rank (his uncle Jakov commanded the northwestern Valjevo nahiya), the supreme rebel leader Karaƒëorƒëe asked the Tamnavci and Posavci on whom to pick. In unison, they chose Lazareviƒá. Petar Moler cut his beard, and he then went with Jakov and others towards U≈æice. He then married Danojla from Jadar, with bishop Antim of Valjevo marrying them as his kum. From 1805, when the rebels fought for liberation, against the Ottoman Empire, Lazareviƒá had several important victories in which he fought heroically and with vojvoda tact and authority. On Jakov Nenadoviƒá and Luka Lazareviƒá began the siege of ≈†abac, while Karaƒëorƒëe set off from Belgrade to join them; on the way Karaƒëorƒëe learnt that Ottoman Bosnian troops were about to cross the Drina and thus immediately dispatched Lazareviƒá. Arriving at Le≈°nica on with ≈Ωivko Dabiƒá, Lazareviƒá's unit defeated the Turks at Ranitovac after a day of fighting, with much of enemy troops drowning in the Jadar river. at Mi≈°ar. He was nearly killed at the Battle of Mi≈°ar (August 1806), but was instrumental in the victory; Karaƒëorƒëe ordered Lazareviƒá to hide in the woods with cavalry, and on the sound of his cannon, charge into the rear of the Ottoman troops. In the midst of battle, Lazareviƒá had a duel with Ottoman Bosnian commander Mehmed-beg Kulenoviƒá, and was severely wounded, as riflemen shot at the two. Lazareviƒá managed to escape into the woods, while Kulenoviƒá fell. The destroyed Ottoman army retreated towards ≈†abac, while Lazareviƒá was sent to Provaƒçka Ada for treatment. When the Ottomans handed over ≈†abac to the Serbian rebels on , Karaƒëorƒëe left Lazareviƒá as commander with 1,000 soldiers. As the supervisor of ≈†abac, he worked on implementing order in the town and district, and sometimes judged at the magistrate and entered judgements into the protocol. Lazareviƒá led battles between ≈†abac and Loznica, and at U≈æice avenged his cousin Ranko. He also fought on the other side of the Drina, at Glavice above Bijeljina (where Meho Orugd≈æiƒá fell), between Zvornik and Srebrenica, and destroyed Ottoman troops crossing towards Sarajevo. The winning streak was stopped by the defeat at ƒåegar (May 1809). The epic poet and guslar Filip Vi≈°njiƒá (1767‚Äì1834) enumerated Lazareviƒá's most famed battles as Loznica (October 1810), where he wrested the control of the town from the Ottomans, and Novo Selo on Krstovdan, where he killed Pejzo Mehmed-Aga. The epic poem of the latter glorifies his bravery, and also describes him as a very good strategist. Exile and return After the defeat at Ravnje (August 1813) and suppression of the uprising, Lazareviƒá, as many other leaders, left Serbia. The Austrians escorted him to Judenburg in Styria, from where he then left for the Russian Empire, where he stayed until 1832 when he returned to what had become the Principality of Serbia after the Second Serbian Uprising (1815‚Äì17), ruled by Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá (a fellow revolutionary commander, who had ordered for the assassination of Karaƒëorƒëe). Prince Milo≈° approved a pension of 250 thalers on , and employed him as a member of the ≈†abac magistrate. In 1842 he became a member of the State Council. Due to old age and weakness from his fourteen wounds, he retired and lived in his house in ≈†abac. Lazareviƒá died on , and was buried with highest honours the next day beside the . His tombstone includes verses by poet Jovan Iliƒá (1824‚Äì1901). Character Lazareviƒá was dark-haired, rawboned, nimble, of few words; lively, energetic, orderly, sharp; just towards the young and listening to the elderly. Of all the commanders, he most respected Petar Dobrnjac and Milenko Stojkoviƒá. He hated Bosnian \\"Turks\\" (Muslims), but called them greater heroes than real Turks. Although famous and honored, he did never exercise any type of tyranny, nor did he crave for wealth. Even in old age he carried a rifle, sabre, and two guns. Legacy Monument in his home village. There are epic poems which include Luka Lazareviƒá as central in the story (such as Vi≈°njiƒá's Luka Lazareviƒá i Pejzo). There are streets named after him in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Ni≈°, Knja≈æevac, Koceljeva, Vladimirci, and others. The street in Belgrade has a commemorative plaque.

He is the founder of Elektromis, Eurocash, Biedronka, ≈ªabka, Ma≈Çpka Express and has been named as one of the richest people in Poland by Wprost weekly.  Biography and Career  He grew up in various orphanages, the longest in a house run by nuns in Szamotu≈Çy. He graduated from a 2-year vocational school in plumbing. In the 80s he traded at the Pozna≈Ñ trade fair, at the end of the 1980s he specialized in coffee making and then in computer hardware distribution. In 1987, he founded Elektromis, an enterprise importing confectionery, radio and television equipment, beer and spirits. Within 2 years, it transformed into a huge holding. Some of his companies back then were registered and ran by his friends from the orphanages. In 1992, Elektromis owned 50 warehouses throughout Poland and PLN 168 million of profit per year. An investigation was launched on a 1992 referral from the Ministry of Finance, which suspected Elektromis of tax fraud, illegal alcohol trade, theft, fake sales transactions. According to prosecutors, Elektromis‚Äô illegal practices cost the Polish state at least USD 25 million. In 1993, he transformed Elektromis into Eurocash, which became the largest grocery wholesale chain in Poland. In 1995 he sold it to Jer√≥nimo Martins. In 1995, he founded the discount chain Biedronka, which he sold (243 branches) in 1998 also to Jer√≥nimo Martins. Another investigation was launched in 1994 and lasted until the early 2000s, resulting in 13 indictments. ≈öwitalski was never a witness in the case as he had not been formally employed as an Elektromis executive. He was the owner of the weekly Miliarder. He helped Jerzy Urban in setting up the weekly \\"Nie\\". He founded the Posnania bank, which, however, in 1995 closed down. In 1998, he founded ≈ªabka, whose shares in 2000 were bought by the AIG fund. In 2011, he launched the \\"Sowiniec FIZ\\" fund investing in real estate. It owns land between Puszczykowo near Pozna≈Ñ and Sowiniec. At the end of the 1990s, he also bought plots in Pozna≈Ñ, in the Naramowice housing estate. In December 2010, the Pozna≈Ñ-based company ≈öwitalski & Synowie changed its name to Czerwona Torebka SA. In 2012 Czerwona Torebka went public on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. In 2019 WSE decided to suspend Czerwona Torebka shares from trading. In 2013, he created the discount chain store Czerwony Torebka. In April 2015, the management of the company Dyskont Czerwona Torebka SA decided to liquidate the company. In July of the same year, all stores were closed, and the company Czerwona Torebka ceased to exist. In February 2020, ≈öwitalski's assets were frozen by a court order issued in a legal dispute between ≈öwitalski and Forteam Investments fund. The dispute concerns the sale of the Ma≈Çpka chain, which Forteam bought from a subsidiary of ≈öwitalski in 2015 An agreement supporting the sale guaranteed the buyer a minimum price in case of subsequent sale of Ma≈Çpka to a third party.

He is a specialist on vampires, from ancient folklore to modern vampire myth.  Career  Jean Marigny has devoted much of his career to the myth of vampires, he is the founder of the research centre for studies in fantasy and horror in English and American literature: the (GERF, lit. 'Group of Studies and Research on Fantasy') which he directed several years at Stendhal University. He is also a member of the Canadian branch of the Transylvanian Society of Dracula. After his doctoral dissertation in 1985, , he has published a number of essays and translated novels and short stories about the vampire theme. He published two anthologies, in 1978 and (in collaboration with Roger Bozzetto) in 1997. He is the author of (1992), a copiously illustrated pocket book that has been translated into seven languages (including English) and was a reaction to Francis Coppola's Dracula. He also directed a collective work on Dracula for the collection published by . Marigny is considered one of the greatest vampire specialists around the world, particularly with regard to Anglo-Saxon fiction on the subject. What fascinates Marigny about vampire is the character: a paradoxical being. As he explains, 'No fictional character is more emblematic of the fantasy than the vampire. If it is true that [...] fantasy is based on paradox, the vampire is the best illustration, since it is both dead and alive.'  US edition (left) and UK edition. (lit.

Jean Marigny traces in four chapters the history and evolution of this creature in legends and literature, from antiquity to the gaslit streets of London: the origins of the myth, the reference to Greek mythology in particular, confusion with the undead, fears related to the plague in Medieval times... (chap. I, \\"Blood Lust\\"); the Church recognised the existence of the living dead (chap. II, \\"The Consecrated Vampire\\"). The golden age of the vampire was in the Enlightenment era where such beliefs should have been banned (chap. III, \\"The Golden Age of Vampirism\\"). Then in the Victorian era the vampire became an indisputable character of theatres and nightlife (chap. IV, \\"The Reawakening of the Vampire\\"). It is not Bram Stoker's Dracula, but The Vampyre of John William Polidori is the first published modern vampire story, the book is dedicated to this Romantic writer. Marigny explains in the book that Stoker was inspired by Sheridan Le Fanu's Carmilla for his own novel. The book addresses, among other topics, the cult of blood, Vlad the Impaler, Countess B√°thory, the superstitions, the reaction of the Church to vampirism and vampires in cinema. At the back of the book is the \\"Documents\\" section containing a compilation of excerpts which is divided into seven parts: 1, Dracula, the tyrant; 2, Vampirism through the centuries; 3, The rationalist response; 4, The vampire in poetry; 5, The vampire in prose; 6, A night in Count Dracula's castle; 7, The vampire in film.

After the film, media coverage around vampires was in full swing, therefore, Gallimard was looking for an author to write a book about vampires for their collection. It was Jean Marigny, noticed by his dissertation on vampires in the Anglo-Saxon literature, whom would be chosen. After a few weeks of intensive work to match the release of the book with the release of the film, was born. It was an immediate success that the book has sold 130,000 copies and was reprinted several times. It has been translated into seven languages, including English.

All 33 people on board both aircraft were killed. At the time of the collision, the Tupolev was flying on a southerly route from Niamey, Niger, to Cape Town, South Africa, while the C-141 was heading northwest from Windhoek, Namibia, to Ascension Island. Neither aircraft was equipped with TCAS collision avoidance systems, and although both crews had filed a flight plan, the German aircraft was not in contact with Namibian air traffic control and controllers were unaware of its presence in Namibian airspace. Furthermore, the Tupolev was flying at the wrong altitude, according to its flight plan and to the semicircular rule. The subsequent US Air Force inquiry concluded that the German crew was responsible for the accident, citing pilot error and inadequate air traffic control that contributed to the fatal lack of separation. A year before the accident, the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations had stated that from a safety point of view, 75 percent of African airspace was \\"critically deficient.\\" Aircraft and crew The Lockheed C-141 Starlifter was a four-engine strategic airlifter in service with the US Air Force. The example involved in the accident, a C-141B variant, tail number 65-9405, was assigned to the 305th Air Mobility Wing based at McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey. At the time it was conducting a humanitarian flight to Namibia, delivering a mine-clearing team for the United Nations. The aircraft, using the callsign REACH 4201, was under the command of Captain Peter Vallejo, 34, with Captain Jason Ramsey, 27, and Captain Gregory M. Cindrich, 31, acting as pilots. Six other personnel were on board as well, including a crew chief, two flight engineers, and two loadmasters.

As such it was equipped with cameras and sensors in the fuselage.Brochure \\"Open Skies, German Observation System\\" of the Federal Armed Forces Verification Center, 52503 Geilenkirchen The aircraft was manned by a crew of 10 and was flying 14 passengers, which included 12 German marines and two of their spouses from Cologne, Germany to Cape Town, South Africa, for a regatta celebrating the 75th anniversary of the South African Navy. The pilots, both experienced, were Ralph Reinhold and Klaus Ehrlichmann. Flying under the callsign GAF 074, the aircraft had made a stopover in Niamey and was due to land in Windhoek for another refueling stop before continuing on to Cape Town. Flight and collision=Flight paths= The Luftwaffe Tu-154M departed Cologne, Germany on 13 September 1997 and landed in Niamey, Niger to refuel. While in Niger, the crew filed a flight plan requesting a cruise altitude of 35,000 feet with an en route climb to 39,000 feet. At 10:35 UTC, GAF 074 departed Niamey and began flying on a southerly track. While flying through Gabonese airspace, GAF 074 received a slight reroute. The aircraft changed altitude as it passed western Africa and turned in an easterly direction, in compliance with airway requirements. At 14:11 UTC, the United States Air Force C-141B departed from Windhoek, Namibia for Ascension Island, a British territory in the South Atlantic. Per REACH 4201's filed flight plan it was flying on a northwesterly track at a cruise altitude of 35,000 feet. Visual meteorological conditions prevailed at the time of the aircraft's departure. =Air traffic control= In 1996, the International Federation of Airline Pilots' Associations (IFAPA) labeled 75% of African airspace as \\"critically deficient.\\" due to safety concerns and poor air traffic control service. The situation was so severe that in the same year, South African airline pilots reported more than 70 near-misses while flying in the African continent. The C-141B was under the control of Namibian air traffic control upon taking off from Windhoek. Namibian controllers had not received a flight plan or a departure signal from the Tu-154M and were not aware that the German aircraft had entered its flight information region. The last agency to have contact with the German aircraft was Accra air traffic control. Air traffic control authorities in Luanda, Angola had not contacted Namibian controllers to inform them of the aircraft's presence as required under ICAO regulations. The Tu-154M had changed altitude during its flight without the controllers' knowledge. Contributing to the communications breakdowns, the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network, a system that facilitates the exchange of messages between air controllers was not working at the time. The air traffic control center in Windhoek received the last communication from the C-141B crew via high-frequency radio, who stated they were level at 35,000 feet. =Collision= At 15:10 hours UTC, sixty-five nautical miles off the coast of Namibia, the two aircraft collided. The Tu-154M struck the C-141B in the lower fuselage, causing an explosion that was observed as a bright flash by a US surveillance satellite overflying the area. Cockpit voice recordings show that at least one crew member in the Tu-154M noticed the C-141B and had attempted to maneuver away, unsuccessfully. A transcript from the CVR shows that the American crew were not killed on impact. One of the pilots can be heard saying, \\"oxygen mask, get them on, get them on. Get the flashlights quick.\\" In addition, a nearby French Air Force aircraft reported that it picked up one \\"mayday\\" distress call. Both aircraft crashed into the sea, ultimately killing all 33 passengers and crew aboard both airplanes. Search and recovery ATC authorities in Ascension Island attempted fifty times to contact aviation authorities in Namibia when the C-141B did not arrive as scheduled. At 10:55 UTC the following day, Ascension ATC contacted Air Mobility Command and notified them of the overdue aircraft. At 11:00 UTC, the aircraft was declared missing. An international search effort by the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, and several African countries ensued, scouring the seas off Namibia for any signs of wreckage. A French aircraft flying over the apparent crash site picked up a faint signal from one of the aircraft's emergency beacons. The South African Air Force stated it had received a signal from a life jacket emergency beacon, raising the hope of finding survivors. A mid-air collision was presumed to be the most likely scenario since both aircraft had gone missing at the same time in virtually the same location. The first pieces of wreckage were found by a search ship in 16 September. Six days after the crash, authorities announced they had found the body of 43 year old German flight attendant Saskia Neumeyer, the first body to be recovered. By December 1997, very few remnants of the crash had been discovered. The body of Saskia Neumeyer had been the only one of the 33 missing passengers and crew to be recovered and very little of the wreckage had been found. A fishing trawler discovered several pieces of clothing on 13 December from a depth of 655 meters. The remains of Captain Peter Vallejo and Captain Jason Ramsey were located by divers later in December 1997 along with unidentifiable skeletal remains of other crewmembers. They were buried on 2 April 1998 in Arlington National Cemetery. Investigation and aftermath Memorial plaque to the passengers of the Luftwaffe Tu-154M In 1997, the United States Air Force appointed Colonel William H. C. Schell Jr. to lead the investigation into the collision. A final report with the board's conclusions was released in March 1998. The investigation blamed primarily the German crew, who were cruising at 35,000 feet in breach of the semicircular rule, which states that an aircraft heading in a southeasterly direction must fly at an altitude of either 29,000, 33,000, 37,000 or 41,000 feet. The Luftwaffe also acknowledged that its aircraft was at fault in the crash in its own investigative report. In addition the report cited systemic problems in Africa's air traffic control system as contributing factors to the accident, blaming faulty communications equipment that prevented the German aircraft's flight plan from being transmitted through the proper channels and negligent controllers in Luanda who failed to pass on the aircraft's position to Namibian ATC. Another substantially contributing factor was the complicated and sporadic operation of the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunications Network (AFTN). The report stated that if either aircraft had been equipped with a TCAS it is highly likely the crash could have been avoided, reading, \\"the presence of a fully operational TCAS on either aircraft could have prevented the accident.\\" One day before the release of the report, Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen announced that the military would begin the installation of TCAS on its aircraft. The lack of a TCAS on the German aircraft brought considerable pressure on Germany's Federal Ministry of Defence to install collision avoidance systems on its aircraft. Despite being listed on the Project Objective Memorandum of the C-141B for five years, installation of the TCAS began on a small number of the aircraft soon after the crash.

It was first observed on 3 April 2013, by astronomers of the Mount Lemmon Survey conducted at the Mount Lemmon Observatory near Tucson, Arizona, United States. The asteroid has only been observed for 12 days. Based on a crude orbit determination, it has an exceptionally low MOID and may approach Earth at one lunar distance on 14 April 2026. Alternative calculations gave a much shorter distance with a possible minimum transit at approximately 8,600 kilometers above Earth's surface.  Orbit and classification  is a member of the dynamical Aten group, which are Earth-crossing asteroids and one of the smaller subgroups of near-Earth objects. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.60‚Äì1.08 AU once every 9 months (279 days; semi-major axis of 0.84 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.29 and an inclination of nearly 0¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a precovery taken by DECam at the Chilean V√≠ctor M. Blanco Telescope on 1 April 2013, just two nights prior to its first official observation at Mount Lemmon. = Close approaches = has a poorly determined orbit with an uncertainty parameter of 7, due to its short 12-day observation arc. Based on the preliminary orbital elements, the object has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of , which translates into 0.037 lunar distances (LD). Due to its small size, that is, an absolute magnitude fainter than 22, it is not classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid. On 14 April 2026, the object is currently predicted to approach Earth within a nominal distance of or 1.02 LD. It will also pass the Moon at a nominal distance of . Conversely, Italian astronomers Piero Sicoli and Francesco Manca at the Sormano Astronomical Observatory estimated a close approach with Earth at a nominal distance of 68,420 kilometers and a possible minimum transit at approximately 8,600 kilometers above Earth's surface for that very same date. The two astronomers acknowledge that their orbital computations still contain large uncertainties.

The reaction may be simplified as: 1 Pyruvate + 1 NAD+ \\\\+ CoA ‚Üí 1 Acetyl-CoA + NADH + CO2 \\\\+ H+ Pyruvate oxidation is the step that connects glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. In glycolysis, a single glucose molecule (6 carbons) is split into 2 pyruvates (3 carbons each), hence link reaction occurs twice for each glucose molecule to produce a total of 2 acetyl-CoA molecules, which can then enter the Krebs cycle. Energy-generating ions and molecules such as amino acids and carbohydrates enter the Krebs cycle as acetyl coenzyme A and oxidize in the cycle. The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) catalyzes the decarboxylation of pyruvate resulting in the synthesis of acetyl-CoA, CO2, and NADH. In eukaryotes, this enzyme complex regulates pyruvate metabolism and ensures homeostasis of glucose during the absorptive and post-absorptive state metabolism. As the Krebs cycle occurs in the mitochondrial matrix, the pyruvate generated during glycolysis in the cytosol is transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane by a pyruvate carrier under aerobic conditions.

Early life The daughter of a factory owner, she was born in Dresden and moved to Vienna while in her late teens. She studied at the Reimann School in Berlin. She met Carl Jung which convinced her of the important role of symbolism in art and the relevance of dreams. Tomalin left Nazi Germany for London during the mid-1930s. She worked briefly as a textile designer. In 1940, she married Miles Tomalin, s musician and a veteran of the Spanish Civil War. The couple had a daughter Stefany. They later divorced but continued to live close to each other. Career Tomalin worked in the office of architect Ern√∂ Goldfinger and then later worked with Abram Games in the Ministry of Information, creating public information posters. During the 1950s, she set up and ran the textile design studio at Marks & Spencer. Later, she was employed as the colour and design consultant for the Heal's department store. At the age of 62, she graduated in psychotherapy in New York City. During the 1970s, she worked at a psychiatric hospital in Bonn. Tomalin was an early practitioner of art therapy and gave seminars in Germany, Austria and Switzerland until she was 94. After she was no longer able to travel, she took up embroidery, producing images of various archetypal symbols such as the mandala and the tree of life. In 2009, an exhibition of this work was held in London. Personal life Tomalin died in London at the age of 99. The English designer Thomas Heatherwick is her grandson.

With an apparent visual magnitude of 6.3, it lies below the normal brightness limit of stars that are visible with the naked eye under most viewing conditions. An annual parallax shift of 39.24 mas for the A component provides a distance estimate of 83 light years. The pair are candidate members of the Castor Moving Group, which implies a relatively youthful age of around 200 million years. HD 119124 is moving closer to the Sun with a radial velocity of ‚àí12 km/s. This system was first identified as a double star by Friedrich von Struve (1793‚àí1864) and catalogued as the 1774th entry in his list. As of 2015, the magnitude 10.5 K-type companion star was located at an angular separation of 18.10 arc seconds along a position angle of 135¬∞ from the brighter primary. They appear to be gravitationally bound with an estimated orbital period of around 7,000 years. The primary, component A, is a Sun-like star with a stellar classification of F8 V, indicating it is an F-type main-sequence star that is generating energy via hydrogen fusion at its core. It is slightly larger and more massive than the Sun and appears mildly variable. The star is radiating 1.5 times the Sun's luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,149 K. HD 119124 A displays a strong infrared excess at a wavelength of 70 Œºm, indicating an orbiting circumstellar disk of cold dust. The emission fits a model with a grain temperature of 40 K, indicating a minimum orbital radius of 60 AU from the host star. The estimated grain lifetimes are 84,000 years ‚Äì much shorter than the star's lifespan. This suggests the grains are being replenished via collisions between some number of larger bodies totaling around 1‚àí6 times the mass of the Moon.

Pre-production of the film began in January 2017, and principal photography commenced from 24 January 2018. It was released on 12 October 2018.  Plot  Eela, a single mother rejoins her college to complete her education after 22 years. In the flashback, it is shown that she is an upcoming, partially-famous model/singer, who records songs written by her boyfriend Arun. When she is recording for a career-breaking song for a Mukesh Bhatt project, the project gets cancelled indefinitely. So she and her boyfriend decide to get married. After few months it is shown that she gives birth to a boy named Vivan. While seeing their family tree, Eela and Arun realise that many male members of Arun's family died in their late 30s, which drives Arun crazy as he is also in his late 30s. So he finally decides to leave Eela and Vivan to pursue his own dreams as it might be his final years. Eela, now a single mom, is very over protective about Vivan. She keeps meddling in Vivan's life continuously and she finally joins the same college as Vivan to complete her studies. One day suddenly Arun comes back, but he goes out as soon he realizes that Eela and Vivan don't need him. Eela's involvement in Vivan's life becomes so much that Vivan decides to leave his house to give some space to Eela and to find her own identity.

He also studied composition privately during the 1950s with Nadia Boulanger (in Paris) and Hans Erich Apostel (in Vienna), and conducting with Pierre Monteux.

Once prosecuted, she was sentenced to 20 years in prison by courts of the first and second instances, a term that would later be reduced to five years. Early life Mariana Callejas was born into a middle-class family. Very early on she became interested in serious literature, claiming to have read Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment at age eight. Her life changed dramatically at age 18 ‚Äì she secretly left school after her favorite teachers, the Feinsilbert couple, were thrown out. Influenced by this couple, she turned to Socialist Zionism and planned to emigrate to Israel. In order to fulfill her plan, she married a young man. One day, she told her mother about her school desertion, her marriage, and her conversion. The reaction was unexpected; her father cut her out of their life. Things got worse when soon after, Pablo, her new husband, decided to marry a classmate, and his family obtained an annulment of the marriage with Mariana. Then, thanks to the Feinsilberts' connections, she took a ship bound for Israel. On the first kibbutz where Callejas lived, Nan Kissuphim (probably the current Kissufim), besides working, she studied Hebrew in special classes. From this kibbutz she passed to another, formed by emigrants from North and South America, in the Negev desert. Located near the border, they had to build it from scratch. Due to the danger of attacks from Egyptian and Bedouin soldiers, she had to stand night watches. There she adopted the name of Anat, because it seemed to her that In√©s and Mariana sounded too Catholic. Her first and ephemeral marriage of convenience was soon followed by a second, this time to feel protected in an environment where there were four men for every woman. She chose an American agriculture student, Allan Earnest, an idealist who had emigrated to Israel from Cornell University. The couple left the kibbutz shortly afterward, along with a score of other residents, due to ideological differences. They settled on a moshav, where it was allowed to own a home, as well as other manifestations of individualism. In 1952 Allan was called up, but as a pacifist, he did not want to serve in the army. In addition, he was still recovering from the injuries he had suffered when a mine exploded under his tractor. Given this situation, Allan and Anat decided to embark with their young son on a ship bound for Chile. There, as expected, they were not well received by her father, and soon they took another ship, bound for New York City. In the United States, they shared an apartment with Allan's mother in Washington Heights. Mariana Earnest escaped during the day to attend acting classes at different schools. At that time she dreamed of theater and also began to write stories. The couple moved to Uniondale, a suburb of Long Island, in 1957, when they already had three small children. There she had a short experience as a waitress at the Italian restaurant Tony's, which she hated, as she also hated being a housewife. Three years later, unable to take any more, she took her three children and returned to Chile. Callejas and Townley Callejas arrived at the doors of a maternity home in 1960 with the children; she would not let anyone tell her to go back to her husband or the United States. She continued to write stories and soon became friends with a group of bohemian artists. Going to wait for one of them when leaving a party, she met Michael Townley. That same year, Townley, at seventeen, fell madly in love with her, and despite the difference in age, courted her until she agreed to marry him. Their marriage was celebrated on 22 July 1961. None of their parents attended the wedding. Not only the Callejas were against it; Townley's father, who worked at Ford Chile, had been promoted to Venezuela and had left the country with his wife and two other children. Michael had refused to leave and had remained in Santiago, determined to conquer Mariana. To make a living, Michael sold Collier's Encyclopedia to wealthy families who knew English, and fixed cars and electrical appliances. Three years later, in 1964, thanks to his father, he got a job with Ford in Peru, but he failed and four months later he left Lima. In 1965 luck smiled on him and he became the representative of the mutual fund Investors Overseas Services (IOS). This allowed him to move with Callejas and the children to a good house in La Reina, with two employees. The couple enjoyed skiing, and Townley participated in car races. The next year, Townley's father was promoted again, and was preparing to return to Santiago as president of Ford Chile. Michael, now successful, hoped to make peace with the family, but everything fell apart when rumors of the imminent bankruptcy of IOS arose because one of its directors, Bernard Cornfeld, had stolen millions of dollars. Michael's clients, in a panic, begin to harass him and he was forced to flee to the United States. Mariana followed shortly afterward with her children, but only after obtaining the promise that they would return to Chile as soon as possible. First they settled in the house of Michael's grandparents in Pompano Beach (where he tried to sell Fords, without success), and then in Miami's Little Havana, to work at an AAMCO Transmissions shop. Nothing in their lives yet indicated that the couple would become terrorist agents. Mariana began to attend a literary workshop at the University of Miami, joined marches called by the New Party, a group where her new friends were active and that, among other things, proposed the legalization of abortion and marijuana, opposed the Vietnam War, and supported the poet and senator Eugene McCarthy for president. However, it was also anti-communist. Townley, on the other hand, was not interested in literature or even politics; he worked as a mechanic and remained a fan of car racing. When Salvador Allende won the 1970 elections, Callejas decided to return to Chile, which she did despite the opposition of her husband, who did not want to leave his business for the economic uncertainty in Santiago. There were fights, Michael had a romantic affair in the United States, he considered getting divorced, there were comings and goings, but finally the crisis was overcome and the couple saw each other again in Chile. An anti-Allendist, Callejas made contacts with Fatherland and Liberty (), while Michael tried, with little success, to conduct business. Urged by his wife to join her new right-wing friends, Michael said he had to work, and characterized their actions as those of children, and their Molotov cocktails as primitive. A few weeks later, Michael agreed to make an authentic Molotov bomb. Thus began his collaboration with the Chilean extreme right, in whose circles he would be known as Juan Manolo. His biggest success was the clandestine radio that he managed to manufacture, and with which he transmitted anti-Allendist messages. After participating in an operation to eliminate interference that prevented transmissions of the conservative Channel 5 of Concepci√≥n, a dependent of the Catholic University, \\"whose position was of decided opposition to the government of Allende\\", which ended with the death of a worker, Townley was forced to flee. He arrived in Miami, with empty pockets, on 2 April 1973. Callejas followed him later, in June, with the children. Upon his return, Townley contacted the CIA again to offer his services (he had already done so in 1970, before going to Chile), conspired with the Cubans who worked at AAMCO, and tried to aid Fatherland and Liberty from Miami. Agents of the DINA The 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat, led by General Augusto Pinochet, allowed Callejas and Townley to return to Chile. Mariana took the first flight to Santiago after the coup, while Michael put his affairs in order so that he could leave with the children. The CIA had not contacted him, and, even though his wife assured him that he was not in any danger, he worried about the charges against him in Chile. He decided to travel under a false name, that of his friend Kenneth Enyart, who gave him his birth certificate and social security card, documents with which he obtained a passport. It was Colonel , who, upon learning of Townley's work for Fatherland and Liberty, invited him to join the military dictatorship's secret police, the Direcci√≥n de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA). Michael did so under the name Andr√©s Wilson; Mariana joined as Ana Luisa Pizarro. In his novel Las cenizas del C√≥ndor, the Uruguayan Fernando Butazzoni tells how Callejas and Townley, along with their two small children, went with Colonel Espinoza to San Crist√≥bal Hill in Santiago, to test at a distance the detonators from the bomb that would eventually end the life of General Carlos Prats. Callejas would try to justify herself years later by saying that they were going through a bad time and that they needed money to support the family. But Taylor Branch and Eugene M. Propper affirm in their book devoted to the assassination of Orlando Letelier, Labyrinth, that both agreed to work for the DINA with pleasure, and that they considered it an honor. In addition to participating in the 1974 attack in Buenos Aires that ended the life of Prats, Callejas accompanied her husband on other missions, particularly one in Mexico the following year. Callejas traveled, under her DINA alias, to Mexico City in early 1975 on a mission to eliminate opponents of Pinochet. Among the objectives were Allende's widow Hortensia Bussi, the socialist Carlos Altamirano, and the communist Volodia Teitelboim, but the mission turned out to be a complete fiasco. They did not hit their targets, and almost exploded the mobile home in which they were traveling with Virgilio Paz, an anti-Castro Cuban. She also accompanied Townley in the operation to assassinate Orlando Letelier and his secretary Roni Moffit on 21 September 1976 in Washington. It would be for this crime that Townley would fall into the hands of American justice. He was handed over in Chile in April 1978 and taken out of the country by FBI agents. This also ended the idyll of Callejas with the military junta. House in Lo Curro: torture and literature Shortly after the 1973 coup, the DINA turned over a mansion ‚Äì three floors, almost 1,000 square meters of building and 5,000 square meters of land ‚Äì to Michael Townley and his wife Mariana Callejas. The large house, delivered in recognition of the services provided by the couple to the secret police of the dictatorship, was located in the upper part of Santiago, in , Via Naranja 4925. Legally it was not theirs; it had been acquired by then-Army Major Ra√∫l Iturriaga and a DINA lawyer who died in strange circumstances in 1976, under a false identity. The idea was for it to serve as a home for married agents and their children, and at the same time, for the Quepulill√°n barracks to operate there, from which terrorist operations abroad would be planned. This barracks had two permanent agents, who served as drivers and assistants, and a secretary, who kept the accounts and assisted the proprietor with administrative tasks. In addition, the team included a gardener, a cook, and two chemists: Francisco Oyarz√∫n and Eugenio Berr√≠os, alias Hermes. The latter spent their days locked in a laboratory, experimenting with the effectiveness of sarin gas on mice and rabbits as part of the so-called Project Andrea. On the second floor were the Townley workshops, where they performed radio and telephone interceptions, in addition to designing electronic detonators. There they also made the 119 false passports that served to cover the deaths of the same number of Chileans killed by the DINA in Chile. As part of the so-called Operation Colombo, it was made to appear that these Chileans had been executed by their own colleagues in Argentina and Brazil in 1975. Several terrorists from the right also stayed there, such as the neo-fascists led by Stefano Delle Chiaie and Cuban exiles from Operation 40. This house, where the Spanish-Chilean diplomat Carmelo Soria and others were tortured and murdered, was also the headquarters of a popular literary workshop led by Callejas. Callejas, on returning to Chile, began to frequent the literary workshop of Enrique Lafourcade, which was held at the National Library in Santiago and was attended by writers who would later form the . \\"Do you know Bobby Ackermann?\\" is one of the stories that Callejas wrote and that favorably impressed Lafourcade and the other members of the workshop. With this monologue of a veteran Jewish tailor, she won El Mercurios Rafael Maluenda short story competition. At the beginning of her attendance at the Lafourcade workshop, Townley used to pick her up by car, and many times they dropped off the writer at home, thus gaining his trust. Lafourcade not only stimulated her writing, but also sometimes influenced her to publish it. Thanks to him, she was also able to participate in the lunch that Chilean writers shared with Jorge Luis Borges in 1976. Callejas considered that this workshop was not enough, so she decided to organize one in her house to which she invited not only young people who attended the Lafourcade workshop, but also recognized writers like the latter. It once included Nicanor Parra and others. Gonzalo Contreras says about that workshop (which met until 1978): Contreras and Carlos Franz ‚Äì who maintains that Callejas \\"wrote good stories\\" ‚Äì arrived by bus at a bridge where Townley himself was waiting for them in a small car, and in the night, before the curfew, an employee took them back to the stop. \\"I came with an assface that I can not explain. He would not open his mouth, that motherfucker. I felt that he detested us, and that this side of her, he detested it.\\" To Franz, the opportunity he had, \\"so young, to know the traps, the false floors, and double personalities generated by a dictatorship\\", he \\"has made much of a great literary opportunity.\\" \\"I have already written three novels, originated in part from these stimuli,\\" he admitted in 2008. Carlos Iturra is the only writer who did not repudiate her and who is still her friend. Iturra affirms that Callejas is \\"a great writer\\", says that he \\"would be very honored\\" to take charge of the unpublished works she produces, and predicts that \\"after death she will be read avidly.\\" Cristi√°n Aiguader ‚Äì son of Jaume Aiguader, former mayor of Barcelona, minister of the Second Republic and one of the founders of the Republican Left ‚Äì who arrived in Chile after the Spanish Civil War and prospered in Santiago as a trader and man linked to culture, defines Callejas in his book Lucha inconclusa: memorias de un catal√°n exiliado a Chile as the author of \\"some stories of heavy psychological weight.\\" One of them referred to the capture of an opponent of the dictatorship: \\"The description was so realistic and with such a wealth of details that, although it is not strange in a great writer, it seemed like something lived.\\" Mariana Callejas published La noche larga in 1980, a book of stories with a black cover, in whose upper right corner there is a green eye behind bars. In some of these stories, she describes torture sessions and how C-4 bombs were made. In that story, Callejas redeems Max, the murderer, and shows him to be sensitive, reading Walt Whitman and being touched when he sees a dead bird next to a statue. That same year she received a mention at the Andr√©s Bello Novel Prize for Los puentes and the following, in 1981, she won the ' story contest ‚Äì the jury was composed of Jorge Edwards, Mart√≠n Cerda, Marco Antonio de la Parra, and the editor of the magazine ‚Äì with Jess Abraham Jones. This provoked a negative reaction both from readers and a group of artists and intellectuals, who wrote a letter of protest, reproduced in issue No. 17. The magazine explained that the story was awarded and not the author, and that, for the rest, the contestants presented themselves with pseudonyms, and therefore their identities were not known until after the judging. Anthay Lipthay, one of the loves of Callejas and a fellow DINA agent, defined her as an \\"extraordinarily intelligent and skillful woman.\\" \\"She liked to relate intimate details of her experiences on the kibbutz, customs, obligations, equality between the sexes, liberality in erotic manifestations. And in this last detail, I remember that Mariana was pleased to abound in images and even evoke some of her own experiences,\\" Lipthay said in a judicial statement. Trial and sentencing Mariana Callejas was accused of being the co- perpetrator of the murder of General Prats and member of a conspiracy. According to the head of the DINA, Manuel Contreras, it would have been she who pressed the button of the bomb that killed the general and his wife, Sof√≠a Cuthbert, in Buenos Aires on 30 September 1974. This was confirmed by her ex- husband, Michael Townley, who specified that Callejas made a first attempt to detonate the explosive device, but could not blow it up, and that the device was then activated by him. These statements were made by Townley in 1999, in Washington, and at that time he asked that his testimony not be used against Callejas. But according to the Argentine judge Mar√≠a Romilda Servini, the role played by the former in the attack \\"was affirmed by other records.\\" Servini requested the extradition of Callejas, as a result of which she was arrested on 17 July 2003 and placed under house arrest after being interrogated for more than three hours by the Supreme Court minister. But after a few days, on 22 July, she was granted provisional liberty. , the visiting minister who was investigating the Prats case, tried Callejas on 1 September 2003 together with former DINA official as the perpetrators of the double murder of General Carlos Prats and his wife. Callejas was detained that same day at the Women's Orientation Center, where she would remain for nine months. In July 2005, the Chilean judiciary rejected the request made two years earlier by Judge Servini to extradite Callejas. After establishing during the trial in Chile that in September 1974 Callejas had traveled to Buenos Aires with Townley to kill Prats by means of a remote-controlled bomb, she was sentenced on 30 June 2008 to 20 years in prison in the court of first instance, a sentence confirmed by the Court of Appeals in January 2009. In 2010, the Supreme Court annulled the 20-year sentence handed down by the first and second instances, bestowing on Callejas a sentence of only five years and without imprisonment. Mariana Callejas died on 10 August 2016, at age 84, in a nursing home in the Santiago commune of Las Condes. In film and literature In 2008 the Uruguayan director Esteban Schroeder premiered the film Matar a todos, inspired by the life of Mariana Callejas, who is played by Chilean actress Mar√≠a Izquierdo. Izquierdo related that she reviewed all of the available bibliography of Callejas, and with that knowledge, had total freedom to compose the character. The workshop and what happened at her home in Lo Curro ‚Äì literary evenings in parallel with the detention and torture in her basement ‚Äì has led to the writing of several texts: the chronicle Las orqu√≠deas negras de Mariana Callejas by Pedro Lemebel (included in his book ', LOM, Santiago, 1998); a part of the novel By Night in Chile by Roberto Bola√±o; the story \\"Ca√≠da en desgracia\\" by Carlos Iturra (part of the volume Crimen y castigo, Catalonia, Santiago, 2008). Nona Fern√°ndez dedicated her first theatrical work to her, titled El taller, which premiered in 2012.

The film released in Italy on 22 December 2010. Plot Andrea, twenty-eight, is engaged to Livia, a girl suffering from anorexia and to whom the protagonist has never said \\"I love you\\". The boy is supported by a wealthy mother, Cristina, with whom he has a difficult relationship, and was abandoned by his father when he was a child, thus harboring a deep hatred towards him. During the surprise party for his birthday he finds a letter from his father, who is hospitalized in Africa; his mother tries in vain to persuade him not to go to him. So, Andrea goes to Africa and, once he arrives at the hospital, he discovers that his father has gone into a coma. Man has very little left to live: in fact, he dies the next day. Andrea believes he made a useless journey. He wants to go home, but he is entrusted with his 8-year-old black brother, Charlie, who his father had had with a dead African woman. For Andrea, Charlie is a dead weight, an unbearable child, and he absolutely doesn't want to keep him with him. He tries to dump it to the baby's grandfather, but to no avail. So, perhaps even starting to grow fond of him, she decides to take him with her to Italy. But Livia, who lives with Andrea, disagrees very much and hates Charlie for a long time, because she has ruined both of their lives. The child has to go to school, where he is not well, cries all the time and would like to go back to mum and dad. Andrea looks for a family to adopt him, and in the meantime he keeps his little brother with him. Things get complicated with Livia, and she leaves him where a family is found who wants to adopt Charlie. Finally, both Livia and Andrea have grown fond of the child, and deep down they both know they don't have the strength to send him away. Charlie is not adopted by that family and continues to live with Andrea and Livia, who have returned together. Andrea even manages to stop hating his mother, who reveals to him that in all the years her father was in Africa she had written him many letters, which she had kept hidden.

The screenplay was written by Dhar and Gazal Dhaliwal, with the story inspired by the 1919 novel A Damsel in Distress by P. G. Wodehouse. It stars Anil Kapoor, Sonam K Ahuja, Rajkummar Rao and Juhi Chawla, and features Seema Pahwa, Brijendra Kala, Alka Kaushal, Akshay Oberoi, and Regina Cassandra in supporting roles. The film tells the story of Sweety Chaudhary, a closeted lesbian, and her attempts to come out to her conservative and traditional Punjabi family. The film is the first collaboration between real-life father and daughter Anil Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor, and marks the Bollywood debut of Regina Cassandra. It was released worldwide on 1 February 2019. The screenplay was selected by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its library's Core Collection. Plot A young Punjabi woman, Sweety Chaudhary, is under pressure from her traditional family to marry. She meets a young woman named Kuhu and Kuhu's brother Raza at a wedding. A year passes. In Delhi, Sahil Mirza is a playwright though not very successful, and his father, a famous film producer, thinks he should give up being a playwright. Sweety sees a rehearsal of his latest play and remarks that it is amusing but the romance is superficial. A man comes chasing her, and Sahil helps her flee. She escapes while Sahil fights the man, and Sahil accidentally hits a policeman. At the police station, Sahil learns that the man is Sweety's brother Babloo, and they live in Chaudhary Manor, Moga, Punjab. Sahil wants to see Sweety again and decides to write his next play in Moga. He is joined by Chatro, a caterer and enthusiastic amateur actress. Sweety and Babloo's single father, Balbir Chaudhary, runs Chaudhary Garments, a clothing company. He actually wanted to become a cook, but his mother Beeji insists men do not belong in the kitchen. Babloo claims that Sweety has been going to Delhi to see a Muslim boy, so she must not be allowed to leave the house. Sahil goes to the manor with a letter for her. He sees Balbir cooking. Incorrectly assuming Balbir is the cook, Sahil pays him to give the letter to Sweety. This convinces Balbir that Sahil is Sweety's Muslim boyfriend. Sahil next pays Balbir's employee Chaubey to pass along a message to Sweety, and Chaubey tells Sahil that Sweety loves him though the family disapproves of her dating him because he is Muslim. A few individuals employed by the family bet on who Sweety will marry, with the cook Billauri betting on someone from a matchmaking app. Chaubey bets on ‚ÄúMr. X‚Äù, any unknown outsider. Sweety learns Sahil is holding acting classes, and goes with Beeji and Billauri to the class. Sahil and Chatro are invited to Beeji's birthday party the following day. At Beeji's party, Chatro bonds with Balbir over cooking. He notices Sahil enjoying the party and tells the others that Sahil is Sweety's Muslim boyfriend. Chaubey hides Sahil and brings him to Sweety's room. Sahil says he loves her. She tells him Babloo lied and she is actually in love with a girl. Sahil is astonished and too drunk to properly respond. The next day, he cancels the acting class. Billauri saw Chaubey taking Sahil to Sweety's room and blackmails him into exchanging their bets. She helps Sweety see Sahil again. Sweety explains that she did not fit in as a child and now she hides the truth about herself. She is in a relationship with Kuhu. Babloo discovered this and tried to stop it, but she continued to see Kuhu in Delhi. She is glad to have a friend to confide in, and Sahil is glad to be her friend. Sweety wants to join Kuhu in London and study art there, yet she does not want to run away from her family. Chatro tells Balbir she is divorced with kids, and feels her kids should be free to marry or not, and to marry whomever they want to, regardless of religion. This inspires Balbir to invite Sahil to dinner and announce Sweety's engagement to him, which Babloo encourages. Sweety resolves to marry Sahil to make her family happy, though Sahil is against this. Sahil's supportive mother reminds him about a successful play he wrote that was based on a true story. He offers to write a play for Balbir's upcoming fashion show, with Balbir, Chatro, and the others as the actors. Sahil writes a romance titled Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, which will star Sweety and Kuhu. Balbir at first finds the story absurd, but Sahil defends it as a fresh new story. Babloo is supposed to be away but finds out about the play and reveals Sweety is actually in a relationship with Kuhu, not Sahil. Balbir leaves angrily, though Sweety declares the show will go on. As it becomes apparent the play is about a romance between two women, members of the audience start to leave, though many remain. After Balbir reads Sweety's diary and sees how she has felt lonely and misunderstood, he returns to the stage to defend Sweety and Kuhu. He is now accepting and supportive. The audience applauds. Later, Sahil's father congratulates him on his fresh new play. Sweety suggests Sahil present the play in other places for others like her. Balbir opens a restaurant and starts a relationship with Chatro. Billauri, claiming the gender of ‚ÄúMr. X‚Äù is irrelevant, wins the bet on who Sweety would marry. CastProduction Principal photography began in Patiala on 29 January 2018. Initially, Anil Kapoor began filming and Sonam Kapoor joined the production shortly thereafter. It is produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra under the banner of Vinod Chopra Films.

Reception=Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 77% approval rating based on thirteen reviews, with an average rating of 6.89/10. Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it four stars out of five and wrote, \\"In the context of a commercial filmmaking tradition that has usually been appallingly uncaring of LGBTQ sensibilities, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha... is a whiff of fresh air, a huge leap forward from 2008's Dostana. It does not seek to derive mirth and frivolity from the theme, offering instead an earnest, unapologetic depiction of the act of coming out in a conservative society.\\" He found the story \\"simple enough and is told in a manner that could be faulted for being overly chaste ‚Äî the same-sex lovers embrace a few times but they do not as much as plant a kiss on each other's cheeks, let alone lips ‚Äî but the film achieves something far bigger than a Bollywood crowd-pleaser can....[It]...goads the audience to think differently without trying to deviate from its primary purpose, which is to deliver entertainment.\\" Gaurang Chauhan of Times Now rated the film three and a half stars out of five, and although he faulted the comedic conflict of Sweety being mistaken by her family as \\"in love with a 'musalmaan'\\", he concluded that \\"Overall, Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga is an important, well-intended film that is high on entertainment, boasts of great performances and rightfully deserves all the applause.\\" Ananya Bhattacharya of India Today gave it four stars out of five, opining, \\"Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga sets out to smash our ideas of right and wrong....It is an important film for the times we live in....Sonam Kapoor and Anil Kapoor, along with writer Gazal Dhaliwal and director Shelly Chopra Dhar, deliver a brilliant lesbian love story that Bollywood should be proud of.\\" Film critic Taran Adarsh gave the film three stars out of five, and said it was \\"brave\\" and \\"will surely trigger debates about love and life....\\" =Box office= Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga collected 2.90 crore on the first day of release.

Its buildings were designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland), Thomas Robert Gladwin and Boulton & Paul Ltd and built from 1892 to 1960. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 2016.  History  Yeronga State School opened in February 1871 as Boggo Primary School, to accommodate the growing population of a previously rural district on the southern outskirts of Brisbane. To serve the school's growing pupil numbers, extensions were made and buildings added to the site. Yeronga State School retains: four connected sectional school buildings that were constructed in three stages (1927, 1928 and 1933); a Depression-era brick infants school building (1941); and a Boulton & Paul pre-fabricated timber-framed building (1954) with Department of Public Works (DPW) designed extensions (1954 and 1958). The school buildings are set amongst landscaped grounds with mature shade trees, a decorative entrance gateway (1945), a forestry plot (established 1939) and sporting facilities. The school has been in continuous operation since establishment and has been a focus for the local community as a place for important social and cultural activity. Historically part of an area called \\"Boggo\\", which ran from Dutton Park to Rocky Water Holes (later Rocklea, ), and which was part of the traditional lands of the Turrbal and Jagera people, Yeronga's development was spurred on by transport improvements. Development of the Darling Downs made the Ipswich Road the main route to the interior, and the initial rough track was surveyed in the 1860s. The first sales of Crown land in the Yeronga area, involving 154 acres (62.3ha), had taken place in 1854. Land use in the area moved towards dairying and crops, including arrowroot, cotton, sugar, corn and potatoes. To address the education needs of the predominantly rural community, Yeerongpilly School was opened in 1867 as a semi-private school. Classes took place in the Boggo Wesleyan Church.Ros Gillespie, 1996, Boggo Yeronga and Beyond, Leaving Footprints - Making Pathways, 1871 - 1996, Yeronga State School Parents and Citizens' Association, Yeronga, p.10. Attendance varied greatly and averaged below the minimum 30 pupils necessary for the Board of General Education to build a national school.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.10 The provision of state-administered education was important to the colonial governments of Australia. National schools, established in 1848 in New South Wales, were continued in Queensland following the colony's creation in 1859. Following the introduction of the Education Act 1860, which established the Board of General Education and began standardising curriculum, training and facilities, Queensland's national and public schools grew from four in 1860 to 230 by 1875.Thom Blake, \\"Educating Queenslanders\\" in Queensland Historical Thematic Framework, 2007 (rev. 2013 by EHP), p.2. The State Education Act 1875 provided for free, compulsory and secular primary education and established the Department of Public Instruction.Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, State Education in Queensland: a brief history, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1984, p.2. The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of early communities and integral to their success. Locals often donated land and labour for a school's construction and the school community contributed to maintenance and development. Schools became a community focus, a symbol of progress, and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. By the early 1870s, an increasingly prosperous local community had been established in the Yeronga area, comprising predominantly farmers and merchants.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.7. As attendance grew, Yeerongpilly School, which had been recognised as a provisional school in 1868,A provisional school could be opened with as few as 15 (later 12) pupils. The Board gave financial assistance to local committees to set up and maintain these schools. The Yeerongpilly Provisional School may have been located in Shottery Street, Yeronga, as this was where a Mr E Scriven was living in 1933and a newspaper article from that year identified his residence as the former site of the Boggo Provisional School ('Yeronga School Diamond Jubilee', The Queenslander, 1 June 1933, p.9)Ros Gillespie, 1996, pp.10-12Greg Logan and Eddie Clarke, 1984, p.2Hector Holthouse, Looking Back. The first 150 years of Queensland schools, a report for the Department of Education, Queensland, 1975, pp.16-17. achieved national school status and was re-opened on its current site as Boggo Primary School in February 1871, with over 70 students enrolled.The Brisbane Courier, 4 February 1871, pp.4-5 A new one-room timber school building and playshed were built for the re-opening of the school, which was located on the corner of what is now known as School Road and Park Road, Yeronga.Department of Education and Training (DET), Yeronga State School and Infants' School Heritage Application, November 2015, p. 5Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.13. By 1876 the school was known as Boggo State School,A school committee for the State School at Boggo was appointed in mid-1876 ('Official Notifications', The Telegraph, 15 July 1876, p.3). as a result of the State Education Act 1875. In 1878-79 an additional timber school building was constructed that could accommodate 80 pupils.Centenary Celebrations, Yeronga State School, Yeronga State School Parents and Citizens' Association, Yeronga, 1971, p.12. With the arrival of the Corinda‚ÄìYeerongpilly railway line (Corinda to South Brisbane via Yeronga) in 1884,'Railways and other public works', The Brisbane Courier, 18 June 1884, p.7. improved access led to increasing urbanisation in the area. Yeronga developed as a prestigious riverside suburb, with the large homes of wealthy settlers surrounded by the original farms, and Boggo State School was renamed Yeronga State School in 1886.DET, 2015, p.3. That year a head teacher's residence was built on the west side of the school, which occupied a 20-acre (8.1ha) site bordered to the north and east by a recreation reserve (reserved 1882, later Yeronga Park). The school's site was officially designated a Reserve for a State School in 1895.Survey plan S312116, 1886, DNRMQueensland Government Gazette, Volume 64, 3 August 1895, p.360. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. Tree planting events were reported at Yeronga State School as early as April 1892, when ten camphor laurels and silky oaks were planted during a gathering of over 200 parents and children.'Yeronga State School', The Telegraph, 30 April 1892, p.3. By 1894, Arbor Day was celebrated as a general holiday for Yeronga students, with entertainment organised by the Yeronga State School Committee.'Yeronga State School, Arbor Day Coming', The Telegraph, 6 April 1894, p.6. Yeronga, like many riverside suburbs in Brisbane, was significantly affected by the flood of 1893. Residences were inundated and the school was used as a refuge for flood victims.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.28. The flood led to a loss of confidence in the lower lying areas of Yeronga and resulted in reduced housing development until the beginning of the 20th century, when improved public transport led to further settlement and the area became predominantly working class. Attendance at Yeronga State School continued to steadily increase despite the floods and the economic depression of the 1890s. However, building at Yeronga State School was halted and did not resume until 1914, when a new open-air annexe was constructed to a standard DPW design.DET, 2015, p.5. To help ensure consistency and economy, the Queensland Government developed standard plans for its school buildings. From the 1860s until the 1960s, Queensland school buildings were predominantly timber-framed, an easy and cost-effective approach that also enabled the government to provide facilities in remote areas. Standard designs were continually refined in response to changing needs and educational philosophy and Queensland school buildings were particularly innovative in climate control, lighting, and ventilation. Standardisation produced distinctly similar schools across Queensland with complexes of typical components.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.84, 120-1. Plans for the new 1914 open-air annexe show it had a single classroom and a teachers' room off the west-facing verandah. The new hip-roofed annexe was connected to the northeast corner of the existing T-shaped timber school building, with the playshed situated to the northwest.DPW plan R5-7-10-4. \\"Yeronga State School, New Open Air Annexe E. C. Building, Improvements Etc\\", 1914. The playground at Yeronga State School, 1923 Enrolments continued to increase at Yeronga State School, from 236 in 1914, to 260 in 1916, and 325 by 1917.'Open-Air Schools, Yeronga State School', The Telegraph, 23 November 1914, p.3Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.37. Population growth in the area was facilitated by the extension of the Ipswich Road tramway line to Yeronga Park, in 1915. In March 1917, the school grounds were reduced to just over 15 acres (6.3ha) when excised land to the north was amalgamated into Yeronga Park.Survey plan SL667, 1917, DNRM. In June that year a delegation from the Yeronga State School Committee appealed to the Minister for Public Instruction for the immediate construction of an infants' school.'Additions to Yeronga State School', The Brisbane Courier, 20 July 1917, p.6. An additional open-air annexe was subsequently built to the north of the playshed at a cost of ¬£1,156 and officially opened in May 1918.'New Annexe, Yeronga State School', The Telegraph, 11 May 1918, p.13. The new annexe had a Dutch-gable roof and was with a wide verandah, teacher's room and hat room, and lavatories and a play area underneath.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1918, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1918, p.3Photograph \\"In the playground at Yeronga State School\\", ID 106328, John Oxley Library, 1923. Between 1927 and 1933 four sectional school buildings were added to Yeronga State School, to address further increases in attendance during the 1920s, with 900 enrolled in 1927.'Yeronga State School, Opening of Additions', The Telegraph, 7 November 1927, p.8. The new school buildings occupied higher ground to the north of the existing school site that had previously been used as sports grounds.'Yeronga State School, New Wing Opened', The Telegraph, 12 November 1928, p.7. Attention to improving light and ventilation to achieve an optimum classroom had culminated in 1920 with the sectional school,Building type D/T1 according to: Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study: Conservation Management, Report for the Department of Education, November 1996, p.30. a high-set timber structure. This fundamentally new design combined all the best features of previous types and implemented theories of an ideal education environment. It proved very successful and was used unaltered until 1950. This type was practical, economical, and satisfied educational requirements and climatic needs. Most importantly, it allowed for the orderly expansion of schools over time. Before the sectional school, solar orientation was not given prominence and all school buildings were orientated in relation to the street and property boundaries, often resulting in poorly orientated buildings. The sectional school type had only one verandah, typically on the northern side, allowing the southern wall, with a maximum number of windows, to be unobstructed. The building was designed so that the blank western wall was removable. As the school grew, the western end wall could be detached and the building extended in sections, hence the name. This led to the construction of long narrow buildings of many classrooms - a distinctive feature of Queensland schools.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.38-40. The first sectional school building at Yeronga was officially opened November 1927. The building (known as Block C in 2015) had a Dutch-gable roof and was aligned approximately east-west; it consisted of five classrooms, , with wide verandahs to the north, east and west sides.DPW plan R5-13-10-4. \\"Additional Classrooms Yeronga State School\\", 1926 The classrooms were linked by folding partitions, which could be opened to create an assembly hall. A teachers' room projected off the northern verandah, and the northeast and northwest verandah corners were enclosed. Additional teachers' rooms off the east and west verandahs were evident by 1929; however, they were not documented in the 1926 plan.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1929, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1929, p.48 Block C cost ¬£2,346 and could accommodate 200 pupils;DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1928, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1928, p.9. it was intended as the central portion of a group of new buildings, with future extensions planned for all four corners, connected by verandah walkways.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1928, 1928, p.9DPW plan R5-13-10-4, \\"Additional Classrooms Yeronga State School\\", 1926 In 1928 the two existing open-air annexes were relocated, extended and remodelled as sectional school buildings, and attached to the southwest (Block E - 1914 annexe, with wide classrooms and hipped roof) and southeast (Block B - 1918 annexe, with wide classrooms and Dutch-gable roof) corners of Block C. The buildings had five classrooms each, accessed via north-facing verandahs.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1928, 1928, p.9. At the official opening in November 1928, it was noted that the three new buildings could accommodate a total of 650 students.'Yeronga State School, New Wings Opened', The Telegraph, 12 November 1928, p.7. In 1929, overcrowding at Yeronga was further alleviated by the opening of Moorooka State School.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.46. A fourth sectional school building (Block D) was officially opened as part of belated Jubilee celebrations for Yeronga State School in May 1933.'Yeronga State School, New Wing Opened by Minister, Diamond Jubilee', Daily Standard, 29 May 1933, p.7. Plans from 1932 show the building had a hipped roof and five classrooms, , separated by fixed partitions with centred double-leaf doors.DPW plan 82-16-7. \\"Yeronga State School Additions, Plan\\", 1932and \\"Yeronga State School Additions, Plan Under Building\\", 14 October 1932, 82-16-17-1, DPW 16101272 The wide south-facing verandah had a hat room in the southwest corner and was connected to the northwest corner of Block C by a covered walkway.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1933, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1933, p.11. The understorey had concrete bracing walls positioned at all corners and in the centre.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1933, 1933, p.11. The building cost ¬£1,723 and brought the total student accommodation of the sectional school buildings to 880. Enrolments at the time numbered 1,100 students, with the balance accommodated in the remaining buildings for infants on the old school site. With the sectional school buildings occupying the site of the former sports grounds, efforts were made to provide alternative sporting facilities and improve the school grounds. In 1927 three acres of timber and stumps were cleared in preparation for a new oval in the northeast corner of the school grounds.'Yeronga State School, Opening of Additions', The Telegraph, 7 November 1927, p. 8 In 1931, Yeronga State School was granted another acre of land, which included the eastern end of the oval, to be permanently reserved for State School purposes.'Yeronga School Lands', The Brisbane Courier, 6 April 1931, p. 7Survey plan SL1247, 1931, DNRM. The extended oval was officially opened in May 1933. A school swimming pool was excavated to the southwest of the oval; however, it was never completed.Funds raised were used to purchase a new film projector in 1941: \\"¬£200 Film Machine Installed at Yeronga State School\\", The Telegraph, 22 May 1941, p.14. The school committee was responsible for much of the improvement works and concerts were held at the Ideal Picture Theatre in Yeronga to raise funds for Yeronga State School improvements fund.'Yeronga State School Concert', The Brisbane Courier, Tuesday 9 August 1927, p.31. Labour under the Unemployment Relief Scheme was also utilised to assist with grounds improvements.Ros Gillespie, 1996, pp.52-53. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building program to provide impetus to the economy.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp.6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work program by the DPW. This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big program contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p.5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p.5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1930, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1930, p.15. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.58. In June 1932 the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power from a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression. The government embarked on a large public works building program including government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p.8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p.7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p.2. Most were designed in a classical idiom as this projects the sense of stability and optimism which the government sought to convey through the architecture of its public buildings. In the late 1930s the focus of improvement initiatives at Yeronga State School shifted, to address the needs of the Infants' School to the south. Infant classes commenced in 1893 at five Queensland Schools but development was delayed by the 1890s Depression and infant classes were usually accommodated by adapting existing accommodation. Brick infant blocks were constructed at Windsor State School (1933), Morningside State School (1936) and Yeronga (1941). The construction of substantial brick school buildingsBuilding type E/B1 according to: Burmester et al, Queensland Schools, A Heritage Conservation Study: Conservation Management, Report for the Department of Education, November 1996, p.42. in prosperous or growing suburban areas and regional centres during the 1930s provided tangible proof of the government's commitment to remedy the unemployment situation. The Depression-era brick school buildings form a recognisable and important type, exhibiting many common characteristics. Frequently, they were two storeys above an open undercroft and built to accommodate up to 1000 students. They adopted a symmetrical layout and prominent central entry. Ideally, the classrooms would face south with the verandah or corridor on the north side, but little concession was made for this and almost all brick school buildings faced the primary boundary road, regardless of orientation. Classrooms were commonly divided by folding timber partitions and the undercroft, where one existed, was used as covered play space, storage, ablutions and other functions.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.59-60. Despite their similarities, each Depression-era brick school building was individually designed by a DPW architect, which resulted in a wide range of styles and ornamental features being utilised within the overall set. These styles, which were derived from contemporary tastes and preferences, included: Arts and Crafts, typified by half-timbered gable-ends; Spanish Mission, with round-arched openings and decorative parapets; Art Deco, with monumental entrance, stylised and stepped decoration, and strong horizontal and vertical lines; and Neo-classical, with pilasters, columns and large triangular pediments. Over time, variations occurred in building size, aesthetic treatment, and climatic-responsive features.EHP analysis of Depression-era Brick Schools, based on contemporary photographs, QHR listed schools, Project Services Heritage Reports (2006) and original DPW building plans. The Chief Architect during this period was Andrew Baxter Leven (1885-1966), who was employed by the Queensland Government Works Department from 1910 to 1951, and was Chief Architect and Quantity Surveyor from 1933 to 1951.Ayr State High School School, QHR 601574. The DPW architect involved in the design of Yeronga Infants' School was Thomas Robert Gladwin.DPW plans R5-20-10-4-1 and R5-20-10-4-2. \\"Yeronga State School, New Infants\\" Block', 1939DET, 2015, p.6. Yeronga's new brick infants school building (known as Block L in 2015) was opened by the Queensland Treasurer, Frank Cooper, on the 26 September 1941.'State Treasurer Opens New Block at Yeronga School', The Telegraph, 26 September 1941, p.2. Externally, Block L adopted a combination of Arts and Crafts and Art Deco-style decorative treatments, giving it a domestic quality quite different to the more imposing Neo-Classical style brick schools from the Depression-era. The symmetrically-arranged single- storey building, above an undercroft, had a face brick exterior with rendered decorative elements, and featured a central projecting entrance bay to the front (south) elevation that had a stepped, rendered parapet. The Dutch-gable roof was clad with Tuscan tiles and featured a decorative central fleche with finial. On the first floor there were eight classrooms accessed by a central corridor that aligned east-west: four classrooms on the north side, , separated by panelled folding partitions; and four on the south side, wide, separated by fixed partitions with central doorways. Hat / cloak rooms were situated adjacent to the two internal stairwells.DPW plans R5-20-10-4-1 and R5-20-10-4-2. \\"Yeronga State School, New Infants\\" Block', 1939. The building could accommodate 320 pupils and was approved in October 1940, with an anticipated cost of ¬£10,139.'New Infants' Block for Yeronga State School', The Courier Mail, 12 October 1940, p.6. The new building was situated in the southwest corner of the school grounds, to the north of the remaining 19th century school buildings, and a forestry plot had recently been established on the eastern boundary.Aerial photograph taken 20 April 1936, ADA11-6355, NRMDPW Plan R5-18-10-4, \\"Yeronga State School block plan showing levels\\", 1939. Forestry plots were the product of after-school agricultural clubs, introduced in 1923 at primary schools, under the \\"home project\\" scheme. School forestry plots were seen by the government as a way of educating the next generation about the economic and environmental importance of trees, as well as providing testing grounds for new species. The sale of timber grown in school plots provided an additional source of income for the school, and the plots themselves were an attractive feature of school grounds. The first school forestry plot was established at Marburg State Rural School in 1928, where 275 exotic and indigenous trees were planted.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.61. The Yeronga State School Forestry Club was formed in May 1939.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.73. A plot was cleared and holes were dug eight feet apart in preparation for the first Club Day on June 25, 1939, when the trees were planted. In November 1939 there were 168 native trees in the forestry plot; and 200 exotic pine trees (three main varieties) by 1950.Ros Gillespie, 1996, pp.73-74. Each child was assigned a pine tree to care for and had their name on a board nailed to the tree. Like many Queensland state schools, Yeronga was affected by the outbreak of World War II. Due to the fear of a Japanese invasion, the Queensland Government closed all coastal state schools in January 1942, and although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. The closed schools were sometimes occupied for defence purposes, and some schools remained closed \\"for special reasons\\" after the rest had reopened.'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p.3Ronald Wood, Civil Defence In Queensland During World War II, 1993, p.79. Yeronga Park was occupied by the United States Army and Australian Army - and later, by women from the Netherlands East Indies Army - from 1942, and the Yeronga Infants School was closed to pupils and occupied by the Australian Army as part of a Bulk Issue Petroleum Oil Depot (BIPOD) in Yeronga Park from March 1942 to May 1944.'Preparing Yeronga for Infants' The Courier Mail, 30 June 1944, p.3. The Australian Army also requisitioned the southern part of the school grounds in 1945.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.75 Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools, often by parents and staff. By February 1942, of trenches had been fully excavated at Yeronga state school, with another half done.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.77. By May 1944 the military had vacated the Infants' School, which was subsequently prepared for re-occupation by school children.'Preparing Yeronga for Infants', The Courier Mail, 30 June 1944, p.3 Other works to the school at this time included: toilet blocks with concrete walls and metal roof vents, constructed under Block B (southeast corner) and Block E (southwest corner);DPW plans 8C-259-1, 8C-259-2 and 8C-259-3, \\"Yeronga State School, Boys and Girls WCs\\" December 1944 and a decorative gate with iron \\"Yeronga State School\\" nameplate and rendered columns added to the Park Road entrance in 1945.Centenary Celebrations, 1971, p.23. The post-World War II period was a time of enormous population growth Australia-wide and was accompanied by a shortage of building materials. The Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp.28-31. At Yeronga State School, additional classrooms were required to accommodate the growth in pupil numbers. In 1954 a timber Boulton & Paul Building was constructed to the southeast of the sectional school buildings.DPW plan 6-20-5. \\"Yeronga Inf. State School, Temporary Building, Improvements to Lighting\\", October 1949Aerial photograph taken 1 August 1951, BCC5-39426, NRMBuilding type F/T1, according to Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.114. Responding to materials shortages and the pressures of the baby boom, the DPW imported a British prefabricated building system from manufacturers Boulton & Paul Ltd of Norwich. Based on an planning and construction module, the prefabricated elements in the Boulton & Paul system included wall panels, ceiling panels, roof trusses and banks of awning windows. The buildings were constructed at many schools across Queensland between 1952 and 1958.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 73-4While ordered in 1951, delivery of the Boulton & Paul classrooms was delayed, with the first classrooms constructed from mid-1952 to meet immediate accommodation requirements and those of the upcoming 1953 school year. Department of Public Works Annual Report, 1952, pp.4-5. Boulton & Paul buildings were timber-framed and clad, had a verandah as circulation, and a gable roof. Ideally, they were orientated so the verandah faced north and the classroom faced south but were also added as extensions to existing buildings regardless of orientation. The building could be high or low-set and had extensive areas of timber-framed awning windows, providing more glazing than had ever been used in Queensland classrooms; almost the entirety of the verandah wall and the opposite classroom wall were glazed, providing excellent natural ventilation and lighting. The classrooms were , larger than most previous classrooms.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p. 45. The flexibility of the system meant that the number of classrooms constructed could vary to suit the needs of a particular school. The highset Boulton & Paul building at Yeronga State School (known as Block F in 2016) was situated southeast of Block E, orientated at an angle to the sectional school buildings. Glazed screens were located at each end of the northern verandah, including along the covered walkway that connected to Block E. The walls were constructed from prefabricated units, wide, with those on the north and south sides containing large areas of windows. Units were pre-clad with chamferboards, with the edge of vertical timber boards between each unit visible on the exterior of the first floor. The understorey was enclosed with continuous chamferboards to the south and west, and had bracing fins. The three classrooms were separated by fixed partitions, with wide folding doors (DPW Standard) to the west and a single-leaf door to the east.DPW plan 8-548, \\"Yeronga State School, 3 New Classrooms (Each 24\\" x 24') B&P;', February 1954. As the school population continued to rise, more classrooms were required. Extensions to Block F were made in 1954 with two classrooms added to its eastern end. This extension was designed by the DPW to match the Boulton & Paul section, and illustrates the influence that the Boulton & Paul buildings had upon subsequent school building designs. Immediately after their introduction, DPW developed a standard building, which was similar to the Boulton & Paul building but was constructed in the traditional manner. DPW standard drawings included options for lowset and highset structures on piers, as well as elevated structures on floor trusses.DPW plan S860, \\"Standard School 24\\" Wide Classroom, Typical Arrangements', July 1954Building type F/T4, according to Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.116Building type F/T5, according to Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.116. These types adopted many of the Boulton & Paul design features, such as a covered play space under the classrooms and the extensive areas of glazing, but became permanent structures. These architectural features became characteristic of a class of building which was the dominant school type constructed in the 1950s.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, p.116. The 1954 extension was highset on piers and was distinguishable from the Boulton & Paul section of Block F by its continuous chamferboard cladding to both understorey and first floor. The glazed screen at the eastern end of the Boulton & Paul building was removed to facilitate the continuous north-facing verandah, which was accessed by enclosed stairs at the eastern end of the extension. There was extensive glazing to the north and south walls. The two classrooms were separated by a fixed partition with a single-leaf door at the southern end.DPW plan 8-548, \\"Yeronga State School, B&P; Paving and Parade Area\\", October 1954. In 1958 the building was extended again to the east end of the DPW building, with a floor plan that diverted to align parallel with the sectional school buildings. This extension was similar to the design of the earlier DPW section but was elevated on timber floor trusses that provided open space underneath.DPW plan S854, \\"24\\" 0\\" Floor Truss', February 1954. It comprised two classrooms, a teachers' room and a store room to the first floor. The wide verandah had a balustrade of hat and bag racks that were clad with crimped iron, and stairs at the eastern end. The exterior was clad with chamferboards and there was extensive glazing to the first floor and understorey of the southern wall, and to the northern verandah wall. The concrete slab of the understorey was set lower than the earlier sections of Block F and was accessed by concrete steps.DPW plan 8-646, \\"Yeronga State School Additions E\\", July 1958. Over the course of the school's history, buildings have been added and removed, and changes made to the school grounds to meet the school's requirements. In 1944 the playshed was demolished and in 1946 the early timber school building was sold and removed.'Former Pupil Sells School at Auction', The Telegraph, 10 December 1946, p.3 In 1959 tennis courts were opened in the northwest corner of the grounds, adjacent to Honour Avenue.Ros Gillespie, 1996, p.92. In 1971 a two-storey facebrick and chamferboard building (known as Block A in 2016) was built to the north of Block C and the residence was demolished; replaced by the large brick Dental Therapists' Training Centre in 1974.DPW plan 8-1065-2, \\"Yeronga State School, New Wing\\", July 1971DET, 2015, p.7. Other additions include: a tuckshop, covered play area and activities hall to the south of Block F; a substantial Early Childhood Development Program centre and prep-school buildings to the east of Block L; and a war memorial and gate to Honour Avenue situated northwest of the oval. The sectional school buildings, Blocks B, C, D and E, have been subject to additions and interior reconfigurations but remain fairly intact externally. In 1958 the gable-roofed northern teachers' room was extended to include an additional staff room and hallway.DPW plan 8-646, \\"Yeronga State School Additions\\", July 1958. In 1960 each of the four sectional school buildings were reconfigured from five classrooms to four, and the verandah walls were demolished and rebuilt as louvres over shelves; existing studs were retained where possible. The stairs to Block D and E were also repositioned and bag rack balustrades were added to the verandahs, which were subsequently enclosed with awning windows sometime after 1971. Flat-sheeted ceilings were also added; however, it is possible the original coved ceilings, tie rods and latticed vents remain above. Further remodelling of the interiors was undertaken in 2000 when large openings were created in the former verandah walls and classrooms were reconfigured in Block B (four classrooms), D and E (three classrooms). An external lift was added to the east of the link between Block B and Block C in 2016. The Boulton & Paul buildings with DPW extensions, Block F, remains fairly intact externally apart from enclosure of the verandahs to the 1954 sections with awning windows and crimped-metal cladding to the western wall. In the late 1990s large openings were formed in the verandah walls of 1954 sections and some classroom partitions were relocated; however, boards fixed to the ceiling indicate the former partition locations. The Boulton & Paul section has been reconfigured from three classrooms to two classrooms and a kitchenette. The verandah wall windows of the western classroom in the 1958 section have been replaced with modern louvres and modern partitions have been added to form offices.DPW plan 02-0008-03, \\"Yeronga State School Block E - Proposed Refurbishment, As Built\\", February 2000. Changes to the brick infants' school building, Block L, have been minor and the exterior remains substantially intact. Some external doors have been replaced and a room has been built in the undercroft with modern face brick. On the first floor, the former hat and cloak areas adjacent to the stairwells have been replaced with classroom and storage spaces. Original folding partitions between the northern classrooms have been removed but remaining bulkheads and returns demonstrate the former layout. Doorways have been inserted at either end of the central corridor and large openings have been created in two of the southern classroom walls to the corridor. Offices with modern partitions have been built in the former northeast classroom. In 2016, the Yeronga State School continues to operate from its original site. The school is important to the area as a focus for the community, and generations of students have been taught there. Since establishment, Yeronga State School has been a key social focus for its community with the grounds and buildings having been the location of many social events.  Description  Site plan, 2016 Yeronga State School occupies a 6.7ha site within Yeronga, a residential suburb approximately south of the Brisbane CBD. The school is located on the corner of Park Road and School Road, and is bounded to the north by Honour Avenue, and to the northeast and east by Yeronga Park and the Yeronga Pool complex. The site is divided (by a modern brick Dental School building) into two areas, with the 1920s-50s timber school buildings (Blocks B, C, D, E & F) on the northern part of the site, facing Park Road; and the brick Infants' School building (Block L) on the southern part of the site, set back from and facing School Road. With its decorative entrance gate on Park Road, mature perimeter trees, and range of timber and brick buildings, the school makes an important visual contribution to the streetscape. The school complex also comprises a sports oval in the northeast corner of the site, the remnants of a forestry plot on the eastern boundary, and a variety of mature shade trees that are mostly positioned along the site boundary, sports oval perimeter, and to the east of the Infants School. = 1927-1933 sectional school buildings (Blocks B, C, D and E) = Sectional school buildings, from left to right: Block D, Block C, Block E, 2016 The four sectional school buildings are set back from Park Road and are aligned approximately east-west. The buildings are timber-framed and weatherboard-clad structures, highset on concrete piers, with corrugated metal-clad hipped (Blocks D and E) and Dutch-gable (Blocks C and B) roofs. The buildings were constructed in three phases between 1927 and 1933 (Block C, centre; Block B, southeast and Block E, southwest; and Block D, northwest) and are connected via enclosed verandah walkways. The north-facing (Block B, C and E) and south-facing (Block D) verandahs are enclosed by bag rack balustrades (Block B, C and E) and modern awning windows, and are accessed by external timber stairs. The remodelled open-air annexe buildings (Blocks B and E) have wider classrooms and verandahs than the other sectional school buildings. A range of early timber joinery is retained throughout the buildings including the large banks of casement windows with fanlights in the southern walls, which demonstrate the original five-classroom room layouts. East and west end walls are windowless. The interior walls and raked verandah ceilings are lined with timber v-jointed (VJ) tongue-and-groove (T&G;) boards. Windows in the former verandah walls have been removed and large openings have created an open-plan arrangement between the former verandah and classroom spaces. Classroom layouts have been reconfigured and original partitions removed; however, some partitions and bulkheads remain to demonstrate the former layout. The classroom ceilings have been lowered and lined with flat sheeting (1960). The understories combine open areas for play, and enclosed areas with a variety of concrete, corrugated metal and weatherboard-clad partitions that form storage areas and toilet blocks (1945). The concrete slab floors have perimeter surface drains. Elements not of cultural significance include modern additions and alterations such as: extensions and enclosures; carpet and linoleum floor linings; sheeted ceilings; added partitions; and joinery, fixtures and fittings.  1927 Central Block (Block C)  Block C has verandahs to the north, east and west sides, all of which are enclosed. The interior contains four classrooms defined by part and full-width partitions (1960). Remnants of the four original partitions survive as bulkheads that demonstrate the original layout. Teachers' rooms are attached to the north, east and west sides of Block C; they are gable-roofed and weatherboard-clad, and feature skillion window hoods with timber brackets. The east and west-facing teachers' rooms have casement windows with fanlights, and battened gable infills. The interior walls and flat ceilings of all three teachers' room are lined with VJ, T&G; boards. The northern teachers' room has been extended (1958) with a staff room and hallway added, windows reconfigured and modern louvres added. The understorey of the extended northern teachers' room is enclosed with weatherboard-clad walls (1958). The southwest corner of the understorey is clad with corrugated metal sheeting. A modern covered walkway links Block C to Block A to the north.  1928 Southeast Block (Block B)  Block B contains four classroom spaces, with fixed partitions defining the two eastern classrooms, and the two western classrooms divided by wide-leaf folding doors (1960). One fixed partition remains in its original location between the eastern and western classrooms. The Dutch-gable roof has louvred vents in the gable ends. The western end of the understorey has been enclosed with concrete walls and glass louvres (1945) to form a toilet block.  1928 Southwest Block (Block E)  Block C contains three classrooms divided by a fixed partition to the east and folding doors to the west (1960). One fixed partition remains in its original location between the central and eastern classrooms. The southwest corner of the understorey is clad with corrugated metal sheeting and the eastern end is enclosed with the concrete walls and glass louvres of a former (1945) toilet block. A metal extraction vent (1950) protrudes from the southwest corner of the hipped roof. A covered walkway with timber screen (1954) connects with Block F to the southeast.  1933 Northwest Block (Block D)  Block D contains three classrooms divided by fixed partitions. One partition between the central and eastern classrooms is in its original location. Concrete bracing walls are located between piers at the corners and centre of the understorey. The western end has been enclosed. = 1954-58 Boulton & Paul building and DPW extensions (Block F) = Block F is a long, highset, timber-framed building with a gable roof clad in corrugated metal sheeting. It comprises: a 1954 Boulton & Paul (B&P;) section at the western end (two classrooms and kitchenette); a 1954 DPW-designed section in the centre (two classrooms); and a 1958 DPW-designed section at the eastern end (one classroom, a teachers' room and store room, and modern offices). The plan form is angled, with the 1954 sections diverting southeast from the sectional school buildings, and the 1958 section returning to parallel (east-west). A verandah continues the length of the northern side of the building, accessed by three sets of timber stairs (1954 B&P; and DPW stairs attached-to, and 1958 stairs set-within, the verandah). The exterior is clad in timber chamferboards, including the southern and western sides of the understorey. The B&P; section is clearly distinguishable from the DPW sections by the breaking up of the external cladding by the edges of vertical timber boards between each panel of the prefabricated wall units on the first floor. Large areas of timber awning windows with fanlights line the southern wall of each section; timber brackets supporting the overhanging eaves are attached to the mullions. The end walls of the classroom level are windowless - the western end being clad with crimped metal sheeting. The stairs to the 1954 DWP section are clad with weatherboards and feature a glazed timber screen that is similar to the original B&P; timber screen with square glass panes that survives on the western side of the covered walkway to Block E. The verandah has timber floors and large sections of bag rack balustrades that are clad with weatherboard (B&P; section) and crimped metal sheeting (DPW extensions). The verandah of the B&P; section and part of the 1954 DWP extension is enclosed with modern awning windows above the bag racks, and external metal-louvred screens. Double-hung sash windows, with fanlights, are retained in the verandah walls of non-enclosed sections, with the exception of the 1958 western classroom, where they have been replaced with modern louvres. Large openings have been formed in the former verandah walls of the 1954 sections, creating an open-plan arrangement between the verandah and classrooms. The interior of the B&P; section is lined with panels of flat sheeting, with cover strips, on the walls and ceiling. Vertical members of the structural system are evident on the south wall, between pairs of windows. The classroom layout has been reconfigured (formerly three classrooms) and original partitions removed; however, their former location is evident in the ceiling linings. Non-significant interior elements include modern partitions, cupboards, wall and floor linings, and kitchenettes. A large opening has been created in the classroom wall between the B&P; and central DWP sections. The interior of the DPW section is similar to the B&P; section, but without the expressed wall structure on the south wall. The southern windows are also set slightly () lower than those in the B&P; section. The interior of the eastern DPW section is lined with flat sheeting, with cover strips; excluding the former western classroom, which has been substantially altered including the re-lining of the walls and addition of modern partitions to form offices. The understorey combines open play space and enclosed areas for teaching and storage; it has a concrete floor that steps down at the junction between the 1954 and 1958 sections. The floor structure of the classrooms above is exposed; the bearers of the 1954 sections are supported on concrete piers, while the 1958 section has open timber trusses. Awning windows, with fanlights and a continuous flat hood, are set between the trusses on the southern wall of the 1958 section and modern louvres enclose the northern side. The open play area under the B&P; section retains original timber bracing fins either side of an opening in the southern, single-skin wall. = 1941 Brick Infants' School building (Block L) = Brick infants school building (Block L), 2016 Block L is a symmetrical, masonry structure of one storey above an undercroft level. The building is orientated east-west and faces School Road; set back behind an open playing field with perimeter trees. The building is rectangular in plan and a projecting entrance bay, flanked by twin stairs to a first-floor landing, is centred on the southern (front) elevation. A tall fleche with decorative finial prominently projects above the Dutch-gabled roof, which has been clad with modern corrugated-metal sheeting. The building is elegantly composed and ornamented with a combination of Arts and Crafts and Art Deco- style decorative treatments. The face brick is primarily red-brown and has contrasting rendered plinth, windowsills and stringcourses. The projecting entrance bay features a stepped, rendered parapet and doorway surround, with the words \\"YERONGA STATE SCHOOL\\" below. This Art Deco-style detailing is repeated on the two entrances to the undercroft, at either end of the northern (rear) elevation. The front entrance stairs have concrete treads and decorative metal balustrade with square metal posts; rendered stringers contrast with the face brick base. Along the front and rear elevations, continuous window hoods with Arts and Crafts-style decorative timber brackets shelter the first storey windows. Windows openings are regularly spaced and contain banks of timber-framed, three-light casement windows, with fanlights above. The interior layout of the building is symmetrical with first-floor classrooms arranged either side of a central corridor that aligns east-west, between two internal stairwells. A perpendicular entrance hall, flanked by a current and former teachers' room, connects to the central landing. The four southern classrooms retain original partitions, although one large opening has been formed between two rooms and walls have been removed between the east and west end classrooms and the corridor. The northern classrooms have been reconfigured to accommodate a kitchenette and some offices but retain original partition bulkheads, which demonstrate the former layout. Modern doors are located at both ends of the corridor and hat rooms adjacent to the stairwells have been partially enclosed for storage space. The stairs are concrete and have metal balustrades with timber handrails. Internal walls are generally plaster-lined with simple skirtings, and classrooms retain timber picture rails. Original timber double-hung windows and double doors with large, three- light fanlights remain in the internal corridor walls. Ceilings are lined with flat sheeting and ornamented by timber battens forming a grid pattern. All classrooms retain their original latticed ceiling vents. Original timber double-hung windows and double doors with large, three-light fanlights remain in the internal corridor walls. A bronze plaque in the entrance reads \\"Opened 26 September 1941 by HA Bruce MLA\\". Non-significant elements include modern carpet or linoleum floor linings, cupboards and kitchenettes, and added doors and partitions. = Landscape Elements, Grounds and Views = The grounds are well-established and contain mature trees including figs (Ficus spp.), camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), poincianas (Delonix regia) and various eucalypts species. Large figs on the boundary enhance the school's prominence in its location and provide a picturesque setting for the school buildings. Several mature trees are situated to the east of Block L, and plantings associated with the former school residence include a mature mango tree (Mangifera spp.) to the east of the Dental Therapists Training Centre. A decorative gateway (1945), with rendered columns and metal arch that reads \\"YERONGA STATE SCHOOL\\", frames the main pedestrian entrance from Park Road. The generous playing field (1927‚Äì33) to the northeast of the school buildings comprises a level sporting oval with concrete retaining walls to the western end and an earth embankment with stone-pitched drain to the southeast. Mature figs frame the northwest perimeter of the oval, including the canopies of several trees that are part of adjacent Yeronga Park. A forestry plot (established 1939), situated south of the oval, contains a range of mature trees including pines (Pinus spp.) and camphor laurels. = Other Structures = Other buildings, structures, sheds, footpaths and roads within the cultural heritage boundary are not of cultural heritage significance. Where the register boundary extends into road reserve, the road and footpath fabric is not considered to be of cultural significance.  Heritage listing  Yeronga State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 11 March 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Yeronga State School (established 1871 as Boggo Primary School) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. The place retains representative examples of standard government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies; set in landscaped grounds with a decorative entrance gateway, assembly and play areas, sports oval, a remnant forestry plot and mature shade trees. The four connected sectional school buildings (1927, 1928 and 1933) demonstrate the culmination of many years of experimental timber school design, providing equally for educational and climatic needs. The Depression-era Brick Infants' School Building (1941) and formation of the sports oval (1927‚Äì33) are the result of the State Government's building and relief work programs during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The Boulton & Paul Building (1954) demonstrates the introduction and adoption of imported prefabricated systems by the Queensland Government in response to acute building material shortages and population growth in the post-World War II period. The Department of Public Works (DPW) designed extensions (1954 and 1958) demonstrate the influence of Boulton & Paul Buildings on subsequent DPW school designs. The forestry plot (established 1939) is important surviving evidence of a movement to convey the economic and environmental importance of forestry to students while creating an attractive landscape feature and income for schools. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Yeronga State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of Queensland state schools. These include: teaching buildings constructed to standard designs; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The school is a good, intact example of a suburban school complex, comprising the following building types. The sectional school buildings are good examples of their type and are externally intact. Characteristics include: their highset form with play space beneath; blank end walls; northern verandahs, with linkages between buildings; large banks of south-facing windows, projecting teachers' rooms and early internal linings. The Depression-era Brick Infants' School Building is a good, intact example of its type and retains a high degree of integrity. It demonstrates the principal characteristics of Depression-era Brick Schools, including: its symmetrically arranged form, with an undercroft; high-quality design with ornamental features from a variety of styles; face brick exterior; prominent central roof fleche; and projecting entrance bay. The Boulton & Paul Building is a good, intact example of its type, and clearly demonstrates the characteristics of a prefabricated building through the expression of its modular construction in the external cladding. Other characteristic features of this type include: its timber-framed, lightweight construction; gable roof; verandah for circulation, with glazed screens at the ends; large areas of glazing to the south walls; flat internal wall linings; and timber bracing walls to the understorey. Designed to match the Boulton & Paul classrooms, the DPW-designed extensions are good, intact examples of their type and demonstrate two iterations of the DPW standard designs for highset timber school buildings: on concrete piers (1954); and incorporating timber floor trusses (1958). The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Through its substantial size, high quality materials, face brick exterior, elegant formal composition and decorative treatment, the Depression-era Brick Infants' School Building at Yeronga State School has aesthetic significance due to its expressive attributes, which evoke the sense of progress and permanence that the Queensland Government sought to embody in new public buildings in that era. The building is also significant for its streetscape contribution. Standing on an open corner site and framed by mature fig trees, it is an attractive and prominent feature of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Yeronga State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It was established on its current site in 1871 through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of the community and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

Its genre is eastern. The film was developed by LIMELITE Production in collaboration with TV Channel ‚ÄúUkraine‚Äù, Media Group Ukraine, Ukrainian State Film Agency (Derzhkino) and a Swiss production studio ‚ÄúFilm Brut‚Äù. The film was released in wide distribution in Ukraine on 9 November 2018. The screen version of Serhiy Zhadan's novel has already won The Connecting Cottubs Best Pitch Award 2016, The Connecting Cottubs Producers Network Award 2016, The Connecting Cottubs Pitch Award 2017 and The Connecting Cottubs Work-In- Progress Award 2017.  Plot  The protagonist, Herman has to come back to his native Donbass after years spent away. He has to look into the case of his brother's sudden disappearance. Herman meets real and unreal characters, his childhood friends and the local mafia. And suddenly, to his own surprise, he decides to stay in his native town with people who love and believe him and need his defense. = Original source: novel \\"Voroshylovhrad\\" = The plot of the tape is based on the novel by Serhiy Zhadan \\"Voroshylovhrad\\". However, the director Yaroslav Lodyhin and the author of the original source Serhiy Zhadan agreed before the filming of the tape that the book and the film should be delimited, since these are two different types of works, and the book \\"should be left behind.\\"  Cast  * Oleg Moskalenko - Herman * Volodymyr Yamnenko - Kocha * Oleksiy Gorbunov - Pastor * Ruslana Khazipova - Olya * George Povolotsky - Travma * Eugenia Muts - Nikolai Nikolaevich * Igor Portyanko - cameo  Production = Estimate = The cost of the film was 1 million 100 thousand euros, 1 million 200 thousand dollars. In 2016, the film project became the winner of the ninth pitching of Derzhkino, where the film received 15 bln rubles of state budget funds. Eventually, on the Coco Best Pitch Award and the Coco Producers Network Award, the film received an additional ‚Ç¨1,500,000 In March 2018, it became known that in 2017, the film also collected more than ≈Å1.1 million (40,000 Swiss francs) on the Swiss wingfanging platform \\"wemakeit.com\\". Kyivstar, an unnamed Fund and TRK Ukraine joined the film to finance the film. = Preparation for filming = In February 2013, Ukrainian director Yaroslav Lodyhin informed that he, along with writer Serhiy Zhadan, began preparing for the adaptation of the novel \\"Voroshylovhrad\\". Initially, the cost of the film should have been from 500 thousand to 1 million hryvnia. Negotiations with investors were held in Ukraine and abroad. For some time there was an idea to create a series of 4‚Äì8 series mini-series based on the novel, which would begin in 2014 in the basement of the SBU, where the investigator tried to find out what the heroes were doing during the occupation of the city. However, they rejected this idea, because a different story was already coming out. = Filming and post- production = The film began on July 31, 2017, in Starobilsk, the hometown of Serhiy Zhadan, in which events are described in the novel. Filming the tape in Starobilsk lasted a little more than a month, then continued in Kyiv and ended at the end of September 2017. [16] After the filming, the installation of the tape began until the spring of 2018. On September 4, 2018, producers presented a finished ribbon Derzhkino. = The language of the film = Most of the film's characters spoke a mixture of Ukrainian and Russian (surzhyk). \\"The Wild Fields\\" became the second full-length film in the history of Ukrainian cinema, after the film Assumption (2017), where almost all the actors speak surzhyk. Directed by Yaroslav Lodyhin, he decided to shoot the film. According to Lodyhin, \\"most heroes will speak [...] a surzhik. People with higher education will speak pure Ukrainian or pure Russian, but since the number of such heroes is small, then most will speak surzhyk. \\" Lodyhin also noted that himself Starobilsk [where the action takes place] is surrounded by Ukrainian- speaking villages, where there is a huge amount of surzhyk . = Soundtrack = Most of the musical themes in the film were written by composer and famous pianist Fima Chupakhin.

It is the 20th overall episode of the series and is written by co-executive producer Laura McCreary and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr.. It aired on Fox in the United States on March 11, 2014. The show revolves around the fictitious 99th precinct of the New York Police Department in Brooklyn and the officers and detectives that work there. Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) is an immature yet very talented detective with an astounding record of crimes solved, putting him in a competition with fellow detective Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumero). The precinct's status changes when the Captain retires and a new commanding officer, Cpt. Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher) is appointed as the newest Captain. This creates a conflict between Peralta and Holt over their respective methods in the field. In the episode, Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio) makes Peralta his best man, and while planning everything for the wedding, Peralta discovers that Boyle's fianc√©e has asked him to move with her to Canada. Meanwhile, Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), Santiago, and Gina Linetti (Chelsea Peretti) start a diet that turns out to be harder than expected. The episode was seen by an estimated 2.49 million household viewers and gained a 1.2/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. The episode received positive reviews from critics, who praised Boyle's character development and Crews' performance. Plot Boyle asks Peralta to be his best man, which Peralta accepts. Boyle then gives him a magazine called \\"Fancy Brudgom\\" (\\"brudgom\\" meaning \\"groom\\" in Danish) to inform him of everything he needs to do for the wedding. Peralta and Boyle taste cakes and find Boyle a suit for the wedding. However, Boyle informs Peralta that Vivian is moving to Ottawa and he is going with her, even though he does not want to. Peralta tries to convince Boyle to tell Vivian how he feels, but he panics and brings her on a date with him so he can tell her. It backfires, and Boyle and Vivian leave. Peralta later forces Boyle to confront Vivian, and they decide not to move to Canada. Meanwhile, Holt makes Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) apologize to a patrol officer (Kevin Bigley) whom she humiliated. Jeffords, Santiago, and Gina start a diet together. However, Gina quickly loses the diet, and Santiago succumbs to junk food, upsetting Jeffords. Finally, Jeffords gives up, revealing that he was on a diet because his wife was also on a diet for all the hard work. Before he can give up, he is handcuffed to continue the diet. Reception=Viewers= In its original American broadcast, \\"Fancy Brudgom\\" was seen by an estimated 2.49 million household viewers and gained a 1.2/3 ratings share among adults aged 18‚Äì49, according to Nielsen Media Research. This was a slight decrease in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 2.61 million viewers with a 1.3/3 in the 18-49 demographics. This means that 1.2 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 3 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it. With these ratings, Brooklyn Nine-Nine was the second most watched show on FOX for the night, beating Glee but behind New Girl, sixth on its timeslot and tenth for the night, behind New Girl, a rerun of NCIS, a rerun of NCIS: Los Angeles, The Goldbergs, Growing Up Fisher, Chicago Fire, About a Boy, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and The Voice. =Critical reviews= \\"Fancy Brudgom\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Roth Cornet of IGN gave the episode a \\"great\\" 8.5 out of 10 and wrote, \\"'Fancy Brudgom' saw Jake once again rise to the occasion and come through for Boyle in his time in need, as Holt bestowed his leadership wisdom on Diaz - who seems to be a big believer in cruel to be kind. Meanwhile, Gina, Amy, and Terry starve in the name of love. The most effective portion of the episode was the A-storyline between Boyle and Jake, but the side-by-side B-storylines rounded out the episode nicely.\\" Molly Eichel of The A.V. Club gave the episode a \\"A-\\" grade and wrote, \\"But in each episode, Brooklyn Nine-Nine hits that 'heart' factor just right. Take how I initially felt about 'Fancy Brudgom': It was good, but I wasn't thrilled. Still, the more I thought about it, the more my affection grew. I can sit here and nitpick and fault Brooklyn Nine-Nine, but when it all comes down to it, I leave each episode feeling that warm and fuzzy feeling that exists when a show hits the sweet spot being trying too hard, miring itself in treacle territory, and when it elevates laughs to the point where it's cold and unfeeling. Each portion of the episode had this perfectly measured-out quality of heart.\\" Andy Crump of Paste gave the episode a 9.0 and wrote, \\"'Fancy Brudgom' is a major- minor episode‚Äîone that‚Äôs more about set-up and sweetness than actual incident ‚Äî but it nevertheless takes viewers someplace new.

Painted in March 1874, the painting depicts the scene at the Villa Escarras in Cannes, where Tinco Lycklama √† Nijeholt (1837-1900) organised a fancy dress party on February 16, 1874 for the Carnival holiday ‚Äì hosting over two hundred guests from the city‚Äôs international and local elites. The painting is an expression of the art of entertainment during the early days of the Belle √âpoque at the French Riviera. Two years earlier, in 1872, the then 35-year-old Dutchman Tinco Lycklama took up residence in Cannes, where he joined the fast-growing colony of foreign aristocrats and industrialists, who were acquiring and building luxury manors and villas in the sprawling resort. The majority of the international community would typically spend a few weeks or even months only during the winter, escaping from the cold in Northern Europe and Russia to the mild and healthy climate on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. The painting reflects the active social life in Cannes. The artist, Belgian-born Pierre Tetar van Elven, a court painter for King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy, was a personal friend of Tinco Lycklama, and stayed at the latter‚Äôs Villa Escarras at the time of the ball. He also drew two known black-on-white sketches that further illustrate the nature of the ball. One of the particularities about the ball is that the local newspaper ‚ÄúLes Echos de Cannes‚Äù, in its edition of February 21, 1874,title=Archives Journaux, Archives Municipales de Cannesurl=http://archivesjournaux.ville- cannes.fr/dossiers/echos/1874/Jx5_Echos_Cannes_1874_02_21_Page_01.pdf reported in detail about the participants and their costumes, as well as the general setting with the decoration, the menu, and the music.

Stretching between Auzia (Sour El-Ghozlane, Algeria) and Numerus Syrorum (Maghnia, Morocco, it was a portion of the North African border fortification and security line of the Roman Empire which reached from the Atlantic coast to the Limes Tripolitanus in Tunisia. Function In Roman North Africa there were no continuous border fortifications such as Hadrian's Wall in Britain. The transitions on the Limes Africanus between Roman territory and the free tribal areas were fluid and were monitored only by the garrisons of a few outposts. Their security tasks were further complicated by long communication lines and the lack of a clear border. The greatest danger was posed by the nomadic Berber tribes, which carried on sporadic warfare with Rome The chain of forts was primarily intended to mark the Roman domain. In many areas, the system also served to control and channel the migratory movements of nomadic tribes or peoples, including the monitoring and reporting of their activities, and as a customs border. This Limes was therefore not so much a military border security system, but rather a monitored economic border with the free nomadic peoples and hill tribes. The Limes could not have withstood a coordinated military attack. History Roman Ruins in Volubilis, Morocco Ruins of the Roman Arch of Trajan at Thamugadi (Timgad), Algeria During his civil war Julius Caesar defeated the partisans of Pompey at the Battle of Thapsus in 46 BC. After the battle the previously independent kingdom of Numidia, whose king, JubaI had sided with Pompey, was divided. Part of it was assigned to the Kingdom of Mauritania, and the other was added to the Roman province of Africa. The Kingdom of Mauritania was founded in 33 BC and bequeathed to Rome by King Bocchus II. The kingdom was initially under direct Roman rule. In 25 BC Augustus appointed Juba II as ruler of the client kingdom, but he did nothing to pacify the hinterland. In 23 AD his son Ptolemy succeeded him and put down an uprising against Rome. When Ptolemy visited Rome in 40 AD, however, Caligula had him murdered, and annexed the kingdom. The revolt that erupted was suppressed in 44 AD. Claudius divided the territory of the former kingdom into the provinces Mauretania Caesariensis, with its capital at Colonia Claudia Caesariensium Iol, now Cherchell, and Mauretania Tingitana, with its capital initially at Volubilis, and later at Tingis, today's Tangier. In the African provinces, there was frequent unrest and uprisings during Roman rule. In 238 AD the governor of Africa, Gordian I, and his son Gordian II (as co-regent) were proclaimed against their will by the Roman Senate as the counter-emperor to Emperor Maximinus Thrax. However, their troops were defeated by the Legio III Augusta. Under Emperor Diocletian, the new province of Mauretania Sitifensis, named after its capital Sitifis (now S√©tif), was separated from Mauretania Caesariensis. In the 5th century, both provinces fell to the Vandals. Parts of Tingitana, Caesariensis, and Sitifensis were recaptured by the Byzantine Empire after the annihilation of the Vandal Kingdom by the Byzantine general Belisarius in the 6th century. Islamic expansion put an end to the rule of Byzantium in the 7th century. Topography Map of North Africa in Roman times The Atlas Mountains The North African Limes protected the provinces which stretched about inland from the Mediterranean. The geography of the provinces of Mauretania Caesariensis and Mauretania Tingitana was roughly divided into a variable-width coastal strip, followed by some very fertile mountain regions or river valleys, fading gradually into a steppe and desert steppe border area and mountain regions. The inhabitants of Mauritania, particularly in the Tingitana, were probably semi-nomadic hill tribes related to the Iberians. The eastern border of the province of Mauretania Caesariensis (identical to the eastern border of the later province of Sitifensis) ran approximately on a line west of Cape Bougaroun on the Ampsaga River to the east end of the Chott el Hodna and further west into the steppe landscape. This line also separated the sedentary population from the nomads, and formerly formed the border of the area dominated by Carthage. The southern border approached the coast along the northern slope of the Tell Atlas in the transition from Numidia to Mauretania Caesariensis. The Roman-dominated area thus shrank from a width of around to only around . The more north-facing border in Mauretania Caesariensis was roughly in line with the precipitation limit required for agriculture. The Roman armed forces, which were only weakly represented here, were also decisive for the initial limitation of the territory. The Roman area of influence, which was originally limited to the coast of Caesariensis, was extended further south for economic reasons into the Maghreb from the 1st to the 3rd century. This inevitably led to unrest among the local population, who feared for their livelihood. In the west, the River Malva (Moulouya) formed the border with the province of Mauretania Tingitana. An extensive barren plain separates Algeria from Morocco. In the north, the foothills of the Rif Mountains drop steeply into the sea, preventing a direct land connection along the coast. The connection between Caesaria and Tingis was therefore normally maintained by sea, since there were no areas between the two provinces that were economically used by the Romans. Roman influence and control in the province of Mauretania Tingitana stretched along the Atlantic coast to the Sala River (Bou Regreg) near Sala Colonia and the Atlas plateau around Volubilis, an area with high agricultural yield. The northern Rif and Atlas Mountains, however, were never permanently occupied by the military. The road network established by the Romans in North Africa ensured good and timely logistical connections for the trade and supply of their widely deployed troops. In Caesariensis there were three traffic routes running parallel to the coast. As a rule, however, the surfaces were unpaved. Natural traffic routes‚Äîlike rivers‚Äîwere not available in the province of Caesariensis. The border of the steppe was well developed for military reasons. Economy The main export products of both Mauretanian provinces were wood and purple dye as well as agricultural products. Tingitana exported wild animals for the circus games. The Moorish tribesmen resident here were eagerly recruited as auxiliary troops, especially as light cavalry. The residents of the coast lived in a symbiotic relationship with the nomads of the steppe and the hill tribes. At the beginning of the dry season, nomads and hill tribes moved to the coastal regions, hired themselves out as workers, and exchanged agricultural products for animals from their herds. Border and fortifications Rome's struggle against the barbarians was always characterized by the numerical superiority of the opponent. Rome was often forced to compensate for its inferiority through the use of technology. The Limes of the two Mauritanian provinces was not a continuous fortified border wall because of the considerable distance from the Atlantic to the eastern border of the province of Caesariensis. Instead, there were barriers (clausura) in the valleys of the Atlas, ditches (fossata), ramparts, and a series of watchtowers and castles. The installations were connected by a road network layed out on strategic considerations. The border security system was largely adapted to the circumstances of the topography, but also to the behavior and lifestyle of the ethnic groups living at that location, and was therefore hardly fortified in spots. The expansion of the border in Mauritania was intensified at the beginning of the 1st century AD and expanded somewhat further to the south until the 3rd century. East of the Monts du Hodna there was a system of clausurae, the Fossatum Africae, which \\"consisted of a ditch, wall, watch- towers, and gates.\\" This system is believed to date from the time of Hadrian, around the 120s AD. There are at least three separate sections of the fossatum; this section is the longest at around The fossatum \\"consists of a single ditch wide and deep, with a low wall not more than high.\\" In general the priority was to seal off the mountainous area by using natural obstacles. The Roman-occupied area of the province of Mauretania Caesariensis was defined by a line of fortifications running along the Chelif River (Chinalaph). This was secured by a series of watchtowers, built by Hadrian, around apart. The small depth of the controlled area suggests that the hill tribes resident here could never be subjugated. In the northwest of the province, the Rif Mountains drop steeply into the sea, preventing a direct land connection between the provinces. Beginning around 197 AD, the Severan emperors built a series of forts in western Caesariensis on the northern border of the plateau. The last fort in this series was Numerus Syrorum (modern Maghnia); it was west of the Tlemcen Mountains. The Hadrianic chain of forts on the Chelif River now served as an additional barrier and defense line. Mauretania Tingitana was difficult to control and defend due to its topography. In the northeast, the tribes of the Rif Mountains were a constant concern. Initially, there was no security line with watchtowers to better monitor the massif. The south-east trending and up to high Atlas runs abruptly into the Sahara on its eastern side. None of these regions could be conquered by Rome. Likewise, the easily accessible coastal areas of central and southern Morocco south of Rabat remained outside the Roman sphere of influence. The line of forts in Tingitana was mainly oriented towards the coast, or at least close to the coast, and was used to ward off Moorish attacks and pirate raids from the Rif and the Atlas. Because of the pirate threat, both coastal protection and the inland river Sububus (Sebou) were strengthened from the 2nd century onwards by the construction of forts in Thamusida, Iulia Valentia Banasa, and Tremuli (Souk El Arbaa). The Roman troops of the province were concentrated mainly in the forts on the coast and around the provincial metropolis of Volubilis. Sala and Volubilis, however, were outside the area protected by the forts on the river. Volubilis was exposed inland and therefore required major defense efforts. From the second half of the 2nd century, a city wall and numerous castra and observation posts served to protect the city. On the coast, the Sala was closed off from the Atlantic to the Bou Regreg by an -long moat, which was partially reinforced with a wall, four small forts, and around 15 watchtowers. Additional forts were built in Tamuda (T√©touan), Souk El Arbaa, and Oppidum Novum (Ksar el-Kebir) on the Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts. Due to increasing attacks by local tribes, the border in Tingitana was withdrawn to the line Frigidae (Azib el Harrak)‚ÄìThamusida under Diocletian in the second half of the 3rd century. The area around Volubilis was abandoned, while the city of Sala was probably kept until the early 4th century. In the beginning of the principate forts were rather rare in the provinces because the troops were deployed over a wide area. The forts and watchtowers that were built later were mostly rectangular and occupied . The smaller military posts, called fortlets or burgi, had a size of only , reinforced walls, no windows and only a small garrison. They were strategically located in the area and were used, among other things, to send messages by exchanging signals with the neighboring forts. Armed forces For defense and protection against uprisings and raids by nomadic and hill tribes, the Legio III Augusta was the only legion in North Africa outside of Egypt since the time of Augustus. This might initially appear to be spreading the forces too thinly, but was based on the economic assessment of the defense worthiness of arable land in contrast to regions of less importance that justified a less expensive defense effort. So, during Hadrian's visit in 128 extensive sections of the border areas along the deserts were not monitored by the Romans at all. The existing armed forces had the task of protecting the border line against raids from the steppe, mountain, and desert areas, but on the other hand they were not allowed to pose a threat to Rome. This balancing assessment between sufficient military means to avert an external danger and at the same time avoid an internal threat applied in principle to all provinces. Although the military potential was apparently temporarily overwhelmed, the legion and auxiliary units in North Africa were basically able to fulfill their mission. Until the early 1st century AD, except in Ammaedara (Ha√Ødra), there were no fixed military bases. Legionary and auxiliary units of the province were mainly stationed near the coast or in port cities. The Legion's location changed several times over time for strategic reasons, first from Ammaedara to Theveste (T√©bessa) and finally to Lambaesis. Under Gordian III. The legion was dissolved in 238 AD due to the successful suppression of a revolt under Gordian I and II, but was reconstituted around 256 during the reign of Emperor Valerian. In the meantime, depending on the threat level, the armed forces were briefly strengthened at times. In this way, in the time of Tiberius, the Legio IX Hispana moved temporarily from Pannonia to North Africa in 17 AD to fight against the rebellion of Tacfarinas. Later Antoninus Pius again temporarily increased troop strength in Mauretania due a rebellion. In the 2nd century, the auxiliary forces consisted of three alae and ten cohorts, a total of around 7,000 men, in Caesariensis, and five alae and at least ten cohorts, a total of around 8,000 men, in Tingitana. The auxiliary units were made up of soldiers from Gaul, Italy, and North Africa. From the 4th century, Berber tribal groups were increasingly recruited. However, the number of troops changed only slightly. In the provinces, however, the 1:1 ratio between the legions and the auxiliary units that was normally aimed for was not maintained; it was significantly less favorable. Frontpiece from the section Dux et praeses provinciae Mauritaniae et Caesariensis in the Notitia Dignitatum In late antiquity, according to Notitia Dignitatum three commanders had command authority over the troops stationed at this Limes (Limitanei and Comitatenses). These were: * for Tingitaniam (western Algeria, Morocco) of the Comes Tingitaniae * for intra Africam (Tunisia, Algeria, western Libya) the Dux et praeses provinciae Mauritaniae et Caesariensis. * The latter was under the command of the Comes Africae, the commander of the African field army, the Comitatenses. Fleet Roman trireme Mosaic, Tunisia Since Marcus Aurelius Rome, the undisputed saw naval power in the Mediterranean, was forced because of the ubiquitous pirate threat to station its own naval force in Caesarea under the command of a dux per Africam, Numidiam et Mauretaniam. The Mauritanian fleet (classis Mauretanica) was in existence since the end of the 2nd century AD (it was probably built around 176 AD). It was most likely Liburnians, with a trireme as the flagship. Initially only one squadron, composed of units from the Syrian and Alexandrian fleets, as an intervention force, this fleet ultimately turned out to be too weak to effectively prevent the raids of the Moors on Hispanic people that began after 170 AD. The fleet was used to protect the Northwest African and Spanish areas, especially the province of Baetica. Its other duties included securing the Strait of Gibraltar and escorting troops and goods from Europe to Africa. Its main base was in the provincial metropolis of Caesarea (Cherchell), further bases were in: * Cartennae (T√©n√®s), * Icosium (Algiers), * Portus Magnus (Arzew/Bethioua), * Saldae (B√©ja√Øa) and * Tipasa (Tipaza) See also *Roman military frontiers and fortifications ReferencesFurther reading *Nac√©ra Benseddik: Les troupes auxiliaires de l'arm√©e romaine en Maur√©tanie C√©sarienne sous le Haut Empire.

The establishment of schools was considered an essential step in the development of new communities and integral to their success. Schools became a community focus, with the school community contributing to their maintenance and development; a symbol of progress; and a source of pride, with enduring connections formed with past pupils, parents, and teachers.Project Services, \\"Mount Morgan State High School\\" in Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, 2008, pp.4-5Paul Burmester, Margaret Pullar and Michael Kennedy Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.87-8. The Coorparoo district continued to grow during the 1880s as Brisbane's population increased rapidly and moved to outlying areas, assisted by the development of public transport and the subdivision of land holdings. In 1887 a tramway was extended to Buranda, close to the western end of the Coorparoo district. In 1888 development had progressed so far that Coorparoo Shire, which included Stones Corner and parts of Holland Park and Camp Hill, was established. In 1889 the Cleveland railway line opened through the northern extent of Coorparoo Shire, adding to Coorparoo's popularity as a residential area. Coorparoo railway station was located about northeast of the school. The concurrent increase in Coorparoo State School pupils led to the school building being extended in 1885, 1887 and 1889.Leslie E Slaughter, Coorparoo Stones Corner Centenary 1856-1956, publisher, Brisbane, 1956, p. 71, 2017Project Services, \\"Coorparoo SS\\", p. 10Google maps, 2017: McKellar's Official Map of Brisbane & Suburbs (reflecting 1880s subdivisions), Queensland Gvt Printer, Brisbane, 1895, sheet 9. However, development in Coorparoo Shire slowed after floods in 1889, 1890 and 1893 widely affected the district and the 1893 economic depression affected land sales. In 1900 there were fewer houses in Coorparoo than in 1890.Project Services, \\"Coorparoo SS\\", p. 4. Nevertheless, improvements continued at the school. The Queensland education system recognised the importance of play in the school curriculum and, as school sites were typically cleared of all vegetation, the provision of all-weather outdoor space was needed. Playsheds were designed as free-standing shelters, with fixed timber seating between posts and earth or decomposed granite floors that provided covered play space and doubled as teaching space when required These structures were timber- framed and generally open sided, although some were partially enclosed with timber boards or corrugated galvanised iron sheets.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.16v. The hipped (or less frequently, gabled) roofs were clad with timber shingles or corrugated iron. Playsheds were a typical addition to state schools across Queensland between s and the 1950s, although less frequently constructed after , with the introduction of highset school buildings with understorey play areas. Built to standard designs, playsheds ranged in size relative to student numbers.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.21, 97. Type B/T5 There was a playshed on site at Coorparoo State School by 1887; located directly behind (southeast of) the school buildings.

School enrolments continued to rise, resulting in overcrowding; with two classes taught in the playsheds and two taught under the infants' open-air annexe. As a result, in 1924, the fifth and last extension to the timber school was built.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p. 22. An important component of Queensland state schools was their grounds. The early and continuing commitment to play-based education, particularly in primary school, resulted in the provision of outdoor play space and sporting facilities, such as ovals and tennis courts. Also, trees and gardens were planted to shade and beautify schools. In the 1870s, schools inspector William Alexander Boyd had been critical of tropical schools and amongst his recommendations stressed the importance of adding shade trees to playgrounds. Subsequently, Arbor Day celebrations began in Queensland in 1890. Aesthetically-designed gardens were encouraged by regional inspectors, and educators believed gardening and Arbor Days instilled in young minds the value of hard work and activity, improved classroom discipline, developed aesthetic tastes, and inspired people to stay on the land.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.4, 48-9. At Coorparoo State School, the small two-acre site provided only limited space for play and sporting facilities. To address this, more than along Halstead Street were purchased in 1912. In 1925, the school acquired another adjoining Tarlina Lane to the west of the school leading from Cavendish Road, while in 1926 the northeastern extent of the laneway was closed and adsorbed into the school grounds. In the same year, a further of land adjacent to the Shire Hall on Cavendish Road, was purchased from the Brisbane City Council for play space. In the following year, the Department of Education purchased of adjacent land. This, in addition to the previous Tarlina Lane purchase, became the site of the school pool, which opened on 3 August 1928, having cost to build.QSA Item ID14289 Coorparoo No 219 State School correspondence, letter from Crown Solicitor to the Under Secretary, Dept Public Instruction, 7 Nov 1912QGG, 10 May 1926, p. ? in QSA Item ID14290, Series 12607 School Files (correspondence) for State SchoolsCoorparoo State School, Coorparoo SS Centenary, Souvenir History 1876-1976, Coorparoo SS, Brisbane, 1976, p. 13DNRM, CoT 10910017Peg Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, pp. 22-3. Meanwhile, lobbying of the Department of Public Instruction by the school committee from 1926 for a brick school building to accommodate the rising school population resulted in approval for a rebuilding scheme comprising two linked, two-storey brick buildings, to be constructed in stages.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p .23. Former timber school building, February 1941 The urban brick school buildings constructed at Coorparoo State School were an individual design by the Department of Public Works. Brick school buildings were far less frequently built than timber ones, provided only in prosperous urban or suburban areas with stable or rapidly- increasing populations. All brick school buildings were individually designed with variations in style, size, and form, but generally retaining similar classroom sizes, layouts and window arrangements to timber schools to facilitate natural light and ventilation. However, compared to contemporary standard education buildings, these buildings had a grander character and greater landmark attributes.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, pp.18, 99QSA, Item ID 13693, Deputy Govt Architect, \\"Preliminary Estimate of Modified Plan - New State School Ascot\\", 9 May 1919. The first stage, constructed to the south-east of the existing timber classroom buildings, was completed and opened on 22 September 1928. The new two-storey wing (now called Block B) was and accommodated 320 pupils. It comprised four classrooms on each floor with enclosed corridors. The classrooms on the first floor were divided by folding partitions to provide one large room () for assembly purposes. The external brick walls above a string course were roughcast. Cavity walls were used which, combined with wide projecting eaves, provided temperature control inside the building. The construction was fireproof and soundproof between floors. It cost approximately .'Coorparoo School New Brick Building', Brisbane Courier, 24 Sep 1928, p. 11Department of Public Works. Report of the Department of Public Works for the Year Ended 30 June 1928.

Further additions to the school grounds were made in 1929 when an adjoining house and land to the west on Cavendish Road was purchased from Collin F Wolff for . The school committee paid of the cost in return for the proceeds from the sale of the house for removal. The Wolff family also donated to the school in appreciation of the school committee's work in the interests of the present and future pupils of the school. The resultant playing area was called \\"Wolff Park\\" and opened by Reginald King, Deputy Premier and Minister for Works and Public Instruction, on 31 July 1929. At the same time, the Minister acknowledged the donation of a school bell by William Payard, a lifetime friend of the head teacher, Gustav Henry Hinrichsen.'Generous Help', The Brisbane Courier, 1 Aug 1929, p. 3Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p. 25'New Playground', Telegraph, 1 Aug 1929, p. 12'New Playground', The Telegraph, 1 Aug 1929, p. 12'Gift to Coorparoo State School', The Telegraph, 2 Aug 1929, p. 7. The Great Depression, commencing in 1929 and extending well into the 1930s, caused a dramatic reduction of building work in Queensland and brought private building work to a standstill. In response, the Queensland Government provided relief work for unemployed Queenslanders, and also embarked on an ambitious and important building programme to provide impetus to the economy. Even before the October 1929 stock market crash, the Queensland Government initiated an Unemployment Relief Scheme, through a work programme by the Department of Public Works. This included painting and repairs to school buildings.'Relief of unemployment: big programme contemplated', The Telegraph, 24 July 1929, p.5'Unemployment: the relief scheme', The Telegraph, 26 July 1929, p.5. By mid-1930 men were undertaking grounds improvement works to schools under the scheme.DPW, \\"Report of the Department of Public Works for the year ended 30 Jun 1930\\", p.15. Extensive funding was given for improvements to school grounds, including fencing and levelling ground for play areas, involving terracing and retaining walls. This work created many large school ovals, which prior to this period were mostly cleared of trees but not landscaped. These play areas became a standard inclusion within Queensland state schools and a characteristic element.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools: A Heritage Conservation Study, p.58. As part of the government's attempt to provide work for the unemployed, intermittent, relief work was carried out on the Coorparoo State School grounds. This work was inspected by the Minister for Public Instruction, Reginald King, in March 1932. Between 1932 and March 1935, the Committee employed a relief labourer on two occasions to keep the school grounds clean and tidy.'Work of Relief Men', The Telegraph, 17 Mar 1932, p. 9'The School Committee Report' by E J Wruck cited by Coorparoo State School. Coorparoo State School magazine. Coorparoo State School, Coorparoo, Qld, 1937, p. 11. With continuing growth in pupil numbers at Coorparoo State School, further accommodation was required. The second stage of the rebuilding scheme commenced when the tender opened for erection of an additional wing in July 1930.'Metropolitan Schools' The Telegraph, 14 Jul 1930, p. 2. This section, on the Old Cleveland Road side of the stage 1 brick building, was completed early in the 1931 and was opened by the Minister for Public Instruction, Reginald King. The two-storey addition comprised two classrooms, two cloakrooms and a teachers room per floor and accommodated 160 pupils. Its walls were of cavity brick, and cloakroom floors were concrete. The roof over the addition was finished with a fleche. Elevations were completed to harmonise with the existing building: brickwork above a cement bank course at first floor level was roughcast; and the face bricks below were finished with white struck joints.

After the Forgan Smith Labor Government came to power in June 1932 with a campaign that advocated increased government spending to counter the effects of the Depression, the government embarked on a large public works building programme. This was designed to promote the employment of local skilled workers, the purchase of local building materials and the production of commodious, low maintenance buildings which would be a long-term asset to the state. This building programme included: government offices, schools and colleges; university buildings; court houses and police stations; hospitals and asylums; and gaols.'Labor at the Helm', The Worker, 20 Jul 1932, p.8'Queensland Parliament', The Northern Miner, 17 Aug 1932, p.2'Public Buildings', Daily Mercury, 19 Oct 1933, p.7DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1934, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1934, pp.6-8DPW, Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1935, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1935, p.2Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1936, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1936, p.2'State will spend over ¬£460,000: big building plans', The Courier-Mail, 28 Dec 1933, p.9Report of the DPW for the Year Ended 30 June 1939, Queensland Government Printer, Brisbane, 1939, p.2. Many of the programmes have had lasting beneficial effects for the citizens of Queensland, including the construction of masonry brick school buildings across the state. The programme enabled continuation of the rebuilding scheme for Coorparoo State School, warranted by the school's average attendance having grown to 1100 in 1932. A tender by Hector James Heaven of was accepted in May and the extension, to the eastern end of the stage 1 of Block B, was opened by Reginald King, MLA, on 29 October 1932.'Coorparoo State School', The Brisbane Courier, 10 Jun 1932 p. 9Coorparoo State School, Coorparoo SS Centenary, Souvenir History 1876-1976, Coorparoo SS, Brisbane, 1976, p. 11Coorparoo State School.

In 1933, the fourth and final section of Block B, with matching toilet blocks, was completed. This section, to the western end of the stage 1 building, comprised two classrooms on each floor with a verandah and a balcony and accommodated 160 pupils. Block B, 1941 The completed two-storey, symmetrical building contained 20 classrooms and accommodated 800 pupils and was set a few steps above ground level, with no undercroft. Both levels had a northwest verandah/corridor which accessed two stairs and eight southeast facing classrooms. A central bay of two classrooms, two cloak rooms and a store room projected north from the verandah making a total of 10 classrooms per level.Project Services, \\"Coorparoo SS\\", p. 8.

Also, as part of the building programme, the whole of the available yard space was graded, and the main playing area south of Block B was bounded by concrete retaining walls. A chain wire fence surmounted the north and east walls and three broad flights of steps led down from the Parade Ground to the main playing area. At the top of each of these stairways was placed a tubular arch, designed by the Head Teacher, GH Hinrichsen. A new tennis court and a new basketball court were completed in 1933. A retaining wall around the basketball court to its south and west was recorded on a 1936 site plan.Coorparoo State School. Coorparoo State School magazine. Coorparoo State School, Coorparoo, Qld, 1933, p. 9. The retaining wall is depicted on the 1936 Brisbane City Council Water Supply and Sewerage Detail Plan No. 672 (BCC Archives, Brisbane). On 30 September 1933 Reginald King, MLA opened the fourth section of the brick school building, a second tennis court, two lavatory blocks, the concrete retaining walls around the playing field; and the tubular arches over stairways.'Important Step', Courier-Mail, 2 Oct 1933, p. 5'Additional Wing for Suburban School', The Courier-Mail, 28 Sep 1933, p. 14Coorparoo State School.

Other improvements to the school grounds at this time included seven new palms, planted at the bottom of the Parade Ground on Arbor Day in May 1933, and many new flower beds and several hibiscus hedges, laid out by the Head Teacher with donated plants. With the completion of Block B, the school committee's attention focused again on increasing the grounds of the growing school. In 1934, facing Old Cleveland Road adjoining the western boundary of the school were purchased from MW Thompson for , of which 1/3 () was paid by the school committee. Removal of the house followed. The property's fence and retaining wall on the Old Cleveland Road boundary and the mature shade trees were retained, while the land was partially graded for use as an infants' playground. In the following year, the committee also purchased a allotment adjacent to the new playground for for inclusion in the infants' playground. The playground was later named Hinrichsen Park after the head teacher.Property transferred on 29 August 1934 - see DNRM, CoT: 10850205, 10696145Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, pp. 32, 33ePlan Drawing No 15697759, Coorparoo SS additions of New Building, 1940Coorparoo State School, Coorparoo SS Centenary, Souvenir History 1876-1976, Coorparoo SS, Brisbane, 1976, p. 13. Other improvements to the school grounds between 1932 and 1935 funded by the school committee, included erection of a pergola, garden seats and a pedestal and sun-dial in Wolff Park. The school committee was also responsible for installing electric light in the school between 1932 and 1935.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p. 33 In 1938, a rockery and watering system were installed. A fence with a pergola and steps leading down to the infants' area were erected, and lawns and flower beds were established and 40 roses planted.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p. 42. In June 1940, the Minister for Public Instruction advised that funding was available to build the final stage of the school's rebuilding scheme. Drawings for the building, in keeping with the earlier proposed design, were completed by DPW architect, Gilbert Robert Beveridge, that month. Block A in front of Block B, 1946 The new brick building (now called Block A), located in front of Block B, formed the fifth and final section of the brick school. It comprised two floors with an undercroft play area, similar to other urban brick schools and Depression-era brick school buildings. Some buildings of the original school was demolished to enable its completion.'A Severed Link', The Brisbane Courier, 28 Jul 1933, p. 8. In January 1941 commencement of Block A's construction, at a cost of , was announced by the Minister for Public Instruction and Public Works (Harry Bruce).'Coorparoo School Improvement to Cost 17,252', The Telegraph, 30 Jan 1941, p. 5.'Coorparoo's New School', The Courier-Mail, 31 Jan 1941, p. 10.

The urban brick school building provided accommodation for 370 pupils in nine classrooms: four on the first floor and five on the second. The head teacher's room was on the ground floor with staff rooms and cloakrooms on each floor. The four classrooms on the ground floor were separated by folding partitions. The upper level classrooms were divided by solid masonry walls with central connecting double doors. Twin stairs led from the ground to the first floor central bay. Through a small portico and short hall (flanked by a teachers room and cloak room), a verandah corridor gave access to the southeast facing classrooms. Stairwells connecting the three levels were positioned at both ends of the building. The upper level replaced the portico, one teachers room, and the short hall of the lower level with a classroom. Block A was connected to the Block B centrally at ground and first floor levels by covered ways. Corridors, verandahs, balconies and cloak rooms had concrete floors; the remaining floors were of wood and the ceilings of fibro-cement. It replaced three timber classroom buildings located in front of Block B, two of which were to be moved to Wolff Park and used as domestic science and vocational classrooms.E J Wruck, \\"The School Committee Report\\" cited by Coorparoo State School.

A new block plan, dated 1940, showed removal of the existing concrete retaining wall and fencing in front of Block A (Old Cleveland Road frontage), replaced by a new wall, and a chain wire fence, and excavation of the grounds to new levels. The retaining wall from the Thompson property was retained. The existing concrete retaining wall and fencing along School Lane were removed, and a new concrete wall and chain wire fencing, extending to the existing gates, were erected. Trellis fencing was erected above the retaining walls to the east and west of Block A.ePlan Drawing No 15697770, Coorparoo SS Additions- New Building Block Plan, Sep 1940ePlan Drawing No 15697649, Coorparoo State School additions New Block Plan. Drawing by GR Beveridge, March 1941. Prior to the completion of Block A, war in the Pacific region commenced in December 1941, resulting in the Queensland Government closing all coastal state schools in January 1942 due to fear of a Japanese invasion. Although most schools reopened on 2 March 1942, student attendance was optional until the war ended. The closed schools were sometimes occupied for defence purposes, and some schools remained closed \\"for special reasons\\" after the rest had reopened.Ronald Wood, Civil Defence In Queensland During World War II, 1993, p.79'Schools reopensome await shelter survey', The Courier Mail, 2 March 1942, p. 3. Typically, schools were a focus for civilian duty during wartime. At many schools, students and staff members grew produce and flowers for donation to local hospitals and organised fundraising and the donation of useful items to Australian soldiers on active service.Burmester et al, Queensland Schools A Heritage Conservation Study, a report for the Department of Education, 1996, pp.60-62. Slit trenches, for protecting the students from Japanese air raids, were also dug at Queensland state schools, often by parents and staff. Coorparoo State School contributed to the war effort in a number of ways. The Chief Air Warden held Air Raid Precautions meetings once a month. Brisbane Commercial High School students, whose school in the city closed, came to Coorparoo for lessons in the buildings in Wolff Park. About 1941 Coorparoo State School was officially approved as a combined Decontamination and First Aid post. Initially the first aid post was set up in one of the old buildings, but after the completion of Block A, its basement was used as an Air Raid Post, set up with beds and medical supplies. An air raid siren was mounted on an electric light pole outside the school on Old Cleveland Road. Air raid practice was carried out at the school. Slit trenches were dug around the small playground facing Old Cleveland Road and sand bag trenches made along the Wolff Park fence. Ordinary needlework was replaced by knitting scarves and socks which were distributed to relatives of pupils on active service abroad. Five rugs were given to refugees. From February 1942, Australian soldiers recuperating at the Australian Army hospital at nearby Loreto Convent were given permission to use the school grounds and swimming pool.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, pp. 46, 49, 52. After World War II, the Department of Public Instruction was largely unprepared for the enormous demand for state education that began in the late 1940s and continued well into the 1960s. This was a nationwide occurrence resulting from immigration and the unprecedented population growth now termed the \\"baby boom\\". Queensland schools were overcrowded and, to cope, many new buildings were constructed and existing buildings were extended.Project Services, Queensland Schools Heritage Study Part II Report, for Education Queensland, January 2008, pp.28-31. This was the case at Coorparoo State School. After removal of the relocated timber school buildings, a high-set timber building of three classrooms (now called Block C) was completed in 1950.Project Services, \\"Coorparoo SS\\", p. 10. During the 1950s a number of additions were undertaken leading up to the school's peak enrolment of 1600 in 1958.'Coorparoo SS', Your Brisbane Past and Present, , 4 Nov 2011 accessed 22Feb17DPW.

Three additional classrooms were created by extending and upgrading existing buildings in 2001. Between 2001 and 2003, the 1928 swimming pool was demolished for construction of a new music building on its site. A new swimming pool was located to the east of the former playing field on land excised from the Alexandra Home property. In 2003, a three-storey teaching block was constructed on the playing field site.

Throughout the school's history, social events to fund-raise and celebrate milestones have taken place. In 1933 a commemorative re-union dance to celebrate the school was held in the first school building prior to its demolition. In 1936 diamond jubilee celebrations were held. The school's 100th anniversary was celebrated on 10 April 1976. Part of the commemorations was the release of a video of a day at Coorparoo in 1943.Alan Denby (1943) and Neil Sternquist (1976), \\"28124 Coorparoo State School Video 1943, ca1980\\", John Oxley Library, State Library of Queensland. Another re-union of past pupils in 1994 attracted over 600 former students from around Australia.Bolam, Coorparoo State School 125th Anniversary, p. 90. In 2017, the school continues to operate from its original site. It retains its urban brick school buildings and 10-post playshed, set in landscaped grounds with sundial, retaining walls, fences, stairs and balustrading, sporting facilities, playing areas, and mature shade trees. Coorparoo State School is important to the Coorparoo district as a key social focus for the community, as generations of students have been taught there and many social events held in the school's grounds and buildings since its establishment.  Description  Site map, 2017 Coorparoo State School occupies part of a large, site fronting northwest onto Old Cleveland Road, a main thoroughfare through the suburb of Coorparoo, four kilometres southeast of Brisbane CBD. Attractive views are had to and from the school and it is conspicuous in the area as it occupies the crest of a modest ridge, has long frontages to principal thoroughfares, stands directly beside the retail and civic centre of the area, and includes striking architecture, open playing fields, and impressive mature trees. Two remarkable urban brick school buildings stand symmetrically and axially aligned with and facing the school's front entrance on Old Cleveland Road - Block A (1942) in front of Block B (1928-33), connected by a two level enclosed walkway (1942). Despite being built nine to 14 years apart, Block A, Block B, and the walkway are a cohesive design with matching form, style, and material use. A playshed (1907) stands nearby and the grounds include retaining walls and terraced play grounds, and mature trees. = Block A (1942) = Block A from the north-east Block A is a symmetrical two-storey building set high on an enclosed undercroft level and has a tall hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. At the roof's central peak is a prominent metal ventilation fleche with round cupola. The building's facades are defined horizontally with three materials: smooth-rendered masonry with lined coursing at undercroft level; facebrick for the ground floor up to the sill level of the first floor; and painted pebble dash stucco above. The building character is softened through the use of attractive, simple, and low maintenance materials with minimal decorative features, including a restrained use of dark glazed bricks contrasting with the unglazed main body of the building and smooth-rendered concrete dressings, flat window hoods with scrolled brackets, and keystones. A triangular pediment at the parapet highlights the building's central entrance and features the school name. Undercroft of Block A The building uses are separated by its levels with an undercroft level of open play space below two levels of teaching rooms. The form of each level is also clearly defined by its use, comprising a central block of primarily teachers' rooms and former cloak rooms projecting in front of a long wing of classrooms that have a stairwell at either end. Connecting the two parts is a verandah providing circulation along the front (northwest side) of the long wing. The verandah has arched openings on the ground floor and square openings with a glazed brick balustrade on the first floor, however, both levels of verandah have been enclosed with later louvres and sheet material, which is not of cultural heritage significance. At either end of the verandah on the ground floor are secondary entrances reached via stairs from the front garden. These are highlighted by a porch with a semi-circular smooth rendered concrete hood. The front entrance and porches have an arched fanlight above timber French doors with panelling and bolection moulding. Mounted on the wall either side of the front door are marble tablets dedicated to two chairmen of the early school committee. Main entrance, Block A The building layout is highly intact in its original configuration; although new lightweight partitions have been inserted in a number of places. The formerly open undercroft has been partitioned to create a tuckshop, toilets, and a storeroom but retains open areas with original perimeter timber seats and rounded corners to the brick pillars. The ground floor configuration is highly intact. It retains its front staff rooms either side of a short foyer entrance, however, the cloak rooms have been enclosed by a partition to create store or staff rooms. The wall between verandah/corridor and the classrooms retains large double-hung windows, fanlights, and timber French doors, however, the folding partitions that formerly divided all classrooms on this level have been removed to form a long space (used as a library in 2017). This space includes some later glazed partitions and a raised platform that are not of cultural heritage significance. The first floor is a similar layout to the ground and is also highly intact, however, two masonry partitions have been removed to make four classrooms into two. The classrooms on both levels retain their ceilings lined with sheets and battens, with those of the first floor having lattice ventilation panels. The stairwells at either end are intact, retaining iron balustrades and turned, clear-finished timber handrails and bare concrete stairs. Old Cleveland Rd boundary walls and fences Old Cleveland Rd boundary walls and fences from W.jpgIn front of Block A is a modest garden, terraced via a cement rendered boundary retaining wall with pillars and metal palisade. A concrete path leads from the street through the garden on axis between flanking Poinciana trees (Delonix regia) in flat lawns before dividing to either side to reach a branching stair up to the front door. The broad concrete stairs have simple iron balustrades. Framing the northeast and southwest sides of Block A are concrete retaining walls and broad stairs up to the higher land behind. Projecting from the centre of the rear of Block A is a two-storey covered walkway to Block B. The walkway is a facebrick structure with a hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It has open arches on the ground floor and is enclosed on its first floor with timber-framed casement windows with fanlights, which are an early or possibly original feature. = Block B (1928-33) = Block B from the north-east Block B stands on higher land behind (to the southeast of) Block A and matches it in materials, style, detail, height, and floor levels by omitting an undercroft. The building has a tall hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets, topped by a metal ventilation fleche, matching Block A. Its form and layout is similar to Block A with a front block of classrooms and cloak rooms projecting in front of a long wing of classrooms with a stairwell toward either end. As in Block A, Block B has secondary entrances into the ground floor via concrete stairs with iron balustrades up to porches with round concrete hoods. The verandah on both levels is enclosed with later windows and sheet material, which is not of cultural heritage significance. In 2017 the building operates as administration and staff rooms for the school and four former classrooms have had lightweight partitions installed to create offices. Some doorways have been made in brick partition walls to connect rooms. The timber folding partitions of the ground floor end classrooms have been removed; otherwise the layout remains intact. First floor classroom with folding doors, Block B The first floor contains classrooms and has had minor alterations to create larger classrooms. It retains two of three sets of timber folding partitions between classrooms, however, these have been moved and installed nearby into later partitions - the original four classrooms have been converted into three. Openings have been made in brick partitions and one cloak room has been incorporated into a classroom by removing the brick partition completely and closing it off from the corridor. Despite these changes, the building is highly intact. It retains original fabric including timber French doors with fanlights and iron hardware, high-set casement windows in the wall between verandah and the classrooms, brass window hardware, timber batten and sheet ceilings with lattice ventilation panels on the first floor, and the stairwells retain bare concrete floors and steps with iron balustrade and turned timber handrails. = Blocks A and B = The interiors of Block A and B and the corridor link between them are simple and functional yet have a generous character with lofty ceilings and high level of natural light and large windows. Both blocks face north-northwest; correspondingly, the long wing of classrooms behind them face south-southeast, to which direction they have large areas of tall timber-framed casement windows with matching fanlights (although some windows on the southern side of Block B have been replaced with similar designs) allowing high levels of natural southern light into the classrooms. = Playshed (1907) = 1907 playshed Standing behind (south) of Block B is a timber framed playshed. It has ten timber posts and a timber framed hipped roof clad with corrugated metal sheets. It stands on a concrete slab and has timber perimeter seats, which are later replacements. The posts bear notches that indicate former perimeter enclosure. = Grounds = The grounds of the school are terraced to form large flat platforms. Behind (to the southeast of) Block B, these were originally parade grounds and playing areas but have had shelter sheds and other teaching buildings constructed on them, which are not of cultural heritage significance, although one open area remains. The terraces are formed via concrete retaining walls (-1942) that show they were formed and poured in situ. The ground generally falls away behind Block B and stairs are incorporated to reach lower terraces. A small section of Brisbane tuff retaining wall forms a small terrace near Cavendish Road. On the Old Cleveland Road boundary stands a retaining wall from the former Thompson Estate. It is a masonry wall rendered with roughcast stucco and has piers with moulded caps. Between the piers is a balustrade of two metal pipes and at the centre of the wall are steps up to the former gate, which has been blocked off. The school grounds contain mature trees, including: rows of camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora) and figs (likely weeping fig, Ficus benjamina). The trees stand to the southwestern side of the former Thompson Estate, at the boundary to and Cavendish Road and in a row away from the road, and lining the retaining wall of the playing field near Halstead Street. At some locations, these are in lines marking the former boundaries of the school grounds. Sundial from the north-west A sundial stands in the grounds in one of the large formerly-open playing terraces to the southwest of Block B (near the northeast corner of Block C). It has a sandstone base and the flat top holds a brass plate of the sundial although the gnomon has been removed. The side of the mount has a brass plaque reading \\"Wolff Park\\". Other buildings and structures are not of cultural heritage significance. Views of the Brisbane CBD and surrounding neighbourhood occur from Block A and B and the school grounds. With its open setting contrasting with the suburban residential and retail streetscapes, with its large grassed oval and framed by mature trees, Coorparoo State School is an attractive and prominent element in the built landscape.  Heritage listing  Coorparoo State School was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 22 June 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Coorparoo State School (established in 1876) is important in demonstrating the evolution of state education and its associated architecture in Queensland. It retains excellent, representative examples of government designs that were architectural responses to prevailing government educational philosophies, set in landscaped grounds with sporting facilities, landscaping features, and mature trees. Two urban brick school buildings (1928‚Äì33, 1942) represent the culmination of years of experimentation with natural light, classroom size and elevation by the Department of Public Works (DPW), and also demonstrate the growing preference in the early 20th century for constructing brick school buildings at metropolitan schools in developing suburbs. Additions undertaken during the 1930s are the result of the Queensland Government's building and relief work programmes, which stimulated the economy and provided work for men unemployed as a result of the Great Depression. The suburban site with playshed (1907), mature trees, sundial (1932‚Äì35), sporting facilities and other landscaping features demonstrates educational policies that promoted the importance of play and a beautiful environment in the education of children. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Coorparoo State School is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a Queensland state school with later modifications. These include: teaching buildings constructed to individual designs; and generous, landscaped sites, with mature trees, assembly and play areas, and sporting facilities. The urban brick school buildings are intact, excellent examples of individually designed buildings of their type. They demonstrate the principal characteristics through their highset form; linear layout, with classrooms and teachers rooms accessed by verandahs; undercrofts used as open play spaces and for additional rooms; loadbearing, masonry construction, with face brick piers to undercroft spaces; and roof fleches. They demonstrate use of the stylistic features of their era, which determined their roof form, joinery and decorative treatment. Typically, urban brick school buildings are configured to create central courtyards, and are located in suburban areas that were growing at the time of their construction. The Playshed is an intact, excellent example of a standard 10-post, hipped-roof playshed, designed to provide all weather play space for children. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The urban brick school buildings at Coorparoo State School have aesthetic significance due to their beautiful attributes: identifiable by their symmetrical layout; consistent form; scale; materials; elegant composition; finely crafted timber work; and decorative treatment. These buildings remain intact and demonstrate a continuation of site planning ideals initiated by the placing of the original urban brick school building in a prominent position at the top of the sloping site. The beauty of the school's setting is enhanced by mature trees and formal landscaping elements such as retaining walls, stairs, gardens and a sundial with pedestal. Sited on high ground on Old Cleveland Road, the school has views to the Brisbane CBD and its urban brick school buildings are also significant for their contribution to the Old Cleveland Road streetscape. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Schools have always played an important part in Queensland communities. They typically retain significant and enduring connections with former pupils, parents, and teachers; provide a venue for social interaction and volunteer work; and are a source of pride, symbolising local progress and aspirations. Coorparoo State School has a strong and ongoing association with the surrounding community. It developed through the fundraising efforts of the local community and generations of children have been taught there. The place is important for its contribution to the educational development of its suburban district and is a prominent community focal point and gathering place for social and commemorative events with widespread community support.

The project operates under the aegis of the Tropical Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University. It is directed by Banchob Sripa. Its aim is to eliminate the practice of consuming raw or undercooked fish, the major cause of liver fluke infection and bile duct cancer in the region. The project is unique in that it follows the principles of EcoHealth, a One Health approach to improving human and animal health. The project has been the subject of newspaper and TV reports by BBC, The New York Times, and The Guardian. The area and population The project area consists of several villages around the Kaeng Lawa (Thai: ‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏á‡∏•‡∏∞‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏≤), a lake and wetlands about 25 kilometers south of the city of Khon Kaen. The people's primary occupations are rice farming and fishing. The lake is a source of the cyprinid fish that the locals consume raw in dishes known as koi pla and pla som, which are often infested with the cysts or metacercariae of the liver fluke. Cats and dogs also ingest the fish, making them hosts for the fluke. Northeast Thailand still has the highest incidence of bile duct cancer in the world, and the prevalence of O. viverrini infection in some villages in Khon Kaen Province has reached 100 percent. Village health volunteers teaching children about liver fluke infection Lawa model The first attempts at opisthorchiasis control in Thailand began in the 1950s and included education on liver fluke infection and safe cooking, but these efforts had limited success since the consumption of raw fish dishes is an ingrained part of the rice-fish culture of the indigenous people. With the introduction of praziquantel in the 1980s, treatment became a part of the program. The prevalence of infection was reduced, but after funding reductions during the economic crises in the 1990s, prevalence rates rose again to as high as 85 percent in some areas of the northeast by 2009. In 2007, researchers at Khon Kaen University, led by Banchob Sripa, decided to take a more multidisciplinary approach, incorporating EcoHealth principles, which involve the collaboration of human and animal health specialists toward improving the health of people, animals and the environment as well as achieving greater understanding of how the ecosystem affects human and animal health. The \\"Lawa model\\" as it became known, involves community participation as a key element. Village health volunteers, staff of local sub-district hospitals, teachers, and others maintain a campaign of continuous education, teaching in the community and the schools about liver fluke disease and discouraging the consumption of raw or undercooked fish. The campaigns often involve \\"edutainment\\" activities (songwriting, dancing, and music) to attract public attention. Benefits After implementation of the Lawa model, the prevalence of infection declined from 67 percent to 16 percent over three years in Lawa village with little reinfection after treatment, a common reason for failure in the past. An intensive program in nine schools in the village reduced infection to undetectable levels. In 2012, the schools were certified as liver fluke free. Infection typically begins in childhood, leading to the lifelong chronic infection that often results in cancer. An analysis conducted by the university on the social return on investment estimates a return of 3.47 relative to resources invested, with the primary benefit going to villagers and especially the children of the students who should avoid a lifetime of chronic infection and its possible consequences. Such projects are hard to assess solely on the basis of an economic analysis.

Early life David Ritchie was born on 24 September 1920 in Falkirk, Scotland, one of four children of a grocer in the town. He had planned to become a Presbyterian minister, and earned a master's degree in Latin, Greek, and theology from the University of Glasgow, but then studied medicine at Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, and the University of Edinburgh, where he qualified in 1947. Career In 1951, Ritchie passed the FRCS (Edinburgh), won the Crichton Research Scholarship and subsequently attempted to construct an artificial heart. In 1953, he received an MRC scholarship in Liverpool where he ultimately did perform a pig heart transplant. The pig survived for 30 days. In 1955, after lecturing in Dundee, he travelled to the Mayo clinic where he worked on surgical jaundice, for which he later won a gold medal. In 1958 he joined the Royal London Hospital as a senior lecturer. Along with John Blandy, who he persuaded to take up transplant surgery, Ritchie used Kolff's twin coil for dialysis, a procedure he was appointed to set up three years earlier. He was made reader in surgery in 1960 and on the retirement of Victor Dix in 1964 was appointed professor. Ritchie pioneered the use of hyperbaric oxygen, which he used to save the frostbitten fingers of the climbers Chris Bonington and Dougal Haston, despite them managing to climb out of the tank and repair to a nearby pub. In 1968, Ritchie supervised Richard Earlam who had moved to the London Hospital as a lecturer. He was co-editor of Bailey and Love's Short Practice of Surgery for the editions of 1975 and 1981. Personal life In 1953, he married Jennifer Prentice, and they had three sons, Gordon, Andrew and Bruce. That marriage ended in divorce in 1983, and in 1990, he married Elizabeth \\"Peggy\\" Thompson. He died in Tenterden, Kent, on 21 December 1993.

Founded in 2016 by Michael T. Suffredini and Kam Ghaffarian, the company is planning commercial missions in late 2021 to the International Space Station (ISS) and aims to own and operate the world's first commercial space station. The company's leadership team is largely composed of former NASA employees, including former NASA Administrator Charles Bolden. Other notable leaders at the company include astronauts Michael Lopez- Alegria and Brent W. Jett Jr. As NASA shifts human spaceflight aspirations beyond low Earth orbit, Axiom's goal is to create the commercial infrastructure necessary to push humanity forward in space. The company outlines broad commercial activities including human spaceflight for national and private astronauts, in-space research and manufacturing, and space exploration support.  History  Michael Suffredini in 2012 Axiom Space CEO Michael T. Suffredini was previously the program manager for the International Space Station from 2005 to 2015. After retiring from NASA, Suffredini and Kam Ghaffarian started Axiom to target the emerging commercial spaceflight market. Ghaffarian is an engineer and entrepreneur who sold his company, Stinger Ghaffarian Technologies, Inc., a large NASA contractor, to KBR in 2018. The company was selected by NASA to provide the first commercial destination module on the International Space Station. Axiom also announced a contract with SpaceX to fly commercial astronauts to the International Space Station via Falcon 9 and Crew Dragon scheduled for late 2021. This spacecraft was launched on May 2020 as part of the Commercial Crew Program with Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken as astronauts. The company has 60 employees as of 2020, with offices located in Houston and Los Angeles.  NASA partnership  In 2020, NASA awarded Axiom a $140 million contract to provide at least one habitable spacecraft to attach to the International Space Station. Axiom was the only selected proposal from the solicitation process due in 2019. Bigelow Aerospace did not submit a proposal and has subsequently ceased operations. In the announcement, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stated that Axiom's commercial destination will be a critical destination for NASA's \\"astronaut training, scientific research, and technology demonstrations in low-Earth orbit.\\" NASA's goal to further commercialize low Earth orbit and this Appendix I solicitation won by Axiom is a part of the broader Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships (NextSTEP) initiative to spur public-private partnership innovation in cislunar space. The announcement won praise from Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, the two senators representing Axiom's home state of Texas. The module constructed by Axiom will attach to the Harmony forward port and demonstrate its ability to commercially provide services and products in the low Earth orbit economy. Axiom has given limited technical details, however, it is known that the \\"Axiom Segment\\" of the station will include a node module, research and manufacturing facility, crew habitat and ‚Äúlarge- windowed‚Äù module for viewing the Earth.  Axiom Station  Axiom modules connected to ISSAxiom Station will have its spacecraft modules individually launched and assembled in-orbit, first attaching to the International Space Station. Before ISS retirement (and atmospheric reentry), the company plans to detach its modules and commence orbit on its own as Axiom Station. Axiom renderings show in detail how modules will attach to the ISS and are relocated by the Mobile Servicing System, specifically the Canadarm2. The company targets the mid-2020s for its first module to attach to the ISS and the late-2020s for station completion. Axiom plans for its station to be the first private space station in-orbit. Upon ISS retirement, Axiom Station will be separated from the ISS and joined by additional elements, including a power and thermal module with an airlock. Axiom plans to conduct astronaut training for commercial astronauts, to host governments and commercial partners, as well as private astronauts. Up to three Axiom modules will attach to the International Space Station. The first module could be launched as soon as 2024 and will docked to the forward port of Harmony, requiring relocation of the of PMA-2. Axiom Space plans to attach up to two additional modules to its first core module, and send private astronauts to inhabit the modules. Axiom Earth Observatory interiorThe interior of Axiom Station is designed by French architect and designer, Philippe Starck. Renderings of the habitat show a chamber with walls that are covered with tufted padding and studded with hundreds of color-changing LEDs. Axiom will maintain at least one astronaut in the station continuously, who will be able to take care of research projects and station repairs. The station will have amenities including high-speed Wi- Fi, video screens, picture windows and a glass-walled cupola ‚Äî which Axiom calls \\"the largest window observatory ever constructed for the space environment.\\"  Business plan = Human spaceflight = Axiom plans to provide human spaceflight services to individuals, corporations, and space agencies. Missions to the International Space Station are offered by Axiom, with a 10-day mission including 15 weeks of training. In addition to training, Axiom states that the package will include mission planning, hardware development, life support, medical support, crew provisions, hardware and safety certifications, on-orbit operations, and mission management. Axiom's customers will orbit the Earth with national astronauts from ISS member nations, joining the short list of humans to view Earth from space and experience the Overview effect. Missions will extend for longer periods of time depending on the focus of the spaceflight. NASA has indicated it and other space agencies will purchase missions to the ISS as NASA's human spaceflight focus shifts to the Moon, Mars, and deeper into the Solar System. To capture the human spaceflight market, Axiom is positioning itself to be a full mission provider at the national level, which would transition from the ISS currently to Axiom's commercial station upon ISS retirement. SpaceX is a confirmed transportation partner for Axiom, and the Boeing Starliner could also launch private and professional astronauts for Axiom. Suffredini, the company's CEO, touts his team's experience in human spaceflight as a key determinant for being qualified to offer missions with senior leaders being involved in every mission to ISS since its inception. In June 2020, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine mentioned on a podcast that Axiom is involved with the filming of a Tom Cruise movie to the ISS. It has been previously reported that SpaceX will be the transportation partner for the mission. = In-space research and manufacturing = Crystals grown in microgravityHistorically, most in-space research has been on the ISS National Lab, which has a mission to perform scientific inquiry into life sciences, physical sciences, technology development, and remote sensing for a broad range of organizations in orbit. Axiom plans to use some of the valuable discoveries from ISS National Lab and build on its heritage with a commercial slant. To date, hundreds of companies have sent various projects to ISS for research. In low Earth orbit, weaker gravitational forces allow for novelties impossible to replicate on Earth. Jim Bridenstine and other leaders have referenced breakthroughs in manufacturing of materials such as fiber optics for data communications and protein crystallization in biotech. Scientific observations of research domains like combustion, convection, sedimentation, fluid dynamics, and materials science show how conventional terrestrial research gets turned on its head in microgravity. Emerging research into nanotechnology, additive manufacturing, and in situ resource utilization will require and use in-orbit laboratories to conduct experimentation. ISS National Lab has proven that removing the input of gravity from conventional manufacturing processes has demonstrated promise and will be a key component of Axiom's commercial space station. Axiom plans to first launch missions to ISS National Lab, prior to Axiom's modules being assembled in the mid-2020s. Axiom plans to commercially broaden the in-space research and manufacturing ecosystem and has hired leaders from ISS National Lab and other organizations. Other companies collectively pursuing the future of in-space manufacturing include NanoRacks, Made in Space, and Space Tango.

As part of the Double-Cross System Dicketts role was to convince the Germans he was a traitorpp. 103, 107-108 who was willing to sell out his country in return for cash, whilst continuing to report to MI5. Dicketts was an ex RNAS officer pp.7 & 11 who had worked in Air Intelligence for the Air Ministry during the latter part of World War I and had subsequently served several prison sentences for fraud. Unable to regain a commission in the RAF or work for British Intelligence due to his criminal past, Dicketts volunteered to work for the British Double Cross team led by Lt.Col T.A. Robertson (Thomas Argyle Robertson, known as Tar by his initials). Given the codename Celery, Dicketts accompanied Britain‚Äôs first double agent Arthur Owens (Snow) to neutral Lisbon where he was introduced to Major Nikolaus Ritter of the Abwehr. pp.108-116 Ritter arranged for Dicketts to be brought to Hamburg to be interrogated by members of the Abwehr. pp. 247, 250, 251-254 Dicketts was drugged, plied with alcohol, tricked and strenuously interrogated for five days and was accepted as a German agent whose role was to ferry German spies and equipment into England by boat from the occupied Channel Islands. pp. 135-136, & 144 Dicketts remained in Hamburg and later in Berlin for four weeks, where every second he spent in enemy territory, his life was at risk. When Dicketts returned to England with Owens their stories did not match pp.170-180 and MI5 spent many hours interrogating their two agents, trying to establish who was telling the truth. In the end Dicketts' account was believed over Owens', pp.181-183 who was imprisoned until 1944 for betraying Dicketts to the Germans before he even went into Germany, and for informing Ritter that the radio transmitter he had given him before the war, was now under MI5 control. MI5 were never certain of Owens‚Äô loyalty, or if he betrayed Dicketts due to jealousy or whether he was a genuine traitor. If the latter was the case, then Owens may have continued to betray other British agents or disclosed secret details about deceptions of vital importance to Britain. Shortly after Owens‚Äô imprisonment, MI5 sent Dicketts back to Lisbon to help an Abwehr officer to defect, pp. 184 -186 and several months later he was sent to South America shortly before the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor. pp. 201-204 Dicketts' mistress Kay was given false papers in the name of Mrs Dicketts despite her 'husband' being legally married at the time. In his business life, Walter Dicketts used up to twenty-three different aliases and served several prison sentences for fraud (forging cheques and obtaining money by false pretences) in the UK, as well as one in Austria and one in France. Dicketts married four times and maintained two mistresses during two of those marriages. pg. xiv Police and media described Dicketts variously as elusive, well-educated, well spoken, with charming manners and a charming smile. pp. 45, 50 Early life Walter Dicketts was born in Southend-on-Sea, the son of Arthur, a stockbroker‚Äôs clerk, and his wife Francis. pp. 6, 7 & 20 Dicketts attended the local grammar school and in 1915 he ran away from school and enlisted with the RNAS at the age of fifteen. He served in armoured cars, and tanks before becoming a pilot in 1917. After a crash in which he was badly injured he became an intelligence officer with the Air Ministry with the rank of Captain. In 1919 he married Phyllis Hobson, the daughter of a wealthy silver cutlery manufacturer, with whom he had a son called Graeme in 1919. pp. 11, 12, 13 -16 During the early part of their marriage Dicketts met Dora Viva Guerrier, a dancer with the famous Tiller Girls, and began a relationship, resulting in the birth of Dicketts‚Äô only daughter, Effie. The following year he had a second son by Phyllis and several months later a son to Dora, who was given away at birth. Unable to meet his expenses Dicketts turned to crime, purchasing goods with false cheques and then selling the items. He was sentenced to hard labour and as a result lost both his wife and his mistress. At the age of thirty, Dicketts eloped with a sixteen-year-old girl called Alma Wood and married her, prompting a nationwide search to catch him before the marriage could take place. pp. 48 - 51 He married two more times to Vera Fudge and Judit Kelman and maintained a second mistress called Kathleen Holdcroft during his marriage to Vera. Kay ‚ÄòDicketts‚Äô played an integral role as part of his cover during his mission to South America in 1941. pp. 55 & 203 Dicketts was the father of six children. Later life After leaving MI5 in 1943 Dicketts imported oranges into England from South America and became involved in a variety of different businesses, including property development. When his businesses began to fail, Dicketts and his wife Judit fled to East Grinstead, where he established himself as a wealthy philanthropist called Charles Stewart Pollock. pp. 207-211 He became very successful, owned a manor house, and drove around in a white Rolls Royce. The money he obtained from investors was used to repay other investors and in classic Ponzi style, his businesses began to collapse and Dicketts was unable to repay his debts and soon gave himself up to police. Dicketts was sentenced to four years prison of which he served two years for good behaviour and then left England to run a rubber plantation in Malaya. In October 1957, John Bull Magazine published an article called ‚ÄòHitler‚Äôs Wartime Spies in Britain‚Äô which named Arthur Owens but not Walter Dicketts. Dicketts was described by his German codename Brown, and was pictured being drugged by the Abwehr who removed his opening signet ring to see if any hidden secret code was written behind the photograph of his girlfriend Kay. Dicketts died in August 1957 of coal-gas poisoning, pp. 213 - 214 having apparently killed himself, and Owens died in December of the same year of cardiac asthma, a condition secondary to heart failure that is marked by breathing difficulty. In 1972 John Cecil Masterman published The Double Cross System in the War of 1939 to 1945, an intimate account of wartime British military deception, in which Celery is mentioned, but not identified as Walter Dicketts. His family did not discover his role with British intelligence in both World Wars until his security services file was released by the British National Archives in 2006. It was at this time that his family discovered the existence of his other wives, mistresses and children.

The Nauo (Nawu) were an Aboriginal Australian people of South Australia who spoke the Nauo language. They became extinct by the end of the nineteenth century. Country The Nauo were a people of the Eyre peninsula. Their principal centres were around the scrub gum forest areas of the southwestern coast. According to Norman Tindale's estimate, their combined territory covered approximately . Their western frontiers lay around Cape Radstock, northwards to beyond Minnipa. Their eastern extension ran close to Darke Peak, and took in the areas west of Cleve and halfway between Carrow and Franklin Harbor. Port Lincoln, Mount Hope, Coffin Bay, and Elliston were all part of Nauo territory. Mythology According to Nauo beliefs, the spirits of the departed are thought to dwell on the islands in Spencer Gulf. George French Angas wrote in 1847 the following legend: > They affirm that the Nauo tribe was once entirely cut off by a great and > powerful warrior, styled Willoo (eaglehawk). This formidable individual > attempted to possess himself of all the women, and destroyed every man > except two, who escaped by climbing into thick trees. Their names were, > Karkantya and Poona (two smaller species of hawk). Willoo climbed after > them, but they broke off the branch upon which he sat, and he fell to the > ground; that instant a dog deprived him of his virility, when he immediately > died, and was transformed into an eagle-hawk. A small lizard is supposed to > be the originator of the sexes. The men distinguish it by the name of > ibirri, the women call it waka: the men destroy the male lizards, and the > women the females. History of contact It is thought that, before the advent of white colonisation, the Nauo had a more northern boundary extension from the Gawler Ranges to Port Augusta. They were pressed to move further south by the time white settlement began, as the Barngarla's relocation brought pressure to bear on them from the north. At the same time, devastation came in from the south with the establishment of sealing stations along their southern coastal frontiers, whose men, together with escapees from Tasmanian prisons, kidnapped many Nauo women, beginning with raids in the first decades of the 1800s from their bases on Kangaroo Island. The violence of these early encounters may explain the hostility of the Nauo to later settlers. The Waterloo Bay Massacre, near Elliston, which is said to have taken place around 1846, is still a contentious historical issue. Tindale summarised the rumour as follows: > Following the killing of a shepherd named Hamp, and the wife of another > immediately afterward, it is claimed that 160 well-armed men drove a large > group of aborigines, said to have numbered 260, over a cliff into the sea. > According to this entirely unconfirmed report, only two aborigines survived. Whatever the truth, some Nauo were still in that area years afterwards. As late as 2017, agreement between the successor Wirangu community and the Elliston municipal council on the terms to be used to describe what happened were still stalled, with representatives of the latter stating that \\"massacre\\" was too strong a word to describe what has been traditionally called the \\"Elliston incident\\", where \\"something happened\\" but the details are unknown.

He was also an industrial chemist and innovator in the field of textile technology. Born in Hungary, he settled in England and spent some years in Australia and New Zealand. Early life From a Jewish background, Singer was born and educated in Budapest. He became a British subject around 1884. (letter to the paper from a Henry Taylor of Royston Park). Singer's Simplified Grammar of the Hungarian language was published in London in 1882 in Tr√ºbner's Collection of Simplified Grammars. The collection, devoted to the principal Asiatic and European languages, was edited by the English orientalist Edward Henry Palmer (1840-1882). Australia 1885‚Äì1891 Reported as \\"just arrived from London\\" at Adelaide in February 1885, his first lecture in the colony was entitled \\"An Atheist's Apology and Defence\\". In a court case where he was called as a witness, he refused to take the oath on the grounds of his atheism. Singer had to \\"perform menial offices\\" to earn a living in South Australia. Not long after his arrival he was giving speeches and taking part in demonstrations for the labour movement. He was described as \\"really a clever man, notwithstanding that he looks so insignificant. He is a little, old-style chap, with a stoop, but having a splendid head and a keen bright eye... with his determined face and his grotesque headgear... Germanish from habit to dress, though he has more of the French politeness than the Teutonic gruffness.\\" His speeches were found impressive, \\"but the drawback to his general acceptance as a speaker is the unintelligibility which a thick foreign accent imparts to him\\". =Campaigning= Working with L. H. Berens, Singer played a leading part in establishing and editing a radical weekly journal, Our Commonwealth,\\"Our Commonwealth\\", The Areas Express, 28 May 1886. Accessed February 2018, via National Library of Australia. a predecessor of The Herald of Adelaide. He became editor of this paper, which campaigned for social reform and rejected organised Christianity. Singer and Berens were instrumental also in founding the Adelaide Democratic Club in 1887. Around 1886, together with Berens and others, Singer began a campaign in Adelaide for the taxation of land values as advocated by Henry George, who visited Adelaide in 1890. Singer became a leading figure among the Single Taxers of South Australia. =Wool cleaning device= While in Australia Singer developed a solvent scouring device using carbon bisulphide in the cleaning of sheep's wool.\\"The Cleaning of Wool: A Wonderful Invention\\", The South Australian Advertiser, 31 Mar 1888. Accessed February 2018, via National Library of Australia. Later when back in England he set up this \\"very elaborate machine\\" at Messrs. Isaac Holden's works in Thornton Road, Bradford, and demonstrated it before the Society of Dyers and Colorists at Bradford Technical College. Return to England About 1891 Singer returned to England and settled in Yorkshire, as did Berens. Singer was \\"engaged in chemical works at Calverley, near Leeds\\" in the years up to 1898. In 1893 he was working as a chemist in \\"an English cotton manufactory\\". =The Story of My Dictatorship (1893)= Singer and Berens jointly wrote The Story of My Dictatorship (1893), advocating tax reform. This was described as a \\"utopian novel clearly indicating Georgist influence\\", and sold over 100,000 copies. =Some Unrecognized Laws of Nature (1897)= Singer and Berens also collaborated on Some Unrecognized Laws of Nature (1897), published in England by Messrs. John Murray. The Dial said of this work that it \\"offers to the physicist greatly varied interest. Seldom does one find propositions more clearly enunciated or more concisely and logically discussed. Their exhaustive analysis holds attention and forces conclusions as to many of the terms and conventions of modern science, some of which have claimed the highest prerogative...\\" The New Age was reported to have \\"devoted seven columns of not altogether unfavourable criticism\\" to the book, claiming \\"That it propounds a new theory of heat, light, magnetism and electricity\\". The work also received an extensive review in Popular Science for October 1897, which regarded it as \\"a brave attempt to solve\\" the \\"riddle of the universe\\". According to this account, the book proposed the four fundamental physical principles of \\"persistence, resistance, reciprocity, and equalization\\". It addressed the \\"forbidden problem\\" of gravitation, asserting that the gravitational force between two bodies depended not only on their mass and the distance between them (as in the Newtonian description) but also in differences in the \\"state of excitation\\" of the bodies. A less favourable review in Knowledge (1 April 1898) condemned the book as \\"bristling with mistaken ideas\\".Review in Knowledge, 1 April 1898, p. 88.

An Ignatius Singer living in Stokes Valley patented a design of milk churn in 1900. The two men returned to Europe in 1902. Later life and death Singer worked as analytical chemist to the Bradford Dyers' Association. His paper on \\"The causes of the progress and retardation of the artificial color industry in England\\" was published in the Journal of the Society of Dyers and Colorists for May 1910. Singer was said to be still \\"working as a chemist in Bradford\\" in 1917. His death was reported in the Yorkshire Observer of 8 June 1926. He had had one son and one daughter. =The Rival Philosophies... (1919)= Singer's 1917 booklet The Theocracy of JesusSydney Morning Herald, 18 Oct 1918, Accessed February 2018, via National Library of Australia. was reviewed with apparent approval in The Humanist, which gave the work's message as follows: \\"As a theology Christianity stands self-condemned. As an ethical inspiration it has never been given a fair chance of success. Jesus was not a theologian, but a plain moral teacher,...\\" In 1919 Singer expanded on this theme in his final major work, The Rival Philosophies of Jesus and of Paul. Here, he argued that the original message of Jesus had been distorted by Saint Paul and the Gospel writers. The book was received unfavourably by Jewish and Christian commentators. They pointed out that \\"Mr. Singer is not a professed theologian\\" and claimed that he was \\"totally ignorant of the subjects which he undertakes to treat\\", appearing to draw neither on \\"Judaism and Jewish literature\\" nor on \\"the literature of modern evangelical thinkers\\". One reviewer found the book \\"keen and suggestive, but dogmatic in spirit and crude in scholarship\\", while for another it was \\"hard to take some authors seriously. Mr. Singer is one of them. He puts before us, as new discoveries, theories that are hoary with old age...\\" The New Statesman took a different view, saying \\"We must be grateful to the author for his, at times, brilliant insistence on the truth that only by accepting the principles of Jesus can humanity work out its early destiny and establish a just and stable civilisation\\".

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. The building now houses a restaurant, the Riverside Grill. History Vassar was founded in 1849 by Townsend North and James Edmunds. It grew steadily, primarily due to the logging business, and was incorporated as a village in 1871. However, the depletion of the timberlands in the area and the 1881 Thumb Fire signaled the end of lumbering in Vassar. The area shifted to agricultural production, particularly of sugar beets. By 1900, sugar beet production was an important component of the local economy. During this era or transition, prominent Vassar businessman J.P. Blackmore constructed this hotel. Blackmore was born in London, Ontario, and came to Michigan in 1871 to work on the construction of heavy timber bridges for new railroad lines being built at the time. By 1874, J.P and his brother Simon had moved to Vassar and set out on various business ventures, including opening a saloon and billiards hall in 1875 and later purchasing the Central House, one of Vassar's earliest inns. In 1883, Blackmore purchased the Jewell House in Vassar, then expanded the hotel and sold it in 1888 to concentrate on farming. However, in 1892, Blackmore built this hotel, the Hotel Columbia in Vassar. Blackmore owned and operated the Hotel Columbia until 1902, when he sold the business to his brother Simon. Simon Blackmore sold the business to John H. Schultz in 1909. The hotel and its restaurant passed through a number of owners between 1913 and 1932, and became the \\"Vassar Hotel\\" in 1929. It operated as a hotel until 1986, when a severe flood damaged the building and forced it to close. Demolition of the building was planned, but the formation of the Cork Pine Preservation Association (now the Vassar Historical Society) prevented demolition. The group renovated the hotel, and a restaurant, \\"Betty Lou's,\\" opened inside in 1996. Betty Lou's closed in the 2010s. The building was vacant for several years until 2016, when a new restaurant, the Riverside Grill, opened. Description The Hotel Columbia is a two-story L-shaped brownish-red brick commercial building with a flat roof and concrete foundation. A single story mass is at the rear of the building, in the angle of the L; two small additions are appended onto this mass. The building is located on a corner lot, with two main facades, but giving primacy to the longer facade along Huron. Both facades have flat arch one-over-one windows with continuous rock-face sandstone sills. On the corner is a small round \\"turret\\" on the second floor, supported by two plain stone columns. Atop the turret is a sandstone block bearing the inscription \\"J. P. Blackmore.\\" Below the turret is an entrance which originally led to the lobby. The entrance door is surrounded by sidelights and a transom. Both facades are partitioned by pilasters into bays.

and the early postwar period. Formed in late 1943 in the Moscow Military District, the division conducted training for almost a year. It was sent to the front in September 1944 and fought in the Baltic region until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945. The 73rd was then transferred east and fought in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria in August. Postwar, it remained in the Far East and was disbanded by the end of the 1950s.  World War II  The division began forming around 20 November 1943, when Colonel Vladimir Mityushin was appointed commander. It was part of the Moscow Military District, and included the 205th, 402nd, 430th, and 442nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiments. From 2 February 1944, Lieutenant Colonel (promoted to Colonel on 30 March) Vladimir German served as division commander.37 mm AA gun of the type used by the division during World War II On 2 May, Colonel Vasily Ivashenko took command of the division while it was reorganizing at the Moscow Anti-Aircraft Artillery Training Camp; he would lead it for the rest of the war. In September the division was sent to the front as part of the 3rd Baltic Front's 1st Shock Army, fighting in the Riga Offensive. On 16 October the army transferred to the 2nd Baltic Front. The division then fought in the blockade of the surrounded German Army Group Courland in the Courland Pocket. Between September 1944 and February 1945, with the 1st Shock Army, the division was credited with downing nine German aircraft. In support of ground troops, it was credited with destroying four tanks, suppressing the fire of four mortar batteries, destroying ten pillboxes, and three observation points, as well as killing 340 German soldiers. In February 1945 the 73rd was transferred to the 4th Shock Army, with which it served until the end of the war. From 1 April the army was part of the Courland Group of Forces of the Leningrad Front. After the end of the war in Europe, the division was transferred to the Far East to fight in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria. On 7 July it joined the Far Eastern Front's 15th Army. In the Soviet invasion of Manchuria, as part of the 2nd Far Eastern Front, the division supported the army in the Sungari Offensive. The 73rd covered the main group of the army in the crossing of the Amur River and the advance to Harbin.  Postwar  Postwar, Ivashenko continued to command the division in the Far Eastern Military District, but died on 11 July 1946 in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.
