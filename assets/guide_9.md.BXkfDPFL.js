He was regarded by Plutarch as a warlike and wealthy man. After the defeat of Hicetas at Adranum by Timoleon, Mamercus joined Timoleon and concluded a treaty of alliance with him. When Timoleon had not only made himself master of Syracuse, but defeated the Carthaginians in the great Battle of the Crimissus (339 BC), Mamercus became apprehensive that his ally's object was nothing less than the complete expulsion of all the tyrants from Sicily. In consequence, Mamercus entered into a league with Hicetas and the Carthaginians to oppose Timoleon's progress. At first they achieved a partial success, cutting to pieces a body of mercenaries in the Syracusan service. But Hicetas was defeated by Timoleon and fell into his hands, after which Timoleon marched against Catane. Mamercus met him in the field, but was defeated with heavy loss. So the Carthaginians concluded a peace with Timoleon. Abandoned by his allies, Mamercus saw little chance of success and fled to Messana, where he took refuge with Hippon, tyrant of that city. Timoleon, however, quickly followed him and laid siege to Messana, both by sea and land, forcing Hippon to flee. Mamercus then surrendered to Timoleon, stipulating only for a regular trial before the Syracusans. But as soon as he was brought into the assembly of the people there, he was condemned by acclamation, and executed like a common criminal.Plutarch Timoleon 13, 30, 31, 34; Diodorus Siculus XVI 69, 82; Cornelius Nepos Timoleon 2. Cornelius Nepos hints that Mamercus was not a Sicilian by birth, but had first come to the island as a leader of Italian mercenaries. Plutarch states that Mamercus prided himself much upon his skill in poetry, apparently with little reason, based on the two verses by Mamercus that have been preserved.

It was released in hardcover by Putnam on January 3, 2000 and reached number 12 on The New York Times Best Seller list. Background Jayne Ann Krentz is a prolific author, releasing books under three pseudonyms. As Amanda Quick, she writes historical romance; as Jayne Castle she writes paranormal romance, and under her own name she releases contemporary romance novels. Krentz sold her first novel in 1979, and since then writes between two and four novels a year. Soft Focus was published in hardcover on January 3, 2000 by Putnam and released in paperback later that year. It was also a Doubleday Book Club selection. Plot summary The heroine, Elizabeth Cabot, is the head of a venture capital firm. She begins a relationship with Jack Fairfax, who specializes in turning around failing businesses. After a single night together, she learns information that turns her against him, and she ends the relationship. Six months later, they are forced to work together when a new product is stolen from a company in which she has invested, that Jack is attempting to bring back to profitability. Together, they trail the thief to a film noir festival in Colorado. As they work to solve the mystery, they fall in love. Themes Critic Erin Young believes this novel, along with Krentz's other novels Flash and Sharp Edges, are carving out a new subgenre of the romance novel, the corporate romance. In these works, the hero and heroine are professional equals. In Soft Focus, the protagonists each own their own successful companies. Unlike in many earlier contemporary romance novels, the central conflict is a battle for control of work-related endeavors. They form a partnership not because they like each other, but because they cannot achieve their professional goals alone. As in Flash, Krentz uses the theme of family ties helping to ease business life. Unlike in Flash, heroine Elizabeth is not working directly with her family members, yet her secretary Louise is described as such a close friend that she is family-like. Louise uses her personal connections to help Elizabeth and Jack enter a closed location, so that they could pursue their business goals. This reiterates Krentz's frequent plot point that family, or those considered so, can be an asset at work. The novel is partially set at a film noir festival. Krentz brings this theme through the novel. The book references many classic noir films, and the plotting essentially puts the characters in a real film noir situation. Reception Romantic Times named Soft Focus one of its Top Picks, giving it a 4.5 out 5 of star rating. Reviewer Jill Smith praised the \\"immensely entertaining\\" novel for its unique settings. A review in Kirkus criticized the underlying mystery plotline but praised the \\"flirtatious banter and steamy sex\\" as well as the characterization of the hero and heroine. The novel reached number 12 on the New York Times Bestseller list for hardback fiction and number 15 on the New York Times Bestseller list for paperbacks in November 2000.

Early life Sartori was born December 25, 1858 in Cedar Falls, Iowa. His father, Joseph Sartori, migrated from Germany in the early 1850s. Though his family had lived in Germany for many generations, their origins were Italian. After five years as a bricklayer and plasterer in the United States, Joseph sent for his sweetheart, Theresa Wangler, the daughter of the burgomeister of Baden-Baden, Germany, and they were married in New Jersey. Sartori showed his enterprising nature early in life. At the age of eleven or twelve, young Joseph began working on the railroad as \\"train butcher\\", selling newspapers, candy and other notions. When other men were happy to earn $30 per month, Sartori was earning $100. Education In 1874, at the age of 15 he entered Cornell College in Mt. Vernon, Iowa. He was very impressed by the Navy and wanted to join. But his parents did not want him to enlist and, after some negotiations, they told him he could go to any school in the world. And so, at the age of seventeen, he interrupted his schooling at Cornell and went to Germany where he entered the University of Freiburg. Here, among other pursuits, he developed a deep love of music. He also joined the dueling club, but at this, his parents, alarmed, insisted he return home, where he re-entered Cornell. Sartori was athletic, and especially loved baseball. This love, along with his ability and aggressiveness, made him a natural leader. When at first he was not allowed to join the baseball team, he created a competing team that challenged and beat the existing college team. He was known as an outstanding shortstop. He excelled at Cornell, earning high grades, running the baseball team, competing in swimming championships, starting a new college newspaper and organizing dances, musical programs and social outings. Because of his short stature, he \\"resolved to become so big that men would have to look up to me.\\" He was young and ambitious and liked to do things where he could use his brains. He believed in hard work, industry and patience, and was a firm believer in progress. He graduated in 1879 and came home for the summer. He decided to become a lawyer, so in the fall he enrolled at the University of Michigan Law School. There he learned shorthand so he could take down the lectures in full. Still, even with a full academic load, he managed to play on the ball team and attend dances. Early career After graduation in 1881 he went to work for the legal firm of Conner and Shaw in Denison, Iowa, mainly working with land titles. Leslie M. Shaw would later become Secretary of the Treasury during the administration of Theodore Roosevelt, and he asked Sartori to become Assistant Secretary of the Treasury, a post that young Sartori declined. Sartori then moved to Le Mars, Iowa and partnered with lawyer Isaac S. Struble. At some point he realized he would not make a great trial lawyer. Through his work, he began to study buying and selling land in Northern Iowa and Southwestern Minnesota. Struble, meanwhile, was elected to Congress, and Sartori then worked for lawyer Peter S. Rishel, a new arrival in Le Mars. Rishel was more artist than businessman, and Sartori offered to manage the business end of the practice, which prospered. Sartori and Rishel joined Struble, forming Struble, Rishel and Sartori. It was at this time that Joseph met Margaret Rishel, his partner's daughter. They married on July 3, 1885, and went on an eighteen-month honeymoon. Though they visited Los Angeles in 1886, they thought that Kansas City, Missouri offered the best opportunities for their future. Sartori took an option on offices over Kansas City's First National Bank, and since the offices weren't to be available for a while, they returned to Le Mars. Then Sartori got a telegram about the land boom in Southern California. Move to Los Angeles On March 4, 1887 Sartori arrived in Los Angeles and traveled to Monrovia, California in the San Gabriel Valley, where the climate and country had impressed him on his last visit. But this time there was a new atmosphere of excitement and activity, and he thought he would check out the situation. He visited the Daugherty Ranch, 56 acres just east of Azusa, California, and took on option on the ranch for $150 on a Friday. On the following Monday Sartori took the train back to Los Angeles. A man named James Ganlon approached him, asking if he was the fellow who owned the option on the Daugherty Ranch, and purchased it for $8,500. Sartori was convinced he'd come to the right place. He partnered with John F. Brossart and John Wilde, two old friends from Le Mars, Iowa, and laid out subdivisions in the Monrovia area, buying and selling lots. In one, the Pacific View Tract, he built his first home. In Le Mars, Sartori had been a director and member of the loan committee of the Plymouth County Savings Bank and Trust Company. Since banking seemed more to his liking than real estate, he called on friends Brossart and Wilde, who, along with John H. Bartle, F.N. Meyers, and others, formed the First National Bank of Monrovia. A national charter for the bank was secured after he sent a telegram to his former partner Isaac S. Struble in Washington, D.C., who helped arrange for permission. In the beginning, Sartori became the bank's Cashier, while Brossart became President and Perkins was made Vice President. Later, Isaias W. Hellman became the bank's president, while Wilde was Vice President and Sartori remained Cashier. Hellman would become an important influence in Sartori's future efforts. The bank opened July 2, 1887. Sartori would later become Vice President, a post he would hold until 1924, when the bank was acquired by Sartori's Security Trust and Savings. In the summer of 1887, Monrovia decided to incorporate. The first election was held in December and Sartori was elected Treasurer, his first and only public office. In early 1888, real estate sales in Los Angeles began to wane and soon the boom was over. First National weathered the subsequent depression, but Sartori saw that opportunities in Los Angeles would be greater than those in Monrovia. Security Savings Bank and Trust Company Maurice S. Hellman Sartori moved to Los Angeles, and by the end of 1888, he and a group of associates started Los Angeles Loan and Trust, then expanded that organization into the Security Savings Bank and Trust Company. The board first met on January 19, 1889 and elected F.N. Meyers, President, S.A. Fleming, Vice President and Sartori, Cashier. A number of other local bankers connected with the Farmers and Merchants Bank were involved in its founding. Isaias W. Hellman, Jackson Graves, Herman W. Hellman, and Ozro W. Childs were among the stockholders and served on the board of directors. Capitalized at $200,000, the bank opened its doors on February 11, 1889, in the Weil Building at 148 South Main Street. While the national Panic of 1893 resulted in runs on some Los Angeles banks, because Security was a savings bank it could legally require six months' notice of the intention to withdraw any term deposits. Once depositors saw that the bank would not be subject to a run on its funds, the bank withstood the crisis. But a disagreement was developing between Sartori and F.N. Meyers, who thought the bank was too conservatively managed. In January, 1894, in a proxy battle, Meyers gained control, formed own board and changed management, leaving Sartori and his friends out. During the year he was no longer a part of the bank, Sartori formed a partnership with Maurice S. Hellman, with offices located in the Bradbury Building, to deal in municipal bonds and other securities. In this he was supported by Isaias W. Hellman, Herman W. Hellman, Henry O'Melveney and Jackson Graves. In the January 1895 meeting, through the purchase of Myers' nephews stock, Sartori and his friends were able to take back control of the firm. Sartori was elected President; Maurice S. Hellman became an active Vice President, and Willis D. Longyear was made Cashier and Secretary. It was the beginning of a new era for the bank. Sartori met the new opportunity with renewed sense of optimism - a belief in California and especially in Southern California. Los Angeles Country Club Sartori became interested in golf when, out bicycling one day with a friend, golfer Ed Tufts invited the pair to try the game at a local course. He was immediately hooked. A group in the West Adams district had organized \\"The Los Angeles Golf Club\\", rented 16 acres at Pico and Alvarado and built a 9-hole golf course, the Windmill Links, so-called because an old windmill served as the clubhouse. In September, 1898, the club decided to incorporate, filing papers on October 3, 1898 as the Los Angeles Country Club. At the time, Sartori was considered one of the best five players in the club. As other communities began to form golf clubs, a group of these communities formed the California Golf Club Association on July 29, 1899. Sartori would be President of the Association from 1903 to 1905. Late in 1899, realizing that the club needed a larger course, Sartori and other members organized the County Club Land Association and purchased a 107-acre tract from the Cottle Brothers for $25,000 at Pico and Western. Sartori himself planned the new 18-hole course, which opened November 4, 1899. But even this course proved to be unsatisfactory, so Sartori and Tufts looked for a better location. They looked at 320 acres of the Wolfskill Ranch nearer to Santa Monica, California. On December 25, 1904, Sartori proposed a plan to purchase the property and hold it for the club. The $48,000 cost was soon subscribed. In October 1905, the Realty Company, the organization formed to purchase and hold the land, proposed to sell the club 145 acres for $22,300 and to use the balance of the property to finance the course and the clubhouse. The clubhouse, designed by Hunt, Eager and Burns, opened May 30, 1911. Sartori was elected President, and was continually re-elected until his death in 1946. Growth of the bank In 1896 the name of the bank was changed to Security Savings Bank and it moved to Main and Second Streets. But, as the center of business activity moved, the bank moved. So it was, in 1904, that the bank again moved, this time to a new building, erected by Herman W. Hellman, at 4th and Spring Streets. In 1904, the bank purchased Thomas L. Duque's Main Street Savings Bank. In 1905, it merged with the Los Angeles Savings Bank, and by the end of 1905, its deposits passed $12 million. In December 1907, the bank consolidated with the California Savings Bank, and then, on December 14, 1907 it moved into the new Security Building at 5th and Spring Streets. Other fields Sartori was involved in Los Angeles' early oil and gas industries. In May 1895, the Central Oil Company showed Sartori on the Board of Directors. It was a part of Sartori's nature was to try to bring order out of chaos, and it was this that led him to call a meeting of 15 smaller oil companies in San Francisco, a meeting that resulted in the creation of the Associated Oil Company, one of the major oil companies in the state. Thaddeus S. C. Lowe had been active in the natural gas field, but could not meet all the demand. In response to the failure of private enterprise to meet demand adequately, John Randolph Haynes, Sartori and others organized the Los Angeles City Gas Company as competition, to eventually be sold to Los Angeles as a municipal system. This ultimately did not happen as planned, and in September 1908, the City Gas Company was purchased by the Domestic Gas Company, whose President was William G. Kerckhoff. This company would be taken over two years later by the newly formed Southern California Gas Company. Sartori also owned stock in the San Joaquin Light and Power Company, and eventually sold a controlling interest to Kerckhoff. Sartori continued to be interested in investing in land. He was one of many investors in the George K. Porter Ranch in October, 1903, along with E.H. Harriman, Henry E. Huntington, William G. Kerckhoff, General Harrison Gray Otis, Edwin T. Earl, George C. Hunt and A. B. Hammond. The ranch sale, 16,450 acres for a total of $575,750, or $35 an acre, was brokered by Leslie C. Brand, and comprised the middle third of the northern half of the San Fernando Valley. Negotiations had been ongoing since the spring of 1901. This land deal would later be controversial, as the terminus of the Owens Valley aqueduct would be located near the Porter ranch lands, making them more valuable, and there was a suggestion that General Moses Sherman, a member of the Board of Water Commissioners, had advance knowledge of the project, which he may have passed on to some of the men who were part of the syndicate. California Bank Act of 1909 The Panic of 1907 led the state of California to appoint a commission to draft a banking act. The California Bankers Association appointed a legislative committee to work with the commission; Sartori was a member of the committee. He made substantial contributions to the efforts of the Commission, drawing from in-depth research into the banking laws of other states, and adding his own ideas. One of his chief concerns was in protecting the depositor. He was especially against banks selling bonds, after seeing the dismal results of irrigation district bonds. The Act was adopted in 1910. From 1909 to 1929, Sartori was either the Chairman or the Vice Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the California Bankers Association. He also took an active interest in the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, serving at one point as a director. He served on the Currency Commission of the American Bankers Association from 1912 to 1918.The Michigan Alumnus, Vol. 47, November 16, 1940, p.139 Security was reorganized to operate in the three banking areas spelled out in the act: Savings, Commercial and Trust. The act allowed branch banking, and Security established its first branch in 1912 when it took on the Equitable Savings Bank, and retrained it as its Equitable Branch. In 1912, after the bank acquired the Southern Trust Company of Los Angeles, Sartori changed the name of the bank to Security Trust and Savings Bank. He engaged lawyer and former state senator Louis Roseberry to head the new Trust Department. Branch banking After World War I, the bank slowly began to consider branch banking. In 1919 the bank acquired Hollywood National Bank and Citizens Savings Bank of Hollywood. It operated both as the Hollywood Branch. In 1920, it opened a third branch at Seventh and Grand. By the end of 1920, now a $100 million bank, Security engaged with 30 other banks to more thoroughly study branch banking. After their report was received, the banks began expanding. Sartori, always careful, expanded cautiously. Acquisitions included seven in 1922; eleven in 1923 and thirteen in 1924, including his old firm, the First National Bank of Monrovia. The growth of many communities that Security served allowed the firm to build larger buildings for its larger branches: the Hollywood Security Building in 1922, the Glendale Security Building in 1924, and the Long Beach Security Building in 1925. While Security expanded its branch organization, Amadeo Giannini's Bank of Italy, already a major force in Northern California, sought to expand his firm's presence in Southern California. He wanted to name his branch organization Security Bank and Trust Company. Sartori felt this was sufficiently close to Security's name to cause confusion in the minds of consumers. Sartori took Giannini to court and prevailed, but the Bank of Italy chief did not give up easily and continued litigation. The controversy ended when, after a series of new acquisitions, Giannini decided to name his entire organization The Bank of America. Merger with First National Bank of Los Angeles As part of the fallout from the Julian Petroleum Corporation Stock scandal, the First National Bank was significantly weakened. A merger was proposed, but Sartori insisted that any employee that had any association with the Julian deals had to resign. They did so, and on April 1, 1929 Security merged with the Los Angeles-First National Trust and Savings Bank, creating the 8th largest bank in the United States, Security-First National Bank of Los Angeles. In 1934, 75-year-old Sartori retired as President, and became Chairman of the managing committee, while George M. Wallace became President. Civic activities In 1907 the trustees of the overcrowded State Normal School were authorized to sell the site at Fifth and Grand. Sartori organized a group called the Normal Site Company to purchase a site and convey it to the city of Los Angeles. They held it for 6 years and then sold it to the city in 1913. It enabled Fifth Street to be cut through and was used for the Library site. After Westwood was selected as the site for the new campus of the University of California, Sartori accepted the responsibility for raising the $1.4 million purchase price. When Teresa Sartori, Joseph's mother, died of cancer in 1901, Joseph and his father established a hospital in Cedar Falls, Iowa in her memory, Sartori Memorial Hospital.\\"Banker and Civic Leader Sartori Succumbs at 87,\\" Los Angeles Times, October 7, 1946, page 1 Sartori was instrumental in the development of the industrial community of Torrance, California. The Dominguez Land Company was created in 1911 under the leadership of Jared Sidney Torrance, who was company president. Torrance and Sartori had been colleagues in the Normal Site Company in 1907. In 1911, they purchased 2,792 acres of land from the Dominguez Estate Company and 730 acres from the Del Amo Estate Company which was subdivided and sold off, eventually forming the city of Torrance, CA. Sartori Avenue in old downtown Torrance paralleled the Pacific Electric Railway's tracks to its massive Torrance Shop complex. Sartori established the California Community Foundation in 1915 in response to the first such foundation, formed in the city of Cleveland. The idea was that a bank in the community would serve as trustee for donated funds, the annual income of which could be distributed according to the benefactor's wishes. The bank invested the money, and an advisory committee separate from the bank was charged with distributing the funds. After World War I, as people poured into Southern California and a new wave of speculation in real estate and stocks began, Sartori, remembering the fallout from the 1887 boom, was critical of these Roaring '20s. But he was a believer in Southern California and in progress, and helped in its development in many ways. Sartori was key to the development of the Millennium Biltmore Hotel. In April 1921, Sartori called a meeting of forty prominent business and financial leaders to develop a great hotel for the great city of Los Angeles. This included Harry Chandler, Arthur Letts, Cecil B. De Mille, Henry M. Robinson, Moses Sherman, Marco Hellman, Ben R. Meyer, Andrew M. Chaffey, Charles H. Toll, and George I. Cochran. Their major objective was to see that Los Angeles was on the cutting edge of the American Experience. The group voted to acquire land at the southwest corner of Fifth and Olive Streets, which would be near the railway terminals and on main traffic avenues. They agreed that none of group should profit from the transaction. On October 6, they formed the Central Investment Corporation, and elected financier Lee A. Phillips as president. John McEntee Bowman was engaged to run the hotel, and he in turn suggested Shulze and Weaver as architects. The operating company, the Los Angeles Biltmore Company, was formed in November 1921. At an estimated cost of $8.5 million, there was some question as to how the money would be raised. The CIC undertook to sell $3.5 million in bonds and the rest in stock. Sartori organized the 600-stockholder syndicate behind the financing of the hotel. Three banks agreed to sell the bonds at 1.5 points above par (each $100 bond therefore sold for $101.50). The stock offering sold out in five weeks. As a member and President of the Central Business District Association, he was also instrumental in developing Los Angeles Civic Center and the Subway Terminal Building. He was chairman of a committee which sought a site for a civic center for Los Angeles north of First Street, and sought voter approval of the $7,500,000 bond measure to build the new City Hall. The Subway Terminal Building was a joint project of the Pacific Electric Railway and the Subway Terminal Corporation, consisting of some of the city's leading citizens, which was completed in 1926 over the terminus of the Pacific Electric Railway's Hollywood subway. Sartori was interested in the project partly as a means for stabilizing the central business district, the center of which had shifted over the years. During World War I, he was a factor in organizing the Los Angeles Steamship and Dry Dock Company, and was later a director in that firm. He was also a director for The Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. Personal life In 1921, he joined the Valentine Camp, a 160-acre private camp on the eastern slope of the high Sierra above Mammoth. It was owned by E.E. Milliken, W.L. Valentine, Sartori, William G. Kerckhoff, Henry W. O'Melveney and J.E. Cook. He enjoyed many hours here, away from the pressures of commercial life. Sartori was active in the Los Angeles Athletic Club, was a past president of the California Club, and past director for the Automobile Club of Southern California and a member of the Jonathan Club and the University Club. Sartori and his wife had a single foster daughter, Juliette Boileau, who married George Wallace, President of Security-First National Bank. In 1891 Mrs. Sartori became one of the founding members of the Friday Morning club and had an interest in opera and athletics. She was a regent of the University of California and was active in the Federation of Women's Clubs. Margaret Sartori died on May 2, 1937. Joseph Francis Sartori died October 6, 1946.

The current fort was built between 1884‚Äì86 and replaced an earlier structure on the same site; its most notable feature is a 100-ton Gruson rotating turret on its roof, the last remaining example of its type. The fort was used by the Austrians in artillery duels against Montenegrin batteries stationed on Mount Lovƒáen during the First World War. The Montenegrins were unable to destroy it and were pushed out of range in 1916 by an Austrian offensive. The damage to the fort was repaired and its guns were removed to support the Austrian field army. It was used as a depot by the Yugoslav Army until as recently as the early 1990s. It was subsequently abandoned and can be visited by the public. Background Map of the Bay of Kotor in 1862 The southernmost tip of the Austro-Hungarian Empire included the area of the Bay of Kotor, which was used by the empire as a major naval base centred on the town of Kotor (known then as Cattaro). The hinterland behind the bay was controlled by the independent principality (later kingdom) of Montenegro, which controlled the mountains to the east of Kotor. The Austro-Hungarians faced significant problems in holding on to the territory, as the Montenegrins and their Russian allies aspired to take control of the Bay and Austrian rule was not universally accepted by the area's inhabitants. Two serious rebellions were mounted by the powerful Krivo≈°ije clan who lived on the eastern flanks of Mount Orjen above Risan. In 1869 the clan defeated an Austro-Hungarian force sent to quell their rebellion and nearly took the fortress at Gora≈æde. The Austrians responded to the uprising by building a series of fortifications around the Bay of Kotor and at strategic points further inland, and strengthening or rebuilding existing fortresses, including the one at Gora≈æde. Description The fort stands on the hill of Gora≈æde (known in Austro- Hungarian times as Gorazda) at an altitude of , around from Kotor. It overlooks the Austrian-built road from Kotor to the former Montenegrin capital Cetinje and comprises a heavily reinforced stone and concrete structure situated within a ditch, with caponiers at the corners for close range defence. Its symmetrical layout, with two wings joined by a circular structure, is unusual for this type of mountain fortress. The fort dominates the heights above Kotor and guards one flank of the pass leading to the town, with the ≈†kaljari Battery and Fort Vrmac a few kilometers away on the other side of the pass.Sullivan, p. 14 From 1909, it was also supported by Fort Tra≈°te located on the hills above the plain of Tivaksko polje. The entrance to the two-storey fortress is reached via a curved track that passes between two retaining walls and crosses a retractable bridge across the ditch. The inscription \\"Thurmfort Gorazda\\" is still visible above the main entrance, which is protected by a steel door, still in situ. The barracks rooms are situated on the lower level, with casemates on the upper level, reached via two spiral staircases. Two rotating ≈†koda observation turrets are situated on the roof, above infantry positions that were constructed to boost the fort's close-range defences. A giant 100-ton German-made Gruson rotating turret, which once housed the fort's main armament, sits above the central part of the fort. The turret is the last surviving example of its kind and was manually powered, with a two-man crank used to rotate it. History The fortress's predecessor was built prior to the 1869 uprising but was replaced with the current structure between 1884‚Äì86. It was one of the first of the new fortresses around the Bay of Kotor to be constructed as part of the Austrians' late 19th century programme of improvements in the area. The two observation posts were installed in 1906‚Äì07. Although plans were mooted in 1910 to redevelop the fortress and install two new howitzer turrets and machine-gun and observation turrets, the outbreak of the First World War precluded this. During the war, it was garrisoned by 8 officers and 195 men and was armed with six minimum charter M80 mortars and two M4 casemate guns, plus three M4 machine guns, two M7 machine guns and 25 gun carriages. The fortress was heavily attacked by the Montenegrins from positions on Mount Lovƒáen, prompting the Austro-Hungarians to add the two concrete infantry positions on the roof in 1915 to guard against close-range attacks. Although it was bombarded with artillery weapons of up to calibre, they did little damage and in 1916 an Austrian offensive pushed Montenegrin forces out of artillery range. The fortress was repaired and stripped of its guns, which were used to support the Austrian field army. It was taken over by the Yugoslav Army following the war and continued to be used as an army depot until as recently as the early 1990s. It is now abandoned and is freely accessible by the public. Its attractive situation has led to it being used on several occasions as a film location, most recently by the Italian production Il Cuore nel Pozzo in 2005. However, its accessibility and lack of protection by the state has meant that it has been extensively targeted by metal thieves, who have stolen many of the fort's interior fittings.

It also removes the rule's safe harbor protection, which currently allows attorneys to correct their pleadings, claims or contentions within a 21-day period without fear of sanctions. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate during the 114th United States Congress on February 5, 2015.H.R. 758 (2015) https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr758 In a 19-13 vote on May 13, the House Judiciary Committee passed the bill.

Early life Carl McClellan Hill was born July 27, 1907 in Norfolk, Virginia, to William Franklin and Sarah Rowe Hill. Education Hill attended Norfolk public schools. He earned a B.Sc. degree in organic chemistry from Hampton Institute in 1931. During the 1930s, Hill taught science at the George P. Phenix Laboratory School, a high school associated with the Hampton Institute. After working briefly as an assistant professor of chemistry at Hampton Institute (1939-1940), Hill returned to the high school as principal (1940-1941). Hill received his M.Sc. degree in organic chemistry from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York in 1935. His master's thesis was on The action of Grignard reagents on [alpha], [beta]-unsaturated ethers (1935). Denied admission at the University of Virginia, Hill applied successfully for a Rosenwald Fellowship to complete his doctorate at Cornell. He received $1,500 and was awarded his Ph.D. in organic chemistry by Cornell in 1941. His Ph.D. thesis topic was Studies of ketenes and their derivatives (1941). Career Carl McClellan Hill worked as an assistant professor of chemistry at North Carolina A&T; University beginning in 1941. In 1944, he joined Tennessee State University, where he served as dean of the school of chemistry from 1944 to 1951, and later dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, as well as maintaining an active research career. By 1962 he was considered one of the top six chemists in the country. On December 4, 1962, Hill became president of Kentucky State College, succeeding Rufus B. Atwood. Under his direction, the college was formally raised to university status, and renamed Kentucky State University in 1972. Hill also pushed for increased integration, increasing white enrollment at the historically black school. Hill would remain at KSU until retiring in 1975, the second-longest presidential term at KSU at that time. A year after his retirement he returned to Hampton Institute, serving as its interim president from 1976 to 1977 and president from 1977 to 1978. As an organic chemist, Hill was a chief investigator, often collaborating with his first wife, chemist Mary Elliott Hill on joint research projects, which continued to focus on Grignard reagents and ketenes. He published more than fifty research papers. The Hills collaborated on textbooks such as General College Chemistry (1944) with Myron B. Towns and Experiments in Organic Chemistry (1954). Awards and honors Hill received an honorary doctor of laws degree from the University of Kentucky in 1966, an honorary doctorate of science from Eastern Kentucky University in 1975, and an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Louisville in 1975. He was named Outstanding Alumnus at Large of Hampton University in 1969. Personal life Hill was an Elder of the First Presbyterian Church of Hampton, and served on the General Executive Board and Executive Committee of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church. He was also active as a member of its Board of World Missions. Likely between 1925 and 1927, he married Mary Elliott (1907‚Äì1969), with whom he worked for much of his career. In 1970, he married Helen Ware Collins (1922-2011). Among other activities, Carl and Helen were active members of the Virginia Peninsula Rose Society.

Services at Ramoth were held in the Welsh language. Following renovation in 1982, the building continues to be used for Christian worship as an Assemblies of God fellowship. Foundation and early history The history of Ramoth starts in the early 19th century, when meetings were held in a house owned by George Overton of the Hirwaun Ironworks. However, the early years were difficult and meetings ceased to be held for a time following the closure of the ironworks. The cause revived in 1818. A chapel was opened in 1825 as a branch of Calfaria, Aberdare. There were around 50 members during this period and the opening services were held on 18 June 1826. The chapel was licensed in 1830 and Ramoth accepted to the East Glamorgan Baptist Association at Aberfan in 1831. The first minister between 1832 and 1834 was William Lewis, who was also minister of Calfaria, Aberdare. In 1840, with membership at 76, it was decided to build a new chapel, which was opened in 1843. While the new chapel was being built, Benjamin Evans, a student from Pontypool College, was ordained as minister of Ramoth. He remained for fifteen years and during this time a branch of Ramoth was opened at Heolyfelin. By 1849, membership had increased to 178. In 1853, T.W. Rammell's report on public health in the parish of Aberdare stated that the burial ground at Ramoth was nearly full and, due to its proximity to housing, should be among a number of nonconformist burial grounds that should be closed. Thomas Joseph, a colliery proprietor, was a deacon at Ramoth. In the early 1850s he opened a new colliery at Trecynon and persuaded many Hirwaun colliers who were members at Ramoth to move with him. Joseph was the pivotal figure in the formation of the new church at Heolyfelin, and for a time the membership at Ramoth declined considerably and the cause struggled to remain in existence. The following ministered at Ramoth in the late nineteenth century: Benjamin Watkins (1857-58), D. Davies (1863-69), E. Colwyn Evans (1872-91) and David Collier (1892-97). Twentieth century J.S. Johns arrived as minister in 1899, but died two years later at a young age. Peak membership was reached in 1904, and in 1913 a new organ was installed following a gift from Andrew Carnegie. George Hague was minister from 1903-10 and was followed by E. Cefni Jones (1911-20). E.J. Hughes was the longest serving minister from 1923 until 1958. There is a wax cylinder recording of Rev. E. Roberts made at Ramoth during the Welsh Revival of 1905. The chapel closed as a Baptist cause in 1982, but was renovated and re-opened as a place of Christian worship in the 1990s. Ramoth Christian Centre celebrated 150 years at its present location in 2018, and the current building is in its third incarnation.

He had two sons Raymond M. and LeRoy C. who worked in his architectural practice since 1911 and continued on in his name after his death. Career Montrose Morris opened his architectural office in 1883 in his early 20s. His advertising technique was to design and build his own residence on Hancock Street between Marcy and Tompkins Avenues in Bedford Stuyvesant and open it to the public. One of the visitors was developer Louis F. Seitz who later commissioned three apartment buildings from Morris. Morris‚Äô apartment buildings are among the earliest built in Brooklyn. During the 19th century, single-family row houses were the residential homes of choice for the middle class. Apartments or ‚Äúflathouses‚Äù were considered inferior and there was a distinct prejudice against them. Only toward the end of the century did it become socially acceptable for the middle class to live in an apartment house. The high-quality of the design and richness of materials Morris used were intended to attract middle-class families.Dillon, James T. (March 18, 1986) \\"Imperial Apartments Designation Report\\" New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission Retrieved: April 17, 2015. Between 1885 and 1905 were some of Morris‚Äô best years.

Derbyshire. Nikolaus Pevsner. Yale University Press. 1978. Built in the 14th century, it is known as the \\"Mollis Chapel\\" because of a stained glass window which shows the rising sun above the cross which was fixed to it by the local saint. History The nave Recumbent effigy and chest tomb of Sir Nicholas de Cantilupe (d.1266), father of William de Cantilupe, 1st Baron Cantilupe (1262-1308); St Mary's Church, Ilkeston The church was founded in 1150, the oldest visible part of the fabric being the three Norman arches in the south arcade which date from the close of the 12th century when the Norman Stye was changing into early English. An architectural report in 1855 said that 'no church in englan possesses any euql to them and they can never be surpassed in thei lightness of their tracery. Also remarkable is the arcade between the chancel and Peter Chapel with its Early English Arches whose capitals are decorated with small bossy leaves in which can be seen the impish faces of the green men of the forest. Between the chancel and the Peter Chapel is the recumbent stone effigy and chest tomb of Sir Nicholas de Cantilupe (d.1266) of Withcall in Lincolnshire, Greasley in Nottinghamshire and Ilkeston in Derbyshire, who married Eustachia FitzHugh, daughter and heiress of Ralph FitzHugh of Greasley. His son was William de Cantilupe, 1st Baron Cantilupe (1262-1308) of Greasley and of Ravensthorpe Castle in the parish of Boltby, North Yorkshire. The monument would once have stood in a central position and was mentioned as being in the chancel in 1662 and again in 1716. The spire on the tower was destroyed by a lightning strike in 1714. It was extensively restored between 1853 and 1855 by Thomas Larkins Walker. The north and south aisles were rebuilt, and they were restored to their original length towards the west. The chantry chapel was rebuilt to accommodate nearly 300 children. The chancel arch was restored and the tower was re-cased. A new vestry was added on the foundations of the old sacristry, adjoining the south wall of the chapel. New seating and flooring was fitted, and new heating and lighting was installed. The contractor was Lindley and Fearn of Leicester. It was reopened on 18 October 1855. The west end was enlarged and rebuilt between 1909 and 1910 by Percy Heylyn Currey when the tower was removed stone by stone and rebuilt as it is seen today. It was reopened for worship on 20 September 1910 by the Bishop of Southwell. Organ The church contains an organ by Bishop dating from 1831 which was originally in the church of St John the Evangelist in Paddington where it was reputedly played by Mendelssohn. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. Organists *Cecil Wyer 1919  ????

It was followed by the 1892 election. Overview of the result 1889 was one of those landmark years in the history of Welsh Liberalism, a coming of age symbolized by the triumph across Wales of Liberal candidates in the inaugural county council elections. Candidates and unopposed returns Most of the seats were contested by Liberal and Conservative candidates. The number of unopposed returns was small. Contested elections There were a large number of contested elections and the majorities were small in most instances. The Liberals won a large majority of the seats with only nine Conservatives returned. There were also two Liberal Unionists, in Carmarthen and Llansteffan. Summary of results This section summarises the detailed results which are noted in the following sections. This was the inaugural county election and therefore no comparison can be made with the previous elections.

It was built in 1945 by Catalan architect Luis Llach Llagostera. It is located on the corner of 2nd Street and Avenue 3 of the Central American capital, north of the Edificio Correos, with which it forms one of the most recognized architectural ensembles of the Josefino neighborhood. Its architectural style combines art deco with neoclassical. Considered to be of great beauty and historical value, was declared a Historical Architectural Heritage of Costa Rica in February 2000. Its name comes from Carmen Herdocia Rojas, who was its first owner. History The land where the Edificio Herdocia is located has had several owners since the middle of the 19th Century. In 1934, the property was inherited by Carmen Herdocia Rojas, at the time a student in London. The house that existed on the land was demolished in 1945 to make way for the beginning of construction. From the time of completion until today, it has been used commercially. On December 20, 1999, Decree 7555 was issued, whose 7th and 8th articles declared the building to be a Historical Architectural Heritage of Costa Rica, which became effective with its publication in the official newspaper La Gaceta on February 23, 2000. After several years of abandonment, vandalism, and neglect, it was restored by the Heritage Center of the Ministry of Culture at a cost of 90 million colones (about $180,000), with the aim of rescuing its historical facade. Architecture The building's architecture marks a transition between the neoclassical style and Catalan modernism. It stands out as uncharacteristic of the usual style of architect Luis Llach. It is his only building that has more than two floors. Its structure is primarily brick and concrete. It has four symmetrical levels, with a central tower that occupies the main corner of the building. It is best known for its facade, which is considered a simplification of the neoclassical style, with attached columns with pedestals and capitals. It has baroque features, especially in the windows, such as the helices that span them and the arches at the center of the crowning relief. Towards the north and west on the fourth floor, there are several concrete pergolas with neoclassical figureheads. The decoration shows historical embellishments such as pilasters and corbels alongside simpler, more modern elements such as the cornices and pediments.

Founded in 1991, it operates 57 outlets in the UK as of July 2019. It specialises in Latin American food from Brazil, Mexico and beyond, cooked from scratch. History A Las Iguanas restaurant in London The first Las Iguanas opened on St Nicholas Street, Bristol, in April 1991, offering a Latin American-themed menu. A further 53 restaurants have opened in the UK including Bath, Manchester, London and Edinburgh. In 2003, the group acquired its own Cacha√ßa sugar cane field and distillery on the Fazenda do Anil estate, outside Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

It won Best Non-traditional Cuban Sandwich and was runner up in World's Best Traditional Cuban Sandwich at the International Cuban Sandwich Festival in Tampa, Florida in April 2018. Controversy Las Iguanas hit the headlines in August 2015 after their controversial tips policy was revealed. Staff had to pay back 3% of all sales (4.4% in London) to the company at the end of every shift out of their tips. Some staff had claimed that this charge was taken even when they had received no tips for some tables forcing them to 'pay to work'. Las Iguanas denied that the charge was ever taken from staff wages. Since then they had an internal vote amongst all the staff to agree a new policy. 100% of cash tips are now shared by the team. When tips or service charge are paid for by a credit card or debit card, the company take a 2.5% administration charge, before distributing the remainder to employees (passing on fees for opting to pay by credit or debit card to customers was banned in the UK in January 2018). Tips and service charges are in addition to the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage. In practice, this means for every ¬£1 in tips given on a credit card, the company keeps 2.5p to cover credit card fees and administration costs.

Megafans differ from Alluvial fans in their sheer size. Due to their larger size, they may be formed by different geomorphic processes. The criterion of what differentiates megafans from typical alluvial fans is an artificial one of scale. The scale divide varies in the literature, with the most common being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values as little of 30-km apex-to-toe length have been proposed, as well as alternative metrics like coverage areas of greater than 10,000 square-km. Formation The flow source from the apex occupies a portion of the fans apron, building up that portion with depositions. Through complex processes like avulsion, the stream changes course over time occupying different areas of the fan. Over long periods of time, sediment builds up creating a fan formation. Generally the three-dimensional architecture of megafan deposits consists of multi-storied sandsheets, gravel in upper reaches, interbedded with overbank muddy layers, thickness and facies distribution vary from upstream to downstream reaches Rivers forming large fans happen in various settings around the world most notably, in foreland settings (e.g. Kosi, Gandak, Pastaza), intracratonic basins (e.g. Pantanal, Taquari, Cuiaba), and in complex settings like in the case of Pilcomayo. Although the distribution of megafans occur throughout many environments, the Tropics are home of the largest megafans of the world in the Chaco Plain, with the largest being the Pilcomayo.

Krentz likened the novel to a historical romance set in another world, and its success inspired her to begin writing historical romances under the pseudonym Amanda Quick. Background In the early 1980s, Krentz wrote several contemporary romances under the pen name Stephanie James. One of these, The Devil to Pay, released in 1985, featured a heroine who wrote science fiction novels. Readers enjoyed the small science fiction references in the story, inspiring Krentz to incorporate those elements into a romance plot.Pierce, p. 99. Before the 1980s, there was almost zero overlap between the popular fiction genres of romance novels and science fiction. Beginning in the early 1980s, time travel themes began to appear in some romances, but the novels focused primarily on the difficulties of assimilation as a conflict between the hero and heroine. Krentz's follow-up to The Devil to Pay, Sweet Starfire, was the first romance novel to fully embrace science fiction precepts. It launched the futuristic romance subgenre.Pierce, p. 98. The novel was initially released in 1986. It was re-released in 2002 in an omnibus edition with Crystal Flame. Krentz credits these two novels with giving her the inspiration to write historical romances. She has since released more than a dozen bestselling historical romances under the pen name Amanda Quick. Plot summary The novel is set in a futuristic universe. The hero, Teague Severance, is captain of a starship that operates on the frontiers of the galaxy. Cidra Rainforest hires him to help her find a shrine built by the Ghosts, an alien race which has gone extinct. The shrine to hold the secret to perfect mental communion, which is highly desired among the sect to which Cidra belongs. The journey brings them to the planet Renaissance, where Teague battles an old enemy. Cidra saves his life. The duo eventually find the shrine. Cidra discovers that she is not a true member of the sect - rather than seeking mental communion at all costs, she is a fighter, wanting a good life for herself. She joins Teague's sect. By now, the protagonists are in love and prepared to spend their lives together. Genre Sweet Starfire is in some ways a classic romance novel. While on a journey, the heroine meets a man who is the opposite of everything she thought she wanted and by the end of the novel they have fallen in love. The novel is set in a futuristic world. The plot uses several tropes common to science fiction novels. The hero's home is in a remote part of the galaxy which is still becoming used to the idea of spaceflight. He is more rugged, physical rather than intellectual. Krentz remarked that the novel is essentially a historical romance set in a different world. Themes The race the protagonists seek are revealed to be extinct because they essentially gave up on the messiness of life in favor of the ideal of mental harmony. They stopped bearing children, and the race died out. The heroine expresses anger that the Ghosts essentially gave up on continuing their line. She chooses to turn her back on the sect that also favors mental harmony in favor of one that values love and families and is willing to fight for those ideals. Critic John J. Pierce attributes this Darwinian philosophy to the influence of Robert Heinlein, whose books were favorites of Krentz.Pierce, p. 100. Reception Romantic Times awarded the novel 4.5 out of 5 stars. Reviewer Tara Gelsomino praised the depth of the emotional relationship that Krentz created between the protagonists and the sexual tension that simmered between them.

The Oregon Pioneer Association (originally known as the Oregon Pioneer Society), first established in October 1867, was a fraternal and lineage society and historical organization for early American settlers of the Oregon Territory. The Association, a non-governmental organization, had both fraternal and academic aspects. Its members gathered at conventions and published annual addresses dealing with pioneer life. The group thrived throughout the decades of the 1870s and 1880s, eventually giving way due to the attrition of its members to a new organization known as the Sons and Daughters of Oregon Pioneers, established in 1901. The OPA appears to have terminated in approximately 1928. History Establishment Seal of the OPA, which the group began using during the 1890s. The Oregon Pioneer Society (OPS) was organized in Salem, Oregon at a meeting held October 8 and 9, 1867, in the Oregon State Capitol building's hall of the house of representatives.Hubert Howe Bancroft, The Works of Hubert Howe Bancroft: Volume XXX: History of Oregon: Volume II, 1848-1888. San Francisco, CA: The History Company, 1888; pg. 603. The individual given chief credit for organization of the Society was William H. Gray, who was simultaneously involved in the establishment of a historical research organization, the Oregon Pioneer and Historical Society, with an office located in Astoria. Membership in the Oregon Pioneer Society was open to any individual who came to Oregon during the period that the Oregon Territory was under join occupancy of the United States and Great Britain, or who had been born in or settled in the Oregon Territory prior to January 1, 1854. The OPS held annual gatherings, typically in approximate conjunction with the June 15 anniversary of the Oregon Treaty of 1846, which formally ended the Oregon boundary dispute between the United States and Great Britain. Annual conventions were held at various locales throughout the state, at which keynote addresses dealing with themes of pioneer history were delivered by leading participants. The Society maintained an archive including a list of its members, details of their place of birth and move to Oregon. Renaming For more than half a century the Oregon Pioneer Association published pamphlets containing speeches delivered to its annual meetings and other historical materials. On October 18, 1873, the Oregon Pioneer Society was reorganized as the Oregon Pioneer Association (OPA). The group continued to hold annual meetings each June, usually around the June 15 \\"Pioneer Day\\" holiday,A campaign to make June 15 an Oregon state holiday called \\"Pioneer Day\\" was promoted by the OPA. The idea is credited to Secretary of State Stephen F. Chadwick, who advanced the notion in a letter to OPA President John W. Grim on November 19, 1873. See: Transactions of the Nineteenth Annual Reunion of the Oregon Pioneer Society for 1891. Portland, OR: A. Anderson & Co., 1891; pg. 32. with stenographic reports of these meetings published in pamphlet form for the historical record. In 1874 the Oregon Pioneer Association offered to merge with the Oregon Historical Society, but the offer was declined, apparently due to the latter group's intention to limit itself to historical study rather than fraternal interaction. The OPA remained financially and socially viable well into the decade of the 1880s. There followed a 15-year decline, as death took its toll and the membership and associated dues revenue which supported the Oregon Pioneer Association plummeted.George H. Himes, \\"Oregon Pioneer Association,\\" in The Oregon Native Son and Historical Magazine, vol. 1, no. 1 (May 1899), pp. 7-9. The OPA entered into partnership with a new organization, the Native Sons of Oregon in 1899, along with another aging and declining fraternal organization of the pioneer period, the Indian War Veterans of the North Pacific Coast.See articles in: The Oregon Native Son and Historical Magazine, vol. 1, no. 1 (May 1899), front cover and pp. 7-9 and 10-11. Termination Due to its declining numbers inevitably resulting from the deaths of eligible members, the Oregon Pioneer Association was largely supplanted in 1901 by the Sons and Daughters of Oregon Pioneers, a new fraternal and historical association with less stringent eligibility requirements for its members. The OPA proper continued in existence, holding annual meetings through 1928.

A development of the three-engined Caudron C.39, it had one tractor configuration engine in the nose and two push-pull pairs between the wings. It was capable of carrying eight passengers but was not developed. Design and development Apart from its engine configuration, the C.43 was conventional and shared its airframe with the three-engined C.39. The first five engine aircraft built in France, it was a three bay biplane with fabric-covered, rectangular-plan wings mounted without stagger. The lower wing had dihedral outboard of the engines, reducing the large interwing gap from inboard to outboard. Though their spans were about equal (on the C.39, the upper span was and the lower one ) or 93% of the upper) the area of the lower wing was only 76% that of the upper because of a narrower chord. The wings were joined by vertical pairs of interplane struts, the forward members attached near the leading edges, and the centre section was supported by similar, shorter cabane struts from the upper fuselage. The inner bay was defined by two close pairs of interplane struts, which between them supported the push-pull pairs of Le Rh√¥ne 9C nine-cylinder rotary engines about halfway between the wings. Each pair was mounted in a long, cylindrical cowling. Its ailerons, on the upper wing only, were aerodynamically balanced by overhanging extensions beyond the tips, as on the C.39. The fifth engine, another cowled Rh√¥ne, 9 was in the nose; behind it the fuselage had a square section with sides of . The pilot and engineer had a very large, open cockpit, with an impressive array of levers controlling the five engines. Behind the wings the fuselage tapered gently to a broad, triangular fin which carried a vertical edged unbalanced rudder that reached down to the keel. As the tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage, its elevators had a notch for rudder movement. The C.43 had a fixed tailskid undercarriage. There were pairs of mainwheels mounted on single axles attached to a longitudinal bar held under the engine on short V-struts. To prevent nose-overs, there was a fifth wheel mounted under the nose. The wheels could be replaced by flat sided floats, each fixed to the fuselage by two pairs of inverted V-struts, one to each side of the float. Though in floatplane configuration the C.43 sat level over the water, the tailskid was joined by a small, cylindrical float to protect the tail at take-off. The main reason for having five engines was safety. In addition, since the C.43, with a total power of , could lift a useful load of it could have carried eight passengers or freight or arms. There is no evidence in contemporary sources that passenger accommodation or armament was ever fitted. The C.43, along with the C.39 and all but one other competitors, was unsuccessful at the Monaco Grand Prix for seaplanes, held in the spring of 1920. The sole example was purchased by the Section Technique de l'A√©ronautique (S.T.A√©.) to investigate the instrumentation and control requirements of multi-engined aircraft.

In Mormonism, gifts of the Spirit are spiritual endowments that provide benefits to the recipient and to those he or she serves. The seventh Article of Faith states: \\"We believe in the gift of tongues, prophecy, revelation, visions, healing, interpretation of tongues, and so forth.\\" Both males and females can receive spiritual gifts. They are an important component in both the basic beliefs and daily living of Mormons. Mode of acquisition While some Charismatic Christians believe that spiritual gifts are an arbitrary endowment of grace, an important Mormon idea is that spiritual gifts can be bestowed by God upon an individual through diligent seeking and righteous living. Some gifts are developed in the premortal existence. Other spiritual gifts are developed during mortal life and identified by priesthood blessings. For example, many Mormons receive a patriarchal blessing which can reveal some spiritual gifts by revelation. For those who are members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), this blessing is recorded and saved in the official church archives. In contemporary Mormonism, spiritual gifts are most often associated with the gift of the Holy Ghost, which is bestowed by the laying on of hands following baptism in an ordinance called confirmation. During the ordinance, the person being confirmed will receive the verbal admonition to \\"receive the Holy Ghost.\\" From this point forward, the person will be entitled to the constant companionship of the Holy Spirit if they have faith in Jesus Christ and are in a state of true repentance. The recipient will also be entitled to receive personal revelation. There is no clear consensus among Mormon thinkers on whether or not non-Mormons, who have not received the gift of the Holy Ghost, can enjoy spiritual gifts. Early Mormon references do not stress the idea that spiritual gifts are entirely predicated on the gift of the Holy Ghost, while contemporary opinions often do. However, the LDS Church's official website has the following quote, \\"As the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, the gifts of the Spirit 'are obtained through that medium' [the Holy Ghost] and ‚Äúcannot be enjoyed without the gift of the Holy Ghost. ‚Ä¶ The world in general can know nothing about them.‚Äù (Teachings of the Prophet Joseph Smith, comp. Joseph Fielding Smith, Salt Lake City: Deseret Book Co., 1938, pp. 243, 245; see also Elder Marion G. Romney in Conference Report, Apr. 1956, p. 72.) Purpose Many Mormons believe that spiritual gifts may be received according to the needs and capacity of the individual and to the needs of others around him or her. These gifts are given to benefit those who love God in their journey towards eternal life. They also serve as signs of true believers. Controversy The belief that spiritual gifts exist in the present age is called continuationism by some theologians and religious studies scholars. In contrast, the belief that spiritual gifts no longer operate is called cessationism. Continuationists generally believe that cessationists lack faith. Consistent with the rationalism of the modern age, cessationists generally believe continuationists are either deceivers or mentally unhealthy. Historical development and de-emphasis In the early-nineteenth century, the claim of Mormons to supernatural spiritual gifts was very common. Spiritual gifts were promoted in hymns, such as \\"The Spirit of God Like a Fire Is Burning\\", which was included in the first Latter Day Saint hymnal in 1835. However, with the passage of time, supernaturalism has been deemphasized as a normative expression within Mormonism. This de-emphasis is consistent with the general pattern of a young and charismatic religious movement experiencing the petrification of charisma because of new doctrinal standards, fixed rituals, and the policy making of bureaucratic institutions. In regards to the gift of tongues, some early Mormons claimed that their glossolalia (\\"speaking in tongues in a sacred language unknown to any human\\") was an expression of the pure Adamic language. However, beginning in June 1839, glossolalia was de- emphasized in favor of the less supernatural xenoglossia (\\"speaking in tongues in a language that could have been learned by natural means\\"). In regards to the gift of healing, stand alone expressions of supernatural healing have been de-emphasized in favor of comforting the sick via priesthood blessings under institutional sponsorship. Today, few Mormons claim to experience supernaturalism, though there is a greater belief in supernatural gifts within Mormon fundamentalism as compared to the LDS Church. When supernaturalism is claimed in contemporary Mormonism, there is a tendency to attribute the experience to a direct act of God instead of an indirect act through the mediation of spiritual gifts.

Second World War 1831 Naval Air Squadron initially formed on 1 July 1943 at NAS Quonset Point on Rhode Island, equipped with Lend-Lease supplied Vought Corsair fighters . It crossed the Atlantic to Britain in October, but was disbanded on 10 December 1943, when it was broken up to re-inforce 1830 and 1833 Naval Air Squadrons. It reformed on 1 November 1944, again as a Corsair-equipped squadron, at another American naval base, this time NAS Brunswick in Maine. The Squadron returned to Britain in February 1945, embarking on the aircraft carrier which sailed to join the British Pacific Fleet in May 1945. By the time Glory reached the Pacific, the Second World War was almost over, and the ship's Naval Air Wing, including 1831 Squadron, saw no combat. The squadron, without its aircraft, returned to Britain and disbanded on arrival on 13 August 1946. Naval Reserve 1831 Squadron reformed at RNAS Stretton in Cheshire on 1 June 1947 as part of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, equipped with Supermarine Seafire fighters and a single North American Harvard trainer. The squadron, which had its strength supplemented by single examples of the Hawker Sea Fury and Fairey Firefly in 1948, carried out a training deployment aboard in September 1949 and again in August‚ÄìSeptember 1950. The Squadron re-equipped with the Sea Fury in August 1951 and in June 1952, became part of the newly established Northern Air Division of the RNVR, being joined by 1841 Squadron, equipped with Fireflies in the anti-submarine role, in July that year. On 15 June 1953, 1831 Squadron took park in the flypast for the Coronation Fleet Review marking the Coronation of Elizabeth II, and in July that year it carried out more deck landing training aboard Illustrious. In August 1954, the Northern Air Division was deployed to Har Far, Malta for that year's 14-day continuous training period. That month it also replaced its Harvard trainers with Boulton Paul Sea Balliols, which were used both for training and communications duties. From May‚ÄìJune 1955, the Squadron became the first jet-equipped squadron of the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve, replacing its Sea Furys with seven Supermarine Attacker jet fighters and one de Havilland Vampire T22 trainer, while retaining its Sea Balliols. Later that year, the squadron formed a formation aerobatic team with its Attackers, displaying at five airshows that year. On 9 January 1957, it was announced that flying units of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve were to be disbanded, with operational training ending on 10 January. As a result, 1831 Naval Air Squadron disbanded on 10 March 1957. The Squadron reformed on 3 April 1980 at RNAS Lee-on-Solent with the role of giving continuation training to aircrew in the Royal Navy Reserve. It had no aircraft of its own, borrowing aircraft from other squadrons as required. The Squadron moved to RNAS Yeovilton on 1 April 1981 but soon disbanded.

Background In 2006, lead vocalist Jared Leto began to direct music videos for Thirty Seconds to Mars, with the first being \\"The Kill\\". At a press release, he stated that an \\"insanely obnoxious Danish albino\\" named Bartholomew Cubbins directed the video. He later explained his decision to direct with a pseudonym saying, \\"I really wanted people to be able to enjoy and experience the video without having any more preconceived notions or distractions, and just to let it be what it was. It wasn't important for me to lay claim to it in that way.\\" Bartholomew Cubbins is a recurring character in the Dr. Seuss universe and one of Leto's favorite characters created by the writer. The short film received a largely positive response and numerous accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award. The same year, Leto directed the short film for \\"From Yesterday\\". Filmed in the Forbidden City, it became the first ever American music video shot in the People's Republic of China in its entirety. His next short film was \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" (2008). Although he directed it under the pseudonym of Angakok Panipaq, his alter ego Bartholomew Cubbins received a \\"special thanks\\" credit. The music video was filmed 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle in Greenland, with Leto working with the Natural Resources Defense Council to develop strategies that would minimize fuel consumption on the shoot. Upon release, \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" was met with widespread critical acclaim, resulting in various accolades, including the MTV Europe Music Award for Best Video. Proceeds from the video's sales benefited the Natural Resources Defense Council. The following year, Leto directed the short film for \\"Kings and Queens\\" (2009), which features a critical mass movement founded with forward-thinking and eco-conscious intentions, through Los Angeles at night. At the 2010 MTV Video Music Awards, it received four nominations, including Video of the Year and Best Direction, and went on to win Best Rock Video. Leto then filmed \\"Closer to the Edge\\" (2010), a short film featuring tour footage, fan commentary and pictures of Thirty Seconds to Mars from their youth, during the band's Into the Wild Tour. His next project was \\"Hurricane\\" (2010), an experimental short film which explores personal demons and unlocking secret fantasies in what is believed to be a dream. Upon release, \\"Hurricane\\" garnered controversy and was initially censored due to its elements of violence. At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, the short film received three nominations in the categories of Best Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Editing. Leto filmed the 2013 short film for \\"Up in the Air\\" at a now-defunct aerospace manufacturing building in Los Angeles, with appearances from several artists, including burlesque dancer Dita Von Teese, gymnasts McKayla Maroney and Jordyn Wieber, writer Neil Strauss and a number of animals. It garnered several awards, including the MTV Video Music Award for Best Rock Video, and competed at the 2013 Camerimage. He described the concept of his next short film, \\"Do or Die\\" (2013), as a companion piece to \\"Closer to the Edge\\" (2010). It was filmed during the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour and features live footage as well as fan commentary. The same year, Leto directed the critically praised short film for \\"City of Angels\\". Although it is billed as a \\"Bartholomew Cubbins Film\\", \\"City of Angels\\" is the first directorial project directly credited to Leto. He explained, \\"It was the first time I'd ever done that. I'd used several different names, but it was just such a personal thing. I thought it was appropriate to put my name on that piece.\\" The music video features a number of personalities who join the three members of Thirty Seconds to Mars in sharing their visions about Los Angeles. Release A collection of music videos by Thirty Seconds to Mars was officially announced in early April 2015 through the band's official website. Named Bartholomew Cubbins 2006‚Äì2014 from Jared Leto's longtime directorial pseudonym, the video includes all short films directed by Leto from 2006 to 2014. It also features exclusive behind the scenes footage for the music videos of \\"The Kill\\", \\"From Yesterday\\", \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"Hurricane\\". In early 2015, entertainment ticketing company Adventures In Wonderland held special screenings of the collection at select locations around the world. Bartholomew Cubbins 2006‚Äì2014 was announced shortly before completing the Love, Lust, Faith and Dreams Tour. It was made available for pre-order on April 7, 2015, exclusively through the band's official store. The video was released on DVD and Blu-ray formats on April 13, by Sisyphus Corporation, a company through which Jared Leto produced most of the band's music videos with producing partner Emma Ludbrook.

The pranks carried out by members of Trollstation are filmed covertly, often without the permission of those involved; however, they are revealed to be pranks soon after. Some of the group‚Äôs stunts have led to criminal convictions. The channel suddenly attracted particularly high publicity after a coordinated series of pitch invasions during a UEFA Europa League game between Tottenham Hotspur and Partizan Belgrade on 27 November 2014. In March 2016, Trollstation Founder and cameraman 'Digi Dan' was jailed for nine months after being convicted of staging a bomb hoax and mock robberies in London. In May 2016, four other members of Trollstation were jailed for between 16 and 20 weeks after staging a 'terrifying' fake art heist which caused a stampede at the National Portrait Gallery. Five members of \\"Trollstation\\" - some with tights on their heads - burst into the central London art gallery playing a loud alarm and pretended to steal paintings, just a week after the 2015 Sousse attacks. The gallery's visitors fled in apparent panic and one woman passed out, while others were trampled on in the rush before the group moved on to Tate Britain where they carried out a fake robbery and kidnapping, a court was told. As of February 2020, Trollstation has over 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube with 427 million views. On 28 August 2018, they took a break from uploading videos but returned on 17 November 2019. Notable pranks Pranks include a rap battle between two police officers, a child dropping a wallet in front of strangers to see if it is returned, and a blind man dropping his wallet. An extremely long selfie stick was another. Other pranks included 'abusing a transvestite', impersonating traffic wardens and giving tickets to police officers, invading the ring at a WWE SmackDown match, http://news.ameba.jp/20150419-174/ a woman approaching men in public asking for sex and pointing a toy gun at police officers. The video involving Daniel Jarvis handing out parking fines to police, confusing the officers involved, featured on Channel 4's Rude Tube. A temporary 'nightclub' was set up on a London Underground train, with a bouncer, music and promoter. Some members of the public appeared confused and laughed at the situation, whereas others looked disgusted. In another covertly filmed prank, Trollstation created a strip club on the tube. Trollstation set out to observe how people reacted to seeing breastfeeding on a tube train. This was carried out by the 'victim' Amina Maz and the 'verbal abuser' James Slattery. Maz feigned to breastfeed an obscured baby, and Slattery acted as if he was extremely uncomfortable with these actions. Passengers opposite them on the carriage initially said nothing, smiling at the drama of the situation. There were sniggers from passengers when Slattery demanded that Maz move to a different carriage, with one man intervening, telling him he was \\"acting aggressively\\". When Slattery drew the others into the conversation about breastfeeding on the tube, about six people unanimously agreed that Maz had the right to breastfeed in public, and should not be harassed or victimised for doing so. The video became popular on multiple social media sites, including YouTube and Facebook. Most expressed disgust towards James Slattery, especially from non-regular viewers unaware that he was acting in a social experiment. On 27 August 2016, Trollstaion uploaded a video titled 'UK Burkini Ban Social Experiment'. The video involved 2 of the Trollstation members, Amina Maz (pretending to be a Muslim woman, dressed in a burkini) and Endrit Ferizoli aka Light (pretending to be a Police Officer) on Southend on sea beach. The video gained national attention due to the ongoing debate in France over the banning of the 'burkini' on French beaches. The video was covered online by prominent English newspapers such as the Daily Mirror and The Daily Telegraph They were also featured on BBC News and Light and Maz were interviewed by Kay Burley on Sky News. Non-UK pranks The team dropped a wallet 45 times during a visit to Dubai, and it was returned every time. Another prank involved acting drunk in public places, an illegal act in the state. Pitch invasion controversy The White Hart Lane stadium pitch that was invaded during a match. On 27 November 2014, during a UEFA Europa League match between Tottenham Hotspur and Partizan Belgrade, three men encroached the pitch consecutively as part of a publicity stunt, later uploaded to YouTube and named 'Pitch Invasion Prank'. The first man, Nathan Thompson, remained on the field for five minutes, even taking a photograph with Tottenham player Kyle Naughton. Thompson remained on the pitch unchallenged for approximately five minutes before stewards restrained him. Play was resumed by the referee before a second man entered the field of play: Gomes Garcia. Garcia 'lasted' a considerably less amount of time, being captured by stewards more quickly, with Tottenham striker Roberto Soldado actually pulling off the prankster's shirt. On 1 December 2014, Thompson, Garcia and Jarvis were charged with pitch invasion. The court heard that the trio were handing out 'Bass Buds' products outside the stadium as part of a promotional stunt when they allegedly made a \\"spur-of-the-moment\\" decision to encroach the pitch. Tottenham Hotspur themselves were fined just under ¬£12,000 for the incident and all three men were obligated to pay ¬£155 each, as well as facing a ban on attending football games until 2018.  Art Gallery Heist and subsequent arrests  On 5 July 2015, Gomes Garcia, Daniel Jarvis and Ebenezer Mensah staged a prank which involved pretending to steal paintings from the National Portrait Gallery and Tate Gallery. They were adjudged to have caused panic and distress among the visiting public, and the court compared the prank to a 'terrorist incident'. The incident has led all three men, as well as Dan Vahn Lee (DigiDan) and Endrit Ferizolli to serve jail terms ranging from 12‚Äì20 weeks. Jarvis, Ferizolli and Mensah were released in July 2016, Garcia was initially threatened with deportation to his native Portugal but was allowed to remain in the UK after an appeal to the Home Office.

The current headteacher is Darren Glover, who took over in April 2017. The headteacher from January 2011 to August 2014 was John Whittle. It is a foundation school administered by Northumberland County Council, It is claimed to have the largest catchment area of any school in England, reputedly covering an area larger than that encompassed by the M25, the orbital motorway around London. In April 2016, Ofsted judged the school standards as \\"below par\\". Haydon Bridge High School offers GCSEs and BTECs as programmes of study for pupils, while students in the sixth form have the option to study from a range of A-levels and further BTECs. Governance In a report published on 10 December 2014, Ofsted described Haydon Bridge High School as \\"inadequate\\", and placed the school into special measures.https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/provider/23/122328 Reports that followed remained inadequate in reports that were published in 2015 to 2017. In this time, in an attempt to get out of special measures, the school was to be acquired by the Bright Tribe Trust, a multi academy trust, in October 2015. Following this, a new Interim Executive Board (IEB) was brought onto the school, alongside new headteacher Darren Glover. Despite monitoring reports from Ofsted following the acquisition citing improvements were being made, in November 2017, Bright Tribe pulled out of their sponsorship of the school, as revealed in a blog post via Bright Tribe's official website. Bright Tribe cited the school's continued financial deficit, and declining pupil numbers as reasons for the pull out, citing how it would impose financial risks towards the trust and other schools under Bright Tribe's ownership. The school remains under local authority control, with new governors that were appointed by the DfE from April 2018 Description Though the school has a capacity for 900 pupils- in 2020 it had 355. The school is being upgraded by Northumberland County Council, Gradon Architecture, Faithful and Gould and Robertson. Academics The Curriculum The five-year curriculum model requires pupils to engage with a wide range of subjects in Year 7 and 8 and then provides a more bespoke approach through an options programme in Years 9 to 11. ‚Äå =Year 7 and 8= In Year 7 and 8, the schemes of work cover the requirements of the national curriculum and build on prior learning. the Year 7 and 8 curriculum is much more than a means of preparing pupils for Years 9 to 11.,they offer challenge, enjoyment and success. Alongside Mathematics, English, Science, Religious Studies, PSHE and Physical Education, Year 7 and 8 students study a broad range of non-core subjects. Art, Business and Enterprise, Computing, Drama, French, Geography, History, Music and Technology. =Year 9-11= The option process, delivers the statutory national requirements and allows pupils choice and flexibility. They follow examination courses that maximise the opportunity for personal success by providing pathways to post 16 education or employment. All students follow a compulsory core of examination courses in English Language, English Literature, Maths, Biology, Chemistry and Physics. In addition they do non- examined courses in Religious Education, Physical Education and Personal, Social, Health and Economic Education. Together these courses occupy 60% (or 36 out of 60 lessons each fortnight) of the curriculum. Then in year 9 they study French and history/geography for 20% of their time. The remaining 20% (or 12 out of 60 lessons each fortnight) they choose one option subject. They will study four options in total: one in year 9, one in year 10 and two in year 11. The Optional Subjects are: Art and Design (Fine Art or Photography), Business Studies, Computer Science, Child Development, Engineering, Food Preparation and Nutrition, Geography, Health and Social Care, History, ICT, Music, Performing Arts, Physical Education and Religious Studies. An additional lunchtime and after-school enrichment programme includes a range of sporting activities, art, music and drama. Year 12-13 In the small school 6th Form pupils are offered both academic A Levels and Vocational qualifications at Level 3. The Advanced Level subjects offered, (some taught in joint year 12 &13 groups), are: Art and Design (Fine Art, Photography or Textile Design), Biology, Business Studies, Chemistry, Drama and Theatre Studies, English Literature, French, Geography, History, Mathematics, Music, Physical Education, Physics, Religious Studies, Sociology. The Applied and Tech Level courses are: Business, Children‚Äôs Play, Learning and Development, Health and Social Care, Information Technology, Applied General Science.

Feminist Biology, was founded by, among others, Dr. Ruth Bleier of the University of Wisconsin-Madison (who authored the 1984 work ‚ÄúScience and Gender: A Critique of Biology and Its Theories on Women‚Äù and inspired the university‚Äôs endowed fellowship for feminist biology),David, Tenembaum. \\"First in the Nation: UW-Madison Establishes Post-doc in Feminist Biology.\\" University of Wisconsin-Madison News. University of Wisconsin-Madison, 17 Apr. 2014. it aims to enhance biology by incorporating feminist critique in matters varying from the mechanisms of cell biology and sex selection to the assessment of the meaning of words such as ‚Äúgender‚Äù and ‚Äúsex.‚Äù Overall, the field is broadly defined and pertains itself to philosophies behind both biological and feminist practice. These considerations make feminist biology debatable and conflictive with itself, particularly when concerning matters of biological determinism, whereby descriptive sex terms of male and female are intrinsically confining, or extreme post-modernism, whereby the body is viewed more as a social construct.Dominguez, Johnna. \\"A Fine Line: Feminism and Biology.\\" Club Antro: UA Anthropology Blog Network. University of Alabama, 27 Aug. 2012. Web. Despite opinions ranging from determinist to postmodernist, however, biologists, feminists, and feminist biologists of varying labels alike have made claims to the utility of applying feminist ideology to biological practice and procedure. Contributions Donna J. Haraway, a biologist and primatologist hailing from the University of California, put forth male bias criticisms in 1989 concerning the study of human evolution and culture via primatology by denoting a prominent lack of focus in female primates. Haraway contributed to a large discovery of behaviors in primate groups regarding mate selection, and female-female interactions derived from observing female primates, citing feminist influences as she studied the female primates in their own merit. Similarly, feminist cell biologists of The Biology and Gender Study Group have criticized androcentrism in the study of behavior between sexes and ‚Äúcome to look at feminist critique as [they] would any experimental control.‚Äù They cite a general trend of ‚Äúactive‚Äù biological description associated with the sperm gamete and ‚Äúpassive‚Äù description to the ovum, comparing such description to an archetypal hero facing many challenges before it finding its static, female home. The group criticized the diction employed by biological readings and textbooks, stating that the more active and risk-associated traits of the ovum (such as its own survival from the whittling of 2 million oocytes) are dismissed for the sake of a patterned narrative. Anne Fausto-Sterling, a professor of Biology and Gender Studies at Brown University, assesses the complexity of defining sex through a dichotomous lens in a variety of her works such as Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construction of Sexuality as well as in an article piece she wrote titled ‚ÄúThe Five Sexes: Why Male and Female Are Not Enough.‚Äù She addresses the existence of intersex individuals and the lack of acknowledgment of their state of being in the context of a dichotomously defined world of sexes ‚Äì even, if not especially, by medical professionals and surgeons who understand intersex anatomy to a point to where they can surgically alter it to one of the sexes. She states: ‚ÄúIronically, a more sophisticated knowledge of the complexity of sexual systems has led to the repression of such intricacy.‚Äù Fausto-Sterling continues by advocating the reevaluation of what is considered urgent medical intervention in light of the influence she believes social stigma has had on standard medical procedure ‚Äì which in turn could help open up the possible directions that science could take. Motivation The motivations of advocating feminist biology are diverse. One of the most common motivations is to challenge the gender biases originated from science, by discerning a more objective, scientific truth from culturally influenced practices. Many individuals argue the emergence and development of modern science involved the domination of a female world and the exclusion of women. Reductionism, for instance, is a view that all matters in the universe are arranged hierarchically, and that causation only occurs at the lower levels of this hierarchy. A tight link exists between reductive mechanistic science and biological determinism, contributing to the argument that biological causes are the only causes, or the most important cause, of 'feminine' behavior. This link is due to the reductive assumption that causation acts in an upward direction from lower levels of organization to higher levels of organization. Many feminist biologists focus on dispelling such stigmatic prejudices that influential figures have accepted as scientifically true. Controversy There is an ongoing debate on whether a feminist critique should be incorporated in the sciences, especially biology. Some argue that feminist biology is a form of politicization of science, calling to question the legitimacy of feminist biology altogether. On another level, there is debate even within the feminist community on how to deal with biological sex differences. Some account on the importance of accepting biological sex differences to reach gender equality, while others contend that sex differences are overly emphasized in society, contributing to gender stereotypes. Individuals such as Carla Fehr offer constructive criticism for the future of feminist philosophy in the field of biology; she proposes feminist biologists to consider novel questions pertaining to subjects such as the research of genomics in relation to gender.

On her father's side she was descended from George Clinton the younger son of the 6th Earl of Lincoln, within the Clinton family lineage.\\"Mrs. Theodore Sutro Dead,\\" New York Times (April 28, 1906), p. 11. Her mother was Frances Clinton (born Greenwood) (1839‚Äî1869). After her mother's death, her father immigrated with the family to Brooklyn, New York. She showed considerable musical talent as a child. At the age of 13 she won first prize of $1,000 in a contest with 950 other children for her playing of Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2. She attended the Grand Conservatory of New York where she was the first woman to graduate with the degree of Doctor of Music. She married Theodore Sutro (1845‚Äì1927), a lawyer and financier and brother of Otto Sutro and Adolph Sutro, on October 1, 1884. She thus became part of society in both social and intellectual circles, while devoting time to painting and music. \\"As a pianist she excels both in execution and sympathetic touch, while her canvases are welcome features at many of the exhibitions of the National Academy of Design.\\"\\"Sutro, Florence,\\" National Cyclopedia of American Biography (New York: J.T. White, 1892-1984), p. 219a. Encouraged by her husband, she took up the study of law attending women's classes at the City College of New York. Upon graduating in 1891, she was the class valedictorian and delivered the graduation address, \\"Why I Study Law,\\" which labeled her \\"a speaker of wonderful magnetism and clearness.\\" Quoting from the address: \\"Law is beautiful...This great sense of union and order which pervades all life\\" makes the study of law \\"one of the most broadest means possible for attaining to true culture.\\"As quoted in Barbara Allen Babcock, Woman Lawyer: The Trials of Clara Foltz (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 2011), p. 185-187. Although declining to enter the Bar, Sutro authored Women in Music and Law in 1895 which included an extensive list of women composers and their compositions. She devoted her energies to charitable organizations (such as being the vice-president of the New York Kindergarten and Potted-Plant Association). She was involved in the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition festivities in Chicago during which the Infanta Eulalia of Spain visited the United States. Sutro traveled extensively through the United States, and \\"was one of the few women to have visited the Grand Canyon\\" (as stated in an 1893 biographical entry). Theodore and Florence Sutro were active advocates for women's suffrage. \\"The society women of New-York want to vote. Having reached this determination, they have set about accomplishing their desire in the energetic manner characteristic of them on all occasions. Without any particular display of flags or brass bands, they organized themselves for action, and the Constitutional Convention, when it meets May 8 at Albany, will be confronted with the results in no uncertain manner.\\"\\"Society Women Wants Votes,\\" [unidentified newspaper in the Florence Sutro scrapbook], April 11, 1894), p. 1. In the Spring of 1895 she was painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury. According to The New York Times, Mrs. Sutro exhibited the portrait to a group of her friends who admired it at a reception she held at her home on April 13, 1895. It was exhibited at the National Academy of Design, March/April 1896, No. 328, as 'Portrait of Mrs. Theodore Sutro' and listed as lent by the sitter.Maria Naylor (Ed.), National Academy of Design Exhibition Record 1861-1900, Kennedy Galleries, New York, 1973, 2 vols, Vol II, p. 670.

She died of pleurisy and of \\"complication of diseases\\" at her home on 320 West 102nd Street in New York City, and was buried at Woodlawn Cemetery.  National Federation of Women's Music Clubs  One of Florence Sutro's most important contributions was the creation of the National Federation of Women's Music Clubs. In the 1890s she was president of the Woman's Department of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA). In her address to the MTNA of June 25, 1897, she stated that men have not given women the chance to excel in music due to existing prejudice. To remedy that situation she created a Woman's Department\\" of the MTNA. She foretold of a large growth in women active in musical composition and other areas due to the growing opportunities, such as those provided by women's colleges. In her address, she notes the growing numbers of women involved not only in music making but in music research, experimentation, and ethnography. The musical program at the MTNA conference included works by Adele Aus der Ohe, Maude Valerie White, Cecil Chaminade, Celeste D. Heckster, Fanny Spencer, Mrs. Korn, Mrs. Danziger- Rosebault, Laura Sedgwick Collins, Amy Beach, Margaret Ruthven Lang and Amy Fay.Florence Clinton Sutro, \\"Inaugural Address of Mrs. Theodore Sutro, President of Woman's Department, Friday, June 25, 1895, 2 p.m.,\\" Music Teachers' National Association [Chicago, Music Teachers' National Association, 1895]. As a result of her work with the MTNA, Sutro announced the creation of the National Federation of Women's Music Clubs at the conclusion of the MTNA meeting on June 28, 1897, at which 48 clubs were represented. The purpose of the organization was to \\"establish a feeling of fraternity among musical clubs, by frequent correspondence and an annual meeting. But a minor cause for consideration lies in the fact that clubs joining the federation may engage artists together, the benefit of which is mutual to both club and artist.\\"\\"Women's Musical Clubs,\\" Musical Courier (September 29, 1897). Sutro was the temporary chairperson. Sutro was elected temporary head, until elections were to be held at the initial meeting in Chicago in January 1898. Sutro, who had spent months organization a national organization, expected to be elected president. But political infighting led by led by Rose Thomas (wife of conductor Theodore Thomas) and Mrs. Edwin F. Uhl, resulted in the election of Uhl.\\"Mrs. Sutro Beaten,\\" Springfield Daily News (January 27, 1898).\\"Music‚ÄîChicago,\\" Musical Courier (January 29, 1898). Sutro later explained that Thomas and Uhl had tried to form a group for amateur women musicians four year earlier but had failed. Thus it was jealously that led them to unseat Sutro, with no remuneration of the expenses for which she paid out of her own savings. Even though she expressed deep hurt at the way she was treated, Sutro was thankful that there was now a National Federation of Women's Music Clubs.\\"How It All Happened,\\" New York Daily Tribune (February 6, 1898). At the Federation's 1899 meeting Mrs. Uhl was again elected president.\\"Federated Music Clubs,\\" St. Louis Daily Globe-Democrat (May 5, 1899).

It is named for its proximity to General Mitchell International Airport. I-94 is the North‚ÄìSouth Freeway. I-894 is the Airport Freeway. I-41/US 41 travels south and west of the interchange. I-43 travels west and north of the interchange. History The Interchange originally opened in the 1960s. Its original design consisted of seven roadway bridges. In 2009 a complete reconstruction of the interchange began as part of WisDOT's I-94 North-South Reconstruction Program. The reconstruction was completed in November 2012. Several former movements changed after completion. Northbound I-94 to westbound I-894/I-43 changed from a left-hand exit bridge to a right- hand exit tunnel under I-94. Collector-distributor lanes were added along both sides of I-94 from College Avenue to South 13th Street. The movement from eastbound I-894/I-41/I-43 to northbound I-94/I-43 also changed from a left- hand exit to a right-hand exit before Wisconsin Highway 241 (WIS 241). This ramp is also a tunnel under I-94. The reconstruction was named as one of Roads & Bridges magazine's top ten projects of 2012. Reconstruction Contracts for preparation work were awarded in 2009 and 2010. The contract for the interchange itself was awarded in the summer of 2010. The main feature of the new interchange design was three tunnels. All three were build using the cut and cover top down-method. Secant pile drilled shafts were used to build walls into the ground. These walls acted as braces while the area in between them was excavated to form the tunnel. A roof was then built between the walls, making them permanent side walls of the tunnels. In order to maintain traffic flow, the tunnels were built in sections. After completion of a section, a roadway was relocated over it to make space for the next section to be built. Other work on the project included the construction thirteen new bridges and installation of retaining walls. The fast pace of the project required work to be done seven days a week. Features The primary features of the reconstructed interchange are three tunnels. The use of tunnels instead of bridges was chosen because it reduced the height of the interchange, allowed for fewer closures, and reduced the cost of the reconstruction project by $10 million. The tunnels feature an advanced lighting system. The brightness of the lights is adjusted based on the conditions outside to give drivers a smooth transition in and out of the tunnels. There are standpipes to aid in firefighting inside the tunnels. The tunnels measure 585 feet, 744 feet, and 650 feet in length. Designations The control cities at the interchange are Downtown Milwaukee to the north, Chicago to the south and a combination of Beloit, Madison and Fond du Lac to the west. Since I-41 was signed in 2015, it goes north from I-94/US 41 north to I-894 west at Mitchell Interchange, and I-41 south goes from I-43 north/I-894 east to I-94 east; US 41 follows I-41.

It houses over 1700 mixed classification inmates. The prison opened in 2008. The prison is located at 4600 West Swamp Fox Highway. Construction Due to a backlog in counties jails and crowding in other North Carolina state prisons,http://www.doc.state.nc.us/NEWS/cnews/2008/july- aug%2008%20for%20web.pdf the state of North Carolina began construction on Tabor Correctional Institution (TCI) in May 2006 and was completed in April 2008. Backlog refers to the housing of inmates in county jails as the prison system has insufficient space to house the inmates. The state must pay a fee to the counties to house these inmates. \\"After the decision was made to locate the prisons in Tabor City, the town had to fight the battle of paying for the land (and giving the land to the state) and we (Tabor City) had to fight the battle of raising the millions of dollars in grants that it took to service the prisons with water and sewer\\" https://nrcolumbus.com/economic- development/optimistic-town-manager-tabor-city-is-in-the-fight-of-its-life/ The design of Tabor Correctional is the same as six other North Carolina prisons.

The prison is a mixed classification facility, resulting in inmates classified, originally, from medium to maximum control levels being housed within, with minimum custody inmates added in the 2014 addition. The cost to build the prison was approximately $94 million, although the use of inmate labor greatly reduced what this amount would have been if private contractors had been used. . Early in 2014, an addition housing 252 minimum inmates opened, rasing the maximum number of inmates housed at Tabor Prison to 1,752.http://www.fayobserver.com/news/crime_courts/addition-at-tabor-city- prison-open-to-public-tours- saturday/article_2ca5426e-190a-5ea2-af9b-2042c3607bf1.html Operation Before its official opening, the prison was used in various training exercises. Drills included escaped inmates and staff being taken hostage. It cost approximately $28 million to operate this prison each year TCI is maintained by contract maintenance, TKC Management Services. As a part of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety Division of Prisons, it opened in 2008, and housed, as of July 2014, a maximum of 1,752 inmates, providing over 500 jobs to the economically depressed area. The original maximum number of inmates housed at the prison was 1,500. In June 2014, a separate facility was added to the prison complex, housing an additional 252 minimum custody level inmates making it one of the largest prisons in the state. North Carolina Prison guards are paid at the lower end of the national scale, although North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory proposed in April 2015 significant increases in officer pay, although the raise may be partially based on the custody level of the prison. In May 2014 TCI was visited by high ranking Panama officials to review the operation of the prison. The visit was also covered by the Tabor- Loris Tribune.  History  George Kenworthy era (2008-2012) The Tabor City Prison officially opened on August 18, 2008, with George Kemworthy serving as administrator of the prison. Kenworthy had been named as Administrator prior to the prison's opening on June 29, 2007.http://www.doc.state.nc.us/NEWS/2007/releases/George%20Kenworth%20to%20Tabor.htm Inmates were charged with assaulting officers on more than one occasion. Inmates were found guilty of additional charges due to these assaults. During this time. a case of possible exposure of tuberculosis was reported, although later testing proved negative.http://www.corrections.com/news/article/25026 When this possible health issue was reported, Mr. Kenworthy stated, \\"If something of that nature did occur and it was determined that some of our other population was exposed, necessary actions would be taken to provide those inmates with the appropriate testing and/or medical treatment that would ensure their well-being as well as the staff here.\\" Some negative publicity was reported during this period by officers during this period were charged with committing theft,http://www.robesonian.com/view/full_story/6887871/article-2-prison- officers-charged-in-theft?instance=home_news_lead and, in an unrelated case, a different officer was charged with dealing drugs, although not in the prison. Patsy Chavis era (February 22, 2012 - June 30, 2015)  Once Kenworthy, first hired in 1982 as a corrections officer retired after a long career with the North Carolina Department of Corrections, numerous controversies under the new leadership were reported. The new administrator, Patsy Chavis, was appointed to the post on February 22, 2012, despite having no experience as a custody officer in her official NCDPS biography. During this administrator's time, the small annex housing up to 252 minimum security inmates was opened. During the construction of the new addition to the prison, cell phones and marijuana were found during the construction of the addition, apparently in an effort to smuggle the items into the prison. In October 2012, a correctional officer was arrested in the parking lot of Tabor Correction Institute, according to Tabor City Police, and charged with one count of providing tobacco to an inmate and two counts of a sex offense in an institution. As reported by WECT in February 2014, the new Administrator was accused of forcing employees to pay the new Administrator for promotions through an Administrator-designed \\"fundraising\\" campaign. According to WECT, \\"still, an October e-mail sent by Prison Administrator Patsy Chavis to staff reads, \\"We cannot require anyone to pay...however supervisors need to be encouraged to participate... Please let me know if you encounter any resistance or unwillingness to pay.\\". After an internal investigation lasting only a few weeks, the state found no \\"wrongdoing\\" in the fundraising effort, but halted the program, until \\"state prison administrators and auditors can develop formal policy guidelines for employee fundraising activities.\\". Another issue, faced under the new Administrator's term in February 2014, was the death of a 39-year-old inmate, in which an autopsy was needed to determine the cause of death. The cause of death was reported as having been natural causes, however, a WECT report dated July 30, 2015 revealed that the cause of death was \\"methanol toxicity\\" from a concoction of chemicals including hand sanitizer that the inmate drank.http://www.wect.com/story/29671456/state-tight-lipped- about-death-of-inmate-suspected-of-drinking-homemade-brew According to the same news report, the department of public safety conducted an investigation, \\"but the results aren't public record.\\" In September 2014, local news channel WECT discovered that this administrator of the prison had approved using state employees and state vehicles to have fast food delivered to the prison inmates on several occasion. While the inmates paid for the food, state resources were used to deliver these meals. Upon the airing of the story, the Director of the North Carolina Division of Prisons suspended these activities, pending yet another review stating, \\"The Division of Prisons is surveying the activities of all service clubs across the prison system and developing more specific governing policies for these clubs to ensure that they are operating consistently and are providing true rehabilitative benefits.\\" As of September 2014, this employee delivered fast food program remained suspended by the Director of the State Prison System. In late October 2014, according reports from the Raleigh News and Observer in which the maintenance department of the prison head met with Governor Pat McCrory to extend the maintenance contracts beyond their expiration dates. Despite the objections of the NCDPS head Frank Perry, the contracts were renewed. The FBI was conducting an ongoing investigation into the incident as of November 2015.http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article42020100.html WECT reported that in late November 2014 a prison guard was arrested by the FBI for conspiring to rob an armored vehicle. The officer had previously worked for the armored car company and was planning to behead the owners to make the robbery appear to be an act of terrorism. The officer was also planning to break into several houses to obtain weapons for the planned robbery. The officer was indicted by a federal grand jury. Also in November 2014. yet another officer was arrested for providing drugs to the inmates. The officer was arrested by the Tabor City police department.http://www.fayobserver.com/news/crime_courts/tabor-city- correctional-officer-accused-of-giving-drugs-to- inmate/article_74d52d84-a035-51f1-a1ac-c6b5d23e3643.html Soon after, late December 2014, the same news outlet reported that an officer who had been indicted by a grand jury on charges of felony conspiracy to bring contraband into a detention facility, accepting bribes; furnishing controlled substances to inmates; and furnishing tobacco products to inmates was still being allowed to work at the prison by officials, albeit in an \\"appropriately reassigned\\" position. An investigation into the officer was ongoing at the time of the news report, although Department of Corrections Spokesman Keith Acree said \\"Most often when employees are caught doing this and charged, they resign,\\" Acree was unable to say how many employees resigned after being charged with drug offenses, although the news report reference two other recent issues with prison employees. In April 2015, a WECT expose showed why five officers had been terminated and also announced the retirement of Chavez. It revealed that guards at the prison had been fired for unnecessary uses of force against an inmate, an officer having an inappropriate relationship with an inmate, for unsatisfactory job performance and sleeping while on duty, falsification of doctors' notes and being arrested and charged with first degree burglary. It also revealed this administrator submitted a resignation effective June 30, 2015.http://ftpcontent4.worldnow.com/wect/PDFs%20for%20stories/SKMBT_60015022423400.pdf In June 2015, the Tabor-Loris Tribune reported that an officer was being investigated striking a person in the road.http://www.tabor- loris.com/95906/2180/man-laying-in-roadway-killed-by-car During the same month, WECT reported that an officer was charged, while on duty, with stealing over $30,000 in property and cash from an employee at the UNC Hospital's Ambulatory Care Center. The incident resulted in an \\"active shooter\\" announcement being broadcast over the hospital's public address system.http://www.wect.com/story/29251203/tabor-city-correctional-officer- faces-larceny-charges-after-incident-at-unc-medical-facility WECT later reported this officer had been convicted of larceny a year before the prison hired her. According to state law, correctional officers cannot have been convicted of misdemeanors for three years.http://www.wect.com/story/29277974/correctional-officer-was-convicted-a- year-before-prison-hired-her Later in June 2015, a Correctional Sergeant, from the prison was charged with multiple drug related offenses.http://laurinburgexchange.com/news/blotter-news/154118000/3-face- marijuana-charges Because of these charges, the sergeant resigned her position.http://www.wect.com/story/29347407/tabor-correctional-employee- arrested-on-drug-charges In addition, some commentators have included censorship as well as other deprivations as problems under this new leadership.

The governor leads the executive branch of the Lagos State Government. This position places its holder in leadership of the state with command authority over the state affairs. The Governor is frequently described to be the number one citizen of the state. Article II of the Constitution of Nigeria vests the executive power of the state in the governor and charges him with the execution of state law, alongside the responsibility of appointing state executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers subject to the approval of the Assembly members. Powers and duties Legislative role The first power the Constitution confers upon the governor is the veto. The Presentment Clause requires any bill passed by the Lagos State House of Assembly to be presented to the governor before it can become law. Once the legislation has been presented, the governor has three options: # Sign the legislation; the bill then becomes law. # Veto the legislation and return it to the state house of assembly expressing any objections; the bill does not become law, unless the member of the house votes to override the veto by a two-thirds vote. Administrative powers The Governor is made the sole repository of the executive powers of Lagos State, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed. The governor is the head of the executive branch of the state government and is constitutionally obligated to \\"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\\" The governor makes numerous executive branch appointments: commissioners and other state officers, are all appointed by the governor with subject to the approval of the state assembly. The power of the governor to sack executive officials has long been a contentious political issue. Generally, the governor may remove purely executive officials at his discretion. However, the assembly can curtail and constrain a governor's authority to sack commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by statute. The governor additionally possesses the ability to direct much of the executive branch through executive orders that are grounded in Law of the Lagos State or constitutionally granted executive power. Juridical powers The governor also has the power to nominate the chief judge of the state. However, these nominations do require the house of assembly confirmation. Securing house approval can provide a major obstacle for governors who wish to orient the state judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. Governors may also grant pardons and reprieves, as is often done just before the end of a governorship term, not without controversy. Legislative facilitator The Constitution's Ineligibility Clause prevents the governor (and all other executive officers) from simultaneously being a member of the state house of assembly. Therefore, the governor cannot directly introduce legislative proposals for consideration in the house. However, the governor can take an indirect role in shaping legislation, especially if the governor's political party has a majority in the house (house of representative). For example, the governor or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask representatives to introduce these drafts into the house. The governor can further influence the legislative branch through constitutionally mandated, periodic reports to the house. Additionally, the governor may attempt to have the house alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation if the changes he requests are not made. Selection process Eligibility The Governor is directly elected by the people through a registered political party to a four-year term, and is one of only two elected state officers, the other being the Deputy Governor. Chapter six of the 1999 constitution Nigeria as amended sets the requirements to hold the office. A governor must: * be a natural-born citizen of Lagos State * be at least thirty-five years old; * be a member of a register political party and must be sponsored by that political party *Must possess at least, the West Africa School Certificate or its equivalent.

The band members of the Bumpers and the other groups were excommunicated, though the edict would later be rescinded. A proposed tour, which included a performance at Albert Hall, was cancelled, when all of the sponsors and venues pulled out simultaneously. The Ariel company, which had recorded the Mass went bankrupt, and the Bumpers, like the other bands were unable to get gigs even in small Italian towns. The exhibition was released on the Ariel LP, La Messa Dei Giovani (The Mass of the Young), became a cult favorite over the years, and was recently re-issued on Roman Records.

Description Bouvier's red colobus has brownish-red fur on its body that is lighter than its closest relative, the Bioko red colobus (P. pennantii pennantii). Its head has a patch of black to chocolate brown fur that is smaller than that of P. p. pennantii. It has a white chin and whiskers. A black band of fur extends from above the eyes to the temples. The monkey's eyes are surround by large, pink eyerings. The tail of P. bouvieri is long in proportion to its small body and is dark brown at the root, fading to brownish-red at the tip. The fur on the species' underside is lighter than the fur on its back. Bouvier's red colobus is thought to exhibit considerable facial variation from individual to individual, varying from light flesh-colored with blackish cheeks and brows to darker tones throughout the face, excluding the nose and lips. Bouvier's red colobus lives in swampy forests surrounding the Congo River, between the mouths of the Alima and Oubangui Rivers. It does not show fear of humans, making it an easy target for bushmeat hunters. Classification Bouvier's red colobus was first described in 1887 by Alphonse Tr√©meau de Rochebrune in Faune de S√©n√©gambie. For many years it was considered a subspecies of Pennant's colobus and named Procolobus pennantii ssp. bouvieri. In 2007, Colin Groves reclassified it as a distinct species. Groves considers Piliocolobus to be a full genus, while other authors see it as a subgenus of Procolobus, and thus assigned Bouvier's red colobus the scientific name Piliocolobus bouvieri (this nomenclature has been followed here). Status In IUCN's most recent assessment (2008), Bouvier's red colobus was classified as critically endangered with a note saying it was \\"possibly extinct\\". No individuals had been seen in the wild since the 1970s and was thought to have lost at least 80% of its population since then, due to hunting and habitat loss. Possible sightings were reported by F. Petter and F. Vincent in the 2000s, but the sightings were considerably south of the species' previously known range and could not be confirmed. Rediscovery In February 2015, Lieven Devreese of Belgium and Ga√´l Elie Gnondo Gobolo of the Republic of the Congo launched an expedition to search for Bouvier's red colobus. Starting from the town of Owando, the explorers soon spotted the monkey while travelling on the Bokiba River in Ntokou-Pikounda National Park. They announced the find on March 3 via Indiegogo, which together with the Wildlife Conservation Society helped raise funds for the expedition. In April, the explorers revealed the first ever photograph of the species ‚Äì a mother with her infant in a tree.news.nationalgeographic.com 2015-04-18 First-Ever Picture Taken of a Rare African Monkey2015-04-15 Lieven Devreese:Video, World's first photo of monkey thought extinct in Congo, Expedition Map and Photos Bouvier's red colobus was previously known to scientists only from a handful of museum specimens collected between the late 1800s and early 1900s, although the species was known to the people living in the Bokiba River area.

In October 2018, Greuner was sanctioned in court for failing to produce medical records and was cited for negligence by the judge for storing sensitive medical records in the residential garage of a friend , in 2019 is under investigation for fraud, in 2020 sued for unethical and improper practices, among many other legal troubles. Education Greuner graduated from St. George's University School of Medicine. From 2002 until 2005, Greuner was a resident at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center. He was a resident at Atlantic Health System from 2006 until 2009, and his fellowship was at Albert Einstein College of Medicine from 2009 until 2011. He was named chief resident of the year during his post graduate residency training at University of Arizona and Mount Sinai School of Medicine affiliate hospitals. Career Surgeon Greuner works with the Holy Name Medical Center. He is the medical director of Centers for Special Surgery of Essex County. He is also managing director and co-founder of NYC Surgical Associates. Greuner and Dr. David Luu partnered with Adam Tonis of NYC Surgical to found NYClinic.  Lawsuits  In October 2018, Greuner was sanctioned in court for failing to produce medical records for a former patient suing him for fraud, and was cited for negligence by the judge for storing sensitive medical records in the residential garage of a friend . A 2019 case has proceeded to trial by jury involving the over-prescription of opioids. This case involves alleged fraudulent acts by Dr. Greuner, whereby Dr. Greuner allegedly prescribed, sold, and administered hundreds of injectable opioids (e.g., Demerol) to the Plaintiff, allegedly in exchange for cash, checks, credit cards, jewelry, first-class plane ticket upgrades, joy rides in Plaintiff‚Äôs car to the Hamptons, clothing, and designer handbags, under the guise of ‚Äúmedical treatment.‚Äù Dr. Greuner also allegedly sent his girlfriend, whom he allegedly represented was a registered nurse when she was not, to deliver the injectibles when it became too inconvenient for Dr. Gruener to do so. Plaintiff has sued Dr. Greuner for fraud, seeking damages, including punitive damages for his alleged misconduct. As of 2020, he has multiple pending litigations against him including a former employee who contends that while working for Greuner, he witnessed many improper policies and practices. Plaintiff alleges that NYC Surgical would offer vouchers on Groupon or LivingSocial for spider vein treatment with the intention of convincing these new patients to undergo additional and medically unnecessary procedures that could be billed to insurance providers. Plaintiff contends that Greuner pushed these additional procedures because the traditional treatment for spider veins is considered cosmetic and is not usually covered by insurance. Plaintiff refused to participate in this scheme and was fired for failing to engage in these allegedly improper practices. Work with Telangiectasia and Lipedema The Dr. Oz Show featured Greuner in October 2013 to talk about Telangiectasia and how to treat it. He also spoke about vein disease in the June 2016 edition of 25a Magazine. Greuner uses a liposuction like procedure which removes dysfunctional fat cells using only a small incision in the leg, and has started a national public awareness campaign on lipedema treatment. His expertise in treating lipedema received international attention after a procedure profile in Daily Mail. He has developed the No-Knife Endovenous Laser Ablation. His procedure does not use the plastic sheath that was used before which leaves scars. The process uses a laser that is focused through a skinny needle to seal problems in veins. Work with Fibroid embolization and Pelvic congestion David Greuner has been active in helping develop fibroid embolization, an approach involving a thin catheter threaded right to the blood vessels feeding the fibroids. This process eventually extracts enough blood from the fibroid that it shrinks it. Greuner's approach involves inserting the catheter through a small artery in the wrist. Greuner is also involved in developing treatments for Pelvic congestion syndrome, a condition in which varicose veins develop around the ovaries. Press Publishings Greuner contributes to various media outlets where he discusses health topics including nutrition, stress, skin care, exercise, and other health issues. He has contributed to various journals and magazines including Readers Digest, Men's health, Murielle magazine, NY Post, Z!nk magazine, The Daily Meal, and various others. Philanthropy Greuner works with the Paris non-profit The Heart Fund, and worked with the Fund to support the Generous People Gala in Cannes. He has partnered with Dr. David Luu, CEO of The Heart Fund, to treat one patient in a developing country for every patient seen in the United States. Greuner is on the benefit committee of Share Benefit, an annual event which raises funds to aid those affected by breast and ovarian cancer. Recognitions Greuner has been featured on the television shows, The Doctors, and Live From The Couch. The Doctors produced a calendar of \\"The Most Beautiful Doctors in America,\\" in 2013, which was sold to benefit the American Red Cross Association. In 2014, Greuner was featured on the Long Island Pulse list of top doctors.

Nikola Spasiƒá (; 2 November 1838 in Belgrade ‚Äì 28 November 1916 in Corfu) was a Serbian businessman, benefactor, humanitarian, and one of the leaders of the Serbian Chetnik Organization in Old Serbia and Macedonia. He was the president of the Board of Directors of the Belgrade Exchange in 1903 and the initiator-founder-builder of the Nikola Spasiƒá Endowment Building in Belgrade. He also initiated and financed the construction of four major edifices in Knez Mihailova Street, the third of which, built immediately proceeding the First Balkan War, was the Grand Passage, designed by Nikola Nestoroviƒá.\\"–¢—Ä–µ—õ–∏ —Å–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä —É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ - —Å—Ç–∞—ö–µ –∏ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–µ‚Äú —É: –ù–µ–ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–∏—Ç–Ω–∏ —Å–µ–∫—Ç–æ—Ä —É –°—Ä–±–∏—ò–∏ –∏ –¶—Ä–Ω–æ—ò –ì–æ—Ä–∏, –ë–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞–¥, 2002. Biography Nikola Spasiƒá was the descendant of a Serbian family, which, \\"desperately poor\\", moved to Belgrade from the countryside during the 1804-1813 First Serbian Uprising against the Ottoman Empire. Spasiƒá trained for 15 years as an artisan and merchant before opening, with his brother, the first leather workshop and store in 1865. The shop manufactured and vended opanci (Opanak), Balkan peasant footwear similar to the moccasin; this light, leather footwear was widely accepted as part of the Serbian national costume and was worn in the 19th century both in the city and the village. By the time of the Kingdom of Serbia acquired full independence in 1878, Nikola Spasiƒá was sufficiently rich to completely withdraw from the business. The value of the property that the Endowment of Nikola Spasiƒá had at its disposal following his death was close to that of the Nobel Foundation. Throughout his career, Spasiƒá maintained a consistent professional attitude: he ran his business in the same way over the years and had an unwavering relation to his clients, which was reflected in his persistent, frugal, diligent self-control and modesty. This, coupled with his humanitarian work, would be how he would be remembered in the city of Belgrade. At the same time, for the architectural design of his buildings, Spasiƒá always selected the best Serbian architects, his buildings featured the latest technical devices, the construction material of the highest quality, with the entire building inventory procured from European centres. Nikola Spasiƒá's will and last testament, drawn up in 1912, expressly forbade the sale of any of his Belgrade buildings. Rather, it called for their exploitation in order to raise funds and therefore finance all the undertakings of the Endowment of Nikola Spasiƒá. The main goal of the endowment set by Spasiƒá was the economic development of the nation. For Nikola Spasiƒá, the capable entrepreneur, the promise of architecture was a dream he pursued to the end. Just a few days before his death on the island of Corfu, where he arrived as a war refugee, Spasiƒá revealed in a letter, his hope that he would return one day to liberated Belgrade, accompanied by Viennese architect Konstantin Jovanoviƒá, who he planned to engage to design new remarkable edifices.

Densmore (1849 ‚Äì November 13, 1892) was an American civil servant who served as a Doorkeeper to the President of the United States from 1885 to 1887, and as Chief Usher of the White House in Washington, D.C., briefly in 1887 and again from March 1889 until his death in November 1892. Early life and police career Edson S. Densmore was born about 1849 in Chelsea, Vermont, to William and Lydia A. Densmore. His father was a farmer, and he had at least two siblings: Milton (born in 1840) and Jason (born in 1846). Some time before 1860, his mother went insane, and Densmore ran away from home in 1861 to live with Chelsea residents Franklin and Sylvia Dearborn, their teenage daughter, and Dearborn's aged mother. His schooling was minimal. By 1870, Densmore was living in Washington, D.C., where he worked as a carpenter and had married Emma A. Roberts.; Their union produced two daughters, Annie and Elsie. In 1872, he joined the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia (MPD). Tall, handsome, muscular, and intelligent, Densmore was often the point-man the D.C. police turned to for their most difficult cases. President Ulysses S. Grant specifically asked the MPD to assign Densmore to break up the District of Columbia's gambling dens on E Street NW. After his successes there, the MPD promoted him to sergeant. He was then assigned to the Willard Hotel and asked to break up a gang of gentlemen thieves who broke into wealthy people's rooms and stole money and jewels. Densmore ingratiated himself with the thieves, and broke the robbery ring. His incredible ability to remember faces and names proved critical in convicting the criminals. Offered a promotion to lieutenant, Densmore turned it down as he wanted to keep working on city streets rather than supervising others. White House Usher Having been assigned to guard the White House several times during the presidency of Rutherford B. Hayes, Densmore resigned from the MPD on March 11, 1885, and joined the White House staff as a doorkeeper. Two years later, he was promoted to usher. It is likely that he was given the role of chief usher immediately. Although the role of usher had once only been to escort people from the entrance to the President, by 1887 it had become much more: \\"[Densmore] was the medium between the president and the hundreds who came by to see him, and had entire control the house. His rare gifts of insight into men and their motives, as well as his tact and discretion, rendered him invaluable for the performance of the delicate and responsible duties of his position, and he enjoyed the confidence and personal friendship of some of the most distinguished men in the country.\\" Densmore's marriage was a troubled one, and he divorced his wife in 1886. At the time, divorce was difficult to obtain short of proving adultery or violence. Densmore won his divorce by claiming that his wife had no interest in maintaining a home, smoked cigars and used chewing tobacco, was cruel and temperamental, and failed to care for him during a serious illness. Densmore sued for divorce in mid-July 1886, which was granted in December. Emma Densmore was awarded custody of their children, but Edson sued‚Äîarguing that his wife was an unfit mother and that his eldest daughter was forced to work in a photography shop by her mother. The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia denied his petition in October 1888, strongly condemning the award of divorce in dicta. For reasons of ill health, Densmore resigned as White House usher in late July 1887. His successor was \\"Colonel\\" John McKenna. Sources differ on where Densmore lived and what he did for employment for the next two years. The Washington Post claimed he worked for a travel agency in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. But his home town newspaper said he went to work for Simonda Rolling-Machine Company in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and lived at the Fitchburg Hotel. (The New York Times also reported that he returned to Fitchburg.) Densmore was asked to rejoin the White House in February 1889 in order to oversee preparations for the inauguration of President-elect Benjamin Harrison. President Harrison asked Densmore to stay on as chief usher on his very first day in office. Densmore agreed, and according to the Fitchburg Sentinel he was the first official of the Harrison administration to be sworn in. Unfortunately, ill health soon ended Densmore's tenure as chief usher. He suffered from Bright's disease, and fell seriously ill in May 1892. He gave up his White House duties temporarily, and traveled to Fitchburg, Massachusetts, and Lebanon, New Hampshire, to recuperate with friends and family. He recovered occasionally over the next five months, but fell ill again shortly after each recovery. At the end of October 1892, Densmore fell so ill that his friends feared for his life. Death Edson S. Densmore died of Bright's disease on November 13, 1892. He was survived by his daughters Annie and Elsie, his brother Jason Jason was by his side at the deathbed. Densmore was a member of Foundry Methodist Episcopal Church (now Foundry United Methodist Church). His funeral, held at the church, was attended by numerous members of Congress and representatives from the White House staff. Densmore was interred at Glenwood Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

At a House Intelligence Committee hearing in June 2019 and at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing in October 2019, Citron proposed to condition section 230 protection on \\"reasonable\\" content moderation practices, an idea which the Electronic Frontier Foundation called \\"terrifying\\", arguing it would lead to excessive litigation risks especially for small businesses. On the other hand, Citron has expressed partial agreement with critics of the 2018 FOSTA act, in particular with regard to uncertainties resulting from the law's \\"knowing facilitation\\" standard.

History W. H. Bennett was born in Kapunda to Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Bennett, who moved to Petersburg, as Peterborough was then named, when he was six months old. He was educated at the Sisters of St. Joseph School (later named St. Anacletus' Hall), and followed his brother James J. Bennett (c. 1873 ‚Äì 7 March 1900) in the printing trade with R. M. Osborne at the Petersburg Times in 1894. In September 1899 he was sent to Quorn to manage the Quorn Mercury, which he turned into a prosperous business. In 1908 he purchased the business from Osborne, and almost immediately had a tremendous setback in the destruction of the Peterborough printery by fire. But he persevered and built the business, with the Booleroo Magnet and the purchase of the Orroroo Enterprise from Colonel Tom Hancock and the Weekly Times of Adelaide. He kept himself aware of improvements in printing technology and always had equipment of the most up to date design appropriate to his business. He was brought up in a good Catholic family. He served as an altar-boy and as an assistant to Father (later Bishop) Norton. He was vice-president of the local Holy Name Society and for many years member of the Hibernian Australian Catholic Benefit Society. He was also highly respected by those of other faiths; high tributes from leaders of many other churches were published after his death. He was a keen tennis player and an ardent racegoer; he gave unstinting support in his newspapers to coverage of local sport, and was particularly helpful in helping establish baseball and lawn bowls into Peterborough. He was one of the founding members of the S.A. Provincial Press Association and a director almost from its inception. He served as Justice of the Peace and was a shareholder in the Co-operative Society for twenty-four years. He died, some said of overwork, after some months of increasingly poor health and a stroke, in a private hospital in Glenelg. His body was brought back to Peterborough, and his funeral cortege was a mile long.

The law was enacted three years after Executive Chairman of the World Zionist Organization and Head of the Jewish Agency for Palestine, David Ben-Gurion, issued Israel‚Äôs Declaration of Independence, which promised ‚Äúcomplete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants, irrespective of religion, race, or sex.‚Äù Since its inception, the Women‚Äôs Equal Rights Law, 5711-1951 has been met with both praise and criticism.  Full Text  English Version of Law: #A man and woman shall have equal status with regard to any legal proceeding; any provision of the law which discriminates, with regard to any legal proceeding, against women and women, shall be of no effect. # A married woman shall be fully competent to own and deal with property as if she were unmarried; her rights in property acquired to before marriage shall not be affected by her marriage. # (a) Both parents are the natural guardians of their children; where one parent dies, the survivor shall be the natural guardian. (b) The Provisions of subsection (a) shall not derogate from the power of a competent court or tribunal to deal with matters of guardianship over the persons or property of children with the interest of the children as the sole consideration. # (a) Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, rights in an estate, being mulk land or movable property, shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Second Schedule or to the Succession Ordinance. (b) The provisions of subsection (a) shall apply to any estate the order for the distribution of which is made after the coming into force of this Law, even if the deceased died before such coming into force. (c) The provisions of subsection (a) do not apply to such items of an estate as are disposed of by will. # This Law shall show affect any legal prohibition or permission relating to marriage or divorce. # This Law shall not derogate from any provision of law protecting women as women. # All courts shall act in accordance with this Law; a tribunal competent to deal with matters of personal status shall likewise act in accordance therewith, unless all the parties are eighteen years of age or over and have consented before the tribunal, of their own free will, to have their case tried according to the laws of their community. # The Criminal Code Ordinance, 1936, shall be amended as follows: (a) Paragraph (c) of the proviso to section 181 is repealed; (b) the following section shall be inserted after 181: 181A. Where the husband dissolves the marriage against the will of the wife without a judgement of a competent court or tribunal ordering the wife to dissolve the marriage, the husband is guilty of a felony and shall be liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years. # The Minister of Justice is charged with the implementation of this Law. David Ben-Gurion, Prime Minister Pinchas Rosen, Minister of Justice Chaim Weizmann, President of the State FULL TEXT  Reception   Praise  Former Senior Deputy State Attorney for the Israeli Ministry of Justice Plea Albeck heralds the law for ensuring ‚Äúmost rights are enjoyed equally by men and women‚Äù and states ‚Äúspecial provisions relating to women, for the most part, are regarded as benefits rather than disadvantages.‚Äù These ‚Äúspecial provisions‚Äù grant women a ‚Äúprivileged status,‚Äù and include things such as women serve a shorter military service than men and mothers and pregnant women are exempt from service completely; married women are allowed to own and maintain property as if they were unmarried and their spouses have no claim to any profit from this property; and women are allowed to use contraceptives and seek a medical abortion without the consent of her husband. These examples of legal privileges for women are cited as positive outcomes of the Women‚Äôs Equal Rights Law. Albeck further explains in her 1972 article, ‚ÄúThe Status of Women in Israel,‚Äù that the law is intended to both (1) ensure women share the same rights as men and (2) to preserve the special rights and privileges granted to women.  Criticism  While supporters of the law champion its provisions for ensuring special privileges for women, this section also garners criticism, as many aspects of ‚Äúprivileged status‚Äù come from religious law. Frances Raday, the currently head of the Concord Institute for the Study of the Absorption of International Law in Israel, explains ‚Äúone of the main reasons for the demotion of the principle of equality in the Israeli legal system is deference to religious values.‚Äù The State of Israel identifies as a state that is both Jewish and Democratic, yet often finds its religious and political values at odds. Much of the criticism for the Women‚Äôs Equal Rights Law stems from the debate over religious versus secular democratic values. Pnina Lahav, researcher and professor of law at Boston University, criticizes the law for both the ‚Äúmaintenance of religious jurisdiction over matters of marriage and divorce and the legitimation of a privileged status for women.‚Äù Criticism for the law largely stems from the notion that rather than foster true sex equality, the law‚Äôs declaration of a ‚Äúprivileged status‚Äù delineates women as ‚Äúseparate but equal.‚Äù Although people from across the religious and political spectrum applaud the law for guaranteeing a separate status for women, critics argue that this separate status undermines female equality. The term ‚Äúequal‚Äù as used is not understood the same as the term ‚Äúequal‚Äù would be in the American sense of the word. The Israeli use of the term equal implies, according to feminist intellectual Catherine MacKinnon, the ‚ÄúAristotelian notion that equality entails the treatment of likes alike and un-likes differently in accordance with their unlikeness‚Äù. This interpretation of equality influences Israeli policy on gender equality and enabled the restrictive laws prohibiting women from entering combat positions in the Israeli Defense Forces. This \\"separate but equal\\" ideology also influenced Israel to create the Women's Corps Women's Affairs advisor as a separate unit. Legacy Israeli Law 5711-1951 has had a lasting legacy on the state of gender equality in Israel and Palestine. It has been revised once in 2000 updating much of the language and giving greater legal authority to the law. Halakha law remains the most difficult of equality issues to navigate today in Israel, even with the updated law 5711-1951. There is no civic marriage in Israel it must be done through the religious courts (Halakha, and Sharia law). However, in 2006 Gay Marriages done abroad were recognized as fit to be registered with the Official Registry in Israel, making what basically constitutes a \\"common law\\" marriage. Halima Brai v Qadi of the Sharia Muslim Court In 1955, widowed mother of three Halima Bria, got remarried. Under Sharia Law (which she was married under and in Israel has legal authority in civil cases) a women with children who remarried was no longer seen in Israeli legal terms as the \\"natural guardian\\" for her very own children. She was brought to trial by her sister-in-law who was attempting to remove Halima's children from her custody. The only way in which Israeli law can trump a ruling by the religious courts (Islamic, Jewish, or Christian) is if the religious court \\"intentionally\\" ignored Law 5711-1951. The Israeli High Court did not side with Halima Bria and her children were removed from her custody. This case was important because it set the legal standard of allowing the various religious courts to have what amounts to near full autonomy in their rulings. This separation of civil and criminal law still is a huge obstacle for those fighting for gender equality in Israel. Steinberg v Attorney General In 1951 shortly after 5711-1951 passed in the Knesset Israel's first sex discrimination case was brought to the High Court of Justice. In this case Haim Steinberg, who was part of the Haredi Jewish sect called Neturey-Karta, refused to serve in the new Israeli Defense Forces. His argument was that if he was a women of the Neturey-Karta sect he would be given a religious deferment, but because he was a man he was being denied that \\"right\\". The court rejected his appeal not because he was a man but on the grounds that his sect did not recognize the state of Israel as being legitimate or having any legal authority. This set important legal precedent for future cases of gender discrimination in the armed forces. It also put into layman's terms the Israel policy of favoring men in their military over women. Israel had/has many loopholes and ways for a women not wishing to serve to take; few such avenues are available for men in Israel. 1986 Defense Service Law This law, later amended in 1999, allows all women access to any position in the Defense Forces that they qualify for. Though the law stipulates that both men and women must perform military service for their country, it is still far easier for a women to be exempted then it is for a man. Women can still be exempted for their own religious or conscientious reasons. They are then supposed to substitute military service for \\"national service\\" for their required two years, although this seems to be rarely implemented. Men are subjected to the IDF's discretion if they are allowed to be exempted or not. The only exception being those studying to be rabbis at the country's various yeshivas. These of course are male only and yet another source for dissatisfaction among those demanding gender equality in Israel.

It was originally named in 1923 by Karel Domin as a subspecies Melaleuca densa var. pritzelii but raised to species status in 1992. It is a rare species, known only from a few plants in each of a small number of populations. Description Melaleuca pritzelii is a shrub which grows to about tall with rough grey bark. The plant is glabrous except for the new growth when it first appears covered with matted hairs. Its leaves are usually arranged in opposite pairs at right angles to the pairs above and below (decussate) so that there are four rows of leaves along the branchlets. The leaves are long and wide, concave and egg-shaped tapering to a pointed end. The flowers are cream coloured, arranged in heads on old wood or sometimes on the ends of branches and contain 4 to 14 individual flowers. The heads are up to wide. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flower, each bundle containing 2 to 4 stamens. The flowering season is mainly early spring and is followed by the fruit which are cup-shaped woody or papery capsules long and about in diameter in clusters. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca pritzelii was first formally described in 1923 as Melaleuca densa var. pritzelii by Karel Domin but raised to species status in 1992 by Frances Quinn, Kirsten Cowley, Lyndley Craven and Bryan Barlow in Nuytsia, noting that the species is probably not closely related to Melaleuca densa. The specific epithet (pritzelii) honours Ernst Georg Pritzel, who collected the specimen described by Domin. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca pritzelii is confined a few small populations in the Gnowangerup, Stirling Range and Bremer Bay districts in the Avon Wheatbelt, Esperance Plains, Jarrah Forest and Mallee biogeographic regions where it grows in sandy or clayey soils in swampy areas.

The game is set within the same universe as Spiders' previously developed game, Mars: War Logs. Olivier Deriviere scored The Technomancer. Plot The game is set during the War of Water, 200 years after humans colonized Mars. The protagonist is a rookie technomancer named Zachariah from Abundance, one of the powerful corporations on the red planet, who is on the run from the secret police. Zachariah flees the city of Ophir and heads to the town of Noctis which is nearby. He then attempts to find a beacon to establish contact with Earth.http://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps4/the_technomancer Gameplay There are three styles of combat. The player can add companions to their party, who can then level up. The player will also be able to improve their own combat abilities, and they can make different choices about how to solve each quest. There are three different endings, and each is slightly modified by several major choices the player makes throughout the game. The player can craft their weapons and armor. There are four different skill trees. Development The game was first announced on April 10, 2015. Spiders wrote an open letter to PlayStation Blog accompanied by a new trailer for the game. A 13-minute gameplay video was released on August 7, 2015, and another five- minute video was released on June 21, 2015. In an April interview, CEO Jehanne Rousseau explained that \\"Mars is a lot bigger in The Technomancer compared to what you saw in Mars: War Logs.\\" There will be several hubs and cities that can be unlocked. Rousseau estimated the main quest to be around 25 to 30 hours of play and \\"easily extended to around 50 hours with the inclusion of side quests.\\" Overall there are around 4 times as many quests as there were in Bound by Flame. In a second interview when asked about the possibility of DLC, Rousseau stated that the game would be a complete and finished product, and although they do not currently have plans for additional content after launch, Spiders \\"may consider it at a later date.\\" According to Spiders CEO and Creative Director, Jeanne Rousseau, the game is their largest and most expansive to date. Reception The Technomancer received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game was criticized for its uncanny valley character models and stiff animation, as well as monotone voice acting and flimsy combat. The inability to properly utilize your technomancy skills against enemies due to \\"electricity proof\\" armor was pointed out as another huge blunder on the game's part. The game was, however, praised for its beautiful environments, world building and story. IGN stated the game \\"has all the moving parts of a mid-2000s BioWare game but lacks technical polish and storytelling finesse to a sometimes painful degree.\\" Combat was heavily criticized for its lack of \\"flow or rhythm\\" and absurd difficulty - not in \\"the Dark Souls sense, where you learn to iterate and get better with each death\\" instead it‚Äôs \\"random, tiresome, and annoying, no matter how much time or how many stat points you invest.\\" They did praise some aspects of the game however saying \\"the Martian setting and background and the environments used to introduce you to them are definitely the high points of this journey. From the monolithic, utilitarian metropolis of Ophir to the vibrant, rugged, Arabian Nights-esque merchant city of Noctis, the distinct cultural styles and small, convincing details really do a hell of a job bringing Mars to life.\\" References External links * 2016 video games Dystopian video games Mars in fiction PlayStation 4 games Science fantasy video games Action role-playing video games Science fiction video games Video games developed in France Video game sequels Video games set on Mars Windows games Xbox One games PhyreEngine games Single-player video games Focus Home Interactive games Cyberpunk video games ","title":"The Technomancer"},{"id":"46440750","text":"Tullycarnan (Ardglass) () is a townland of 154 acres in County Down, Northern Ireland.

Avraham Shifrin was one of the world‚Äôs top authorities on the Soviet system of prisons and slave labor camps. Shifrin's testimonies before Internal Security Subcommittee of the Senate and other congressional committee (House Banking and Currency Committee, 1973), provided the world with the major listing of Soviet slave labor camps. Biography Avraham Shifrin was born on October 8, 1923 in Minsk, USSR (modern Belarus) into a Jewish family. His father, Isaak Shifrin, was arrested in 1937, sentenced under false charges to ten years of corrective labor in Kolyma. During World War II, Avraham Shifrin fought in Shtrafbat, Soviet penal battalion, where he was drafted as a son of the Enemy of the people (Russian language: —Å—ã–Ω –≤—Ä–∞–≥–∞ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–∞, \\"syn vraga naroda\\"). Within days, ninety percent of his unit was dead or wounded and Shifrin had been wounded twice. Participated in the Battle of K√∂nigsberg, was awarded the Medal \\"For the Capture of K√∂nigsberg\\". As a lawyer, in 1949‚Äì1953, he worked for the Soviet Ministry of Defense and at the same time actively participated in the Zionist movement. In 1953 was falsely accused in spying for the US and Israel and sentenced to death. Later, the death sentence was changed to twenty five years in Gulag, five years of exile to remote regions, and five years of revoking civil rights. In 1963 Shifrin was released from prison; in 1970 repatriated to Israel. Shifrin testified before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in 1973 that American prisoners of war were being held in Soviet prison camps. According to Arnold Beizer, a Hartford lawyer, the testimony was corroborated by Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1992, who said American soldiers had been transferred to Russian labor camps. Russian Gulag on Wrangell Island According to Avraham Shifrin's research, massive Russian Gulag concentration camp has been found on the Russian Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean (71¬∞ North, 179¬∞ West). The camps on Wrangell were revealed in the 1982 book \\"The First Guidebook to Prisons and Concentration Camps of the Soviet Union,\\" by Avraham Shifrin (Bantam Books). His research institute interviewed hundreds of escapees from Soviet gulags. In his 1973 testimony before the U. S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, Shifrin described three concentration camps with thousands of prisoners, and in one camp was an atomic reactor used in radiation experiments on live prisoners. American prisoners of war may have been on Wrangell. The Russians are reputed to have taken American and other military prisoners from World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War to Siberian slave labor camps. Even the famed World War II hero Raoul Wallenberg (who was declared an honorary U. S. citizen along with Winston Churchill) was seen in a camp on Wrangell Island in 1962, according to testimony of imprisoned Soviet SMERSH officer Efim Moshinskiy in Shifrin‚Äôs book Korean Air Lines Flight 007 alternative theory Avraham Shifrin claimed that according to the investigation of his Research Centre for Prisons, Psychprisons and Forced Labor Concentration Camps of the USSR, KAL 007 landed on water north of Moneron Island, and the passengers successfully disembarked on emergency floats. The Soviets collected them and subsequently sent them to camps with the children \\"separated from their parents and safely hidden in the orphan houses of one of the Soviet Middle Asian republics\\". According to Michel Brun this theory is not entirely preposterous. In his book he analyses the first news, communicated by CIA and South Korean government: that KAL 007 landed in Sakalin and all passengers are safe. In his careful searches, he discovered the source of this first information. It was published in a Japanese newspaper: Mainichi Shinboun September 1, 1983.Michel Brun,Incident at Sakhline... p. 20 According to him, this observation came from Wakkanai radars. So, he considers that another aircraft, probably military, landed at Sakhalin during the \\"Sakhalin battle\\" and that its passengers, American and/or South Korean, were jailed in the Soviet Union.

Painting by Josef Hickel, 1773. Karl Maximilian, Prince of Dietrichstein (Karl Maximilian Philipp Franz Xaver; 28 April 1702 ‚Äì 24 October 1784), was a German prince member of the House of Dietrichstein, 6th Prince (F√ºrst) of Dietrichstein zu Nikolsburg, Princely Count (gef√ºrsteter Graf) of Tarasp, Baron (Freiherr) of Hollenburg, Finkenstein and Thalberg. Born in Brno, he was the eighth child and third (but eldest surviving) son of Walther Franz Xaver Anton, 5th Prince of Dietrichstein, by his second wife, Countess Karolina Maximiliana Pruskovsky von Proskau. Life Being the third son of his family, Karl Maximilian was destined since birth to an ecclesiastical career; for this, he enjoyed a good education from private tutors and took the customary Grand Tour through Europe. The early deaths of his older brothers Karl Franz (1703) and Johann Joseph (1709) left Karl Maximilian as the eldest surviving son and heir of his father. In addition to the title of 6th Prince of Dietrichstein and Imperial Count of Tarasp, who Karl Maximilian inherited after his father's death in 1738, he was the owner of extended estates, including Nikolsburg, Hollenburg, Finkenstein, Thalberg, Kanitz, Leipnik (Lipn√≠k nad Beƒçvou), Weisskirch, Nu√üdorf ob der Traisen (with the including districts of Reichersdorf and Franzhausen), Libochovice, Budynƒõ nad Oh≈ô√≠, P√°tek, Nepomy≈°l and Vlachovo B≈ôez√≠. At the same time, Karl Maximilian held a number of court positions. He was an Imperial K√§mmerer, Oberst-Erblandmundschenk in the Duchy of Carinthia, and in 1783 after the death of his kinsman Count Dismas Joseph of Dietrichstein (from the Weichselst√§dt branch), he became in senior Colonerl of his house, Oberst-Hofmeister and Obersterbland-J√§germeister in the Duchy of Styria.Franz Karl Wi√ügrill: Schauplatz des lands√§ssigen nieder√∂sterreichischen Adels, vol. 2, p. 253. Karl Maximilian participated in the Aulic Council and later was a member of the Imperial Privy Council, which led him a significant influence on the government business in the Holy Roman Empire, especially in the difficult times following the decision of Emperor Charles VI, who without surviving sons, named his daughter Maria Theresa heiress of the Habsburg domains in the Pragmatic Sanction. Later, during the first years of rule of Maria Theresa, Karl Maximilian was one of his advisors. During 1745-1754 he served as Oberst-Hofmarschall of Emperor Francis I, Maria Theresa's husband.Roman Freiherr von Proch√°zka: B√∂hmische Adelsfamilien. Verlag Degener & Co, Neustadt a. d.

In 1754 Karl Maximilian resigned to his position as Oberst-Hofmarschall, in order to devote himself to the administration of his vast estates. On the basis of the testament of his maternal grandfather, Count George Christoph Pruskovsky of Proskau, after the death of his cousin without issue on 29 July 1769,Constantin von Wurzbach: Biographisches Lexikon des Kaiserthums Oesterreich, p. 297 Karl Maximilian inherited the title, coats of arms and possessions of the Counts of Proskau, including the districts of Proskau (pl: Pr√≥szk√≥w; a city in Upper Silesia located in the Opole County, Opole Voivodeship in southwestern Poland) and Klein Strehlitz (pl: Strzeleczki) and a vast monetary Fideikommiss; however, shortly after he granted the title of Count of Proskau (with his respective coats of arms and lands) to his eldest son. In later 1781, due to illness and fatigue, Karl Maximilian resigned the government of the rest of his domains to his son, although he retained the title of Prince until his death.Karel Maxmili√°n ‚Äì 5. kn√≠≈æe Dietrichstein, hrabƒõ Proskau in: rmm.cz [retrieved 21 April 2015]. During his 46 years of reign, Karl Maximilian expanded his domains substantially, acquiring, among others, the Lordships of ≈Ωidlochovice, Velk√© Nƒõmƒçice and Cvrƒçovice. On 14 September 1784 a fire broke out in Nikolsburg, destroying more than 250 homes, the entire northeastern part of the city, the Capuchin monastery and Loretan church. In the fire much of the treasure accumulated over centuries in the Loretan church was lost. The reports of the extent of damage overwhelmed the old prince, who died one month later aged 82. He was buried in the family crypt.

Named after Saint Roch, the brotherhood was founded in 1705 by the Franciscan tertiary Jonas Jarolaviƒçius in Vilnius. During its existence, the brotherhood maintained primitive hospitals and shelters () for the sick and the disabled in five locations: Vilnius (1708‚Äì1799), Kƒôstaiƒçiai (1738‚Äì1842), Varniai (1743‚Äì1842), Kaunas (1750‚Äì1824), and Minsk (1752‚Äì1821).Jakulis (2010), p. 95 It is not known whether the brothers had any kind of medical education. It is known that they hired paramedics, doctors, and surgeons, including women nurses who could take care of their female patients.Jakulis (2010), p. 75 A significant number of the patients in Vilnius and Kaunas had sexually transmitted diseases; other Catholic hospitals refused to treat such patients.Jakulis (2010), p. 77 The brotherhood also sheltered pregnant women and their abandoned children.Jakulis (2010), pp. 77‚Äì78 Other patients sought help for injuries, tuberculosis, rheumatism, arthritis, etc. In Kƒôstaiƒçiai, Varniai, and Minsk, the hospital was really a shelter where physically and mentally disabled persons could live for the rest of their lives. It was never a large society. At any given time, there were about 8 brothers in Vilnius and Varniai, and about 5 brothers elsewhere. It ceased to exist in 1842 when, as reprisal for the Uprising of 1831, authorities of the Russian Empire confiscated its land, which was the source of its revenue. Similar institutes active in the Grand Duchy were Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God () and Sisters of Charity ().Jakulis (2010), p. 59 History In Vilnius The brotherhood was established by Jonas Jarolaviƒçius from Joni≈°kis who sold his inheritance and founded a new church and hospital near the Vilnius Castle Complex. Due to financial difficulties, the buildings were small and poor.Jakulis (2010), p. 72 The new society soon faced a great challenge of the plague of 1710 and became famous for its dedication.Jakulis (2013) The brothers would collect the dead and transport them to ≈†nipi≈°kƒós for burial.Jakulis (2010), pp. 73‚Äì74 All of the brothers perished during the plague.Jakulis (2010), p. 74 Bishop of Vilnius Konstanty Kazimierz Brzostowski became direct superior of the society in 1713.Jakulis (2010), p. 62 He renamed and reorganized it. The brothers took the traditional vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience.Jakulis (2010), p. 70 Brzostowski added an additional vow of caring for the sick. The brothers were required to wear ash color habit, black cloak and hat. The left sleeve had to have an image of a skull ‚Äì a memento mori. The brotherhood had its own regula, confirmed by the bishop in 1726 and 1743.Jakulis (2010), p. 64 In 1715, the brotherhood was given the small Church of St. Stephen and hospital of St. Lazarus near the present-day Vilnius railway station. The church and the hospital was in a poor condition and required extensive repairs.Jakulis (2010), p. 73 The brotherhood also established four or five infirmaries in Vilnius. According to inspection reports from 1788 and 1797, the brotherhood had 68 and 63 patients in Vilnius, respectively.Jakulis (2010), p. 76 A 1786 report also noted that due to poor conditions, the brotherhood should not take on more than 40 patients at a time. A 1790 report lamented that instead of caring for the poor, the hospital in Vilnius would accept only those with connections (e.g. servants of the wealthy residents). There are known cases when patients had to pay for their treatment.Jakulis (2010), p. 78 In 1797, a special city commission decided to establish the main hospital in Vilnius. It was determined that the Church of St. Philip and St. Jacob was the most suitable location to house 200 poor and 50 sick people.Jakulis (2010), p. 90 That mean that other smaller hospitals would be merged into this new hospital and then liquidated. It is unknown what happened to the brothers after their hospital was closed.Jakulis (2010), p. 91 Elsewhere The brotherhood expanded outside Vilnius in 1738 when a church, monastery, and hospital were founded in Kƒôstaiƒçiai in the Diocese of Samogitia. The foundation was sizable ‚Äì 18 voloks of land, forest, meadows, and 2.5 lakes. This foundation was confirmed by Grand Duke Augustus III.Jakulis (2010), p. 85 The first church burned down in 1808, but it was rebuilt in 1820. The hospital was intended for 24 people (12 men and 12 women). Most likely it functioned more as a shelter for mentally ill rather than a hospital (its inventory books do not mention expenses for medicines or doctors).Jakulis (2010), p. 86 When in 1842 authorities of the Russian Empire confiscated its land, the hospital was converted into a home for the elderly priests. Its last inhabitants were transferred to the Bernadine Monastery in Kretinga in 1866.Jakulis (2010), p. 93 Bishop of Samogitia Antoni Dominik Tyszkiewicz established the brotherhood in Varniai, then the seat of the diocese, in 1743. They took over an existing hospital by the Cathedral of St. Peter and St. Paul and rebuilt it by 1748.Jakulis (2010), p. 87 The brotherhood took care not only of the sick, but also of the elderly retired priests. In 1752, the brotherhood in the Diocese of Samogitia became subordinate to the Bishop of Samogitia, instead of the Bishop of Vilnius. That, in a way, created two branches of the brotherhood.Jakulis (2010), p. 65 In 1782, the brotherhood moved outside the center of the town because the new bishop Jan Stefan Giedroyƒá did not approve of the mentally ill loitering around the cathedral.Jakulis (2010), p. 88 In 1827 and 1828, the hospital had 68 and 56 patients, respectively. Most of them had severe physical and mental disabilities.Jakulis (2010), p. 89 The brotherhood closed in 1842 after the confiscation of its landholdings by the Tsarist authorities. In 1750, dean of Vand≈æiogala founded a monastery and hospital for the brotherhood in Kaunas near the Church of St. Gertrude. The brotherhood helped with the repairs of the church in 1785‚Äì1795.Jakulis (2010), p. 80 In 1797, the brotherhood had 48 patients (30 men, 18 women). Of them, 14 were to remain for the rest of their lives because of severe physical and mental disabilities.Jakulis (2010), p. 82 After the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the church was devastated, but remained standing, while other buildings burned to the ground.Jakulis (2010), p. 80 Lacking financial resources, the brotherhood was unable to rebuild. An 1823 report found that the brothers, their patients, and foundlings (70‚Äì90 people in total) were crammed into a two-room building. Such poor conditions encouraged epidemics. No new brothers would join the brotherhood and the three remaining brothers were getting older. In 1824, their hospital was taken over by the Sisters of Charity.Jakulis (2010), p. 92 In 1752, the brotherhood and the Church of St. Veronica were founded in Minsk by a priest. An infirmary for women was founded in 1763.Jakulis (2010), p. 83 After the establishment of the Diocese of Minsk in 1798, the society in Minsk became subordinate to the Bishop of Minsk.Jakulis (2010), p. 66 The inspection in 1820 found the hospital in a deplorable state. It stopped treating men, caring only for poor and disabled women. It lacked such basics as food and cleanliness. In addition, from 1819, the brotherhood was entrusted with the care of several dozens of arrested women. The inspector concluded that it was doing more harm than good. The hospital was liquidated the following year; any useful property was transferred to Brothers Hospitallers of St. John of God.Jakulis (2010), pp. 91‚Äì92 References ;Notes ;Bibliography 1705 establishments in the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth 1842 disestablishments in Europe Catholic nursing orders Catholic religious institutes established in the 18th century Catholic Church in Lithuania History of Lithuania (1569‚Äì1795) Religious organizations disestablished in the 1840s ","title":"Brotherhood of Saint Roch"},{"id":"46440968","text":"Laurence Yeomans Cairns, (May 19, 1892 - July 27, 1967) was a Canadian lawyer and judge.

The genus Clerodendrum is large with more than 300 species currently accepted. This climber, first described in 1804 by Jean Louis Marie Poiret, has slender, finely pubescent branches. Leaves are oblong to ovate-elliptic, with entire margins, an acute apex, and subcordate base; petiole is from 2‚Äì8 cm in length. Inflorescence of umbellate cymes is terminal and many-flowered. The fragrant flowers may be red or white, with a pink or red tinge to the centre. Calyx cup-shaped, with 5 lobes; corolla-tube puberulous, also 5-lobed. Drupe bluish- black, enclosed by a red calyx, and splitting into 4 pyrenes when mature. Medicinal The species has been used traditionally in some Central African countries for treating several diseases including intestinal helminthiasis. An extract of its bitter leaves is effective against Schistosoma mansoni. The leaf and its sap are used as pain-killers, while the roots are taken for stomach ailments. Extracts of the leaves are employed as abortifacients, ecbolics and for curing venereal diseases. It is also used to treat dropsy, swellings, oedema and gout, and as an antidote for venomous stings and bites.

He attended primary school in his hometown and high school in Belgrade. He was enrolled in law school but his studies were disrupted by his political interest. A Serbian nationalist, he participated in the March Demonstrations (1903) in Belgrade against King Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá, and was accused of being the leader of Greater Serbia-demonstrations and an associate of the rivaling officers; he was forced to flee by boat to Zemun, at the time part of the Austro-Hungary. He moved to Vienna, and then returned to Serbia following the May Coup. As many nationalistic youths he was inspired by the Serbian Chetnik Organization. In February 1905 he joined the unit of Aksentije Bacetoviƒá-Baceta and operated in the Kozjak area, participating in several operations. After the death of Baceta in 1905, he returned to Belgrade where he finished his law studies. At this time he began working in journalism. He spent some time in Brussels. As a student, he was a founder and editor of the Slovenski jug magazine, and when he was unable to pay the rent for his apartment he slept in the office. In 1911, Ljuba Jovanoviƒá with two colleagues, Branko Bo≈æoviƒá and Bogdan Radenkoviƒá, started a daily called Pijemont that had among its contributors well-known critics, poets, and writers, including Jovan Skerliƒá Milutin Bojiƒá, Milan Rakiƒá, Jovan Duƒçiƒá, and others. Apart from tirelessly campaigning for pan-Serb unification, Pijemont offered a variety of political ideas, targeting corruption and discord in Serbia. Ljuba was one of initiators of the establishment of the Black Hand (1911), and one of the founding members. Together with Bogdan Radenkoviƒá and Vojislav Tankosiƒá he wrote the constitution of the organization. The constitution was modeled after similar German secret nationalist associations and the Italian Carbonari. He founded the Pijemont magazine in August 1911. He was mobilized in the First Balkan War and fought as a reserve officer. He participated in the Second Balkan War against Bulgaria in the summer of 1913 and was wounded in the knee in fighting around Veles. He was transported for treatment in Skopje, but the hospital was infected with cholera, from which he died on 25 June 1913. He was buried in Skopje, but the location of his remains is unknown.

It is approximately long and flows through Dunmore and Scranton. The watershed of the stream has an area of , though it used to be considerably larger. It is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, but many reaches of the stream have been destroyed by mining or post-mining development impacts. The stream flows through a culvert system for much of its length. However, there are areas where it is in an open concrete channel or has a natural streambed. There are also patches of old- growth forest along the stream in the Forest Hill Cemetery. Meadow Brook has experienced significant flow loss and what flow it does have mainly consists of intermittent stormwater flows. There used to be springs, seeps, and wetlands at the stream's headwaters. However, a colliery (and later a landfill) was built over that area. The Dunmore Cemetery and the Forest Hill Cemetery are in the stream's vicinity. Meadow Brook is a first-order stream. Course Meadow Brook begins near the Dunmore Cemetery in Dunmore. It flows north-northwest for a short distance before turning west for a few tenths of a mile. The stream then turns west-southwest for more than a mile, entering Scranton and losing its surface flow. It then turns southwest for a few tenths of a mile, briefly regaining its surface flow before losing it again and gaining it once more. A short distance further downstream, the stream reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River. Meadow Brook joins the Lackawanna River upriver of its mouth. Tributaries Meadow Brook used to have a tributary. However, the tributary was destroyed by operations by the Price- Pancost Coal Company in the 1890s, the construction of Interstate 81, and the construction of the Marywood University campus in the 1960s. Hydrology and climate Meadow Brook experiences complete flow loss in some reaches. Reaches of the stream have also been entirely destroyed by past mining or post-mining development. It mainly serves as a sewer shed and its flow consists of intermittent stormwater flows. There is one stormwater detention facility in the stream's watershed. It is owned by the Swift Fence Company. Several combined sewer overflows in the watershed of Meadow Brook have been identified and removed since the 1990s. The stream typically has a dry streambed. Large amounts of debris have been found in the stream and the streambed, including landscape waste, floral waste, tree debris, and trash. Large deposits of sediment are also present near Jefferson Avenue. At its mouth, the peak annual discharge of Meadow Brook has a 10 percent chance of reaching . It has a 2 percent chance of reaching and a 1 percent chance of reaching . The peak annual discharge has a 0.2 percent chance of reaching . Springtime water temperature measurements of the stream have ranged from . Geography and geology The elevation near the mouth of Meadow Brook is above sea level. The elevation near the stream's source is above sea level. Meadow Brook has been so severely affected by urban development or historic mining that it no longer resembles a stream. It has been described as \\"essentially non-existent\\". However, some features of the stream's channel still remain. It is similar in these respects to some other streams in the area. Where the streambed is still natural, it consists of a mixture of cobbles and rocks. The source of Meadow Brook used to be a series of springs and seeps on a ridge near the base of the Moosic Mountains. The springs also fed a complex of glacial bogs and wetlands. However, the Pennsylvania Coal Company eventually constructed the Gypsy Grove Colliery on the site, and eventually the Keystone Sanitary Landfill came to occupy the area. Two stone arch bridges cross Meadow Brook in the Forest Hill Cemetery, where the stream still maintains a natural channel. Other reaches of the stream are above ground, but in a concrete channel. However, there is an extensive underground culvert system on the stream, and most of its length is within that system. The culvert system crosses under a dozen streets. The stream flows through seven pipes with sizes ranging from . Watershed The watershed of Meadow Brook has an area of . However, it used to have a watershed with an area of . The stream is entirely within the United States Geological Survey quadrangle of Scranton. The stream is classified as a first- order stream. Major land uses in the watershed of Meadow Brook include high- density residential land, industrial land, and open space. The Green Ridge neighborhood is near the stream; other nearby neighborhoods include Hollywood, Marywood University, the Dunmore Cemetery, and the Forest Hill Cemetery. The Keystone Landfill and Interstate 81 are the main land uses in the vicinity of the watershed's upper reaches. A bioswale has been constructed in the stream's watershed, as have subsurface infiltration beds. Meadow Brook is a source of flooding in the borough of Dunmore. Floodwaters from the stream during Hurricane Diane in 1955 damaged low-lying land in the borough. History Meadow Brook was entered into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1199142. A reach of Meadow Brook from the Oral School to Sanderson Avenue was culvertized in the 1880s, during the development of the Green Ridge neighborhood. By 1900, the stream had completely lost all of its natural functions, with its base flow being lost due to underground mining. In 1909, the Pennsylvania Coal Company diverted water from the stream into the Underwood Mine Drainage Tunnel. In the 1960s, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection diverted more water to construct boreholes leading to the Underwood Tunnel. In 1995 and 1997, an artificial watershed was constructed to divert stormwater flows from Interstate 81 away from the stream. There are several cemeteries and institutions in the middle of the watershed of Meadow Brook. In the early 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan recommended that the city of Scranton include protection of Meadow Brook in its zoning plans. It also recommended including the restoration of the stream in the comprehensive plan for Scranton. Restoration of the stream is impractical, but it is possible to conserve surviving stream reaches, such as those near the Dunmore Cemetery and Marywood University. The stream's culvert system between Penn Avenue and its mouth was rebuilt in 2004 in a $6 million project funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Biology The drainage basin of Meadow Brook is designated as a coldwater fishery and a migratory fishery. In the reach near the Forest Hill Cemetery, where a natural stream channel still remains, there are some patches of old- growth forest on Meadow Brook. As of the early 2000s, more than twenty white pines, hemlocks, and red oaks with ages over 150 years inhabited this area. However, in 1996, the Cemetery Association allowed the harvesting of more than a dozen even older trees from the area. The harvested trees were between 175 and 250 years old. In addition to old-growth forests, the understory in the Forest Hill Cemetery reach of Meadow Brook contains old-growth rhododendrons. Mountain laurel and other forested plants occur in the stream's riparian area. In 1997, the area along a reach of Meadow Brook was noted to be suitable for small mammals such as squirrels, rabbits, and mice. However, no wildlife was observed in this reach except for birds.

Les amphiaspides (Heterostraci) du Devonien de la Siberie. √âditions du Centre national de la recherche scientifique, 1971. In life, all amphiaspidids are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives mostly buried in the sediment of a series of hypersaline lagoons. Amphiaspids are easily distinguished from other heterostracans in that all of the plates of the cephalothoracic armor are fused into a single, muff-like unit, so that the forebody of the living animal would have looked, in the case of gabreyaspidids, vaguely like a horseshoe crab with a pair of small, or degenerated eyes, with each flanked by a preorbital opening, and a simple, slit-like mouth positioned slightly ventrally. Gabreyaspidids differ from the amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of Amphiaspididae primarily due to ornamentation unique to each family, and differs from amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of Olbiaspididae in that gabreyaspidids' mouths are ventrally positioned, whereas the mouths of olbiaspidids are positioned anteriorly. Taxonomy Gabreyaspis Gabreyaspis tarda is the type species of the family, and is known from several mostly complete cephalothoracic armors. It has a woodgrain-like ornamentation over its armor, with several tesserae-like units, especially around the head- region. Prosarctaspis Prosarctaspis taimyrica has a broad, flat, half- circle-shaped armor that looks vaguely like a horseshoe crab. Pelaspis Pelaspis teres differs from other gabreyaspidids in its unique ornamentation, the shape of its cephalothoracic armor, which is oval-circular, and suggestive of a pizza or a cookie, and its apparent lack of a dorsal spine. Tareyaspis Tareyaspis venusta is similar in size and dimensions to Pelaspis, but differs in ornamentation, and the shape of the posterior region of the cephalothoracic armor, which, in T. venusta, has a dorsal spine.

Background An African- American, Cox graduated in 1975 from Red River Senior High School, then known as Coushatta High School, in Coushatta, the seat of government for Red River Parish. He received a bachelor's degree from Northwestern State University in Natchitoches and graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, and the Army Comptroller School. Cox lists his church affiliation as Christian. He and his wife, Candie, have four children and reside in Mansfield in DeSoto Parish. Political life In the general election held on November 19, 2011, Cox unseated the one-term Republican incumbent, Rick Nowlin of Natchitoches, who subsequently was elected a year later in 2012 as the first administrative President of Natchitoches Parish. Cox polled 5,556 votes (53.4 percent) to Nowlin's 4,847 (46.6 percent). Nowlin carried Natchitoches Parish but lost decisively to Cox in DeSoto and Red River parishes.Louisiana Secretary of State, General election returns, November 19, 2011 In the October 22 primary, Nowlin had narrowly led with 5,662 votes (43.6 percent), and Cox trailed with 5,506 votes (42.4 percent). Another Democrat, Ralph Wilson, who also sought the seat in 2007, held the remaining but critical 1,805 ballots (13.9 percent). Nowlin's defeat is attributed in part to his District 23 having become a majority African- American district in the 2011 redistricting based upon the 2010 census. In 2007, Cox ran unsuccessfully in House District 7 against the Republican Richard Burford of Stonewall in DeSoto Parish, who was subsequently re-elected in the 2011 primary and has been a colleague of Cox since 2012. Burford is a candidate in 2015 for the Louisiana State Senate seat being vacated by the term-limited Republican Sherri Smith Buffington. Representative Cox is a member of the Louisiana Legislative Black Caucus, the Rural Caucus, and the Democratic Caucus. He sits on these committees: (1) Commerce, (2) Health and Welfare, (3) Labor and Industrial Relations, (4) Military and Veterans Affairs. Though Cox sports ratings under 20 percent from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, he is ranked 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2014, he co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics. That same year, he voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. In 2013, he voted to increase judicial pay and for lifetime concealed carry gun permits.

It is operated by the company Corte Lodato LLC, founded by CEO Brian Warner in 2008. The site has been criticized for a lack of transparency for its calculations, with no way to verify the accuracy what CelebrityNetWorth reports. Most content is written by freelance writers, rather than journalists or computer scientists to analyze data. Activities CelebrityNetWorth creates web pages that list a celebrity's name, biography, and estimates of net worth and salary. The site calculates net worth by \\"applying a proprietary algorithm\\" based on publicly available information and using financial analysts to review such results. Warner has said of their estimates that \\"If we end up too far off, there is always some kind of backlash. There have been a handful cases when we‚Äôve been proved to be off, and we‚Äôve corrected it.\\" The site provides news articles on financial transactions of celebrities such as the purchase of a home or lawsuits. CelebrityNetWorth creates lists ranking wealthy individuals based upon their wealth. In 2012 the company compiled a list of the 25 richest people in history, adjusted for inflation, naming King Mansa Musa of the Mali Empire at the top of the list. That same year, it created a list of the world's richest DJs, and a survey which named Ringo Starr as the world's richest drummer.  Interactions with Google  In 2014, Google requested permission from Warner to include CelebrityNetWorth's data in its Knowledge Graph. Warner declined. However, in February 2016, Google began using information from its search index of CelebrityNetWorth to display featured snippets with net worths at the top of their search result pages for relevant queries. The featured snippets were positioned above the search results, including results for CelebrityNetWorth. As a result, CelebrityNetWorth's web traffic declined by 65 percent from January 2016 to January 2017. In July 2019 CelebrityNetWorth was asked to submit on-the-record testimony to the House Subcommittee on Antitrust as part of its investigation into Google's anti-competitive behavior. The testimony provided a timeline detailing Google's encroachment into CelebrityNetWorth's business through the use of scraped content and \\"Featured Snippet\\" answer boxes. The testimony made three primary arguments; 1) That Google used its market power as a monopoly to benefit itself while hurting competitors; 2) That Google's actions have had negative impacts on the open internet; and 3) That these actions harm everyday Internet consumers.

In life, all amphiaspidids are thought to be benthic animals that lived most of their lives mostly buried in the sediment of a series of hypersaline lagoons. Amphiaspids are easily distinguished from other heterostracans in that all of the plates of the cephalothoracic armor are fused into a single, muff-like unit, so that the forebody of the living animal would have looked, in the case of olbiaspidids, vaguely like a hot water bottle with a pair of small, or degenerated eyes, with each flanked by a preorbital opening, and a simple, slit-like mouth positioned at the anteriormost portion of the cephalothoracic armor. Olbiaspidids differ from the amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of Amphiaspididae in that olbiaspidids have wing-like extensions of the cephalothoracic armor that the genera of Amphiaspididae lack, and differ from amphiaspidoid amphiaspids of Gabreyaspididae in that gabreyaspidids' mouths are ventrally positioned, whereas the mouths of olbiaspidids are positioned anteriorly. Taxonomy Olbiaspis This is the type genus of the family, and has two species, O. coalescens, and O. latissima. O. coalescens resembles a hot water bottle with dorso-anteriorly positioned small eyes flanked by preorbital openings, and a prominent dorsal spine, while O. latissima is extremely broad in comparison. Kureykaspis Kureykaspis salebrosa has a compact cephalothoracic armor that is pear-shaped (when viewed from above), and that is decorated with distinctive ridges and nodules. The armor has lateral wings with serrated edges. The dorsal spine is vestigial or lacking. Angaraspis Angaraspis urvantzevi differs from other olbiaspidids in having a rhomboid-shaped cephalothoracic armor. Like Olbiaspis, A. urvantzevi has a prominent dorsal spine.

It is located approximately north of Alice Springs and south of Darwin. The park is found just off along the Stuart Highway on the western side, via an unsealed track to a telecommunications tower in the nearby Hann Range. The traditional owners of the area are the Arrente and Anmatyerr peoples to whom it is a sacred site. The area is at the junction of many creation stories, and the name of the site in the Arrente dialect is Arurlte Artwatye, where Arurlte means 'the top of the shoulders across the neck' and Artwatye means 'gap'. The name of the site is derived from the sandstone ridge that dominates the reserve standing above the surrounding Burt Plain. The name of the area was first used in 1872 when one of the builders of the Overland telegraph, W. W. Mills, reported to Charles Todd that they had come to a Native Gap. He wrote of a native well that was situated in a gap in Hann's Range. The gap is thought to have taken the name of the well it contained. In 1880 workers on the telegraph widened the gap by blasting the rock with explosives but in doing so destroying the water-holding rocks. Flora found at the reserve include the native fig, white cypress pine found up on the ridge along with shrubs including Acacia monticola and Acacia melleodora, Eucalyptus gamophylla, and Eucalyptus sessilis also grow on top of the ridge even in the most exposed areas. ironwood, desert bloodwood and ghost gums on the sandy flats. Desert grasses and spinifex are found throughout the reserve, with Drosera growing on the flats after rain. Other plants found through the reserve include Grevillea wickhamii and some Gossypium species Birdlife found on the reserve include western bowerbirds that feed on the native fig, little woodswallows, dusky grasswrens among the spinifex and brown quail after wet seasons.

The ''''', or Trial against the Jews of Trent, was an unpublished manuscript describing the trial and execution of 18 Jews from Trent, Italy, for the murder of Simon of Trent in 1475. Commissioned in the 1470s, it came into the possession of a convent in Vienna in the 17th century and remained there until 1937, when it was purchased at auction by Lessing J. Rosenwald in order to avoid the document falling into the hands of the Nazis and being used to justify anti-semitism. After being sealed for 50 years, it was auctioned and now resides in Yeshiva University. The book consists of 614 folios and contains specific documents relating to the 1475 trial; it has been used as a source of scholarship in understanding the trial, despite difficulties in identifying the author and the variety of translation problems with the multiple languages used during the interrogation and trial itself, which are reflected in the '.  Origins and history  The ' was written some time between 20 June 1478 and 1479 as a commission by either Eberhard I, Duke of W√ºrttemberg or his brother-in-law, Francesco Gonzaga. Whoever was responsible for it, the work features the arms of the Dukes of W√ºrttemberg, and consists of 614 illuminated folios. In 1615 it was acquired by a convent in Vienna, where it remained until the Great Depression in the 1930s, when it was auctioned. It came up for auction in December 1937, when it drew the attention of the Jewish-American businessman and bibliomane Lessing J. Rosenwald. Rosenwald was certain that, should the manuscript be obtained by the Nazi German administration, it would be used to justify anti-Semitism, and insisted that his auction agent spend whatever amount of money was necessary to secure it. This was done, with one of the outbid auction attendees later discovered to be an agent of the German government. As soon as the work arrived in the United States, Rosenwald shipped it to the American Jewish Historical Society, mandating that it be sealed and hidden for 50 years. When this time period expired, the Society auctioned the manuscript for $176,000 to Erica and Ludwig Jesselson, a pair of Jewish cultural collectors and patrons. The manuscript was then donated to Yeshiva University in 1988, where it remains. In 1992 it was used as a resource by R. Po-Chia Hsia, a European history professor, to author the book Trent 1475: Stories of a Ritual Murder Trial and contribute to scholarship around the trials in Trent.  Contents  The subject of the ' is the \\"notorious fifteenth century criminal case\\" in which 18 members of the Jewish community of Trent were arrested for the murder of Simon of Trent and tortured until they falsely confessed: the men were then executed, and the women forced to convert to Christianity. The Prozess is not a complete copy of the trial proceedings, as it was commissioned during the campaign to secure Simon of Trent's status as a Catholic Saint; it contains only selected documents. To legitimise the work, it begins with the papal bull of Pope Sixtus IV that validated the trial, translated into German. It then provides a chronological prologue, describing the disappearance of Simon, the discovery of the corpse and the first arrests, before focusing on the trial proceedings, particularly the interrogations. The author of the document is believed to be either Hans von Fundo, the scribe of the criminal court, or Peter Rauter of Malefarrat - identifying distinct voices and a particular author is rendered difficult by the variety of languages used during the interrogations, including German, Hebrew and Italian.

It is a shrub with papery bark, narrow leaves with a hooked end and cream-coloured or yellow flowers. Although it was described as late as 2010, it is not considered a rare or endangered species. It resembles other members of the brushwood group such as M. uncinata, M. atroviridis and M. zeteticorum.Wongan Hills Description Melaleuca protrusa is a shrub growing to a height of with papery bark at the base of the main stem and glabrous branchlets. The leaves are arranged alternately, long, wide, linear in shape, elliptic in cross section and with a short, bent hook on the end. The flowers are cream to yellow and are arranged in heads at the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering and sometimes on the sides of branches. The heads are in diameter and contain 10 to 16 groups of flowers in threes. The petals are long and fall off soon after the flower opens. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers and each bundle contains 3 to 5 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are long in roughly spherical clusters around the stem with each fruit protruding somewhat from the cluster. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca protrusa was first described in 2010 by Lyndley Craven, Brendan Lepschi and Kirsten Cowley. The specific epithet (protrusa) is derived from the Latin protrudo meaning to \\"push forward\\" or \\"thrust out\\" referring to the way the individual fruits protrude from the clusters. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca protrusa occurs in and between the districts of Mullewa, Dalwallinu, Sandstone and Southern Cross in the Avon Wheatbelt, Coolgardie and Murchison biogeographic regions where it grows in mallee thicket in sandy or clay loam over granite. Conservation This melaleuca is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife. Uses This species contains the monoterpenoid essential oil, 1,8-cineole (Eucalyptol). Owing to its similarities to M. uncinata, it may be suitable for brushwood production.

Among the Archontics, Ophites, Sethians and in the writings of Nag Hammadi library, the archons are rulers, each related to one of seven planets; they prevent souls from leaving the material realm. The political connotation of their name reflects rejection of the governmental system, as flawed without chance of true salvation.Francis T. Fallon \\"The Enthronement of Sabaoth\\" Brill Archive, 1978 p. 80 In Manichaeism, the archons are the rulers of a realm within the 'Kingdom of Darkness', who together make up the Prince of Darkness. Hebdomad A characteristic feature of the Gnostic concept of the universe is the role played in almost all Gnostic systems by the seven world-creating archons, known as the (·ºëŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒºŒ¨œÇ). These Seven are in most systems semi-hostile powers, and are reckoned as the last and lowest emanations of the Godhead; below them‚Äîand frequently considered as proceeding from them‚Äîcomes the world of the actually devilish powers. There are indeed certain exceptions; Basilides taught the existence of a \\"great archon\\" called Abraxas who presided over 365 archons.Irenaeus, Adversus Haereses, i. 24. Evidently from works such as the Apocryphon of John, the Ophite Diagrams, On the Origin of the World and Pistis Sophia, archons play an important role in Gnostic cosmology. Probably originally referring to the Greek daimons of the planets, in Gnosticism they became the demonic rulers of the material world, each associated with a different celestial sphere. As rulers over the material world, they are called ·ºÑœÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (, \\"principalities\\", or \\"rulers\\"). As with ancient astronomy, which thought of a sphere of fixed stars, above the spheres of the seven planets,Clem. Alex. Stromata, iv. 25, xxv. p. 636: see also his quotation, v. 11, p. 692, of a mention of the fifth heaven in apocryphal writings ascribed to Zepbaniah beyond the spheres of the evil archons (Hebdomad), there were the supercelestial regions which a soul must reach by gnosis to escape the dominion of the archons. This place is thought of as the abode of Sophia (Wisdom) and Barbelo, also called Ogdoad. Naming and associations The Ophites accepted the existence of these seven archons (Origen, Contra Celsum, vi. 31; a nearly identical list is given in On the Origin of the World):For \\"feminine names,\\" see . For planets, see *Yaldabaoth, called also Saklas and Samael **Saturn. **Feminine name: Pronoia (Forethought) Sambathas, \\"week\\". **Prophets:\\"Moreover, they distribute the prophets in the following manner.... Each one of these, then, glorifies his own father and God, and they maintain that Sophia, herself has also spoken many things through them regarding the first Anthropos (man), and concerning that Christ who is above, thus admonishing and reminding men of the incorruptible light, the first Anthropos, and of the descent of Christ.\\" (Irenaeus i. 30) Moses, Joshua, Amos, Habakkuk. **From Hebrew , \\"Child of Chaos\\"? The outermost who created the six others, and therefore the chief ruler and Demiurge par excellence. Called \\"the Lion- faced\\", leontoeides. *Iao **Jupiter. **Feminine name: Lordship. **Prophets: Samuel, Nathan, Jonah, Micah. **Perhaps from Yahu, Yahweh, but possibly also from the magic cry iao in the Mysteries. *Sabaoth **Mars. **Feminine name: Deity. **Prophets: Elijah, Joel, Zechariah. ***The Old Testament phrase or 'Jehovah of Armies' was thought a proper name, hence Jupiter Sabbas. *Astaphanos, or Astaphaios **Venus. **Feminine name: Sophia. **Prophets: Esdras, Zephaniah. **Astraphaios is beyond doubt the planet Venus, as there are gnostic gems with a female figure and the legend ASTAPHE, which name is also used in magic spells as the name of a goddess. *Adonaios ** The Sun. **Feminine name: Kingship. **Prophets: Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel. **From the Hebrew term for \\"the Lord\\", used of God; Adonis of the Syrians representing the Winter sun in the cosmic tragedy of Tammuz. In the Mandaean system Adonaios represents the Sun. *Elaios, or Ailoaios, or sometimes Ailoein **Mercury. **Feminine name: Jealousy. **Prophets: Tobias, Haggai. **From Elohim, God (El). *Horaios **The Moon. **Feminine name: Wealth. **Prophets: Michaiah, Nahum. **From Jaroah? or \\"light\\"? or Horus? In the Hellenized form of Gnosticism, either all or some of these names are replaced by personified vices. Authadia (Authades), or Audacity, is the obvious description of Yaldabaoth, the presumptuous Demiurge, who is lion-faced as the Archon Authadia. Of the archons Kakia, Zelos, Phthonos, Errinnys, Epithymia, the last represents Venus. The number seven is obtained by placing a proarchon or chief archon at the head. That these names are only a disguise for the Sancta Hebdomas is clear, for Sophia, the mother of them, retains the name of Ogdoad, Octonatio. Occasionally, as among the Naassenes, one meets with the archon Esaldaios, which is evidently the El Shaddai of the Bible, and he is described as the archon \\"number four\\" (). In the system of the Gnostics mentioned by Epiphanius we find, as the Seven Archons, *Iao *Saklas (the chief demon of Manichaeism) *Seth *David *Eloiein *Elilaios (probably connected with En-lil, the Bel of Nippur, the ancient god of Babylonia) *Yaldabaoth (or no. 6 Yaldaboath, no. 7 Sabaoth) The last book of the Pistis Sophia contains the myth of the capture of the rebellious archons, whose leaders here appear as five in number.Schmidt, Koptisch-gnostische Schriften, p. 234 seq. These ideas may possibly be traced still further back, and perhaps even underlie St Paul's exposition in . *Paraplex *Hekate *Ariouth (females) *Typhon *Iachtanabas (males) Mandaeans Among the Mandaeans, there is a different and perhaps more primitive conception of the Seven, according to which they, together with their mother Namrus (Ruha) and their father (Ur), belong entirely to the world of darkness. They and their family are looked upon as captives of the god of light (Manda-d'hayye, Hibil-Ziva), who pardons them, sets them on chariots of light, and appoints them as rulers of the world.Cf. chiefly Genza, in Tractat 6 and 8; W. Brandt, Mand√§ische Schriften, 125 seq. and 137 seq.; Mand√§ische Religion, 34 seq., &c.; Manichaeans The Manicheans readily adopted the Gnostic usage, and their archons are invariably evil beings, who make up the Prince of Darkness. It is related how the helper of the Primal Man, the spirit of life, captured the evil archons, and fastened them to the firmament, or according to another account, flayed them, and formed the firmament from their skin,F. C. Baur, Das manich√§ische Religionssystem, v. 65 and this conception is closely related to the other, though in this tradition the number (seven) of the archons is lost. Origins Planets Irenaeus tells us that \\"the holy Hebdomad is the seven stars which they call planets\\".Irenaeus, Against Heresies i. 30. It is safe, therefore, to take the above seven Gnostic names as designating the seven planetary divinities, the sun, moon and five planets. In the Mandaean system the Seven are introduced with the Babylonian names of the planets. The connection of the Seven with the planets is also clearly established by the expositions of Celsus and Origen (Contra Celsum, vi. 2 2 seq.) and similarly by the above-cited passage in the Pistis Sophia, where the archons, who are here mentioned as five, are identified with the five planets (excluding the sun and moon). In this, as in several other systems, the traces of the planetary seven have been obscured, but hardly in any have they become totally effaced. What tended most to obliterate the sevenfold distinction was the identification of the God of the Jews, the Lawgiver, with Yaldabaoth and his designation as World-creator, whereas formerly the seven planets together ruled the world. This confusion, however, was suggested by the very fact that at least five of the seven archons bore Old-Testament names for God‚ÄîEl Shaddai, Adonai, Elohim, Jehovah, Sabaoth. Wilhelm Anz has also pointed out that Gnostic eschatology, consisting in the soul's struggle with hostile archons in its attempt to reach the Pleroma, is a close parallel of the soul's ascent, in Babylonian astrology, through the realms of the seven planets to Anu. The late Babylonian religion can definitely be indicated as the home of these ideas.Zimmern, Keilinschriften in dem alien Testament, ii. p. 620 seq.; cf. particularly Diodorus ii. 30. Zoroastrianism The Bundahishn tells us that in the primeval strife of the devil against the light-world, seven hostile powers were captured and set as constellations in the heavens, where they are guarded by good star-powers and prevented from doing harm. Five of the evil powers are the planets, while here the sun and moon are of course not reckoned among the evil powers‚Äîfor the obvious reason that in the Persian official religion they invariably appear as good divinities.Bundahishn iii. 25, v. z. Cf. similar ideas in the Arabic treatise on Persian religion Ulema- i-Islam, Vullers, Fragmente √ºber die Religion Zoroasters, p. 49, and in other later sources for Persian religion, put together in Spiegel, Eranische Altertumskunde, Bd. ii. p. 180. It must be also noted that the Mithras mysteries, so closely connected with the Persian religion, are acquainted with this doctrine of the ascent of the soul through the planetary spheres.Origen, Contra Celsum, vi. 22.  Fallen angels In On the Origin of the World, the archons impregnate the Biblical Eve, an idea probably deriving from the Sons of God in or the Book of Enoch.Tuomas Rasimus Paradise Reconsidered in Gnostic Mythmaking: Rethinking Sethianism in Light of the Ophite Evidence BRILL p. 194 In accordance with the depictions of fallen angels in the Enochian writings, the archons incite passions to humans. Further, they both teach idolatry, sacrifices and bloodshed to enslave the Gnostics and trapping them in ignorance. Greek theology The mythology of ancient Greece knew gods, daemons, and heroes. ŒòŒµŒø·Ω∂ ·ºÑœÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ (ruling gods) appear in the subsequent philosophy of Plato.Plato, Phaedr. 247 A. However Philo never alludes to archons: in a single passage (De Mon. i. 1),Philo, De Monarchia i. 1, p. 213; cited by Hilgenfeld, Apost. Vater, 252 q. v. ·ºÑœÅœáŒøŒΩœÑŒµœÇ is merely correlative to ·ΩëœÄŒÆŒ∫ŒøŒøŒπ. Presently the syncreticism of the later Greek philosophy found room for archons, which appear in Neoplatonism and were claimed to derive from Plato's unwritten tradition. They are inserted by the author of the book De Mysteriis Aegyptiorum,Iamblichus (attr.). De Mysteriis ii. 3-9. and even it would seem by his questioner Porphyry, below gods, daemons, angels, and archangels, and above heroes (omitted by Porphyry) and departed \\"souls\\", in the scale of invisible beings whose presence may become manifest. It may be only an accidental coincidence that about the end of the 2nd century \\"Archon\\" was one of the names given by the Platonist Harpocration to the \\"Second God\\" of Numenius (Proclus in Tim. 93 C).

Chinese inscription ÊØãÂøòÊ≠§Êó• translates to \\"Never forget this day\\". The Shakee Massacre occurred on June 23, 1925 and resulted in over two hundred casualties due to gunfire by British, French and Portuguese forces in Shaji (called Shake in Cantonese), Guangzhou, China. On June 21, 1925, workers in Hong Kong and Canton went on strike in support of the May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. Two days later, on June 23, over 100,000 people convened in Eastern Jiaochang (today, the Guangdong Provincial People's Stadium), announcing their plans to remove imperialism, cancel the unequal treaties and walk to the Shakee in protest. At 3 am when the protest had moved to the west bridge, the conflict began. British and French soldiers, perceiving gunshots, began to fire on the protesters. In addition, British warships fired on the north coast of Shamian (then spelled Shameen). Over 50 were killed and more than 170 people were seriously injured. Among the dead there were 20 civilians and 23 cadets and military personnel from Whampoa Military Academy. The death toll included one woman and four minors under 16. One estimate listed the dead at 52. After the massacre, the national government in Canton (now Guangzhou) appealed to the British and French consulates, requesting a formal apology, punishment of related military officers, the removal of warships, the return of Shamian to the national government and reparations for the families of the dead. The request was rejected by the consulates. On October 29 Hong Kong made a counter strike, in which 130,000 from Hong Kong moved back to Canton.

He began his career as a Solicitor, becoming a partner in Bergin, Caine & Macrossan with the business operating from 1911 until 1924. He was called to the bar in 1913. Political career Caine's first attempt to enter Queensland Parliament came in the 1908 state election when, as a Ministerialist candidate, he contested the seat of Bowen, losing to the Labour candidate, Francis Kenna. Just one year later, parliament was dissolved, and another state election had to be held. Caine stood again for the seat of Bowen, but once again he was unsuccessful, this time losing to Myles Ferricks, another Labour candidate. Caine finally found success at the 1912 state election, when he defeated Ferricks to win the seat of Bowen. Caine held the seat for just one term, losing to Charles Collins in 1915.

Huckabee's candidacy for the Republican nomination in the 2016 Presidential election was his second, after having previously run in 2008. Following a disappointing showing in the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee ended his run on February 1, 2016. Background 2008 Presidential election Huckabee was a candidate for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 2008. In the number of states won and popular vote, Huckabee came in third behind former Massachusetts governor (and future 2012 nominee) Mitt Romney and eventual nominee Arizona senator John McCain. In terms of total delegate count, he came in second behind McCain. Post-2008 election Governor Huckabee speaking at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland Following his defeat in the 2008 election, Huckabee became the host of the eponymous show, Huckabee on Fox News Channel (FNC). In a November 19, 2008, article by the Associated Press, Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for president in 2012. He said, \\"I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans\\". A June 2009 CNN/Opinion Research Corporation national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney. An October 2009 poll of Republicans by Rasmussen Reports put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%. On May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his FNC show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, \\"All the factors say 'go', but my heart says 'no'.\\" Several political commentators speculated that Huckabee might be ready for another presidential run in 2016. He had been hindered by a lack of money in 2008 but with changes to federal election law allowing SuperPACs to pour large sums of money into a race he might be better positioned to stay in the race. Huckabee has in addition earned personal wealth since 2008 on the lecture circuit and his TV and radio shows. He ended his daily radio show in December 2013 which strengthened speculations about a presidential bid.Scott Conroy (October 23, 2014) In Iowa, Mike Huckabee Is Making Moves RealClearPolitics.

On November 8, 2015, Huckabee participated at the National Religious Liberties Conference alongside Bobby Jindal and Ted Cruz, and said that \\"our religious liberties are under assault\\". Conservative radio host Kevin Swanson, who hosted the conference, advocated for the execution of homosexuals in his speech. Two other speakers at the conference, Reverend Phillip Kayser and Joel McDurmon, have also spoken of the death penalty for homosexual acts. In the 2016 Iowa Republican caucuses, Huckabee finished in ninth place with 3,345 votes, or 1.8% of the votes cast. He subsequently withdrew from the campaign.

Jones served as mayor during the notable number of years that included several hurricane events most notably Hurricane Andrew which passed directly through Franklin. Upon the retirement of Governor Blanco, Jones was elected as a Democratic member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for District 50 in southern Louisiana, primarily St. Mary Parish, but with one precinct in Iberia Parish and two others in St. Martin Parish. Jones notably was a seat mate and roommate with Governor John Bel Edwards when Governor Edwards served in the Louisiana House of Representatives. Edwards credited Jones as being his \\"first true believer who worked tirelessly\\" as an organizer and strategist and de facto campaign manager for most of the campaign in his unexpected landslide victory over then United States Senator David Vitter in the 2015 Governor's election. Jones graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts in History from Nicholls State University in Thibodaux, Louisiana where he was also a member of the Nicholls State baseball team. He is not related to former Governor Sam H. Jones of Lake Charles. In 2007, Jones was first elected to the House in a runoff with a fellow Democrat, Allen Anthony McElroy, Jr. (born March 1948), an attorney from Berwick, 4,110 votes (53.3 percent) to 3,604 (46.7 percent). Jones was unopposed for a second term in 2011 and again unopposed for a third and final term in 2015. Representative Jones is a member of the Louisiana Rural Caucus, the Acadiana delegation, and the Democratic Caucus. He sits on these committees: (1) Natural Resources and Environment, (2) Retirement, and (3) Transportation, Highways, and Public Works. Jones ranks between 49 and 78 percent in legislative ratings from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Except for one year, he has since 2008 been rated 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2014, Jones voted for the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics. That same year, he voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He also voted to forbid the practice of transporting dogs in open truck beds on interstate highways. In 2013, Jones voted to increase judicial pay and for lifetime concealed carry gun permits. In 2012, he voted to prohibit the use of cell phones while driving and opposed the use of state tax incentives to recruit a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana. In 2012, he supported the requirement for drug testing of welfare recipients. He opposed reducing the number of hours that polling locations remain open. On April 17, 2017, Representative Jones, who is term- limited for his House seat in the 2019 state elections, introduced legislation pushed by Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards to establish a gross receipts tax on businesses within Louisiana. Known as a commercial activity tax or CAT, Jones' bill focuses on the total revenue, without expense deductions, that an organization obtains from all sources. If adopted, the tax would apply to most businesses, including corporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies.

Prelude On 25 April, two bands (ƒçeta) of some 20 fighters under voivodes Anƒëelko Aleksiƒá and ƒêorƒëe Cvetkoviƒá swore oath in a ceremony of the Serbian Committee (Dr. Milorad Goƒëevac, Vasa Jovanoviƒá, ≈Ωika Rafajloviƒá, Luka ƒÜeloviƒá and General Jovan Atanackoviƒá), with prota Nikola Stefanoviƒá holding the prayers. The Committee had prepared the formation of the first bands for a number of months. The Chetniks were sent for Poreƒçe, and on 8 May they headed out from Vranje, to Bu≈°tranje, which was divided between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire. History The Chetniks were escorted by Vasilije Trbiƒá, who told them that the best way was to go through the Kozjak and then down to the Vardar. The two voivodes however, wanted the fastest route, through the Kumanovo plains and then to ƒåetirac. They managed to enter Turkish territory but were subsequently exposed in the plain Albanian and Turkish villages, and the Ottomans closed in on them from all sides, and they decided to stay on the ≈†uplji Kamen, which gave them little defence instead of meeting the army on the plains; in broad daylight, the Ottoman military easily poured bombs over the hill and killed all 24 of the Chetniks on 27 May. According to Serbian state documents, the death toll was 24 Chetniks, a zaptƒ± (Ottoman gendarmerie), and three Ottoman soldiers. Serbian deputy Ristiƒá, according to the document, named ≈Ωika Rafajloviƒá as the organizer of the band, and that \\"such adventures and thoughtless treacherous actions should be stopped\\".

So far, it is the fourth described vetulicolian that is not restricted to the Maotianshan Shales (the other three being Ooedigera of Sirius Passet, Banffia of the Burgess Shale, and Skeemella of the Wheeler Shale).  Anatomy  Restoration N. aldridgei is known from several incomplete fossils which suggest that, in life, it was a fairly large animal (when compared to other vetulicolians). The largest fossil is about 150 millimetres long, leading researchers to estimate that that individual was about 170 millimetres long. The exquisitely preserved fossils show that running the length inside the tail was a notochord, thereby demonstrating the animal's chordate affinities as being related to tunicates. The forebody, and overall form are similar to vetulicolids of Vetulicolidae, though, its researchers do not have confidence to place N. aldridgei within either Vetulicolid families Vetulicolidae, or Didazoonidae.  Etymology  The genus name translates as \\"island swimmer\\" in reference to both its obvious adaptations for a nektonic lifestyle in the water column, and the great distance between Kangaroo Island and China, the primary center of vetulicolian diversity, even during Cambrian times. The specific name commemorates the efforts and memory of Richard ‚ÄúDick‚Äù Aldridge for his crucial research in resolving vetulicolian affinities.

It is a bear-like creature that has been known to walk upright. They sneak into villages at night to carry off livestock for food. It was described in the Ehon Hyaku Monogatari, a collection of supernatural tales published in 1841. Description When a bear has lived for many years, it becomes an onikuma. With enough strength to be able to move boulders as large as two meters in diameter, it is said to be able to kill a small animal simply by pushing it. It comes down from the mountains to steal horses and cattle, which it brings back to the mountain to eat. Some large stones in the Kiso Valley are called \\"Onikuma stones.\\" Given their size and placement, they are attributed to onikuma. Local tradition states that onikuma throw these stones, larger than ten people together could move, at humans from the mountains above. The method to kill an onikuma was to hollow out a large tree into a tube like a well lining and use it to block up the mouth of the nest of vines, then plunge poles through the hollow trunk into the nest. When the disoriented onikuma made its way to the opening, it would be attacked with spears and guns. It is said that in the Ky≈çh≈ç era, when several onikuma were killed, each skin when spread out covered an area of six tatami mats (about 10 square meters) or more. Additionally, in Hokkaido, bears that attacked humans were feared as onikuma.

It is a small shrub with narrow leaves, heads of purple, pink or mauve flowers and clusters of woody fruit. It is similar to M. bisulcata but differs from that species in characters such as the shape of its fruit, leaves and buds but like that species is an attractive, profusely flowering shrub suitable for cultivation as a garden plant. Description Melaleuca psammophila is a small, ground- hugging shrub which grows to a height of about . Its branchlets are covered with woolly hairs which are gradually lost as the branches mature. Its leaves are sparsely covered with shorter hairs and are arranged alternately on the stems. Each leaf is long and wide, linear to narrow-elliptical in shape with a rounded end, distinct oil glands and two shallow channels on the lower surface. The flowers are mostly arranged in heads on the ends of branches which continue to grow after flowering. The heads are up to in diameter and contain up to four groups of flowers in threes. The stamens give the flower heads their pinkish colour with each stamen tipped with a contrasting yellow anther. The stamens are arranged in five bundles around the flowers, each bundle containing between 7 and 15 stamens. Flowering occurs in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody, urn or vase-shaped capsules long, in clusters along the stems. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca psammophila was first described in 1904 by Ludwig Diels and Ernst Georg Pritzel in Botanische jahrbucher fur systematik, pflanzengeschichte und pflanzengeographie under the heading Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae occidentalis:Beitrage zur Kenntnis der Pflanzen Westaustraliens, ihrer Verbreitung und ihrer Lebensverhaltnisse (\\"Contributions to the knowledge of the plants of West Australia, where they are found and their conditions of existence\\").

Zeman and Rachel Mills, a researcher, investigate the real- life origins of several urban legends.  Plot  Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills investigate the origins of several urban legends: ; The Hookman : In The Hook, a man with a hook for a hand attempts to murder teenagers who park in a lovers' lane. Zeman and Mills trace this to the Texarkana Moonlight Murders, an unsolved crime that was the basis for the early slasher film The Town That Dreaded Sundown. Zeman and Mills compare and contrast the film to the real- life events, and both to the urban legend. Neither the real-life events nor the film feature a killer with a hook for a hand, but they do have a serial killer who preys upon teenagers who make out at a lovers' lane. ; The Candyman : Zeman and Mills travel to Houston, Texas, to investigate the urban legend of poisoned candy. Though they dismiss the widespread belief that strangers have handed out poisoned candy to neighborhood children, Zeman and Mills describe Ronald Clark O'Bryan, a man who poisoned his own son for insurance money and used the urban legend to deflect suspicion from himself. To mask his son's murder, O'Bryan also attempted to kill several other children, but they did not eat their poisoned candy. O'Bryan was convicted and executed for the crimes. ; The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs : In Columbia, Missouri, Zeman and Mills investigate the legend of The Babysitter and the Man Upstairs, in which a babysitter is harassed and ultimately killed by a man already inside the house. Although there are no documented cases of serial killers who have targeted babysitters, Zeman and Mills describe how Janett Christman was murdered while babysitting. An African-American man was convicted and executed for the murder, but Zeman and Mills question whether he was guilty. They instead point to an acquaintance who knew Christman was babysitting and had become obsessed with her. ; The Killer Clown : In Chicago, Zeman and Mills investigate the evil clown trope and associated \\"phantom clown\\" sightings across the world. In these cases, children report having seen a suspicious clown that attempts to entice them into an unmarked van, presumably to kidnap them. Zeman and Mills express skepticism and explain it as a manifestation of coulrophobia, the fear of clowns. They trace this urban legend to John Wayne Gacy, a serial killer who unrelatedly worked as a clown. Although Gacy never killed anyone while dressed as a clown, they state that his infamy popularized the trope.  Cast  * Rachel Mills * Joshua Zeman  Production  After directing Cropsey, a documentary that examines the similarities between a New York urban legend and a real-life kidnapper, Zeman approached Chiller with the idea of a series based on the intersection of urban legends and true crime. For business reasons, the series was retooled into an anthology TV film. Clowns were not initially planned to be a subject covered in the documentary, but Mills uncovered a large amount of information on them. Upon bringing this to Zeman's attention, he agreed to expand the documentary to include them.  Release  Killer Legends played for one night at the Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn, New York on March 13, 2014. Chiller aired it on March 16, 2014. Breaking Glass Pictures released the DVD on July 1, 2014. It was one of the top ten best-selling independent film on iTunes in July 2014.  Reception  Patrick Cooper of Bloody Disgusting rated it 4/5 stars and called it \\"a wholly fascinating experience on a lot of levels\\", though he criticized it for focusing so much on the filmmakers.

The series stars Mike Castle and Ashley Tisdale and centers on a group of co-workers who all went to high school together but ran in very different crowds. Now they find themselves working together at Buzzy's, a barbershop. On October 23, 2015, TBS canceled the series after one season. Premise Clipped takes place in a Charlestown, Massachusetts barbershop called Buzzy's, named after the original owner (George Wendt) who still works there. The shop's new owner is Ben (Ryan Pinkston), an unpopular student during high school who now finds himself in charge of some formerly more popular classmates. These include AJ (Mike Castle) and Danni (Ashley Tisdale), who once dated each other and who are both chasing bigger dreams. AJ was a star pitcher on the school's baseball team and still hopes to play professionally, while Danni is an aspiring singer. The rest of the staff consists of Ben's best friend Mo (Matt Cook), sarcastic stylist Charmaine (Diona Reasonover), and perpetually cheerful receptionist Joy (Lauren Lapkus).

Turner Broadcasting announced it was developing a series on TBS with the working title of Clipsters. With David Kohan and Max Mutchnick as writers and executive producers, the series would be an ensemble workplace comedy that involved an eclectic cast of hair stylists at barbershop in Worcester, Massachusetts. In April 2014, Turner Broadcasting announced that George Wendt, Ashley Tisdale, and Lauren Lapkus would star in the series. The series was now considered untitled. The series' premise involved a group of former high school students who came from different circles, and now work together at Buzzy‚Äôs Barbershop in their hometown of Charlestown, Massachusetts. They all long for moving to Boston, but they are making the best of their lives in Charlestown. On May 6, 2014, TBS, ahead of its upfront presentation in New York, picked up three comedies to series. TBS announced it had greenlit ten episodes. The series was then named Buzzy's. The series, titled Clipped, premiered on June 16, 2015. It aired for one season. Episodes Critical reception The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 43% approval rating, with a rating average of 6/10, based on 7 reviews. On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the series has a score of 55 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". In a positive review, Diane Werts of Newsday awarded the pilot a grade of a B+ and stated, \\"There's also a lot of craft behind \\"Clipped.\\" That finally tips the scales in the Turner cable world, where TNT has found success with slick dramas like \\"Rizzoli & Isles\\" and \\"Major Crimes,\\" while comedy sibling TBS more often seems to whiff. Not this time\\". Similarly, Whitney Matheson of The Hollywood Reporter commended the cast's chemistry: \\"Clipped‚Äôs charm lies in distinctive performances by Lapkus and Cook. Just as Wendt and Tisdale will attract their own admirers, so will these two comedians, whether it‚Äôs for Lapkus‚Äô Orange Is the New Black role or the actors' respective podcasts\\". Conversely, Matthew Gilbert of The Boston Globe criticized the show as \\"forgettable ‚Äî if not unpleasant\\", citing that the elements of \\"Clipped\\" might have \\"resonated and felt fresher\\" if Will & Grace hadn‚Äôt preceded it.

History CVSE Officer performing a CVSA Level 1 InspectionCVSE was conceived in 1958 as the British Columbia Department of Commercial Transport. Upon conception, CVSE became responsible for 15 fixed scale locations and 6 portable scale patrol vehicles operated by Weighmasters throughout the province. The purpose of these facilities and patrol vehicles was to protect the transportation network and infrastructure from overweight vehicles. In the 1980s, the agency expanded its mandate to include physical vehicle inspections (included in this expansion were the certified red seal mechanics that were already government inspectors working at inspection facilities that had been in place in the Lower Mainland of BC since at least the 1940s or earlier), cargo securement, document checks and driver checks to ensure that drivers, vehicles, and cargo were safe to traverse the roadway. In 1988 the agency also absorbed the BC Highways Patrol officers, which had been in existence as well in BC since 1958. This expanding mandate and broadening focus on public safety led the former Weighmasters, Highway Patrol Officers and Government Vehicle Inspectors into becoming Commercial Transport Inspectors and Portable Inspectors. In 2005, to further focus on traffic safety and vehicle inspection duties, CVSE granted the authority to their peace officers to perform traffic enforcement duties on moving violations and off-loaded the responsibility of writing permits onto the newly created Provincial Permit Center.\\"Key Facts Unmasked\\" (PDF).

In 1998, CVSE was transferred to the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC). In 2003, CVSE was then transferred to the Ministry of Justice and the Solicitor General.

These six roles are described in the following.\\"TranBC CVSE Competition\\" tranbc.ca. Updated 2015. Retrieved April 16, 2015.\\"Offence Act -- Violation Ticket Administration and Fines Regulation - Schedule 1\\" ;Commercial Transport Enforcement Officer: Commercial Transport Enforcement Officers (CTEOs) are the most visible of the six roles. CTEOs are responsible for enforcing and ensuring compliance with the acts and regulations that govern the road transportation industry through vehicle, driver and document inspections, protecting the road network and infrastructure and providing road safety through traffic enforcement and safety checks. CTEOs are a combination of two legacy roles - Portable Inspector (PI) and Commercial Transport Inspector (CTI) - and as such, CTEOs operate both the stationary vehicle inspection stations and mobile patrol vehicles for more traditional highway patrol and traffic enforcement purposes. The CTEO can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. ;Area Vehicle Inspector: Area Vehicle Inspectors (AVIs) work independently and generally tend to have a very high workload. AVIs have the authority to inspect all vehicles in the province, private motor vehicles included. AVIs are responsible for investigating fatal accidents involving commercial vehicles when asked to do so by local police, viewing and assessing facility applications for Designated Inspection Facility (DIF) status, performing facility audits on DIFs and inspecting vehicles. This position primarily focuses on monitoring both private and government carriers to ensure passenger transport vehicles meet and comply with provincial safety standards. Similar to the CTEO, the AVI can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. AVIs primarily work out of their respective regional office buildings or a vehicle only and are trained and certified Red Seal mechanics. ;Carrier Safety Inspector: Carrier Safety Inspectors (CSIs) are independent investigators whose primary purpose is monitoring drivers and carriers for National Safety Code program compliance. As part of the monitoring process, CSIs conduct investigations, interviews, inspections and quantifiable audits of driver and carrier documents, records and paperwork in accordance with national standards, and also provide training and seminars to industry and partner agencies. CSIs have the authority to issue carrier safety demerits and to cancel or suspend a carrier's NSC required for business operations. The CSI can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. CSIs primarily work out of their respective regional office buildings or a vehicle only and are ISO trained and certified. ;Dangerous Goods Inspector: Dangerous Goods Inspectors (DGIs) are specialized independent enforcement officers that primarily spend most of their time in a vehicle on patrol. DGIs are responsible for providing education to drivers and carriers, seeking compliance with and enforcing the Transportation of Dangerous Good Regulations of Canada and are empowered by the Transport of Dangerous Goods Act of British Columbia. DGIs regularly liaise with Transport Canada and may assist Transport Canada with investigations into non-compliant carriers or facilities. DGIs have a thorough understanding of the federal regulations and all of its parts relating to road transport including Parts 1 to 9, Schedules 1 to 3 and Equivalent Level of Safety certificates. Much like the CTEO and AVI, the DGI can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds, and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. DGIs often have years of prior experience in a previous role such a CTI or CTEO and are trained and certified in Transportation of Dangerous Goods prior to becoming a DGI. ;Commercial Transport Inspector: A legacy role, Commercial Transport Inspectors (CTIs) are responsible for solely operating the stationary vehicle inspections stations and do not operate a mobile patrol vehicle or perform any kind of traffic enforcement. CTIs is responsible for enforcing and ensuring compliance with all applicable acts and regulations that govern the road transportation industry through vehicle, driver and document inspections. CTIs can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. ;Portable Inspector: A Legacy role, Portable Inspectors (PIs) are responsible for operating a mobile patrol vehicle for traffic enforcement and vehicles inspection duties and are restricted from operating a stationary inspection station. PIs are responsible for enforcing and ensuring compliance with all applicable acts and regulations that govern the road transportation industry through roadside vehicle, driver and document inspections as well as providing road safety through traffic enforcement and safety checks. The PI can issue warnings, appearance notices, violation tickets, out-of-service declarations, order mechanical inspections, driver license suspensions, vehicle impounds and may delay or detain vehicles and/or drivers. Selection & Recruitment CVSE officers of all roles are hand selected through a multi-step recruitment process which is handled by regional CVSE managers and the BC Public Service Agency. When a posting is open, an applicant must apply online and if selected must attend and pass the following: one or more aptitude tests involving all applicable legislation and the history, vision, and goals of the CVSE, a physical test involving work based scenarios and a driving assessment with an experienced CVSE officer. Upon successful completion, an applicant is then invited to a panel interview involving various members of the agency. An applicant will then go through a reference check and a security clearance involving a criminal record check and a background investigation through the Office of the Solicitor General and the Ministry of Justice.\\"Employment with CVSE\\" cvse.ca Retrieved November 24, 2015 Training CVSE Patrol car with lights activated at a traffic stop.CVSE officers receive a large variety of training that is delivered through local police forces, in-house instruction, on-the-job training and the Justice Institute of British Columbia.

It was Swayne Latham, crippled and confined to the sideline for the early part of the game, who intercepted the ball and broke around right end. Commodores mowed down a path as he fought his way into the clear. On he raced up the sideline, 50, 60, 70, 80 yards to Virginia's 15, where his injured ankle could no longer outdistance Virginia's defense. A tackler threw him to earth. The official called the play back. Both teams were off-side. The greatest run of the season went for naught.\\" Personal He married miss Nathalie Davant on October 18, 1922.

The workshop has a number of staff and can modify and build vehicles. As of 2015, the site has expanded to house more vehicles.  Tiger 1 replica  In 2016, the museum workshop undertook construction of a Tiger 1 replica. This utilised a highly accurate, partially constructed Tiger 1 that was originally constructed for the movie Fury, which in itself was an accurate replica of Tiger 131. The reconstruction utilised that upper portion of the Tiger, and also referenced original tiger parts the museum had purchased to make the whole tank. The bottom chassis was strengthened to be able to run, the first time the museum had produced its own tank from scratch. The Tiger reproduction uses a Scania truck engine. The running gear is T55 (Track,support arms and torsion bars) M110 Road wheels and the drive/ steering component is from a T62, but it is outwardly a running, almost completely accurate Tiger 1, except that the front drive sprocket (which due to the T62 T/case sits 200mm too high) and T55 Track. It was completed in November 2016, and is the only reproduction tank of this scale to be completed in Australia.

Alternatiba in Caen. Alternatiba (¬´ Alternative ¬ª, in Basque languageD√©finition d'alternatiba dans le dictionnaire Elhuyar) is a framework to mobilise society to face the challenges of climate change. Numerous Alternatiba events, which provide hundreds of alternatives in order to raise people's awareness and to stimulate behaviour change, have been or will be organised in over sixty different French and European cities. Additionally, these initiatives aim to put pressure on politicians, especially before the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris (and the next United Nations Climate Change conferences).  History  The first Alternatiba, village of Alternatives, took place in Bayonne on 5‚Äì6 October 2013. It was initiated by the Basque environmental organization Bizi!, and gathered over 12.000 people. Following the failure of the Copenhagen Summit in 2009, they felt it was time to show \\"European citizens that everything cannot be expected from political decisions at a higher level. We should start at the base, right where we live, with practical initiatives: eco-construction, short distribution chain, renewable energies, organic food, local money, etc. A list that should certainly not be restrictive in order to create a European citizen dynamic\\".According what said an organizer of this event. See Article, La Vie, 6 October 2013. In a festive and friendly atmosphere, the visitors were able to discover that \\"solutions exist; they are already put into effect by thousands of associations, local communities and individuals. Even better: these alternatives contribute to a more pleasant society where solidarity, justice and people matter.Reporterre, 6 October 2013.‚Äù The first village hosted 50 conferences and 15 thematic areas with workshops and stands, as well as a vast number of artistic and educational activities.

Method and tools  The organization of the different Alternatiba collective reflect the experience gained by Bizi ! Cross-sectoral commissions decide on the location of the event, liaise with local governments and manage the funds. Organization relies on the work of a large number of volunteers. Thematic committees concentrate on the content of the event and the organization of the thematic areas. At almost every Alternatiba, a climate area is introduced as well as different thematic areas concerning the use of natural and energy resources such as transport, energy, agriculture, food, and also areas dedicated to alternative lifestyles and culture, education, solidarity, shared goods, sustainable development, the necessity of international environmental justice, for example.

He was a founder of the South Australian Total Abstinence Society. History William Owen and his wife Christina (n√©e Cock) emigrated to South Australia from London in 1838 on the Rajasthan arriving on 16 November 1838. Sometimes referred to as \\"Captain Owen\\", he was in business as a produce merchant in Rosina Street then, from 1847, Pirie Street Adelaide. He spent a year in the Swan River Colony, at least partly in the hope that a \\"change of air\\" would be beneficial to his wife, who was suffering from tuberculosis. During this time he built up business contacts and exported goods and timber to his Adelaide store, which was being managed by J. J. Warner. In conjunction with A. L. Elder, he chartered the 94 ton brigantine Emma Sherratt for a sugar buying expedition, a consequence of which was a libel suit by Owen against competitor William Younghusband. Owen won the case but was awarded only ¬£20 damages. The Emma Sherratt a half share of which Owen purchased from Sherratt, was the subject of further disputes, and was lost near Samoa in December 1850. Another of Owen's ships, the 140 ton brig Arpenteur, was wrecked in 1849 with a huge loss of cargo, but without loss of life in either case. He was, from his earliest days in South Australia, a prominent activist in the cause of Total abstinence, a Rechabite and founder of the South Australian Total Abstinence Society, serving as President or Vice-president for many years. He left the colony with his family in 1855 for England and America They returned in February 1858, but Mr. Owen did not resume his old business, but made several trips to the Fiji Islands, following which he made a series of public lectures. He was elected on a platform of Free Trade and Free Immigration for the seat of City of Adelaide in the South Australian House of Assembly to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of William Henville Burford, and served from May 1859 to March 1860, when he announced his intention not to contest that or any other seat in the next election. He was however nominated for the seat of Port Adelaide, and without any effort or expense on his part was returned at the head of the poll, and served from March 1860 to March 1862, roughly contemporary with fellow abstainer G. W. Cole. Sometime in the late 1850s, Owen purchased the island of Kioa from the local Chief; a deed signed by him, and another signed by his son were lodged with the British Consul for Fiji. The Fiji Pastoral, Agricultural and Commercial Company, provisional manager David Wilkinson (c. 1832 ‚Äì 8 January 1910), was formed to exploit the country's largely untapped natural resources of timber, arrowroot, cotton, coconut, tobacco and so on. It was envisaged that the natives would be pleased to act as virtual slaves for the owners. (When Fiji became a British colony, Wilkinson, who had a strong command of the language, was appointed Chief Interpreter for the government, later Commissioner of Native Lands.) The company did not receive enthusiastic public support and appears to have quietly folded. Owen was appointed by Sir John Young as British Consul for the Fiji Islands, and was later commended by Earl Russell for the manner in which he performed the duties of his office. He died in Melbourne, Victoria during an extended visit to that State. Family He was married to Christina, n√©e Cock ( ‚Äì 4 May 1848), (sister of Robert Cock). Three daughters were born in Adelaide, South Australia: *Jane (22 April 1838 ‚Äì 21 February 1907) married Rev. William Mansley Bennett (1834 ‚Äì 29 June 1916). They had five children: Millicent Mary, William Owen, Beverley Mansley, Lina Ashley and Evan Owen. *Catherine (known as Catherine Christina) (4 April 1841 ‚Äì 22 October 1905) married Rev. Peter Roe Clarke Ussher (26 March 1834 ‚Äì 23 March 1899) on 1 March 1862 *Christina (29 February 1848 ‚Äì ) He married again, on 11 October 1850, to Isabella Sanders (c. 1803 ‚Äì 30 March 1870). She had two daughters with James Sanders: Christiana or Christina Blackwood Sanders (c. 1844 ‚Äì 20 August 1920), who married James Miller Anderson on 12 February 1862, and Emma Eliza Sanders. Her last residence was Jeffcott Street, North Adelaide. They had a home in Kent Town, South Australia. His last residence was 1 Elgin Street, Carlton, Victoria where he died.

He added that some of the information in the book is not \\"complete\\" or \\"fully accurate\\", in particular the chapter discussing the CIA infiltrating organisations. The Baumols concluded that the book has a lot of detail which is not necessary for Saunders' arguments and repetition that \\"gives the reader a sense of wallowing through a dense landscape, looking for the fascinating nuggets of history that are certainly there.\\"Baumol and Baumol, p. 75. The Baumols argued that, based on the contents of the book, the CIA had a \\"surprisingly benign\\" impact, in contradiction with what they believed Saunders would conclude, and that the book \\"suggests that [the CIA's] role in the arts was considerably less damaging than might reasonably have been feared.\\" Paul Buhle of Brown University described Who Paid the Piper? as being the \\"most spectacular\\" book recently released about the involvement of CIA and intellectuals; Buhle stated that compared to Freiheit in der Offensive? by Michael Hochgeschwender, Who Paid the Piper? has fewer footnotes but more \\"charisma\\" and \\"verve\\". Gow wrote that even though the author had a negative attitude towards the CIA activities, the book has a \\"triumph\\" since \\"she shows men like [CIA employee Tom Braden, who headed the program] to have been unsung heroes of the Cold War, as well as masters of art in both cultural warfare and cultural appreciation.\\" Jeffrey C. Isaac criticized the book, saying that it was \\"shrill\\" and with a \\"prosecutorial tone,\\" that it had arguments without \\"nuance,\\" that it did not \\"grapple in a serious way with the ideas that were the chief currency of those it purports to study\\", and that it did not consider the importance and the need to secure \\"liberal values and institutions\\". Jeremy Isaacs in The Spectator wrote that the book has portions that are humorous, citing reactions to figures who learned that they were subsidised by the CIA. He concluded that it was a \\"hammer-blow of a book\\".Isaacs. Joffe criticised the book for equating the U.S. propaganda efforts with those from the USSR in a \\"a strident anti-anti-Communism that refuses to accord the Western cause the moral worth it deserves, considering the wares the totalitarians were hawking.\\" He characterized the book as having \\"careless sourcing\\" and \\"ad hominem slurs\\". Roazen described the book as \\"highly readable\\" and \\"fascinating\\". Mary Carroll of Booklist described the book as having a \\"European point of view\\".Carroll, p. 1506. William and Hilda Baumol, in their book review, wrote that Saunders \\"generally avoids explicit judgments, seeking to be dispassionate in her account.\\"Baumol and Baumol, p. 73. James Gow of King's College, London stated that Saunders had a negative tone towards the CIA activities and a \\"churlish attitude\\". Reviewing the book for Studies in Intelligence, former CIA official and historian Thomas M. Troy Jr. wrote \\"Saunders deserves praise for presenting opposing views\\" and that she did \\"a fine job in recounting the intriguing story of how the CIA worked with existing institutions\\", but added that the book \\"has some major shortcomings\\" and \\"contains some silly mistakes and some real gaffes\\". Troy stated that Saunders \\"repeatedly returns to the theme that the CIA injured the cause of intellectual freedom by clandestinely supporting (oh, irony of ironies!) champions of intellectual freedom.\\" Touching on what he perceived to be the books shortcomings, he wrote \\"despite Saunders's assertions that the CIA undermined intellectual freedom, she does not present any examples of people whose intellectual growth was stunted or impaired because of the Agency's programs\\" and mentioned that she failed to substantial discuss Soviet actions during the Cold War that would have helped readers to understand those of the CIA. While taking issue with the book's content and conclusions, Troy summarized \\"I highly enjoyed and strongly recommend her book\\".

He was drafted as the number one pick in the 2014 AFL draft. Football career McCartin finished his education at Geelong Grammar on a football scholarship after attending St Joseph's College, Geelong from years 7 to 10. He played junior football for the Geelong Falcons in the TAC Cup and Victoria Country at the AFL Under 18 Championships. He made his AFL debut in round 3 of the 2015 AFL season in St Kilda's loss against . He was selected as a late replacement for St Kilda captain Nick Riewoldt who pulled out due to a calf injury. McCartin finished the 2015 season with 6 senior games and 3 goals to his name. Prior to the 2016 season, he signed a two year contract extension which would keep him at the club until at least the end of the 2018 season. McCartin's 2016 season was interrupted by injury, including 3 separate concussions. The first concussion was suffered in St Kilda's round 3 win against Collingwood at the MCG, which kept him out of the senior team until his return in Round 9 against Essendon. Subsequent concussions were suffered in Round 11 against Adelaide and Round 15 against Gold Coast and finally a collision with Nick Vlastuin of Richmond in Round 22 led to McCartin sustaining a broken collarbone. Due to these injuries, McCartin was restricted to 11 games in 2016, adding 14 goals to his career total. Playing for St Kilda's VFL affiliate club Sandringham in June 2017, McCartin suffered a further concussion. This was McCartin's 6th concussion in 4 years. He finished 2017 with only 5 senior AFL games. McCartin's 8th concussion since 2014 came in a JLT Community Series match against the Western Bulldogs in March 2019. McCartin ultimately did not play a senior game for St Kilda in 2019. He was delisted by St Kilda at the conclusion of the 2019 AFL season to allow him to deal with complications resulting from repeated concussions. St Kilda head of football Simon Lethlean stated that the club would be open to re-adding McCartin to their list after a break in 2020. Personal life His younger brother, Tom, was drafted by the Sydney Swans at pick number 33 in the 2017 AFL draft. The two brothers first played against each other in Round 12 2018 at Docklands Stadium. At age nine, McCartin was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.

It had unique additions in that it had a bolt guide (much like the M1870 Italian Vetterli) and the \\"progressive rifling\\" that was developed by Koka. The Kingdom of Serbia adopted the rifle in 1881. It was designated Serbian Model 1878/80, also known as Mauser-Koka, Mauser-Milovanoviƒá, and known in Serbian as Kokinka (–ö–æ–∫–∏–Ω–∫–∞). The grooves reduced in diameter from breech to muzzle. The muzzle velocity of the Mauser- Milanoviƒá was . It saw first combat in the Serbo-Bulgarian War. Approximately 110,000 Mauser-Milovanoviƒá rifles entered the Serbian arsenal. It was further developed in 1907. Mauser-Koka 1884 The Mauser Model 1884 \\"Artillery Carbine\\" was produced in 1884 in 4,000 units at the Oberndorf plant for the use of the Serbian cavalry. It was based on the M71/84 and had a five-round tubular magazine. In the late 1930s, all remaining Model 1884 carbines were converted to the 1870s vintage 13.78mm \\"LAK\\" cartridge, which was in good supply in Yugoslav Army depots. Mauser-Koka-ƒêuriƒá Starting 1907, about half of the Mauser-Koka inventory was converted in Kragujevac to shoot the 7√ó57mm from a 5-shot magazine; the new barrels were purchased from Steyr.

Venmo account holders can transfer funds to others via a mobile phone app; both the sender and receiver have to live in the U.S. It handled $12 billion in transactions in the first quarter of 2018. Venmo was launched in 2009 targeting the use case of friends splitting bills, e.g. for movies, dinner, rent, tickets, etc. By default, Venmo publishes every peer-to-peer transaction (excluding the amount), a feature which was shown by researchers to reveal sensitive details about users' lives in some situations. In 2018, the company settled with the FTC about several privacy and security violations related to this and other features, and made changes to the corresponding settings, but it continued to attract criticism for exposing users to privacy risks. Since 2008, cash transfers using Venmo have not been instantaneous and could be canceled after an initial transfer is sent. Like traditional wire transfers, they can take one to three business days to become final. In January 2018, PayPal rolled out an instant transfer feature on Venmo, allowing users to deposit funds to their debit cards typically within 30 minutes. A fee is deducted from the amount for each transfer; 1% or $10, whichever is less. The standard bank transfer (typically completed within 1‚Äì3 business days) is available for no fee. Product Users can create an account via a mobile app or website and provide basic information and bank account information. One must have a valid email address and an American mobile phone number to use Venmo. Recipients of transactions can be found via phone number, Venmo username, or email. Users have a Venmo balance that is used for their transactions. They can link their bank accounts, debit cards, or credit cards, to their Venmo account; alternatively users can order a Venmo MasterCard and pay through it. Paying with a bank account or debit card is free, but payments via credit card have a 3% fee for each transaction. Some credit card providers may charge cash advance fees for Venmo payments. If a user does not have enough funds in the account when making a transaction, it will automatically withdraw the necessary funds from the registered bank account or card. Users get rewards into their accounts when Venmo is used with selected merchants. Through Venmo Rewards Program, they can use these by bank account transfer or debit card and merchants in-app. When users first create an account, total transactions cannot exceed $299.99 until their identity is verified. After their identity has been verified, users can send up to $2,999.99 in each seven day period.  Venmo MasterCard  In 2018, Venmo released a new physical debit card available for users. The card runs on the MasterCard network and offers ATM access and overdraft protection. It can be used anywhere that accepts MasterCard, and it enables up to $400 in daily ATM withdrawals, though transactions at non-MoneyPass ATMs come with at least $2.50 in withdrawal fees. In addition, the service offers a reload function, which, when enabled, takes money from a user's linked checking account in $10 increments if their Venmo balance drops too low to cover a purchase. Customers could be subject to fees or other consequences from their bank if they overdraft that account. Card purchases show up in a user's Venmo transaction history, and the card can be canceled from within the app. These features make the card similar to a traditional bank debit card, but adds the ability to directly track spending in-app.  Social component and privacy concerns  Social feed of transactions on Venmo Venmo includes social networking interaction; it was created so friends could quickly split bills, whether that is for movies, dinner, rent, tickets, etc. When a user makes a transaction, the transaction details (stripped of the payment amount) are shared on the user's \\"news feed\\" and to the user's network of friends. This mimics that of a social media feed. There is a \\"world wide\\" Venmo feed, a \\"friends only\\" feed, and then personal feed. Venmo encourages social interaction on the application through comments using jokes or emojis and/or likes. Early on, Venmo required new users to sign up through Facebook, which made it easy to find peers they wanted to pay and also provided Venmo with free marketing. For users not friends on Facebook, the application allowed the opportunity to search by username and phone number. Profiles are personalized with profile pictures, usernames and Venmo transaction history. The transactions can be made private, but most users keep the default and do not change the privacy settings. Venmo does not have either buyer or seller protection. Venmo includes three social feeds: a public feed, a friends feed, and a private feed. By default, all Venmo transactions are shared publicly. Anyone who opens the app to the public feed, including people who do not themselves use Venmo, can see these publicly shared posts. The privacy settings can be changed so that all posts are either shared only with a user's Venmo contacts, or even kept private. If posts are shared only with contacts, they still appear in a friends feed, whereas private transactions are only visible to the two parties involved in the transaction. If two users involved in a single transaction have differing privacy settings, Venmo applies the more restrictive level. Users can override their overall preference for any individual transaction, including after the transaction has been made. A 2018 study analyzed over 200 million public transactions and found that Venmo \\"reveals a massive amount of private details about users' lives by default\\". The same year, the company reached a settlement with the FTC after the FTC had accused Venmo of \\"misleading\\" users about the privacy settings changes required to make transactions completely private. In 2019, another researcher downloaded and analyzed seven million transactions, concluding that although Venmo had made some minor improvements limiting mass- scraping, the data still put users at risk for various forms of cyberattacks. In 2019, Mozilla and the Electronic Frontier Foundation wrote an open letter \\"to express our deep concern about Venmo's disregard for the importance of user privacy, and to call on Venmo to make two critical changes to its privacy settings: make transactions private by default, and give users privacy settings for their friend lists\\". Each transaction includes a description of what the payment is for in text, emoji, or both. This description is required to complete the transaction, but Venmo does not enforce content requirements (e.g., someone could describe the transaction as \\"nothing\\"). Venmo recommends emoji when a common expense is entered as the description. Overall, 30% of Venmo transactions include at least one emoji. Regardless of a transaction's privacy, only the two people involved in a transaction can see the transaction's amount. Transactions are persistent within the feed and scroll infinitely. A previous transaction may be difficult to revisit if a user or their contacts have many transactions. Venmo's social model has attracted attention from researchers. A research group from University of Washington observes that the social feed in Venmo differs from other social networks in that activity is driven by financial transactions. A user could make a trivial transaction to make a post (e.g., sending someone $0.01, or requesting $0.02), but only one participant in their studies reported ever doing this. Further, neither reading the feed nor sharing a transaction memo publicly or with friends is necessary to send or receive money. On Venmo, people transact with both friends and businesses via the app. Analysis of public transactions identifies a spectrum of use patterns, from regular users who create transactions for a variety of expenses, to niche users who use Venmo with a small cluster of friends to pay for just a few things (e.g., bills among roommates). Security Venmo has claimed that its security is bank-grade, and that personal and financial data are encrypted and protected on secure servers to guard against any unauthorized transactions. However, journalists, security researchers, the California Department of Business Oversight (DBO) and the Federal Trade Commission have all disputed these claims.Demos, Telis \\"You Accidentally Sent $149 to a Stranger on Venmo? Good Luck Getting It Back,\\" July 12, 2018 Wall Street Journal retrieved February 11, 2020Episode 922: \\"The Cost Of Getting Your Money Back,\\" June 26, 2019, Planet Money on National Public Radio retrieved February 11, 2020 In February 2018, the FTC settled with Venmo, after an investigation uncovered false representations about \\"bank grade\\" security and failures to comply with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Safeguards Rule and Privacy Rule. Under the settlement, Venmo will be required to undergo third-party audits every two years for the next ten years. The FTC also complained that Venmo \\"misled consumers about the extent to which they could control the privacy of their transactions\\" and misrepresented the availability of funds for withdrawal. Venmo states that customers need not worry about their security or privacy, and encourages users to set up a PIN to increase security. On July 17, 2018, The Guardian published an article showing that Venmo is insecure because privacy protection is not set by default. According to the researcher who found this privacy issue, Venmo publishes all transactions along with names openly into the World Wide Web. The Better Business Bureau has reported that some scammers exploit the cancellation period to appear to pay, but ultimately avoid paying for an item. In November 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported that Venmo, in the first quarter of 2018, had suffered $40 million in operating losses‚Äînearly 40% more than it had budgeted for‚Äîdue to \\"a wave of payments fraud\\". History Venmo quarterly US payment volume and annual growth Venmo was founded by Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail, who met as freshman roommates at the University of Pennsylvania. According to Kortina, the duo were initially inspired to create a transaction solution while, in the process of helping start a friend's yogurt shop, they \\"realized how horrible traditional point of sales software was\\". At a local jazz show, Kortina and Magdon-Ismail conceived the idea of instantly buying an MP3 of the show via text message. Finally, the idea was cemented when Magdon-Ismail forgot his wallet during a trip to visit Kortina. The process of settling their debt was a considerable inconvenience, especially compared to the possibility of mobile phone-based transactions. Shortly after, they began working on a way to send money through mobile phones. Their original prototype sent money through text messages, but they eventually transitioned from text messages to a smartphone app. In May 2010, the company raised $1.2 million of seed money in a financing round led by RRE Ventures. In 2012, the company was acquired by Braintree for $26.2 million. In December 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million. Prior to October 2015, Venmo prohibited merchants from accepting Venmo payments. On January 27, 2016, PayPal announced that Venmo was working with select merchants who would accept Venmo as payment. Initial launch partners included Munchery and Gametime. All merchants that accept PayPal can now accept Venmo. As of May 2018, Venmo's merchant product did not permit \\"selling goods or services in person\\"; however, research into mobile payment trends among mom-and-pop restaurants in New York City that month revealed a grey market use case whereby some Chinese takeouts and food trucks used personal Venmo QR codes to accept payments from customers. This QR payment behavior was similar to that used via Chinese mobile applications WeChat and Alipay within these same establishments.

Al-Walid belonged to the Banu Makhzum clan of the Quraysh tribe of Mecca and was a brother of the prominent Muslim commander Khalid ibn al-Walid. He fought with the Quraysh against Muhammad at the Battle of Badr in 624, during which many of his clansmen were slain. He was captured by the Muslims during the battle, but was released and embraced Islam. Upon his return to Mecca, he was shackled and imprisoned. According to the history of al-Tabari (d. 923), al-Walid and his Makhzumite kinsmen Salama ibn Hisham (a brother of Abu Jahl) and Ayyash ibn Abi Rabi'a emigrated from Mecca to join Muhammad and his followers in Medina, where he later died of heart failure. He was mourned by Muhammad's Makhzumite wife Umm Salama, who recited: > For al-Walƒ´d b. al-Walƒ´d b. al-Mughƒ´rah, O my eye, let your tears flow, > The likes of al-Walƒ´d b. al-Walƒ´d Ab≈´ al-Walƒ´d protect the clan [against > its foe]. Al-Walid's eldest son was also called al-Walid. Muhammad, considering the Makhzum's usage of this name to be excessive, changed the younger al-Walid's name to Abd Allah. Abd Allah's descendants became a prominent family in Medina and inherited the properties of Khalid ibn al-Walid after the deaths of his last descendants in because they were the closest blood relatives of the prominent commander, and continued to be in possession of the properties at least through the late 9th century.

Bothy Songs and Ballads. Edinburgh: John Donald. Usually slow in tempo, ballads tend to have a lush musical arrangement which emphasizes the song's melody and harmonies. Characteristically, ballads use acoustic instruments such as guitars, pianos, saxophones, and sometimes an orchestral set. Many modern mainstream ballads tend to feature synthesizers, drum machines and even, to some extent, a dance rhythm. Sentimental ballads had their origins in the early Tin Pan Alley music industry of the later 19th century.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock (Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), p. 378. Initially known as \\"tear-jerkers\\" or \\"drawing-room ballads\\", they were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an opera, descendants perhaps of broadside ballads. As new genres of music began to emerge in the early 20th century, their popularity faded, but the association with sentimentality led to the term ballad being used for a slow love song from the 1950s onwards.Witmer. See also Middleton (I,4,i). History Early history Sentimental ballads have their roots from medieval French chanson ballad√©e or ballade, which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa.W. Apel, Harvard Dictionary of Music (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.A. Jacobs, A Short History of Western Music (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.W. Apel, Harvard Dictionary of Music (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72. As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from Scandinavian and Germanic traditions of storytelling.J. E. Housman, British Popular Ballads (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15. Musically they were influenced by the Minnesinger.A. Jacobs, A Short History of Western Music (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20. The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in England is \\"Judas\\" in a 13th-century manuscript.A. N. Bold, The Ballad (Routledge, 1979), p. 5. A reference in William Langland's Piers Plowman indicates that ballads about Robin Hood were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is Wynkyn de Worde's collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45. 18th century ‚Äì early 20th century After the Ball, a ballad by Charles K. Harris, was the most successful song of its era, selling over two million copies of sheet music.\\"'After the Ball': Lyrics from the Biggest Hit of the 1890s\\", History Matters Ballads at this time were originally composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.\\"Popular Ballads\\", The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century, p. 610. In the 18th century, ballad operas developed as a form of English stage entertainment, partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.M. Lubbock, The Complete Book of Light Opera (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music.D. Head and I. Ousby, The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66. In the late 19th century, Danish folklorist Svend Grundtvig and Harvard professor Francis James Child attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as The English and Scottish Popular Ballads.T. A. Green, Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352. There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous. By the Victorian era, ballad had come to mean any sentimental popular song, especially so-called \\"royalty ballads\\".Child, F., J. (1898). The English and Scottish Popular Ballads, Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co Some of Stephen Foster's songs exemplify this genre. By the 1920s, composers of Tin Pan Alley and Broadway used ballad to signify a slow, sentimental tune or love song, often written in a fairly standardized form. Jazz musicians sometimes broaden the term still further to embrace all slow-tempo pieces.Temperley (II,2). Notable sentimental ballads of this period include, \\"Little Rosewood Casket\\" (1870), \\"After the Ball\\" (1892), and \\"Danny Boy\\" (1913).N. Cohen, Folk Music: a Regional Exploration (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297. 1950s‚Äì1960s In 1962, Frank Sinatra released Sinatra and Strings, a set of standard ballads, which became one of the most critically acclaimed works of Sinatra's entire Reprise period. Popular sentimental ballad vocalists in this era include Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Andy Williams, Johnny Mathis, Connie Francis and Perry Como. Their recordings were usually lush orchestral arrangements of current or recent rock and roll or pop hit songs. The most popular and enduring songs from this style of music are known as \\"pop standards\\" or (where relevant) \\"American standards\\". Many vocalists became involved in 1960s' vocal jazz and the rebirth of swing music, which was sometimes referred to as \\"easy listening\\" and was, in essence, a revival of popularity of the \\"sweet bands\\" that had been popular during the swing era, but with more emphasis on the vocalist and the sentimentality. 1970s Soft rock, a subgenre that mainly consists of ballads, was derived from folk rock in the late 1960s, using acoustic instruments and putting more emphasis on melody and harmonies. Major sentimental ballad artists of this decade included Barbra Streisand, Nana Mouskouri, Elton John, Engelbert Humperdinck, Carole King, Cat Stevens and James Taylor. By the early 1970s, softer ballad songs by the Carpenters, Anne Murray, John Denver and Barry Manilow began to be played more often on \\"Top 40\\" radio. \\"Journey fans can easily list a dozen soft rock ballads from the band...\\" Some rock-oriented acts such as Queen and the Eagles also produced ballads. When the word ballad appears in the title of a song, as for example in the Beatles' \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\" (1969) or Billy Joel's \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" (1974), the folk music sense is generally implied. The term ballad is also sometimes applied to strophic story-songs more generally, such as Don McLean's \\"American Pie\\" (1971).D. R. Adams, Rock 'n' roll and the Cleveland Connection Music of the Great Lakes (Kent State University Press, 2002), , p. 70.C. H. Sterling, M. C. Keith, Sounds of Change: a History of FM broadcasting in America (UNC Press, 2008), pp. 136-7. 1980s‚Äì1990s Celine Dion's albums were generally constructed on the basis of melodramatic soft rock ballads, with sprinklings of uptempo pop and rare forays into other genres.Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [ Let's Talk About Love: Album review]. Allmusic. Retrieved 12 October 2009. Prominent artists who made sentimental ballads in the 1980s include Stevie Wonder, Lionel Richie, Peabo Bryson, Barry White, Luther Vandross and George Michael. The 1990s mainstream pop/R&B; singers such as Boyz II Men, Celine Dion, Shania Twain, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey. Newer female singer-songwriters such as Sarah McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, Jewel, Melissa Etheridge and Sheryl Crow also broke through on the AC chart during this time owing to their ballad- sound.Hyatt, Wesley (1999). The Billboard Book of Number One Adult Contemporary Hits. New York City: Billboard Books. . 2000s A popular trend in the early 2000s was remixing dance music hits into acoustic ballads (for example, the \\"Candlelight Mix\\" versions of \\"Heaven\\" by DJ Sammy, \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" by D.H.T., and \\"Everytime We Touch\\" by Cascada).Whitburn, Joel (2007). Billboard Top Adult Songs 1961-2006 (Record Research Inc.), page 373. 2010s In the 2010s, indie musicians like Imagine Dragons, Mumford & Sons, Of Monsters and Men, the Lumineers and Ed Sheeran had indie songs that crossed over to the adult contemporary charts, due to their ballad-heavy sound. Genres Jazz and traditional pop Most pop standard and jazz ballads are built from a single, introductory verse, usually around 16 bars in length, and they end on the dominant ‚Äì the chorus or refrain, usually 16 or 32 bars long and in AABA form (though other forms, such as ABAC, are not uncommon). In AABA forms, the B section is usually referred to as the bridge; often a brief coda, sometimes based on material from the bridge, is added, as in \\"Over the Rainbow\\".D. Randel, The New Harvard Dictionary of Music, (Cambridge MS: Harvard University Press, 1986) , p. 68.Buchan, D. (1972). The Ballad and the Folk. East Linton: Tuckwell Press Pop and R&B; ballads The most common use of the term \\"ballad\\" in modern pop and R&B; music is for an emotional song about romance, breakup and/or longing. The singer would usually lament an unrequited or lost love, either where one party is oblivious to the existence of the other, where one party has moved on, or where a romantic affair has affected the relationship.Smith, L.: Elvis Costello, Joni Mitchell, and the Torch Song Tradition, p. 9. Praeger Publishers, 2004.Allan Forte, M. R.: Listening to Classic American Popular Songs, p. 203. Yale University Press, 2001. Power ballads Simon Frith, the British sociomusicologist and former rock critic, identifies the origins of the power ballad in the emotional singing of soul artists, particularly Ray Charles, and the adaptation of this style by performers such as Eric Burdon, Tom Jones, and Joe Cocker to produce slow-tempo songs often building to a loud and emotive chorus backed by drums, electric guitars, and sometimes choirs. According to Charles Aaron, power ballads came into existence in the early 1970s, when rock stars attempted to convey profound messages to audiences. Aaron argues that the power ballad broke into the mainstream of American consciousness in 1976 as FM radio gave a new lease of life to earlier songs such as Badfinger's \\"Without You\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\", and Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Free Bird\\". The Carpenters' \\"Goodbye to Love\\" has also been identified as a prototype of the power ballad. Later power ballads include Queen's \\"Love of My Life\\" (1975), \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" (1986) and \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" (1995); Metallica's \\"One\\" (1988), \\"The Unforgiven\\" (1991) and \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" (1991); Nazareth's \\"Love Hurts\\" (1974);S.

Latin ballad Luis Miguel in Mexico City. Latin ballad refers to the ballad derived from bolero that originated in the early-1960s in Latin America and Spain. One of the most well-known Latin ballad singers of the 1970s and 1980s was Jos√© Jos√©. Known as \\"El Principe de La Cancion\\" (The Prince of the Song), he sold over 40 million albums in his career and became a huge influence to later ballad singers such as Cristian Castro, Alejandro Fern√°ndez, Nelson Ned, Manuel Mijares and Lupita D'Alessio.

After Sher Shah Suri defeated Humayun, he occupied Purana Qila. There, he built the mosque for his private use, which became a \\"symbol of his royal aspiration\\". The mosque is believed to have been constructed .  Location  The mosque is located inside Sher Shah Suri's fort, Purana Qila, which became his fortification after he won Delhi. It is one of the structures beside the Sher Mandal (which is attributed as Humayun's library) present in the fort. The fort is located near the Delhi zoo.  History  The mosque's history is derived from various accounts of contemporary historians. The Tarikh-i-Sher Shahi, written by Abbas Sarwani, says that Sher Shah Suri built the mosque in 1540, from \\"gold, lapis lazuli\\" and other precious stones. He is said to have built the mosque to \\"revive\\" the city's status \\"as a major city\\". Historian MC Joshi argues that although Sher Shah completed the mosque, it was originally \\"designed\\" and its construction was started by Humayun. Joshi believes that Sher Shah built the upper part of the mosque which included the dome. The marble works of the exterior walls could be attributed to his son Akbar, because the geometric works are of his time and not of pre-Akbar era. The use of half-dome, pointed arches represents \\"A strong Mughal association\\". Humayun is credited with \\"introducing pietra dura\\" works in the liwan and mihrab.  Features  Entrance of mosque The mosque is built in the Afghan style of a congregational mosque. It is a symbol of the architectural tradition of \\"a five bay mosque\\", a concept which was developed during the Sayyid and Lodi dynasty times. The mosque lacks any inscription. Its length and breadth is and , respectively. It has a height of (which includes the dome). The mosque was built by \\"core masonry\\" with stone rubble \\"bonded with lime mortar\\". Blocks of quartzite, marble and red sandstone were also used in the construction process. The internal rectilinear hall is laterally divided by five arches. The external facade comprises the same number of arches. The central arch is sunken \\"in an arched recess\\" which is contained within a rectangular frontage called liwan. The mosque was originally intended to be constructed from marble but as it ran out of supply, red sandstone had to be used. From the liwan rises the dome, built in the Lodi style, flanked by small minarets called guldastas (flower bouquets). The dome on the central bay has a kalash finial on top. There are also \\"multiple openings\\" in the \\"drum\\" for ventilation and is decorated with intricate tile work. The internal part of the mosque has five mihrabs, one in each bay, corresponding to the external facade. The mihrabs, with alternate fark and light coloured stones, are similar to that of the Atala Masjid in Jaunpur. Flat domes are present on the \\"penultimate bays\\". The end bays are oblong in shape but the penultimate ones are square shaped. There are two half arches in the last bay which tangentially spring from the \\"shoulders of lateral arches\\", resulting in the creation of three spaces spanned with a cross-rib arrangement. There is a shallow dome in the central space, whereas the eastern and western arcades have semi-domes called \\"nim- gumbad\\" which rest on \\"suspending arches\\". Two octagonal turrets are attached to the ends of the rear wall, \\"which are functional as well as structural\\". In the edifice, objects reminiscent of Tughlaq architecture (decorative brackets with oriel windows, sunshades, narrow turrets) are found. The walls are ornamented with hexagonal star motifs which have coloured geometric patterns. The walls are filled with calligraphy. The mosque has two internal staircases located in the end bays. They were used to reach the terrace and the turrets. It also had private entrances on the north and south sides which are currently closed. The mosque also has \\"cusped entrance arches\\", a feature common during the reign of Alauddin Khalji.

Description Benson described the shell of Carinaria galea in detail as \\"Shell dextral, with the last whorl incurved, compressed, conical, nearly embracing the terminal spire, marked with transverse rugae, broadly keeled. Keel with very oblique rugae, which are curved upwards in the direction of the spire. Aperture transverse, ovate, narrowed towards the keel.\\" It is a large snail reaching a total body length of . The shell is conical, taller than it is wide, and has a well-developed keel. The body is slender and cylindrical and cannot be retracted into the shell. It has a thin skin with a few large tubercles. The body is transparent and the mouthparts, gut and dark retinas can easily be seen. A pigmented area containing the main body organs is concealed in the shell alongside about six gills. The tail region has a low crest. On the opposite side of the animal to the shell is a large rounded swimming fin with a sucker. The animal swims by undulating the fin from side to side.

Some of the characteristics of this species make it difficult to classify at the genus level. After it was originally described in 1984 as Melaleuca punicea, it was transferred in 1986 to the genus Regelia (as Regelia punicea) but it did not fit well in that genus either. In 1999 it was transferred again to a new genus Petraeomyrtus as P. punicea. Subsequent molecular studies, especially of chloroplast DNA have suggested that it is best placed in Melaleuca along with others from genera including Beaufortia, Callistemon and Regelia. Later publications include this species as Melaleuca punicea. Description Melaleuca punicea is a spreading shrub growing to about tall. Its leaves are long and wide, with no apparent stalk, narrow triangular in shape, and almost crescent shape in cross section. The flowers are bright red or orange-red and are arranged in heads containing up to 15 individual flowers. The stamens are in five bundles around the flowers, each bundle containing 9 to 13 stamens. Flowering occurs during the dry season, including from January to November but mainly from June to August and is followed by the fruit, which are cup-shaped capsules, although not as woody as in most other melaleucas. Taxonomy and naming Melaleuca punicea was first formally described in 1984 by Norman Byrnes in Austrobaileya. It was then transferred to the genus Regelia (Regelia punicea (Byrnes) Barlow) then to Petraeomyrtus (Petraeomyrtus punicea (Byrnes) Craven) and finally to the present Melaleuca punicea. The specific epithet (punicea) is from the Latin puniceus meaning \\"purplish-red\\" referring to the colour of the stamens. Distribution and habitat Melaleuca punicea occurs in Arnhem Land on the sandstone escarpments of the Kakadu National Park.

Description Tuberaria lignosa is a perennial herb, often woody towards the base. It reaches a height of and branches freely. Its leaves are simple, long and wide. The inflorescence is lax, with each flower in diameter. Distribution and ecology Tuberaria lignosa is found around the western Mediterranean Basin, in parts of Italy, France, mainland Spain, Portugal, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and the Canary Islands. Taxonomy The species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 work ', as \\"Cistus tuberaria\\". It was later transferred to the genus Helianthemum, and when Michel F√©lix Dunal erected Helianthemum sect. Tuberaria in 1824, he designated \\"Helianthemum tuberaria\\" as its type species. In 1827, Robert Sweet published a description of \\"Helianthemum lignosum\\", but this name was invalid as a junior synonym of H. tuberaria. In 1836, √âdouard Spach raised this subgenus to the rank of genus as Tuberaria; because the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants forbids tautonyms (such as \\"Tuberaria tuberaria\\"), the next oldest available name has to be used. In 1922, Gon√ßalo Sampaio introduced the combination Tuberaria lignosa, which is the name generally used today. Some botanists consider the species part of the genus Xolantha, in which case it is known as Xolantha tuberaria. Medical research The plant has been researched for medical purposes in cancer treatment. An aqueous extract of Tuberaria lignosa inhibited cell growth, altered the cell cycle profile, and induced apoptosis of NCI-H460 Tumor Cells.

It is able to incorporate small guest molecule and has played an important role in host‚Äìguest chemistry and supramolecular chemistry. The cyclophane is also referred to as Stoddart's blue box because its inventor, J. Fraser Stoddart, illustrates the electron-poor areas of molecules in a blue shade.  Synthesis  For synthesis of cyclobis(paraquat-p- phenylene), 4,4'-bipyridine is reacted with 1,4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene to 1,1‚Ä≤-[1,4-phenylenebis-(methylene)]bis(4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine), which is reacted in a template synthesis again with 4,4‚Ä≤-bipyridine to the final product. A common template for this synthesis is 1,5-bis[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]naphthalene. :650px  Host guest chemistry  Cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) is able to incorporate small guest molecules forming a host‚Äìguest complex. The interactions required for complex formation are donor-acceptor interactions and hydrogen bonding, their strength is highly dependent on the ability of the donor to provide œÄ-electron density. Also an enlargement of the œÄ-system enhances the binding. The kinetics of complex formation and dissociation depends on the bulkiness of the guest. One molecule which is able to form stable complexes with cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) is tetrathiafulvalene (TTF). Numerous derivatives are based on the chelating ability of tetrathiafulvalene. The modifications include mechanically entrapped compounds such as catenanes and rotaxanes, molecular switches and larger supramolecular structures. The charge-transfer interactions, present in complexes of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene), can be compared as structural motif with the more commonly used hydrogen bonds, especially in terms of directionality and complementarity (lock-and-key model). Charge-transfer complexes are easier to detect by spectroscopic methods and have a greater tolerance to various solvents, but also generally a lower association constant. Due to the lower association constant many fewer charge transfer complexes are known. Other non-covalent bonds such as solvophobic forces, metal-ligand interaction can be used to increase the association constant; numerous structures based on this strategy are known in literature. It was shown that the choice of the counterion of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) has a large influence on the association constant of the corresponding host‚Äìguest complex. It is often used as hexafluorophosphate salt because in this form it is soluble in organic solvents.  Utilization  To create catenanes, the cyclobis(paraquat-p- phenylene) can be used as a template to \\"thread\\" a crown ether with a œÄ-donor component. Subsequently, its still open ends are linked with each other to obtain two closed rings. A bistable catenane (a ring with two œÄ-donor components) is already a simple example of a molecular switch. In the present example, a cyclic ether has been selected with a TTF and a DNP moiety. While the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) surroundings the TTF unit in the rest position, the DNP unit is stable when the TTF is (reversible) is oxidized. The ring rotates in this case due to the coulomb repulsion around itself until the cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) encloses the DNP unit. A reverse movement occurs when the TTF unit is reduced again. This first example that proved the general feasibility, many more have followed.  Derivates  Numerous derivatives of cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene) have been developed, including an enlarged version of the molecule, in the literature referred ExnBox4+, where n is the number of p-phenylene rings (n = 0-3). These variants with larger apertures are capable to included larger, different sized molecules. Based on the charge-transfer complexation of CBPQT4 + many supramolecular structures have been created, including fibrillar gels, micelles, vesicles, nanotubes, foldamers and liquid crystalline phases. In analogy to biological systems, which are assembled by hydrogen bonds to form supramolecular structures, the charge-transfer complexation is here an alternative.

He was a teacher and leader in his Algonquian community, and the Odanak Nation throughout his life. Laurent, also known as Sozap Lol√¥, is best known for the publication of his book New Familiar Abenakis and English Dialogues. The book is a dictionary that translates Abenaki to English, and was the first of its kind. The structure of the dictionary is what widely sets it apart from others. His translations are set up as a journey through their land as opposed to a standard list. He takes the reader on a trip from Quebec and throughout New England through linguistics and language education. Despite Laurent's upbringing of speaking fluent Abenaki and French, he not only created a dictionary to teach English to Abenaki people, he more importantly created the substantial text in an effort to preserve the Abenaki language and culture. The Abenaki language was oral, and little to no written documents had been recorded. New Familiar Abenakis and English Dialogues was vital in taking the number of a hundred- plus speakers to the rest of the Abenaki population as they continued to be a part of an English-speaking world, and it is still widely used today. Among others, the Abenaki linguist Jesse Bruchac has used the work of Laurent in his own work on language revitalization. Laurent was also an entrepreneur. He purchased goods from Odanak members and took them to his trading post in Intervale, New Hampshire, to sell to tourists. The camp was located in a grove of white pines known as Cathedral Woods, across from the scenic overlook that resides on the border of North Conway and Intervale. They sold things like baskets, Victorian goods, and miniatures. It was not only a business opportunity, but was also a way for his family to practice speaking English. The trading post remained for thirty-three years, until Laurent's death in 1917. His son Stephen Laurent was also an accomplished writer/linguist, and resided in Intervale until his death in 2001.

Beginning as a by-product of several succession crises that arose from the reigns of Seleucus IV Philopator and his brother Antiochus IV Epiphanes in the 170s and 160s, the wars typified the final years of the empire and were an important cause of its decline as a major power in the Near East and Hellenistic world. The last war ended with the collapse of the kingdom and its annexation by the Roman Republic in 63 BC.  Background  The civil wars that characterized the later years of the Seleucid Kingdom had their origins in the defeat of Antiochus III the Great in the Roman‚ÄìSeleucid War, under which the peace terms ensured that a representative of the Seleucid royal family was held in Rome as a hostage. Initially the future Antiochus IV Epiphanes was held hostage, but with the succession of his brother, Seleucus IV Philopater, in 187 and his apparent breaking of the Treaty of Apamea with Rome, Seleucus was forced to recall Antiochus to Syria and instead replace him with his son, the future Demetrius I Soter in 178 BC.  Rule of Antiochus V  When Seleucus was murdered by his minister Heliodorus in a power bid in 175, the legitimate heir was held as a hostage in Rome. With Demetrius so far from home and unable to claim the kingdom, his uncle Antiochus left Athens, where he had been residing for several years, and claimed the kingship for himself. He ruled the empire from 175 until his death whilst on a campaign in the east in 164 BC. A strong and energetic ruler Antiochus left an heir, but he was too young to claim the throne. Before Antiochus had set out on his eastern campaign, he had placed Lysias as his regent in the west and to take charge of his son, Antiochus V Eupator. Lysias and his colleagues fought off a rival to their control of the regency, the former king's ‚ÄòFriend‚Äô Philip who had travelled east with him, and attempted to exert control over the Jews led by Judas Maccabeus.Josephus AJ 12.386 Meanwhile, Demetrius in Rome yearned to return to the kingdom, but to Rome they saw the weak rule of the supposedly corrupt regency council and its boy-king as preferable to a strong-willed and energetic-minded ruler who may try to exert Seleucid control once more in the east.Polybius 31.11.11  Accession of Demetrius I  Eventually Demetrius was able to escape from Rome and return to Syria via Tripolis, where he quickly established himself and was made king with little fighting ‚Äì the army and people flocked to support him. His cousin, the boy Antiochus V, and his regent, Lysias, were put to death by order of Demetrius before they could be physically brought to him from Antioch.Appian Syr. 47a-b; Josephus AJ 12.390 As a ruler, however, he proved a disappointment. He disliked the Syrians as a people and became distant from his subjects, causing much resentment. Besides this, he attempted to reassert the Seleucid Empire once more as a major power and initiated several disastrous foreign adventures, which would ultimately lead his neighbouring rulers wishing to destabilise or even eliminate Demetrius.Polybius 33.5.1-4; Justin 35.1.1-4 The rulers of Egypt, Cappadocia and Pergamon, among others, such as the former finance minister of Antiochus IV, Heracleides, conspired to dispose of Demetrius.  Pretender Alexander Balas  Heracleides put forward a potential candidate for the Seleucid throne, the supposed son of Antiochus IV, and brother of Antiochus V, Alexander Balas. Whether or not he was truly the son of Antiochus IV Epiphanes is uncertain, but this did not matter to the ruler of Pergamon, either Eumenes II or his heir Attalus II Philadelphus depending on the sources, who initially interviewed him. Having been recognized by the conspiring kings as the rightful heir to the Seleucid throne, Alexander was sent to the hills of Cilicia under the watchful eye of the Cilician chieftain Zenophanes.Diodorus 31.32a Building up his reputation and gathering forces, Alexander was quickly sent with Heracleides to Rome, where they accepted him as the true king and gave their vocal support, albeit without any real material assistance.Polybius 33.15.1-2;33.18.1-14 Returning to the east Alexander Balas, his ships, mercenaries and auxiliaries provided by Ptolemy VI Philometor and from Pergamon, began his insurrection against Demetrius Soter. In 152 BC, he landed at Ptolemais to make his bid for power. Ptolemais was chosen, most likely, due to its proximity to Ptolemaic Egypt and the support that would come from Ptolemy VI.Josephus AJ 13.35-37; John D. Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.17-19  Alexander Balas and the Ptolemaic ascendency 152‚Äì145 BC  With Alexander established in the south at Ptolemais, Demetrius attempted to persuade the Jews under Jonathan Apphus to serve the Seleucid throne and help defeat him. But Alexander also sent word to Jonathan, promised him more powers and appointed him High Priest of the Jews.Josephus AJ 13.43-46  Alexander versus Demetrius I  At this point, Demetrius was threatened from the north by Pergamon and the pro-Alexander forces under Zenophanes in Cilicia and from the south by Alexander himself and Ptolemy VI. Nevertheless, at this stage both armies seemed to be generally the same size, leading to a stalemate. However, in 151/0 Alexander began to extend his control up the Phoenician coast, taking Tyre, Sidon and Berytus ‚Äì perhaps assisted by naval support provided from the Seleucid fleet based at Ptolemais and from Ptolemy. By this time, Alexander was militarily strong enough to march north to confront Demetrius properly, reinforced by further mercenaries and defectors from Demetrius.John D. Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.20-21 Alexander‚Äôs march north in 150 BC lead to two confrontations with the army of Demetrius, the first being a victory for Demetrius. However a decisive victory for Alexander was gained outside Antioch in 150. Demetrius‚Äôs left flank pushed aside Alexander‚Äôs right, even advancing far enough to loot the enemy camp, but on his right Demetrius was beaten by Alexander‚Äôs left. Demetrius, fighting on the right flank was caught in boggy terrain and unseated from his horse. He continued to fight on foot but was surrounded and killed by a great number of enemy troops.Josephus AJ 13.58; John D. Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.22  Demetrius' sons strike back  With Demetrius dead, Alexander was now undisputed king of the Seleucid kingdom. But he faced one major problem ‚Äì the sons of Demetrius. Though young, both Demetrius II Nicator and Antiochus VII Sidetes were sent abroad by their father, as he feared that they would be put to death as rival claimants, and to hopefully be a rallying point for the loyalists to the legitimate branch of the royal family. Demetrius was sent to Crete, to raise a mercenary army from Crete itself and the Greek islands under the captain Lasthenes. Within two years a sufficient force had been raised to begin their campaign.Josephus AJ 13.86; Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.218 By 148/147 BC Lasthenes and Demetrius were ready to begin their attempt to reclaim the kingdom. Demetrius was still very young, aged at about fourteen years, so in reality the campaign and leadership was provided by Lasthenes. They landed in Cilicia, which would provide a good line of retreat should the expedition turn out badly, and the younger brother of Demetrius, Antiochus, was sent to the city of Side in Pamphylia ‚Äì perhaps to provide the Demetrian forces with another claimant should Demetrius be caught or killed.Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.78 Alexander, based primarily in Ptolemais, no doubt due to its close proximity to his benefactor and ally Ptolemy VI Philometor, moved north to Antioch to counter the Demetrian invasion, but found the population discontented and irate. Alexander, though initially popular, had proven himself incompetent at the ruling of a kingdom and spent a considerable amount of his reign in pursuit of pleasure.Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.213, p.218 As soon as Alexander turned his back to counter the invasion in the north, his governor in Palestine, Apollonius Taos, defected immediately to Demetrius ‚Äì the Hellenized Philistine cities giving their support. Alexander appealed to his Judean ally, Jonathan Apphus, to intervene against Apollonius, which he did by mustering his army, besieging Joppa and then decisively defeating Apollonius near Azotus. Jonathan later sacked the city and the temple of Dagon. On hearing this, Alexander rewarded Jonathan with dominion over the city of Accaron (Ekron)Josephus AJ 13.88, 13.91-102; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.79 Despite being in stalemate with Demetrius and having an obvious edge with the addition of Judean forces, Alexander was reluctant to bring them north ‚Äì the Judeans had a bad reputation for their anti-Hellenism, especially their expelling of non-Jews etc. Such forces would prove a liability for Alexander and so he kept Jonathan in the south, where he could counter the pro-Demetrius strongholds in Palestine ‚Äì Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod and Ptolemais.Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.79 Both armies at this point were evenly matched, causing a stalemate. The Demetrian army under Lasthenes was professional and reliable, being composed mainly of mercenaries, but was relatively small and had the ever looming issue of their pay. A large army was not affordable for the Demetrian insurgents. In comparison Alexander had to gather troops from considerable distances away, but had to ensure that he left enough men in the peripheral provinces to deter foreign invasions from enemies such as the Parthians or other eastern kingdoms. In fact a possible rebellion or Parthian excursion was defeated decisively by the viceroy of the Upper Satrapies, Kleomenes, in the summer of 148, his victory being commemorated by a triumphal statue of Herakles erected in the Bisitun Pass.Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.80  Ptolemaic intervention  It was due to this stalemate that Alexander eventually convinced his Egyptian ally and father-in- law, Ptolemy Philometor, to intervene decisively in 147 BC. Ptolemy, seeing an opportunity to keep his influence in Syria and perhaps reclaim Coele-Syria as a reward, marched north occupying much of the Palestinian and Phoenician coastline, placing garrisons as he advanced. He was met by Jonathan and his Judean army at Ptolemais, and both armies marched up to the Eleutheros River, where Ptolemy turned Jonathan back southward. Ptolemy then advanced to Seleucia. The Ptolemaic army was itself professional, large and experienced ‚Äì a possibly decisive factor in the war at this point.Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.219 But no sooner had Ptolemy arrived in northern Syria, than he broke with Alexander over a supposed attempt on his life back in the south. Ptolemy blamed Alexander‚Äôs chief minister Ammonius and demanded that Alexander hand him over for punishment, which Alexander refused. Ptolemy, who had been in possession of his daughter Cleopatra Thea from Ptolemais onward, declared their marriage void and offered her to Demetrius. Denied support and with a large enemy force nearby, Alexander fled Antioch and moved north to raise troops. Demetrius and Ptolemy were now allies, and it seemed that the price for Ptolemy‚Äôs intervention was the reintegration of Coele-Syria and Palestine back into Egypt.Josephus AJ 13.106-111; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.83; Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.220 The governors of Antioch, Hierax and Diodotus Tryphon, despairing of Alexander and fearing Demetrius offered the Seleucid crown to Ptolemy VI Philometor and convinced the populace to push for this outcome too. Ptolemy certainly considered the prospect and took at least a month to decide, but after careful consideration, especially on the opinion of Rome to this, he declined. In turn he convinced them to accept Demetrius as their rightful king, stating that he would rule benevolently and not seek revenge against those who had overthrown his father in 150 BC.Diodorus 32.9c; Josephus AJ 13.113-116; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.84 In the summer of 145 BC, with enough forces raised in the north of the kingdom, which Josephus called a ‚Äònumerous and great army‚Äô, Alexander felt confident enough to march south to confront Demetrius and Ptolemy. Crossing the Amanus into the plain of Syria, Alexander began to plunder the countryside surrounding Antioch.Josephus AJ 13.116; Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.221 The armies of the three kings finally came to battle near Antioch at the River Oenoparos. Demetrius and Ptolemy routed Alexander who escaped, but Ptolemy was thrown from his horse, fracturing his skull. Alexander meanwhile had fled with five hundred picked men to Abae, in what Diodorus calls, Arabia to seek refuge with an allied Arab prince. However two of Alexander‚Äôs officers, Heliades and Casius, negotiated their own safety and volunteered to assassinate Alexander, which they did. Alexander‚Äôs head was brought to Ptolemy, who had briefly regained consciousness following his fracture. Some days later he died at the hands of his surgeons who were operating on him.Diodorus 32. 9d, 10; Bevan, ‚ÄòThe House of Ptolemy‚Äô, p.305  Aftermath  With Alexander murdered and Ptolemy dead, Demetrius was undisputed ruler of the Seleucid kingdom. However, Demetrius faced major problems with his victory ‚Äì a costly victory in terms of manpower, the loyalty of his newly won kingdom, his dependence on the mercenaries, especially the Cretans under Lasthenes, to keep him in control and the Ptolemaic forces still occupying much of the Syrian and Phoenician coast. Lasthenes, with his new- found power, was made in effect minister of finance and given absolute rule of Antioch, which would have dire consequences for the young king Demetrius.Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.86 The Ptolemaic garrisons disintegrated and chose to retreat back to Egypt, Demetrius having ordered them to leave and compelling the local populations to expel them with force should need be. Demetrius was now in full control of the kingdom but his rule would ultimately be troubled by civil strife and further civil war.  Insurrection of Antiochus Dionysus and Diodotus Tryphon 145‚Äì138 BC   Trouble in Antioch  Alexander Balas, much like Demetrius I Soter before him, feared for the safety of his heirs in the event of an enemy victory. According to Diodorus, Alexander therefore sent his son Antiochus to an allied Arab chieftain, named Iamblichus, for safety and as a rallying point for forces loyal to him, should he fall. It was the former Alexandrian commander and governor of Antioch, Diodotus, who would later convince the Arab leader to hand over custody of the child to him after having started a rebellion in Apamea.Diodorus 33.4 In the meantime, Demetrius II Nicator was still young and reliant on his mercenary forces to maintain control. However his rule, feeling the same disdain and contempt for the Syrian people that his father felt, was one epitomised by terror and repression. A great purge of the supporters of Alexander Balas was followed by forceful collection of wealth by his mercenary forces, no doubt to pay their wages for the war they had successfully concluded.Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.224 His mercenary commander and chief minister Lasthenes convinced Demetrius to discharge the standing garrison of Antioch, and perhaps the garrisons of other cities, and reduce the pay of the militia. The standing army in Syria was, due to the recent events, deemed unreliable by Demetrius ‚Äì many had supported, no doubt, Alexander Balas.Mittag, ‚ÄúBlood and Money. On the loyalty of the Seleucid Army‚Äù, p.51-52 This made Demetrius even more unpopular and caused great degrees of civil unrest and even rioting in Antioch. The Cretan mercenaries, reinforced by Jewish troops sent by Jonathan Apphus, who was now allied to Demetrius at the death of Alexander Balas, put the rebellion down brutally. A grand fire broke out destroying much of the city of Antioch.Diodorus 33.4; Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.224-225; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.142-43  Diodotus' rebellion  With the kingdom greatly discontented and ripe for insurrection, Diodotus made his move against Demetrius II in early 144. Starting his rebellion in his home province of Apamea, he gathered supporters, no doubt gaining great strength from the actual city of Apamea. Apamea, which was once named Pella, was the major military centre of the kingdom. It was the seat of the royal stud, housed the elephant corps, the War Office (Stratiotikon Logisterion) and the military training school. The city and its neighbouring settlements at, for example, Larissa, had a Greco-Macedonian population larger than Antioch and Cyrrhestica. In fact Larissa was the headquarters of the ‚ÄòFirst Agema of the Cavalry‚Äô, an elite cavalry unit of the Seleucid army, and was previously loyal to Alexander Balas.Bar-Kochva, ‚ÄòThe Seleucid Army‚Äô, p.28-29,p.70 Diodotus could rely on these regions and on the dismissed troops from Antioch and elsewhere, enlisting them as new soldiers. It was probable that many of the troops of the standing army intended to desert from Demetrius anyway, but now they had a focal point ‚Äì Diodotus.Mittag, ‚ÄúBlood and Money. On the loyalty of the Seleucid Army‚Äù, p.52 Not soon after declaring his rebellion, Diodotus proclaimed the child of Alexander Balas as King Antiochus VI Dionysus. Antiochus was only a child, and therefore a useful tool to control the loyalty of the disaffected Seleucid subjects. Diodotus established himself soon thereafter at Chalcis, to the east of Antioch. The rebellion was now at the point of open war, and the majority of the fighting was conducted in northern Syria for control of the major cities. In 143, Diodotus assaulted and captured Antioch, pushing Demetrius to the coastal city of Seleucia. At their highest point, in about 143/142 BC, Diodotus and Antiochus VI occupied most of inner Syria (including Antioch, Apamea, Chalcis and Larissa); Tarsus, Mallus and Coracesium in Cilicia; and the southern coastal cities of Aradus, Orthosia, Byblos, Berytus, Ptolemais and Dora. In comparison, Demetrius controlled the rest of the Syrian and Phoenician coasts including Seleucia, Laodicea, Tyre and Sidon as well as the majority of Cilicia.Strabo 16b.10; Habicht, ‚ÄòThe Seleucids and their Rivals‚Äô, in ‚ÄúThe Cambridge Ancient History‚Äù, Vol.8, p.366; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô, p.145-147 The periphery of the empire was generally loyal to Demetrius, but in some parts, like Babylonia, it wavered for some time at one point supporting Antiochus, but ultimately reverted to support for Demetrius.  War in Palestine  It was at this point that the importance of the semi- independent states, like Judea, became apparent. Jonathan Apphus, as a former friend of Alexander Balas, and despite his brief alliance with Demetrius, eventually joined Diodotus to battle against Demetrius II. Jonathan was given leave by Diodotus and Antiochus to raise an army and campaign against the generals of Demetrius in Palestine. Simon Thassi, Jonathan‚Äôs brother, was made Strategos, or governor, of the territories from the Egyptian border up to Tyre, though most of the non-Jewish Palestinian cities remained loyal to Demetrius. Gaza which had initially declared for Demetrius at some point defected, but ultimately joined neither side, attempting to exert a degree of neutrality in the civil war. Meanwhile Jonathan campaigned throughout the southern regions of the Seleucid kingdom. Ascalon submitted to him and he eventually besieged Gaza, it was at this point that Demetrius sent an expedition southward to counter him.Josephus AJ 13.148-154; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô,p.150 The Demetrian army engaged Jonathan at Tell Hazor, south of the sea of Galilee. Jonathan fell into a trap, but his army fled before later rallying southwards. Despite this victory, the Demetrian generals did not pursue him. In the meantime, Simon, with his own force forced the settlement of Beth Zur to surrender to him and later occupied Joppa. At this point the Demetrian army was recalled northward.  Diodotus claims kingship  By this point, in the middle of 142 BC, Antiochus VI died. It is said that Diodotus had the boy killed to fulfil his ambitions of becoming king himself and it is apparent that many of the ancient historians lay the blame of the boy‚Äôs death in surgery at the feet of Diodotus.Diodorus 33.28; Livy Periochae 55.11; Grainger, ‚ÄòRome, Parthia, India‚Äô,p.152 Despite this Diodotus put himself forward as king under the new regal name of Tryphon, meaning ‚Äòthe magnificent‚Äô, he added as his official epiphet ‚ÄòAutokrator‚Äô, a term that linked him back to the days of Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great ‚Äì it was this term that they were given by the Greek cities at commander of their armies. It was either at Antioch or Apamea that he was ‚Äòelected‚Äô by the Greco-Macedonian soldiery as king, and to show his links to the soldiery his emblem shown on coins was that of a helmet, a composite of the popular Boeotian and Konos helmet styles.Bevan, ‚ÄòHouse of Seleucus‚Äô, Vol.II, p.231 The boldness of the Jewish offensives against the loyalists of Demetrius led Diodotus to fear an ever-increasing Jewish independence, and as such began to plot against Jonathan ‚Äì this being whilst Antiochus VI was still alive. Luring Jonathan to Ptolemais with a small guard, Diodotus kidnapped him and unsuccessfully held him for ransom. He eventually had Jonathan executed and initiated an invasion of Judea, which failed due to either weather conditions or Jewish garrisons blocking the suitable pathways into Judea.1 Maccabees 12.39-53; Josephus AJ 13.203-218 In the same year an army of Tryphon‚Äôs routed a pro-Demetrius force under Sarpedon in between Ptolemais and Tyre, but as they were marching along the coast in pursuit, a great tidal wave wiped out the army, according to Athenaeus.Athenaeus 8.333 Demetrius, meanwhile, had journeyed east to combat the encroachment of the Parthians, but in 139 BC was captured in Parthia. With the detested Demetrius gone, his brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, left his home in Rhodes and married the wife of Demetrius, Cleopatra Thea, further legitimizing his position. Tryphon‚Äôs support began to deteriorate with Antiochus now the leader of the Seleucid dynastic faction in the empire. Antiochus successfully pushed back Tryphon‚Äôs forces and besieged him in the fortress-city of Dor on the coast. Tryphon escaped by sea to Orthosia and made his way to his home-region of Apamea, where, being chased by Antiochus, he was either put to death or committed suicide.Josephus AJ 13.223; 1 Maccabees 15.10-38; Strabo 14.5.2 Diodotus Tryphon was unique in the history of the Seleucid empire to be the only major rebel to actively claim the throne for the whole kingdom, as opposed to the rebels Molon and Timarchus who had launched regional bids for power and had not desired to rule the whole kingdom. In addition, Tryphon‚Äôs rebellion was one of the longest lasting ‚Äì beginning in 145 and ending with his death in 138 BC.  Alexander Zabinas 128‚Äì123 BC  Zabinas was a false Seleucid who claimed to be an adoptive son of Antiochus VII Sidetes, but in fact seems to have been the son of an Egyptian merchant named Protarchus. Antioch, Apamea, and several other cities, disgusted with the tyranny of Demetrius, acknowledged the authority of Alexander. He was used as a pawn by the Egyptian king Ptolemy VIII Physcon, who introduced Zabinas as a means of getting to the legitimate Seleucid king Demetrius II, who supported his sister Cleopatra II against him in the complicated dynastic feuds of the latter Hellenistic dynasties. Zabinas managed to defeat Demetrius II, who fled to Tyre and was killed there, and thereafter ruled parts of Syria (128‚Äì123 BC), but soon he ran out of Egyptian support and was in turn defeated by Demetrius' son Antiochus VIII Grypus. Zabinas fled to the Seleucid capital Antiochia, where he plundered several temples. He is said to have joked about melting down a statuette of the goddess of victory Nike which was held in the hand of a Zeus statue, saying \\"Zeus has given me Victory\\". Enraged by his impiety the Antiochenes cast Zabinas out of the city. He soon fell into the hands of robbers, who delivered him up to Antiochus, by whom he was put to death, in 122 BC.

History The first site of Camp Babbitt, established on June 24, 1862, was located one mile northeast of the center of the town of Visalia, in Tulare County. It was first garrisoned by two companies of the 2nd California Cavalry. The post was named for Lieutenant Colonel E. B. Babbitt, Quartermaster General of the Department of the Pacific.  Visalia Secessionist Disturbances  The post was first intended to maintain order in the area where strong pro Confederate sentiments were creating unrest. In an attempt to control subversion of the Union cause in the secessionist hotbed of Visalia, on the orders of General George Wright, Captain Moses A. McLaughlin moved his company D and another in October 1862 over the Sierra Nevada Mountains from the Owens Valley in four and a half days to take command of Camp Babbitt.War of the Rebellion, April 21, 1862, pp.152-153, Report of Lt.

On December 24, 1862, McLaughlin wrote for reinforcements, in the face of rising tensions between the Union and Secesh factions. On December 31, McLaughlin issued orders for the arrest of the owners and publishers of the \\"Expositor\\", the local secessionist newspaper. That same day he was instructed by headquarters by telegram to release all political prisoners after they had taken the oath of allegiance. Both owners eventually swore the oath, one after a time in the jail. However this did not stop them from continuing to publish their paper opposing the war and the Union cause.Aurora Hunt, The Army of the Pacific: Its Operations in California, Texas, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Plains Region, Mexico, Etc., 1860-1866, Stackpole Books, Mechanicsburg, PA, 2004, pp. 337-338 Owens Valley Indian War By April 12, 1863, Lt. Col. William Jones, was commander at Camp Babbitt, ordered Captain McLaughlin to reinforce Camp Independence with a detachment of 24 men of Company D and 18 men of Company E, 2nd Cavalry, California Volunteers, with a 12-pounder howitzer, and four six- mule government wagon teams, carrying rations, ammunition, and forage. Elements of Company D and Company E under Captain McLaughlin, on the resumption of hostilities in the Owens Valley marched there in April 1863 via Keyesville, where they engaged in the Keyesville Massacre. They then moved on to Camp Independence, in the Owens River Valley, participating in the final campaign of the Owens Valley Indian War, and escorted almost 1000 Paiute to Fort Tejon in July 1863. Mason Henry Gang On February 18, 1865, Captain Herman Noble sent a detachment of Company E, 2nd California Cavalry, under Sergeant Rowley, from Camp Babbitt near Visalia in a long pursuit of men believed to be the Mason Henry Gang. It took them across the deserts of Southern California, south to Sonora, Mexico. The March 15, 1865, issue of The Visalia Delta described the pursuit: : MASON AND HENRY - The squad of soldiers sent out from Camp Babbitt by Captain Noble under the command of Sergeant Rowley, in pursuit of the above Constitutional Democratic murders of Union men, have returned to camp. They report a very hard skirmish, traveling over 900 miles through a most desolate country; upon several occasions going out two or three days without food for themselves, or forage for their horses. They were several times on their trail, after they left Fort Tej√≥n, and finally tracked them down into Sonora, when they were compelled to give up the chase on account of their horses giving out and their inability to get fresh ones. The fugitives were well supplied with gold, having $3,000 or more in their possession. It is believed by many that they have gone to recruit a guerrilla band, and will return to prey on Union men in the lower part of the State. They could have obtained plenty of recruits nigher home. Doubtless, Visalia would have furnished several birds of prey and a surgeon or two, to bind up their broken bones, and very likely a Chaplain to minister to their bruised souls, and a number of spies, sneaks, and informers. As to good fighting men, they would be scarcer hereabouts. The party were out twenty-five days.MASON AND HENRY, The Visalia Delta; March 15, 1865; 3:1 After the Civil War After the end of the Civil War, on October 2. 1865, the post was relocated about a mile northeast of its first site.

The work is dedicated to the sister duo of violinist May Harrison and cellist Beatrice Harrison, who premiered the piece under conductor Henry Wood on February 21, 1920 in Queen's Hall, London. Background Delius was inspired to compose the Double Concerto after attending a December 1914 performance of the Hall√© Orchestra under conductor Thomas Beecham in Manchester. The concert featured Johannes Brahms's Double Concerto in A minor performed by sisters May and Beatrice Harrison, to whom Delius was introduced after the concert by music critic Samuel Langford. Though his opinion of Brahms's Double Concerto was never recorded, Delius agreed to write a concerto for the Harrison sisters and began work on the composition by April 1915, frequently consulting the sisters during its creation. The piece was completed in June 1915 during a relatively dry creative period for Delius (the only other composition he'd finished in a year's time was Air and Dance for string orchestra). After its completion, Delius, in ailing health, and his wife Jelka returned to Grez-sur-Loing, France. Delius later described any time spent away from his work in Watford as \\"an unpleasant dream.\\" Composition A performance of the Double Concerto lasts approximately twenty minutes and, similar to his subsequent violin and cello concertos, the work is composed in one continuous movement. Instrumentation The work is scored for solo violin and cello accompanied by an orchestra comprising two flutes, oboe, two clarinets, English horn, two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, harp, and strings. Reception Andrew Clements of The Guardian wrote of the Double Concerto, along with Delius's violin and cello concertos, saying, \\"...they all sound as if they were carved out of the same creative block, in which conventional concerto dialogues are replaced by less confrontational rhapsodising with soloists, and orchestra combining to unfold Delius's long- limbed melodies.\\" Anthony Burton of BBC Music Magazine similarly opined, \\"Unusually for [Delius], they have no acknowledged starting point in narrative or landscape: their lyrical flow seems to stem rather from the very nature of the solo instruments. But all three round off their coherent single-movement forms with codas suffused by Delius‚Äôs characteristic sunset glow of nostalgia.\\" Music critic Michael Cookson said of the piece, \\"The double concerto displays much of the composer‚Äôs individuality, comprising many differing melodic ideas presented in a rather agitated manner, yet the work has an appealing robustness and remains one of my favourite Delius works.\\" See also *List of compositions by Frederick Delius *List of double concertos for violin and cello References Compositions by Frederick Delius 1915 compositions Delius Compositions for symphony orchestra 20th-century classical music ","title":"Double Concerto (Delius)"},{"id":"46443763","text":"Cornell Craig was a wide receiver at Southern Illinois University Carbondale (1996‚Äì1999).

It was established probably in May 1856 or possibly a bit earlier. It was named for Capt. Delos B. Sackett (or Sacket), who was stationed there during part of the post's existence. Sacket served in the American Civil War and was with the U.S. Army until 1881, when he retired as a brigadier general.\\"Sacket, Delos Bennet,\\" James G. Wilson and John Fiske, eds., Appleton's Cyclopaedia of American Biography (New York: D. Appleton, 1888), Vol. V, p. 364. During much of its existence, Camp Sacket was near a high hill that was used as a lookout post. At least five officers stationed at the camp became well known in the upcoming Civil War. They were Maj. John Sedgwick, Lieut. J.E.B. Stuart, Lieut. Col. Joseph E. Johnston, Col. Edwin V. Sumner and Lieut. Col. Philip St. George Cooke.Ely Moore, \\"The Story of Lecompton,\\" Collections of the Kansas State Historical Society, 1909-1910 (Topeka: State Printing Office, 1910), pp. 464-5. Camp Sacket was established to provide some aid to the government of Kansas Territory, in Lecompton. This government was the legal government, but was sympathetic to the southern cause in Kansas. Charles L. Robinson was the governor of the government loyal to the northern (free-state) cause. Robinson's government was not recognized by the Federal government. The troops at Camp Sacket were supplied by Fort Leavenworth and did their best to maintain a neutral stance between the two sides. Both sides accused the Army of favoring the opposing side.Maj. Brian A. Riniker, \\"How United States Army Leaders at Fort Leavenworth Performed Peacekeeping Operations in Territorial Kansas\\" (MMAS thesis, U.S. Army Command and Staff College, Fort Leavenworth, Kans., 2007), pp. 66-9, 78-9. From May to September 1856, Charles Robinson and six other prisoners from the free-state cause were held prisoner at Camp Sacket. While the prisoners were there, the troops at Camp Sacket did their duty to prevent battles and strife between the northern and southern sides from becoming an all-out war. In August Lieut. Col. Cooke arrived at the camp with 500 men to take charge and supplement the 100 men who had been stationed there prior to then.Riniker, pp. 78-9.Sara T. L. Robinson, Kansas: Its Interior and Exterior Life (N.p.: 1856), chapters XVIII, XXI, XXII, at http://www.kancoll.org/books/robinson/r_intro.htm . Camp Sacket's troops were continually being deployed to various locations to prevent trouble. Troops were sent to Lawrence, Topeka, Lecompton and various more rural locations while the camp existed. At the end of March 1857 all the troops at the camp were ordered back to Fort Leavenworth. An appeal from Acting Governor Daniel Woodson failed to persuade the Army to reoccupy Camp Sacket.Riniker, pp. 65-6, 78-9.John H. Gihon, M.D., Geary and Kansas (Philadelphia: Charles C.

However, in late May 2010 the leader of Health Concern on the council, Howard Martin, left the party to sit as an independent and went on to join Labour in September 2010. Another change came in March 2011 when both of the Liberal Democrat councillors, husband and wife Peter and Helen Dyke, left the party to become independents due to disillusionment with the national Conservative- Liberal Democrat coalition.

Labour were the other party to make gains, taking an extra 2 seats, including gaining Areley Kings from Health Concern by 39 votes. This made Labour the second largest party on the council with six seats, while Health Concern dropped three to have four seats.

He did not appear until the summer of his three-year-old season, but then made rapid progress, winning two minor races and the Select Stakes before recording his biggest win in the Champion Stakes in October 1989. He was never as good again, but did win the Premio Roma in 1990. After his retirement from racing he had some success as a breeding stallion in Brazil. Background Legal Case was a bay horse with no white markings bred in Ireland by Ovidstown Investments Ltd. He was sired by the dual Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe winner Alleged out of the mare Maryinsky. Alleged was a successful stallion, and a strong influence for stamina: his best winners included Miss Alleged, Shantou, Law Society and Midway Lady. Maryinsky won two minor races at Del Mar racetrack in 1980. Apart from Legal Case, Maryinsky also produced La Sky, the dam of The Oaks winner Love Divine who in turn produced the St Leger winner Sixties Icon. During his racing career Legal Case was owned by the businessman Sir Gordon White (later Baron White of Hull) and trained at the Bedford House stable in Newmarket by Luca Cumani. Racing career 1989: three-year-old season Legal Case was unraced as a two-year-old and did not appear on a racecourse until June 1989, when he contested a maiden race over eight and a half furlongs at Beverley Racecourse. Ridden by Ray Cochrane he started 8/11 favourite and recovered from a slow start to win by three quarters of a length from Enigma with the pair finishing ten lengths clear of the other twelve runners. A month later he was ridden by Frankie Dettori when he started 2/9 for a graduation race (for horses with no more than one previous win) at Windsor Racecourse and won by six lengths from Silly Habit. Cochrane regained the ride when Legal Case was moved up in class for the Listed Winter Hill Stakes at Windsor in August in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. He started favourite but was beaten three lengths by the Michael Stoute-trained colt Dolpour, with Opening Verse finishing fifth of the seven runners. In September Legal Case was moved up to Group Three class for the Select Stakes over ten furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse. Ridden by Dettori he started the 7/4 favourite against four opponents. After being restrained in the early stages he took the lead a furlong out and drew away to win by four lengths from Greenwich Papillon with Indian Queen three lengths back in third place. The colt was then moved up to the highest level when he was sent to France to contest the 68th running of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse on 8 October. Starting at odds of 18/1 he was towards the rear of the nineteen-runner field for most of the way before making steady progress in the straight and finishing eighth, less than five lengths behind the winner Carroll House. Less than two weeks after his run at Longchamp, Legal Case, ridden by Cochrane, was one of eleven horses to contest the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. Dolpour was made favourite on 4/1 with Legal Case 5/1 second choice in the betting alongside the four-year-old Ile de Chypre, the winner of the Juddmonte International. The other contenders included the Dewhurst Stakes winner Scenic, the improving handicapper Braashee, the Royal Lodge Stakes winner High Estate and Ile de Nisky (fourth in The Derby). Ile de Chypre led from the start, with Legal Case being restrained towards the rear of the field before making progress in the last quarter mile on the stands side (the left side from the jockeys' viewpoint). Inside the final furlong the three-year-olds Dolpour, Legal Case and Scenic moved up to challenge Ile de Chypre, although Scenic was squeezed for room and failed to maintain his run. The final strides saw Dolpour, Ile de Chypre and Legal Case racing neck-and-neck before crossing the line together. After a photo finish, Legal Case was declared the winner by a head from Dolpour, with Ile de Chypre a short head away in third. 1990: four-year-old season In 1990 Dettori took over from Cochrane as Cumani's stable jockey. Legal Case remained in training as a four-year-old, but did not appear until the Royal Ascot meeting in June when he finished fourth behind Batshoof, Relief Pitcher and Terimon in the Prince of Wales's Stakes. He started favourite for the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket on 10 July but never looked likely to win and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Sapience. Eighteen days later he started at odds of 14/1 for the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot but made no impact and came home tenth of the eleven runners. The colt showed better form when he returned in autumn. In his second attempt at the Arc de Triomphe, he finished sixth of the twenty-one runners, six lengths behind the winner Saumarez. When bidding to win a second Champion Stakes on 20 October he stayed on well in the closing stages to take third place behind In the Groove and Linamix. On his final appearance, Legal Case was sent to Italy for the Group One Premio Roma over 2000 metres on heavy ground at Capannelle Racecourse on 10 November. Ridden as in all his races that year by Dettori he won by two lengths and one and a half lengths from Candy Glen (Gran Criterium, Premio Parioli, Prix Daphnis) and Sikeston (Gran Criterium, Premio Parioli, Premio Ribot). 1991: five-year-old season Training problems kept Legal Case off the racecourse for most of the 1991 season and he made only two appearances in late autumn. On 29 October he started odds-favourite against three opponents in a minor race at Salisbury Racecourse and won by three and a half lengths from the Bosphorus Trophy winner Maraakiz. On his final start he returned to Rome for the Premio Roma in November but finished fifth of eleven behind Sikeston. Stud career At the end of his racing career, Legal Case was exported to become a breeding stallion in Brazil. His last foals were born in 2007. The best of his offspring included Evil Knievel, a Grade I winner in Brazil and Virginie, who won the Beverly Hills Handicap at Hollywood Park Racetrack in 1999.

El unicornio, translated in English as The Wandering Unicorn (1965), is a novel by the Argentinian author Manuel Mujica L√°inez (1910‚Äì1984) in which the legend of Melusine is developed. Set in medieval France and Palestine of the Crusades, L√°inez‚Äôs novel is a mixture of fantasy and romance which is narrated from the perspective of the shape- changing Melusine. The events of the original legend of the medieval Romance are recollected early in the novel. Melusine, a fairy, marries Raimondin of Lusignan. However, when he spies her transformed as half-serpent, she flies away with frightful screams. Associated through marriage with the Lusignan family, Melusine appears over the centuries on the towers of their castle, wailing mournfully whenever a disaster or death in the family is imminent. In L√°inez's novel Melusine embarks upon an adventure and unrequited love-affair with Aiol, the son of Ozil, a crusader knight who bequeaths a unicorn's lance to his son. Together the young knight Aiol and Melusine travel across Europe encountering monsters, angels and Knights Templar, before eventually arriving in war-torn Jerusalem of the Crusades era.

Early life and career Hong joined the police force after completing his secondary education on May 12, 1979. He began training as probationary inspector at Pusat Latihan Polis Jalan Semarak, Kuala Lumpur and was confirmed as Inspector on August 1, 1986. Operation Talung and its aftermath He was serving as an Inspector at the Bukit Aman Special Branch when he was assigned the roles of leader and strategist of \\"Operation Talung\\". It commenced on March 12, 1988 at Jalan Tunku Abdul Rahman, Kuala Lumpur. The mission was to capture the infamous Communist leader of the 6th assault unit, Chong Chor, and his bodyguard, Yong Nam. On the day of the operation, the team engaged in a stealthy two hour pursuit of Chong Chor's car before it was raided. The swift actions of the police quashed any chances of armed resistance. Voon Ken Hong, the strategist and leader of the operation, revealed that all his staff were ready to sacrifice their lives for the cause. Among the Communist assault units scattered all over West Malaysia, the most notorious were the 5th assault unit based in Perak and the 6th assault unit in Selangor. With the capture of its leader, the 6th assault unit disbanded, dealing a blow to the morale of the other units. In the following year, the rest of the communist members laid down their weapons which led to the end of the Communist insurgency in Malaysia.

Description  Allium ochotense grows to in height, (world encyclopedia, in Japanese), article on gy≈çja ninniku by botanist with a strong garlic-like odor, and has \\"bulbs.. surrounded by a grayish-brown, netlike coating.

Stanford University Press. p. 307. . The plant is slow-growing, and aside from seed-propagation, \\"A. victorialis has two vegetative propagation systems; one is tillering and the other is adventitious buds\\". The plant has an intense garlic-like odor (cf. allicin content) that is thought more intense than garlic itself. Etymology Allium is the ancient Latin name for garlic.Gledhill, David (2008). \\"The Names of Plants\\". Cambridge University Press. (hardback), (paperback). p 43 The specific epithet, ochotense, was given by Yarosl√°v Iv√°novich Prokh√°nov (–Ø—Ä–æ—Å–ª–∞ÃÅ–≤ –ò–≤–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤–∏—á –ü—Ä–æ—Ö–∞ÃÅ–Ω–æ–≤) [1902-1965], a Soviet botanist, systematist, geographer, geneticist, Doctor of Biological Science, and professor.(1930). \\"Bulletin of Applied Botany, Genetics, and Plant Breeding\\". 114. 2: 174 It was presumably named in reference to the Okhotsk region of Russia, a place where this species is known to occur. Distribution Allium ochotense is centered in the Amur River basin area, thus, it occurs in the Amur, Khabarovsk, Primorye regions of Siberia, and into Sakhalin and Kuril Islands within the Russian Far East. In China, the plant grows in Inner Mongolia and China (Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning), Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan). The range also includes Korea, in Ulleung Island and the high mountains (over ) in the Korean peninsula, including Baekdu Mountain, and Japan (Hokkaido and Honshu), in colonies from Hokkaido down to the Kinki area (Nara Prefecture), in coniferous and mixed forested wetlands in subalpine terrain. The plant's range extends nominally into the United States, but A. ochotense is only found natively growing on Attu Island, the westernmost island of the Aleutian archipelago. There are colonies on Unalaska Island, but they are thought to be introduced.Flora of North America, Vol. 26 Page 234 Allium victorialis Linnaeus, Sp. Pl. 1: 295. 1753.  Cultivation  From around 1990, it has been grown horticulturally in Hokkaido and snowy regions on the eastern side of Honsh≈´. Outbreaks of plant disease have been reported in these onion paddy farms.„ÇÆ„Éß„Ç¶„Ç∏„É£„Éã„É≥„Éã„ÇØ„Å´Áô∫Áîü„Åó„ÅüÊñ∞ÁóÖÂÆ≥„ÄÅÁôΩËâ≤Áñ´ÁóÖ„Å®„Åô„Åô„Åã„Å≥ÁóÖÔºàÊñ∞Áß∞Ôºâ Ëæ≤ÊûóÊ∞¥Áî£ÁúÅ Ëæ≤ÊûóÊ∞¥Áî£ÊäÄË°ì‰ºöË≠∞‰∫ãÂãôÂ±ÄÁ≠ëÊ≥¢‰∫ãÂãôÊâÄ It requires approximately four years from sowing to harvest.  Cultivars  At Utsunomiya University's Agriculture Department, the research group led by then-assistant professor Nobuaki Fujishige developed an A. ochotense √ó A. tuberosum (garlic chives) hybrid, which they dubbed .Ë°åËÄÖËèú„Éª„ÇÆ„Éß„Ç¶„Ç∏„É£„Éä It resembles the garlic chive in outward appearance, but inherits the thick-stalked trait of A. victorialis, and like the garlic chive, is ready for harvest after 1 year.

Specific odor agents include: \\"methyl allyl disulfide (Chinese chive odor), diallyl disulfide (garlic-like odor), and dimethyl disulfide and methyl allyl trisulfide (pickles-like odor)\\". Uses  Culinary  = China = In China its name is given as gecong () or shancong (). Its use may be not be widespread. One source only mentions that the Jiarongic minority harvest the \\"tender unfolding leaves\\" which they sun-dry and serve on special occasions. = Japan = The Japanese name means literally \\"a (type of) garlic that a gy≈çja makes use of as food,\\" where a gy≈çja signifies a monk or a lay person engaged in ascetic training outdoors (cf. , Shugend≈ç). Much of its flourishing habitat occurs in nature reserves such as national parks. Hence it is considered a scarce sansai (wild-harvested vegetable), and commands high prices at the market. Siberian onion is an important ethnobotanic food plant for the indigenous Ainu people of Japan. In the Ainu language it is called pukusa, kitobiru, or ( since \\"biru/hiru\\" is a Japanese word for onion-type plants), simply kito. Siberian onion comes into season in Hokkaido for foraging from early to mid-May. The Ainu traditionally gather the leaves (but not the whole bulb), which are chopped up and dried for future use. The plant may be used by the Ainu in the savory soup called , or in the , described as a type of stew using multiple ingredients, or a dish where ingredients are tossed in animal fat oil. In modern days, the leafstalk can be preserved by steeping in soy sauce, or the fresh leaves can be made into ohitashi (parboiled and served plain or with dashi flavor), made into gy≈çza (pot-sticker dumplings), or blended into a tamagoyaki-type omelet. The young unraveled leaves with a stalk about 1 cm (half-inch) have rich flavor and fragrance and are especially prized. Also, the stalks being commercially grown by blanching (cf. white asparagus) have been gaining popularity. There are a number of inedible or poisonous plants that can be mistaken for victory onions in Japan, and those reported cases of consumption and illness include: Veratrum album (Ja: baikeis≈ç), Veratrum stamineum (Ja: ko-baikeis≈ç), Colchicum autumnale (Ja:inu-safuran) and lily of the valley. The distinctive smell should tell it apart. = Korea = Myeongi-jangajji (pickled Siberian onion leaves) In Korea, the A. ochotense and A. microdictyon are called sanmaneul (, \\"mountain garlic\\"). While the official name for A. ochotense is Ulleung sanmaneul (, \\"Ulleung Island mountain garlic\\"), the most common name used by Korean people is myeongi (), whose romanized form (along with Siberian onion) is an English name of the plant. Myeongi is also called myeonginamul (), because it is considered a namul (vegetable). Myeongi is a specialty of Ulleung Island, where the leaves grow wider and hardier. The leaves and the scaly bulb of myeongi are most often eaten as a namul-type side dish, or as a ssam vegetable for a samgyeopsal (grilled pork belly) meal. Myeongi is also eaten pickled as a jangajji-type side dish, or used as the last ingredient in dak-gomtang (\\"chicken bone soup\\"). = Siberia = In Siberia, the young shoots are eaten.  Medicinal  = Japan = In Japan, pukusa or Siberian onion has been used as a folk remedy among the Ainu. For example, it is administered as a diuretic to treat urine blockage relating to certain stomach disorders. = Korea = In traditional Korean medicine, myeongi was considered to be a warming herb, a stomachic, and a detoxicant. As a herb, it was used to treat indigestion, heatburn, small abscesses, and bites and stings from venomous insects. The seed was used to treat nocturnal emission.  Magical  In Japan, Ainu folklore held that due to its odor, Siberian onion was capable of repelling diseases. When an epidemic broke out, the onion would be left hanging at the entrances to the village or dangled from the eaves of each house.

Designed by Tennessee architect William Crutchfield and built in 1918, this unusual log structure more closely resembles vacation houses found in the mountain areas of the southern United States than it those found in Maine. It is located on the north shore of Walker Pond, off Maine State Route 176. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. Description and history Topside is located in eastern Brookfield on a property running from State Route 1976 down to the shore of Walker Pond, a large body of water on the border with Sedgwick. The main house, one of three buildings on the property, is situated close to the shore. It is a 1-1/2 story log structure, set on a fieldstone foundation, with a clipped gable roof shingled in asphalt but shaped to resemble typical thatch roofs. Matching clipped-gable projections are set at the corners of the waterfront side, and a pair of shed-roof dormers appear on the land side. Windows are diamond-pane casement throughout. The logs the house is built out of are unusually large spruce logs that were hand- hewn to fit. The wrought iron hardware fixtures were hand-forged by a blacksmith working on site. and The main house is joined by a stone passageway to two other buildings, both built with similar materials. One is a single-story guest house with three bedrooms, and the other is a three-story structure that houses a water tower and more guest quarters. The property was developed in 1918 for the Patten family to a rough plan developed by Tennessee architect William Crutchfield. Construction was done by a Maine crew without the architect's oversight, and cost about $60,000.

The business was started in 1945 by James Thornton Prince, and in 1980 ownership was passed to his great-niece Andr√© Prince Jeffries. Origins While impossible to verify, the development of hot chicken is reportedly accidental. Prince was purportedly a womanizer, and after a particularly late night his girlfriend at the time cooked him a fried chicken breakfast with hot pepper as revenge. Prince, however, liked the taste so much that he and his brothers created their own recipe and opened the Bar- B-Que Chicken Shack. The caf√© was originally located at 28th Ave. and Jefferson St., but moved downtown into Hell‚Äôs Half Acre and close to the Ryman Auditorium, home of the Grand Ole Opry in its heyday., the Opry stars were headed there after every performance. With the atmosphere of segregation and being a favorite of the Opry's stars, a separate room was built for white guests. Whites walked through the main dining room and the kitchen to reach the separate room at the back of the building. It moved to its East Nashville location on Ewing Dr. in 1988. When Thornton Prince died, his brother Will took over. His wife Maude ran the business when he passed. In 1980, Maude decided that Thornton's great-niece Andr√© Prince Jeffries should take over Prince‚Äôs. Jeffries renamed the restaurant by taking out the BBQ in the name. Honors and awards The Travel Channel show Food Paradise has named Prince's as Nashville's best place to get hot chicken (2013-02-06 episode). They were also on the network's Bizarre Foods America (2014-04-07 episode) and Man v. Food Nation (2011-06-08 episode).

After the success of her first show, she started selling her jewelry through luxury fashion stores worldwide such as Colette Paris, Maxfield LA, Browns London, Selfridges London, Luisa Via Roma Florence, Jeffreys New York, Joyce Hong Kong, etc. In 1995, Amfitheatrof started consulting for fashion brands designing jewelry and accessories. She worked with the following brands: Rifat Ozbek, Balenciaga, Alice Temperley, Chanel, Fendi and Marni. For Marni, she launched their first eyewear collection and consulted for their accessories including shoes and bags. For Chanel, Amfitheatrof designed all the hardware for bags, shoes, belts and a line of silver jewelry. Amfitheatrof became the in-house senior jewelry designer in 2001 for the British royal jeweller, Asprey & Garrard. A year after the brand split up, Amfitheatrof continued as head designer for another year with Garrard. During her position as the consultant creative director at Wedgwood in 2008, Amfitheatrof created many new tabletop and glassware collections including their archival tea collection, which is still one of the best selling gift items.  Art  In 2001 she set up RS&A;, a London-based contemporary artist agency with Mark Saunders and Julia Royse. They commissioned artists Yayoi Kusama, Maurizio Cattelan, the Chapman brothers - Jake and Dinos Chapman, Paul McCarthy and Damien Hirst to name a few. Both \\"Art of Chess\\" and \\"Meet the Artist\\" projects were exhibited internationally and are part of major private collections. From 2010 to 2013, Amfitheatrof became the head curator of the Gucci Museo in Florence and curated exhibitions globally. In 2010, Amfitheatrof organized and curated the Damien Hirst exhibition \\"Cornucopia\\" at the Mus√©e Oc√©anographique in Monaco. In 2011, Amfitheatrof curated and selected 23 works from the Francois Pinault Collection of Contemporary Art that was exhibited for the first time in Asia, in a show entitled \\"Agony and Ecstasy\\". This was presented at SongEun ArtSpace, Seoul, Korea. Then followed by the first solo exhibition in Asia of the Chapman brother's in 2013, entitled \\"The Sleep of Reason.\\" It comprised their contemporary works over the past two decades. Again, presented at SongEun ArtSpace in Seoul, Korea. In 2010, Amfitheatrof opened the Gucci Museo in Florence as Head Curator, featuring the video art titled \\"Amore e Morte\\" (2011) of American artist Bill Viola; followed by British artist \\"Lo Spirito Vola\\" (2012); then Cindy Sherman's \\"Early Works\\" (2013) exhibition, that included the photographic series \\"Bus Riders\\" and \\"Murder Mystery\\", and a short film \\"Dollhouse\\". The last show Amfitheatrof curated was the 2013 solo exhibition of Portuguese artist Joana Vasconcelos: Red Independent Heart (2010), Psycho (2010), Lavoisier (2011) and Hand Made (2008). All the works exhibited at the Gucci Museo were loaned by the Francois Pinault Collection.  Tiffany & Co.  After five years of searching for a design director, Tiffany & Co appointed Amfitheatrof. She became the first-ever female Design Director in 2014. Her first collection Tiffany T was launched exactly a year after her arrival. She not only designed a range of minimalist necklaces, cuffs, and rings meant for layering and daily wear, but also created the advertising campaign which was shot by Craig McDean, styled by Karl Templer and featured Freja Beha Erichsen. The collection was designed by a woman for women. This was followed by the collections \\"Victoria Bows & Infinity\\" (2015), \\"Return to Love\\" (2016), \\"1837\\" (2017), \\"Collectibles\\" (2017), \\"Sweet Nothings\\" (2017). During her three and a half years as the head design director, she spearheaded the repositioning of the haute joaillerie for Tiffany Blue Book Collection that comprised 250 unique pieces. The collections were titled \\"The Art of the Sea\\" (2015), and \\"The Art of Transformation\\" (2016), and \\"The Art of the Wild\\" (2017). Amfitheatrof elevated Tiffany & Co.'s position in haute joaillerie. Amfitheatrof's Tiffany pieces were also recognized on the red carpet for award season. Cate Blanchett's turquoise beaded necklace for the 87th Academy Awards and diamond drop earrings for the 88th Academy Awards were highly publicized. In the 89th Academy Awards, both Emma Stone and Jessica Biel wore Amfitheatrof's \\"Whispers of the Rainforest\\" jewelry. Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Garner are fans of Amfitheatrof's Tiffany designs as well. Breaking from tradition for the first time ever, Amfitheatrof created a partnership between Tiffany & Co and Dover Street Market. This collection named \\"Out of Retirement\\" (2015) marks the first time Dover Street Market launched and supported a project of this magnitude across all their locations and markets. Tiffany & Co. broke from its storied tradition by partnering with another retailer. The \\"Out of Retirement\\" collection was inspired by the Tiffany archives. Amfitheatrof also designed the three installations in each Dover Street Market location, inspired by Gene Moore. Amfitheatrof was responsible for all of Tiffany categories, these included small leather goods and watches. She launched the Half-moon SLG Collection with wave-embossed leather and gold-plated solid brass hardware. Amfitheatrof is also responsible for the design of the East West Automatic watch collection, with a dial turned 90 degrees. Her last collection which launched in May 2017, the gold, silver and leather Tiffany HardWear Jewelry Collection. This collection features Lady Gaga in the advertising campaign.  Louis Vuitton  Francesca was appointed as Artistic Director for Jewelry and Watches at Louis Vuitton in March 2018.  Thief and Heist  In March 2019 Francesca Amfitheatrof launched her own line, a new drop-driven, direct- to-consumer collection. In it she brought back the tag bracelet that was launched in the late '90s and created a cult following. 20 years later she brought it out again and did a collaboration with Seventeen, one of the sensational groups in the Kpop community, and is now planning on designing the group's signature ring. .  Personal life  Amfitheatrof moved from London to New York with her husband Ben Curwin and two children.  References  American jewelry designers Tiffany & Co.

Total Population :375 Male Population: 191 Female Population: 184 Pullong is locally and originally named as 'Boachim'. 'Boa' means 'dance' and 'Chim' means 'salt'. It is named so because it is believed to be the first place where salt was found and the folk dance of the region originated. It is a small village in Tirap district of Arunachal Pradesh. The ancient original inhabitants of the land are referred to as Kasik. Boachim is 15 km away from Khonsa, the district H/Q of Tirap and lies on NH-315. It is the leading producer of oranges in the region, well known for its extra sweetness and is the pride of the village. There exist the system of chieftainship in the village. The inhabitants of Boachim belongs to Nocte tribe. Nocte means \\"villagers\\". They commonly speak Kasik dialect which is the ancient and original dialect of the Noctes. The word Kasik means \\"ancient language\\". Except for these three villages - Boachim (pullong), Tupi and Noksa, the rest speaks other ethnic dialect. Although kasik is the original dialect of the Noctes, today it is known only to a handful. But the \\"Kasik\\" dialect has been found to be in used in the villages of Hilani naga gaon and Boantoan which fall under the Sivasagar district and Dibrugarh district of Assam. Pullong is connected by road with National Highway 512A passing to Khonsa. Pullong is not connected with the rail network. The nearest railway station is at Naharkatia in Assam. It can be reached by a state Transport Bus or a mini reserved vehicle taking a time of 4 hours, from Dibrugarh and Tinsukia in Assam.

While serving as a medical orderly during World War I in Sainte-Menehould, France, Metzinger bore witness to the ravages of war firsthand. Rather than depicting such horrors, Metzinger chose to represent a poilu sitting at a game of chess, smoking a cigarette. The military subject of this painting is possibly a self-portrait. During March 1915, Metzinger was called to serve the military,L'Intransigeant, La Bo√Æte aux Lettres, 23 March 1915, p. 2 and was invalided out of service later that year.Larousse, Dictionnaire de la peinture, Jean Metzinger Soldier at a Game of Chess was painted either before or during his mobilization.Soldat jouant aux √©checs: un portrait cubiste magistral, Mus√©e de Lod√®ve Evidence found in a letter by Metzinger addressed to L√©once Rosenberg suggests the work was painted before his March 1915 mobilization, and possibly late 1914. This distilled form of Cubism, soon to be known as Crystal Cubism, is consistent with Metzinger's shift, between 1914 and 1916, towards a strong emphasis on large, flat surface activity, with overlapping geometric planes. The manifest primacy of the underlying architectonics of the composition, entrenched in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the painting. Color remains primordial but is moderate and sharply delineated by boundary conditions.Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, Cubist works, 1910‚Äì1921, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

The vertical composition is painted in a geometrically advanced Cubist style, representing a solitary French soldier playing a game of chess. He wears a military hat (k√©pi) and bears a cigarette in his mouth. Because of this, Joann Moser suggests that this may be a self-portrait. Images of Metzinger often depicted him with a cigarette in his mouth: consider for example Robert Delaunay's 1906 Portrait of Metzinger (Man with a Tulip); Suzanne Phocas, Portrait de Metzinger, 1926.Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J.

His facial features are eminently stylized, simple, geometric, resting on rounded shoulders delineated by a rectangular structure superimposed with elemental monochromatic planes that compose the background. Depth of field is practically nonexistent. Blues, reds, green and black dominate the composition. The table‚Äîtreated in faux bois, or trompe-l'≈ìil‚Äîand the chessboard are practically seen from above, while the chess pieces are observed from the side; his right hand is fused within. \\"Direct reference to observed reality\\" is present, but the emphasis is placed on the self- sufficiency of the painting as an object unto itself. \\"Orderly qualities\\" and the \\"autonomous purity\\" of the composition are a prime concern.Christopher Green, Late Cubism, MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009 The overall composition is highly crystalline in its geometricized materialization, consisting of superimposed synthetic planes; something Albert Gleizes would later refer to, in La Peinture et ses lois (1922), as \\"simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane\\".Peter Brooke, Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century, Yale University Press, 2001, pp. 85-102, Gleizes too had been working along similar lines during his mobilization at Toul, where he painted Portrait of an Army Doctor (Portrait d'un m√©decin militaire), Solomon R.

That regiment participated in a brutal offensive on 25 May 1915 in Aix-Noulette, where contact with a bitter enemy caused unusually heavy losses. Metzinger had been stationed further south of the devastated area. The town of Sainte-Menehould, located south of the Forest of Argonne, became a command and control center of the Marne.La Marne et la Grande Guerre dans les collections photographiques et cin√©matographiques de l‚ÄôECPAD, Les archives de la SPCA sur la Marne, 1915‚Äì1919 From January 1915, St. Menehould was the command post of the IIIe arm√©e fran√ßaise under General Maurice Sarrail. The city suffered its first bombing campaign by canon the same year. Thereafter, aircraft and zeppelins took over the skies. In September 1915 the successful counter-offensive moved the front closer to the German border.L'Histoire , accessed 24 January 2011. Crystal Cubism The Cubist considerations manifested prior to the outset of World War I‚Äîsuch as the fourth dimension, dynamism of modern life, the occult, and Henri Bergson's concept of duration‚Äîhad now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal reference frame. This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists under contract with L√©once Rosenberg‚Äîincluding Metzinger, Juan Gris, Jacques Lipchitz, Henri Laurens, Auguste Herbin, Joseph Csaky and Gino Severini‚Äîleading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by the critic Maurice Raynal. By its very date of execution, Metzinger's Soldier at a Game of Chess was precursor to a style that would become known as Crystal Cubism.H. Harvard Arnason, History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Photography, edited by Peter Kalb, Pub. Prentice Hall, 2004 Comparisons have been made between war-time works of Metzinger and Juan Gris. These works were created within a specific context, a particular timeframe, a relatively restrained milieu, and influenced by a diverse grouping of factors. Metzinger's milieu at the time included his close friend Juan Gris. Both artists (with Lipchitz) exchanged ideas and worked together in Paris and Beaulieu-l√®s-Loches. Despite theoretical or conceptual differences, the works by these artists (and practically all those who exhibited at Rosenberg's Galerie de L'Effort Moderne) bear striking similarities. > The 'Latin' virtues of clarity and order were indeed dominants in the recent > works of most who exhibited. Nowhere was this more so than is the works of > three artists who had been in close contact with one another from 1916... > the painters Gris and Jean Metzinger, and the sculptor Jacques Lipchitz... > It is above all the wartime work of these three Cubists that can be analysed > as a move towards order alongside as process of distillation. (Green, 1987, > p. 25) The new aesthetic unity associated with the underlying geometric structure of the works created by these artists is what would lead to the appellation Crystal Cubism. Metzinger and Gris were at the forefront, among the leaders of this second phase of Cubism.Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kr√∂ller-M√ºller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993, Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60July 09: Futurism at the Tate Modern: a review by Peter Brooke, From Cubism to Classicism, Painting and its Laws, From Cubism to Classicism by Gino Severini / Painting and its laws by Albert Gleizes, Francis Boutle, 2001, Andr√© Salmon, Cubisme: Exposition Metzinger, L'Europe Nouvelle, 18 January 1919, pp. 139-40Paul Derm√©e, Jean Metzinger, S.I.C., Nos. 42, 43, 30 March ‚Äì 15 April 1919, p.13 In Crystal Cubist works, the distinction between the background and the figure are blurred. Rather than gradients of tone or color, the works are painted with flat, uniform sections of tone and color. Though highly abstract in overall construction, objects or elements of the real world are present. The primacy of the manifest geometric manifold, the angular juxtaposition of the surface planes, are distinct features of this second phase of Cubism. This reductionist style is consistent with a process of distillation otherwise auxiliary before the war. During 1916, Sunday discussions at the studio of Lipchitz, included Metzinger, Gris, Pablo Picasso, Diego Rivera, Henri Matisse, Amedeo Modigliani, Pierre Reverdy, Andr√© Salmon, Max Jacob, and Blaise Cendrars.Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9‚Äì24 Metzinger and Gris were in close contact. In a letter written to Albert Gleizes in Barcelona during the war, dated 4 July 1916, Metzinger writes: > After two years of study I have succeeded in establishing the basis of this > new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist > perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a > metaphysical perspective‚ÄîI take full responsibility for the word. You can't > begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working > outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no > more secret for me.

A new harmony. Don't take > this word harmony in its ordinary [banal] everyday sense, take it in its > original [primitif] sense. Everything is number. The mind [esprit] hates > what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible. That is > the secret. There in nothing more to it [pas de reste √† l'op√©ration]. > Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, lasting art is never anything more > than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the > internal and the external, the self [le moi] and the world. (Metzinger, 4 > July 1916)Peter Brooke, Higher Geometries, Precedents: Charles Henry and > Peter Lenz, The subjective experience of space, Metzinger, Gris and Maurice > Princet The 'new perspective' according to Daniel Robbins, \\"was a mathematical relationship between the ideas in his mind and the exterior world\\". The 'fourth space' for Metzinger was the space of the mind. In a second letter to Gleizes, dated 26 July 1916, Metzinger writes: > If painting was an end in itself it would enter into the category of the > minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a > language‚Äîand it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a > bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a > right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, > however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture‚Äîthe End, it > is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916) Continuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris: > Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I > cannot understand why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, > I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take > from things what seems to me to have meaning and be most suitable to express > my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those > stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting. Some of the ideas expressed in these letters to Gleizes were reproduced in an article written by Paul Derm√©e, published in the magazine SIC in 1919,Jean Metzinger, Une Esth√©tique, by Paul Derm√©e, SIC, Volume 4, Nos. 42, 43, March 30 and April 15, 1919, p. 336 but the existence of letters themselves remained unknown until the mid-1980s. From 1916, Lipchitz, Gris and Metzinger had been in close contact with one another. The three had just signed contracts with the dealer, art collector and gallery owner L√©once Rosenberg. It is the work of these three artists, executed during the war, that can be analyzed as a process of distillation in a shift towards order and purity. This process would continue through 1918 when the three spent part of the summer together in Beaulieu-l√®s-Loches to escape the bombardment of Paris. At an opening held at the Mus√©e National d'Art Moderne in Paris, on 9 June 1947, L√©once Rosenberg related his impressions to H√©l√®ne Bauret: > In the painting \\"La Tricoteuse\\",Jean Metzinger, Tricoteuse, D√©p√¥t du Centre > Pompidou, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen, Agence Photographique de la R√©union > des mus√©es nationaux et du Grand Palais des Champs-Elys√©es hanging next to > works by Gris, Metzinger reveals himself more of a painter, more natural, > more flexible [plus souple] than Gris. Often, Gris would tell me: \\"Ah! If I > could brush [brosser] like the French!\\" Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1914‚Äì15 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912‚Äì13, in paintings such as Au V√©lodrome (1912) and Le Fumeur (1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief. Metzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a \\"new perspective\\" in accord with the \\"laws of displacement\\". In the case of Le Fumeur Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in Au V√©lodrome. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards Crystal Cubism: works created before the War, and after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as Femme au miroir, private collection; Landscape with Open Window (1915)Jean Metzinger, Landscape with Open Window, signed and dated JMetzinger 1915, oil on canvas, 73 √ó 54 cm, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes (Artsy) Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts de Nantes; Femme √† la dentelle (1916) Mus√©e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Summer (1916)Jean Metzinger, 1916, Summer (Sommeren), oil on canvas, 74.5 x 55.5 cm, Statens Museum for Kunst Statens Museum for Kunst; Le go√ªter (1917)Jean Metzinger, 1917, Le go√ªter, oil on canvas, 92 x 67 cm, Galerie Daniel Malingue, Paris Galerie Daniel Malingue; T√™te de femme (1916‚Äì17) private collection; Femme devant le miroir (c. 1914) private collection; Femme au miroir (1916‚Äì17) Donn Shapiro collection; Maison cubistes au bord de l'eau (1916);Jean Metzinger, 1916, Maison cubiste au bord de l'eau, oil on canvas, 73.03 x 59.99 cm, private collection (MutualArt) and Femme et paysage √† l'aqueduc (1916).Jean Metzinger, 1916, Femme et paysage √† l'aqueduc (Woman and landscape with an aqueduct), oil and sand on canvas, 73 x 54 cm (28 ¬æ x 21 ¬º in.), Christie's Paris, 2 May 2012, lot 23, est. 400,000‚Äì600,000 EUR, sold 937,000 EUR > If the beauty of a painting depends solely on its pictorial qualities: > retain only certain elements, those that seem to suit our expressive needs, > then with these elements, build a new object, an object which we can adapt > to the surface of the painting without subterfuge.

Each found the space and time to make art, sustaining differing types of Cubism (primarily sketches) during the war years. They discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the novelty and anonymity of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an evasion of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation. Following the armistice and the series of exhibitions at Galerie de L'Effort Moderne, the rift between art and life‚Äîand the overt distillation that came with it‚Äîhad become the canon of Cubist orthodoxy; and it would persist with the peace that followed. stereoscopic image Metzinger served very close to the front during World War I as a medical aide, and was probably with his surgical automobile when Soldier at a Game of Chess was painted.The Art of JAMA: Covers and Essays from The Journal of the American Medical Association, Volume 3, M. Therese Southgate, Oxford University Press, Mar 17, 2011 However, very few of his works represent scenes associated with war. And rather than delving into the actual carnage of war, this painting evokes an idealized theory of war. Instead, his interest is captured by mathematical rationality, order, his faith in humanity and modernity. The war, however, is very present in this work, by the presence of the soldier and his engagement with chess, simultaneously an intellectual game and a battle. The soldier plays an abstract strategy game in which, whatever his strategy, his existence is adroitly dependent on non-deterministic results of his tactical decisions. His role is to minimize luck and the apparition of undesirable possibilities. As J. Mark Thompson wrote in his article \\"Defining the Abstract\\": > There is an intimate relationship between such games and puzzles: every > board position presents the player with the puzzle, What is the best move?, > which in theory could be solved by logic alone. A good abstract game can > therefore be thought of as a \\"family\\" of potentially interesting logic > puzzles, and the play consists of each player posing such a puzzle to the > other. Good players are the ones who find the most difficult puzzles to > present to their opponents.Thompson, J. Mark. (2000, July) Defining the > Abstract. The Games Journal.

However, by the time his exhibition at the Galerie de L'Effort Moderne at the outset of 1919‚Äîjust as before the war‚ÄîMetzinger was considered one of the leaders of the movement.Picasso Posse: The Mona Lisa of Cubism, Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast His paintings at this exhibition were perceived as highly significant. Images were now created solely out of the imagination of the artist (or virtually so), independent of any visual starting point. Observed reality and all that is referred to in life are no longer needed as foundation for artistic production. The synthetic manipulation of abstract geometric shapes, or \\"mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the le moi and the world\\" (in Metzinger's words), was the ideal metaphysical starting point. Only afterwards would those structures be made to denote objects of predilection. Indeed, the wartime distillation of Metzinger's Cubism came with an acceleration in the type of games that could be played tactically with paradox by manipulating conflicting predications of planimetric flatness and the perspectival depth of space. This game playing would culminate between 1917 and 1919, but is already palpable in Soldier at a Game of Chess. The perspectival presentation is only fragmentary‚Äîalmost non-Cubist in abstract guise‚Äîand lacks coherence, so that the resulting composition is throughout paradoxical. There are sufficient indications to suggest a soldier and the activity in which he's engaged; his military cap (and an echo of it in red), a hand (however transparent it may be), a face (with a cigarette in its mouth), the alternating colored squares of a chessboard, a rook, a pawn and other chess pieces. But the figure and his setting simultaneously fuse as an arrangement of planes that cancel those indications of depth any greater than a relief. And the disorientations are compounded by Metzinger's placing of green and orange in the soldiers upward- turned face, while the red of his arms espouse the echo-like profile of the face and cap in the background plane directed downward toward the game, for it becomes almost inevitable to see the soldier's alter ego; an effect that both pulls the man into the background of the composition and pushes him forward towards the viewer, again, canceling out indications of depth. Here, Metzinger uses a checkerboard and wooden table to establish a clearly demarcated fore- plane that is non-fixed in relation to which its 'hovering' chess pieces are situated. This profound battle between planimetric and perspectival dimensions as here in Soldier at a Game of Chess has precedence in Metzinger's Cubism of 1912‚Äì13, but the absence of decorative elements, the clarity and sense of order, and degree of game-playing with conflicting codes for the personification of space that he refined during the war places the artist at the forefront of the nascent form of art dubbed Crystal Cubism by the critic Maurice Raynal.Alex Mittelmann, 2012, Jean Metzinger, Divisionism, Cubism, Neoclassicism and Post Cubism Exhibitions and reproductions JAMA JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association, 26 May 1993, cover, Jean Metzinger, Soldier at a Game of Chess On 26 May 1993 Soldier at a Game of Chess was reproduced on the cover of JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association, a peer-reviewed medical journal published by the American Medical Association covering all aspects of the biomedical sciences.JAMA, The Journal of the American Medical Association, M.

One year before Metzinger painted Soldier at a Game of Chess, the German physicist Max von Laue won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914 for his discovery of the diffraction of X-rays by crystals.Hentschel, 1996, Appendix F, see entry for Max von Laue.Max von Laue Biography ‚Äì Deutsches Historisches Museum BerlinEwald, P.

He was arrested by South Korea while fighting as a guerilla in Jirisan in January 1952 while serving as a war correspondent of the Korean Peoples Army during the Korean War. Ri served 34 years in prison in South Korea. During his incarceration, Ri was offered his freedom in exchange for signing a form renouncing his political beliefs but repeatedly refused. Ri was released in 1988 but South Korean authorities continued to restrict his activities. He was repatriated to North Korea in March 1993 and was reunited with his wife and daughter. Following his repatriation, Ri was in ill health, apparently due to the conditions he experienced in prison. He underwent medical treatment in the United States in 1996. After his health improved, his suffering in prison was put into film by North Korea. Ri's numerous public appearances made him popular in the North. However, the film's mentions of hunger strikes ‚Äì and therefore the suggestion that food in South Korean prisons was so abundant that one could go on hunger strike ‚Äì had the undesired effect of suggesting to the North Koreans that life in the South Korean prisons were not as bad as believed. Ri died on 16 June 2007 and was given a hero's funeral. His funeral committee was chaired by Kim Yong-nam with Choe Thae-bok as its vice-chairman and had 55 members including Kim Yong-il.

He held the seat from 2008 through 2020. Background Gisclair was born in Raceland in Lafourche Parish and served in the United States Air Force, in which he was a staff sergeant and graduate of the Electronics Counter-Measures Technical School. He is a member of the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Since 2004, he has been general manager of Donlin Construction, a homebuilding firm in Larose. Since 1998, he has owned and managed the Bayou Portuguese Citrus Farm. Since 2001, he has owned and managed Coastal Broadcasting of Lafourche. From 1979 to 2003, he owned Electronics Unlimited, Inc. Gisclair owns a sports radio, KLRZ in Larose, and had his own program \\"The Rajun' Cajun,\\" the same name as the University of Louisiana at Lafayette athletic teams. He often debated on the program with Loulan J. Pitre, Sr. (1921-2010), a businessman and actor who went out of his way to stir up controversy. Pitre was the father of four sons, including filmmaker Glen Pitre and attorney Loulan Pitre, Jr., Gisclair's predecessor in the House. Since 1987, Gisclair has been a member of the South Lafourche High School Athletic Boosters Club. He is affiliated with the Chamber of Commerce. He is a Roman Catholic. He and his wife, Linda C. Gisclair, have three daughters, Gretchen, Andrea, and Kristy. Political life In 2007, Gisclair was first elected to the House in a runoff with a Republican candidate Mitchell R. \\"Mitch\\" Theriot (born July 1963) of Raceland, who served as Democrat in the state House from 1992 to 2000. This time as a Republican, Theriot led in the primary, 4,797 votes (36.9 percent) to Gisclair's 4,396 (33.8 percent). The balance was held by a second Democrat, John Melancon, Jr., with 3,821 votes (29.4 percent). The position opened when then the two-term Republican (and later No Party registrant in Orleans Parish) Loulan Pitre, Jr., did not seek reelection. In 1999 and 2003, Mitch Theriot ran for the seat as a Democrat but narrowly lost each time to Pitre. In the 2003 race, Pitre polled 7,618 votes (52 percent); Theriot, 7,035 votes (48 percent). Theriot switched parties for the 2007 race against Gisclair. In the second round of balloting Gisclair prevailed by 121 votes, 4,128 (50.7 percent) to Theriot's 4,007 (49.3 percent). In 2011, Gisclair won his second term in the House by defeating a No Party candidate, Micah Hebert, 5,465 votes (58.6 percent) to 3,859 (41.4 percent). Representative Gisclair is a member of the Louisiana Rural Caucus, the Acadiana and Jefferson Parish delegations, and the Democratic Caucus. He sits on these committees: (1) Agriculture, Forestry, Aquaculture, and Rural Development, (2) Military and Veterans Affairs, (3) Natural Resources and Environment, and (4) Transportation, Highways, and Public Works. Gisclair ranks between 39 and 67 percent in legislative ratings from the conservative Louisiana Association of Business and Industry. Since 2008, he has been rated 100 percent by Louisiana Right to Life. In 2014, Gisclair co-sponsored the requirement that abortion providers have hospital admitting privileges near their clinics. That same year, he voted to extend the time for implementation of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He also voted to forbid the practice of transporting dogs in open truck beds on interstate highways. In 2013, Gisclair voted to increase judicial pay and for lifetime concealed carry gun permits. In 2012, he did not vote on the issues of cell phones while driving or state tax incentives to recruit a National Basketball Association team to Louisiana but opposed the reducing the number of hours that polling locations remain open. In 2011, he co-sponsored the requirement for drug testing of welfare recipients. Early in 2016, Gisclair joined a 76-28 House majority to support legislation by Representative Katrina Jackson, a Democrat from West Monroe, that increases beginning April 1, 2016, the state sales tax by one cent over eighteen months, later increased to twenty-seven months to extend through June 30, 2018. Joining Gisclair in support of the bill were area lawmakers Tanner Magee and Jerome Zeringue, both Republicans from Houma. Voting against the bill were Independent Dee Richard of Thibodaux in Lafourche Parish and Republican Beryl Amedee of Gray in Terrebonne Parish.

The tribe comprises two geographically separate subgroups. The Utmanzai are settled in the North Waziristan Agency and the Ahmadzai are in the South Waziristan Agency and Bannu District. Those subgroups are in turn divided further, for example into Utmanzai tribes such as the Bakakhel and Janikhel.  Origin legend  The Darweshkhel are said to descend from MusƒÅ, son of Khidrai, son of Wazƒ´r. MusƒÅ was a religious man and so was nicknamed Darwesh (\\"fakir\\"). Musa is said to have died in the hills near KhwƒÅja Khidar, at the border between present-day South and North Waziristan. Another son of Khidrai was Masud, who is said to be the progenitor of the Masid tribe, another branch of the Waziri confederacy. Besides Musa Darwesh and Masud, Khidrai is also said to had a third son Mubarak, who in turn had a son called Gurbuz, the namesake of the third branch (Gurbuz) of the Waziri confederacy.

Born in Rathcormac, County Cork, Murphy first arrived on the inter-county scene when he first linked up with the Cork junior team. He made his senior debut during the 1946 championship before later joining the Dublin senior team. Murphy enjoyed a successful career, winning one All-Ireland medal, two Munster medals and one Leinster medal. He was an All-Ireland runner-up on two occasions. Murphy represented the Leinster inter-provincial team at various times, however, he never won a Railway Cup medal. At club level he was a one-time championship medallist with C√∫ Chulainn's while he also played with Bride Rovers, Sarsfields and Civil Service. Murphy retired from inter-county hurling following the conclusion of the 1953 championship Playing career Inter- county Murphy first played for Cork as a member of the junior team on 19 May 1946. His performance in this grade led to him being drafted onto the Cork senior team. He made his championship debut on 9 June 1946 in a 2-9 to 2-1 Munster quarter-final defeat of Clare. He immediately became a regular member of the starting fifteen and later won his first Munster medal following a 3-8 to 1-3 defeat of Limerick. On 1 September 1946 Cork faced old rivals Kilkenny in the All-Ireland decider. While some had written off Cork's chances, they took an interval lead of four points. With ten minutes remaining Cork's lead was reduced to just two points, however, goals by O'Riordan and Joe Kelly secured a 7-6 to 3-8 victory. The victory gave Murphy an All-Ireland medal. Cork retained their provincial dominance in 1947 with Murphy picking up a second winners' medal following a 2-6 to 2-3 defeat of Limerick once again. The subsequent All-Ireland final on 7 September 1947 was a repeat of the previous year with Kilkenny providing the opposition. The stakes were high for both sides as Cork were aiming for a record sixth championship in seven seasons while Kilkenny were aiming to avoid becoming the first team to lose three consecutive All-Ireland finals. In what has been described as one of the greatest deciders of all-time, little separated the two teams over the course if the hour. A Joe Kelly goal put Cork one point ahead with time almost up, however, Terry Leahy proved to be the hero of the day. He converted a free to level the sides again before sending over the match-winner from the subsequent puck-out. With that the game was over and Cork were beaten by 0-14 to 2-7. It was the fifth time that Kilkenny had pipped Cork by a single point in an All- Ireland final. By 1952 Murphy had switched allegiance and was now lining out with Dublin. He won a Leinster medal that year following a 7-2 to 3-6 trouncing of reigning champions Wexford. On 7 September 1952 Dublin faced Murphy's native county of Cork in the All-Ireland decider. Liam Dowling scored a vital goal in the first half to give Cork the interval lead. Dublin's attack collapsed in the second half as Dowling scored a second goal. The 2-14 to 0-7 score line resulted in defeat for Murphy.

Over the next three decades, the group diversified into areas including food processing, textiles, insurance, securities, and retail. Samsung entered the electronics industry in the late 1960s and the construction and shipbuilding industries in the mid-1970s; these areas would drive its subsequent growth. Following Lee's death in 1987, Samsung was separated into four business groups ‚Äì Samsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group and Hansol Group.

Samsung started out as a small trading company with forty employees located in Su-dong (now Ingyo-dong). It dealt in dried-fish, locally-grown groceries and noodles. The company prospered and Lee moved its head office to Seoul in 1947. When the Korean War broke out, he was forced to leave Seoul. He started a sugar refinery in Busan named Cheil Jedang. In 1954, Lee founded Cheil Mojik and built the plant in Chimsan-dong, Daegu. It was the largest woollen mill ever in the country. Samsung diversified into many different areas. Lee sought to establish Samsung as a leader in a wide range of industries. Samsung moved into lines of business such as insurance, securities, and retail. In 1947, Cho Hong-jai, the Hyosung group's founder, jointly invested in a new company called Samsung Mulsan Gongsa, or the Samsung Trading Corporation, with the Samsung's founder Lee Byung-chull. The trading firm grew to become the present-day Samsung C&T; Corporation. After a few years, Cho and Lee separated due to differences in management style. Cho wanted a 30 equity share. Samsung Group was separated into Samsung Group and Hyosung Group, Hankook Tire and other businesses. In the late 1960s, Samsung Group entered the electronics industry. It formed several electronics-related divisions, such as Samsung Electronics Devices, Samsung Electro-Mechanics, Samsung Corning and Samsung Semiconductor & Telecommunications, and made the facility in Suwon. Its first product was a black-and-white television set.  1970‚Äì1990  The SPC-1000, introduced in 1982, was Samsung's first personal computer (sold in the Korean market only) and used an audio cassette tape to load and save data ‚Äì the floppy drive was optional.

After Lee, the founder's death in 1987, Samsung Group was separated into four business groups‚ÄîSamsung Group, Shinsegae Group, CJ Group, Hansol Group and the JoongAng Group. Shinsegae (discount store, department store) was originally part of Samsung Group, separated in the 1990s from the Samsung Group along with CJ Group (Food/Chemicals/Entertainment/logistics), Hansol Group (Paper/Telecom), and the JoongAng Group (Media).

In 1982, it built a television assembly plant in Portugal; in 1984, a plant in New York; in 1985, a plant in Tokyo; in 1987, a facility in England; and another facility in Austin, Texas, in 1996. As of 2012, Samsung has invested more than in the Austin facility, which operates under the name Samsung Austin Semiconductor. This makes the Austin location the largest foreign investment in Texas and one of the largest single foreign investments in the United States.  1990‚Äì2000  Samsung started to rise as an international corporation in the 1990s. Samsung's construction branch was awarded contracts to build one of the two Petronas Towers in Malaysia, Taipei 101 in Taiwan and the Burj Khalifa in United Arab Emirates. In 1993, Lee Kun-hee sold off ten of Samsung Group's subsidiaries, downsized the company, and merged other operations to concentrate on three industries: electronics, engineering and chemicals. In 1996, the Samsung Group reacquired the Sungkyunkwan University foundation. Samsung became the world's largest producer of memory chips in 1992 and is the world's second-largest chipmaker after Intel (see Worldwide Top 20 Semiconductor Market Share Ranking Year by Year). In 1995, it created its first liquid-crystal display screen. Ten years later, Samsung grew to be the world's largest manufacturer of liquid-crystal display panels. Sony, which had not invested in large-size TFT-LCDs, contacted Samsung to cooperate, and, in 2006, S-LCD was established as a joint venture between Samsung and Sony in order to provide a stable supply of LCD panels for both manufacturers. S-LCD was owned by Samsung (50% plus one share) and Sony (50% minus one share) and operates its factories and facilities in Tanjung, South Korea. As of 26 December 2011, it was announced that Samsung had acquired the stake of Sony in this joint venture. Compared to other major Korean companies, Samsung survived the 1997 Asian financial crisis relatively unharmed. However, Samsung Motor was sold to Renault at a significant loss. , Renault Samsung is 80.1 percent owned by Renault and 19.9 percent owned by Samsung. Additionally, Samsung manufactured a range of aircraft from the 1980s to the 1990s. The company was founded in 1999 as Korea Aerospace Industries (KAI), the result of a merger between then three domestic major aerospace divisions of Samsung Aerospace, Daewoo Heavy Industries and Hyundai Space and Aircraft Company.

Samsung (Rollei) used its optic expertise on the crystals of a new line of 100% Swiss-made watches, designed by a team of watchmakers at Nouvelle Piquerez S.A. in Bassecourt, Switzerland. Rolex's decision to fight Rollei on every front stemmed from the close resemblance between the two names and fears that its sales would suffer as a consequence. In the face of such a threat, the Geneva firm decided to confront. This was also a demonstration of the Swiss watch industry's determination to defend itself when an established brand is threatened. Rolex sees this front-line battle as vital for the entire Swiss watch industry. Rolex has succeeded in keeping Rollei out of the German market. On 11 March 1995, the Cologne District court prohibited the advertising and sale of Rollei watch on German territory. In 1999, Rollei management bought out the company. ; Fokker ‚Äì Dutch aircraft maker : Samsung lost a chance to revive its failed bid to take over Dutch aircraft maker Fokker when other airplane makers rejected its offer to form a consortium.

Controversies Financial scandals The Samsung Group's chairman, Lee Kun-hee (left), with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, 2013 In 2007, former Samsung chief lawyer Kim Yong Chul claimed that he was involved in bribing and fabricating evidence on behalf of the group's chairman Lee Kun-hee and the company. Kim said that Samsung lawyers trained executives to serve as scapegoats in a \\"fabricated scenario\\" to protect Lee, even though those executives were not involved. Kim also told the media that he was \\"sidelined\\" by Samsung after he refused to pay a $3.3 million bribe to the U.S. Federal District Court judge presiding over a case where two of their executives were found guilty on charges related to memory chip price-fixing. Kim revealed that the company had raised a large number of secret funds through bank accounts illegally opened under the names of up to 1,000 Samsung executives‚Äîunder his own name, four accounts were opened to manage 5 billion won. Antitrust concerns \\"You can even say the Samsung chairman is more powerful than the President of South Korea. [South] Korean people have come to think of Samsung as invincible and above the law\\", said Woo Suk-hoon, host of a popular economics podcast in a Washington Post article headlined \\"In South Korea, the Republic of Samsung\\", published on 9 December 2012. Critics claimed that Samsung knocked out smaller businesses, limiting choices for South Korean consumers and sometimes colluded with fellow giants to fix prices while bullying those who investigate. Lee Jung-hee, a South Korean presidential candidate, said in a debate, \\"Samsung has the government in its hands. Samsung manages the legal world, the press, the academics and bureaucracy\\". Viral marketing The Fair Trade Commission of Taiwan is investigating Samsung and its local Taiwanese advertising agency for false advertising. The case was commenced after the commission received complaints stating that the agency hired students to attack competitors of Samsung Electronics in online forums. Samsung Taiwan made an announcement on its Facebook page in which it stated that it had not interfered with any evaluation report and had stopped online marketing campaigns that constituted posting or responding to content in online forums. Labor abuses Samsung was the subject of several complaints about child labor in its supply chain from 2012 to 2015. In July 2014, Samsung cut its contract with Shinyang Electronics after it received a complaint about the company violating child labor laws. Samsung says that its investigation turned up evidence of Shinyang using underage workers and that it severed relations immediately per its \\"zero tolerance\\" policy for child labor violations. One of Samsung's Chinese supplier factories, HEG, was criticized for using underage workers by China Labor Watch (CLW) in July 2014. HEG denied the charges and has sued China Labor Watch. CLW issued a statement in August 2014 claiming that HEG employed over ten children under the age of 16 at a factory in Huizhou, Guangdong. The group said the youngest child identified was 14 years old. Samsung said that it conducted an onsite investigation of the production line that included one-on-one interviews but found no evidence of child labor being used. CLW responded that HEG had already dismissed the workers described in its statement before Samsung's investigators arrived. CLW also claimed that HEG violated overtime rules for adult workers. CLW said a female college student was only paid her standard wage despite working four hours of overtime per day even though Chinese law requires overtime pay at 1.5 to 2.0 times standard wages. Price fixing On 19 October 2011, Samsung companies were fined ‚Ç¨145,727,000 for being part of a price cartel of ten companies for DRAMs which lasted from 1 July 1998 to 15 June 2002. The companies received, like most of the other members of the cartel, a 10-% reduction for acknowledging the facts to investigators. Samsung had to pay 90% of their share of the settlement, but Micron avoided payment as a result of having initially revealed the case to investigators. In Canada, during 1999, some DRAM microchip manufacturers conspired to price fix, among the accused included Samsung. The price fix was investigated in 2002. A recession started to occur that year, and the price fix ended; however, in 2014, the Canadian government reopened the case and investigated silently. Sufficient evidence was found and presented to Samsung and two other manufacturers during a class action lawsuit hearing. The companies agreed upon a $120 million agreement, with $40 million as a fine, and $80 Million to be paid back to Canadians who purchased a computer, printer, MP3 player, gaming console or camera from April 1999 to June 2002. Illegal sales of DRAM in the USA In 1987, United States International Trade Commission order that the Samsung Group of South Korea unlawfully sold computer chips in the United States without licenses from the chip inventor, Texas Instruments Inc. The order requires Samsung to pay a penalty to Texas Instruments within the coming weeks. Otherwise, sales of all dynamic random access memory chips made by Samsung and all products using the chips would be banned in the United States. The ban includes circuit boards and equipment called single-in-line packages made by other companies that use D-RAM's made by Samsung with 64,000 or 256,000 characters of memory. It also covers computers, facsimile machines and certain telecommunications equipment and printers bearing either of the Samsung chips.

He is considered to be one of the leading Turkish Cypriot poets of the period starting from the 1950s, and his work often exhibited a nationalistic line of thought.  Biography  Ya≈üƒ±n was born in 1932 in the Cypriot capital of Nicosia. His family had originated from the village of Peristerona. He received his primary and secondary education in Istanbul, in the 18th Primary School and the Vefa High School. His first poem in a newspaper was published in 1946, and the first one in a journal was published when he was 17 in journal Ye≈üilada. In 1950, he returned to Cyprus as a journalist. In 1952, his first poem in the renowned Turkish journal Varlƒ±k was published. Upon his return, he became a very prolific poet who brought \\"a different outlook\\" to Turkish Cypriot poetry. He published books called Bayraktar Destanƒ± (\\"the Epic of the Flag Bearer\\"), Kƒ±brƒ±s'tan Atat√ºrk'e (From Cyprus to Atat√ºrk), Namƒ±k Kemal Kƒ±brƒ±s'ta (\\"Namƒ±k Kemal in Cyprus\\") and Atat√ºrk'e Saygƒ± Duru≈üu (\\"Standing in Silence for Atat√ºrk\\"). In 1963, when the intercommunal violence called \\"Bloody Christmas\\" erupted, he joined the Turkish Cypriot armed struggle with Turkish Resistance Organization fighters and started working for the newly established Turkish Cyprus Bayrak radio. He wrote poems in the front line and read them on Bayrak, these poems were later compiled into two books, Kanlƒ± Kƒ±brƒ±s (\\"Bloody Cyprus\\"), telling the story of the events of 21‚Äì25 December 1963, and Oƒülum Sava≈ü'a Mektuplar (\\"Letters to War, My Son\\"), telling the story of the events of 25 December 1963 ‚Äì 7 March 1964. He was arrested by the Greek Cypriot police in the Nicosia International Airport due to the poems he read on the radio and was imprisoned for some time. He also wrote satire under the alias \\"Terzioƒülu\\". He was elected a member of the Turkish Cypriot Communal Assembly on 5 July 1970 from Nicosia and was one of the founding members of the Republican Turkish Party. He was a member of the Committee of Social Works of the Turkish Cypriot Administration. He continued politics and owned a shop in the 1980s, when he quit due to his deteriorating health and moved to a house that formerly belonged to his mother in Fatih, Istanbul with his wife. In 1964, he was displaced as a result of the intercommunal violence with his family and had to live in an overcrowded house. Between 1967 and 1973, he published the newspaper Sava≈ü. Ya≈üƒ±n married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce and he married his last wife, Nimet Ya≈üƒ±n, on 9 February 1983. He had five children, two of whom, Ne≈üe and Mehmet Ya≈üƒ±n, went on to become important poets in Turkish Cypriot literature. He spent his final working years writing his three-volume work, Nevzat ve Ben (\\"Nevzat and I\\"). He refused to use any other method for writing other than writing by hand. He suffered from various diseases including diabetes in his last years, and lost his vision two and a half years before his death. He died on 6 February 2011 and was buried in Nicosia. The decision to bury him Nicosia was made by his wife, with his daughter Ne≈üe, and was inspired by his line \\"One day, I will die and be buried in Cyprus, and daisies will grow on my grave\\".  Themes and influences  Thematically, his works have focused on Cyprus, however, he was also influenced by the city of Istanbul, where he spent his childhood. He was called \\"one of the most important poets in Turkish Cypriot literature in original pursuits\\", but his work exhibits influence from various Turkish authors, such as Orhan Veli Kanƒ±k, Nazƒ±m Hikmet, Cahit K√ºlebi, √úmit Ya≈üar Oƒüuzcan, Bedri Rahmi Eyuboƒülu and \\"arguably\\" Beh√ßet Kemal √áaƒülar.Turan, Metin. √áaƒüda≈ü Kƒ±brƒ±s T√ºrk ≈ûiirinde Eƒüilimler/ Y√∂nelimler (√áukurova University) Retrieved on 19 April 2015. Ya≈üƒ±n was part of the nationalist poetry movement at the time and wrote works depicting the intercommunal violence and the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. His ideological alignment always promoted peace instead of aggressive nationalism, however, when the Turkish Cypriots faced \\"aggressive attacks\\" after 1963, he became a symbolic advocate of national rights for Turkish Cypriots. However, he also reflected a change of focus from Turkey to Cyprus as the location of Turkish Cypriot identity. This can be seen in his words, \\"We Cypriots in the past were proud of our Turkishness and would say 'How happy is he who can call himself a Turk.' Now, however, we will feel pride both in being 'a Turk' and in being 'a Cypriot'. From now on we'll brag, 'How happy is he who can call himself a Turkish Cypriot'.\\" His nationalist line of thought combined his position as a Turkish Cypriot intellectual and the political environment of the 1960s and 70s. However, over time, his poetic approach turned to one that was increasingly imbued in \\"dispersion\\", according to Metin Turan.
