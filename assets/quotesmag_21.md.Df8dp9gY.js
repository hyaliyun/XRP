Because of the effect of terrain and obstacles, wireless signals propagate in multiple paths (the multipath effect). To minimize or use the multipath effect, engineers use channel sounding to process the multidimensional spatial-temporal signal and estimate channel characteristics. This helps simulate and design wireless systems. Motivation & applications Mobile radio communication performance is significantly affected by the radio propagation environment. Blocking by buildings and natural obstacles creates multiple paths between the transmitter and the receiver, with different time variances, phases and attenuations. In a single-input, single-output (SISO) system, multiple propagation paths can create problems for signal optimization. However, based on the development of multiple input, multiple output (MIMO) systems, it can enhance channel capacity and improve QoS. In order to evaluate effectiveness of these multiple antenna systems, a measurement of the radio environment is needed. Channel sounding is such a technique that can estimate the channel characteristics for the simulation and design of antenna arrays.Laurenson, D., & Grant, P. (2006, September). A review of radio channel sounding techniques. In Proc. EUSIPCO. Problem statement & basics MIMO sounding In a multipath system, the wireless channel is frequency dependent, time dependent, and position dependent. Therefore, the following parameters describe the channel: *Direction of departure (DOD) *Direction of arrival (DOA) *Time delay *Doppler shift *Complex polarimetric path weight matrix To characterize the propagation path between each transmitter element and each receiver element, engineers transmit a broadband multi-tone test signal. The transmitter's continuous periodic test sequence arrives at the receiver, and is correlated with the original sequence. This impulse-like auto correlation function is called channel impulse response (CIR).Thoma, R. S., Landmann, M., Sommerkorn, G., & Richter, A. (2004, May). Multidimensional high-resolution channel sounding in mobile radio. Proceedings of the 21st IEEE. In Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, 2004. IMTC 04. (Vol. 1, pp. 257-262). By obtaining the transfer function of CIR, we can make an estimation of the channel environment and improve the performance. Description of existing approaches=MIMO Vector Channel Sounder Based on multiple antennas at both transmitters and receivers, a MIMO vector channel sounder can effectively collect the propagation direction at both ends of the connection and significantly improve resolution of the multiple path parameters.Thom√§, R. S., Hampicke, D., Richter, A., Sommerkorn, G., & Trautwein, U. (2001). MIMO vector channel sounder measurement for smart antenna system evaluation. European Transactions on Telecommunications, 12(5), 427-438. =K-D model of wave propagation= Planar wave model Engineers model wave propagation as a finite sum of discrete, locally planar waves instead of a ray tracing model. This reduces computation and lowers requirements for optics knowledge. The waves are considered planar between the transmitters and the receivers. Two other important assumptions are: *Relative bandwidth is small enough so that the time delay can be simply transformed to a phase shift among the antennas. *The array aperture is small enough that there is no observable magnitude variation. Based on such assumptions, the basic signal model is described as: h(\\\\alpha,\\\\tau,\\\\psi_R,\\\\upsilon_R,\\\\psi_T,\\\\upsilon_T) = \\\\sum_{p=1}^P \\\\gamma_p\\\\delta(\\\\alpha-\\\\alpha_p)\\\\delta(\\\\tau-\\\\tau_p)\\\\cdot\\\\delta(\\\\psi_R-\\\\psi_{R_p})\\\\delta(\\\\upsilon_R-\\\\upsilon_{R_p})\\\\cdot\\\\delta(\\\\psi_T-\\\\psi_{T_p})\\\\delta(\\\\upsilon_T-\\\\upsilon_{T_p}) where \\\\tau_p is the TDOA (Time Difference of Arrival) of the wave-front p. \\\\psi_{R_p},\\\\upsilon_{R_p} are DOA at the receiver and \\\\psi_{T_p},\\\\upsilon_{T_p} are DOD at the transmitter,\\\\alpha_p is the Doppler shift. Real-Time Ultra-wideband MIMO Channel Sounding A higher bandwidth for channel measurement is a goal for future sounding devices. The new real- time UWB channel sounder can measure the channel in a larger bandwidth from near zero to 5 GHz. The real time UWB MIMO channel sounding is greatly improving accuracy of localization and detection, which facilitates precisely tracking mobile devices.Sangodoyin, S., Salmi, J., Niranjayan, S., & Molisch, A.

It replaced an abortive earlier municipality, the Corporate Town of Port Germein, which had been established on 15 September 1887 when residents, concerned about increased taxation and their interests being lost in a broader shire under the forthcoming reforms, decided to incorporate the town. The local residents reportedly regretted the decision, and when the Act passed late in the year creating the new District Council, state parliament agreed to amalgamate the Corporate Town into the new municipality. A section of the municipality separated on 16 February 1933, when it was merged with the District Council of Hammond and most of the District Council of Woolundunga as the recreated District Council of Wilmington.

From 1893 to 1895 he was chairman of the Massachusetts Republican state committee's finance committee. On January 3, 1895, Lyman was unanimously elected chairman of the Republican state committee. In 1896 he was elected to the Republican National Committee. Collector of customs On February 17, 1898, Lyman was nominated by President William McKinley for the position of collector of customs for the district of Boston. His nomination was confirmed by the United States Senate five days later. On March 4 he resigned from the Republican National Committee, as he did not want his duties as collector and committeeman to conflict with each other. He took office on April 1. Lyman's administration as collector was described by A. Maurice Low of The Boston Daily Globe as having been \\"managed in the interest of both the government and the merchants doing business with the customhouse, and that there has been practically no friction.\\" He was nominated for reappointment by President Theodore Roosevelt on January 8, 1902. In February 1902, The Boston Daily Globe reported that Massachusetts Governor Winthrop M. Crane and others suggested to President Roosevelt that Lyman would be an able successor to United States Secretary of the Navy John Davis Long. Roosevelt and Lyman were friends and Roosevelt respected Lyman's abilities as a business and his record as collector. U.S. Representative William Henry Moody was nominated instead. On October 17, 1903, United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Robert B. Armstrong commenced an investigation into frauds and irregularities at the Boston customhouse. Lyman was not blamed for the irregularities. On April 2, 1906, Lyman was sworn in for an unprecedented third term as collector. He was promised reappointment to a fourth term but chose to retire instead, citing \\"personal reasons\\". Later life and death In 1918, director of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety Henry Bradford Endicott appointed Lyman to chair a subcommittee of the Public Safety Committee to supervise groups that made public appeals for funds for patriotic purposes. The committee was formed to root out duplication of services, inefficiency, wastefulness, and dishonesty in patriotic societies. It was created soon after an organization known as \\"The Chain\\" began soliciting funds in Boston. The Chain's purported treasurer denied any involvement with organization's and Endicott believed its list of patrons was suspect as well. Lyman later wrote a book about the history of the Massachusetts Committee on Public Safety. In 1927, Lyman was appointed to Boston's Municipal Sinking Funds Commission by Mayor Malcolm Nichols. Lyman died on May 17, 1945 at his home on Commonwealth Avenue in Boston after a brief illness.

It was designed by David Ballinger Goodsir and Harold James Carlyle and built in 1953 by Llewellyn Herbert Edwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012.  History  Fallon House in Bundaberg, 1953 Fallon House, the Central District office of the Australian Workers Union (AWU), is situated in Maryborough Street, Bundaberg, on the corner of Quay Street. The building was designed by Brisbane architects DB Goodsir and HJ Carlyle, built by L Edwards, and opened in 1953. It is a low set brick modernist style structure comprising offices addressing Maryborough Street and a hall at the rear accessed from Quay Street. It was named in honour of former central branch secretary and state secretary of the AWU Clarence Edward Fallon. Between the years of 1918 and 1957, the Queensland Branch of the AWU was the largest branch of the largest union in Australia, with the Central District Office (Bundaberg) one of six offices of the union in Queensland. This period of domination of the union also coincides with the career of Clarrie Fallon, a temporary organiser in Bundaberg from 1921 who rose to the pinnacle of power in the union at a time when the Queensland Parliament ministerial team comprised mostly AWU members. The economy of Bundaberg, initially based on timber, quickly evolved into sugar production as foundation settlers selected land in 1867-68 under the \\"Sugar and Coffee Regulations\\" stemming from the Crown Lands Alienation Act of the 1860s which aimed to promote agriculture and closer settlement. The site of Bundaberg was officially surveyed in 1869. Coastal traffic grew, and copper was first mined at Mount Perry in 1871, which enabled Bundaberg to develop as a port and supply centre. Sugar plantations were established in the surrounding area and were to become the basis for the city's wealth as the industry boomed from the 1880s. Colonial Queensland workers formed loosely based organisations in an effort to improve working conditions. One such union was the Eight Hour Day movement, which was initiated in Queensland in 1858 by stonemasons working for John Petrie in Brisbane. The movement remained strong throughout Australia into the early 20th century. Most unions were small locally based organisations with no legal status. A Trades and Labour Council was established in Brisbane in 1885, followed by the Trade Union Act 1886 which legalised unions as organisations. Trade unions then took on a more permanent character as the Queensland economy consolidated and grew. Queensland workers recognised the value in a strong united union movement and formed the Australian Labour Federation (ALF), a combined industrial and political organisation. The ALF replaced the Trades and Labour Council in 1889. Its secretary, Albert Hinchcliffe a printer by trade, and journalist William Lane established The Worker newspaper in 1890 as the official newspaper of the union. The Australian Labour Party (ALP) formed at the first provincial council meeting of the ALF in August 1890. The Amalgamated Workers Union formed in Queensland in December 1891, from a merger of the Queensland Shearers Union and the Queensland Labourer's Union, during the 1891 Australian shearers' strike. Following the economic downturn and decline in unionism later in the 1890s, the Trades and Labour Council reformed in 1904. In 1905, three western branches of the Amalgamated Workers Union, in Longreach, Charleville and Hughenden, joined with the southern pastoral Australian Workers Union (AWU) to form a new union in Queensland. Its origins were in the Shearer's Union, which formed in Ballarat, Victoria in 1886. Registered through the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1905, this merger established a branch of the AWU in Queensland. Another new union, the Amalgamated Workers Association (AWA) was formed by miners on the Atherton Tableland in 1907. Membership comprised unskilled and semi-skilled workers. In 1908 the Bundaberg District Workers Union and the Mackay Sugar Workers Union became affiliated with the AWA. Union secretary Edward Granville (Ted) Theodore then embarked on a political career, entering parliament in 1909. In December 1910 union vice president William McCormack recruited the Amalgamated Sugar Workers Union into the AWA, and instigated a general sugar strike in 1911. The 1911 Queensland sugar strike occurred after the phasing out of South Sea Islander labour, with workers claiming that many plantation owners had substituted black slaves with white ones. Workers sought better accommodation, wages and conditions, including an eight-hour day and a minimum weekly wage of 30 shillings, including food. The mobilisation of unionists from Bundaberg to Mossman was a major achievement, with the 1911 strike lasting over seven weeks in Bundaberg where the town's economy was largely based on the sugar industry. The end result of the strike was a Commonwealth Royal Commission into the sugar industry in 1911-12, which had been initially requested by Harry Hall, a Bundaberg AWA organiser in 1908 with a petition signed by 1500 Bundaberg sugar workers. The Royal Commission, with ALF Secretary Albert Hinchcliffe as secretary, concluded the AWA demands had been justified. The union victory was a watershed in organised labour in Queensland and Australia. The success of the AWA's 1911 sugar strike, led the ALF (reformed from the TLC in 1910) to initiate the general strike of 1912, the first of its kind in Australia. The ALF called all 42 of its affiliated unions to support dismissed tramway workers in Brisbane. The strike was quashed by armed police on \\"Black Friday\\", 2 February 1912. McCormack, who had been chairman of the Townsville strike committee, could see that the failure was due to the inability of the ALF to co-ordinate statewide action and conciliatory negotiations. He was keen to re- align unions in Queensland. As a precursor to the formation of the Australia- wide Australian Workers Union, McCormack and Theodore attended the AWU national conference in Sydney in 1912, and sought out interstate amalgamations. This resulted in the merger of the AWA, of which Theodore was president, with the essentially southern based Australian Workers Union (AWU). Other unions which also joined forces at this time included the Rural Workers Union, the Carriers Union and the Rabbit Trappers Union. In Queensland the three AWU branches were consolidated into one and the state divided into six districts. The amalgamation was formalised on 1 July 1913. The AWA had held a virtual monopoly in North Queensland and the new organisation led to the national membership of the AWU reaching 62,000, 22,321 of whom were Queenslanders, making it the largest branch of the largest union in Australia at the time. This amalgamation spelt the end of the ALF. McCormack and Theodore were convinced that the AWU model of the amalgamation of smaller unions into One Big Union (OBU) was the way forward. EG Theodore was the first president of the Queensland branch of the AWU. The political affiliations of the AWA and subsequent AWU contributed to the election of the Labor government in Queensland in 1915, remaining in power for almost 40 years. Recognising the need for a formal meeting place for unionists, the Bundaberg Eight Hour Day committee approached the Lands Department in July 1919 for a site for a Trades Hall. At the time, union meetings were held outdoors on the corner opposite the School of Arts. An informal lease (No. 453) was drawn up by the Lands Department to the union trustees, for the northern half of the allotment on the western corner of Quay and Maryborough Streets, allowing a building to be erected on the site. In March 1922 the Eight Hour Day Anniversary Committee was granted a three-year lease on the property. The Bundaberg Trades and Labour Hall opened on the corner lot on 8 May 1922. An Eight Hour Day Parade was held followed by a sports gathering and dinner in the hall presided over by the president of the Bundaberg Trades and Labour Council. When the District Land Officer inspected the property in July 1923 he indicated that it comprised a five roomed timber building (the Trades Hall) and offices adjoining occupied by the Australian Workers Union built of wood with two large rooms. By January 1924 the Bundaberg Trades and Labour Council had purchased the Perpetual Town Lease No 6087, of the corner allotment and the improvements on it i.e. the Trades Hall and adjoining offices. The lease document was drawn up in November 1924. The Trades and Labour Council reformed in Brisbane in April 1922, coinciding with a renewed fervour for the establishment of One Big Union. A meeting in May at the Brisbane Trades Hall, addressed by the Queensland AWU Branch President AW Riordan, sought support for a union representing the whole of Australasia. The process had commenced in New South Wales, initiated by the miners' unions, which formed the Workers Industrial Union of Australia (WIUA) in 1918. At that time it did not have the support of the AWU, and since the WIUA was intent on dismantling the existing industrial and political system, this threatened the status quo of the AWU in Queensland which survived through its mutually beneficial relationship with the ALP and the sitting Labor government, making the OBU concept unpopular. Bundaberg was a starting point for many AWU officials, including Clarrie Fallon after whom the Bundaberg AWU building is named. He began his working life driving a parcel delivery van, and became a representative of the Australian Carrier's Union in the Gladstone district in his youth. Becoming a member of the Bundaberg and District Sugar Workers and General Labourer's Union around 1908, he then worked on the railways. Fallon's father had been a shearer, involved in the great strikes of the late 1880s and his mother was a shearer's cook, and both had strong interests in the labour movement. Fallon's AWU career began as a temporary organiser in Bundaberg in 1921, where he initiated some of the union's work for better conditions for sugar workers, and pioneered the union involvement with the cattle industry. Two years later he was appointed manager of the central district's Rockhampton office. By 1928 he was northern district secretary, based in Townsville. In 1933 he was elected state secretary of the AWU Queensland Branch, managing director of the Queensland Worker and chairman of directors of the Labor Daily Newspaper Co. Ltd. By February 1938 he was president of the Queensland central executive of the ALP and was elected federal ALP president in July that year. In 1940 he was elected general secretary of the AWU. He resigned from this role for health reasons in February 1943, and resigned the ALP federal presidency in 1944. The same year he was appointed to the University of Queensland Senate. By 1946 he was again the Queensland branch secretary, fighting for a 40-hour week for shearers in Queensland. AWU memberships were fairly evenly spread throughout the state in the 1920s, although a slightly larger membership existed in the Northern region, with the South West the smallest. For example, in 1924 the Northern Region had 5723, Central and Far Northern had over 5300, Southern 4728, Western 4493 and South Western had 3619. The AWU dominated the ALP in Queensland where between 1920 and 1950, four out of six labour premiers came from the AWU ranks: EG Theodore, William McCormack, Frank Cooper and William Forgan Smith. Membership of the ALP declined during the Depression years and the organisation came to rely on the AWU's organisational support. AWU membership in Queensland was 53 000 in 1936, compared with 6 600 in New South Wales. Labor lost power in 1929. Following its re-election in 1933, the partnership of Premier Forgan Smith and Secretary of the AWU Clarrie \\"the red terror\\" Fallon, emerged as one of the most powerful political teams in Queensland history. The ministry included nine officials of the AWU, while the brother of the only non-member, Ned Hanlon, was the editor of the Worker and a member of the Worker Board of Trustees. Even during the Depression years, the AWU continued to dominate in terms of trade union membership and by 1939 AWU membership had risen to 57,856, which was 50,000 more members than the nearest sized trade unions in Queensland. The growing strength of the union, led Central Branch Secretary Clarrie Fallon to write to the Minister for Lands in 1945 seeking to purchase part of the Bundaberg property of the Trades and Labour Council to establish an office for the AWU. A mutual agreement with the TLC initiated a resurvey of the corner allotments and removal of the old timber buildings. A new lease for the property (Lot 14) was drawn up in January 1947 under the names of the executive of the TLC, and then transferred to the AWU Branch Trustees, Clarence Edward Fallon, James William McCarter and John Alfred Moir on 21 March 1947. Clarrie Fallon died in January 1950 on the eve of an AWU convention in Sydney. The Bundaberg Office of the AWU was built when the union was at its peak in Australia. In 1950, a record state membership of the union of 66 353 was achieved. The AWU was largest union in Australia in 1950, with almost half of the national membership being in the Queensland branch. At its meeting of 9 May 1950, the central district committee moved to proceed with building a new district office in Bundaberg. Architects David B Goodsir and Harold J Carlyle were consulted to provide a design for the building in February 1951. Carlyle had won the student medal at the Central Technical College in 1933, and had been articled to R Ashley Shaw, who later took him into partnership. Carlyle and Goodsir were in partnership from 1946, sometimes still working with Shaw. The firm designed the new Innisfail hospital and the Maryborough Fire Station in 1949, Emmanuel College at the University of Queensland in 1950, the Queensland Spastic Welfare League building at New Farm in December 1953, and the Bureau of Sugar Experimentation on Gregory Terrace in 1958. The firm later evolved to become Goodsir, Baker and Wilde. The architects called tenders for the Bundaberg AWU building and the contract awarded to L Edwards in May 1952. Goodsir and Carlyle were part of a group of modernist architects producing functionalist designs often found in hospitals, schools, and offices in the 1950s. Governments and councils preferred this style, as its association with progress, innovation, efficiency and economy, made it an appealing choice in the post-depression era. Characteristics of the functionalist style in Australia include asymmetrical massing, simple geometric shapes, clean lines, steel framed corner and strip windows, undecorated brick walls, curved external corners, flat cantilevered concrete awnings and low pitched or flat roofs concealed behind parapets. Buildings constructed in Bundaberg at this time include: extensions to the hospital and a new state high school at Kepnock in 1964, a new fire station (1950), the Canegrowers Building (1957), the 1957 4BU Radio Station a new courthouse in 1958 and the Civic Centre built in 1960. The Bundaberg News Mail reported in December 1952 that the AWU building was under construction and was the largest non-government building project in Bundaberg at the time. When completed it was to be named Fallon House. According to the newspaper, the city had experienced a ten percent growth in the construction of industrial and commercial buildings during the 1952 calendar year, including fourteen new factories, a foundry, a number of auto maintenance businesses and eighteen new shops. The sugar industry remained the biggest employer in the district with almost half engaged in sugar growing and manufacture. The building appears to have been completed by April 1953, as the new structure was inspected by Branch President J Bukowski and Branch Secretary Harold Boland at this time. The completion of the building was a landmark for the union, which now owned all of its offices. These included Longreach (1922), Mackay (1926), Townsville (1936), Cairns (1938), Charleville and Ayr, both completed in 1940. Fallon House honoured the memory of Clarrie Fallon, whose death, according to the Worker newspaper, 'was a loss to the Australian Worker's Union, the Labor Party and indeed the Commonwealth of Australia'. At the time of construction of Fallon House, the AWU represented workers from a range of industries including cane cutters and sugar mills, Golding's sawmill in Gladstone, railway labour gangs employed on a project basis, Gladstone City Council and other local government employees, Carrick's Sawmill Rockhampton, Bundaberg foundry, Gladstone Butter Factory, Bundaberg Distillery, Mt Morgan mines, the Peanut Board in Rockhampton, Walkers Ltd in Maryborough, Biloela Butter Factory, Gladstone Harbour Board, Maryborough Hospital and other local hospitals. The inclusion of a garage in the design of the new offices is evidence of the necessity for union representatives to travel. For example, District Secretary Gerry Goding travelled to Monto, Eidsvold, Cracow, Theodore, Biloela and Mount Perry in early November 1954. Fallon House provided a reception area staffed by union organisers where members to pay their fees and acquired union tickets, office space for union administrative staff, including a district secretary's office, bookkeeper's office, a kitchen and strong room within the main building, while the hall at the rear, served as a trades' hall where stop work meetings were held. The ALP also convened meetings here. The hall featured a stage and dressing rooms, and a small kitchen area, demonstrating the intent to derive income from its rental. The provision of a hall for public use was common in this type of building, and other AWU buildings in Townsville, Mackay, Ayr and Charleville included hall or dance halls, as did the Toowoomba Trades Hall, (Toowoomba Trades Hall) and other trades halls like Rockhampton, Brisbane and Ipswich. The local council used Fallon House Hall as an immunisation clinic during the week and in the late 60s, dances were held on weekends, as were other functions such as wedding receptions. In most recent years the hall has been used by a local dance school for lessons, performances and examinations. The property remained leased until the early 1970s when the land was converted to freehold. A Deed of Grant for the land was issued to the Trustees of the Australian Workers Union of Employees Queensland on 22 November 1972. The fortunes of the AWU ebbed and flowed in the subsequent years. The ten-month-long shearer's strike of 1956 was ended by a declaration of a State of Emergency by Labor Premier Vince Gair. While the proposed cuts to shearing rates were restored and the strike was generally seen as a victory for shearers, it was followed by a breakdown in the relationship between the AWU and the ALP, the expulsion of Gair from the ALP in April 1957 and his formation of the Queensland Labor Party. It later formed a coalition with the Democratic Labor Party (DLP). Ted Walsh became the deputy leader of the QLP following the split, but by 1960 ran as an independent. His strong personal local following saw him retain his Bundaberg seat until his retirement in 1969. At the same time the management of the Central Branch of the AWU in Bundaberg rested with district secretary Gerry Goding from 1942, who is credited in healing the rift between the ALP and the AWU in later years. Goding guided the union membership through the transition from a labour-intensive agrarian economy to an increasingly diverse one, particularly after increased mechanisation in the sugar industry, and the merger of mill operations. New ventures evolved, including the production of sugar harvesting and other agricultural machinery, which led to a decline in AWU memberships as the role of canecutters diminished. However, there has been a growth in employment by local government undertaking sewerage and water supply schemes. Workers employed in these industries, and those employed in hospitals, water supply and forestry were members of the AWU. The union was involved in a number of major industrial issues during the 1960s including the Mt Isa mines disputes of 1961 and 1964 and the 1967 Collinsville power station construction dispute, in which the AWU recruited the contractors employed as strike breakers. The Mt Isa and Collinsville disputes continued the union's somewhat controversial reputation at that time. The AWU continued to represent a range of occupations through the 1980s, becoming involved in disputes related to environmental issues, particularly in its support of workers employed in ventures such as forestry and sand mining on Fraser Island, uranium mining, and logging in the rainforests around Cairns. It also supported the construction of the Gordon below Franklin Dam in Tasmania in the early 1980s, which did not proceed following the election of the Hawke Labor Government in 1983. In 1993 the AWU merged with the Federation of Industrial Manufacturing and Engineering Employees (FIME) giving it greater membership in the mining industry, supporting jobs growth despite environmental concerns. During 2009 the sugar industry again dominated the union's activities in Bundaberg, with members shut out of the Bingera and Millaquin mills after striking to protect leave entitlements. In 2011, a former National Party, now independent politician called on the AWU to fight the closure of the Babinda Sugar Mill, owned by a joint venture of foreign owned Bundaberg Sugar and Maryborough Sugar Factory. The union celebrated the 125th anniversary of its inauguration in Ballarat in 1886 with a national conference on the Gold Coast in February 2011, and in 2013 celebrated the centenary of the formal amalgamation of smaller unions into the AWU in July 1913. Fallon House continues to operate as the Central District office of the union.  Description  Fallon House is a small brick building accommodating a hall and offices on a corner lot in a central location in Bundaberg. The building fronts onto Maryborough Street to the east providing access to the offices and the garage. It has a secondary access on the north from Quay Street which provides access to the hall behind. The building sits on the eastern half of a rectangular allotment with a grassed yard occupying the remainder of the site. The building is one-storey cavity brick with pale orange face brick sheltered by a terracotta tiled roof (hipped over the offices and gabled over the hall). It is designed in a functionalist style with a cubic form with horizontal continuous cantilevered concrete window hoods, and minimal decoration. The Maryborough Street elevation is asymmetrical around a projecting central entrance bay. The entrance is reached by a short flight of concrete stairs and sheltered by a cantilevered concrete awning. The exterior walls have short parapets topped with cement rendered coping. A large flagpole is above the entrance bay and a band of decorative brickwork runs below the coping. Attached to the face and awnings of the building are large letters FALLON HOUSE, A.W.U., and AUSTRALIAN WORKERS UNION. The front door is a modern aluminium-framed glazed double leaf and is not of cultural heritage significance. The Quay Street entry to the hall is sheltered by a concrete awning over a short flight of concrete steps. Generally, the windows of the offices are timber framed double hung sashes. The bottom sashes contain obscure rippled glass and the windows on the north and east are shielded by fixed aluminium blades. The windows of the hall are large banks of steel- framed, awning windows with horizontally-ribbed glazing. The building has metal rainwater downpipes surface mounted to the face of the building with large, prominent rainheads. The garage is separated from the main building by a narrow concrete floored alley. Attached to the rear of the garage is a ladies toilet. Behind this is a concreted area and further back is a detached gents toilet block with a skillion roof. The toilets and garage are the same face brick as the main building. The office consists of a small entry foyer with reception desk, three offices, a kitchen, and a strong room. Rooms have vinyl tile floors, sheet wall linings with timber skirtings, picture rails and architraves, and the ceiling is fibrous plaster sheets with moulded plaster cornices. The strong room has a concrete floor and rendered concrete walls and ceiling. The rooms retain original built-in cupboards with original hardware, some original light fixtures and light switching plates, and the strong room retains original locks and timber shelving. Internal doors are timber with original hardware. Some windows have internal wind deflecting glass shields at sill level and some partitions have ribbed glass windows at a high level. The foyer retains the original timber veneer reception desk in front of a timber veneer partition with ribbed glazing. The kitchen retains original joinery including cabinet handles, sink and tapware, benchtop, and green splashback tiles. The hall is accessed from both Quay Street and the rear of the office via a small foyer with double silky oak doors that open into the large hall. The hall floor is timber and the walls are sheeted and have a timber skirting. Acoustic sheets are attached at a high-level of the back wall. The coved ceiling consists of a grid of large, square sheets with timber cover strips, hanging fluorescent lights, and a long central feature panel ventilation grille. At the western end of the hall is a raised stage with proscenium accessed by stairs at either side. The stage is flanked by a small room either side; one contains a kitchen with original joinery, benchtop, sink, tapware, and tiled splashback, the other is a small backstage room with a set of timber stairs and provides access to the stage wing. The doors in the hall are clear- finished silky oak and the paint scheme throughout the hall appears to be original. Doors at the western end open out onto a short flight of concrete stairs into the concreted yard. The toilet blocks have polished concrete floors, fibrous plaster sheet walls and ceilings, with timber coverstrips and cornices. The rooms have square timber framed windows of obscure glass louvres. The cubicle partitions are terrazzo and the walls are lined with green square ceramic tiles. The toilet blocks retain original fixtures and fittings including toilets, urinal, basins, and light fittings.  Heritage listing  Fallon House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 December 2012 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Fallon House in Bundaberg (1953), as the Central District Office of the Australian Workers' Union (AWU), is a product of the growth of the union in Queensland in the first half of the 20th century. It is important in demonstrating the evolution of workers' history in Queensland and the influential contribution that the union movement has made to the development of the state. The construction of a purpose built AWU office and hall in 1953 occurred at a time when the union was at its peak, with the Queensland Branch having been the largest branch of Australia's largest trade union for 40 years. The site is associated with significant early union activity to improve workers' conditions in Bundaberg and Central Queensland, including the Eight Hour Day movement and the AWU from 1923. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. Fallon House demonstrates the principal characteristics of a purpose-built district union office, which has continually served members since its construction in 1953. The internal layout of the building illustrates its function, with office spaces for union organisers, administrative staff and district secretary. The attached hall functioned as an Australian Worker's Union and Australian Labor Party meeting place and a venue for local community activities. Its highly intact modernist style reflects the dynamism of Bundaberg in the post-war era when a range of similarly styled functionalist public buildings were erected to symbolise progress, innovation and optimism for the future. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Fallon House exhibits aesthetic characteristics of a well composed modernist building, highly intact both internally and externally, contributing to the streetscape of Quay Street Bundaberg. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Fallon House in Bundaberg has a strong association with the membership of the Australian Workers Union (AWU), an organisation that has played in important role in the union movement in Queensland. From the inauguration of the AWU in July 1913, until 1957, the Queensland Branch was the largest branch of Australia's largest union. Constructed at the time the union was at its peak in Queensland, the place demonstrates the work of the AWU in providing a purpose-built district office to serve their members. In continuous use since 1953 as the AWU's Central District Office, the building was named in honour of Clarrie Fallon, Bundaberg organiser from 1921, who became state secretary of the union by 1933, and was vice-president of the executive of both the ALP and the AWU by 1950.

It hosts an annual writers conference, six one-day conferences, and webinars, administers an annual literary competition, publishes an annual collection of selected short fiction, a bi-monthly magazine, and E-newsletter, and maintains a website, online store, and members-only online forum. It is an all-volunteer organization.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; Peppertree Press; 2011https://floridawriters.net It describes its purpose as \\"Writers Helping Writers\\". In 2015, FWA consisted of well over 1300 members across 47 Florida counties, 32 other states, the UK, and Canada. Fifty-seven associated writer's and critique groups in Florida and Nevada were headed up by sixty-five Group Leaders under the supervision of ten Regional Directors. The Board of Directors was made up of a President, Executive Vice President, Vice President of Administration and Membership, Vice President of Finance, a Director Emerita, and ten Board Members.https://floridawriters.net Founding and Early Years Florida Writers Association was incorporated and designated a 501(c)(6) organization on May 14, 2001 by founder Glenda Ivey. Other founding members: Vicki M. Taylor and Weslynn McAllister were instrumental in the formation of the only (at the time) Florida non-profit \\"dedicated to helping writers of all genres, published or not.\\" Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; pg. 19; Peppertree Press; 2011 Glenda Ivey served as the first President, with Vicki M. Taylor as Vice-President and Rachel Lisi as Secretary-Treasurer. Writers Helping Writers began with the task of supporting local writers in their communities improve their writing, learn about publishing, and begin promoting their work. To this end, it was decided to appoint Regional Directors (who would also serve Board Members) to grow local groups. Vicki M. Taylor, Caryn Suarez, and Doug Dillon established one or more 'Palm Groups' to meet once a month in the areas of Tampa, Jacksonville, and Orlando respectively. The meetings were led by appointed Group Leaders and included workshops, panel discussions, writing critiques, screenwriting, and poetry. The groups also worked together to hold book fairs and book signings in different locations. Contact with the growing membership that first year was through a twenty-page newsletter called Florida Palm Magazine mailed to members' homes. On its one-year anniversary in May 2002, FWA had 129 members, ten Regional Directors, and eight Palm Groups in Jacksonville, Tampa, Orlando, Lake Wales, St. Petersburg, New Port Richey, and Saint Augustine.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; pg. 19-22; Peppertree Press; 2011 Early Group Leaders - Freda Gower Ward and Sheila McNaughton, St. Petersburg Palm Group - Chuck Dowling, Orlando?-Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; Peppertree Press; 2011 Growing Pains Following an unexpected move out of state for Glenda Ivey, Vicki M. Taylor stepped into the President's role in 2002. Regional Director Doug Dillon became Vice-President. FWA's first official election for the positions of President, Vice-President, Secretary, and Treasurer as chosen by the membership took place in 2003. Vicki M. Taylor voluntarily stepped down and Curie Nova became FWA's first elected President. As FWA became larger, the earlier informal structure became a hindrance to the business of the organization. The President's role encompassed a wide breadth of responsibilities and a succession of Presidents found the time requirement too much to bear.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; pg. 25-26; Peppertree Press; 2011 In 2004, Vice-President Dan Griffith took over the position from Caryn Suarez and appointed new board member Chrissy Jackson as his Vice-President. Both had strong business backgrounds. Anticipating their election by membership at the 2004 conference for 2005, they strategized Griffith's plan to shift FWA's operations into a stable, business model that would carry it forward into the future and tapped Shara Smock as Secretary and Lisa Coleman for Treasurer. But controversy marred the elections after Former President Caryn Suarez arranged the showing of a special film at the 2004 RPLA banquet, held during the conference. The film's racial and religious content offended some members. In the fallout Suarez swung her support from acting President Dan Griffith to Port St. Lucie Group Leader Acashya Dolfin. Only 165 of 2004's 450 FWA members were in attendance at the conference and 40 members chose to vote. Dolphin became President, with Jackson as Vice-President. Disagreements led to Jackson's resignation. Robert Mykle became Vice- President. Soon, Dolfin also resigned and Mykle became President, with the knowledge that his international business commitments would not allow him to serve out the full term. The Board of Directors asked Dan Griffith if he were still willing to serve. Mykle named Griffith as his Vice-President and then resigned, allowing Griffith to take over the role of President. Griffith appointed Jackson as Vice-President and Smock and Coleman returned as Secretary and Treasurer. The previously conceived Officers and business plan now in place, this group stabilized FWA's early structure and allowed its continued growth.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck;Pg.27-28 Peppertree Press; 2011 New Era As membership grew, FWA transitioned into the modern age. The \\"Palm Groups\\" became \\"Writers Groups\\", which diversified into two types, those that invite speakers in and hold educational seminars on various subjects related to writing and publishing, and those that function primarily as critique groups, with writers submitting work on which they receive feedback and evaluation from the group's members. Some of the groups allow unlimited local members, others form sub-groups of limited numbers. Regional Directors continue to encourage the creed of 'Writers Helping Writers' by encouraging groups to meet the needs of writers in their locations, whether that means forming new groups or holding mini-conferences or bringing in speakers. \\"Florida Palm Magazine\\", a twenty-page mailer, became a 'slick' publication called \\"The Florida Writer\\", which then morphed into bi- monthly PDF downloads by email to all members, supplemented by a briefer E-newsletter. The website grew up and a blog was added, soon followed by formation of the FWA Network, a members-only online forum. The State conference committee is refreshed with new turnover every couple of years and new faculty applications are encouraged. The RPLA committee, which has seen a jump in entries every year since inception, re-evaluates the competition rules and anonymous judges every year and modifies rules and procedures as needed. A Youth RPLA was established to complement a program for middle and high schoolers called FWA Youth (FWAY). FWAY offers young writers a one-day state conference, local youth groups, and an online critique group. The broadcasting of webinars is FWA's newest outreach project.https://floridawriters.net Florida Writers Foundation The Florida Writers Foundation (FWF), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, is a sister organization to the Florida Writers Association and was formed to promote literacy in the state of Florida. FWF volunteers have made a difference by visiting elementary schools for reading days, sponsoring poetry contests, donating books to under-privileged schools, and contributing funds to middle school writing contests. The Florida Writers Association helps the Foundation raise funds by hosting a silent auction during its annual Florida Writers Conference, and every year, another fundraiser, the Florida Writers Foundation Celebrity Workshop, takes place right before the conference.http://www.floridawritersfoundation.net Florida Writers Conference Annual Florida Writers Conference - The first FWA conference was held in mid-October, 2002 at the Orlando Hilton Inn. The Regional Directors promoted the conference and recruited writers for panels and break out sessions. President Glenda Ivey convinced John Boles, a writer and television producer/director to appear as the keynote speaker. She and Doug Dillion also talked Robert Peck, a YA novelist to present a workshop.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; pg. 23; Peppertree Press; 2011 From 2002 to 2015, all presenters, speakers, and panelists are unpaid volunteers, although the conference does sometimes arrange travel and lodging fees. 179 of FWA's 182 members in October 2002 attended, along with spouses and companions.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; Peppertree Press; 2011https://floridawriters.net/conferences/florida-writers-conference/ Successive Years 2003 saw the formation of a Conference Committee to take the brunt of promotion and recruitment of faculty off the Regional Directors. Although a few members were asked to run workshops, a decision was made to recruit professionals in the form of published writers, agents, editors, and publishers. The keynote speaker was novelist Tim Dorsey, and Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publisher's Weekly served as closing speaker. Agents Linda Mead and Lori Perkins headed a panel on approaching agents and the acquisitions editor of Writer's Digest Books, Jane Friedman, presented a workshop on writing non-fiction book proposals.Florida Writers Association- Writing Our History~One Writer At A Time: First Ten Years 2001 to 2011; Edited by Douglas Houck; Pg. 26; Peppertree Press; 2011 That crucial 2003 decision has resonated through to 2015. All faculty is invited to present or selected after a vigorous application and approval process. All conference faculty are unpaid volunteers. FWA does sometimes pay travel and lodging fees for out-of area presenters. The current four-day conference format offers panels, workshops, break-out sessions, meals with genre groups, pitch sessions with agents, editors, and publishers, critiques and pitch practice, signings, networking, a store, the Royal Palm Literary Awards banquet, a parallel young writers track, and a silent auction benefiting the Florida Writers Foundation (FWF), which promotes literacy. The FWF also benefits from the proceeds of a limited entry day-long single-topic workshop during the conference. Best- selling writers of renown are invited to give the keynote address and choose ten stories to highlight from among all the winning selections of the annual members anthology contest.https://floridawriters.net/conferences/florida- writers-conference/ 2015 Board of Directors Royal Palm Literary Awards Competition The Royal Palm Literary Awards (RPLA) competition was also introduced in 2002 and fifty members earned awards at the FWA conference's Saturday evening RPLA ceremony.

Multiple, anonymous judges use judging rubrics to score and provide feedback on each entry. If a set score is reached, that entry becomes a semi-finalist. Semi-finalist entries move on to a final judge. If the score from that final judge reaches a second set point, the entry becomes a Finalist and is eligible to win an award. Only the top three scores in each category are awarded as First, Second, and Third place for that category. Since entries MUST score a set number of points in order to be eligible for an award, each year, there are RPLA categories in which no entry or limited entries are awarded. The RPLA committee, which has seen a jump in entries every year since inception, re- evaluates the competition rules and anonymous judges every year and modifies rules and procedures as needed. In 2015, all entrants were required to hold an FWA membership, but that has not always been the case.https://floridawriters.net/competitions-awards/royal-palm-literary-award/ RPLA Winners Lists, 2008-2019 RPLA Winners Lists, 2008-2019 References Film organizations in the United States Television organizations in the United States ","title":"Florida Writers Association"},{"id":"48540110","text":"Tingler may refer to: * Tingler (surname), multiple people * Jayce Tingler, baseball manager for the San Diego Padres * The Tingler (film), a 1959 horror film starring Vincent Price * Tingler (fictional character), a character from the stop motion film The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1985 film) * \\"The Tingler\\", a 1991 song by the Future Sound of London from the Pulse 3 EP * \\"The Tingler\\", a 1991 song by Severed Heads from the album Cuisine (With Piscatorial) * \\"The Tingler\\", a 2003 song by Blondie from the album The Curse of Blondie * Project Tingler, a dating sim by Zoe Quinn and Chuck Tingle See also * Tingling * Tingly Tingle (disambiguation) ","title":"Tingler"},{"id":"48540123","text":"Ma Hae-young (; born August 14, 1970) is a retired South Korean professional baseball infielder who played for 14 seasons in the KBO League.

Its walls self-healed after release of pressure. Boron nitride nanotubes (BNNTs) are a polymorph of boron nitride. They were predicted in 1994 and experimentally discovered in 1995. Structurally they are similar to carbon nanotubes, which are cylinders with sub-micrometer diameters and micrometer lengths, except that carbon atoms are alternately substituted by nitrogen and boron atoms. However, the properties of BN nanotubes are very different: whereas carbon nanotubes can be metallic or semiconducting depending on the rolling direction and radius, a BN nanotube is an electrical insulator with a bandgap of ~5.5 eV, basically independent of tube chirality and morphology. In addition, a layered BN structure is much more thermally and chemically stable than a graphitic carbon structure. BNNTs have unique physical and chemical properties, when compared to Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) providing a very wide range of commercial and scientific applications. Although BNNTs and CNTs share similar tensile strength properties of circa 100 times stronger than steel and 50 times stronger than industrial-grade carbon fibre, BNNTs can withstand high temperatures of up to 900 ¬∞C. as opposed to CNTs which remain stable up to temperatures of 400 ¬∞C, BNNTs also absorb Radiation and they may well help in NASA's quest to go to Mars by 2030 for their Space Radiation Shielding qualities BNNTS are packed with physicochemical features including high hydrophobicity and considerable hydrogen storage capacity and they are being investigated for possible medical and biomedical applications, including gene delivery, drug delivery, neutron capture therapy, and more generally as biomaterials BNNTs are also superior to CNTs in they way they bond to polymers giving rise to many new applications and composite materials Synthesis & Production RF induction thermal plasma system used for mass production of BNNTs. Pure h-BN powder is continuously transformed into BNNTs by passing through a high-temperature N2-H2 plasma (~8000 K). (b) Calculated temperature distribution inside the reactor. (c) Calculated velocity distribution (left) and streamlines (right). Meters-long BN buckypaper sheets can be fabricated by adding a cylindrical drum to the above reactor. All well-established techniques of carbon nanotube growth, such as arc- discharge, laser ablation and chemical vapor deposition, are used for mass- production of BN nanotubes at a tens of grams scale. BN nanotubes can also be produced by ball milling of amorphous boron, mixed with a catalyst (iron powder), under NH3 atmosphere. Subsequent annealing at ~1100 ¬∞C in nitrogen flow transforms most of the product into BN. A high-temperature high-pressure method is also suitable for BN nanotube synthesis. BNNT production route has been a significant issue due to low yield and poor quality in comparison with CNT, thus limiting its practical uses. However, many great successes in BNNT synthesis have been achieved in recent years, enabling access to this material and paving the way for the development of promising applications Recently significant advancement have been made by Deakin University Australia with a ‚Äònovel and scalable‚Äô manufacturing process will allow the production of BNNTs in large quantities for the first time since the material was first discovered two decades ago. Australian listed ASX entity PPK Group (ASX:PPK) signed a joint venture agreement with Deakin in November 2018 to form BNNT Technology Limited, with the goal of manufacturing boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT) on a commercial basis. This collaboration is supported with investment by the Australian Government into BNNT Technology Limited and may significantly increase the world supply of BNNT unlocking a new array of applications, materials, composites and technologies. Properties and potential applications BN nanotube buckypaper is flame resistant, as shown in this comparative flame test of airplanes made of cellullose, carbon buckypaper and BN nanotube buckypaper. Electrical and field emission properties of BN nanotubes can be tuned by doping with gold atoms via sputtering of gold on the nanotubes. Doping rare-earth atoms of europium turns a BN nanotube into a phosphor material emitting visible light under electron excitation. Quantum dots formed from 3 nm gold particles spaced across the nanotubes exhibit the properties of field-effect transistors at room temperature. Like BN fibers, boron nitride nanotubes show promise for aerospace applications where integration of boron and in particular the light isotope of boron (10B) into structural materials improves both their strength and their radiation- shielding properties; the improvement is due to strong neutron absorption by 10B. Such 10BN materials are of particular theoretical value as composite structural materials in future manned interplanetary spacecraft, where absorption-shielding from cosmic ray spallation neutrons is expected to be a particular asset in light construction materials. Toxicological investigations on BNNTs conducted in the 2010s seem to show that the enhanced chemical inertia of BN nanotubes favors biocompatibility. As a result, their use in the biomedical field was suggested both as nanocarriers and as nanotransducers. BN nanotubes have also shown potential in certain cancer treatments. High stiffness and excellent chemical stability makes BNNTs ideal material for reinforcement in polymers, ceramics and metals. For instance, buckypaper-based BNNT/epoxy composites and polyurethane-modified buckypaper composites have been successfully developed.1,16 These composite materials exhibit Young‚Äôs moduli over twice the value for neat epoxy and 20 times the value for unimpregnated buckypaper. BNNTs are also one of the most promising classes of material for reinforcing aluminum-based structures.17 The low reactivity of BNNTs facilitates the integration of this material into an aluminum matrix where CNTs fail due to the reaction between the carbon and the aluminum which forms the undesired Al4C3 phase at the interface. BNNTs also exhibit much higher oxidation temperature (~950 ¬∞C) than the melting point of aluminum (660 ¬∞C), which enables the homogenous dispersion of BNNTs directly into the aluminum melt. Since BNNTs retain their mechanical properties at high temperatures while having a very low density, the development of new temperature-resistant lightweight MMC is achievable. BNNTs also exhibit good thermal conductivity. This renders them useful for applications in nanoelectronics where heat dissipation is critical. This also makes BNNTs multifunctional as it not only improves the stiffness of composites but also yields high thermal conductivity along with high transparency. The combination of high stiffness and high transparency is already exploited in the development of BNNT-reinforced glass composites.18 Other intrinsic properties of BNNTs such as good radiation shielding ability,19 high electrical resistance and excellent piezoelectric properties are likely to promote interest for integrating them in new applications.

W.H. Bryan is in the second row, fourth from the left. Used with the permission of Fryer Library, University of Queensland Photograph Collection, UQFL466, AL/P/66 Walter Heywood (W.H.) Bryan (1891‚Äì1966) was an Australian geologist, educator and decorated military veteran. He founded the University of Queensland Seismology Station, and was the first student at the University of Queensland to receive a Doctor of Science (D.Sc.) degree. He served with distinction during World War I. Early life Bryan was born in Taringa, Brisbane in 1891. He was educated at Ipswich Grammar School. After high school he enrolled in the newly formed University of Queensland in 1911 and graduated with a BSc in 1914. He would take his Honours in Geology and Mineralogy, studying the petrology of Enoggera granite. He spent a short time in the Queensland Geological Survey in 1914‚Äì15 mapping the Maryborough basin and the petrology of the Gympie Permian. He was awarded his MSc from the University of Queensland while he was overseas serving in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF).  Military service  Bryan enlisted in the AIF in 1915 and served as a gunner at Gallipoli and in France. He served at Gallipoli, in Egypt and on the Western Front, with 1 Division Trench Mortar Batteries and Artillery. He was awarded the Military Cross for conspicuous heroism under fire. He would be the Vice-Chairman of the University of Queensland's War Memorial Committee following WW1. Marriage  In 1919 following WW1, he married fellow Australian, Myee Harrison, in London.  Career  Bryan undertook postgraduate study at the University of Cambridge for a year in 1919. He returned to Australia and was appointed a lecturer at the University of Queensland in geology in 1921. He gave many public lectures in Brisbane on geological topics, including the origins of the earth, coral reefs and prehistoric man. His geological interests were strongest in the origin of and the relationship between continents and oceans. He was President of the Royal Society of Queensland in 1925. In 1926, he received his D.Sc., the first student of the University of Queensland to do so. His D.Sc. thesis would be on earth movements in Queensland. When Professor Henry Caselli Richards was on study leave to the U.S. in the mid 1930s, Bryan acted as Professor in his stead, answering questions related to earthquakes in particular. Bryan and Richards would have a productive working relationship, co-publishing a number of publications on the Silverwood-Lucky Valley area and on the Brisbane Tuff. Following the 1935 earthquake in Gayndah, Queensland, a seismological station was set up at the University of Queensland. Earthquakes in Queensland being rare and this one being of significant strength to be felt at a great distance, Bryan's enthusiasm for establishing a means of researching seismic activity in Queensland, inspired willing benefactors to get involved. Two Milne-Shaw seismographs were donated to the University in quick succession. These were followed by other seismographs, enabling greater study of seismic activity in Queensland and overseas. Bryan would become the Officer in Charge of the UQ Seismology Station for many years. His enthusiasm for this research, commitment to the station and the results it collected, represent the second longest running experiment at the University of Queensland to date ‚Äì after the Pitch drop experiment initiated by Thomas Parnell. Bryan and his colleague, Owen A. Jones later argued for further stations to be added to the north of Queensland to assist with accurate weather forecasting of cyclone events, earthquakes and sea disturbances. He and Dorothy Hill would work on new hypotheses to explain the growth of corals in the 1940s. Bryan was the W.B. Clarke Memorial Lecturer of the Royal Society of New South Wales in 1944. He was president of the Geological section of ANZAAS in 1946 and foundation member and first Chairman of the Queensland division of the Geological Society of Australia. He was a representative of the University Senate on the Soldiers' Children Education Board following WW2. He was Deputy Chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Committee for many years, Editor of the Royal Society of Queensland's journal and Patron of the Gemological Association of Queensland. In 1937 he was President of the Queensland Naturalists Club, and for some years the President of the Men's Graduate Association. In 1945, he was president of the Royal Society of Queensland. After the death of Professor Henry Richards, Bryan would become the second Professor of the Department of Geology in 1948. Bryan was well liked in his department and proved to be a skilled lecturer, mentor and administrator on behalf of the Geology Department. He would publish almost 60 papers during his career. He would retire from the University in 1959 and become Emeritus Professor in his retirement. He was still writing papers on spherulites at his death and reviewing the work of others.  Later life  Bryan died in 1966. He was survived by his wife and four children. All of their children would graduate from the University of Queensland. His son Bill Bryan would work in forestry, son Harrison Bryan would become the head of the University of Queensland Library, daughter Margaret Bryan would go into \\"letters\\" and son Bob Bryan into geology as his father had done.  Legacy  The UQ Seismology Station that he started, continues to this day at Mount Nebo. In 1991, the University of Queensland W.H. Bryan Mining and Geology Research Centre was established and named for him. It is part of the Sustainable Minerals Institute of which his son Bob was a founding director.  Papers  * Bryan, W. H.

His father was a fencing master in Dublin David Garrick brought O'Brien over to London from Dublin in 1758 to join his actor's company at Drury Lane. O'Brien was successful in a number of roles, particularly Shakespeare and contemporary comedies.

Following the marriage, O'Brien retired from the stage. The couple were forced for a time to travel to North America, because of the social scandal caused by their elopement. They set sail for New York in September 1764. Although neither husband nor wife were happy there, they travelled widely, sailing up the Hudson, travelling west to Niagara Falls, and then north to Quebec where O'Brien briefly served as a barrack master. In 1768, he was gazetted Secretary and Provost-Master-General of the Bermudas. On their return to England in 1770, the O'Briens lived for a time in London where O'Brien entered a brief but unsuccessful career as a playwright. He was the author of two plays, Cross-Purposes (1772) and The Duel (1773).

The technique itself has various applications, including mapping ocean floors, determining the structure of sediments, mapping subsurface currents and hydrocarbon exploration. Since geophysical data obtained in such techniques is a function of both space and time, multidimensional signal processing techniques may be better suited for processing such data.  Data acquisition  Offset VSP There are a number of data acquisition techniques used to generate seismic profiles, all of which involve measuring acoustic waves by means of a source and receivers. These techniques may be further classified into various categories, depending on the configuration and type of sources and receivers used. For example, zero-offset vertical seismic profiling (ZVSP), walk-away VSP etc. The source (which is typically on the surface) produces a wave travelling downwards. The receivers are positioned in an appropriate configuration at known depths. For example, in case of vertical seismic profiling, the receivers are aligned vertically, spaced approximately 15 meters apart. The vertical travel time of the wave to each of the receivers is measured and each such measurement is referred to as a ‚Äúcheck-shot‚Äù record. Multiple sources may be added or a single source may be moved along predetermined paths, generating seismic waves periodically in order to sample different points in the sub-surface. The result is a series of check-shot records, where each check-shot is typically a two or three-dimensional array representing a spatial dimension (the source-receiver offset) and a temporal dimension (the vertical travel time).  Data processing  The acquired data has to be rearranged and processed to generate a meaningful seismic profile: a two-dimensional picture of the cross section along a vertical plane passing through the source and receivers. This consists of a series of processes: filtering, deconvolution, stacking and migration.  Multichannel filtering  Multichannel filters may be applied to each individual record or to the final seismic profile. This may be done to separate different types of waves and to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. There are two well-known methods of designing velocity filters for seismic data processing applications. = Two- dimensional Fourier transform design = The two-dimensional Fourier transform is defined as: F(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(\\\\underline{x},t)e^{-j(\\\\omega t - \\\\underline{k} \\\\underline{x})}d\\\\underline{x} dt where \\\\underline{k} is the spatial frequency (also known as wavenumber) and \\\\omega is the temporal frequency. The two- dimensional equivalent of the frequency domain is also referred to as the \\\\underline{k} -\\\\omega domain. There are various techniques to design two- dimensional filters based on the Fourier transform, such as the minimax design method and design by transformation. One disadvantage of Fourier transform design is its global nature; it may filter out some desired components as well. = œÑ-p transform design = The œÑ-p transform is a special case of the Radon transform, and is simpler to apply than the Fourier transform. It allows one to study different wave modes as a function of their slowness values, p . Application of this transform involves summing (stacking) all traces in a record along a slope (slant), which results in a single trace (called the p value, slowness or the ray parameter). It transforms the input data from the space-time domain to intercept time-slowness domain. p = \\\\frac{1}{v} = \\\\frac{dt}{dx} Each value on the trace p is the sum of all the samples along the line t = \\\\tau + px The transform is defined by: F(p,\\\\tau) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x, \\\\tau + px) dx = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} f(x,t) \\\\delta(t - \\\\tau - px) dx dt The œÑ-p transform converts seismic records into a domain where all these events are separated. Simply put, each point in the œÑ-p domain is the sum of all the points in the x-t plane lying across a straight line with a slope p and intercept œÑ. That also means a point in the x-t domain transforms into a line in the œÑ-p domain, hyperbolae transform into ellipses and so on. Similar to the Fourier transform, a signal in the œÑ-p domain can also be transformed back into the x-t domain.  Deconvolution  During data acquisition, various effects have to be accounted for, such as near-surface structure around the source, noise, wavefront divergence and reverbations. It has to be ensured that a change in the seismic trace reflects a change in the geology and not one of the effects mentioned above. Deconvolution negates these effects to an extent and thus increases the resolution of the seismic data. Seismic data, or a seismogram, may be considered as a convolution of the source wavelet, the reflectivity and noise. Its deconvolution is usually implemented as a convolution with an inverse filter. Various well-known deconvolution techniques already exist for one dimension, such as predictive deconvolution, Kalman filtering and deterministic deconvolution. In multiple dimensions, however, the deconvolution process is iterative due to the difficulty of defining an inverse operator. The output data sample may be represented as: y(\\\\underline{x},t) = f(\\\\underline{x},t) ** r(\\\\underline{x},t) where f(\\\\underline{x},t) represents the source wavelet, r(\\\\underline{x},t) is the reflectivity function, \\\\underline{x} is the space vector and t is the time variable. The iterative equation for deconvolution is of the form: f_0(\\\\underline{x},t) = \\\\lambda y(\\\\underline{x},t) and f_{n+1}(\\\\underline{x},t) = \\\\lambda y(\\\\underline{x},t) + q(x,t) ** f_n(\\\\underline{x},t) , where q(x,t) = \\\\delta (\\\\underline{x},t) - r(\\\\underline{x},t) Taking the Fourier transform of the iterative equation gives: F_{n+1}(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\lambda Y(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) + F_n(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) - \\\\lambda F_n(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) This is a first-order one- dimensional difference equation with index n, input \\\\lambda Y(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)u(n), and coefficients that are functions of (\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega). The impulse response is [1 - \\\\lambda R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)]^nu(n), where u(n) represents the one-dimensional unit step function. The output then becomes: F_n(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{Y(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)}{R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)}\\\\lbrace1-[1 - \\\\lambda R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)]^{n+1}\\\\rbrace u(n) The above equation can be approximated as F_n(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{Y(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)}{R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega)} , if n \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty and 1 - \\\\lambda R(\\\\underline{k},\\\\omega) < 1 Note that the output is the same as the output of an inverse filter. An inverse filter does not actually have to be realized and the iterative procedure can be easily implemented on a computer.  Stacking  Stacking is another process used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the seismic profile. This involves gathering seismic traces from points at the same depth and summing them. This is referred to as \\"Common depth-point stacking\\" or \\"Common midpoint stacking\\". Simply speaking, when these traces are merged, the background noise cancels itself out and the seismic signal add up, thus improving the SNR.  Migration  Assuming a seismic wave s(x,z,t) travelling upwards towards the surface, where x is the position on the surface and z is the depth. The wave's propagation is described by: Evanescent and propagation regions for migration filter {\\\\partial^2 s \\\\over\\\\partial x^2} + {\\\\partial^2 s \\\\over\\\\partial z^2} = \\\\frac{1}{c^2} {\\\\partial^2 s \\\\over\\\\partial t^2} Migration refers to this wave's backward propagation. The two-dimensional Fourier transform of the wave at depth z_0 is given by: S(k_x,z_0,\\\\Omega) = \\\\int \\\\int s(x,z_0,t) e^{-j(\\\\Omega t - k_xx)} dx dt To obtain the wave profile at z = z_0, the wave field s(x,z,t) can be extrapolated to s(x,z_0 + \\\\Delta z,t) using a linear filter with an ideal response given by: H(\\\\omega_1, \\\\omega_2) = \\\\begin{cases} e^{j\\\\sqrt{\\\\alpha^2 {\\\\omega_2}^2 - {\\\\omega_1}^2}}, & \\\\text{ for } \\\\omega_1 < \\\\alpha \\\\omega_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0, & \\\\text{ else} \\\\end{cases} where \\\\omega_1 is the x component of the wavenumber, k_x, \\\\omega_2 is the temporal frequency \\\\Omega and \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{1}{c} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta z}{\\\\Delta t} For implementation, a complex fan filter is used to approximate the ideal filter described above. It must allow propagation in the region \\\\alpha \\\\omega_2  > \\\\omega_1  (called the propagating region) and attenuate waves in the region \\\\alpha \\\\omega_2  < \\\\omega_1  (called the evanescent region). The ideal frequency response is shown in the figure.

Life Originally trained as a surgeon by the East India Company, in 1802 he purchased a captaincy in the 42nd Regiment of Foot with the money he had saved during his time in India. He was promoted to major on 14November 1805 and brevet lieutenant-colonel on 1January 1812. Although the 2nd Battalion of his regiment were part of the 1808 Walcheren Campaign in Holland, he remained in Ireland and did not see active service until April 1812 at the age of 53. During the Peninsular War, Macara was present at the battles of Salamanca, Burgos, the Pyrenees, the Nivelle, the Nive, Orthes and Toulouse where he was severely wounded. For his service he received the Gold Medal and was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (KCB). Death On the 16June 1815 at the Battle of Quatre Bras, Macara was wounded during an engagement and as he was carried from the field he was taken prisoner by a party of French soldiers. His decorations gave him away as an officer of rank and he was killed on the spot. The last three verses of a contemporary poem commemorate his death: > \\"Here the Goddess ceased her lay ; Weak, her wings refused to fly ; - > Faint, her voice forbore to say > How Macara dared to die. > Be it, then, to friendship giv'n > Such a warrior's name to save, > While 'tis borne on breeze of heav'n > That he found a soldier's grave. > By unequal hosts oppos'd, > Still he proved his valour true; > For his bright career was clos'd > On the plains of Waterloo!\\" The Kinrara Waterloo Cairn in Alvie, Scotland commemorates Macara and other Scottish soldiers who were killed during the Waterloo Campaign.

Dubbed \\"the Prince of Guides\\" in Courmayeur, he was one of the most renowned guides at the end of the 19th century, making many first ascents on some of the highest and most difficult mountains in the Mont Blanc massif of the Alps. He has been described as \\"one of the greatest guides of his generation.\\" Biography √âmile Rey was born and lived his life in La Saxe, a small hamlet near Courmayeur. By trade, he was a menuisier (joiner or carpenter), and is known to have contributed to the construction of a number of the alpine huts used at that time by mountaineers to reach more easily the high summits. These huts included the refuges of the Grand Paradis, Col du G√©ant, Aiguilles Grises and Grandes Jorasses. Rey's career as a mountain guide did not begin until the \\"great age of conquest\\" of the Alps was over. Unlike many of his contemporaries, he did not learn his craft by serving an apprenticeship with other, older guides. One British mountaineer wrote in detail about Rey's achievements in \\"Pioneers of the Alps\\" (1888) The first offer that Rey received of a long-term engagement as a guide came only after he had reached the age of thirty, when Lord Wentworth retained him for the greater part of the 1876 climbing season, and for the subsequent two seasons. In 1877 they made notable first ascents together of the Aiguille (Noire) de Peuterey, and Les Jumeaux de Valtournanche. However it was with two other clients, J. Baumann and John Oakley Maund, that Rey started to make his name as one of the most skillful and boldest rock-climbers in the Alps. Not all of their attempts at bold new routes were successful, including their attempt at the Aiguille du Plan from the Plan des Aiguilles. Another unsuccessful, but nevertheless very bold early attempt took place in 1881 when J. Baumann, Rey, and his two fellow guides, Johann Juan and J. Maurer, attempted to climb the Eiger's Mittellegi ridge. They were thwarted by the difficult big step on that ridge which is nowadays adorned with a fixed rope strung from it, and which was finally climbed for the first time in 1925. Referring to their unsuccessful attempt, J. Baumann wrote about his guide's efforts: The Mittellegi ridge on the Eiger Rey's first major achievement as a mountaineer and guide came in 1877 when he successfully made the first ever ascent of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey. Thereafter, Mont Blanc became an important venue for his mountaineering exploits, and he had many regular wealthy clients from across Europe, including Elizabeth Hawkins-Whitshed, Paul G√ºssfeldt and Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi. In 1882, Rey was leader of a team that retrieved the bodies of Francis Maitland Balfour and his guide Johann Petrus, who together had attempted to make the first ascent of the Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey. Balfour had invited Rey to join his party, but Rey declined, considering the snow to be in a dangerous condition. It was to be another three years later before Rey was involved in the first successful attempt to reach its summit. Commenting in the Alpine Journal on the series of audacious first ascents and new routes that had recently taken place on the Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey, the soldier and mountaineer, J. P. Farrar, who was later to become president of the Alpine Club, noted: Rey was married to Faustina Vercelin and had sons Adolphe and Henri, the eldest, and a grandson, Emile. He was evidently very proud of his children. (1878‚Äì1969) went on to become a mountain guide like his father. First ascents He made more than a dozen first ascents, including: * 1877: First ascent of the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey with Lord Wentworth (the grandson of Lord Byron) and Jean-Baptiste Bich on 5 August. * 1879: First ascent of the Aiguille de Tal√®fre (3,730 m) with Johan Baumann, F. J. Cullinan, G. Fitzgerald, Joseph Moser and Laurent Lanier on 25 August. * 1880: First ascent of the Col de Peuterey with Georg Gruber and Pierre Revel, the Freney, August 13. * 1882: First ascent of the Calotte de Rochefort, the main summit of Les P√©riades, with C. D. Cunningham. * 1883: First ascent of the Lower Peak of the Aiguille du Midi, with C. D. Cunningham. * 1885: First ascent of the Aiguille Blanche de Peuterey with Henry Seymour King and guides Ambros Supersaxo and Alois Andenmatten on 31 July. * 1887: First traverse of the Grand Dru to the Petit Dru with Henri Dunod and Fran√ßois Simond on 31 August. * 1888: First winter traverse of Mont Blanc from the Italian side, with Alessandro, Corradino, Erminio and Vittorio Sella, Joseph Jean-Baptiste and Daniele Maquignaz and Giuseppe Maquignaz and two porters. They went from the Aiguilles Grises, cutting many steps in the Bosses Ridge to reach the summit, and then descended to the Grand Mulets, on 5 January. It was later described as a \\"very remarkable and daring enterprise\\". * 1888: New route to Mont Blanc by the Aiguille de Bionnassay east ridge with Katharine Richardson and Jean-Baptiste Bich on 13 August. * 1889: First traverse from Petit Dru to the Grand Dru with Katharine Richardson and Jean- Baptiste Bich on 30 August (with assistance from guides positioned at Grand Dru). * 1890: Castor North Face (in descent) with Katharine Richardson and Jean Baptiste Bich. * 1893: First ascent of Mont Blanc by the Aiguille Blanche and the Peuterey Ridge with Paul G√ºssfeldt, Christian Klucker and Cesar Ollier. Four-day climb from 14 to 17 August. * 1895: Mont Maudit NW Ridge, via Col du Mont Maudit. First climbed (in descent) with George Morse, after a celebratory 50th birthday ascent for Rey of Mont Blanc, on 21 August. He was killed three days later. Other significant ascents with which Rey was involved include: * 1879: Second ascent of the Grand Dru. * The third, fourth, and fifth ascents of the higher peak of the Dru over four consecutive days. One of these ascents, with W.E. Davidson, was made direct from Montenvert without an overnight stop beforehand. It was also made totally unaided by fixed ropes or ladders, a feat that impressed the first ascensionist, C. T. Dent, who had spent innumerable hours on the route. * On 16 August 1892 he made the first ascent of the 'variant G√ºssfeldt', marking the fourth ascent of the Brenva ridge route onto Mont Blanc, with Paul Gussfeldt, Laurent Croux and Michel Savoye. During this ascent Gussfeldt's ice axe fell into the dangerous couloir which nowadays bears his name. * 1877: First traverse of the Grands Charmoz. * Gran Paradiso from the glacier of the Tribulation. * Dent d'H√©rens to the crest Tiefenmatten. Travels abroad In the winter of 1884 Rey travelled to Britain where he spent some weeks with alpine mountaineer C. D. Cunningham in England. His trip included an intellectual afternoon visit to Madame Tussaud's in the company of the editor of the Nineteenth Century literary magazine and a visit to Scotland where on 11 February after a spell of bad weather, Rey, Cunningham and a local man, John Cameron, made a winter ascent to the top of Ben Nevis. At the summit they visited the new observatory which had been opened just a few months earlier, and enjoyed hot steaming coffee and toasted ship's biscuits in the company of the observer and his two assistants. Cunningham later observed that Rey was known to have referred to their trip up Ben Nevis more frequently than some of his other great achievements in the Alps. Whilst in Scotland Rey also visited Edinburgh where he went to the top of Arthur's Seat, local tradition stating that before doing so he estimated it would take much of the day to achieve. Rey is known to have spent a winter in Meiringen in order to learn German so that, as a leading guide himself, he would be better equipped to work with some of the top Swiss guides such as Andreas Maurer whose mountaineering skills he much admired. He knew they would constantly come into contact with one another, and that this would better help him work together with the Oberland guide. Personality Rey was known to have always kept himself fit and in condition. He never smoked and was described as always having a temperate manner in whatever he did, and was always courteous ‚Äì a characteristic which gained him many acquaintances well beyond the usual climbing circles. In the autumn of 1886 Rey was climbing on the Schreckhorn in the Bernese Oberland and narrowly avoided being killed in an avalanche. However another guided party some ten minutes behind his was struck by falling ice, and their client, a Herr Munz, was killed, and his guide, Meyer, very severely injured, and subsequently died. Rey took the lead in retrieving Munz's body and taking it back down to Grindlewald. One of the alpine climbers who was with Rey, C.D. Cunningham, later wrote how impressed he was with the \\"great force of character and power of organisation that Rey displayed\\". He observed how Rey's ability to take the lead without seeming to take command of his fellow guides provided \\"the moving spirit of the whole party\\". Rey has, however, been described as a man who never underestimated his own abilities as a mountain guide, nor did he try to conceal the pride he got from having gained such a good reputation. Writing in 'Pioneers of the Alps (1888) Cunningham, with whom he had made numerous alpine ascents over many years, wrote thus: Cunningham also noted how willing Rey always was to attend to his clients' needs first, rather than his own, whether more immediate needs in the hut following a long and very tiring day, or in being bold on the rock to ensure they would overcome all difficulties to attain their summit. Despite this determination to succeed, he was always prepared to draw the line \\"when foolhardiness was about to take the place of courage\\". Writing about his life amongst the high alpine summits, Rey once said: \\"it is not the earnings that push me up to the peaks, it is the great passion I have for the mountains. I have always considered the payment secondary in my life as a guide.\\" Survival against the odds The Aiguille du Plan from La Fl√©g√®re, showing the Glacier du Plan descending from its summit The account below is extracted almost verbatim from True Tales of Mountain Adventure: For Non-Climbers Young and Old (1903): Death and legacy The Dent du G√©ant Rey was killed in a fall whilst descending the lower, easy rocks at the base of the Dent du G√©ant on 24 August 1895 with his client, A. Carson Roberts. They were unroped. Roberts subsequently wrote at very great length and detail about the events, suggested that Rey might have fallen because of some malaise which might have led to a \\"physical seizure\\" at an inopportune moment he previously observed that Rey had not been displaying his usual good form or temperament. Another source later suggested the slip might have been \\"due to excessive and incorrect hobnailing of his boots\\". On hearing of Rey's death, Prince Luigi Amedeo, Duke of the Abruzzi was said to have been devastated by the news. Rey was buried in Courmayeur, the form of his gravestone somewhat resembling that of the Dent du G√©ant, with an ice axe and rope hung over one corner. It bore the following epitaph: IN MEMORIA DI EMILIO REY GUIDA ITALIANA VALENTISSIMA AMATO DEI SUOI ALPINISTI IN LUNGA SERIA D'IMPRESE MAESTRO LORO DI ARDIMENTI DI PRUDENZA FATALMENTE CADUTO AL DENTE DEL GIGANTE IL 24 AGOSTO 1895 Amongst the wreaths left at his funeral were those from some of the famous names in the annals of alpine mountaineering, including Katharine Richardson, Paul G√ºssfeldt and C. D. Cunningham, all of whom had climbed with this guide. In a short obituary in the Alpine Journal, G√ºssfeldt described Rey as \\"the great guide of Courmayeur [whose death] is generally felt as an irreparable loss\\". Forty years after Rey's death, mountaineer Frank S. Smythe described him as \\"the greatest guide of his generation\\". Honours The Brouillard ridge, with labels showing the Col Emile Rey and other significant features The Col Emile Rey (4030 m), located on the Italian side of Mont Blanc (between Mont Brouillard and Picco Luigi Amedeo), is named in Rey's honour. Described as \\"a superb col in wild surroundings\\", it can be subject to bad stonefall on both sides. It is not used as a route between adjacent glaciers, but can be used by mountaineers to access the Brouillard Ridge. The first traverse of the Col √âmile Rey was made in 1899 by G.B. and G.F. Gugliermina with N. Shiavi, exactly four years to the day after Rey's death. A memorial tablet to Rey, figuring a coiled rope and ice axe, stood in the Piazza Abb√© Henry in Courmayeur until at least 1957. It was subsequently replaced with a monument containing a sculpted figure, showing him in a similar pose to that of his photograph, wearing his guide's hat. It bears the words \\"Emile Rey, 1846‚Äì1895, Prince Des Guides\\". It stands between monuments to two other alpine guides from Courmayeur, Giuseppe Petigax (1860‚Äì1926) and (1918‚Äì1954).

History The council was gazetted on 5 January 1888 under the provisions of the District Councils Act 1887, and initially consisted of the cadastral Hundreds of Coonatto, Gregory, Pinda, Willochra and Willowie, and part of the Hundred of Woolundunga. It was divided into five wards (Coonatto, Pinda, Willowie, Wilmington and Willochra) on 5 June 1888, each represented by two councillors. In 1890, it lost the Hundred of Willowie and part of the Hundred of Gregory to the District Council of Port Germein. It was renamed the District Council of Hammond on 25 May 1893. It lost a large portion of the Hundred of Willochra to the District Council of Kanyaka in the 1890s, and gained the Hundred of Moockra from Kanyaka in 1894. It was a farming and grazing district badly hit by both the depression of the 1890s and the Great Depression in the 1930s, and it was said in 1923 that the Hammond council district had \\"not progressed to any great extent\\" \\"owing to the long dry spells common to districts in the far north\\". In 1923, the Hammond council had an area of 214,400 acres. It had an estimated population of 732 in 1921, with 250 ratepayers, living in 156 dwellings, with the capital value of ratable property being ¬£145,840. The council underwent major boundary changes on 16 February 1933 as a result of local government amalgamations at that time: it resumed its former name of Wilmington and incorporated most of the abolished District Council of Woolundunga, and regained the 1890 section of the Hundred of Gregory from the District Council of Port Germein. Council roadworks were still being done manually or with horse-drawn vehicles into the 1940s. It amalgamated with the District Council of Port Germein to form the District Council of Mount Remarkable on 1 July 1980, following boundary changes which had seen Redcliff (now in Miranda) and Stirling North, formerly in Wilmington, annexed to the City of Port Augusta.

Chen Chien-jen is a devout Catholic. Chen and his wife were invited to visit the Vatican several times by Popes John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis. He has been invested as a Knight of the Equestrian of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (2010) and a Knight of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great (2013).

Career as researcher Chen obtained a master's degree in public health from the National Taiwan University, and received his Sc.D in human genetics and epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University in 1977 and 1982, respectively. He began his medical career by researching hepatitis B, and helped raise awareness about vaccination for the disease in Taiwan. Chen further researched on the liver cancer risk of people with hepatitis B. Chen also discovered a link from arsenic to blackfoot disease. The arsenic research lead to the revision of international health standards for arsenic exposure. Between 2011 and November 2015, Chen was a vice president of Academia Sinica. Political career Chen served as Minister of Health from 2003 to 2005. As health minister, he was praised for effectively managing the SARS epidemic through quarantine and screening procedures, despite Taiwan's non-membership in the World Health Organization complicating the coordination of research efforts. His successor Hou Sheng-mao credited Chen with reforming the National Health Insurance program. Chen led the National Science Council from 2006 to 2008. Vice presidency On 16 November 2015, Chen was confirmed as the running mate for Tsai Ing-wen in the 2016 Taiwanese presidential election after media speculation earlier in the month. During the campaign, Chen became known by the nickname Brother Da-jen (Â§ß‰ªÅÂì•), after a character portrayed by Chen Bolin on the romantic drama In Time with You. Chen is the first Catholic vice presidential nominee in Taiwan. On 16 January 2016, Tsai and Chen won the presidential election in a landslide. Chen took up his post as Vice President on 20 May 2016.Austin Ramzy: Tsai Ing-wen Sworn In as Taiwan‚Äôs President, as China Watches Closely. In: The New York Times, 19 May 2016. In March 2019, Chen announced that he would not seek a second term as vice president alongside Tsai. Chen received international attention for his role in leading Taiwan's response to the COVID-19 pandemic due to his unique position as both vice president and his epidemiologist background. Days before he stepped down from the vice presidency, Chen stated that he would return to the Academia Sinica as a research fellow and thus forgo the pension connected to his political office.

The first stone of the mosque was laid by Muammar Gaddafi in 1978Str√•th, Bo (2010), Europe and the Other and Europe as the Other, p. 248. and its doors were open to the public in 1982, and officiated in 1984. The initial scope of the building was to serve the Muslims in Malta, at the time mainly economic migrants from Libya, and to promote conversions to Sunni Islam among the Maltese society. Even though there are a number of other Muslim places of worship in Malta, the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque is the only officially recognized and mosque-designed structure in the country,Sammut, Carmen (2007), Media and Maltese Society, Lexington Books, p. 61. so it is colloquially referred to in Maltese as simply il-Moskea (lit. \\"the Mosque\\"). The building of others have been proposed. History The mosque is built at Corradino Hill, close to the Corradino Lines and the Kordin III megalithic temple. The formerly public land, circa , was bought (or donated) from the Maltese governmentGoodwin, Stefan (2002), Malta, Mediterranean Bridge, pp. 185-186. in 1975 which consisted of an undeveloped site. A full development application was drafted by 16 April 1975.Cordina, J. C. (2018, December 30). Islamic Centre in Malta commemorates its 40th Anniversary. The Malta Independent, pp. 37. Construction on the mosque started in 1978 and finished in 1982 when it was opened to the public.Geo, Volume 3, Issue 2 p.66 The mosque was officially opened in 1984 by Muammar Gaddafi\\"The Muslim Cemetery at Paola\\" Malta Family History. when Malta and Libya signed the Treaty of \\"Friendship and Cooperation\\".Uwe Jens Rudolf, Warren G. Berg (2010), Historical Dictionary Malta, p.143. The mosque and Islamic centre were given diplomatic immunity by the Maltese Government. Muammar Gaddafi directly contributed to the projectGlobal Affairs, 1986, p.94. both by buying the land and by partly funding the construction of the mosque. The mosque is found on the side of Dom Mintoff Road (formerly Corradino Road) and is administered by the World Islamic Call Society (WICS). It was built during Prime Minister Dom Mintoff's term in office during the first wave of economic negotiations between Malta and Libya. The Government of Malta, under Prime Minister Dom Mintoff, has also contributed to the building of the Mosque. The Mosque and the minaret costed roughly Lm 900,000. Complex Dom Mintoff Road: Mosque Complex on the left, MCAST to the right The Mosque is found in an Islamic complex, referred to as the Mosque complex,\\"PL committed to help Mariam al-Batool school develop\\", Maltastar.com, 2012. called the Islamic Centre in Malta. The complex also consists of a school, the Mariam Al-Batool School,\\"Country Report: Malta\\", 2008. the Islamic Cultural Centre (ƒäentru Kulturali Islamiku), a courtyard, the Imam's house, The Malta Islamic Cemetery (Iƒã-ƒäimiterju Islamiku f'Malta) and the Mediterranean Garden. The latter is situated on public land, next to the mosque complex. It was originally called Gaddafi Gardens, and it became known as Libyans' Garden after the Libyan Civil War.Deidun, Alan (2014), \\"A tribute to local mature gardens\\", Times of Malta. It was officially renamed to its present name in March 2016. The Malta Islamic Cemetery is built on public land with permission granted by the Maltese government. There is a plan to build a secondary school for Muslim children at the back of the Mosque. The complex, specifically the mosque, has become symbolic of the revival of Islam in Malta, and been seen by some as the first wave of modern \\"Muslim invasion\\"Gerard, Alison (2014), The Securitization of Migration and Refugee Women, Routledge, p. 19. and significantly it symbolizes 'Libya's bridge to Europe' specifically after the Lockerbie bombing. Governance Islamic Cultural Centre, Paola The Mosque is administered by members of the Muslim community and separate from the government of Malta. The main Imam of the Mosque is Mohammed Elsadi,Vogel, Dita (2009), Stories and Reflections of Immigrant Activists in Europe, p.28. known as \\"Ix-Xih\\" (literally meaning \\"the elder\\").Emer Smyth, Maureen Lyons and Merik Darmody (2013), Religious Education in a Multicultural Europe: Children, Parents and Schools, Palgrave Macmillan, p. 78. Elsadi was born to Palestinian refugees whom came to Malta because of the Arab-Israeli war. As a consequence El Sadi has obtained Maltese citizenship. Elsadi is described as a fundamentalist by Fr Ren√© Camilleri for supporting the strict compliance to sharia, but anthropologist Ranier Fsadni believes this is not a common belief among Muslims and that the Imam is \\"intellectually honest\\". Indeed, the consumption of alcohol, by Muslims in Malta, is a common practice that goes against the fundamental teachings of Islam.\\"Where to find halal food in Malta?\\", halaltrip.com, 2014. The Islamic religious culture affairs is under the responsibility of Omar Ahmed Farhat. Muslims have the right to govern their religious environment issues in line with Maltese law and the government of Malta is sensitive about it. When the Mosque was inaugurated it was considered very large but today the mosque's religious service on its own has become too small to cater for the unforeseen growth of the Muslim community, mainly being foreigners. Bader Zeina, a Palestinian migrant, is a separate Muslim organizer and leader of the Islamic Community Malta (ICM). Architecture and customs The Mariam Al-Batool Mosque is the first Mosque in Malta to be built in modernity,2006, New Oxford Review, Volume 73, p. 34. with the most previous Mosque having been built in 1702 during the Order of St JohnWettinger, Godfrey (2002), Slavery in the Islands of Malta and Gozo ca. 1000-1812, Publishers Enterprises Group, p. 455. for Turkish slaves within a prison buildingWettinger, Godfrey (2002), in Cini, George, \\"Horrible torture on streets of Valletta\\". of which no traces remain and limited description of its construction. A street in Mdina, Triq Mesquita (Mesquita Street) and Piazza Mesquita, may have been named after a former Mosque that stood on site during the Arab period in Malta.G√ºlhanƒ±n Galaksi Rehberi (2011), \\"MALTA Hakkƒ±nda TV programlarƒ±\\", Malta'da √ñƒürencilik.\\"Islamic Focus\\". p.6. However these were probably named after a former Governor of Mdina that was named Don Mesquita.Francesco Balbi, Ernle Dusgate Selby Bradford (1965), \\"The Siege of Malta, 1565\\", Boydell Press, , p. 176.Pickes, Time (1998), \\"Malta 1565: Last Battle of the Crusades\\", Osprey Publishing, , p. 79. Most Islamic-related themes have been \\"eradicated from the national narrative.\\" On 21 April 1975 Libya has bought a land area of in Paola. The land was acquired to build a muslim centre according to Libyan customs designed by the Libyan architect Mohammed Abid Elshukri, which is the architect of the Mosque, the Islamic Cultural Centre and a terrace overlooking the original gardens where the school and the cemetery are found today. The project was entrusted to Gebco International Ltd. Co. under the supervision of Maltese engineer Alfred Balzan. The first stone was laid by Muammar Gaddafi on 2 July 1978 in a public ceremony. The Mosque was constructed with the use of Limestone, plastered, and painted in green, yellow and pink colors. The minaret became a landmark in Paola skyline since then, being the second highest building after the parish church until day, at high. Exterior The minaret is a landmark in Paola. The whitewashing contrasts with the traditional colors of the mosque, after its refurbishment. On the fa√ßade a plaque refers to the building simply as 'Moskea' that is a word in use in Maltese when referring to a Mosque. The shell structure of the Al-Batool Mosque is made of limestone while the arabic architecture is made of both limestone and wood. The mosque has one dome painted in green (Gaddafi is well associated with this color) and one minaret that is a landmark in its own right by being visible from wide parts of the surroundings, and for this reason it is often used to explain directions. The minaret has been recently restored, of which during restoration the flag of Libya was put to waive on it as a symbol of the downfall of Muammar Gaddafi, during the Libyan civil war. After the restoration the green color surface of the minaret was changed from dark green to light green could be observed, with the pink color being completely removed; while the mosque has had no recent restoration keeping the traditional colors since the inauguration by Gaddafi. The mosque and the minaret are distinguished from the rest of Maltese architecture by adopting arabic masonry such as the building of the dome, the windows, an octagonal minaret, and the aesthetic use of eye-catching light colors from the exterior.Peter L. Twohig and Vera Kalitzkus (eds.) (2005), Social Studies of Health, Illness and Disease: perspectives from the social sciences and humanities, p. 50. Interior The interior consists mainly of the Islamic prayer hall in the form of sex segregation. Women have separate rooms next to the mosque of which entrance is from the back side, probable within the cultural centre building. An Islamic code of clothing is followed and provision for decent covering, mainly for women according to Muslim traditions, is available. Malta has no restrictions on Islamic dressing such as the veil (hijab) nor the full face veil (burqa and/or niqab)Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 4 p. 393. but strictly speaking face covering is illegal,Dalli, Miriam (2015), \\"MP calls for banning of the burqa: ‚ÄòDecision requires rational debate‚Äô\\", Malta Today. however an official ban on face covering for religious reasons is ambiguous.Camilleri, Neil (2015), \\"In Malta, wearing a burqa while driving is ‚Äònot illegal‚Äô - police\\", The Malta Independent. However it is guaranteed that individuals are allowed to wear as they wish at their private homes and at the Mosque. Imam El Sadi has said that the banning of the niqab and the burka \\"offends Muslim women\\". Elsadi said that the Maltese's \\"attitude towards Muslim women\\" is positive and despite cultural clashes they tolerate their dressing. Some Muslim women share the belief that it is sinful to be seen in public without veiling themselves, however they are lawfully required to remove it when needed such as for photos on identifications.J√∏rgen Nielsen; Samim Akg√∂n√ºl; Ahmet Aliba≈°iƒá; Egdunas Racius (2014), Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 6, Brill, p.411. The mosque also consists of a washing room for the obligatory tradition of Muslims to wash themselves before prayers.Ahmad Chaudhry, Rashid (2015),\\"Ahmad and Sarah go to Mosque\\", Ahmadiyya Muslim Jamaat Malta. A larger than usual Koran is displayed inside the mosque.Press Releases, \\"U.S. Ambassador Visits Paola Mosque and Mariam Albatool School\\" Public policy Mariam Al-Batool Complex as seen from MCAST The mosque is open for the public, including non-Muslims, from 8am to 10pm. Traditional Friday prayers are held every Friday at 1pm. Conservative Muslim customs have to be respected, such as the removal of shoes before entering the mosque, men-only space and women-only space specifically during prayer time, and other Islamic-related customs. Catering According to Imam Mohammed el-Sadi, the Islamic centre issues certificates for each wedding that takes place on site but these are not considered legitimate by the state and are legally null.https://academic.oup.com/ojlr/article- abstract/7/3/498/5101402 Wedding ceremonies are celebrated at the mosque, including interfaith ceremonies, but Muslim women are not welcomed to conduct their ceremonies at the mosque if they wed a non-Muslim, while non-Muslim women are told to raise their children as Muslims when marrying a Muslim man and advised before the ceremony takes place at the mosque. Imam El Sadi does not encourage mixed-faith marriages as the overwhelming majority of them fail. The mosque does not cater or welcome LGBT people and their rights, bringing some controversy in the Maltese political sphere. Attendants The mosque is visited by mainly Maltese Muslims, tourists, migrants and refugees. The Muslim community in Malta has increased from less than a hundred Muslims in 1974, to 3,000 Muslims in 2007, to 6,000 Muslims in 2011, to 10,000 Muslims in 2014. These estimates can be discredited as there has never been a proper conducted census about the Muslim population by the National Statistics Office (NSO Malta).Zammit Martin R. (2012), in J√∏rgen S. Nielsen, J√∏rgen Nielsen, Samim Akg√∂n√ºl, Ahmet Alibasi and Egdunas Racius (2012), Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 4, Brill, p. 389. There are about 18,000 refugees in Malta according to The Daily TelegraphFreeman, Colin (2013), \\"EU immigration: 'Malta is the smallest state, and we are carrying a burden that is much bigger than any other country'\\" with the overwhelming majority being malesGerard, Alison (2014), The Securitization of Migration and Refugee Women, Routledge, p. 20-28. and Muslims. In 2016 Ivan Vella said that there are up to 45,000 Muslims in MaltaDiacono, Tim (2016), \\"[WATCH] ‚ÄòPatriot‚Äô arrested after harassing media during protest\\", Malta Today but this was also a conservative figure. With the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in Libya over 55,000 visas were issued for Libyan citizens, generally of Muslim faith, to live in Malta, between 2011 and 2015. However, these are, for the most of them, temporary visas for medical care or other reasons.\\"Aktar minn 55,000 visa lil Libjani\\", netnews.com.mt, 2015. Entry to Mediterranean Garden (formerly Gaddafi Gardens) and The Malta Islamic Cemetery The rapid growth of Muslims is mainly attributed to economic migrants, accompanied by interfaith marriages.\\"Islam in Malta\\", Thinksite.eu. Over 1,300 men are naturalized Maltese citizens mostly through marriage,Goodwin, Stefan (2002), Malta, Mediterranean Bridge, p. 185. and around 250 are native-born citizens of Malta. Around 350 Maltese citizens are reported to have converted to Islam, mainly Maltese women before or after marrying their Muslim husband; in general this is desired by Muslims to ensure that their children are raised \\"devout muslims\\". Maltese women are at times either \\"forced\\", pressured or persuaded to convert to Islam. Some muslim fathers have gone as far as taking their children away from their Maltese mothers, by taking them to their country of origin, with the scope to further ensure that they are raised as Muslims.\\"Mother fights to bring children back to Malta Libyan father took son and daughter after marriage failed\\"\\"Court: Father Fears daughter maybe brought up as a Muslim\\" The mosque has become too small in the context of the growth of the Muslim population. Most of the attendants are from Libya, Somalia and Syria. The rise of crime among foreign Muslims,Pisani, John (2010), \\"Heddewh wara li deher fuq il-programm Xarabank: Ragel li kien musulman u sar kristjan\\", L-Orizzont.Micallef, Keith (2015), \\"Somali, Libyan remanded in custody over Paceville fight\\", Times of Malta. in Malta, is turning the mosque community into an isolated ghetto.Sammut, Carmen (2015), in Leone-Ganado Philip, at \\"Facebook fiction that became media fact\\", Allied Newspapers - Times of Malta. Imam Elsadi himself said that the Muslim community aims not to \\"live in ghettoes\\".Vogel, Dita (2009), Stories and Reflections of Immigrant Activists in Europe, Peter Lang, p. 29. Some efforts by Maltese politicians have taken place to avoid this, such as by official visits. Communication The mosque makes the use of both Arabic as an Islamic tradition and English to communicate to the multicultural attendants. The loudspeaker at the mosque was shortly used to call for prayers but stopped after the nearby communities complained as the adhan unconventionally was used as early as 4 a.m. and disturbed public peace. The mosque is a seldom place of some conflict between non-nationals but mostly peaceful. The mosque's administration communicates to the public in general through their website mariamalbatool.com. Other forms of communication is participation in media discussion, such as on radio and on television, and occasional events such as conferences.Vogel, Dita (2009), Stories and Reflections of Immigrant Activists in Europe. pp.28, 29., . Mosque-state relations=Official visits Mariam Al-Batool School is interconnected to the Mosque via the Islamic Cultural Centre The then President of Malta George Abela has paid a visit to the Islamic centre in Paola in specific the Mariam Al-Batool School. Archbishop Paul Cremona has visited the mosque delivering prayers in it and on a different occasion he has also visited the Islamic Cultural Centre. The Prime Minister of Malta Lawrence Gonzi was the first Maltese politician to have visited the mosque when discussions on the financial crisis situation of Mariam Al-Batool School were the main reason. The mosque was subsequently visited by the Prime Minister Joseph Muscat and US Ambassador to Malta Douglas Kmiec also in cause of the Mariam Al-Batool financial crisis. In 2015 the Mosque received a visit by the Qatari Ambassador for Malta Ali Alkhirgi together with Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to discuss for a possible plan to build another Mosque in the north of Malta. Political activism Imam El Sadi has pledged political support to both political parties sitting in the Maltese parliament (during the different visits of both prime ministers) on condition to improve the Islamic environment ranging from the building of new mosques, financing education at Mariam Al-Batool School, recognising Islamic traditions and others. However, according to Elsadi himself the Muslim community is a majoritarian Labour Party supporter. This is encouraged by Mario Farrugia Borg (a Muslim convert and former Nationalist Party supporter), who is a leader at the Islamic Centre and a secretariat of Prime Minister Joseph Muscat. The Nationalist Party is known in recent history that for several years referred to the Muslims as \\"tal-habbaziz\\" (literally refers to Northern African selling cyperus esculentusMartin Morana (2011). Bejn Kliem u Storja. p. 100.) which is a derogatory reference when referring to an Arab; this has contributed to make the mosque complex a ghetto and associating anything Arab with pessimist remarks, such as the Arabic language.E Mazawi, Andr√© and Sultana, Ronald G. (eds.) (2010), World Yearbook of Education 2010: Education and the Arab 'World': Political Projects, Struggles and Geometries of power, p. 245. However the party has been trying to be more inclusive to the muslim community in more recent years.Cioffi, Yendrick (2014), \\"LOKALI Il- Komunit√† Musulmana tagƒßni lis-soƒãjet√† Maltija - Simon Busuttil\\" Indeed, a meeting that was held with the muslim community to celebrate iftar was called by Imam Elsadi as a \\"historic\\" event.Il-komunita musulmana f' Malta ticcelebra l-iftar mal-partit nazzjonalista. Political pressure from the mosque administration on the government of Malta has become common in the exchange of favors such as voting during elections.Vella Gauchi J (1991), Islamic Law and Mixed Marriages in Malta, London. Alternative prayer houses Apart from resolving the school financial crisis, most of the visits at the mosque are devoted to discuss the building of new Mosques. This is in the context that the Al-Batool Mosque is the only official Mosque in Malta, with more than fifteen other Muslims prayer houses scattered around the country such as; Birkirkara, Bugibba, Fgura, Ghaxaq, Marsa (Albert Town), Hal Safi (Open Centre), Pieta,Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 4 p.391. St. Paul's Bay, San Gwann (Ta' Giorni), Sliema (Dar tal-Islam), Hal Far, Qawra, Msida,Msida Local Council Zurrieq, and others. Of these at least two prayer houses\\"Malta\\", state.gov, p. 1. have legal permission by the Malta Environment and Planning Authority (MEPA) to operate as informal Mosques. The building of a Mosque in Marsascala at the American University of Malta (AUM) has been shelved for now. The Maltese government has provided for an interfaith room at Mater Dei Hospital that is the main public hospital in Malta.J√∏rgen Nielsen, Samim Akg√∂n√ºl, Ahmet Aliba≈°iƒá, Egdunas Racius (eds.) (2013), Yearbook of Muslims in Europe, Volume 5, Brill Publishing, p. 431. . An interfaith centre of religious service consisting of a church, a mosque and a synagogue designed by Richard England was planned to be built in Xewkija, Gozo but after receiving local opposition to the project it remained shelved.Cauci Cunnigham, Albert (2015), \\"Il-pjanijiet gƒßal moskea ƒ°dida fit-tramuntana fil-‚Äòfri≈ºa‚Äô\\", Illum. Situation Some prayer houses that have not been granted legal permission to operate as Mosques were shut down and the Malta Security Services (MSS) is concerned\\"Security Services increasingly concerned by ISIS in Libya, Times of Malta, 2015. about these settlements fearing some of these places may radicalize some Muslims and recruit youth converts that may threaten national security. In response to this Bader Zeina has taken a Muslim group to pray at Sliema waterfront to demand for the \\"fundamental human right\\" of worshipping gods both in private residences without legal restrictions and on public property. Zeina said that in the case of a backclash, coming from discrimination, \\"violence or revenge\\" may be expected.Peregin, Christian (2009), \\"Muslims gather in prayer along Sliema front\\". The National Constitutional Court of Malta has said that even though individuals have the right to private property the use of such right has its limitations, and that there were no victims of discrimination as the law is proportional to everyone, with respect to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, including freedom of religion. For this reason the court has noted that there was no breach of article 8 (1) of the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR), which is in harmony with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.Camilleri, Silvio;Valenzia, Geoffrey; Caruana Demajo; Giannino (2011), \\"Qorti Kostituzzjonali\\", pp. 4-8. Following this, in January 2016 a male-only muslim group started to gather for Friday prayers in an open public place, in front of a Roman Catholic church, in Msida. These prayers were said to be considered, by organizer Bader Zeina, as also to be a form of protest for not having where to pray. The same organizer was previously involved in similar acts, such as in Sliema and Bugibba, when it became known that gathering and location were never the issues but rather the want of another place other than Mariam Al-Batool Mosque. Faced with similar crisis from the Muslim community, the Maltese Government made temporal arrangement for Islamic prayers in Floriana. The building known as the Ospizio, a former mental health hospital that is now hosting the prayers, is ideal as it is found right behind the national police headquarters in Malta. Imam El Sadi has said that he is left uninformed about public prayers, organized by Zeina, and about any negotiations with the government. The Imam was not able to give his position about public prayers organised in Sliema and Msida as these were not his initiatives and he was neither informed of. Religious freedom The US embassy in Malta has stated that respect to religious freedom is guaranteed by the government of Malta and reports of \\"forced religious conversion\\" are absent.\\"Malta\\" . Mario Farrugia Borg, who works at the mosque, had stated that by being appointed as a personal secretariat at the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) and being a Christian convert to Islam he does not observe any discrimination. Imam El Sadi describes the Maltese society as \\"generous and tolerant\\". However, when a former Muslim, Khaled Baarl, had announced publicly on Xarabank his conversion from Islam to Christianity he was discriminated by exclusion from the Muslim community, and threatened to death by Syrian refugees. Dome and minoret Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has some worrying reservations over \\"some groups\\" that promote radical sunni Islam in the form of salafism, and has largely relied on the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque's administration to help managing the crisis. The integration process of refugees within Maltese society has failed because of the large number of foreigners coming within a short period. Most refugees who arrive in Malta are from war-torn Islamic countries, some with fundamentalist ideologies, such as Libya, Somalia and Syria. Extremist remarks against western countries by muslims have been reported in the northern region of Malta. Mario Farrugia Borg, being a muslim himself, has called for drastic measures against \\"illegal migration\\". The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has ruled against Joseph Muscat's opt for \\"pushback\\" of illegal migrants to Libya, despite the threat some refugees may present, as this goes against the fundamental human right principle of non-refoulement.Zammit Cordina, Mark (2013), \\"European Court blocks deportation of migrants - NGOs protest outside police HQ - PM to make statement\\". Times of Malta. Imam Elsadi has distant himself from Islamic extremism but still supporting fundamental principles of Islam. Elsadi does not believe there are threats of terrorism in Malta but does not rule out extremism sympathisers among the local Muslim community.Camilleri, Neil (2015), \\"Imam does not exclude Muslims having sympathy towards extremists, but says no terrorists in Malta\\", The Malta Independent. The Armed Forces of Malta (AFM) have taken some precautions for this matter. Laiq Ahmed Atif (the President of the Ahmadiyya Muslim community in Malta, born in Pakistan) has said that even though Islam literally means peace, the action of some are far- off than peaceful, and has called for the \\"need to reform\\" Islamic culture.Dalli, Kim (2013), \\"Muslims in Malta need to ‚Äòwork hard at integration‚Äô\\", Times of Malta. He also adds that adherents of Islam \\"have a religious duty\\" to live in peace in Malta.Carabott, Sarah (2014), \\"'Muslims have a religious duty to love island'\\", Times of Malta. He encouraged reforming the process of refugees' integration such as by teaching the Maltese language and Maltese culture. However Imam Elsadi has not conceded to the teaching of Maltese culture where it is contrary to Islamic traditions. Elsadi and Ahmed Atif have both condemned the Charlie Hebdo shooting that took place in January 2015.\\"Malta's Muslim leaders condemn Paris attacks\\", Times of Malta, 2015. A protest was organised by the Muslim community right after Friday prayers in December 2015, at the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque, to distant themselves and the Islamic religion from every sort of terrorism were roughly around 100 muslims had attended. This had further shown that during Friday prayers, when attendance should be at its peak, most muslims are not attending the Al-Batool Mosque.Dalli, Miriam (2015), \\"[WATCH] Maltese Muslim community protests terrorism, calls for unity\\", Malta Today.\\"Muslim community protests against terrorism - urges world action against IS\\" Times of Malta, 2015.\\"Muslim community in Malta condemns terrorism\\", China.org.cn, 2015.\\"Muslims in Malta protest against terrorism\\", tvm.com.mt, 2015. According to Imam Elsadi several muslims in Malta are \\"ignorant\\" about Islam, and argues that since many muslims come from homogenous societies they find it hard to accept diversity in Maltese society, and even among other muslim ethnic group themselves. Context For these reasons the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque has once again gained national notability in Malta, over similar controversies, since its inauguration by Muammar Gaddafi in 1984. In order to address such crisis the Maltese government and the Muslim society have agreed to seek the building of another mosque in Malta; if this materializes the Mariam Al-Batool Mosque will no longer be the \\"only mosque in Malta\\".

The temple is believed to have been constructed sometime in the 9th century AD, and by the Paramara dynasty, which is also credited with having constructed the original structure of the Achalgarh Fort, later reconstructed, renovated and named as Achalgarh by Maharana Kumbha in 1452 CE. Etymology The word 'Achaleshwar' is a word displaying Sanskritic sandhi and is derived from the Sanskrit words 'Achal' meaning immovable, and 'Ishwar' meaning 'God', while the word 'Mahadeva', again formed by the rules of sandhi, means the great (maha) god (deva), and is an epithet of Shiva, the deity to whom the temple is dedicated. History According to local legend, the temple is built around a toe print of Shiva. Shiva is worshipped, like at most Shiva temples, in the form of a Shiva linga, a nuclear reactor dome shape alike structure representing Shiva and the power of creation, seated on top of a surface, an abstract representation of Shakti. The shiva linga at this temple is a naturally occurring stone structure. The temple stands in the centre of an enclosure on the southern side of the Agnikund, wherein there are several small shrines dedicated to Shiva's mount, Nandi. Of particular interest and importance is a four tonne statue of Nandi made of panchadhatu, the alloy used for making idols, which is composed of five metals ‚Äì gold, silver, copper, brass and zinc. According to a popular local legend, the statue of Nandi is credited with protecting the temple from an attack of Muslim invaders by releasing innumerable bumble bees onto the attackers thereby saving the temple from destruction. The temple also has several other idols, sculpted from sphatik, a quartz stone, which appears opaque in natural light but becomes crystal-like translucent when a light is held against it. Within the temple is a pit which is believed by the locals to be a doorway to Naraka, the netherworld. Close to the temple is a pond with three large stone buffalo statues. These buffaloes are believed to be representative of demons who, according to legend, flocked to the watering hole, which was said to be filled with ghee, until they were shot dead by the king, Raja Adi Pal. Repairs and Renovation The temple was the victim of shoddy repair and renovation work. A thick layer of lime covered the intricate and fine filigree work and marble carvings of the temple interiors, for which the artisans of Rajasthan were famous, which resulted in the beauty of the temple being hidden and reducing it to an insignificant structure. However, this was a boon in disguise, for it protected the fine marble from damage over the years. In 1979, the crown prince of the Sirohi princely state chanced upon a piece of marble exposed under the lime, and that started the renovation work of the temple under the aegis of the crown prince. Skilled artisans began the work to restore the temple to its past glory by carefully removing the lime to reveal the underlying marble beauty. Pillars and columns were carefully removed, reworked on, and then set back in correctly. During the renovations to the garbhagriha, sanctum sanctorum of the temple, it was revealed that is wasn't built of bricks with marble slabs on top, but of huge blocks of marble. A path was also unearthed, that went around the sanctum sanctorum, for the purpose of parikrama, the Hindu custom of circumambulation. Sculptures of the goddess Chamunda were found on two alcoves, the rear one and the one on the left. These were smeared with the auspicious red vermillion, indicating that these were regularly worshipped in the days before the repair work was undertaken.

The Barossa wine industry, however, was disorganised and made up of over 560 peasant sized growers in the 1880s. While vineyards were expanding, what was lacking was the winery space. Chateau Tanunda from the air GF Cleland and William Jacob of Moorooroo formed the GF Cleland and Co ltd in 1888 luring wine pioneers Sir Samuel and Lady Davenport, Dr and Mrs ED Cleland and CJ Horrocks to invest. Working together with Barossa growers kingpin John Basedow and many smaller investors, they raised ¬£38,700 to build the Ch√¢teau Tanunda winery building. With high unemployment in Australia at the time due to many strikes and a drop in foreign investment, the Barossa had a large supply of skilled stonemasons ideal for the construction of the large stone building. Chateau Tanunda Barossa Valley south facade Chateau Tanunda eastern wing and croquet field The schisty bluestone for the edifice of the building was dug from a quarry in the nearby Bethany, and brick kilns erected at the front of a site chosen on highest point of the Barossa Valley floor, facing south over the first Barossa vineyards. John Basedow and his men completed the edifice in 11 months, which was the biggest building in the Southern Hemisphere when completed in 1890. Once established, the winery could handle 100 tons of grapes per day. By 1902 exports totalled 80,000 gallons of Ch√¢teau Tanunda brandy, and 700,000 gallons of wine at ¬£1 per gallon. From 1916 to 1998, the Chateau was owned by the Seppelt family. The business and structure was restored by the Geber family who purchased it in 1998, including building a small batch basket press winery. Its wines come from over 100 hectares of estate owned vineyards in the sub-regions of Bethany, Eden Valley, Vine Vale and Tanunda, as well as grapes from 30 growers across the Barossa Valley.http://www.businessfirstmagazine.com.au/australian-wine-exports- us/1208/*  Wines produced  Ch√¢teau Tanunda produces table wines from the grape varieties Shiraz, Cabernet Sauvignon, Grenache, Chardonnay, and Riesling, and was also known for its brandy in the past.

It is pollinated by a single species of male thynnid wasp using sexual deception. The orchid's labellum is similar in shape and scent to a flightless female thynnid wasp. It is known from only one population and has been declared \\"endangered\\" by the Australian government and \\"threatened\\" by the government of Western Australia. It was first collected in 1984 by Robert J. Bates. No other Drakaea species is found it the same area but the broad-billed duck orchid (Paracaleana triens) is found nearby.  Description  Drakaea isolata is similar to others in the genus in that it has a single, ground hugging leaf and an underground tuber. In this case, the leaf is heart shaped, about in diameter and is often withered by the time the flower opens. The leaf is covered with tiny lumps or short hairs, blue-grey with darker lines radiating from the attachment to the stem. The stem is long and the stalk of the single flower is long. The flower is also similar to those of other hammer orchids in that the labellum resembles a flightless female thynnid wasp, except that in this species the column is pointed, the labellum lacks an upturned end and the main body of the labellum has long hairs and a longer narrow \\"neck\\". The sepal at the back of the flower is long and the two at the sides are . The petals are also long. The insect-like labellum has a \\"head\\" about one-third long as the \\"body\\" and has a pair of dark projections near its base . The rest of the labellum (representing the female \\"body\\" of the insect) is dark maroon in colour, glabrous and not swollen as in Drakaea glyptodon. The flower is similar to that of Drakaea confluens but is smaller and more uniform in colour. Flowers appear from September to the middle of October.  Taxonomy and naming  Drakaea isolata was first formally described by Stephen Hopper and Andrew Brown in 2007. Their description was published in Australian Systematic Botany. The specific epithet (isolata) is a Latin word meaning \\"isolated\\" in reference to this species of hammer orchid being found well away from others.  Distribution and habitat  Lonely hammer orchid occurs near Pingrup in the Mallee biogeographic region where it grows in sand near a salt lake.  Conservation  The Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife classifies the species as \\"threatened\\" meaning that it is considered likely to become extinct, or rare and in need of special protection. In 2003, the entire population of the species was estimated to be about 75 mature plants and a number of immature ones. The Australian Government lists its status under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act as \\"endangered\\". The main threats to the species' survival are road and track maintenance, airborne dust, changes to groundwater levels and inappropriate fire regimes.

The two developed the idea after Perkins expressed interest in telling \\"a creepy supernatural story with a lot of twists and fake-outs\\" and came up with the idea of a story about \\"two young women doing a house-swap ‚Äì only to find that one of the houses has some unsettling history to it.\\" Synopsis The comic opens with Katie making an emergency phone call as she tries to escape Rowans Rise. While fleeing she makes mention of several murders that took place during the course of the house's history and refers to an unnamed evil that was born at the house. She emphasizes that if she dies before the police arrive, that it shouldn't be considered anything other a murder. Just as she's getting ready to tell the dispatcher about what or who is committing the murders, Katie is attacked by a male figure with glowing red eyes. The comic then flashes back to six months prior, showing Katie talking with her parents about advertising her apartment on a house swap website. Despite her parents' misgivings, she agrees to swap houses with Emily, a young woman living in England. Upon arrival Katie is extremely taken with both England and Emily's home, Rowans Rise, and features it heavily in her blog \\"New Adventures of Katie\\". During a video she makes mention of a nearby dule tree where they hung purported witches and odd things she noticed about the house, such as bird bones set in the mortar of some of the doors. She also comments on an animal trap she found in the house and repeated blackouts. Some time after she settles into the house Katie enters Emily's room (despite requests that she not enter), where she discovers that Emily's bed is surrounded by a ring of salt and other supernatural paraphernalia. She shrugs this off, however, and decides to continue her stay at Rowans Rise. Katie later meets PC Hallam at a bar and the two strike up a romance. Through Hallam she discovers that the house is rumored to be haunted, especially as multiple animals have been killed on the property. Katie confesses to him that when she was younger she would receive strong feelings about places, and that while this was thought to have been a kind of mental illness that went away on its own, she has started to have bad experiences and feelings upon waking. The first issue ends with Katie briefly seeing an image of a strange man in her bathroom mirror, but dismissing it as a figment of her imagination. Reception Critical reception for the series has been positive and the first issue has a rating of 7.7 on Comic Book Roundup, based on 7 reviews. Shock Till You Drop wrote a favorable review for Rowans Ruin, stating \\"Mixing classic horror with modern technologies, the work offers up a story of isolation that preys on the creeping fear that we are never really alone and, with a mini-series format, promises a limited work that won‚Äôt over stay its welcome.\\" Comic Book Resources gave the first issue four stars, as they felt that it was \\"a rare combination of great characterization and heart-stopping horror that doesn't resort to clich√©s, instead focusing on the characters and their 21st century influences.\\" References Boom!

She was also one of the founders of a school in Eccles, England. Early years Annie Maria Armitt was born in Salford, England, in 1850, the middle of three gifted daughters of William and Mary Ann (Whalley) Armitt. The sisters were all well educated, and Armitt ‚Äì who knew from an early age that she wanted to be a writer ‚Äì studied English literature at Islington House Academy. This academy was in Salford and it trained people to teach along Pestalozzian principles. Her older sister Sophie took to botany and would later become a nature writer, and her younger sister Mary Louisa (known as Louie) excelled at music and natural history and later wrote (mainly for periodicals) on topics ranging from ornithology to local history. Founding a school Armitt travelled to Paris in 1866 with Sophie to study French, but the following year her father died unexpectedly and she returned to England. Armitt and her sisters then established a school at Eccles in Lancashire. In 1877, Armitt, married Stanford Harris, a physician, and the couple went to live near Hawkshead. Neither of them were well and the marriage was not happy. Literary work Armitt published her first novel, The Garden at Monkholme, in 1878. It was critically well received, with The Westminster Review praising it as \\"a new departure in fiction\\" for its focus on characters who were unattractive and for Armitt's ability to make drama out of commonplace events. Similarly, The Scottish Review admired it for Armitt's outstanding depiction of character. Her 1885 novel In Shallow Waters was praised for its compelling depiction of the self-sacrificing protagonist, Henry Dilworth. An excerpt from this novel gives a sense of Armitt's dry, Austenian style at its best: :\\"She did not admire clever girls, and was never enthusiastic in her praise of good ones‚Äîthose at least, who were specially marked out as such by their parochial visitations and love of week-day services...She was inclined to insinuate that any one who made a very visible application of herself to heavenly things must be drawn thereto by a lack of earthly prosperity.\\" Armitt also published poems, short stories, and essays, including a brief life of Mary Shelley. The poet Robert Browning wrote that he was impressed by some of her poems. Old age In 1882, Armitt's sisters came to live near Hawkshead in the town of Rydal, and after being widowed, Armitt joined them there in 1894. The sisters lived together until Sophie and Louie died in 1908 and 1911. Armitt survived her sisters by two decades, dying in 1933.

She occasionally makes sculptures and video-works. Kraijer studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Rotterdam, graduating in 1994 with a series of large format charcoal drawings.Baar, V. and S√ºt√∂, W. (2009) Juul Kraijer. Rotterdam: FREEM. In the drawings Kraijer's subject is always female, naked and depersonalized, an archetype or personage rather than a particular individual.Alphen, E. van and Malbert, R. (2015) Juul Kraijer : werken 2009-2015. Zwolle: WBOOKS. The model is sometimes multiplied: facing herself, head to head, or appearing as Siamese twins or triplets. In most works the human body is combined with other creatures or natural phenomena: surrounded by schools of little fish or swarms of moths, fused with branches or parts of animals or displaying mountainscapes on the skin. Kraijer favors charcoal, and only rarely works in colour. The size of her drawings is determined by the image, which is always depicted more or less life-size. Since 2012 photography has been an important medium in Kraijers practice. Her photographs are also mostly black and white and thematically closely related to her drawings. She often works with the same model, who poses with objects or animals, most notably snakes. Kraijer's works share an emblemata-like concision, showing no more than what is strictly necessary. In each image, the figure looms out of an undefined background. Definition of time is absent as well. No hairstyles or dress belonging to any specific period are shown, no hint of a narrative is present. The postures and facial expressions are deliberately restrained and intensely concentrated. They seem to have been adopted for eternity.Kraijer, J. (1998) The Hydra. Rotterdam. Faces and bodies are a vehicle for meaning rather than portrayals of individuals. The impassive visage, in a state of half-sleep, seems to exist at an interface between self-awareness and self-extinction.Malbert, R. (2015) Drawing People. The Human figure in Contemporary Art.

When he took office in 2009, he was the youngest university president ever appointed in Germany. In June 2019, he was elected President of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD); he took office on 1 January 2020.  Education  Born in the Rhineland in Germany as the son of Indian immigrants, Mukherjee studied English Language and Literature, Biology and Pedagogy at the Technical University of Aachen, where he completed his master's degree and took the First State Examination (the teaching degree in Germany) in 1997. After a period as a trainee teacher and part-time teacher at the \\"Gymnasium am Wirteltor\\", D√ºren, he took the Second State Examination in 1999 and embarked on his doctoral studies at the University of Bonn with a major in English philology and minors in genetics and educational science. In 2000 he gained his PhD in English Linguistics with a dissertation on the interaction between intonation and syntax. It was also at Bonn that he completed his habilitation, for which he wrote a post-doctoral thesis on English ditransitive verbs, and that he received the venia legendi in 2003, the German authorisation to teach at university, in the field of English Philology.  Academic career  In 2003, Mukherjee was appointed to the chair of English Linguistics at the University of Giessen. His research interests include Applied Corpus Linguistics, English Syntax and Varieties of English. At the University of Giessen, he is a principal investigator at the International Graduate Centre for the Study of Culture (GCSC), which was funded in both funding rounds under the Excellence Initiative of the German federal and state governments between 2006 and 2019. He was President of the Executive Board of the International Computer Archive of Modern and Medieval English (ICAME) from 2011 to 2017. Mukherjee was Vice-President of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) from 2012 to 2019. On 1 January 2020, he took office as the DAAD‚Äôs current president, thus leading one of the world‚Äôs most important funding organisations for the international exchange of students and researchers. Between October 2016 and September 2018, he was Speaker of the Conference of Hessian University Presidents. He is also a member of various advisory boards and boards of trustees. Although he received several calls to other universities, including the universities of Zurich (Switzerland) and Salzburg (Austria), Mukherjee chose to stay at the University of Giessen. The University of Agricultural Sciences and Veterinary Medicine of Iasi (Romania) awarded him an Honorary Doctorate (Dr. h. c.) in 2012 for his academic achievements and his contribution to strengthening the excellent ties between the two universities. In March 2018, he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by the Tbilisi State University (TSU) in Georgia.  Politics, university governance and policy  Mukherjee is a member of the SPD (Social Democratic Party of Germany) and was nominated by the Hessian SPD to participate in the 14th Federal Convention, which elected the German Federal President on 30 June 2010. Between 2004 and 2008 Joybrato Mukherjee was Vice Dean of the Faculty of Language, Literature and Culture; between 2005/2006 and 2008 he was also a member of the senate at the University of Giessen as well as the spokesperson for the \\"Neue Universit√§t\\", a group of politically independent professors supporting the university's development. At the beginning of 2008, Mukherjee was elected First Vice-President of the University of Giessen by a large majority. On 8 March 2009, the extended senate elected him President of the university in the first ballot, with 20 out of 34 votes. He took office on 16 December 2009, succeeding Stefan Hormuth. On 11 February 2015, the extended senate elected Mukherjee president for a second term until 2021. Again, he won the election in the first ballot, securing 27 out of 34 votes. The Executive Board of JLU under Mukherjee's leadership since 2009 has pursued the goal of increasing the basic funding of Hessian universities. Mukherjee is particularly committed to promoting cooperation involving the different stakeholders in the academic community in the form of regional consortia recommended by the German Council of Science and Humanities. Particularly in the light of the privatisation of the university teaching hospital, University Hospital of Giessen and Marburg, Mukherjee and the Executive Board of JLU are committed to securing and guaranteeing teaching and research in university medicine and at the same time to taking an objective, discerning view of privatisation. In cooperation with the Hanns Martin Schleyer Foundation, the JLU organised the XIII University Symposium (Hochschulsymposium) at the State Representation Office of the State of Hesse in Berlin on 20 and 21 February 2019. Attendees of the symposium critically engaged with various challenges today‚Äôs university medicine has to face. Amongst other topics, they dealt with the requirements of an increasing digitalisation and with questions concerning the international competitiveness of Germany as a medical location. Mukherjee is pursuing a clear institutional internationalisation strategy with the Executive Board of JLU. Under his leadership, JLU was one of the first pilot universities to participate in the Internationalisation Audit in 2010 run by the German Rectors' Conference and was the first university in Germany to be successful in the re-audit. This led JLU to launch its new Internationalisation Strategy in 2016 entitled ‚ÄúProgress through Internationalisation ‚Äì JLU International 2016-2020‚Äù. Mukherjee sees gender equality as crucial to the university's identity. In 2009, JLU implemented the instrument of the research-oriented gender equality standards set by the German Research Foundation (DFG), upon which DFG rated JLU as belonging to the top group. Mukherjee was a member of the DFG gender equality working party until 2019. In June 2019, he was elected President of the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD). He took office on 1 January 2020. According to Mukherjee, ‚Äúproviding support, advice and analysis‚Äù is the brand essence of the DAAD which he also sets as the priorities of his work. In addition to promoting academic exchange, he sees the core tasks of the DAAD as providing advice to the higher education sector and serving as a think tank for internationalisation.

He has also worked as a university lecturer and has a doctorate in jurisprudence. Despite having been born in Austria, for many years Hollmann has lived with his family in Basel, Switzerland. Life Hans Hollmann's father, also called Hans Hollmann, was well known in and around Graz as a music teacher. His mother was also a teacher. Hollmann attended the Gymnasium (school) in Graz and then progressed to the local university, emerging in 1956 with a doctorate in jurisprudence. He then switched to drama, as he studied at the Reinhardt Seminar at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna. In 1958 he received a diploma in acting. He then made a start professionally, both an actor and as a director, at Vienna's Josefstadt Theatre. His breakthrough as a director came in the 1964/65 season with a production of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet at the Heidelberg Theatre. In 1967 he achieved wider recognition internationally with a production of √ñd√∂n von Horv√°th's \\"Italian Night\\" at the Stuttgart State Theatre: the production later moved on to Berlin's Kurf√ºrstendamm Theatre. In December 1974 he directed the first comprehensive production of The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus,\\"The Last Days of mankind\\" is an unconventional piece, described by one source as a tragedy in five acts with a prologue and an epilogue, comprising 220 brief mosaic like scenes each of which consists of faithfully reproduced original quotations from all social strata, new reports, speeches and letters by soldiers and civilians over two evenings in the foyer of the Basel Theatre, which raised him to the status of one of the top theatre directors in German speaking central Europe. The next years he was appointed to the directorship of the theatre, a position he held for three years till 1978. He later reprised his The Last Days of Mankind for the 1980 Vienna Festival, with a cast that included Helmut Lohner, Peter Weck, Paulus Manker, and G√∂tz Kauffmann, and has returned the piece on various occasions more recently. Over a period of several decades Hans Hollmann has directed in all the major theatres of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. A particular focus has been in respect of contemporary theatre, including first productions of plays by Bertolt Brecht, Elias Canetti, Tankred Dorst, Rainald Goetz, Peter Handke, Elfriede Jelinek, Heiner M√ºller and Botho Strauss. He has also manifested an enduring interest in music theatre. In 1993 Hollmann accepted a professorship in Theatre Direction at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Frankfurt am Main., heading up the Faculty of Performing Arts as dean between 1998 and 2003. While at Frankfurt he conceived and created what in 2002 became today's \\"Hessian Theatre Academy\\" (\\"Hessische Theaterakademie\\"), an association- network of four drama universities/academies and fifteen theatres in and around Frankfurt. It introduced an entirely new approach to artistic training, and for many years Hollmann himself served as its president, until succeeded in that role by Heiner Goebbels in 2006. The Hamburg Theatre Academy founded in 1994 followed the same model. Along with numerous adaptations, translations and screenplays, Hans Hollmann has written many essays and other contributions on theatre. He has also given many public readings, focusing in particular on the writings of Elias Canetti, Karl Kraus und Heinrich Heine. Personal Hans Hollmann is married to the actress Reinhild Solf. The marriage produced two recorded children. Their son, Caspar Florian, was killed in an avalanche accident in 2001. Appreciation Since 1967 Hans Hollmann productions have frequently been invited to be at the Berlin Theatre Festival. He is a member of the German Academy of Presentational Arts and an honorary member of the Berlin National Theatre company. He is a holder of the Austrian Decoration for Science and Art (First class) and of the Styrian Cross of Honour (Gold). He has also been a recipient of the Josef Kainz Medal from the city of Vienna and, in 2006, of the highest honour from the State of Hessen, the Goethe Award.

Robin Hill discovered the reaction in 1937. He demonstrated that the process by which plants produce oxygen is separate from the process that converts carbon dioxide to sugars. History The evolution of oxygen during the light-dependent steps in photosynthesis (Hill reaction) was proposed and proven by British biochemist Robin Hill. He demonstrated that isolated chloroplasts would make oxygen (O2) but not fix carbon dioxide (CO2). This is evidence that the light and dark reactions occur at different sites within the cell. Hill's finding was that the origin of oxygen in photosynthesis is water (H2O) not carbon dioxide (CO2) as previously believed. Hill's observation of chloroplasts in dark conditions and in the absence of CO2, showed that the artificial electron acceptor was oxidized but not reduced, terminating the process, but without production of oxygen and sugar. This observation allowed Hill to conclude that oxygen is released during the light-dependent steps (Hill reaction) of photosynthesis. Hill also discovered Hill reagents, artificial electron acceptors that participate in the light reaction, such as Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), a dye that changes color when reduced. These dyes permitted the finding of electron transport chains during photosynthesis. Further studies of the Hill reaction were made in 1957 by plant physiologist Daniel I. Arnon. Arnon studied the Hill reaction using a natural electron acceptor, NADP. He demonstrated the light-independent reaction, observing the reaction under dark conditions with an abundance of carbon dioxide. He found that carbon fixation was independent of light. Arnon effectively separated the light-dependent reaction, which produces ATP, NADPH, H+ and oxygen, from the light-independent reaction that produces sugars.  Biochemistry  Noncyclic photophosphorylation through light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis at the thylakoid membranePhotosynthesis is the process in which light energy is absorbed and converted to chemical energy. This chemical energy is eventually used in the conversion of carbon dioxide to sugar in plants.  Natural electron acceptor  During photosynthesis, natural electron acceptor NADP is reduced to NADPH in chloroplasts. The following equilibrium reaction takes place. A reduction reaction that stores energy as NADPH: :NADP+ + 2H+ + 2e- -> NADPH + H+ (Reduction) An oxidation reaction as NADPH's energy is used elsewhere: :NADP+ + 2H+ + 2e- < NADPH + H+ (Oxidation) Ferredoxin, also known as a NADH+ reductase, is an enzyme that catalyzes the reduction reaction. It is easy to oxidize NADPH but difficult to reduce NADP+, hence a catalyst is beneficial. Cytochromes are conjugate proteins that contain a haem group. The iron atom from this group undergoes redox reactions: :Fe3+ + e- -> Fe2+ (Reduction) :Fe3+ + e- < Fe2+ (Oxidation) The light-dependent redox reaction takes place before the light-independent reaction in photosynthesis. Chloroplasts in vitro A diagram of the Hill reaction which shows with the usage of an artificial electron acceptor such as DCPIP, and the chloroplast is subjected to light there is a release of oxygen, Also with the absence of CO2 there is no sugar production A diagram of the Hill reaction taking place under dark conditions there is no oxygen emitted and the no reduction of the electron acceptors occur Isolated chloroplasts placed under light conditions but in the absence of CO2, reduce and then oxidize artificial electron acceptors, allowing the process to proceed. Oxygen (O2) is released as a byproduct, but not sugar (CH2O). Chloroplasts placed under dark conditions and in the absence of CO2, oxidize the artificial acceptor but do not reduce it, terminating the process, without production of oxygen or sugar. A diagram of the hill reaction under light conditions and the use of a natural electron acceptor A diagram of the light-independent reaction as found by Arnon(1954) which shows the formation of sugar without the presence of light Relation to phosphorylation The association of phosphorylation and the reduction of an electron acceptor such as ferricyanide increase similarly with the addition of phosphate, magnesium (Mg), and ADP. The existence of these three components is important for maximal reductive and phosphorylative activity. Similar increases in the rate of ferricyanide reduction can be stimulated by a dilution technique. Dilution does not cause a further increase in the rate in which ferricyanide is reduced with the accumulation of ADP, phosphate, and Mg to a treated chloroplast suspension. ATP inhibits the rate of ferricyanide reduction. Studies of light intensities revealed that the effect was largely on the light-independent steps of the Hill reaction. These observations are explained in terms of a proposed method in which phosphate esterifies during electron transport reactions, reducing ferricyanide, while the rate of electron transport is limited by the rate of phosphorylation. An increase in the rate of phosphorylation increases the rate by which electrons are transported in the electron transport system. Hill reagent The addition of DCPIP experimentally to a chlorophyll molecule containing solution which shows a change in color due to the reduction of DCPIP It is possible to introduce an artificial electron acceptor into the light reaction, such as a dye that changes color when it is reduced. These are known as Hill reagents. These dyes permitted the finding of electron transport chains during photosynthesis. Dichlorophenolindophenol (DCPIP), an example of these dyes, is widely used by experimenters. DCPIP is a dark blue solution that becomes lighter as it is reduced. It provides experimenters with a simple visual test and easily observable light reaction. In another approach to studying photosynthesis, light-absorbing pigments such as chlorophyll can be extracted from chloroplasts. Like so many important biological systems in the cell, the photosynthetic system is ordered and compartmentalized in a system of membranes.

Overview of the result After steadily increasing their representation throughout the inter-war period, the Labour Party finally won a majority on the Council, and strengthened their hold by taking nine of the ten vacancies on the aldermanic bench. Labour victories included taking a seat in the Borough of Carmarthen for the first time. Gwynfor Evans, President of Plaid Cymru, was returned for the Llangadog ward. Boundary changes There were no boundary changes. Unopposed returns There were a number of unopposed returns, both in Labour held seats and in the western part of the county, which was described as still being 'traditionally Liberal in character'. Contested elections While there were more unopposed returns than in 1946, many wards were keenly contested. Electioneering reached a peak in Llanelli where an Independent association was formed to fight the elections as a united front against Labour. However, Labour won all but two seats in Llanelli town. Retiring aldermen faced the electorate for the first time since 1937. In Llangyndeyrn, Alderman Rev. James Jenkins, a member of the Council since 1925, was defeated by the retiring Labour councilor. However, Dame Gwendoline Trubshaw was one of only two Independent candidates to secure election in Llanelli.

In the early 4th century it may have been the seat of a bishop, who by the end of the century moved to neighbouring Selymbria. The inhabitants of the town were involved in the Nika riots of 532 against Emperor Justinian I. The locality is next mentioned in 1078, as the site of the Battle of Kalavrye, where the forces of Emperor Nikephoros III Botaneiates, led by Alexios Komnenos, defeated the army of the rebel general Nikephoros Bryennios the Elder. It is next mentioned by the Arab geographer al-Idrisi as Geliwr√Æ; al-Idrisi records it simply as a locality close to Selymbria. The village was home to a Greek community (numbering 212 in 1922) until the Greco-Turkish population exchange. It was the site of a Church of the Transfiguration and of a namesake hagiasma, but both have since vanished.

Crosby, along with Mary Bosanquet, are the most popular women preachers of Methodism. Scholars such as Paul Wesley Chilcote consider Crosby to be the busiest female Methodist preacher, as she preached up until the day she died. She was also renowned for being skilled at prayer, which at the time was seen as a sort of religious art form. Early life Crosby was born in Leeds on 6 October 1729. Not much is known about her early life, aside from the fact that she enjoyed singing, dancing, and playing cards. Crosby did not become interested in religion until she began to attend Anglican services when she was 14 years old. She started to develop a fear of death, which became pronounced when she was 17, perhaps because of a bout of illness. As a result, Crosby devoted herself even more to religion, fearing that she would die and be sent to Hell.  Life  In 1750, Crosby married. Not much is known about Mr. Crosby, including his first name. Similarly, Sarah Crosby's maiden name is not known ‚àí she is always addressed as 'Mrs. Crosby.' The Crosbys' marriage did not last long; Mr. Crosby left Sarah Crosby on 2 February 1757, after seven years of marriage. It is unclear why the Crosbys' marriage ended. Some speculate that Mr. Crosby was not a Methodist, and discouraged her from practicing her religion. Others have said that Mr. Crosby introduced Sarah Crosby to John Wesley's writings, which may have indicated that he was a Methodist. Mr. Crosby's religion remains unknown, as do most details about him. Other possible reasons for the end of Crosby's marriage include that Mr. Crosby might have been an alcoholic, or that he may have been unfaithful. Crosby met Mary Bosanquet in May 1757, and the two became lifelong friends. During the summer of 1758 Crosby moved to the Moorfields, to live with Mary Bosanquet, Sarah Ryan, and Mary Clark, all of whom would become prominent female figures in Methodism. They worked together to assist the poor and disabled. Crosby had somewhat of a conflict with John Wesley's wife, Mary Vazeille. In 1758, Crosby wrote to Wesley and, in her letter, made harsh comments about Vazeille. Vazeille saw the letter and was angry and jealous, since she knew that Crosby and Wesley were great friends and often traveled together. It is unknown how but eventually the dispute was resolved, and Crosby and Wesley remained friends. It is also unclear if Vazeille was correct in her thinking that Wesley was being unfaithful with Crosby. The matter was never again discussed by Crosby or Wesley. In 1761, Crosby went on a mission to Derby, where she became the first woman to preach in Methodism. She left Derby in April 1761, and it is unknown where she went afterward. However, it is known that Crosby was quite busy with church duties during 1762. In 1763, she began working and living with Mary Bosanquet and Sarah Ryan at their orphanage, The Cedars, in Leytonstone. Crosby followed the pair when they moved their orphanage to Cross Hall in Yorkshire in 1768. During the 1770s, Crosby traveled across England preaching; she wrote that she had traveled 960 miles in the year 1777 alone. Some of the time, she traveled with John Wesley. Mary Bosanquet, who had controlled most of the operations of Cross Hall, married and moved to Madeley. As a result, Cross Hall was closed in late 1781. So, when Crosby returned from her travels, she went back to Leeds. Constant traveling had taken a toll on her health. Rheumatism was making it hard for her to write as well, so she started to record less entries in her diary. Because of this, not much is known about the details of her later life.  Charity work  The Cedars = Plaque to The Cedars on the site where it once stood The Cedars was founded on 24 March 1763 by Sarah Ryan and Mary Bosanquet, and after a few months Sarah Crosby began to live and work there. The Cedars was modeled after John Wesley's orphanage, the Kingswood School. The women at The Cedars helped to care for 35 children and 34 adults, most of whom were dirty, unclothed, ill, and/or uneducated. Education at The Cedars included instruction in manners, reading, religion, writing, nursing, and domestic skills in order to prepare the children for life beyond the orphanage. The children were subject to harsh physical punishment if they misbehaved. Because there was no Methodist Society in Leytonstone, Mary Bosanquet and Crosby instituted nightly Scriptural readings and prayer. The women asked John Wesley to send them a preacher in order to have a more religious environment inside of the orphanage. Wesley sent a Mr. Murlin to preach, and soon The Cedars became a Methodist Society. Despite this, Bosanquet and Crosby continued to hold their own religious services on Thursday nights, and began to attract large crowds. Bosanquet and Crosby were so successful that The Cedars became a center of Methodism in Leytonstone. Methodist men began to express opposition toward Bosanquet and Crosby's activities, though they were not able to stop them. In 1768, the orphanage was moved to Yorkshire, to a farm named Cross Hall. The decision was made due to increasing costs, to give a better environment for the children, and to seek out fresh air for Sarah Ryan, who was becoming seriously ill. = Cross Hall = Cross Hall was founded in 1768. The move was made from The Cedars to Cross Hall in order to decrease costs (since the women would be able to grow their own food), give the children a nice environment, and hopefully improve Sarah Ryan's failing health. However, Bosanquet and the other women had little-to-no experience with farm life, and growing their own food did not prove to be as successful as they had hoped. Additionally, shortly after arriving at Cross Hall, Sarah Ryan died. Cross Hall not only served as an orphanage but also became a Methodist center. Crosby, Mary Bosanquet, Sarah Ryan, Sarah \\"Sally\\" Lawrence, and Mary Tooth took residence there. Often, Elizabeth Ritchie, Susanna Knapp, and other prominent Methodist women visited. Bosanquet closed Cross Hall on 2 January 1782 following her marriage to John Fletcher. All of the children were either moved to new homes or found an occupation before the orphanage was closed.  Experiences with the Methodist Church  alt=In the winter of 1749, Crosby heard both George Whitefield and John Wesley, the founders of Methodism, preach in London. Though she heard the two founders speak, she was not instantly converted. She held negative views of Wesley and Methodism, which were common at the time. But, after reading some of Wesley's work, she became interested in the religion. Crosby was converted to Methodism on 29 October 1749. Crosby joined the ranks of the parishioners at The Foundery, a Methodist Society, in October 1750. She began to lead her own Methodist classes in 1752. In 1761, in Derby, Crosby became the first woman to preach in Methodism. Crosby was a traveling preacher during the 1770s. From the 1780s on she was stationed in Leeds. In 1793 she moved in with her friend and fellow preacher, Ann Tripp. Their house was near a Methodist meeting-place, the Old Boggard House, where she taught two Methodist classes a week. Crosby, along with Ann Tripp, helped to lead The Female Brethren, an association of female Methodist preachers. Up until she died, Crosby was still incredibly active in the Methodist Church. She led classes, went to meetings, and preached during the week before her death. Preaching Shortly after becoming a class leader, Crosby had vision of Jesus whilst praying. In her vision, Jesus said: \\"Feed my sheep.\\" Crosby interpreted this vision as God calling her to preach. Crosby's first experience with preaching came in Derby in February 1761. She went to the town on a missionary quest and was instructed to lead classes. The first class that she led went well, and had less than 30 students. However, the following Sunday, over 200 people attended her class. Usually, in a class setting, Crosby would have given individualized advice to a small group of less than 50; however, since there was such a large crowd, she could not do so and decided to preach instead. Her preaching consisted of reading a hymn, praying, and telling a story of how God had impacted her life. On February 13, she preached again. Crosby wrote to John Wesley to tell him of what she had done and to get his advice. He replied on February 14, approving of her actions, but cautioned her ‚àí he was wary of what others might think if he allowed women to preach in his religion, so he advised Crosby to try to refrain from the language and mannerisms of preaching as much as she could. According to many scholars, this marked the beginning of John Wesley's acceptance of women preachers in Methodism, and made Crosby the first woman to receive this title. While living and working at Cross Hall, Sarah Crosby, along with Mary Bosanquet, began to hold Methodist meetings and preach at night. Some Methodists opposed this practice, but Crosby and Bosanquet continued until Cross Hall's closure. Crosby's and Bosanquet's preaching at Cross Hall would become the impetus for Wesley allowing women to preach in Methodism in 1771. In 1769, Wesley wrote to Crosby, allowing her to give pieces of spiritual advice, or exhortations, in her preaching. In 1771, Wesley formally allowed Methodist women to preach in public. This was the direct result of a letter written by Mary Bosanquet to John Wesley, defending hers and Sarah Crosby's preaching at Cross Hall. Bosanquet argued that women should be allowed to preach in Methodism when they experienced an 'extraordinary call,' or permission, from God. Mary Bosanquet's letter to John Wesley is considered to be the first true defense of women's preaching in Methodism. It is also considered to be the argument that persuaded John Wesley to give women the provision to preach. Scholar Thomas M. Morrow argues that Wesley only allowed women to preach because they were successful in converting people; he did not have a change of heart, and did not allow women to preach in order to make any sort of statement. According to Morrow, Wesley only did this in order to expand his religion. On 13 June 1771, Wesley wrote to Crosby with instructions on how to lead public meetings, since she could now officially preach. Throughout the 1770s, Crosby traveled and preached. Apparently, she was quite popular, and often spoke to hundreds at her sermons. She once even spoke to a crowd of 500-600 people in the rain, despite losing her voice and being sore from traveling. Crosby's preaching was not welcome everywhere, however, and her preaching at Cross Hall was not the only instance in which her work was opposed. During the summer of 1770, John Wesley went to preach at a church, and was told that he would not be allowed to because the parishioners had heard about a Methodist woman preaching nearby. Sarah Crosby had recently been to a nearby church in Huddersfield, but had only led a class there and did not preach. Wesley did not seem to be angered by the ordeal, and told Crosby that their preaching would be welcomed elsewhere.  Death  Leeds Parish Church, where Sarah Crosby was buried. On 24 October 1804, at the age of 75, Sarah Crosby died in Leeds. She was buried in a shared grave at Leeds Parish Churchyard with her colleagues Sarah Ryan, and later, Ann Tripp.  Legacy  One of the houses of the Methodist Girls' School in Ipoh, Malaysia was named after Crosby.

By 1931 the number of ORUD employees increased to 500. On 20 March 1932 the Council of People's Commissars released a statement \\"About the Centralized Accounting of the Accident Rate and Local Transport Accidents\\". Since then, the road accident statistics was officially calculated. The same year the first traffic lights and a position of a traffic guard were introduced in Moscow. The first highway patrol was formed in March 1933 and it consisted of 50 people. In 1936 the State Automobile Inspectorate, also known as GAI, was established. Among its responsibilities were the prevention of car theft, the recovery of stolen vehicles, calculation of transport properties, supervision over the drivers training, and calculating the overall numbers of motor vehicles. In 1961 ORUD was merged with GAI. The joint agency was called RUD-GAI (), which was later changed to simple \\"GAI\\" and in 1998 became the Main Directorate for Road Traffic Safety of Russia.

His diaries of this period provide details of his life amongst the bohemian writers and artist in New York including Frank Bellew, Sol Eytinge Jr., Fanny Fern, Thomas Nast, James Parton, Fitz James O'Brien, Alfred Waud and Walt Whitman. Early life The Gunn family had been farming for several generations in the Banbury, Oxfordshire area of England. Gunn's father, Samuel, (1785‚Äì1863) grew up on a farm but left to start a grocery business. In 1809, he married Sarah Arnold, and they had two daughters before Sarah died in 1815.Only one of these daughters survived to adulthood, she was Mary Anne who married Joseph Greatbatch, the grandson of William Greatbatch (1735‚Äì1813), a potter. The family later changed its surname to Bristol, the maiden name of Joseph's mother. In 1822, the widowed Samuel married Naomi Butler. Their son, Thomas Butler Gunn, born on February 15, 1826, the second of their six children. The family moved to John Street in the St. Pancras area of London in the 1830s.1841 UK census Gunn later recalled attending the sermons of controversial preacher James Harington Evans at the local John Street Baptist Chapel. The family next moved south of the river Thames to 10 Rodney Buildings, New Kent Road.1851 UK census During these early years, Gunn was articled to the architectural practise of Samuel Beazley in Soho Square and contributed illustrations to various publications. America Front fly- leaf of Thomas Butler Gunn Diaries: Volume 1, page 2, July 1849 In 1849, Gunn traveled to America from London on board the Bark Wenham with two cousins, Richard Gunn and George Bolton, arriving in New York on May 5.New York, Passenger and Immigration Lists, 1820‚Äì1850; Ancestry.com. Initially, Gunn stayed in New Jersey with Bolton while he tried to find work as an illustrator, later moving to Manhattan. His father provided some financial support during these early years, but Gunn became so short on funds that in 1850 he was forced to take a job as a draughtsman at an architect's practice. He continued to look for freelance work but this was often poorly paid. For example, illustrations he created for Appleton's, the publishers, took him five weeks to produce and he was only paid $12. He gradually obtained more work from periodicals such as New York Picayune, Pick, Diogenes hys Lanterne and others. The payments per illustration were still low, but by doing the rounds with his work, he began to establish a network of business and social contacts. In 1850, he drew and designed a graphic novel call Mose Among the Britishers or The B'hoy in London. It featured the popular character of a Bowery b'hoy, said to be the legendary Mose Humphrey, who was played on the stage by actor Frank Chanfrau. Return to England In 1854, Gunn returned to England to see his family and to propose to his childhood friend Hannah Bennett (c. 1828‚Äì1906). She accepted but the couple did not marry at this time and kept the arrangement secret from all but a few trusted friends. Gunn returned to New York in 1855 and the couple did not see each other until 1863, although they corresponded. Return to America Thomas Butler Gunn by his friend Sol Eytinge Jr., ca. 1856 Gunn gradually became more involved with writing and in 1857 published The Physiology of New York Boarding-houses, based on his personal experiences, with illustrations by his friends Frank Bellew (pen-name Triangle) and Alfred Waud. This concept of analysing normal life in literature began in Paris and had been used in the 1840s by Albert Richard Smith in Punch, with works such as Physiology of the London Medical Student and Physiology of London Evening Parties. In 1852, Gunn made acquaintance with Thomas Powell, who had been editing the Diogenes hys Lanterne (Lantern). Powell was an Englishman who knew many of the famous authors of the period, including Dickens, Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning. He started to sell autographs and works by these and others, but the authenticity was questioned. To avoid the risk of prosecution for fraud, Powell fled to America where he restarted his career. He had used some of Gunn's drawings while he was editing the Lantern, but he was always reluctant to pay for them. For this and other reasons, Gunn took a dislike to him, and some years later, wrote a satirical work on the life of Powell called Paul Gower, a Rationalistic Story of English and American Life. War correspondent In 1860, as the country moved towards civil war, Gunn was sent to Charleston, South Carolina as an artist-reporter by John Bigelow, editor of the New York Evening Post. A subterfuge was required to prevent Gunn being identified as a despised New York newspaperman, which could have resulted in him being tarred and feathered. He obtained a British passport so that he could say he was reporting for a London paper and then agreed with the editor in New York that his reports would be filed under the name of Edgar Bolton. Copies of some of the reports he sent back were pasted into his diaries; in one he predicts the attack on Fort Sumter. Gunn returned to New York on February 16, 1861 and the attack on the Fort started April 12. When the Civil War began, Gunn tried to get a posting as a war correspondent and was eventually engaged by Charles Anderson Dana of the New-York Tribune. In March 1862, he left New York for Alexandria, Virginia via Washington where he joined General Heintzelman's military camp. He reported on the battles of both Yorktown and Williamsburg. Gunn's editor Charles Dana had left the Tribune by April of that year and was replaced by Sydney Howard Gay. Gunn was submitting his reports late, and because of this, Gay was forced to copy stories out of the New York Herald, a rival newspaper. He wrote to Gunn explaining the situation and telling him to speed things up. The letter fell into the hands of a Herald journalist who promptly published it, much to the anger and embarrassment of the connections at the Tribune. Gunn finished his assignment in June 1862 and returned to New York. While away he learnt of the death of his friend and fellow writer Fitz James O'Brien, who had died from complication after being injured in a skirmish with Confederate troops. Shortly after his return, Gunn accepted another assignment from the Tribune, this time to Port Royal, South Carolina. He arrived at Hilton Head and traveled to Beaufort. His intention was to get to James Island where he had heard rumours that the Union forces were due to mount an attack. However, news came through of the defeat and setback for the Northern forces (see article Battle of Secessionville). Gunn visited the island soon after the battle and filed his report with the Tribune. A two-page copy also was pasted in his diary. Gun returned to New York in September 1862 after visiting Fort Pulaski, St. Augustine, and Key West. Gunn's last assignment for the Tribune as a war correspondent was with the forces of General Nathaniel Prentice Banks, who sailed to New Orleans from New York in December 1862 with 31,000 troops. Banks planned to attack Port Hudson and stationed his troops at New Orleans and Baton Rouge while preparations were made. Gunn, who had received letters from Hannah Bennett in England with news of his father, returned to New York in late March 1863 before the attack on Port Hudson took place. Return to England Gunn's father had been ill for many years but the end came in November 1863. By this time, Gunn was home with his family in England, and he was planning his marriage to Hannah Bennett, whose own father had died in 1862. They married on December 29, 1863 and lived in a village on the outskirts of Banbury called Wardington. Hannah gave birth to their only child on 5 November 1865, but the baby was stillborn. Gunn continued to write for newspapers with subjects often related to British history. These were well researched works and included series on local churches, villages, battles on English soil and individuals such as the highwayman Dick Turpin. Some of these articles were published in America. He also wrote verse and in 1885 his political poem, Hodge's Triumph, was published in the Banbury Guardian (24 December). This related to the changes in the voting system that allowed many more working class individuals to participate, and led to the Liberal party winning the election. The name Hodge was commonly used in 19th century Britain to stereotype agricultural labourers, often in derogatory terms. Gunn died in a hospital in Birmingham on April 7, 1904 and is buried in the Southam Road Cemetery, Banbury. His wife Hannah died on September 12, 1906, at age 78 and is buried in St Mary Magdalene Church in Wardington. Bohemians of New York Thomas Butler Gunn's name is associated with the bohemian set of writers and artist of New York who often frequented Pfaff's beer cellar. In Gunn's diaries, he mentions many of them and describes their lives, often in terms of gossip. His milieu included individuals such as Frank Bellew, Sol Eytinge Jr.,Fanny Fern, Thomas Nast, James Parton, Fitz James O'Brien, Alfred Waud and Walt Whitman. His diaries of this period have been transcribed by the Missouri History Museum.

From the time he joined the French Navy as a cadet at the √âcole Navale in 1849, until his retirement date in 1898, Besnard served 50 years in the French Navy. After graduating from the √âcole Navale in 1852, Besnard progressed rapidly in rank and commanded eight warships (frigates, light cruisers, heavy cruisers) between 1867 and 1892, in all parts of the world (Mediterranean, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, Indochina, China). He held a number of prestigious shore positions such as Navy Chief of Staff (1881), Head of Navy Personnel (1887‚Äì1889), Pr√©fet Maritime de Brest (1893).Vice-amiral Charles Touchard, Notice sur la carri√®re du Vice-amiral Besnard, Paris, Imprimerie E. Desfoss√©s, 1923, 10 p. After this long and distinguished career in the French Navy, Besnard served as , the French equivalent of First Lord of the Admiralty, between 1895 and 1898. In this position of , Besnard was responsible for the overall strategic direction of the French Navy. He directed naval support for the conquest of Madagascar (1895). He secured from Parliament the necessary credits to keep the fleets of the French Navy at operational strength and at immediate readiness. He won Parliament approval for setting up overseas Navy bases and strongpoints in many parts of the world: in particular the arsenal of Bizerte (Tunisia). During Besnard's time as , there are two schools of thought: the young school - Jeune √âcole - is in favor of a fleet with a lot of light units such as torpedo boats. The opposite theory emphasizes that sea power is based on the large ships which decide battles, such as battleships and cruisers. Besnard was clearly in favor of the latter theory. Speaking on the occasion of budget debates at the French Parliament between 1895 and 1898, Admiral Besnard pushed forward naval armaments programs in which battleships and cruisers represented over 80% of total funds. He confined torpedo boats to their normal role in coast defense. ReferencesSources 1\\\\. Vice-amiral Charles Touchard, Notice sur la carri√®re du Vice-amiral Besnard, Paris, Imprimerie E.

Wesley purchased the building's lease for ¬£115, then spent a further ¬£700‚Äì¬£800 on refurbishment costs, creating a chapel able to accommodate 1,500 people, plus a smaller meeting room.

Some tents belong to the local breweries. The setup work for the tents often begins three months before the start of the festival.  Big marquees = Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt  Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt The Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt (crossbow firing tent) has been around since 1895. It has 5,830 indoor and 1,620 outdoor seats. Festwirt (tent operator) is Peter Inselkammer, brother of the owner of the Ayinger Brewery. What is poured however, come from the Paulaner Brewery, since only beer from Munich breweries is served at the Oktoberfest. The German Championship for crossbow, 30m national discipline, takes place traditionally every year in the Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt.  Augustiner-Br√§u  Augustiner Br√§u The Augustiner brewery is the only Munich brewery that still delivers the beer in wooden barrels to the Oktoberfest. The tent has 6000 indoor and 2500 outdoor seats. The tent operators are Manfred and Thomas Vollmer, who also operate two large Augustiner restaurants in Munich (Landsberger Stra√üe and Neuhauser Stra√üe).  Br√§urosl / Pschorrbr√§u-Festhalle  Br√§urosl Tent The Br√§urosl is the tent of the host family Heide, who also runs the large restaurant Heide-Volm in Planegg near Munich. This tent traditionally holds the \\"Gay Sunday\\" (\\"Rosa Weisn\\") every year on the first Sunday of the Oktoberfest, which emerged from a club event of the MLC (M√ºnchner L√∂wen Club). Landmarks of the Br√§urosl tent are two almost 20-meter-high Maib√§ume (Maypoles) placed at the front of the tent. In 2004 a new tent was opened with 6,000 indoor seats and 2,500 outdoor seats. In 2010, the Br√§urosl tent had 6,200 indoor seats and 2,200 outdoor seats. Hacker-Pschorr beer is served there.  Fischer-Vroni  The Fischer- Vroni - among the 14 large tents at the Oktoberfest is one of the smallest - received a new tent in 2006 with side galleries, which another gallery above the main entrance was added in 2011 and in 2013 expanded to include a wooden barrel stock. It has 3080 indoor and 700 outdoor seats. Like the Augustiner tents, here Augustiner beer is served on tap. Specialties here are the Steckerlfisch, a grilled spit fish. For several years now on second festival Monday it has come to tradition that the gays and lesbians \\"occupy\\" the tent. This tradition goes back to the now deceased gay host of the Prosecco bar who simply reserved some tables for his guests, and many other gays and lesbians joined in. Meanwhile, this tradition is so well known, that guests need to come early in order to be able to get a place to join the celebration.  Hacker-Tent  Hacker-Tent The 90.5 √ó 43 meter Hacker-Tent offers indoor seating for 6,950 people, and another 2,350 outdoor seats. The tent was redesigned in 2004 by Rolf Zehetbauer in order to fit in with the advertising slogan of the Hacker brewery, \\"Himmel der Bayern\\" (Heaven of the Bavarians), in which the tent interior ceiling was elaborately decorated. In addition, a 5x5 meter opening was installed in the beer tent ceiling, to which the operator called a ‚ÄúConvertible roof‚Äù. The revolving stage located inside the tent was also renewed. The Schlager group Die Kirchdorfer have been playing there since 1994 as the official festival band daily from noon until 22:30. As a show act, the Munich party band \\"Cagey Strings\\" plays daily from 19:00 till 20:30. The \\"Festwirt\\" (Festival Manager) from the Hacker-tent is Toni Roiderer, spokesmen for the festival hosts and innkeeper in Stra√ülach.  Hippodrom  Hippodrom The Hippodrom was first erected at the Oktoberfest by Carl Gabriel in 1902 as a snack and show booth. Until the 1980s, special features in the tent was a horse riding track, a hippodrome, where visitors could ride. During this time a barker stood outside. In the Hippodrom, beer from the Spaten-Franziskaner Brewery was served. It was located right next to the main entrance of the Oktoberfest. Festwirt (Festival Manager) was Sepp Kr√§tz, from 1995 till 2013, a tenant of the Waldwirtschaft in Gro√ühesselohe. The concession was taken from him following a conviction of tax evasion. The succeeding tent was the Marstall. Bands played regularly in the Hippodrom. There were 3,300 seats in the tent and 1,000 outside. The Schlager group \\"M√ºnchner Zwietracht\\" (Munich Discord) played for more than ten years every evening at the Hippodrome. Linda Jo Rizzo was presented as a \\"star guest\\".  Marstall  Marstall The Marstall took over the place of the Hippodrom as of the Oktoberfest 2014. The host of the tent is the Able family. The Marstall offers 3200 seats. Another 1100 people find room in the beer garden and at the bar. Providing brewery, as by the predecessor Hippodrom, is the Spaten- Franziskaner brewery. Even musically the Marstall follows in the tradition of the Hippodrom, with performances from the \\"M√ºnchner Zweitracht\\" and \\"Die Oberbayern\\", along with others.  Hofbr√§u tent  Hofbr√§u festival tent The Hofbr√§u tent is, with a total of almost 10,000 seats, the largest beer tent at the Oktoberfest (6,018 seats and 1,000 standing places indoors, and an additional 3,022 seats outdoor). It has been under the leadership of the Steinberg family since the 1980s, to which is also the tenant of the Hofbr√§uhaus cellar's since 1995. Under the leadership of the family, significant structural change were carried out in the tent. The only standing area with 1,000 places can be found in the Hofbr√§u-festival tent. In the tent, 12 quintal hop vines, the harvest an entire hop filed, are hung as decoration. The tent is erected on an area of over 7,000 m¬≤. In the almost two weeks of the festival, more than 782,400 liters of beer, 70,700 BBQ chicken halves, 4,200 pork hocks and 6,200 pork sausage servings are consumed. In 2005 the tent was extended a bit, and was given a new fa√ßade. Because of the world- famous Hofbr√§uhaus, it is by far the most popular tent for tourists and many celebrities.  K√§fer Wiesn Sch√§nke  The K√§fer Wiesn Sch√§nke festival pub, which first made its appearance in 1971, is one of the smaller companies at the Oktoberfest. The festival pub is not a tent, but a large log house, constructed in the style of a Bavarian farm. The house offers enough space for 1,400 guests, with an additional 1,900 seats located outside.[16] As a branch from Feinkost K√§fer, unlike the other tents, here special dishes are offered. Often encounters with celebrity athletes, actors, and other famous people occur in the pub. Service in the K√§fer-Sch√§nke ends at 0:30 at night (other tents end at 22:30); wine and champagne is also served here.  L√∂wenbr√§u tent  L√∂wenbr√§u tent A notable aspect of this tent, with 8,500 seats both inside and out, is the L√∂wenbr√§u tower with a movable lion who used to speak with help from a recording. The tent sky is lit up by 16,000 light bulbs. Since 1989, the Ladies Wiesn takes place inside the L√∂wenbrau tent, and is a meeting place for female celebrities. Initiator is the millionaire Regine Sixt, wife of Erich Sixt It is the world's first beer tent with an ISO 9001 certificate. The managers are Christa Ludwig Hagn and Stephanie Spendler.  Ochsenbraterei  In the Ochsenbraterei (German for ox rotisserie) tent, Spaten beer is served. In September 1881, butcher Johann R√∂ssler, had the first roasted ox on a skewer at the Oktoberfest and offered it in a snack venue. The business had to stop in 1882, since he was unable to serve beer. Starting in 1898, he was able to reopen his Ochsenbraterei. In 1901 his 200th ox was roasted. The tent has a floor area of 4,200 m¬≤, offering 5950 seats (to which 1660 seats are in the pit); next to which is a self serve area covering a total of 1700 m¬≤ and includes 1600 seats. The tent has 5 serving areas where beer is served on tap. The current tent was manufactured in 1980; set up takes 10 weeks, and disassembly takes 5 weeks.  Schottenhamel  Main entrance to the Schottenhamel tent The history of the tent as a gastronomical facility dates back to 1867, when the Schottenhamel was a shack behind the Kings Royal tent. Today's festival managers are Michael F. and Christian Schottenhammel. The tent exists since 1953 and has an area of 4,800 m¬≤ with 6,000 seats and two galleries. 4,000 Seats are located outdoors in an area of 2,200 m¬≤. The first tapping of the keg, by the Munich mayor, every Oktoberfest is held in the Schottenhamel tent. The tent is traditionally the home for the Munich student organizations, which can be seen also on the coat of arms with a compass located on the one the tent side walls. The crowds here are mostly young. In the Schottenhamel tent, Spaten Beer is also served. A special feature is the attire of the female waitresses; classic waitress aprons and caps (instead of a Dirndl). The benches in Schottenhammel are shorter and placed around the square tables. The Schottenhammel is nicknamed \\"The tent of youth\\".  Sch√ºtzen Festzelt  Sch√ºtzen Festzelt The Sch√ºtzen Festzelt belongs to the smaller beer tents, with its 5,361 seats (approximately 4,300 inside and approximately 1,090 outside). Judging by the ground coverage, it is the biggest tent of the Oktoberfest. It is located next to the Bavaria and therefore away from the big 'Bierstra√üe' (Beer Street). Many tourists overlook the tent, since the entrance is not that of a typical beer tent. The audience here on average used to be older, and the atmosphere more cozy that in the other tent. Due to the evening performances from \\"Die Niederalmer\\", which play Rock and Pop, the mood in the tent has changed, and the audience in the recent years has become younger. The Sch√ºtzen tent is located next to the Hacker tent and the Schottenhamel tent, creating a meeting point for the youth of Munich. One of the oldest tents at the Oktoberfest, it has a special feature: in 110 shooting range spots, the Oktoberfest-Landesschie√üen of marksmen takes place. The tent is also famous for its geranium balcony. The innkeepers are Claudia and Eduard Reinbold. The specialty of the tent is malt beer marinated roasted pig.  Weinzelt  In the Weinzelt (Wine Tent) of Roland, Doris and Stephan Kuffler, white beer is served until 21:00, after which the alcoholic beverages only include wine, sparkling wine, and champagne. The tent has been operating since 1984, with a total of 2,500 seats, and is one of the smaller tents at the Oktoberfest. In 2005, the wine tent was completely redesigned, and is rebuilt every year. The old tent was auctioned off in October 2006 on eBay. Paulaner brewery is the supplier for the tent, as well as various Vinyards and the Nymphenburg Sektkellerei (Champagne Cellar). Special feature of the tent: open until 1 am. The other tents (except the K√§fer tent) stop serving at 2230.  Winzerer F√§hndl - Paulaner festival hall  Winzerer F√§hndl The Winzerer F√§hndl can be seen from afar, with its large tower with a rotating Paulaner beer mug on top. The name \\"Winzerer F√§hndl\\" for the Paulaner festival hall comes from the time, where the crossbow shooting club, which carried the same name, had its headquarters there and even fired their crossbows in the tent. Later, the crossbowmen moved to the then new Armbrustsch√ºtzenzelt. The name of the guild - Winzerer F√§hndl ‚Äì remained the name of the Paulaner festival hall with its 8,450 indoor seats and 2,450 seats in the garden. In 2010, the old tent was replaced by a self-supporting structure, which has no support columns inside the tent. Hosts are Peter and Arabella Pongratz.  Smaller festival tents  In addition to the 15 large tents found at the Oktoberfest, there are also the smaller tents, which are mainly the rotisserie chicken stands like Wienerwald, Cafe Kaiserschmarrn (Rischart), Vinzenz Murr, Poschners, Heimer, Cafe Mohrenkopf, Bodos caf√© tent, the Inn in Schichtl and the Ammer chicken and canard rotisserie that, since 2000, only sells organic products.

Built about 1820, it is a well-preserved Federal period tavern building, now converted to private residential use. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Falmouth House is located in a rural part of northern Falmouth, on the east side of Gray Road (Maine State Route 100), which was historically the main 19th century route between Portland and the growing cities of Auburn and Lewiston. The main block of the house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. It is oriented facing south, with a symmetrical facade whose first floor is now obscured by a hip-roofed enclosed porch. Its historic main entrance, located on this facade, is flanked by Federal style pilasters and topped by a pediment. A historically secondary entrance, on the building's west side, now acts as the main entrance, and is sheltered by an early 20th- century arched portico, supported by two round columns. A period ell extends to the north of the main block. The tavern was built in 1820 by Samuel Hicks, to serve travelers on the primary route northeast from Portland. It was moved early in its lifetime with the present Gray Road was opened, and served travelers on that route until the advent of the automobile reduced demand. It was owned for much of the 19th century by members of the Washburn family, and was known as the Washburn Tavern or Washburn Inn. The upper floor of the ell retains its original hostelry room layout.

Tye (born c. 1981) is an American neuroscientist and professor and Wylie Vale Chair in the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences. Her research has focused on using optogenetics to identify connections in the brain that are involved in innate emotion, motivation and social behaviors. Early life and education Tye was raised in Ithaca, New York, where both of her parents worked at Cornell University. Her parents Henry Tye and Bik Kwoon Tye had emigrated from Hong Kong. As a child, Tye worked in her mother's laboratory organizing pipette tips. She completed a Bachelor of Science with a major in cognitive science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) from 1999 to 2003. After graduating, she spent time learning breakdancing and backpacked around Australia for a year before returning to the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), to begin her graduate studies in neuroscience. She joined the laboratory of neurobiologist Patricia Janak where she completed her thesis showing that neuronal activity was increased in a region of the brain associated with processing of emotions, called the amygdala, in rats learning to associate a stimulus with a reward. Her thesis work was published in Nature and won the Donald B. Lindsley Prize in Behavioral Neuroscience and the Harold M. Weintraub Graduate Student Award. Tye received her PhD in 2008.  Career and research  From 2008 to 2009, Tye worked as a post-doctoral research fellow at the UCSF Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center and then at Stanford University from 2009 to 2011. At Stanford, she was mentored by Karl Deisseroth in optogenetics, a technique that uses light to activate or inhibit specific neurons. Tye returned to MIT in 2012 as an assistant professor at the university's Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. Her research has focused on answering questions on how the same neural mechanism in the amygdala of the brain can regulate such different behavioral responses to negative and positive environmental cues. Using optogenetics to control neurons by modulating how they transmit signals in the brain, her work seeks to determine whether there are different neuronal networks in the amygdala that communicate with either the fear or reward circuits of the brain. Through this research, Tye and colleagues were able to identify distinct populations of neurons that have different functions, morphology and genetics and were able to confirm that these differences are associated with separate roles in processing information that leads to either positive or negative reinforcement. Her work has contributed to the understanding of social behaviors such as reward-seeking and anxiety, and provided insights into the basis of psychiatric diseases. Her work has also looked at alcoholism and brain circuitry, where Tye led a team of researchers to identify how the brain is altered in mice that predicted increased levels of compulsive drinking. The work is suggested to lead to understanding as to why some people become addicted to alcohol, while others do not. Tye received the NIH Director's New Innovator Award in 2013 and the NARSAD Young Investigator Award in 2014. In 2014, she was named one of MIT Technology Review TR35 top innovators under the age 35 for her use of optogenetics in identifying neural circuits involved in anxiety and social interaction. In November, 2019, Dr. Tye gave a TED Talk at the National Academy of Sciences titled \\"What Investigating Neural Pathways Can Reveal About Mental Health\\".

The nation is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and the crop has been given a principal status in the country. Cotton is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the Kharif period, and is grown at a smaller scale between February and April. Record production of cotton was reported at 15 million bales of each in the form of phutti (seed cotton) during 2014‚Äì15, which was an 11% rise compared to the previous season (2013‚Äì14). Production- wise, as of 2012‚Äì13, Pakistan occupied the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world, the first three being China, India and the United States, in that order. In respect of exports of raw cotton, Pakistan holds third position, and is the fourth in consumption (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn. History Earliest period of Cotton production The earliest known historical traces of cotton were found at Mehrgarh near the city of Quetta, making Pakistan one of the first regions of cotton cultivation. Cotton was discovered in threads on a copper bead at a burial site dated to the Neolithic period (6000 BC). The mineralised threads were subject to metallurgical analysis with a combination of a reflected-light microscope and a scanning electron microscope, revealing that they were of cotton (genus Gossypium). Cotton cultivation became more widespread during the Indus Valley Civilisation, which covered parts of present day eastern Pakistan and northwestern India.Stein, Burton (1998). A History of India. Blackwell Publishing. , p. 47 Archaeobotanical evidence of seeds has been traced to 5000 BC in Mehrgarh, though it is not clear if they belonged to a wild or cultivated variety. Use of cotton cloth in the Indus Valley cities of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa dates to 2,500 BC. Cotton pollen has been recorded at Balakot. At Harappa (Mature Harappan period 2500-2000 BC), evidence of cotton threads has been found tied to the handle of a mirror, an antiquity from a female burial site, and around a copper razor. There is also much other evidence of cotton in some form, such as Malavaceae (flowering plant) pollen type, similar to Gossypium in Balakot (Mature Harappan period, 2500‚Äì2000 BC); as seeds at Banawali (Mature Harappan, 2200‚Äì1900 BC), Sanghol (Late Harappan, 1900‚Äì1400 BC), Kanmer, Kacchh (Late Harappan, 2,000‚Äì1,700 BC), Imlidhi Khurd and Gorakhpur (1300‚Äì800 BC); as fibres in Late Ochre-Coloured Pottery at Sringaverapura (1200‚Äì700 BC); and in Hallur as seeds and fragments of the Early Iron Age (950‚Äì900 BC). Growing regions  Cotton is purely a cellulose fibre crop, one of the four major crops in the country, and is known by popular epithets as \\"King cotton\\" and \\"white gold\\". It forms the primary input for the textile industry of Pakistan. Cotton is integral to Pakistan's economy. According to an analysis in the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, it is grown as an industrial crop in 15% of the nation's land. It is grown during the monsoon months of May to August, known as the kharif period. It is also grown on a smaller scale between February and April. Cotton is grown mostly in the two provinces of Punjab and Sindh, with the former accounting for 79% and the latter for 20% of the nation's cotton growing land. It is also grown in Khyber Pakhtoon Khawah (KPK) and Balochistan provinces. The total land area of cotton cultivation was reported as during the 2014‚Äì15 growing season. Generally, small farmers with land holdings less than in size form the largest group of growers; farmers holding less than account for 50% of the farms. Land holdings with under cotton cultivation form less than 2% of farms. According to a 2013 estimate, there were 1.6 million farmers (out of a total of 5 million in all sectors) engaged in cotton farming, growing more than 3 million hectares. Varieties Farmers have widely adopted Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton since its first trial in Sindh province in 2002. It is now used in 95% of the area. The Punjab Seed Council has approved the use of 18 Bt cotton and non-Bt varieties for cultivation. These are: 12 BT varieties FH-114, CIM-598, SITARA-009, A-one, BH-167, MIAD-852, CIM-573, SLH-317, TARZAN-1, NS-141, IR-NIBGE-3, MNH-886, and six non-BT varieties NIBGE ‚àí115, FH-941, FH-942, IR-1524, Ali Akbar-802 and NEELAM-121. In Sindh province, local Sindh varieties of cotton are also grown in about 40% of the area. They are generally planted from April to July, and harvested during August‚ÄìDecember. Production Cotton serves as the base for the nation's industrial sector. Production of cotton was reported at a record high of 15 million bales of 470 lbs each in the form of phutti (seed cotton) during 2014‚Äì15; this was an 11% increase compared to the previous season (2013‚Äì14). Its phenomenal growth was from 1.38 million bales in 1961 to 11.138 million bales in 2014, with the estimated 2014‚Äì15 figures showing a further increase to 15 million bales. Between 1980‚Äì81 and 1990‚Äì91, the growth in production was rapid, with production rising from 0.70 million to 2.2 million tonnes, which was called the \\"magic year\\" of Pakistan's cotton industry. This was attributed to better pest control measures, use of improved seed types and increased use of fertilisers. The cotton and textile industries are integrated and account for 1,000 ginneries, 425 textile mills, and 300 cottonseed crushers and oil refiners. Cotton hybrids, created by crossing the Bt gene into traditional varieties, have been developed by local firms dealing with seeds. In Sindh province cotton is grown in more than one million acres in the districts of Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Mirpur Khas, Naushero Feroz, Sanghar, Badin, Sukkar, Ghotki, Tharparkar, Thatta and Umar Kot. In terms of production, Pakistan is at the fourth position among the cotton growers of the world; the first three are China, India and the United States, in that order Raw cotton exported from Pakistan holds third position in the world as per records of 2012‚Äì13. Consumption-wise it holds the fourth position (about 30 and 40 per cent of its production). It is the largest exporter of cotton yarn. Cotton produced within the country is of medium staple. Hence long staple cotton is imported to produce quality fabrics for export. Medium staple cotton, also called standard medium-staple cotton is American Upland type with staple length varying from about . Long-staple cottons have relatively longer fibre, are expensive and used mostly to make fine fabrics, yarns, and hosiery. The country's economic development is largely dependent on the cotton industry and its related textile sector, and this has given a principal status to cotton in the country. Apart from use in textiles in the form of cotton lint, yarn, thread, cloth, and garments, its seeds are used for oil extraction. Diseases Viruses and pests affect yield of Bt cotton varieties. Cotton leaf curl virus, which is a plant pathogenic virus of the family Geminiviridae, stunts plant growth seriously affecting yield. Pests like White Fly, Mealy Bugs, Aphids, Pink Boll Worm infect the plants reducing yield. Exports 474,091 bales of 470 lbs each were exported during the 2014‚Äì15 season, an increase from 382,006 bales in 2014‚Äì15. The cotton and textile industries play a dominant role in exports; cotton accounts for 55 percent of country's export earnings, and Pakistan has a 14% share of the world's cloth exports. The European Union (EU) granted Generalized System of Preferences \\"Plus\\" status to Pakistan in 2013, which has promoted textile exports to the EU. Legal framework Though a bio-safety regulatory system was part of the 18th Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan that \\"devolved\\" several functions to the provinces, the system is still unclear with regard to regulators who can oversee the approval of new seed technologies. In this context the three regulatory acts which are under approval stage are the Plant Breeders‚Äô Rights Act, Amendments to the 1976 Seed Act, and the Biosafety Law. According to the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service report of 2015, passage of these laws is crucial to the introduction of new biotech events.

It is the royal mosque of the Surakarta Sunanate. History The Great Mosque of the Kraton of Surakarta. The Great Mosque of Surakarta was built by Sunan Pakubuwono III in 1763. The mosque was completed in 1768. The mosque was both a jami mosque (mosque for Friday prayer) and royal mosque (mosque for ceremonies or rituals related with the royal). Traditionally, the mosque also served as a judiciary in matters of religious significance. The fence was added for the mosque complex in 1858 during the reign of Sunan Pakubuwono VIII. A Mughal architecture-inspired minaret was built in 1928 during the reign of Sunan Pakubuwono XI. The mosque The interior of Great Mosque of Surakarta Surakarta Great Mosque is located within a 19,180 sqm complex surrounded by a solid wall. The design of the Great Mosque of Surakarta follows a conservative Javanese architecture principle. It basically consists of two buildings: the main prayer hall and the front hall (serambi). The main prayer hall has seven doors connecting it with the serambi. Four main posts (Javanese soko guru) supported the roof of the main prayer hall. This roof is a pyramidal tajug-styled roof, a type of roof traditionally reserved for sacred buildings in Javanese architectural principle. The roof is three-tiered, topped with a mustaka (rooftop ornament). As a royal mosque, there is a maksura to the left of the mihrab. A maksura is a place for the ruler of the kraton to perform prayer. In case of the Great Mosque of Surakarta, the maksura has a small hip roof. In front of the main prayer hall is the front hall, known as the serambi. The serambi is basically a porch-like structure semi-attached to the front facade of the main prayer hall. The serambi kept two bedugs (Javanese drum to call prayer) and a large wooden kentongan. Another porch-like semi-attached building flanked the main prayer hall to its left and right, this is called the pawestren. The pawestren is used as women's praying room. The minaret was located to the northeast of the mosque. The design is based on Qutb Minar of Delhi. The vicinity Following the traditional Javanese city planning, the mosque is located facing the northern alun-alun of the kraton of the Kasunanan of Surakarta. To the south of the mosque is the Pasar Klewer (\\"Klewer Market\\"). The traditional kampung of Kauman, known for its batik craftsmanship, is located north of the Great Mosque.

Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Divya Prabandha, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Azhwar saints from the 6th‚Äì9th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 Divyadesam dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Azhagiyasingar and his consort Lakshmi as Poornavalli. A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all its shrines. The temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas, with later additions by the Vijayanagar and Thanjavur Nayak kings during the 16th century. Azhagiyasingar is believed to have appeared to Thirumangai Azhwar at this place. The legend of the temple is closely associated with Thirunagari temple. The temple follows Thenkalai tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the Thirumangai Azhwar Utsavam during Thai being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend Image of Narasimha slaying Hiranyakasipu, Prahlada is also seen praying As per Hindu legend, a son of Brahma named Karthama Prajapathi did penance worshipping Vishnu to attain Moksha. Vishnu was not pleased and Lakshmi, his consort, wanted to give Moksha to him immediately. During Kali Yuga, Karthama was born as prince named Sangabalan. During his young age, he wanted to marry Kumudavalli, who was an ardent devotee of Vishnu. She stipulated that she would marry him only if he feeds thousand devotees of Vishnu. Sangabalan started feeding the devotees and at one point, when he was short of money, resorted to burglary. Vishnu came with Lakshmi incognito and Sangabalan tried to rob them as well. Vishnu uttered the Ashtatra Mantra in his ears and he turned into Thirumangai Azhwar. It is believed that Thirumangai Azhwar worshipped five Narasimhars including this one. The temple is also called Lakshmi Narasimha Kshetram and Vayalali Manavalan temple. Another variant states that the Vishnu directed his wife Lakshmi to be born as the daughter of sage Purna so that he can grace both her and Thirumangai Azhwar together. As per another legend, Vishnu took the avatar of Narasimha to slay the demon king Hiryankasipu. Hiranyakasipu was troubling the Devas as he got a boon from Brahma that no human can kill him. His son Prahlada was an ardent devotee of Vishnu, against the likes of his father. Hiranyakasipu tried to slay Prahlada by various means, but was saved by the divine grace of Vishnu. Vishnu took the avatar of Narasimha and appeared from a pillar. Narasimha was a human with lion face and slayed Hiranyakasipu on an evening time in a doorway, which was neither land nor air. His anger was not quenched even after slaying the demon king and Lakshmi came and sat on his lap, after which he calmed down. It is believed that since Narasimha did an aalinganam (meaning hug), the place came to be known as Thiruvali. The uniqueness of this temple is that Lakshmi is seen sitting in right side of Narasimmar which is very rare to have darshan as in most temples Lakshmi is seen in left side of swamy Narasimmar. Ahishekam in swathy star day gives very good blessings of the divine couple. History and literary mention thumb The exact history of the temple could not be ascertained. It is believed to have been built by the Cholas, with later additions by the Vijayanagar and Thanjavur Nayak kings. Azhagiyasingar temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabhandam, the 7th‚Äì9th century Vaishnava canon, by Kulasekara Azhwar and Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple is classified as a Divyadesam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. The songs of the Azhwars refer both this temple and the Thirunagari temple and hence both are counted as one Divya Desam. During the 18th and 19th centuries, the temple is mentioned in 108 Tirupathi Anthathi by Divya Kavi Pillai Perumal Aiyangar. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu. The temple is the capital of Thirumangai Azhwar, who was the ruler of a kingdom and also the birthplace of Kumudavalli, the wife of Azhwar. Architecture Azhagiyasingar temple covers an area of about . The temple in enclosed in a rectangular enclosure with surrounded by granite walls. The central houses the image of the presiding deity, Azhagiyasingar. The image is made of granite is sported in sitting posture, with Lakshmi seated on his lap on the right side. This posture is unique as usually the image of Lakshmi on Narasimhar temples are sculpted on the left side. The festival deity is named Thiruvali Nagaralan and the image is also housed in the sanctum. A south facing shrine of Thirumangai Azhwar is located outside the temple walls, opposite to the Garuda Mandapam. It is believed that the image of Narasimhar in the temple are among the five original images of Narasimha worshipped by Thirumangai Azhwar. The temple mast, the shrine of Garuda and a four pillared hall are located axial to the sanctum, outside the compound wall. Religious practises and festival The temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect and follows Vaikasana aagama. The temple is open from 7:30-11:30 am and between 4-7:30 pm. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Sayatrakshai at 7:30 p.m. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.

The festive image of Thirumangai Azhwar is brought on a Hamsa Vahanam (palanquin) from Thirunagari and his paasurams (verses) dedicated to each of these eleven temples are recited during the occasion. The festival images of Thirumangai Alvar and his consort Kumudavalli Naachiyar are taken in the palanquin to each of the eleven temples and the verses dedicated to the temples are chanted in the respective shrines.

Biography Una Ryan was born in Ireland in 1966 and completed her undergraduate work in zoology at University College Dublin in 1988. The following year, she moved to Australia and began working at Murdoch University. Ryan continued her studies earning her PhD in 1996 in parasitology, with a specialisation in on protozoan parasites. Her research has analysed the transmission and epidemiology of infectious disease parasites, initially focused on Cryptosporidium, a protozoan parasite which causes diarrhoea and in severe cases can result in death. Cryptosporidium and Giardia are the two most prevalent parasites causing public health risk from water utilities in developed nations, due to contamination of water catchment areas by livestock. Ryan developed a test to verify if the parasites are present in water samples and if they are present, whether they are one of the two types that are harmful to humans. She filed a worldwide patent on her DNA method of diagnosing Cryptosporidium and was awarded a Frank Fenner Prize for Life Scientist of the Year, one of the Minister's Prizes and highest award given by the Prime Minister of Australia to recognise scientists' contributions. Her work has continued and expanded to include research on Giardia, Neospora and piroplasms and she has received grants from the Australian Research Council as well as other organisations to evaluate parasitic impact on the water supply and public health. In one study, her primary results showed that sheep, though they contribute to water contamination, are not a significant contributor to parasites which affect humans.

Standing on the alun-alun of Sumenep, it is the largest mosque in Madura Island and a noted landmark of Madura. History Previously known as the Panembahan Somala Jami Mosque after the 31st adipati (\\"duke\\") of Sumenep who established the mosque, construction of the mosque started in 1779 and was completed in 1787. The mosque was built as part of the kraton complex of Sumenep. The Great Mosque of Sumenep is the second mosque of the new kraton complex, replacing the earlier mosque masjid laju (Madurese \\"old mosque\\"), whose construction was initiated by Kanjeng R. Tumenggung Ario Anggadipa, 21st ruler of Sumenep, and was completed in 1757. Architecture The architect of the mosque is Lauw Pia Ngo, one of the early generation of Chinese people who took residence in Madura. He also designed the Sumenep kraton, which was completed earlier in 1764. The overall impression of the mosque is of eclectic influence, a mixture of Chinese, local Javanese, and western style; typical of the cities on the north of Java. The Great Mosque of Sumenep features a three-tiered roof, a typical style in the mosque architecture of Indonesia. This main roof is topped with a kemuncak decoration, featuring three spheres. This main roof is surrounded by six sets of smaller two-tiered roofs to the south, east, and north of the main prayer hall. A white brick wall enclosed the interior space of the mosque. The tall windows and main door, reminiscent of Dutch colonial architecture style, are painted in bold color instead, a characteristic Chinese style. The mosque complex is surrounded by iron fence, although in the past this was massive wall instead, completely separating the enclosed inner space of the mosque complex with the outside world. To the southeast and northeast of the perimeter are two small pavilions with rounded cupola, flanking the eastern perimeter of the mosque complex. These small pavilions were used as prisons. The most distinctive feature of the mosque is its main gateway. It features an eclectic design, mixture of Chinese and Javanese influence. The main gate is topped with a platform on its first floor, this can be accessed via two flight of staircases on the left and right of the main gate. A bedug is hanged in the space above the gateway's portal. This bedug originally belongs to masjid laju.

The process is scalable and very effective. Whenever you make a purchase using either a debit or credit card the transaction is rounded up to the next decimal. This original proof of concept was developed back 1999 when Wiremite Inc., a digital wallet company, was expanding the services available for the new smart terminal being introduced in retail outlets as well as online purchases. The charitable component was made possible due to the almost cost-free nature of the transaction and the bundling of the services available on a terminal. There have been numerous articles on this process.

The Battle of Gari River, better known as the Battle of Rapido River, one of the bloodiest battles of the Italian Campaign of World War II occurred in 1944, along its banks. The river origins from a spring in the center of Cassino, in Piazza Corte, at the foot of Montecassino. It flows underground and reappears in the Villa Comunale, the main public park in the town. In the thermal area known as Varronian Thermal Baths, it increases its discharge considerably from several springs, as well as from the river Rapido. In Sant'Apollinare, few miles south of Cassino, it joins the Liri to form the Garigliano river, which marks the border between Lazio and Campania. The battle The Gari river (erroneously identified as the Rapido) was the site of a bloodily repulsed and ill-conceived assault during the Italian Campaign of World War II by the U.S. 36th Infantry Division, led by Major General Fred Walker from 20‚Äì22 January 1944 when the Allies were attempting to establish a bridgehead in the vicinity of Sant'Angelo in Thoedice (a frazione of Cassino) to launch attacks on the Gustav Line near Monte Cassino. The assault was opposed by two battalions from the German 15th Panzer Grenadier Division under General-Lieutenant Rudolf Sperl. American troops suffered over 2,000 casualties in the failed assault. On 20 January 1946, the US 36th Division Veteran's Association unanimously called for a Congressional inquiry into General Mark Clark's actions during the 36th Infantry Division's disastrous crossing of the Rapido River on the night of 20 January 1944. The petition read: \\"Be it resolved, that the men of the 36th Division Association petition the Congress of the United States to investigate the river Rapido fiasco and take the necessary steps to correct a military system that will permit an inefficient and inexperienced officer, such a General Mark W.

It is the largest mosque in West Sumatra, and the second largest mosque in Sumatra. It is located in Padang Utara Subdistrict, Padang, West Sumatra. The Grand Mosque of West Sumatra is located within a complex of 40,343 square meter on the intersection of Jalan Khatib Sulaiman and Jalan Ahmad Dahlan. Construction The first stone of the construction was laid on December 21, 2007, inaugurated by the Governor of West Sumatra Province Gamawan Fauzi. Construction took a long time because of budget issues. Apart from relying on the West Sumatra's regional government budget, other strategies were used to collect funding, such as relying on donation from the people, from the private sectors, as well as from foreign governments. In 2009 The government of Saudi Arabia funded 50 million US dollars for the construction of the mosque, however this came at the same time as the 2009 West Sumatra earthquakes, so the funding was relocated for rehabilitation of the earthquake victims and reconstruction process of West Sumatra instead. In 2014, the Turkish government donated rugs for the mosque. Prayers were held in the mosque for the first time on February 7, 2014. Architecture The mosque was designed by local architect Rizal Muslimin, selected as the winner of the 2007 competition for a new mosque in West Sumatra. The competition had 323 participants from around the world. The most distinctive feature of the mosque is its roof form, a contemporary interpretation of the traditional roof of the Minangkabau vernacular houses. The shape of the roof is also meant to symbolize the cloth that was held by its corners by the four clan leaders of the Quraysh tribe to lift the Black Stone to the current spot in Mecca. The roof frame is constructed of steel pipes, supported by four curving concrete columns. The main building consists of three floors. The main prayer hall is located on the second floor. The mosque is able to accommodate 20,000 people.

Fisher was born in London; his mother was English, and his father was Hungarian. He was privately educated in London and Paris, then worked in journalism and banking in Paris before moving to Manchester, again to work in journalism. Although he was not a pacifist, he was strongly opposed to the Second Boer War, and this led him to become interested in socialism. He became secretary of the National Democratic League and joined the Fabian Society, and then the Marxist Social Democratic Federation (SDF).Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.304 The SDF became the British Socialist Party (BSP), and Fisher initially became a member. However, he was upset that it would not support his proposals of a citizen army and expansion of the Royal Navy, and became an informant to MI5. In 1915, he led a right-wing split, the Socialist National Defence Committee.Richard Temple, \\"Inkpin, Albert Samuel\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIV, pp.180‚Äì188 This attracted some prominent members, including H. G. Wells and Robert Blatchford. The following year, a group around the leadership of the BSP formed the new National Socialist Party, which attracted some Defence Committee members. Fisher instead refounded Defence Committee as the British Workers League, which at its peak included fifteen Labour Party Members of Parliament. Fisher worked with George Nicoll Barnes to reconstitute the British Workers' League as the National Democratic and Labour Party (NDP), and stood candidates at the 1918 general election. Fisher stood for the party in Stourbridge, and received the Coalition Coupon, but he took only 28.8% of the vote and was not elected. His Labour opponent was the woman trades unionist, Mary Macarthur, one of only seventeen women candidates to take the opportunity of standing in the first parliamentary election in which women could be nominated as parliamentary candidates. Fisher's campaign against Macarthur was particularly unpleasant. He received substantial secret funding through Viscount Milner and worked closely with the Unionist Chamberlain family in Birmingham.

He soon joined the Conservative Party, leading its Conservative Workers' Union. He stood for the party in Stratford West Ham at the 1923 general election, but was again unsuccessful. He then withdrew from formal politics, but subsequently led a variety of organisations, including the Society for the Study of Religions, Anglo-French Alliance, and National Organization of Ratepayers.

The mosque is the largest in South Sumatra, and the third largest mosque in Sumatra after the Grand Mosque of West Sumatra and Great Mosque of Pekanbaru. History People around the ground of the Great Mosque. The original mosque of Palembang was a royal mosque located within the kraton (palace) complex of Kuto Gawang and was built by Sultan Ki Gede Ing Suro. After the destruction of this mosque in 1659 by Admiral Johan van der Laen of the VOC, the Sultanate of Palembang, under the reign of Sultan Mahmud Badaruddin I Jaya Wikrama, decided to build a new mosque. Construction started on Hijri 1 Jumadil Akhir 1151 (1738 ) beside the Kraton Tengkuruk, also known as Kuto Kecik. Construction of the mosque took 10 years because of disturbances caused by tension with the Dutch. The mosque was only completed on 28 Jumadil Awwal 1161 (1748 ). This new mosque, named the Sultan Mosque, was built in a typical Javanese mosque architecture, featuring a multi-tiered roof supported by four main posts and topped with a mustaka (roof top ornament). The roof also features a sweeping curvature that rises at the corners of the roof which may be influenced with Chinese architecture, although now it is commonly accepted to be directly influenced by the vernacular limas roof. At the time of its completion, the Sultan Mosque was believed to be the largest in Indonesia, even in Southeast Asia., having the capacity to accommodate 1,200 worshippers. The first minaret's construction started in 1748 and was completed in 1812, being similarly delayed because of another conflict with the Dutch. This minaret is a 20-meter white brick tower, with a hexagonal layout, and topped with a clay tile roof that resembles the roof of a Chinese pagoda. In that same year, a 12 x 18 square meter extension was added to the mosque, expanding its capacity to 2,300 worshippers. Further conflict with the Dutch caused destruction of the minaret, however in 1823, after the abolition of the sultanate, the mosque was renovated by the Dutch in an attempt at conciliation, with the destroyed clay tile roof of the minaret being replaced with shingle roof in 1825. In 1848, the Sultan Mosque was considerably expanded by the Dutch Colonial government. The traditional styled main entrance was replaced by neoclassical porticoes with Doric-styled columns. Further expansion occurred in 1879, with the addition of a porch supported by a cylindrical concrete column. In 1897, some lands around the mosque were acquired to expand the mosque complex. At this time, the mosque received its current name, the Masjid Agung or \\"Great Mosque\\" of Palembang. In 1916, the minaret building was restored; In 1930, the pillar columns of the mosque was raised, adding its height to 4 meter. Between 1966 and 1969, the Great Mosque of Palembang received another major expansion with the addition of second floors, expanding the area of the mosque to 5,520 square meter which enabled the mosque to accommodate 7,750 people. A new 45 meter high Ottoman-styled minaret was added to the mosque on January 22, 1970; its construction was sponsored by Pertamina. The mosque also received a Middle-East styled dome. The original roof form was not demolished, however, the overall profile of the mosque changed dramatically. The last major renovation of the mosque occurred in 2000 when the original architectural language of the mosque was restored. The mosque was completed on June 16, 2003 and was officially inaugurated by President Megawati Sukarnoputri. The mosque is now able to accommodate 9,000 people, and during the Friday prayer, when the field in the mosque complex is used, congregations inside the mosque complex can reach 15,000 people. Conflict over the Lawang Kidul Mosque In 1893, Masagus H. Abdulhamid, a businessman who had made fortune in wood and forest products, decided to build two new mosques in Palembang: the Muara Ogan Mosque on the estuary of the Ogan River, and the Lawang Kidul Mosque (which was originally a simple prayer space) located in administrative district 5 Ilir. Being strategically located near the harbor, Lawang Kidul Mosque soon became a gathering point for those who went on the hajj to Mecca. The religious elite based in the Sultan Mosque saw the success of Lawang Kidul Mosque as a threat to the existing balance of power and demanded it to be closed. At one point the intervention of the Advisor on Native Affairs, Snouck Hurgronje, was even sought. On the basis of one-sided information, Hurgronje issued an order to close Lawang Kidul Mosque at the end of 1893. It was only after the retirement of Hurgronje in 1906 that Lawang Kidul Mosque was reopened. The decision was not met with resistance by the religious elite because by that time the Sultan Mosque was no longer able to contain all its worshippers. Architecture The restored 18th-century minaret of the Great Mosque. The Great Mosque of Palembang features a green three-tiered roof, a typical mosque architecture in Indonesia. The roof form displays a strong Chinese influences, though they are now generally considered to be directly related with the traditional limas (pyramidal) roof. The Great Mosque of Palembang has two minarets, which is an unusual feature in Indonesian mosque architecture. The newer Ottoman-styled minaret is 45 meter high with 12 sides. The older 18th-century minaret shows influence from Chinese architecture. During Ramadan, the grounds in front of it are turned into a market.

Early life Hanns Diehl was born Hans Rudolf Diehl in Pirmasens, Rhineland- Palatinate, Germany, as the second son of August Diehl and Julia (n√©e Herb), a mechanical engineer and factory owner. He spent his earliest childhood years in Pirmasens until his father‚Äôs business sent the family to Moscow. Here Hanns studied Russian and attended his first four years of school at the Petri-Pauli Realgymnasium; he wrote later that his happiest memories as a boy were connected with his Russian life, where he often wandered through the magnificent forests surrounding the city and drew nature studies under the guidance of his mother. He described his mother as \\"...a not untalented dilettante who possessed a sharp eye and a striking judgment about graphic form\\".Diehl, Hanns, \\"Autobiography\\", speech to the Sagantinibund, Vienna, April 1931. Education The family moved back to Germany in the 1890s, to Weimar, where Diehl finished his secondary school education and entered the renowned Weimar Akademie f√ºr bildende K√ºnste‚Äîthe Academy of Fine Arts. He received his diploma from the Akademie in 1896, having studied under the Norwegian genre painter Carl Frithjof Smith (1859‚Äì1917) and Max Thedy (1858‚Äì1924), then as a master‚Äôs student with Professor Theodor Hagen, considered one of the founders of German Impressionism. In 1898, he went to study drawing at the St√§delsches Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt with Bernhard Mannfeld (1848‚Äì1925), who remained a lifelong friend and confidant. During these years of study, he traveled to Paris, Switzerland, the Baltic coast, and Hungary. During his years in Frankfurt, he established a lifelong friendship with the German naturalist painter Wilhelm Tr√ºbner; the older artist helped Diehl to establish himself as an academic painter. Through Tr√ºbner, he gained access to the Kunstsalon Bangel, where he participated in his first group exhibition in 1900. Of his works in this show, one critic praised his \\"quiet landscapes\\" as imparting a sense of rumination on life and stillness.\\"Kleines Feuilleton\\", Frankfurter General-Anzeiger, 11 October 1900. At this time he began referring to himself as Hanns Diehl-Wallendorf, apparently as a way to distinguish himself from another artist named Hans Diehl. Military Service In 1905, Diehl volunteered for his obligatory military service by joining a Hessian Infantry Regiment, spending one year in Darmstadt. In the first three years of World War I he served as a translator from Russian for the war ministry in Munich, for which he was awarded the K√∂nig-Ludwigs-Kreuz. At the beginning of 1918, he applied to become a war painter on the front and was assigned to the Bavarian Infantry in the field. There he painted troops as well as the commander Franz Ritter von Epp (1868‚Äì1946). He was greatly traumatized by what he experienced on the front; he wrote ‚ÄúThe unheard of terror of this war I saw and experienced in France and Serbia; an enduring impression of unlimited and completely inhumane barbarity\\".Diehl, Hanns, \\"Autobiography\\", speech to the Sagantinibund, Vienna, April 1931. Career in Vienna Diehl at his easel outdoors, 1920s In 1906, Diehl moved to Vienna, at the invitation of his mother's brother August Herb, who ran a decorative glass-making company, Herb & Schwab. He designed the company's logo, and provided many designs for Art Nouveau-style glass windows that were then the fashion for private homes and hotels. He was meant to take over the business, but had no interest in running a company, nor did he possess any business acumen; he wanted only to be a professional artist. In need of work, he experimented in a variety of styles, imitating the methods of Arnold B√∂cklin and Max Klinger. He painted ambitious oils and watercolor landscapes, but also produced prints for magazines and tried his hand at every medium. He also designed the cover for an avant-garde magazine founded by his brother Gustav Eugen Diehl, Moderne Revue. He was still experimenting artistically and had yet to find his own artistic voice. In 1916, he married Anna Pangratz (1887‚Äì1946), a capable businesswoman. She gave up her position at the Handelskammer (Chamber of Commerce) when she thought she was marrying a man who would be a director of a business. When Diehl rejected this position, Anna went back to work as the supervisor of the correspondence department of the Anker-Brot bakery firm, a position she held for 25 years. Hanns was now free to pursue his career solely as an artist. Hanns and Anna had one daughter, Ingeborg, born in 1917. Ambitious and energetic, Diehl was intent on emulating such figures as Tr√ºbner‚Äîhis ideal of an academic artist. He painted all genres, from mythological narrative images to landscapes and still-lifes, both in oil and in watercolor. He sketched constantly and seemed most confident in creating colored landscape drawings, which demonstrate excellent perspectival rendering and shading. After the war, he brought together a group of like- minded artists in Vienna and established the ‚ÄúK√ºnstlerbund Segantini‚Äù in 1921. He served as its director for the remainder of its lifespan until the onset of World War II. This artist's organization was committed to a traditional idea of painting, emulating the Austrian-Swiss painter of symbolic Alpine landscapes, Giovanni Segantini (1858‚Äì1899). This romantic Germanic style appealed to Diehl's emotional instincts, but his work never copied Segantini's motifs. Critics speak of his work as showing an individual streak within traditional painterly parameters‚Äîof going his \\"own way\\" Man, H., \\"Eine Gem√§ldekollektion\\", Mannheimer Tageblatt, 18. October 1900‚Äîand by the 1920s, Diehl was indeed formulating his own stylistic preferences. His portraits and still-lifes of the decade reveal a firm linear outline, with a near-impasto use of thick color. One critic of the first Segantini-Bund exhibition described his works admiringly as depicting \\"architectonic fantasies\\".\\"Ausstellung des K√ºnstlerbundes ‚ÄòSegantini‚Äô,\\" Illustriertes Wiener Extrablatt, vol. 50, nr. 124, 7. May 1921, p. 1 Throughout he made masterful drawings and amusing sketches wherever he traveled, and began to produce full- fledged watercolor landscapes. Ever short of patrons and often without enough money to buy materials, he did take on students, and at times offered drawing classes.Ballad of the Apes In one of his most cryptic and intriguing works, Affenballade (Ballad of the Apes), he created a grid of bars that are painted along the lines of the Hessian sacks he used as a canvas.Erika Esau, \\"The dilemma of Diehl: A forgotten artist, pt II\\", accessed 26 Dec. 2015. In the late 1920s, he began to create, apparently for private amusement, a series of eccentric, caricature-like watercolors that reveal a knowledge of works by such modern figures as Emil Nolde and Alfred Kubin. These often satirical commentaries are unlike any of his other, more formal works, and are described by later critics as revealing both a scurrilous sentiment \\"Mit scharfen Buntstiften\\", Kurier, 28. January 1993, p. 14. and a debt to German Expressionism.Baum, Peter, \\"Review\\", Ober√∂sterreichische Nachrichten, January 1963, p. 30. These sometimes anguished images are the pieces that have endured and are of greatest interest to contemporary audiences, who see in them a psychological reflection of the time between the wars in Vienna. Later life In her description of Diehl's life and career, Erika Esau writes, \\"Diehl's story epitomizes the confusing, and ultimately sad, trajectory that the political events of 20th-century history imposed on anyone involved in the artistic life of the German-speaking world.\\" Esau, Erika, \\"The dilemma of Diehl, pt I\\",  accessed 22 December 2015. Hanns Diehl was, like so many of his contemporaries, a romantic nationalist‚Äîa German who had become a naturalized Austrian citizen in 1926, at a time when notions of national identity were particularly urgent, after the defeat in World War I and the fear of Soviet-style Communism engulfing the countries. Artists as diverse as Nolde and Lyonel Feininger initially praised Hitler and Mussolini's efforts. Diehl became a member of the National Socialist Party even before the Anschluss in 1938‚Äîa decision that would come to haunt him after World War II. When the Nazis did take over Austria, Diehl naively saw the regime as offering job opportunities. He became one of the directors of the Gemeinschaft bildender K√ºnstler, the Society of Visual Artists, and submitted designs for the Party's official publications and events. He was to be bitterly disappointed that the regime was to exclude so many artists from its official exhibitions, writing a letter of complaint to the Party officials expressing his dismay at this lack of \\" National Socialist collegiality.\\" Letter from Hanns Diehl to Akad. Maler Franz Seky, 25 September 1938 This complete lack of understanding of the Nazi Party's political goals is indicative of so many cultural figures of the time. Diehl never expressed any anti-Semitic sentiment, and after the War, when he was briefly imprisoned, it was the testimony of a Jewish neighbor that assured his release. The real reasons for his arrest in 1946 have been muddied, but appear to have more to do with a squabble over studio space that caused Diehl to be turned in to the authorities as a Nazi party member. Because of the chaos of the judicial system immediately after the war, he remained in remand \\"under investigation\\" for 8 months. He was never brought to trial, convicted of any offense, or even formally charged with any offense. The situation broke him nonetheless. Although divorced by Anna by this time, he still went to live in her house. On December 22, 1946, both she and Hanns died of asphyxiation from a faulty gas heater. It is still unclear if their deaths were an accident or suicide. Perhaps because of his close ties to the Nazi Party, Diehl was forgotten, even as other members of the Segantini-Bund gained some recognition. In 1963, his family organized an exhibition of his work at the √ñsterreichische Staatsdruckerei, at which time the art critic of the Wiener Zeitung wrote that he was a painter who had been unfairly forgotten.\\"Ein posthumer √úberblick beweist, dass hier ein Maler von beachtlichen Qualit√§ten zu Unrecht vergessen wurde, Wiener Zeitung 1963. Another exhibition at the Galerie Hieke in 1993 praised his watercolors and personal paintings of the 1920s as his best work, labeling him as an artist \\"between tradition and eccentricity.\\" Hanns Diehl- Wallendorf, 1877-1946: Ein Maler zwischen Tradition und Exzentrik, Exhibition catalog, Hieke Kunsthandel, 27 Jan.-3 March 1993, p. 8 Gallery Image:Diehl_stained_glass_2.jpgStained glass Image:Diehl modernerevue coverdesign 1906.jpgCover design, ca. 1907 Image:diehl_print_illus- melk_ca1907.jpgPrint, Melk, ca. 1097 Image:diehl_watercolor_sworddancer_1920s1.jpgWatercolor, Sword Dancer, 1920s Image:Diehl stilllifeflowers 19231.jpgStill life of flowers, 1923 Image:Diehl_self_portrait_in_a_turban_ca_1925.jpg\\"Self Portrait in a Turban\\", oil painting, ca. 1925 Image:Diehl watercolor angsttraum 1934.jpgWatercolor, Nightmare, 1934 NotesReferencesFurther reading * \\"Sehr gut beobachtet, flott, gross und kr√§ftig hingesetzt\\" Frankfurter Zeitung, 1.

Anjali had disappeared after being a famous heroine. All searches to find this actress ended up as a failure. After the journalist finds her after many feats of hardships, there is a flashback revealing Anjali's travails. Being the daughter of a poor folk artiste named Devarajulu (Yogi Devaraj), her mother has been going to places to make her daughter an actress and reached Kodambakkam. After painfully climbing stairs and being rejected in every studio in Kodambakkam and Vadapalani, they agree on casting couch unhappily. However, Anjali gets her heroine role and makes it her debut after a compromise. This leads to a greed change in her mother to get money and leaves her in debt.

Sonia accepted to work on the film after relating to script, stating that she also went through certain hardships during her time as an actress and lost weight to star in the film. The actress however clarified to the media before release that the film was not based on her life or any other actress's life. The success of the Hindi film, The Dirty Picture (2011), which was based on the same theme, created extra publicity for the film.http://www.sify.com/movies/onv-becomes-the-new-dirty-picture-news-tamil- lmkkbAceacjsi.html Impressed with Sonia's performance during the shoot, Rajkrishna signed her on for his next film too, titled Achchamenna with Jithan Ramesh, but the film eventually did not materialise.

They recorded sparse versions of their songs at Echo Mountain studio in Asheville, NC, moving on to develop the songs with further instrumentation at the suggestion of their sound engineer. Melissa began to perform with Ryan under the stage name chosen by herself, \\"Cashavelly\\" being her paternal grandmother's maiden name and \\"Morrison\\" her mother's maiden name. Musical style Cashavelly Morrison conceived her songs as an exploration of shared grief, to emphasize universal compassion for those who go unheard and unseen. She quoted Jean Ritchie as her most important influence. Her songs blend together the traditions of American roots, the ballads of Appalachia, and represent a confessional gateway into loss and her deeply held values, notably the racial prejudices in the U.S. and the dire need for equal rights and empowerment for women. Discography Cashavelly Morrison released Long-Haired Mare EP in mid-2015. Their single and its accompanying video \\"Pink Dress\\" premiered in September 2015 and it earned very favorable reviews for its expressive vocals over country instrumentation and also for touching the issue of female empowerment by challenging societal standards amidst a hauntingly surreal feel. The next video, \\"Made of Sand\\", followed in October 2015 and also got praised for its artful lyricism and the authentic approach to expressing her truth. Her debut album, The Kingdom Belongs to a Child, released on October 30, 2015. Inspired by the tradition of Appalachian ballads, mostly steeped in Americana with hints of folk and world music, it earned praise for its raw emotion, the powerful imagery it revealed and evocative melodies, Cashavelly being favorably compared to Harriet Wheeler, Tori Amos and Natalie Merchant.

They prefer dry and warm habitats, especially with sandy soil. Description Piezodorus lituratus can reach a length of . These large shieldbugs occur in two adult colour forms. In the spring when they emerge and mate they are predominantly green, while the new generation that appears in the late summer has purplish-red markings on the pronotum and Corium. In autumn they have much paler color, prior to the hibernation they may become darker, but after the hibernation they are bright green.British Bugs In the Piezodorus lituratus var. alliaceus the corium shows a uniform yellow-greenish color. This species could be confused with the green shieldbug, Palomena prasina, but Piezodorus lituratus has a different habitat and red antennae. Biology Mating takes place from May to July, the females lay 10 to 20 eggs on the stems, leaves and fruits of the host plants. The nymphs occur until September. The adult of the new summer generation can be found from the end of July or beginning of August. Hibernation takes place as imago. Main host plants are various legumes (Fabaceae), especially common broom (Sarothamnus scoparius) and dyer‚Äôs greenweed (Genista tinctoria), but also alfalfa (Medicago sativa), vetches (Vicia species), sweet-clover (Melilotus species), crown vetches (Coronilla species) sainfoins (Onobrychis species), lupin (Lupinus species) and others.

While serving as chairman of the International Rice Commission, he was instrumental for the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba√±os, Laguna in the Philippines. Personal life Sithiporn was born on April 11, 1883, and studied in England for most of his early years. At 18, while studying mechanical engineering at City and Guild's Technical College, he was summoned back to his home country to help manage the family's lime-burning business. At 21, he married a woman who soon died but not without bearing a son. His second wife was Mom Sriphromma, daughter of the last hereditary chief of Nan. Despite his royal blood as fourth son of His Royal Highness Krida Bhinihan, the Prince Naretraworit, grandson of King Mongkut, and nephew of King Chulalongkorn, he developed a profound interest in agriculture. This interest came about due to his wife's fragile health which required the fresh air and open spaces of the countryside. Career and legacy Sithiporn successfully propagated the Nicholson Yellow Dent variety of corn which he encouraged other farmers to plant for animal feed. Starting 1950 when rice was not favorable to land conditions, corn was planted instead. By the 1980s, corn became one of Thailand's major exports. He was also instrumental in the establishment of an egg producers' association which made Thailand an exporter of eggs. When the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) established the International Rice Commission in 1949, Sithiporn was elected as chairman. His suggestion for a research center for rice production during one of the meetings with the Rockefeller Foundation resulted in the establishment of the International Rice Research Institute in Los Ba√±os, Laguna in the Philippines.

With their youngest brother Jad (Wissam Fares) about to be released from prison ‚Äì where he was serving a sentence for a crime that Ziad had committed ‚Äì Ziad and Joe plan to go straight by using their coke-peddling profits to open a restaurant. But Ziad's supplier, a powerful drug lord who is none too keen to see his dealers retire, convince the brothers to take on one last job: smuggling a million-dollar shipment of Captagon - a locally manufactured amphetamine - to Syria, where the drug is wildly popular with militia fighters. Smelling a trap, Ziad and Jad hatch a plan to divert the shipment to Erbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, where they have a secure connection. By chance, they learn that cans of exposed film reels are spared the obligatory X-ray at the Beirut airport, as the radiation can damage the footage. Overnight, the three brothers become the producers of a feature film directed by Charbel (Fouad Yammine), a talentless filmmaker and frequent customer whose tab at the pizzeria has vastly exceeded his means. As the shipping date approaches, the boys race to finalize the details of their very big plan while warding off the suspicions of their vengeful boss.

Since the incarved rock inscriptions and ivory tags showing his name are either drawn sloppily, or lacking any royal crest, the reading and thus whole existence of king \\"Elephant\\" are highly disputed.  Identity  The proposed existence of Elephant is based on G√ºnter Dreyer's and Ludwig David Morenz's essays. They are convinced that Elephant was a local king who ruled at the region of Qustul. According to Dreyer, Elephant's name appears in incised rock inscriptions at Qustul and Gebel Sheikh-Suleiman, where the hieroglyphs are put inside a royal serekh. On ivory tags found at Abydos, the Elephant appears without any other royal crest. Dreyer sees a cube-shaped throne seat and a walking elephant beneath it and reads Pen-Abu (\\"Great one from the (throne) seat\\").G√ºnter Dreyer: Umm El-Qaab.

Morenz thinks alike but is highly uncertain about the reading of the name. He prefers to use the neutral provisional name \\"King Elephant\\". Alternatively, he proposes a rhinoceros as a royal animal. Morenz points out that it became a remarkable fashion during the Naqada III epoch to choose dangerous and unpredictable animals (such as lions, crocodiles, elephants and rhinoceroses) for building up royal names.Ludwig David Morenz: Bild-Buchstaben und symbolische Zeichen.

Other Egyptologists, such as Peter Kaplony and Toby Wilkinson, are not so sure and propose different readings. Whilst Wilkinson sees a throne seat and the hieroglyph for \\"border\\", Kaplony sees a seat and a stand full of wine jars, the sign for \\"praised\\". Kaplony also mentions that the name of a certain 1st-dynasty palatinate named Hor-Sekhentydjw was also written with the wine-jar holder symbol. He believes that the name of the palatinate was created out of King Elephant's name.Peter Kaplony: Die Inschriften der √Ñgyptischen Fr√ºhzeit, vol. III (= √Ñgyptologische Abhandlungen (√ÑA), vol. 8).

There is a good chance of finding them in Kaptai lake system formed by the damming of Karnafuli River, as a small stream drains the pool to kapati lake. Description Danio annulosus is the 25th species of the Danio identified. Just like all the chain danios Danio annulosus has chain like pattern instead of the striped patterns of zebra danios. As all the chain danios, Danio annulosus has the same color pattern containing a series of dark rings with light color space beside it, a complete lateral line, 14 circumpendular scales, have the first ray in the pectoral fin and a black humeral spot. Danio annulosus is different from the rest of the Puntius species by many features such as a much shorter pecotal and pelvic fins, the humeral spot is a bit wider and deep, instead of round or deep wide. No sexual dimorphism is present in Danio annulosus.http://www.mapress.com/zootaxa/2015/f/zt03994p068.pdf Coloration Healthy adult individuals in life have dark stripes which include circles which are blue in color with the space in between including the circle centres are orange in color.

He was born in Penrith, Cumbria, and studied Fine Art at Carlisle College of Art. After moving to London he found he was in demand as an illustrator, and he worked for many publications including The Sunday Times, Radio Times and Time Out magazine. Eventually moving away from the world of commissioned work, Robinson turned to oils, developing a distinctive, textured style of working, inspired by a fascination with London subjects and architecture. Having moved to Norfolk in 1999, he discovered new worlds to explore; from the contrast of the City with its high rise office blocks to the Norfolk landscape and its immeasurable expanse of sea and sky. He has spoken of using the subjects on his door-step to fuel his imagination; resulting in an ongoing series of paintings which include ladies with stick thin legs, walking their reluctant dogs in the wind, rain and snow, romantic interludes and bustling towns created from his imagination, based on his familiar childhood surroundings, as well as the little towns dotted along the North Norfolk coast. Often set against the backdrop of the stormy North Sea and the rugged landscape of Cumbria, each work is accompanied by often humorous and quirky titles to illustrate the story behind each painting. Paul Robinson's exhibitions at British Art Galleries include the BRIAN SINFIELD GALLERY, ISLAND FINE ARTS, (ONE MAN SHOW), and THE GARDEN HOUSE GALLERY.

Biography Freke took a B. A. at Trinity in 1840, his M. B. in 1845 and his M.D. in 1855. He worked as a physician in various hospitals in Dublin and worked at the first Irish lunatic asylum founded by Jonathan Swift.Blackith, Robert E. (1980). Henry Freke: An Early Dublin Evolutionist. Irish Naturalists' Journal. Vol. 20, No. 3, pp. 104-106 He is credited for developing the concept of negative entropy. Evolution His early writings in the Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science experimented with evolutionary ideas such as all organisms descending from a single germ. Freke proposed an evolutionary theory in 1851 and more fully in a book for 1861. Freke argued to have published on evolution before Charles Darwin. In 1851 he wrote a pamphlet that claimed animals and plants had evolved from a single filament. He sent a copy of the pamphlet to Darwin who described the writing style as \\"ill-written\\" and \\"beyond my scope\\".Browne, Janet. (2003). Charles Darwin, Volume 2. Pimlico. p. 109.

On page 83 of his On the Origin of Species by Means of Organic Affinity (1861), Freke developed a theory of pangenesis, in which he proposed that all life was developed from microscopic organic agents which he named granules, which existed as 'distinct species of organizing matter' and would develop into different biological structures.Macalister, Alexander.

Life Greene became a singer and actor. As a young man Greene was associated with songwriter Hoagy Carmichael. He is said to have discovered Ernie Andrews in 1945 and produced his first sessions. He wrote Andrews' biggest hit, the song \\"Soothe Me\\". Greene's lyrics were stylish and often had strong emotional impact. The idea for \\"Across the Alley from the Alamo\\" came to Greene in 1946 in the middle of the night. He had been writing songs for Nat King Cole, and visited Cole's manager the next morning, who thought the song had potential. Mel Torm√© made a demo, then the Mills Brothers made a hit recording. This was soon followed by a version by Woody Herman and his Orchestra, sung by Woody Herman with The Four Chips, and a version by Stan Kenton and his Orchestra, sung by June Christy. Greene collaborated as composer and lyricist with bandleader and pianist Stan Kenton and arranger Pete Rugolo, making the Kenton band one of the most popular in America in the 1940s and 1950s. He collaborated as a lyricist with Stan Kenton on \\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine\\" and \\"I'm Going Mad for a Pad\\" in 1946. The band's musical style was a precursor to West Coast jazz. In 1952 Greene was working with pianist and arranger Eddie Beal, who had accompanied Herb Jeffries and Toni Harper, on new music for the Kenton \\"aggregation\\". June Christy and Chris Connor, vocalists with Kenton's band, performed hit songs by Greene such as \\"Across the Alley from the Alamo\\", \\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine\\" and \\"Don't Let the Sun Catch You Cryin'\\". Greene's songs were recorded by artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Carmen McRae, Julie London, Fats Waller, Ray Charles and Dinah Washington. The Muppets recorded one of his songs. His \\"Read My Lips\\" was recorded in 1958 by the Russ Garcia orchestra for Liberty Records, possibly the origin of the statement \\"Read my lips‚Äîno new taxes\\" by George H. W. Bush at the 1988 Republican National Convention. In the 1960s and 1970s Greene worked on feature film scripts and music. Greene also wrote the novel House of Pleasure (1967). Greene wrote the soundtrack for the film Psychedelic Sexualis, also called On Her Bed of Roses (1966), about a violent sociopath. It has been described as \\"a bizarre concoction of proto-psychedelic jams (\\"The Boozer\\"), beat jazz (\\"The Bar Fly\\"), and experimental percussive abstractions (\\"Theme\\" and \\"Walk to Hell\\"). Joe Greene died of kidney failure on 16 June 1986 in a hospital in Pasadena, California, aged 71. He was survived by his wife, Marthella, three children and four grandchildren. Selected songs *\\"And Her Tears Flowed Like Wine\\" (1944) Words.

Smack Mellon supports emerging, under-recognized mid-career, and women artists through a highly regarded exhibition program, competitive studio residency, and technical support to realize new and ambitious projects. History Smack Mellon was founded in 1995 in Dumbo, Brooklyn by artist Andrea Reynosa and musician Kevin Vertrees in their live/work loft space at 135 Plymouth Street, #306 when the neighborhood consisted of abandoned warehouse buildings and a sparsely populated pioneering class of artist do-it-yourselfers. Since its inception the organization has produced numerous exhibitions, and presented the work of hundreds of artists in four different locations in DUMBO. In 1997 Smack Mellon founding Executive Director Andrea Reynosa brokered a partnership with the Walentas family and their company Two Trees Management for a temporary dedicated space at 81 Washington Street for the exhibition Lost and Found featuring the work of Harmony Hammond and emerging Brooklyn based talent. At that time, Two Trees had a number of vacant historic, industrial properties throughout DUMBO and was interested in providing their spaces to not-for-profit organizations to use for cultural programming. From 1999 to 2005 Smack Mellon occupied a Civil War-era iron foundry at 56 Water Street, which had been turned into a spice milling and grinding facility in the 1950s. Since 2005 Smack Mellon has been located at 92 Plymouth Street in a former coal-fired boiler house that provided steam for heat and power to several industrial buildings in the neighborhood. Exhibitions Today, Smack Mellon‚Äôs Exhibition Program continues to advance public interest in the visual arts while providing opportunities for emerging and under-recognized visual artists whose opportunities for exhibition have been limited to realize ambitious projects. Smack Mellon enables roughly thirty artists each year - 60% of whom are women - to create and present large-scale work to the public in their 6,000 sq ft gallery. Smack Mellon features a wide range of work, including sculpture, installation art, painting, photography, film/video, and site specific projects. Smack Mellon provides opportunities for solo exhibitions to artists who do not have commercial gallery representation in NYC. Beyond, Beyond by Ron Baron at Smack Mellon, 2017 Previous exhibitions have included the critically acclaimed RESPOND, which was a direct response to the continued failure of the United States to protect its black citizens from police discrimination and violence, after learning of the grand jury's decision to not indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo for the death of Eric Garner. Smack Mellon's exhibitions have received multiple rewards for best show during the Dumbo Art Festival. In 2013 Bryan Zanisnik's exhibition at Smack Mellon was awarded the prize of best exhibition; and the following year Saya Woolfalk's ChimaTEK won the award.

As rents continue to increase astronomically throughout the City, it is increasingly difficult, if not virtually impossible for artists to find affordable, appropriate studio space. In response to the studio crisis faced by artists in New York City, Smack Mellon's Studio Program provides much needed workspace, and financial and technical support to aid artists in the creation of new work. Smack Mellon receives over 600 applications for six available studios each year. Expenses, including museum admissions, transportation and food, are paid during the program.  Education  Smack Mellon‚Äôs arts education initiative, Art Ready engages young people in a way no other arts education program does, it pairs students directly with working artists; the students learn first hand over the course of a school year what it is to be an artist in the artist‚Äôs studio. The program operates during the school year and includes a series of studio visits with emerging and established artists; a series of field trips to museums and galleries; 2-3 art workshops; and a four-month arts mentorship. Art Ready connects up to twenty high school students with ten diverse artists, to gain practical experience working with professionals in a variety of artistic disciplines. The program is free for students. Working as mentors, the artists provide professional and creative guidance as the students make decisions about their futures in the arts. Mentor/teaching artists also tutor the students in their creative process, introduce them to new ways of working, and engage them in continuous critical reflection. Art Ready truly prepares high school aged students for artistic careers and gives them practical experience working in a diversity of artistic disciplines.

However, he soon changed careers and instead became a sanitation engineer.Martin Crick, The History of the Social-Democratic Federation, p.317 Smart became interested in socialism and joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) and Fabian Society, but he devoted most of his time to the Independent Labour Party (ILP). At the 1895 general election, he stood as the ILP candidate for Huddersfield; he took 11.2% of the vote and was not elected. Despite this, he became increasingly prominent in the ILP, serving on its National Administrative Council. In 1910, Smart was a signatory to Leonard Hall's Green Manifesto, which called on the ILP to distance itself from the Labour Party's \\"revisionist\\" positions. He left the ILP in 1911, becoming a founding member of the British Socialist Party (BSP), which was largely created by the SDF, and he served on its first executive. Disappointed at the BSP's rejection of syndicalism, he and Hall resigned in 1912.Paul Ward, Red Flag and Union Jack, p.93 He subsequently became less prominent, although he did join a new SDF, successor to the National Socialist Party, in 1923.

He has had a long career in Michinoku Pro Wrestling, where he currently wrestles, being a three-time Tohoku Tag Team champion and a one-time Tohoku Junior Heavyweight champion. Career=Michinoku Pro Wrestling (1993‚Äìpresent) With a kendo and amateur wrestling background, Yonekawa trained in and debuted in Gran Hamada's Universal Lucha Libre in 1992. He later joined Michinoku Pro Wrestling, where after years in the low card, he became Yone Genjin, a humorous caveman gimmick. He had a comical feud with Wellington Wilkins Jr. before being sent to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre to train, which was in storyline explained as Genjin himself swimming his way to Mexico through the Pacific Ocean. Upon his return, now as a more civilized, Spanish-talking version of himself, but his luck did not change, being relegated again to low card comedy matches. In December 1998, Yone Genjin announced his retirement after a head injury. He would be replaced by Tsubo Genjin, a similar character played by Hiroyuki Kotsubo. In December 2001, Yone Genjin made a surprise return to M-Pro as a sporadic wrestler, forming a tag team with Tsubo Genjin. Their alliance ended in November 2002, which was followed by Tsubo defeating Yone in a singles match in order to keep the gimmick. After a one year hiatus, Yonekawa returned in 2003 under the new gimmick of Kesen Numajiro, (a play with the name of his origin city, Kesennuma), an eccentric enka singer. Numajiro became famous for coming to the ring while singing, and he even launched several successful singles thanks to Yonekawa's natural voice skills, the first of which was Umi no Tamashii (Sea Soul). In 2005, Numajiro turned heel, allying with the villainous salsa stable Los Salseros Japoneses (Takeshi Minamino, Pineapple Hanai and Mango Fukuda) in an attempt to turn it into a band called \\"Kesen Numajiro and los Salseros Japoneses.\\" He feuded with another music-themed faction, boy band Sailor Boys (Kei and Shu Sato), over which had the best music, and they resolved to prove it in a match in which the loser would have to drop their gimmick. With the aid of Minamino, Numajiro defeated one of the Satos and stripped them of their music. Numajiro and Minamino took part in the Futaritabi Tag Team Tournament 2004, where they advanced to the finals, but they were eliminated by Shanao & Kagetora. His alliance with Los Salseros Japoneses lasted until June 2006, when the stable was dissolved. Numajiro turned face again, although he kept briefly teaming up with former salsero Banana Senga, who had similarly become a face. Numajiro went unnoticed until 2008, when he formed a successful tag team with Kinya Oyanagi. On May 3, 2012, however, he faced Ultimo Dragon in a match where he loser would be forced to change his ring name, being predictably defeated. Numajiro then adopted the name of Kesen Numagirolamo, a parody of Girolamo Panzetta, and formed a tag team with Dragon himself. He recovered his name back in April 2014.

It laid claim to being the first colour tabloid newspaper published in the United Kingdom using new, digital pre-press technology on an Apple Macintosh 512K desktop computer, a claim that remains undisputed. It laid further claim in 1995 to being the first newspaper published online, to extend local knowledge Worldwide using the original Netscape Navigator v1.0 web browser within months of its 14 December 1994 launch. Despite these early successes, the newspaper faced the same challenge as its elder contemporaries in making well-curated content pay on the World Wide Web while maintaining a traditional print presence, costly by comparison. The last edition of the newspaper appeared in 2005 under its associated Staying in Wales masthead with a new \\"Insight\\" magazine supplement featuring The Countryside‚ÄìY Cefn Gwlad while This Week went into hibernation for an indefinite period of time. The newspaper's founders went their separate ways: Steven Potter leaving Wales for London in 1995 to set up LondonTown.com; Terry Jackson remaining in Wales to develop the beta Wales.info open web platform and the newspaper's online presence. History This Week was the brainchild of Steven Potter during the second year of his marketing degree course at Lancaster University. The previous year, having convinced friend and business mentor Terry Jackson that the newly launched Apple Macintosh 512K was essential to his university studies, he arrived at Lancaster with his new possession and Steve Jobs (RIP) as his all-time hero. Jackson, meanwhile, had bought Cae Rhys farmhouse on three acres of land in the Snowdonia National Park to get away from the rat race and applied for planning permission to convert barn buildings on the land into a residential education centre.\\"Cae Rhys Educational Project Prospectus\\", 15 July 1988. This was to be run in conjunction with the Snowdonia National Park Study Centre,\\"1. Introduction\\", Cae Rhys Educational Project Prospectus, 15 July 1988. and school visits to the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station whose parent company, Magnox Electric, was keen on educating the next generation of energy consumers.\\"5. Project development\\", Cae Rhys Educational Project Prospectus, 15 July 1988. Destiny intervened when Potter came to stay at Cae Rhys during the 1988 summer recess, ostensibly to help lay out educational programmes for the new centre on his prized Apple Mac, while Jackson researched opportunities for students to let off steam at visitor attractions in the area.\\"6. Group itinerary development\\" Cae Rhys Educational Project Prospectus, 15 July 1988. With planning permission a long way off and by no means certain, and with out-of-date tourist information leaflets spilling out of cupboards and gathering dust in the farmhouse, it was a light-bulb moment for the two protagonists who decided time would be better spent researching an apparent gap in the market for up- to-date information provision to visitors at their destinations in Wales, and the potential for publishing a free newspaper for visitors, vindicated by later research.\\"Promotional Literature Consultation\\", Wales Tourist Board, March 1994.\\"Visitor Information Survey\\", Wales Tourist Board, 1996.\\"UK Visitor Information Research\\", Wales Tourist Board, 1997.\\"Visitor Information Gathering Behaviour\\", This Week Wales, 1998. It also gave Potter a substantial, in-depth project for his marketing degree, which coincided with a report to the Wales Tourist Board in June 1988 of a Study of the Social, Cultural and Linguistic Impact of Tourism in and Upon Wales.of the Social, Cultural and Linguistic Impact of Tourism In and Upon Wales\\" European Centre for Traditional and Regional Cultures, Llangollen, Clwyd, June 1988. Three months later, after Wales Tourist Board research on the information gathering habits of visitors at their destinations revealed only 1% of visitors to Wales read local newspapers because they didn't contain information relevant to their stay, This Week was born with a distribution formula targeting visitors alone, with little leakage into the domestic market and few return copies. The first North Wales edition was launched in March 1989 by Secretary of State for Wales, Wyn Roberts at Penrhyn Castle, hosted by the National Trust in Wales\\"This Week Newspaper Launch Photo Montage\\", National Trust, Penrhyn Castle, March 1989. The front cover featured a specially commissioned watercolour of Fishing Boats at Borth-y-Gest by local Porthmadog artist Rob Piercy\\"This Week First Edition\\", This Week in North Wales front cover, 18‚Äì31 March 1989. The launch attracted much media attention and the newspaper became the subject in 1990 of a BBC TV documentary entitled Into Print, produced by Fleet Street journalist Michael Bywater\\"Into Print; Publish and be Read\\", BBC2 England, Michael Bywater, 11 September 1990. and still airing occasionally on BBC2. Regional editions covering Mid Wales, South Wales and West Wales were launched the following year to give national coverage with Wythnos Yma, a special Welsh language edition, published annually for the National Eisteddfod of Wales.THIS WEEK Wythnos Yma Newspaper Cover for the 2000 National Eisteddfod of Wales Llanelli. Trade Mark applications were filed on 24 July 1998 for THIS WEEK and WYTHNOS YMA under Class 16: Newspapers, printed publications and letterheads, all relating to tourism in Wales. The applications were successful and Trade Mark UK00002173032 was entered into the Intellectual Property Register on 7 January 2000.\\"Trade Mark Registration\\" Intellectual Property Register, 7 January 2000. National coverage enabled a series of successful, pan-Wales campaigns with major sponsors and European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) support in partnership with the three Regional Tourism Companies (RTCs) in Wales under contract. When support for the RTCs was withdrawn by the Wales Tourist Board in 2002, the companies struggled to stay in existence; the partnerships were dissolved and they became market competitors with the exception of the South Wales company, which went into voluntary liquidation in 2003. As a result, and with developments hampered by the negative effect on tourism of the 2001/ 2002 foot and mouth outbreak, the newspaper was unable to build on its online investment in Wales and maintain a presence in print at the same time. A final edition was published in 2005 and the online digital assets laid to rest until a new, commercially sustainable, online business model could be conceived based on the five Cs of the new tourism marketplace: content, community, culture, connectivity, commerce. Content The newspaper's content was a formulaic mix of regional features, news in brief items, comprehensive calendars of seasonal events, and campaigns targeting specific reader groups. Editors were selected based on local knowledge, cultural integrity, journalistic experience and readability, all supported by local area maps, guides and imagery. Electronic layout and typesetting was by QuarkXPress in five columns, three for editorial matter, two for standard format advertising. AGaramond 9pt was adopted as house font, 7pt for closely set events listings, and Bodonoi Bold 56pt for headlines. The THIS WEEK masthead was set in Walbaum Roman 88/ 77pt with the National Tourism Newspaper of Wales strapline set in Frutiger UltraBlack 10.5pt. Masthead The THIS WEEK masthead drew comment from a number of well-meaning critics who felt it at odds with a newspaper starting life as a biweekly (every other week) and later becoming a seasonal, magazine- style news-sheet. This, however, was formula publishing stretched to its logical limits to deliver just-in-time information to a changing readership of visitors staying no longer than a fortnight at their destinations. In fact, the average visitor stay in the 1980s across the traditional fortnightly summer holiday and short breaks at other times of the year was less than a week. This Week therefore became the visitors' week rather than marking a sequential period of time. Maps Prolific use was made of geographic information in laying out the newspaper's editorial, helping readers to navigate pages and locate things of interest on the ground. The development of an early geographic information system using Maps in Minutes facilitated colour map production using more than a hundred different data set layers of information. Maps became a distinguishing feature of the newspaper, giving it a unique selling proposition (USP) that it was able to carry through to online publishing in conjunction with the Taste of Wales/ Blas ar Gymru Campaign. This Week became an Ordnance Survey licensed development partner to explore new, online mapping applications in particular, but complicated licensing terms stalled any worthwhile developments. Campaigns The following newspaper campaigns were designed to enhance visitors' experience at their destinations in Wales; tell stories to friends and family about their visit, and encourage return visits to Wales for holidays and short breaks. Distribution outside Wales was to encourage impromptu decisions to come to Wales.

The Countryside‚ÄìY Cefn Gwlad Building on the Wales Country Escapades campaign, this was the first featured campaign of the newspaper's new Insight Magazine Supplement launched in 2004. It coincided with launch of the Countryside Wales UK website as part of the Wales.info beta web platform development. The Greatest Show in Wales Sponsorship by This Week of the Wales Tourist Board's Welsh Event of the Year Award, rebranded The Greatest Show in Wales, won in 2000 by the Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau folk festival, a uniquely Welsh experience for visitors in June to this old Meirionnydd town. The Award was made in the face of stiff competition from a South Wales golfing event, which was heavily tipped to win. The judges were unanimous in considering Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau to be a celebration of Welsh culture at its best; a prime example of how, via tourism, culture can drive economic growth in a community. The festival sat perfectly within a developing strategy for arts and culture in Wales\\"Cultural Tourism Strategy for Wales\\" Wales Tourist Board 2002. and was set to emerge onto a wider stage, strengthening rather than foregoing its sense of local identity as it progressed. Sustainable Transport for Tourism Wales Impelled by an urgent need to reduce high-season traffic congestion in tourism honeypot areas of Wales and encouraged by the success of its First North Wales Events Campaign, the newspaper embarked on a national campaign to get visitors out of their cars at destination, reduce their carbon footprint, and help sustain an environment that attracted millions of staying and day visitors to Wales in the first place. In addition to a comprehensive 1998‚Äì2001 Phases 2 Report\\"Phase 2 Report\\" Sustainable Transport for Tourism Wales, 1998‚Äì2001. and a Draft 2007‚Äì2011 Phase 3 Strategy Consultation,\\"Phase 3 Strategy Consultation\\" Sustainable Transport for Tourism Wales, 2007‚Äì2011. it resulted in a seminal short paper entitled Infostructure; Sustainable Transport and Tourism,\\"Infostructure; Sustainable Transport and Tourism\\" This Week Wales, 23 October 2004. which influenced forward thinking on the r√¥le of the Internet in future developments.

Online presence An article on p3 of the Spring 1995 issue of This Week in South & West Wales regional edition announcing the presence of an online version of the newspaper at thisweek.co.uk after release of the Netscape Navigator v1.0 web browser on 14 December 1994. An article entitled The Virtual Wales Tourist appeared in 1995 editions of the newspaper announcing the online presence of This Week at thisweek.co.uk after release of the Netscape Navigator v1.0 web browser in December 1994. It is believed to be the first online newspaper of its kind. It was the Taste of Wales/ Blas ar Gymru Campaign, however, that provided the first real opportunity for This Week to demonstrate the significant advantages the World Wide Web held for Welsh tourism with online mapping at its core. The newspaper's status as an Ordnance Survey licensed development partner would have been key at this stage were it not for licensing problems not resolved until many years later following establishment of the Open Data Institute in 2012. Instead, an alliance was formed with Google Maps and a deal brokered by the newspaper for the Wales datasets to be brought up to the same standard as those for England. As a result, and following acquisition by the newspaper of the Wales.info national web domain, Google Maps was used extensively in the beta Wales.info web platform Wales.info beta web platform development, supporting the \\"THIS WEEK\\" Insight Magazine Supplement, featuring The Countryside‚ÄìY Cefn Gwlad. The platform was used to demonstrate proof of concept and validate markets for linked, geospatial data on the World Wide Web. The new Countryside Wales UK website gave an early indication of the newspaper's online direction of travel following publication on the web of the first THIS WEEK WALES interactive online edition in 2005.

It originated from a disturbance in the Gulf of Aden, the first such tropical cyclogenesis on record. After moving eastward, the system interacted with the monsoon trough and became a tropical storm on June 11\\\\. Later that day, it turned toward Oman and struck the country's southeast coast. It weakened over land, dissipating on June 12, although it continued to produce rainfall ‚Äì heavy at times ‚Äì over the next few days. Offshore Oman, the storm's rough waves disabled an oil tanker and damaged a fishing boat, killing one person in the latter incident. Striking Oman, the storm produced significant rainfall totals well above the monthly average, peaking at in the Dhofar region. Strong winds where the storm moved ashore damaged buildings and the local water plant. The rains washed out roads and isolated villages, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. However, the effects were more severe in Yemen, where the floods were considered the worst on record. The storm produced the heaviest rainfall in 70 years, reaching in Ma'rib. Flood waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges, some of them dating back 2,000 years to the Roman era. The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields, accounting for US$100 million in agriculture damage. At least 1,820 houses were destroyed, many of them built on wadis, or dry river beds. Overall damage was estimated at US$1.2 billion, and there were 338 deaths in Yemen. The World Bank assisted in a project to rebuild the damaged infrastructure in Yemen and to mitigate against future floods. Meteorological history On May 31, a weak circulation persisted over the warm waters of the Gulf of Aden between Yemen and Somalia. Its origins were unknown, possibly the convergence of the sea breeze along the coast of Somalia with the monsoon flow. The system produced convection, or thunderstorms, along both coasts of the body of water. As it moved east-northeastward along the coast of Yemen and Oman, the disturbance brought dry air from the north, which decreased the convection. It moved farther offshore on June 7 into the open Arabian Sea, where it interacted with the south-west monsoon and developed more convection. The area of thunderstorms persisted about 1,480 km (920 mi) northeast of Somalia by June 9. It became circular as the circulation became more defined, fueled by the instability from the monsoon trough. Wind shear was expected to prevent significant development, although the system organized enough that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center issued a tropical cyclone formation alert on June 10. On the next day, the agency initiated advisories on Tropical Cyclone 02A about 160 km (100 mi) from the Oman coastline. This marked the first occasion that a tropical cyclone originated from a system in the Gulf of Aden. After becoming a tropical storm, the system's structure became more aligned as it developed an anticyclone aloft. Fueled by water temperatures of , the cyclone intensified further. At 03:00 UTC on June 11, the Omani city of Fahud recorded sustained winds of 75 km/h (45 mph), and a station on Masirah Island recorded a pressure of . On this basis, the JTWC estimated that the storm attained peak winds of 75 km/h (45 mph). However, a nearby ship reported sustained winds of 85 km/h (50 mph), and the well-defined structure on satellite imagery suggested winds as strong as 120 km/h (75 mph). Moving northwestward, the cyclone made landfall around 09:00 UTC on June 11 about 130 km (80 mi) southwest of Masirah Island in southeastern Oman, at a location named Ras Madrakah. It quickly weakened over the desert terrain and dry air, and the circulation dissipated by June 12 over the central portion of the country. However, the remnants turned to the southwest, steered by a northerly flow. It entered the Rub' al Khali, or Empty Quarter, of Saudi Arabia late on June 12, and continued slowly westward. The storm's interaction with the monsoon brought the intertropical convergence zone northward into Oman and Yemen, bringing unusually heavy rainfall until the system gradually wound down. The IMD ‚Äì the official warning agency for the basin ‚Äì did not track the cyclone. In general, tropical cyclone forecast models failed to predict that the storm would form. Impact Map of the territories surrounding the Gulf of Aden that were affected by the cyclone The precursor to the storm dropped heavy rainfall in Oman, reaching in Khaftawt on May 31\\\\. The storm later produced intense precipitation across the coast and desert regions of the country. Masirah recorded of rainfall over 36 hours, compared to the average monthly average of , while Salalah reported , or 600% of the average June rainfall. However, the heaviest rainfall occurred on June 11 and into the following day, when the system drew moisture into mountainous parts of the Dhofar region. A station called Jebel Ashor recorded over 48 hours, including on June 11\\\\. Farther north, heavy rainfall occurred in the Al Hajar Mountains, where was recorded, mostly over eight hours; there, of precipitation was recorded over two hours. Offshore the Arabian Peninsula, the cyclone produced rough waves that disabled an oil tanker; the crew was rescued by the Omani Coast Guard after being stranded for a few days. A fishing boat was damaged after being washed ashore near Ras Madrakah, killing one person in the crew of nine. Near where the storm moved ashore, the storm's strong winds heavily damaged the village of Ras Madrakah. Considered the worst storm in memory, the cyclone wrecked workshops and buildings, including damaging the roof of the desalination plant, leaving residents without water for several days. Strong winds of over 93 km/h (58 mph) knocked down 20 trees in Rima that were planted to provide shade for government buildings. Across the storm's track through Oman, the rains replenished water levels in aquifers, while also washing out roads and isolating villages. This lack of transportation prevented prompt repair work. The Jiddat al-Harasis desert was flooded for over a month due to the storm, killing two people due to drowning in Al-Ghubra. The floods provided grazing for the endangered oryx population, although many livestock were killed. Three airports in the country were closed due to floods up to four days. Damage was heaviest in Yemen, where the storm's remnants dropped the heaviest rainfall in 70 years. Ma'rib recorded of rainfall, and the capital Sana'a reported of precipitation. Widespread flooding affected much of Yemen, the worst on record for the country. Damage was heaviest in three governorates ‚Äì Hadhramaut, Shabwah, and Ma'rib ‚Äì with lesser effects in three other governorates. The waters washed away or damaged of roads and 21 bridges, including the primary road crossing Hadhramaut. Some of the damaged roads were built 2,000 years prior under the Roman Empire. Primary highways were damaged in 16 locations. Thousands of cars and other vehicles were inundated, necessitating boat travel to transport injured residents. About of power lines was cut. The floods washed away 113 power poles, and four main generators were affected, causing widespread outages. Storm debris contaminated also many drinking wells and damaged 1,357 water pumps damaged. About 80% of Shabwah Governorate lost water access, forcing some residents to drink from contaminated wadis, or formerly dry river beds. About one-third of gabions ‚Äì structures to help with flood control ‚Äì were damaged or destroyed, as were 634 dykes. Many Yemeni villages were isolated, and the entirety of Ahwar and Qaishan provinces were inaccessible within Abyan Governorate. The floods destroyed 1,820 houses, many of them washed away, and many others were damaged, leaving 22,842 families homeless. The storm washed away the topsoil or otherwise wrecked of crop fields. The storm also knocked over 37,000 fruit trees and killed 13,000 livestock, accounting for about US$100 million in agriculture damage. About 70% of arable land in Shabwah Governorate was washed away. The floods littered about of irrigation canals with sand. Many of the houses and fields were built on wadis which were swept away when water levels rose. The floods also damaged or destroyed 43 health facilities and 53 schools. Overall, 338 people were killed by the floods in Yemen, and damage was estimated at US$1.2 billion, according to the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters. However, Yemen's General Secretariat for Natural Disasters and Relief estimated damage at US$200 million, which accounted for 12% of the country's GDP. Aftermath After the worst of the floods ended, the Yemeni government created a Flood Relief High Committee to coordinate incoming aid and relief distribution. The Ministry of Health coordinated the transportation and storage of goods. Workers quickly repaired roads and airports. In Shabwah, CARE and Oxfam repaired damaged pumps and wells to restore access to clean water, and the German government sent a team to restore water access in Ma'rib Governorate. The widespread destruction of crop fields caused many tribes to abandon their ancestral land. Many of the residents left homeless either stayed with families or relatives, or resided in temporary shelters, where there were reports of malaria, typhoid, and diarrhea. The government provided building materials to rebuild houses. In the immediate aftermath, the local Red Cross chapter distributed about 1,300 blankets, 200 tents, and 200 sets of cooking tools. Stagnant waters in Yemen caused a locust outbreak in August 1996 that affected Saudi Arabia for the next three months. Officials used over of pesticide in response to the outbreak. The heavy rural damage depressed the regional economy in 1996 and 1997. On June 17, the government of Yemen issued an appeal for international aid, while also declaring four governorates as disaster areas. After the severe flooding occurred, 20 countries and various international organizations provided money or relief goods to Yemen, amounting to US$14 million. Yemen's needs were determined by a survey between officials in the Ministry of Electricity and workers in the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Several departments within the United Nations provided assistance as well toward a crop assessment, drugs, and wheat flour. The World Health Organization provided medical supplies to the country. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provided 3 million water tablets, along with cash and general supplies. The European Commission (precursor to the European Union) donated about US$186,000 to the Yemeni Red Cross, and other European countries ‚Äì France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom ‚Äì also provided assistance. Other countries in the Middle East also sent supplies to Yemen. Neighboring Oman sent 28 metric tons of food, and Qatar sent US$1.2 million worth of food, blankets, and tents. Syria sent US$5 million worth of food aid. As part of a plan toward preventing future floods, the World Bank provided US$14.5 million to rebuild roads, power and water plants, and regrowing lost crops. In the months after the floods, the government of Yemen sought help from the International Development Association to prevent future floods from being as damaging. The government created an Emergency Flood Rehabilitation Project that was geared toward more long term solutions. Thousands of farmers benefited from the improved irrigation and from the employment opportunities. Roads and bridges were rebuilt to a higher construction standard using local builders and contractors, the first such occurrence in the country using competitive bidding. The project was completed in December 2001 at a cost of US$31.59 million; the International Development Association paid US$27.44 million, and Yemen's government provided the rest of the funding.

He was Secretary of State for the Navy and the Colonies from 26 March 1943 to 10 September 1944 in Vichy France.  Life =Early career In 1908, he entered the √âcole navale. On the outbreak of the First World War he was attached to the torpedo-boat Commandant-Rivi√®re on operations against the Austro-Hungarian fleet in the Adriatic, particularly during the evacuation of the Serbian Army. He was mentioned in dispatches for his bravery in battle on the night of 22 December 1916. He commanded four submarines (Cigogne, Clorindre, Jo√´ssel and Requin) between 1918 and 1927. He commanded the surface ships Panth√®re and Lamotte- Picquet in 1927. In May 1929 he was put in command of the 11th Torpedo Boat Division in the Mediterranean on board the Alcyonand reveals himself as \\"an exceptionally talented officer and a brilliant maneuverer\\".Dictionnaire des marins fran√ßais, √âditions Maritimes et d'Outre-Mer, 1982 From 1932 to 1934 he was chief of staff of French naval staff in the Far East on board the Primauguet. From 1936 to 1938 he commanded Maill√©-Br√©z√© and a destroyer flotilla. In 1938 he became chief of staff of the maritime prefecture of Toulon. World War II From 1939 to 1941 he became chief of staff to the French naval forces in the Mediterranean fleet then chief of staff of the French naval forces of the south. During this period he was also promoted to counter admiral in 1940. His next post came in 1941, as commander of the 3rd Cruiser Division, flying his flag on La Marseillaise at Toulon. It lasted until 1942. On the Allied landings in North Africa on 13 November 1942, he tried in vain to convince Jean de Laborde, commander-in-chief of Vichy France's high seas fleet, to sail his force to Africa. At dawn on 27 November that year, when German forces arrived in the Toulon arsenal, he ordered its cruisers to scuttle themselves. In 1943, he was approached to become Vichy's Secretary of State for the Navy and the Colonies. He hesitated but decided to take it up to avoid the post falling into pro-German hands.Bernard Bl√©haut dans le livre Pas de clairon pour l'amiral, Jean Picollec (ed.), p. 62- 63, 1991. From then onwards \\"he never stopped struggling at all times against the German and Italian armistice commissions, sabotaging any work in the arsenals that would assist the enemy and saving personnel in the naval and colonial ministry from being sent to Germany. Thanks to him, naval security worked to inform the Allies and naval infrastructure was preserved\\". On 20 August 1944, he and Philippe P√©tain were arrested at Vichy by the Gestapo commander in Vichy and the German Military Police. He was taken to Sigmaringen. The new French authorities dismissed him from the navy in September 1944. Bl√©haut was part of P√©tain's inner circle when P√©tain was evacuated from Sigmaringen at the end of April 1945 ahead of the Allied advance. After crossing into Switzerland, P√©tain and his circle voluntarily surrendered at the border post at Valborde a few days later. Bl√©haut was thus imprisoned at Fresnes Prison in the suburbs of Paris. He was provisionally freed in March 1946, but he decided to flee to Switzerland rather than appear before the Haute Cour de Justice. He was found guilty of crimes against state security and of 'indignit√© nationale' by that court and condemned in his absence to 10 years' imprisonment and national degradation. He voluntarily returned to France in 1955. The decree revoking him was annulled by the Conseil d'√âtat in May 1956. In 1946, Lieutenant-Commander Andr√© Storelli, decorated with the Resistance Medal and who would later be Admiral and Chief of Staff of the French Navy (1970‚Äì1972), gave a testimony on the actions of Admiral Bl√©haut: :\\"Admiral, first of all, just as we have seen our efforts officially rewarded for having executed your orders, I affirm that you are entitled to the gratitude of the Resistance, . [...] All those who knew you and had the honor of serving you, in the difficult circumstances in which you were their leader, know that your action was only inspired by the desire to defend, within your sphere of command, what remained of our Navy capacity. None of them had to be ashamed of his actions by complying with your orders. [...] You gave them [these officers] direction and advice, either verbally or through your staff, to fight in all areas against the occupier. It was with your full consent that the Navy spontaneously and very largely made available to the resistance the means at its disposal. [...] I can assure you that you have done the maximum. [...] In addition, many adversaries, particularly suspicious of the sailors, surrounded us, and it was obvious that a more direct action would have unmasked you immediately, resulting in the immediate control by the enemy of the means valuable and effective you still had.\\".Letter from Lieutenant-Commander Andr√© Storelli to Counter Admiral Henri Bl√©haut, inserted in the court file, quoted and partially reproduced by Bernard Bl√©haut in the book Pas de clairon pour l'amiral, Jean Picollec √©diteur, p. 263 ‚Äì 266, 1991.

They were created by decree of General R√≠os Montt on 1 August 1982, though they began before that under President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a. Officially, participation was voluntary, but many were forced to join. The patrols officially stopped 29 December 1996 under the terms of the peace treaty that ended the war, though some of the network remained and was used by former members demanding compensation for their involvement. Estimates vary, but statistics generally state that around 1,000,000 people were members of the patrols at the height of the war in 1983. The members tortured and killed other villagers, sometimes at the threat of being killed themselves. Creation Most indigenous Mayans, who formed 60% of the population and the bulk of the insurgents, lived in areas known as the highlands. Between 1980 and 1981, the highlands were a war zone, as villages had organized in order to defend themselves and demand basic civil rights. To counter this, the government drew up a counterinsurgency plan. The first phase, called the pacification phase by the military, was created mainly by General Benedicto Lucas Garc√≠a, the brother of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a. It called for the complete destruction of villages considered supportive of the insurgents and for the creation of local civil defense patrols. This phase began to take effect under the rule of Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc√≠a and was implemented the rest of the way by General R√≠os Montt. The second phase of the counterinsurgency plan had a goal of reorganizing the social and cultural life of those affected by the war. These were the people living in the highlands. An article published in the magazine Revista Militar, which was based on intelligence gathered by the Guatemalan Army in 1981, suggested that the Ixil Indians, who were the first to organize and rebel, be subjected to a process of ladinoization. This process would, by suppressing characteristics that distinguished the Ixil from other cultures, destroy their culture. It would do this by, among other things, expanding the Civil Defense Patrols. Structure and function Every village in Guatemala had a patrol post at the entrance, and all members were required to report for duty. They usually served two 24-hour shifts a week, though this varied by the size of the village. Each unit consisted of 20 men who were armed with weapons varying from whips to old M1 rifles. This left their practical use as military units at not much, though they did have a strong effect on morale. One army colonel explained \\"Before, [the Indian] was Juan Pedro from a certain village. Now, in the civil patrol, he feels part of Guatemala. Every civil patrol post has its little Guatemalan flag, whether it's of paper, plastic or whatever, and he is beginning to identify with it.\\" The civil defense patrols were also responsible for keeping track of every able-bodied man in the community and for regulating traffic into and out of the community. They were very effective at this. War crimes The Civil Defense Patrols were both responsible for and the victims of war crimes. Males as young as eight years old were forced to serve in the Patrols. In addition to typical military work, members were forced to serve as laborers. Those who refused were forced to find a replacement, or they could be fined, imprisoned, beaten or even executed, all without trial. They would also be labelled as rebel sympathizers and could become the victims of paramilitary groups such as the Patrols themselves. Members of the patrols were sometimes ordered by the local commanders to torture and murder other villagers. One commission found that 90% of the 700 massacres and 100,000 disappearances had been committed by either the army or the patrols. During a particularly violent period between March 1982 and August 1983, tens of thousands of indigenous people were tortured, raped and killed, and the Patrols are suspected to have participated in some of these. Sometimes, the army forced them to carry out these actions, but other times they chose to by themselves. The patrols also severely disrupted normal life. In an attempt to destroy the Mayans' unique culture, the patrols held rallies during traditional feasts. Indians were forced to wear traditional dress that was supposed to be used only for ceremonies. They were also taught various behaviors not traditional to them, and woman were forced to join various beauty contests. They also ruined the economy, as people weren't able to leave the village without permission from the local commander. This meant that many weren't able to work on plantations, causing them to go unharvested, and people were forced to take up jobs as servants locally. Resurgence The Civil Defense Patrols were disbanded on 29 December 1996 by the Peace Accords. However, Amnesty International reported that the patrols maintained close ties with the military and, along with the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, reported that various human rights violations, most notably lynchings, continued to occur. The UN mission observed that most of these occurred areas in where the Patrols had been powerful. In 1999, the Guatemala Human Rights Commission reported that the postwar equivalent of the Patrols, the Community Security Committees, were threatening members who didn't want to join them. Residents of Chinanton and Agua Hedionda reported that former Patrols from San Andr√©s Sajcabaja were firing guns near people's homes and threatened to kill those who interfered with them. The GHRC also reported that members of the Campesino Unity Committee in El Quich√© were threatened by members of Local Security Boards, who were mostly former patrollers organized by the National Civil Police. Residents of Zacualpa received threats from the boards after being labelled as guerrillas for organizing. In 2000, the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala and the Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office began investigating the Patrol's resurgence. The UN mission focused on a particular group of Patrols called \\"The Chain\\", which operated in Xecopol, Sacabal, Xalbaquiej and Chichicastenango. The Human Rights Ombudsman's Office looked into Patrol operations in El Quich√©, Huehuetenango, Jutiapa, Chiquimula and Pet√©n. In Rabinal, Vice Mayor Lucas Tec√∫ attempted to pass a referendum to reinstate the Patrols, despite the fact that doing so would violate the Peace Accords. The coordinator for the Center for Legal Action in Human Rights in Rabinal, Mar√≠a Dolares Itzep, stated that the Patrols had returned because of the execution of three patrolmen in 1998 for a state-directed massacre in 1982. She said, \\"The ex-members here are scared and angry because of that. That is the reason activity has begun here.\\" In June 2001, the Guatemala Human Rights Commission reported more attacks by the Patrols. A peasant leader named Carlos Morales had been assaulted in Baja Verapaz. Around that time, Amnesty International reported that, \\"approximately 30 heavily armed men believed to be former civil patrollers attacked the community of Los Cimientos Chiul, in Chajul, El Quich√©. The assailants reportedly raped three women, and destroyed 86 houses, forcing 90 families to flee. The patrollers also kidnapped seven children but released them the next day. Several of the displaced families sought refuge in nearby aldea/area of San Marcos.\\" They also reported that a judge in Senahu has possibly been lynched by the Patrols. In September 2002, Amnesty International reported that Manuel Garc√≠a de la Cruz of the National Coordination of Guatemalan Widows has been founded tortured and decapitated after he had left his home to buy corn in Joyabaj. Garc√≠a had participated in training and exhumations, and Amnesty International reported that, \\"in the context of an escalation of threats and intimidation directed at human rights defenders in Guatemala, and the public resurgence of the civil patrols, forensic experts involved in exhumations of mass graves were targeted.\\" Compensation In June 2002, former patrollers began demanding financial compensation for their service in the Patrols. By August 2002, up to 20,000 former patrolmen from Mazatenango, Alta Verapaz, Quetzaltenango, Solol√°, San Marcos, El Quich√©, Chimaltenango, Jutiapa and Huehuetenango were involved. They were supposedly organized by the Association of Guatemalan Military Veterans. In August 2002, under pressure from the movement, President Alfonso Portillo stated that he supported compensation. Opponents of remunerations came from both the conservative and liberal groups in Guatemala, and included the Guatemalan Chamber of Commerce, Coordinating Committee of Commercial, Agricultural, Industrial and Financial Organizations, Guatemalan National Revolutionary Unity, Party of National Advancement, and various embassies and human rights groups. Payments were delayed multiple times, and in August and September 2002, former patrollers from Ixil, El Quich√© began blaming the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office and Rigoberta Mench√∫ Foundation for the delays. On 26 January 2003, the governor of El Quich√© reported that the funds for compensation were available but had been delayed by the Center for Legal Action in Human Rights, Guatemalan Human Rights Ombudsman's Office and Movement of Displaced Peoples of the North of Quich√©.

She also engaged in archaeology.  Life  Her father was a doctor and a co-founder of the Czech Red Cross. She studied a classic grammar school in Vy≈°kov and graduated at a grammar school in Brno in 1920. Later she attended lectures of classical archaeology (professor Hynek Vysok√Ω), history of art and esthetic (prof. Vojtƒõch Birnbaum) and history of theatre at the Faculty of Arts of Charles University in Prague. After getting her degree she gave lectures as a private associate professor of classical archaeology. She obtained her professor degree in 1946. Between 1934-1942 she published articles on theatre criticism in N√°rodn√≠ st≈ôed. Between 1943-1945 she was imprisoned by the Czech Nazi puppet government. At that time, she also converted to Catholicism and after World War II she participated in the activities of the Czech catholic circles, inspired by the Croatian Jesuit Tomislav Kolakovic. She co-worked with active Czech Catholics Oto M√°dr, Josef Zvƒõ≈ôina and others. In February 1948, she attended, as the only one of the Charles University pedagogues, the student march to Prague Castle. As this was to support the president Edvard Bene≈°, it brought her the negative attention of the Czech communists. At the first after-February meeting of the professors of the Faculty of Arts she was again the only one who protested against expulsion of the students who had participated in the march from school. She proclaimed: > I agree with the Dean as to the events of the past days. However, I missed > the statement that each community is based on its moral code. I judge the > moral code by its criteria. I wonder about the criteria that led to the > expulsion of the professors and even students. If I witnessed and > participated in the manifestations, I proclaim, that these were true > manifestations and not demonstrations, as the slogans I heard were of > neither political nor of economic character. On the contrary, they were of > moral character. If the participation in the march was the reason for the > expulsion of the students, then I wish to share their fate. After the University banned her from lecturing at the beginning of 1950s, she continued her activities. She was arrested in 1951 and in 1952 she was sentenced to 22 years of jail for espionage and high treason during the process of Ota M√°dr and his associates. The State Court in Brno was chaired by Jaroslav Nov√°k, the state prosecution was led by JUDr. Karel ƒå√≠≈æek. The process was public and there were about 1,500 people in the audience. R≈Ø≈æena Vackov√° spent in jail almost 16 years (including the custody). In prison she organised lectures for her fellow prisoners. Immediately after she was released she renewed her activities and contacts with Zvƒõ≈ôina and M√°dr. She was rehabilitated in 1969; two years later, her rehabilitiation was cancelled. Later she signed Charter 77. During the Normalization period, she organised home seminars for mainly young people and gave lectures on spirituality and art history. She died in 1982.

The campaign is preceded by ‚ÄúThe Man Your Man Could Smell Like\\" which was a television advertising campaign by Wieden+Kennedy for Old Spice. The \\"Make a Smellmitment\\" campaign retains much of the format from the previous campaign including its characters played by Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews. The content of the new campaign ads also consist of character monologues during long single shots while engaging in random activities and addressing the female audience. The inaugural commercial, titled ‚ÄúAnd So It Begins‚Äù, lasts 1:02 minutes and introduces returning Old Spice actors Isaiah Mustafa as well as Terry Crews. This advertising campaign markets Wild Collection Bearglove Men's Body Wash and Timber Bar Soap. Isaiah Mustafa and Terry Crews returned in their recurring roles from previous Old Spice advertisements. Mustafa's character (referred to as the ‚ÄúOld Spice Man‚Äù) continues to target women despite marketing hygiene products for men as it was determined that women often buy household products for men. Terry Crews also reprised his Old Spice character that targets the male audience as he is always screaming and breaking things. The theme of the campaign focuses on the contrast between the smooth-talking monologues by Isaiah Mustafa and screaming Terry Crews interrupting each other as they advertise Old Spice Timber and Bearglove respectively. The commercials usually end with the two men each holding up their respective products side by side and pointing at them with Crews repeatedly yelling ‚ÄúBearglove!‚Äù and Mustafa eventually saying ‚Äústop it‚Äù. \\"The point of it is more than just bringing two guys together. It's about helping people who think about or use Old Spice pick the scent that best fits their personality by connecting scents with the personalities of Isaiah and Terry\\", said John Sebastian, marketing director for Old Spice. Initial Commercials The initial commercial, titled ‚ÄúAnd So It Begins‚Äù, lasts 1:02 minutes and was released on August 6, 2015. The commercial was created by Jason Bagley and Craig Allen of Wieden+Kennedy Portland and directed by Tom Kuntz. The commercial opens with a monologue by Isaiah Mustafa talking to the female audience about their men and embracing nature. In one shot, Mustafa moves from a bathroom to a forest to a jewelry store before moving to a canoe and being interrupted by Terry Crews who projectiles out of the water. The two men acknowledge appearing together in a commercial at the same time with the exchange ‚ÄúGuess who?‚Äù, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs you‚Äù, ‚Äúit‚Äôs me, goodbye!‚Äù Crews stomps on the canoe, catapulting Mustafa out of the frame and screams ‚ÄúDon't use Timber, use Bearglove!‚Äù He continues screaming as he moves to a kitchen followed by the top of an erupting volcano and finally riding a motorcycle with five more of him and a tiger. To end the commercial, the motorcycle crashes into Mustafa's head as he says ‚Äústop it‚Äù and the camera closes in on the two products being held up Crews and Mustafa respectively side by side. After 3 months of being released, the video on Old Spice's YouTube channel has garnered 11.6 million views and 53,000 likes on YouTube. On September 14, 2015, 2 months after the release of the initial commercial, a complimentary video titled ‚ÄúMake a Smellmitment: Behind The Scenes‚Äù was uploaded on Old Spice's YouTube channel featuring Crews and Mustafa discussing the new campaign. Crews mentions that he knew there would be collaboration with Isaiah Mustafa eventually following constant demand from the public to have the two actors work together for Old Spice commercials. Crews also admits that he believed his role would be similar to Mustafa's as a smooth-talking ladies‚Äô man yet was surprised to find out his character would be much different. Mustafa comments on how Crews‚Äô commercials are seen as better for some because his commercials are directed at men. Terry Crews agrees by describing his character as rough and spicy while Mustafa's character is smooth and sweet. He goes on to say that the two characters ultimately complement each other. The video then has the signature ending of the campaign as the two men hold up Timber and Bearglove products side by side pointing at them. Interruption On August 13, 2015, the second video of the campaign was uploaded to Old Spice's YouTube channel, titled \\"Interruption\\". Isaiah Mustafa opened with a monologue about using Old Spice Swagger and Terry Crews suddenly appeared to interrupt Mustafa and scream ‚ÄúBearglove!‚Äù the commercial takes place in a fancy hall with Mustafa in the middle of the frame while multiple miniature images of Terry Crews appear on the borders of the screen yelling ‚ÄúBearglove!‚Äù The commercial ends with the familiar shot of Crews screaming ‚ÄúBearglove!‚Äù and Mustafa saying ‚Äústop it‚Äù. The two men hold up the Old Spice products side by side but this time Crews blocks the product Mustafa is holding up with his own product. In almost 3 months, the second commercial of the advertising campaign has garnered 3 million views and 6,727 likes on YouTube.

The Vietnamese and French community significantly recognizes him for his inflatable furniture line Aerospace. At the age of fifteen, Khanh moved to Paris, France and established himself as the most significant Vietnamese furniture designer of the 20th century. He was one of a handful of designers whose shocking products, in color and in form, were in touch with the renegade spirit of the 1960s.  Biography  During Khanh‚Äôs early adulthood he studied engineering at the National School of Bridges and Roads (1955-1958) in Paris. There, he met the beautiful and talented French fashion designer Emmanuelle. They married in 1957 and later had their daughter Atlantic Khanh. In this same year Nguyen Manh Khanh began going by the name Quasar Khanh, before he started his career in design. He currently resides back in Vietnam in the City of Ho Chi Minh.  Works  Right out of school Khanh practiced engraining with Estrees Viduct. Before Khanh designed his first solo product of an inner city car, he worked in Quebec on the Manicougan dam over the course of two years (1958-1960). In 1964, Khanh invented a car called the Quasar-Unipower or the Cube. This was manufactured for two years by the British firm Unipower in 1967-1969. A year before The Cube went into manufacturing Khanh started designing his first and only 11-piece inflatable furniture collection, Aerospace. Aerospace went into manufacturing in 1969 at Khanh‚Äôs very own manufacturing company. Today, the company Fugu Furniture, located in Puteaux, France, now produces the Aerospace line. Khanh‚Äôs inflatable furniture was a durable PVC and could withstand the rigorous activities of everyday life when not exposed to sharp objects, high heat, or to cigarette burns. For the time of this line of furniture, people wanted to ‚Äúbetter themselves‚Äù by trying new things and living a life of leisure. These pieces of furniture were youthful, fashionable, and highly desired among the pop culture, yet they were designed with a form of tradition. In 1969, an inflatable chair advertisement referred to the furniture as ‚Äòspace age comfort‚Äô. Over the years, Khanh added a line of sand molded aluminum cast furniture, and produced the Khanh Hydrair KX1 and QuasArk Q2 boat prototypes and a bamboo bicycle called bambooclette. He continued to design a variety of problem solving solutions late into his life before his death in Ho Chi Minh City on June 30, 2016.

The hippocampus is located in the medial temporal lobe (subcortical), and is an infolding of the medial temporal cortex.Gazzaniga, Michael S., Richard B. Ivry, and G. R. Mangun. \\"Chapter 9: Memory.\\" Cognitive Neuroscience: The Biology of the Mind. 4th ed. New York: W. W. Norton, 2014. 378-423. Print. The hippocampus plays an important role in the transfer of information from short- term memory to long-term memory during encoding and retrieval stages. These stages do not need to occur successively, but are, as studies seem to indicate, and they are broadly divided in the neuronal mechanisms that they require or even in the hippocampal areas that they seem to activate. According to Gazzaniga, \\"encoding is the processing of incoming information that creates memory traces to be stored.\\" There are two steps to the encoding process: \\"acquisition\\" and \\"consolidation\\". During the acquisition process, stimuli are committed to the short term memory stage. Then, consolidation is where the hippocampus along with other cortical structures stabilize an object within the long term memory stage, a process strengthening over time and time again, and is a process for from whom a number of theories have arisen to explain to as of why and how it actually works. After encoding, the hippocampus is capable of going through the retrieval process. The retrieval process consists of accessing stored information; this allows learned behaviors to experience conscious depiction and execution. Encoding and retrieval are both affected by neurodegenerative and anxiety disorders and epilepsy. Theories and reasoning=HIPER (hippocampal encoding/retrieval) model Meta-positron emission tomography (PET) analysis has lent support toward a division of the hippocampus between caudal and rostral regions. Scans have demonstrated a uniform variation in blood flow distribution within the hippocampus (and the medial temporal lobe broadly) during the separate processes of episodic encoding and retrieval. In the hippocampal encoding/retrieval (HIPER) model, episodic encoding is found to take place within the rostral region of the hippocampus whereas retrieval takes place in the caudal region. However, the divide between these regions need not be disjoint, as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has demonstrated encoding processes occurring within the caudal region. HIPER is a model resulting from and therefore a reflection of certain experimental phenomena, but cannot completely explain hippocampal encoding and retrieval on its own. Nevertheless, the model suggests a broad division of labor in encoding and retrieval, whether they involve separate regions of the hippocampus or act simultaneously or independently within a single, more inclusive process. Theta phase separation In a framework first developed by Hasselmo and colleagues, theta phase separation implies that the theta rhythm of the hippocampus occurs in cycles and various phases of the rhythm entail encoding and retrieval as separate processes. An extra-hippocampal structure, the septum, initiates and regulates the theta rhythm and its associated memory processes. GABAergic activity within the septum inhibits certain classes of CA3 cells (a region of the hippocampus), the divide often drawn between basket cells, pyramidal cells, and interneurons, to distinguish encoding from retrieval mechanisms. The study emphasizes and models the CA3 subfield of the hippocampus as a primary inducement towards encoding and retrieval. Encoding as a procedure begins when septal GABAergic inhibition is at minimum, freeing basket cells to act within CA3, and during brief dis-inhibition periods, other cells receive input: a proximal entorhinal input toward pyramidal cells and a coincident dentate gyrus input toward interneurons. On the other hand, retrieval as a procedure begins when septal GABAergic inhibition is at maximum, occluding basket cell activity and enabling pyramidal cells to signal. During this period, Oriens- Lacunosum Moleculare (O-LM) cells disambiguate memory for retrieval. CA3 is significant as it is allows auto-associative processes through a recurrent, collateral system. The theta phase separation model agrees generally with others on the significance of CA3 but is the first to attribute both the processes of encoding and retrieval to the subfield. Reconsolidation hypothesis The reconsolidation hypothesis claims that objects encoded into long term memory experience a new period of consolidation, or the time and resource expended to stabilize a memory object, upon each recollection. This is in opposition to the classical consolidation hypothesis which regards consolidation as a one-time event, following the first encoding of a memory. A memory item in this hypothesis, upon reactivation, destabilizes for a brief period and thereafter invokes the neuronal processes requisite for stabilization. The reconsolidation hypothesis has lingered since the 1960s; however, a 2000 study, entitled \\"Fear memories require protein synthesis in the amygdala for reconsolidation after retrieval\\", examining fear conditioning in rats, has provided evidence in its favor. After receiving post-retrieval an intra-amygdalar infusion of a known amnesic agent, anisomycin, rats failed to recall a rapidly learned fear memory. Hippocampal lesions formed post-retrieval affected the rats' fear conditioning in a similar manner. The reconsolidation hypothesis does not suppose that subsequent and precedent consolidation phases are necessarily identical in duration or in the neural mechanisms involved. Nevertheless, the commonality that exists in every consolidation phase is a short-lived destabilization of a memory object and a susceptibility for said object to react to amnesic agents‚Äîprincipally protein synthesis inhibitors. Morris and colleagues' experiment indicates that the reconsolidation hypothesis could apply to particular memory types such as allocentric spatial memory, which is either acquired slowly or rapidly. As implied by the authors, however, such an application is feasible only in the case of rapidly acquired spatial memory, the degree to which is influenced by how thoroughly a spatial object is trained. Hippocampal disorders that affect encoding and retrieval=Psychiatric disorders Individuals who develop hippocampal lesions often fare poorly on measures of verbal declarative memory. Tests involving the recall of paragraphs or strings of words, as cited by Bremner and colleagues, illustrate a degree of dysfunction among lesion patients proportionate to the percentage of hippocampal volume and the amount of cells lost. As precursors toward later studies that would showcase the effect of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) on the human hippocampus, animal studies have broadly demonstrated a susceptibility of the mammalian hippocampus to stressors. In particular, stressed animals develop functional deficits in memory, changes in hippocampal form, and an impairment in neurogenesis, or the ability to produce new neurons. Bremner and colleagues implemented MRI and PET neuroimaging to measure structure and function respectively and demonstrated a lower average hippocampal volume and activation among women with PTSD. The participants of the study included a population of women who had or had not experienced childhood sexual abuse, a certain subset among which developed PTSD. PET and MRI analysis indicated a 16% lower mean hippocampal volume among abused women who developed PTSD and a 19% lower mean hippocampal volume than all other populations in the experiment. Epilepsy The effect of seizures on memory are often categorized with respect to their intensity and the cortical areas they affect. Epileptic patients, especially those who suffer from temporal lobe epilepsy, often experience deficits in memory encoding and retrieval, developing anterograde and retrograde amnesia.Tan, F. (2014) Epilepsy and memory. BC Epilepsy Society, 1-12 At times, if a seizure specifically affects the hippocampus, the individual afflicted can encode memory; however, that memory rapidly extinguishes. Accompanying the onset of epilepsies is hippocampal sclerosis, also known as Ammon's horn sclerosis. Individuals afflicted suffer unilateral volume loss, as evidenced by MRI scans.Johns, P., Thom, M. (2008) Epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis: cause or effect? Neuropathology Article, 8, 16-18 Hippocampal sclerosis involves neural loss and a selective mesial temporal sclerosis (MTS) danger and is likely caused by an overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Œ±-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors by the surplus signaling of excitatory neurotransmitters. The depolarization and calcium overload experienced by overactive receptors signal the expression of cell death pathways. Disease According to the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry, Alzheimer's generally causes a reduction in tissue as well as neurodegeneration throughout the brain. Out of all areas in the brain, the hippocampus is among the first to be damaged by Alzheimer's. One study located in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry tested to see the volume changes of the hippocampus in Alzheimer's disease patients. Results showed that there was 27% less volume in the hippocampus compared with the hippocampus found in normal cognition. Lastly, the difference between the hippocampus of an Alzheimer's patient and that of a normal patient was shown through the notable loss seen in cortical grey matter in Alzheimer's. Experiment=Methods In an experiment performed by Zeineh and colleagues, ten subjects were scanned by fMRI while engaged in a face-name associative task that linked a sequence of faces unknown to the participants with the names of the individuals to whom they belonged. The hippocampus is known to play a role in the encoding of memory that associates between a face and a name. The experiment began by dividing encoding blocks, in which the participants viewed and attempted to memorize the faces paired with the names, from retrieval blocks, in which the participants were shown only the faces and asked to match them with their names. This process was completed four times. Rote rehearsal was discouraged by a distractive task administered between encoding and recall blocks. Results The results of Zeineh and colleagues' experiment suggest that encoding and retrieval activate different regions of the hippocampus. As indicated by the authors, a study of hippocampal activity as it pertains to learning and practice has unveiled some of the cortical processes of information acquisition.

In some cases the champion has the right to refuse a challenge; in others, this results in forfeiting the title. The challenge system derives from duelling and its code of honour. While many competitive sports use some form of tournament to determine champions, a challenge match is the normal way of deciding professional boxing titles and the World Chess Championship. Some racket sports clubs have a reigning champion who may be challenged by any other club member; a ladder tournament extends the challenge concept to all players, not just the reigning champion. At √©lite-level competition, there is usually some governing body which authorises and regulates challenges, such as FIDE in chess. In some cases there is a challengers' tournament, the winner of which gains the right to play the challenge round against the reigning champion; in tennis this was the case at Wimbledon until 1922 and in the Davis Cup until 1972. The FA Cup's official name remains the \\"Football Association Challenge Cup\\", although not since its second season in 1873 has the reigning champion receive a bye to the final. The Stanley Cup, as specified by its donor Lord Stanley in 1892, would be yielded by the holders losing either their regular-season league or a challenge from another league's champion. Such challenges occurred from 1893 until 1914, when interleague competition became standardised. The America's Cup is contested according to the terms of its 1887 deed of gift between yachts representing the champion yacht club and a challenging club. Since 1970, the usual practice, by mutual consent, is for an initial formal \\"challenger of record\\" replaced by the actual challenger after a qualifying tournament. However, in 1988 and 2010 there were court cases arising from non-consensual challenges. When the champion dies or otherwise vacates the title, a tournament among leading contenders may be used to crown a new champion prior to the resumption of challenges.

The patch improved the Enduro/X response in case if hundreds of executables are providing the same service. Particularly kernel is not doing thundering herd type behavior anymore by waking up all binaries waiting on queue. Now only single receiver of the service call is woken. In some workloads the Enduro/X applications gets significant boost. The test case for the patch increased the performance of the workload from the 860 seconds to 24 sec. Starting with Enduro/X version 3.1.2 production grade support for FreeBSD, IBM AIX (versions 6.1 and 7.1) and Oracle Solaris V11 is added. V3.1.2 introduced experimental support for Apple macOS and Cygwin. Under Unix platforms where Posix queues are available, they are employed so that for every ATMI server/service pair there is separate queue open and caller service chooses queue in round robin mode. As for MacOS there is no support for Posix queues in operating system, Enduro/X uses emulated Posix queues which are based on memory mapped files in tandem with Posix thread's process shared mutexes. For FreeBSD Posix queues can be polled too, thus Enduro/X on FreeBSD works in the say way as Linux with one queue- multiple servers. The polling on FreeBSD is done with help of kqueue. With version 6.0 System V queues are preferred IPC mechanisms for Unix platforms other than FreeBSD and Linux. The System V queues also gives single queue - multiple servers (SQMS) message distribution approach for effective load balancing. To load balance in SQMS mode with System V queues, XATMI server must be configured to use request address (logical channel/queue) on which all XATMI servers advertises same services. This Queue mode is available for Oracle Solaris and IBM AIX. For MacOS still emulated Posix queue are used, due to fact that it is not possible to adjust queue capacity on particular operating system. Features * Standards based APIs - SCA, The Open Group XATMI * Communication types - Synchronous, Asynchronous, Conversational, Publish/subscribe * Typed buffers ** UBF (Unified Buffer Format) which provides emulation of Tuxedo's FML/FML32 format. UBF if high performance binary protocol buffer format. Buffer is indexed by binary search on fixed data types. ** STRING buffer format. ** CARRAY (byte array) buffer format. ** JSON buffer format, automatic conversion between JSON and UBF available. ** VIEW buffer (starting from version 5.0+). This offer C structure sending between processes in cross platform way. Also this allows to map UBF fields to VIEW fields, thus helping developer quicker to develop applications, by combining UBF and VIEW buffers. * Transaction Management - Global Transactions - Two-phase commit protocol - X/Open XA ** XA interface emulation for PostgreSQL * Clustering - on peer-to-peer basis * Event broker (also called publish and subscribe messaging) * System process monitoring and self healing (pings and restarts) * SOA Service cache. XATMI services can be cached to LMDB database. Resulting that the next call to service from any local client receives results directly from cache (mainly from direct memory read). * Dynamic re-configuration * Custom server polling extensions * XATMI sub-system is able to work with out main application server daemon (ndrxd) * Main application server daemon (ndrxd) can be restarted (if crashed). When started back it enters in learning mode for some period of time, in which in gathers information about system, what services are running, etc. After learning period, it starts to do normal operations * Available tpforward() call * ATMI server threads may become clients, and can do tpcall() * ATMI call timeout reconfiguration via tptoutset() API call * Extensive logging & debugging. Enduro/X logging can be configured per binary with different log levels. As ATMI servers can be started outside of appserver, it is possible to debug them from programming IDE or with tools like valgrind. * For quality assurance project uses automated unit-testing and integration-testing * Built in ATMI service profiling. * Environment variables can be updated for XATMI server processes without full application reboot. * Generic client process monitor (cpm). Subsystem allows to start/stop/monitor client executables. At client process crashes, cpm will start it back. Massive client administration feature allows easy definition of many similar executables (with sub-section ranges) and in the same way it is very easy to manage them all together by regexp masks. * Starting with version 5.2 Enduro/X provides configuration data encryption feature, so that software which is built on top of Enduro/X may comply with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI/DSS). * Starting with version 6.0.17 for XATMI server and client processes max resident and virtual memory limit can be set. Thus when limit is reached, the processes are gracefully restarted. This particular feature is welcome in environments where vendor have delivered binaries with memory leaks, thus in production environments these limits may help temporarily cope with the situation until resolved by developer. * TMIB API for system information gathering. * NetXMS agent for monitoring client and server processes, queues, services, machine and cluster.  Performance  Several benchmarks have been made with the Enduro/X middleware and it shows that it competes with Oracle Tuxedo and ZeroMQ quite well. Enduro/X was faster than Tuxedo 30% in 56 KB data block range. Enduro/X was significantly faster than ZeroMQ in 10-20KB range. Also for test performed with RabbitMQ Enduro/X showed its strength and was ahead of the competitor. For the RPC calls, Enduro/X was several times ahead, for send only calls, RabbitMQ was bit closer to Enduro/X.  Subsystems  Enduro/X contains different sub-modules which extends the application server and middleware functionality. Queuing subsystem Enduro/X provides a queuing subsystem called TMQ (Transactional Message Queue). This facility provides persistent queues that allows applications to explicitly enqueue and dequeue messages from named queues. Queues can be ordered by message en-queue time in LIFO or FIFO order. Queues are managed by an XA compliant resource manager allowing queue operations to participate in distributed transactions. An automated queue forwarding feature is provided that will remove entries from a queue and invoke an associated Enduro/X ATMI services, placing the reply message on an associated reply queue and failed messages to failure queue. Configuration services Enduro/X offers applications to use ini file based configuration reading via special XATMI server, provided in package, named \\"cconfsrv\\". Basically via standard tpcall() user application is able to read configuration files (can be separate ini file or folder with them). Technique allows to use the sub-sections with key/value inheritance from main section. Trace logging services Enduro/X introduced new set of API function named tplog. This allows user to use the same C based high- performance debug logging facilities which Enduro/X uses internally. It is possible to redirect all logging by thread bases files. Also there are APIs for \\"request logging\\", which means that user and Enduro/X can do logging in separate files for each request (e.g. log by session id, log by username, etc.) Application Server for Go (ASG) ASG is bindings project on top of the Enduro/X. Authors considers these binding as application server for go, because Golang projects are linked statically and by default there is no such thing as components. Enduro/X allows to run separate executable binaries, which represents stateless services. These services can be reloaded on the fly without service interruption. Also platform allows to run distributed transaction processing by using Golang. Developers provides modified Oracle DB OCI8 drivers for Go, which supports XA transactions. Enduro/X ASG provides first ever distributed transaction facility for Golang..  Enduro/X Java  Enduro/X version 7.0 offers binding for Java. Full features XATMI servers and client processes may be written Java. Framework is based on multi-processing principle, so that XATMI servers and clients have its own copy of JVM. Requirements for XATMI server/service classes are minimal, thus framework may be considered as POJO application server. XA two phase commit can be used too with standard JDBC drivers. Transactions are managed by standard Enduro/X Core transaction manager to which JDBC drivers are loaded for transaction orchestration. Binding package also offer Java Linker process called exjld. It offers option to link java objects (jar files) to standard executable process with dependency to libjvm and libjava. Thus all jars may be packed in executable process, making Java software delivery simpler, now each process may contain all its dependencies, thus allowing different executables to use different versions of common jar dependencies. As server process both java executable with classpath or linked java binaries are supported, ndrxd daemon can boot both of them. Enduro/X-PHP Full client bindings are available for PHP5. Client PHP processes might compile a loadable module or compile the Enduro/X process inside the PHP. When PHP process is running as client, it must be present in Enduro/X Application environment, that could be done when application is hosted under the same user where PHP app runs (Apache or so) or for the PHP user creating a micro environment which further connects to main application server via tpbridge process. Module is available here . Enduro/X-Perl Client and server bindings are available for Perl scripting language. Perl module is available here . Acquisition The Enduro/X was acquired from ATR Baltic, Ltd by Mavimax Ltd on February, 2017 with full rights to the source code and current agreements. History Enduro/X was developed as closed source project by ATR Baltic. The development begun in December 2009 and first production customers (mainly banks) where put on the system in late 2012, at the time Enduro/X reached version 1.0. The project was open sourced in 2015, with version v2.3.2. From that event, all the development is made publicly available. Constantly new features are added with every major version release. Till version 6.0 Enduro/X was available under GNU GPLv2 license, starting from Enduro/X 6.0, project is moved to GNU AGPLv3 license. Starting with version 7.0, license is eased for middleware usage from Java and Go programming languages. The statement is that AGPL used by Enduro/X does not affect the Java or Go code which uses Enduro/X. Thanks to these changes, now Enduro/X Java and Enduro/X Go (ASG) modules now are released under LGPL v3, thus Java and Go projects may use middleware commercially with any extra license, while the support is provided commercially.

Thompson, born in Sharon, Pennsylvania, and raised in Warren, Ohio, was a Fluxus book artist, concrete poet, creator of mail art, sculptor and painter living and working in Richmond, Virginia. Hompson's chosen professional name was a nom d'art for David E. Thompson and a transposition of the letters of his name.  Early mail art, posters, pamphlets, fluxus books, and performances  An early collaborative audio performance by Davi Det Hompson was his 1969 participation in Various‚ÄîArt by Telephone, a vinyl LP compilation by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago. Museum curator David H. Katzive chose sound works by Davi Det Hompson and other notable artists of the time, including Arman, Richard Artschwager, John Baldessari, Dick Higgins, Ed Kienholz, Sol LeWitt, Claes Oldenburg, Richard Serra, Walter de Maria, and William Wegman for this exhibition. His book art pamphlets, which contained typographically experimental, enigmatic, sometimes wry or sardonic texts, were shown in one- person exhibitions at Scott-McKennis, a 1970s gallery in the Carytown West of the Boulevard section of Richmond. In 1970, he was included in the exhibition Ray Johnson: New York Correspondence School at the Whitney Museum in New York. Among his more than 30 solo shows was one at the Alexandre Iolas Gallery in Manhattan in 1972. In 1972, his exhibition P:article:s was shown at Eric Schindler Gallery in Richmond. In 1978, along with several other artists affiliated with Virginia Commonwealth University's School of the Arts, Davi Det Hompson founded Richmond's nonprofit arts organization 1708 Gallery at 1708 East Main Street in Richmond's Shockoe Bottom. Starting in 1979, he frequently collaborated with the artist Cliff Baldwin. In the summer of 1982, his work You Should See What I've Been Typing was on the cover of Art Journal magazine. In 1989, he was artist in residence at Franklin Furnace in TriBeCa, where he curated an exhibition of printed art. He participated in Art ex Libris, an international book art invitational exhibition in 1994 at Artspace Gallery in the Jackson Ward section of Richmond. His correspondence with John Bennett was published in 2011. In 2006, Hompson was part of a group show of Virginia artists in Norfolk, Virginia, and in 2015, a 1978 creation Telephone Events par Ben by George Brecht, Ken Friedman, and Hompson was performed as part of a Fluxus festival at le Centre Pompidou in Paris.  Dada, fluxus, and performance art collaborations  Hompson's affiliation with San Francisco's Bay Area Dada movement and other Fluxus artists such as the Lithuanian-born American George Maciunas, creator of Fluxus 1, was posthumously acknowledged in a review by John Held Jr. in 2010. Held wrote, \\"While the first issue of The West Bay Dadaist, continued the tradition of cut and paste newspaper clippings, the second issue featured art by Genesis P-Orridge from England, and Monte Cazzaza, both of whom collaborated in founding Industrial Records later in the decade. Fluxus artist Davi Det Hompson, Gaglione, and Mac[i]usis' brother Indian Ralph also contributed.\\" He collaborated with other artists, Matt Taggart for example, in producing videos. Lessons, which was scored by Hompson and published on November 17, 2012, was a collaboration with Taggart.  Painting and sculpture  In his later years, he turned less to conceptual and neo-Dadaist art and more to painting and sculpture, including materials of encaustic, concrete, burlap, and wood in more abstract or non-objective works. His last exhibition, which opened on October 18, 1996, and was still on view at VCU's Anderson Gallery after his heart attack and death, was an \\"installation piece and a collaborative effort with Cliff Baldwin of Brooklyn, N.Y. entitled WRDZ\\".  Special collections and retrospectives  In 1999, Virginia Commonwealth University's Anderson Gallery featured a retrospective of the works of Hompson, who died December 8, 1996, of a heart attack at age 57 at Richmond's Chippenham Hospital. Other retrospective exhibitions of his art in Richmond were at the Hand Workshop, 1708 Gallery (of which he was a member artist), and Reynolds Gallery, all in Richmond. An exhibition from February 2 to March 2, 2013, at ZieherSmith Gallery in Chelsea in Manhattan, Sure Sure Davi Det Hompson: 1976‚Äì1995, showed the evolution of his work; the show was curated by Dakin Hart with the assistance of Hompson's widow Nancy Thompson.

A total of ten people were killed and numerous people were injured. The temple chariot of Kalugasalamoorthy Temple was also burnt during the riots. The contention of the communities were over the usage of the Car streets round the temple by Nadars, which were opposed by the other communities quoting private ownership and religious sanctity. There was an elongated Court battle between the Nadars and the Ettaiyapuram Zamindar, who donated the streets to the temple. All the appeals of the Nadar seeking public ownership of the streets were rejected by the courts. The Nadars‚Äô rapid rise as a business community and their conversion to Christianity seeking higher social status lead to the mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars, reaching its peak in 1895, leading to a series of riots. The Sessions Court convicted two Nadars, named Mahalinga and Karutna and sentenced them to death on 17 August 1895, while others received 3 to 6 months. The appeal in the High Court was made by Caussanel, the French missionary, immediately in favour of the Nadars and he argued that the evidences were not properly examined by the Sessions court. The High Court overruled the verdict of the lower court and set all of the accused free. The Sivakasi riots of 1899 is considered as an aftermath to this riots. Background Kalugumalai was a village in Tinnevelly district in Madras Presidency in British India before India's independence in 1947. In modern times, the village is part of Thoothukudi district in the state of Tamil Nadu. The place has a granite hill known for three historic landmarks, namely Vettuvan Koil, Kalugumalai Jain Beds and Kalugasalamoorthy Temple. The former two were commissioned during the rule of Pandya in the 8th century and Parantaka Nedunjadaiya (768-800 CE) respectively. Kalugasalamoorthy Temple is a cave temple, whose halls were expanded during the 18th century. The images of the presiding deity was excavated from the Southwestern corner of Kalugumalai. The images were installed and the leading pillared halls were constructed during the 18th century. Kalugasalamoorthy Temple was under the control of Ettaiyapuram Zamindar under 1954. South Indian villages have the streets built around temples in concentric rectangles to enable the temple chariot movement around the temple. There type of temple chariot being made of gold or silver or wood decided the closest path the chariots would traverse in the order. The Raja gifted the village to the temple and formed four streets around the temple in rectangular fashion as with other south Indian villages to enable the temple car to pass easily. He also allocated a middle street bisecting the rectangle, for the temple priests, which had altars where the priests used to perform austerities during normal worship hours and festivals. During prominent festivals, the temple chariot was taken around the Kalugumail hills. As per official account, the village had a population of 3,800 in 1890 with 500 Nadars and 475 Maravars. As in the case with villages in South India, people resided in specific streets based on their castes. The Nadars resided in streets in the north-east, which were outside the car streets but within the longer route of temple procession round the hill. Caste politics During the 1800s, Nadars, then aspiring business community, established Kalugumalai as one of their commercial base. The Shanars, on account of their superior liquidity, wanted their social status to be on par with other communities. They changed Shanars to Nadar, meaning the ruling community. The Jesuits of Madurai were effecting religious conversions in the region. Nadars converted in large numbers to attain upward mobility, which was otherwise denied by the Hindu community. It was estimated that as many as 150,000 Nadars out of a total of 410,000 converted to Christianity by 1890. The district administration noted that the district had the risk of caste clash tensions with the Nadars seeking upward social mobility, but continuously being denied by Vellalars and the Maravars. The Nadars were denied entry to temples dominated by other caste Hindus. Some historians also believe that Nadars were successful in cotton trade in the region where other communities could not compete. By the end of the 19th century, the Nadars‚Äô rapid rise as a business community and the mutual confrontation between the Maravars and Nadars reached its peak in 1895, leading to a series of riots. During the Panguni Uthiram festival procession, the elongated conflict between two castes in the region, namely, Nadars and Maravars resulted in a riots, popularly called Kalugumalai riots. Legal proceedings During 1851, the Nadars tried to conduct a marriage procession in one of the four car streets, which was blocked by other castes. The Zamindar ruled that the Nadars can go up to the Pillaiyar temple in East Giri Street. There was another attempt made by the Nadars in 1866 when he District Collector negotiated a compromise by allowing Nadars to go in palanquins up to the Pillayar temple. There were further attempts in 1885, when the Zamindar sought legal action. He argued that the streets belonged to the temple and the temple reserved the right to allow religious processions to maintain the purity of the streets. The Nadars contended that the streets were public places where everyone had equal rights. The witnesses claimed that the Nadar procession never went beyond the north eastern altar in the past. There was also a contention about a Nadar owning a shop in one of the streets. During 1899, the Munisif ruled that the streets belonged to the temple. The case was taken to an appeal judge by the Nadars. By around this time, the Zamindar died and his juvenile heir was helped by his manager. The appeal judge ruled that the trader, Kalimuthu, who was having a house in East Car Street, recognised the rights of the temple and hence discharged the appeal. With further appeal, the Chief Justice ruled on 7 August 1899 that the temple had not dedicated the streets as public. With all legal proceedings going against them, the Nadars resorted to religious conversions to Catholics. The riots A French missionary by name Caussanel bought the same house in the East Car Street and started building a Church in the locality. When the foundation was laid, there were clashes where some Nadars were set ablaze. After official intervention, the church was built, but a protruding facade (called pandal) believed to have impeded the path of the temple car. On 7 April 1895, during the Panguni Uthiram festival of the temple, the temple chariot was drawn around the streets of Kalugumalai and it reached the East Car Street where the Pandal was protruding from the church. The Estate manager tried to convince the Nadars to remove the Pandal. As per some accounts, there was enough space for the chariot to move, but the other caste communities demanded the removal. It is unclear on who started the clash, but the Estate manager was stabbed to death along with the Munisif of Duraisaipuram village, who sustained injuries and died after a while. The caste Hindu Maravars set the church roof on fire and attacked the Nadar households. The houses and business establishments were burnt and women, children were also attacked. The press reports claimed 27 Nadars were killed, but the official numbers quoted only 20. A total of 24 people were killed, more than 100 people injured and the temple car and other property in the region were destroyed. Trial Many Nadars were arrested after the riots, but the timing of the arrests were debated. The rivals provided contrasting accounts of the events to the Munisif court, while Caussenel gave a hand-written note to the Sub-Magistrate stating that the opposing Hindu started pelting stones to initiate the events and set fire to the church. The wounded manager gave an evidence before death that he was stabbed by a Nadar. There were a total of 34 Nadars who were arrested in connection with the case. The Session Court heard both the sides' argument and ruled that Mahalinga and Karutna belonging to the Nadar side were sentenced to death on 17 August 1895, while others received 3 to 6 months. The appeal in the High Court was made by Caussanel immediately and he argued that the evidences were not properly examined by the Sessions court. The High Court overruled the verdict of the lower court and set all of the accused free. Causannel was welcomed by the Nadars from the region and he was taken in procession through Srivilliputhur and Sivakasi. Aftermath The caste fights continued in the region between Nadars and Maravars and eventually there was another riot in Sivakasi, the Sivakasi riots of 1899. The most common references to the riots are from the British official accounts. The works of Hardgrave (1969) and Susan Bayly (1989) are the most commonly referred edicts, but have been criticized for the amount of on-field work carried out. Most of the work are from published accounts and testimonies of inhabitants in the modern times. Religious prejudices favouring the Shanars who converted to Christianity is also a common accusation questioning the neutrality of the studies.

Apollon originally was founded in Smyrna in 1891 and moved to Athens in 1922 after Asia Minor Disaster. The club has got departments in football, basketball, volleyball, waterpolo and other sports. The most successful section is the football team with long presence in A Ethniki. The home stadium of the club is in Rizoupoli, a district of Athens. The club's colours are blue and white and its emblem is the ancient God Apollo. History=Apollon in Smyrna (1891-1922) Chrysostomos of Smyrna Apollon was founded in 1891. The first members from the club belonged earlier to Orpheas Smyrnis, the ancestor of Panionios. The metropolitan bishop of Smyrna Chrysostomos was among the founders of Apollon. In 1894, three years after its foundation, Apollon acquired its own stadium. A few years later the stadium moved in the Smyrni's district of Agios Tryfonas. In 1904, Apollon organised the Apollonian Games, the annual athletics games in Smyrna. Athletes of all the nations in Smyrna take part in the Games besides Turks. The football team of Apollon was founded in 1910 and it became the most popular and successful team of the club. Apollon in Athens (1922-today) The football team of Apollon in 1924 In 1922, Apollon moved to Athens as result of Asia Minor Disaster and the expulsion of Greek population from Asia Minor. The club originally settled in Columns of the Olympian Zeus. In 1923, Apollon moved to Rouf, a district in the west of Athens. In 1946 the Greek Railway Company bought the area of Apollon in Rouf. The money from the selling was used for the buying an area in Rizoupoli where the new stadium of Apollon was built. The stadium started to be built in 1947 and it inaugurated in 1948. In 2003, the stadium was named Georgios Kamaras after the name of the notable player of Apollon. Apollon was two times the finalist of the championship. Other achievements were the third place in the championship of 1963, and the presence in the final of the Greek Football Cup in 1996 when it was defeated by AEK. The Volleyball and Water Polo sections of Apollon have reached up to second division in their sports. In current season Volleyball and Water Polo team play in A2 Ethniki (2nd- tier). The basketball team had played in Beta Ethniki in 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons and now it plays in Gamma Ethniki (4th tier).

History Map of the Thracian Chersonese in Antiquity The Long Wall was actually a succession of walls on the base of the Thracian Chersonese, the first of which was built in the late 6th century b.c.e. by the Athenian magnate Miltiades the Elder. Miltiades became the ruler of the Greek city-states of the Thracian Chersonese in 555 b.c.e. Threatened by the warlike Apsinthians, the historian Herodotus (The Histories, VI.36.2) reports that \\"his first act was to wall off the isthmus of the Chersonese from the city of Cardia across to Pactya, so that the Apsinthians would not be able to harm them by invading their land\\". Herodotus recorded the length of the isthmus as 36 stadia, or approximately 7.2 km. It is unknown how long the wall of Miltiades stood, but apparently it was left derelict soon after, for in the fifth century b.c.e. it had to be rebuilt by Pericles (Plutarch, Pericles, 19.1), and was again restored in the early fourth century by the Spartan commander Dercylidas (Xenophon, Hellenica, III.2.8‚Äì10; Diodorus Siculus, Bibliotheca, XIV.38.7), to protect the peninsula from raids by the Thracian tribes. The wall continues to be mentioned by various Greek and Roman geographers throughout antiquity, but by the fourth century it was apparently in a dilapidated state; in 400, the Goths under Gainas were easily able to cross it. The wall suffered further damage in an earthquake in 447, and sometime during the reign of Zeno, probably in 480, another earthquake destroyed 40 of its towers. The wall likewise presented little obstacle to a Hunnic raid in 540. Following the devastation of the Chersonese, Emperor Justinian I ordered the comprehensive rebuilding of the wall. As described by the historian Procopius of Caesarea in his De Aedificiis, not only was the main wall strengthened and topped by breastworks and a covered portico, but it was also extended for some distance into the sea on both sides, and a permanent garrison was stationed there. These measures were effective in repelling a raid by the Kotrigurs in 559. The wall is no longer mentioned thereafter, although it was included (often erroneously located) in maps of the 15th‚Äì19th centuries. It is possible that the later Byzantine toponym Koila teichos (ŒöŒø·øñŒªŒ± œÑŒµ·øñœáŒøœÇ), mentioned also in the Partitio Romaniae of 1204 as Icalotichas, refers to the wall. Location and remains The exact location of the wall is unknown. The most likely localization is on the isthmus 5 km east of Bulair at the base of the peninsula, which is also its narrowest part and corresponds to the length mentioned by Herodotus and Xenophon. It is however possible that the various walls were built in different locations through the centuries. Thus it has been suggested that the wall of Justinian lay further east, running from the shore of the Propontis near modern Kazan Aƒüacƒ± north to Ortak√∂y and thence northwest to the mouths of the river Melas in the Gulf of Saros. The length of such a wall would make it very hard to defend, however. One 19th-century source reports remnants of the fortifications at the entrance of the peninsula, but this is nowhere else corroborated. Likewise no archaeological digs have found any remains. Remnants of walls near Kazan Aƒüacƒ± and Bolair cannot be definitely linked to the wall, although a trench near Germe Tepe has been proposed as having been part of this fortification line.

He has been identified as a \\"patriot\\", a \\"lover of home\\" and an \\"outstanding servant to his community, state and government\\". He married Eliza Clayland Tomlinson on November 14, 1807, in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. His father, James Alexander Foster, was born into an Ulster Scotch family from County Donegal in 1738 in Berkeley County, Virginia. At the end of the Revolutionary War, he and his family moved to Western Pennsylvania along with other Irish, chiefly Ulster Scotch, families. James Foster was one of the founders and original trustees of Canonsburg Academy, a school founded in 1791. William attended the academy until he was sixteen and then moved to Pittsburgh shortly after the city's incorporation along the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers. William Foster found work with the company of Denny and Bellen, \\"Dry Goods, Hardware, etc.\\" He represented the company promoted to a partner, and traveled widely.

She is best known for being an early settler of Pittsburgh and the mother of Morrison Foster and composer and lyricist Stephen Foster.  Early life  Foster lived in Wilmington, Delaware until her marriage. Her family was part of the first group of settlers on the eastern coast of Maryland. She could be considered an orphan since after her birth her father had remarried death and moved to Kentucky. She was considered as being part of \\"an aristocratic family\\". The Claylands and Tomlinsons were some of the first families that settled in that area of Delaware. Stephen Foster is assumed to have gotten his \\"poetic temperament\\" from her. Her mother's family, the Claylands were Episcopalians and had settled in America after leaving England in 1670. A biographer described the Claylands as slaveholders, wealthy and active in political and social life during the American Revolution.  Marriage and family life  Eliza Tomlinson met William Barclay Foster in Philadelphia while Eliza was staying with an aunt there. William was in the city on business after he had been promoted to a business partner position with the firm of Denny & Beelen. They married on November 14, 1807, at Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. Eliza was nineteen years old and William was twenty eight. It took the couple two weeks to travel to Pittsburgh on horseback. At this point in time, Pittsburgh was considered a frontier town and had a population of less than 3000. One biographer speculates that Eliza may have reacted to the relative unsophistication of Pittsburgh when she arrived in November 1807. It may have been a \\"a cultural shock\\" to the nineteen-year-old who was raised in East.  Children  Morrison Foster, her son, described her as \\"...the soul of purity, truth and Christian virtue. Her example shone upon her family, as the continual light from heaven. No unkind word ever passed between members of the family, for strife was repelled and anger was washed away by the stream of love.\\" She died in 1855, within a few months of William. Eliza gave birth to four daughters and five sons. Two of these died as infants and one girl died in her teens. She also raised William Jr who was an illegitimate child from another woman fathered by her husband.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/p_wfoster.html Economic hardships Eliza lived through changing economic that brought hardships upon the family when William faced the loss of property.

The firm has headquarters in Tampa, Florida and is listed on NASDAQ. The company uses a cloud-based platform for licensed independent agents to enroll customers in products provided by insurance companies which provide the actual coverage. The firm also provides billing and information services for both the clients and the agents.  Coverage  The firm provides access to a variety of coverage options, including Short-term health insurance, limited medical coverage, medical discount memberships, accident, cancer and critical illness coverage, prescription savings programs, dental and vision coverage, life insurance, AD&D; coverage, health and wellness programs, and lifestyle discounts. These products and not comprehensive health insurance. They do not provide benefits that satisfy the minimum essential coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. Despite these limitations, telemarketers who sell HII products have been frequently accused of misleading consumers into believing that HII plans are as good as or even better than \\"Obamacare\\" health insurance. In a 2017 interview with the Capitol Forum, CEO Gavin Southwell dismissed the suggestion that HII is responsible for the conduct of its call centers, stating: \\"They‚Äôre privately-owned, so they kind of are what they are.‚Äù History The company was initially run by Health Plan Intermediaries, LLC., which was owned by Naylor Group Partners, LLC. In 2011, Health Insurance Innovations agreed to purchase the units of Health Plan Intermediaries, LLC. As of September 30, 2012, the company had 51 employees. In March 2015, Michael Hershberger, Senior Vice President of Finance and Business Development, was named the interim Chief Financial Officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer. Gavin Southwell was named CEO and President in 2016. In 2018, Fortune listed Health Insurance Innovations as #1 of the Top 100 Fastest Growing Companies. In 2019, projected growth of the short-term medical insurance market and \\"healthcare policy changes of the present and future\\", such as the repealed Individual Mandate Penalty and future changes to State subsidies for Medicaid, were factored into an analysis of the firm by SeekingAlpha. Ratings and reviews HII currently has a D- rating with the Better Business Bureau due, in part, to the company's failure \\"to resolve underlying cause(s) of a pattern of complaints.\\" In the past three years, consumers have filed 295 complaints with the BBB against HII. Acquisitions In 2014, the company acquired HealthPocket Inc. for $32M, a free website for consumers to compare health insurance plans online. It includes a variety of health insurance resources such as statistics, polls, and research. In 2016, RAND Corporation included HealthPocket in their consumer healthcare decision- making research report for policymakers, industry experts, and researchers interested in web design and consumer choice. In 2018, both HealthPocket founders made a planned transition and are no longer with the company. In 2015, Health Insurance Innovations announced the acquisition of Agile Health Insurance (or AgileHealthInsurance), which sells short-term health insurance alternatives to Affordable Care Act insurance (‚ÄúACA‚Äù or Obamacare). Agile's website details prices for various private health insurance plans and allows consumers to apply for coverage online. The company is headquartered in Mountain View, CA and the current SVP and Head of Business Operations is Shaun Greene. In 2019, Health Insurance Innovations announced the acquisition of TogetherHealth (or TogetherHealth, LLC), which is a direct-to-consumer platform that connects individuals with insurance carriers through consumer acquisition and engagement.  Legal Actions  In December, 2018, the firm reached a settlement that resulted in no fines, penalties, or findings of wrongdoing with regulators in 43 states over its marketing practices. In June, 2019, two lawsuits were filed in the Federal Court alleging that the firm had misled them in the sale of insurance. The policies were issued through Simple Health, a company closed by Federal regulators in November 2018 and terminated by HII at the same time; the lawsuit alleges that Simple Health had in fact been funded by HII despite the scrutiny received by the company from insurance departments in 43 states and the FTC. Without evidence, HII has stated that the \\"[t]he FTC and the DOI investigators recognized that HII was not the party responsible for the actions of Simple Health,\\" implying that the company is not under scrutiny by regulators. The FTC has not issued any public statement clearing HII of responsibility for the fraudulent sales practices engaged in by Simple Health, nor has the agency confirmed whether or not HII is under investigation for these practices. HII has been the subject of an ongoing regulatory inquiry conducted by the Massachusetts Attorney General's office since at least June 2016. This investigation concerns \\"‚Äúthe unlawful marketing and sale in Massachusetts of health insurance and discount health plans\\" by HII as well as its distributors, including National Brokers of America, an F-rated broker that has been the target of numerous regulatory actions.

In October 2014, she waived anonymity as a complainant in a sexual abuse case to tell of her claims of being abused as a teenager by a Provisional IRA member and allegations of being subjected to an IRA internal investigation which forced her to confront her abuser. The documentary, A Woman Alone with the IRA, prompted a review of Public Prosecution Service conduct in three cases related to Cahill's allegations. In October 2015, the Labour Party announced Cahill had joined the party and she would be its candidate for election to Seanad √âireann. Cahill was elected as a Senator in November 2015 on the first count, with 122 first preferences out of 188 valid votes from Oireachtas members. In July 2018 she joined Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party , which she left in November 2019 as a result of its decision not to field a candidate in Belfast North during the 2019 United Kingdom general election. Early life and family Cahill was born in 1981 in West Belfast into a prominent republican extended family. Her great-uncle Joe Cahill was one of the founders and chief of staff of the Provisional IRA in the 1970s. She is a cousin of both Siobh√°n O'Hanlon, a prominent republican activist in the IRA and later in Sinn F√©in until her death in 2006, and her sister Eilis O'Hanlon, a political commentator for the Irish Independent and critic of both the IRA and Sinn F√©in. Cahill has also claimed her grandfather recruited Gerry Adams into the IRA. Public life Cahill was elected National Secretary of √ìgra Shinn F√©in and worked for Sinn F√©in between 1998 and 2001. Cahill was elected National Secretary of the RNU organisation during 2010 but resigned this position and left the organisation. Cahill joined the Irish Labour Party in 2015 and was a senator from November 2015 to April 2016. Cahill was an SDLP councillor from July 2018 to April 2019. Rape allegations In January 2010 Cahill went public in a Sunday Tribune interview that, between 1997 and 1998, she had been raped by an IRA member. She was aged 16‚Äì17 during this period. In October‚ÄìNovember 1999 the IRA held an internal inquiry into the matter and in March 2000 she was forced to attend a face-to-face confrontation with the IRA member. The \\"trial\\" was inconclusive. In July 2000 Cahill learned that two other women in her extended family had also accused the same man of abuse and that the IRA had also interviewed them. Shortly after her interview with the Sunday Tribune, Cahill reported her allegations to the PSNI, leading to three prosecutions brought against the alleged rapist and those alleged to have been involved in the IRA inquiry. All charges were eventually dropped and the accused rapist acquitted after Ms Cahill withdrew her evidence in May 2014, citing her loss of confidence in the conduct of the prosecutions. In October 2014, Cahill told of her objections to the IRA inquiry and loss of confidence in the prosecutions in the documentary, 'A Woman Alone with the IRA'. The documentary and public controversy prompted the Director of Public Prosecutions, Barra McGrory QC, to request a review of Public Prosecution Service's (PPS) conduct in the three cases related to Cahill's allegations. The programme has since won several awards for BBC NI Spotlight and reporter Jennifer O'Leary, including the Royal Television Society's Scoop of the Year, and an award from Amnesty International for excellent reporting in its Nations or Regions category. The former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) for England and Wales, Keir Starmer, was appointed to conduct a review of the Cahill cases. He found the Public Prosecution Service had failed all three victims. The Director of Public Prosecutions publicly apologised to Mairia Cahill in May 2015 citing 'I wish to make clear that no fault or blame attaches to Mairia Cahill. The Public Prosecution Service let you down, and for that I am sorry'. In September 2018 the Northern Ireland Police Ombudsman released a statement saying its report held that in 2000, intelligence received by CID and Special Branch was that 'Martin Morris was abusing children and the IRA were investigating it.' The Chief Constable George Hamilton issued a public apology to Cahill, and the other two victims, as did Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou Mc Donald. Cahill called Mc Donald's approach ,'woeful and inadequate.' Leaving Sinn F√©in Cahill quit Sinn F√©in in 2001 when she moved to America. She later returned and worked on two election campaigns for the party before growing dissilusioned at her treatment and leaving for good. Cahill was in 2010 a member (and National Secretary) of Republican Network for Unity (RNU), an anti-policing political pressure group. Cahill stated she joined while 'at a vulnerable period' of her life and argued against 'outside influences' while a member and left the group. Labour Senator In February 2015, Cahill received a James Larkin Thirst for Justice award from the Irish Labour Party. In November 2015, she received a Special Recognition Award in The Irish Tatler's Woman of the Year Awards. Since becoming a public figure, Cahill has written as a political commentator for the Irish Independent and Belfast Telegraph, both part of the Independent News & Media group. In October 2015, Labour Party leader Joan Burton announced Cahill had joined the party and she, along with her deputy Alan Kelly, would put her forward as the party's nominee in a by-election to Seanad √âireann's Industrial and Commercial Panel. The by-election had been occasioned by the resignation of Senator Jimmy Harte due to illness. Cahill secured the party's nomination unopposed and won the election in November 2015 on the first count, with 122 first preferences out of 188 valid votes from Oireachtas members. Cahill was criticised by Senator David Norris for failing to satisfactorily answer questions on her links to dissident republican groups and for failing to take part in media debates with other candidates. Norris later stated that she was 'an interesting and vital voice in Seanad Eireann. In a March 2016 interview with Catherine Shanahan of the Irish Examiner, Kathleen Lynch, a former Labour party TD and Minister of state, stated she had no idea as to why Cahill was chosen as the party's by-election candidate. Cahill did not contest the 2016 Seanad elections. Cahill was co-opted into an SDLP council seat in Lisburn and Castlereagh council in July 2018. She had to withdraw from the local election campaign in April 2019, due to a law requiring candidates to publish their home addresses. Cahill was unable to do so due to threats made against her. The British Government subsequently apologised. Media work She first wrote for the Irish Independent in 2014. She also writes for the Sunday Independent, interviewing Ian Bailey in mid-2020.

It is located adjacent to the intersection of Bathurst Street and Davenport Road. The site is also home to the TTC's Transit Control Centre, but the operational headquarters of the organization remain at the McBrien Building at 1900 Yonge Street. Hillcrest Complex occupies an area of about with a frontage of along Bathurst Street and along Davenport Road. History View of Hillcrest Park on south-east corner of Bathurst and Davenport, Toronto In 1922, the TTC purchased the Hillcrest Race Track to use its land for the new shop complex to replace smaller facilities inherited from the Toronto Railway Company. The TTC opened Hillcrest Complex on March 13, 1924, replacing the TRC's carshops, motor shops and stores building located at or near at Front and Frederick Streets. On June 9, the School of Instruction moved into Hillcrest. During World War II, the Hillcrest Complex participated in the war effort by producing parts for military equipment. On July 30, 1953, Toronto's first two subway cars arrived at the Hillcrest Complex. However, all subsequent deliveries of G-series subway cars were made directly to the Davisville Yard. In the 1980s, the TTC purchased land on the west side of the complex to construct the W.E.P. Duncan Building and H.C. Patten Building. In 2008 and 2020, track replacement on Bathurst Street temporarily severed the St. Clair streetcar line from the rest of the streetcar system. During those construction periods, Hillcrest was used to store streetcars for route 512 St. Clair. Railway access Hillcrest plans (as of 1960) Canadian Pacific Railway's mid-town rail line lies on the south side of the Hillcrest Complex, and the complex once had a network of standard gauge tracks and sidings for receiving railway cars. On the south and west sides of the complex, standard gauge tracks were intermixed with broader TTC gauge tracks creating four-rail dual gauge where the standard and TTC gauge tracks overlapped. (See map.) After its opening in 1924, the Hillcrest Complex received railway shipments of coal, gravel and sand for use throughout the system. Earlier, the TTC had used the Hanson Yard (inherited form the Toronto Civic Railways) for such receipts. From 1940 to the 1970s, the TTC maintained standard-gauge switcher Y-18 to shunt railway cars around the complex. The TTC converted Y-18 from former dump car W-15 which the TTC had built in 1922; Y-18 was essentially a motorized flat car on two bogies with a cab at one end. Since there was no electrical overhead wires over the standard and dual-gauge tracks, Y-18 had no overhead electrical pickup device; it took power from an electrical extension cord. Some time after the retirement of Y-18, standard gauge track disappeared from the Hillcrest Complex. However, in 2014, a railway siding was constructed on the south side of the complex to receive deliveries of new Flexity Outlook streetcars, as the 30-metre length of the new cars made transport by road from the factory impractical. At the east end of the siding, there is a ramp with TTC gauge tracks where another streetcar can pull a newly delivered Flexity streetcar from the flat car and shunt to the Harvey Shops for inspection. On January 24, 2020, the delivery of the last of 204 Flexity Outlook streetcars took place here, with streetcar 4603 arriving by rail from Bombardier's Thunder Bay plant. Buildings=D.W. Harvey Shops Flexity Outlook 4401 streetcar beside the Harvey Shops Named for D. W. Harvey and opened in 1923, the Harvey Shops handle the heavy maintenance of buses as well as high-floor streetcars such as the CLRV and ALRV. The shops occupy a space of and is divided into sections for trades such as upholstery, blacksmith and carpentry. There is also a paint shop. The building contains a transfer table to access over 50 service bays with about 25 bays on each side of the moving table. The transfer table and most of the bays are only long. So, when ALRV streetcars with a length of were introduced, an addition was built on the easternmost tracks with direct access from outdoors to allow the ALRV cars to drive through the old building crossing the transfer table into a longer wing on the northeast side of the building where they are maintained. The new Flexity streetcars cannot be maintained at the Harvey Shops because of their length of and because the shops are oriented to service the equipment under the high floors of older streetcars rather than the roof-top equipment of the low-floor streetcars. Thus, the Leslie Barns will be handling heavy maintenance for the Flexity cars. The Harvey Shops does truck and motor overhauls for streetcar and subway equipment, and it will supplement the Leslie Barns in doing such overhauls for Flexity Outlook streetcars. The Harvey Shops can rebuild buses and older streetcars by stripping the vehicles to their frames, assessing corrosion and repairing or replacing parts as needed. Parts such as, for example, a motor may be rebuilt from more than one used motor. Some parts are manufactured within the building's various shops. Outside the Harvey Shops, the TTC stores vehicles uneconomical or impractical to repair to eventually strip them for parts to be used in other vehicles. W.E.P. Duncan Building Built in 1985, and named for W. E. P. Duncan, the Duncan shop is the TTC's heavy bus maintenance facility, including rebuilds and major power plant work, to meet the needs of the bus operating divisions. The building also houses the Materials and Procurement Department. The Duncan Building replaced an obsolete bus maintenance garage in Parkdale, Toronto. H.C. Patten Building The revenue operations building is located at the northwest corner of the site at 835 Davenport Road. The building is named for H. C. Patten, General Manager of the Toronto Transportation Commission from 1939 until 1952. Opened in the 1980s, the building was designed with security in mind to handle fare media such cash, tickets, tokens, passes and transfers. Because of security, the building has few windows. J.G. Inglis Building The administrative and employment offices are in this building, which is located at the main entrance to the complex. It was named for John G. Inglis in 1991 to honour the man who pioneered the PCC streetcar. David L. Gunn Building The Transit Control Centre is named for David L. Gunn, Chief General Manager of the TTC from 1995 to 1999. The TTC's Transit Control Centre is located in the three storey Gunn Building at the northeastern corner of the Hillcrest Complex. The facility has of space containing mechanical, electrical, and computer equipment, offices and a training area. In addition to subway/SRT train control, the facility monitors traction power, security, fire safety, communications, ventilation and mechanical systems. It monitors all TTC operations including surface routes. Davenport Garage Davenport Garage is a two storey building located at the north edge of the Hillcrest Complex with road access directly from Davenport Road to its second floor. When opened in 1925, it was the main garage for all gasoline-powered TTC vehicles. Later it also served Gray Coach vehicles. On the lower level, there was a repair shop with 10 repair pits and an area for storing parts and materials for bus maintenance. On the upper level, the garage had 4 inspection pits and a wash rack. The garage closed in 1993. Streetcar Way Building , the TTC is constructing a new Streetcar Way Building to support rail bending functions which involve bending pieces of rail for curves in streetcar track. The building will have of floor space. Outside the building, there would be of space for the pre-assembly of special track work (switches, crossings and connecting curves) and the storage of equipment and materials. Streetcar Way employees currently located at the Roncesvalles and Russell carhouses would be transferred to the new building. The consolidation of way functions at Hillcrest will result in a savings of $1.8 million per year. Other buildings Others buildings include Support Services Building and Subway Operations Building. Future , the TTC was contemplating several functional changes to the Hillcrest Complex. Changes considered included: * The TTC has proposed setting up a carhouse at the Hillcrest Complex to serve the 512 St. Clair streetcar route. * The TTC may repurpose the Davenport Garage for its Training and Vehicle Engineering staff, or to set up a transit museum. * If the TTC acquires electric buses, then the TTC may maintain them at the Hillcrest Complex drawing on the expertise of existing electrical staff. * With the conversion of fare media from tickets and tokens to the electronic Presto fare card, the Patton Building's usefulness is in decline. Thus, the TTC is studying alternate uses for the building. However, the TTC still needs to allow cash fares. Proposed carhouse , the TTC proposed setting up a carhouse at the Hillcrest Complex, with a capacity for 25 streetcars. The TTC would like to have a fleet of 264 streetcars by 2024, but currently has space at the three existing carhouses for only 239. A carhouse at the Hillcrest Complex would serve the nearby 512 St. Clair streetcar route, and would eliminate about of non-revenue travel to get to the route from other carhouses. The TTC estimates that the new carhouse at Hillcrest would cost $100 million. The TTC has requested project approval in early 2021 to complete it by early 2024.

Buchanan (born April 24, 1941) is a former United States Air Force captain and fighter pilot in the Vietnam War who was shot down, captured, and spent 2,362 days as a prisoner of war in Hanoi and surrounding areas. He was one of the first American POWs to return to Vietnam after the war, and visited the man credited with his capture.  Early life  Buchanan was born in Scottsburg, Indiana, to Mary and Hubert Buchanan. He graduated from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Military service  Buchanan entered Officer Training School on February 14, 1964, earning his commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Air Force at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, on May 12, 1964. Buchanan next attended Undergraduate Pilot Training and was awarded his pilot wings at Laredo Air Force Base, Texas, in June 1965, followed by Pilot Systems Operator Training and F-4 Phantom II Combat Crew Training from June to December 1965. His next assignment was as an F-4 Pilot Systems Operator with the 16th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, from December 1965 to August 1966, followed by service as an F-4 Pilot Systems Operator with the 555th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Ubon Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand, from August 1966.  Dogfight and Ejection  Hubert Buchanan (left) and John Robertson (right) with their F-4 Phantom II On 16 September 1966, Major John L. \\"Robbie\\" Robertson, pilot, and then-First Lieutenant Buchanan, weapons systems operator, comprised the crew of the #3 aircraft (F-4C-20-MC, s/n 63-7643) in a flight of four, call sign \\"Moonglow 3\\". This was Major Robertson's 29th day in Southeast Asia and 1st Lt. Buchanan's 17th mission. The flight departed Ubon at 15:00 hours to conduct an armed reconnaissance mission against the Dap Cau Railroad and Highway Bridge located approximately southeast of K√©p Air Base, between the major cities of Hanoi and Haiphong, North Vietnam. Shortly after the flight departed Ubon, one of the Phantoms developed fuel problems and was forced to return to base. The rest of the flight continued with their mission. At 15:40, Moonglow flight was nearing their target when they were engaged in aerial combat by a flight of four MiG-17s. The Phantoms jettisoned their external ordinance before engaging the enemy fighters. As the dogfight progressed, Roscoe Epperson, a good friend of Major Robertson who was flying an air cover for another mission, recognized Robbie Robertson's voice over the radio and listened to the transmissions of the air battle. He heard Major Robertson state, \\"This is Moonglow 3, I see the MiGs. I am engaging MiGs!\\" He heard the entire battle from sighting the enemy aircraft through the dogfight. He also heard his friend report, \\"I am hit, and I'm heading for the water!\\" In the chaos of battle, no parachutes were seen and no emergency radio beepers were heard. Because of the location being deep within enemy-held territory, no search and rescue (SAR) operation was possible. At the time of loss both Robbie Robertson and Hugh Buchanan were listed missing in action. Moonglow flight had been jumped by a flight of four MiG-17s that launched from Gia Lam Air Base on the northeast edge of Hanoi. The #3 MiG was flown by North Vietnamese ace Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y, who was credited with seven kills by the end of the war. In a 1997 meeting between the North Vietnamese pilot and Ralph Wetterhahn, another friend of Robbie Robertson who was also assigned to this strike mission and flying in another flight of F4C aircraft from the 555 TFS, the following information was established. The MiGs were scrambled early in the afternoon. Nguyen Van Bay was the first one to spot the American flight far ahead of them. He asked permission to attack the Phantoms. The MiG's flight leader gave permission to give chase, but expressed doubt that they could catch the much faster American aircraft. As the MiG-17s moved toward the Phantoms, Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y saw Moonglow 3 initiate a climbing left turn. That turning maneuver allowed the MiG pilot to cut the diameter of the circle and close the distance between the opposing aircraft to to achieve an appropriate angle of attack. Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y aimed, then fired his 37mm and 23mm cannons at the Phantom. Buchanan reported to Robertson, \\"This guy's pulling right in on us. He's going to shoot any time now.\\" At that moment a salvo of orange golf ball-size rounds passed over Moonglow 3's canopies. Robbie Robertson pulled hard on the stick, then eased his turn. Hugh Buchanan saw the MiG close again. He said, \\"This is going to be it. He's corrected the problem.\\" Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y lined up, fired again and saw a wheel come out from beneath the F4's wing and sail past his canopy. For 1st Lt. Buchanan everything went black. According to the WSO, \\"It could have been from so many G forces pulling the blood away from my eyes, I'm not sure. My helmet was bouncing around - I really don't have a clear memory of ejecting, however, I do sort of have a dream - I can kind of imagine pulling the handle the F4 had between your legs.\\" He went on to say, \\"I also ejected so I must have done it. I could hear loud booms, like the canopy blowing off. And I felt the wind. The next thing I knew, my parachute was opening. When I got down low, I could see people running around on the ground in a little village. I could see a guy off to the right. He looked like he had a uniform on and a rifle and he was running in my direction.\\" Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn B·∫£y sped away from the burning Phantom, then rolled back to take a look. He watched the aircraft pitch down in flames. He made a note of seeing one parachute as he turned his attention to the remaining US aircraft. Later that day, the Foreign Broadcast Information Service in Okinawa translated a Hanoi broadcast that announced the downing of two US aircraft in the area where Moonglow 3 was lost. About a month later, Radio Hanoi announced the names of three captured Americans, one of whom was Hubert Buchanan. At that time Buchanan's status was updated from \\"Missing in Action\\" to Prisoner of War. Capture Buchanan ejected over the Red River Delta and landed in a small village where approximately 100 villagers awaited and quickly disarmed him. While some villagers were armed with rifles and machetes, most were unarmed and even fetched Buchanan drinking water. A farmer named Le Cong Su was officially credited by the North Vietnamese government for Buchanan's capture. After hours of holding Buchanan in the village, a political officer arrived to collect Buchanan from the villagers. The political officer roused the crowd to become angry and paraded Buchanan around through many villages encouraging people to be violent with him, some tried to kill him. After several hours, Buchanan was taken to Hanoi's H·ªèa L√≤ Prison also known as the \\"Hanoi Hilton.\\"  Prisoner of War  Upon arrival at the prison camp, Buchanan was taken into interrogation where political officers attempted to solicit classified information regarding future air strike targets. Interrogators used torture to extract information, but Buchanan resisted. He later remarked that his initial interrogation was remarkably similar to conditions for which he was prepared in the Air Force SERE program. Initially, Buchanan was regularly subjected to various forms of torture and beatings to illicit military secrets. Buchanan spent the first six months of captivity in solitary confinement. Buchanan was later awarded the Silver Star (second award), Legion of Merit, and Bronze Star medals for resisting the demands of his captors in the face of \\"harassment, intimidation, crulties... and torture\\"  Post-war return to Vietnam  In December 1991, Japanese television company Mirai, USA offered to send Buchanan back to Vietnam as part of an ongoing series about MIAs.

This is through the provision of long- term loans and other financial facilities to small and medium-sized entrepreneurs in the island that are in the agriculture, housing, forestry, fishery and medical industries. The ODFC will also finance citizens who have met difficulties obtaining funding from private financial institutions. Through such financial assistance, the ODFC aims to vitalize the local economy of Okinawa and aid in the development of the local society.  History  The Okinawa Development Finance Corporation was established on May 15, 1972 with the passing of the Okinawa Development Finance Corporation Law. This law was established along with Okinawa's return to Japan from American military occupation in order to carry out a unified and comprehensive policy-oriented financing in Okinawa. The ODFC's objective was also to fill the socio-economic gaps that existed between Okinawa and mainland Japan. The Law led to the consolidation of the following special public corporations into the then newly formed ODFC: * Masses Finance Corporation (Â§ßË°ÜÈáëËûçÂÖ¨Â∫´) - Founded in 1964 by the Ryukyu government to finance livelihood funds that target residents * Ryukyu Development Finance Corporation (ÁêâÁêÉÈñãÁô∫ÈáëËûçÂÖ¨Á§æ) - Founded in 1959 by the United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands to provide long term capital funds in Okinawa. * Various Ryukyu government special development accounts including: ** Industrial development funds flexibility special account ** Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries funds flexibility special account ** Housing construction funds flexibility special account ** Carrier construction funds flexibility special account , the ODFC has lent out ¬• 946.3 billion and ¬• 4.2 billion in loans and investments respectively, 211 employees and 6 Offices.

It is commonly associated with strangulation and rarely occurs in isolation. The fracture may be associated with gunshot injury, car accidents or induced vomiting. In 50% of strangulations and 27% of hangings, hyoid fractures occur.  Signs and symptoms  The main symptoms of a hyoid bone fracture include pain when the affected person rotates their neck, trouble swallowing (dysphagia), and painful swallowing (odynophagia). Other symptoms can be crepitus or tenderness over the bone, suffocation when sticking out the tongue, dyspnea, dysphonia, and subcutaneous emphysema. On laryngoscope examination, lacerations on the pharynx, bruises, swelling, and/or hyoid bone fragments can be seen. If the hyoid bone is fractured, there is a high likelihood that the larynx, pharynx, mandible, and/or cervical spine may be injured as well. Common co-occurring injuries include Le Fort III fractures, mandibular or cervical vertebra fractures, and mandibular dislocation.

Gray1194.pngAnterolateral view of head and neck. Neck trauma, commonly by strangulation, athletic activities, and car accidents, is the cause of a hyoid bone fracture. Other causes include violent vomiting, gunshot wounds, and hanging.  Diagnosis  A diagnosis can be made using clinical examination, laryngoscope examination, and/or radiographic studies. Classification Hyoid bone fractures are classified into three different types: * Inward compression fractures with outside periosteal tears * Antero- posterior compression fractures with inside periosteal tears * Avulsion fractures Treatment Treatment options vary from very conservative to aggressive. Conservative options include rest, observation, pain control, diet changes, use of a nasopharyngeal tube or oropharyngeal tube, and antibiotic therapy. More aggressive options include surgical repair of the hyoid bone and/or tracheotomy. Surgical treatment was used in 10.9% of cases in a 2012 meta-analysis.  Epidemiology  Hyoid bones fractures represent 0.002% of all fractures; they are rare because the hyoid bone is well-protected by its location in the neck behind the mandible and in front of the cervical spine, as well as its mobility. 91.3% of hyoid bone fractures occur in men.

Qiu rose through the ranks of the PLA during the civil war between the Communists and the Kuomintang. He took charge as the PLA logistics chief in 1959, and was persecuted at the beginning of the Cultural Revolution. He was later rehabilitated owing to the blessing of Zhou Enlai and Lin Biao, and elevated to the Politburo in 1969. In return, he helped to persecute Lin's enemies and consolidate Lin's power in the PLA. After Lin's flight and death in 1971, Qiu was purged and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Revolutionary years Qiu was born in Xingguo County, Jiangxi Province on April 16, 1914. He was schooled in a local sishu (private school specializing in education in Chinese classics). He joined the militia forces in his home county in 1929 at the age of fifteen. He joined the Communist Party of China in 1932. In 1934‚Äì35, he took part in the Long March. According to Qiu's autobiography, shortly before the Communists' forced exodus from their base in Jiangxi, he was almost executed by party intelligence officials who thought he possessed too much sensitive information regarding military logistics. However, on the way to his execution, he ran into Zhou Enlai, who spared his life and put him under the wing of the logistics head Ye Jizhuang. By the time the Communist forces arrived in northern Shaanxi, Qiu was tasked with logistical work, ensuring that the army had sufficient supplies. After the Chinese Civil War resumed between the Communists and Kuomintang in 1945, Qiu served in Manchuria as political commissar of the Eighth Column of Lin Biao's Fourth Field Army. Qiu, being a relatively junior officer, was not particularly close to Lin Biao at the time. He did not meet Lin in person until 1948, when Lin put him in charge of logistics of the Fourth Field Army. Qiu did work closely with Huang Yongsheng, who was commander of the Eighth Column. They participated in the Liaoshen Campaign, Pingjin Campaign, and the Hengbao Campaign. Early People's Republic After the Communists won the Civil War and established the People's Republic of China, Qiu was appointed Director of the Political Department of the South China Military Region, serving under commander Ye Jianying and deputy commander Huang Yongsheng. In 1955, Qiu was appointed deputy director and political commissar of the PLA General Logistics Department (GLD), working under director Hong Xuezhi. He also attained the rank of lieutenant general, when the PLA awarded military ranks for the first time in 1955. At the Lushan Conference in 1959, Defence Minister Peng Dehuai was purged for criticizing Mao Zedong's Great Leap Forward and replaced by Lin Biao. Hong Xuezhi was also dismissed for following Peng's lead, and Qiu was named head of the GLD. Cultural Revolution When the Cultural Revolution began in 1966, Qiu was labelled a counter-revolutionary element and targeted by the rebels in the GLD. He was subject to physical abuse and torture, fainting many times. Qiu appealed directly to Lin Biao for help, who arranged his dramatic rescue. In the early hours of 25 January 1967, Lin's men took him from the GLD compound and moved him to a safe location in the Western Hills. Qiu called the day his \\"rebirth\\". After Qiu's release, marshals Liu Bocheng, Nie Rongzhen and Ye Jianying visited Qiu as he was undergoing treatment. The senseless mistreatment of Qiu was one of a series of events that pushed marshals Nie and Ye to voice their displeasure with the Cultural Revolution during the February Countercurrent, the last serious phase of dissent in the senior ranks of the party during the movement. Zhou Enlai himself asked Qiu to be restored in his leadership position in the GLD. On Qiu, Zhou commented, \\"the logistics department is like a smaller State Council, comrade Qiu has helped me with many things.\\" In May 1967, Lin Biao appointed Qiu, together with Li Zuopeng and Wu Faxian, leaders of the \\"proletarian revolutionaries of the armed forces.\\" In return, Qiu helped to persecute Lin's enemies and consolidate Lin's power in the PLA. He authorized the torture of 462 people in the GLD, eight of whom died as a result, including lieutenant generals Fu Lianzhang and Tang Ping. He also attacked General Xiao Hua, director of the PLA General Political Department (GPD), and wreaked havoc in the GPD. At the 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1969, Qiu and many other PLA generals emerged as the main beneficiaries of the Cultural Revolution after the destruction of the old guard. Qiu was elevated to the CPC Central Committee as well as the Politburo. Qiu's political fortunes, however, were short-lived. When Lin Biao fled the country in September 1971 in an event still shrouded in mystery, Qiu was implicated by association. He was relieved of his duties on September 24, 1971, then sent to confinement in a military base in Shunyi while the authorities sorted out the consequences of the incident. Qiu was then expelled from the party in 1973. Trial, prison, and release Qiu was considered one of the main culprits of the so-called \\"Lin Biao-Jiang Qing Counter-revolutionary clique\\" and went on trial along with the Gang of Four in 1981. Of Lin Biao's inner circle, Qiu was said to have a good attitude during the proceedings, openly confessing to the charges and kneeling in front of Lt. Gen. Tang Ping's widow to seek her forgiveness. On January 25, 1981, he was sentenced to 16 years in prison (including time served since 1971). He was released in 1987 after serving his full sentence, and resettled in Xi'an where he reunited with his family and was afforded some basic benefits from the state as well as a living stipend of about 200 yuan a month. As his health worsened in 2001, he was sent to Peking Union Medical College Hospital for treatment, and died there in 2002. Autobiography Qiu wrote an autobiography, released in Hong Kong in 2012, which includes details on the intrigues of the Cultural Revolution and his relationship with Lin Biao. In it, Qiu portrays himself as a bulwark against the political machinations and ambitions of Jiang Qing.

Education Gore studied at MIT in the late 1990s as an undergraduate, and received his PhD from the University of California, Berkeley in 2005 with a Hertz Graduate Fellowship. His dissertation research was done in the laboratory of Carlos Bustamante, and focused on single-molecule biophysics. Academic career and research Gore worked as a Pappalardo Fellow at MIT's physics department for three years, until January 2010, when he became an assistant professor there. In 2013, he published a study in which he and Alvaro Sanchez combined yeast cells that could break down table sugar normally with \\"cheated\\" off of other cells because they could not produce the enzymes that break down table sugar. The study found that the colonies containing both \\"cheaters\\" and normal cells grew almost the same size as the groups with only normal cells, but only in benign environments; when the researchers took away some of the colonies' sugar supply, all of the mixed groups became extinct. Activism Gore's anti-penny activism first came to public attention when he posted a calculation of the cost of the penny to Americans in terms of wasted time ($5 billion) while a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the founder of the organization \\"Citizens to Retire the Penny\\", through which he advocates for the elimination of the penny.

In Berlin he worked closely with Issai Schur. In 1934 Schiffer had his first mathematical publication. After the National Socialist regime removed Schur and many others from their academic posts, Schiffer, as a Jew, immigrated to British- controlled Palestine. On the basis of his 1934 mathematical publication, Schiffer received from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem his master's degree in 1934. He received there his doctorate in 1938 under Michael Fekete with thesis Conformal representation and univalent functions. In his dissertation he introduced the \\"Schiffer variation\\", a variational method for handling geometric problems in complex analysis. (He also introduced another important variational method.) In September 1952, he became a professor at Stanford University,Memorial Resolution, Menahem Max Schiffer (1911‚Äì1997), Stanford University as part of a Jewish refugee group of outstanding mathematical analysts, including George P√≥lya, Charles Loewner, Stefan Bergman, and G√°bor Szeg≈ë. With Paul Garabedian, Schiffer worked on the Bieberbach conjecture with a proof in 1955 of the special case n=4. He was a speaker (but not in the category of an Invited Speaker) at the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in 1950 at Cambridge, Massachusetts, and was a plenary speaker at the ICM in 1958 at Edinburgh with plenary address Extremum Problems and Variational Methods in Conformal Mapping. In 1970 he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. He retired from Stanford University as professor emeritus in 1977.

Born in Tennessee, he was brought to the territory by his \\"master\\", from whom he bought his freedom with cash earned chiefly from his expertise with the fiddle or violin. Southworth lived or worked near Monroe, Jacksonville, and Buena Vista before settling along a small tributary of the Alsea River, where he farmed and engaged in other enterprises and civic undertakings. After his wife died in 1901, Southworth bought a house in Corvallis, where he lived for the rest of his life. Southworth was the first African-American member of the Oregon militia. Southworth Creek, a small tributary of the Alsea River, is named in his honor. Slave In 1853, James Southworth, a Tennessee slave owner, had brought Southworth to the Oregon Territory as property. Slavery was not legal in the territory, and African Americans were prohibited from settling there. Efforts to discourage former slaves and their descendants from moving to Oregon continued through at least 1926, when a clause in the state constitution that made it illegal for African Americans to live in Oregon was repealed. Despite restrictions, James Southworth brought Lewis to Oregon and continued to regard him as his property. In 1854 Lewis Southworth settled on an abandoned donation land claim near Monroe, in Lane County. Another pioneer, Benjamin Richardson, allowed him to live there on a claim that Richardson‚Äôs son no longer wanted. According to an article in The Old Time Herald, James Southworth, thought to be cash-poor, lived with Lewis on the Richardson claim. Shortly thereafter, Lewis traveled to the gold fields near Jacksonville, where he earned $300 that he remitted to James in partial payment for his freedom. While returning from Jacksonville to Monroe, Lewis encountered soldiers fighting in the Rogue River Wars who threatened to confiscate his rifle. To avoid proceeding unarmed through dangerous places, Southworth joined the militia but was subsequently wounded in a skirmish in 1856. He was the first African-American member of the Oregon militia. Soon the James Southworth family moved again, this time to California to try gold mining, taking Lewis with them. While mining in Yreka, Lewis found fiddle playing more lucrative than looking for gold, and he subsequently taught violin and played for dance schools in Yreka and in Virginia City, Nevada. In this way, Lewis earned enough to pay James Southworth another $700 to be set free in 1858 or 1859. After Lewis bought his freedom, James Southworth circulated a petition in Lane Country, Oregon, to protect \\"slave property.\\" The petition made its way to the state legislature, but was not adopted. Independent land owner Lewis Southworth returned to Oregon, and by 1870 he was running a livery stable in Buena Vista and working as a blacksmith. He married Mary Cooper in 1873 and helped raise her adopted son, Alvin McCleary. Under provisions of the Homestead Act of 1862, Southworth acquired a land grant near the Alsea River upstream of Waldport, where he farmed, fished, hunted, built a sawmill, became active in community affairs, and played the fiddle for dances. He donated land for a school near Waldport and served as a chairman of the school board. After Cooper died in 1901, Southworth moved to Corvallis, where he bought and lived in a house at the corner of Southwest Fourth Street and Adams Avenue. He died in 1917 and is buried in Corvallis' Crystal Springs Cemetery next to his wife. The tributary along which Southworth lived near Waldport was until 2000 officially known as Darkey Creek. On the recommendation of the Oregon Geographic Names Board, it was changed by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names to Southworth Creek in 2000 in honor of Southworth.

Bioarchaeology aims to understand populations through the analysis of human skeletal remains and this application of bioarchaeology specifically aims to understand medieval populations.  Non-specific stress indicators = Dental non- specific stress indicators  Enamel hypoplasia = Linear enamel hypoplasias are examples of periods of stress or disruption in a child's health where horizontal bands form on the teeth that can be examined macroscopically and represent a localized decrease in enamel thickness. Enamel hypoplasias are used in bioarchaeological research as markers of childhood physiological stress.Teeth displaying enamel hypoplasia lines Justyna Jolanta Miszkiewicz, from the University of Kent, studied linear enamel hypoplasia and age-at-death in the medieval population of Canterbury, UK. She specifically focused on the populations at St. Gregory's Priory and Cemetery. She found 374 teeth with linear enamel hypoplasia in either the mandibular or maxillary permanent teeth. She also found that there were significantly greater frequency of linear enamel hypoplasia in the cemetery compared to the Priory. The mean number of teeth with lLinear enamel hypoplasia in the cemetery was 17.6 and the mean number at the Priory was 7.9. This study also measured age- at-death of the individuals as well as what types of social groups they represented. The results indicated that childhood stress might reflect adult mortality and that the health of individuals from diverse social backgrounds can be assessed using linear enamel hypoplasia analysis.  Skeletal non- specific stress indicators  Porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia = Porotic hyperostosis is a pathological condition affecting the cranial vault. It is characterized by porosities in the outer table of the cranial vault or orbital roof. When porosities are exhibited in the orbital roof it is called cribra orbitalia. Since the 1950s, the most widely accepted probable cause of porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia is chronic iron-deficiency anemia. While dietary deficiencies are the most probable cause, other possibilities include nutrients lost to intestinal parasites. Anne L. Grauer, Professor of Anthropology at Loyola University Chicago, assessed the presence of porotic hyperostosis and periosteal reactions in the population (n=1,014) from St. Helen-on-the-Walls in York, England. She used porotic hyperostosis and periosteal reactions to examine health and disease in urban medieval England. Grauer discovered that 58% of the population displayed evidence of porotic hyperostosis and 21.5% displayed evidence of periosteal reactions. leftthumbCribra orbitalia in a young child. In 2002, J. Piontek and T. Kozlowski, from the Adam Mickiewicz University and Nicholas Copernicus University, respectively, studied that frequency of cribra orbitalia in Medieval Polish populations. The purpose of this study was to present data on the frequency of cribra orbitalia in skulls of children from a cemetery in Gruczno, Poland and compare these results with the frequency of cribra orbitalia in adult populations. They found frequencies of 47.1% of cribra orbitalia in children aged 0‚Äì7 at death and frequencies of 50% in children who died between ages 7 and 15. The authors concluded that the living conditions of the medieval populations in Gruczno did not necessarily guarantee the good health of children and adolescents due to the exposure of pathological factors that disturbed their growth and development. = Harris lines = Harris lines are stress indicators on the skeleton that form due to malnutrition, disease, or other stress factors during childhood. During this time, bone growth is temporarily stopped or slowed down but bone mineralization will continue. Once the stress has decreased or stopped, bone growth will resume, which results in a line of increased mineral density that can be seen in radiographs. If there is no recovery from stress, no line will be formed. Ameen et al. (2005) studied the incidence of Harris lines in medieval populations from Berne, Switzerland. the scholars from the University Hospital of Berne collected radiographs of the tibia from 112 well-preserved skeletons that lived during the 8th-15th centuries. They also compared their results with the radiographs of 138 living patients in the same geographic region. They found evidence of Harris lines in 88 of the 112 (80%) medieval skeletons and in 28 of 138 (20%) of the living individuals. In both populations, Harris lines were found at age 2 and between ages 8 and 12. The occurrence of Harris lines was associated with degenerative bone disease, trauma, osteoporosis, peripheral vascular diseases, rickets, rheumatoid arthritis, and bony deformities. The authors concluded that the medieval populations in Switzerland probably experienced difficult living situations and poor hygienic conditions and the Harris lines in children of the population reflected poor care and neglect.  Mechanical stress and activity indicators  Bioarchaeologists can study the effects that activities and workload have on the skeleton in order to understand the kinds of labor that people were doing in the past. Stress markers can also indicate patterns in the division of labor and how certain activities were structured within society. Wolff's law states that bones are affected and remodeled by repetitive physical activity or inactivity. Mechanical stress changes the cross-sections of bones and may, to a limited extent change entheses, while prolonged inactivity can lead to bone loss.  Injury and workload  Amanda Agnew and Hedy Justus, from the Ohio State University, studied examples of trauma and stress in the population of Medieval Giecz in Poland. During this time, Giecz was an important political and religious center. The sample included 275 burials that were analyzed for trauma and stress, but only adults were analyzed for trauma. Most cases of trauma were non-violent, although 3.4% of individuals with trauma had injuries that were clearly due to violent intent. The low evidence of intentional violence led the authors to conclude the unlikelihood of members of the population being involved in military activity, which was common in the area. However, the stress-related traumatic injuries indicated a population that had a very laborious lifestyle, often associated with agricultural activities. For example, the population exhibited a high frequency of spinal trauma, including compression fractures and spondylolysis. Vertebral trauma is indicative of heavy compression loads over long periods of time. The authors also studied osteochondritis dissecans, which can be caused by repetitive traumatic events and the overuse of joints due to physical activity. The study concluded that heavy workload and strenuous activities extended to males, females, and adolescents. Furthermore, the authors found that the population at Giecz experienced stressful environmental conditions like poor nutrition and infections.  Diet and dental health  Diet is an important area of study for bioarchaeologists because it can reveal many aspects of an individual and the population. The types of foods that were produced and eaten can yield information on how society was structured, on various settlement patterns, and on how healthy or unhealthy the population was. Diet is studied through a variety of methods. Bioarchaeologists can examine teeth and look for the presence or absence of dental caries (cavities), use tooth wear analysis, or they can use stable isotope analysis, specifically through carbon and nitrogen isotopes.  Dental caries  Dental caries is the scientific term for cavities or tooth decay as a result of bacteria fermenting carbohydrates in the mouth. Caries is associated with poor cleaning of the mouth and receding gums that expose the roots of teeth. A study done on the frequency of dental caries in a medieval populatCon in Southwest France was done by researchers at the Universit√© Paul-Sabatier. They studied 58 adults, both men and women, and found the prevalence of dental caries to be 17.46% with the most frequent types of caries being occlusal or proximal. Additionally, caries was mostly found on the second and third molars in both maxillary and mandibular teeth. The study found no statistically significant difference between the frequencies of caries in men and women but noted that the low levels of caries found overall was most likely due to attrition and noncariogenic foods.  Stable isotope analysis  Stable isotope analysis allows bioarchaeologists to study diet and migration in populations. Analysis of carbon and nitrogen in bone collagen yields information about diet and nutrition while the analysis of strontium and oxygen can reveal migration patterns of individuals.Mays, Simon. The Archaeology of Human Bones. 1998. Second ed. New York: Routledge, 2010. 2010 . Isotope analyzing can be used to study the food source through Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values, as a higher in Œ¥15N is an indication of higher reliability on aquatic food source compared to land-based food source.Oxygen signatures can get into teeth before an individual reaches 12 years of age through the consumption of ground water. These signatures differ from area to area and the oxygen's signatures in teeth can be compared to signatures in ground water from different regions. Anna Linderholm and Anna Kjellstr√∂m, from Stockholm University in Sweden, studied approximately 800 individuals from several medieval cemeteries in Sigtuna, Sweden, to understand social differences between them. One portion of the study was dedicated to using stable isotope analysis on individuals to reveal any dietary differences related to class. The authors used stable isotope analysis on a total of 25 individuals and five animals to aid in their understanding of social differences at these sites. Six of the individuals came from a cemetery on the outskirts of a churchyard where many victims expressed signs of leprosy. This location suggests that these individuals belonged to a lower social stratum. Their results indicated no significant differences in Œ¥13C and Œ¥15N values which means that the individuals buried in the \\"healthy\\" regions and those buried in the \\"unhealthy\\" regions appeared to have had similar diets. In 2013, Kristina Killgrove, a classicist and bioarchaeologist, studied individuals from a medieval cemetery site in Berlin, Germany. The cemetery, known as Petriplatz, contained over 3,000 individuals who were buried between the mid-13th century and the mid-18th century. The cemetery was excavated by directors Claudia Melisch and Jamie Sewell between 2007 and 2010. Killgrove analyzed the first molars of 22 individuals from roughly 1200-1300 A.D. and found that three of the individuals showed strontium levels that are two standard deviations outside of the local range. Killgrove concluded that it is possible that two of the individuals migrated to Berlin from west-central Germany and the other migrated from south-central Germany.

The Italo-Turkish War would go on until October 18, 1912. The Italian fleet appeared off Tripoli in the evening of September 28, but only began bombarding the port on October 3. The city was conquered by 1,500 sailors, much to the enthusiasm of the interventionist minority in Italy. Another proposal for a diplomatic settlement was rejected by the Italians, and the Turks determined therefore to defend the province. As a result of this conflict, Italy captured Ottoman Tripolitania. These territories together formed what became known as Italian Libya. During the conflict, Italian forces also occupied the Dodecanese islands in the Aegean Sea.

In 2011, she was awarded the Presidential Early Career Awards for Scientists and Engineers (PECASE), the highest honor given by the United States to scientists who are in the early stages of their research careers, for her contributions to the study of neutrinos and her work in promoting STEM fields to women. In 2013, she was named by the BBC as one of the top ten women scientists in Latin America.  Early life  Mayly S√°nchez was born in Caracas, Venezuela on June 26, 1972. Her interest and passion for science began at an early age, after watching the 1980 television series \\"Cosmos\\". Due to this, she became passionate about astronomy and even asked for books about astronomy for her 12th birthday. As a result of this interest, her uncle told her that if she wanted to know more about astronomy, she would need to also study physics. At the age of 13, she relocated with her family to M√©rida, Venezuela. Here, she attended high school at the Colegio F√°tima, an all-girls Catholic school. While in high school, her focus eventually shifted from astronomy to physics, thanks to the help of her mathematics and physics teachers.  Education  After graduating high school, S√°nchez went on to study at Universidad de Los Andes, ULA in M√©rida where she earned her BS in Physics in 1995. Here is where her interest shifted from astronomy and physics towards a more concentrated focus on fundamental physics. Following this, she won a scholarship for postgraduate work at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy where she earned her diploma in high energy physics in 1996. Following the completion of her one-year program, she moved to the Boston, Massachusetts to complete a Masters of Science degree at Tufts University. In 1998, she earned an MSc in Physics and then completed her PhD in Physics in 2003. It was during this time that her passion once again narrowed down, this time her focus being on neutrinos. Her doctoral dissertation was titled ‚ÄúOscillation Analysis of Atmospheric Neutrinos in Soudan 2‚Äù.  Career  After graduation, S√°nchez worked as postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University, where she continued working in experimental physics on fundamental particles, particularly neutrinos. During this time she also joined the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search (MINOS) team at Fermilab. In 2007 she was hired as assistant physicist at the US Energy Department's Argonne National Laboratory, where she continues to work today. In 2009 she also joined the faculty of Iowa State University, where she is now a Professor of Physics and Astronomy and Cassling Family Professor, earning tenure in 2013. She is also an adviser and mentor to many female students, leading the Iowa State University Undergraduate Women in Physics group and Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics. Her research is part of the Long Baseline Neutrino Experiment (DUNE), which is planned to send an intense beam of neutrinos from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia, Illinois to a detector located at the Homestake Mine in South Dakota. The experiment is designed to help scientists understand how the universe formed and why neutrinos change form, especially when they pass through rock. S√°nchez is also working on the Main Injector Neutrino Oscillation Search and NOŒΩA experiments designed to study neutrino oscillations sent from Fermilab detectors in northern Minnesota, and she is a spokesperson of the Accelerator Neutrino Neutron Interaction Experiment (ANNIE) at Fermilab. In 2012, the White House announced that S√°nchez was one of the 2011 PECASE Award winners, which is the highest award granted by the United States to young scientists beginning their careers. In 2013, she was named by the BBC as one of the top ten women scientists in Latin America. Her current work also includes the development of the next generation of the photodetectors, which are used in the detection of neutrinos but can also be used in medical imaging and other applications. This work is to make detectors less expensive and more effective.

It is part of the first fortified belt of forts of Metz and had its baptism of fire in late 1944, in the Battle of Metz.  Historical context  The first fortified belt of Metz consists of forts Fort Saint-Privat (1870), Fort de Queuleu (1867), Fort Bordes (1870), Fort de Saint-Julien (1867), Fort Gambetta, Fort D√©roul√®de, Fort Decaen, Fort de Plappeville (1867) and Group Fortifications of Saint-Quentin (1867), most of them unfinished in 1870, when the Franco-Prussian War broke out. During the Annexation Metz, oscillated between a German garrison of 15,000 and 20,000 men at the beginning of the period, and will exceed 25,000 men just before the First World War. Gradually Metz becomes the premier stronghold of the German Reich.  Construction and facilities  The Feste Kameke is designed in the spirit of the \\"detached forts\\" concept developed by Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The fort was built by German engineers between 1876 and 1879.  Successive assignments  From 1890 the stationing of the garrison is guaranteed by the fort troops Corps XVI stationed at Metz and Thionville. Invested by the French army in 1919, the fort Kameke is renamed \\"fort D√©roul√®de\\". It was taken again in 1940 by the Germans. The German army occupied the fort during 1940‚Äì1944. After the war, the fort was taken over by the French army. Until 2002, the fort served as a repository of chemical weapons, bombs or unexploded shell of phosgene or sulfur mustard, mainly dating from World War I. The fort is now not used.  World War II  In early September 1944 the Battle of Metz began. The German command integrated the defensive system set up around Metz. On 2 September 1944, Metz was declared a Hitler Reich fortress. The fortress must be defended to the last by German troops, whose leaders were all sworn to the F√ºhrer. The next day, 3 September 1944, the troops of General Krause took position on a line from Pagny-sur-Moselle to Mondelange, passing to the west of Metz by Chambley, Mars-la-Tour, Jarny and Briey. After an initial withdrawal on 6 September 1944, the German lines now rest firmly on the forts of Metz. The US offensive, launched 7 September 1944, on the western line of the forts of Metz, was cut short. American troops stopped at the Moselle, despite taking two bridgeheads to the south of Metz. The forts being better defended than they had thought, US troops were figuratively out of breath. General McLain, in agreement with the General Walker, decided to suspend the attacks, pending new plans from the General Staff of the 90th Infantry Division. When hostilities resumed after a rainy month, the soldiers of the 462 Volks- Grenadier-Division still firmly held the forts of Metz, though supply lines were more difficult under artillery fire and frequent bombings. On 9 November 1944, as a prelude to the assault on Metz, as many as 1,299 heavy bombers, B-17s and B-24s, dump 3,753 tons of bombs, and 1,000 to 2,000 \\"livres\\" on fortifications and strategic points in the combat zone of IIIrd Army. Most bombers dropped bombs without visibility at over 20,000 feet and miss their objectives. In Metz, 689 loads of bombs drop over the seven forts of Metz, designated as priority targets, merely causing collateral damage. At Thionville and at Saarbr√ºcken the result is inconclusive, proving once again the inadequacy of massive bombings on fortified targets. On 15 November 1944, on a cool, damp morning, 377th Infantry Regiment of 95th American division, leaves Maizi√®res-l√®s-Metz, entering the north of Metz in Woippy before being stopped by gunfire from fort D√©roul√®de (Kameke), Gambetta (Hindersin), and Saint-Julien (Manteuffel). Facing them, giving desperate resistance, are the men of 1515 Grenadier-Regiment \\" St√∂ssel \\" of the 462th Volks-Grenadier- Division, reinforced by a reserve company, the 38th SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment. On 17 November 1944, all the forts held by German troops, in the northwest sector of Metz, are encircled. On 21 November 1944, 377th Infantry Regiment of 95th US division invests the old fort Kameke The fort Jeanne-d‚ÄôArc was the last of the forts of Metz to surrender. Determined German resistance, bad weather and floods, inopportunity, and a general tendency to underestimate the firepower of the fortifications of Metz, have helped slow the US offensive, giving the opportunity to the German Army to withdraw in good order to the Saar. The objective of the German staff, which was to stall US troops for the longest possible time before they could reach the Siegfried Line, was largely achieved.
