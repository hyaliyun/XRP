His screenplays for Tall, Dark and Handsome (1941) and Ben-Hur (1959) were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Best Adapted Screenplay, respectively. Life and career Born in Spokane, Washington, Tunberg's earliest writings included short stories, and a novel entitled While the Crowd Cheers, which was published in 1935 by the Macaulay Company. Very soon, Karl Tunberg's story-telling talents were noticed by movie studios, and he was employed to write screenplays. Starting in 1937 Karl was on contract as a screenwriter for Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation under Darryl Zanuck. In the early 1940s Karl Tunberg moved his seat of operations to Paramount Pictures. In the first phase of his career Tunberg typically collaborated with other writers, especially with Darrell Ware, a deft composer of musical comedies. Eventually (in the later 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s) Tunberg worked more frequently on his own. His first feature film was You Can't Have Everything (1937), after which he provided scripts for several comedies and musicals featuring such stars as Betty Grable, Sonja Henie, Deanna Durbin, Dorothy Lamour and Shirley Temple. Among his credits are My Gal Sal (1942), Standing Room Only (1944), Kitty (1945) both with Paulette Goddard, Because You're Mine (1952), Valley of the Kings (1954), Beau Brummell (1954), The Seventh Sin (1957), Count Your Blessings (1958), Libel (1959). He is perhaps best known for Ben Hur (1959). As noted in many contemporary sources, in addition to Tunberg, who had written the first script for the project more than five years before the start of principal photography, Christopher Fry and Gore Vidal contributed to the screenplay during filming. Maxwell Anderson and S.N. Behrman are also mentioned as contributing writers in the film‚Äôs commemorative booklet. The film's final onscreen writing credits created controversy when, in October 1959, the Writers Guild of America (WGA) awarded Tunberg sole screenplay credit, despite the objections of the film's director, William Wyler, who, in the film's commemorative booklet and elsewhere, claimed that Christopher Fry was more responsible than any other writer for the final screenplay. In response to Wyler's public outcries against their ruling, the WGA took out trade paper ads on November 20, 1959 in which they issued a statement reading, in part, \\"the unanimous decision of the three judges was that the sole screenplay credit was awarded to Karl Tunberg...The record shows the following: 1. Karl Tunberg is the only writer who has ever written a complete screenplay on Ben-Hur; 2. Karl Tunberg continued to contribute materials throughout the actual filming, and this material is incorporated in the final picture; and 3. Karl Tunberg alone did the necessary rewriting during the four months of retakes and added scenes. Mr. Christopher Fry himself was fully informed of the proceedings of the Guild. He has made it absolutely clear that he did not want to protest the decision of the Guild.\\" Karl Tunberg occasionally functioned as producer as well as writer ‚Äì as in the case of The Imperfect Lady (1947) and Count Your Blessings (1958). In the 1960s, Tunberg also wrote screenplays for two major MGM productions, I Thank a Fool (1962) and Where Were You When the Lights Went Out? (1967). Tunberg was nominated for two Academy Awards. In the early 1970s Karl Tunberg began writing segments for television series, but he used to tell family and friends that his favorite medium was always the large-screen motion picture. Tunberg died in London in April 1992 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium.

It was based on the novel The Strange Case of Mr Pelham by Anthony Armstrong, and is a variation on the Jekyll and Hyde story. In 2011 Moore said his role in the film was his favourite. \\"It was a film I actually got to act in, rather than just being all white teeth and flippant and heroic.\\" Plot While driving home from his London office in his Rover P5B, Harold Pelham, a director of Freeman, Pelham & Dawson, a marine technology company and very conservative creature of habit, seems to undergo a sudden personality change and starts to drive both fast and recklessly on his way home, imagining himself in a sports car, and ending in a serious high-speed crash. On the operating table he briefly suffers clinical death, after which there briefly appear to be two heartbeats on the monitor. After he recovers from the accident Pelham notices odd things occurring and people acting strangely, and he gradually finds his life in turmoil. Friends, colleagues and acquaintances claim to have seen him in places where he has no memory of being or doing things he can't recall, involving behaving in rash ways quite unlike his usual character. When he gets home from work, a friend is at his house for a drink which he doesn't recall arranging, and an attractive girl at the company swimming pool casts him a knowing glance. At bedtime he and his wife have a somewhat tense but amicable discussion about their recent lack of a love life. His wife also notices a mysterious silver car (a Lamborghini Islero) which she sees parked outside their house, but gives it no further thought. The driver of the car is then seen lighting a cigarette and snapping the match stick in half after he blows it out, exactly as Pelham does. There seems to be a spy at work trying to force a merger with a rival company. Pelham drives to the research and development centre in Rugby to try and see where the leak began. Soon he suspects there is a \\"double\\" masquerading as him. On a night out at the company club with his wife, he hopes to energise their relationship by indulging her request to go gambling, but he is tense and clearly not interested. As they are about to leave he bumps into the attractive girl, who sees his wife a short distance away and says \\"I didn't know you were married.\\" His wife notices the exchange and is furious, suspecting the worst. She threatens to leave him. He finds out where the girl lives and confronts her; confused, she makes it clear that \\"he\\" was having an affair with her. He angrily denies the affair; the woman, hurt and almost hysterical, yells at him to leave. At his usual the barber‚Äòs he is told, \\"I cut your hair yesterday\\". At work Pelham finds out that apparently he was supporting a merger that he now opposes with the board. He confronts an executive of the other company, who explains how the two of them had clandestinely arranged the deal in a series of meetings, to \\"his\\" (the double's) benefit as well as the company's, when \\"he\\" revealed a \\"top secret\\" technology breakthrough his company was about to make. When he confronts the rival firm (run by Ashton) he is reminded of three secret meetings: at the top of The Monument; in the London Planetarium; and in a boat on The Serpentine. He phones home and due to a misunderstanding, his butler Luigi thinks he is asking for Mr Pelham. Luigi says \\"I will just get him\\". He drives home quickly. Distraught and unable to explain the unfolding events, he consults a psychiatrist, Dr Harris, and undergoes extended treatment in his clinic, where Harris explains that he doesn't believe Pelham is mad but perhaps was acting out of a subconscious desire to break out of his obsessively rigid lifestyle. He agrees to be admitted to the psychiatrist‚Äôs clinic for a few days‚Äô observation. On his discharge the doctor persuades him to adopt some less conventional behaviour, so he goes to work dressed quite differently. However, during his time away, the double finalised the merger and took his wife out on the town, culminating in their going home and sleeping together. Pelham calls his home from the office and is astonished when the phone is answered by someone claiming to be himself. On edge, he drives to his house as quickly as possible, and inside comes face to face with his double, who calmly insists he is the real Pelham, pointing out the uncharacteristic clothes the visitor is wearing. The family and his best friend are all there and side with the double. After asking the others to let the two of them speak alone, the double tells the \\"real\\" Pelham that the new clothes were a mistake, and explains how on the operating table the double was \\"let out\\" but there is only room in this world for one of them. Both insist they will go to the police. The real Pelham drives off in his Rover in a greatly agitated state. The double immediately leaves and pursues him in the sports car. Dr Harris happens to see both men and is shocked. After a high-speed chase in the rain, the two cars race towards each other on a bridge. The real Pelham swerves off into the river, and just before he hits the water his image fades away. The double stops and looks down into the water, and then, to the audible sound of a double heartbeat, he briefly clutches his chest as if in extreme pain, but the spasm soon passes and he becomes calm: there is only one Pelham again.

The Strange Case of Mr Pelham was originally published in 1957. The film was one of the first three greenlit by Bryan Forbes while he was head of EMI Films (the others were Hoffman and And Now the Darkenss). The film was announced in August 1969. Release According to Roger Moore's autobiography, My Name Is Moore, this film was part of a series of small budgeted films featuring star actors working for substantially less than their usual fees. Moore says that the film should have been successful, but amateurish marketing made this impossible. Box-office results were disappointing.City comment: Soon the darkness The Guardian (1959-2003) [London (UK)] 8 Mar 1971: 12. Though initial reviews were negative, the film is considered by many as one of Roger Moore's best non-Bond films. It has also had many recent positive reviews on internet sites, including one naming the film as an under-rated classic. Roger Moore said this was his favourite film from his own work. DVD and Blu-ray releases The film was released on DVD format in 2005 with a PG rating. The DVD includes special features including a commentary by Roger Moore and Bryan Forbes.

During the infantry phase of the Battle of Sharon the British Empire 60th Division, XXI Corps attacked and captured the section of the front line nearest the Mediterranean coast under cover of an intense artillery barrage including a creeping barrage and naval gunfire while the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions XXI Corps attacked the Tabsor group of trenches. These Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) victories over the entrenched Ottoman Eighth Army, composed of German and Ottoman soldiers, began the Final Offensive, ultimately resulting in the destruction of the equivalent of one Ottoman army, the retreat of what remained of two others, and the capture of many thousands of prisoners and many miles of territory from the Judean Hills to the border of modern-day Turkey. After the end of the battle of Megiddo, the Desert Mounted Corps pursued the retreating soldiers to Damascus, six days later. By the time an Armistice of Mudros was signed between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire five weeks later, Aleppo had been captured. During the Battle of Arara the Yildirim Army Group of the German and Ottoman Empires was attacked by the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the D√©tachement Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie (DFPS) which included the French Armenian Legion also known as La L√©gion Arm√©nienne (XXI Corps). This battle on the extreme right of the main attack covered the flank of the attackers pivoting on their positions. The Armenian's' role during this battle was so prominent that their efforts were recognized by the top commanders of the Allied Force. Background In September 1918, on the Palestinian front, the Ottoman army was crumbling before the British expeditionary forces in the Middle East, which contained an Armenian contingent commanded by a French colonel and French officers, as well as Armenian officers. Many of the Armenians were survivors from Musa Dagh, where Armenians had resisted against Turkish massacres during the Armenian Genocide.Walker. \\"World War I and the Armenian Genocide,\\" p. 267. The legion had landed at Jaffa in the middle of September and was prepared to take part in the final British offensive to evict the Ottomans from Palestine. Prelude=Deployment of 54th Division and DFPS The 54th (East Anglian) Division, consisted of the 161st, 162nd and 163rd Brigades of the British Army. Alongside them were most of the D√©tachement Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie (DFPS) commanded by Colonel Gilles de Philpin de Pi√©pape. Whilst its mounted troops served elsewhere in the 5th Light Horse Brigade, the rest of the organisation served alongside the 54th. pp. 670‚Äì2 Under cover of a British barrage, the 54th (East Anglian) Division on a frontage between Mejdel Yaba and Rafat, with the D√©tachement Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie (DFPS) on the right, the 163rd Brigade in the centre and the 161st Brigade on the right pivoting on the Rafat salient, were to advance through Crown Hill north east of Kufr Qasim. While the 162nd Brigade on the left would move eastwards on Bidya and capture the crossings of the Wadi Qana south of Kh. Kefir Thilth towards Kefr Kasim before advancing north east. p. 473 p. 205 Deployment of Asia Corps The 16th Division, one of the four front‚Äìline Ottoman divisions of the Eighth Army, consisted of the 47th and the 48th Infantry Regiments with the 1st Battalion, 125th Infantry and part of the 48th Regiment's machine‚Äìgun company, with the divisional assault, engineer, and cavalry companies in reserve. This division held the front line during the night of 18/19 September, expecting an attack from part of the 54th (East Anglian) Division and the DFPS. p. 149 Battle Falls Sketch Map 30 Megiddo Zero Hour 19 September 1918 The 19th Division (von Oppen Group) was attacked by the British 54th (East Anglian) Division which pushed forward as the pivot for the infantry advance across the coastal plain of Sharon. The 19th Division (Asia Corps) was shelled heavily and subjected to infantry assaults which resulted in both of von Oppen's divisions; the 19th and 16th Divisions retreating intact. German General Otto Liman von Sanders commander of the Yildirim Army Group at Nazareth, despatched a battalion of the 125th Regiment to the north of 'Azzun Ibn 'Atme shortly after heaving about the breakthrough. In the afternoon, German Colonel Gustav von Oppen commander of the Asia Corps despatched a German lieutenant with clerks, orderlies and transport men with some machine guns to Kh. Kefar Thilth to rally the retreating 19th Division which had been near Jaljulye. p. 495 The 162nd Brigade, 54th (East Anglian) Division, less the 11th Battalion London Regiment escorting divisional artillery, covered the gap between the division's left and the right of the 3rd (Lahore) Division at Ras el Ain, where they were heavily shelled south west of Kufr Qasim by long range guns. On hearing of the capture of Kufr Qasim at 09:30 they began an advance between Sivri Wood and Crown Hill but was directed to support the 161st Brigade attack at Sivri Wood which was captured. Subsequently, three battalions advanced steadily eastwards to the Wadi Qana where three howitzers were captured. Later in the day Azzun Ibn Atme was captured and during the early morning Kh es Sumra was reached. pp. 475‚Äì6 The advance of the 161st Brigade on Kufr Qasim was checked but eventually they managed to captured it by 07:00 along with Jevis Tepe to the west. The 6th and 7th Battalions, Essex Regiment then moved up to attack the next line of trenches with their right near Crown Hill, where they encountered obstinate resistance but after another bombardment the whole position was occupied. pp. 474‚Äì5 The 163rd Brigade advanced towards the front line trenches and at 04:20 just as the 4th and 5th Battalions, Norfolk Regiment reached these, the British barrage lifted and began to move forward. Their first objective was taken so quickly they had to wait for the barrage's next lift then the 5th Battalion, Suffolk Regiment captured a position north of the Wadi el 'Ayun. A very strong Ottoman counter-attack north of this wadi became critical until units in the D√©tachement Fran√ßais de Palestine et de Syrie (DFPS) appeared on Scurry Hill and opened fire on the Ottoman attackers who were forced to surrender. By 14:00 it was found that Ottoman defences to the north had been captured and a move towards Mesha, Bidya and Kh. Sirisia began. This fighting continued on into the night and by 03:00 20 September Mesha had been occupied and Bidya entered. pp. 473‚Äì4 Falls Map 31 Megiddo Situation at 24:00 19/20 September 1918 On the right of the 54th (East Anglian) Division's 163rd Brigade, the DFPS fought against the German Pasha 11 Group which held a ridge opposite the Rafat salient captured and held by the British since April 1918. p. 247 pp. 224‚Äì5 Here, the DFPS attacked the col west of Rafat and the sites known as Three Bushes and Scurry Hills; these last two being quickly captured at 05:10 and 05:45 respectively. Although Kh. Deir el Qassis east of Scurry Hill was occupied soon after it had to be abandoned due to heavy artillery beyond the reach of the French artillery. During the night of 19 September the DFPS occupied Arara north east of Rafat having captured almost all their objectives and 212 prisoners. The DFPS and the 54th (East Anglian) Division eventually captured their objectives and established a secure pivot on the ridge for the XXI Corps' line of attack which stretched across five divisions to the Mediterranean Sea. In the process they captured about 700 prisoners, nine guns and 20 machine guns suffering 535 casualties. p. 476 Aftermath Falls Map 32 Megiddo Situation at 21:00 20 September 1918 The Seventh Army reported it had repelled virtually all attacks on its front but was about to withdraw to its second line of defences between Kefar Haris and Iskaka, to conform with Oppen's retirement. Liman ordered the 110th Regiment at Nablus and any other troops the commander of the Seventh Army could spare to defend the Tul Karm to Nablus road at 'Anebta, at 12:30 ordering the occupation of the mouth of the Musmus Pass at El Lajjun by six companies and 12 machine guns. p. 495 At the end of the day, the front of the British Empire's XXI Corps ran just west of the 54th Division at Bidya, Kh. Kefar Thilth and Azzun through Jiyus west of the 3rd (Lahore) Division at Felamiye through 7th (Meerut) Division at Et Taiyibe, Irta and 60th (2/2nd London) Division at Tul Karm; the heads of the corps' columns describing a virtual straight line from the DFPS at Rafat to Tul Karm. p. 488 p. 248 p. 227 Commendation General Edmund Allenby commended Armenian forces in his official dispatch to the Allied High Command, \\"On the right flank, on the coastal hills, the units of the Armenian Legion d'Orient fought with great valour. Despite the difficulty of the terrain and the strength of the enemy defensive lines, at an early hour, they took the hill of Dir el Kassis.\\" Allenby remarked, \\"I am proud to have had an Armenian contingent under my command.

Early life and education Vera Scantlebury was born in Linton, Victoria, 7 August 1889. Her parents were George James and Catherine Millington (n√©e Baynes) Scantlebury. She was educated at Toorak College before entering medical school at the University of Melbourne. She graduated Bachelor of Medicine (MB) in 1914. Career She became resident medical officer at the Melbourne Hospital. \\"Dr. Vera\\", as she was commonly known, then moved to the Children's Hospital in 1915, where she was appointed senior medical officer before leaving for England in 1917. In England she was attached to the Endell Street Military Hospital. She returned to Victoria in 1919 and worked in a variety of honorary positions including: honorary anaesthetist at the Women's Hospital (1920‚Äì1922), honorary clinical assistant at the Children's Hospital (1920‚Äì1924), honorary physician/surgeon at the Queen Victoria Hospital (1920‚Äì1926) and medical inspector at the Church of England Girls' Grammar School (1920‚Äì1946). Dr. Vera also was associated with the Victorian Baby Health Centres Association and the Free Kindergarten Union of Victoria. In 1921, Dr. Vera was appointed part-time medical officer in charge of the city baby health centres and in 1924 she became a doctor of medicine. In 1925, together with Dr. Henrietta Main, she was sent by the Victorian Government to conduct a survey of the welfare of women and children in New Zealand and Victoria. Their report led to the establishment of the Infant Welfare Division in the Department of Public Health. Dr. Vera married University of Melbourne lecturer (later associate professor) Dr. Edward Byam Brown on 18 September 1926, and they had two children. She was appointed the first Director of Infant Welfare for the Victorian Department of Health in 1926. She remained dedicated to this position until her death. The position was only part-time due to her marriage, a custom of the time when it was considered that married women did not need to work outside the home. In 1937, following her report on infant welfare for the National Health and Research Council, the Commonwealth Government allocated ¬£100,000 for the benefit of pre-school children, from the Coronation Commemoration Grant. In 1938 the Australian Association of Pre-School Child Development was established, together with the Lady Gowrie Child Centres. The preventive work carried out at these centres in all states was largely the result of Dr. Scantlebury Brown's efforts. In 1944, pre-school activities including payment of subsidies to free kindergartens were also placed under her supervision, and her vision and enthusiasm achieved a further success in 1945, when the State Government decided to bring under the Health Department the care of expectant mothers and all children to six years of age. * 1914 - 1915 Resident Medical Officer of the Melbourne Hospital * 1915 - 1917 Resident Medical Officer and Senior Medical Officer of the Children's Hospital Melbourne * 1917 - 1919 Attached Royal Army Medical Corps, Endell Street Military Hospital, London, England * 1920 - Resident Medical Officer of the Women's Hospital, Melbourne * 1920 - 1922 Honorary Anaesthetist of the Women's Hospital, Melbourne * 1920 - 1924 Honorary Clinical Assistant, Children's Hospital, Melbourne * 1920 - 1926 Honorary physician and surgeon, Queen Victoria Hospital, Melbourne * 1920 - 1946 Medical Inspector, Church of England Grammar School, Melbourne * 1921 - Part-time medical officer in charge of city baby health centres * 1924 - Awarded degree of doctor of medicine * 1925 - Appointed with Dr. Henrietta Main, by the Victoria Government, to report on the welfare of Victorian women and children * 1926 - 1946 (death) Director of Infant Welfare Victoria at Department of Public Health Death and legacy Vera Scantlebury Brown died on 14 July 1946, aged 56, after a long battle with cancer.

It was first published by Doubleday, in the United States, 2005. The book was translated into Italian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.  Plot summary  The novel is a retelling of the assault on the Roman Republic by the Carthaginian general Hannibal Barca. It begins in Ancient Spain, where Hannibal sets out with tens of thousands of soldiers and 30 elephants. After conquering the Roman-allied city of Saguntum, Hannibal accepts Rome's declaration of war. He befriends peoples disillusioned by Rome and outwits the opponents who believe the land route he has chosen is impossible. Hannibal‚Äôs troops suffer brutal losses as they pass through the Pyrenees Mountains, ford the Rhone River, and make a winter crossing of the Alps, before descending to fight battles at the Trebia River, Lake Trasimene, Cannae and Zama. The novel ends roughly where the war ends, although Hannibal lived on for some years as both a political figure and a mercenary soldier.

It is a suburban subdivision, consisting mostly of low-density, single detached dwellings. As of 2007, the area is home to 2,491 residents. The neighbourhood is considered a middle-income area, with an average family income of $61,904, an average dwelling value of $280,970 and a home ownership rate of 66.9%. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $343,459. History Fire Station #3 The land for the neighbourhood was annexed by the city between 1910 and 1919. A 1913 map shows that the present-day Queen Elizabeth area overlaps two registered subdivisions of the day: the G.T.P. 1/4 Section in the west, and part of the Broadway Addition in the east. During the speculative real estate market between 1909 and 1912, ambitious developers had a local lumber company built three stately brick homes at 1906, 1908 and 1910 York Avenue (at the intersection with Taylor Street). Though they were far away from the city core, developers anticipated that residential building would soon expand outward quickly. Foundations for other houses nearby were built, but abruptly abandoned as a recession took hold in 1913. Meanwhile, the homes became known as the \\"Three Sisters\\" and were landmarks for travellers. The city eventually developed the land near the houses in around 1953. The northmost \\"sister\\" was demolished to make way for Fire Station #3 - the two remaining homes survive to the present day. Home construction begin in earnest until after World War II. Gladmer Park, a complex of four-unit semi-detached houses, was developed in the 1950s as one of several Limited Dividend Housing Projects constructed in Saskatoon. Financing was provided by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation repayable over a 40-year period. A condition of the mortgage required that this project provide low rent housing over the 40-year term. Queen Elizabeth School was designed by local architect Frank J. Martin. It was built in 1953 and opened in September 1954. Aden Bowman Collegiate was opened in 1958. Government and politics Queen Elizabeth exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon‚ÄîGrasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015. Provincially, the area is divided by Eastlake Avenue into the constituencies of Saskatoon Eastview and Saskatoon Nutana. Saskatoon Eastview is currently represented by Corey Tochor of the Saskatchewan Party since 2011. Saskatoon Nutana is currently represented by Cathy Sproule of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party since 2011. In Saskatoon's non-partisan municipal politics, Queen Elizabeth lies within ward 7. It is currently represented by Councillor Mairin Loewen, who was elected to city council in a 2011 by-election. Institutions=Education *Queen Elizabeth School - public elementary school, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division. Declining enrolment at the school in the 2000s (decade) prompted the school board to offer part of the building to the Saskatoon Open Door Society (SODS), an organization providing services to immigrants and refugees. Since 2008, SODS has operated adult language classes in the school, and is slated to open a day care in 2010. *Aden Bowman Collegiate - public secondary, part of the Saskatoon Public School Division Parks and recreation *Weaver Park - The Queen Elizabeth Community Association serves residents by offering recreational, social, and educational programs for adults, children/youth, and preschoolers. The association serves the west half of the Haultain neighbourhood as well. Public services Queen Elizabeth is a part of the east division of the Saskatoon Police Service's patrol system. Saskatoon Fire & Protective Services' east division covers the neighbourhood. Fire Station #3 was previously located at 1906 York Avenue, before relocating to 2611 Clarence Avenue South in 2018. Transit services to Queen Elizabeth are provided by Saskatoon Transit on routes No. 6 (Clarence - Broadway) and 13 (Lawson - Exhibition). Commercial The only commercial developments in Queen Elizabeth are businesses located at the intersection of Broadway Avenue and Taylor Street. In addition, there are 27 home-based businesses in the neighbourhood. Location Queen Elizabeth is located within the Nutana Suburban Development Area. It is bounded by Taylor Street to the north, Ruth Street to the south, Melrose Avenue to the west, and Clarence Avenue to the east. Roads are laid out in a grid fashion; streets run east-west, avenues run north-south.

First, in an effort to understand the topic in a wider context than the case at hand, Rabbi Sacks branches out into other areas of halacha (Jewish Law) examining the topic as it appears throughout the Talmud. The information gleaned from the broad analysis is applied to the case at hand.

Ambj√∏rn began in the early 1990s searching for a physics model that bonded quantum mechanics and relativistic gravity in a way that didn't require supersymmetry. By 1994, he argued a simpler way to represent quantum gravity was to use Lorentzian space-time geometry as a framework. His first major publication on the lattice model that would become CDT theory was released in 1998. It was then that he and Renate Loll made triangulation and the causal approach the cornerstones to the lattice gauge theory. The theory of Causal Dynamical Triangulations faced harsh scrutiny for some years because most physicists preferred models that required more dimensions and a fixed background. By 2004, Ambj√∏rn's assertion of the benefits to a non-perturbative quantum gravity model regained attention. As of 2007, Ambj√∏rn continues to research lattice gauge, string, and quantum gravity theories; matrix models and their applications; and statistical theories of random surfaces and paths. He is currently sharing a position as a professor at the Niels Bohr Institute and the Radboud University Nijmegen.

Its story is about a boy and girl, Pete Porter and Honey Wynn, played by Paul Carr and Freda Holloway, who become overnight sensations as a romantic singing duo who run into trouble when their squabbling managers, played by Kay Medford and Bob Pastene, try to turn them into solo acts. Against this backdrop in cameo performances appear some of the biggest names of rock and roll in the 1950s lip-syncing to their recordings. Overview Jamboree is a film that was built upon the popularity of a name which at the time was becoming associated with rock and roll music and it appears to have derived its name from a show starring disc-jockey Alan Freed that began airing over Radio Luxembourg in 1956 (the year before this movie was released). Freed recorded his featured segment while working for WINS in New York City. A great rivalry developed during this time between Alan Freed and Dick Clark who appears in this film. Freed was the pioneer of rock and roll movies (Rock Around the Clock; Don't Knock the Rock; Rock, Rock, Rock), however, Congressional Hearings into payola practices and radio broadcasting eventually ruined Freed's career, while Clark's career continued uninterrupted. Jamboree was essentially a music film in the manner of music videos that followed many years later on MTV where the storyline was secondary to the musical performances, with the amateurish acting becoming less relevant than the musical performances themselves. However, this movie is of historical importance due to the cameo performances by various musical acts that are featured. Featured stars Included in Jamboree are Buddy Knox, who performs \\"Hula Love\\", a no. 9 hit on the Billboard pop singles chart; Jimmy Bowen, performs \\"Cross Over\\"; Dick Clark acting as the host for a show within the film, which was released shortly after first who appearing as host of American Bandstand on TV; Fats Domino, who performs \\"Wait and See\\"; Charlie Gracie (who became an even bigger hit in the UK than he was in the United States), who performs \\"Cool Baby\\"; Jack Jackson (British bandleader who acted as the disc jockey host of the Decca records show on Radio Luxembourg; Jerry Lee Lewis (who belts out \\"Great Balls of Fire\\" in a version that is different from the Sun 45 release); Lewis Lymon and the Teenchords; Jack Payne (another British band leader); Carl Perkins (who sings \\"Glad All Over\\"); Jodie Sands, who performs \\"Sayonara\\"; Frankie Avalon, who sings \\"Teacher's Pet\\"; Slim Whitman, who gathered a tremendous following in Europe, who performs \\"Unchain My Heart\\"; Aaron Schroeder in a cameo role as the Songwriter; The Four Coins, who perform \\"A Broken Promise\\"; and, Count Basie and his Orchestra, featuring Joe Williams on vocals. Connie Francis overdubbed her vocals for Freda Holloway. Brazilian singer Cauby Peixoto has a cameo appearance in the film under the name \\"Ron Coby\\". Cauby had a brief rock and roll phase is in his career, recording \\"Rock'n'Roll in Copacabana\\". Carl Perkins (second from left) performing \\"Glad All Over\\" with (left to right) Clayton Perkins, W.S. \\"Fluke\\" Holland, and Jay Perkins Dick Clark is the host of the \\"second hour\\" of a \\"United Charities\\" Telethon to raise money to fight what is described only as \\"this dreaded disease\\". Clark is listed as a DJ for WFIL Philadelphia in the credits (at the time this was filmed, he was also hosting the original Philadelphia edition of what eventually became American Bandstand). Clark introduces a number of disc jockey's from across the US and Canada. These DJs then introduce the featured stars. Later in the film DJs in Europe: Jack Jackson (ATV) and Chris Payne (BBC) in London, England; Werner Goetze (Bayerischer Rundfunk) Munich, and Chris Howland (Westdeutscher Rundfunk) Cologne, Germany are shown introducing \\"Pete and Honey\\" records on the air.

First introduced in the pilot episode, he has become the usual partner of FBI Special Agent Colby Granger (Dylan Bruno) and has also become the primary relief supervisor for the Supervisor of the FBI Violent Crimes squad, Don Eppes (Rob Morrow). At first unpopular with critics, Sinclair has since been recognized as a popular character on the show. Evolution over the series Since Season 2, Sinclair is usually partnered with Colby Granger and tried to stick up for him in \\"The Mole\\". In fact, in the Season 3 finale, \\"The Janus List\\", when Colby is revealed to be a double agent working as a spy for the Chinese, David reacted with deep pain and blind fury at the betrayal, tears welling in his eyes during Colby's confession just before he attempted to assault Colby in the interrogation room of the L.A. office. Even with the possibility of Colby having been a triple agent and the will to save him, David is not ready to see his partner yet, as he feels he does not really know him. Alan Eppes has given him something to think about, as Mr. Eppes had said this is a test of true friendship and that he must try to understand his motives. The two are close once more, but only after many failures to cooperate on a mission. David was assigned to work with Don Eppes in the pilot episode, by the assistant director. By Season 3, he has been with Don three years, and there is nothing Don can not ask David to do, though, Don worries David may one day realize he has seen too much and leave the FBI. He has knowledge of bomb disposal due to his first posting overseas in Tel Aviv, Israel. In addition, David did some work for the Long Beach FBI office. David carries a Glock 22 pistol. David's two best friends in childhood were Ben Ellis and Earl Day, as revealed in the episode \\"Contenders\\". He grew up in the Bronx, attended Cornell University (\\"Black Swan\\"), and has mentioned growing up dodging gangs to get an education. He currently lives in Venice, California. David was upset when his sister, Linda, was divorced but went back to her ex-husband. Sinclair enjoys Alan's cooking and he is infatuated with medical examiner Claudia Gomez (Lauren V√©lez). When season five opens, David wants to consult Charlie but cannot. During Carl McGowan's investigation into Don, McGowan tries to appeal to David's leadership qualities as a way to get David to turn Don in; David refuses. David believes in that others were involved in the JFK assassination. This causes an argument with Colby. During the investigation of a train crash, David is assigned to assist with recovering victims. He becomes impatient with the course of the recovery effort, especially with Charlie's request for patience. David snaps at Charlie and then goes into the train crash to deliver an inhaler to one of the victims. Colby goes in after David. After the rescue, David apologizes to Charlie. When Buck Williams comes after Don, David is dismayed at Don's behavior. He confronts Don about it. Don tells David to trust him or report him. David decides to trust him. Later, during another investigation, David tells Don that he (Don) is a good leader. Toward the end of season five, David applies to be Don's primary relief supervisor. Don first leaves the letter of recommendation on his desk for David to read. Unbeknownst to David, Don placing David as Liz's handler served as some on-the-job training as a primary relief supervisor. After the case is solved, Don breaks the news that the request was approved. David is then asked to lead the team, including Don, into a home invasion in progress. When Don is stabbed, David takes over for Don until Don returns to the office. In the sixth season finale, he leaves Don's team to take a leadership position with an anti-corruption team based in Washington, DC.

Granger later switches to the Smith & Wesson PC 945. As new partners in season 2, David and Colby seemed to disagree with each other on methods used while working on cases. For the first few episodes, they did not seem to like each other at all. Over time, however, they became very close friends. At the end of Season 3, it was revealed that Colby had actually been spying for two years on his colleagues, working for the Chinese, as had his \\"old Army buddy\\" Dwayne Carter (Shawn Hatosy), who he covered for and then sent to prison in \\"The Mole\\". His fellow FBI colleagues were left stunned and shocked at the revelation, with his partner Sinclair taking the betrayal especially hard. Colby was immediately removed from the team and incarcerated. However, in the Season 4 premiere he escaped while being transported to another prison and it is revealed that he was actually only acting as a triple agent in order to help out the U.S. counterintelligence. This could not be confirmed because his supervisor and sole CI contact, Michael Kirkland, had been killed. Any doubt of his status was finally removed when the agents rescued Colby from being killed by Chinese spies on a ship heading for international waters. Dwayne Carter dies, saving Granger once more by taking out torture expert Mason Lancer (Val Kilmer). Colby was offered a job in Washington, D.C., but chose to stay with his former team. David was distant with Granger, which caused their team to perform poorly on a mission, and caused Don to reprimand them. Afterwards, the two reconciled and Granger was welcomed to stay with the team. Among the team, Colby's experiences as a triple agent have been referenced several times, and, once, Colby cites it as a reason for not dating. When FBI Special Agent Roger Bloom (Henry Winkler), a 34-year veteran of the FBI's bank robbery division who lost his job because he stole 10 million dollars (US) to draw attention to a 2,000 dollar (US) theft at his sister's store, tries to solve a series of unsolved bank robberies, Colby relates his own experiences to Bloom. Moreover, when FBI Special Agent Ian Edgerton (Lou Diamond Phillips) takes Colby hostage after being arrested on murder charges, Ian references Colby's experiences in an effort to earn Colby's sympathy. Colby, however, insists that his experiences and his current circumstances are different. Only when David uses his and Colby's distress word to alert Colby to impending danger does Colby realize that Ian is innocent of the charges. Backstory Colby did a tour of duty with the U.S. Army's Criminal Investigation Division in Afghanistan before joining the FBI, wherein his friend Dwayne Carter saved him from a car explosion, making him indebted to Carter in Dwayne's eyes. After getting his college degree, Granger received three years of training in interrogation techniques. He was raised in Winchester, Idaho and plays golf in his spare time. He is also fluent in Spanish and was a wrestler in high school. His father died when he was 15 in a suspicious mountain car accident. In one episode, Colby reveals that his father may have committed suicide. He apparently enjoys fishing. He spent some time in Oahu where he enjoyed surfing as was seen in the episode, \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\". During several early episode appearances it is noted that he was also a graduate of MIT, although there is little mention of what he studied and the nature of his degree. Creation Dylan Bruno was cast as Colby Granger for the start of season two. Originally a guest star, Bruno became a regular during season three. Reception Colby became a fan favorite. During his first season on Numb3rs, Bruno, as Colby, developed a fan base. When Colby was revealed to be a double agent in the episode \\"The Janus List\\", fans were outraged. Bruno‚Äôs portrayal as Granger had also earned him some recognition from the FBI. In a public service announcement, Bruno congratulated the FBI on their 100th anniversary.

The Enid area is also home to Vance Air Force Base; the News & Eagle also produces the base's weekly newspaper. History Former Enid Mayor and Oklahoma Congressman Milton C.

It was followed by the Sun Eagle by W.I. Drummond from 1899 to 1900. From 1900 to 1905, the Enid Eagle was published weekly by Eagle Publishing Company.

Its current incarnation has been called the Enid News & Eagle since 1989. Enid News & Eagle reporter Robert Barron interviews FEMA PIO Charles Henderson following Kingfisher flooding in 2007. The Enid Daily Wave (later the Enid Morning News) began on December 11, 1893, under the management of editor J.L. Isenberg. Isenberg had a reputation for being an opinionated Democrat and his paper reflected his opinions. This ultimately lead to a showdown between Isenberg and R. W. Patterson, Registrar of the United States Land Office. Isenberg had expected preferential treatment concerning the purchases of advertisements, as they were both Democrats, but Patterson instead favored a competing newspaper at the time, the Tribune-Democrat. Isenberg then published articles denigrating Patterson. On June 26, 1895, a fight broke out between the two. E. C. Williams, City Marshal of Enid, attempted to break up the fight. Ultimately, Williams and Patterson shot each other. Isenberg fled to Kingfisher, and after a brief return to Enid, eventually moved to California.http://www.enid.org/police/williams.asp The paper continued to be published as the Enid Morning News from 1908 to 1916, the Enid Daily News from 1916 to 1923.Rockwell, Stella, ed., Garfield County, Oklahoma, 1907-1982, Vol. II, Garfield Historical Society, Josten's Publishing Company, Topeka, Kansas. 1982., pgs 922-923 In February 1923, the papers were combined to form the Enid Publishing Company.

He soon made his debut, in a Second Division match away to Darwen on 1 January 1897, which Arsenal lost 4‚Äì1. He was a mainstay for the rest of the 1896‚Äì97 season, playing all three half back positions; his continued versatility meant he remained a regular in the Arsenal side for the next five years.

He continued to be a regular for another season but after the arrival of Roddy McEachrane in 1902, he was squeezed out of the Woolwich Arsenal side; he only played eight games in 1902‚Äì03 and left the club at the end of that season.

Class topics ranged from introductory real estate investing to advanced techniques such as creative real estate investing techniques including wholesaling, multi-units, and short sales; examples of course titles are \\"Fix & Flip\\" and \\"Creative Financing.\\" The company takes its name from the French term nouveau riche, which refers to those with \\"new money,\\" particularly in an ostentatious or vulgar manner, who created wealth within their own generation as opposed to inheriting a family fortune (\\"old money\\"). Nouveau Riche University closed down on December 31, 2010. The school Nouveau Riche taught thousands of students from around the United States. In 2007 more than 9,000 people attended the college. There were three tuition schedules ranging between 30 and 120 instructional hours. Students could designate a partner to attend classes at no additional charge. Classes were taught using the principles of instructional systems design and multiple six-day college sessions were held throughout the year. Those students who were enrolled with the Regents tuition (98 percent of all students) could repeat classes for an additional year and have access to streaming video classrooms for select courses at no additional charge.

In December 2002, the corporate headquarters were established in Scottsdale, Arizona. Nouveau Riche once had plans to construct a campus facility on a site overlooking the Phoenix, Arizona, valley.

The design of the complex was headed by Larson Associates Architects, Inc.

History Mill at Old River Road (1936) Pegmatite dikes along the river at Ilchester (c. 1895) In 1761, John Cornthwaite founded a wood grist mill called the Dismal Mill, located approximately southeast of Ellicott City on the western shore of the Patapsco River. The Ellicott family (John, Andrew, and Joseph Ellicott) settled in the area in the late 18th century, buying a two- mile section of the Patapsco in 1772 that included Ilchester and Ellicott Mills. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) was built up the Patapsco River valley through Ilchester in 1830 (see Old Main Line Subdivision), and George Ellicott, Jr. (grandson of Andrew) built a tavern and cooper shop along the railroad. The Thistle Manufacturing Company built a factory in 1837. Ilchester did not become a major stop for the B&O; due to its steep grades, and the tavern was unsuccessful. In 1842, mail service was started with the station name \\"Illchester Mills\\". Ellicott sold his tavern and 110 acres of land to a Redemptorist church order in 1866.Michael Duck, \\"The Story Beneath The Ruins: A History of St. Mary's College in Ilchester\\", The View from Ellicott City (newspaper). October 19, 2000. The church used the Ellicott estate to start a college, initially called Mount Saint Clemens when it opened in 1868. Several additions to the original building were made, and a chapel was constructed. In 1882 it was renamed Saint Mary's College. In 1893 the chapel was established as a parish church dedicated to \\"Our Lady of Perpetual Help\\". The parish moved the church to a new facility in 1958. Enrollment at the college declined, and the college was closed in 1972. The State of Maryland purchased a portion of the campus in 1987 and added the land to adjacent Patapsco Valley State Park.

The original mill community of Ilchester is located along the Patapsco River at the junction of Ilchester and Bonnie Branch Roads. However, the current CDP extends southwest to include the suburban terrain of Howard County outside of the Patapsco River valley.

Publication details  *Written by David Anthony Durham *First published: Doubleday, United States, 2001.  Plot summary  David Anthony Durham made his literary debut with a haunting novel which, in the tradition of Cormac McCarthy's All the Pretty Horses, views the American West through an original lens. Set in the 1870s, the novel tells the tale of Gabriel Lynch, an African American youth who settles with his family in the plains of Kansas. Dissatisfied with the drudgery of homesteading and growing increasingly disconnected from his family, Gabriel forsakes the farm for a life of higher adventure. Thus begins a forbidding trek into a terrain of austere beauty, a journey begun in hope, but soon laced with danger and propelled by a cast of brutal characters. By writing about African American characters, Durham gave voice to a population seldom included in our Western lore.

The castle was founded by King David I. It was destroyed in 1276, rebuilt in 1530 by Dame Ker, and destroyed again by the 3rd Duke of Roxburghe in 1760. Very little of it now remains. This Norman castle was named after the Lords Holydean, who were originally the deans of Kelso Abbey: monks who held great power in what was one of the largest feudal territories and most profitable regions of Scotland. The peerage title, barony, and castle eventually went to the Kerrs who were made Earls of Roxburghe, and later Dukes. Holydean Farm stands on the site of the old Holydean Castle. A stone block rescued from the castle now forms the lintel of the farmhouse doorway, and the castle well is still preserved. The castle's alternative name is Hobbie Ker's Well.

Definitions  A bornology or boundedness on a set X is a collection ‚Ñ¨ of subsets of X such that 1. ‚Ñ¨ covers X (i.e. X = \\\\cup_{B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B}} B); 2. ‚Ñ¨ is stable under inclusion (i.e. if B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ then every subset of B belongs to ‚Ñ¨); 3. ‚Ñ¨ is stable under finite unions (or equivalently, the union of any two sets in ‚Ñ¨ also belongs to ‚Ñ¨). in which case the pair (X, ‚Ñ¨) is called a bounded structure or a bornological set. Elements of ‚Ñ¨ are called ‚Ñ¨-bounded sets or simply bounded sets, if ‚Ñ¨ is understood. A subset ùíú of a bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called a base or fundamental system of ‚Ñ¨ if for every B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨, there exists an A ‚àà ùíú such that B ‚äÜ A. A subset ùíÆ of a bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called a subbase of ‚Ñ¨ if the collection of all finite unions of sets in ùíÆ forms a base for ‚Ñ¨. If ùíú and ‚Ñ¨ are bornologies on X then we say that ‚Ñ¨ is finer or stronger than ùíú and that ùíú is coarser or weaker than ‚Ñ¨ if ùíú ‚äÜ ‚Ñ¨. If (X, ‚Ñ¨) is a bounded structure and X ‚àâ ‚Ñ¨, then the set of complements { X \\\\ B : B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ } is a filter (having empty intersection) called the filter at infinity. Given a collection ùíÆ of subsets of X, the smallest bornology containing ùíÆ is called the bornology generated by ùíÆ. If f : S -> X is a map and ‚Ñ¨ is a bornology on X, then we denote the bornology generated by f^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right) := \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ f^{-1}\\\\left( B \\\\right) : B \\\\in \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right\\\\\\\\} by \\\\left[ f^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{B} \\\\right) \\\\right] and called it the inverse image bornology or the initial bornology induced by f on S.  Morphisms: Bounded maps  Suppose that (X, ùíú) and (Y, ‚Ñ¨) are bounded structures. A map f : X -> Y is called locally bounded or just bounded if the image under f of every ùíú-bounded set is a ‚Ñ¨-bounded set; that is, if for every A ‚àà ùíú, f(A) ‚àà ‚Ñ¨. Since the composition of two locally bounded map is again locally bounded, it is clear that the class of all bounded structures forms a category whose morphisms are bounded maps. An isomorphism in this category is called a bornomorphism and it is a bijective locally bounded map whose inverse is also locally bounded.  Characterizations  Suppose that X and Y are topological vector spaces (TVSs) and f : X -> Y is a linear map. Then the following are equivalent: * f is a (locally) bounded map; * For every bornivorous (i.e. bounded in the bornological sense) disk D in Y, f^{-1}(D) is also bornivorous. if in addition X and Y are locally convex then we may add to this list: 3. f takes bounded disks to bounded disks; if in addition X is a seminormed space and Y is locally convex then we may add to this list: 4. f maps null sequences (i.e. sequences converging to 0) into bounded subsets of Y.  Examples  If X and Y are any two topological vector spaces (they need not even be Hausdorff) and if f : X -> Y is a continuous linear operator between them, then f is a bounded linear operator (when X and Y have their von-Neumann bornologies). The converse is in general false. A sequentially continuous map f : X -> Y between two TVSs is necessarily locally bounded.  Examples and sufficient conditions  ;Discrete bornology For any set X, the power set of X is a bornology on X called the discrete bornology. ;Compact bornology For any topological space X, the set of all relatively compact subsets of X form a bornology on X called the compact bornology on X. ;Closure and interior bornologies Suppose that X is a topological space and ‚Ñ¨ is a bornology on X. The bornology generated by the set of all interiors of sets in ‚Ñ¨ (i.e. by { int B : B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ }) is called the interior of ‚Ñ¨ and is denoted by int ‚Ñ¨. The bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called open if ‚Ñ¨ = int ‚Ñ¨. Then the bornology generated by the set of all closures of sets in ‚Ñ¨ (i.e. by { cl B : B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ }) is called the closure of ‚Ñ¨ and is denoted by cl ‚Ñ¨. We necessarily have int ‚Ñ¨ ‚äÜ ‚Ñ¨ ‚äÜ cl ‚Ñ¨. The bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called closed if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 1. ‚Ñ¨ = cl ‚Ñ¨; 2. the closed subsets of X generate ‚Ñ¨; 3. the closure of every B ‚àà ‚Ñ¨ belongs to ‚Ñ¨. The bornology ‚Ñ¨ is called proper if ‚Ñ¨ is both open and closed. The topological space X is called locally ‚Ñ¨-bounded or just locally bounded if every x ‚àà X has a neighborhood that belongs to ‚Ñ¨. Every compact subset of a locally bounded topological space is bounded. ;Topological rings Suppose that X is a commutative topological ring. A subset S of X is called bounded if for each neighborhood U of 0 in X, there exists a neighborhood V of 0 in X such that SV ‚äÜ U.  Bornology on a topological vector space  If X is a topological vector space (TVS) then the set of all boundedness subsets of X from a bornology (indeed, even a vector bornology) on X called the von Neumann bornology of X, the usual bornology, or simply the bornology of X and is referred to as natural boundedness. In any locally convex TVS X, the set of all closed bounded disks form a base for the usual bornology of X.  Trivial examples  * For any set X, the set of all finite subsets of X is a bornology on X; the same is true of the set of all countable subsets of X. * More generally, for any infinite cardinal ùúÖ, the set of all subsets of X having cardinality at most ùúÖ is a bornology on X. * The set of relatively compact subsets of ‚Ñù form a bornology on ‚Ñù. A base for this bornology is given by all closed intervals of the form [-n, n] for n a positive integer.  Limits, products, subspaces, quotients = Inverse image bornology  Let S be a set, \\\\left( T_{i}, \\\\mathcal{B}_{i} \\\\right)_{i \\\\in I} be an I-indexed family of bounded structures, and let \\\\left( f_{i}, \\\\mathcal{B}_{i} \\\\right)_{i \\\\in I} be an I-indexed family of maps where for all i ‚àà I, fi : S -> Ti. The inverse image bornology ùíú on S determined by these maps is the strongest bornology on S making each fi : (S, ùíú) -> (Ti, ‚Ñ¨i) locally bounded. This bornology is equal to \\\\cap_{i \\\\in I} \\\\left[ f^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\mathcal{B}_i \\\\right) \\\\right].  Direct image bornology  Let S be a set, \\\\left( T_{i}, \\\\mathcal{B}_{i} \\\\right)_{i \\\\in I} be an I-indexed family of bounded structures, and let \\\\left( f_{i}, \\\\mathcal{B}_{i} \\\\right)_{i \\\\in I} be an I-indexed family of maps where for all i ‚àà I, fi : Ti -> S. The direct image bornology ùíú on S determined by these maps is the weakest bornology on S making each fi : (Ti, ‚Ñ¨i) -> (S, ùíú) locally bounded. If for each i ‚àà I, ùíúi denotes the bornology generated by f(‚Ñ¨i), then this bornology is equal to the collection of all subsets A of S of the form \\\\cup_{i \\\\in I} A_{i} where each Ai ‚àà ùíúi and all but finitely many Ai are empty.  Subspace bornology  Suppose that (X, ‚Ñ¨) is a bounded structure and S be a subset of X. The subspace bornology ùíú on S is the finest bornology on S making the natural inclusion map of S into X, Id : (S, ùíú) -> (X, ‚Ñ¨), locally bounded.  Product bornology  Let \\\\left( X_{i}, \\\\mathcal{B}_{i} \\\\right)_{i \\\\in I} be an I-indexed family of bounded structures, let X = \\\\prod_{i \\\\in I} X_{i}, and for each i ‚àà I, let fi : X -> Xi denote the canonical projection. The product bornology on X is the inverse image bornology determined by the canonical projections fi : X -> Xi. That is, it is the strongest bornology on X making each of the canonical projections locally bounded.

History Wallach was born in Alexandria, Virginia in 1816, when it was still part of the District of Columbia, at the home of his grandfather Colonel Charles Simms. He grew up in Washington City where his father was a successful attorney. He attended Gonzaga College High School and then Columbian College (later renamed George Washington University) and was admitted to the D.C. bar in 1836. Political life Wallach was an active member of the Whig Party and was elected as such to the Washington Common Council in 1846, serving for two years. In 1849 he was appointed by President Zachary Taylor as U.S. Marshal for the District of Columbia, which made him the chief marshal for the entire United States until removed by Franklin Pierce in 1853. After election to the board of Aldermen in 1854, Wallach joined the Republican Party and ran against Anti-Know-Nothing candidate James G. Berret for mayor of Washington. He was defeated amidst widespread allegations of election fraud. He ran again in 1860, facing Berret a second time, and lost by 24 votes. This time, Wallach took to the newspapers (especially the Washington Star, of which Wallach's brother was editor), publishing detailed accounts of the election crimes of which he believed Berret guilty. Mayor of Washington D.C. In 1861, Wallach was serving as the president of the board of Aldermen when Mayor Berret was arrested for refusing to take a loyalty oath to the United States, pursuant to emergency Civil War legislation passed by the U.S. Congress. On August 26, 1861, the Washington City Councils elected Wallach to serve out the remainder of Berret's two-year term.Mr. Lincoln and Freedom He was subsequently elected to three terms in his own right (as the candidate for the \\"Unconditional Union\\" slate), and served until 1868, the first Washington mayor to serve more than one term since William Winston Seaton. Wallach's mayoral administration coincided with the District's most drastic period of growth, from a small rural village to a crowded metropolis (thanks to the influx of soldiers and massive federal bureaucracy necessitated by the U.S. Civil War. In accommodating the city's swelling population, Wallach established its paid fire department; paved 22,000 feet of road and over 42,000 feet of sidewalks; planned and executed a modernized sewer system, with 33,000 feet of water mains; and doubled the number of public schools. Wallach also submitted several proposals for beautification of the city's avenues and successfully advocated for a Congressional grant to build a modern marketplace in the center of the city. Wallach was mayor when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865. He oversaw the police investigation and helped to prevent a riot in the crowds of frightened attendees at Ford's Theater. He later headed the Lincoln National Monument Committee. Wallach was a staunch opponent of both emancipation and suffrage for former slaves,Untitled Document but did act to encourage integration of Washington schools, intending to dispel the idea that only poor children attended public schools. The Wallach School on Capitol Hill was named in his honor in 1864. However, his general lack of sympathy for blacks in Washington resulted in their turning him out of office, since in 1866 Congress had enacted black suffrage above his objections. Societies During the 1820s, Wallach was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. Later life Wallach returned to his law practice in Washington, dying in March 1881. Despite his opposition to emancipation and black suffrage, and his status as a slave owner, Wallach did act as the attorney for some slaves petitioning for their freedom in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. John H. Brooks, a black member on the school board, pushed for resolutions of memorial for the late mayor, claiming that \\"the colored race owed him a debt of gratitude.\\" In 1864, while he was still mayor, a schoolhouse in SE Washington was named the Wallach School in his honor. It was closed in 1949 and razed the following year.

(2008), , accessed November 11, 2009 It is one of the first masjids to be established in Northern Virginia, near Washington, D.C.. It is also one of the area's largest and most influential mosques. A small group of families, with help of the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), purchased the mosque's grounds on June 19, 1983. The mosque was first established in a house that is still on the Center's campus, and now serves as a food bank. Approximately 30 congregants would attend the weekly jumu'ah (Friday prayer) during the mosque's early years. The current building, on a 3.4 acre plot, was finished for $5 million in 1991 ($ today) with financial help from the Saudi Embassy's Islamic Affairs Department. In 1993 some area residents attempted to force closure of the mosque, saying it violated Fairfax County zoning ordinances. Worshipers believed the attempt was fueled by anti-Islamic bigotry. However despite the mosque's humble beginnings and early challenges, Dar Al-Hijrah grew to become a powerhouse mosque by 2000, serving the thriving and diverse Muslim community outside Washington D.C. The mosque sits at the corner of Virginia State Route 7 (Leesburg Pike) and Row Street, near a number of apartment units and single-family homes in which many Muslim families live. Numerous halal restaurants, grocery stores, and other Muslim businesses are also located nearby.

Activities in addition to prayers include lectures, conferences, youth recreation and outdoor activities (such as camping and field trips) through its Youth Center, women's classes, health fairs, and financial assistance. It also operates an Islamic School called the \\"Washington Islamic Academy in Northern Virginia\\". In addition, Dar Al-Hijrah co-sponsors an annual civic picnic, along with other Northern Virginia organizations, at which candidates for local office meet Muslim voters.Muslim Voters Meet Candidates, Officials at Picnic (washingtonpost.com) Dar Al-Hijrah is open for group tours. Leadership Dr. Jamal al Barzinji and Samir Salah both were among Dar Al-Hijrah's original founding members. Al Barzinji was listed as Dar Al-Hijrah's original trustee while Salah would later become the mosque's president (as of 2008). Mohammed Ali Al-Hanooti, a Palestinian imam that had previously served at mosques in New Jersey, was Dar Al-Hijrah's imam from 1995-1999. Dar al-Hijrah's previous imams at that point did not speak English and lacked engagement with the youth. With Al-Hanooti's departure, mosque leaders specifically sought out to hire an imam that could attract young people and non-Arabic speakers. Anwar al-Awlaki was a United States-born Yemeni who had returned back to his birth country to attend college while also working at various mosques as an imam on the side. Despite having no religious qualifications and almost no religious education, his fame as a religious speaker grew with popular audio recordings and speaking invitations across the country. Al-Awlaki left his imam post in San Diego, California to pursue his PhD at George Washington University in Washington D.C. and was soon recruited to be Dar Al-Hijrah's next imam in 2000. One of the mosque's board members who hired Al-Awlaki stated he was convinced that al-Awlaki had no inclinations or activities to do with terrorism. The new imam, who was described as alluring and charming at this time, began to draw young people to Dar Al-Hijrah while connecting with the sophisticated Muslim community of Northern Virginia. Al-Awlaki was considered a moderate during his time at Dar Al-Hijrah, publicly condemned the September 11 attacks and Al-Qaeda, and was even invited to speak at the United States Department of Defense and became the first imam to conduct a prayer service for the Congressional Muslim Staffer Association at the U.S. Capitol.Al-Awlaki appeared on law enforcement's radars when federal investigators discovered two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers had attended the same mosque in San Diego during the same time Al-Awlaki served as imam, as well as Dar Al-Hijrah (along with a third alleged hijacker). Despite the fact that no solid evidence emerged linking Al-Awlaki to the 9/11 plot, FBI agents conducted repeated interviews and placed the imam under surveillance.Al-Awlaki resigned from Dar Al-Hijrah in early 2002 due to post-9/11 media attention that distracted the imam from his duties, according to the mosque's outreach director.

It would be > difficult for us if we had an imam who didn't understand the process here. During his tenure at Dar Al-Hijrah, Abdul-Malik has commented publicly on Islamic affairs on the criminal cases of several American Muslims. Abdul-Malik spoke up in 2003 in defense of Abdul Rahman al-Amoudi, founder of the American Muslim Council, who was indicted on charges of engaging in illegal financial transactions with Libya.Abdullah, Hannah, \\"U.S. Muslims Celebrate First Week of Ramadan Amid Tension\\", November 5, 2003, accessed December 7, 2009 Abdul- Malik accused the government of singling out Ahmed Omar Abu Ali, who worshiped and taught Islamic studies at Dar Al-Hijrah, for which he also was a camp counselor, was charged by U.S. prosecutors with plotting with members of al- Qaeda to assassinate President George W. Bush, in order to stir anti-Muslim sentiment. also stated in February 2005 that, \\"our whole community is under siege. They don't see this as a case of criminality. They see it as a civil rights case. As a frontal attack on their community.\\"Dao, James, and Lichtblau, Eric, \\"Case Adds to Outrage for Muslims in Northern Virginia\\", The New York Times, February 27, 2005, accessed December 7, 2009 When in April 2005 Ali al-Timimi of Fairfax, Virginia, an American-born Muslim cleric, was convicted of inciting followers to wage war against the US just days after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and of recruiting for the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Toiba, and the paintball terrorist cell, Abdul-Malik said: \\"There is a view many Muslims have when they come to America that you could not be arrested for something you say. But now they have discovered they are not free to speak their minds. And if our opinions are out of vogue in the current climate, we feel we are all at risk.\\"For use in Friday PMs newspapers of July 29 and thereafter MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base Al- Timimi was sentenced to life imprisonment. In November 2009, Abdul-Malik responded to al-Awlaki's support of the Fort Hood shooter by saying: > Al-Awlaqi ... supported the crime that Hasan committed and said that the US > Muslims who opposed the crime have betrayed the Muslim ummah (the community > of Muslims worldwide) and are hypocrites. I answer him by saying that he has > thus separated himself from the Muslim community in the United States. The > holy Koran teaches us that we as US Muslims should enrich the society we > live in with humanitarian services, wisdom, teaching God's beautiful verses > about love, mercy, and compassion to all mankind. Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh Sheikh Mohammed Adam El-Sheikh, formerly a Muslim Brotherhood member in the Sudan, and one of the founders of both the mosque and the Muslim American Society (MAS), was the mosque's imam between August 2003 and May 2005. He left the mosque to become the executive director of the Fiqh Council of North America, an association of Islamic legal scholars. Commenting in 2004 on the beheadings of American hostages Nick Berg and Daniel Pearl, he said: > beheadings are not mentioned in the Koran at all. According to Islamic penal > law, killers will be sentenced to death, but the means of execution are not > mentioned. ...we don't condone this. They are not following Islam. They are > following their own whims. < He said that \\"suicide bombings are never legitimate in the United States.\\" The Sheikh said he tells his congregation that \\"Islamic law does not allow suicide bombings in most instances.\\" Speaking of Palestinian suicide bombers he said \\"if certain Muslims are to be cornered where they cannot defend themselves, except through these kinds of means, and their local religious leaders issued fatwas to permit that, then it becomes acceptable as an exceptional rule, but should not be taken as a principle.\\" Shaker Elsayed Shaker Elsayed, a Shariah law scholar born in Cairo, Egypt, has been the resident imam at Dar Al-Hijrah since June 1, 2005. From 2000 through 2005 he was the Secretary General of the Muslim American Society. He unequivocally condemns terrorism and states that the mosque actively publicizes that condemnation to the public. Board of directors and executive committee The mosque's nine-member board of directors consists of the secretary general of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA), the president of the Muslim Arab Youth Association (MAYA), the general manager of the North American Islamic Trust (NAIT), the president of Muslim American Society (MAS), the president of the Dar Al-Hijrah Executive Committee, and four other members.\\"Dar Al-Hijrah Islamic Center, Home, About us, Constitution\\", accessed December 10, 2009 Directors serve for five-year terms, and new directors are elected by the currently serving directors.

Outreach Dar Al-Hijrah is active in community outreach and service, and promoting mutual understanding in the local area. It participates in community food, back-to-school supply, and clean-up drives, is engaged in interfaith projects, and participates in civil rights work. Its social services department provides food, clothing, and other household items to needy local families of all faiths. During the Islamic month of Ramadan, Dar Al-Hijrah serves everyone who wants to come eat, whether Muslim or non-Muslim; over 800 free meals every night. Also during Ramadan, it sponsors interfaith and civic iftar dinners with different faith groups to promote mutual understanding. It also distributes tens of thousands of dollars in zakat every Ramadan. Controversy The FBI Director of Counter-Intelligence for the Middle East, Gordon M. Snow, was a frequent, weekly attendee of the services in spring and summer 2001, while also completing his master's degree 3 miles away. Several sources indicated that Nidal Malik Hasan, the sole suspect in the November 5, 2009 Fort Hood shooting, attended the Dar Al-Hijrah mosque at the same time in 2001 as Nawaf al-Hazmi and Hani Hanjour (two of the September 11 hijackers), who attended the mosque for several weeks during 2001 when Anwar al-Awlaki was imam there; a law enforcement official said that the FBI will probably look into whether Hasan associated with the hijackers.Fort Hood shooting: Texas army killer linked to September 11 terrorists, The Telegraph, November 7, 2009Alleged Shooter Tied to Mosque of 9/11 Hijackers, The New York Times, November 8, 2009Sperry, Paul E., Infiltration: how Muslim spies and subversives have penetrated Washington, Chapter 12: \\"The 9/11 Mosque: Dar al- Hijrah,\\" p. 110, Thomas Nelson Inc (2005), , accessed November 11, 2009Thompson, Paul, The terror timeline: year by year, day by day, minute by minute : a comprehensive chronicle of the road to 9/11--- and America's response, p. 172, Harper Collins (2004), , accessed November 12, 2009 The mosque issued a statement condemning the Fort Hood shootings, and al-Awlaki's praise of them.

Ashqar, November 21, 2007, accessed December 7, 2009 Jeffrey Goldberg, in his 2008 book Prisoners: A Story of Friendship and Terror, characterizes Dar Al-Hijrah as an openly political mosque that has conducted militant Friday sermons, especially prior to the September 11 attacks. The Washington Post reported that its leaders have strongly criticized U.S. law enforcement actions against Muslims and U.S. policies in the Middle East. The Washington Post also reported that the mosque is closely affiliated with the Muslim American Society, which has been linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. In May 2017, Shaker Elsayed, the head imam of the Center, said in a video that he recommended removing a young girl's labia and clitoris, also known as female circumcision or female genital mutilation (FGM): > This is something that a Muslim gynecologist can tell you if you need to or > not‚Ä¶ There used to be a lady who used to do this for women, or, I mean, > young girls. She is expected to cut only the tip of the sexual sensitive > part in the girl, so that she is not hypersexually active. This is the > purpose... you see in societies where circumcision of girls is completely > prohibited, hypersexuality takes over the entire society, and a woman is not > satisfied with one person, or two, or three. This, God forbid, is now > happening even in Muslim societies where they prohibit circumcision. They > use a mistake in practice to prohibit the tradition, and they end up causing > a lot of damage on the extreme side of the sexual life of the woman. The comments were brought to light by a tweet by the Middle East Media Research Institute in June, which links to the video, originally posted on the mosque's YouTube channel. The mosque issued a statement condemning Shaker Elsayed's remarks and stating that FGM is \\"prohibited in Islam as well as the laws of the land.\\" Anwar al-Awlaki Anwar al-Awlaki was Imam at the mosque between January 2001 and April 2002. He has been accused since of being a senior al-Qaeda recruiter and motivator linked to various terrorists, including three 9/11 hijackers, the accused Fort Hood shooter, and the accused Christmas Day 2009 bomber. Supporters of the mosque say that al-Awlaki publicly condemned the 9/11 attacks, and was not known to give radical speeches at the time. But writing on the IslamOnline.net website six days after the 9/11 attacks, he suggested that Israeli intelligence agents might have been responsible for the attacks, and that the FBI \\"went into the roster of the airplanes and whoever has a Muslim or Arab name became the hijacker by default.\\"Schmidt, Susan; Imam From Va.

Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf Al-Hazmi set up their base of operations in San Diego upon their arrival in the US with the assistance of a number of people who were later investigated by the FBI and press. They established a close relationship with Awlaki, who had been imam of the Masjid Ar-Ribat al-Islami mosque since 1996. After leaving San Diego and Arizona in 2001 and moving to Falls Church, Virginia, Hani Hanjour specified the Virginia mosque in Falls Church as his forwarding mailing address. FBI Summary He and Al-Hazmi attended Awlaki's sermons at the Virginia mosque. The 9/11 Commission Report, prepared after the attacks had taken place, concluded the men's appearances at Al- Alwaki's mosque \\"may not have been coincidental\\". The Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan attended the mosque for the funeral of his mother in May 2001, likely arranged by his brother who lived in Virginia.

Preassembled process unit for air pollution control, i.e., a thermal oxidizer, being installed at a work site. Schematic of a basic thermal oxidizer A thermal oxidizer (also known as thermal oxidiser, or thermal incinerator) is a process unit for air pollution control in many chemical plants that decomposes hazardous gases at a high temperature and releases them into the atmosphere. Principle Thermal oxidizers are typically used to destroy hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from industrial air streams . These pollutants are generally hydrocarbon based and when destroyed via thermal combustion they are chemically oxidized to form CO2 and H2O. Three main factors in designing the effective thermal oxidizers are temperature, residence time, and turbulence. The temperature needs to be high enough to ignite the waste gas. Most organic compounds ignite at the temperature between and . To ensure near destruction of hazardous gases, most basic oxidizers are operated at much higher temperature levels. When catalyst is used, the operating temperature range may be lower. Residence time is to ensure that there is enough time for the combustion reaction to occur. The turbulence factor is the mixture of combustion air with the hazardous gases. Technologies=Direct fired thermal oxidizer - afterburner Direct- fired thermal oxidizer using landfill gas as fuel Regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) sized for 17,000 standard cubic feet per minute (SCFM). Control center with a programmable logic controller for a RTO. The simplest technology of thermal oxidation is direct-fired thermal oxidizer. A process stream with hazardous gases is introduced into a firing box through or near the burner and enough residence time is provided to get the desired destruction removal efficiency (DRE) of the VOCs. Most direct-fired thermal oxidizers operate at temperature levels between and with air flow rates of 0.24 to 24 standard cubic meters per second. Also called afterburners in the cases where the input gases come from a process where combustion is incomplete, these systems are the least capital intensive, and can be integrated with downstream boilers and heat exchangers to optimize fuel efficiency. Thermal Oxidizers are best applied where there is a very high concentration of VOCs to act as the fuel source (instead of natural gas or oil) for complete combustion at the targeted operating temperature. Regenerative thermal oxidizer (RTO) One of today's most widely accepted air pollution control technologies across industry is a regenerative thermal oxidizer, commonly referred to as a RTO. RTOs use a ceramic bed which is heated from a previous oxidation cycle to preheat the input gases to partially oxidize them. The preheated gases enter a combustion chamber that is heated by an external fuel source to reach the target oxidation temperature which is in the range between and . The final temperature may be as high as for applications that require maximum destruction. The air flow rates are 2.4 to 240 standard cubic meters per second. RTOs are very versatile and extremely efficient ‚Äì thermal efficiency can reach 95%. They are regularly used for abating solvent fumes, odours, etc. from a wide range of industries. Regenerative Thermal Oxidizers are ideal in a range of low to high VOC concentrations up to 10 g/m3 solvent. There are currently many types Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer on the market with the capability of 99.5+% Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) oxidization or destruction efficiency. The ceramic heat exchanger(s) in the towers can be designed for thermal efficiencies as high as 97+%. Ventilation air methane thermal oxidizer (VAMTOX) Ventilation air methane thermal oxidizers are used to destroy methane in the exhaust air of underground coal mine shafts. Methane is a greenhouse gas and, when oxidized via thermal combustion, is chemically altered to form CO2 and H2O. CO2 is 25 times less potent than methane when emitted into the atmosphere with regards to global warming. Concentrations of methane in mine ventilation exhaust air of coal and trona mines are very dilute; typically below 1% and often below 0.5%. VAMTOX units have a system of valves and dampers that direct the air flow across one or more ceramic filled bed(s). On start-up, the system preheats by raising the temperature of the heat exchanging ceramic material in the bed(s) at or above the auto-oxidation temperature of methane , at which time the preheating system is turned off and mine exhaust air is introduced. Then the methane-filled air reaches the preheated bed(s), releasing the heat from combustion. This heat is then transferred back to the bed(s), thereby maintaining the temperature at or above what is necessary to support auto-thermal operation. Thermal recuperative oxidizer A less commonly used thermal oxidizer technology is a thermal recuperative oxidizer. Thermal recuperative oxidizers have a primary and/or secondary heat exchanger within the system. A primary heat exchanger preheats the incoming dirty air by recuperating heat from the exiting clean air. This is done by a shell and tube heat exchanger or a plate heat exchanger. As the incoming air passes on one side of the metal tube or plate, hot clean air from the combustion chamber passes on the other side of the tube or plate and heat is transferred to the incoming air through the process of conduction using the metal as the medium of heat transfer. In a secondary heat exchanger the same concept applies for heat transfer, but the air being heated by the outgoing clean process stream is being returned to another part of the plant ‚Äì perhaps back to the process. Biomass fired thermal oxidizer Biomass, such as wood chips, can be used as the fuel for a thermal oxidizer. The biomass is then gasified and the stream with hazardous gases is mixed with the biomass gas in a firing box. Sufficient turbulence, retention time, oxygen content and temperature will ensure destruction of the VOC's. Such biomass fired thermal oxidizer has been installed at Warwick Mills, New Hampshire. The inlet concentrations are between 3000‚Äì10.000 ppm VOC. The outlet concentration of VOC are below 3 ppm, thus having a VOC destruction efficiency of 99.8‚Äì99.9%.http://www.dallenergy.com/Thermal-oxidizer.70.aspx Flameless thermal oxidizer (FTO) In a flameless thermal oxidizer system waste gas, ambient air, and auxiliary fuel are premixed prior to passing the combined gaseous mixture through a preheated inert ceramic media bed. Through the transfer of heat from the ceramic media to the gaseous mixture the organic compounds in the gas are oxidized to innocuous byproducts, i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) while also releasing heat into the ceramic media bed. The gas mixture temperature is kept below the lower flammability limit based on the percentages of each organic species present. Flameless thermal oxidizers are designed to operate safely and reliably below the composite LFL while maintaining a constant operating temperature. Waste gas streams experience multiple seconds of residence time at high temperatures leading to measured destruction removal efficiencies that exceed 99.9999%. Premixing all of the gases prior to treatment eliminates localized high temperatures which leads to thermal NOx typically below 2 ppmV. Flameless thermal oxidizer technology was originally developed at the U.S. Department of Energy to more efficiently convert energy in burners, process heaters, and other thermal systems. Catalytic oxidizer Schematic of Recuperative Catalytic Oxidizer Catalytic oxidizer (also known as catalytic incinerator) is another category of oxidation systems that is similar to typical thermal oxidizers, but the catalytic oxidizers use a catalyst to promote the oxidation. Catalytic oxidation occurs through a chemical reaction between the VOC hydrocarbon molecules and a precious-metal catalyst bed that is internal to the oxidizer system. A catalyst is a substance that is used to accelerate the rate of a chemical reaction, allowing the reaction to occur in a normal temperature range between and . Regenerative catalytic oxidizer (RCO) The catalyst can be used in a Regenerative Thermal Oxidizer (RTO) to allow lower operating temperatures. This is also called Regenerative Catalytic Oxidizer or RCO. For example, the thermal ignition temperature of carbon monoxide is normally . By utilizing a suitable oxidation catalyst, the ignition temperature can be reduced to around . This can result in lower operating costs than a RTO. Most systems operate within the to degree range. Some systems are designed to operate both as RCOs and RTOs. When these systems are used special design considerations are utilized to reduce the probability of overheating (dilution of inlet gas or recycling), as these high temperatures would deactivate the catalyst, e.g. by sintering of the active material. Recuperative catalytic oxidizer Catalytic oxidizers can also be in the form of recuperative heat recovery to reduce the fuel requirement. In this form of heat recovery, the hot exhaust gases from the oxidizer pass through an heat exchanger to heat the new incoming air to the oxidizer.

Primarily a goal-kicking or and goal-kicker, during his 14-year top-grade career he played with several clubs in both Australia and England, which included two NSWRL premierships, a Challenge Cup victory as well as state and national representative honours. However O'Neill also regularly made headlines for his involvement in numerous controversial off-field incidents. Early life O'Neill was born in Hornsby, New South Wales on 14 October 1972. His mother, Annabelle O'Neill, a nursing sister, was killed in a car crash when he was five. His father, Brian Allan O'Neill, a gynaecologist, died of heart disease when Julian was six. O'Neill was raised by his grandparents and other family members from time to time. From age ten he attended boarding school at St Brendan's College in Yeppoon, Queensland. He was a prodigious young sportsman, holding school records in athletics and swimming. He represented as an Australian Schoolboy in both rugby league and cricket. Playing career O'Neill was signed to a sporting scholarship with the Brisbane Broncos at age fifteen and was selected for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1989. 1990s O'Neill was graded by the Broncos in 1991 and it was hoped he would take over the position from Broncos great Wally Lewis. He showed greater form at and played there in Brisbane's inaugural Grand Final victory in 1992. In the weeks following the grand final O'Neill travelled with the Broncos to England, where he played at fullback in the 1992 World Club Challenge against British champions Wigan, helping Brisbane become the first NSWRL club to win the match in Britain. O'Neill briefly signed for English club Widnes, who were then coached by Phil Larder and he appeared as a substitute in the 1993 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, only to suffer a 20-14 defeat by Wigan. O'Neill first represented Queensland, coming off the interchange bench, in Game II of the 1993 State of Origin series. He played at five-eighth in Game III. The Broncos reached the 1993 Winfield Cup Grand Final and O'Neill played at fullback as they again beat St. George for a second consecutive premiership title. O'Neill then played at fullback in all three games of the 1994 State of Origin series under coach Wally Lewis. During the 1994 NSWRL season, O'Neill played at lock forward for defending premiers Brisbane when they hosted British champions Wigan for the 1994 World Club Challenge, but were defeated by the British club on this occasion. In 1994 and 1995 O'Neill was the Brisbane Broncos' top point-scorer. As his fame and confidence grew at the Broncos, O'Neill found himself at the centre of a number of alcohol- fuelled incidents. At Southport Magistrates Court in 1995 he faced five charges, following an incident at Conrad Jupiters Casino where he was reported to have urinated under a blackjack table, including indecent exposure and offensive behavior. He was found not guilty, three fraud charges were dropped and he was awarded costs.Australian Story article However he was sacked by the Broncos in 1995 for drink-driving whilst in England. After being released by the Brisbane Broncos, O'Neill played a season with the London Broncos but was released by them as well after a drink-driving offence. O'Neill made a fresh start back in Australia with the Western Reds in 1996 ARL season. Whilst playing for them he was selected to play for Queensland at in Game II of the 1996 State of Origin series. He was playing for the Super League-aligned Western Reds during the 1997 split competition and made one state and one national representative appearance for the Super League representative teams: O'Neill was selected to play for Australia from the interchange bench in the inaugural Anzac Test and at fullback for Queensland in Game 1 of the Super League Tri-series. O'Neill set club records for most tries and goals in a match but was released by the Reds in 1997 after being fined and disqualified from driving in Perth's Magistrates Court. O'Neill made another clean start, switching to play in the 1997 ARL season with the South Sydney Rabbitohs. He gained selection for Queensland, playing from the interchange bench in Game II of the 1997 State of Origin series. In 1998 however he suffered immense publicity and a $10,000 fine from the club over a 1999 pre-season tour incident where a drunken O'Neill defecated in the footwear of teammate Jeremy Schloss. This incident became known as \\"the poo in the shoe\\" affair, and gained much media attention and public ridicule after O'Neill reportedly uttered the alliterative line, \\"I just shat in Schlossy's shoe,\\" to his teammates. For a time he was engaged to Australian swimming star Samantha Riley, but the engagement ended after Riley, who was renowned for having a clean-living reputation despite being embroiled in a drugs controversy herself in the lead-up to the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, reportedly grew tired of O'Neill's alcohol consumption and subsequent reckless behaviour. 2000s O'Neill was signed to play the 2000 NRL season for the North Queensland Cowboys and was selected to play at five-eighth in Game II of the 2000 State of Origin series. He was then named the Cowboys' player of the year.Honours at cowboys.com.au He made a total of ten career State of Origin appearances. In 2001, O'Neill's 13-month-old daughter, Piper, was killed when a television set fell onto her in his family's home.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2002/apr/27/rugbyleague.wiganwarrior O'Neill returned to England the 2002 Super League season for the Wigan Warriors, enjoying victory in the Challenge Cup, until 2003 when he completed a mid-season move to the Widnes Vikings. In 2004, while on a pre-season trip to Australia with the Widnes Vikings, he was accused of drunkenly attempting to set fire to a 13-year-old boy who was wearing a foam-rubber dolphin mascot suit whilst on a river cruise in Port Macquarie. To avoid apprehension, O'Neill stripped to his underwear following the incident, dived into the Hastings River and swam to shore, before hitchhiking and being picked up by a passing car.Dolphin Suit In 2004, he had a season playing rugby union in France. O'Neill returned to rugby league in England in 2005 and played half the season with the Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, then switching back to former club the Widnes Vikings until their relegation from the Super League that year. He then moved to also relegated Leigh Centurions for the 2006 season. In 2015, O'Neill was involved in an ugly facebook saga with former player Jack Elsegood. O'Neill had posted a comment congratulating his son Ethan on making the Queensland Under 16 team, Elsegood then forwarded the message onto O'Neill's ex-wife. O'Neill then took to facebook and messaged Elsegood saying \\"Cheers to Jack Elsegood for sending my Facebook status to my ex wife ‚Äì a dog.

Born in Watford, Goodson studied the piano at the Royal Academy of Music in London; she also worked with Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna. Her London debut took place on 16 January 1897. The tours of Europe which followed placed her in the front rank of British female pianists of the era. Goodson made her American debut on 18 January 1907, appearing as soloist with the Boston Symphony in a concert in the orchestra's home city. Goodson died in London in 1958. Life and career=Early life and training Katharine Goodson was born in 1872, the second child of Charles and Sarah Goodson of Watford, England. She had two brothers, Arthur and Ernest, and a sister, Ethel. As a child Goodson was reputed to play the violin better than the piano and it was her then teacher, noting that 'she had a perfect piano hand', who said that she should focus on the piano 'rather than master neither'. At 12, having already made several appearances in the English provinces, she entered the Royal Academy of Music, studying under Oscar Beringer between 1886 and 1892. After an invitation to play for the renowned pianist Ignacy Jan Paderewski, she was introduced to his former teacher Theodor Leschetizky in Vienna, himself once a student of Beethoven's own friend and pupil, Carl Czerny. Goodson spent four years studying with Leschetizky and despite having previously lost out on a scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, her performance of the Tschaikowsky Concerto halfway through her studies so impressed Leschestizky that he refused to take any payment for her final two years. Early career On leaving Leschetizky in 1896, Goodson was introduced to the conductor and violinist Eug√®ne Ysa√øe and played with him in Brussels. This forged a meeting with the American violinist Maud Powell, with whom she played numerous concerts, paving the way for engagements across Belgium, Germany and the South of France and rapidly establishing her presence in continental Europe. Goodson based herself in London through this period, debuting there in 1897, in Berlin in 1899 and in Vienna in 1900. Between 1902 and 1904 she toured extensively with the Czech violinist and composer Jan Kubel√≠k. When her sister Ethel, who had stayed with her during much of her time in Vienna, went to Budapest to become the governess to the son of Count Istv√°n Tisza, the Prime Minister of Hungary, Goodson went to stay with academic and parliamentarian William Martin Conway, 1st Baron Conway of Allington and his wife Lady Katrina Conway at their London house. It was Leschetizky who again sought to further Goodson's career with an introduction to the conductor Art√∫r Nikisch. At the concert hall Gewandhaus, Leipzieg she played Schumann's 'Pappillona' and Grieg's 'A Minor'. After the performance, Nikisch congratulated her: ‚ÄúI have known many artists during my life, and many soloists, but the true musicians I can count on the fingers of one hand, d'Albert, Ys√§ye, Paderewski, and to those you belong, Miss Goodson.‚Äù American debut Katharine Goodson, from a 1907 publication announcing her American debut. Nikisch and Goodson toured widely together across Germany, and on her return to London the two met again, whereupon Nikisch arranged for her debut engagement with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. The appearance nearly didn't happen. While making the Atlantic crossing, two days from Boston, her ship encountered a hurricane and a piece of ice, broken away from icebergs further north, crashed through the heavy plate glass of Goodson's stateroom window as she was resting before dinner, landing within a foot of her head. Having narrowly avoided injury, her Boston unveiling came on 18 January 1907 to wide acclaim. The Boston Transcript wrote: ‚ÄúHer interpretation was poetic, supplying that indispensable sense of imaginative atmosphere essential to Grieg, while containing precisely that right pitch of bravura abandon, of dramatic sensuousness which the concerto demands. Her rhythm is incisive, full of fire, and yet, when the occasion demands, elastic.‚Äù Violinist Franz Kneisel was present and immediately engaged her to play with his Kneisal Quartette at further concerts in Boston and New York. Through this relationship Goodson became instrumental in the American popularisation of her composer husband Arthur Hinton, giving the first performances of his 'Piano Quintet', 'Trio in D Minor' and later his 'Rhapsody' and many other pieces for piano, notably the 'Rigaudon', 'Fireflies' from 'A Summer Pilgrimage' and 'Romance in A flat'. International career Hinton's own work equally favoured Goodson's career. Following her second American tour and a brief spell back in London, Hinton was invited to go to Australia to conduct the music exams for its Royal Schools of Music and a tour there was arranged for Goodson. Despite some trepidation on her part ‚Äì noting that both Paderewski and pianist Mar√≠a Teresa Carre√±o had recently toured there, while their peer Mark Hambourg was halfway through his third Australian tour ‚Äì she was greeted with enthusiasm. A third American tour immediately followed where her appearances included working with the conductors Vasily Safonov and Ossip Gabrilowitsch. With violinist Bronis≈Çaw Huberman and cellist Felix Salmond she contributed to the Beethoven Association concerts, raising funds for the association's publication of Thayer's Life of Beethoven. It was after her fourth American tour that Goodson furthered her horizons with a tour of Jamaica in early 1915. Critical acclaim was again poured on her, although it was a night encounter at Parson Green's Mission House in a roofless room that perhaps made the greater impression on Goodson. She wrote: ‚ÄúWe had ten rat-bats in our room that night, innumerable lizards on the walls and mosquitoes ad infinitum. We wrapped our heads in scarves, but I can truthfully say I do not think I lost consciousness for five minutes during that longest night I have ever spent, for it was a succession of swoops, and creeps, and bites! Ugh!‚Äù Goodson spent much of 1916 in North America, performing at fundraising concerts for the Red Cross and Canadian prisoners of war. In all, her international career took her to North America over a total of seven separate tours, including two world tours that she shared with the Australian soprano Dame Nellie Melba. She also toured Java and Sumatra and developed a presence in the Nordic region with a tour of Norway, Sweden and Finland. In May 1918 Goodson claimed to become the first woman to give a recital at the Albert Hall, London, playing a Chopin programme on behalf of the Kensington War Hospital Supply Depot. The Pall Mall Gazette noted: ‚ÄúHer reception was extraordinarily enthusiastic and the stage was literally inundated with bouquets.‚Äù Later career Goodson's international presence remained dominant throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The latter decade also brought with it Goodson's first experience playing with the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, in 1931. The two maintained a lasting professional relationship, based on a mutual appreciation. Following Beecham's \\"Vocal Birthday Tribute to Delius\\" in 1932, the Daily Sketch noted: ‚ÄúGoodson played the solo part so attractively that once Sir Thomas was caught by a sudden pause singing his own satisfaction over it.‚Äù It was also Beecham, who in 1936, encouraged Goodson to diversify and tour performing a harpsichord concerto. The Daily Telegraph wrote: ‚ÄúFor a famous Leschetizky pupil, it must have seemed like exchanging big guns for bows and arrows. Miss Goodson seemed to have taken to the new arm as to the manner born‚Äù. The Second World War interrupted Goodson's later career, during which she experienced the destruction of her London home in the Blitz, followed shortly by the death of her husband and then further extensive bomb damage to her country home. Nevertheless, in 1944‚Äì1945 she returned to the piano to play with the conductors Sir Adrian Boult, Sir Henry Wood and Basil Cameron. In April 1947 Goodson appeared again with Beecham, shortly before making her first television appearance, which she swiftly followed by a return to radio in an appearance with the BBC Scottish Orchestra under the conductor Ian Whyte. Although Goodson made few broadcastings and fewer recordings, leaving her legacy largely unheard to contemporary audiences, those recordings that do exist remain well regarded. Family, marriage and friends=Family Goodson ‚Äì known to her family as 'Kaigee' ‚Äì was supported in her career by her family from a young age. She wrote of losing a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music as a girl and the words her father spoke afterwards: ‚Äú‚ÄòWill you memorise something for me tonight and never forget it?‚Äô I smiled at him through my tears. ‚ÄòOf course I will, Daddy. What is it?‚Äô ‚ÄòFailures,‚Äô he said, holding up his fingers for emphasis, ‚Äòare with heroic minds the stepping stones to success.‚Äô‚Äù Goodson claimed these words helped maintain her resolve throughout her career. Her younger sister Ethel, who accompanied Goodson to Vienna, was especially close to her and Goodson was bereft when, early in her career, Ethel moved to Hungary to become a governess, claiming that without her ‚Äúthere seemed no one to whom I could have a real heart to heart talk and who would understand my longings and aspirations‚Äù. Her mother, too, was close, once writing effusively to Goodson: ‚ÄúIf I have really been able to help you one little bit, the comfort, the joy is all mine, for you know how, did it belong to me, I would lay the whole world of wealth and love and glory at your feet. You should be a Queen of Fairyland forevermore.‚Äù Goodson herself evidently had a playful side. En route to Boston for her American debut she and her husband dined with some elderly society ladies, who enquired after their profession. For some days, to the horror of the Bostonians, the two musicians kept up the pretence that they were circus performers and had a camel called Gertrude in the ship's hold. On arrival in Boston, a newspaper printed a light-hearted story about an expensive and naive trip Goodson had made to a Monte Carlo casino. Two elderly spinsters promptly returned their tickets saying that ‚Äúthey did not know that Katharine Goodson was that kind of girl!‚Äù Goodson wrote: ‚ÄúI felt that I had not only lost my money but my reputation too.‚Äù Marriage During Goodson's time in Vienna Arthur Hinton, a fellow Royal Academian and London friend (with whom she had played in the Academy Orchestra), was studying in the city under Karl Navratil and the two spent much of their time together. Later Hinton went to Munich to study composition with Josef Rheinberger. When they both returned to London, Hinton became a regular visitor of the Conways, with whom Goodson lived as she sought to establish her career. The two married in 1903. She said of him: ‚ÄúI think Arthur Hinton must have mesmerized me into marrying him, for I had decided never, never to marry; everybody thought my career might be spoilt should I do so, but somehow or other our minds and hearts seemed to have been drawing ever nearer. We had the same ideals of work and living, loving the same artistic life, the same surroundings, even to books and furniture, and always nearly the same people.‚Äù The two travelled widely together in their career, never having children, but sharing a close marriage. Hinton wrote to her during her American tour of 1930: ‚ÄúI am filled with the same love, which neither time, nor space, nor anything that life may bring will ever have power to change‚Äù. Hinton died in 1941. A year later, as part of a long eulogy, Goodson wrote of him in terms of their shared passion: ‚ÄúI keep you where the music is, that is the best place‚Äù. Friends, colleagues & pupils Goodson's career introduced her to the elite of the musical, artistic and political worlds. She counted among her musical friends her mentor Leschetizky ‚Äì who called her 'De Liebe Katie', Paderewski, Nikisch, Nellie Melba, Dohn√°nyi, Carre√±o, Beecham, Henry Wood, Mathilde Marchesi, Ysa√øe, Elgar, Gabrilowitsch and his wife Clara Clemens. Other friends in the arts included the actress Eleonora Duse and Clemens' father Samuel, better known under his pen name, Mark Twain. Of Melba, known for having a demanding personality, Goodson spoke warmly: ‚ÄúI had heard people say that the great singer was cold and unresponsive; she seemed to me exactly the reverse, a generous impulsive ardour continually bubbled forth, combined with much fun and merriment, which frequently showed itself when she was free of conventional surroundings‚Äù. Goodson also carried on the Leschetizky tradition, writing extensively on piano technique as well as taking on pupils of her own, including Sir Clifford Curzon, Mark Hambourg's acclaimed daughter, Michal, while the Canadian writer Elizabeth Smart also studied with her. International acclaim Daily Telegraph, UK: Katharine Goodson's performance in the Tschaikowsky Concerto was the other big event of the evening. The Concerto was all radiance, romantic, exuberant, idyllic, heroic, flamboyant: a furore followed. Evening Standard, UK: The highest of the week-end high spots on the wireless was Katharine Goodson's performance of the Greig Concerto with the BBC Orchestra last night. There was the sympathetic insight of the cultured artist in her interpretation, and a touch that was both resolute and pliable in her performance. I cannot remember when a piano forte artist came over better. San Francisco Globe, US: She is a poetess, one of the greatest piano-artists of the day. Winnipeg Free Press, Canada: Stands absolutely in the front rank of any living pianist in the world today. Toronto World, Canada: To be capable of perfection in such gems of musical art establishes Miss Goodson among the genuine artists. Sydney Morning Herald, Australia: She is indeed the feminine counterpart of that most perfect of all pianists, Paderewski. Le Figaro, France: Incomparable technique, superb tone. Idun, Sweden: A genius, an inspired artist. M√ºnchner Staatzeitung, Germany: It was astounding to hear how deeply she penetrated into the profoundness of the Brahms Sonate in F minor. Vienna Times, Austria: Virtuosity, temperament, expression and personality place her on top of my list of eminent pianists. Pesti Maplo, Hungary: The piano playing of Katharine Goodson is a genuinely monumental art, which we today, among the names of women pianists, can only associate with those of Theresa Carreno and Sofie Menter. Our eminent guest played the F Minor of Brahms in such a broadly conceived spirit and with such a gripping rhythm and power as would have done honour to d'Albert. Pesti Maplo, Hungary: Her playing is not merely an aesthetic function: it is an aesthetic revelation. References *David Ewen, Encyclopedia of Concert Music.

The Reservation is made up of three distinct camps: Camp Delmont, Camp Hart, and Camp Garrison. The reservation is part of the largest contiguous forest in Southeastern Pennsylvania. The camp is owned by the Cradle of Liberty Council. The Cradle of Liberty Council, Natural Lands Trust, Montgomery County Lands Trust, and Montgomery County signed a perpetual conservation easement permanently protecting over of the Musser Scout Reservation. History Prior to 1996, the Philadelphia Council owned and operated Camp Hart, while the Valley Forge Council owned and operated Camp Delmont. Subsequent to the merger of these councils in 1996, these adjacent camps joined to create a new reservation. Initially, this merged Scout camp was called \\"Delmont-Hart Scout Reservation\\". Later, the camps were renamed under \\"Musser Scout Reservation\\", to honor Pete Musser, a financial contributor. Camps=Camp Delmont Camp Delmont was named after the two counties that made up the original Delmont Council (DELaware and MONTgomery Counties Council, later known as The Valley Forge Council). For many years, Delmont consisted of two camps: Camp Cedar, which focused on one-week camping, and Camp Pioneer, which focused on two-week camping. As such, Delmont was a \\"Scout Reservation,\\" since included more than one camp. In later years, as Valley Forge Council focused summer camp on Resica Falls Scout Reservation, Camp Cedar was used for residential Webelos summer camp and Camp Pioneer was allowed to return to nature. Summer Camp was first held there in 1916. Camp Hart Hart Scout Reservation was first opened in 1930, and has been in continuous operation since the first summer of operation. The property was provided in an endowment by Dr. Charles D. Hart, and he is honored in the titling of the Camp. There are two distinct areas of Camp Hart divided by the Unami Creek. The western portion of the camp currently hosts Cradle of Liberty Council Leader training programs, and acts of the focal site of the council Cub Adventures summer resident camp for Cub Scouts and Webelos. Camp Garrison Camp Garrison was named after Walter R. Garrison, a major contributor to the building of the camp.

Publication details  *Written by David Anthony Durham *First published: Doubleday, United States, 2002. *Also published in Portuguese  Plot summary  When he learns that his pregnant wife has been spirited off to a distant city, William responds as any man might‚Äîhe drops everything to pursue her. But as a fugitive slave in antebellum America, he must run a terrifying gauntlet, eluding the many who would re-enslave him while learning to trust the few who dare to aid him on his quest. Among those hunting William is Morrison, a Scot who as a young man fled the miseries of his homeland only to discover more brutal realities in the New World. Bearing many scars, including the loss of his beloved brother, Morrison tracks William for reasons of his own, a personal agenda rooted in tragic events that have haunted him for decades. Walk Through Darkness is a provocative meditation on racial identity, freedom and equality. It followed Durham's award-winning Gabriel's Story and preceded his bestselling Pride of Carthage.

The piece was first recorded by the Keystone Winds in 1995's Past The Equinox: The Music of Jack Stamp.  Composition  Gavorkna Fanfare was commissioned by Eugene Corporon of Michigan State University. The introduction is characterized by a rapid cluster of ascending dissonant intervals. The exposition begins as the trumpets introduce the A theme, consisting of motoric sixteenth notes followed by an eighth note ascending three note pattern outlining a minor scale. This repeats several times in rhythmic diminution and canonic juxtaposing in different instruments. The A theme concludes with a cadential resting point, as the percussion section introduces a layered ostinato as a backdrop for the B Section fugue. The fugue theme is introduced in the horns, and answered in the trombones. Each time the theme is re-stated, it is varied using ornamentation based on the skeletal thematic material of the original fugue theme. The third entrance is in the trumpets and the final entrance is in the tubas and bass trombone. A brief chordal transition returns the listener to the recapitulated A theme, and ultimately cadences on a major triad with a prominent timpani solo echoing a final rhythmic variation of the B theme fugue.

The station offers talk and music programming targeted towards African-American listeners, including a mixture of locally originated talk programming and urban oldies music. The station is owned by Richardson Broadcasting Corporation, a company based in Birmingham. Richardson Broadcasting Corporation also owns WAYE 1220 AM in Birmingham, Alabama and has construction permits for low power television stations in Dothan, Montgomery and Selma Alabama. The station's studios and transmitter are located separately in Southwest Birmingham. Station history Originally licensed to nearby Bessemer, Alabama, WJLD began in 1942 as an affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System. It was the fourth station licensed to serve the Birmingham area, following WAPI, WBRC and WSGN. Programming on WJLD initially consisted of popular music, news programs and radio adventure shows such as Superman and Tom Mix. In 1943, the station began selling airtime to people who sang or played urban contemporary gospel music. Throughout the 1940s and into the early 1950s, the station broadcast, by today's standards, a wide variety of music programming, including country music and gospel music as well as rhythm and blues music. On May 23, 1948, WJLD launched a companion FM station, WJLN-FM (104.7). The FM station originally simulcast much of the programming of the AM station, but by the late 1960s began playing album- oriented rock music at night. In the mid-1970s, the FM station assumed its current call letters, WZZK; the WJLD owners sold WZZK some years later. In 1954, WJLD began exclusively targeting African-American listeners with a mix of music and talk programming. Until the debut of WENN-FM in 1969, it was the only black-oriented station in Birmingham that broadcast at night, since the other similarly-formatted AM station was required by the Federal Communications Commission to sign off at sunset. During the mid-1970s, it was one of four AM stations in the Birmingham market competing for African- American listeners. With the increased popularity of FM stations during the 1970s and early 1980s, WJLD began adding more talk programming to its format and decreased the amount of current music in its rotation. In 1989, the station dropped current music entirely and became a full-time urban oldies station. The 2000s have witnessed a continued commitment to serving the Birmingham area's African-American community on WJLD's part. Station owner Gary Richardson, a longtime employee, hosts a two-hour morning talk show, and the station presently programs a blues and Southern soul music format six days a week, with both local personalities and the syndicated Mississippi-based American Blues Network. Richardson is also the mayor of the Birmingham suburb of Midfield. In keeping with tradition, Sunday programming consists of gospel music and church broadcasts. In 2008 Richardson Broadcasting acquired the license for W281AB, an FM translator at 104.1 MHz broadcasting at 250 watts. WJLD 1400 began simulcasting on 104.1 soon afterward. This lasted until July 29, 2011, when W281AB switched to a simulcast of WMJJ-HD2.

The symphony was discovered by Fritz Stein in 1909 in the archives of a concert society in Jena, from which it derived its name. Stein believed it to be the work of Beethoven and it was so published by Breitkopf und H√§rtel in 1911. It is now known that the piece was the work of Friedrich Witt (born the same year as Beethoven). History Stein thought it was quite likely an early work by Beethoven and pointed out some stylistic similarities in the preface to the score. From each of the four movements he singled out a few passages he considered especially Beethoven-like. Stein's belief in Beethoven's authorship was strengthened by the fact that Beethoven's letters show that prior to writing his own Symphony No. 1 he tried to write a C major symphony with Joseph Haydn's Symphony No. 97 as a model,N. Marston, \\"Symphonies\\" in The Beethoven Compendium, ed. Barry Cooper. Ann Arbor: Borders Group (1995): 214 and it is easy to find parallels between the Jena Symphony and Haydn's No. 97. When H. C. Robbins Landon found another copy of the work at the archives of G√∂ttweig Abbey with Witt's name on it, he convinced most other scholars that the work was in fact by Witt. Ralph Leavis, for example, condemned the work as \\"a piece of plagiarism, put together almost with scissors and paste from reminiscences of Haydn.\\"Leavis, Ralph. \\"Witt, Friedrich\\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, Stanley Sadie, ed. Volume 20. London: Macmillan Publishers Limited (1980) Analysis In four movements, the symphony is scored for flute, 2 oboes, 2 bassoons, 2 horns in C, 2 trumpets in C, timpani and strings. The first movement begins with an Adagio introduction of 20 measures. A sonata form movement follows with a mostly triadic first subject group 400px and a more dance-like second subject group. 500px The exposition has a repeat (not always followed in performance). The development of just 30 measures ends with a crescendo leading directly to the recapitulation. The second movement in F major has a central section in F minor. 500px The timpano in C is used in this movement (the timpani were set to C and G for the first movement and are not changed in the course of work). The third movement is a Minuet with Trio. 500px The fourth movement begins piano. 500px The handling of the winds in this movement led some scholars to believe (before Robbins Landon's discovery) that perhaps this movement was in fact written by Beethoven while the rest was written by an unknown composer. Recordings The Jena Symphony has been recorded on: * LP (33‚Öì rpm), on the Turnabout Records label (owned by Vox Records) by the Westphalian Symphony Orchestra conducted by Hubert Reichert (1971, Vox Production).

Box and its screenplay was written by the novelist Nicholas Phipps. The film was based on the evacuation of Alderney cattle from the Channel Island during World War II.Alderneysociety.org In the United States the film was re-titled Island Rescue. Plot In 1940, after the fall of France, the fictitious Channel Island of Armorel is occupied by a small garrison of German troops under the benign command of Hauptmann Weiss (George Coulouris). He finds that the hereditary ruler, the Suzerain, is away in the British army, leaving the Provost in charge. Back in London, the Ministry of Agriculture realise that during the evacuation of the island, Venus, a prize pedigree cow, has been left behind. They petition the War Office to do something urgently due to the value of the cow's bloodline, and Major Morland (David Niven), is assigned the task of rescuing Venus. When he realises that the Suzerain's sister, Nicola Fallaize (Glynis Johns) is in Wales, serving as an Auxiliary Territorial Service army cook, she is quickly posted to the War Office and the two, with a radio operator sergeant and a Channel Islander naval officer who knows the local waters, are landed on the island. They contact the Provost and discover that the Hauptmann, a cattle breeder in civilian life, is about to have the cow shipped to Germany. In a race against the Germans discovering their presence, they spirit the cow onto a beach and via a special craft, onto a Royal Navy Motor Torpedo Boat which takes them to Britain, though they are pursued by German E-boat.

The film follows the original novel closely with the exception of the fate of Lionel. The fictitious island of Armorel may be based on Sark, one of the locations where the film was shot. Sark, inhabited by 500 people, had a feudal ruler, the Seigneur until 2008, as depicted in the play The Dame of Sark.The Dame of Sark a play by William Douglas Home. Like all the other Channel Islands, it was occupied by German troops 1940‚Äì1945. British commandos made two unsuccessful raids in 1942‚Äì43. Production The film was based on a novel. Much of the film was shot on the island of Sark. The island did not allow motorised traffic. The filmmakers were allowed one Land Rover and trailer to transport their equipment.

Ferry was a Republican lawyer who had twice been Governor of Washington Territory, the only one to serve two terms. On Washington's admission as a state on November 11, 1889, he became its inaugural governor, serving one term, stepping down in 1893 because of failing health.  Education, early life  Elisha Peyre Ferry was born in 1825 in Monroe County in the Michigan Territory, south of Detroit. His parents were attorney Peter Ferry and Clarissa (Peyre) Ferry. They soon moved west to the small town of Waukegan, Illinois, where his father served as a judge. Elisha graduated early from high school. He studied at Fort Wayne Law School, Indiana, passing the bar examination at age twenty. Ferry had a successful practice as a lawyer in Waukegan for the next twenty-three years. After getting established, by 1850 he married Sarah Brown Kellog (1827‚Äì1912). They had five children together: * Eliza (1851‚Äì1935) * James (1853‚Äì1914) * Lincoln (1860‚Äì1911) * Julia (1864‚Äì1894) * Pierre (1868‚Äì1932) All their children were given the middle name Peyre, which was his mother‚Äôs maiden name, and is of French origin. French Canadian colonists were the first Europeans to settle in the Detroit area, on both sides of the Detroit River. The Ferry family lived according to strict religious rules, and belonged to the Episcopal Church. In the state's capital Olympia, Ferry and his family were prominent members of St. John's Episcopal Church, where they were active both in church leadership and organization. Ferry was noted for his high ethical standards, both in his professional life and in the community. Ferry also was a member of the Masonic Fraternity, which flourished in the nineteenth century in the United States. He served as Grand Master in 1878. He was a founding member of the Seattle Scottish Rite and held the rank of a Thirty-second degree Scottish Rite Mason., Seattle Scottish Rite  Political career  Ferry became the Presidential Elector of Illinois in 1852. He was elected as the first mayor of Waukegan in 1859, winning by a big majority. In 1862 he was a delegate at the Illinois State Constitutional Convention. During the American Civil War, Ferry joined the Union Army, helping to organize the Illinois regiment. He became friends with Ulysses S. Grant and Abraham Lincoln ‚Äì important connections for a rising politician. After the war, in 1869 President Grant appointed Ferry to the position of Surveyor General of the rapidly developing Washington Territory, and Ferry and his family moved to Olympia, Washington, the newly designated state capital. In 1872 Grant appointed him as Territorial Governor and, after the end of his four-year term, reappointed him to the same position. Both as Surveyor and Governor, Ferry was closely involved with the building of the Northern Pacific Railway, and took a personal hand in planning the extension from Tacoma to Olympia. As governor, Ferry was successful in putting the Wasnky State on a sound financial footing, by pressuring various counties to pay their taxes. His successor took office in a state that was almost debt-free. He also regulated the rail fares, and centralized the penal system to a state rather than a county basis.  First State Governor of Washington  After a break from politics, working in Seattle in law and banking, Ferry was nominated as Republican candidate for the State Governor, when Washington was granted statehood on November 11, 1889. He defeated the Democrat Eugene Semple, gaining 58 percent of the vote. In his first summer, Ferry had to oversee reconstruction of three major cities that had been largely destroyed by fire: Seattle, Ellensburg, and Spokane Falls. The prompt replacing of timber buildings with brick and stone gave reassurance to the increasing numbers of residents moving into the state, some of them interested in acquiring public land. Ferry tried to manage the debate between supporters of business, wanting to privatize land (mainly people in the West of the state), and those who favored full public ownership (mainly in the East). The commission he appointed failed to reach a conclusion in the allotted time. Some critics believed that the administration was in the pocket of the corporations. The same inference was drawn when Ferry called on the National Guard to put down a miners' strike. Following a costly fire, a local mining company had decided to cut expenses by replacing white mineworkers with blacks at lower wages. The longer the strike lasted, the more the employers saw the advantage of using black labor, and this became their standard policy. Once again, the Washington Republicans were looking like powerful allies of the corporations. But Ferry's health was starting to fail, and he was having to miss important votes. He was unable to maintain his commanding presence in the legislative chamber. He resigned as State Governor. Two years later he died of what was diagnosed as a cold, on board a steamer in Puget Sound. His illness was likely a more serious respiratory disease. His name is commemorated in Ferry County, named for him in 1899. He is also the namesake of Mount Ferry in the Olympic Mountains.

It is named after the first general manager of the B.C. Electric Co., Johannes Buntzen. There is a smaller lake just to the north named McCombe Lake. History Buntzen lake used to be named Trout Lake, and was also called Lake Beautiful, and was renamed to Buntzen Lake in 1905 at the opening of the tunnel to Coquitlam Lake. In 1903 the lake was used to power Vancouver's first hydroelectric plant the Buntzen Powerhouse. A tunnel was excavated through Eagle Mountain from Coquitlam Lake to Buntzen Lake. Coquitlam Lake was dammed, and water flowed 3.6 kilometres (2.2 mi) through the tunnel to Buntzen Lake, and from there, through an outlet at the north end of the lake to two power generating stations on Indian Arm. The first, Powerhouse No 1 built in 1903, and the second 300M away, Powerhouse No 2 built in 1914. At Buntzen Lake was used in another power generating plant, Burrard Generating Station, a gas-powered plant, where the lake water was used to produce steam for the generators. This generating station was shut down in 2016. The area around the lake is managed by BC Hydro as a recreation site and visitors can swim, fish, hike, and boat on the lake. Recreation 200px There are many trails on or around the Lake. The recreation area has been a very good example of multiple use, allowing Hikers, Mountain Bikers and Equestrians to use the trails together. Most of the trails extend from the recreation area into Indian Arm Provincial Park. Dogs on a leash are permitted on all trails at Buntzen Lake. There are also two designated off-leash areas, one of which includes an off-leash beach area, and an off-leash trail. Some trails include: The Halvor Lunden Trail (Eagle Ridge) The Halvor Lunden Trail is named for a local prolific trail builder and maintainer who blazed many of the trails around Buntzen Lake in the 1980s and 90s. The trail is composed of the Lindsay Lake Loop, Swan Falls Loop and Dilly Dally Loop (described below). Lindsay Lake Loop Hiking time: 6‚Äì8 hours return. Distance: 15 km (9 mi). Elevation gain: 1,020 m (3,350 ft). This is the most popular of the three Halvor Lunden trails. It passes thought ancient mountain forests and has a number of viewpoints from which overlook Vancouver. The trailhead is on Powerhouse Road, near the southeast corner of the South Beach parking area, and takes you up a steep climb of over 700m, passing the Polytrichum Lookout before reaching the \\"Lake district\\" which includes several small lakes and the larger Lindsay Lake. Swan Falls Loop Hiking time: 8‚Äì10 hours return. Distance: 20 km (12 mi). Elevation gain: 1,150 m (3,770 ft). The Swan Falls trailhead starts at the north end of Buntzen lake near North Beach. It is very steep in places and is only recommended for experienced and fit hikers. This trail forks into a number of trails between El Paso Junction and Lindsay Junction. The different trails give hikers the option of seeing the old growth forest of Eagle Ridge or pass by a number of tarns. North of Lindsay Junction is Eagle Peak with views of Mount Baker, Vancouver Island, the Fraser Valley, the Coquitlam watershed, Mount Seymour Provincial Park, and Indian Arm. Swan Falls was named for Gordon Swan by Dr. Simon Priest. Both were instrumental in trail building at Buntzen in the late 1970s on behalf of the Simon Fraser University Outdoor Club.http://simonpriest.com/ID.html#SFT Dilly Dally Loop Hiking time: 10‚Äì12 hours return. Distance: 25 km (16 mi). Elevation gain: 1,150 m (3,770 ft). This trail through high mountain forests is recommended for experienced and fit hikers only. The trailhead is located north of the Swan Falls trailhead, and takes the hiker further north to the Croker Lookout where there are fine views of the north end of Indian Arm, before climbing steeply to the top of Eagle Ridge. The trail continues south along the ridge over the 1200m Dill Dally peak before joining the Swan Falls trail. Buntzen Lake Trail Hiking time: 4‚Äì5 hours return. Distance: 8 km (5 mi). Elevation gain: 100 m (330 ft). This loop trail circles Buntzen Lake starting at Buntzen Creek Bridge at the east side of South Beach. Energy Trail This loop around the wooded knoll southwest of the South Beach boat launch includes views of Buntzen Lake and interpretive displays along the trail. Diez Vistas Trail Hiking time: 6‚Äì8 hours return. Distance: 7 km (4 mi) (one way). Elevation gain: 460 m (1,510 ft). The name of this trail, \\"ten views\\" in Spanish, refers to the many views of Vancouver area waterways and mountains visible from this trail. Bear Claw, Saddle Ridge, Horseshoe Trails These trails form loops in the cedar and hemlock forests on the steep slopes at the south west slopes of Buntzen Lake, providing access to the Diez Vistas Trail and the trail to Sasamat Lake. Lakeview Trail Hiking time: 5‚Äì6 hours return. Distance: 6 km (4 mi) (one way). Elevation gain: 150 m (490 ft). Portions of this trail are very steep. Equestrians and mountain bike riders should only use this trail if experienced in steep mountain terrain riding. Providing an alternative route along Buntzen Lake's western shore, this trail weaves its way along Pumphouse Road from the main entrance gate, then connects with the transmission line heading north before slipping into the dense forest that enfolds Buntzen Ridge. The trail ends where it joins the Old Buntzen Lake Trail near North Beach. This trail is opened to equestrians and mountain bike riders. Academy Trail Hiking time: 2‚Äì2.5 hours (one way). Distance: 4 km (2 mi). Elevation gain: 100 m (330 ft). This trail through fern-filled forests is open to equestrians and mountain bike riders. Old Buntzen Lake Trail Hiking time: 45 minutes (one way). Distance: 1.5 km (0.9 mi). Elevation gain: 20 m (70 ft). This trail was used to circumnavigate Buntzen Lake before the suspension bridge was built which the new Buntzen Lake Trail traverses. Eagle Bluff Trail Leads up from the Academy Trail to Vista Point, a viewpoint overlooking the lake. Confusingly named the same as Eagleridge Bluffs in West Vancouver. White Rock Trail Leads from El Paso Junction on the Halvor Lunden Trail to the old logging road network on Eagle Ridge. A viewpoint partway along the trail overlooks Coquitlam. Movie roles The use of Buntzen Lake in movies has been prolific. Appearances include * Lake Placid (1999) * The X-Files episodes 1x04 \\"Conduit\\" and 3x22 \\"Quagmire\\" * Highlander * Hot Rod * Freddy vs. Jason * Devour * The Blair Witch Project The local community has also been used.

Four months later, the wing was federalized in the second wave of Air National Guard callups for the Korean War, and assigned to Air Defense Command.Cornett & Johnson, p. 63 It moved to Truax Field near Madison, Wisconsin where both the 126th and 176th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flew air defense training missions until being inactivated in February 1952. The wing returned to Wisconsin state control and to its station near Milwaukee in November. Air defense The wing trained for its air defense mission until 1958. It was again activated in April 1961, remaining in the air defense mission, although its original group at the same station assumed the air refueling mission. In June 1971, the squadron again moved from General Mitchel Field to Truax Field, where the 115th Fighter-Interceptor Group was located. In September 1972, the wing's 176th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron won the \\"William Tell Competition\\" in the F-102 category. The event, held at Tyndall Air Force Base, included top Air National Guard, Canadian Air Force and active US Air Force units worldwide. The competition included 12 teams of 48 aircraft, each team scored on aerial marksmanship, weapons control, weapons loading and maintenance. =Forward air control= In November 1974, the wing's gaining command changed from Air Defense Command to Tactical Air Command and its designation changed to the 128th Tactical Air Support Wing. With the realignment to TAC, in December 1974, the unit's F-102s were replaced by the Cessna O-2A Skymaster Forward Air Control (FAC) aircraft. The O-2 was the military version of the Cessna 337 Skymaster, a high wing, twin-boom aircraft with a unique centerline pusher/tractor twin engine configuration. The O-2A version was used in forward air control missions, often in conjunction with a ground forward air controller and a radio operator, maintenance, and driver (ROMAD) team. In November 1979, the O-2s were replaced by the Cessna OA-37B Dragonfly forward air control aircraft. It was developed from the A-37 light attack plane which was used extensively in the Vietnam War as a counter-insurgency aircraft, with the surviving planes either being sold to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force or returned to the United States. The OA-37s were received from ANG units in Maryland and New York. With most of the pilots and maintenance crews having prior jet aircraft experience with the F-102s, the unit was able to transition the OA-37 to C-1 status, (full combat ready), in less than six months. Awards during the OA-37 era included an overall rating of \\"Excellent\\" in the unit's Operational Readiness Inspection, the Distinguished Flying Award and its first Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. =Close air support = On 1 October 1981, the group was redesignated the 128th Tactical Fighter Wing. Along with the mission change came a new aircraft, the Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II, nicknamed the \\"Warthog\\". The OA-37s were sent to other ANG units; survivability made the A-10 an excellent weapons delivery system for ground targets. The A-10's most dominant feature is its seven-barrel GAU-8/A 30 mm cannon, capable of firing at up to 70 \\"tank busting\\" rounds per second. During the A-10 era, the unit received two Outstanding Unit Awards, three Air Force Flight Safety Awards, and in 1991 an \\"Outstanding\\" in its Unit Effectiveness Inspection. Deployments with the A-10 included Operation Coronet Cove to Panama, and \\"Checkered Flag\\" missions to NATO bases in West Germany and England. =Current mission = USAF F-16C block 30 #87-0278 from the 176th FS sits on the runway in Madison on 28 June 2008 during the Rhythm and Booms Fireworks display. Note the 60th Anniversary paint scheme on the tail With the end of the Cold War, the early 1990s marked several changes. On 16 March 1992, the wing became the '128th Fighter Wing and shortly thereafter changed its mobilization command change from Tactical Air Command to the newly created Air Combat Command. In 1993, the wing began transitioning from the A-10A to the F-16C/D block 30 Fighting Falcon airframes with the enlarged inlet, the A-10s were transferred to other ANG units. The first F-16s arrived at Truax ANGB on 1 April 1993. The current role of the 176th FS is air- interdiction and close air support (CAS). This was the same task as when they flew the A-10, although the transition to the F-16 meant a huge change in the overall execution of this mission when comparing the A-10 with the F-16. On 11 October 1995, the 128th Fighter Wing was renamed the 115th Fighter Wing and converted to the Objective Wing organization with its operational squadron assigned to the 115th Operations Group. The 128th designation duplicated that of the 128th Air Refueling Wing at General Mitchell Air National Guard Base, another Wisconsin Air National Guard unit, which upgraded from group status. Operations participated in by the 115th Fighter Wing include: Operation Coronet Chariot, Karup AS, Denmark 1994, Operation Northern Watch, Incirlik AB, Turkey 1997, Operation Southern Watch, Al Jaber AB, Kuwait 1997‚Äì98, Operation Southern Watch, Prince Sultan AB, Saudi Arabia 1999, Operation Coronet Nighthawk, Curacao, Netherlands Antilles 2001, Operation Enduring Freedom, Al Udeid AB, Qatar 2004‚Äì05, Balad AB, Iraq, 2006, 08, & 09, Africa, 2013 and Operation Noble Eagle, from 11 September 2001 to the present. In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, the DoD recommended to close Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. As a result, three of the 27th Fighter Wing's F-16s were to be distributed to the 115th Fighter Wing amongst other aircraft moves. The 176th Fighter Squadron celebrated its 60th anniversary in October 2008. Today the wing is capable of air-to-air, close air support and precision guided bombing missions. The wing operates the latest generation of munitions such as the JDAM series bombs and the AIM-9X air-to-air missile. In December 2017, the Air Force announced that the 115th was one of two Air National Guard wings selected for equipping with the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II. The conversion to the fifth-generation jet fighter is scheduled for 2023.

The alumni association now operates under the name Mississippi's First Alumnae Association  History  The university's alumnae association was officially created in 1889 with the graduation of the first class from the university. The responsibility of the original organization was to (1) Promote School Loyalty (2) Maintain Class Ties (3) Support the scholarship loan program, and (4) To coordinate alumnae scholarship gifts. The first full-time alumnae office was established in 1925 for the Alumnae Secretary. This office was also responsible for coordinating the Alumnae Bulletin, homecoming activities, local chapter organizations, and fund raising and recruiting efforts.  Conflict  The relationship between Mississippi University for Women and its alumni became complicated when the former university president, Claudia Limbert, announced her decision to disaffiliate from the 117-year-old MUW Alumnae Association. Though the formal disaffiliation began on February 1, 2007 and went into effect on April 2, 2007, the chain of events that lead to this break-up started several years ago. Upon her installation as president, Limbert placed the administration of the MUW Alumnae Association under the Vice President of Institutional Advancement.Board of Trustees Prior to this change, the Director of Alumni Affairs answered directly to the President.Unofficial Community Site of a Mississippi University for Women Graduate In 2002, Limbert publicly considered changing the name of Mississippi University for Women so that it did not include the word \\"Women\\" in the title after a marketing survey suggested that the school's name made it unclear who could and could not attend. One month after that announcement, Limbert announced her decision to cancel the MUW Athletic program after a tornado destroyed the athletics building. The existing MUW Alumnae Association publicly expressed their displeasure related to these decisions. In 2006, Limbert publicly demoted the Director of Alumni Affairs and fired the Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs for sharing confidential donor information with members of the Alumnae Association. This action came after Limbert seized computers and records in the Alumni Affairs office. Evidence uncovered in the University's investigation of the alumni office led not only to personnel decisions but also demonstrated the need to define more precisely the relationship between the University and the alumnae association. Also in 2006, the Board of Directors for the State of Mississippi Institute of Higher Learning announced a new requirement that all organizations such as alumni associations, athletic support organizations, foundations, etc. have a formal affiliation agreement with their university. The existing alumnae board tried to negotiate a compromise to establish new bylaws under their affiliation agreement with the university, however the university, after extending the appointed deadline once, ended negotiations and the president appointed her own Alumni Advisory Committee. As a result, on March 29, 2007 members of the National Executive Board of the MUWAA filed suit in the Lowndes County Chancery Court seeking to stop the disaffiliation. The National Executive Board of the MUWAA is represented pro bono by Julie Hussey, an attorney with the San Diego, Calif., law firm DLA Piper DLA Piper and an MUW alumna. On November 20, 2008, the Mississippi State Supreme Court determined that Mississippi University for Women President Claudia Limbert had the legal right to terminate the university's relationship with its former alumnae association, overturning Lowndes County Chancellor Dorothy Colom's decision from September 28, 2007. The state court ruled the judge unconstitutionally interfered with the Mississippi Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning's authority to govern universities and reaffirmed the right of the IHL board and state university presidents to determine how affiliated alumni associations operate.http://www.mssc.state.ms.us/Images/Opinions/CO52541.pdf The MUW Alumnae Association, while disaffiliated, continues to operate in support of the university under the name Mississippi's First Alumnae Association. Another entity, the MUW Alumni Association was created by Limbert and affiliated with the university. Sporadic efforts to reunite alumni under one association have not been successful.

Crockett is known as a gardener TV host of The Victory Garden.  Early life  October 9, 1915, Crockett was born in Haverhill, Massachusetts. Crockett's father was Earle Royce Crockett. Crockett's mother was Inez Underwood Crockett.(Abstract only. Login required for full bio.)  Education  Crockett studied horticulture at University of Massachusetts. In Texas, Crockett studied horticulture at Texas Agriculture and Mechanical College. In 1935, Crockett graduated from Stockbridge School of Agriculture in Amherst, Massachusetts.  Career  In the 1940s during WWII, Crockett served in the U.S. military in the Pacific Theater. In April 1975, Crockett became the original host of PBS's The Victory Garden, then called Crockett's Victory Garden. Crockett had been chosen by producer Russell Morash because he had previously written several gardening books. The show debuted on April 16, 1975, and was focused on gardening at home. The garden was located outside WGBH's studios in Allston, Massachusetts.  Works  Crockett's gardening works included many volumes of the Time-Life Encyclopedia of Gardening, including Wildflower Gardening, Perennials, and Flowering Shrubs. He later wrote three books of gardening advice based on the popular and much-loved PBS television series; the first, also called Crockett's Victory Garden, is a general‚Äìpurpose guide to gardening, treating vegetables, and caring for outside flowers and houseplants. Its approach was unique among garden books, in that it was organized not by the plants in the garden but by the calendar‚Äîby the jobs required of you by your garden each month of the year. The second, Crockett's Indoor Garden, is a guide to taking care of houseplants. The third book, Crockett's Flower Garden, is devoted entirely to outdoor flowers. All three books are organized according to an annual calendar, detailing the tasks to be performed throughout the year.  Filmography  * 1975 The Victory Garden - as himself.  Personal life  In 1943, Crockett married Margaret Williams. In 1940s, they moved to San Francisco, California. After Crockett's active military service, he and his family moved to Concord, Massachusetts. Crockett and his wife had four children, Carol, Robert, Jean and Mary. On July 11, 1979, Crockett died from cancer in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He was 63. Crockett is buried at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Concord, Massachusetts.

Because Randeng Daoren had already spat on Li Jing's back - which gave him magical powers - Li Jing was a match for Nezha at last. Nezha, who easily saw the trickery, stabbed his spear at Randeng Daoren; Randeng Daoren easily negated his spear by forming a large white lotus from his own mouth.

The 106th Air Refueling Squadron, assigned to the Wings 117th Operations Group, is a descendant organization of the World War I 106th Aero Squadron, established on 27 August 1917. It was reactivated in 1922, and as the 106th Observation Squadron was one of 29 National Guard observation squadrons formed before World War II.

Its mission is to train and equip combat ready aircrews and support personnel to perform worldwide air refueling and airlift missions. Combat ready civil engineering, support services, medical, personnel, communications and Intelligence technical support packages of the wing are available for worldwide assignment. the wing supports state and local contingencies when directed by the Governor of Alabama.

In the fall of 1950, the group was called to active federal service. The group moved to Lawson Air Force Base, Georgia and began to train as a tactical reconnaissance unit. However, the group and its support organizations were not organized under the Wing Base organization of the regular Air Force, which combined tactical and support organizations under a single headquarters.

Notice the temporary Pierced Steel Planking used for the parking apron with the snow and ice. This aircraft was sold to France in September 1956. It was eventually withdrawn from use in May 1967 and scrapped. At Lawson, the 112th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron retained its existing Douglas RB-26C Invaders, becoming the wing's night reconnaissance unit. Tactical Air Command equipped the 157th and 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadrons with Lockheed RF-80A Shooting Star daylight photo-reconnaissance jet aircraft. The wing then began what was then believed to be a short transition training period. The original plan was to deploy the 117th to France and reinforce United States Air Forces in Europe at a new base in France, Toul-Rosi√®res Air Base. However Toul Air Base was still under construction, and delays in France for several reasons forced the 117th to remain at Lawson for over a year until finally receiving deployment orders in January 1952. The 117th arrived at Toul Air Base on 27 January 1952. However at the time of the Wing's arrival, Toul consisted of a sea of mud, and the new jet runway was breaking up and could not support safe flying. The commander of the 117th deemed it uninhabitable and its flying squadrons of the wing were ordered dispersed to West Germany. The 112th Squadron was transferred to Wiesbaden Air Base, the 157th to F√ºrstenfeldbruck Air Base, and the 160th to Neubiberg Air Base, all in West Germany. The non-flying headquarters and support organizations remained at Toul. The mission of the 117th was to provide tactical, visual, photographic and electronic reconnaissance by both day and night, as was required by the military forces within the European command. The RF-80's were responsible for the daylight operations; the RB-26s for night photography. In June 1952, the 117th was involved in Exercise June Primer. This exercise took place in an area bordered by a line drawn from Cherbourg to Geneva in the east and in the west by Swiss, Austrian and Russian Occupation Zone of Germany borders. The two RF-80 squadrons of the 117th had to complete a number of varying missions, including vertical photography of prospective paratroop air drop zones, oblique photos of the Rhine and Danube river bridges, vertical photography of the airfields of Jever, Fa√überg, Celle, Sundorf and G√ºtersloh and various visual missions on behalf of the Seventh Army, including artillery adjustment for the 816th Field Artillery Battalion. The 157th Squadron had had wire recorders fitted to five of its RF-80's prior to June Primer and these greatly facilitated the latter missions. By July 1952 facilities at Wiesbaden were becoming very crowded, and it was felt that the B-26's could fly from the primitive conditions at Toul. The 112th returned to Toul, however the jet- engined RF-80's remained in West Germany until a new runway was constructed. On 10 July 1952 the 117th Wing was inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment was taken over by the newly activated 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. The wing was the allotted to the Air National Guard. Air National Guard service The 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing was re-formed at Birmingham. It continued to fly a mix of jet and propeller aircraft until 1957, when new Republic RF-84F Thunderflash jet reconnaissance aircraft, manufactured by Republic for Air National Guard service. The squadron continued to train in tactical reconnaissance missions throughout the 1950s with the Thunderstreaks. 1961 Berlin Crisis The wing was federalized on 1 October 1961 as a result of the 1961 Berlin Crisis. The wing included of the 160th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron from Dannelly field, the 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Birmingham; the 153d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Mississippi Air National Guard), and the 184th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Arizona Air National Guard. Due to federal budget restrictions, only the 106th deployed to Dreux-Louvilliers Air Base, France. However elements of the three other squadrons rotated to France as operational components of the 7117th Tactical Wing over the next year and 106th pilots returned to the United States. On 27 October twenty RF-84F's were deployed to Dreux, arriving on 3 November. In addition, two Lockheed T-33A T Bird jet trainers and one Douglas C-47 Skytrain were deployed as support aircraft. By 22 November, elements of the wing reassembled at the newly reactivated Dreux for an estimated stay of ten months. However, problems developed immediately after their arrival at Dreux. The base had been in standby status for about a year and no longer was used for operational flights. In any event, the more than one thousand airmen of the wing arrived at a base that had been stripped clean. The French had taken away office desks, telephones and typewriters. The kitchens had not been used for some time, a fact that the quartermasters had not taken into account, so getting the base operational again in the short time available took an all-out effort. A few days after the ground units arrived from Alabama, the first aircraft were prepared for a practice flight. The French Air Traffic Controllers, however, refused permission for take-off. Only after a lot of negotiation were several aircraft allowed to take to the air. Dreux Air Base came within the Paris Air Traffic Control Area, as did the busy Le Bourget and Orly Airports, and an extra squadron of jet aircraft had not been accounted for in the French air traffic controllers' staffing levels. The safety of civilian air traffic was used to justify denying the Americans permission to fly out of Dreux. Notwithstanding stormy protests by the United States, the RF-84s stayed on the ground. The pilots who had only just completed a risky Atlantic crossing of several thousand kilometers, had to wait in the operations room. In the United States, the Birmingham News daily newspaper reported that 'their boys', after the sudden mobilization and the weeks of preparation, had not been sent to Europe to sit around a French airfield doing nothing. However, as strongly the Pentagon protested, the French answer remained \\"non!\\". Eventually General Reid Doster, commander of the Alabama deployment could do little else but take his aircraft elsewhere. At the end of November 1961 he received permission from the French traffic controllers to go with his aircraft to Chaumont-Semoutiers Air Base, another USAFE in France. Permission was received from the French to move on 8 December 1961, however HQ USAFE insisted that the 7117th Wing headquarters remain at Dreux for airlift traffic. Thus the 106th operated from Chaumont AB, its headquarters remained at Dreux. On 22 July 1962 the 106th returned to Alabama leaving its F-84Fs in France. Dreux was placed back in standby status. Vietnam and late Cold War era Republic RF-84F-30-RE Thunderflash of the 106th TRS, Alabama Air National Guard, 52-7425 After the squadron re-formed in Birmingham, it re-equipped with RF-84Fs from active-duty squadrons that were receiving the McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo. It continued to fly the Thunderflash reconnaissance aircraft throughout the 1960s. As the RF-84F was not used during the Vietnam War, the 117th Wing was not activated for duty in Southeast Asia, although some pilots from the unit went through transition training to the RF-101C and McDonnell RF-4C Phantom II and were activated for combat duty. 106th TRS RF-4C 66-7761 about 1972, shortly after its transfer from the 432d Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Udorn RTAFB, Thailand. In November 1971 the Thunderflashes were retired as they reached the end of their service life and the 117th Group was chosen to be the first Air National Guard unit to receive the RF-4C Phantom II tactical reconnaissance aircraft. The squadron received aircraft being withdrawn from Southeast Asia as part of the United States pullout from the Vietnam War. On 9 December 1974 the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Group inactivated, and support organizations were assigned to the new 117th Combat Support Group. The 106th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron was assigned directly to the 117th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing. 106th TRS RF-4C Phantom II aircraft at Ramstein AB, West Germany, March 1976.

Many awards were earned by the 117th; for having the best National Guard publication; for achieving flying milestones; for service to the United States Secret Service; and for outstanding accomplishments on Operational Readiness Inspections. The 117th also earned awards for having the best Air National Guard flying unit in the United States. Operation Desert Shield 106th TRS RF-4C Phantom II 64-1047, shown at Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates during Operation Desert Shield. Note the numerous \\"camels\\", painted on its intake, representing the number of missions flown. 1047 Flew 172 sorties in Desert Shield. After its retirement in May 1994, the aircraft was flown to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio where today it is on permanent display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force. It had more than 7,300 hours of flying time. By early 1989, the operational lifetime of the F-4 Phantom was ending, and the number of RF-4C squadrons serving both on active-duty as well as in Air National Guard units was being reduced. In large part, the RF-4C was being replaced by the ability of the Lockheed U-2 TR-1A and TR-1B, which had taken over the tactical reconnaissance mission. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact led to accelerated retirement plans, and the retirement of the last of the RF-4Cs was in the planning stages when Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, and further inactivation plans were put on hold. Consequently, the RF-4C was still in service with the USAF at the time of Operation Desert Shield. When the United States military build-up in the Middle East began following Saddam Hussein‚Äôs 2 August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, six wing RF-4Cs equipped with a camera upgrade called the HIAC-1 LOROP (Long Range Oblique Photography) deployed on 24 August 1990 to Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates. Their journey to the war zone may have been the longest nonstop flight made by operational warplanes at that time, requiring 16 air- to-air refuelings and spanning 8,000 nautical miles in 15.5 hours. Initially assigned to HQ United States Central Command Air Forces, the wing's 106th Squadron was later attached to the 35th Tactical Fighter Wing (Provisional). LOROP was capable of high-resolution images of objects 100 miles away using a high-resolution 66-inch focal length camera that was carried in a centerline pod underneath the aircraft. It was used to conduct prewar surveillance and photo-reconnaissance mapping of Iraqi forces in occupied Kuwait as well as those deployed along the Saudi Arabia-Iraq border. In support of RF-4C operations, numerous airmen and aircraft were used, among them C-21 Learjets, to move finished imagery around the theater. In the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia known as the \\"Black Hole,\\" coalition air commander Lt. Gen. (later Gen.) Charles \\"Chuck\\" Horner scrutinized the RF-4C images of Iraq‚Äôs forces every day. The wing lost aircraft 64-1044 crewed by Major Barry K. Henderson and Lt. Col. Stephen G. Schraam was lost in an operational accident on 8 October 1990. The 106th, however, did not engage in combat operations during Operation Desert Storm, being relieved on 18 December 1990 by the 192d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron of the Nevada Air National Guard. Air refueling 106th Air Refueling Squadron KC-135 Stratotanker After the end of Desert Storm, the phaseout of the RF-4C was accelerated. On 16 March 1992, the wing was redesignated the 117th Reconnaissance Wing. Onn 1 June 1992, Tactical Air Command, which had been the gaining command for the wing since 1952, was inactivated. Air Combat Command was activated and became the wing's active duty gaining command. During 1994, the RF-4Cs were sent to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona for retirement at the Aerospace Maintenance and Regeneration Center. On 1 October, the wing was redesignated the 117th Air Refueling Wing, its mission now becoming air refueling with Boeing KC-135 Stratotankers, the first tanker arriving later that month. After the 9/11 attacks on the United States, the 117th deployed to MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and began refueling F-15 and F-16 aircraft flying combat air patrol missions over major cities in the Southeastern United States as part of Operation Noble Eagle. In its 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommendations, the Department of Defense recommended closing the wing and reassigning its aircraft to other National Guard units. This decision was ultimately reversed.

Originating near Padma in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand it flows for across the northern part of the Chota Nagpur Plateau, mostly in a west to east direction, before joining the Damodar near Dishergarh in Asansol, Bardhaman district of West Bengal. It has a catchment area of . The main tributaries, Barsoti and Usri, flow in from the south and north respectively. Apart from the two main tributaries some fifteen medium or small streams join it.Chattopadhyay, Akkori, Bardhaman Jelar Itihas O Lok Sanskriti (History and Folk lore of Bardhaman District.), , Vol I, p 26, Radical Impression. The Barakar skirts the northern portion of Parasnath Hills, above sea level, the highest hill in the region, located in Giridih district of Jharkhand and a centre of Jain pilgrimage. Floods Barakar River at Barakar, Asansol, Bardhaman district The river flows in all fury during the rains in its upper reaches and has washed away two bridges constructed successively on the Grand Trunk Road. The great stone bridge across the river near Barhi, in Hazaribagh district, built around 1848, was washed away in 1913, after a fall of of rain in 24 hours. The narrow iron bridge, which was built to replace it, withstood the strains of troop movement during the Second World War, but gave way in 1946, with another great flood.Houlton, Sir John, Bihar the Heart of India, 1949, p117, Orient Longmans Ltd. A new bridge built in the 1950s has withstood the fury of the river. There is another bridge on the Grand Trunk Road, across the Barakar, connecting Barakar a neighbourhood in Asansol having the same name, in Bardhaman district of West Bengal with Chirkunda in Jharkhand. With heavy traffic in the heart of the coal belt, the bridge built in the mid-19th century is in need of repairs. A new bridge has been built, to the north, on the bypass running from Kalipahari in Asansol to Nirsa in Dhanbad district. The huge volume of monsoon water was carried down the valley and formerly created havoc with floods in the lower Damodar basin. Annual rainfall over the basin varies between with an average of of which 80 percent occurs during the monsoon season from June to September. In order to harness the river (along with the Damodar), the Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) planned and implemented independent India's first multipurpose river valley project. The first dam of the project was constructed across the Barakar at Tilayia. Dams and power stations=Tilaiyia DVC's first dam, Tilaiya Dam, was across the Barakar at Tilaiya, in Hazaribagh district of Jharkhand, now in Koderma district of Jharkhand. It was inaugurated on 21 February 1953. The dam is long and is high from the river bed level. Tilaiya hydel power station is located on the left bank of the river Barakar. The structure is entirely of reinforced concrete. It has two generating units of 2 MW each with a provision for a third future unit of the same capacity. Maithon Maithon dam inside DVC's second dam was across the Konar, a tributary of the Damodar, in Hazaribagh district, and the third was across the Barakar at Maithon in Dhanbad district of Bihar, now Jharkhand. The river forms the boundary between West Bengal and Jharkhand in that area. The dam was inaugurated on 27 September 1957. The dam (both concrete and earthen) is long and the concrete dam is high above the river bed level. The unique feature of Maithon is that the hydel power station is located underground in the left bank of the river (on the West Bengal side) and is the first of its kind in India. The Power Station has a total generating capacity of 60 MW with three units of 20 MW each. About downstream from Maithon, the Barakar joins the Damodar at Dishergarh. Maithon Dam is from Dhanbad and around from Asansol. Other neighbourhood and suburbs in Asansol namely Rupnarainpur, Chittaranjan and Kulti-Barakar-Neamatpur-Dishergarh lie still nearer. It receives a steady and daily stream of tourists. In order to augment the meagre hydroelectric power generation DVC has gone in for both gas turbine and thermal power generation. While most of its facilities for such generation lie in the Damodar region, Maithon in the Barakar regions is a major focal point. Maithon Gas Turbine Station was commissioned at Maithon in 1989. The station has an installed capacity of 82.5 MW with three units each of 27.5 MW capacity. The 2 X 500 MW Maithon Right Bank thermal power station is under implementation. It is a joint venture of Tata Power and DVC. A 2 X 500 MW greenfield thermal power station has been proposed for Koderma. Proposed dam at Balpahari DVC is working on the proposal for a third dam across the Barakar at Balpahari in Jharkhand. Planned as part of its network of dams and barrages in the valley region, the Balpahari project was conceived with the objective of reducing siltation problems at Maithon, increasing the reach of canal irrigation and adding to hydro-electric generation capacity by 20 MW from the existing 144 MW. Soil conservation After the construction of the four dams at Tilayia, Konar, Maithon and Panchet by DVC, it was observed that the rate of silt inflow into the reservoirs were much higher than what was anticipated earlier. It threatened the longevity of the reservoirs. The catchment area of these reservoirs spread over the undulating terrain of the Chota Nagpur plateau is seriously affected by soil erosion. Large volumes of silt in the form of coarse and fine sediment is removed from the area by erosion under the impact of the water flow caused by torrential rain, which runs down the numerous stream channels during the monsoon. Thus the problem of reservoir siltation assumed great importance in the case of DVC. In order to prolong the life of the reservoirs, there was need for soil conservation and silt control. DVC set up a Soil Conservation Department at Hazaribagh to tackle the twin problems of reservoir siltation and soil deterioration in 1949. Fisheries The reservoirs at Tilaiya and Maithon, provided scope for development of fisheries. Efforts were made to introduce carp once the water accumulated behind the dams but the results have not been commensurate with the efforts, largely due to the formidable presence of predatory catfish Wallago attu and other predators such as Notopterus chitala and Barilius bola at Tilaiya, and catfishes Wallago attu and Aorichthys aor, at Maithon. These predators take a heavy toll of the stocked carps. Trash and uneconomic fishes form dense populations at Tilaiya reservoir, competing with major carps for food. The composition of catch at both the places is: catla, mrigal, rohita and calbasu.

This species is native to Australia. It is an endangered species. Description The shell of this species measures up to 5.5 cm across and is reddish brown to black with two distinct yellow bands. The visible soft parts of the animal are black. Ecology While it prefers and enjoys palm and fig trees, the Mitchell‚Äôs rainforest snail is usually traveling along the forest floor among fallen leaves or under the bark on many trees. This nocturnal animal feeds upon leaf litter, fungi and lichen, making these substances its primary diet. Despite the fact the Mitchell‚Äôs rainforest snail is nocturnal, it can be spotted year-round and has no specific season in which it may disappear or hibernate Distribution and Threats The snail used to be commonly found in rainforests and swampy parts of northern coastal lowlands and prefers palms and fig trees within rainforests. It also used to be found throughout coastal floodplain wetlands, coastal swamp forests, eastern riverine forests, littoral rainforests, northern warm temperate rainforests, and subtropical rainforests. The species is also found on the rainforests surrounding the Amazon river. Unfortunately, the Thersites mitchellae, or the Mitchell's rainforest snail is on the endangered species list due to numerous threats. These threats include, but are not limited to animals that have been introduced to the snail‚Äôs small habitat such as rats and birds. Other major threats consist of the use of herbicides and pesticides, fires, weed invasion, and is also largely tied to deforestation. This critically endangered snail is now largely restricted to a range of less than 5 km¬≤ of remnant lowland rainforest, scattered around the Tweed, Byron and Ballina Shires of northern New South Wales. A significant population can still be found on the Stotts Island Nature Reserve on the Tweed River. Scientists believe that less than 500 mature individuals remain in the wild.

The WS-10 may have been based on the core of the CFM-56II (itself based on the General Electric F101); China purchased two CFM-56IIs in the 1980s before the arms embargo. After being unable to purchase source code from Salyut, China spent nearly 20 years developing its own source code for the WS-10 engine. The WS-10A, targeted for of thrust, was already in development in 2002. An early version flew on an J-8II in 2002. In 2004, Russian sources familiar with project reported problems meeting the thrust target; in 2005, they reported problems reducing the weight of the primary and secondary compressors, in addition to problems meeting thrust requirements. Engine testing on the J-11 had already started by 2004, and testing using one engine on the J-11 may have occurred as early as 2002. A full-scale WS-10A engine was first seen at the 2008 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. In 2009, Western media claim that the WS-10A approached the performance of the AL-31, but took much longer than the AL-31 to develop thrust. Furthermore, the engine reportedly only generated of thrust. In April 2009, , head of AVIC, reported that the engine's quality was unsatisfactory. In 2010, it was reported that reliability was also poor; the WS-10A lasted only 30 hours, while the AL-31 needed refurbishing after 400 hours. The quality problems encountered with the WS-10A reflected the state of the Chinese aerospace industry. AVIC initiated a general effort to improve quality control throughout its production chain in 2011. The WS-10A reportedly matured enough after 2009 to power the J-11B Block 02 aircraft. Production or performance issues may have prevented the WS-10A from powering the J-10B. In 2018, Chinese state media reported an increase in engine lifespan from 800 to 1,500 hours due to the increased heat resistance of new third-generation single-crystal turbine blades. In March 2020, Chinese state media released a video showing a WS-10B-powered J-10C; aircraft markings suggest it was part of the fourth batch of J-10Cs for the PLAAF. WS-20 (WS-188) The Shenyang WS-20 (WS-188) is a high-bypass engine reportedly producing 13.8 tons of thrust. It is believed to be based on the core of the WS-10A. The Shenyang WS-20 was first seen in January 2014 while being tested on an Il-76, and is believed to be intended for the Y-20 strategic airlifter. Thrust vectoring A testbed J-10B powered by a WS-10 with thrust vectoring (TVC) - called \\"WS-10B-3\\" by Jamie Hunter - was demonstrated at the 2018 China International Aviation & Aerospace Exhibition. The TVC nozzle uses actuator-assisted moving petals, similar in concept to General Electric's axisymmetric vectoring exhaust nozzle (AVEN) and Pratt & Whitney's pitch-yaw balance beam nozzle (PYBBN).

Early life Wilmot was a son of Henry William Wilmot, an ironmonger and pioneer of the socialist movement in Victoria, and his wife, Elizabeth Mary Hind. He was born at Collingwood, a suburb of Melbourne, and was educated at the North Fitzroy State School. In 1895 he obtained employment at Cole's Book Arcade, Melbourne. He married Ida Meeking in 1910, and they had two sons. Wilmot gradually improved his position at the book arcade and, when the business was wound up by the executors of the Cole estate in 1929, held the position of manager. Career Wilmot began contributing verse to The Tocsin, a Melbourne Labour paper, before he was 20 and also produced his own monthly magazine called Microbe. His first separate publication, Some Verses by Frank Wilmot, appeared in 1903, and attracted little notice. Another little volume, Some More Verses, was printed in 1904 but was suppressed before publication. Some years later a few copies of this volume were discovered which found their way into collectors' hands. Finding at one stage that his work was being persistently rejected, especially by Bulletin where the editor Alfred George Stephens was known to dislike Wilmot, Wilmot adopted the pseudonym of \\"Furnley Maurice\\", and his poems thereafter were published either anonymously or under this pseudonym. In 1913 a slim, well-printed volume, Unconditioned Songs, published anonymously, attracted some attention. His next publication, To God: from the Weary Nations, which came out in 1917, criticised conscription. Revised and with a slightly altered title \\"To God: from the Warring Nations\\" the poem was later reprinted in Eyes of Vigilance, but in the meantime an entirely different piece of work, The Bay and Padie Book: Kiddie Songs, had come out (first ed. 1917, third ed. 1926). This volume was meant especially for young children, and few writers in this medium have been so successful. In Eyes of Vigilance, which appeared in 1920, Wilmot printed some of his best work, and in Arrows of Longing, published in 1921, he gathered together most of his uncollected work up to that date. In 1925 The Gully, a poem of about 200 lines, was published in a limited edition. In 1929 Wilmot had to find fresh means of making a living. He had of course made very little from his poetry. On leaving Cole's Book Arcade he bought its circulating library and carried it on for about three years, also doing some bookselling. It did not pay well and early in 1932 he applied for the position of manager of the Melbourne University Press and was appointed. He carried on the press with great success until the time of his death. It was not only that he expanded its activities very much, he made it pay. And though much of the work published was naturally educational, the press during his period published other important books and incidentally set a high standard in technical production. Though working very hard during the period after leaving Cole's, Wilmot still found time to do original work. The Gully and Other Verses, published in 1929, was the most even in quality of his volumes, and Melbourne Odes which appeared in 1934 contained the centenary ode for which he was awarded a prize of ¬£50 in 1934. Late life Wilmot had a serious operation in 1934 for appendicitis, which apparently was not completely successful, as another operation was necessary about a year later. On his recovery he continued working hard, always hoping that he might have a few years of leisure in which to do original work. In 1940 he was chosen to deliver the first course of lectures on Australian literature at the University of Melbourne. He died suddenly at Melbourne on 22 February 1942, aged 60. In addition to the works mentioned Wilmot published in 1922, Romance, a collection of essays in prose, which though somewhat slight are excellently written. He wrote the verses and some of the prose in Here is Faery, published in 1915, and a few single poems were issued separately. These will be found listed in Miller's Australian Literature. Among them was an essay in satire, Odes for a Curse-Speaking Choir I. Ottawar! An Ode to Humbug. He also wrote short stories and some plays, two or three of which were staged by amateurs. He collaborated with Percival Serle and R. H. Croll in the production of An Australasian Anthology, and with Professor Cowling in Australian Essays. In 1940 appeared Path to Parnassus Anthology for Schools, a charming selection of English and Australian poems with an illuminating introduction. A selection from his poetry was published in 1944.

WRQI simulcasts with WRQW 107.7 FM (licensed to Cooperstown), serving Titusville, Oil City, Franklin, and Tionesta. Until May 2007, this station was known as WHUZ. History=Beginnings as WYSS WRQI, the first of these two stations, first went on the air January 19, 1979 as WYSS. Though licensed to Saegertown, the station operated from Meadville (where it remains today), the seat of government from Crawford County, Pennsylvania, for most of its existence. The station signed on with a Top 40 format under the ownership of Saegertown Broadcasting Inc., a company headed by Arthur Arkelian, and maintained studios on Broad Street in Saegertown. The call letters were changed from WYSS to WEOZ in 1983. With the call letters came a change in ownership as the station was sold to Osborne Broadcasting, a company headed by Thomas Osborne, that year. The station also moved shortly afterwards from Saegertown to Meadville. WEOZ was then sold to Community First Broadcasting, a company headed by Werner Poegel, in August 1988 for $436,943.00. The format was then changed to a blend of adult contemporary and oldies programmed mostly from compact disc which was novel at the time. Community First Broadcasting maintained ownership of WEOZ until financial circumstances forced the station to go dark in August 1991. The station was dark for several years. The station returned under a new set of call letters, a new owner, and a new format. Rechristened as WMDE, the station programmed a modern rock format under its previous owner, the now defunct Great Circle Broadcasting. Ultimately the station was sold to Forever Broadcasting with the format being tweaked to \\"classic hits\\" as WUZZ 94. 107.7 signs on Forever Broadcasting was issued a construction permit for a new \\"drop-in\\" frequency of 107.7 in Cooperstown. The permit was granted on September 11, 1997. The station signed on as WMHU September 7, 2000 as a simulcast outlet of WMDE. In March of the following year, the call letters were changed to WHUG, and the station became a simulcast outlet of WXXO and WOXX in Cambridge Springs and Franklin, duplicating the \\"Kiss\\" monikered adult contemporary programming offered on those two channels. WUZZ 94 & 107 The station once boasted a large live and local staff of on air personalities, over the years it became largely automated. Live shows included the WUZZ Rockin' Morning Show, hosted by program director Rockin' Rich from 6am-10am, and a live afternoon show hosted by Reno. Weekends were typically automated, with the WUZZ music playing without any air personalities. Syndicated shows hosted by Dee Snider and Sammy Hagar aired on Saturday evenings, during a timeslot that once housed \\"Big Hair Saturday Night\\" - another elimination of local programming and live personalities on the station. Dave English, who is Tadpole on sister station Froggy, voicetracked the weekday midday show, which was previously hosted live.

It is estimated that each year 77 billion land animals are slaughtered for food. In general, the animals would be killed for food; however, they might also be slaughtered for other reasons such as being diseased and unsuitable for consumption. The slaughter involves some initial cutting, opening the major body cavities to remove the entrails and offal but usually leaving the carcass in one piece. Such dressing can be done by hunters in the field (field dressing of game) or in a slaughterhouse. Later, the carcass is usually butchered into smaller cuts. The animals most commonly slaughtered for food are cattle and water buffalo for beef and veal, sheep for lamb and mutton, goats for goat meat, pigs for pork, deer for venison, horses for horse meat, poultry (mainly chickens, turkeys and ducks), insects (a commercial species is the house cricket), and increasingly, fish in the aquaculture industry (fish farming).  Modern history  \\"Slaughtered Ox\\" by Rembrandt, 1655 Blueprint for a slaughterhouse designed by Benjamin Ward Richardson, published 1908. The use of a sharpened blade for the slaughtering of livestock has been practiced throughout history. Prior to the development of electric stunning equipment, some species were killed by simply striking them with a blunt instrument, sometimes followed by exsanguination with a knife. The belief that this was unnecessarily cruel and painful to the animal eventually led to the adoption of specific stunning and slaughter methods in many countries. One of the first campaigners on the matter was the eminent physician, Benjamin Ward Richardson, who spent many years of his later working life developing more humane methods of slaughter as a result of attempting to discover and adapt substances capable of producing general or local anaesthesia to relieve pain in people. As early as 1853, he designed a chamber that could kill animals by gassing them. He also founded the Model Abattoir Society in 1882 to investigate and campaign for humane methods of slaughter and experimented with the use of electric current at the Royal Polytechnic Institution. The development of stunning technologies occurred largely in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1911, the Council of Justice to Animals (later the Humane Slaughter Association, or HSA) was established in England to improve the slaughter of livestock. In the early 1920s, the HSA introduced and demonstrated a mechanical stunner, which led to the adoption of humane stunning by many local authorities. The HSA went on to play a key role in the passage of the Slaughter of Animals Act 1933. This made the mechanical stunning of cows and electrical stunning of pigs compulsory, with the exception of Jewish and Muslim meat. Modern methods, such as the captive bolt pistol and electric tongs were required, and the act's wording specifically outlawed the poleaxe. The period was marked by the development of various innovations in slaughterhouse technologies, not all of them particularly long- lasting.  Methods  Many countries have adopted the principle of a two- stage process for the non-ritual slaughter of animals to ensure a rapid death with minimal suffering. The first stage of the process, usually called stunning, is meant to render the animal fully unconscious, and thus not susceptible to pain, but not necessarily dead. In the second stage, the animal is killed, usually by slitting its throat and allowing the blood to drain. Countries differ in the methods which have been legalised for different species or different ages, some regulations being governmental, others being religious.  Stunning  Various methods are used to render an animal unconscious during animal slaughter. ;Electrical (stunning or slaughtering with electric current known as electronarcosis):This method is used for swine, sheep, calves, cattle, and goats. Current is applied either across the brain or the heart to render the animal unconscious before being killed. In industrial slaughterhouses, chickens are killed prior to scalding by being passed through an electrified water-bath while shackled. ;Gaseous (Carbon dioxide):This method can be used for sheep, calves and swine. The animal is asphyxiated by the use of CO2 gas before being killed. In several countries, CO2 stunning is mainly used on pigs. A number of pigs enter a chamber which is then sealed and filled with 80% to 90% CO2 in air. The pigs lose consciousness within 13 to 30 seconds. Older research produced conflicting results, with some showing pigs tolerated CO2 stunning and others showing they did not. However, the current scientific consensus is that the \\"inhalation of high concentration of carbon dioxide is aversive and can be distressing to animals.\\" Nitrogen has been used to induce unconsciousness, often in conjunction with CO2. Domestic turkeys are averse to high concentrations of CO2 (72% CO2 in air) but not low concentrations (a mixture of 30% CO2 and 60% argon in air with 3% residual oxygen). Stunning a cow with a captive bolt pistol A hen being slaughtered in Brazil ;Mechanical (Captive bolt pistol):This method can be used for sheep, swine, goats, calves, cattle, horses, mules, and other equines. A captive bolt pistol is applied to the head of the animal to quickly render them unconscious before being killed. There are three types of captive bolt pistols, penetrating, non-penetrating and free bolt. The use of penetrating captive bolts has largely been discontinued in commercial situations to minimize the risk of transmission of disease when parts of the brain enter the bloodstream. ;Firearm (gunshot/free bullet): This method can be used for cattle, calves, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, and other equines. A conventional firearm is used to fire a bullet into the brain of the animal to render the animal quickly unconscious (and presumably dead).  Killing  Video of hen being slaughtered Chicken slaughter at the market in Indonesia ;Exsanguination: The animal either has its throat cut or has a chest stick inserted cutting close to the heart. In both these methods, main veins and/or arteries are cut and allowed to bleed. ;Drug administration:Drug administration is used to ensure the animal is dead. However, being that this method is expensive, time-consuming, and renders the animals' bodies toxic and inedible, it is mainly used for animal euthanasia, not as a commercialized slaughter method.  Preslaughter handling  Inside a truck transporting farm animals to slaughter. Dehydration, injuries, stress, and disease are common during preslaughter transport, and cramped and unhygienic conditions are typical of the process. Whether animals are humanely stunned before slaughter or not, they can suffer stress while waiting to be killed. A 1996 veterinary review found that there are many ways in which animals suffer and die during the preslaughter period. They include: * Dehydration: Animals may not be provided with water at market or during their journey to the slaughterhouse and may arrive dehydrated. The effects of severe dehydration include severe thirst, nausea, a hot-dry body, dry tongue, loss of co-ordination and concentrated urine of a small volume. * Emotional stress during transport: The unfamiliarity of being on board a transport truck causes fear in animals, and if they are cooped up with others who they do not know, they may start fighting. The noise and jolting of the truck also causes stress and cows, pigs, horses and birds are at particular risk of suffering from motion sickness. * Temperature stress during transport: Some animals die because of the heat that develops in the closely confined conditions on board the transport truck. During transport, animals are not able to express all the behaviors which normally allow them to keep cool like seeking shade, wallowing, licking their fur or stretching their wings and legs. During transport the only useful way they can dissipate heat is by panting. In colder climates, the animals can be exposed to extreme low temperatures, resulting in hypothermia. * Torn skin, bruising and injury: Caused by rough handling of animals, such as beating the animals with sticks when they refuse to move forward or dragging them along the ground when they fall down. The insults which lead to bruising may be painful, and the swelling and inflammation associated with a bruise lead to a longer-lasting pain. * Sickness and disease: Farmers vary between countries in their attitude as to which sick and diseased animals can be sent for slaughter. Some take the view that the slaughterhouses are expert at salvaging what they can from carcasses and so most diseased animals are sent in, whereas in other countries farmers appreciate that diseased stock are low grade and their likely low return does not justify sending them in. Sickness and disease are two of the most serious forms of animal suffering and transporting seriously ill animals imposes an additional stress. * Fecal soiling: In some countries, especially where animals come off lush pasture, transport is the main period when they pick up body surface fecal contamination. The emotional stress associated with transport no doubt induces defecation and this compounds the problem.  National laws = Europe  A pig being slaughtered in Italy. The measures for sanitary checks, animal welfare protection and slaughtering procedures are harmonised throughout the European Union, and detailed by the European Commissions' regulations CE 853/2004, 854/2004 and 1099/2009.  Canada  In Canada, the handling and slaughter of food animals is a shared responsibility of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), industry, stakeholders, transporters, operators and every person who handles live animals. Canadian law requires that all federally registered slaughter establishments ensure that all species of food animals are handled and slaughtered humanely. The CFIA verifies that federal slaughter establishments are compliant with the Meat Inspection Regulations. The CFIA's humane slaughter requirements take effect when the animals arrive at the federally registered slaughter establishment. Industry is required to comply with the Meat Inspection Regulations for all animals under their care. The Meat Inspection Regulations define the conditions for the humane slaughter of all species of food animals in federally registered establishments. Some of the provisions contained in the regulations include: *guidelines and procedures for the proper unloading, holding and movement of animals in slaughter facilities *requirements for the segregation and handling of sick or injured animals *requirements for the humane slaughter of food animals  United Kingdom  Animal slaughter in the UK is governed under both its own laws and EU law regarding slaughter. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is the main governing body responsible for legislation and codes of practice covering animal slaughter in the UK. In the UK the methods of slaughter are largely the same as those used in the United States with some differences. The use of captive bolt equipment and electrical stunning are approved methods of stunning sheep, goats, cattle and calves for consumption with the use of gas reserved for swine. Until 2004, it was illegal to slaughter animals in sight of their conspecifics (members of the same species) because it was thought to cause them distress. However, there was a concern that moving the animals away from their conspecifics to a different place to be slaughtered would increase the stun-to-kill time (time between stunning the animal and killing it) for the stunned animal, increasing the risk the animal would regain consciousness and it was consequently recommended that slaughter in front of conspecifics be permitted alongside a mandatory limit on stun-to- kill time. Legislation was introduced which allowed animals to be slaughtered in sight of their conspecifics but there was no legislation for a legal maximum stun-to-kill time. Some critics argue that this resulted in the \\"worst of both worlds\\", as it mean that the slaughter methods now caused distress to conspecifics without reliably ensuring the animals were killed before regaining consciousness.Aid, Animal. \\"The humane slaughter myth.\\" (2009), page 16  United States  In the United States, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) specifies the approved methods of livestock slaughter: Each of these methods is outlined in detail, and the regulations require that inspectors identify operations which cause \\"undue\\" \\"excitement and discomfort\\" of animals. In 1958, the law that is enforced today by the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) was passed as the Humane Slaughter Act of 1978. This Act requires the proper treatment and humane handling of all food animals slaughtered in USDA inspected slaughter plants. It does not apply to chickens or other birds. = 4D Meat = Meat from animals which are dead, diseased, disabled or dying (4-D meat) on the arrival at the slaughterhouse is often salvaged for rendering, and used by a wide range of industries including pet food manufacturers, zoos, greyhound kennels, and mink ranches. The U.S. Code (Title 21, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, ¬ß 644) Regulates transactions, transportation, or importation of 4‚ÄìD animals to prevent use as human food: \\"No person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of buying, selling, or transporting in commerce, or importing, dead, dying, disabled, or diseased animals, or any parts of the carcasses of any animals that died otherwise than by slaughter, shall buy, sell, transport, offer for sale or transportation, or receive for transportation, in commerce, or import, any dead, dying, disabled, or diseased cattle, sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules or other equines, or parts of the carcasses of any such animals that died otherwise than by slaughter, unless such transaction, transportation or importation is made in accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe to assure that such animals, or the unwholesome parts or products thereof, will be prevented from being used for human food purposes.\\" The 2004 report to US Congress titled ‚ÄúAnimal Rendering: Economics and Policy‚Äù, available in the library of Congressional Research Service, in the ‚ÄòIntroduction‚Äô paragraph explains Renderers in the US and Canada convert dead animals and other waste material into sellable products: ‚ÄúRenderers convert dead animals and animal parts that otherwise would require disposal into a variety of materials, including edible and inedible tallow and lard and proteins such as meat and bone meal (MBM). These materials in turn are exported or sold to domestic manufacturers of a wide range of industrial and consumer goods such as livestock feed and pet food, soaps, pharmaceuticals, lubricants, plastics, personal care products, and even crayons.‚Äù Although some authors have found health problems associated with the consumption of 4D meat by certain species in its raw form, or found it potentially hazardous, FDA considers it fit for animal consumption: \\"Pet food consisting of material from diseased animals or animals which have died otherwise than by slaughter, which is in violation of 402(a)(5) will not ordinarily be actionable, if it is not otherwise in violation of the law. It will be considered fit for animal consumption.\\"  Religious laws Ritual slaughter is the overarching term accounting for various methods of slaughter used by religions around the world for food production. While keeping religious autonomy, these methods of slaughter, within the United States, are governed by the Humane Slaughter Act and various religion-specific laws, most notably, Shechita and Dhabihah.  Jewish law (Shechita)  Animal slaughter in Judaism falls in accordance to the religious law of Shechita. In preparation, the animal being prepared for slaughter must be considered kosher (fit) before the act of slaughter can commence and consumed. The basic law of the Shechita process requires the rapid and uninterrupted severance of the major vital organs and vessels. They slit the throat, resulting in a quick drop in blood pressure, restricting blood to the brain. This abrupt loss of pressure results in the rapid and irreversible cessation of consciousness and sensibility to pain (a requirement held in high regard by most institutions.) A sheep subjected to halal slaughter.  Islamic law (Dhabihah)  Animal slaughtering in Islam is in accordance with the Qur‚Äôan. To slaughter an animal is to cause it to pass from a living state to a dead state. For the meat to be lawful (Halal) according to Islam, it must come from an animal which is a member of a lawful species and it must be ritually slaughtered, i.e. according to the Law, or the sole code recognized by the group as legitimate. The animal is killed in ways similar to the Jewish ritual with the throat being slit (dabh), resulting in a quick drop in blood pressure, restricting blood to the brain. This abrupt loss of pressure results in the rapid and irreversible cessation of consciousness and sensibility to pain (a requirement held in high regard by most institutions.). The slaughterer must say Bismillah (In the name of Allah/God) before slaughtering the animal. Blood must be drained out of the carcass.  Sikh customs (Jhatka)  The practice of Jhatka in India developed out of the Sikh tradition in accordance with the value of Ahimsa (no harm). Sikhs believe that an animal should be slaughtered quickly and with as little pain as possible in order to reduce bad Karma that may result from such a practice. In India today most establishments will provide both Halal and Jhatka options for dishes containing chicken and lamb. Jhakta meat is not widely available outside India. Jhatka meat is also often considered to be the preferred method of slaughter for Sikhs in India and abroad.  Effects on livestock workers  In 2010, Human Rights Watch described slaughterhouse line work in the United States as a human rights crime. Slaughterhouses in the United States commonly illegally employ and exploit underage workers and illegal immigrants. In a report by Oxfam America, slaughterhouse workers were observed not being allowed breaks, were often required to wear diapers, and were paid below minimum wage. American slaughterhouse workers are three times more likely to suffer serious injury than the average American worker. NPR reports that pig and cattle slaughterhouse workers are nearly seven times more likely to suffer repetitive strain injuries than average. The Guardian reports that on average there are two amputations a week involving slaughterhouse workers in the United States. On average, one employee of Tyson Foods, the largest meat producer in America, is injured and amputates a finger or limb per month. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism reported that over a period of six years, in the UK 78 slaughter workers lost fingers, parts of fingers or limbs, more than 800 workers had serious injuries, and at least 4,500 had to take more than three days off after accidents. In a 2018 study in the Italian Journal of Food Safety, slaughterhouse workers are instructed to wear ear protectors to protect their hearing from the constant screams of animals being killed. A 2004 study in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine found that \\"excess risks were observed for mortality from all causes, all cancers, and lung cancer\\" in workers employed in the New Zealand meat processing industry. The act of slaughtering animals, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may engender psychological stress or trauma in the people involved. A 2016 study in Organization indicates, \\"Regression analyses of data from 10,605 Danish workers across 44 occupations suggest that slaughterhouse workers consistently experience lower physical and psychological well-being along with increased incidences of negative coping behavior.\\" In her thesis submitted to and approved by University of Colorado, Anna Dorovskikh states that slaughterhouse workers are \\"at risk of Perpetration-Inducted Traumatic Stress, which is a form of posttraumatic stress disorder and results from situations where the concerning subject suffering from PTSD was a causal participant in creating the traumatic situation.\\" A 2009 study by criminologist Amy Fitzgerald indicates, \\"slaughterhouse employment increases total arrest rates, arrests for violent crimes, arrests for rape, and arrests for other sex offenses in comparison with other industries.\\" As authors from the PTSD Journal explain, \\"These employees are hired to kill animals, such as pigs and cows that are largely gentle creatures. Carrying out this action requires workers to disconnect from what they are doing and from the creature standing before them. This emotional dissonance can lead to consequences such as domestic violence, social withdrawal, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, and PTSD.\\"  Controversy  There has been controversy over whether or not animals should be slaughtered and over the various methods used. Some people believe sentient beings should not be harmed regardless of the purpose, or that meat production is an insufficient justification for harm. Religious slaughter laws and practices have always been a subject of debate, and the certification and labeling of meat products remain to be standardized. Animal welfare concerns are being addressed to improve slaughter practices by providing more training and new regulations. There are differences between conventional and religious slaughter practices, although both have been criticized on grounds of animal welfare. Concerns about religious slaughter focus on the stress caused during the preparation stages before the slaughtering, pain and distress that may be experienced during and after the neck cutting and the worry of a prolonged period of time of lost brain function during the points between death and preparation if a stunning technique such as electronarcosis is not applied. In the United States, many public protest slaughters were held in the late 1960s and early 1970s by the National Farmers Organization. Protesting low prices for meat, farmers would kill their own animals in front of media representatives. The carcasses were wasted and not eaten. However, this effort backfired because it angered television audiences to see animals being needlessly and wastefully killed.

The CWA was the name of the \\"governing body\\" for the Championship Wrestling, Inc. promotion which was usually referred to as Mid-Southern Wrestling or the Memphis territory. This promotion was a chief NWA territory during the 1970s and early 1980s while operating out of Tennessee and Kentucky. The CWA was a member of the National Wrestling Alliance until 1986 and affiliated with the American Wrestling Association until 1989. In 1989, the CWA merged with the World Class Wrestling Association to form the United States Wrestling Association thus ceasing to exist as a separate entity. Lance Russell and Dave Brown were the television commentators and hosts for the Memphis territory, including the Continental Wrestling Association.  History = The split  The professional wrestling territory commonly referred to as the ‚ÄúMemphis Area‚Äù was originally part of the NWA Mid-America promotion that was founded in the 1940s. It operated in Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee, but also included stops in surrounding cities and states. The \\"NWA Mid-American\\" territory featured tag teams in nearly all of its main events, and sometimes featuring only one or two singles matches to complement an evening of tag matches. Such teams as The Von Brauners, The Interns, The Infernos, The Bounty Hunters, Tojo Yamamoto and Jerry Jarrett, Don and Al Green, Bobby Hart and Lorenzo Parente, The Fabulous Kangaroos, Jerry Lawler and Jim White, The Fabulous Fargos, and a host of other teams were regulars. During the mid-1970s the focal point of the territory changed from tag wrestling to singles action. In the mid-1970s the territory split in two, with separate promoters for each half. Jerry Jarrett was in charge of Memphis, Louisville, Lexington and Evansville while still part of NWA Mid-America, while Nick Gulas, who had been the primary booker, continued to promote the other half of the territory. Many of the wrestlers in the promotion were upset at Gulas for over booking his son George Gulas in the profitable Memphis half of the territory. It was very hard to believe that George could regularly beat his larger more experienced foes. George was given matches and wins over longtime veterans of the territory without \\"paying his dues\\". After Jarrett had invested a large sum of money into what he thought was a 10%-share of the promotion and learned that Gulas had tricked him into paying for an option to buy less (which by the time he learned had already expired), he decided to go his own way. Jarrett decided to break away by starting competing cards at the Cook Convention Center in March 1977. Gulas, who lived in Nashville, eventually made \\"Music City\\" his home base, running weekly cards at the Fairgrounds and all over mid-Tennessee. Originally Gulas was backed by many of the areas top draws. Jarrett, however, was backed by Jerry Lawler, who had just toppled Jackie Fargo as the headliner of the area, and second with Lawler he had Memphis. Gulas did attempt to run shows in Memphis for some time but without the headliner, Lawler, he could not compete. This split between Gulas and Jarrett created the Continental Wrestling Association as a totally separate promotion run by Jarrett. In 1980 after only three years, the Gulas territory folded when Gulas retired and the CWA took over some of the more profitable locations (e.g. Nashville). NWA affiliate (1977‚Äì1986) After the split from Nick Gulas, the CWA became a National Wrestling Alliance affiliate, which entitled the CWA to NWA World Heavyweight Championship defenses. The champion regularly toured through the territory defending the title against top contenders. The main title of the CWA was the Southern Heavyweight Title, which was nominally sanctioned by the NWA (into 1978) or the AWA (beginning in 1978). The cornerstone of the CWA was the weekly Monday night shows from the Mid-South Coliseum in Memphis, where the cards regularly drew full houses. These shows were repeated in some form weekly in Louisville and Nashville (on Saturday nights). Having three major shows at all three cities, and additional shows through other towns in Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Missouri, and Northern Alabama provided significant profits into the early 1990s. These shows showcased a series of wrestlers as they made their way through the Memphis territory including Hulk Hogan, Harley Race, Terry Funk, Jack Brisco, and Ric Flair. The biggest run of the promotion was the Jerry Lawler-Jimmy Hart feud which lasted throughout the early 1980s. Jimmy Hart's \\"First Family\\" included dozens of wrestlers who Hart brought in to face Lawler. Included in this list were The Iron Sheik, The Dream Machine, The Nightmares, Eddie Gilbert, Ken Patera, Jesse Ventura, Hulk Hogan, Bugsy McGraw, Kevin Sullivan, Bobby Eaton, \\"Killer Tim Brooks\\", and Paul Ellering. The feud ended when Hart was signed by the World Wrestling Federation in 1985, and Lawler won a match against Eddie Gilbert in which the stipulation was Hart leaving the territory. The federation also aired live Saturday-morning wrestling cards from the studios of WMC-TV in Memphis, hosted by Lance Russell and Dave Brown. In the territorial era of wrestling, many local promotions had huge ratings with their wrestling shows, but none of them topped the ratings for the weekly CWA show which drew previously unheard of shares behind the strength of Lawler's local popularity. Throughout the late 1970s, the 1980s and into the early 1990s, Jerry Lawler also engaged in feuds with Dutch Mantell, Robert Fuller, The Mongolian Stomper, Bruiser Brody, Jimmy Valiant, Austin Idol, Rocky Johnson, Tommy Rich, Randy Savage, Rick Rude, and Bill Dundee among others. These men were also on and off again partners to Lawler. Andy Kaufman comes to Memphis In the early 1980s, Andy Kaufman routinely wrestled women during his shows, proclaiming himself the ‚ÄúIntergender Wrestling Champion‚Äù and offering women $1000 if they could beat him. As part of this performance, Kaufman would imply that these matches were ‚Äúreal‚Äù and thus also imply that professional wrestling was not ‚Äúreal‚Äù, which countered the sacrosanct belief of fans in that era that wrestling was \\"real\\". Kaufman even started appearing in the Mid-South Coliseum shows wrestling women in the undercard matches, and after winning Kaufman would berate the Memphis crowd and proclaim his own greatness in the sport. He even went so far as to claim that no woman could beat him and if they did ‚Äì he would marry that woman. Jerry Lawler, however, was a proud defender of wrestling and angry at Kaufman for mocking the sport that made him a star, so he decided to coach one of Kaufman's opponents. Kaufman still won despite Lawler's coaching and gloated until Lawler had enough and pushed Kaufman, sending the comedian on a tirade. The fans loved every second of it, watching the local star defend the sport against the arrogant actor from Hollywood. During the inevitable Lawler/Kaufman match, Lawler executed two Piledrivers (a move that was \\"banned\\" in Memphis) after which Kaufman was carried out of the arena on a stretcher (kayfabe). The following day several newspapers reported that Kaufman had in fact broken his neck. Several weeks later, Kaufman returned to the Mid-South Coliseum wearing a neck brace, vowing to get even with Lawler. The feud got national exposure in several newspapers after Kaufman's supposed injury, and it would get even more press after Kaufman discussed it on Saturday Night Live. On July 27, 1982, Kaufman and Lawler were guests of David Letterman on Late Night with David Letterman. Kaufman still wore a neck brace even though the alleged injury had occurred 5 months before. Lawler described the neck brace as a \\"flea collar\\" and tensions rose between them until Lawler stood up and slapped the Kaufman out of his chair and off the stage. Kaufman unleashed a profanity-laced tirade on Lawler, culminating with Kaufmann throwing a cup of coffee at him. Kaufman continued cursing Lawler as he (Kaufmann) stormed out of the studio. The antics of Lawler and Kaufman made the NBC network executives uneasy, believing that the hatred between the two was real and that mayhem could break out at any time. Kaufman and Lawler kept claiming that their hatred and actions were real, but they were later revealed to have been a staged \\"work\\", as the two were actually friends. The truth about it being a work was kept secret for more than 10 years after Kaufman's death until the Emmy nominated documentary A Comedy Salute to Andy Kaufman aired on NBC in 1995. In a 1997 interview with the Memphis Flyer, Lawler claimed he had improvised during their first match and the Letterman incident. Although officials at St. Francis Hospital stated that Kaufman's neck injuries were real, in his 2002 biography \\"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes,\\" Lawler detailed how they came up with the angle and kept it quiet. He also said that Kaufman's explosion on Letterman was the comedian's own idea. AWA affiliation (1986‚Äì1989) At the end of 1982, Jerry Lawler had seemingly won the American Wrestling Association (AWA)'s World Title from Nick Bockwinkel, but due to the match's controversial ending, the title was returned to Bockwinkel with a rematch scheduled for January 1983. On the night of the match, manager Jimmy Hart showed up in Bockwinkel's corner, face bandaged after being beaten up by Lawler in December. Near the end of the match, Jimmy Hart showed up revealing the bandaged man to be Andy Kaufman. In the confusion Bockwinkel won the match. The Lawler/Kaufman feud ended in the early part of 1983 after Lawler threw a fireball at Kaufman, ending his run with the CWA. After Kaufman left, Lawler refocused his efforts on Jimmy Hart and his First Family stable. Lawler challenging for the World title and almost winning it was a recurring theme throughout the mid-1980s, with neither the AWA nor the NWA being willing to actually put their main title on Lawler. The NWA World title was not defended very often in the Memphis area, usually touring with companies that had more political clout in the Alliance, which meant that the CWA actually featured the AWA World champion more regularly than the group of which they were actually dues-paying members. In 1988, plans were set in motion to actually merge the AWA and the CWA into one federation in an attempt to counter the World Wrestling Federation‚Äôs national expansion. The federation was renamed the Championship Wrestling Association in late-1987 when Lawler began co-promoting with Jarrett. Subsequently, all singles titles in the CWA (AWA Southern, CWA/AWA International and NWA Mid-America Heavyweight) were merged in order to recognize one CWA Heavyweight Champion. On May 9, 1988 in Memphis, Lawler took on the reigning AWA World Champion Curt Hennig and won the title. As the year went on the AWA/CWA alliance was expanded to include the World Class Wrestling Association out of Texas, with a title unification match set for the AWA‚Äôs first (and only) pay-per-view, AWA SuperClash III. Lawler retained the AWA World Heavyweight Championship and won the WCWA World Heavyweight Championship in controversial fashion‚Äîthe match was stopped due to excessive blood loss from Kerry Von Erich‚Äîand was declared the ‚ÄúUnified World Champion‚Äù, cementing his claim by carrying the AWA and WCCW titles with him. Due to controversies following the PPV, the CWA (and WCCW) broke off their relationship with the AWA, and Lawler was stripped of the AWA World title. In retaliation, Lawler kept the physical AWA World Heavyweight championship belt for not getting his payoff for SuperClash III. After the cooperative attempt with the AWA failed, Jerry Jarrett bought WCCW from the Von Erichs and unified the two promotions as the United States Wrestling Association in 1989, thus ending the era of Continental Wrestling Association.

Within a year of the settlement of Newtown, some of its proprietors began moving away from the central village to some of their larger parcels. Colonists found that the Pootatuck River at Sandy Hook allowed for saw and grist mills, leading to it becoming one of the first outlying areas to be settled.

It is owned by Forever Media Inc. LLC. The station originates its programming from facilities it shares with WKST and WUZZ in New Castle, Pennsylvania. WYLE is a station in the Pittsburgh Steelers radio network. History=Beginnings as WEDA-FM WYLE first signed on the air on September 10, 1962 as WEDA-FM, under the ownership of WEDA Inc. James V. Perry served as president and general manager. Studios were located at 125 S. Broad Street in Grove City. The station first broadcast at this frequency with a power output of 3,000 watts. For much of its early history, the station broadcast a format of easy-listening and adult contemporary music until the early 1980s, when it adopted an urban contemporary format, but then reverted to adult contemporary music by 1986 when the station went through its first ownership change in December of that year. Western Pennsylvania Radio was a division of Beta Broadcasting, a corporation headed by Bruce Simel. As WRKU-FM By the end of the 1980s, WEDA-FM underwent a substantial change. It changed its format from adult contemporary to AOR and adopted the call letters WRKU-FM, and the resulting position statement \\"K-Rock: We Will Rock You\\". The station was also granted a substantial transmitter power increase from 3,000 to 50,000 watts ERP, which also allowed it to relocate its studios and offices to the Churchill Square shopping center at 4531 Belmont Avenue in Youngstown, Ohio. Because there was no album rock station on the air in the Youngstown radio market at the time, WRKU-FM became the de facto rock station in that city, while still retaining its community of license as Grove City. As WICT In November 1994, WRKU-FM was sold for $1.4 million to Zapis Communications, which also acquired WHTX, a competing station licensed to Sharpsville, Pennsylvania and its sister, WRQQ in Farrell, Pennsylvania. The transaction occurred after FCC ownership rules were relaxed allowing owners the opportunity to acquire more than one FM and one AM in a single market. The WRKU-FM format and call letters were spun off to WHTX, so that 95.1 could adopt a country music format and the call letters WICT-FM, following the lead of stations in other markets switching to country after a surge in that format's popularity. WRQQ was rechristened WICT, making it a full-time simulcast of its new FM sister. The new WICT-AM/FM then became known as \\"Cat Country\\", slowly evolving into its existing format. John Thomas the only remaining staff member of the WRKU demise was named Program Director. WICT-FM, along with the newly rechristened WICT and WRKU-FM, then moved its studios and offices to 4800 Belmont Avenue in Youngstown. The station would make one final studio move during its time in Ohio, and that would be near Ohio Route 82 to 6874 Strimbu Drive SE in Brookfield, Ohio, after the station was acquired by GOCOM Communications in February 1998. As WWGY In February 2004, WICT was acquired by its current owner, Altoona, Pennsylvania-based Forever Media Inc., for $2.28 million. Upon purchasing the station, Forever Media Inc. moved the station's studios and offices back to Pennsylvania, co-located them with new dual AM sister stations WBZY and WKST at 219 Savannah-Gardner Road in New Castle, where it remains today. WICT's call letters were then changed to WWGY, and like the majority of country stations under the Forever umbrella, took the \\"Froggy\\" brand as \\"Froggy 95\\".

The artifact derives its name from a particularly noticeable manifestation that arises in simulations of particles in vacuum, where the system being simulated acquires high linear momentum and experiences extremely damped internal motions, freezing the system into a single conformation reminiscent of an ice cube or other rigid body flying through space. The artifact is entirely a consequence of molecular dynamics algorithms and is wholly unphysical, since it violates the principle of equipartition of energy. Origin and avoidance The flying ice cube artifact arises from repeated rescalings of the velocities of the particles in the simulation system. Velocity rescaling is a means of imposing a thermostat on the system by multiplying the velocities of a system's particles by a factor after an integration timestep is completed, as is done by the Berendsen thermostat and the Bussi‚ÄìDonadio‚ÄìParrinello thermostat. These schemes fail when the rescaling is done to a kinetic energy distribution of an ensemble that is not invariant under microcanonical molecular dynamics; thus, the Berendsen thermostat (which rescales to the isokinetic ensemble) exhibits the artifact, while the Bussi‚ÄìDonadio‚ÄìParrinello thermostat (which rescales to the canonical ensemble) does not exhibit the artifact. Rescaling to an ensemble that is not invariant under microcanonical molecular dynamics results in a violation of the balance condition that is a requirement of Monte Carlo simulations (molecular dynamics simulations with velocity rescaling thermostats can be thought of as Monte Carlo simulations with molecular dynamics moves and velocity rescaling moves), which is the artifact's underlying reason. When the flying ice cube problem was first found, the Bussi‚ÄìDonadio‚ÄìParrinello thermostat had not yet been developed, and it was desired to continue using the Berendsen thermostat due to the efficiency with which velocity rescaling thermostats relax systems to desired temperatures. Thus, suggestions were given to avoid the flying ice cube effect under the Berendsen thermostat, such as periodically removing the center-of-mass motions and using a longer temperature coupling time. However, more recently it has been recommended that the better practice is to discontinue use of the Berendsen thermostat entirely in favor of the Bussi‚ÄìDonadio‚ÄìParrinello thermostat, as it has been shown that the latter thermostat does not exhibit the flying ice cube effect.

Most often, these maneuvers are performed on obstacles such as jumps, halfpipes, quarterpipes, hips, handrails, funboxes, or ledges, or on the surface of the snow. Many have their origins in older board sports such as skateboarding and surfing. Snowboard trick nomenclature Snowboard tricks are named in the same manner that earlier board sports (skateboarding, surfing) named their maneuvers. Stances ;Regular: Rides with left foot forward in natural stance. ;Goofy: Rides with right foot forward in natural stance. Identifying whether a snowboarder is a regular stance or goofy stance rider is important to determine which trick is being performed. For example, if the rider enters a jump with left foot leading and performs one-and-a-half revolutions in the counterclockwise direction, the trick is known as a frontside 540 for a regular rider, and a cab 540 (or switch frontside 540) for a goofy rider. =Switch-stance and fakie= The terms switch-stance (switch) and fakie are often used interchangeably in snowboarding, though there is a distinct difference. The switch identifier refers to any trick that a snowboarder performs with their back foot forward, or the reverse of their natural stance. A snowboarder can also be said to be riding switch while traveling opposite from their natural stance when no trick is being performed. At this time, the leading tip of their board is referred to as the nose. Alternatively, the identifier fakie has its origin in skateboarding, a discipline where the feet are not attached to the board, but where the skateboarder's natural stance includes positioning the trailing foot on the kicked tail of the skateboard. On a skateboard, fakie refers to an instance where the skateboarder is traveling backward, but their feet remain in the same position on the skateboard as their natural stance. Snowboarders will distinguish between fakie and switch, even though their feet never change position on the snowboard. The term switch is far more common when describing snowboard tricks, and a switch trick is any trick that is initiated switch- stance. Landing switch means that the snowboarder has landed with their back foot forwards. The term fakie will sometimes refer to landing a trick or maneuver performed on a skateboard. An air-to-fakie, for instance, would be a straight air on a vertical feature with no rotation, and re-entering the same transition. The rider would land fakie and would, therefore, be riding switch. Another common way that the term fakie is used is when the identifier switch creates a redundant description. For example, much like skateboarding's conventions, a snowboarder would say fakie ollie, rather than switch nollie. Frontside and backside The identifiers frontside and backside describe how a trick is performed. These identifiers are very important technical terms and are commonly misunderstood because of their different uses for jumps and rails. For aerial maneuvers, frontside and backside identify the direction of rotation of a spin. For instance a regular rider doing a frontside spin off a jump would rotate their body counterclockwise opening their shoulders up so that their \\"front side\\" is the first side of their body going forward off the jump in the first 90 degrees of their spin. A regular rider doing a backside spin off a jump would rotate their body clockwise closing their shoulders so that their \\"back side\\" is the first side of their body going forward off the jump in the first 90 degrees of their spin. For tricks performed on obstacles such as rails, frontside and backside refer to the direction from which the snowboarder approaches the obstacle. A regular rider approaching a rail from the left side of the rail would be considered frontside because the \\"front side\\" of their body is facing the rail. A regular rider approaching a rail from the right side of the rail would be considered backside because the \\"back side\\" of their body is facing the rail. A regular rider doing a frontside spin onto a rail would rotate their body clockwise and then land on the rail. A regular rider doing a backside spin onto a rail would rotate their body counterclockwise and then land on the rail. Straight airs ;Ollie: A trick in which the snowboarder springs off the tail of the board and into the air. ;Nollie: A trick in which the snowboarder springs off the nose of the board and into the air. ;Switch ollie: While riding switch, the snowboarder performs an ollie. ;Fakie ollie (Switch Nollie):While riding switch, the snowboarder springs off of their 'new nose' and into the air. This resembles an ollie, but the snowboarder is riding in switch. ;Shifty: An aerial trick in which a snowboarder twists their body in order to shift or rotate their board about 90¬∞ from its normal position beneath them, and then returns the board to its original position before landing. This trick can be performed frontside or backside, and also in variation with other tricks and spins. ;Air-to-fakie: Airing straight out of a vertical transition (halfpipe, quarterpipe) and then re-entering fakie, without rotation. ;Poptart: Airing from fakie to forward on a quarterpipe or halfpipe without rotation. Grabs An overview of a number of common grabs ;One-Two: A trick in which the rider's front hand grabs the heel edge behind their back foot. ;A B: A trick in which the rider's rear hand grabs the heel side of the board front for the front bindings. ;Beef Carpaccio : A Roast Beef and Chicken Salad (in between the legs) at the same time with hands crossed. ;Beef Curtains : A Roast Beef and Grosman (in between the legs) at the same time. Also known as The King or Steak Tar Tar ;Bloody Dracula: A trick in which the rider grabs the tail of the board with both hands. The rear hand grabs the board as it would do it during a regular tail-grab but the front hand blindly reaches for the board behind the riders back. ;Canadian Bacon: The rear hand reaches behind the rear leg to grab the toe edge between the bindings while the rear leg is boned. ;Cannonball/UFO: A trick in which the nose and tail of the board are grabbed simultaneously. ;Chicken salad: The rear hand reaches between the legs and grabs the heel edge between the bindings while the front leg is boned. The wrist is rotated inward to complete the grab. ;China air (West Coast) /Korean air (East Coast): An easier version of the Japan Air; the front hand grabs the toe side in front of the front foot. Both knees are then bent. ;Crail: The rear hand grabs the toe edge in front of the front foot while the rear leg is boned. Alternatively, some consider any rear handed grab in front of the front foot on the toeside edge a crail grab, classifying a grab to the nose a \\"nose crail\\" or \\"real crail\\". ;Cross-rocket: Advanced variation of a Rocket Air, where the arms are crossed in order to grab opposite sides of the nose of the board, while the rear leg is boned straight and the front leg is tucked up. ;Drunk Driver: Similar to a Truck driver, it is a stalefish grab and mute grab performed at the same time. ;Frontside grab/indy: A fundamental trick performed by grabbing the toe edge between the bindings with the trailing hand. This trick is referred to as a frontside grab on a straight air, or while performing a frontside spin. When performing a backside aerial or backside rotation, this grab is referred to as an Indy. The frontside air was popularized by skateboarder Tony Alva. ;Gorilla: Both hands grab toeside between the bindings. ;Japan air: The front hand grabs the toe edge in between the feet and the front knee is pulled to the board. ;Lien air: When performing a frontside air on transition, the snowboarder grabs heelside in front or behind the leading binding with their leading hand. In order for it to be a Lien air, the board can not be tweaked and has to be kept flat. The origin of the name of the trick is the reverse spelling of skateboarder Neil Blender's first name. Snowboarder busting a method air off a cornice‚Äîa classic style of aerial grab and board tweak ;Korean bacon: The KB is when the leading arm reach between the legs from behind and grab the toe edge at the front foot bending the knees pulling the board to the back. (Tweaked). ;Melanchollie; Melon: The front hand reaches behind the front leg and grabs the heel edge in-between the bindings while the front leg is boned. ;Melon, water: A melon grab where the rider bones the front leg and turns the board the 45¬∞ angle. ;Method: A fundamental trick performed by bending the knees to lift the board behind the rider's back, and grabbing the heel edge of the snowboard with the leading hand. Variations on the method include : :;Power method, cross bone, or Palmer method: Performed by grabbing the heel edge with the leading hand, and tucking up the board while kicking out the rear foot in such a way that the base of the board is facing forward. Derived from the snowboarder Chris Roach of Grass Valley, CA. Other notable riders who popularized this air include snowboarders Jamie Lynn, Shaun Palmer, Terry Kidwell, and skateboarders Steve Caballero and Christian Hosoi. :;Suitcase: A method in which the knees are bent so that the front hand is able to grab the toe edge and hold the board 'like a suitcase.' ;Mindy, Super: Both hands grab toeside outside of the bindings. ;Mule kick: An early snowboarder adaptation of the skateboarders method air. Often called a Toyota air, after its similar posturing to the early 1980s Toyota \\"Oh What A Feeling\\" ad campaign featuring people jumping off the ground, performed by jumping into an aerial backbend with legs bending until nearly kicking yourself in the butt as with skiing's backscratcher air, both arms bent back high over the head and not grabbing the board. Still occasionally seen and widely regarded as terrible. ;Mute: The front hand grabs the toe edge either between the toes or in front of the front foot. Variations include the Mute Stiffy, in which a mute grab is performed while straightening both legs, or alternatively, some snowboarders will grab mute and rotate the board frontside 90 degrees. ;Nose Grab: The front hand grabs the nose of the snowboard. ;Nuclear: The rear hand reaches across the front of the body and grabs the heel edge in front of the front foot. ;Pickpocket: The front hand reaches behind the back and grabs the toe side of the board in front of the back foot and tweaks it back. ;Perfect: The front hand grabs the tail of the board. ;Roast beef: The rear hand reaches between the legs and grabs the heel edge between the bindings while the rear leg is boned. ;Rocket Air: The front hand grabs the toe edge in front of the front foot (mute) and the back leg is boned while the board points perpendicular to the ground. ;Rusty Trombone: A Roast Beef and Nose grab performed at the same time. ;Seatbelt: The front hand reaches across the body and grabs the tail while the front leg is boned. The snowboarders's arm resembles the sash of a three-point seatbelt, hence the name. ;Slob: The front hand grabs mute, the back leg is boned and the board is kept parallel with the ground. ;Stiffy: Grab indy in between the bindings and bone both legs 90¬∞ to the body. ;Stalefish: Back hand grabs the heel edge of the board between the feet, around the outside of the knee. ;Squirrel: A trick in which the rider's front hand grabs the heel edge in front of the front foot and their rear/back hand grabs the heel edge behind the rear foot. ;Swiss cheese air: The rear hand reaches between the legs and grabs the heel edge in front of the front foot while the back leg is boned. ;Tailfish: Similar in naming convention to a Tindy, Tailfish is a portmanteau of 'Tail' and 'Stalefish'. The trailing hand grabs the heel edge between rear binding and the tail. ;Tail Grab: The rear hand grabs the tail of the snowboard. Variations include straightening, or 'boning' the front leg, or 'tweaking' the board slightly frontside or backside. ;Taipan air: The back hand grabs the toe edge just in front of the rear foot. However, the arm must go around the outside of your rear knee. The board is then pulled behind the rider (tweaked). The name Taipan is a portmanteau of tail/Japan air. ;Tindy: The tindy grab is a controversial grab, and the name is a portmanteau of 'tail' and 'indy'. The trailing hand grabs between the rear binding and the tail on the toe edge. ;Truck driver: When both hands grab Indy and Melon. Spins Spins are typically performed in 180¬∞ increments due to the nature of the obstacles on which they are performed. Even in cases where spins are performed on unconventional obstacles, the rotation is regarded as the nearest increment of 180¬∞, and can be identified by the direction of approach and landing (regular and switch). A spin attempted from a jump to a rail is the only time a spin can be referred to in a 90-degree increment, examples: 270 (between a 180 and 360-degree spin) or 450 (between a 360 and 540-degree spin). These spins can be frontside, backside, cab, or switch-backside just like any other spins. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world's first quadruple cork 1800, the biggest spin ever.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/16/snowboarder-billy-morgan- lands-a-world-first-1800-quadruple-cork-trick The term \\"Cab\\" in snowboarding generally refers to any switch-frontside spin (no matter what the amount of rotation) on any feature (halfpipe, jumps, rails, boxes). For example, a \\"switch-frontside 1080 double cork\\" off a jump would be referred to as a \\"cab 1080 double cork\\". The term was originally only applied to a switch-frontside 360 in a halfpipe in which a rider would take off a wall switch, spin 360 degrees frontside, and land on their comfortable stance (regular/goofy). Therefore, the term Cab only applied to tricks in the halfpipe in which rotations were in full 360 increments, such as a \\"Cab 360\\" or \\"Cab 720.\\" For example, since a switch-frontside 540 would land a rider in the same switch position they took off from in the halfpipe, it was not referred to as a \\"Cab 540\\" because the rider did not take off switch, spin frontside, and land in their comfortable stance. A Half-Cab is a switch-frontside 180 spin. An alley- oop is a spin performed in a halfpipe or quarterpipe in which the spin is rotated in the opposite direction of the air. For example, performing a frontside rotation on the backside wall of a halfpipe, or spinning clockwise while traveling right-to-left through the air on a quarterpipe would mean the spin was alley-oop. Hard Way: A term used when spinning onto a feature or off a jump using your opposite edge to start the direction of your spin. Example- If a regular rider was to spin Hard Way front side 270 onto rail, they would start that spin off their toe side edge. That would make the trick a Hard Way front side 270. Opposite of the traditional front side rotation starting with your heel edge. Same applies to goofy riders. Flips and inverted rotations ;Back flip: Flipping backwards (like a standing backflip) off of a jump. ;Front flip: Flipping forward (like a standing frontflip) off of a jump. ;Crippler: An inverted 540 degree spin performed on the frontside wall of the halfpipe ;Wildcat: A backflip performed on a straight jump, with an axis of rotation in which the snowboarder flips in a backward, cartwheel-like fashion. A double wildcat is called a supercat. ;Tamedog: A frontflip performed on a straight jump, with an axis of rotation in which the snowboarder flips in a forward, cartwheel-like fashion. ;McTwist: A forward-flipping backside 540, performed in a halfpipe, quarterpipe, or similar obstacle. The rotation may continue beyond 540¬∞ (e.g., McTwist 720). The origin of this trick comes from vert ramp skateboarding, and was first performed on a skateboard by Mike McGill. :;Double McTwist: Shaun White is credited as the creator of the Double McTwist 1260, but Ben Stewart performs the trick in some of the earliest archival footage. Shaun White was the first athlete to perform the trick in competition at the 2010 Winter Olympics giving it worldwide recognition and giving it the name \\"Tomahawk\\".http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/snowboarding/news/story?id=4923369 Since then, numerous athletes have performed the Double McTwist 1260 including Iouri Podladtchikov. ;Haakon flip: An aerial maneuver performed in a halfpipe by taking off backwards, and performing an inverted 720¬∞ rotation. The rotation mimics a half-cab leading to McTwist, and is named after freestyle legend Terje Haakonsen of Norway. ;Lando-Roll: A Frontside cork 540/720 method done by Alaskan snowboarder Mark Landvik. ;Backside Misty: After a rider learns the basic backside 540 off the toes, the Misty Flip can be an easy next progression step. Misty Flip is quite different than the backside rodeo, because instead of corking over the heel edge with a back flip motion, the Misty corks off the toe edge specifically and has more of a Front Flip in the beginning of the trick, followed by a side flip coming out to the landing. ;Frontside Misty: The Frontside misty ends up looking quite a bit like a frontside rodeo in the middle of the trick, but at take off the rider uses a more frontflip type of motion to start the trick. The frontside Misty can only be done off the toes and the rider will wind up to spin frontside, then snap their trailing shoulder towards their front foot and the lead shoulder will release towards the sky. as they unwind at takeoff release. Usually grabbing Indy the rider follows the lead shoulder through the rotation to 540, 720 and even 900. ;Chicane: A chicane is a rarely done trick that involves doing a frontside 180 with a front flip on the X Axis. Opposite of the 90 roll, the chicane is frontside 90, tuck front flip, 90 degrees more to land switch, or vice versa. ;Frontside Rodeo: The basic frontside rodeo is all together a 540. It essentially falls into a grey area between an off axis frontside 540 and a frontside 180 with a back flip blended into it. The grab choice and different line and pop factors can make it more flipy or more of an off-axis spin. Frontside rodeo can be done off the heels or toes and with a little more spin on the Z Axis can go to 720 or 900. It is possible to do it to a 1080 but, if there is too much flip in the spin, it can be hard not to over flip when going past 720 and 900. The bigger the Z Axis spin, the later the inverted part of the rotation should be. Gaining control on big spin rodeos, may lead to a double cork or a second flip rotation in the spin, if the rider has developed a comfort level with double flips on the tramp or other gymnastic environment.;Rodeo flip; frontside rodeo: A frontward-flipping frontside spin done off the toe-edge. Most commonly performed with a 540¬∞ rotation, but also performed as a 720¬∞, 900¬∞, etc.. ;Backside Rodeo flip: A backward-flipping backside spin. Most commonly performed with a 540¬∞ rotation, but also performed as a 720¬∞, 900¬∞, etc.. ;Ninety Roll: A trick performed by back- flipping toward the landing of a jump, with a total rotation of 180¬∞ backside (i.e. spin 90¬∞ backside-backflip-spin 90¬∞), therefore landing fakie. Essentially, this is a backside 180 backflip. This trick is sometimes confused with a backside Rodeo, though the Ninety Roll has a much more linear axis of rotation. ;Michalchuk: A trademark flip first performed in the halfpipe by Michael Michalchuk. A flat-spinning, on-axis backflip often grabbing melon, indy or method and rotating 540 degrees. ;Doublechuk: A variation of the Michalchuk, but with two backflip rotations. ;Rippey flip: A back-flipping frontside 360¬∞, typically performed with a method grab. Named after its originator, Jim Rippey, although already performed 5 years earlier by former pro skateboarder and snowboarder John Cardiel. ;Sato flip: Halfpipe trick done by Rob Kingwill (Sato is the Japanese word for sugar). It is something like a frontside McTwist. The rider rides up the transition of the pipe as if doing a frontside 540¬∞, pops in the air and grabs frontside, then throws head, shoulders, and hips down. ;Cork: Spins are corked or corkscrew when the axis of the spin allows for the snowboarder to be oriented sideways or upside-down in the air, typically without becoming completely inverted (though the head and shoulders should drop below the relative position of the board). A Double- Cork refers to a rotation in which a snowboarder inverts or orients themselves sideways at two distinct times during an aerial rotation. David Benedek is the originator of the Double-Cork in the Half-pipe, but the Double-Cork is also a very common trick in Big-Air competitions. Shaun White is known for making this trick famous in the half-pipe. Several snowboarders have recently extended the limits of technical snowboarding by performing triple-cork variations, Torstein Horgmo being the first to land one in competition. Mark McMorris originated Backside Triple-Cork 1440's in 2011. In April 2015 British snowboarder and Winter Olympic medallist Billy Morgan demonstrated the world's first quadruple cork 1800.https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/apr/16/snowboarder-billy-morgan- lands-a-world-first-1800-quadruple-cork-trick Inverted hand plants ;Invert: Overlaying term for handstands on the edge of a halfpipe ;Handplant: A 180¬∞ degree handplant in which the rear hand is planted on the lip of the wall and the rotation is frontside. ;Sad plant: An invert with a sad grab (melon grab). ;Elguerial: An invert where the halfpipe wall is approached fakie, the rear hand is planted, a 360 degree backside rotation is made, and the rider lands going forward. Named after Eddie Elguera. ;Eggplant: A one- handed 180¬∞ invert in which the front hand is planted on the lip of the wall and the rotation is backside. ;Eggflip: An eggplant where the rider chooses to flip over in order to re-enter the pipe instead or rotating 180 degrees. This trick is performed forward to fakie or switch (fakie to forward). ;McEgg: An invert where the rider plants the front hand on the wall, rotated 540 degrees in a backside direction and lands riding forward. ;Andrecht: A rear handed backside handplant with a front-handed grab. ;Miller flip: A 360¬∞ frontside handplant to fakie. ;Layback: A non-inverted handplant in which the leading hand is planted during a slide. The rider literally lays back, hence the name. ;HoHo: An invert but both hands are planted at the top of the halfpipe. ;Killer Stand: You make an invert but you also take your back/rear hand on front hand's elbow. ;Fresh: An invert (front hand) but back flip is boned; no grab ;J-Tear: Inverted frontside 540 with a hand plant in the middle. Originally a variation on the Jacoby Terror Air. This trick was invented by Mike Jacoby for a contest that didn't allow inverted aerials; inverted handplants, however, were acceptable. Slides Slides are tricks performed along the surface of obstacles like handrails and funboxes. In skateboarding, slides are distinguished from grinds because some tricks are performed by sliding on the surface of the skateboard, and others are performed by grinding on the trucks of the skateboard. However, because snowboards don't have trucks, the term grind doesn't apply to these types of maneuvers. They can still be called grinds. Many rail maneuvers are identified as frontside or backside, and these refer to the way in which the snowboarder approaches the obstacle. Frontside refers to a trick performed where a snowboarder approaches an obstacle that is in front of the toe edge of their snowboard. Backside refers to a trick performed in which a snowboarder approaches an obstacle that is behind the heel edge of their board. The direction that the snowboarder is facing while riding the obstacle has no bearing on the frontside or backside identifier. The frontside and backside identifiers are not used when a snowboarder travels straight toward the obstacle. A zeach ;50-50: A slide in which a snowboarder rides straight along a rail or other obstacle. This trick has its origin in skateboarding, where the trick is performed with both skateboard trucks grinding along a rail. ;Boardslide: A slide performed where the riders leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle. When performing a frontside boardslide, the snowboarder is facing uphill. When performing a backside boardslide, a snowboarder is facing downhill. This is often confusing to new riders learning the trick because with a frontside boardslide you are moving backward and with a backside boardslide you are moving forward. ;Lipslide: A slide performed where the rider's trailing foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular along the rail or other obstacle. When performing a frontside lipslide, the snowboarder is facing downhill. When performing a backside lipslide, a snowboarder is facing uphill. ;Bluntslide: A slide performed where the rider's leading foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular and trailing foot directly above the rail or other obstacle (like a tailslide). When performing a frontside bluntslide, the snowboarder is facing uphill. When performing a backside bluntslide, the snowboarder is facing downhill. ;Noseblunt: A slide performed where the rider's trailing foot passes over the rail on approach, with their snowboard traveling perpendicular and leading foot directly above the rail or other obstacle (like a noseslide). When performing a frontside noseblunt, the snowboarder is facing downhill. When performing a backside noseblunt, the snowboarder is facing uphill. ;Noseslide: Similar to a boardslide or lipslide, but only the nose of the board is on the feature. Proper noseslides are done with the feature directly under the front foot or farther out towards the nose. ;Tailslide: Similar to a boardslide or lipslide, but only the tail of the board is on the feature. Proper tailslides are done with the feature directly under the back foot or farther out towards the tail. ;Nosepress: A trick performed by sliding along an obstacle, with pressure being put on the nose of the board, such that the tail of the board is raised in the air. ;Tailpress: A trick performed by sliding along an obstacle, with pressure being put on the tail of the board, such that the nose of the board is raised in the air. ;MJ: A slide that somewhat resembles a 50‚Äì50, a snowboarder slides along an obstacle on their toe edge, reminiscent of a dance move made popular by Michael Jackson. ;HJ: A slide that somewhat resembles a 50-50, a snowboarder slides along an obstacle on their heel edge. ;Zeach: Any rail maneuver where the board is not solidly locked into the intended position. Named after Zach Leach, who popularized feeble or smith- esque slides in the early 2000s. ;The Gutterball: The Gutterball is a one footed (front foot is strapped in and the rear foot is unstrapped ) front boardslide with a backhanded seatbelt nose grab, resembling the body position that someone would have after releasing a bowling ball down a bowling ally. This trick was invented and named by Jeremy Cameron which won him a first place in the Morrow Snowboards \\"FAME WAR\\" Best Trick contest in 2009. Stalls Stalls in snowboarding are derived from similar tricks in skateboarding, and are typically performed in halfpipes or on similar obstacles. Variations have been adapted as snowboards do not have trucks and wheels. ;Nose-pick: Stalling on an object with the nose of the snowboard, while grabbing frontside, and then jumping back off the object into the jump you came off. ;Board-stall; Disaster: A trick performed when a rider stalls on an object with their snowboard, with the point of contact between both bindings. The Disaster variation comes from skateboarding, and involves performing a frontside or backside 180 before stalling on the lip of the obstacle, and then re-entering. ;Nose-stall: Similar to a board-stall, this variation involves stalling on the nose of the snowboard at the top of a transition or obstacle. ;Tail-stall: The opposite of a nose-stall, this trick involves stalling on an obstacle with the tail of the snowboard. Often performed by approaching an obstacle fakie or by doing a 180 after approaching the feature normally, ;Blunt-stall: Mimicking skateboarding, and similar to a board-stall, this trick is performed by stalling on an object with the tail of the board (blunt stall), or the nose of the board (nose blunt stall). Distinguished from a nose-stall or tail-stall because during the stall, most of the snowboard will be positioned above the obstacle and point of contact. (most if not all stalls are referred to as nose or tail presses in current snowboarding whether or not they are actually tail and nose stalls or blunt stalls. blunt stalls are considered to be more stylish forms of nose or tail presses however.) ;Tail-block: A trick typically performed on the snow at the peak of a transition, or occasionally on an object, in which the snowboarder springs up and stands on the tail of their board while grabbing the nose of the board. ;Nose-block: Similar to a tail-block, but performed by standing on the nose while grabbing the tail of the board. Tweaks and variations ;One- footed: Tricks performed with one foot removed from the binding (typically the rear foot) are referred to as one-footed tricks. One footed tricks include fast plants in which the rear foot is dropped and initiates a straight air or rotation, the boneless, which is a fast-plant with a grab; and the no-comply, which is a front-footed fast plant. ;Shifty: An aerial trick in which a snowboarder twists their body, rotating their board 90¬∞ and then returning it to its original position before landing. This trick can be performed frontside or backside, and also in variation with other tricks and spins. ;Stiffy: Any grab where both the legs are boned-out (straightened as much as possible). Typically performed as a variation of a mute or frontside grab. ;Stink-bug: Grabbing Frontside or Mute with the rider's elbow passing to the inside of the knees. Style conventions dictate that during a grab, the elbow should be positioned to the outside of the knee. ;Tuck knee: Where the knee of either leg is dropped down to touch the top of the board. When referring to snowboarding it means that the rider attempts to put their knee on the board by putting their knee underneath the torso and then pulling down to the board. ;Tweak: A term used in western ski areas for when a trick is highly refined in movement, such as with legs or arms fully extended, to give maximum aesthetic quality to a trick. Demonstrates high technical ability, much like in gymnastics. ;Poke: A grab trick in which the front leg only or back leg only is boned-out. Miscellaneous tricks and identifiers ;Jib : To ride on any surface that is not snow, or to ride on any feature in a non-traditional way. I.e. tapping or spinning on a death cookie or snow embankment. ;Butter : While traveling along the surface of the snow, this trick is performed by pressuring either the nose or tail of the snowboard in such a way that the opposite half of the snowboard lifts off of the snow, allowing for a pivot-like rotation. A butter can be performed as a partial rotation (90¬∞), which is then reverted, as a continuous rotation (180¬∞, 360¬∞, etc.), or as a lead-in to an aerial maneuver. (butters are similar to blunt slides in skateboarding) ;Manual; Nose manual: While riding along the snow, pressuring the nose or tail such that the opposite end of the board is raised in the air. ;Pretzel: Concluding a slide trick with a 270¬∞ spin opposite the direction in which you did a rotation during the trick's initiation. ;Sameway or Bagel: Like a Pretzel, but spinning 270¬∞ off the rail in the same direction as you got on. ;Disaster: When riding a wall ride, the rider performs a backside or frontside 180¬∞ spin and then stalls on the top of the wallride ;Bonk: To tap an object or obstacle with your board. ;Penguin Walk: To 'walk' while strapped into a snowboard by alternatively springing from nose to tail, propelling the snowboarder forward in a walking fashion. Also known as a \\"Crab\\" or \\"Duck\\" walk. This is an easy way to drop in to a slope after strapping in once you have the hang of it. ;Tail or Nose Tap: Quickly tapping your tail or nose on a feature in the snow, or quickly tapping your nose or tail on the end of a rail or box just before you ride off of it. ;Revert: To continue spinning on the snow after landing a jump in which a spinning trick was performed. This typically occurs unintentionally when the snowboarder cannot stop rotating as they land their trick. Alternatively, this term can refer to a 'return' to riding position after performing a butter or rail trick in which there was some rotation performed. In this case, it is often the reversal of a prior, partial rotation, returning the snowboarder to their original stance.

Anderson was born in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory in 1889, the same year that Wilford Woodruff became President of the Church. Anderson graduated from the Weber Stake Academy (now Weber State University) in 1905. A few years later he served as a missionary in Germany and Switzerland.Flake, Lawrence R. \\"Joseph Anderson\\" in Garr, Arnold K, Donald Q. Cannon and Richard O. Cowan, ed. Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History (Salt Lake City: Deseret Book, 2000) p. 25 Anderson became secretary to the First Presidency of the church in 1922. On 6 April 1970, church president Joseph Fielding Smith released Anderson from his secretarial duties and called him to serve as an Assistant to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. When that calling was abolished in 1976, Anderson was ordained a Seventy and became a member of the First Quorum of the Seventy. In 1978, Anderson became an emeritus general authority and was relieved of his day-to-day duties as a Seventy. Anderson died in Salt Lake City at the age of 102 and was buried at Salt Lake City Cemetery. Anderson is one of only two general authorities of the church to reach the age of 100, the second being former Presiding Patriarch Eldred G.

Plot introduction Sarah follows the story of Abraham through the eyes and perspective of Sarah. The Biblical account of the life of Sarah is contained in Genesis 12 - 22 (about 16 pages) most of which is centered on Abraham. Card expands the story into a novel of over 300 pages, so many of the details and characters are fictional. He also seems to use the Book of Abraham, a section of the LDS Standard Works. The core story-line does not deviate from the story told in Genesis and the Book of Abraham, although some of the details are reinterpreted. Sarah begins life as a princess of Ur in Mesopotamia. She is hard-working and humble especially compared to her older sister Qira. Sarai is promised to become a priestess for the goddess Asherah, while Qira is to marry a desert prince named Lot. Sarai's thoughts on a life as a priestess change when Lot arrives with his uncle Abram who promises Sarai that he'll come back and marry her.

Some Rayburnites eventually adopted Yosemite Sam from Warner Brothers Looney Tunes as the school's informal mascot. In 2007 PISD received warnings that if it didn't discontinue the use of Yosemite Sam as Sam Rayburn's mascot, the interested party would file copyright infringement charges in a court of law. PISD then forced Sam Rayburn to change its mascot. Yosemite Sam had been Rayburn's mascot for over 43 years. Athletics With American football being the primary sport for domestic attention in the school, the other sports at Sam Rayburn have seen great success, with baseball being the only sport so far to win a UIL state championship. Most recently, in 2014 the boys soccer program earned Rayburn their first district title in at least a decade. In 2012, the school was warned by the National Football League to halt usage of the Texan logo for all sports teams, as well as for the school to advertise. The school has since mostly complied by changing all logos to a unique design emphasizing the school name and nickname. Sam Rayburn is classified as 5A for UIL sports (6A for basketball & football), as the student population is expected to eclipse 3,000 for the 2014-15 school year.

The Sam Rayburn vs. PHS rivalry has been going on since Sam Rayburn became the second high school in Pasadena (3rd in Pasadena ISD) in the early 1960s. It is a tradition every year at Sam Rayburn to try and beat PHS. They play Pasadena the last game of the football season for the Pride Bowl and have an annual \\"Burn Baldy\\" bonfire the night before the game.

Location The Nova Scotia peninsula is part of the province of Nova Scotia, Canada and is connected to the neighbouring province of New Brunswick through the Isthmus of Chignecto. It fronts the open Atlantic Ocean on the south and southeast, the Gulf of Maine to the west, the Bay of Fundy and its sub-basins to the northwest, the Northumberland Strait to the north, and the Strait of Canso to the east. The narrow and deep waters of the Strait of Canso separate the peninsula from Cape Breton Island, the second largest land mass constituting the province of Nova Scotia. In addition to Cape Breton Island, other much smaller islands are geologically associated with the Nova Scotia peninsula, including Boularderie Island, Brier Island, Long Island, Pictou Island, Tancook Island and various smaller islands along the Atlantic coast. Geology The peninsula can be divided into two distinct geological regions north and south of a fault line (the Cobequid and Chedabucto faults) extending between the Bay of Fundy sub-basins of the Minas Basin and Cobequid Bay in the west, through to Chedabucto Bay in the east. North The northern portion of the peninsula is dominated by the Avalon Uplands (the Cobequid Hills and Pictou-Antigonish Highlands) and the Carboniferous Lowlands, the latter of which straddles the fault zone. The Cobequid Mountains contain the highest elevation points on the peninsula. This low, heavily eroded part of the Appalachian Mountains, along with the Pictou-Antigonish Highlands, comprises a highland across the northern portion of the peninsula with average elevations between 250‚Äì300 metres. It was heavily covered in sediment during glaciation; consequently it hosts an abundant forest as well as agricultural activities. The Carboniferous Lowlands includes carboniferous sedimentary rocks south of the Minas Basin and along the north shore of the peninsula immediately south of the Northumberland Strait. The area south and east of the Minas Basin is dominated by karst topography lending to numerous gypsum deposits. Coal seams are found in the western and central areas of Cumberland County in the Joggins-River Hebert basin and the Springhill basin, along with the Debert basin and the Pictou basin. Throughout the northern portion of the peninsula, the lowland plains, rolling uplands, and coastal fringe areas support numerous settlements, many of which developed around mineral extraction, particularly coal. When included with the Sydney and Inverness coal fields on Cape Breton Island, these regions were extremely prominent in the industrial and social development of Nova Scotia. South In addition to sharing the Carboniferous Lowlands, the southern portion of the peninsula is dominated by the Atlantic Interior (Sissiboo Lowlands, South Mountain, various slate ridges), followed by the comparatively small Triassic Lowlands (the Annapolis Valley), and the Fundy Coast (including Economy Mountain and North Mountain) and Atlantic Coast regions. The Atlantic Interior is dominated by a glacial landscape of exposed granitic rock, thick forest, drumlins and numerous lakes. The Sissiboo Lowlands comprise many river valleys and lowland inland areas in the southwest and central portion of the peninsula. The South Mountain is a steadily rising slope that descends sharply at the Annapolis Valley but more gradually toward the Atlantic, resulting in a plateau across much of the southwest interior of the peninsula with average elevations of 150 m and maximum elevations of 275 m. Slate ridges are prominent in the Rawdon Hills and Wittenburg Ridge areas along the boundary with the Carboniferous Lowlands. The Fundy Coast region includes the North Mountain ridge as well as the Digby Neck and the Economy Mountain areas along the north side of the Minas Basin. The Atlantic Coast region includes the barren and wind-swept regions from Yarmouth to Canso, extending several kilometres inland. The Triassic Lowlands is an area of soft sandstone, much of which is covered by water resulting from sea level rise. The remnant is the open ended Annapolis Valley which is sheltered by the Fundy Coast and the Atlantic Interior, providing a micro- climate unique to the Atlantic provinces and conducive to fruit and vegetable farming.  Historic name  : The present-day use of the term Acadian Peninsula refers to a peninsula in northeastern New Brunswick. The \\"Acadian Peninsula\\" in this 1754 map of Acadia refers to the present-day Nova Scotia peninsula. This territory came under British control in 1713. The term Acadian Peninsula has been used to describe the present-day Nova Scotia peninsula in historic documents. Prior to 1713, this territory was the heart of the French colony of Acadia, which focused its settlement efforts along the southern and northeastern shores of Baie Francois (now the Bay of Fundy). The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 gave Great Britain control of \\"Acadia\\", however the boundaries were never properly defined. Acadia is considered by many historians to have encompassed present-day New Brunswick, eastern Maine, Anticosti Island, the Gasp√© Peninsula, Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton Island - in other lands along the southern and western shores of the Gulf of St. Lawrence (some treaties have placed the boundary of Acadia as far south as Massachusetts). The large peninsula that is today the mainland portion of the province of Nova Scotia was referred to as the Acadian Peninsula at the time that Britain took control, with this territory falling under the Colony of Nova Scotia.

Mayor Giuliani has described himself as a moderate Republican. An August 2006 poll from Rasmussen Reports showed that the American public perceives Giuliani overall to be a moderate. Specifically, of those Americans polled, 36% classified him as a moderate, 29% as a conservative, and 15% as a liberal, with the remaining 20% being unsure. On The Issues, a non-partisan organization that records politicians' stances, considers Giuliani to be a \\"Libertarian Conservative.\\" Giuliani was originally a Democrat, and supported both John F.

He switched to the Republican Party in 1980 after a five-year stint as an Independent. Conservative political pundit George Will wrote that at the end of Giuliani's time as mayor he had run the most conservative government in America in the last 50 or 60 years.The Republican Debate on Fox News Channel NY Times, October 21, 2007 Economic policy=Taxation Giuliani has said that he cut taxes 23 times as mayor of New York City. However, the city's Independent Budget Office has pointed out that seven of these tax cuts were state initiatives, and that Giuliani had actually opposed the largest cut which was due to come with the expiration of a 12¬Ω-percent surcharge on the city's personal income tax.Giuliani takes liberties on his NYC record Boston Globe November 16, 2007. Retrieved December 4, 2007 Giuliani supported President Bush's tax cuts. In 1994, he endorsed Democratic incumbent Governor Mario Cuomo over Republican challenger George Pataki due to Pataki's proposals to cut the commuter tax. Giuliani also objected to Pataki's plan to cut income taxes by 25%. The commuter tax was a 0.45% tax paid by those who lived outside NYC but who commuted to jobs within it. Giuliani was strictly against cutting this tax, calling it \\"relatively modest and completely justified.\\" Giuliani has not signed a pledge by Americans for Tax Reform (signed by every Republican presidential nominee since 1988) to not raise taxes while in office. In 1996, Giuliani criticized a proposal by presidential candidate Steve Forbes for a national flat tax, saying its elimination of deductions for state and local income taxes would unfairly punish high-tax states such as New YorkRandy Kennedy, \\"No Endorsement, But Scorn for Flat Tax\\", The New York Times, March 4, 1996. Accessed March 29, 2007. and added that the flat tax \\"would really be a disaster.\\" By 2007, Giuliani was more amenable to a flat tax, but still claimed difficulties in adopting one. In an interview, he said: \\"If we were doing income tax for the first time. In other words, if we were starting off new back at the beginning of the last century, then probably we should go with a ‚Äì we probably should've gone with a flat tax, maybe two levels of tax, but really simple.

During the May 3, 2007, Republican Presidential debate when asked what tax would he like to cut, Giuliani responded: > We have to adjust the AMT. That has to be reduced. We have to get rid of the > death tax, which is going to go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an > incentive ‚Äì I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. > It's going to go to zero in 2010.

And I would look to try to regularize the > rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing > right now. With regard to Social Security, Giuliani has expressed his opposition to a tax increase but has declined to rule it out. Health care In 2000 Giuliani initiated what the New York Post called \\"a massive program\\" to get city employees to expand the number of low-income, uninsured children and adults into public health entitlement programs such as Medicaid, Child Health Plus and Family Health Plan. Promoting enrollment in his HealthStat program, Giuliani said at the time that the program could be \\"a model for the rest of this country for how to get people covered on the available health programs.\\"\\"New Rudy vs. Old on Kid Health,\\" New York Post, October 15, 2007, p. 8. On February 26, 2007, Giuliani said that he was against any notion of universal health care in America, which would mean a \\"socialization\\" of American medicine. \\"That would be a terrible, terrible mistake. [Solutions] have to be free market solutions. They have to be a competitive system.\\" Giuliani did say that it is an appropriate role for the government to \\"find ways\\" to expand access to health insurance.Russell Berman, \\"Giuliani: 'Party of Freedom' Will Define Republicans\\", The New York Sun, February 27, 2007. Accessed March 20, 2007. On July 29, 2007, Giuliani announced his five key health care advisors: Daniel P. Kessler, Scott W. Atlas, David G. Gratzer, Sally C. Pipes, and Donald W. Moran. On July 31, 2007, Giuliani unveiled his health care plan which proposed a tax deduction (not a tax credit) of up to $15,000 for families and up to $7,500 for individuals who purchase private individual health insurance policies. Giuliani wrote an August 3, 2007 article for The Boston Globe on his official position on health care. In it he stated that taxes should not be raised to provide more health care but instead lowered for \\"individual empowerment\\". He talked about the creation of a tax-free Health Savings Account that would allow individuals and small businesses to stock up on health insurance and in effect lower rates. > \\"America is best when we solve our problems from our strengths, not our > weaknesses.

Giuliani's support of the S-CHIP veto elicited criticism from his past supporters on health issues: Sandy Trujillo, deputy director of the Children's Defense Fund said, \\"I'm quite shocked because Giuliani was a champion of the Children's Health Insurance Program. He's re- writing his own history.\\" Government spendingStadiums= Giuliani was a supporter of public financing for sports stadiums and arenas as mayor of New York, including $194 million in the budget for sports arenas for 2001. Days before leaving office in December 2001, he announced \\"tentative agreements\\" for both the New York Yankees and New York Mets to build a $1 billion stadium. Of $1.6 billion sought for the stadiums, city and state taxpayers would pick up half the tab for construction, $800 million, along with $390 million on extra transportation. The plan also called for forgiving $80,000 that the Mets owed the city in cable revenues and giving both teams an additional $25 million in planning money. The plan also said that the teams would be allowed to keep all parking revenues, which state officials had already said they wanted to keep to compensate the state for building new garages for the teams. The teams would keep 96% of ticket revenues and 100% of all other revenues, not pay sales tax or property tax on the stadiums, and would get low-cost electricity from New York state. During his eight years as mayor, Giuliani was a constant advocate of publicly funded stadiums. Giuliani had already been instrumental in the construction of taxpayer-funded minor league baseball facilities KeySpan Park for the Mets' minor league Brooklyn Cyclones and Richmond County Bank Ballpark for the Staten Island Yankees. The dual $1 billion plans had also been put forth unsuccessfully by Giuliani in 1996. Giuliani faced questions about how to finance these stadiums, while the city struggled to balance the budget. Recently built stadiums in Baltimore and Cleveland had cost one-third to one-fourth the $1 billion set aside for the proposed New York stadiums; the $1 billion stadiums were to be the most expensive in American history. His 1998 plan to relocate the Yankees to the west side of Manhattan had been met with strong opposition; at that time, $3 million in city money was given to the Yankees for site planning. Six city officials were sent on a city trip to explore stadiums in Baltimore, Denver and other cities. Foreign policy In September 2007, the influential journal Foreign Affairs published a major exposition of Giuliani's views on foreign policy. Iran Giuliani believes that the leaders of Iran have objectives that are similar to those of al-Qaeda. In a New York Times interview he said, \\"[al-Qaeda's] movement has already displayed more aggressive tendencies by coming here and killing us,\\" and asserted that Iran has \\"a similar objective in their anger at the modern world\\".Marc Santora, \\"Giuliani Says Nation at War Requires Him\\", The New York Times, April 7, 2007 In his Foreign Affairs article, Giuliani stated that he regards the Islamic Republic of Iran as a nation which \\"has been determined to attack the international system throughout its entire existence\\" and has \\"supported terrorism and murder\\". He accused the Iranian government of \\"hiding behind the principle of sovereignty to stave off the consequences of its actions\\". Consequently, he feels that talks with Iran should only be approached from a position of strength. In his view: > \\"The theocrats ruling Iran need to understand that we can wield the stick as > well as the carrot, by undermining popular support for their regime, > damaging the Iranian economy, weakening Iran's military, and, should all > else fail, destroying its nuclear infrastructure.\\" During the May 3, 2007, Republican Presidential debate, Giuliani said: :He [Ahmadinejad] has to understand it's not an option; he cannot have nuclear weapons.Giuliani on Iran FCNL.org In the following June 5, 2007 debate, in answer to a hypothetical question about whether use of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons should be considered to keep Iran from gaining its own nuclear weapons, Giuliani said that \\"I think it could be done with conventional weapons, but you can't rule out anything and you shouldn't take any option off the table.\\"\\"Transcript: Third G.O.P. Debate\\", The New York Times, June 5, 2007. In September 2007, Giuliani stated that the United States and allies would do everything necessary to prevent Iran from going nuclear stating the \\"absolute assurance that we will ‚Äì if they get to the point where they are going to become a nuclear power ‚Äì we will prevent them or we'll set them back five or 10 years. And that is not said as a threat. That should be said as a promise.\\"\\"Lines Harden Over Iran Leader's Visit to US\\", Boston Globe, September 24, 2007. War in Afghanistan Giuliani is a supporter of the War in Afghanistan considering that the war was a response to the September 11 attacks and opposes any time table for U.S. troop withdrawal from Afghanistan. Iraq War Giuliani was a supporter of the Iraq War, later in 2007 Giuliani was described by Newsweek magazine in January 2007 as \\"one of the most consistent cheerleaders for the president's handling of the war in Iraq.\\"More Campaign Troubles for Giuliani ‚Äì Newsweek Politics ‚Äì MSNBC.com Later that year he also supported Bush's surge in the number of U.S. troops in Iraq.

Accessed June 8, 2007. He stated that \\"... we have to remain a country that has the Patriot Act, a country that has electronic surveillance to use to find out about these plots that may be being planned.\\" Israel Giuliani has been considered one of the staunchest supporters of Israel among the candidates. A project created by Haaretz, rated Giuliani as the best candidate for Israel. Giuliani urged NATO to admit Israel, as well as several other nations to help combat terrorism. Waterboarding and interrogation methods Giuliani has supported \\"waterboarding\\" in a situation where \\"we know that there's going to be another attack and these people (terrorists) know about it.\\" He also has stated that defining sleep deprivation as torture is \\"silly.\\" In regards to interrogating terrorists to prevent attack, Giuliani said that he \\"would tell the people who had to do the interrogation to use every method they could think of. It shouldn't be torture, but every method they can think of.\\" United Nations In an October 1, 2001 speech before the United Nations in New York, Mayor Giuliani said that in order for the United Nations to remain relevant, it had to unequivocally oppose terrorism, and now: \\"The United Nations must hold accountable any country that supports or condones terrorism. Otherwise, you will fail in your primary mission as peacekeeper. It must ostracize any nation that supports terrorism. It must isolate any nation that remains neutral in the fight against terrorism.\\" Global warming Giuliani believes that \\"human beings are contributing to\\" global warming. In a December 2007 interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric, he suggested that part of the solution to potential anthropogenic forcing of global warming ‚Äì whilst still maintaining energy security ‚Äì is an increased reliance on coal-burning power plants, combined with the development and deployment of technologies such as \\"clean coal\\" and carbon dioxide geosequestration which could help to make coal less environmentally intensive, and also on nuclear power: > I think the best answer to it is energy independence. We've got more coal > reserves in the U.S. than they have oil reserves in Saudi Arabia. If we find > a way to deal with it and use it so it doesn't hurt the environment, we're > going to find ourselves not contributing to global warming ... I think we > have to take another look at nuclear power. // We haven't had a licensed > nuclear power plant in 30 years. It has to be done carefully. But we haven't > lost a life to nuclear power yet.\\"The Candidates On Climate Change\\", > interview with CBS News anchor Katie Couric, December 11, 2007. Giuliani did not address the fact that coal-generated electricity produces more carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels, and was not asked what specific measures could be taken to reduce the environmental impacts of coal. His Texas-based law firm, Bracewell & Giuliani, is a major lobbyist on behalf of coal-fired power plants and the fossil fuel industry. Commenting on Al Gore's movie, An Inconvenient Truth, Giuliani said he feels that the film did not go far enough to outline what the United States can do to combat global warming.Pajamas Media: Giuliani criticizes Gore for not going far enough on Global Warming (by not offering solutions) Social policy Giuliani has a history of taking positions and making statements that are liberal in aspects of social policy, particularly as relating to abortion, gay and lesbian rights, gun control, illegal immigration and school prayer.John Hawkins, \\"Conservative Case Against Rudy Giuliani,\\" \\"Human Events,\\" August 30, 2006George Marlin, compiler of \\"The Quotable Rudolph Giuliani, as reprinted in The New York Observer, March 29, 2005 http://www.observer.com/node/26855 During the 2008 presidential campaign he has sought to present a more conservative image vis-a-vis abortion, gun rights and illegal immigration.

He was in favor of the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act and the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Giuliani and then-president Bill Clinton exchanged correspondence in 1994 regarding Giuliani's support for the assault weapons ban. Clinton wrote to Giuliani in a May 6, 1994 letter: \\"Thank you very much for your efforts on behalf of H.R. 4296, the assault weapons ban.\\" Clinton continued: > With your support and encouragement, the U.S. House of Representatives took > a critical step toward getting assault weapons off the streets, out of > neighborhoods, and out of the hands of criminals. Clinton further said that he was \\"grateful\\" for Giuliani's \\"dedicated\\" support of the legislation. On May 31, 1994 Giuliani replied, \\"Thank you for your autographed photo and kind note.\\" He added, \\"Please know that you have my continued support for this crucial legislation.\\" An October 13 letter thanked Clinton for a signing pen and said, \\"I look forward to continuing to work with you to reduce crime. ... \\"Carl Campanile, \\"Secret Pen Pols: Rudy & Bill's 'Love' Notes,\\" \\"New York Post,\\" September 24, 2007 http://www.nypost.com/seven/09242007/news/nationalnews/secret_pen_pols.htm He appeared on the Charlie Rose Show in 1995 and compared the National Rifle Association with \\"extremists.\\" He said that the anti-gun control positions of many Republicans are \\"terrible for states and cities.

He also endorsed President Bill Clinton's proposals for more stringent federal gun-licensing requirements, \\"I applaud the President's [Clinton's] proposals, and I will support them any way I can.\\" In the same speech he said, \\"... we may be able to find some sort of meaning in this tragedy [the Empire State Building shooting] by using it as a catalyst to revive national gun control efforts.\\"\\"Mayor Giuliani's War Against Gun Owners,\\" quoting Speech to the Citizens' Crime Commission, March 6, 1997 Beginning in 1997, he regularly criticized states in the Southern United States for having permissive laws on gun sales, that fed an illegal movement of guns into New York City; he said that 60 percent of guns found in New York came from Florida, Georgia, Virginia, and the Carolinas. He endorsed amendments to city laws requiring gun owners to use trigger locks and prohibiting guns within a thousand feet of schools. In a newspaper article, published, March 21, 2000, Giuliani was quoted advocating a mandatory written test for gun owners: \\"I do not think the government should cut off the right to bear arms. My position for many years has been that just as a motorist must have a license, a gun owner should be required to have one as well. Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam that shows that they know how to use a gun, that they're intelligent enough and responsible enough to handle a gun.\\" On June 20, 2000, the City of New York filed a lawsuit against gun manufacturers and distributors. Giuliani accused gun companies of \\"deliberately manufacturing many more firearms than can be bought for the legitimate purposes of hunting and law enforcement.\\" Giuliani also said, \\"This lawsuit is meant to end the free pass that gun industry has enjoyed for a very, very long time. ...

According to Gun Owners of America (GOA), Rudy's position of \\"Disarming citizens because they live in a high crime area is taking away the most effective means of self- defense from the people who need it most. Creating mandatory victims is no way to fight a crime problem.\\" GOA further expressed significant concerns that \\"If Giuliani's gun control agenda was really limited 'only' to big cities, that would be disturbing enough. But the record shows that the Mayor continually tried to export his gun control agenda to the rest of the nation.\\" In a February 2007 Sean Hannity interview, he said that \\"[The right to carry a handgun] is part of the Constitution. People have a right to bear arms,\\" and that while tough gun-control laws were needed in New York City, \\"in another place, more rural, more suburban ... you have a different set of rules.\\" He applauded the March 2007 Parker v. District of Columbia United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit decision that struck down D.C.'s highly restrictive Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975. His campaign officials declined to say whether Giuliani would still support the federal assault weapons ban, the imposition of federal rules on the states, or his claims about Southern states feeding weapons into the North. Giuliani has also stated that decisions regarding concealed carry laws should be left to the states. Illegal drugs During Giuliani's mayoralty he oversaw major crackdowns on illegal drugs, especially marijuana. He also indicated that he will not continue to arrest, prosecute, and imprison patients who use marijuana.Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani Immigration As prosecutor under the Reagan administration in the 1980s, Giuliani defended the administration's position to keep thousands of Haitian refugees in detention centers rather than granting them asylum after they fled the regime of Jean-Claude Duvalier.Giuliani Shifts His Tone on Immigration NY Times, April 22, 2007 Giuliani was a strong defender of illegal immigrants' rights as mayor, fighting for them to be allowed to use public services and attend public schools. But he has changed some of his position on the 2007 campaign trail. As Mayor of New York City, Giuliani encouraged hardworking illegal immigrants to move to New York City. New York Officials Welcome Immigrants, Legal or Illegal NY Times, June 10, 1994 He said: > Some of the hardest-working and most productive people in this city are > undocumented aliens.

You're somebody that we want to protect, and we want you to get out > from under what is often a life of being like a fugitive, which is really > unfair. He pressed for $12 million to start a city agency which would help immigrants gain citizenship. He defended the city's policy of not allowing police and hospital workers to ask about citizenship status. In 1996, Giuliani said, \\"Indeed, the whole process of immigration is something the Republican Party should embrace.\\"Conference on the New Immigrants, September 30, 1996 NYC.gov In the same year, at a public talk at the John F.

Retrieved November 16, 2007 In 1997, Giuliani signed a statement of principles which read, \\"The new laws recently passed by Congress and signed into law by the President unfairly target immigrants in the United States by severely limiting their access to many federal benefits which citizens are entitled to receive.\\" and \\"Since legal immigrants work and pay taxes like American citizens, they should be entitled to temporary assistance when they fall into personal difficulty. Furthermore, the denial of federal assistance to legal immigrants in need is patently unfair and arguably unconstitutional and inhumane.\\" In 1998, Giuliani argued for expanding Medicare, SSI and foodstamp benefits to legal immigrants and also, \\"Providing full Medicaid coverage to Prucol aliens with HIV/AIDS and other chronic illnesses\\" In April 2006, Giuliani went on the record as favoring the US Senate's comprehensive immigration plan which includes a path to citizenship and a guest worker plan. He rejected the US House approach because he does not think House Resolution 4437 could be enforced. http://daily.nysun.com/Repository/getmailfiles.asp?Style=OliveXLib:ArticleToMail&Type;=text/html&Path;=NYS/2006/04/27&ID;=Ar00202 In February 2007, in a meeting with California Republicans, Giuliani was quoted as saying \\"We need a [border] fence, and a highly technological one.\\" Giuliani also reiterated his support for some sort of path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants after a process to be determined, but added that at the end of the process the immigrants should \\"display the ability to read and write English\\" and must assimilate into American society. In 2000, Giuliani said, \\"I wish that we would actually make America more open to immigrants.\\" He does not believe in deportation of illegal immigrants and advocates a \\"tamper- proof\\" national ID card and database for illegal immigrants. On September 7, 2007, during a CNN interview, he said that illegal immigrants are not criminals.Michael D. Shear, \\"Giuliani Says Illegal Immigrants Are Not Criminals\\" \\"Associated Press\\" http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the- trail/2007/09/07/post_66.html On the topic of legal immigration, in June 2007 Giuliani rejected Tom Tancredo's calls for a temporary stop of legal immigration. Giuliani stated: \\"We should always be open to legal immigration.\\"Transcript Third G.O.P. Debate on New York Times accessed at December 24, 2007 In September 2007, Giuliani affirmed that legal immigration should be increased. In 2018, working as President Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani disagreed with the Trump administration's separation of children from their parents, and he publicly supported \\"a pathway to citizenship for most of the millions of undocumented immigrants already living in the United States.\\" Giuliani said that a comprehensive immigration bill would solve the border crises, and noted his record of supporting a pathway to citizenship in the past. Judicial philosophy His philosophy initially appeared moderate, but became increasingly conservative during the early stages of his presidential campaign in 2008. In a July 2005 appearance on Hannity & Colmes, Giuliani stated that having justices appointed with similar views on abortion to his own was \\"not the critical factor.\\" He further stated that \\"what's important ... is to have a very intelligent, very honest, very good lawyer on the court. And [John Roberts] fits that category, in the same way Justice Ginsburg fit that category. I mean, she was ‚Äì she maybe came at it from a very different political background, very qualified lawyer, very smart person. Lots of Republicans supported her.\\" In 2006, on numerous occasions, he has stated thoughtful well educated judges whether liberal or conservative would be what he would appoint. He would not hold any political philosophy as a litmus test. But in a February 2007 interview with Hannity, Giuliani said he would nominate Supreme Court justices who are \\"very similar, if not exactly the same as,\\" John Roberts and Samuel Alito. In a February 2007 interview with Hugh Hewitt, Giuliani mentioned those two as well as Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas as models, and said that former Solicitor General Theodore Olson would possibly be one of his primary advisers in selecting judges on lower federal courts as well as Supreme Court justices. He further stated that abortion would still not be a litmus test and such views would not even be asked of any prospective nominee. On July 17, 2007, at a campaign rally in Iowa, Giuliani stated that he would appoint judges like Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia (not mentioning the very slightly less conservative Roberts, Alito, or Kennedy) for the Supreme Court but abortion would still not be a litmus test either way. LGBT issues During Giuliani's mayoralty of New York City, gay and lesbian residents asked for domestic partnership rights. Giuliani, in turn, pushed the city's Democratic-controlled City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for same-sex partners.Rudy Giuliani's gay friends \\"Fulfilling a promise made to the Pride Agenda in October 1997, on July 7 Mayor Rudolph Giuliani signed into law historic legislation broadly extending recognition of domestic partners in New York City.\\" In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners. For this reform, the Empire State Pride Agenda, an LGBT political advocacy group, hailed this law as establishing \\"a new national benchmark for domestic partner recognition.\\"Sager, Ryan. \\"Latest Politics: Giuliani's Startling Departure,\\" \\"New York Sun,\\" April 27, 2007 http://www.nysunpolitics.com/article/30 During his aborted 2000 run for office in the U.S. Senate, Giuliani declared: \\"The institution of marriage should remain defined as a man and a woman.\\"Eric Boehlert, \\"What Will Rudy Say to His Gay Friends?,\\" salon.com February 26, 2007 In 2003, Giuliani discussed his support for civil unions, which he said were the same as domestic partnerships. Giuliani said: > Marriage should be a man and a woman ... I think that the domestic > partnership legislation in NY has worked very, very well. I think that's a > good way to deal with it, and I think that would be a good model for other > states to have. Some places call them domestic partnerships, some states > call it civil unions, and I think that would be the best way to deal with > it. In a 2004 interview with Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, Giuliani said, \\"I'm in favor of ... civil unions.\\" On NBC's \\"Meet the Press\\", also in 2004, Giuliani stated that he would oppose the federal ban on gay marriage. In an April 27, 2007 New York Sun story, Ryan Sager stated that Giuliani made a \\"departure from his previously stated position on civil unions\\" when his campaign wrote: > Mayor Giuliani believes marriage is between one man and one woman. Domestic > partnerships are the appropriate way to ensure that people are treated > fairly. In this specific case the law states same sex civil unions are the > equivalent of marriage and recognizes same sex unions from outside states. > This goes too far and Mayor Giuliani does not support it. Michael Long, chairman of the Conservative Party of New York stated, \\"I just don't see Rudy Giuliani being able to sway conservatives within the Republican Party.

In fact, I don't even agree with myself on everything.\\" \\"There's not a candidate with a clean skirt out there.

We see only the oppressive side of authority. Maybe it comes out of our history and our background. What we don't see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want, be anything they can be. Freedom is about authority. Freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do. You have free speech so I can be heard.\\" Giuliani in a March 1994 speech on crime at a forum in New York City sponsored by the New York Post as quoted by The New York Times Giuliani has expressed that he believes the President has the authority to arrest U.S. citizens with no judicial review, but that \\"he would want to use this authority infrequently\\".

The station is owned by Forever Broadcasting, and broadcasts from the Downtown Mall in Meadville. History=Beginnings as WVEN-FM This station debuted on 99.3 as WVEN-FM on March 5, 1971, as a partial simulcast of AM affiliate WFRA, with occasional break-aways for its own original programming that closely mirrored WFRA, usually during periods of the broadcast day when WFRA offered talk and news-intensive programming. As more and more cars became equipped with FM radios, the two radio stations broke away from each other and became completely separate programming operations, though WVEN would recapture the call letters of its sister AM station in 1989. For many years, WVEN was known as \\"Mix 99.3\\", boasting an Adult CHR format with full-service local elements. WXMJ 104.5 made its debut on November 21, 1996 as WAQM. This station was sold in July 2000 by MacBeth Communications to Forever Broadcasting. Macbeth Communications was a company owned by Thom Sauber, the son of Robert H. Sauber, WFRA's founder. Also in July 2000, Bob Sauber, whose son Tom managed WFRA-AM/FM in addition to his own WAQM, wanted to retire and put his stations up for sale. All three (Sauber also owned WTIV in Titusville, the first of the group) were purchased by Altoona-based Forever Broadcasting, LLC for an undisclosed sum. Sauber died in October 2004 at the age of 72. The 2000s After being acquired by Forever Broadcasting, the stations became \\"Today's Best Music: 99.3 and 104.5 The All-New Kiss FM\\" in November 2000. Kiss FM aired a Hot Adult Contemporary format from 5am-6pm, and a cross between CHR and Hot AC in the evening hours. In typical Forever Broadcasting fashion, it took many years for the \\"all new\\" imaging to be dropped. It finally was dropped in January 2006, only 21 months before the station would flip formats to the jockless \\"Majic.\\" The call letters used during the Kiss FM era were WOXX for the 99.3 signal and WXXO for the 104.5 signal. 99.3 and 104.5 KISS FM Throughout its run as Kiss FM, the station was known in the community for the Kiss FM Sunday Night Dance Parties held in Conneaut Lake held during the summer months. With studios originally in Franklin, later moving to Meadville, the sense of community the station fostered was second to none. Weekly live broadcasts brought station personalities and community members together. The station had a very large staff of on air personalities with names such as \\"Ted Bear\\" (who was legendary Northwest Pennsylvania broadcaster Todd Adkins in disguise) \\"Drew Love\\" and \\"Cupid.\\" All airshifts were live and local, and many radio personalities got their start at this once legendary station. Callers dedicated \\"Goodnight Kisses\\" each evening at 10pm, and overnight host \\"Jason Valentine\\" connected with many listeners with outrageous radio games and stunts. It was local small market radio at is absolute best, and was a textbook training ground for new talent. Program Director Todd Adkins took pride in his station and was always a caring man to his staff, encouraging them to grow and develop their on air talent. Mascot Tookie the Toucan greeted Northwest Pennsylvanians at numerous public and community events and appearances. The 24-hour live, local airstaff provided great local radio and content from 2000-2006. The final year and a half of the station brought the loss of 24/7 live disc jockeys, automation, and what would eventually be the beginning of the end of the golden era of Kiss FM. This coincided with the move of the studio from Franklin to Meadville, where it joined the other stations in the Forever cluster. General Manager Jim Shields did not see a need to staff the station as much, as he saw more money being spent on a staff who cared deeply for local radio an unnecessary burden. In late 2006, legendary Program Director Todd Adkins was let go after more than 20 years with the station, and the writing was then on the wall. Personalities such as Tyrel and Brett Hart took on air positions in a different market and were replaced by voicetracking and glitchy automation that rarely worked. From March 2006 to October 2007, the station went from a 24/7 live and local airstaff made up of 8 local on air personalities (including the then program director) and one off-air board operator to one off-air program director who had other duties within the company. A true sign of the sad state of corporate radio and a sad reminder of the once great station that Northwest Pennsylvanians no longer have in their community. Special programming features during the Kiss FM tenure included the Top 9 at 9, Goodnight Kisses, the Kiss Cafe, Kiss Cartunes, Kiss It Or Diss It, and more recently the 5:00 Traffic Jam, 4 Play at 4, The Jammin' Saturday Night Kiss Party, and the Back In The Day Buffet. Hourly \\"Kiss In The Community\\" updates provided listeners with community event information and a chance for community members to have their message heard on local radio. All of these features made the station a local treasure and invaluable resource that is now gone from the Meadville, Franklin, and Oil City communities; replaced by a cheap automated radio station known as \\"Majic\\" that has eliminated jobs and does not offer listeners and community members the overall experience that Kiss FM did for many years. Throughout its run as Kiss FM (and even dating back to the Mix 99.3 days) legendary countdown host Casey Kasem's shows were always carried on the station. Other syndication throughout Kiss FM's reign included Backtrax USA with Kid Kelly and Saturday Night 80's. Even with these syndicated shows airing on weekend mornings and evenings, the station still staffed young, upcoming radio talent to run the board. Now, all programming is done without a staff as the current \\"Majic\\" incarnation of the station. Majic 99.3 and 104.5 At 5pm on October 10, 2007, the stations flipped to \\"Majic\\" 99.3 and 104.5\\". From 5pm on October 10 through 6am October 12, the station went jockless, airing Majic teaser sweepers but still playing the Kiss FM playlist. At 6am on Friday October 12, the station officially kicked off with a Variety Hits format. The last song heard as Kiss FM was \\"Makes Me Wonder\\" by Maroon 5. The first song of the new Majic format was \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\" by Twisted Sister. The entire airstaff was let go or reassigned to other stations in the cluster. This move left Northwest Pennsylvania radio without an outlet for hit music for the first time since the 1970s. In April 2012, Majic phased out the Variety Hits format, keeping the \\"Majic\\" moniker and jockless presentation, but re-adapting a Similar Hot AC/Adult Top 40 format that was found during the station's days as Kiss FM. The Majic slogan debuted as \\"We Play Anything\\" but quickly switched to \\"We Play It All\\" due to nearby 94.7 Bob FM in Erie having the copyright for the former. With the April 2012 format tweak, the current slogan is \\"All The Hits\\", making WXBB the de facto adult hits station for Cambridge Springs and WRRK the de facto adult hits station for Franklin albeit far away. In 2016 the slogan changed back to ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Best Music‚Äù, coming full circle from dropping exactly the same slogan during the 2007 Kiss FM to Majic format flip. As of September 2018, the slogan remains ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs Best Music‚Äù When the station was a Hot AC format as \\"Kiss FM\\" it boasted a large staff of live and local on air personalities. Until 2006, the station had a live personality in studio 24/7, even during the syndicated shows \\"American Top 20 with Casey Kasem\\" and \\"Saturday Night 80s.\\" Voicetracking was occasionally used, but a live in studio board-op was always present. Now as Majic, the station is automated 24/7 and the studio is unmanned. The station airs the syndicated Dave and Jimmy morning show out of WNCI Columbus and the syndicated Zach Sang show in the evenings.

He has won four Mann Cups, two with each of the Chiefs and Excelsiors. National Lacrosse League=Albany Attack/San Jose Stealth Miller started his career in 2001 with the Albany Attack (renamed the San Jose Stealth after the team relocated to California). He spent the early part of his career backing up Rob Blasdell and Anthony Cosmo, before joining the Chicago Shamrox and earning a spot as their starting goaltender. Chicago Shamrox Chicago selected Miller first overall after San Jose left him unprotected in the 2006 expansion draft (when Chicago and the New York Titans joined the league).\\"Miller Selected First By Chicago\\" http://nll.com/article.php?id=374 At the 2007 All- Star Game in Portland, Miller was named to the All-Star team for the first time, as a reserve for the East squad. He split time with Matt Roik, allowing eight goals on 34 shots to earn the win. He also assisted on one of the East team's 20 goals.\\"East Team Stats\\" http://www.pointstreak.com/prostats/teamplayerstats.html?teamid=73569&seasonid;=1708 Despite Miller's stalwart play in net - 557 saves, facing an average of 45.19 shots per game - the Shamrox scored the third-fewest goals in the league in 2007, and missed the playoffs with a 6-10 record. Philadelphia Wings Midway through the 2008 season with the Shamrox struggling, Miller was dealt to the Philadelphia Wings for Roik and defenseman Brad Self.\\"Wings acquire forward AJ Shannon and Goaltender Brandon Miller\\" In 2008, Philadelphia finished 10-6, and qualified as the fourth seed for the playoffs; the Shamrox finished 6-10, in last place in the East Division. The Wings took on the Buffalo Bandits in the first round of the playoffs, but were eliminated after a 14-12 loss. Miller replaced starting goaltender Rob Blasdell for the second half of the game, allowing five goals on 21 shots and picking up the loss. Miller split time with Blasdell again in 2009, his first full season with Philadelphia. Miller played about 60 per cent of the team's minutes, registering an 11.90 GAA and 76.94% save percentage. He also contributed offensively, registered six points - including a goal on March 28, 2009, against the Colorado Mammoth.\\"Colorado-Philadelphia, March 28, 2009\\" http://www.nll.com/stats.php?ps=http://nll.stats.pointstreak.com/boxscore.html?gameid=795810 The team, however, struggled, finishing the season 7-9 and missing the playoffs. Philadelphia again missed the playoffs in 2010, finishing last in the East division with a 5-11 record. Miller earned the lion's share of the playing time (a career-high 885 minutes), and as a result, faced the most shots in the league (764) and made the second-most saves (581). Offensively, he contributed 9 assists, good for second in the league behind Cosmo's 13. Miller had, perhaps, his best statistical season in 2011. He posted career bests with an 11.25 goals against average and .774 save percentage. The team was plagued by a lack of goal scoring, though, finishing with a league-worst 143 goals for, finishing 5-11, tied for last in the league. Miller was selected for the All-Star game for the second time in his career. The Wings made the playoffs in 2012 and again in 2013, but, unfortunately, were knocked out in the first round both years. In 2013, Miller finished second in Goaltender of the Year voting, behind Rochester's Matt Vinc. He finished fifth in saves for the season, and crossed the 4000-save mark for his career, becoming the 10th goaltender to achieve the mark. He was also named Defensive Player of the Week three times during the season, and was named to the Second All-Pro Team. Toronto Rock On March 18, 2014, Miller was traded to the Toronto Rock for Kyle Belton, a conditional 2nd-round draft choice and a 4th- round draft choice in the 2014 NLL draft. The Rock finished the season 9-9 and qualified for the playoffs, but were eliminated in the first round. The 2015 season saw Miller split time with Nick Rose; Rose and Miller finished 3rd and 4th, respectively, in the league in Goals Against Average. The Rock finished with a league-best 14-4 record, and allowed the 3rd-fewest goals in the league. Miller was a finalist for the Goaltender of the Year Award and made his first trip to the finals, where the Rock were beaten 2 games to 0 in the Best-of-3 series by the Edmonton Rush. In 2016, Miller became just the seventh NLL goalie to register 5,000 career regular season saves. On September 25, 2018, Miller announced his retirement as a player.

In 2000, he shared the Dean McLeod Award - awarded to the MVP of the OLA Junior A playoffs - with Matt Vinc, as well as the Robert Melville Memorial Trophy - awarded to the Junior A league's outstanding goaltender - which he shared with teammate Kevin Samuel.\\"The Dean McLeod Award\\" http://www.ontariolacrosse.com/documents/content_1286.pdf Brampton Excelsiors In the NLL's off-season, Miller competes in the Ontario Lacrosse Association's Major Series. Miller competed for the Brampton Excelsiors until 2011. He joined the team in 2001, helping them to a Mann Cup appearance, where they were beaten in seven games by the Coquitlam Adanacs. In 2002, he teamed again with Bob Watson in goal, and this time helped Brampton to a Mann Cup win over the Victoria Shamrocks, again in seven games, their second Mann Cup in five years. They lost just one game in the MSL playoffs on the way to the championship game, sweeping the St. Catharines Athletics and defeating the Brooklin Redmen four games to one. The Excelsiors made a third consecutive Mann Cup appearance in 2003, again against the Shamrocks, but were unable to repeat as champions, losing in five games. From 2004 to 2007, Miller and the Excelsiors were defeated in the MSL finals by the Peterborough Lakers, twice in seven games and twice in six games.\\"MSL History\\" http://www.majorserieslacrosse.net/mslhistory.html In 2008, the Excelsiors were finally able to overcome Peterborough, winning a decisive seventh game 7-2 at home in Brampton. They were easily able to overcome the New Westminster Salmonbellies in four games, although Miller saw no action as he backed up eventual Mann Cup MVP Anthony Cosmo. While with the Excelsiors, he was a three-time recipient of the Harry Lumley Trophy - awarded to the goaltenders of the team that allowed the fewest goals in the regular season. In 2002, he shared the award with Bob Watson, and in 2007 and 2008, he and Cosmo received the award.\\"The Harry Lumley Trophy\\" http://www.ontariolacrosse.com/documents/content_1273.pdf Six Nations Chiefs He joined the Chiefs via trade from the Brampton Excelsiors; he and Rory Smith joined Six Nations in exchange for Matt Vinc, Mike Accursi, Tim O'Brien, and a 2013 first round selection. Backing up, primarily, Orangeville native Evan Kirk, Miller has compiled a 3-1 record with a 9.05 GAA in 12 games over two seasons. In 2013, the Chiefs represented the OLA in the Mann Cup, against the Victoria Shamrocks. Miller did not appear in the first two games, but replaced Kirk in the third game, with the series tied. Miller suffered the loss, but Six Nations stormed back to take the series in six games, with Miller in goal for all but 20 minutes. Those 20 minutes occurred in Game 5 when Victoria asked officials to check Miller's equipment, which was deemed to be illegal, resulting in a minor penalty and a game misconduct. Kirk replaced him, but he, too, had his equipment deemed illegal, resulting in forward Colin Doyle settling into net for the final 11 minutes of the 11-7 win. Miller finished the series with a minuscule 4.45 GAA and .893 save percentage, ironically besting Shamrocks keeper Matt Vinc. The victory marked the first for the Chiefs since winning their third consecutive in 1996. Following the 2014 season, Miller won his fourth Harry Lumley Trophy, sharing the award with Kirk. The Chiefs repeated as Mann Cup Champions, and Miller was awarded the Mike Kelley Memorial Trophy as the series MVP.

Meyers Bridge (also known as the Eighth Street Bridge and unsigned as SR 2055) is a reinforced concrete open-spandrel arch bridge located in Allentown, Pennsylvania, in the United States. When opened for traffic on November 17, 1913, the Albertus L. Meyers Bridge, then known as the Eighth Street Bridge, was the longest and highest concrete bridge in the world. The bridge spans the Little Lehigh Creek, linking Allentown's center city with the city's South Side. The bridge has seventeen spans and is longer than the more massive Tunkhannock Viaduct of the same type. History The Lehigh Valley Transit Company organized the Allentown Bridge Company in 1911 for the sole purpose of building the bridge. The bridge was designed by the engineering firm of B.H. Davis and built by McArthur Brothers of New York City. Costing in excess of $500,000, construction of the bridge required of concrete and of metal reinforcing rods. The structure operated as a toll bridge from its November 17, 1913, opening until the 1950s, at which time the toll was five cents for an automobile. The Liberty Bell Line, Lehigh Valley Transit's electric street car line that went to Quakertown, Sellersville, Lansdale, Norristown and Philadelphia ran across the bridge until that interurban service made its last run on the evening of September 6, 1951. On the final return trip from Norristown, in the early morning hours of September 7, car #1006 did not cross the bridge again but went directly to Fairview carbarn, located some distance southwest of the bridge. All rail operations across the bridge ended when the company ceased street trolley service in 1953. The concrete standards that once supported the trolley wire are still standing on the bridge to this day. Formal naming The Eighth Street Bridge was formally renamed the Albertus L. Meyers Bridge in 1974. Albertus L. Meyers was a well-known conductor of the Allentown Band and a cornet player in the band of John Philip Sousa. As a boy, Meyers played in the Allentown Band at the opening of this bridge that now bears his name. The Albertus L. Meyers Bridge was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 1988. Note: This includes Suicides In the Lehigh Valley area, the phrase \\"I'm going to jump off the Eighth Street Bridge\\" is used variously and kiddingly when facing a seemingly insurmountable challenge or challenges. \\"Remain Calm,\\" TheMorningCall.com, September 29, 2008. However, like many metropolitan bridges, because of the bridge's height and proximity to a large city population, it has been and continues to be the site of numerous actual suicides. Since 1913 the bridge has had about 80 documented suicides and an unknown amount of suicide attempts.\\"BRIDGE OF DESPAIR: Eighth Street bridge scene of nearly 80 suicides,\\" TheMorningCall.com, May 6, 2012. This has prompted the city to consider adding barriers to make jumping more difficult. These suicides have become a part of the local culture, with claims of ghost sightings on the bridge and a variety of unauthorized makeshift memorials underneath it.

For a specific wavevector, the frequency (and thus the energy) of the associated phonon is considerably lowered, and there is a discontinuity in its derivative. They have been first proposed by Walter Kohn in 1959. In extreme cases (that can happen in low-dimensional materials), the energy of this phonon is zero, meaning that a static distortion of the lattice appears. This is one explanation for charge density waves in solids. The wavevectors at which a Kohn anomaly is possible are the nesting vectors of the Fermi surface, that is vectors that connect a lot of points of the Fermi surface (for a one- dimensional chain of atoms this vector would be 2k_{\\\\rm F}). The electron phonon interaction causes a rigid shift of the Fermi sphere and a failure of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation since the electrons do not follow any more the ionic motion adiabatically. In the phononic spectrum of a metal, a Kohn anomaly is a discontinuity in the derivative of the dispersion relation that occurs at certain high symmetry points of the first Brillouin zone, produced by the abrupt change in the screening of lattice vibrations by conduction electrons. Kohn anomalies arise together with Friedel oscillations when one considers the Lindhard approximation instead of the Thomas‚ÄìFermi approximation in order to find an expression for the dielectric function of a homogeneous electron gas. The expression for the real part \\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\varepsilon (\\\\mathbf{q}, \\\\omega)) of the reciprocal space dielectric function obtained following the Lindhard theory includes a logarithmic term that is singular at \\\\mathbf{q} = 2\\\\mathbf{k}_{\\\\rm F} , where \\\\mathbf{k}_{\\\\rm F} is the Fermi wavevector. Although this singularity is quite small in reciprocal space, if one takes the Fourier transform and passes into real space, the Gibbs phenomenon causes a strong oscillation of \\\\operatorname{Re}(\\\\varepsilon (\\\\mathbf{r}, \\\\omega)) in the proximity of the singularity mentioned above. In the context of phonon dispersion relations, these oscillations appear as a vertical tangent in the plot of \\\\omega ^2(\\\\mathbf{q}) , called the Kohn anomalies. Many different systems exhibit Kohn anomalies, including graphene,S. Piscanec, M. Lazzeri, F. Mauri, A. C. Ferrari, and J. Robertson, Kohn Anomalies and Electron-Phonon Interactions in Graphite, Phys. Rev. Lett., 93, 185503 (2004) bulk metals,D. A. Stewart, Ab initio investigation of phonon dispersion and anomalies in palladium, New J. Phys., 10, 043025 (2008) Open Access article and many low-dimensional systems (the reason involves the condition \\\\mathbf{q} = 2 \\\\mathbf{k}_{\\\\rm F} , which depends on the topology of the Fermi surface). However, it is important to emphasize that only materials showing metallic behaviour can exhibit a Kohn anomaly, as we are dealing with approximations that need a homogeneous electron gas.R. M.

The court commenced on 18 January 1988. History The treatment of juvenile offenders in the colony of New South Wales reflected the system of criminal law inherited from the United Kingdom. The law of Australia at that time was heavily influenced by the social norms of English society. As a result, children criminals were treated no differently from adult criminals. They were liable to the same harsh penalties. The Judicial Commission of New South Wales cited an example of one English judge who, after condemning a 10-year-old boy to death, described the boy as \\"a proper subject for capital punishment\\". The Commission also noted that on one day in 1815, five children aged between eight and 12 years were hanged for petty larceny in England. The first children's court was established under the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders Act 1905. The Judicial Commission of New South Wales stated the first court was set up in the spirit of parens patriae, a jurisdiction that was exercised by the superior courts of the United Kingdom and as a consequence, of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The court was set up in light of the widespread poverty and child neglect at that time. The courts had to assume the role of parent, protector, and ultimate punisher. The present children's court is constituted under the . The Court is an inferior court and is effectively a court of record. The court was established on 18 January 1988. Composition The court is composed of magistrates of the Local Court of New South Wales who are appointed by the Chief Magistrate of the Local Court of New South Wales. A magistrate so appointed is called a Children's Magistrate. The Governor appoints a qualified person to be the President of the Children's Court. Any judge of the District Court is a qualified person and may be appointment as the President of the Children's Court for a duration not exceeding 5 years. After the expiry of the initial term of the appointed, the Governor may re-appoint the same person for another term, or to appoint another judge of the District Court as the President of the Children's Court. It is significant that the orders (other than interim orders) made by the President may be appealed to the Supreme Court, while the orders made by the Children's Magistrate may be appealed to the District Court only. The President of the Children's Court administers the court, arranges sittings of the Court, and convenes meetings of Children's Magistrates. The President of the Children's Court also confers regularly with community groups and social agencies on matters involving children and the Court. Jurisdiction The court exercises criminal jurisdiction under the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987.

It entered into force in 1958 and as of 2013 it has 74 state parties. Background Before the Convention on the Nationality of Married Women, no legislation existed to protect married women's right to retain or renounce national citizenship in the way that men could. Women's rights groups recognized a need to legally protect the citizenship rights of women who married someone from outside their country or nationality. The League of Nations, the international organization later succeeded by the United Nations, was lobbied by women's rights groups during the early 20th century to address the lack of international laws recognizing married women's rights of national citizenship. The Conference for the Codification of International Law, held at The Hague in 1930, drew protests from international women's rights groups, yet the League declined to include legislation enforcing married women's nationality rights. The League took the position that it was not their role, but the role of member states, to deal with equality between men and women. The International Women's Suffrage Alliance (IWSA, later renamed the International Alliance of Women) launched a telegram campaign in 1931 to pressure the League of Nations to address the lack of legislation. Women from around the world sent telegrams to the League of Nations as a protest. The League made the concession of creating an unfunded Consultative Committee on Nationality of Women. The Pan- American Conference in Montevideo passed a Convention on the Nationality of Women in 1933. It was passed by the Pan American Conference at the same time as the Treaty on the Equality of Rights Between Men and Women. These were the first pieces of international law to \\"explicitly set sexual equality as a principle to be incorporated into national legislation\\" which was required of countries ratifying the convention and treaty. Lobbying by the American National Women's Party has been credited with this legislation. However, neither the International Labour Organization (ILO) nor the League of Nations passed any legislation on the issue during the interwar years. Entry into force The issue of the nationality of married women was a leading women's rights issue facing the United Nations after its establishment. The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women was created, and made it a priority of their agenda, launching a study in 1948. The Commission recommended to the United Nations Economic and Social Council that legislation be drafted to give women equal rights as set out in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Convention on the Nationality of Married Women entered into force on 11 August 1958. As of 2013, the convention has been ratified by 74 states. It has been denounced by the ratifying states of Luxembourg, Netherlands, and United Kingdom. Purpose The Convention was concluded in the light of the conflicts of law on nationality derived from provisions concerning the loss or acquisition of nationality by women as a result of marriage, divorce, or of the change of nationality by the husband during marriage. It allows women to adopt the nationality of their husband based upon the woman's own decision, but does not require it. The Convention seeks to fulfill aspirations articulated in Article 15 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that 'everyone has a right to a nationality' and 'no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his nationality nor denied the right to change his nationality'. Key principles > Article 1 * Woman's nationality not to be automatically affected by marriage > to an alien. Article 2 * Acquisition or renunciation of a nationality by a > husband not to prevent the wife's retention of her nationality.

Its high latitude, elevation and distance from larger foreign and domestic population centers has defined Otago at each stage of its history. New Zealand's ecology had evolved in near isolation from the rest of the world for 85 million years. At first settlement it was almost devoid of land mammals. The fauna was very susceptible to land predators. Humans burnt the forests, ate the animals and introduced numerous predators and exotic plants to Otago. This came in two great waves around the years 1300 and 1800, although the effects of both introductions would continue for centuries. This was followed by intensive farming and alteration to the rivers and lakes of Otago for water and electricity production. The human occupation of Otago begins around the year 1300 with the arrival of MƒÅori soon after they settled in New Zealand. The MƒÅori were originally from tropical Polynesia; they continually adapted to the new and changing environment over the next 500 years. At that time the first European sealers and whalers arrived, followed by the founding of the colony of Dunedin, Otago's first city in 1848. Until the late 19th century the vast majority of permanent settlements in Otago were on the eastern coast, which was rich in resources and has a more temperate climate. During this time inland Otago was largely used seasonally and for its mineral deposits, first by the MƒÅori digging for pounamu stone, then European settlers searching for gold. With the advent of the railway, and refrigerated trade with Britain, inland Otago became more consistently productive. Rapid urbanisation has led to the creation of main population centers on the flatter eastern coast and in the high inland plains between the mountain ranges. This has been accompanied with immense social change in Otago's population, similar but distinct to the rest of New Zealand. The boundaries of Otago have changed over time. However, the Waitaki River, currently Otago's northern extent, has often been used as a natural border. NgƒÅi Tahu, the dominant Maori tribe in the region, currently has three r≈´nanga (sub-tribes) within Otago and their traditional extent is not limited to the region. Today Otago is divided into the Central Otago, Clutha, Queenstown-Lakes and Waitaki (partly in Canterbury) Districts, and the city of Dunedin, which has half the region's population. It excludes the Southland plains, Stewart Island and Fiordland, although the historical province of Otago and much older Murihiku region often included them.  The first settlements till the Treaty of Waitangi (1300‚Äì1840) = Initial MƒÅori settlement (1300‚Äì1500)  The precise date at which the first inhabitants of New Zealand reached Otago and the extreme south (known to later MƒÅori as Murihiku) remains uncertain. MƒÅori descend from a race of Polynesian sea-wanderers who, moved from East Asia and south-east Asia to the islands of the Pacific. Tradition tells of their further journeyings from Hawaiki to New Zealand, and some commentators have identified this homeland as Havai'i, Vikings of the Sunrise, Peter H. Buck, p.65 an island in the Society Group. Overpopulation, scarcity of food and civil war forced many of them to migrate once more, and New Zealand became their new home. MƒÅori settled New Zealand between 1280‚Äì1320. They quickly learnt to hunt the numerous species of moa and seals in New Zealand and settled across the North and South islands in less than a few decades. There is a change in the pollen record from inland Otago from 600 years ago from a forest to bracken flora. It has been inferred that this relates to fires being lit during Maori exploration. The first parts of New Zealand settled by Polynesians were the very far north and the east coast of the South Island where population was initially concentrated.Anderson 1998; Hamel 2001 Later the contraction of food sources led to depopulation in the south while the introduction of the kumara led to an expansion in the North Island and the evolution of a different material and social culture. The greater numbers in the North Island led to migrations to the south from late in the sixteenth century.Anderson, 1983, McLintock, 1949, Hamel 2001.left Tradition speaks of the first inhabitants of the South Island as the Kahui Tipua, a tribe associated with many weird tales and whose members the tales generally classed as supernatural beings, the \\"Band of Ogres\\". After these fearsome people came another tribe named Te Rapuwai which has also left very few traces, perhaps because, as Waite suggests, no MƒÅori claim descent from them.South Island Maoris, J.W. Stack p.15. On the other hand, Anderson has suggested these are names of earlier assimilated groups whose descendants are still with us but have been re-categorised under the names \\"Waitaha\\" and \\"Kati Mamoe\\" as Kai Tahu have since claimed those groups as integral to a new one, that known now, in modern standard MƒÅori, as \\"NgƒÅi Tahu\\".Anderson, 1998. But Te Rapuwai left many place names to record their presence, and heaps of shells along the beaches as more tangible evidence. The Kaitangata Lake district, in South Otago, was apparently a favourite haunt, and almost certainly there were settlements at the mouth of the Matau (Clutha). Researchers know almost as little of the immediate successors of Te Rapuwai, the Waitaha. Hector suggested that another tribe, the Katikura, an offshoot of the Ngapuhi tribe of Tamaki Makarau, lived in Otago at some remote period before the arrival of the Waitaha. But beyond a vague tradition that they burnt off the forest and made the open grassland (E Waka-Papihi), no information survives concerning them. Waite, op. cit., p.29 According to the lore of North Island MƒÅori, the Waitaha people arrived in the Takitimu canoe captained by Tamatea. The Takitimu, legendarily associated with the discredited theory of a great fleet dated to 1350 AD, made its landfall in the Bay of Plenty and then sailed down the coast of both islands, even as far as the Waiau River in Southland, leaving settlers at suitable districts. This voyage of Tamatea became so important a landmark in post-pƒÅkehƒÅ conceptions of MƒÅori history that the antiquity of any event, such as the great fires which destroyed the forests of Otago and Southland, have been indicated by saying, \\"That happened in the time of Tamatea.\\" Stack, one of those who developed this now contested conception, portrayed the Waitaha occupation of Te Wahipounamu as covering a century, from 1477 to 1577, South Island Maoris, J.W. Stack, Volume Ten, p.60 a calculation based on the assumption of twenty years to a generation. His conception of what was happening is probably wrong, but his dating, taken broadly is probably about right for this later settlement phase, which may indeed be that of the historical Waitaha. The estuaries, mudflats, sandy beaches of Murihiku provided fish, seals, seabirds, mussels, pauas, pipis and cockles. The dense podocarp forest, including matai, totara, kahikatea, and rimu, teemed with wekas, tuis, pigeons, and other birds. In the coastal lakes such as Waihola, eels abounded. At some point during the first centuries of occupation they discovered pounamu. Thus the South Island also became known as Te Wahipounamu. The southern MƒÅori moved with the seasons to exploit the rich resources of Murihiku. Tradition attributed to the Waitaha a profound knowledge of incantations (karakia) and of the science of navigation. They painted designs in caves and named many of the distinctive features of the Otago landscape, well illustrated in the tale of RƒÅkaihaut≈´, known the great digger of lakes. Rakaihautu, The Great Digger of Lakes, H. Beattie, Vol.27, p.142 The Waitaha settlement of the South Island seems to have been the latter part of a period of peace and plenty. Stack said that \\"they increased and multiplied so rapidly that they are described as having covered the face of the land like ants\\". South Island Maoris, J.W. Stack p.23 A more credible explanation might be that, on the arrival of the first Waitaha wave in the south, they found it an abundant land and, under such favourable conditions, their numbers greatly increased. However this time of prosperity was not to last. Already, by the end of the fourteenth century New Zealand's environment was beginning to change. The climate became cooler, the podocarp forest retreated, and the moa population began to decline. The changing environment affected those who relied upon moas and seals for food and forced them to develop more effective techniques for catching birds and fish. The largest settlements of the early centuries lost their importance and declined. The population declined because of emigration north to regions where one could cultivate kumara (sweet potatoes). Recent evidence, has led some to identify the Waitaha of Otago with the moa-hunters of whom so many traces remain. This is not entirely unreasonable, although on Stack's dating of Waitaha, and on modern dating of moa hunter sites, the Waitaha would be latter arrivals. In reality their name has probably been used in tradition, confusingly, to also comprehend earlier arrivals whose own names for themselves are now obscured in the etymological ghost names of Kahui Tipua and Te Rapuwai. The Waitaha of historical oral tradition may have enjoyed a good food-supply for many years and they were probably some of the later moa hunters of the archaeological record. These latter probably preserved moa-flesh in fat, wrapped up in bands of kelp, fastened with totara-bark strips and bartered it for such northern products as flax mats, huia feathers and kumara. The Waitaha must have hunted the moa with such steady persistence that its complete extermination became merely a question of time, though at what date this occurred is not known. Certain it is, however, that the moa found its last stronghold in the inland districts of Otago where the most valuable discoveries of moa remains have been made. Either the birds survived there much longer or else the remarkable preservative quality of the dry air caused the remains to resist decay. Probably both these alternatives apply though it seems more likely that, as its numbers diminished and the attacks of its foes proceeded with unabated vigour, the moa became restricted to the fastnesses of Central Otago, especially to the area between Lake Wakatipu and the Lammerlaw Range.  MƒÅori adaptation and migrations (1500‚Äì1788)  Takiroa Rock Art Site near Duntroon, Waitaki Valley, South Island The 19th century European view of this was that Waitaha did not remain in undisputed possession of their hunting-preserves. They fell victim to a misguided generosity. Seized by a friendly impulse, they sent across the straits to their friends, the Ngati Mamoe (or Katimamoe), some of the surplus stores they had accumulated, and \\"as their friends smacked their lips over these dainties ... they resolved to wrest the coveted preserves from the Waitaha\\". Although the Waitaha, unused to war, soon succumbed, a considerable amount of inter-marriage took place. The words are Canon Stack's and according to him the \\"invasion\\" began about 1477 AD. In fact few records of strife in Otago during this period survive and, as Stack acknowledged, MƒÅori did not accept this construction of their traditions. More likely, as Anderson and others have maintained, this was simply a migration like later ones, accompanied by occasional bloodshed, not an \\"invasion\\".Anderson, 1998, Entwisle, 1998. Early in the seventeenth century, a hapu of the Ngati Kahungunu began to infiltrate the Kati Mamoe domain. However they failed to advance beyond Kaikoura, where a chief of Ngati Mamoe killed the Ngati Kahungunu chief, Manawa, in a skirmish. But with the arrival of a third hapu of the Ngati Kahungunu, the NgƒÅi Tahu (or Kaitahu), towards the close of the 17th century, the stormy era of Otago history began. Again it has been said that the desire to possess unlimited supplies of the precious pounamu or greenstone, which occurred only in the South Island, provided a powerful incentive for invasion. But this has been questioned. The combatants don't fall neatly into groups of Kati Mamoe and Kai Tahu and the given reasons for strife don't refer to greenstone.Anderson,1998. Hostilities were protracted and Kati Mamoe were never \\"subdued\\". There were still people of that descent living in the region when the first Europeans arrived and Kai Tahu were just another MƒÅori people also living in the south. Waka (boat) from the Taieri River plains. Much of the history of this time centres around the turbulent careers of two chiefs, Te Wera of the Kai Tahu, and Taoka, his bitter enemy, who were cousins. These two men apparently became involved in several episodes featuring a surfeit of bloodshed. One such incident occurred when Te Wera killed and ate Taoka's son, whom he and his men had encountered on the south bank of the Waitaki. In revenge, Taoka besieged Te Wera's pa at Karitane, at that time a Kai Tahu stronghold. The besiegers camped at the southern extremity of the sandspit in Waikouaiti Bay, called Ohine-pouweru, and lived there for six months. Frustrated in their endeavours to seize the pƒÅ, Taoka's men uttered the dire threat, \\"We'll starve you out.\\" But back came the defiant cry, shouted by the Kai Tahu chief above the great gateway, \\"You shall never reach us! Only by the army of thirst shall we be overcome.\\" Taoka then uttered threats in vain and when at length his food supplies had dwindled, he was reluctantly forced to raise the siege. Similar skirmishes continued throughout the eighteenth century, waged with a merciless ferocity that must have seriously reduced a once numerous population. On occasion the battles became scenes of bloody carnage. Such conflict occurred in 1750 on the site of the present township of Balclutha, which saw the triumph of the Kati Mamoe. Some fifteen years later at Kaitangata, the Kai Tahu avenged this defeat and routed the Kati Mamoe. Eventually the two groups decided to erect a post on a conspicuous hill known as Popoutunoa, near Clinton: to mark the division of the territory. Thus the Kati Mamoe remained unmolested in the southern portion of the island. Or at least this is Canon Stack's view of the significance of these events. Certainly an end to conflict was brokered at this time which involved marriage across Kati Mamoe and Kai Tahu lines.Anderson, 1998; Evison, 1993. PƒÅ at Huriawa Peninsula This short-lived amity came to an end in 1775 when the sons of Te Wera left Stewart Island to establish a pa between Colac Bay and Orepuki. As the Kati Mamoe could not allow this challenge to pass unnoticed, they rose and destroyed the pa. Their triumph was brief, for while they made their way to the Otago Peninsula, Taihua and his Kati Mamoe party marched into an ambush at Hillend, near the Pomahaka, where their enemies butchered them. Before the close of the century, warfare had again broken out at the Otago Heads, Port Molyneux, and Preservation Inlet. In the vicinity of Lake Te Anau one of the last and most desperate battles took place. A large number of Kati Mamoe were killed and the broken survivors \\"disappeared into the gloomy forests and never again man's eye beheld them.\\" About the same time, the coast-dwelling Kati Mamoe at Preservation Inlet were also defeated, a pitiful remnant escaping in the direction of Dusky Sound. Summing up the warfare in Otago, Beattie states that of the twenty-five battles which took place south of Temuka, five were family affairs in which Kati Mamoe and Kai Tahu fought among themselves. A feature of the warfare was the monotonous regularity with which the two sides won alternately until the closing phases when the Kai Tahu established ascendancy. According to Beattie, defeated in one battle after another, the dwindling band of Kati Mamoe retreated in various directions, some to the western bank of the Waiau River, where they took refuge in caves, some to the far reaches of Te Anau and Manapouri, and some even to the cold shelters of the fiords. This has been the traditional European view but it is not borne out by the survival of Kati Mamoe lines of descent into the principal chiefly families of Otago into and beyond the time of the European arrival and it has been disputed in modern times.Notably by Anderson, 1998 but also by others. Garvan, 1993, also documents lines of descent from this period into European times.  European explorers, sealers and whalers (1788‚Äì1820)  In the late 18th century several European naval expeditions visited southernmost New Zealand, notably the three of Captain James Cook, who did not land in Otago. However, Joseph Banks, sighted a fire on the Otago Peninsula in 1770 which represents the first indirect contact between Maori and Europeans in the Otago Region. As a consequence, following the settlement of Sydney Cove in New South Wales in 1788, visits by several private ventures followed. These saw the first European women to visit New Zealand (in 1792) and to sojourn there (1795‚Äì1797), the sojourn of 244 people on an inhospitable shore for several years, and the building of the first European house and ship in New Zealand. Some of these ventures resulted from the pursuit of seals and constituted the first sealing boom. The visitors encountered few MƒÅori (few lived in the relevant areas), and their presents of iron tools perhaps led to those people's demise at the hands of their countrymen. The revival of New Zealand sealing in 1803 saw the detailed exploration of the south west coast and the penetration of Foveaux Strait from the west. At the same time visitors explored the east coast and the subantarctic islands: principally American ships, which produced Owen Folger Smith's charting of Foveaux Strait from the east in 1804. From 1805 to 1807 a boom took place at the Antipodes Islands ‚Äî territorially part of historical Otago, and probably the source of the Creed manuscript's early European visitors to Otago harbour about 1806/1807. In any case, Sydney sealers operated on the Dunedin coast by late 1809 and had \\"long\\" traded for pigs and potatoes at Otago Harbour by 1810, the year in which hostilities broke out there been MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ in the thirteen-year-long feud called the Sealers' War. In 1809 Robert Murray witnessed the cultivation of potatoes in the Foveaux Strait area, and when Captain Fowler anchored at Otago Harbour the locals already grew potatoes ‚Äì which they wanted to exchange for iron. The pattern of MƒÅori settlement may have changed over time to take advantage of the Tongata Bulla ‚Äî people of the boats ‚Äì and the new goods. In 1810 the Sydney Gazette described the MƒÅori of Foveaux Strait as \\"particularly friendly\\" and anxious to swap potatoes for iron tools. The NgƒÅi Tahu lived around Otago and wanted to trade, but in their inexperience of the Tongata Bulla remained too truculent. Fowler never discovered this. Before coming to Otago Harbour he had visited the west coast, where six of his Lascar seamen deserted. Later, at Stewart Island, he sent an open boat under Robert Brown to search for them. Brown cruised up the east coast, touched at Cape Saunders on the Otago Peninsula before continuing north to a point north of Moeraki. There a group of MƒÅori, incensed by an earlier incident on Otago Harbour in 1810, set upon and eventually killed Brown's whole party. These early contacts left a number of PƒÅkehƒÅ (non-MƒÅori people) living in the south: James Caddell an English boy-sealer captured from the Sydney Cove in 1810; three Lascars (Indian seamen), survivors of the deserting six from the Matilda, one of them called by MƒÅori \\"Te Anu\\". In 1815 William Tucker settled at Whareakeake, later Murdering Beach, where he kept goats and sheep, had a MƒÅori wife and apparently fostered an export trade in greenstone hei-tiki. After a time he left and returned on the Sophia, a Hobart Town sealer commanded by James Kelly. In 1817 Kelly anchored in Otago Harbour. The local chief Korako failed to ferry over MƒÅori from Whareakeake who wanted to receive their share of Tucker's gifts. When Kelly, Tucker and five others later went in an open boat along the coast to Whareakeake, the MƒÅori there attacked them, killing Tucker and two others because of this slight, but also because of the general souring of relations since the incident of 1810. Kelly and the remainder retreated to the Sophia, only to find it occupied by MƒÅori, intent ‚Äì they believed ‚Äì on attacking them. Armed with sealing knives, the Tongata Bulla drove the invaders off, resisted another attack, then destroyed \\"all their navy\\" and burnt \\"the beautiful city of Otago\\". The death toll remains much disputed, but while Kelly probably exaggerated the extent of his revenge, it seems likely he killed several people wholly innocent of the killing of his men. MƒÅori/PƒÅkehƒÅ relations ‚Äì peaceful from the time of Cook's visit and through the first sealing boom from 1792‚Äì1797 ‚Äì soured with the theft of a red shirt, a knife and other articles by a chief Te Wahia from the Sydney Cove on the Otago Harbour late in 1810 ‚Äì and by his killing by an angered sealer. From this there ensued the Sealers' War a series of attacks and counter-attacks, carried out by persons who soon lost sight of the original cause. MƒÅori killed four men from the schooner The Brothers (massacred at Molyneux Harbour); several sailors from the General Gates, and three lascars from the brig Matilda. The feud continued until 1823 when Captain Edwardson succeeded in ending it, thus sparking a new sealing boom desired by both MƒÅori and PƒÅkehƒÅ. Edwardson, sent from Sydney in the Mermaid to investigate the prospects for a flax-industry, explained MƒÅori truculence in terms of their \\"vindictive\\", \\"crafty\\" and \\"lying\\" character which, he opined, made them \\"sensitive to the slightest offence\\". But Edwardson realised that the MƒÅori wanted to trade. With the assistance of Caddell, whom he took to Sydney, he negotiated a truce with the MƒÅori. The attacks and lower prices for skins had dampened the trade, but the restoration of peace saw its brief revival. In the ensuing peace even the \\"unpredictably ferocious\\" Otago harbour MƒÅori modified their behaviour in the interests of trade. Their kin at Ruapuke not only held their traditional monopoly over the sooty shearwaters, or New Zealand muttonbirds, but had effectively monopolised te tongata bulla and its wealth. Some 15 to 20 Europeans, many of them with MƒÅori wives, lived on Codfish Island although they moved freely among the MƒÅori kaiks on the mainland. These Europeans complied with MƒÅori customs for fear of triggering that much-feared \\"touchiness\\". The Journal of John Boultbee, a sealer in the Otago region during the late 1820s, provides ample illustration. On one occasion he went to gather some vegetables which grew wild: :But my cannibal friends told me they were taboo (Tapu, meaning sacred), and I had to throw them away as they had been gathered from a place where a house had been built. Another time I happened to lay my knife on Tiroa's cap [Tiroa being Taiaroa, a chief from the Otago harbour area], on this he took the knife & kept it 2 or 3 days, saying it was taboo taboo. I was therefore obliged to eat with my fingers. Boultbee did not understand the \\"strange custom of tabooing\\", but he recognised that \\"any willful breach of it considered a serious matter, & in severe cases punishable by death\\". The security of the intruders depended upon the goodwill of the paramount rangatira in Murihiku, Te Whakataupuka. The son of Honegai, who had harried the Tongata Bulla wherever he could, Te Whakataupuka proved less truculent and more skilful in manipulating the new arrivals. He became the first to recognise the strategic importance of Ruapuke: he shifted from the mouth of the Matua-a to make his home on the island. Te Whakataupuka impressed John Boultbee as \\"the most complete model of strength, activity & elegance I had seen combined in any man\\". He placed the Europeans under his chiefly protection and at times played and joked with them freely. Limits existed to this familiarity. Once, when a group of PƒÅkehƒÅ engaged in a mock battle with the chief, one accidentally hit his head with a potato (the head of the chief being tapu). This \\"excited him suddenly & caused him to seize a tremendous log of wood, which he threw at them....\\" Cooling quickly, he told them to desist lest he should \\"perhaps get vexed & hurt them, which he would be sorry to do\\". When Te Whakataupuka's son, who preferred to live with the Europeans, died, Boultbee and his companions feared that Te Whakataupuka might hold them responsible for the boy's death. Despite his grief the rangatira refused to allow his warriors to exact revenge. The various hapu at Otago from the early 1820s until the 1850s had as their chiefs Tahatu, Karetai and Taiaroa. Unlike Te Whakataupuka and his nephew, Tuhawaiki, who became the paramount rangatira in 1834, neither Taiaroa nor Karetai earned renown for physical feats or for warrior habits. Tensions existed between them. Karetai functioned as the local chief, but Taiaroa, who had close kinship ties with the Canterbury NgƒÅi Tahu, had been given land on the western side of the harbour where he established a small settlement. When Europeans began visiting regularly he moved his village to the eastern side, close by Karetai's, to muscle in on the trade. Trade had increased rapidly. In 1823 Kent noted only three villages within the harbour; in 1826 Captain Herd reported five. The Otago harbour MƒÅori prospered and Boultbee recorded the arrival at Ruapuke of a boat from Otago laden with '2 large fat hogs & 100 baskets of potatoes each weighing ' For this they received two muskets and one adze.  The Musket Wars  Musket (Brown Bess) in use throughout the Musket Wars in New Zealand. = Campaigns in Canterbury = European contact seems to have played a role in the resumption of internecine warfare. In the North Island tribes in close contact with PƒÅkehƒÅ had acquired muskets by the 1820s. Similarly, in the South Island MƒÅori early acquired European firearms which they used on their relations in the Kai Huaka struggle (\\"Eat-relations\\" feud). Fortunately for the South, the feud did not spread to what would later become the territory of the Otago Province, and though petty quarrels between the Otago and Murihiku natives occurred from time to time, open warfare never took place. The Kai Huaka troubles began in Canterbury. A woman named Murihaka tried on a dog-skin cloak belonging to Tama-i-hara-nui, a chief. Some members of Tama-i-hara-nui's hapu, exasperated by this sacrilegious act, killed the servant of Hape, a friend of Murihaka's. Hape's whanau, finding the retribution excessive, killed some members of the whanau which had avenged the original presumptuous act. This whanau took utu by killing Hape himself. Hape's wife then took refuge with her brothers at Taumutu and they in turn killed three prominent members of yet another whanau. By now, most of the MƒÅori of Banks Peninsula had become involved. The dynamic is simple enough. If one MƒÅori offended another, the aggrieved party's whanau or hapu was obliged to exact an appropriate penalty. In most quarrels this often ended matters unless, as in this case, the penalty seemed excessive. Meanwhile, Tama-i-hara-nui sought aid from kin at Kaiapoi and successfully attacked Taumutu. The Hapu at Taumutu, which included Taiaroa's sister, sent another woman, Hinehaka, who had close ties with several southern chiefs to ask for help. Taiaroa mobilised a large Taua or war party which headed north in canoes. Taiaroa also had kin among the hapu he intended to attack so he went ahead, warned the enemy, then returned to lead the assault. At Wairewa on Banks Peninsula, the southerners won an unsatisfyingly bloodless victory. Fearful of being met by taunts and jeers on returning home, they killed a kinsman of Taununu, a powerful rangatira from Kaikoura who had settled near his kin at Kaiapoi and controlled Rapaki, a large pa in Lyttelton harbour. Utu, which involved revenge, was producing a bloodbath. Taununu led a successful taua south, and Te Whakataupuka now decided to intervene. He and Taiaroa organised a war-party and headed north to seek vengeance. As the southern taua approached their enemy, Taiaroa again went ahead to warn his kin: \\"Escape! Fly for your lives! Take your canoes out to sea! We have guns.\\" This time the enemy moved too slowly. According to survivors of the vanquished hapu, the southern warriors defeated two canoes overcrowded with helpless fugitives. The triumphant warriors from Otago, Ruapuke, and the villages around Foveaux Strait proceeded north to Ripapa, Taununu's pa. After destroying the pa the southern warriors evacuated the entire population of Taumutu and brought them south. Tama-i-hara-nui later followed and persuaded most of them to return home, where he finally took his revenge. The fighting continued spasmodically until 1828, but the southerners took no further part in it. = NgƒÅti Toa invasions = In 1829, Te Whakataupuka sold of land at Preservation Inlet to the whaler, Peter Williams, on payment of sixty muskets, of gunpowder, of musket balls, two cannonades, two air-guns, and a large quantity of tobacco, pipes, spades and hooks. This increased the armament of southern MƒÅori and facilitated the establishment of the South Island's first whaling station. (In what became the historical province of Otago it was next followed by the Weller brothers' on Otago Harbour in 1831.) By 1830 the old threat of the invasion of the South Island by the warlike tribes of the north again appeared menacing when Te Rauparaha, chief of the NgƒÅti Toa, invaded the South and stormed the kƒÅinga (unfortified village) of Takap≈´neke at Akaroa Harbour and took the paramount chief, Tama-i- hara-nui, hostage. A year later he organised a grand attack on Kaiapoi, the chief centre of the Kai Tahu in Canterbury, and laid siege to it. A strong relieving force of Otago warriors, led by Taiaroa, marched hurriedly into the beleaguered pa, slipped past Te Rauparaha and entered it by night. After a long defence in which he played a leading part, Taiaroa, seeing the hopelessness of the position, escaped with his men to Otago harbour, now the tribal stronghold of Kai Tahu, to prepare a counter-stroke. In response to Te Rauparaha's first attack in which he conquered and massacred the northern part of the South Island, 350 well-armed warriors, led by Te Whakataupuka and Taiaroa marched northwards and overtook the retreating NgƒÅti Toa warriors at Te Koko-o-Kupe / Cloudy Bay, near Cook Strait. Here Taiaroa and another young chief, T≈´hawaiki, seized Te Rauparaha, only to have the wily chief slip out of his cloak and dive into the sea. He then swam to his canoes. The Kai Tahu claimed a victory; the NgƒÅti Toa retorted that they had successfully evaded the ambush. The subsequent skirmish at sea proved inconclusive, except that Te Rauparaha escaped. In 1835 Taiaroa, again accompanied by T≈´hawaiki who, on Te Whakataupuka's death in that year, had become the paramount chief of Murihiku, organised another large expedition of four hundred men which once more inflicted severe losses upon the NgƒÅti Toa and their prestige, with that of their chief, had suffered considerably in these encounters with the warriors of southern New Zealand. MƒÅori belligerence made pƒÅkehƒÅ nervous and emphasised the tenuousness of trade. In August 1834, the captain of the Lucy Ann reported in Sydney that the MƒÅori living beside the Weller brothers whaling station on Otago harbour now treated the pƒÅkehƒÅ there with the greatest contempt, talked of wiping out all pƒÅkehƒÅ, and took what they wanted. Their \\"insolence\\" grew so much, one captain complained, that \\"they take from us whatever suits their fancy, such as our clothing. and food from off our very plates ‚Äì help themselves to oil, in such quantities as they require...\\". Four captains of whaling vessels complained: :\\"a powerful tribe of one or two thousand natives from the Southward, under a chief called Taiaroa... are at war with the tribes of the straits, and last year destroyed fifty tons of barrels, and some oil with the huts and the property...\\" Their own MƒÅori patrons refused to or could not protect them. Disease now tipped the balance. In September 1835 measles and influenza spread among the southern Kai Tahu and carried off, most notably, Te Whakataupuka. It remains unclear how many died. One European said that the hapu at the mouth of the Tokomairaro River owned nine canoes, but had enough men to crew only one. The whalers often attributed to disease a marked decline in MƒÅori numbers. But the last act in the intertribal war had not yet taken place. In 1836 Te Puoho, a kinsman of Te Rauparaha, tried to persuade the ageing warrior to march once more against the people of Otago harbour and Murihiku. Te Rauparaha refused and said: \\"It is easy to burst the tree at the root (Kaiapoi), but harder to burst it at the branches (Murihiku).\\" \\"He must not expect the people in the south to be sitting in trees with their breasts open like pigeons facing the sun.\\" Te Rauparaha may have given an official blessing, conditional upon victory. At any rate, in the summer of 1836, Te Puoho led his war-party, about seventy in number, down the West Coast as far as the Awarua River, toiled painfully and crossed the mountains through today's Haast Pass ‚Äî a miracle of endurance ‚Äî and, half-famished, moved down the valley of the Makarora River and captured a village at Wanaka. The invaders then proceeded up the Cardrona Valley, crossed the Crown Range and the Kawarau River, using a natural rock bridge, then finally, by following the Nevis and Nokomai Rivers, entered the enemy's heartland, Murihiku. After a short rest to recuperate, they pushed on along the old MƒÅori track that ran over the low hills west of Gore and, soon after crossing the Mataura River, the party reached Tuturau and sacked the village. Unfortunately for the invaders, the whole south soon became aware of the invasion, for Te Puoho did not know that the news of his presence had, despite precautions, been taken to T≈´hawaiki at Ruapuke. Nor would he have known that Taiaroa was visiting the island. The two chiefs hastily assembled a force of between 70 and 100 men. The whalers transported the warriors to the mainland. The local pƒÅkehƒÅ, 'in a state of considerable alarm', prepared to flee at a moment's notice. The unsuspecting NgƒÅti Toa slept at Tuturau while the Kai Tahu surrounded the village. During the night, the Kai Tahu tohunga summoned up the pulsing heart of Te Puoho, a favourable omen, and in the morning the Kai Tahu quickly defeated the invaders, killing Te Puoho. Taiaroa intervened to save the lives of some of his kin who had helped him to escape Te Rauparaha's clutches during the Siege of Kaiapoi in 1833. At Ruapuke, Bluff and Otago the pƒÅkehƒÅ and the Kai Tahu celebrated their triumph with enthusiasm and relief. Thus ignominiously ended the invasion, memorable as the last act of inter-MƒÅori warfare in the South Island. In January 1838, T≈´hawaiki and Taiaroa made a sudden march to Queen Charlotte Sound, and in December of the following year, led another war-party in sixteen sealing and four whaling boats, but Te Rauparaha, still smarting from his former humiliations, never again faced the southern warriors. Although these excursions constituted little more than a dramatic demonstration of Kai Tahu rights over Banks Peninsula, they proved that, once and for all, the southerners had overcome their fear of the northerners.  NgƒÅi Tahu and Christianity  Tuhawaiki had become the paramount rangatira of the NgƒÅi Tahu and played a decisive role in shaping the future of his people. Born at Taununu, at the mouth of the Matua-a (or Clutha), around 1805 as a nephew of Te Whakataupuka, Tuhawaiki had direct descent from Hautapu-nui-o-tu and from Honekai; he also had an impeccable Ngati Mamoe lineage and close kin-ties with such prominent PƒÅkehƒÅ as James Cadell and John Kelly. He had won great mana in both worlds. He had a well- established reputation as a harpooner and sailor, he had an intimate knowledge of PƒÅkehƒÅ customs, and in the long campaign against Te Rauparaha he had enhanced his mana. Like his uncle he understood the value of the PƒÅkehƒÅ presence and placed them under his mana. Even the truculent Taiaroa obeyed. Unlike his uncle, Tuhawaiki realised that his people could only survive the expansion of European society by borrowing more extensively. He owned a trading ship, built himself a PƒÅkehƒÅ house, and dressed like a PƒÅkehƒÅ. He encouraged agriculture, traded widely, and appears to have blessed Jones's attempt to colonise the Waikouaiti region. He must also have recognised that the PƒÅkehƒÅ presence afforded additional protection against Te Rauparaha. Most PƒÅkehƒÅ agreed that he was shrewd, wily and knowledgeable, 'probably one of the most Europeanised MƒÅori...most correctly and completely dressed in white man's clothes, even to the refinement of the cotton pocket handkerchief.' Tuhawaiki doubtless realised that whaling had transformed the world of his people. Many kaiks or villages moved to the vicinity of the whaling-stations (although some may represent foundations by refugees from the Ngati Toa). Large numbers of MƒÅori men worked in the whaling stations while many women lived in de facto marriages with PƒÅkehƒÅ men. These MƒÅori joined one of the lowest strata of European society, characterised by violence and drunkenness. Observers like Shortland thought relations between the two races were often very good at the whaling stations. Probably no other tribe in New Zealand was so extensively intermarried with and involved in PƒÅkehƒÅ society. Possibly nowhere else was the PƒÅkehƒÅ so willing to tolerate or adopt MƒÅori customs. Most of the MƒÅori living in the whaling stations dressed like Europeans and during the 1830s acquired an addiction for tobacco and alcohol. But in this they did not differ from the whalers. Tuhawaiki adopted a threefold strategy for coping with the new world. Firstly, he encouraged the development of skills appropriate to the emergent world of PƒÅkehƒÅ and MƒÅori. Secondly, he clearly envisaged the peaceful integration of these two worlds on terms acceptable to the MƒÅori. And thirdly, he recognised the importance of PƒÅkehƒÅ religion and the power of the PƒÅkehƒÅ Atua (or God). Tuhawaiki, widely travelled and knowledgeable in the ways of the PƒÅkehƒÅ, possibly ascribed to the PƒÅkehƒÅ Atua the role of unifying the two peoples. In accepting James Watkin, the Methodist parson at Waikouaiti, and yet inviting another missionary to Ruapuke, he may have responded to the conversion of his own followers. In any case he travelled to Waikouaiti to hear Watkin's first sermon, asked for a missionary to be sent to Ruapuke, and extended a warm and hospitable welcome to visiting clergy. During the 1830s Christianity had caught on through much of the North Island. Slaves of the NgƒÅ Puhi in Northland first accepted the Gospel. The news spread fast. Weariness of war, the mana of the Bible, and a passion for literacy fuelled the fire. MƒÅori teachers, often self-taught, carried the Word far beyond the zones of the European missionaries. The magic of literacy most dramatically expressed the power of the PƒÅkehƒÅ atua. Bibles, or a few pages from any book, represented a new magic which MƒÅori believed could protect its owner from death in battle, bestow eternal life, ward off sickness, and thus complement the power of traditional karakia (or incantations). NgƒÅi Tahu sailors must have heard the Word. Northern converts such as Te Rauparaha's son, brought the new Word south. When Watkin arrived at Waikouaiti he found ready a MƒÅori market for his spiritual wares. A large crowd attended his first service and listened attentively \\"tho' they could not understand anything that was said. When he printed some Bibles, 'they were eagerly sought after'. PƒÅkehƒÅ magic and the mana that one could win by possessing its secret persuaded the southern MƒÅori to turn, in their own way and for their own reasons, to Christianity. When Wohlers arrived at Ruapuke the tohunga karakia (or priests) welcomed him as a comrade and explained their theology. The chiefs, led by Tuhawaiki, also adopted the new faith and sponsored traditional NgƒÅi Tahu teachers for baptism. The tohunga karakia quickly accepted certain elements of the Christian faith, but they, like the young men of inherited mana who patronised Watkin's school, wanted to adapt the new Gospel to the old karakia. These men also wanted to achieve mana as teachers of the PƒÅkehƒÅ magic and quickly voiced resentment when the PƒÅkehƒÅ tohunga started to baptise everyone. Wohlers discovered that both Watkin and Bishop Selwyn had complied with this pressure and for a while the MƒÅori teachers so arranged matters that \\"applicants [for Baptism] had to go to them in order to be recommended.\\" Church from Otakou, Dunedin, New Zealand, build in 1941 to replace an earlier church built in 1865. The PƒÅkehƒÅ missionaries then realised that their mana as teachers depended on the number of converts they made. Watkin's register of baptisms records the explosive result. In 1841, he baptised two MƒÅori (one of them intended marrying a PƒÅkehƒÅ); in 1842 he baptised three MƒÅori; and then in 1843 he baptised 193 and another 158 before leaving in 1844. As many missionaries realised, the MƒÅori transformed Christianity in the process of 'conversion'. To the despair of Watkin, the MƒÅori interpreted the Christian karakia in their own way. Much to the dismay of the practical Wohlers, the strict moral code of the Old Testament proved infectious. When Selwyn preached a 'sermon on contentment with one's lot' the MƒÅori stopped producing food and trade with American whalers fell off abruptly; \\"the pigs ate the potatoes, the MƒÅori ate the pigs, and there was nothing left.\\" At Waikouaiti and Moeraki the MƒÅori refused to work on Sundays. Not only did the MƒÅori shape the Christian message to their own beliefs, but they found in the denominational structure a familiar world. The different churches proved perfect instruments for sustaining traditional rivalries and animosities while learning PƒÅkehƒÅ ways. Because the Ngati Toa became Anglican, most of the prominent NgƒÅi Tahu joined the Wesleyans. Some villages acknowledged the mana of each denomination's Atua. Very small kaiks sometimes built two churches and two schools and the chief at Moeraki made part of his hapu Catholic, part Anglican, and part traditional. Among the MƒÅori the generosity and mana of the PƒÅkehƒÅ tohunga counted for much. The Roman Catholic Bishop, Jean Baptiste Pompallier visited the south in 1840, and poor Watkin watched his flock transfer allegiance to the Papist. The worried Wesleyan confided in his journal: \\"Their mode of worship and wonderful legends would lead me to fear that Popery would prevail over Protestantism.\\" The local MƒÅori, probably with a strong leavening of northern refugees, flocked to the new tohunga. His robes and vestments attracted much favourable comment, the pomp of Catholic ritual and liturgy impressed, and some MƒÅori told Watkin to his face that they regretted his 'plain dress and equally plain mode of conducting religious worship'. Pompallier baptised freely, unlike the prudent Protestants, and responded with tolerance to MƒÅori dance and tattooing. To Watkin's horror, Bishop Pompallier even told the local MƒÅori that Hine, the wife of Maui, was the Virgin Mary. The Catholic Church lacked the resources to capitalise upon the Bishop's success and the Wesleyans, left to themselves, regained the lost ground. But allegiances remained volatile. When Selwyn, walking south, swam a flooded river, an entire village joined his church.  European colonisation and New Zealand's leading province (1840‚Äì1900)  The Treaty did not at first have much significance in Otago, the Crown even initially declared the area uninhabited so as to make its signing irrelevant. However land-sales and European immigration plans occurred in its wake, making the treaty a turning point in Otago's History.  Land sales and the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi  In the 1830s and 1840s the MƒÅori of Otago and Murihiku, possibly anxious for a strong PƒÅkehƒÅ presence, agreed to sell many of their traditional lands. Back in 1833, a further sale of Murihiku land had taken place when Joseph Weller acquired from Te Whakataupuka the whole of Te Picamoke (Stewart Island) and two adjacent islands for one hundred pounds. In 1838, Tuhawaiki, accompanied by four chiefs, visited Sydney and sold enormous tracts of land \\"with all the solemnity of archaic phraseology and legal circumlocution\\". Sydney speculators pursued the golden future with an enthusiasm which increased in intensity with the prospect of British annexation of New Zealand. On 14 January 1840, Governor George Gipps of New South Wales issued a proclamation forbidding future sales, unless to the Crown, and warned that commissioners would investigate all titles already claimed and that, where appropriate, Crown grants would validate them. One month later, on 15 February 1840 during a second visit to Sydney, Tuhawaiki, Karetai and three subordinate chiefs, Kaikoarare, Taikawa and Poneke signed an agreement which \\"sold\\" the \\"Island of Te Waipounamu, also called the Middle Island of new Zealand, also the island called Stewarts island... together with all seas, harbours, coasts, bays, inlets, rivers, lakes, waters, mines, minerals, fisheries, woods, forests, liberties, franchises, profits, hereditaments... save and except such portions of the said island as have been already disposed of.. . and also the island of Robuchi\\". The purchase was made partly by cash payments and partly by annuities. Tuhawaiki signed for \\"One hundred pounds of lawful British money and an annuity of fifty pounds a year during the term of his natural life.\\" Hence by February 1840, every acre in Otago and Murihiku, as indeed in the entire South Island, had apparently been alienated by the MƒÅori to hopeful speculators who gambled on receiving from the Crown some title commensurate with the expenses they alleged had been incurred. The highly questionable nature of these transactions became more evident after Captain William Hobson arrived at the Bay of Islands on 29 January 1840 to win from the MƒÅori allegiance to the British Crown. Then followed two proclamations, the second stating that Her Majesty could not acknowledge as valid any titles of land which were not derived from, or confirmed by the Crown. After the northern chiefs had signed the Treaty, Captain Nias set sail for the south in on 29 April and it was not until June that British Sovereignty over the South Island was proclaimed on Stewart Island. On 9 June HMS Herald called at Ruapuke and Major Thomas Bunbury, who was collecting signatures for the Treaty of Waitangi, recorded that \\"Tuhawaiki, who had recently returned from Sydney enriched by the spoils of commerce, came on board in full dress staff uniform of a British aide-de-camp, with gold laced trousers and cocked hat and plume in which he looked extremely well, accompanied by a native dress sergeant dressed in a corresponding costume.\\" Tuhawaiki signed the Treaty without hesitation, his example being followed by Kakoura and Taiaroa who were also at Ruapuke at the time. Tuhawaiki also had a bodyguard of 20 men, all dressed in British uniforms, although they refused to wear boots. Scottish settlement scheme The New Zealand Company purchased the Otago block from NgƒÅi Tahu dignitaries on 31 July 1844 for ¬£2,400 and gained legal title in 1847, opening the way for large-scale European settlement in Otago on Wakefield lines. The settlement was planned to be named New Edinburgh but instead the local name Otago (a variant of ≈åtƒÅkou) was used. George Rennie and William Cargill, both from Scotland, along with the Free Church of Scotland were the initial backers of the settlement. The Free Church had split in 1843 in protest at landowners having power over the nomination of ministers. The first wave of settlement came of two ships (from Greenock on the Firth of Clyde), the John Wickliffe, arrived in 1848, and the Philip Laing arrived three weeks latter but with twice the passengers. Early immigrants came from Scotland's lowlands as the worst of the highland clearances had occurred decades before. The land of Dunedin had already been divided up and settlers had drawn lots in Scotland to define the picking order. About half of those to arrive were from the Free Church. Of the 12,000 immigrants who were to follow in the 1850s about 75% were Scottish. This can be determined from the diary and informal census of the Reverend Thomas Burns. William Cargill (first superintendent 1853‚Äì1860) and Thomas Burns (both Scottish) were the leaders of the new settlement, however, a number of Englishmen also had positions of power. John Turnbull Thomson was an English surveyor at this time and named many of Otago's landmarks. Otago's other coastal port of Oamaru was laid out in 1858 and its streets were named after British rivers. Some settlers arrived as assisted immigrants. James McNeil, on the site of Balclutha and the Provincial Government established a ferry service across the Clutha in 1857. The mores of the settlement included a mix of conservative values from the free church, such as the Sabbath Ordinance enforcing no games or work on Sunday, and the decadence of a new colony. At this time free primary education was introduced and Otago started its long debate about the consumption of alcohol. Most agricultural exports were sold to south east Australia during their gold rush. Sheep farming was introduced, with half a million by 1861. Land was commonly leased to farmers and wages were higher than in Scotland. Some of the run holders began to venture inland to create large stations around Lake Wakatipu and Wanaka. However central Otago would not be fully colonised until after the Otago gold rush. 'The Blue Book' showing NgƒÅi Tahu alive in 1848 By 1849 it was starting to be felt by NgƒÅi Tahu that the crown had defaulted on its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi. This included those in Otago, and resulted in a claim being made against the crown. The claim cited three main areas where the crown had failed to fulfill its obligations, building schools and hospitals, setting aside 10% of the land as reserve and providing access to food gathering resources. NgƒÅi Tahu took the case to court in 1868 but no decision could be reached, in part due to a lack of political will by the crown. The claim was to continue to be unresolved for more than hundred years and by the end of the century fewer than 2000 NgƒÅi Tahu lived on tribal land.  Gold rush period 1861‚Äì1870) Gabriel's Gully during the height of the gold rush in 1862. While of no direct value to Maori, gold was highly prized by Europeans as a means of exchange and in the production of jewelry. Therefore, when it was first discovered by Europeans in Otago (near the modern town of Lawrence in 1861) it had a profound positive effect on the economy and immigration of the then tiny colony. The Lindis gold rush was slightly earlier involved about 300 miners but was over in a few months. Dunedin soon became the largest city in New Zealand and transport networks and townships expanded into the interior. In 1862 the gold rush expanded to across inland Otago to Cromwell and Arrowtown. Queenstown, originally a sheep station come hotel became a thriving town. In 1863 new finds were made closer to the coast in the Taieri River catchment. 1863 also saw the peak of the gold rush, with about 22,000 people living in the gold fields. In the 1860s Otago earned ¬£10 million from gold but only ¬£3.57 million from sheep. Water sluicing races extended the life of the diggings but also had a destructive effect on the landscape and soil. After 1864 there were no more discoveries drawing prospectors from overseas. In 1865 Dunedin's wealth and the disruptive wars in the North Island lead Otago to support a failed resolution in the General Assembly for independence from the North Island. In 1866 Chinese immigrants came to Otago with the support of local businesses. They were to work in the gold mines and experienced legislated racism from other immigrants. When New Zealand provinces were formed in 1853, the southern part of New Zealand belonged to Otago Province. Settlers in Murihiku, the southernmost part of the South Island purchased from MƒÅori in 1853 by Walter Mantell, petitioned the government for separation from Otago. Petitioning started in 1857, and the Province of Southland was proclaimed in 1861. As the new province of Southland started to accumulate debt by the late 1860s, it became part of the Otago Province again in 1870.  Refrigerated exports and development of the interior (1870‚Äì1900) Otago Province (1852‚Äì1876) originally was all of New Zealand south of the Waitaki River. Due to the gold rush by 1870 one quarter of New Zealanders lived in Otago and one third of exports came from there. In 1881 Dunedin was New Zealand's largest urban centre. The gold mining population with many new Irish and English immigrants shifted the province away from Scottish dominance. The Long Depression was a worldwide economic recession, beginning in 1873 and running either through the spring of 1879, or 1896, depending on the metrics used. In Otago this came soon after the end of the Gold Rush, however by 1882 pastoralism and the associated frozen-meat industry was able to send refrigerated loads to Britain. This lessened the effect of the depression and allowed for continued economic growth in Otago. Map showing counties that Otago Province was split into between 1876 and 1989. The main export product was wool and lamb. However, in the 1880s erosion, rabbits and scab caused problems for sheep farmers. The first refrigerated shipment to Britain was in 1882 and left Port Chalmers (Oamaru?) on the SS Elderslie. This led to meat-freezing works being established near Dunedin (Burnside) and in Oamaru and Balclutha (Finegand). The forced subdivision of Otago's large holding soon followed between 1895 and 1909 in North Otago 15 runs became 540 farms. The hot summers and cold winters were good for orcharding which developed in Central Otago from the late 19th century. In order to support agriculture a rail network was built throughout Otago. Starting in Dunedin in 1889, reaching Hyde by 1894, Clyde in 1907 and Cromwell in 1921. While the gold rush diminished less labour-intensive gold mining became more common. From the 1880s quartz mining (instead of alluvium) became possible, while massive dredges continued to work the old deposits. These dredges also inspired the first hydro electric power station at Bullendale near Queenstown in 1886. This gold boom peaked between 1890‚Äì1900 but put a lot of individual prospectors out of business. The 1893 Women's Suffrage Petition was the second of two mass petitions to the New Zealand Government in support of women's suffrage. About one third of Dunedin women signed the petition, a higher percentage than any other city. In 1889 New Zealand's first women's trade union (the Tailoresses) was founded in Dunedin. From the late 1880s onwards worker activists and middle-class reformers investigated poor working conditions in Dunedin and around Otago. Labour manifestos in the 1880s demanded the exclusion of Chinese as they were seen as working for low wages. In August 1890 the Maritime Council went on strike in sympathy with Australian maritime unionists. ‚Äú In 1894 Clutha went dry followed by the Oamaru district in 1905 and Bruce in 1922 and in 1917 6pm closing was introduced for pubs. Otago sent men to fight in the Boer War in South Africa. This was the first of many overseas military operations that mean from Otago took part in. Several major floods have occurred on the Clutha, most notably the \\"Hundred year floods\\" of 14‚Äì16 October 1878 and 13‚Äì15 October 1978. The 1878 flood is regarded as New Zealand's greatest known flood. During this, a bridge at Clydevale was washed downstream, where it collided with the Balclutha Road Bridge, destroying the latter. Bendix Hallenstein, came from Australia in the 1860s started his retail business in Queenstown and then Dunedin from the early 1880s. By the 1900s he was trading New Zealand wide. The first the New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in 1889‚Äì90 was a high point of Dunedin economic and cultural importance. The large scale tourist potential of Otago had been acknowledged since at least the 1870s in McKay's Otago Almanac. With the building of the Dunedin to Kingston railway in the late 1870s this potential could be realised. By the early 1900s Summer tourism around Lake Wakatipu had been full established.  Stagnation and renewal (1900-today) In the early 20th century a number of events occurred that are traditionally seen as part of New Zealand's shift towards independence. New Zealand passed on a chance to become part of Australia in 1901. In 1907 the United Kingdom granted New Zealand \\"Dominion\\" status within the British Empire, the high death toll from the First World War and in 1920 New Zealand joined the League of Nations as a sovereign state. Other regions particularly in the North Island also begin to overtake Otago's population and economic importance at this time.  The wars and depression (1900‚Äì1945)  Otago had a slow start to the new century, followed by two world wars and a depression. In 1920 sheep numbers in Otago were the same as in 1880, with rabbits, erosion and distance from world markets continuing to be a problem. Farming initially expanded rapidly into forested areas. However, in the Catlins especially many were uneconomic and returned to forest or scrub. With the outbreak of the First World War the Otago Infantry Regiment was formed. Along with the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment they served at Gallipoli in 1915, before being moved to the Western Front from 1916 until the end of the war. Eight hundred women formed the Otago and Southland's Women's Patriotic Association in 1914, which supported the overseas troops. Four thousand Otago men died during the war and when it ended and the troops returned, the Spanish flu struck between September and November in 1918. By 1923 Dunedin was New Zealand's fourth largest city and the opening of the Panama Canal (1914) had diverted global trade from the South Pacific. In response to this economic stagnation Dunedin launched the second New Zealand and South Seas International Exhibition in 1925. Dunedin grew slowly during this time with a slight decline during the depression, when Dunedin's population fell by 3,000 to 82,000. The labour movement was slower to get organised in Otago than in other regions. During the Depression of the 1930s unemployed workers were sent to the gold workings in Otago and in exchange for 30 shillings a week could keep some of the gold they found. In the 1932 depression there were riots in Dunedin, stores and cars were vandalised, food packages then given to unemployed.  Feeding Britain and social change (1945‚Äì1973)  After the war, with Britain's demand for food and better farming practices Otago experienced increased prosperity. This led to urban growth throughout Otago. Oamaru's population increased by 75%, Balclutha's doubled, and Alexandra's and Mosgiel's tripled. Dunedin's quickly returned to its pre-depression population. By 1946 there were 100 rabbit boards given the responsibility of controlling rabbits on farmland. Large electric power stations were built on the Waitaki (Aviemore 1968) and Clutha (1956‚Äì62) rivers, and a container terminal at Port Chalmers (1971, first container shipment). More recent projects, however, were met with protest due to environmental concerns. The save Manapouri campaign from 1959‚Äì1972 and cost overruns on the Clyde Dam made future large projects more challenging. These projects did however, lead to population growth in the surrounding towns, In 1960 commercial jet boat rides started operating in the Queenstown area. This together with a rope tow on Coronet Peak (1947) and the building of hiking huts made the Queenstown and lakes district a center for year-round tourism. In 1967 10pm closing came back in for pubs  All alone in the world (1973-today)  Otago continued to export most of its produce to the United Kingdom until the 1970s. This began to change when the United Kingdom joined the European Community in 1973 and abrogated its preferential trade agreements with New Zealand. This, along with several international oil shocks and a reactionary government, led to severe economic disruption and hardship in Otago. The (centre-left) Labour government counter-intuitively opted for open market (neo-liberal) reforms to make New Zealand more competitive in the international market place. This led to a shift away from the primary sector. Woollen mills at Kaikorai Valley, Milton and Mosgiel closed in 1957, 1999 and 2000 respectively. Several counties were amalgamated in 1989 to form the Region of Otago. This was smaller than the 19th century Otago Province, which had included Fiordland and Stewart Island. Queenstown's primary industry became tourism, including wine tasting and golf, and adventure sports such as skiing, jet boating, rafting, and bungee jumping. A shift from sheep to dairy farming began in Otago, which was more intensive of water and power resources. The old railway was converted into a bike trail for tourists from (2000). The National Party supported a controversial aluminium smelter at Aramoana, whose requirement for electric power was one justification for the Clyde Dam. Similar environmental concerns have been raised for wind turbines on Otago's mountain ranges. The Alcoholic Liquor Advisory Council (ALAC)) was formed in 1976. Beer went on sale in supermarkets in 1999, and the drinking age was lowered from 20 to 18. NgƒÅi Tahu's claim from the late 1840s was recognised by the Waitangi Tribunal in 1991 and negotiations between the Crown and NgƒÅi Tahu followed that same year in response. The Tribunal stated that they \\"cannot avoid the conclusion that in acquiring from NgƒÅi Tahu 34.5 million acres, more than half the land mass of New Zealand, for ¬£14,750 pounds, and leaving them with only 35,757 acres, the Crown acted unconscionably and in repeated breach of the Treaty of Waitangi\\". Court battles continued, but with the intervention of the Prime Minister, Mr Jim Bolger, a non-binding agreement was signed in 1996. This was followed by the signing of the Deed of Settlement in 1997, and the passage of the NgƒÅi Tahu Claim Settlement Act in 1998. The main points agreed to by the crown were to allow NgƒÅi Tahu to express its traditional relationship with the environment, to issue an apology, grant NgƒÅi Tahu $170 million and return ownership of pounamu. To enroll as a beneficiary of NgƒÅi Tahu claim prospective tribe members must prove descent from those members alive in 1848. The list of 1848 living members (the 'Blue Book') was put together in the late 1800s when the fulfillment of the claim seemed imminent. Planned hydro power plants on the Clutha and Waitaki rivers were stopped. However, a number of wind farms have been built throughout Otago. The Mahinerangi Wind Farm was built in 2011 while a project in the Lammermoor Range was cancelled in 2012 due to complications in the environment and high courts.

Background The Ex had formed and recorded their earliest material in 1979 during the heyday of the Dutch squatters movement. Following the band's release of their All Corpses Smell the Same EP, the group's bassist Ren√© left the band for New Zealand and was replaced by then 15-year-old Bas. The Ex reentered Dolf Planteijdt's Koeienverhuurbedrijf (literally \\"cow rental\\") Studio to record 10 songs for an LP that covered topics such as the Dutch housing crisis and squatters' movement (\\"Squatsong\\"), police brutality (\\"Warning-Shot\\"), environmental illness (\\"A Sense of Tumor\\"), and sexual assault (\\"Meanwhile\\"). Release Because Disturbing Domestic Peace's studio material clocked in at under 30 minutes, the band decided to press it at 45 RPM and add a bonus 7\\" of four live songs to make the package into a full- length release. The album's cover depicts Dutch police in the process of evicting squatters, reflecting the heightened tensions and confrontations in Netherlands and other parts of Europe at that time. The band priced the record at 10 Dutch guilders and sold out all 1,000 copies of its original October 1980 pressing within a week, prompting them to order further pressings that sold another 3,000 copies for that year's Christmas season. A final batch of 500 copies followed in early 1981. In addition to the bonus \\"Live Skive\\" 7\\", the original 12\\" album included a booklet of lyrics, starting the band's habit of including many inserts in their next 12 years' worth of releases. The album was first issued on CD, along with The Ex's entire back catalog, in 1993, and then as a digital download on Bandcamp in the 2010s. The American label Superior Viaduct announced that it would be reissuing the album in its original 12\\"-with-bonus-7\\" format, including a 20-page booklet, in September 2020.

The 105th Tactical Airlift Squadron, assigned to the Wings 118th Operations Group, is a descendant organization of the World War I 105th Aero Squadron, established on 27 August 1917. It was reformed on 4 December 1921, as the 105th Observation Squadron, and is one of the 29 original National Guard Observation Squadrons of the United States Army National Guard formed before World War II. Overview The 184th Wing MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) mission is to provide close air support (CAS), air interdiction, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and attack to eliminate threats when present. The multi-role capabilities of these RPAs allows Combat Search and Rescue operations and extended time over targets to locate, track, target, strike, and assess time sensitive targets The plan also calls for the 118th Wing to get a cyber-security unit and expand their intelligence squadron.

Deployed to the European Theater of Operations (ETO), and assigned to Eighth Air Force in England. Engaged in combat operations until May 1945. Returned to the United States during September‚ÄìNovember 1945, and was inactivated on 10 November 1945. Tennessee Air National Guard A High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) vehicle is loaded into one of four C-130 aircraft from the 118th Airlift Wing 4 June 2011 as the Tennessee Army National Guard's 1/181st Field Artillery Battalion headed to Fort Chaffee, Ark. for two weeks of annual training. Was re-established in 1946 as the Tennessee Air National Guard 118th Fighter Group, receiving federal recognition and being activated on 2 October 1947. Formed at Berry Field, Nashville. The new Group was initially assigned to the 54th Fighter Wing, Fourteenth Air Force. It consisted of the 105th Fighter Squadron and the 155th Fighter Squadron at Memphis Municipal Airport. Both squadrons flew the F-47 Thunderbolt. In October 1947, the 154th Fighter Squadron at Little Rock, Arkansas (Arkansas ANG), was assigned to the Group. The 154th flew F-51 Mustangs. On 1 September 1950, the group was elevated to a Wing level and was activated as the 118th Composite Wing. It was assigned to Fourteenth Air Force, Continental Air Command, with Wing Headquarters at Berry Field. The 118th Fighter Group was redesignated the 118th Composite Group and along with the 105th Fighter Squadron was absorbed by the 118th Composite Wing. On 1 February 1951, the 118th Composite Wing, 118th Composite Group and 105th Fighter Squadron were redesignated the 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing, Group and Squadron respectively. The 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing (TRW) and Group were activated for federal service 1 February 1951. On 13 April 1951, the 118th TRW was reassigned to Tactical Air Command, (TAC), Langley AFB, Virginia, and operated from the municipal airport at Memphis, TN. On 3 August 1951, the 118th TRW was released from assignment to TAC and reassigned and transferred to Headquarters Ninth Air Force, Shaw AFB, SC. The 105th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron stayed at Berry Field. It was redesignated as the 105th Fighter Interceptor Squadron and was activated in place 1 March 1951. While on active duty, it operated two geographically separated units; Detachment 1 flying P-47 Thunderbolt aircraft, from McGhee-Tyson Airport at Knoxville, TN, provided air defense for the Atomic Energy Commission at Oak Ridge, and Detachment 2 was the 4674th Ground Observer Squadron, Smyrna, TN. 1 January 1953, the 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing returned to Berry Field with the following assigned units: 118th Tactical Reconnaissance Group, 105th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron, 155th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Memphis, and the 154th Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron at Little Rock, AR. The units were equipped with the RF-51 Mustang from 1953 ‚Äì 1954, the Lockheed RF-80C Shooting Star from 1954 ‚Äì 1956, and the Republic RF-84F Thunderflash from 1956 to early 1961. In April 1961 the Wing converted to an airlift mission flying the C-97G Stratofreighter. On 12 May 1961, the 118th Air Transport Wing (Heavy) was reassigned to Eastern Transport Air Force (EASTAF), Military Air Transport Service (MATS). In January 1966, MATS was renamed Military Airlift Command (MAC). As a result, the 118th Air Transport Wing, Group and Squadron were redesignated the 118th Military Airlift Wing, Group and Squadron. The 118th MAW converted to the C-124C Globemaster II transport and received the first of eight of these aircraft 6 April 1967. Operating from Nashville during the Vietnam War, the 118th MAW supported global airlift requirements of U.S. military forces. The Wing became Executive Agent for ANG Airlift Support in conjunction with the Vietnam effort in 1965. This function now resides at the Air National Guard Readiness Center at Andrews AFB, MD. A well-trained group of officers and airmen at Berry Field operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week, coordinated the airlift of equipment and personnel by 18 Military Airlift Groups in 15 states. Beginning in December 1965, the 105th MAS flew more than 100 missions to South Vietnam in a period of approximately a year and a half. In March 1971, the Wing converted to the C-130A Hercules aircraft and became the 118th Tactical Airlift Wing. The Wing was assigned to Ninth Air Force, Tactical Air Command. Ultimately five ANG Tactical Airlift Groups were assigned to the Wing by 9 June 1973: the 145th TAG, Charlotte, NC, the 166th TAG, New Castle, DE, the 167th TAG Martinsburg, WV, the 170th TAG, McGuire AFB, NJ, and the 118th TAG at Nashville. 1 December 1974, the 118th Tactical Airlift Wing was transferred from 9th Air Force, Tactical Air Command (TAC), to 21st Air Force, Military Airlift Command (MAC). On 9 February 1975, the 118th Tactical Airlift Group was inactivated, passing its World War II lineage and history to the 118th Tactical Airlift Wing. In June 1978 the Wing was recognized for its achievements and was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. In 1979, the Wing was enlarged from eight to sixteen C-130A Aircraft. Since acquiring the C-130 airframe, the unit has supported a worldwide tactical airlift mission. Participation in exercises such as Brave Shield, Brim Frost and Red Flag were accomplished with some of the oldest aircraft in the inventory (1954‚Äì1957 A models). Rotations to Panama in support of Volant Oak beginning in 1977 became routine. Post-Cold War C-130 HerculesThe Wing mobilized 462 personnel during 21 deployments for Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm in southwest Asia and flew a record 7239 flying hours. In 1992, Military Airlift Command (MAC) was reorganized as the Air Mobility Command (AMC). As a part of this reorganization, the 118th Tactical Airlift Wing became the 118th Airlift Wing. With sixteen C-130H aircraft and 1406 personnel at Nashville, the 118th Airlift Wing was one of the largest flying units in the Air National Guard at that time. Following 11 September 2001, the operational tempo increased. Over one-third of the Wing was activated for one year or more to supporting the National Homeland Security Plan (Operation Noble Eagle), which included deploying aircraft and personnel to bases inside the United States for several months, then assigned a home station alert mission. Shortly after the Wing completed the Noble Eagle mission, the Wing was selected to deploy to Southwest Asia in support CENTCOM Operations. Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom In 2003, the 118th deployed ten C-130‚Äôs and over 320 personnel to the Middle East in direct support of combat operations at the beginning of Operation Iraqi Freedom. While living in austere conditions in tents, enduring the desert heat and sand storms, the men and women of the 118th supported combat operations into and out of Baghdad and surrounding areas of Iraq. The 118th was the lead wing in establishing a bare base in support of the largest contingent of C-130‚Äôs ever based in a combat environment, over 46 C-130‚Äôs located at a single base. The unit supported CENTCOM at various locations in Iraq, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia. The unit returned home at different times in late 2003 as U.S. forces were drawn down and rotated to meet the changing requirements. In late 2003, the Wing again deployed to Uzbekistan supporting Operating Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan. BRAC 2005 and the C-130 International Training Center A 118th Airlift Wing WC-130H at Nashville in January 2010. As part of BRAC 2005, the Department of Defense was recommended to realign Berry Field Air National Guard Base. This recommendation would distribute the C-130H aircraft of the 118th Airlift Wing to the 182d Airlift Wing of the Illinois Air National Guard at Greater Peoria Airport Air National Guard Station, IL (four aircraft), and the 123d Airlift Wing of the Kentucky Air National Guard at Louisville IAP Air National Guard Station, KY (four aircraft). Flying related ECS (aerial port and fire fighters) would move to Memphis Air National Guard Base and the aeromedical squadron from Nashville would move to NAS JRB Fort Worth, TX. Other ECS would remain in place at Nashville. Nashville had a low military value ranking and was near other ANG bases keeping or gaining aircraft. In October 2007, it was announced that as an amendment to the BRAC 2005 decision, the 118 AW would continue to retain a flying mission, transitioning from an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit to that of a training organization operationally gained by the Air Education and Training Command (AETC). As the C-130 International Training Center, the 118 AW assumed a new role in support of DoD Foreign Military Sales (FMS), training up to 150 international military C-130E and C-130H flight crew and maintenance students annually. Although its C-130H2 aircraft were transferred to other Air National Guard airlift wings, the 118 AW did gain six WC-130H aircraft that had been retired from weather reconnaissance duties with the Air Force Reserve Command's 403d Wing at Keesler AFB, Mississippi. The first class of international C-130 students (from Poland) trained by the 118 AW graduated in October 2008. Shortly after transitioning to the C-130 International Training Center, the 118th Airlift Wing was again reorganized as the 118th Wing. The 118th is now tasked with supporting global unmanned aircraft intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. The wing converted to MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) during 2012.

He became the Member of Parliament for Chandpur-1 in 2008, being re-elected in 2014 and 2018, and was Minister of Home Affairs from 2011 to 2013.Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, Ministry of Home Affairs, Office of the Honorable Minister He is also a prominent economist, civil servant, and writer in Bangladesh. He taught at the university until 1965. Joining the civil service that year, he served in numerous positions, for a total of 32 years. He held several positions with the Finance Ministry, in addition to regional posts. Beginning in the late 1990s, he was appointed to political positions when the Awami League was in power. He was detained without charges and tortured during 2002. An international effort helped obtain his release. He was arrested, charged and convicted in 2007 under a military caretaker government, and imprisoned until October 2008. In addition to writing and publishing development economics textbooks and numerous articles on this topic, Alamgir published his memoir My Days in Jail (2003), which sold out three editions through the following year. Early life Alamgir was born in 1942 in Kachua, Chandpur. completed his master's in economics from the University of Dhaka. Later he earned his master's and Ph.D. in development economics from Boston University. Career Alamgir started his career joining the faculty of the Department of Economics at the University of Dhaka in 1962.In 1965 Alamgir joined the Civil Service of Pakistan. Among other posts prior to the independence of Bangladesh, he served as the subdivisional officer at Naogaon. He was serving the Pakistani government as deputy commissioner of Mymensingh when the 1971 war of liberation broke out. During Awami League rule in 1997, Alamgir was invited to join the cabinet as the State Minister for Planning. He also served stints in charge of the Civil Aviation Ministry and the Science and Technology Ministry. He was the initiator of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, which shaped Bangladesh's development policy from 1997 to 2002. On 13 September 2012, during the administration of Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, Alamgir accepted a ministerial post. Imprisonment and torture After BNP was returned to power in 2001, the party sought revenge for Alamgir's role in causing it to lose power in 1996.Muhiuddin Khan Alamgir, Jailer Kotha Manusher Kotha (My Days in Jail), Dhaka: Subarna, 2003Asian Human Rights Commission, \\"Bangladesh: Arbitrary Detention and Torture of Dr. Mohiuddin Khan Alamgir\\", 11 April 2002 The government arrested Alamgir in 2002, detaining him without charges. He was tortured while in police custody. According to the American Association for the Advancement of Science, one of the groups that fought for his release, Alamgir later reported in court that > \\"every evening at midnight, the police would enter his cell and blindfold > him. He was taken to a separate room where masked men interrogated and > tortured him. They beat him with lathi (bamboo sticks) and glass bottles > filled with water. He reported that he was beaten severely on his buttocks, > feet and other muscular parts of his body, and was sodomized with the > bottle. In addition, he was denied freshwater and his diabetes medicine. He > reported that the police demanded that he sign a typed document. When he > refused to sign, they continued to beat him.\\" A widespread international campaign pressured the government to stop the torture and to release Alamgir. Prominent politicians, such as United States Senator Edward Kennedy, United States Representative Frank Pallone, Jr., and others urged the government to release him. Professional and human rights organisations also pushed for his release, including the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Amnesty International, Asian Human Rights Commission, Committee of Concerned Scientists, New York Academy of Sciences, Organisation mondiale contre la torture (World Organisation Against Torture), 1997 Nobel Peace Prize Winners Physicians for Human Rights, Scholars at Risk, and South Asia Forum for Human Rights. Thousands of individuals from around the world wrote letters to the government about his case. The High Court disputed the government's rationale for the former minister's detention without charge; in an unprecedented step, the Court issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that it release Alamgir or risk having the High Court free him by force. The government released Alamgir on 18 September 2002, an hour before expiration of the court-ordered deadline. In December 2002 the BNP government filed a sedition case against Alamgir for his role in a widespread protest in 1996 against the elections of the previous year.\\"The Janatar Mancha Case\\", The Independent (Bangladesh), 27 December 2002 Re-imprisonment and release On 4 February 2007, Alamgir was arrested from his home by civil and military police; the government had called a state of emergency in Bangladesh. Eventually the government charged him with corruption based on a wealth statement that he was forced to write while in jail and without access to lawyers or any documents. During the trial in July 2007, seven prominent persons, including well-known economists of Bangladesh and the United States, testified to his honesty.[archive.thedailystar.net/2007/07/11/d7071101044.htm \\"Eminent persons tell court Alamgir honest\\"], The Daily Star, 11 July 2007 The summary tribunal set up by the military-led caretaker government convicted him of graft and sentenced him to 13 years imprisonment.[archive.thedailystar.net/2007/07/27/d7072701022.htm \\"MK Alamgir Handed 13 Years Over Graft\\"], The Daily Star, 27 July 2007. All in all, the government filed six cases against Alamgir between February 2007 and October 2008.The Independent (Bangladesh), 22 October 2008 On 21 October 2008, Alamgir was released on bail after being held in prison for 20 months by the military-backed caretaker government. In December 2008, the Awami League coalition won two-thirds of the seats in Parliament; Alamgir was among those elected while he was still on bail. As a result of an appeal, on 13 July 2009, the High Court overturned Alamgir's conviction and sentence.  Controversy  He faced controversy when he became the chairman of The Farmers Bank Limited while he was a government minister. Previous ministers resigned from their post to avoid conflicts of interest. When Bangladesh bank fined his bank, he as the chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on the public accounts asked Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a special audit on Bangladesh Bank.

Located on the Drzewiczka river (a tributary to the Pilica), in northwestern corner of historic province of Lesser Poland, Drzewica is home to Gerlach, a renowned cutlery manufacturer, founded in 1760 in Warsaw (since 1886 in Drzewica). In the first half of the 16th century, the Archbishop of Gniezno and Primate of Poland Maciej Drzewicki built here a rectangular-shaped castle, surrounded by a moat. The castle burned in 1814 and now is a well-preserved ruin. Castle History The town of Drzewica dates back to the 13th century, when prince Konrad I of Masovia granted the area to the Drzewicki (Cio≈Çek coat of arms) family. The family owned Drzewica for 500 years, and its properties stretched from the Pilica to the Holy Cross Mountains. In 1429 in Nieszawa, Drzewica was incorporated as a town on German town law, by King Jogaila. Drzewica, which belonged to Opoczno County of Lesser Poland‚Äôs Sandomierz Voivodeship, prospered in the early 16th century, when its owner Maciej Drzewicki (1467 ‚Äì 1535) was a personal secretary of King John I Albert. Drzewicki renovated the ancient castle, turning it from a Gothic stronghold into a Renaissance residence. Good times came to the end in 1655, when Swedish Army burned it to the ground (see Deluge (history)). In the 18th century Drzewica became one of early centers of Polish industry, when one of the first Polish blast furnaces was built here by Filip Szaniawski. Soon afterwards, northern Lesser Poland became industrialized (see Old-Polish Industrial Region). After the Partitions of Poland, Drzewica was annexed by the Russian Empire (1815), together with Congress Poland. The town was an important center of the January Uprising, and as a revenge, in 1869, Tsarist authorities reduced it to the status of a village. On September 8, 1939, a nearby forest was the place of a bloody skirmish between Polish Army and the Wehrmacht. The German occupation began that month. The Jewish population of the town was around 750. The Germans brought Jews from several neighboring villages to Drzewica so that the population increased to more than 2000. Without livelihoods and not allowed to bring personal possessions, these newcomers lived in poverty. In the autumn of 1941, Jews were forced to live in a ghetto and the severe overcrowding (eight to ten people on average shared each room) there led to epidemics of both typhus and typhoid. Police would enter the ghetto periodically to randomly murder people. In July 1942, some Jews were taken to a labor camp while the others remained in the ghetto. In October, the Germans surrounded the ghetto and lit fires around to prevent escape. The Jews were rounded up and marched to Opoczno where, a few days later, they were sent to the Treblinka killing camp where they were immediately murdered by gas. The few Jews who were left behind to sort Jewish possessions were themselves rounded up a few months later and sent to the Ujazd ghetto and from there to Treblinka. Only about five to seven Drzewica Jews are known to have survived the Holocaust.

Location  Beƒçmen is located in the western-central part of the municipality, in the Syrmia region (sub-region of Podlu≈æje, north of the Bojƒçinska woods), 6 kilometers west of its municipal seat, Surƒçin, and some 25 kilometers west of downtown Belgrade. It is located on the road which connects Petrovƒçiƒá on the west to Surƒçin on the east, and continues to the west into the province of Vojvodina (the village of Karlovƒçiƒá).  History  From the 19th century, when the area was part of Austria-Hungary, it was populated by the German settles from Bavaria, which emigrated after World War II and the village was colonized with the settlers from the central Serbia. That is why the village's football club is called ‚Äû≈†umadinac‚Äú, after ≈†umadija, region of central Serbia. Beƒçmen was known for the vast number of big mulberry trees, which spread all the way to the neighboring Petrovƒçiƒá, and for the vineyards.  Population  Beƒçmen is statistically classified as a rural settlement (village), and it had a steady population growth in the past century, except for the immediate period after World War II, due to the immigration of the German population. According to the latest Serbian census of population, Beƒçmen had a population of 3,785. Major ethnic groups by the 2002 census were the Serbs (3,214 or 94.28%), Romani (60 or 1.76%), Montenegrins (21 or 0.61%) and Macedonians (19 or 0.55%).

They are rich in carp, Prussian carp, pike, zander, grass carp, silver carp and catfish. Apart from fishing, the water skiing is organized.  Oaza sports complex  Area of Beƒçmen has been chosen as a location of the future largest golf courses in the Balkans, which is with the projected value of ‚Ç¨800 million in the next 11 years one of the largest foreign investments in Serbia. It is projected that in the next six years a large course with 18 holes and two smaller ones with 9 holes will be built, while the entire complex on will be finished in 11 years and also include ambulance, open kindergarten, five star hotel complex, golf club, service buildings, business center, residential complex with 5,000 apartments but also a cricket field, basketball, tennis, volleyball and handball courts, bowling alley and bocce court. An artificial lake which will separate the courses from the residential area will be also created. The entire \\"Oaza\\" (oasis) complex will be encircled with of woods and pedestrian and bicycle paths which will connect it to the left bank of the Sava river. \\"Oaza\\" will be away from Belgrade and its construction will include a new long access road from Dobanovci. However, nothing has been done in those next 11 years, and in September 2019 the US-Austrian-Israeli consortium behind the project announced that only now the ownership problems with the land were solved, that drafting of the detailed regulatory plan begins and that works will start in 2020, starting with the large, 18 holes course.

The organization is a certified 501(c), non-profit. The organization's main purpose is to bring the attention of the international community's attention to the present-day political situation in Sindh, Pakistan's southeastern province. History The WSI is a relatively new organization founded on March 14, 1997. It was established by members of the Sindhi diaspora and continues to hire new contributors, members and volunteers through donations. Political goals The WSI favors genuine federalism and provincial autonomy based on the original covenant between the provinces of Pakistan, namely the Muslim League Lahore Resolution of 1940, which was the basis for the establishment for the state of Pakistan. This resolution envisaged full provincial autonomy for each of the federating units allowing the center to have control of currency, foreign affairs and defence related communication. Over the last 60 years since Pakistan achieved independence from British Rule, there has been a steady decline in the autonomy of the provinces with a corresponding increase in the powers of the central government; resistance to a strong center and promotion of Sindh's legitimate rights of self governance, linguistic and cultural rights has been the hallmark of the WSI's goals.

If activated to federal service, elements of the Wing are gained by the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command and Air Combat Command. Overview The mission of the 119th Wing both reconnaissance and airlift. The 178th Reconnaissance Squadron includes operations of the MQ-1 Predator. The MQ-1 Predator is a medium-altitude, long-endurance, remotely piloted aircraft. The 177th Airlift Squadron accomplishes several missions including Operational Support Airlift (OSA), transportation of distinguished visitors, and a responsive aeromedical airlift system to move eligible patients. Units The 119th Wing is composed of the following units: * 119th Operations Group : 177th Airlift Squadron : 178th Reconnaissance Squadron * 119th Maintenance Group * 119th Mission Support Group * 119th Medical Group * 219th Security Forces Squadron (Minot AFB, ND) History An F-89J in the 1960s. The F-102A was flown only from 1966 to 1969. F-101B Voodoos in the 1970s. Tu-95 off Iceland, 1983. 177th Airlift Squadron C-21 Learjet in Iraq, 2009 On 1 July 1955, the North Dakota Air National Guard 178th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was authorized to expand to a group level, and the 119th Fighter Group (Air Defense) was established by the National Guard Bureau. The 178th FIS becoming the group's flying squadron. Other squadrons assigned into the group were the 119th Headquarters, 119th Material Squadron (Maintenance), 119th Combat Support Squadron, and the 119th USAF Dispensary. The \\"Happy Hooligan\\" pilots were upgraded by ADC to the F-89 Scorpion in 1958, being one of the last units to fly the aircraft in 1966 when it received the supersonic F-102A Delta Dagger interceptor in 1966. It was again upgraded in 1969 to the F-101B Voodoo interceptor. In 1979, Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM) was merged into Tactical Air Command (ADTAC) and the unit continued its air defense mission for ADTAC component of TAC with the F-4D Phantom II, transferring to First Air Force when ADTAC was replaced in 1985. The first overseas deployment of the North Dakota Air Guard occurred in 1983, with six F-4s and 120 support personnel deploying to NAS Keflavik, Iceland. Eight Soviet Tupolev Tu-95 \\"Bear\\" bombers were intercepted by Hooligan pilots during the deployment. In 1986, the 119th Fighter Group became the first core unit to assume the USAF Zulu alert mission at Ramstein Air Base, West Germany. Referred to as \\"Creek Klaxon\\", the 119th and other Air Defense units rotated to Ramstein and stood continuous alert for one year, providing air sovereignty in Western Europe for NATO. During Operation Desert Storm in 1991, 107 Happy Hooligans were mobilized and deployed in support of operations at numerous CONUS locations. The 178th FS converted from the F-4 Phantom to the F-16A/B Fighting Falcon in mid-1990. The first aircraft were older block 5 and 10 models with some block 15 aircraft also being delivered to the squadron. Main task for the unit was air defense, as with many ANG units who were equipped with the F-16. In 1991 the F-16s were brought up to the Air Defense Fighter (ADF) variant. This meant a serious leap in performance and capability of this squadron in their defensive role. The Hooligans earned first place at the October 1994 William Tell competition, a worldwide weapons meet which tests pilots and ground crews from the U.S. Air Force's top units in realistic, air-to-air combat situations. This was the Hooligans third William Tell victory, winning in 1970, 1972, and 1994, in addition to placing first among F-4 William Tell units in 1986. In 1994 the NDANG won the prestigious Hughes Trophy which recognizes the most outstanding air-to-air unit in the U.S. Air Force. The only Air National Guard unit to win the award twice, the Hooligans are also the only F-16 unit to ever win the Hughes Trophy. A permanent alert detachment was established at Kingsley Field, Oregon, beginning 1 October 1989. The detachment, staffed by 18 members, was relocated to March Air Force Base, California, in July 1994 when the Oregon ANG took over full operation of Kingsley. An announcement was made in March 1999 that the squadron would convert from an air defense mission to a general purpose mission with 15 F-16A/B aircraft while activating an alert detachment at Langley AFB, Virginia. Current status In its 2005 BRAC Recommendations, DoD recommended to realign the mission of the North Dakota Air National Guard. The 119th Fighter Wing's F-16As (15 aircraft) would retire, with the aircraft reaching the end of their operational life. The reduction in F-16 force structure and the need to align common versions of the F-16 at the same bases argued for realigning the 119th Fighter Wing to allow its aircraft to retire without a flying mission backfill. In Jan 2007, the 119th officially retired the F-16 mission after 60 years of successful air defense interceptor missions. Replacing the F-16s in 2007, the squadron began to receive the C-21A Learjet, being re-designated as an Airlift Squadron. The C-21 has with room for eight VIP passengers and 42 ft¬≥ (1.26 m¬≥) of cargo. In addition to its normal role, the aircraft is capable of transporting litters during medical evacuations. Later in 2007, it was announced that C-21 operations would be transferred to the newly activated ND ANG 177th Airlift Squadron, and the 179th would convert to the MQ-1 Predator, being re- designated as a Reconnaissance Squadron. In 2008 the first Predator was received. In 2009, the 177th Airlift Squadron deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. It was the first deployment into a combat zone for the North Dakota Air National Guard. The squadron transported more than 400 service members during their two-month-long rotation in theater. They accomplished this by flying more than 200 sorties during 90 missions, as part of the 379th Expeditionary Operations Group. In 2013, the squadron is programmed to receive the twin-turboprop C-27J Spartan medium transport aircraft.

The band consists of John Sharkey III on vocals/guitar, Karen Horner on 6-string bass guitar, and Richie Charles Jr on drums. The trio has drawn comparisons to The Birthday Party, Big Black, Bauhaus, Flipper and even harsh noise band Whitehouse. Their influences have been cited as including Crucifucks, Modern English, Cro-Mags, GG Allin, Neil Young and the first Skrewdriver LP. Formed in summer 2003, Clockcleaner released an LP called The Hassler on the now defunct Philadelphia label Manic Ride Records. The album echoed early 1990s noise rock, with high pitch guitar sonics and a thumping bass sound. After touring for the EP, original bass guitarist Warren Slegel was fired from the band, and was replaced in the studio by John Sharkey. In early 2006, they released a 7\\" on Baltimore's Noise/Avant label Hit-Dat Records (\\"Missing Dick\\" b/w Crucifucks' cover \\"By the Door\\"). Soon to follow was their second LP, released on another Baltimore label, Reptilian Records. The album was called Nevermind (a sarcastic ode to Nirvana's 1991 release). The record was allegedly recorded while Sharkey was under a state of bi- lateral amnesia from a car accident in the summer of 2005. John Sharkey has insisted that the title was a joke to annoy people (he has even gone so far as to call Nirvana \\"dogshit\\" in a Dusted magazine interview in 2007): Nevermind was a departure from the band's punk sound, having more in common with many of the mid-to-late '90s Siltbreeze bands such as Harry Pussy and The Dead C. After the album was recorded Karen Horner became the permanent bassist. Her first show with Clockcleaner was opening for The Melvins. The album did well with many critics and in late 2006 the group signed to Load Records. In fall 2007, their third full-length release Babylon Rules was issued on the Load label. The record was different from any other release to date in that it channeled a more gothic influence in its sound while still retaining its punk aesthetics. It was widely received by the independent music community as the band toured extensively during fall 2007 in support of Babylon Rules in the US, playing mainly with acts championed by the band, such as Mika Miko, The Lamps and The Homostupids. This record put the band at the forefront of the new wave of hateful noisy music without painting them in the corner of repetition. This was also one of the first major releases to bring skull music to the attention of popular audiences, a genre the band ‚Äî as well as the Homostupids ‚Äî has championed since its inception. Both acts have been asked about this 'genre' but have been largely evasive. Sharkey offered in jest that skull music was \\"the antithetical musical equivalent of coming out of the closet\\" in many articles published in 2008. In late spring 2008, singer and vocalist Sharkey moved to Melbourne, Australia, leaving the band in the lurch but not before a legendary performance at Brooklyn's Southpaw Club, opening for hardcore stalwarts Negative Approach. In flippant response to opening for a band trying to cash in on former successes, the band, directly before Negative Approach came on stage, performed a fifteen-minute slowed down, sludge version of the Negative Approach classic \\"Ready To Fight\\" that went on to incite crowd violence during and after the band's set. Vocal reactions were a mixed affair but a quote was offered from Negative Approach drummer Chris \\"Opie\\" Moore: \\"That was great, I've seen Flipper in their heyday but I've never seen a band piss off a crowd like that before.\\" This performance was captured and released as a one-sided 12\\" on the Fan Death Records imprint from Baltimore, Maryland.

Los Pargos, meaning \\"the snapper\\", is the name of the town closest to Playa Negra. It is south of Avellanas and north of Junquillal. It is accessed from Santa Cruz through 27 de Abril and then Paraiso. Businesses and infrastructure Los Pargos the town closest to Playa Negra offers several restaurants, from the now famous Peruvian food at Cafe Playa Negra, French cuisine at Villa DeVeena, Mexican food at Jalape√±o Taco Grill, a pizza parlour known as La Vida Buena, organic food from Cafe La Ventana, and a beachfront restaurant at the Hotel Playa Negra among others. There are a couple art galleries, Johnny Manana's Surf Art Gallery & Studio next door to Cafe La Ventana and Lula's in the Rocky Point Shopping Center. There are also a few private homes in the commercial center of the town as well as the many homes dotted on the beaches and in residential communities. There is a mini market right across from the street from the Cafe Playa Negra with very basic amenities, one at the soccer field, one at the entrance of the town and another one next to the teak farm called Las Tecas. There is also a private skate park called El Mutante, an attorney's office and real estate office. There are several small shops, shops for surfing-related souvenirs, surf camp, surf rentals, ding repair shop, yoga centers, two mechanics, a Pentecostal church, and various cabinas and hotels. Los Pargos has developed to be a growing town with many outdoors activities that include two adventure tours shops, one at each end of town. The infrastructure in Los Pargos has changed considerably over the last years. Culverts were added to all the creek beds. Bridges have been built over the rivers. There were 20\\" of rock base added to the road in 2010. The previous ensure that the area roads stay passable through most of the year. Los Pargos also has internet serviced by a Fiber-optic network with the potential for download speeds of up to 20Mbit/s. There is telephone and some 3G cellular signal. The entire town is serviced by electricity. Water comes from individual artesian wells on each property. However, a public water system is in the works and slated to be finished and ready for use in early 2019. Surf Playa Negra is home to the surfing break known worldwide since being featured in Bruce Brown's movie Endless Summer II. However, there are many accounts of individuals who surfed Playa Negra long before the movie came out. Some claim to have been here in the 1970s. This beach is considered by many surfers to be one of the top spots in Costa Rica. It has become famous in part to its ease of access apart from its quality as a surfing wave. Playa Negra has a rock reef bottom with good right-hand barrels and a well defined channel for paddling out. This channel also assists surfers to return to the point where the wave breaks. There is a strong rip current that takes the surfers back through the impact zone. Depending on the swell direction and tides a left breaking wave may also be surfed. The break has good exposure to both Northern and Southern Hemisphere swells and is reasonably consistent year-round. The wave can break well with large and small swells. The 2012 Costa Rica earthquake lifted up the entire plate which caused the wave to have better form on higher tides in combination with smaller swells. It may also produce good surfing waves during the entire tide range. On a lower tide the wave breaks faster and hollower due to the earthquake. Nature and wildlife Playa Negra is located in a tropical dry forest. There are six months of dry season and six months of wet season. The dry season is from November to May and the wet from May to October. There are myriad tropical terrestrial species of animals that live in this zone including the mantled howler monkey, white-nosed coati, variegated squirrel, and jaguarundi. There are also myriad species of oceanic animals that come to this beach including the humpback whale, roosterfish, Pacific dogtooth snapper, mahi- mahi, sailfish, skipjack tuna, and the green sea turtle. There have been over 700 insect species and over 200 bird species officially recorded in the area.

Jasb Rural District () is a rural district (dehestan) in the Central District of Delijan County, Markazi Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 1,373, in 552 families. The rural district has 7 villages. It is located 15 km NE of Delijan, in Iran. History The history of Jasb can be traced back to the Sassanid era. The story told by the village elders is that during the reign of Shah Ardeshir I, the Shah's cavalry were led into the greener pastures of the valley so that the horses could graze on the abundant greenery and could also drink from the Azna stream. Gradually as the visits from the cavalry became more frequent it was decided that nine shelters would be built in the valley so that the herders of the horses could stay overnight at various places. Eventually these nine shelters became permanently inhabited by the herders and their families and slowly grew into villages of their own. During the 2,000 years of permanent occupation two of the shelters were abandoned due to an inability of growing food on the nearby land, one of these was located west of Kerogan and some traces are still visible, the other was located downstream of Bijegan and due to the periodic flooding of the river all traces have been washed away. As time passed and only seven villages remained which they do until this day. The first structures were built close to the Qanats so that there would be a constant water supply to the fields and for household use, as the villages grew in size the construction of buildings occurred on stone built terraces, which sloped sharply towards the river, since the river could flood quickly during heavy rains much time and labour was devoted to the maintenance of damaged terraces. Usually the houses would be built uphill from the river and the fields grown on the terraces downhill towards the river. Geography These villages are all located at the bottom of the Jasb valley. The valley itself is fed by the solitary Azna river which receives most of its water from the runoff of surrounding Qanats; the valley is surrounded by mountains which form a U-Shaped range, the highest peak is the Kuh-e-Velijeya rising to 3233 metres (10604 feet). Other noticeable peaks that rise over 3000 metres are in order Kuh-e-Gorg, Kuh-e-Ghalid 3155 metres (10352 feet), Kuh-e-Palangast 3135 metres (10286 feet), Kuh-e-Salahlat 3055 metres (10024 feet); however, these mountains rise from a valley level of 2200 metres. Lifestyle The villages in Jasb are traditional Iranian rural farming villages. The farms are irrigated through a system of open aqueducts which are fed by waters of the nearby Qanats. The waters of the qanats are used during summer and spring when farming is at its most active. During the bitter cold months of winter when temperatures can reach as low as -30 ¬∞C with several metres of snow falling, no farming is undertaken as the cold weather does not allow any plant life to grow. Persian Carpet making is next in importance to farming and throughout the years there have been hundreds of precious carpets made by the local women population. Unknown to the newer generations, during the hard, cold winters, the residence of Jasb used to help one another under the supervision of Hossein Sokeneh Akbari. Sokeneh's person was ungainly. He was six feet five inches in height; a little stooped in the shoulders; his feet and hands large; and distinguished nose. His eyes were brown . Generally, he was a kind, loyal man, and his countenance indicated it. His face was radiant and glowing, and almost gave expression to his thoughts before his tongue would utter them. He was a just listener, and had the faculty of making himself clearly understood. Population The total population for these seven villages is currently around 5900, however this figure is currently decreasing as more of the youth abandon the rural life and head for the larger cities like Tehran and Isfahan. The main population center is located at Kerogan, which is the largest of the seven villages, followed in size by Bijegan. The overall majority of the population of Jasb follow the Shia Muslim religion but in the past there were many followers of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. At one point during the 1950s more than half of the population in Kerogan were Bah√° º√≠s. The other village which had a few Bah√° º√≠ families is Vesquneqan. During the month of Ramadan in 1955, Sheikh Mohammad Taqi Falsafi, a populist preacher, started one of the highest-profile anti-Bah√° º√≠ propaganda schemes in Iran. After receiving permission from the Shah to state anti-Bah√° º√≠ rhetoric in his sermons, he encouraged other clergy to discuss the Bah√° º√≠ issue in their sermons. These sermons caused mob violence against Bah√° º√≠s; Bah√° º√≠ properties were destroyed, their livestock stolen or killed, the√≠r centres looted, the√≠r cemeteries desecrated, Bah√° º√≠s were killed, some hacked to pieces, Bah√° º√≠ women were abducted and forced to marry Muslims, and Bah√° º√≠s were expelled and dismissed from schools and employment. Due to the increasing amount of persecution suffered by the Bah√° º√≠s at the hands of the Muslim majority, they were left with no choice than to abandon their lifestyle and dwellings, in search of a better life in Tehran.

POYi Archive  In 2008, POYi and the University of Missouri's School of Information Science and Learning Technologies began a collaborative project to create a Web platform to host the digital archive of all the winning photographs in POYi's collection. The Archive was launched in September 2008 and uses the Omeka content management system. The POYi Archive contains more than 40,000 photographs.  History  Pictures of the Year International began as a news photography contest in the spring of 1944 when University of Missouri professor Clifton C. Edom and his wife, Vi, founded the First Annual Fifty-Print Exhibition contest. Its stated purpose was \\"to pay tribute to those press photographers and newspapers which, despite tremendous war-time difficulties, are doing a splendid job; to provide an opportunity for photographers of the nation to meet in open competition; and to compile and preserve ... a collection of the best in current, home-front press pictures.\\" During that first year of the contest, 60 photographers entered 223 prints. In 1945 the Edoms also founded the College Photographer of the Year contest, and in 1949 they launched the Missouri Photo Workshop. In 1948, following a decision to invite magazine photographers to participate, the Fifty-Print Exhibition Contest became the \\"ews Pictures of the Year Contest. Then, in 1957, the University of Missouri and the National Press Photographers Association (NPPA) merged their respective contests. Through this partnership, Pictures of the Year continued until 2001 when NPPA and Missouri parted ways. POYi is now administered by the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute at the Missouri School of Journalism. Guided by former directors Angus McDougall, Bill Kuykendall, and David Rees, the scope of Pictures of the Year changed dramatically between the 1970s and 2000. The number of entered images increased to tens of thousands, and in 2001 Pictures of the Year became an international program ‚Äî Pictures of the Year International. In 2006, POYi became a program of the Donald W. Reynolds Journalism Institute and named Rick Shaw as its full-time director.

It connects U.S. Route 2 (US 2) at the eastern end of the Hewitt Avenue Trestle to the city of Lake Stevens, terminating at a junction with SR 9\\\\. The highway runs for a total length of and passes through several suburban neighborhoods. The Everett‚ÄìLake Stevens road was originally added to the state highway system in 1937 as part of Secondary State Highway 15A (SSH 15A), which continued northeasterly to Granite Falls. The modern highway was built in 1954 and designated as SR 204 a decade later during the 1964 state highway renumbering, while the eastern half of SSH 15A became SR 92\\\\. Since then, suburban development in the area has necessitated planning for the reconstruction of the SR 9 intersection into a full interchange. Route description The highway's eastern terminus, a junction with SR 9 at Frontier Village in Lake Stevens SR 204 begins in Cavalero Corner at an interchange with US 2 at the east end of the Hewitt Avenue Trestle, which crosses Ebey Island and connects the highway to Everett. The interchange has direct ramps connecting SR 204 to westbound US 2 and an intersection for traffic heading east on 20th Street Southeast and southeast on US 2 towards Snohomish. The highway ascends from the Snohomish River estuary and runs northeasterly along the edge of several suburban neighborhoods before entering the city of Lake Stevens. SR 204 has few intersections with cross streets and is primarily a three-lane road with one westbound lane and two eastbound lanes. After crossing under a set of transmission lines near Market Place, the highway widens to four lanes and enters the Frontier Village commercial district. SR 204 terminates in the center of the district at a junction with SR 9, which continues north to Arlington and south to Snohomish. SR 204 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey on state highways to measure traffic volume in terms of average annual daily traffic. Average traffic volumes on the highway in 2016 ranged from a minimum of 5,800 vehicles at its interchange with US 2 to a maximum of 38,000 after the interchange. A section west of Frontier Village had an average volume of 21,000 vehicles in 2016. The entire route is also designated as a MAP-21 principal arterial route under the National Highway System. History Looking eastbound on SR 204 from its western terminus The original route of the Pacific Highway between Everett and the rest of northwestern Washington ran across Ebey Island and turned north onto Sunnyside Boulevard at Cavalero Corner before continuing into Marysville. Vernon Road, constructed in the 1910s and paved in 1916, branched off from Sunnyside Boulevard at the bottom of Cavalero Hill and traveled northeasterly along the shore of Lake Stevens to the settlement of Hartford. The Pacific Highway was moved in the late 1920s to a more direct route traversing set of new bridges across the Snohomish River estuary, while the Ebey Island road itself was replaced by the completed Hewitt Avenue Trestle in 1936. Vernon Road was added to the reformed state highway system in 1937 as part of Secondary State Highway 15A (SSH 15A), connecting Primary State Highway 15 (PSH 15) with SSH 1A in Lake Stevens and the city of Granite Falls. SSH 15A was moved onto a new highway bypassing Vernon Road in 1954, ahead of work to rebuild the interchange with PSH 15 (by then part of US 2). During the state legislature's 1964 renumbering of the state highway system, SSH 15A was split into two routes: SR 204 from Cavalero Corner to SSH 1A; and SR 92 from northwestern Lake Stevens to Granite Falls. SSH 1A was renumbered to SR 9, which had been relocated in the 1950s to a new road that cut through the Frontier Village commercial district. The current interchange at Cavalero Corner between US 2 and SR 204 was opened in 1969 as part of the expansion of the Hewitt Avenue Trestle. Major suburban development in the Lake Stevens area began in the 1980s, bringing increased traffic on SR 204 and the Hewitt Avenue Trestle. An eastbound truck climbing lane was installed on the highway in 1988. An expansion of the US 2 interchange was completed in 1993, including an onramp from eastbound US 2 to eastbound SR 204, as part of a $100 million project to replace the Hewitt Avenue Trestle. The highway's intersection with Market Place in Frontier Village was reconstructed in 2004 as part of several city- funded improvements in the area. The state legislature's 2015 Connecting Washington budget and 2016 supplementary budget funded two studies into potential improvements to both termini on SR 204 to address traffic congestion. The Frontier Village junction with SR 9 was planned to rebuilt as a diamond interchange, with an overpass for SR 204, that was estimated to cost $69.5 million. In early 2019, WSDOT announced that it would re-examine an earlier concept to use roundabouts to manage the intersection at a lower cost compared to the chosen interchange option. The agency had begun subsurface investigations and discovered shallow groundwater that would impede construction of the SR 9 underpass. Another earlier concept had suggested the addition of grade-separated ramps to the current intersection. A separate study into rebuilding the US 2 interchange was completed in 2018 and recommended reconfiguration of its ramps to eliminate the current one-lane merge.

The Court found that, although the state had eliminated explicit prohibitions on the admission of black students to institutions including the University of Mississippi, Mississippi State University, and the University of Southern Mississippi, the Court of Appeals had not properly reviewed the set of discriminatory policies used by the state to suppress black enrollment at these schools. On this point, the Court stated that \\"[i]f the State perpetuates policies and practices traceable to its prior system that continue to have segregative effects - whether by influencing student enrollment decisions or by fostering segregation in other facets of the university system - and such policies are without sound educational justification and can be practicably eliminated, the State has not satisfied its burden of proving that it has dismantled its prior system.\\". Four opinions were filed in the case. In addition to Justice White's majority opinion, Justice O'Connor and Justice Thomas filed concurring opinions. Thomas, in particular, expressed a concern that the strict review of policies that divided students by race should not be used against historically black universities in the state. Justice Scalia filed a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part, expressing his disagreement with the burden that the Court imposed on universities and his concern that the standards set forth by the Court would create confusion and lead to more litigation.

In particular, it hosts the American Crocodile, which draws tourists to the estuary. The river estuary is a popular place for surfing despite the local caiman population. The river is a major obstacle to reaching Playa Grande from Tamarindo. References Rivers of Costa Rica ","title":"Tamarindo River"},{"id":"9586657","text":"The former O&M; line in Osgood, Indiana.

Belin was a partner in a Des Moines, Iowa law firm and, with former NBC News president Michael Gartner, was co-owner of The Tribune in Ames, Iowa. Early life Belin was born in Washington, D.C. and raised in Sioux City, Iowa. Notable actions Belin served the Jewish community in many leadership positions. A successful businessman, Belin owned a number of Midwestern publications. Government service Belin served in the United States Army in Korea and in Japan. He was a concert violinist for a period of his service. Belin, David William (June 20, 1928‚ÄìJanuary 17, 1999) Belin served as staff counsel to the Warren Commission, which investigated President John F. Kennedy's assassination. The Commission‚Äôs report concluded that Lee Harvey Oswald acted entirely on his own as Kennedy's assassin. Belin was hired by Lee Rankin, chief counsel to the Commission, who assigned a team of two lawyers to each of the major areas for investigation. Belin and Joe Ball, a criminal defense lawyer from Los Angeles, shared the important task of investigating Oswald‚Äôs activities during the assassination. As their work progressed, Belin focused his efforts on trying to prove that a second shooter had participated in the assassination, but detailed work by the FBI and analysis of the Zapruder film suggested that all of the shots that hit President Kennedy and Texas Governor John Connally originated from Oswald‚Äôs position in the book depository.Willens, HWPUR, pp. 85-87. At Robert Kennedy‚Äôs insistence, Chief Justice Earl Warren personally reviewed the evidence relating to President Kennedy‚Äôs medical treatment and autopsy.Willens, HWPUR, pp. 193-94. Because the photos were so gruesome, Warren prevented the staff attorneys from using the autopsy evidence to corroborate the testimony of medical witnesses. Belin described this decision as ‚Äúdisastrous‚Äù because it ‚Äúgave rise to wild speculation and rumor‚Äù about the President‚Äôs injuries. Belin believed that the Kennedy family‚Äôs desire for privacy was outweighed by the public‚Äôs need to know the facts about the assassination. In January 1975, President Gerald Ford, a former Warren Commission member, appointed Belin to serve as executive director of the Rockefeller Commission, which investigated illegal activities of the Central Intelligence Agency. Belin led the Rockefeller Commission‚Äôs effort to investigate and publicize the CIA‚Äôs program to assassinate foreign officials. Under pressure from Belin, the CIA turned over records demonstrating the existence of these secret activities. When members of the Commission, including Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, objected to further investigation, Belin used favorable press coverage to convince the Commission to allow him to continue. Key CIA officials then testified about the agency‚Äôs plans from 1960 to 1964 to assassinate Fidel Castro ‚Äì plans that had not been disclosed to the Warren Commission.Willens, HWPUR, pp. 310-13. Based on this evidence, Belin prepared a draft chapter for the commission‚Äôs report, but both Rockefeller and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger successfully opposed publication of this chapter. Belin was upset about this decision, but the evidence that he collected provided important support for the groundbreaking work of the Church Committee in 1975 and 1976.Belin, Final Disclosure, pp. 163-65. Responding to Oliver Stone‚Äôs movie ‚ÄúJFK,‚Äù Belin delivered a major defense of the Commission‚Äôs work in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on March 26, 1992. He described ‚Äúthe lies, omissions, misrepresentations, and manufactured facts‚Äù in the film, and characterized Stone‚Äôs work as an effort to impeach the integrity of Earl Warren, ‚Äúa great Chief Justice.‚Äù Belin also noted the massive amount of money spent by film studios and television networks to generate controversy and profits ‚Äúas they rewrite the truth‚Äù about the Kennedy assassination.Willens, HWPUR, pp. 332-33. Belin wrote two books on the JFK Assassination: November 22, 1963: You Are the Jury (1973) and Final Disclosure: The Full Truth About the Assassination of President Kennedy (1988). Belin stood by the findings of the Warren Commission‚Äôs report until his death, and was known to become incensed at any mention of an assassination conspiracy. As he lay in a coma in his final days, his friends would whisper conspiracy theories about the JFK assassination into his ear to confirm his unconsciousness by his unprecedented lack of response. Belin Lectureship In 1991, Belin established the David W. Belin Lectureship in American Jewish Affairs at his alma mater the University of Michigan as an academic forum for the discussion of contemporary Jewish life in the United States. Belin graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Literature, Science and the Arts, Business School and Law School. Past Belin lecturers have included Egon Mayer, Stephen J. Whitfeld, Arthur Green, Deborah Dash Moore, Alvin Rosenfeld, Paula Hyman, Jeffrey S. Gurock, Arnold Eisen, Sylvia Barack Fishman, Jonathan Sarna, Hasia Diner, Susan Martha Kahn, Riv-Ellen Prell, Andrew Heinze, and Fred Lazin. The Belin lectures have been published annually by the University of Michigan Frankel Center for Judaic Studies. Later years and death Belin lived in Windsor Heights, Iowa and on Manhattan's East Side. In January 1999, he sustained head injuries in a fall in a Rochester, Minnesota hotel room. Belin was in a coma before dying twelve days later on January 17.

Playing career Wright was selected by Collingwood in the 1987 National Draft with their first round pick (no.3 overall) as a quick wingman, having shown great courage for Tasmanian side Devonport. Making his debut in 1988, Wright took his time to prove his value as a first-round draftee but in 1990 he had a fantastic year which saw him rise in ranking amongst the top wingmen in the league. Wright finished 2nd in the Brownlow Medal to Tony Liberatore by one vote in 1990, and would then finish equal 3rd in the Copeland Trophy. Perhaps more importantly, Wright was a valuable member of the 1990 premiership side. Wright would also represent Tasmania in State football. A shock came to coach Leigh Matthews and players at the end of 1991 when Wright announced he wanted to return to Tasmania to play football, but was talked out of it by Matthews. In 1993 he was a victim of a disease which threatened his playing career, but he recovered in the pre- season to continue playing his damaging football on the wing. Consistent football followed in the mid-1990s before suffering a knee injury in 1996 against Richmond where he would require a knee reconstruction. Following the season-ending injury, his main asset of pace was severely affected, and would play out his career in defence where his courage gave him an edge.

The play has been called \\"a capital little comedy, fairly bubbling over with clever situations, and charming character.\\"Nason, p. 263. The Opportunity was licensed for performance by Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels, on 29 November 1634. It was acted by Shirley's regular company, Queen Henrietta's Men, at the Cockpit Theatre. The 1640 quarto was dedicated by Shirley to a personal friend, Capt. Richard Owen. Shirley relied on El Castigo del Pens√©que by Tirso de Molina as his source for the plot of his play. The 1640 quarto was printed by Thomas Cotes for the booksellers Andrew Crooke and William Cooke. The play was popular, and was revived early in the Restoration era, in November 1660. During the Interregnum when the theatres were closed, material from The Opportunity was extracted and performed as a droll called The Price of Conceit, published in The Wits in 1672.Forsythe, p. 34. Synopsis Aurelio Andreozzi is a young gentleman from Milan. He comes to visit Urbino with his friend Pisauro. One in Urbino, Aurelio discovers that he is being mistaken for a man named Borgia, the son of an elderly aristocrat named Mercutio. As a lark, Aurelio allows the misapprehension to persist. It's a potentially serious situation: though recalled from banishment, Borgia has powerful potential enemies--he was accused of having murdered a brother of Ursini, the favorite of Urbino's ruling Duchess. Borgia also has a beautiful sister called Cornelia, a waiting woman to the Duchess--with whom Aurelio quickly falls in love. Ursini, however, also loves Cornelia; to gain her favor he forgives her \\"brother,\\" Borgia/Aurelio, and obtains a pardon for him from the Duchess. But Ursini also wants \\"Borgia\\" to give his blessing to his suit of Cornelia--a galling circumstance for Aurelio. Compounding the problem, Cornelia is in love with Aurelio, but is repulsed by what she thinks is the unnatural nature of her feelings. The Duchess, too, is enamored of Borgia/Aurelio, to the displeasure of her courtiers; and she is a beautiful and desirable woman who can make her husband a duke. Both Cornelia and Ursini react with jealousy at the Duchess's interest in Aurelio. Also displeased is the \\"ambassador\\" from Ferrara, who has been negotiating a potential marriage between his Duke and the Duchess of Urbino. (This \\"ambassador\\" is in fact the Duke of Ferrara himself.) The complications come to a head in the play's balcony scene. In the night, below the balcony, stands Aurelio; unknown to him, the Duke of Ferrara watches from behind. Above, on the balcony, Cornelia pretends to be the Duchess; she tells Aurelio not to rely on her favor--\\"she\\" plans to marry the Duke. The Duke, of course, is delighted with this, and leaves. The Duchess comes upon this scene, and supplants Cornelia on the balcony; she in turn pretends to be Cornelia, and in this guise asks Aurelio to bless \\"her\\" marriage, that is Cornelia's marriage, with Ursini. Aurelio, thinking that he will lose both women, asserts his true identity: he tells \\"Cornelia\\" that he is not her brother, and asks her to love him for himself. The false Cornelia, surprised, gives him a little encouragement, but leaves him still in doubt. Next morning, the Duchess tells Aurelio that she will help him to any Urbinese bride he fancies, even \\"the proudest, greatest in our duchy, without all limitations.\\" Before they can come to an understanding, Cornelia enters to announce the Duke, who thinks he has the Duchess's agreement to marry him. The Duchess, of course, denies giving any such promise, and Cornelia confesses her part in the masquerade and the misunderstanding. Further misunderstandings ensue, however, with a misdirected love letter; in the end, the Duchess accepts the Duke and Cornelia accepts Ursini, and the befuddled Aurelio leaves Urbino to resume his travels. The Opportunity also has a comic subplot, which involves Aurelio's servant Pimponio and a page. NotesReferences * Forsythe, Robert Stanley. The Relations of Shirley's Plays to the Elizabethan Drama.

She was, along with Harvey Sacks and Emanuel Schegloff, one of the founders of the area of research known as conversation analysis (CA). She is remembered for the methods and notational conventions she developed for transcribing talk. The Jefferson Transcription System used widely in CA research is named after her.  Early life  Jefferson was born on April 22, 1938 in Iowa City. Her family then moved to New York for a short period before moving to Los Angeles, where she spent most of her educational years, attending high school, then UCLA. In 1965, she received a Bachelors of Arts degree in Dance from UCLA. She would go on to complete a PhD in Social Sciences at UC Irvine in 1972. She had temporary appointments at the Universities of Pennsylvania, the University of Massachusetts Amherst and at several University of California campuses (UCSB, UCI and UCLA). After these temporary positions, Jefferson began a more permanent research position at the University of Manchester where she worked from 1978 to 1981. There, she used her methods of transcription in a project with John R.E. Lee titled, \\"conversations in which 'troubles' and 'anxieties' are expressed\\". Four years after her position in the UK, she traveled to Tilburg, Netherlands (1981‚Äì1983) where she became a research associate with Konrad Ehlich. Together, they worked on a project involving overlap and interpretation. In 1984, she returned to the UK and began an honorary position at the University of York. She moved back to the Netherlands in 1987 and married Albert Stuulen. She remained there until she died in Rinsumageest, The Netherlands, in 2008 at the age of 69.  Conversation Analysis  Jefferson's work in conversation analysis began as a part of her coursework in a class she took in the spring of 1965 that was taught by Harvey Sacks. She enrolled in the class to fulfill her graduation requirement for her dance major. She had learned basic transcription skills through her work as a clerk typist at the UCLA Department of Public Health and her experience and work there in transcribing sensitivity-training sessions for prison guards. This gave her the experience that allowed her to begin transcribing some of the recordings that served as the materials out of which Sacks‚Äô earliest lectures were developed. She transcribed many of his lectures on the topic and edited and released them after his death. Later she did graduate work under his supervision, by which time she was already beginning to shape the field conceptually as well as through her transcriptions of the really fine details of interaction, including the detail of laughter, capturing as closely as possible precisely what is said and how it is said, rather than glossing things in the talk as, for instance ((S laughs)). Along with Sacks and Schegloff, Jefferson is also known for her studies of turn-taking in conversation. While working with Sacks, Jefferson‚Äôs contribution to the study of Conversational Analysis was particularly significant at the time, as Conversational Analysis was not only a new field in sociology but also indicated the beginning of the focus on micro-sociology, another subtopic within the field of sociology. Jefferson directed her main focus toward two key foundational aspects of interaction which were moment-by-moment shaping interaction, and re-shaping interaction. Her contributions toward these two types of interaction, in addition to her explanation of how interaction correlates with unpredictability, are what separated her benefactions from other sociologists within the field of Conversational Analysis. During the last ten years of her life, Jefferson worked on transcribing the Watergate tapes. The Watergate tapes were composed of 22 transcripts of 37th President Richard Nixon's conversations with his lawyers and some of his closest staff members. Jefferson produced all of these transcripts in MS Word Format and also transcribed four of them using a typewriter. Additionally, one of Jefferson‚Äôs specific focuses within sociolinguistics was laughter. Consequently, in 2007 she presented her final paper on the machinery of laughter at a conference in Sweden. This final paper incorporated statistics taken from her transcriptions of the Watergate tapes, along with some of the dialogue she had with Harvey Sacks in her younger years.  Later life  Over four decades, for the majority of which she held no university position and was unsalaried, Jefferson‚Äôs research into talk-in-interaction has set the standard for what became known as CA. Her contributions to Conversation Analysis were significant as she created what is now referred to as \\"Jeffersonian Transcription\\" or the \\"Jeffersonian Transcription System\\". This system is composed of several different symbols each followed by a detailed explanation of what the symbol itself represents in the context which it is used. The underlying purpose of this system is to aid in the identification of speech patterns, and assist those trying to annotate a conversation. Her work has greatly influenced the sociological study of interaction, but also disciplines beyond, especially linguistics, communication, and anthropology. It would not be so much true that her work was inter- or multi-disciplinary as that disciplinary boundaries were irrelevant to her enquiries into what Erving Goffman referred to as the ‚Äúinteraction order.‚Äù  Selected bibliography  *Jefferson, G.

Background Following the fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, large numbers of South Vietnamese begun to flee Vietnam for fear of persecution heralding the arrival of the Boat People. On the 2 May 1975, the first wave of 300 refugees arrived in Singapore waters on board the vessel Truong Hai. A total of up to 8,355 refugees was believed to have entered Singapore waters during this period until the 14th of May in 1975. During this period, Operation Thunderstorm was activated by MINDEF, making Singapore one of the first countries to stop refugees from entering its coastlines. The operation involved the Republic of Singapore Air Force, Republic of Singapore Navy, Singapore Army and the then-Marine Police (now the Police Coast Guard) as well as various government authorities and agencies. Objectives The primary objective of the operation was to contain, quarantine and prevent refugees from entering and staying in Singapore. Execution The Republic of Singapore Navy and the Police Coast Guard was tasked to intercept and detain all Singapore bound refugee boats. Quarantine areas were set up along the beaches of Marine Parade and a SAF Field Hospital was deployed to Bedok Jetty to provide first aid and other essential medical services. The Navy sent its technicians and engineers to inspect and repair the refugee boats. Food, water, fuel oil and other provisions were given in order to ensure the departure of the vessels.

The gorge is characterized by some of the most interesting geological and geomorphological structures and area-specific natural ecosystems with little anthropogenic influence. It is featured on UNESCO's Tentative List of World Heritage Sites in Poland.UNESCO World Heritage List, Poland. Accessed 7 September 2011. Dunajec Gorge is also one of the best-known tourist attractions in the Pieniny Mountains. Wooden raft trips have been organized daily by Pieniny Gorals since the early 19th century ‚Äî when their customers consisted mostly of guests of nearby Niedzica and Czorsztyn castles. The trip begins in the village of Sromowce Wy≈ºne-KƒÖty, and ends in the resort town of Szczawnica, 18 km downstream. It takes about 2‚Äì3 hours. The second leg of the tour is only 5 km long. It begins in Szczawnica and ends in the town of Kro≈õcienko nad Dunajcem. The Gorge makes 7 loops in its length. The surrounding rock reaches 300 m in height almost all the way through. Geography The gorge is part of a valley located within the Pieniny National Park. The landscape distinguishes it from surrounding mountains due to interaction of natural factors such as geological ground, relief, water, soil, climate, flora and fauna, and their evolutionary relationships. All these elements contribute to the complexity of the natural beauty of the whole area.Pieniny National Park's official website. Retrieved September 7, 2011. The conditions for the development of unique flora and fauna are closely related to the limestone and dolomite strata. Literally, the rock is the foundation for this one-of-a-kind environment. There is the occurrence of the Carpathians' plant and animal species, in many cases endemic. Their varied morphologic segmentation is responsible for the area's original and highly valuable aesthetic character. From a botanical standpoint the Dunajec River Gorge serves as an example of area-specific vegetation dating back to the glacial age, even though the Pieniny Mountains were not glaciated. From a geographical standpoint it exists apart from the West Carpathians flora (Carpaticum occidentale) with their endemics and subendemics. From a zoological standpoint the valleys cut in Mesozoic rocks have an extraordinary importance for preservation of many species and fauna of the Carpathians. Enormous segmentation of the terrain results in high concentration of biodiversity in a relatively small area.

Presently, the building is occupied by students from Tilden Middle School, whom were displaced when their school facility began a major renovation project. MCPS Superintendent Jack Smith's 2020 Capital Budget includes the funding for the reopening of Woodward High School in 2022. The budget has options for Woodward to function for two school years, starting in September 2023, as a holding school for Northwood High School, as the latter facility undergoes a planned expansion, or instead implement a phased construction for Northwood, with it remaining onsite at its current facility, thereby allowing Woodward to function as its own individual school. County Council President Hans Riemer and Montgomery County first lady Catherine Leggett are leading an effort to rename Charles W. Woodward High School in honor of the Rev.

Etymology The term \\"white elephant\\" refers to an extravagant but burdensome gift that cannot be easily disposed of, based on the legend of the King of Siam gifting rare albino elephants to courtiers who had displeased him, that they might be ruined by the animals' upkeep costs. A \\"white elephant sale\\" sells items that retain some value but have no intrinsic use; items are often referred to as white elephants. Such items may still find buyers but their resale value is hard to estimate. Description White elephant sales are typically organized by non-profit organizations such as churches and schools to raise money for a charity cause or a special occasion like Easter or Mother's Day. They operate in a manner similar to many non-profit thrift shops. Members or friends of the organization holding the white elephant sale will donate old items which they no longer use, or otherwise no longer care to own. After items have been collected, a sale will be held, usually lasting more than one day in a public f√™te style. Volunteers often run checkouts, and organize the items to be sold. Items are sold at low prices, as many are obsolete, or useful to only certain people, and would not otherwise be sold. White elephant sales are often useful to buyers and collectors, because they provide a way to purchase older and harder to find items. In the days before online auction and trading websites, white elephant sales, along with thrift stores, yard sales and pawn shops were popular ways to procure collectibles and odd items not available in retail stores. Drawbacks Problems can arise with white elephant sales in that a great deal of space is required to hold items to be sold. Even more problematic is many items will not be sold one year, but in the case of an annual sale, will be retained to be sold the next year. This requires a large amount of space to be dedicated to the extended storage of the items. Other problems include the inability to move merchandise, or the little money produced by the sale, despite its low (or nonexistent) initial investment. Additionally, many items donated are often not worth selling, as they are broken, or clearly worthless, and donated only so the previous owner can dispense with them. White elephant sales also often carry the reputation of selling kitsch items.

Information seeking is related to, but different from, information retrieval (IR).  Information retrieval  Traditionally, IR tools have been designed for IR professionals to enable them to effectively and efficiently retrieve information from a source. It is assumed that the information exists in the source and that a well-formed query will retrieve it (and nothing else). It has been argued that laypersons' information seeking on the internet is very different from information retrieval as performed within the IR discourse. Yet, internet search engines are built on IR principles. Since the late 1990s a body of research on how casual users interact with internet search engines has been forming, but the topic is far from fully understood. IR can be said to be technology-oriented, focusing on algorithms and issues such as precision and recall. Information seeking may be understood as a more human-oriented and open-ended process than information retrieval. In information seeking, one does not know whether there exists an answer to one's query, so the process of seeking may provide the learning required to satisfy one's information need.  In different contexts  Much library and information science (LIS) research has focused on the information-seeking practices of practitioners within various fields of professional work. Studies have been carried out into the information-seeking behaviors of librarians, academics, medical professionals, engineers, lawyers and mini-publics(among others). Much of this research has drawn on the work done by Leckie, Pettigrew (now Fisher) and Sylvain, who in 1996 conducted an extensive review of the LIS literature (as well as the literature of other academic fields) on professionals' information seeking. The authors proposed an analytic model of professionals' information seeking behaviour, intended to be generalizable across the professions, thus providing a platform for future research in the area. The model was intended to \\"prompt new insights... and give rise to more refined and applicable theories of information seeking\\" (1996, p. 188). The model has been adapted by Wilkinson (2001) who proposes a model of the information seeking of lawyers.  Theories of information-seeking behavior  A variety of theories of information behavior ‚Äì e.g. Zipf's Principle of Least Effort, Brenda Dervin's Sense Making, Elfreda Chatman's Life in the Round ‚Äì seek to understand the processes that surround information seeking. In addition, many theories from other disciplines have been applied in investigating an aspect or whole process of information seeking behavior.Khosrowjerdi, M. 2016. A review of theory-driven models of trust in the online health context. IFLA Journal, 42 (3), 189-206, available http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0340035216659299 A review of the literature on information seeking behavior shows that information seeking has generally been accepted as dynamic and non-linear (Foster, 2005; Kuhlthau 2006). People experience the information search process as an interplay of thoughts, feelings and actions (Kuhlthau, 2006). Donald O. Case (2007) also wrote a good book that is a review of the literature. Information seeking has been found to be linked to a variety of interpersonal communication behaviors beyond question-asking, to include strategies such as candidate answers. Robinson‚Äôs (2010) research suggests that when seeking information at work, people rely on both other people and information repositories (e.g., documents and databases), and spend similar amounts of time consulting each (7.8% and 6.4% of work time, respectively; 14.2% in total). However, the distribution of time among the constituent information seeking stages differs depending on the source. When consulting other people, people spend less time locating the information source and information within that source, similar time understanding the information, and more time problem solving and decision making, than when consulting information repositories. Furthermore, the research found that people spend substantially more time receiving information passively (i.e., information that they have not requested) than actively (i.e., information that they have requested), and this pattern is also reflected when they provide others with information.  Wilson's nested model of conceptual areas  Wilson's Nested Model of Conceptual Areas The concepts of information seeking, information retrieval, and information behaviour are objects of investigation of information science. Within this scientific discipline a variety of studies has been undertaken analyzing the interaction of an individual with information sources in case of a specific information need, task, and context. The research models developed in these studies vary in their level of scope. Wilson (1999) therefore developed a nested model of conceptual areas, which visualizes the interrelation of the here mentioned central concepts. Wilson defines models of information behavior to be \\"statements, often in the form of diagrams, that attempt to describe an information-seeking activity, the causes and consequences of that activity, or the relationships among stages in information-seeking behaviour\\" (1999: 250).

Biography Oscar Stephen Gill was born April 3, 1880 in St. Lawrence, Pennsylvania. He moved with his wife, Emma Dohrman Gill, to Alaska in 1907. In 1909, he ran a sawmill in Susitna, lived for a time in Knik, carrying mail by dog sled from Seward to Susitna and Iditarod. In 1915, he moved to Ship Creek to work on the Alaska Railroad. As the encampment at Ship Creek grew into the city of Anchorage, Gill put down roots, floating his two-story house down the Knik River to 918 W. 10th Avenue, where it remained until 1982. From 1916-1923, Gill ran a lighterage service under contract with the Alaskan Engineering Commission. In 1923, he opened Anchorage's first garage at the corner of Fourth Avenue and I Street. In 1929, Gill was elected to the city council, serving until 1932, when he was elected Mayor of Anchorage for one term. He did not stand for election in 1933, but ran for a second, non-consecutive term in 1934. He was elected without opposition on the ballot and served two more terms as mayor. His son, Victor Gill, made an unsuccessful bid to succeed him as Mayor of Anchorage in 1936. In 1944, Oscar Gill was elected to the Alaska Territorial House of Representatives, representing the 3rd District. He was re-elected in 1946, becoming Speaker of the House in 1947. He died while still in office, November 18, 1947, and was buried in the Anchorage Memorial Park. The Oscar Gill House, threatened with demolition in 1982, was purchased by the Municipality of Anchorage and moved into storage. In 1994 it was restored to a new location at 1344 W. 10th Avenue.

Notably, he was the first Australian war correspondent, he wrote against penal transportation to Australia and in favour of the federation of Australia. Willoughby was born at Birmingham, England. He was educated at primary schools at Birmingham and London and came to Melbourne in 1857. He continued his education there, and in 1861 joined the staff of The Age newspaper as a junior reporter. About a year later he transferred to The Argus. In the 1860s he became the first Australian war correspondent, and accompanied the troops under General Cameron in the New Zealand Wars in New Zealand. Returning to Melbourne he was sent to Western Australia to report on the convict system. A series of letters from Willoughby appeared in the Argus and were published in a pamphlet of 64 pages in 1865, Transportation: The British Convict in Western Australia. His conclusions were that the sending of further convicts would be bad for Australia and should be resisted and that from the British point of view it was comparatively useless and wastefully expensive. From 1866 to 1869, Willoughby was a member of the first Victorian Hansard staff, and in the latter year was appointed the editor of the Melbourne Daily Telegraph. He married in 1870, Emily Frances Jones, they had a son and two daughters. He wrote for the Telegraph until 1877, when he joined the Argus staff again as chief of the news department and leader writer. He fought valiantly for the constitutional party in opposition to Victorian Premier Graham Berry, and his column every week, \\"Above the Speaker\\" by \\"Timotheous\\", was a piece of journalism which never failed to be interesting. He was made chief political leader writer in 1882 and conducted a campaign in favour of federation. A selection of his writings in the Argus on this subject was published with additions in 1891 under the title Australian Federation its Aims and its Possibilities. Willoughby was frequently consulted when the drafting of federal bills was in progress. In 1898 he was appointed editor of the Argus but an illness in January 1903 compelled his resignation. He continued, however, to make occasional contributions to the paper until shortly before his death in the Melbourne suburb of St Kilda. In addition to the works already mentioned he was the author of The Critic in Church, published anonymously in 1872, and Australian Pictures, published in 1886. Willoughby Crescent, in the Canberra suburb of Gilmore, is named in his honour.

It is often used in reference to groups such as political parties or organisations where information from group insiders is 'leaked' or used to undermine the goals of the group. The Macquarie Dictionary says the verb \\"to white-ant\\" means \\"to subvert or undermine from within\\". The term is derived from the action of termites (white ants) eating the inside of wooden building foundations, often leaving no outward evidence, until the structure crumbles.  Usage  It has been used on the soap opera Neighbours several times including in 2006. In 2012, the Illawarra Mercury newspaper also used the term, when it reported that then-government minister Greg Combet wanted his colleagues to stop white-anting the Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. In 1938, Gordon Childe used the term in a letter to Rajani Palme Dutt, explaining how in his books he used the method of 'white-anting' to get his Marxist message to the masses rather than labeling himself as a Marxist and using Marxist terms, thus eroding the institution of bourgeois scholarship.Childe to Dutt, 14 October 1938, Palme Dutt Papers in Communist Party of Great Britain Archives, Labour History Archive and Study Centre, People's History Museum, Manchester In 2019, Steve Smith, the returned former captain of the Australian cricket team, was accused of white-anting the new captain Tim Paine.

The architectural firm Arquitectonica worked on the project, while the design was done by Philippe Starck and John Hitchcox's design company. North and south twin towers The Icon Brickell South Tower is adjacent to its twin, the Icon Brickell North Tower. They are the same height and share the same amount of floors. The North Tower is the same height as the South Tower, but is shaped differently. W Miami W Miami (formerly Viceroy Miami) is the third building in the Icon Brickell Complex. Like the North Tower and South Tower, W Miami was designed by Arquitectonica. Unlike the twin towers it shares the site with, W Miami is shorter and instead of simply condominiums, it also includes a hotel. W Miami is managed by Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc. The association of condominium owners is named the Icon Brickell Condo Number Three Association. W Miami is home to the \\"Whisper Lounge\\", a 50th floor rooftop lounge that boasts a swimming pool and panoramic view of downtown Miami, Key Biscayne and South Miami Beach.

Techniques=Dyeing carving The application of pigments carried by solvents or water into the pores of the leather. Can be applied to tooled or untooled leather, either for even coloration or to highlight certain areas. For example, application to a tooled piece can result in pooling in the background areas giving contrasts and depth. There are oil, alcohol, and water based leather dyes available. Although the water-based alternatives tend to not work as well due to poor penetration. Painting Leather painting differs from leather dyeing in that paint remains only on the surface while dyes are absorbed into the leather. Due to this difference, leather painting techniques are generally not used on items that can or must bend nor on items that receive friction, such as belts and wallets because under these conditions, the paint may crack or wear off. However, latex paints can be used to paint such flexible leather items. In the main though, a flat piece of leather, backed with a stiff board is ideal and common, though three-dimensional forms are possible so long as the painted surface remains secured. Acrylic paint is a common medium, often painted on tooled leather pictures, backed with wood or cardboard, and then framed. Unlike photographs, leather paintings are displayed without a glass cover, to prevent mould. Carving Leather carving entails using metal implements to compress moistened leather in such a way as to give a three- dimensional effect. The surface of the leather is not intended to be cut through, as would be done in filigree. The main tools used to \\"carve\\" leather include: swivel knife, veiner, beveler, pear shader, seeder, various sculpting implements, and background tools. The swivel knife is held with one finger providing downward pressure upon a stirrup-like top and drawn along the leather to outline patterns. The other tools are punch-type implements struck with a wooden, nylon, metal or rawhide mallet. The object is to add further definition, texture and depth to the cut lines made by the swivel knife and the areas around the cut lines. In the United States and Mexico, the western floral style, known as \\"Sheridan Style\\", of carving leather predominates. Usually, these are stylized pictures of acanthis or roses although, increasingly, modern leather artists are redefining and expanding the potential of the materials. By far the most preeminent carver in the United States was Al Stohlman. His patterns and methods have been embraced by many hobbyists, scout troops, reenacters, and craftsmen. Stamping Examples of geometric stamping on leather. Leather stamping involves the use of shaped implements (stamps) to create an imprint onto a leather surface, often by striking the stamps with a mallet. Commercial stamps are available in various designs, typically geometric or representative of animals. Most stamping is performed on vegetable tanned leather that has been cased. This is the action of dampening the leather with water so that it soaks into the surface fibres. The water makes the leather softer and able to be compressed by the design being pressed or stamped into it. After the leather has been stamped, the design stays on the leather as it dries out, but it can fade if the leather becomes wet and is flexed. To make the impressions last longer, the leather is conditioned with oils and fats to make it waterproof and prevent the fibers from deforming. Molding/shaping Leather shaping or molding consists of soaking a piece of leather in water to greatly increase pliability and then shaping it by hand or with the use of objects or even molds as forms. As the leather dries it stiffens and holds its shape. Carving and stamping may be done prior to or after molding. Molding has become popular among hobbyists whose crafts are related to fantasy, goth/steampunk culture and cosplay as well as those interested in more classic styling of bags and household items. Two well known pieces of molded leather are part of the funerary achievements of Edward, the Black Prince, the heraldic crest and shield.http://myarmoury.com/feature_mow_bp.html Description and photographs of the original and the reproduction from the tomb in Canterbury Cathedral  Laser cutting/etching  Carbon dioxide lasers cut through leather very smoothly, and at low power a laser cutter can etch detailed designs into leather to any desired depth although some discoloration and stiffening occurs in vegetable tanned tooling leather.  Perforation  Perforation ‚Äì the result of punching that is provided for the manufacture of a large number of regularly arranged apertures of regular shape in the sheet and other material. A decorative technique that is used to connect two sheets of leather or to decorate them.  Pyrography  Pyrography (purogravure) on leather is the art of using a hot needle to make a drawing on leather. Under the influence of heat the leather takes on darker shades which subsequently become a complete picture.

Song information \\"Burn Down the Mission\\" is musically driven by the story told by Bernie Taupin's lyrics, as is common in John/Taupin collaborations. The lyrics themselves, while telling a simple story, are vague enough to be open to interpretation. Ostensibly the story is that of a poor community oppressed by a rich and powerful force, and the narrator, driven by some sort of revelation, has decided to take direct action to remedy the situation. However, his attempt fails and he is \\"taken away\\", presumably to meet his fate, and justifies his actions as an attempt to defend his family. The music reflects this narrative structure by starting with a slow piano introduction and the telling of the hero's situation and his progress towards direct action; the middle section, which is faster, jazzier and brings in full instrumentation, can be read as an interpretation of the actual struggle in which the hero engages. Finally, the struggle has ended and the music returns to its initial understated form, reflecting the eventual defeat of the hero. The song ends with a restatement of the middle section while it fades out. In the premiere episode of Elvis Costello's show Spectacle on Sundance channel, John cited Laura Nyro as an influence on, among other, unusual structure and rhythm changes of this song in particular. This is one of the most musically complicated works of John's career. The key changes four times before returning to the original opening chord sequence at the half-way mark.

The Kinsol Trestle The Kinsol Trestle The Kinsol Trestle, also known as the Koksilah River Trestle, is a wooden railway trestle located on Vancouver Island north of Shawnigan Lake in the Canadian Province of British Columbia. It provides a spectacular crossing of the Koksilah River. Completed in 1920, its dimensions measure high and long, making it the largest wooden trestle in the Commonwealth of Nations and one of the highest railway trestles in the world. It was built as part of a plan to connect Victoria to Nootka Sound, passing through Cowichan Lake and Port Alberni, when forestry had gained some ground on Vancouver Island and a more efficient way to transport the region's huge, old-growth timber was needed. It was not built, as some mistakenly believe, to serve any nearby mines. It was named after the nearby Kinsol Station which, in turn, took its name from a nearby mining venture grandiosely named \\"King Solomon Mines\\", a very small mining venture that produced or of copper and of silver (from of ore‚Äîhardly enough to fill 3 rail cars) over the period 1904‚Äì1907 . The line was started in 1911 by the Canadian Northern Pacific Railway (CNoPR) and while it was designed by engineers, it was built by local farmers and loggers, with investment funds from the Canadian Western Lumber Company, which was the largest lumber company in the world at that time. The trestle was never completed by the CNoPR, and the line only reached Youbou before construction was terminated. The CNoPR was taken over by Canadian National Railways in 1918, and its line and the trestle were completed in 1920 as part of the \\"Galloping Goose\\" rail line. The last train to cross the Kinsol was in 1979, and the trestle was abandoned 1 year later. Preservation Effort CN's rail service on Vancouver Island was abandoned in the 1980s and the right of way given to the provincial Ministry of Transportation. Due to the deteriorated structure of the Kinsol Trestle, the bridge was not usable by walkers or bicyclists on the Trans-Canada Trail, and was in danger of being torn down because it posed an environmental concern and danger to the public. This created some disagreement in the community. Some community groups set out to raise money to preserve the trestle for its historical and tourism value, whereas others simply wanted to repair the break in the Trans-Canada Trail as quickly and cheaply as possible. At that point in time crossing the Koksilah required an detour through difficult terrain. The Cowichan Valley Regional District (CVRD) held a special meeting on June 7, 2007 to determine the fate of the Kinsol. During this meeting the CVRD Board received presentations from a local firm that specializes in building conservation: Macdonald & Lawrence Timber Framing Ltd proposed a conservation strategy that would see the bridge fully restored for pedestrian use as part of the Trans-Canada Trail network. On September 20, 2007, the CVRD voted to move ahead with a feasibility study concerning the feasibility of the Kinsol Trestle. Three firms had responded to the CVRD request for proposals for restoration and the Vancouver firm Commonwealth Historic Resource Management Limited won the contract. Commonwealth has joined forces with Macdonald and Lawrence, the local timber construction firm that proposed a conservation strategy in June, 2007. M&L; is local in the sense it is established in Cobble Hill (a community close to Shawnigan Lake and the Kinsol), but is world-renowned and has built many unique structures in Great Britain, received a commendation from Queen Elizabeth for its work in restoring Windsor Castle following the disastrous fire, and is working to restore the British explorer Shackleton's shack in the Antarctic and other unique projects. In November 2007, Macdonald and Lawrence completed a major inspection of the trestle, drilling hundreds of test holes. The final report showed that 80% of the major timbers were still sound, and that it was feasible to restore the structure. M&L;'s report comprised the major portion of Commonwealth's report, which was presented to the CVRD on January 23, 2008. The Board members voted overwhelmingly to have Commonwealth proceed with Phase 2 of the study to provide a detailed plan of restoration, including a full evaluation of costs. This report was delivered in November 2008. It was calculated that the rehabilitation of the trestle would cost $5.7 million, and M&L; would ultimately collapse due to cost over-runs, but there would be benefits brought on by the rehabilitation of the Kinsol Trestle. The Kinsol Trestle is one of the few accessible and visible reminders of the early mining and logging industries in the Cowichan Valley, and increased tourism and recreation has created long-term economic and recreational benefits in the community. The rehabilitation also generated over 22 years of employment for the local population with direct and indirect work on the Trestle, engineering, and project management. The official reopening of the trestle was July 28, 2011. The Kinsol Trestle Capital Campaign With the recognition that the Kinsol Trestle would be preserved and rehabilitated, an official community based campaign was created in order to promote the Trestle and to raise the remaining $2 million necessary to complete the Kinsol Trestle. An official fundraising campaign was launched in June 2009 in order to raise the remainder of the funds needed to rehabilitate the Trestle. The official \\"Save the Historic Kinsol Trestle Campaign\\" came through with the support of the Cowichan Foundation and the Cowichan Valley Regional District (CVRD). The campaign was launched on June 10, 2009, and the Trestle reopened to the public after major renovations on July 28, 2011. It is now a part of the Trans Canada Trail.

The lyrics were written by Bernie Taupin and is his take on New York City after hearing a gun go off near his hotel window during his first visit to the city. The song's lyrics were partly inspired by Ben E. King's \\"Spanish Harlem,\\" written by Jerry Leiber and Phil Spector, in which he sings \\"There is a rose in Spanish Harlem.\\" In response to this, Taupin writes, Allmusic critic Stewart Mason noted that the song is \\"less saccharine than many similar Elton John and Bernie Taupin ballads\\" and praised the \\"somewhat uncharacteristic emotional directness\\" of its lyrics. It was released as the B-side of the \\"Harmony\\" U.K. single in 1980. Rolling Stone magazine's Jon Landau praised the song when it was released, writing: Elton John himself called the song \\"one of my all-time favourites\\" when introducing it at his 60th-birthday concert in New York's Madison Square Garden. He also delivered a heartfelt rendition at \\"The Concert for New York City\\" at Madison Square Garden on 20 October 2001. The concert was meant primarily as a tribute for family members and fellow workers of New York's Fire and Police and Emergency Medical Services departments, who had been participating in the ongoing recovery efforts at the demolished World Trade Center complex following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. John dedicated the song to the emergency workers and their families, as well as to New York City. The song was also used in the film Almost Famous, in a scene in New York City, highlighting the loneliness of Kate Hudson's character, who overdoses on Quaaludes and Champagne. The song was used in the finale of the American version of Life on Mars. It was also used for the bridal dance in the final episode of the TV series Brothers and Sisters entitled \\"Walker Down the Aisle\\". A more upbeat sequel to the song called \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two)\\" was recorded about 15 years later for John's album Reg Strikes Back.

The pilots of two United States Air Force (USAF) F-15 fighter aircraft, operating under the control of a USAF airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft, misidentified two United States Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters as Iraqi Mil Mi-24 \\"Hind\\" helicopters. The F-15 pilots fired on and destroyed both helicopters, killing all 26 military and civilians aboard, including personnel from the United States, United Kingdom, France, Turkey, and the Kurdish community. A subsequent USAF investigation blamed the accident on several factors. The F-15 pilots were faulted for misidentifying the helicopters as hostile. Also, the crew members of the AWACS aircraft were blamed for their inaction in failing to exercise appropriate control and for not intervening in the situation. In addition, the identification friend or foe (IFF) systems had not functioned to identify the helicopters to the F-15 pilots. Furthermore, USAF leaders had failed to adequately integrate U.S. Army helicopter operations into overall OPC air operations. As a result of the investigation several USAF officers received administrative discipline but only one, Jim Wang, an AWACS crew member, was tried by court-martial, in which he was acquitted. As a result of complaints by family members of the victims and others that the military was failing to hold its personnel accountable, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House conducted their own investigations into the shootdown and the U.S. military's response to it. Also, Ronald R. Fogleman, the USAF's new Chief of Staff, conducted his own review of the actions taken by the USAF against the officers involved in the incident. Fogleman's investigation led to several of the officers involved in the incident receiving further administrative discipline. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) subsequently refused U.S. Senate subpoenas for four USAF officers to be interviewed for the Senate investigation, which was never publicly released. The U.S. House investigation, conducted in part by the Government Accountability Office (GAO), found that the military investigative and judicial systems had operated mostly as designed, but also noted that the DoD had refused access to key witnesses. Background Map of the no-fly zones in Iraq after the Gulf War. Operation Provide Comfort took place in the northern no-fly zone, labeled as \\"NORTHERN NFZ\\" on the map An AWACS aircraft operates out of Incirlik Air Base during OPC On 7April 1991, Iraq accepted United Nations (UN) cease-fire conditions and resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 Kurdish refugees who had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the Kurdish refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 3‚Äì4, 27‚Äì29; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 143; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 78‚Äì81. OPC took place in an area of northern Iraq above the 36th parallel. This area, approximately in size, was designated a \\"no-fly\\" security zone by UN coalition forces, enforced by a combined task force (CTF) of daily armed aircraft patrols from participating nations, including the United Kingdom, France, Turkey, and the United States. The United States Army was tasked with assisting civilian relief agencies to build communities and facilities for the Kurds in Northern Iraq. Over the next three years, 27,000 fixed-wing and 1,400 helicopter coalition flights took place in the zone to support humanitarian operations without interference from Iraqi aircraft or other military units.Schmitt, \\"Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 7‚Äì8, 29‚Äì30; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 78‚Äì81. In April 1994 OPC was co-commanded by USAF Brigadier General Jeffrey Pilkington. The OPC combined air forces were commanded by Colonel Curtis H. Emery, USAF. Colonel Douglas J. Richardson, USAF, was the director of operations for the combined air forces.Piper, Chain of Events, p. 162; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 30. The other OPC co-commander was a Turkish military general officer. Incident On 14 April 1994, at 07:36 local time, a USAF E-3 AWACS aircraft from the 963d Airborne Air Control Squadron (based at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma) departed Incirlik Air Base (AB), Turkey in support of OPC. The AWACS, with its 19-member crew under the mission crew command of Major Lawrence Tracy, was to provide airborne threat warning and air control for all OPC aircraft during its time aloft. The AWACS crew reported on station at its assigned surveillance orbit altitude of located inside Turkey just north of the northern border of Iraq at 08:45. The weather that day was fair and clear over northern Iraq.Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 4, 46, 53‚Äì54; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 10‚Äì12, 51; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 104. At 08:22, two U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters from the 6th Battalion, 159th Aviation Regiment (based in Giebelstadt, Germany), called Eagle Flight, departed Diyarbakƒ±r, near Pirin√ßlik Air Base, Turkey headed for the OPC military coordination center (MCC) located away in Zakhu, Iraq. Both helicopters were fitted with external, fuel tanks on sponsons mounted beside each side door with each tank emblazoned with large American flags. In addition to the flags on the fuel tanks, each helicopter was marked with American flags on each side door, on the nose, and on the belly. The lead Black Hawk was piloted by U.S. Army Captain Patrick McKenna, commander of the Eagle Flight detachment of six helicopters.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 76; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 81, 91, 103‚Äì04. Originally, four helicopters were planned for the mission, but Turkish military authorities would authorize only two (Hall). The helicopters' call signs were Chalk1 and Chalk2 and their tail numbers were #88-26060 and #87-26000 (Hall). At 09:21, the Black Hawks reported their entry into the no- fly zone by radio on the en route frequency to the AWACS en route controller, Lieutenant Joseph Halcli, and then landed six minutes later at the MCC. Halcli and his superior officer, Captain Jim Wang, the AWACS's senior director, added \\"friendly helicopter\\" tags to their radar scopes, noted that both helicopters were displaying identification friend or foe (IFF) Mode I and Mode II signals, and then suspended the radar symbols after the Black Hawks disappeared from their scopes upon landing at the MCC at 09:24. Although the helicopters were squawking (signalling) the wrong IFF Mode I code for the no-fly zone (called the Tactical Area of Responsibility or TAOR), neither Wang nor Halcli informed the Black Hawk pilots of that (both helicopters, however, were squawking the correct Mode II codes). Wang and Halcli also neglected to direct the Black Hawks to begin using the TAOR radio frequency instead of the en route frequency.Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 6‚Äì21, 51; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 4, 55, 100‚Äì01; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 278‚Äì79. Six Eagle Flight helicopters were stationed at Pirinclik. This was Wang's 60th mission over OPC. The IFF systems in use by Provide Comfort coalition aircraft used four identification signals, modes I, II, III, and IV. Mode III was not used in the TAOR (Hall). An OPC Eagle Flight Black Hawk with external fuel tanks At the MCC, the Black Hawks picked up 16 members of the UN Provide Comfort coalition leadership team including four Kurdish civilians, one Chaldean-Catholic civilian, three Turkish, two British, and one French military officers, plus five U.S. civilian and military officials. At 09:54, the helicopters departed the MCC for Erbil, Iraq, a distance of . The Black Hawks reported their departure, flight route, and destinations by radio which was acknowledged by Halcli. Halcli then re- initiated the friendly helicopter track on his scope. Two of the Black Hawk passengers were Colonel Jerry Thompson, U.S. Army, commander of the MCC, and his replacement, Colonel Richard Mulhern, U.S. Army. At Arbil and later at Salah ad Din, Iraq, Thompson planned to introduce Mulhern to two prominent Kurdish leaders, Masoud Barzani and Jalal Talabani, as well as to UN representatives. Halcli placed tags on his radar screen to show the two Black Hawks' track and notified Wang of the helicopters' movement. In addition to Halcli's screen, the friendly helicopter symbols were visible on the radar screens of Wang, Tracy, and USAF Major Doug Martin. Martin was the \\"Duke\\" or \\"ACE\\" airborne command element on the AWACS, meaning he was a rated aircrew member assigned to the crew to ensure that all engagement (combat) mandates were adhered to and executed as written in OPC policies.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 6‚Äì22, 42, 51, 157; Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 4, 55, 100; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 105. Martin was a rated navigator with 2,000 flying hours, mainly in General Dynamics F-111 aircraft and had flown in the 1986 Bombing of Libya. The lead helicopter's crew and passengers included: Patrick McKenna (27), pilot; John Garrett (32), co-pilot; Jeffrey Colbert (22), crewman; Mark Ellner (21), crewman; Jerald Thompson (48), MCC commander; Richard Mulhern (43), new MCC commander; Paul Barclay (24), US Army special forces soldier; Barbara Schell (50), US State Department advisor; Harry Shapland, British military officer; Hikmet Alp, Turkish military officer; Salid Said, Kurdish representative; Barlas Gultepe, Turkish military officer; Bader Mikho, Kurdish representative; and Ahmad Mohammad, Kurdish representative (Hall, pp. 97‚Äì103). The trail helicopter's crew and passengers included: Michael Hall (28), pilot; Erik Mounsey (28), co-pilot; Cornelius Bass (22), crewman; Michael Robinson (23), crewman; Laura Piper (25), US Air Force officer; Benjamin Hodge (32); US Army intelligence specialist; Ricky Robinson (33), medic; Jonathan Swann, British military officer; Guy Demetz, French military officer; Ceyhun Civas, Turkish military officer; Abdulsatar Arab, Kurdish representative; Ghandi Hussein, Kurdish representative (Hall, pp. 93‚Äì97). En route to Arbil, at 10:12, the Black Hawks entered mountainous terrain and their radar returns disappeared from the AWACS's scopes. Captain Dierdre Bell, an air surveillance officer on the AWACS, noticed that the Black Hawks' radar and IFF returns had disappeared and sent an electronic \\"attention arrow\\" to Wang's scope. Wang took no action and the large blinking green arrow automatically disappeared from his screen after one minute.Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 56, 101; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 23‚Äì24; Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\". An F-15 fighter departs Incirlik Air Base during OPC Meanwhile, at 09:35, two USAF F-15C fighter aircraft from the 53d Fighter Squadron, piloted by Captain Eric Wickson and Lieutenant Colonel Randy W. May, departed Incirlik AB. Their mission was to perform an initial fighter sweep of the TAOR to clear the area of any hostile aircraft prior to the entry of coalition forces. The air tasking order (ATO) that was supposed to list all scheduled coalition aircraft missions for that day and which the two pilots reviewed before takeoff, mentioned that U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters would be operating in the TAOR but did not list takeoff times, routes, or flight durations for them. At 10:15, Wickson radioed Martin on the AWACS and asked if he had any information to pass to them to which Martin replied in the negative.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 25; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 58‚Äì59, 83‚Äì86, 101. Randy May was the squadron commander of the 53rd with over 3,000 flying hours and had shot down an Iraqi Hind helicopter in northern Iraq near Kirkuk during the Gulf War. Wickson had over 1,300 flying hours with about 700 in F-15s and this was his 18th mission over OPC. At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, reported entering northern Iraq to the AWACS controller responsible for air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency the F-15s were using was different from the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and was able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired to the back of the airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 4‚Äì6, 55, 60, 83‚Äì86, 101, 116; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 15‚Äì26, 51‚Äì52; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 106‚Äì07. Northern Iraqi terrain similar to that in which the incident occurred At 10:22, Wickson, flying at , reported a radar contact on a low-flying, slow-moving aircraft southeast of his current position. Wilson acknowledged Wickson's report with a \\"clear there\\" response, meaning he had no radar contacts in that area. Unknown to the two F-15 pilots, the unidentified aircraft were the two U.S. Army Black Hawks. Contrary to standard procedure, neither Tracy nor Wang spoke up at this point to request that the AWACS crew members attempt to identify the F-15s' radar contacts.Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 4; Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 15‚Äì27, 52; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 4‚Äì6, 60, 102. Both F-15 pilots then electronically interrogated the radar target with their on-board IFF systems across two different modes (Mode I and Mode IV). Their IFF systems responded negatively to the attempt to identify the contact on Mode I. The Mode IV momentarily gave a positive response, but thereafter responded negatively and the F-15s moved to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Intermittent IFF Mode I and Mode II returns from the Black Hawks now began to show on Wilson's and other AWACS crew members' scopes and friendly helicopter symbols reappeared on Wang's scope. After closing to of the radar contacts, at 10:25 the F-15s again reported the contact to the AWACS and Wilson this time responded that he now had a radar contact at that reported location. Although the Black Hawk intermittent radar and now steady IFF returns on the AWACS scopes were in the same location as the unidentified contacts being tracked by the F-15s, none of the AWACS controllers advised Wickson or May that the contacts they were tracking might be friendly helicopters.Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 278‚Äì79; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 26‚Äì29, 52‚Äì53, 217; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6, 60‚Äì62, 102, 118; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 4; Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\". An Eagle Flight Black Hawk as seen from the side An MI-24 as seen from the side The two F-15s now initiated a visual identification (VID) pass of the contact. The VID pass entailed violating one of OPC's rules of engagement, which prohibited fighter aircraft from operating below above the ground. At this time the two Black Hawks had entered a deep valley and were cruising at a speed of about above the ground. Wickson's VID pass was conducted at a speed of about , above and to the left of the helicopters. At 10:28 Wickson reported \\"Tally two Hinds\\" and then passed the two Black Hawks.Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6, 60‚Äì63, 76, 102; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 29‚Äì30, 53; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 108‚Äì09. \\"Hind\\" is the NATO designation for the Mil Mi-24 helicopter, a helicopter that the Iraqi and Syrian militaries operated and was usually configured with armament on small, side-mounted wings.Piper, Chain of Events, p. 41; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 6. Wilson responded with \\"Copy, Hinds\\" and asked Wang, \\"Sir, are you listening to this?\\" Wang responded, \\"Affirmative\\" but offered no further guidance or comments.Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 4; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6, 76, 102; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 30‚Äì31, 53, 211‚Äì16. May then conducted his own VID pass about above the helicopters and reported, \\"Tally 2.\\"Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 4; Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6, 63, 76, 102; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 30‚Äì31, 53, 211‚Äì16; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 109. May later stated to a USAF accident investigation board that his \\"Tally 2\\" call meant that he saw two helicopters but did not mean that he was confirming Wickson's identification of them as Hinds.GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\" Neither F-15 pilot had been informed that U.S. Army Black Hawks participating in OPC often carried auxiliary fuel tanks mounted on wings nor had either been instructed in the paint scheme that Iraqi Hind helicopters used, light brown and desert tan, which was different from the dark green color used by the Black Hawks. Wickson later said, \\"I had no doubt when I looked at him that he was a Hind... The Black Hawk did not even cross my mind.\\"Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 79‚Äì80; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 30‚Äì31. Following their VID passes, Wickson and May circled back behind the helicopters approximately . Because aircraft from various nations sometimes operated unannounced in the northern Iraq area, the OPC rules of engagement required the F-15 pilots to attempt to verify the nationality of the helicopters. Instead, at 10:28, Wickson notified the AWACS that he and May were \\"engaged\\" and instructed May to \\"arm hot.\\"Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 32, 53, 119; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6‚Äì7, 63, 102; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 109‚Äì10. At 10:30, Wickson fired an AIM-120 AMRAAM missile at the trail helicopter from a range of about . The missile hit and destroyed the trailing helicopter seven seconds later (). In response, the lead Black Hawk, piloted by McKenna, immediately turned left and dived for lower altitude in an apparent attempt to evade the unexpected attack. About 20 seconds later, May fired an AIM-9 Sidewinder missile at the lead helicopter from a range of about , hitting and shooting it down also about northeast of the trail helicopter (). All 26 people on board the two Black Hawks were killed. After flying over the wreckage of the two helicopters lying burning on the ground, May radioed Wickson, \\"Stick a fork in them, they're done.\\"Schmitt, \\"Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 6‚Äì7, 64; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 4‚Äì6; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 32‚Äì34, 53, 124‚Äì25, 139, 156; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 111‚Äì14, 162. Kurdish farmer Hadi Mohammed and his son Aziz witnessed the incident and reported that the trail helicopter was hit, \\"in the back and it turned one-quarter turn to the right then it rolled sideways to the left, and then it hit the ground. There was no fire in the inside, just on the outside back, and then it hit the ground and exploded and burned\\" (Hall, p. 112). Mohammed stated that the second missile \\"hit the second helicopter, it hit the blades on top, and the helicopter went down behind the hill and exploded and burned\\" (Hall, p. 114). Hall gives the crash coordinates as (Hall, p. 158). Air Force accident investigation By 13:15 local time, Kurdish civilians notified the MCC they had witnessed the two Black Hawks being shot down north of Arbil and that there were no survivors. The news was quickly picked up by the media and broadcast by CNN.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 48‚Äì49, 107; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 160. A Kurdish farmer, Mowfik Tahsin, videotaped the shootdown and some of the wreckage immediately afterwards (Hall, p. 114). Within hours, U.S. President Bill Clinton was briefed on the shootdown and called the heads of government of the United Kingdom and France, John Major and Fran√ßois Mitterrand, to express regret and sympathy for the deaths of their citizens in the incident. Clinton appeared a few hours later in a televised news conference in which he said he had directed the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) to lead an inquiry into the accident. Clinton further stated, \\"We will get the facts, and we will make them available to the American people and to the people of Britain, France, and Turkey, our partners in Operation Provide Comfort.\\"Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 55‚Äì56. USAF Major General James G. Andrus General Robert C. Oaks, USAF, Commander of United States Air Forces in Europe, immediately appointed an Air Force Regulation (AFR) 110-14 accident investigation board composed of a board president, eleven board members from the USAF and U.S. Army, three associate members from France, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, four legal advisers, and thirteen technical advisers. The board president was Major General James G. Andrus, USAF. An AFR 110-14 investigation's findings are publicly released and the testimony of witnesses in the investigation can be used against them in military disciplinary proceedings. For this reason, after serious mishaps the USAF usually also conducts a separate safety investigation, in which the results are not publicly released and witness testimony is immune from prosecution. In this case, however, for unknown reasons the USAF decided not to conduct a safety investigation.GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 8‚Äì10; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 67‚Äì68, 117, 227; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 160. After interviewing 137 witnesses and conducting numerous tests, the 27-volume, 3,630-page AFR 110-14 investigation report was publicly released on 13 July 1994, although some report's details had been leaked to the media by unknown defense officials two weeks earlier.Schmitt, \\"Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 123‚Äì29; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 16; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 160. The board made seven general findings about what they believed caused the shootdown to occur: :1. Wickson misidentified the Black Hawk helicopters and May failed to notify Wickson that he had been unable to confirm the identity of the helicopters. :2. The IFF transponders on the F-15s and/or the Black Hawks did not operate correctly for unknown reasons. :3. Misunderstandings existed throughout the OPC forces as to how coalition air operations procedures and responsibilities applied to MCC helicopter operations. :4. The AWACS crew commander, Lawrence Tracy, was not currently qualified in accordance with USAF regulations and he and the other AWACS crewmembers committed mistakes.The USAF AFR 110-14 Accident Investigation Report Summary states that Tracy was not currently qualified because he had not flown the requisite three sorties during the prior three months. On 22 December 1993 Tracy was placed in \\"Duty- not-involving-flying\\" (DNIF) status and did not fly again until 23 February 1994 when he flew one sortie and was waivered to return to mission ready (MR) status. He did not fly another sortie until the 14 April 1994 mission in which the Black Hawks were shot down. During that time period, Tracy was incorrectly left in MR status and subsequently incorrectly designated as mission crew commander on 14 April. :5. OPC personnel in general were not properly trained in the rules of engagement for the northern Iraq no fly zone. :6. The Black Hawks were not equipped with more modern radios which would have allowed them to communicate with the F-15s. :7. The shootdown \\"was caused by a chain of events which began with the breakdown of clear guidance from the Provide Comfort Combined Task Force to its component organizations.\\"GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 66‚Äì67; Piper, Friendly Fire, p. 128; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 281‚Äì82. AWACS crew members at their stations aboard their aircraft during an OPC mission The board report stated that, \\"There is no indication that the AWACS Senior Director (Wang), the Mission Crew Commander (Tracy) and/or the DUKE (Martin) made any radio calls throughout the intercept, or that they issued any guidance to either the AWACS crew or the F-15 pilots.\\"Weiner, \\"Court-Martial Nears in Case of Helicopters Shot Down\\", Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 102. Although the OPC ROE did task the AWACS with controlling and monitoring helicopter operations in the TAOR, the board found that the AWACS crew believed they had no responsibility for controlling U.S. Army Black Hawks or ensuring that other coalition aircraft were aware of Black Hawks operating in the TAOR. When questioned by board investigators as to who was responsible for tracking the helicopters, Tracy said, \\"I cannot tell you that. I honestly don't know.\\"Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 125. When Wang was asked the same question by the investigators, he replied, \\"No one is responsible.\\"Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 126. When the investigators asked Martin what action he took when the F-15s called a visual identification on two Hind helicopters, Martin stated, \\"I did nothing.\\"Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 127. The board found that combined OPC forces, led by Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and other USAF officers, had failed to integrate helicopters into aircraft operations in the TAOR. An Eagle Flight officer later testified he had been told by the CTF's chief of staff, a USAF officer, that the army Black Hawk unit was not considered to be part of OPC. Thus, the CTF staff, under the direction of Colonel James Rusty O'Brien, USAF, had not tried to coordinate the U.S. Army Black Hawk missions into the daily ATOs. In fact, neither O'Brien nor his predecessors had established any type of procedure for communicating information on Black Hawk missions to the Combined Forces Air Component (CFAC). The MCC commander, Colonel Thompson, had personally called O'Brien on the night of 13 April to tell him about the next day's Black Hawk mission into northern Iraq, a mission specifically and personally approved by Pilkington earlier that day. O'Brien or his staff apparently did not attempt to communicate specific information on this mission to the AWACS or F-15 fighter units at Incirlik, the CFAC, the ground-based mission director, or to the \\"Duke\\" on board the AWACS.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 8, 142‚Äì61; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 42‚Äì43, 210. O'Brien's full title is, \\"Commander, Operations, Plans, and Policy\\" for OPC. A U.S. Army Black Hawk flies over a small village in the Kurdish occupied security zone in Northern Iraq during OPC For reasons that USAF officers were unable to explain, two versions of each day's ATO were published, one for the USAF units at Incirlik, and another for the Eagle Flight unit at Pirinclik. The ATO version sent to Eagle Flight, for unknown reasons, gave a wrong IFF Mode I code for the TAOR. Although army Black Hawks had been operating for almost two years in the TAOR while squawking a wrong code and observed doing so by numerous AWACS crews, no one ever told them they were using a wrong code. On the day of the shootdown, the F-15s had interrogated the Black Hawks on two different IFF Modes (Mode I and Mode IV). The first responded negatively because the Black Hawks were squawking the wrong code. The second mode responded negatively for technical reasons the investigation was unable to conclusively determine.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Schmitt, \\"Copter Deaths: Pentagon Finds Human Failure\\"; Snook, Friendly Fire, pp. 142‚Äì61; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 42; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 278‚Äì79. The USAF AFR 110-14 Accident Investigation Report Summary says the possible reasons that the second mode (Mode IV) responded negatively included: Wickson and May selected the wrong interrogation crypto code (A or B), both F-15's interrogators malfunctioned, both Black Hawk IFF transponder crypto codes may have been loaded incorrectly, the close proximity of the two Black Hawks to each other may have \\"garbled\\" the IFF signals, and the mountainous terrain may have interfered with line-of-sight between the helicopters and the F-15s. The board did not investigate whether any USAF institutional factors, such as a lack of crew resource management training for the involved aircrews, might have been a factor.Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 10‚Äì13, 247. Also, the board did not attempt to determine if Wickson and May had violated any of the existing OPC rules of engagement as defined by the ATO or other written instructions.GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 248. The United States Secretary of Defense, William Perry, later summarized the \\"errors, omissions, and failures\\" contributing to the accident as, \\"The F-15 pilots misidentified the Black Hawks, the AWACS crew failed to intervene, Eagle Flight and their operations were not integrated into the Task Force, and the IFF systems failed.\\"Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 68. General Shalikashvili, now serving as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, added: \\"There were a shocking number of instances where people failed to do their job properly.\\"Peterson, \\"Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq\\", Verhovek, \\"Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft\\", Piper, Chain of Events, p. 130. Actions taken On 8September 1994 the DoD announced the actions it would take in response to the investigation's findings. May was charged with 26 counts of negligent homicide by military legal authorities. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson were charged with dereliction of duty. All of those charged faced an Article 32 hearing in which it would be decided if they should be tried by court-martial or the matter disposed of otherwise. Martin, Tracy, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson faced a joint Article 32 hearing while May's hearing was separate. Wickson was not charged. Although not explicitly stated by USAF leaders, it appears Wickson was not charged but May was because Wickson had testified that he was sure of his identification of the two Black Hawks as hostile Hinds, while May had stated that he was not sure of Wickson's identification but had allowed the engagement to proceed anyway.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Peterson, \\"Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 151‚Äì54, 161; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 246. USAF Lieutenant General Eugene D. Santarelli Martin and Halcli waived their right to an Article 32 hearing, meaning their cases could move immediately to court- martial or administrative action. Wickson was given immunity by USAF Lieutenant General Eugene Santarelli, commander of the 17th Air Force, to testify at the hearings. The AWACS crew members' hearing, which began on 19 October 1994 at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma was an open hearing and presided over by Colonel William Colwell, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Lieutenant General Stephen Croker, USAF, commander of the 8th Air Force. May's hearing, beginning on 7November 1994 at Sembach Air Base, Germany was a closed hearing and presided over by Colonel Edward M. Starr, USAF, under the legal jurisdiction of Santarelli. Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien declined requests to testify at either hearing.Wickson did not request immunity. Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 246; Novak, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 161‚Äì63, 169‚Äì72, 177‚Äì83; Associated Press, \\"No Charges Likely Against F-15 Pilot\\"; Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\". On 17 November 1994 the USAF announced that Colwell had recommended to Croker that Wang face court-martial and that Halcli receive nonjudicial administrative action on the dereliction of duty charges. Colwell recommended the formal dereliction of duty charges be dropped against the other AWACS crew members, but that they could still face nonjudicial action. Croker accepted Colwell's recommendation and ordered Wang to face court- martial and dismissed the criminal charges against the other AWACS crew members except Halcli, who was offered Article 15 action.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 186‚Äì88, 196; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 246, 252. At his hearing, May changed his testimony from what he gave to the accident investigation board, stating that he had positively identified the two helicopters as Iraqi Hinds. Brigadier General John R. Dallager, an F-15 pilot and Wickson's and May's wing commander (52nd Fighter Wing) and regimental court-martial 303 inquiry officer, said he found May's errors in the shootdown \\"reasonable.\\"Novak, Robert, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\", reported in Soldiers for the Truth; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 231. Starr recommended the charges against May be dropped, stating that he found May's testimony believable.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 183‚Äì84. On 27 December 1994 the USAF announced that Santarelli, an F-15 pilot, had dismissed the charges against May and had decided not to pursue criminal disciplinary actions against any other OPC personnel under his legal jurisdiction, including Wickson, Pilkington, Emery, Richardson, and O'Brien. In January 1995 a USAF flying board returned Wickson and May, who had been grounded since the incident, to flying status. Subsequently, Wickson was transferred to Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, to undergo instructor pilot training with a follow-on assignment to Columbus Air Force Base, Mississippi.Associated Press, \\"No Charges Likely Against F-15 Pilot\\"; Peterson, \\"Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 186‚Äì88, 196, 201; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 246, 252; Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\". USAF Brigadier General Curtis H. Emery The USAF later announced the administrative actions taken against the other personnel involved in the shootdown. Pilkington, Emery, and Richardson received letters of admonishment. Martin, May, O'Brien, Tracy, Wickson, and Wilson received letters of reprimand. Halcli accepted an Article 15 action which resulted in his receiving a letter of reprimand. The personnel involved were allowed to petition for the removal of the letters from their records at a future time. The reprimands were placed in \\"unfavorable information files\\" for each individual and were normally removed after two years. General George Joulwan, U.S. Army, Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, removed Pilkington as commander of OPC but the USAF retained him as commander of the 86th Airlift Wing at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. O'Brien and Emery were transferred to staff positions at the Pentagon. Richardson was transferred to a staff position at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe.Bacon, \\"DoD Press Briefing\\"; Schmitt, \\"Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 132, 222, 240; Military Times, quoted at \\"Specialist Cornelius A. Bass\\". Emery had been promoted to brigadier general on 15 July 1994 and his promotion was allowed to stand.Sklute, \\"DoD NewsBriefing\\" Wang's court-martial Wang's court-martial took place, beginning on 2June 1995, at Tinker Air Force Base. Wang was tried on three counts of dereliction of duty. Most of the personnel involved in the incident, except May, were called to testify, including the AWACS crew members, Wickson, and Pilkington. Most of the 40 witnesses testified with a grant of immunity.Arana-Barradas, \\"Black hawk incident \\"tragic series of errors\\"; Chu Lin, \\"Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang\\"; Peterson, \\"Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq\\"; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 247; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 205‚Äì13; Verhovek, \\"Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft\\". During the trial, evidence was presented that Wang often had trouble staying awake during AWACS missions. In fact, the problem was considered serious enough that the military had referred Wang to medical authorities to be checked for narcolepsy. Wang had also previously failed two check rides.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 161, 171. Pilkington, an F-16 pilot, testified that as commander of OPC he had sent numerous aircrew members, the majority of them F-15 pilots, back to their home bases for violating OPC rules or procedures or for displaying a lack of good judgment. In response to questions on the F-15 pilot's actions resulting in the shootdown, Pilkington stated, \\"I don't understand and I will probably never understand Wickson's mindset.\\" When asked if Wickson and May violated OPC rules of engagement in the incident, Pilkington responded, \\"Yes.\\" AWACS crew members added in their testimonies that once Wickson and May visually identified the helicopters as hostile, all responsibility for the shootdown passed to the F-15 pilots.Peterson, \\"Court-Martial Begins in 'Friendly Fire' Deaths in Iraq\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 214‚Äì15. USAF General Merrill McPeak Frank Spinner, Wang's civilian attorney, argued that USAF Chief of Staff General Merrill McPeak, a career fighter pilot, had made clear that he did not want Wickson and May punished for their actions in the shootdown. Cited as evidence for this was a Los Angeles Times report, published also in the European Stars and Stripes newspaper on 18 June 1994 that said McPeak \\"strongly opposed\\" court- martial action for Wickson or May. Pilkington stated that he had heard rumors McPeak had said something to that effect, but could not confirm if they were true or not.Novak, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\", reported in \\"Soldiers for Truth\\" and in Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 252; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 119. On 20 June 1995 the USAF announced a \\"nullification\\" verdict by Wang's 10-member court-martial jury, effectively acquitting Wang of the charges. Nullification is not a finding of innocence, but instead it is a refusal to convict on the stated charges. After the verdict, Wang stated, \\"I want to say the fight is nowhere near over for me. I want a congressional hearing or investigation into why I was the only person charged.\\"Verhovek, \\"Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 220‚Äì21. Major General Nolan Sklute, the USAF's top legal officer, stated, \\"An incident like this does not necessarily mean that the conduct of all those involved rises to the level of criminal culpability. I'm satisfied with the handling of the case.\\"Bacon, \\"DoD Press Briefing\\"; Verhovek, \\"Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 221. Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall added, \\"The Black Hawk helicopters were downed as a result of a tragic series of errors and unfortunate events involving numerous people. The mishap was not the result of any one individual's actions; the conduct of numerous officers and the system itself contributed.\\"Arana-Barradas, \\"Black hawk incident \\"tragic series of errors\\". Additional investigations and actions On 17 July 1995, U.S. Senator William Roth, chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, authorized a Senate investigation into the incident, primarily in response to complaints from family members of the shootdown victims that it appeared the U.S. military was not holding anyone seriously accountable for the shootdown.Verhovek, \\"Air Force Officer Is Acquitted in Downing of Army Aircraft\\"; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 251; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 224. Also in response to complaints about the DoD's response to the incident, the U.S. House of Representatives' Armed Services Subcommittee on Military Personnel scheduled a hearing on the incident for 3August 1995 to examine the accident investigation and the judicial actions that followed. In addition, on 24 July the DoD ordered the USAF to reexamine the disciplinary and administrative actions for the personnel involved in the shootdown and for the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review the corrective actions taken against those involved and determine whether further action was necessary. Widnall requested that the new USAF chief of staff, Ronald R. Fogleman begin his own review of accountability for the incident.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; Schmitt, \\"Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 224, 231‚Äì32; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 251. The House Committee on National Security hearing on 3August was presided over by Congressman Bob Dornan and lasted one day. At the hearing, Pilkington and Andrus explained how the USAF accident investigation was conducted and emphasized that Wickson and May violated the OPC rules of engagement by conducting a VID pass of the Black Hawks that was inadequate to determine the helicopter's national origin. Andrus stated, \\"Sir, as a pilot, I would have made another pass. You would never fire until you know what you are shooting at.\\" Retired USAF colonel and pilot Jerry Cox expressed concern to the Committee with the F-15 pilots for not taking responsibility for their actions.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 70‚Äì71, 233‚Äì36; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 205‚Äì06. Others testifying at the hearing included Major General Stephan Silvasy, Jr., U.S. Army, for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, USAF Major General Nolan Sklute, USAF Judge Advocate General, US Navy Rear Admiral James Lair, Director of Operations for the US Navy in Europe, US Army Captain Michael Nye, an Eagle Flight pilot, retired USAF colonel Jerry Cox, a former USAF pilot and journalist for the Military Times, and Frank J. Spinner, Wang's attorney (Hall). USAF General Ronald Fogleman On 10 August 1995 Fogleman spoke at a press conference at the Pentagon in which he announced the conclusions reached by his review into the accountability of USAF personnel involved in the shootdown incident. He said his investigation found that not all the performance evaluations for the individuals involved in the shootdown reflected the fact that they had received administrative action related to the incident.Schmitt, \\"Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots\\", GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\" Fogleman stated, Fogleman then announced that he had directed that Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, and Wilson be disqualified from aviation service duties for at least three years. Also, Fogleman wrote and placed \\"letters of evaluation\\" in the permanent personnel files of Wickson, May, Wang, Halcli, Wilson, Pilkington, and Emery that said each had failed \\"to meet Air Force standards in job knowledge, judgment and leadership\\". In addition, a military decoration awarded to O'Brien for his service during OPC was rescinded. A videotape in which Fogleman described his actions related to the incident and his views on standards and accountability was distributed throughout the USAF and all USAF officers, senior non-commissioned officers, and Senior Executive Service civilians were ordered to view it.Arana-Barradas, \\"Black hawk incident 'tragic series of errors'\\"; GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Schmitt, \\"Chief of Air Force Grounds 5 Pilots\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 240; Sklute, \\"DoD NewsBriefing\\". Fogleman further stated that he had found that the military justice system had \\"worked as it was designed to work\\".Sklute, \\"DoD NewsBriefing\\". Senate investigation Beginning in September 1995 and continuing for more than one year, Roth's Senate inquiry into the shootdown, led by Eric Thorson, investigated the incident. Thorson later stated his belief that the USAF accident investigation report and subsequent proceedings had been manipulated in order to avoid holding Wickson and May accountable for their actions. Thorson also stated that he believed Starr had submitted an inaccurate and misleading report on May's Article 32 hearing to the USAF commanding officers, including Dallager and Santarelli. With regard to the AWACS personnel, Thorson added: \\"We know some of the AWACS crew were incompetent beyond belief, and there is more than adequate evidence to conclude that several crewmembers were grossly negligent.\\"Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 243, 247‚Äì50; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 251. In August 1996, Roth's investigation board asked the DoD to produce the last four witnesses it wished to interview: Santarelli, Starr, Dallager, and Colonel C. G. Mangin. Mangin was Santarelli's legal adviser during the Wickson and May inquiry. The DoD refused the request to provide access to the four officers. A short time later, John White, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense, wrote a letter to Roth in which he asked that those four officers not be deposed.Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 252; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 50‚Äì251; Novak, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\" After further refusals from the USAF and DoD to provide the four officers for interview, Roth's committee gave the DoD and USAF until 14:30 on 31 October 1996 to provide the officers. The deadline passed without the officers appearing before the board. The next day the board sent senate subpoenas directly to the USAF headquarters office at the Pentagon, which refused to accept them. After learning that the Senate was now planning to individually serve the four subpoenas directly to the four officers, the associate chief of the Air Force litigation division accepted the subpoenas.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 53‚Äì254. DoD General Counsel On 13 November 1996, the day the first subpoenaed USAF officer was scheduled to appear, the DoD delivered a letter to Roth, signed by its general counsel, Judith Miller, saying the DoD believed the subpoenas were invalid because they were issued \\"after the adjournment of sine die of the 104th Congress\\" and was therefore not going to honor the subpoenas by providing the four officers for interview. Roth replied to the DoD that only the Senate's legal counsel could determine the validity of congressional subpoenas because of the \\"separation of powers\\" principle in the U.S. Constitution and thus, the subpoenas were valid. The DoD, on 20 November in another letter signed by Miller again refused to produce the witnesses. Roth, whose committee chairmanship was scheduled to end the next month, was told by the U.S. Department of Justice that the U.S. Attorney General, Janet Reno, would not support him if he chose to take the dispute with the DoD to court. Also, many of Roth's senate colleagues, including John McCain, were asking him to \\"back off\\". Thus, Roth decided to drop the matter and continue preparing the report without the testimony of Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin. For the first time in U.S. history, the DoD had refused to comply with a U.S. Senate subpoena.Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 252; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 254‚Äì56. In January 1997 U.S. Senator Fred Thompson became chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and terminated the Black Hawk investigation. The senate investigation report was never publicly released. Asked in 2001 about the DoD's refusal to honor the Senate subpoenas, Thorson responded, \\"Basically they told the United States Senate to go to hell.\\"CBS News, \\"'A Great Deal of Arrogance'\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 262‚Äì63, Novak, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\" GAO investigation In September 1995 the House National Security Subcommittee on Military Personnel, chaired by Bob Dornan, requested that the Government Accountability Office (GAO) conduct its own investigation into the shootdown incident. Specifically, the GAO was asked to determine if the USAF accident investigation board had met its objectives, if the subsequent military justice investigations had followed established guidelines, and if the DoD and/or USAF had improperly or unlawfully influenced these investigations.GAO report; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 251; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 241‚Äì42; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 65. The GAO released its investigation report on 12 November 1997. The investigation determined that the USAF accident investigation was properly convened and met its assigned objectives. The GAO report, however, found that the USAF investigation had failed to note that Wickson and May neglected to report their contact with unidentified aircraft to the Duke (Martin) aboard the AWACS as required by the ROE. Furthermore, the USAF investigation report incorrectly stated that Martin had no authority to terminate the engagement when, in fact, he did. The GAO report added that the failure of Wickson and May to report their contact to Martin was indicative of a well-known, general lack of discipline among F-15 aircrews involved in OPC and this was not discussed in the USAF report.GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 252‚Äì53; Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 65, Hall; Michael, My Son, pp. 274‚Äì82. The GAO investigation also uncovered evidence that a rivalry between F-15 and F-16 pilots may have contributed to Wickson's and May's \\"urgency to engage hostile aircraft\\" but was not discussed in the USAF investigation.GAO, pp. 32‚Äì33, discussed in Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 96. During the GAO's investigation, USAF OPC officers confirmed that the rivalry between the F-15 and F-16 communities was particularly pronounced and intense partly due to the fact that F-16 aircraft had scored all the air-to-air combat kills in Iraq and Bosnia since the end of the Gulf War. Pilkington stated to the GAO that \\"the shootdown pilots' haste was due in part to the planned entry of two F-16s into the TAOR 10 to 15 minutes after the F-15s and that if the F-15 pilots had involved the chain of command, the pace would have slowed down, ruining the pilots' chances for a shootdown.\\" The GAO concluded that if the evidence of a lack of mission discipline by Wickson and May had been included in the USAF report, such information \\"could have been useful in subsequent administrative and disciplinary actions.\\"GAO, pp. 32‚Äì33, discussed in Snook, Friendly Fire, p. 96; Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 252‚Äì53; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 274‚Äì82. Another aspect the GAO investigation revealed was that the training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training was accomplished by reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters made up only about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.Snook, \\"Friendly Fire\\", p. 96. The GAO found no evidence of improper or unlawful command influence by USAF leaders on the investigation or subsequent administrative and military justice actions. The GAO noted, however, that it was unable to obtain complete confirmation of this finding because the DoD denied the GAO request to interview key USAF officials including Santarelli, Dallager, Starr, and Mangin.Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 252‚Äì53; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 251, 262; GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\"; Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 274‚Äì82. Compensation On 26 August 1994, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it would pay U.S.$100,000 (ex gratia) in compensation to the families of each of the non-U.S. personnel killed in the incident. At this time, the U.S. government did not offer compensation to the families of the U.S. victims, citing the Feres precedent, which prevents lawsuits against the U.S. from injured service members or families of personnel killed due to military negligence. This was the first time the U.S. had offered compensation to the victims of a friendly fire incident.Diehl, Silent Knights, pp. 51, 245; Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 145‚Äì50; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 162. The US Government also paid $100 in compensation to Kurdish farmer Mohammed Amin Khorshid for damage to his onion field caused by the crash of one of the two helicopters (Hall, p. 162). In 1998, Congressman Lamar S. Smith, chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, held hearings on the compensation issue. He questioned the DoD representatives as to why compensation had not also been offered to the U.S. family members. In November 1999 the U.S. Congress passed legislation authorizing payment of compensation to the families of the American Black Hawk victims.Piper, Chain of Events, pp. 264, 269; Diehl, Silent Knights, p. 326. Aftermath Frankfurt Rhein-Main International Airport, Germany, on 15 April 1994 Five days after the shootdown, USAF OPC officials began including Black Hawk flight times in the daily ATO and included the correct IFF code in the ATO provided to Eagle Flight.Washington, \\"So, Who's to Blame?\\"; GAO, \\"Operation Provide Comfort\\" OPC officially ended on 31 December 1996. Over the six years of the operation, coalition participants flew a total of 62,000 fixed-wing and rotary-wing sorties. The Black Hawk shootdown was the only serious accident to occur during the operation.Piper, Chain of Events, p. 258. Wickson resigned and May retired from the USAF soon after Fogleman's investigation was complete.Chu Lin, \\"Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang\\"; Piper, Chain of Events, p. 196; Hall, Michael, My Son, p. 276. Hall says May retired at the lower rank of major. Hall says he asked repeatedly for Wickson to contact him to discuss the shootdown but Wickson never responded (Hall, p. 304). Lawrence Tracy retired immediately after Wang's court-martial on an early (15-year) retirement option.Piper, Chain of Events, p. 216. By May 2005, Jim Wang was still serving in the USAF, but he remained at the rank of captain, having been denied promotion.Chu Lin, Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang. Hall states that after his court martial, Wang called the victims' family members and apologized. Interviewed in 2005 about the shootdown, Tracy stated, \\"Jim (Wang) and all of us at first were held up as scapegoats. I think that was to cover up for the pilots. They had their fangs out. They wanted to kill something because it had been ages since an F-15 had shot anything down. We were held accountable for their actions.\\"Chu Lin, \\"Friendly Fire Doesn't Shoot Down Wang\\". Andrus retired from the USAF in 1995, Pilkington in 1996, Emery in 1997, and Santarelli in 1998, all at the same rank they held at the time of the shootdown, except Emery, who retired as a brigadier general. Richardson was promoted to brigadier general on 1July 1999 and retired on 1September 2001. Dallager was appointed as superintendent of the USAF Academy in June 2000 and was promoted to lieutenant general on 1August of the same year. Dallager's appointment and promotion were criticized by observers because of his involvement in the controversial shootdown after-actions and refusal to testify for the senate investigation. Dallager retired on 1September 2003, but at the rank of major general.Novak, \\"Past Fiasco dims General's new Third Star\\", USAF, Official biographies of Andrus, Croker, Dallager, Emery, Pilkington, Richardson, and Santarelli. A monument to the 26 victims of the shootdown was constructed at Giebelstadt Army Airfield, Germany and dedicated on 14 April 1996. After U.S. military presence ceased at Giebelstadt, due to base closures, the monument was moved to Fort Rucker, Alabama on 10 March 2006, and rededicated on 14 April 2007.Eagle Flight Detachment Memorial Monument Friends Hall, Michael, My Son, pp. 212, 226. Four hundred people attended that dedication ceremony at Giebelstadt. A videoteleconference room at the Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency at Kelly Field Annex was named in honor of Cornelius Bass on 26 March 1998 (Hall, p. 293). \\"The 53rd FS 'Tigers' never fully recovered from the dark blemish on their otherwise exemplary record. The only way the USAF could make the issue and the pain go away was by closing the unit. This was done on 10 March 1999, leaving USAFE with only one Eagle squadron for the next war in its theater.\\"Davies, Steve, and Dildy, Doug (2007).

He is best remembered for his part in the introduction of roundarm bowling. He played mainly for Sussex and made 102 known appearances in first-class cricket from 1814 to 1840.CricketArchive. Retrieved on 28 June 2009. He represented the Players in the Gentlemen v Players series and the South in the North v. South series. Cricket career Born on 25 June 1795 in Duncton, Petworth, Sussex, Jem Broadbridge had a known career spanning the 1814 to 1840 English seasons. In 102 matches, he scored 2671 runs at a Batting average of 16.59 runs per innings with a highest score of 135. He took 51 catches and 324 wickets. He had an outstanding season in 1825 when inter-county cricket was revived for the first time since 1796 with Sussex playing two matches each against Hampshire and Kent. Broadbridge scored the most runs in the season with 552 at an average of 46.00 and also took the most wickets with 31. This was the first time that one player had led both the batting and bowling rankings in a single season. Broadbridge repeated the feat in 1828, the year after the roundarm trial matches, when he scored 316 runs at 19.75 and took 46 wickets. Although roundarm had not yet been formally legalised, it was noted that Broadbridge and his Sussex colleague William Lillywhite constantly bowled with arm outstretched and the umpires did not no-ball them. Roundarm became known as \\"Sussex bowling\\" and this nickname stuck for a long time. In 1829, Broadbridge was joint top batsman with William Searle, both scoring 265 runs. Broadbridge averaged 18.92 and Searle 20.38. In 1830, he topped the bowling again, taking 27 wickets. Broadbridge had been arguably the best player in England during the 1820s but he was past his best in the 1830s, although he still had much to offer in terms of knowledge and experience. He continued playing until the 1840 season. Roundarm controversy Broadbridge and Lillywhite were innovators who did much to have roundarm bowling legalised. In the 1827 season, three roundarm trial matches were staged between Sussex and All-England to evaluate roundarm vis-√†-vis underarm. Broadbridge and Lillywhite were allowed to bowl roundarm for Sussex but the All-England players had to bowl underarm. The result of the \\"trial\\" was inconclusive but in practice, with umpires turning a blind eye, Broadbridge and Lillywhite continued to bowl roundarm without penalty. Style and technique Known to his fellow cricketers as \\"Our Jem\\", Broadbridge was arguably the outstanding all-rounder of his time. According to Arthur Haygarth in Scores and Biographies, he was \\"considered for some seasons the best general cricketer in England, both as a batsman, bowler and single wicket player\\".Arthur Haygarth, Scores & Biographies, Volume 1, p.403. He bowled right arm fast medium and batted right-handed. He was described by Haygarth as \\"an extremely hard hitter\\". The bowling of Broadbridge and Lillywhite was the key factor in the success of Sussex, which was hailed as the Champion County in the 1820s. Haygarth says that Broadbridge began as a \\"slinging\\" bowler who afterwards delivered roundarm. He was quicker than medium pace but varied his length and speed \\"with effect\\". Broadbridge was described as \\"one of the most fox-headed fellows that ever bowled and was enough to worry and puzzle any man alive\\".H S Altham, A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914), p.65. In the third of the roundarm trial matches in 1827, Broadbridge was out to one of the most unusual dismissals ever recorded. Despite his team having been told to bat steadily in their second innings when chasing 120 to win, Broadbridge at the start literally threw his bat out of his hands at a wide delivery. Bat and ball made contact and the ball flew off to point where it was caught by William Ward and Broadbridge was out. England then won by 25 runs. He died 12 February 1843, Duncton Family and personal life Broadbridge belonged to a farming family and lived all his life at Duncton. He regularly walked from Duncton to Brighton and back (a sixty-mile round trip) to play cricket.CricInfo. Retrieved on 29 June 2009. He was the son of William and Mary Broadbridge. His height was 5 ft 10in and he weighed about 12 stones. He died unmarried at the age of 47 only a couple of years after he finished playing cricket. His elder brother William (1790‚Äì1860) was an occasional Sussex player in 25 matches between 1817 and 1830. His younger brother Robin (born 1797) played four matches between 1822 and 1824. The Broadbridge brothers were cousins of their Sussex colleague George Millyard. Broadbridge's home village of Duncton has a pub named The Cricketers in honour of himself and his colleague Jemmy Dean, another lifelong resident.

A schooner-barge is a type of ship that functions like a barge, in that it is towed by a steamship, but also has sails like a schooner. This type of ship evolved from wooden sailing ships that were cut down into barges and towed behind wooden steamships, a practice which originated in the late 1880s in coastal areas. This design was used in the Great Lakes for transporting grain, iron ore, and other products. History Madeira was built at the Chicago yard of the Chicago Shipbuilding Company in 1900 primarily of heavy steel plates that were riveted together, with wood joinery used in other places. The ship had a flat plate keel and was shaped very flat and full to maximize cargo capacity. The career of the ship is mostly unknown, except for some notoriety gained when it struck the former Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge at Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan in 1902. Final voyage On November 28, 1905, Madeira, under tow of the steamer William Edenborn, was caught in a fierce storm with winds around 70 to 80 miles per hour, blowing snow onto the deck and kicking up huge swells. The captain of William Edenborn feared the loss of his ship and made the decision to cut the Madeira loose. Some speculated at the time that the crew tried to set anchor and ride out the storm, but the wreck site later revealed that both anchors were still intact at the bow. About two hours after it was cut loose, Madeira crashed into a cliff named Gold Rock. One of the crewmen leapt to shore with a safety line and was able to bring eight other men to safety. The first mate went down with the ship. Two days later, the tugboat Edna G rescued the stranded crewmen. Wreck In 1955, divers from the Frigid Frogs dive club in Duluth, Minnesota, first explored the wreck, but reported that there was little or no treasure on board. In 1960, a salvage company purchased the rights to the ship from the Pittsburgh Steamship Division of U.S. Steel Corporation. Divers removed one of the anchors and the ship's wheel, which were sold to the nearby Split Rock Trading Post. In 1974, a wrecking crew spent significant effort salvaging steel from Madeira. The ship currently lies broken in three sections. The bow is upside-down in 40 to 50 feet (12.2 to 15.2 meters) of water, and the stern, containing a large steam winch and open hatches, lies on its starboard side at 65 feet (19.8 meters). A small, roofless pilot house is at 75 feet (22.9 meters).

He was the son of Archibald Campbell, 2nd Earl of Argyll and Elizabeth Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 1st Earl of Lennox.Watt and Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 46; Kirk, \\"Campbell, Donald (d. 1562)\\". From 1522, he was a student of St Salvator's College, at the University of St Andrews.Kirk, \\"Campbell, Donald (d. 1562)\\". After graduation, he became a cleric in his home diocese, the diocese of Argyll. Biography=Abbot of Coupar Angus In May 1525, King James V of Scotland recommended Campbell's appointment as Abbot of Coupar Angus, a recommendation confirmed by parliament in the following year - despite the fact that the monks of Coupar Angus Abbey had already elected one of their brothers, Alexander Spens, to the position in early 1524.Watt and Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 46. In September 1529, the papacy agreed that Campbell could hold the abbey for eight months in commendam, providing that if he did not become a monk in this period the abbey would thereafter be regarded as vacant; the following February, 1530, he received an eight-month extension to this. Campbell seems to have complied, and was in France in the following months. Donald was back in Scotland in 1532, attending parliament that year. In May 1533, he was given a five-year appointment as commissioner of the Chapter-General of the Scottish Cistercian Order. While delegating the ordinary business of the abbey to monks, kinsmen and friends, and in Scotland held a variety of high-profile political offices in this period, including Senator of the College of Justice (July 1541), Lord of the Articles for the parliaments of March and December 1543 and was a member of the Privy Council (June 1545); he had visited France again in 1536. Bishopric of Dunkeld In 1549 he secured crown nomination to the bishopric of Dunkeld from the Governor of Scotland, James Hamilton, Duke of Ch√¢tellerault.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. The vacancy was caused by the translation of the previous bishop, John Hamilton, to the archbishopric of St Andrews in 1547.Foggie, Janet P., \\"Hamilton, John (1510/11‚Äì1571)\\". His appointment was opposed by one Robert Crichton. Crichton was the nephew of George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, who had died in 1544, and had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle the year before the latter's death - without the consent of the Scottish government.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 88-92; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. The government thus ignored the appointment, placing Hamilton in charge. Robert litigated - unsuccessfully - against Hamilton in the Papal see.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 88-92 When Hamilton was translated, Crichton was still litigating. The dispute continued into 1553. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Ch√¢tellerault in 1554, she acknowledged Crichton's position and Campbell appears to have given up the bishopric. In this year, perhaps in compensation, he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal, a position he held until his death in 1562. Brechin and the Reformation By 1558, and perhaps as early as 1557, Campbell pursued another bishopric, the bishopric of Brechin, possibly receiving a nomination from Mary of Guise.See Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 190, and Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 41. The vacancy had been caused by the death of Bishop John Hepburn in the early summer of 1557.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 190; but compare Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 41. Campbell's proctor in Rome, John Row, attempted to gain permission for his master to abandon the dress Cistercian monk and to hold the bishopric of Brechin with the abbacy of Coupar Angus.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 191. Campbell never seems to have been awarded the see. Campbell's ambition for Brechin was overtaken by the events of the Scottish Reformation. Although he was present at the burning of the Protestant Walter Milne in April 1558, in the following year Abbot Campbell himself became a Protestant and, at the urging of the Lords of the Congregation, abandoned monastic habit, banned mass from his monastery and destroyed its icons and altars. In the following year he attended the Reformation Parliament which severed Scotland's ties with Rome. He died sometime between 16 December 1562 and 20 January 1563.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 41. He is said to have left five illegitimate sons, who were later declared legitimate in order that they might inherit estates of property given to them from the tracts of land formerly belonging to the Catholic Church and redistributed by the state post-Reformation.Warden, Angus or Forfarshire, p6 NotesReferences * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed.

This non-combat operation resulted in the transfer of roughly 20,000 people from Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay back to contiguous United States, by way of Cebu, Philippines. The commanding general, 13th USAF, was in command of the joint task force.  Timeline  ;16 July 1990: A 7.8 earthquake strikes the island of Luzon, Philippines. The epicenter was near the town of Rizal, Nueva Ecija, roughly from Mount Pinatubo. This earthquake caused a landslide, some local tremors, and a brief increase in steam emissions from a preexisting geothermal area at Mount Pinatubo. ;March‚ÄìJune 1991: Magma rising toward the surface from more than beneath Mount Pinatubo triggered small earthquakes and caused powerful steam explosions that blasted three craters on the north flank of the volcano. Thousands of small earthquakes occurred beneath Pinatubo, and many thousands of tons of sulfur dioxide gas were emitted by the volcano. ;7 June 1991: First magmatic eruptions, resulting in the formation of a high lava dome at the summit of the volcano. Evacuees at Andersen Air Force Base ;10 June 1991: after receiving final authorization from the Secretary of Defense, all non-essential military and Department of Defense civilian personnel and their dependents initiated land evacuation from Clark Air Base at 0600 local time. This land evacuation brought an estimated 15,000 personnel and several thousand vehicles onto U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. ;12‚Äì14 June 1991: Several waves of eruptions generated eruption columns up to in altitude and pyroclastic flows (high speed avalanches of superheated gas and tephra) extending out to from the summit. These eruptions were accompanied by nearly continuous seismic activity and expulsion of huge quantities of ash, tephra, and volcanic bombs. ;15 June 1991: Major eruption of Mount Pinatubo, sending ash and tephra over into the air. Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station, the two largest U.S. military bases in the Philippines, were heavily damaged by ash from this volcanic eruption. Nearly one foot of ash sodden by rain from Typhoon Yunya (1991) accumulated on both Clark Air Base and U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay. Many buildings collapsed under the weight of the accumulated ash, and all flight operations were suspended at both bases for many days or even weeks afterwards.  Aftermath  CH-53 on The 1991 Ultra-Plinian eruption of Mount Pinatubo was the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century (surpassed only by the 1912 eruption of Novarupta), and the largest eruption in living memory. The eruption produced high-speed pyroclastic flows, giant lahars, and a cloud of volcanic ash hundreds of miles across. Twenty million tons of sulfur dioxide and roughly of tephra are estimated to have been ejected in total, which corresponds to a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6. By contrast, roughly of material was ejected in the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens; this corresponds to a VEI of 5. Very few of the estimated 20,000 who left the base ever returned. The vast majority were evacuated to Andersen Air Force Base, Guam and processed for return to the continental United States. This figure includes approximately 5,000 who were evacuated to Cebu City on , , , , , USS Gary, , USS Lake Champlain, and seventeen other U.S. Navy ships of the task force including the forward deployed Guam based WW2 sub tender USS Proteus AS-19. The USS Cape Cod AD-43 was the first ship to enter Subic Bay and provided fresh water, manufactured coffins and volcanic ash shovels to assist SRF Subic Bay and the base with recovery and rescue operations. ;22 June 1991: A team of 11 engineers and utility systems specialists from Headquarters Pacific Air Forces and the 554th Rapid Engineer Deployable Heavy Operational Repair Squadron Engineers arrives at Clark Air Base to assess the damage caused by Mount Pinatubo to determine the fate of the base. ;12 July 1991: U.S. Secretary of the Air Force announces U.S. Air Force will leave the Philippines no later than 16 September 1992. ;4 September 1991: A lahar, high and almost wide, smashed along the southern boundary of Clark Air Base, sweeping away a security policeman who was subsequently rescued. ;5 November 1991: Secretary of the Air Force visits Clark Air Base and pays tribute to the \\"Ash Warriors\\", personnel who had remained throughout the volcanic activity and cleanup. ;26 November 1991: American flag lowered for the last time by the Ash Warriors; Clark Air Base turned over to the Philippines, ending over 90 years of U.S. presence.

It later served as an inspiration for G.rev's Border Down, including its \\"beam level\\" system.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot featuring Apartheid, the first boss of the game, showcasing an example of 'beam-dueling' in Metal Black. The blue beam on the left is the player's beam. Metal Black is a scrolling shooter game where players assume the role of rogue pilot John Ford taking control of the CF-345 Black Fly space fighter craft across six increasingly difficult rounds to combat against the Nemesis alien race and save humanity. The gameplay is unique in that there are no alternative weapons or bombs; the only power-up players grab through rounds are the Newalone molecules scattered by Nemesis. Colleting it increases the ship's beam level, serving as the only defense mechanism. The more Newalone molecules players collect, the stronger their firepower becomes. When reaching a mid or max beam level, players can unleash a large beam to obliterate enemies caught within its range and cause a lightning effect that briefly shocks the screen, destroy enemies around the ship consequentially. Certain enemies also have beam levels of their own, most notably the bosses at the end of each round, who in turn eat as much Newalone as they can to unleash their own beam. If the players and boss' large beam are fired simultaneously, one overpowers the other depending how high each level is, initiating a \\"beam duel\\". When \\"beam dueling\\", players must quickly tap the fire button to keep the opposing beam at bay, accumulating into a destructive energy matter that changes color based on which wielder's beam is stronger. After the first and third rounds, a bonus round occurs to indicate players' advancement into space. Each bonus round has players encircle a group of enemies that must be destroyed by locking on the moving targets and launch cluster missiles under a time limit to gain extra points. Getting hit by enemy fire or colliding against solid stage obstacles will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing.  Synopsis  The plot summary of Metal Black is explained further through supplementary materials. In the year 2042, a companion star of the planet Jupiter appears a few astronomical units away from the planet and propels the asteroids along Jupiter's orbit towards the Earth, creating a wave of meteorites. As the Earthlings struggle to survive, extraterrestrial cybernetic invaders from beyond the distant star use the meteorites as cover to invade Earth with little resistance, intending to plunder Earth for inorganic materials needed to sustain their forms. Both the aliens and the star they came from are quickly named 'Nemesis.' What resistance the aliens face from Earth's combined international defense forces is quickly obliterated by the aliens' powerful beam weapons. Earth's scientists study the molecules that power the alien weaponry, which have started to litter the Earth, and the molecule is given the name 'Newalone.' With Newalone in their hands, scientists quickly begin Project Metal Black, focused on developing at least twenty-thousand human spacecraft capable of wielding the same beam-weaponry as the aliens. The spacecraft is known as the CF-345 Black Fly, named for its method of Newalone energy use. However, ten years after the invasion, Earth's remaining diplomats pass a treaty with the Nemesis forces outlining a peaceful surrender, which promises to keep all of Earth's remaining forces from attacking: This applies to Project Metal Black, preventing the Black Fly spacecraft's use. With the planet's population thinning and natural resources depleting, a rogue pilot named John Ford commandeers one of the Black Fly craft in violation of the treaty, intending to strike back against Nemesis and save what remains of humanity. The events within the game itself unfold over six stages as Ford pilots the Black Fly and travels to Jupiter, confronting powerful Nemesis ships along the way. In the final two stages, Ford breaches Nemesis itself, earning a crucial chance to defeat the invading forces once and for all. From this point, there are two possible endings: If the player gets a Game Over on the final stage, Ford's death incites a military coup d'√©tat of the global government, and 20,000 Black Fly craft are dispatched to Nemesis's apparent origin point. Otherwise, Ford confronts the leader of Nemesis in a rapidly-shifting dimension, the battle apparently culminating with the Earth being split in two; it is left unclear as to whether the Earth's destruction and the events of the game as a whole ever actually occurred.  Development  Metal Black was developed under the working title \\"Project Gun Frontier 2\\" by most of the same staff behind Gun Frontier, including its designer Takatsuna Senba and producer Takamasa \\"Tarabar\\" Hori, however its actual connection to the latter is faint at best.  Release  Metal Black was released in arcades on November 1991. Prior to launch, it was showcased in a playable state to attendees at the 1991 Amusement Machine Show. The game ran on Taito's F1 System hardware, using expansion chips that allowed special graphical effects. A version named after Mori titled Metal Black: Tarabar Edition was created for internal use at Tatio and not released for arcades, featuring only three stages and different music as well as a new \\"extra stage\\" and more difficult enemy patterns. On January 21, 1992, an album containing music from the game was co-published exclusively in Japan by Scitron and Pony Canyon. The title was later ported to the Sega Saturn by Ving and published only in Japan on May 24, 1996 under the \\"Arcade Gears\\" budget line. It has since been included as part of the Taito Legends 2 compilation for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2006. In 2012, a compilation album containing its soundtrack, as well as the music from Gun Frontier and Dino Rex was released by SuperSweep in Japan.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Metal Black on their February 1, 1992 issue as being the thirdteenth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Famitsu gave the Sega Saturn version a score of 20 out of 40.  Legacy  A similar \\"beam duel\\" system was featured in G-Darius. Hiroyuki Maruyama of G.rev stated that Metal Black was a heavy inspiration during development Border Down, including its \\"beam level\\" system and also features references to the former in other ways. The CF-345 Black Fly appears as a downloadable ship in Dariusburst: Chronicle Saviours for PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita.

It also starred George Hamilton as Flor√®s, a revolutionary leader. It was co-written and directed by Louis Malle, and filmed in Eastman Color. It was released in both French and an English-dubbed version. Plot synopsis In 1907, in a Central American country called San Miguel, Maria II (Brigitte Bardot), the daughter of an Irish Republican anarchist, meets Maria I (Jeanne Moreau), the singer of a circus. After her father dies, Maria II hides in the circus where she sees Maria I's partner commit suicide after a failed love affair. Both Marias agree to form a theatrical team. In her debut as a singer, Maria II accidentally invents striptease, an action that lets the circus achieve great fame. Shortly afterwards the Marias meet Flor√®s (George Hamilton), a socialist revolutionary. He invites them to join his cause, a revolution against \\"El Dictador\\" (Jos√© √Ångel Espinoza). But Flor√®s is soon shot. On his deathbed he makes Maria I promise to carry through with his cause and she agrees. Though at first reluctant to acquiesce to Flor√®s' and Maria I's endeavor, Maria II joins the cause when she comes to the aid of her vulnerable friend. The rest of the film concerns the revolution. After Maria I leads her men into an ambush, and Maria II saves them, the women create a peasant army, organizing the countryside into a quasi-Socialist state. There are numerous sight gags and comic actions. Preparing to take the capital city, the Marias are captured by Catholic churchmen who fear the disorder of a revolution and want to stop the people from treating the women like saints. After a bungled attempt to tickle torture them (the Inquisition's equipment is too old to work well) the Marias are rescued by their victorious army. Finally they move to France, where the circus is recreated as a successful musical version of the revolution. The women now wear dark wigs to look more \\"Latin American\\". Cast * Jeanne Moreau as Maria I * Brigitte Bardot as Marie Fitzgerald O'Malley (Maria II) * George Hamilton as Flores * Paulette Dubost as Mme Diog√®ne * Claudio Brook as The Great Rodolfo * Carlos L√≥pez Moctezuma as Rodr√≠guez (as Carlos Lopez Moctezuma) * Poldo Bendandi as Werther * Gregor von Rezzori as Diog√®ne (as Gregor Von Rezzori) * Francisco Reiguera as Father Superior * Jonathan Eden as Juanito Diog√®ne * Roberto Pedret as Pablo * Jos√© √Ångel Espinosa 'Ferrusquilla' as The Dictator of San Miguel (as Jos√© √Ångel Espinoza) Production=Development According to Jeff Stafford of Turner Classic Movies, \\"Malle's idea [was] to take a buddy movie and subvert it. For inspiration, he instructed Carri√®re to consider the Gary Cooper ‚Äì Burt Lancaster relationship in Vera Cruz (1954), which was a favorite Western of the two collaborators. By replacing the traditional male protagonists with two strong females, Viva Maria! not only worked as an amusing gender twist on a popular formula but was seen in some quarters as a political statement. Malle said German filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder later told him that Viva Maria! fascinated him and his fellow students at Berlin University. Malle recalled, 'It was a time of those radical student movements, and they saw in the heroines the two different approaches to revolution.'\\" Malle conceived of the film as \\"a sort of burlesque boxing match--sexpot v. seductress\\"; he got the film financed on the condition that Moreau commit to the project. The male lead was George Hamilton, whom Malle cast on the strength of his performance in Two Weeks in Another Town. Malle said \\"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him... He's more interested in being in the social columns ‚Äì I don't understand ‚Äì when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\\" Shooting Moreau and Bardot became \\"like two pals in the army\\" after 16 weeks of principal photography in Mexico, including Texcoco. Filming started 18 January 1965. An extra was killed during filming when he fell off an ox cart. Filming was also held up when Bardot fell ill. Dialogue is in English, French, Spanish, and German, depending on the actor. The French version includes extensive English subtitles. Reception=Critical Time called it a \\"jaunty but slipshod farce\\"; \\"Having saddled himself with an idea that often seems too silly for words, Director Malle rides to the rescue with more anti-state, anti-church, antedated spoofery than he can gracefully handle. His rhythm is erratic, as though he were trying to make a movie in five or six different styles at the same time, none wholly his own. But even the deadly slow stretches are redeemed by cameraman Henri Deca√´, whose breathtakingly sophisticated photography is a show in itself, imperceptibly shaded as the action moves from lush Rousseau tropics to the cabaret scenes that exude a smoky golden haze in which Moreau and Bardot appear like creatures of Lautrec or Degas, ineffably alluring.\\" According to Variety, the film has \\"B.B. in her best form since And God Created Woman, and brilliantly matched by Jeanne Moreau. They are backed by a rollicking, comic adventure opus impeccably brought off by director Louis Malle.\\" Box office The film was a box office hit in France with 3,450,559 attendees.Box office information for Viva Maria at Box Office Story It was the ninth most popular film of 1965 in France, after The Sucker, Goldfinger, Thunderball, Gendarme in New York, Mary Poppins, Fantomas Unleashed, God's Thunder and The Wise Guys. It grossed $875,000 in rentals in the U.S. and $4,875,000 in rentals worldwide. In Dallas, Texas, the film was banned for its sexual and anti-Catholic content; the ban was lifted by default in 1968, when the United States Supreme Court struck down the ban and limited the ability of municipalities to ban films for adults in Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. City of Dallas. In 2010, Viva Maria! was exhibited at the 21st Ankara International Film Festival as part of a \\"Power and Rebellion\\" programme. Awards Both Moreau and Bardot were nominated for Best Foreign Actress at the 20th British Academy Film Awards; Jeanne Moreau won the award. Home video MGM/UA released Viva Maria! on VHS in February 1994. The last minute of the movie, depicting the women singing a song in Spanish on stage, was cut after the film's New York premiere. MGM Technical Services archivist John Kirk was able to restore this final scene to the laserdisc release in 1998. The version shown on MGM's This TV cable channel includes the scene.

The peak lies on the border of Tamilnadu and Kerala.Google Maps This peak is a part of the Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve which lies on the border between the Indian states of Kerala (in Pathanamthitta, Kollam and Thiruvananthapuram districts) and Tamil Nadu (in Kanyakumari district, Tirunelveli district). The perennial Thamirabarani River originates from the eastern side of the range and flows into the Tirunelveli district of Tamil Nadu. Agasthyarkoodam is a pilgrimage centre for devotees of the Hindu sage Agastya, who is considered to be one of the seven rishis (Saptarishi) of Hindu Puranas. In Tamil traditions, Agastya is considered as the father of the Tamil language and the compiler of the first Tamil grammar called Agattiyam or Akattiyam.[Richard S Weiss 2009, p. 50‚Äì51, 81‚Äì82] and [Klaus Klostermaier (2003), A Concise Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Oxford: Oneworld Publications, , page 17] and also the Malayalam language is considered to be born from Agasthya. There is a small stone statue of Agathiyar at the top of the peak and the devotees can offer pujas themselves. Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve is among 20 new sites added by UNESCO to its World Network of Biosphere Reserves in March 2016. The International Co- ordinating Council added the new sites during a two-day meeting on 19 March 2016 in Lima, bringing the total number of biosphere reserves to 669 sites in 120 countries, including 16 transboundary sites.It includes close to 300 rare bird species and more than 200 medicinal plants found only here. Geography Agasthyarkoodam is 32 km from Neyyar Dam and 23 km from Bonacaud, near Ponmudi. The major city and airport nearest to Agasthyarkoodam is Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) and its Trivandrum International Airport, around 61 km away. The nearest railway stations are Thiruvanathapuram, Kerala and Ambasamudram, Tirunelveli District, Tamil Nadu. The trekking path, nearly 35 km, is from Bonacaud. Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve is part of the Agasthyarkoodam range. Part of the peak can be seen from the Upper Kodayar region. A view of the Agasthyamalai range from Upper Kodayar Other major rivers which originate from the mountain are the Karamana River, which flows through the Thiruvananthapuram district and is the major source of drinking water to the city, and the Neyyar River (also in the Thiruvananthapuram district).  Trekking routes  Athirumala Base Station in Agastya Mala The peak of Agasthyarkoodam can be reached only by trekking up to it. Trekking is allowed based on strict guidelines and is open to pilgrims during January to mid-March. Trekking passes are issued by Kerala Forest Department from the district office at Trivandrum. The trekking route starts from Bonacaud. The route \\"Neyyar-Agasthyakoodam\\" is not open to the public. Vehicles reach only till Bonacaud which is around 50 km from Thiruvananthapuram. The trek to the peak is 20 km long from Bonacaud and requires two days. The first part of the trek can be started from the base station Bonacaud in the early morning and is 14 km through the forest to the camp. Elephants and wild bulls are in abundance in this part especially in the evenings. The final part i.e. the 6 km long trek can be done from the camp to the top of Agathyakoodam mountain on the second day.

Agasthyakoodam Trek Route Vegetation The lower elevations of this peak are known for their abundance of rare herbs and medicinal plants. Around 2,000 medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic treatments are found here. Europeans, particularly those from England, were the first to establish tea gardens around the base stations of the mountain at Brimore, Bonacaud, and Ponmudi. The Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve harbours rare flora and fauna. Tourists are permitted to the area only with permission from the forest department of Kerala. Annual trekking passes to the peak are issued from the forest department during January‚ÄìFebruary only. Important places Murti of Agasthya Muni at the top of Agasthyamalai hill Manjolai Hills Between elevations ranging from 1000 to 1500 metres, the Manjolai area is set deep within the Western Ghats within the Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve in the Tirunelveli District. Located on top of the Manimuthar Dam and the Manimuthar Water Falls, the Manjolai area has tea plantations, small settlements around the tea plantations, Upper Kodaiyar Dam, and a windy view point called Kuthiravetti. The tea plantations and the whole of Manjolai Estates are operated by the Bombay Burmah Trading Corporation Ltd on forest lands leased by the singampatti zamin. There are three tea estates in the Manjolai area -- Manjolai Estate, Manimutharu Estate, and Oothu Estate. The estates are on elevations ranging between .

Online reservation for Agasthyarkoodam visit  Online Reservation can be done using the site.  Former status prohibiting women  Prior to November 2018, women were forbidden to climb Agasthyarkoodam. After a court ruling which removed the prohibition, a woman, Dhanya Sanal an Indian Information Service officer, reached the peak in 2019, becoming the first woman known to make the climb. Since the change in the law, more than 100 other women have registered for a license to make the climb. On 17 January 2020, 71 years old Visalakshi Amma (from Coimbatore) along with her son (Vandhan) and daughter-in-law (Lakshmy Kolary) embarked on the Trek. On 18th She successfully scaled up to the PongalaPara and went beyond close to the first ropeway. But due to unfavorable climatic conditions (rain and dense fog) and health concerns of her accomplices forced her to return to the camp without scaling the peak (2 km short). She garnered huge respect and adulations from all those who had trekked and present during the period at the camp. Many said they drew inspiration from her for her grit and determination and fondly called her \\"Trekker Ammumma\\".

He is a Grammy Award winner, and has worked on over 100 Gold and Platinum records. Biography Born to a musical family, Kernon's formal musical training began at the age of 4, when he started classical piano lessons, and at the age of 7 he took up classical guitar. At the age of 17, after leaving school, he got a job at Trident Studios in London as a tea boy. After six months he was promoted to tape op, and after that to assistant engineer / engineer. Working at Trident was a great opportunity for him to learn from some of the top producers and engineers in the business, and also to have the opportunity to work in various different capacities on albums by artists as varied as Elton John, David Bowie, Thin Lizzy, Neil Sedaka, Marc Bolan, Yes, Jimmy Webb, Ace, Colin Blunstone, Hawkwind, Judas Priest, Linda Ronstadt, Mick Ronson, Queen, Strawbs, Supertramp, The Tremeloes, Peter Hammill, Stephane Grappelli, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, Billy Cobham, Stanley Clarke, Lenny White, and Brand X to name a few. After several years, he left Trident and moved to France to work at Le Chateau D'Herouville studios in Pontoise, just outside Paris. After a fairly uneventful six months there, he was offered a job back in the UK, doing studio recording and mixing work, as well as live sound for the progressive rock group Yes. After a couple of years working for Yes, Kernon once again became freelance, and worked at a number of studios in and around London for the next several years. Studios worked at during that time included Jam, Decibel, Trident, The Farmyard and Startling Studios in Tittenhurst Park, owned by Ringo Starr, where he worked for three years as chief in-house engineer. After that, Kernon started doing production and mixing work in the US, and moved to New York. Through the years, Kernon has worked at many other studios worldwide, and in particular: * (New York) - Electric Lady, Hit Factory, Power Station, Media Sound, Platinum Island, Kampo Cultural Center, Quad, Right Track, Bearsville * (Los Angeles) - Record Plant, Amigo, One on One, Music Grinder, Rumbo Recorders, Sound City, Total Access (Redondo Beach) Dodge City (Glendale) * (El Paso, TX) - Village Productions / Sonic Ranch (72 albums completed between 1994 and 2005) * (Seattle, WA) - Robert Lang Studios * (Switzerland) - Mountain Studios, Montreux. * (Italy) - Jungle Sound Station, Milan * (France) - Chateau Miraval, Provence, Chateau D'Herouville, Pontoise. Neil has worked on the production of well over 500 albums to date, produced songs for 10 major motion pictures and, in addition, has played guitar and/or keyboards on over 40 albums. He has worked with a large number of artists over the last 40 years, but may be best known for his work with Hall & Oates on three of their most important albums ‚Äì 1980's Voices, 1981's Private Eyes, and 1982's H2O. Kernon was the engineer/mixer on Voices and co-producer/engineer (with the duo) on the other two albums, the sales of which not only revived their careers but made them the most successful chart duo in the history of American pop music. The allmusic review of Private Eyes called it \\"one of their best albums and one of the great mainstream pop albums of the early '80s.\\" and said that \\"the production is state of the art for 1981\\" The allmusic review of H2O said that \\"the production and performances are precise and deliberate\\" but \\"when the productions open up a bit, the band still sounds terrific, but they never are given the opportunity to sound as big and bold as they do on Private Eyes.\\" Selected discography The following are some of the albums that Neil Kernon has produced, recorded, and/or mixed, or played on.

The genus extends from Mexico in the north to Brazil and Bolivia in the south, with two species present in the southeastern Caribbean (Trinidad and the Windward Islands).Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant FamiliesGovaerts, R. & Dransfield, J. (2005). World Checklist of Palms: 1‚Äì223. The Board of Trustees of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Description Desmoncus is best known as a genus of climbing palms. Twenty-three of the 24 species recognised by Andrew Henderson in his revision of the genus are climbers; only one, D. stans is free-standing. Almost all Neotropical climbing palms belong to Desmoncus‚Äîthe one exception being Chamaedorea elatior. Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius's drawing of Desmoncus polyacanthos shows the features of the leaf (sheath, petiole, rachis, leaflets, and cirrus) and the inflorescence with its associated bract. Most Desmoncus species climb using grappling hook-like structures called acanthophylls. Desmoncus leaves are pinnately compound and are made up of a leaf sheath, petioles, rachis, and individual leaflets. The ends of the leaves are modified into a climbing structure called a cirrus. Instead of leaflets, the cirrus usually has grappling hook-like structures called acanthophylls; in some species the cirrus is less well developed and is almost absent in D. stans, the non-climbing species. All parts of the leaves, including the leaflets themselves, are covered with spines. Most species have straight spines that are over long, but a few species have curved spines that are less than 1 cm long.  Taxonomy  John Dransfield and colleagues put Desmoncus in the subfamily Arecoideae, the tribe Cocoseae and the subtribe Bactridinae, together with Aiphanes, Acrocomia, Astrocaryum and Bactris. The genus was described by Carl Friedrich Philipp von Martius in 1824. The first species described was D. polyacanthos. Martius later described six additional species that he placed in the genus. In this 1881 Flora Brasiliensis, Carl Georg Oscar Drude recognised 17 species. Jo√£o Barbosa Rodrigues recognised 28 species in his 1903 work Setum Palmarum Brasiliensis. Max Burret published a revision of the entire genus in 1934. Burret described nine new species and ended up recognising a total of 41 species. In the 1940s, Liberty Hyde Bailey added 14 additional species to the genus Desmoncus. Jan Wessels Boer rejected the species concept used by Bailey, Barbosa Rodrigues, and Burret as being too narrow and ended up recognising only seven species In his 2011 revision of the genus, Andrew Henderson recognised 24 species.  Distribution  Desmoncus ranges from Mexico in the north to Bolivia and Brazil in the south. Most species occur at lower elevations, but some species range as high as above sea level. The species are mostly found in lowland tropical rainforest. Twelve species occur in Colombia, the most species-rich country, while 10 are found in Brazil.

A Democrat, she served as sheriff of Baltimore County, Maryland from 1998 until 2002.  History  Anne Strasdauskas, of Lithuanian descent, was born as a twin sister in Baltimore, Maryland, and was raised in the Baltimore section of Highlandtown. Strasdauskas graduated from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee with a 3.8 GPA with a B.S. in Education (specializing in Physical Education) and a A.A. degree in Health. Strasdauskas was a backup speedskater to the U.S. Olympic Team. She spent several winters in the Netherlands skating with the Dutch national B Team. Strasdauskas first worked for Baltimore County Government with the Baltimore County Jail as a Corrections Officer. She was hired by then Sheriff James E. Malone, Sr. By 1990, Strasdauskas made the move to become a Baltimore County Deputy Sheriff. She graduated from the Baltimore County Police Academy. Strasdauskas was a Deputy Sheriff in the Field Operations Bureau until 1994. Strasdauskas was terminated by then Sheriff Norman M. Pepersack, Jr. in February 1998. Her infraction was not getting a Non-emergency channel programmed on her radio during a vacation trip. Strasdauskas decided to run for Sheriff while filling an appeal, and filed on the deadline July 7, 1998. She ran in the Democratic primary with very little money, no name recognition, and help. Handmade signs, and close friends helped her win the primary. Now she faced her old boss in the 1998 General Election. Strasdauskas was placed on the Democratic Unity Ballot with such names as Dutch Ruppersberger, Ben Cardin, Parris Glendening, and others. She received enough campaign contributions to have professionally made campaign signs made with her slogan, \\"Fair, Firm, Impartial\\". The 1998 General Election proved to be a landslide for the Democrats, and Strasdauskas beat Pepersack by less than 6,500 votes. She also received help from Kathleen Kennedy, the daughter of Robert Kennedy, and now a close personal friend, who she has always given credit to.  The Sheriff  Under her stewardship, the Baltimore County Sheriff's Office attained a 20-year retirement plan, newer office equipment, upgrade in firearms, higher training standards, new security scanners, and after September 11, 2001, a new camera observation system was ordered, and was to be installed the following year. She also kept the budget flat lined with no increases in cost to tax payers.  Electoral defeat  Leading up to the primary election in 2002, Strasdauskas faced only a handful of opponents. Charles Cuddy, a Baltimore County Dispatcher, and R. Jay Fisher, a Lieutenant with the Baltimore Police Department. Strasdauskas lost to Fisher by approximately 12,000 votes.  Aftermath  Strasdauskas went back to work for private security. In 2005, she became a Correctional Officer for the Cecil County Sheriff's Office. Strasdauskas later resigned from the Cecil County Sheriff's Office in late 2011 due to allegations of supplying cellular telephones to prison inmates. She also supported Chris Sutton an opponent of incumbent Sheriff, it is believed that allegations were related to this. On June 18, 2014 Strasdauskas placed a letter to the editor in the Cecil Whig stating her affiliation with and the endorsement of Chris Sutton by Cecil County Correctional Officers Association. It was later stated the association is actually dormant and she is not employed with the correctional institution.

McParland arrived in New York in 1867. He worked as a laborer, policeman and then in Chicago as a liquor store owner until the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed his business. He then became a private detective and labor spy, noted for his success against the Molly Maguires. Infiltration of the Molly Maguires McParland first came to national attention when, as an undercover operative using the name James McKenna, he infiltrated and helped to dismantle an organization of activist Pennsylvania coal miners called the Molly Maguires. During the 1870s, miners in the region of the anthracite mines lived a life of \\"bitter, terrible struggle.\\" Wages were low, working conditions were atrocious, and deaths and serious injuries numbered in the hundreds each year. Conditions were certainly ripe for labor unrest: > Labor angrily watched \\"railway directors (riding) about the country in > luxurious private cars proclaiming their inability to pay living wages to > hungry working men.\\" The Molly Maguires were Irish Catholic when there was frequent prejudice against such persons. It was a time of rampant beatings and murders in mining districts, some committed by the Mollies. Franklin B. Gowen, the President of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, and of the Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, \\"the wealthiest anthracite coal mine owner in the world\\", hired Allan Pinkerton's services to deal with the Molly Maguires. Pinkerton assigned McParland to the job. McParland successfully infiltrated the secret organization, becoming a secretary for one of its local groups. McParland turned in reports daily, eventually collecting evidence of murder plots and intrigue, passing this information along to Benjamin Franklin, his Pinkerton manager. He also began working secretly with Robert Linden, a Pinkerton agent assigned to the Coal and Iron Police for the purpose of coordinating the eventual arrest and prosecution of members of the Molly Maguires. On 10 December 1876, three men and two women with Molly connections were attacked in their house by masked men. One woman in the house, wife of one of the Molly Maguires, was taken outside and shot dead. McParland was outraged that the information he had been providing had found its way into the hands of killers. McParland protested in a letter to his Pinkerton overseer which declared, in part: > Now I wake up this morning to find that I am the murderer of Mrs. McAlister. > What had a woman to do with the case ‚Äì did the [Molly Maguires] in their > worst time shoot down women. If I was not here the Vigilante Committee would > not know who was guilty and when I find them shooting women in their thirst > for blood I hereby tender my resignation to take effect as soon as this > message is received. It is not cowardice that makes me resign but just let > them have it now I will no longer interfere as I see that one is the same as > the other and I am not going to be an accessory to the murder of women and > children. I am sure the [Molly Maguires] will not spare the women so long as > the Vigilante has shown an example. McParland was prevailed upon not to resign. Frank Winrich, a first lieutenant with the Pennsylvania State Militia, was arrested as the leader of the attackers, but was released on bail. Then another Molly Maguire, Hugh McGehan, a 21-year-old who had been secretly identified as a killer by McParland, was fired upon and wounded by unknown assailants. Later, the McGehans' home was attacked by gunfire. Eventually enough evidence was collected on reprisal killings and assassinations that arrests could be made and, based primarily on McParland's testimony, ten Molly Maguires were sent to the gallows. Some writers declare unequivocally that justice was done. Others have argued that, > ... punishment had gone too far, and that the guilt of some of the condemned > was that of association more than participation and but half established by > other condemned men seeking clemency for themselves. Joseph G. Rayback, author of A History of American Labor, has observed: > The charge has been made that the Molly Maguires episode was deliberately > manufactured by the coal operators with the express purpose of destroying > all vestiges of unionism in the area ... There is some evidence to support > the charge ... the \\"crime wave\\" that appeared in the anthracite fields came > after the appearance of the Pinkertons, and ... many of the victims of the > crimes were union leaders and ordinary miners.

The Valley of Fear: McParland \\"meets\\" Holmes Reports of McParland's success against the Molly Maguires came to the attention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes detective novels. Conan Doyle wrote McParland into The Valley of Fear, creating an encounter between the fictional Sherlock Holmes, and a character whose history loosely recalled McParland's experiences with the Molly Maguires. Conan Doyle had met Allan Pinkerton on an ocean voyage, where the writer became fascinated by the \\"singular and terrible narrative\\" of the Molly Maguires. Later, however, \\"Allan Pinkerton's and Arthur Conan Doyle's friendship ended over the rendition of some Pinkerton exploits in fictional form ...\\"The Eye That Never Sleeps, A History of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency by Frank Morn, 1982, p. 176 Patrick Campbell, a relative of one of the executed Mollies, who wrote A Molly Maguire Story, learned from a McParland relative that McParland's two brothers, Edward and Charles, also went undercover against the Mollies. Campbell speculates that the break between Pinkerton and Conan Doyle may have resulted because, > [The McParland character in The Valley of Fear] was portrayed as being very > wealthy [suggesting a possible 'pay off' ... and] Pinkerton did not like the > fact that [the McParland character] was characterized in the novel as having > married a German girl from [the anthracite fields ...] Brother Charles had > actually married the German girl, not James, but Pinkerton must have > disliked how close the novel was getting to the truth. Knights of Labor Railway Strike of 1886 During the Knights of Labor Railway Strike of 1886, McParland worked undercover in Parsons, Kansas for railroad tycoon Jay Gould. McParland was accused of joining in criminal activity with Jacob McLaughlin of the notorious Grand Central Hotel near the railroad yards. Writer Anthony Lukas recorded that: > For years, its staff had preyed on visitors ‚Äì notably Texas cattlemen who, > having driven their herds up the Chisholm Trail to Abilene returned through > Parsons with bulging pockets. The hotel provided everything the footloose > cowboy or railway man might require: liquor, drugs, gambling, and > prostitutes. But once a man had savored those delights, he was likely to > find his pockets picked, his horse stolen. If a guest proved recalcitrant, > he was chloroformed, butchered, then buried in the basement or thrown in the > Neosho River. McLaughlin and an associate, Wash Bercaw, spent time in the county jail for liquor violations. They reportedly murdered a cellmate by the name of Frank P. Myers (or Myres), a horse thief who had overheard them in the jail, by drowning him in the river. The two were charged with the murder just as troopers brought the strike under control. But the witnesses to the murder changed their stories, apparently due to behind-the-scenes operations by McParland. The witnesses admitted they had been bribed, and went to jail for perjury. E.C. Ward, McLauglin's lawyer, who had offered the bribes, was disbarred. McLaughlin walked free, and many in the community ‚Äì judges, lawyers, and merchants ‚Äì apparently shared the view that the perjured testimony was somehow McParland's doing. A meeting chaired by a local Socialist denounced the \\"infamous\\" detective. A statement was issued stating that when money could be made, > ... he will do anything, no matter how low or vile, to accomplish his > purpose ... There is not today, in the United States outside prison walls, a > more conscienceless and desperate criminal than McParland. Lukas wrote: \\"What lay behind these accusations is difficult to say,\\" and that it is \\"hard to imagine\\" how McParland became associated with \\"a scoundrel like McLaughlin,\\" but \\"if the story is accurate,\\" he speculated that the connection must have resulted from activities relating to the strike. Historian and McParland biographer Beau Riffenburgh wrote that McParland's supposed connection with McLaughlin was the invention of sensational journalist George Shoaf and two colleagues at the Kansas socialist publication Appeal to Reason. Shoaf hated McParland passionately for working undercover in the employ of rich capitalists, and launched an \\"all-out smear campaign\\" connecting McParland with McLaughlin. Riffenburgh noted that following McLaughlin's trial, two witnesses were convicted of perjury and McLaughlin's lawyer was disbarred, but the report of the three-member commission appointed by the court to investigate the perjury contained no mention of McParland. Riffenburgh concluded: > In a series of outrageous yarns, Shoaf created a story of McParland's > involvement at McLaughlin's Grand Central Hotel including cleverly expanding > their supposed relationship to include more illegal and immoral activities > by McParland. Unfortunately, even though there is no indication of truth in > Shoaf's stories, they have occasionally been accepted as accurate.Beau > Riffenburgh, Pinkerton's Great Detective (New York: Penguin, 2013) 174-177. More than two decades later, McParland would be interrogated about his time in Parsons while under cross-examination by attorney Edmund Richardson. This occurred during the first of three murder trials of Steve Adams, this one taking place in Wallace, Idaho. Immediately after the questioning, the attorney and the detective had a verbal confrontation in the courtroom. An Associated Press writer wrote that spectators cheered the attorney, and hissed McParland. The detective later argued that the newspaper reporter must have been bribed to write such a story. Criminal detection In Columbus, Kansas, McParland discovered a conspiracy to dynamite Cherokee County's records vault to hide fraudulent mortgages. McParland helped convict train robber Oliver Curtis Perry. He helped to apprehend a criminal who committed the largest bullion theft in U.S. history ‚Äì $320,000 in gold from a San Francisco smelting company. McParland in Colorado In 1885, the Thiel Detective Agency opened an office in Denver. Allan Pinkerton, who had died two years earlier, left the Pinkerton Detective Agency to his sons. The brothers opened their fourth office in Denver in order to compete with Thiel. They assigned Charles O. Eames to head the Denver office. When it appeared that Eames was running the western branch dishonestly, they assigned McParland to investigate. McParland discovered extensive abuses against clients and against the agency, and reported on them. Everyone was fired except for McParland and Charlie Siringo. McParland was named superintendent of Pinkerton's Denver office, and of the Pinkerton's western division. In April 1891, Mrs. Josephine Barnaby was murdered by poison. McParland tricked Thomas Thatcher Graves, her accused murderer, into traveling from Providence, Rhode Island, to Denver where he was arrested and convicted of the crime. McParland hired gunman Tom Horn (later executed for murder in Wyoming), who, while working for Pinkerton killed seventeen men, according to a count by Siringo. While Horn had been working for Wyoming cattlemen, \\"it was the cattle interests who decreed that he must die\\", probably to keep him from talking. One of McParland's tasks was infiltrating and disrupting union activities. He successfully placed numerous spies within the Western Federation of Miners (WFM) union, and more into the United Mine Workers. Some of McParland's agents took part in the WFM strike that came to be called the Colorado Labor Wars. One in particular was charged with sabotaging the union's relief program during the strike. Bill Haywood, Secretary Treasurer of the WFM, wrote about the sabotage in his autobiography: > I had been having some difficulty with the relief committee of the Denver > smelter men. At first we had been giving out relief at such a rate that I > had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more > than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the > wives of the smelter men began to complain that they were not getting enough > to eat. Years later, when his letters were published in The Pinkerton Labor > Spy, I discovered that the chairman of the relief committe [sic] was a > Pinkerton detective, who was carrying out the instructions of the agency in > his methods of handling the relief work, deliberately trying to stir up bad > feeling between the strikers and the relief committee. The Steunenberg assassination In 1899, Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg crushed a rebellion of miners during a labor dispute in Coeur d'Alene. On December 30, 1905, Steunenberg, five years out of office, opened the side gate of the picket fence at his house in Caldwell, which set off an explosive device that took his life. A man using the name Tom Hogan had set the bomb; he was born Albert Horsley but best known as Harry Orchard. The killer left evidence in his hotel room, and did not try to flee. James McParland, from the 1907 book The Confessions and Autobiography of Harry Orchard After the assassination, Idaho's Chief Justice Stockslager drafted a telegram which invited the Pinkerton Agency to investigate. Idaho Governor Frank Gooding was persuaded to approve the request, and Pinkerton agent McParland soon arrived to lead the investigation. McParland announced his suspicion that Orchard was \\"the tool of others.\\"Famous American Trials, Biographies of Key Figures in the Haywood Trial, James McParland Biography ; retrieved February 22, 2007. McParland frequently used the expression inner circle to describe a secret cabal in the Western Federation of Miners when pitching Pinkerton's services to mine owners. McParland's stenographer, Morris Friedman, observed that by portraying the WFM in this manner, the Pinkerton office in Denver had generated \\"as much, and at times even more business than five other offices of the Agency combined.\\" McParland had Orchard transferred from the Caldwell, Idaho jail to death row in the Boise penitentiary. The move was initially resisted by Judge Smith, who would be responsible for trying the case. The local judge anticipated a successful habeas corpus lawsuit against the tactic. McParland gave him \\"thirty precedents for the move.\\" However, the sheriff in Caldwell reportedly opposed the move as well. Gooding arranged a meeting between McParland and Chief Justice Stockslager, and then with Judge Smith. Before Smith arrived, McParland declared the county jail insecure, a potential target for dynamite. He also stated the purpose of the move to death row: \\"After three days I will attempt to get a confession.\\" Chief Justice Stockslager approved of the move. In a pre-arranged plan, the Governor was called out of the room as soon as Judge Smith arrived, leaving McParland and the two judges alone. With the Chief Justice supporting the move to death row, Judge Smith also agreed. On death row, Orchard was placed under a constant watch, and his food rations were cut. He was incarcerated next to two death row inmates who were awaiting execution themselves. Relays of guards watched him night and day, but never spoke to him. The three-day wait turned into nine days. On January 22, the hungry prisoner was escorted into the warden's office and left alone with McParland. The two enjoyed a lavish meal followed by fine cigars. McParland threatened Orchard with immediate hanging, and said that he could avoid that fate only if he testified against leaders of the WFM. McParland allayed Orchard's skepticism by telling him about \\"Kelly the Bum\\", a confessed murderer who became a prosecution witness in the Molly Maguires cases. McParland claimed \\"Kelly\\" not only had received freedom as part of the deal, but he had been given \\"one thousand dollars to subsidize a new life abroad\\". McParland dismissed the possibility that Orchard would face charges in Colorado if allowed to go free in Idaho. McParland had offered a stark choice: an immediate visit to the gallows, or better treatment for the prisoner with the possibility of freedom, a possible financial reward, and the gratitude of the state of Idaho. Orchard was known to Charles Moyer, having once acted as his body guard on a trip from Denver to Telluride. Orchard had also met Bill Haywood. In 1899 Orchard was at the scene of the labor unrest in Coeur d'Alene when Steunenberg had severely punished the union miners for an act of violence. He chose to cooperate. Orchard was transferred from death row to a private bungalow in the prison yard. He was provided with special meals, new clothing, spending money, his favorite cigars, and a library of religious tracts. The current governor of Idaho stopped by to shake his hand and congratulate him on cooperating. McParland had Western Federation of Miners leaders Bill Haywood, Charles Moyer, and George Pettibone arrested in Colorado. In his book Roughneck, writer Peter Carlson wrote that the extradition papers falsely claimed that the three men had been present at Steunenberg's murder. Carlson described the arrest across state lines as a \\"kidnapping scheme.\\" However, under Idaho law, conspirators were considered to be present at the scene of the crime.\\"This fabric under which we have lived\\" (editorial), American Bar Association Journal, May 1968, v.54 p.473. The extradition was done with the cooperation and involvement of the Colorado authorities, and was later upheld by the US Supreme Court, with one dissent. The Steunenberg trials McParland rounded up potential witnesses, assembled evidence, checked out potential jurors, and \\"leaked information that would tarnish the reputations of the defendants and their attorneys.\\"Famous American Trials, Biographies of Key Figures in the Haywood Trial, James McParland Biography. McParland placed a spy, \\"Operative 21\\", on the defense team. The spy operated as a jury canvasser, and may have been instructed to provide the defense with erroneous reports of the preferences of potential jurors. However, the spy was discovered.Famous American Trials, Biographies of Key Figures in the Haywood Trial, The Trial of William \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood by Douglas O. Linder ; retrieved 22 February 2007. McParland sought to bolster Orchard's testimony by forcing another WFM miner, Steve Adams, to turn state's evidence. McParland used the same method for eliciting a confession from Adams as he had on Orchard: he told Adams he was merely a \\"tool,\\" and told him he \\"would be forgiven his sins,\\" if he confessed. With his wife and children also confined in the Idaho prison, allegedly for their own protection, Adams signed a confession, then later recanted. McParland sought leverage over Adams to force him to re-affirm the confession. Charges against Adams for several murders resulted in two hung juries and one acquittal. As a result of Adams' first trial, in which he was defended by attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edmund F. Richardson, details of McParland's coercive treatment of witnesses when seeking a confession were revealed on the witness stand. McParland had contracted to provide Pinkerton services for Bulkeley Wells, the president and manager of the Smuggler-Union Mining Company in Telluride, Colorado. Together with Wells and others, McParland planned to have Adams charged with involvement after-the-fact in the murder of mine bricklayer William J. Barney, who had disappeared one week after accepting the position as a guard at the Smuggler-Union mine. There was one difficulty with the accusation: William J. Barney hadn't been murdered; in fact, he was very much alive. McParland tried to turn conspiracy defendant Moyer against co-defendants Haywood and Pettibone by having a sheriff claim Pettibone, Adams, and Orchard were plotting to kill Moyer, but that plan wasn't put into action. A slightly different scheme was tried to split the trio, but Moyer didn't take the bait. At the Haywood trial, which was funded, in part, by direct contributions from the Ceour d'Alene District Mine Owners' Association to prosecuting attorneys, the only evidence against the WFM leader was Harry Orchard's testimony. Orchard confessed to acting as a paid informant for the Mine Owners' Association He reportedly told a companion, G.L. Brokaw, that he had been a Pinkerton employee for some time.All That Glitters ‚Äì Class, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek by Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, p. 228; from Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, p. 98. and a bigamist. He admitted to abandoning wives in Canada and Cripple Creek. He had burned businesses for the insurance money in Cripple Creek and Canada. Orchard had burglarized a railroad depot, rifled a cash register, stolen sheep, and had made plans to kidnap children over a debt. He also sold fraudulent insurance policies. To satisfy McParland, Orchard had signed a confession to a series of bombings and shootings which had killed at least seventeen men, all of which he blamed on the Western Federation of Miners. The original confession was never made public. but a more comprehensive version released in 1907 included many pages of incriminating allegations.The confessions and autobiography of Harry Orchard by Albert Horsley A.K.A. Harry Orchard, McClure, New York: 1907. Although at first his testimony on the witness stand in the Bill Haywood trial seemed plausible, the defense pointed out some significant contradictions. Orchard claimed his instructions came from Haywood and Moyer, but the authors of The Pinkerton Story observe: The defense called two surprise witnesses ‚Äì Morris Friedman, McParland's private stenographer until 1905, who testified about Pinkerton's practices of infiltration and sabotage of the WFM; and McParland's brother, Edward, who had been a shoemaker in the Cripple Creek District during the Colorado Labor Wars. Edward testified that he had been working at his cobbler's bench in Victor when national guardsmen: The appearance of his brother Edward was intended \\"simply to embarrass\\" the detective, for it recounted \\"the imperial style of the Peabody administration in Colorado, with which McParland and the Pinkertons had been closely associated.\\" The majority of jurors in the Haywood trial found Orchard not to be a credible witness, and Haywood was acquitted. In a separate trial for George Pettibone, the defense team declined to argue the case, resting upon a not guilty plea. Pettibone was also acquitted. Charges against Moyer were dropped. After the cases against the WFM leaders failed, Orchard was tried alone for Steunenberg's murder, was found guilty, and was sentenced to death. However, the sentence was commuted to life, and he lived out the rest of his life in his prison bungalow. Competitive practices McParland was a rival to Wilson S. Swain, northwestern manager of the Thiel Detective Agency. During the Stuenenberg investigation, Swain set up shop in Caldwell, Idaho, intimating to county authorities and to the governor that he'd been hired by the mine owners to investigate the crime. When he later presented his bill to the Canyon County Commissioners, they felt that they had been conned. Meanwhile, McParland was interviewed for the investigation by the governor. McParland sought to further undermine the competition: > [McParland] never lost an opportunity to remind [Idaho Governor] Gooding > that Swain had committed a \\"cold-blooded murder\\" on Denver's Larimer Street > twenty years before. More often he worked surreptitiously, passing stories > he knew would be repeated, impugning Swain's investigative skills, > ridiculing his minions, suggesting [Swain] was in league with the [Western > Federation of Miners].

Early life Born in Rotherhithe, Surrey, England, Smith was the fifth of seven sons of wealthy ship owner William Howard Smith and his second wife Agnes. One brother, Edmund (1847‚Äì1914), would serve in the Victorian Legislative Council from 1901 to 1903. The family immigrated to Melbourne in 1854 where Smith was educated at Wesley College and studied law at the University of Melbourne before leaving for England where he was called to the Bar in 1877. Colonial politics Returning to Melbourne the next year, Smith was admitted to the Victorian Bar and on 15 January 1879, married Sara Jane Creswell, who bore him four sons and three daughters. Developing an interest in politics, Smith unsuccessfully stood for the Victorian electoral district of Emerald Hill in February 1880, before moving to Sydney in 1881, where he won a Legislative Assembly by-election for Gundagai in 1882. Resigning from parliament in April 1884, Smith returned to Melbourne to run his father's business, WM Howard Smith and Sons Ltd. In March 1885 Smith founded the Victorian Employers' Union, serving as its inaugural president until 1887, and the Victorian Board of Conciliation. Union leaders favourably commented upon his willingness to work with unions to achieve consensus, an attitude missing in fellow employers. In 1887, Smith published Liberty and Liberalism, a defence of classical Adam Smith liberalism in politics and economics and an attack against what he considered the increasing interference by the state. Additionally, Smith later wrote books on the Constitution of Australia, the dangers of socialism and a volume of verse. After an argument with his father in December 1887, Smith sold all his shares in Howard Smith to his brother Edmund Smith and resigned from the board. Disinherited by his father, Smith returned to Sydney to continue his career as a barrister and founded the New South Wales Employers' Union. Elected as the member for Glebe in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in February 1889, Smith was almost immediately promoted by Premier Henry Parkes to Secretary for Public Works, and later, Treasurer. Smith proved to be a hard working minister but abrasive figure, frequently clashing with Parkes and accused of threatening to \\"shoot down\\" striking maritime workers \\"like bloody dogs\\". He did not seek re-election at the 1894 election. In 1898 Smith unsuccessfully contested Glebe for the National Federal Party and served as a member of the party's Federal Executive finance committee and as editor of their newspaper United Australia from 1900 to 1902. Federal politics Smith c. 1903 Following the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901, Smith successfully contested the newly created federal Division of Parkes at the inaugural Australian federal election as a Free Trade Party representative. He campaigned strongly against the idea of restricting non-white immigration, believing it to be racial discrimination; in doing so, Smith was the only candidate to oppose all of what would become the White Australia Policy (Andrew Fisher argued that any Kanaka who had converted to Christianity and married should be allowed to remain in Australia). In parliament, Smith often clashed with his Free Trade colleagues, particularly party leader George Reid, over his refusal to toe the party line. Despite opposing tariffs, social welfare provisions and \\"meddling legislation\\", Smith was a strong supporter of the women's movement and was known as parliament's preeminent political economist and one of its finest debaters. While a member of parliament, Smith continued to act as a barrister and was made a King's Counsel in 1904. Additionally, he served on numerous commercial boards, including as a director of the Colonial Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd, and held senior positions with community organisations such as New South Wales president of the British Empire League in Australia and state president of the Association for the Protection of Native Races. Smith lost Nationalist preselection at the 1919 election and was defeated as an independent candidate, having spent almost all his period in federal parliament in opposition. He was offered the role of Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives twice but declined in order to concentrate on other matters. Physically, the urbane Smith was a distinctive looking man; tall, stout, double-chinned and the owner of a fine example of a waxed moustache. Post-political life Smith c. 1910 In 1925 he retired to Bowral, New South Wales, where he died in 1937. Survived by two daughters and a son, Smith was buried beside his wife in the Bowral Church of England cemetery. Smith was considered an anachronism by the end of his political career but his stature has been revived in recent years, thanks in part to the recent republishing of Liberty and Liberalism. Prominent historian Keith Windschuttle refers to Smith as \\"one of the outstanding intellectuals of Australian history\\", adding \\"were anyone to write a proper history of ideas in Australia, Smith should figure prominently\\". According to Geoffrey Bolton, Smith was once \\"dismissed as a spokesman for employers who wanted to introduce cheap non-European labour into White Australia\\", but by the late 20th century had been rehabilitated as \\"a tolerant multiculturalist ahead of his time\\".

It was also considered an important component for the Vision 2020 plan and Malaysia's future as a knowledge economy. It was originally intended to be situated in Dengkil three research institutions are planned for the first phase, the National Institute for Genomics and Molecular Biology, the National Institute for Pharmaceutical and Neutraceutical Biotechnology and National Institute for Agro-Biotechnology . Its location would put it within the Multimedia Super Corridor and in close proximity and to the south of the IT hub of Cyberjaya and the administrative capital of Putrajaya. It would also therefore be within reasonable proximity to the capital of Kuala Lumpur. It was first proposed under the Eighth Malaysia Plan, however its development was largely kept under wraps . This was widely report to be because the government wished to avoid a repeat of the perceived failure to meet the lofty goals announced as part of the Multimedia Super Corridor. The project was launched with limited fanfare on 20 May 2003 by the then Prime Minister of Malaysia Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad. Compared to the launch of the Multimedia Super Corridor reporting of the launch and plans in the government backed media was notably less extensive. Its current status is uncertain. Earlier reporting indicated it would be ready by 2006 and complete by 2009 but there has been a notable lack of information about its progress. In 2005, it was reported by the journal Nature as a failed project . According to other sources, the latest roadmap is that BioValley will be developed from the existing centres of excellence rather than centred in Dengkil. The National Institute for Pharmaceutical and Neutraceutical Biotechnology will still be in located in Dengkil albeit with strong links to the Universiti Sains Malaysia. Under the Ninth Malaysia Plan RM2 billion was allocated for biotechnology (physical and soft infrastructures). A further RM2.3 billion was allocated for setting up a National Institute of Cancer, a National Forensic Institute and a National Institute for Oral Health although the location of these institutes is uncertain.

Best known for his Sevilla and Real Madrid spells, Buyo appeared in 542 La Liga matches, third all-time highest at the time of his retirement, winning 12 major titles with the latter club. For about one decade, Buyo was a backup on the Spain national team to two European Championships. Club career Buyo was born in Betanzos, A Coru√±a. At the age of fourteen he began playing football for local Ural CF, for which he appeared as both a goalkeeper and right winger during his one-year spell, achieving the feat of being both unbeaten between the goalposts and also the team's top goalscorer.Real Madrid fans biography (in Spanish) Buyo's first professional club was RCD Mallorca, in the second division. After one season he joined Deportivo de La Coru√±a, where he would stay until 1980, with a loan to SD Huesca ‚Äì while he performed military service in Jaca ‚Äì in between. He made his debuts in La Liga in the 1980‚Äì81 season with Sevilla FC, being the starting goalkeeper from the beginning; he played there six years, appearing in 242 official matches and winning his debut Spain national football team callup. Buyo's performance at Sevilla made Real Madrid require his services, signing him in 1986 as a replacement for an ageing Miguel √Ångel. In his first season he appeared in all 44 league games (the campaign featured a second stage), the first being a 3‚Äì1 win over Real Murcia, being instrumental to the Merengues' national title; he would remain in the capital club until his retirement in 1997, aged 39. The local success Buyo met with Madrid (six leagues and two Copa del Rey) could not be translated into international accolades, as they kept being eliminated in European Cup competition. However, in his first season, he did have a memorable performance against Michel Platini's Juventus F.C. in the round-of-16 of the 1986‚Äì87 edition: after the Spaniards won 1‚Äì0 in the first leg and the Italians did the same in the second meeting, the winner was decided in a penalty shootout, won by the former after he saved two of the opposition's shots;1‚Äì0: Del infierno a la gloria (1‚Äì0: From hell to glory); Mundo Deportivo, 6 November 1986 (in Spanish) he earned his first Ricardo Zamora Trophy during his second league campaign after conceding only 23 goals in 35 league contests, and his second came in 1991‚Äì92 during which he played as many matches, with 27 goals against. Madrid would win two more league titles with Buyo in goal, the first of which came in the 1994‚Äì95 season, during which he also had a streak of 709 minutes without conceding a goal in league play, between 3 December 1994 and 12 February 1995,\\"The world's top division goalkeepers of all time with the longest time without conceding a goal\\"; at International Federation of Football History & Statistics the fifth- longest streak ever in the Spanish league.

She debuted with the Chicago Symphony at age 10, and was the first American and youngest ever gold medal winner of the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition. The Washington Post wrote that she \\"displays a power and confidence that puts her in the top echelon.\\" Pine tours worldwide as a soloist with prestigious orchestras, has an active recording career, and has run The Rachel Barton Pine Foundation since 2001 which provides services and funding to promote classical music education and performances. Early life Pine was born in Chicago, and began playing the violin at age 3 after being inspired by the example of older girls playing at her church. She debuted with the Chicago String Ensemble at age 7, and with the Chicago Symphony under the baton of Erich Leinsdorf at age 10. Her passion for violin compelled her to practice 4 or 5 hours a day as a second grader, prompting her elementary school principal to encourage her parents to begin home schooling, which allowed her to focus on her music, practicing 8 hours a day. Her principal teachers were Roland and Almita Vamos of the Music Institute of Chicago. At age 14, she began taking paid gigs playing at weddings and in orchestras, which allowed her to contribute significantly to her family's income as they experienced financial difficulties. Explaining how she managed, she says, \\"I put on a lot of makeup and pretended I was older than I was.\\" She attained notable success in a number of violin competitions, including winning the 1992 Johann Sebastian Bach International Competition in Leipzig, Germany. She also earned 2nd prizes in the J√≥zsef Szigeti Violin Competition (1992) and the International Fritz Kreisler Competition (1992), as well as awards from the Montreal International Musical Competition (1991), the Paganini Competition (1993), and the Queen Elisabeth Music Competition (1993). Career Pine has appeared as a soloist with orchestras around the world including the Chicago, Montreal, Atlanta, Budapest, San Diego, Baltimore, St. Louis, Vienna, New Zealand, Iceland and Dallas symphonies; the Buffalo, Rochester, Royal, Calgary, Russian and New Mexico philharmonics, the Philadelphia, Louisville, Royal Scottish and Belgian National orchestras; the Mozarteum, Scottish and Israel chamber orchestras, and the Netherlands Radio Chamber Philharmonic. She has performed under conductors such as Charles Dutoit, John Nelson, Zubin Mehta, Erich Leinsdorf, Neeme J√§rvi, Marin Alsop, Semyon Bychkov, Pl√°cido Domingo, and Jos√© Serebrier, and with artists including Daniel Barenboim, Christoph Eschenbach, Christopher O'Reilly, Mark O'Connor, and William Warfield. Her festival appearances include Marlboro, Ravinia, Montreal, Wolf Trap, Vail, Davos, and Salzburg's Mozartwoche at the invitation of Franz Welser-M√∂st. Her premieres of pieces by living composers include ‚ÄúRush‚Äù for solo violin by Augusta Read Thomas, Mohammed Fairouz's ‚ÄúNative Informant‚Äù Sonata for Solo Violin and ‚ÄúAl-Andalus‚Äù Violin Concerto, and the Panamanian premiere of Panamanian composer Roque Cordero's 1962 Violin Concerto. In April, 2017, Pine performed solo violin with the Phoenix Symphony under the baton of Tito Munoz debuting the Violin Concerto, \\"Dependent Arising\\" by Earl Maneein (b. 1976). Her \\"American Partitas\\" is a recital program of suites of dance movements composed for Pine by Bruce Molsky, Darol Anger, Billy Childs, and Daniel Bernard Roumain written in response to the Bach Partitas for solo violin paired with their Bach counterparts. In addition to her mixed recital programs, Pine has regularly given single evening performances of the six Bach Sonatas and Partitas, the 24 Paganini Caprices, and the complete Brahms Sonatas. In 2015, Pine released her debut Avie Records recording Mozart: Complete Violin Concertos with one of her ‚Äúmusical heroes‚Äù conductor Sir Neville Marriner and The Academy of St Martin in the Fields. Pine grew up listening to Sir Neville and The Academy of St Martin in the Fields‚Äô recordings and their performance on the Amadeus movie soundtrack. Studying Mozart's operas she gained an appreciation for the drama, playfulness and flirtation of his violin concertos featured on the new album. The recording also contains Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, recorded with violist Matthew Lipman, a 2015 Avery Fisher Career Grant recipient. Pine started exploring esteemed violin concertos and the concertos that inspired them with Brahms and Joachim Violin Concertos, recorded with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and conductor Carlos Kalmar in 2002. Her 2008 Beethoven & Clement Violin Concertos, recorded with The Royal Philharmonic and conducted by Serebrier, offered the world premiere recording of Clement's D Major Violin Concerto. Her 2013 recording with pianist Matthew Hagle, Violin Lullabies, debuted at number one on the Billboard classical chart. Pine's recording of Violin Concertos by Black Composers of the 18th and 19th Centuries was nominated for a National Public Radio Heritage Award. Carl Fischer Music recently published a sheet music book of cadenzas and virtuosic encore pieces composed by Pine, as well as her arrangements of other works for violin and piano, as part of its Masters Collection. Pine became the first living composer and first woman to be so honored. Pine has also edited a 4-volume collection of compositions associated with America's pioneering female solo violinist Maud Powell, many of which she has also recorded. In 2014. Pine helped to accept a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award on behalf of Maud Powell, after successfully campaigning the Recording Academy for honor. Her musical interests extend well beyond classical to baroque, folk, Celtic, rock, and jazz. She regularly instructs at Mark O'Connor's annual summer fiddle camp, and in 2004 she released a CD in collaboration with Scottish fiddler Alasdair Fraser. Pine performs chamber music as part of Trio Settecento with David Schrader and John Mark Rozendaal, and with the Jupiter Chamber Players. In 2015, Trio Settecento released Veracini's Complete Sonate Accademiche for Violin and Continuo. The Trio's Grand Tour collection of four CDs on Cedille Records takes listeners on a country-by-country of the European Baroque. Her current principal instrument is the 1742 'ex-Bazzini, Soldat' violin of Guarneri del Gesu. For seventeenth- and eighteenth-century pieces, she has often used an unaltered 1770 instrument of Nicol√≤ Gagliano I. Her taste in rock runs to heavy metal, with AC/DC, Anthrax, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Megadeth, Metallica, Mot√∂rhead, Pantera, Slayer, and Van Halen being among her favorites. She has met and played with a number of these. In 1997, she released a heavy-metal-inspired recordings. ‚ÄúIn practicing and preparing those songs, I discovered that a lot of the heavy metal I‚Äôd been listening to was some of the most sophisticated compositionally of all rock music, and very inspired by classical music,‚Äù Pine has said, ‚ÄúThen all these people in ripped jeans started coming to my concerts.‚Äù In February 2009, she joined the thrash/doom metal band Earthen Grave, where she performs on a 6-string Viper electric violin. The band has shared the stage with metal bands such as Pentagram, Black Label Society, Mayhem, and Nachtmystium. The group released an EP, Dismal Times. Doommantia.com proclaimed that Earthen Grave has \\"all the songwriting capabilities to make one of the best albums ever.\\" and HellrideMusic.com said \\"If the doom gods are with us, this band will stay around and continue to produce the kind of unique, powerful and thoughtful music contained on Dismal Times.\\" Pine credits her experience playing in a rock band with improving her emotional rapport with her audiences. Pine often brings a new twist to her coaching sessions with chamber music and youth orchestras, by incorporating orchestral versions of rock pieces into her sessions. For example, Pine offered the world premiere of her own arrangement of Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" with the McHenry County Youth Symphony (Crystal Lake, IL) in November 2009. In May 2015 she premiered her ‚ÄúShredding with the Symphony‚Äù program with the Lafayette Symphony, which features music from Shostakovich, Bruch, Beethoven, Vivaldi, Sibelius, and Paganini as well as Van Halen, AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Rush, Nirvana, Metallica and Led Zeppelin. Bill McGlaughlin called her a \\"musical Pac-Man\\" for her ability to take in and perform so many different kinds of music. She has often performed at schools and on rock music radio stations in an effort to interest younger audiences in classical music. Pine was inducted as an honorary member of Sigma Alpha Iota in 2003. She performed at the music fraternity's 45th national convention during summer 2009 in Chicago. On July 11, 2010, Pine gave a three-part performance at Chicago's Millennium Park as part of the Great Performers of Illinois celebration. After initially performing on baroque violin with Trio Settecento, she soloed in the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with the Illinois Symphony Orchestra and then switched gears again to perform in black leather on her electric violin with Earthen Grave. In conjunction with the event, she received the 2010 Great Performer of Illinois award. In 2010, Pine participated in a tribute album titled Mister Bolin's Late Night Revival, a compilation of 17 previously unreleased tracks written by guitar legend Tommy Bolin prior to his death in 1976. The CD includes other artists such as HiFi Superstar, Doogie White, Eric Martin, Troy Luccketta, Jeff Pilson, Randy Jackson, Rex Carroll, Derek St. Holmes, Kimberley Dahme, and The 77's. A percentage of the proceeds from this project will benefit the Jackson Recovery Centers. Rachel Barton Pine Foundation Pine started a foundation in 2001 to promote the study and appreciation of classical music, including string music by black composers. It prepares music curricula on black composers, loans high-quality instruments to deserving young musicians, and provides grants to cover incidental expenses (such as for supplemental lessons, accompanists, sheet music, travel, competition entrance fees, instrument repair, and audition recordings) of students and young professional musicians. Another program, Global HeartStrings, is dedicated to supporting aspiring classical musicians from developing countries. In this effort, Barton Pine has been aided by a younger sister, Hannah Barton, also a violinist. In 2006, after being nominated by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, Barton Pine received the Studs Terkel Humanities Service Award for her work through the foundation. She has also been given the 2012 Karl Haas Prize for Music Education for this work and her other education-related efforts. A Stradivarius violin, the 'Arkwright Lady Rebecca Sylvan', was donated to the foundation by Joseph Sylvan in 2015. Metra accident On January 16, 1995, Pine was severely injured in a train accident in the suburb of Winnetka, where she taught violin lessons. As she was exiting a Metra commuter train with her violin over her shoulder, the doors closed on the strap to her case, pinning her left shoulder to the train. The doors, which were controlled remotely and had no safety sensors, failed to reopen, and she was dragged by the train before being pulled underneath and run over, severing one leg and mangling the other. Pine was saved by the prompt application of tourniquets by several passengers who disembarked from the train after pulling its emergency brake handles. She sued Metra and the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company for compensation for her injuries and legal and medical expenses. Metra argued that she made the choice not to extricate her arm from the strap of the violin case due to the value of the instrument, a 400-year-old Amati valued at around $500,000, and thus she carried most of the blame for her injuries. The jury ruled in Pine's favor. Metra changed its conductor safety procedures following the incident and made other changes to the trains themselves. 159px Daniel Barenboim, the conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, organized a benefit concert and raised over $75,000 after she was injured. After a two- year hiatus to allow for recovery from her injuries, aided by numerous surgeries and physical therapy, Pine resumed her career. Personal life In 2004, Barton married Greg Pine, a health care consulting firm CEO and former minor league baseball pitcher. They have one daughter.

Sippy cups, as opposed to an open cup, have a top which prevents spills, and the child drinks either through a spout or straw. Some sippy cups work by way of surface tension that prevents liquid from being spilled even when the cup is upended, and others have valves.

Some Jews fled the town in 1939, but the Jewish population increased when the Germans resettled hundreds from nearby towns in Zel√≥w. The ghetto population rose to more than 6000 by early 1941. During this early stage of the war, local ethnic Germans were often brutal to the Jews, but some Poles and local Czechs were more sympathetic, even providing some food. Similarly, the German wholesale company Karl Lieb provided food vouchers to the local Jewish population. In what must be a unique occurrence, two Jewish boys played on the Hitler Youth football team, a fact that brought an angry protest from one of their opponents. In spring 1942, ten Jews were publicly hanged with the Jewish population forced to watch. In June, some Jews were sent to the Che≈Çmno extermination camp, where they were immediately gassed.

From an early period, Bennion labeled Ridge Vineyards wines by vineyard, district and appellation, a first for California Zinfandel and a practice later followed by nearly every winery in the state. Ridge's flagship wine, Monte Bello is considered one of the great wines of the world.  Early life  Bennion was born in Utah, on his family's farm on February 12, 1929. In the late 1940s he moved to California, where he enrolled at Stanford University. While at Stanford, he met Frances Lusk, whom he married in 1953. Career at SRI Bennion started his career at Stanford Research Institute (SRI) where he specialized in Magnetic Circuits. He was instrumental in designing the circuitry for Shakey the Robot, which has the distinction of being the first robot to reason about its own actions. Founding of Ridge Vineyards In 1959, Bennion, Hewitt Crane, Charles Rosen and Howard Zeidler purchased an 80 acre winery and vineyard above Cupertino in the Santa Cruz Mountains. That same year, he produced his very first wine, a Cabernet Sauvignon from the vineyard. Excited by the quality of the early wines, the partners decided to re-bond the winery in time for the 1962 vintage, calling their endeavor Ridge Vineyards. left In 1964, he produced the first Ridge Zinfandel, from a small nineteenth-century vineyard on the nearby Picchetti ranch. This was followed in 1966 by the first Geyserville Zinfandel. By focusing on single-vineyard Zinfandels‚ÄîSonoma, Santa Cruz, Lodi, Paso Robles‚ÄîBennion showed that Zinfandel can express terroir. He would go on to make single-vineyard wines from many other varieties including: Chardonnay, Ruby Cabernet, Riesling and Cabernet Franc. Bennion hired a San Francisco artist to design a unique label for his wines. It featured the use of Optima font and featured specifics that were nearly unheard of in California winemaking, such as the vineyard, grape composition, and exact alcohol by volume of the finished wine. Each bottling featured winemaking notes, detailing the weather, harvest conditions and bottling date. His winemaking style championed minimal intervention. A major component of this philosophy was to make use of the natural yeasts on the grapes. To this end, only a small amount of Sulfur Dioxide would be used during the winemaking process. This would only kill off the unwanted wild yeasts but allow the wine yeasts to survive on the grapes. For the fermentation process, Bennion used a system of wooden lattices to keep the cap submerged in the must. This technique, which was used widely in France and elsewhere in Europe in the 19th century, proved extremely successful and would later be adopted by many California wineries. In 1967, Dave Bennion left SRI completely, to become the first president and winemaker of Ridge. Bennion served as winemaker at Ridge until 1969, when he hired Paul Draper to oversee winemaking operations. After hiring Draper, Bennion continued to serve as the President of Ridge until 1984. Ridge Founders, Sue and Hew Crane (Left), Blanche and Charles Rosen (center) and Frances Bennion (Right) Legacy A plaque honoring David Bennion at Ridge Vineyards On March 28, 1988 Bennion was killed in an automobile accident on the Golden Gate Bridge. After his death, a Trust Fund and Fellowship at UC Davis was created to continue his viticulture work and preserve the history of winemaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains. In 1976, the 1971 Ridge Monte Bello placed fifth in the Judgement of Paris. On May 24, 2006, a 30-year re-enactment of the Judgment of Paris was held with simultaneous tastings in London and in Napa.

Publication history Published in 1978, 1979, 1981, and 1987 and edited by Jay Kinney (#1-3) and Paul Mavrides (#4), each issue of Anarchy Comics was created by an international cast of anarchist or sympathetic contributors. Each anthology included a mixture of fiction, history, commentary, and artwork, with wide ranges in style and format. Contributors Each issue of Anarchy Comics showcased an international cast of artists who identified as anarchists, or non-sectarian socialists. An example of this is Spain Rodriguez, a Marxist, who was considered of \\"sufficient libertarian bent\\" to be included. Contributors including Rodriguez, Gilbert Shelton, Jay Kinney and Paul Mavrides were distinct for \\"adding new dimensions to the political comic\\" in the underground comix press of the 1970s and '80s. =List of contributors= The following is a list of each contributor in alphabetical order. Themes=Anarchism Overtly anarchist in its bent, all content included was based on anarchist philosophy and history. The humor of each anthology was satirical in nature, mocking both mainstream culture as well as traditional leftist ideas of revolution. Punk rock Roger Sabin, an English historian of comics and subculture, noted a number of connections between the comic and the Punk rock subculture of the '70s, suggesting that Jay Kinney \\"clearly hoped to pick up a share of the punk market with this very political comic.\\" The covers of issues No.2 and No.3 both feature archetypal \\"punk\\" characters, and issue No. 2 features the short comic \\"Kultur Documents\\", a punk rock parody of Archie Comics. Sabin also analyzes \\"Too Real\\", Jay Kinney's short comic from the first issue, as being jointly inspired by a combination of Situationist and punk rock imagery. Sabin noted that many of the comics didn't have any relationship to Punk culture, but thought that the comic may have introduced radical ideas to a generation of new, young punks.

History The town of Byczyna was first mention in 1054 when it temporarily served as the capital of the Bishopric of Wroc≈Çaw. Its name is of Polish origin. It was part of Poland and during its fragmentation period it was part of the duchies of Silesia, G≈Çog√≥w and Namys≈Ç√≥w, before it was again under direct rule of Polish King Casimir III the Great from 1341 to 1348. It was granted town rights before 1268.Robert Krzysztofik, Lokacje miejskie na obszarze Polski. Dokumentacja geograficzno-historyczna, Katowice, 2007, p. 22-23 (in Polish) In 1356 it passed to the Czech Crown Lands, and it soon returned under the rule of local Polish dukes of the Piast dynasty, as part of the duchies of ≈öwidnica, Opole, Brzeg, Ole≈õnica, again Brzeg, Opole and finally Legnica until 1675. Afterwards it was incorporated into the Habsburg-ruled Czech Kingdom. It was a border town, *Pitzen, north of Kluczbork (Creitzberg) (in the Duchy of Brzeg (Ducatus Bregensis)) 1600 Silesia Map located near Poland. Jan Zamoyski at the Battle of Byczyna in 1588, painting by Jan Matejko The Battle of Byczyna took place nearby between Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria, who was elected as king of Poland, and Sigismund III Vasa who also was elected as king, on January 24, 1588. Maximilian was defeated. He surrendered and went to imprisonment. The German author Gustav FreytagGustav Freytag in his Memories mentions border violations against Pitschen farmers reports in his memories about yearly border violations at Byczyna. During the Thirty Years' War the town was occupied by the Saxons in 1633 and Swedes in 1646. In the 16th century, a Polish school was established, which flourished in the 17th century, and from 1657 to 1661 its rector was Byczyna-born Polish scholar and translator John Herbinius. After the Prussian annexation in 1742, Byczyna, under the Germanized name Pitschen, entered a period of Germanisation, and the local school slowly diminished. In 1757 the town suffered the largest fire in its history. Despite those circumstances, in the 19th century, the town was still largely inhabited by Poles. After World War I and the rebirth of independent Poland, Germany introduced a number of restrictions, including a state of emergency, to hinder the self-organization of local Poles. In the interwar period the town remained part of Germany and, subsequently, has been affected by a recession. In September 1939, Germany, invaded Poland also from Pitschen, sparking World War II. After the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, Byczyna was finally reintegrated with Poland.

Biography Born in Rome the son of a silversmith, he became the leading sculptor in Florence, where he died. He was trained by Giovanni Battista Maini. In Rome, he completed the statue of St Joseph Calasanctius (1755) for the nave of St Peter's Basilica. He arrived in Florence in 1769, and the next year was named official court sculptor in 1770. Grand Duke Leopold (later Emperor Leopold II) first employed him to restore antique sculpture. He completed a portrait bust of Grand Duke Leopoldo (1771‚Äì74; Pitti). Spinazzi contributed monuments to three celebrated Florentines for the church of Santa Croce: jurist Giovanni Lami (died 1770); Angelo Tavanti (died 1782); and author Niccol√≤ Machiavelli (1787). In 1792 he added an angel to the Baptism by Andrea Sansovino and Vincenzo Danti above the Porta del Paradiso of the Baptistery of Florence. His virtuoso marble figures of heavily veiled women, for example Faith (1781; Santa Maria Maddalena de' Pazzi) and Religion (from the tomb of Varvara Jakovlevna, Princess Beloselskij, 1794; Turin, Museo Civico), follow precedents set by Antonio Corradini in Naples. Spinazzi was professor of sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts, Florence, from 1784. One of pupils was Francesco Carradori. He died at Florence in 1798.

The third and higher moments, as used in the skewness and kurtosis, are examples of HOS, whereas the first and second moments, as used in the arithmetic mean (first), and variance (second) are examples of low-order statistics. HOS are particularly used in estimation of shape parameters, such as skewness and kurtosis, as when measuring the deviation of a distribution from the normal distribution. On the other hand, due to the higher powers, HOS are significantly less robust than lower-order statistics. In statistical theory, one long-established approach to higher-order statistics, for univariate and multivariate distributions is through the use of cumulants and joint cumulants.Kendall, MG., Stuart, A. (1969) The Advanced Theory of Statistics, Volume 1: Distribution Theory, 3rd Edition, Griffin. (Chapter 3) In time series analysis, the extension of these is to higher order spectra, for example the bispectrum and trispectrum. An alternative to the use of HOS and higher moments is to instead use L-moments, which are linear statistics (linear combinations of order statistics), and thus more robust than HOS.

Accessed February 15, 2011. Family history He was the son of Jacob Walingen (sometimes spelled Waligh) (b. 1599 d. 8/17/1657). Jacob along with his brother Simon Waligh (b. unknown d. 3//1649) were the first of the Van Winkle family to arrive in America from the Netherlands in 1630. The brothers were given parcels of land to farm from the Kiliaen van Rensselaer estate which included Papscanee Island. Simon purchased a plantation on Manhattan Island but was killed shortly after by Native Americans in Pavonia (modern day Jersey City, New Jersey). Jacob spent many years after this event traveling between the Netherlands and the Dutch colony of New Netherland negotiating for land purchases within certain parts of the colony. Jacob became a member of Council of twelve men which was the first representative official body within the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. After unsuccessfully trying to start a community along the Connecticut River and drive out the encroaching English settlers, Jacob settled down to farm a large parcel of land located in Pavonia. A particularly severe out break of hostilities between the natives and the colonists known as the Peach Tree War forced survivors, including Jacob, to flee to Fort Amsterdam on Manhattan Island. After peace was restored Jacob returned to Pavonia and rebuilt his farm. Jacob entered a trade guild in 1657 but died shortly after, leaving behind a wife and seven children.

Biography Born in Maribor, Slovenia to a Polish father and a Russian mother, Schoenfeld moved to Berlin with her family at age six. She proceeded to study ballet, violin, and piano before switching to cello at age eleven. Her first teacher was Karl Niedermeyer, a pupil of Hugo Becker, with whom she studied until age fourteen. From there she entered the prestigious Hochschule f√ºr Musik in Berlin - eighteen being the traditional age of entry. She then spent the next four years studying with Adolf Steiner, a well-known soloist. In 1952, Schoenfeld's parents, weary of the Russian dictatorship, led the Schoenfeld family to flee to the United States. From there, a connection from the Idyllwild Arts Academy led the then-dean of the USC Thornton School of Music to ask her, and her sister Alice, a concert violinist, to join the faculty. They remained there since, serving alongside Gregor Piatigorsky, Jascha Heifetz, and many other distinguished musicians. Through the span of her career, Schoenfeld produced over 200 recordings, recorded by the BBC. Her students have also become top prizewinners in competitions such as Geneva, the Casals Competition (Budapest), Tchaikovsky (Russia), Markneukirchen (Germany), Antonio Janigro (Croatia), and the Concert Artist Guild (U.S.). Her students have also performed repeatedly as soloists with the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra, Georgian Chamber Orchestra (former Soviet republic of Georgia), Slovenian Philharmonic, and Bamberg Symphony Orchestra (Germany) with such eminent conductors as Zubin Mehta, Horst Stein, Esa-Pekka Salonen, Gerard Schwarz and Carl St. Clair.

He also played drums with Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons amongst other bands. Young was twice inducted into the Aria Hall of Fame as a member of both Daddy Cool and Jo Jo Zep & The Falcons which were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007 respectively. Biography=Rondells Gary Young (drums, vocals) and Wayne Duncan (bass guitar, vocals) were the rhythm section of many bands, particularly instrumental groups, from the early 1960s onwards. One of these was The Rondells who were also the backing band for Bobby & Laurie, a popular singing duo with their No. 1 hit \\"Hitch Hiker\\" from 1966. Young joined the Rondells in 1964, at the age of 17, whilst still at Carey Baptist Grammar School. The Rondells had developed from a 1962 school band, The Silhouettes, which were a Shadows-style instrumental band with Ian B. Allen (bass), future Aztec Gil Matthews (guitar), Ed Nantes (guitar), Roger Treble (lead guitar) and Young (drums). This group changed its name to The Lincolns in 1963, by which time Matthews had left and they were managed by Ron Blackmore. Bassist Duncan (ex-Ramrods), who had learnt bass from Allen, replaced Allen who left to join the Planets. The Lincolns added singer Bob Johnson when beat music broke through in 1964. Young later took over on vocals from Johnson, but tired of having to sing and play drums, he quit in early 1965 to form the vocal duo Double Trouble with Issy Dye and was replaced in The Lincolns by drummer Barry Gough. Double Trouble split soon after and Young rejoined Duncan, Treble and rhythm guitarist John Sullivan (who was later replaced by Barry Rogers) in a new touring version of The Lincolns, which was billed as The Rondells whenever they backed another Blackmore act, Bobby & Laurie. They also backed other Blackmore artists such as Bobby Knight, Lynne Randell, Buddy England, Billy Adams and Bobby Shore. Young also played in The Changing Times and Ram Jam Big Band. In February 1967, following the split of Bobby & Laurie, Laurie Allen put together a soul revue, originally called Dice, later renamed The Laurie Allen Revue. The lineup included The Rondells' Young, Barry Rogers and Duncan, guitarist Phil Manning and as backing singers, sisters Glenys and Colleen Hewett. The Revue released three singles on Festival Records ‚Äì \\"Beautiful Brown Eyes\\" (August 1967), \\"Any Little Bit\\" (April 1968) and \\"As Long As I Got You\\" (June 1968). Sons of the Vegetal Mother Young and Ross Wilson met in 1969 whilst both were working in a book warehouse, each had previous bandmates who were interested in forming a new group. Wilson, Ross Hannaford, Young and Duncan formed Sons of the Vegetal Mother later that year, this band had a more experimental Progressive rock sound. Other members included: Mike Rudd (later in Spectrum) (bass), Trevor Griffin (piano), Jeremy Kellock (Jeremy Noone) (tenor sax), Tim Partridge (bass), Ian Wallace (alto sax), Simon Wettenhall (trumpet) and Bruce Woodcock (tenor sax). Daddy Cool As a side project from Sons of the Vegetal Mother, four of its members (Duncan, Hannaford, Wilson and Young) formed Daddy Cool in 1970.

His masterworks are considered to be the choir stalls in Zwiefalten Abbey and Ottobeuren Abbey. Christian was born in Riedlingen, in Further Austria (present-day Baden-W√ºrttemberg). His rare double gift as a woodworker and stucco sculptor was equalled only by Joseph Anton Feuchtmayer. In 1744 Christian received a commission to work in Zwiefalten Abbey, where until 1755 he created the choir stalls and numerous stucco figures for the high altar and nave and side chapels, working alongside the painter Franz Joseph Spiegler and the stucco master Johann Michael Feuchtmayer and under the direction of the architect Johann Michael Fischer. Subsequently, Christian was commissioned to work on the abbatial church of the Holy Trinity in Ottobeuren Abbey, for which the architect was once again Fischer and for which Christian created the choir stalls, with gilded reliefs, and the organ reliefs. Once again he worked with Spiegler and J. M. Feuchtmayer. Besides these two major works, he also worked on various smaller projects, including the parish church in Unlingen and the abbey church in Buchau. Christian and his wife had 10 children, of whom five survived infancy. His son Karl Anton Christian (1731-1810) became abbot of St. Trudpert's Abbey near M√ºnstertal in the Black Forest, and for this church J. J.

Exile Due to a series of disagreements with the military dictators in power, his career in Brazil was interrupted in the mid-1970s and he was forced to move abroad, settling in London, where he studied at Guildhall School of Music and Drama, played with the London Symphony Orchestra and recorded the album Let the Children Hear the Music. The album set a precedent, as it became the first foreign recording by a Brazilian musician censored in Brazil (the same record was never released in England either, having been deemed \\"misplaced\\" by the studios). During a second exile, Taiguara also lived in Paris and a few African countries, mainly Tanzania, where he studied Journalism for a year. Political views and last years Always troubled by the harsh reality of the less fortunate, Taiguara increasingly leaned towards leftist views, later becoming involved with political activities which rallied for a fairer future and social and economical equality for all. Although he was never officially affiliated with any political parties, communist leader Luis Carlos Prestes became a great friend and mentor in his later years. Taiguara composed and recorded the song \\"O Cavaleiro da Esperan√ßa\\" {The Hope Knight} in his honour. Thirteen years after performing in Brazil for the last time, Taiguara returned with the concert \\"Thirteen Octobers\\" and released two more albums: \\"Can√ßoes de Amor e Liberdade\\" {Songs of love and Freedom} (1984) and \\"Brazil Afri\\" {Afro Brasil} (1994) in the following years. On 14 February 1996 he died from bladder cancer. His last project, an album of songs that celebrated and examined the joys and hardships of the poor living on the slums of Rio de Janeiro, never came to completion.

The episode portrays the civil war between the Second Triumvirate and the combined forces of Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinus, murderers of Julius Caesar. The Battle of Philippi is featured in this episode. Plot summary The episode begins with Brutus and Cassius on their march through Greece with their army of 100,000 soldiers to challenge Octavian. Cassius is worried about the grain supply for their army, whereas Brutus is cheerful, having spent time getting to know the men and jubilantly talking about saving the Republic. In Cisalpine Gaul Marc Antony, Lepidus and Octavian are devising a plan to surprise Brutus and Cassius. They believe their enemies do not know that they are reunited and hope to overcome Brutus and Cassius with an unexpectedly large army. Octavian comes up with a list of supporters of Brutus in Rome and proposes to send the list to Lucius Vorenus and order him to have them killed. Lepidus objects to the killing of some of the most honorable men in Rome but is turned down by the prospect of the money the killing would bring to them. They resolve to march to Greece and leave Lepidus in Rome. In Rome, Lucius Vorenus divides up the names from the list among the gangs he controls. He makes them an offer to loot the houses of each victim and take as much as they can carry. Titus Pullo gets the order to kill Cicero, but Vorenus insists on \\"no looting on this name\\" to show some respect. He also asks the gang leaders about what to do with the expected wealth, and proposes to distribute fish and bread to the people as a gesture of good will by the collegium. After some debate (and Memmio speaking in favor of the proposal) it is accepted. Meanwhile Vorenus' daughter Vorena is receiving gifts from a stranger whose ulterior motive is to woo her at Memmio's order. While in Rome, Agrippa is greeted by Octavia who reveals that she reciprocates his feelings for her, but Agrippa tries to dissuade her stating that he is lowborn and can never marry Octavia. Regardless the two begin a love affair that Atia recognizes but agrees to keep silent about. While Titus Pullo prepares for the killing of Cicero, he is teased by Gaia. When asked about it by his wife Eirene, he suddenly proposes to take her and Vorenus and his whole family to the lovely countryside where Cicero is living. Just as the company starts their picnic, Titus and two men are leaving them to get their job done. While playing with his children, Vorenus wishes him good luck. Cicero receives news of Mark Antony and Octavian being reunited, and immediately begins scribbling a message to Brutus just as Titus Pullo arrives at the front door. He manages to finish the messages just before Pullo finds him. When Pullo enters, both men exchange pleasantries in an extraordinarily respectful manner. Cicero briefly tries to bribe Pullo, but he declines with a smile. Cicero asks for a few minutes to compose himself and while he is watching an eagle flies overhead. Pullo amicably asks for some of the peaches growing in the atrium of Cicero's estate, then executes him with a gladiatorial thrust down through the neck. The messenger Cicero sent is stopped by Vorenus, and almost killed for nearly trampling little Lucius, but then allowed to go on his way‚Äîhe has, however, dropped his vital letter from Cicero, which Vorenus does not see, but the children find it and fold it into a paper crown. In Rome, Octavian and Posca are debating some additional names to be added to their killing list on the wishes of Mark Antony. When Octavian rejects them, stating he would prefer not to appear as a butcher, Agrippa leaves in disgust. Outside, Agrippa meets Octavia, and after solving some misunderstandings, they kiss for the first time and later have sex in a hired brothel room. The next day, Octavian and Agrippa set off with their troops to Greece to meet Brutus and Cassius. An assembly of Jews discusses the attempt of Herod to bribe the Romans, depending on which side wins the civil war. Levi, the brother of Timon, strongly objects to such plans. The assembly ends in a turmoil with Levi jubilant at his alleged success and the fact that Timon has finally rejected his Roman ways and resumed his Jewish heritage. Titus Pullo is ashamed about not participating in Octavian's campaign because he feels himself to still be a soldier. Vorenus tries to console him, envisioning great things that they both could do, but Pullo remains wary. Later on, he discusses the topic with his wife Eirene, but resolves to stay in Rome. Eirene then reveals to Pullo that she is pregnant. Brutus and Cassius are in their camp near Philippi in Greece, and receive word from the scouts that the combined force of Mark Antony and Octavian is only a day's march away. Moreover, they are outnumbered, with their 14 legions to Octavian's and Antony's combined 19 legions. Cassius immediately orders to break camp and begin the retreat. Brutus objects and convinces Cassius to accept the battle, there and then, saying, \\"No more running.\\" The armies are about to engage and Mark Antony commences the fighting with the words: \\"Let's have some fun.\\" In the ensuing bloodbath, Mark Antony and Octavian prevail. A mortally wounded Cassius is brought to Brutus whose remaining forces begin to disintegrate. After Cassius dies, Brutus tells one of his soldiers to \\"give his mother his best\\" and to say \\"something suitable.\\" He then kisses his father's ring, looks to the gods, and resolves to go down fighting. He then strips off his armor, and walks alone towards the advancing forces of Mark Antony, wounding a single soldier before being felled. He dies in a fashion deliberately reminiscent of Caesar's assassination, being stabbed repeatedly by a surrounding mob of soldiers. Mark Antony and Octavian ride over the battlefield and indulge in their victory. They hope to recover the bodies of Brutus and Cassius, but only the latter is found‚Äîthe former has had his ring looted by a local beggar as the two rode by unaware. Historical Accuracy *The battle of Philippi existed out of two separate battles. Cassius committed suicide after the first (October 3), and Brutus after his defeat on October 23. * Mark Antony reportedly found the body of Brutus and respectfully gave him the proper funeral rites, in contrast to his body being unnoticed in the series. Antony remembered that Brutus has agreed to participate in the plot to murder Julius Caesar only on the condition that Antony be spared. * Despite Agrippa's lower-class background he would later marry Octavian's daughter Julia and is an ancestor of the Emperors Caligula and Nero. * Antony's long-standing grudge with Cicero was true in history, and Cicero's name was the first name written on enemies of Rome that were to be killed by order of Antony, Octavian and Lepidus.

Originally hosted by Representatives from the three congressional districts within the reach of WKRG's signal, the commercial-free talk show gave viewers a local perspective of Washington, D.C. and the central Gulf Coast from their congressman's standpoint. The program was free to broadcast and was paid for by tax dollars. It was recorded in one of the United States Capitol recording studios and in Mobile. History D.H. \\"Buck\\" Long, vice president of WKRG, brought the idea of Congressional Report to the attention of Jack Edwards, who represented . The program would be a collaboration of Edwards, Trent Lott of and Bob Sikes of . Sikes was reluctant at first, according to Lott, but he ultimately joined the program from its first broadcast. Sikes was a Democrat; Edwards and Lott were Republicans. Throughout the years, the hosts made sure the program would remain non-partisan and free of conflicts. After succeeding Sikes in 1979, fellow Democrat Earl Hutto joined the program. Edwards retired from Congress in 1985, and fellow Republican Sonny Callahan succeeded him in Congress and on the program. Shortly after Lott was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1988, Callahan took over as sole host. Lott and Hutto would reappear on the program during Callahan's term in Congress. In 2002, Callahan announced his retirement from Congress and his Chief of Staff, Jo Bonner, became his successor. Like his former boss, Bonner also hosted Congressional Report on his own, and invited numerous guests. As an aide to Callahan, Bonner helped produce the program during the mid-1980s. In the July 2003 Nielsen ratings, the program in its 10:00 a.m. timeslot (following Face the Nation on CBS) still ranked higher in viewers than those of Mobile's three other major network TV affiliates. It continued to be profitable for WKRG, which had estimated that it could earn $1500 or more for airing the commercial-free program. Hiatus On June 4, 2006, WKRG halted further airings of Congressional Report in response to an equal-time complaint by Jo Bonner's opponent in the 2006 election for Congress. Mobile lawyer Vivian Beckerle also accused the program of being a political promotion for Bonner's campaign. The station had planned on putting the program on hiatus August 6 due to federal rules requiring that such programs not air 90 days or less before an election, but the May 26 letter to WKRG made station officials put the program on hiatus two months earlier than expected. The last pre-recorded program, which never aired, featured not a politician, but two emergency management officials from Mobile County and Baldwin County discussing hurricane preparedness. In exchange of the hiatus, Beckerle was offered two 30-minute segments of airtime. The segments aired respectively on June 11 and June 18 in Congressional Report's former timeslot. Bonner was re- elected in November, but never received word on when the Congressional Report would return to WKRG. In February 2007, Bonner's spokeswoman Nancy Wall acknowledged that her boss accepted that Congressional Report would not return to WKRG, but was actively exploring alternative methods of returning the program to the air. However, none of those efforts went anywhere before Bonner retired in 2013.

Biography He was the son of Sir Patrick Crichton, Laird of Cranstoun. Robert was a younger son and chose an ecclesiastical career. From 1517 he was Provost of St Giles Collegiate Church.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 357. Additionally, he was Precentor of Dunkeld Cathedral between 1530 and 1534,Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 109. and in 1532 almost took part in an exchange with Walter Maxwell for the Chancellorship of the diocese of Moray.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 277. Crichton was the nephew of George Crichton, Bishop of Dunkeld, and in 1543 had been appointed coadjutor and successor to his uncle. As it turned out, 1543 was the year before Bishop George's death, and so when the latter event took place in January 1544, Robert regarded himself as the rightful bishop. However, this had taken place without the consent of the Scottish government.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 88-92; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. The government thus ignored the appointment, and placed John Hamilton in charge instead. Robert litigated against Hamilton in the Papal see,Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, pp. 88-92 until in 1547 Hamilton was translated to the archbishopric of St Andrews Instead of giving into Crichton's claims, however, in 1549 the Governor of Scotland, James Hamilton, Duke of Ch√¢tellerault, gave the crown nomination to Donald Campbell, Abbot of Coupar Angus.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100. The dispute continued into 1553, with Campbell failing to secure papal recognition. When Mary of Guise took over the government from Ch√¢tellerault in 1554, she acknowledged Crichton's position and Campbell appears to have given up his claims to the bishopric. Crichton was therefore uncontested Bishop of Dunkeld, and accordingly resigned his position as Provost of St Giles. Towards the end of the decade Protestantism took hold in Scotland, and in 1560 the Scots formally broke their ecclesiastical ties with Rome. Crichton, along with John Hamilton, Archbishop of St Andrews, William Chisholm, Bishop of Dunblane, and Gavin Hamilton, Abbot of Kilwinning, were the only prelates to dissent from the Reformation Parliament of 1560.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 93; Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 130. When the Jesuit Nicholas de Gouda visited Scotland in the summer of 1562 to initiate a Counter-Reformation, Crichton was the only cleric to give him an interview.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 94; Foggie, \\"Hamilton, John (1510/11‚Äì1571)\\". Crichton's solid Catholicism was further revealed four years later when he assisted with the Catholic baptism of the infant Prince James in 1566.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 94. Crichton was a firm supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots, and was one of the castilians who held Edinburgh Castle in her name between 1570 and 1573.Hewitt, \\"Castilians in Edinburgh (act. 1570‚Äì1573)\\". For this he was forfeited by Parliament in 1571 and when in 1573 the castle was captured by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton, Crichton was imprisoned in Blackness Castle.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 93; Hewitt, \\"Castilians in Edinburgh (act. 1570‚Äì1573)\\". In 1576 he was transferred to Edinburgh and kept in the ward of Lord Seton. He was restored to the bishopric of Dunkeld on 22 August 1584, but died in March 1585. He was buried, with the King's permission, in the St Giles', Edinburgh.Dowden, Bishops of Scotland, p. 93; Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 100 ReferencesFurther reading * Dowden, John, The Bishops of Scotland, ed.

The Bay Area rooted player has also notably worked with Grateful Dead members Phil Lesh, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann. He played with Steve Kimock Band, and was a founding member of Tulsa progressive jazz band Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey. Biography Mathis comes from a prolific musical family and started learning the fundamentals of classical music when he was four years old. Before picking up the bass guitar at eleven, he spent time studying piano, cello, and voice. His early influences included Beethoven, The Beach Boys, Led Zeppelin, Cliff Burton of Metallica, Michael Jackson, and Jimi Hendrix. When Mathis was fifteen he performed Vivaldi's \\"Mandolin Concerto in D\\" on mandolin with members of the Tulsa Philharmonic. At sixteen he attended the Interlochen Center for the Arts near Traverse City, Michigan, where he was the top-ranked bassist in the program. While at the academy he developed a love of jazz music, and began transcribing and memorizing the music of Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and his Hot Five, and bass virtuoso, Jaco Pastorius. In 1994, Mathis met Brian Haas and a group of like-minded Tulsa musicians, who together created the Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey (JFJO). Originally an octet, the band toured six years before becoming the piano-bass-drums trio for which it became known. Mathis continued to tour and record with JFJO through 2008. Mathis' unique style and tone has been described as \\"talking bass.\\" In a feature article in Bass Player in September, 2002, noted music author Bill Milkowski writes: \\"No other electric bass player around today has been as successful (as Mathis) at incorporating mind-blowing and mondo-effects into a personal voice on the instrument. The charismatic Mathis is freed up to soar into the high register and wail with impunity on his heavy effected bass guitar because Haas is holding down the basslines on the Rhodes.\\"Milkowski, Bill. \\"Reed Mathis: Flights of Fancy.\\" Bass Player 13, no. 9 (September, 2002): 12. In 2005‚Äì2006, Mathis toured with the Steve Kimock Band, which featured Steve Kimock on guitar and lap steel guitar, Robert Walter on Hammond B3 organ and Rhodes piano, and Rodney Holmes on drums. In 2006, Mathis united with pianist Marco Benevento and drummers Matt Chamberlain and Andrew Barr to form the Marco Benevento Trio. He has appeared on three releases with the Marco Benevento Trio and continues to tour with the group. The trio appeared at New York City's famed Carnegie Hall in June, 2009. In late 2007, Mathis joined the San Francisco rock band Tea Leaf Green (TLG). In 2008, he split time between TLG and JFJO. He appears on the Tea Leaf Green's 2008 release Raise Up The Tent and tours as a member of the band. In 2008, Mathis produced Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey's \\"Winterwood\\" (named for Winterwood Studios in Eureka Springs, Arkansas). Shortly before the album's release in January, 2009, Mathis announced his departure from JFJO, citing a desire to pursue his other musical endeavors. Chris Combs (guitar) and Matt Hayes (upright bass) joined Haas (piano) and Josh Raymer (drums) to form the new JFJO lineup. In 2009 Mathis became an original member of 7 Walkers, a band led by Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann. He recorded on their self-titled debut album that was released on November 2, 2010. He left the band in 2010 due to touring commitments with Tea Leaf Green and was replaced by George Porter Jr.. Mathis performed with the Rhythm Devils for their 2011 tour. In 2014 he joined Billy Kreutzmann's new band Billy & the Kids as well as The Golden Gate Wingmen with John Kadlecik.

In the 1890s, it was upgraded to railway standards, extended to Hedgehope, and handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department. This line was known as the Hedgehope Branch and opened on 17 July 1899 with a station in Browns. Passenger services ceased on 9 February 1931, and due to the decline in freight from stations beyond Browns, the Browns-Hedgehope section closed on 24 December 1953. Agricultural lime was the predominant traffic from Browns, and when government subsidies for the transport of lime by rail were slashed and the railway link (the Tokanui Branch) to the primary destination for Browns lime was closed, freight tonnages fell below sustainable levels.

A parody of William Lever, whose factory was named \\"Port Sunlight\\". On 4 August 1906 Watson and William Lever, by then the largest manufacturer, met in the Grand Hotel in London to finalise a plan to set up a \\"Soap Trust\\" which would merge the major soap manufacturers into a monopoly, thereby gaining economies of scale in advertising and production costs. Watson favoured the use of a parent company whilst Lever preferred a scheme of exchange of shares between participating companies to bind them together. This occurred during a period of many corporate trusts in the United States. The scheme was strongly opposed by the Daily Mail newspaper which campaigned for a boycott by its readers of the trust brands. Profits at participating firms were thereby severely reduced. The Northcliffe Press in its expanding and highly popular campaign overstepped the mark by falsely asserting trust soaps to be made from scented fish oil. Although Watson and Lever won substantial libel damages from the press, losses in reputation and profits had been suffered all round. On the proposal of Watson and Crosfield, another large manufacturer, the scheme was abandoned in November 1906. By then Watson had already disposed of much of his shareholding, previously all held by himself and his uncle Charles, to William Lever, in exchange for Lever Brothers shares to set up the trust.Charles Wilson.

He had sold his half share in the Planter's Margarine Co Ltd. to Lever in July 1915, a joint venture established in November 1914 at Godley in Cheshire with Levers, in response to Government anxiety at the wartime loss of Dutch supplies, which by 1915 was the country's second largest margarine manufacturer.Wilson, I, pp.227‚Äì9 He had supplied it from his Olympia Oil & Cake Co.

Wartime munitions work Telegram of 21 June 1916 from Lloyd George to Watson. Amatol is an explosive consisting of TNT and Ammonium Nitrate. At the start of the First World War Watson's industrial and organisational expertise was used to assist the government in the establishment and operation of national munitions factories, most notably at the First National Shell Filling Factory at Barnbow, Leeds. Following the heavy consumption of munitions in the opening battles of WWI at the Somme, the Northcliffe Press (Daily Mail) brought to the public's attention what became known as \\"The Shell Crisis\\", signifying that the nation had given little thought to securing long-term munitions supplies needed to successfully wage an unprecedented protracted war. The Asquith government fell, to be replaced by that of Lloyd George, recently appointed Minister of Munitions to resolve the crisis. Watson as chairman of a six-man \\"Leeds Munitions Committee\\" made up from local industrialists, formed in August 1915, was charged by the government to immediately establish the first of 12 National Shell Filling Factories. A factory was promptly established on a greenfield site at Barnbow, close to Leeds. It resembled a small town of detached houses and huts more than a traditional factory, to contain and localise any accidental explosions. It remained the largest such operation in the country, having despatched 566,000 tons of finished ammunition overseas by the Armistice. At its height it employed 16,000 workers, 93% of whom were women and girls. Its fire brigade responded to three accidental explosions, the most serious of which occurred in 1916, killing 35 women and injuring many more.Tony Cox. \\"Barnbow Munitions Factory 1915‚Äì18.\\" The Barwicker No. 47.

He had purchased the Robert Adam neo-classical mansion Compton Verney and its estate in 1921 from Lord Willoughby de Broke, intending to make his seat there, which intention was not realised due to his sudden death in March 1922, before having taken up residence.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment after he was convicted of participation in a plot against Turkmen President Saparmurat Niyazov in 2002. Little is known about his life is prison; it's even unknown if he is still alive.  Biography  ≈ûyhmyradow was born in Ashgabat to an Armenian mother and Turkmen father.Dilip Hiro, Inside Central Asia, pg. 217 Beginning in 1971, he worked in the Soviet embassies to Pakistan and India. After Turkmenistan gained independence, in 1992 he became Deputy Foreign Minister and then First Deputy Foreign Minister; he also became Deputy Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers in the same year. He became Foreign Minister in 1995 and served in that position for five years. He subsequently became a Special Envoy dealing with Caspian Sea affairs and the normalization of the situation in Afghanistan in June 2000. He served in that post until March 2001, when he became Turkmenistan's Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. He remained in the latter position until November 2001, when he announced his opposition to President Niyazov. Following an alleged assassination attempt against Niyazov on 25 November 2002, ≈ûyhmyradow was arrested in Ashgabat (he had previously been in exile in Russia) on 25 December 2002. It was alleged that, as part of the plot, he had entered Turkmenistan from Uzbekistan prior to the attempt on Niyazov's life, and that, after it failed, he had taken refuge in the Uzbek embassy from 26 November to 7 December. Subsequently, according to ≈ûyhmyradow's confession, he stayed in a friend's apartment until he was captured. This confession was shown on television; in it, he said ‚ÄúWe are a criminal gang, a mafia. There is not a single normal person among us. We are all nonentities. I‚Äôm not a person who is able to rule the state, but on the contrary, a criminal who can only destroy the state ... While living in Russia, we were involved in drug use and, intoxicated, we recruited mercenaries to commit the terrorist act. Our task was to destabilize the situation in Turkmenistan, undermine the constitutional system and attempt to assassinate the president‚Äù, and he also praised Niyazov very highly. Some suspected that torture was used to obtain the confession. On December 30, ≈ûyhmyradow was sentenced to 25 years in prison, the maximum possible punishment; however, the People's Council amended the criminal code shortly thereafter to enable life sentences for traitors, and ≈ûyhmyradow's sentence was accordingly changed.Alec Rasizade, \\"Turkmenbashi and his Turkmenistan\\", Contemporary Review, October 1, 2003.

Berdimuhamedow said that he thought they were still alive.

The railway grew from a private bush tramway built in 1883 that ran from a junction with the Kingston Branch in Winton into the Browns Gap area. In the 1890s, the tramway was upgraded to railway standards, extended to Hedgehope, and handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department. This line was known as the Hedgehope Branch and it opened on 17 July 1899 with a station near Springhills known as Springhills Siding.

The Noise FM is currently based in Los Angeles, California. Music The Noise FM was formed in the summer of 2005 when two prominent Fort Scott, Kansas, bands came to an end. The original quartet consisted of Alex and Austin Ward of Pond Monkeys and Trent Pruitt and Duncan Cheney of Army of Prawnz. The band's original intention was to write enough material in a two-week span to play an upcoming benefit concert. Needless to say, the band's six-song debut performance was rough. But what began as a one-off concert soon became a full-time band. During the early days the band wore a lot of cargo pants and occasionally shorts on stage. In 2007, following the departure of Trent and Duncan, the band relocated to Lawrence, Kansas, with Derek Wright on bass, and later Oliver Mosier. Bass players are hard to find and even harder to hold on to. While in Lawrence, the band released the full-length ‚ÄúDream of the Attack‚Äù in 2008. A couple of tunes found their way into video games and television shows: * The synth-rocker \\"Simple Simone\\" was featured on the European-only release SBK-09 Superbike World Champsionship on Xbox. * \\"Only Human\\" is on Tap Tap Revenge 3 for iPhone. * The riff-heavy \\"Iron Lung\\" is featured in the Fox College Sports Best of 2009 television special. It's a sports show. In May 2010, The Noise FM released \\"Enclave,\\" which is probably a better record than \\"Dream of the Attack,\\" but it was NOT featured on Fox College Sports.

CRP protein binds cAMP, which causes a conformational change that allows CRP to bind tightly to a specific DNA site in the promoters of the genes it controls. CRP then activates transcription through direct protein‚Äìprotein interactions with RNA polymerase. The genes regulated by CRP are mostly involved in energy metabolism, such as galactose, citrate, or the PEP group translocation system. In Escherichia coli, cyclic AMP receptor protein (CRP) can regulate the transcription of more than 100 genes. The signal to activate CRP is the binding of cyclic AMP. Binding of cAMP to CRP leads to a long-distance signal transduction from the N-terminal cAMP-binding domain to the C-terminal domain of the protein, which is responsible for interaction with specific sequences of DNA. At \\"Class I\\" CRP- dependent promoters, CRP binds to a DNA site located upstream of core promoter elements and activates transcription through protein‚Äìprotein interactions between \\"activating region 1\\" of CRP and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase alpha subunit. At \\"Class II\\" CRP-dependent promoters, CRP binds to a DNA site that overlaps the promoter -35 element and activates transcription through two sets of protein‚Äìprotein interactions: (1) an interaction between \\"activating region 1\\" of CRP and the C-terminal domain of RNA polymerase alpha subunit, and (2) an interaction between \\"activating region 2\\" of CRP and the N-terminal domain of RNA polymerase alpha subunit. At \\"Class III\\" CRP- dependent promoters, CRP functions together with one or more \\"co-activator\\" proteins.

The desire to control migration was cited as a major reason behind the system in the edict which established the hopae law. However, it was abandoned only three years later in 1416, after the completion of the new household registry; this may have been because the hopae were no longer necessary after the completion of the registry, or the opposition which commoners demonstrated to the requirement of carrying hopae. The hopae system was promulgated and abolished several times in the following years. King Sejo revived the system in 1458, again with the aim of controlling the movement of people, this time in order to aid in suppressing the rebellion by Yi Jing-ok in Hamgil Province, which found widespread support among peasants who had fled from their homes; the law would remain in effect for twelve more years.

On 17 July 1899, a branch line diverging from the Kingston Branch in Winton was opened to Hedgehope and it served the town for over half a century. Due to low demand, passengers always had to travel in carriages attached to slow freight services; these were known as mixed trains. The rise of private car ownership in the 1920s caused the quantity of passengers to slip to levels unsustainable for even mixed trains, and accordingly passenger provisions were cancelled from 9 February 1931. Freight quantities also steadily declined, and in the early 1950s, the decision was taken to close over half the branch. On 24 December 1953, the branch was truncated to Browns and Hedgehope's railway service fully ceased.

The duchies were later merged into Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg. He was the ninth but sixth surviving son of Johann II, Duke of Saxe-Weimar, and Dorothea Maria of Anhalt. His mother was a granddaughter of Christoph, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, and great-granddaughter of Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg. Life Left an orphan early in life (his father died in 1605 and his mother in 1617), he was brought up in a strict manner, and was gifted and precocious but not physically strong. He soon showed traits of the piety of the time. As ruler, by his character and governmental ability as well as by personal attention to matters of state, he introduced a golden age for his subjects after the ravages of the Thirty Years' War. By wise economy, which did not exclude fitting generosity or display on proper occasions, he freed his land from debt, left at his death a considerable sum in the treasury, and reduced taxation. Public security and an incorruptible and efficient judiciary received much of his attention, and his regulations served as models for other states. He did not rise far enough above his time to do away with torture, though he restricted it, and in the century of trials for witchcraft he yielded to the common delusion, though he was not otherwise inclined to superstition and was a foe of alchemy. He prohibited dueling and imposed the death penalty for a mortal result. In 1640, according to the partition treaty with his brothers, Ernst received Gotha. His laws were not conceived in the spirit of modern ideas about individual liberty; they forbade secret betrothals, tried to regulate dress, and extended even to the stable, kitchen, and cellar. Nevertheless, his regulations promoted agriculture, commerce, learning, and art. His palace of Friedenstein in Gotha was rebuilt, and its collections owe their origin to Ernest; the library became one of the largest in Germany. Churches were built and by his Schulmethodus of 1642 Ernest became the father of the present grammar-school. It was a popular saying that his peasants were better instructed than the townsmen and nobles elsewhere, and at his death, it was said, no one in his land was unable to read and write. He made the gymnasium in Gotha a model school which attracted pupils not only from all German lands, but from Sweden, Russia, Poland, and Hungary. In like manner he fostered the University of Jena, increasing its funds and regulating its studies, with too much emphasis on the religious side. The same fault is attached to his efforts in church affairs, which won him the nickname of \\"Praying Ernest\\"; but an excuse is found in the fearful demoralization caused by the war. The Bible was his own everyday book and he strove unceasingly to make his people religious after a strict Lutheran pattern. Religious instruction, consisting in catechetical exercises without Bible history, was kept up even to advanced years and not unnaturally the rigid compulsion in some cases defeated its purpose. Ernest's system has maintained itself surprisingly; it still exists legally though somewhat modified or disregarded. His efforts for Protestantism were not confined to his own land. He interceded with the emperor for his Austrian co-religionists, and wanted to establish them in Gotha. He became a benefactor to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Germans in Moscow and entered into friendly relations with the tsar. He even sent an embassy to introduce Lutheranism into Abyssinia, but this failed to accomplish its purpose. His rule of his family is a miniature of his government of his land; the strictest discipline prevailed at court. Its life was simple and industrious, regulated on all sides by religious exercises. Rules were added to rules. No detail was overlooked which could promote the spiritual and physical development of his children, and their religious education was carried to excess. Nevertheless, his children all turned out well and Ernest died with the name of \\"father and savior of his people.\\" Oliver Cromwell counted him among the most sagacious of princes; in him was embodied \\"the idea of the Protestant patriarchal prince and of a Christian governor of State and Church truly caring for both.\\" Family and children In Altenburg on 24 October 1636, Ernst married his cousin Elisabeth Sophie of Saxe-Altenburg. As a result of this marriage Saxe- Gotha and Saxe-Altenburg were unified, when the last duke of the line (Elisabeth's cousin) died childless in 1672.

At the 2006 census, its population was 218,737, in 57,551 families. Khomeyni Shahr is now part of the Isfahan Metropolitan area. The town was originally known as Sedeh. In the 1930s, the name was changed to Homayunshahr. After the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the city was renamed again to Khomeyni Shahr (meaning \\"City of Khomeyni\\"), in honor of Ayatollah Khomeini. Locals have continued to refer to the city as Sedeh. There has been an ongoing effort to rename back the city's name to its historical one Mehrbin ().  History  It is commonly believed that the original name, Sedeh (Persian: ), is derived from Seh-dedge, meaning \\"three castles\\" in Persian, (\\"dedge\\" () means \\"castle\\"), and is linked to the formation of the town by the growth of three neighbouring castles. The three main castles of Kohan Dedge, Gar Dedge, and .... Dedge (locally pronounced kohan dedge, gar dar and ...). It is commonly believed that Seh-dedge was a Sassanian military base and an old fireplace (atash gah) based on top of the mountain near the town. The three main villages of Khouzan (locally pronounced Khizoon), Foroushan (the origin of Foroushan was Parishan (pari (angel) + voshan (face))), and Varnosfaderan (Venesfohoon) remain identifiable parts of the city. However, there are in fact five former villages forming identifiable parts of the town. This has led to the argument that the name may be linked to the ancient Persian festival of Sadeh. The name change to Homayunshahr took place during the reign of Reza Shah Pahlavi. The name literally means \\"auspicious or august city\\", but Homayun was also a title of the Shah and so the name was seen as being linked with the Pahlavi dynasty. Thus, after the revolution of 1979, the city was renamed again, this time to be called after Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution.  Khomeini Shahr antiquity  Many of the historical events of Khomeini Shahr are influenced by the events that took place in Isfahan. However, the historical antiquity of this region dates back to the Sassanid era, the ancient fortress which is located on the way to Isfahan, seems to have been the capital of the Sassanids. In the Islamic era, this area was also very important, and the existence of a large Grand Mosque in Khozan Alley shows that it was a city in the past. Because the Grand Mosque is an urban feature and the villages do not have it. In Mohammad Afghan's invasion of Isfahan, the people of the century bravely persevered and captured a large number of Mahmoud's troops. The distance between the city (Khomeini Shahr) and Isfahan is 8 km. Khomeini Shahr city is located in the west of Isfahan province and is limited to Borkhar and Maymeh cities in the north, Falavarjan city in the south, Isfahan city in the east and Najafabad city in the west. This city is one of the most pleasant and most prosperous areas of Isfahan province. Its soil is irrigated by the Zayandehrud River and all its streams are full of water. In addition, it has important caries, which has caused three-quarters of the city's soil to be large orchards and a quarter of its fields. The material of \\"Qomish\\" passes through the southern lands of the city, and because it is connected to the springs at the point of separation from the river, its water never runs out. Fruits and ground products such as wheat, barley, cucumbers, melons, legumes, tobacco are grown in the city, and some varieties such as spring melons, pavilions, grapes, cherries, Nasrabad and Gortan are famous and similar in other places. Not found. Its climate is temperate and dry. The highest temperature in summer is 39 degrees above zero and the lowest in winter is 8 degrees below zero. Since Khomeini Shahr was formed from three dozen names called Khozan, Forosh and Vernosfadran, it was called (three ten) which was gradually renamed Homayounshahr and then Khomeini Shahr due to the expansion of these villages and their connection to each other.  Sections and neighborhoods  There are several antiquities in the city. Vernosfadran (including the neighborhoods of Garsele, Zaghabad or Zoga, Balugan, Garder and Kushkbaj) Khozan (including the neighborhoods of Ko Barz or Ko Bazm or Coin Al-Zar, Fatehabad, Jafarabad, Darb-e Mahkameh, Kohandj and Shamsabad) Vendors (including the neighborhoods of Dimitrian, the upper door of the dead, Javadiyeh or Uncle Fazlgah, the door of Seyed, the castle of Agha, Ladreh, the new neighborhood, Sarpol) Andoan Adrian Heristan Qartman (Kurtman) Vaziche Joy Abad ⁄©ŸÜÿØŸÜÿØ⁄ò Dastgerd Qadadeh Esfriz What Tiranchi Pavilion Asgharabad Amirieh Castle New sections include: Manzaria town Seven hundred devices Qaemiyeh (former slaughterhouse) guards University of Technology staff dormitory (Baqer al-Ulum) Among the industrial and workshop sections, the following can be mentioned: Dushakh Industrial Zone Kokuchi area (small mountain) Electronic Industrial Town  University  The Islamic Azad University of Khomeinyshahr is one of the most promising Iranian universities in various fields, especially in mechanical Isfahan University of Technology (IUT) is ranked as one of the best universities in Iran.

It stars Flora Chan Èô≥ÊÖßÁèä, Damian Lau ÂäâÊùæ‰ªÅ, Kevin Cheng ÈÑ≠ÂòâÁ©é and Niki Chow Âë®È∫óÊ∑á. Synopsis Early in the story, Leung Pak-yeen (Damian Lau) was in a dispute with his wife (Mary Hon) and they argued on a building rooftop. The wife fell from the building top and the murder was witnessed by one of the construction workers. The worker turned out to be an illegal immigrant in Hong Kong. He spent a great deal of time escaping Leung Pak-yeen and just about anyone who questioned his identity. Soon the daughter of Leung Pak-yeen, Ceci (Niki Chow), spotted a newspaper with the construction worker. She attempted to track him down and failed numerous times. Upon cleaning up her dead mother's house, she discovered a diary written before her death. The book content was told as part of a flashback, which spoke about Leung Pak-yeen's true past. Apparently he went to mainland China to do illegal trafficking a long time ago for his business. He set up and sold out one of his partners to gain a bigger share of the trafficking profit. His partner was killed under the custody of the mainland police, and never made it out alive. Ken (Kevin Cheng), the son of the partner, grew up thinking his father was just neglecting him. His girlfriend, Ceci, warned him about her findings in the diary, including her father's murder acts and motives. Ken soon realized his father did not neglect him when he was a child. Instead his father was set up by Leung Pak-yeen during the trafficking and killed. Both of them were motivated to track down the construction worker who witnessed at least one of the crimes. Ken, Ceci, the construction worker would all end up in Hong Kong's High court in an attempt to put Leung Pak-yeen behind bars. Under oath, the construction worker would testify. Because of his poor credibility as an illegal immigrant and weak testimony going up against a top-notch lawyer, the case was lost. The father who was essentially responsible for the murder of two people earlier was now set free. The story then shifted to the young couple with Ken and Ceci trying to put the event behind them and restart their life. Niki went from this immature girl to a more mature woman who was consumed with worries, especially with her murderous father set free. Tiffany (Flora Chan) was married to the murderous father, Leung Pak-yeen, and had a baby. To continue the feud, the father, Leung Pak-yeen would compete with Ken in their jade business. Eventually Ken would gain the upper hand, and the father was forced once again to do trafficking to sustain his business. His wife, Tiffany, urged him not to take this dangerous route again. He claimed it was necessary for the survival of his business and ventured off to Shanghai. He got lucky and escaped Shanghai police. Returning to Hong Kong, his wife now mistrusts him. He has basically been hiding too many secrets about murders, trafficking, and many side stories involving sacrificing friendships for money. To force her trust, Leung Pak-yeen kidnapped the baby to forcefully reconnect the relationship. Tiffany would become miserable as she tried to play games to regain her baby back. In an effort to chase the baby down, CeCi was violently hit by an SUV. After numerous twists, turns, lies and deceptions Leung Pak-yeen would give up, committing a suicide. With the exception of his wife, everyone in his whole family died. Including Ceci who was unconscious from the accident, but then died after the second operation. Throughout the story, Tiffany was carrying a cursed jade necklace, which shared a similar fate with its previous owner. In the end, Ken, (Kevin Cheng) still manages to continue on with life, and has the same dream every night of marrying Ceci, (Niki Chow) Cast * Flora Chan as Mok Hei-yee /Tiffany (Ëé´Â∏åÂÖí) * Damian Lau as Leung Pak-yin (Ê¢ÅÊüèË®Ä) * Kevin Cheng as Leung Ka-ming /Ken (Ê¢ÅÂÆ∂Êòé) * Niki Chow as Leung Wing-Sze /Ceci (Ê¢ÅË©†ÊÄù) * Mary Hon * Maggie Shiu as Yip Suk-gwun /Ivy (ËëâÊ∑ëÂêõ) * Ha Ping as Suen Yeen-chou (Â≠´ÁáïÁßã) * Ha Yu as Mok Sai-long (Ëé´‰∏ñÈæç) * Michelle Yip as Suen Yeen-chou (Younger Years) * Michael Tong as Mok Sai-long (Younger Years) * Stephen Au as Leung Pak-git (Ê¢ÅÊüèÂÇë) * Chan Hoi Yee as Oi Siu- kei (ÂçÄÂ∞èÁê™) * Yee Zhi Yuen as Lau Tzi-kerng (ÂäâÂøóÂº∑) * Hawick Lau as Mok Hei Man (Ëé´Â∏åÊñá) * Akina Hong * Rebecca Chan * Hui Siu Hung External links *SPCNET - Hard Fate TVB dramas 2004 Hong Kong television series debuts 2004 Hong Kong television series endings ","title":"Hard Fate"},{"id":"9589678","text":"Homa Darabi (; 1940-1994) was an Iranian pediatrician, academic and political activist affiliated with the Nation Party of Iran.

Hiking on the mountains is very popular, and provides fantastic views of the region. Pronounced in English approximately like /eech-mell-er/, the town has developed rapidly over the last 15 years, with accommodation and other tourist facilities mushrooming across the formerly sleepy fishermen's and sponge divers' village. As a side to the increasing tourism, this resort in the Turkish Riviera is seeing an increasing amount of watersports facilities, such as scuba diving and waterskiing. The town developed on the back of tourists seeking a quieter alternative to the overdeveloped city of Marmaris. Nightlife is rather scarce in ƒ∞√ßmeler. Restaurants and pubs usually feature live music, shows and acts until around midnight. After this time, the only entertainment available is generally the nightclubs. Many tourists enjoy the variation in entertainment, starting in the restaurants in the early evening, moving onto the pubs and mini-discos until midnight and then followed by the nightclubs anywhere up to 4am. Directly across the bay from ƒ∞√ßmeler is the busy port of Marmaris, which also gives its name to the region. Marmara (historically merme) is the name for marble, which Turkey has in abundance.

He matriculated at St Salvator's College, University of St Andrews on 26 November 1540. He was a supporter of the Scottish Reformation of 1560, and in 1567 became Minister of Muckhart parish, Clackmannanshire. After the forfeiture of Bishop Robert Crichton in 1571, Paton became Bishop of Dunkeld. This seems to have been arranged for him by Archibald Campbell, 5th Earl of Argyll, to whom Paton handed over his farm at Muckhart Mill in addition to promising the earl a share of episcopal revenue. This later brought him into disrepute with the Protestant General Assembly, as did his failure to proceed against the allegedly Catholic John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl. Paton failed to defend himself satisfactorily, and in 1576 a decree was made depriving him of his bishopric. Paton resisted his forfeiture, but by 1584 had been replaced by the now reinstated Robert Crichton. Paton returned to his old parish of Muckhart, though not in the capacity of a minister. He died there on 20 July 1596. He is known to have had four children, including Archibald Paton, who served in Dunkeld Cathedral during his father's episcopate. References * Henderson, T.

Muka≈ôovsk√Ω (1881) Statue in Venice Niccol√≤ Tommaseo (; 9 October 1802 ‚Äì 1 May 1874) was an Italian linguist, journalist and essayist, the editor of a Dizionario della Lingua Italiana in eight volumes (1861‚Äì74), of a dictionary of synonyms (1830) and other works. He is considered a precursor of the Italian irredentism. Biography Born at Sebenico (≈†ibenik), which was in quick succession under Venetian, Napoleonic and Habsburg domain, Tommaseo was culturally and ethnically Italian, but expressed also genuine interest in the Illyrian popular culture. His education, pursued at Split/Spalato, was a humanistic one with a sound Catholic basis. He moved to Italy to graduate in law at the University of Padua in 1822. He then spent several years as a journalist roving between Padua and Milan, where he came in contact with Alessandro Manzoni and Antonio Rosmini-Serbati. In this period of life he began his collaboration in the Antologia of Giovan Pietro Vieusseux, founder of the Gabinetto Vieusseux, the reading room and intellectual centre in Florence. He also corresponded with Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° of Montenegro and Medo Puciƒá. Nikola Tomazeo (Niccol√≤ Tommaseo) is regarded as part of both the Italian and Serbian literary corpus according to critic Jovan Skerliƒá who included him in his Istorja nove srpske knji≈æevnosti (1914).https://www.antikvarne- knjige.com/elektronskeknjige/book/jovan-skerlic--istorija-nove-srpske- knjizevnosti-1914-pdf Having moved to Florence in the autumn of 1827, he became a friend of Gino Capponi and soon became one of the important voices in the Antologia. In 1830 appeared the Nuovo Dizionario de' Sinonimi della lingua italiana which confirmed his public reputation. Following the protests of the Austrian government against an article defending the Greek revolution that resulted in the closure of the journal in which he was publishing, he sought voluntary exile in Paris. During his years in Paris he published the political work Dell'Italia (1835), the volume of verses, Confessioni (1836), the historical fiction Il Duca di Atene (1837), a commentary on the Divine Comedy (1837), and his Memorie Poetiche (1838). From Paris he moved to Corsica, where with the support and collaboration of the magistrate and essayist of Bastia, Salvatore Viale, he worked to compile the copious Italian oral traditions of the island, where he claimed to find the purest Italian dialect in the book Canti populari: Canti Corsi. In Venice he published the first two installments of his novel Fede e Bellezza, praised today as an early example of the psychological novel. His anthology of popular songs, Canti popolari italiani, corsi, illirici, greci (1841) and the Scintille/Iskrice (1842) are rare examples of a metropolitan culture above nationalism. In 1847 he returned to the journalistic forum, and as an outspoken defender of liberalizing laws for a wholly free press was arrested, causing a scandal: he was freed during the liberal revolution headed by Daniele Manin and assumed responsibilities in the briefly renewed Venetian Republic, which cost him an exile (because accused of Italian irredentist) in Corf√π when Habsburg control was reasserted over Lombardy-Venetia. In Corf√π, with his eyesight failing, he nevertheless managed to write numerous essays, among which, in Rome et le monde (written in French), he declared, as a good Catholic, the necessity of the Church's relinquishing temporal power in the Papal States. In this time he abandoned his hopes for the \\"moderate\\" road to the Unification of Italy through the House of Savoy. In 1854, with his sight ever more compromised, he moved to Turin (1854), then once again to Florence (1859), where he took a villa at Settignano. His opposition to the House of Savoy made him refuse all honours, including a seat in the Senate. In his final years he devoted himself to the weighty dictionary of the Italian language, in seven volumes, which was completed in 1874, after his death.

Botero was elected as a member of the Colombian Congress for the Colombian Liberal Party. His father is the internationally recognized painter and sculptor Fernando Botero. Botero Zea was convicted of financial issues associated with the Samper campaign's having accepted money from the Cali Cartel and served nearly three years in prison. He lost an appeal in 2007 on a second charge and is staying in Mexico, where his citizenship prevents him from being extradited. Early life and education Born in Mexico City, Fernando Botero Zea is the first son of the renowned artist Fernando Botero and Gloria Zea, who later became the Colombian Minister of Culture. His parents divorced in 1960, and each remarried. He has a sister Lina and brother Juan Carlos. Botero graduated from the University of the Andes, Colombia with a degree in Political Science. In the 1980s, he attended Harvard University's Business School and Kennedy School of Government, where he obtained joint master's degrees in Business and Public Administration. Some of Botero's renowned friends include prominent author and business leader Lawrence Au as well as New York University student Joelle Au. Career Botero was elected to Bogota's City Council. Later he was elected as a Liberal Party member of the Colombian Congress. In 1993‚Äì1994, he worked as a campaign manager in Ernesto Samper's run for president. After Samper was elected, he appointed Botero as Minister of Defense. While in that role, Botero was charged with financial improprieties due to poor handling of a contract to import a large shipment of assault rifles from Israel. Campaign scandal Shortly after Samper's presidential victory, Andr√©s Pastrana, Samper's opponent and future successor, accused Samper of having received campaign donations from the Cali Cartel, in the amount of $6 million US dollars. The Attorney General of Colombia, Alfonso Valdivieso Sarmiento, personally led the investigation. Valdivieso is a cousin of the late Luis Carlos Gal√°n, a charismatic presidential candidate assassinated in 1989 by the Medell√≠n Cartel for his political views. Gal√°n favoured the extradition of drug dealers to the United States for prosecution. Valdivieso's investigation revealed connections between the Cali drug cartel and top figures of Colombian society, including politicians, journalists, athletes, army and police officers, and artists, among others. As a result, numerous politicians and top members of the government were indicted. Botero was arrested in connection with the investigation and was charged with conspiracy to gain wealth illicitly. On , Botero was convicted and sentenced to 5 years and 3 months in jail for illicit wealth gain in favour of third parties. He served 30 months and was released on . In 2002, Botero was charged with the theft of more than 800 million pesos from Samper's presidential campaign. He invested the money in a farm property in Tabio, a town 20 km north of Bogot√°. The national prosecutor sentenced Botero to 36 months in jail, but Botero won an appeal before a Bogota judge. In 2003, the High Tribunal of Bogot√° confirmed the charges, and Botero appealed the decision. In January 2007, the Supreme Court of Justice confirmed the Tribunal verdict. Expatriation Botero is currently living in Mexico. He became a Mexican citizen, and the country does not extradite its nationals. In 2009, he affirmed that he would stay in Mexico and not return to Colombia. Personal life Botero is married to Mar√≠a In√©s Londo√±o Reyes, daughter of Fernando Londo√±o Henao (es), and they have three daughters.

The party, whose long-time leader is Gavino Sale, supports the establishment of a \\"Republic of Sardinia\\" and its independence from Italy. History=Early years The party emerged in 2001‚Äì2002 by the merger of Su Cuncordu, a separatist platform animated by three Sardinian intellectuals living in Rome (Franciscu Sedda, Frantziscu Sanna and Franciscu Pala), and a splinter group from Sardinia Nation (SN) led by Gavino Sale. The latter and his followers left SN because of its alliance with the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az), which did not support independentism fully at the time and was engaged in alliances with Italian parties. Electoral successes As soon as in 2004 (when Sale won 1.9% of the vote in the regional election) iRS absorbed virtually all the voters of Sardinia Nation, thanks to the charismatic leadership of Sale, a more coherent and intransigent secessionist platform and a more centrist political position. In the 2006 general election iRS won 1.1% of the vote in Sardinia, while it chose to boycott the 2008 general election in order not to be partner in crime with the Italian political system. At the 2009 regional election Gavino Sale won 3.1% of the vote (4.2% in the Province of Oristano and 3.3% in the Province of Sassari, where the party had its early strongholds) as candidate for President of the Region, while the party stopped at 2.1%, short of the 3% threshold needed to enter the Regional Council. At the 2010 provincial elections iRS candidates for president gained more than 2% of the vote in all the provinces and the party obtained its best result ever. Notably, Sale won 6.5% in Sassari (party list: 5.8%), Sebastian Madau 5.9% (5.8%) in Oristano and Salvatore Bussa 4.4% (4.2%) in Nuoro.Ministry of the Interior Internal splits In January 2010, during a party congress, Ornella Demuru was elected secretary of the party, replacing Gavino Sale, who was elected president, and representing a power shift within the party from the old guard and younger activists. Notwithstanding the good results of the party at the 2010 provincial elections, the relation between Sale and Demuru was tense from the beginning. In October Demuru threatened her resignation and reclaimed more internal democracy within the party. Sale, for his part, replied that he rejected an intellectual-chic party as that imagined by Demuru and her supporters, who included the three founding members Franciscu Sedda, Frantziscu Sanna and Franciscu Pala, plus younger intellectuals such as Michela Murgia. During a grassroots' meeting on 12 December, Sale accused Demuru and the young guard of conspiring against him and, after this accusation, he was expelled from the party by the executive composed by Demuru's loyalists. By the end of December Sale was sure to have won the power struggle and suspended the members of the executive who had expelled him. A few days later, on 2 January 2010, the group of Demuru and Sedda finally decided to leave the party and launch a \\"Republican Constituent Assembly\\" (Sa Costituente Repubricana). In February the new party took the name of Project Republic of Sardinia (ProgReS). Moreover, on 10 February, Claudia Zuncheddu left the Red Moors, party of which she was president, and joined iRS. Zuncheddu was a regional councillor, thus the party was represented in the Council for the first time. In May 2011 Zuncheddu ran for Mayor of Cagliari and gained a mere 2.4% of the vote, but better than Demuru, who stopped at 0.4%.http://elezionistorico.interno.it/index.php?tpel=G&dtel;=15/05/2011&tpa;=I&tpe;=C&lev0;=0&levsut0;=0&lev1;=20&levsut1;=1&lev2;=17&levsut2;=2&lev3;=90&levsut3;=3&ne1;=20&ne2;=17&ne3;=170090&es0;=S&es1;=S&es2;=S&es3;=N&ms;=S Zunchedda would later form her own party, Free Sardinia.http://www.claudiazuncheddu.net/575-sardigna-libera-lettera-agli- amici Alliance with the centre-left In the 2014 regional election the party chose to join forces with the Italian centre-left for the first time (whose candidate, Francesco Pigliaru, was elected President), instead of forming a coalition with other independentist parties. Consequently, iRS lost much of his electoral support and won a mere 0.8% of the vote (compared to the ProgReS-led coalition's 10.8%), but, thanks to the alliance, Sale was elected to the Regional Council.http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2014/elezioni/regionali/sardegna.htmlhttp://www.consregsardegna.it/XVLegislatura/Consiglieri/Sale_Gavino.asp It was the first time that the iRs was able to elect a regional councillor on its own, but it lasted just a year: in July 2015 the Italian Council of State invalidated the election of four councillors, including Sale.http://lanuovasardegna.gelocal.it/regione/2015/07/21/news/il-consiglio- di-stato-rivoluziona-l-assemblea-regionale-1.11812294 Leadership *President: Gavino Sale (2010‚Äìpresent) *Secretary: Gavino Sale (2002‚Äì2010), Ornella Demuru (2010‚Äì2011), vacant (2011‚Äìpresent) See also * Sardinian nationalism ReferencesExternal links *Official website Political parties in Sardinia Sardinian nationalist parties Separatism in Italy Secessionist organizations in Europe Political parties established in 2002 ","title":"Independence Republic of Sardinia"},{"id":"9589843","text":"KSEH is a Spanish-language Soft AC radio station branded as La Suavecita 94.5.

Kidnapping and murder Markowitz lived in West Hills, Los Angeles, with his parents, Jeff and Susan Markowitz. A feud between Nicholas' older half-brother, Ben Markowitz, and Jesse James Hollywood, a mid-level drug dealer, began over an alleged $1,200 debt owed to Hollywood by Ben Markowitz. On August 6, 2000, Hollywood and his friends Jesse Rugge and William Skidmore decided to confront Ben. On their way to see him, they saw Nicholas walking on the side of the road and decided to abduct him and hold him for ransom. After they chased, assaulted, and abducted Nicholas, they forced him into a white van and sped off. Hollywood and his gang then picked up Brian Affronti (another one of Hollywood's friends) and drove to Santa Barbara, California. When Hollywood and his gang informed Nicholas why they were holding him, he allegedly panicked. His captors then plied him with drugs and alcohol. Hollywood left Rugge to watch Nicholas and returned to Los Angeles with the apparent intention of speaking with Ben. While in Santa Barbara, Nicholas met Rugge's friends Graham Pressley, Natasha Adams-Young, and Kelly Carpenter and attended various house parties with them. Reports indicate that many witnesses, parents and teens alike, saw Nicholas with the others, but did not realize anything was amiss. Also, many people knew Nicholas had been kidnapped, but did not notify the police because Nicholas appeared to be safe and having fun. After Hollywood told Rugge that Nicholas would be returning home, Rugge and several others held a party at the Lemon Tree Inn. However, after learning of the legal ramifications he could face for kidnapping, Hollywood called Ryan Hoyt, another member of his gang who owed him money. Hollywood gave Hoyt a TEC-9 semi-automatic handgun and directed him to kill Nicholas as a way of paying off his debt. A decision was made to commit the murder on the Lizard‚Äôs Mouth trail in the Santa Ynez Mountains north of Goleta, California. After the party, Hoyt, Rugge, and Pressley drove Nicholas to the mountains and walked up a trail to a grave dug by Pressley earlier that night. Rugge bound Nicholas's hands behind his back and covered his mouth with duct tape. Hoyt then hit Nicholas in the back of the head with a shovel, knocking him into the grave, and shot him nine times with Hollywood's handgun. The group attempted to hide the gun by placing it between the legs of Nicholas's body and covering the body with dirt and branches. However, the grave was shallow, and was located near a popular trail. Nicholas's body was found on August 12, 2000. Hoyt, Rugge, Skidmore, and Pressley were all arrested. Hollywood went on the run, but was eventually captured in a small town near Rio de Janeiro five years later. Legal proceedings Several civil and criminal court proceedings have arisen from the Markowitz murder. Those proceedings include: *Ryan Hoyt, aged 20 at the time of the murder, was charged with the first-degree murder of Markowitz. He was convicted on November 21, 2001 and sentenced to death on December 9, 2001. *Jesse Rugge, aged 20 at the time of the murder, was charged with aiding in the kidnap and murder of Nicholas Markowitz. He was convicted in 2002 of aggravated kidnapping for ransom or extortion with special circumstances, but was acquitted on the murder charge. He was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after seven years. Parole was denied in 2006. After serving 11 years in prison Rugge was granted parole, and released from prison on October 24, 2013. *William Skidmore, aged 20 at the time of the murder, was charged with kidnapping and robbery. In September 2002, he was sentenced to nine years in a state prison as part of a plea bargain. Skidmore was released in April 2009. *Graham Pressley, aged 17 at the time of the murder, dug Markowitz's grave. He was tried twice. In July 2002, he was acquitted of kidnapping; the jury hung on the murder charge. In October 2002, he was retried on the murder charge and was convicted of second-degree murder. Pressley was incarcerated at a California Youth Authority facility until shortly before his 25th birthday in 2007. He has since been released. *Jesse James Hollywood, aged 20 at the time of the murder, was not present at the scene of the crime; however, he was later found to have ordered the murder. After Markowitz was killed, Hollywood immediately went on the run. He was arrested in Saquarema, Brazil after being on the FBI's most wanted list for five years. In 2009, Hollywood was convicted of kidnapping and first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. *In 2003, the Markowitz family won an $11.2 million civil lawsuit against the kidnappers and the murderers, along with other defendants such as the family friend whose van was used in the kidnapping and the owners of several homes where Nicholas was held against his will. In popular culture The feature film Alpha Dog, based on the events leading up to the murder of Nicholas Markowitz and directed by Nick Cassavetes, was released in 2006. In the film, the character modeled after Markowitz was named Zack Mazursky. The role was played by Anton Yelchin.

There are many kinds of kabsa and each kind has a uniqueness about it. Pre-mixed kabsa spices are now available under several brand names. These reduce preparation time, but may have a flavor distinct from traditional kabsa. The spices used in kabsa are largely responsible for its taste; these are generally black pepper, cloves, cardamom, saffron, cinnamon, black lime, bay leaves and nutmeg. The main ingredient that accompanies the spices is the meat. The meats used are usually chicken, goat, lamb, camel, beef, fish or shrimp. In chicken machb≈´s, a whole chicken is used. The spices, rice and meat may be augmented with almonds, pine nuts, peanuts, onions and sultanas. The dish can be garnished with ·∏•ash≈´ () and served hot with daqq≈´s (), which is a home-made Arabic tomato sauce. Methods of cooking Arab countries in the Persian Gulf. Meat for kabsa can be cooked in various ways. A popular way of preparing meat is called mandi. This is an ancient technique that originates in Yemen, whereby meat is barbecued in a deep hole in the ground that is covered while the meat cooks. Another way of preparing and serving meat for kabsa is mathbi, where seasoned meat is grilled on flat stones that are placed on top of burning embers.

He is best known as a member of the trio 2nd Chapter of Acts, in which he sang and performed with his sisters Annie Herring and Nellie (Ward) Greisen. During his musical career with the 2nd Chapter of Acts from 1973 to 1988, he also recorded solo albums. Early history Matthew's music and ministry was in no small part forged from personal family tragedy. In 1968 his mother, Elizabeth Ward, died of a brain tumor; two years later his father, Walter, died of leukemia leaving him and his sister, Nelly orphaned. The Ward siblings all decided that Matthew's older sister, Annie, and her new husband record producer Buck Herring should take in the two younger Ward siblings. Matthew's older sister, Annie was a self-styled (and self-taught) singer and song writer who wrote and played her songs around the family piano. Matthew and sister, Nelly would often join in as Annie played and eventually they developed extremely tight and intricate harmonies.Matthew Ward: 2nd Chapter Of Acts and Pioneering CCMThe Frame Never Outdid the Picture: The 2nd Chapter of Acts Story As the trio gradually started singing for local coffee houses and small gatherings, they eventually gained the notice of Pat Boone who arranged a contract to record and release two singles with MGM, \\"Jesus Is\\" (1972), recorded on Matthew's 13th birthday, and \\"I'm So Happy\\" (1973). The fledgling trio also came to the attention of 1960s folk singer Barry McGuire, who had recently become a Christian and was preparing to record his first Christian music album, produced by Buck Herring. The siblings provided background vocals for Seeds and McGuire's 1974 follow-up Lighten Up. Recent history Following his career with the 2nd Chapter of Acts, Matthew Ward has recorded many more solo works and also works in the music industry as a background & jingle vocalist. He has worked with other such artists as Leslie Phillips, Donna Summer, LeAnn Rimes, Randy Stonehill, Sandi Patti, Dennis Jernigan, Jordin Sparks and many others.

It is 250 km from Mumbai. The 11th-century Jain Caves, Renuka devi mandir, Chandreshwar temple and Rangmahal are in Chandwad. Chandwad is a tehsil in Malegaon subdivision of Nashik district in Maharashtra, India. It is the site of Ahilyadevi Holkar's Rangmahal (fort). It is surrounded by mountains and resembles a hill station. The population is around 20000. Chandwad is also well known for its 11th-century jain caves dedicated to Tirthankara Chandraprabh situated near a hill. It has special importance for Jains. Jain people living in Chandwad city believe that the place was once the famous and a big center of Jainism. History Rishi Parashurama was asked by his father Jamadagni (known for his anger) to kill his mother Renuka. Parashurama, being an obedient son, separated her head from body. The head landed in Chandwad while the body fell near Mahur. There is a scenic temple of Goddess Renuka on the outskirts of Chandwad. Similarly there are temples of Ganesh, Mahadeo (Chandreshwar) and Goddess Kalika, the last two being on mountains. Chandreshwar Mahadev Temple was built by King Chandradev about 2100 years ago and worshiped Lord Shiva. The Shiva temple Chandreshwar is located on the north-east mountain. There were seven 'Shaiv Gosavis' looking after the temple as well performing the rituals at the temple. After the death, their bodies were buried near a lake on the mountain of Chandreshwaras per Shaiv Gosavi tradition at that time. Later on their tombs were termed as SaptRishi by local people. Near that lake 'Ganesh Taka' is another source of water. Story of Vikramaditya's SadeSati (Period of Saturn) is associated with Chandwad. In his bad time he wandered eshere and there in the jungles of Tamolindapur (Chandwad) and later on he came in the town after a long period so it was difficult to prove his kingship to anyone. He started doing job at a grocery shop but the shopkeeper and his daughter blamed him of stealing the jewellery. He got punished as he failed to prove his innocence. His hands and legs were broken but he got job at an oil extractor's workplace where he has to keep the bull moving on the extractor mechanism. One day he was singing Song of 'Deepak Raga' and due to his songs all the lamps turned on. The daughter of Chandradev had a resolution to marry a man who knows 'Deepak Raga' and then he revealed his identity and married the daughter of King Chandradev. Rangmahal, a fortress-like structure was built by Queen Ahilyadevi Holkar, a very pious lady, devotee of Lord Shiva, who did charity and service in building Shiva temples and facilities for the public. She constructed a lake for the people in Chandwad.

The main attraction of the city are Rangmahal (fort built by Ahilyadevi Holkar) and an adjoining well. The Rangmahal now houses many government offices, and a government school. Mrs. Holkar also built a famous network of subways from her palace to different popular locations like Goddess Renuka Temple and a well near Vinchur. They were supposed to be used as safe passage under enemy attack. Mrs. Ahilyadevi Holkar made a road from Indore (Indur in Marathi) to Trimbakeshwar, which is now part of NH-3. The Holkars were appointed as key Jahagirdaar by the Peshwas. The road was an important trade and travel link between Indore to Trimbakeshwar, with onward link to Pune originating from Malegaon City. The town boasts cosmopolitan culture, and amity. Ganeshotsav is an important festival for the town, and is celebrated at the town level. The town had many handlooms, which vanished after 1970. The state highway from Vinchur (district Nashik) to Prakasha (district Dhule) crosses NH-3 in this town. The other state highway originates from Chandwad to Manmad and further to Nandgaon. This town acts as a gateway for traffic from the north part of Nashik district to Ahmadnagar and Aurangabad, and especially to Manmad Rail station. As a result, the town has significant traffic and allied trade (transport, hotels and garages). Education The SNJb's College Of Engineering is one of the most important educational centres of the town and one of the most famous college in Nashik district. Campus also has a BHMS College, a Pharmacy College and a Polytechnic college.

The works span a wide spectrum of topics concerning Dvaita philosophy in specific and Vedic thought in general. They are commentaries on the Vedas, Upanishads, Bhagavadgita, Brahma Sutras and other works. The list of works are enumerated below.Tattvav√¢da  Commentaries on the Bhagavad Gita  Madhva, of the view that the Gita is as much a part of the religious canon as Upanishads or the Vedas, has authored two commentaries on it. His first work, Gita Bhashya is expositional while the latter, Gita Tatparya, is polemical in nature. According to Madhva, the Gita contains the distillation of the ideas expressed in the Upanishads and the Pancharatra, hence a vital part of the Vedanta tradition. Gita Bhashya This preliminary commentary on the Gita is the earliest example of Madhva's style which is characterised by its terseness and brevity. He quotes from a variety of rare sources and scriptures and is not an exhaustive commentary on the Gita as it concentrates only on a few verses. Madhva establishes the importance of Karma Yoga or the path of duty, which had been previously relegated to a footnote in Advaita. According to Madhva's view, the ultimate knowledge or the Aparoksha Jnana can be attained through a combination of dispassionate discharge of one's duties (Karma Yoga), acquisition of scriptural knowledge (Jnana Yoga) and the unconditional devotion to the higher entity (Bhakti Yoga). Though, according to Madhva, Bhakti represents the final and ultimate step towards transcendence, Karma and Jnana aid in \\"cleansing the consciousness\\" of the spiritual aspirant. He also takes an approach, unique to his time, that the rituals prescribed in the Vedas for rewards are not to be taken literally. He views them as mere objects of attraction for the general population that would subsequently propel them towards deeper meaning underlying the superficial performance of rituals. Gita Tatparya This later work of his marks a stylistic transition from the previous work in that brevity and formality of his other works are replaced by poetry and elegance. To substantiate his views, he quotes from a diverse array of sources including a non-extant text called Brahmatarka, which has led to significant speculations among the scholars (both present and historical) about its authenticity and existence. Gita Tatparya amplifies the claims of the previous work as well as deals with the rival schools of thought, mainly that of Adi Sankara and Bhaskara. Madhva argues in favour of the reality of experiences (as opposed to the illusoriness of the world in Advaita) by basing the validity of a particular experience on the pramanas or \\"channels of knowledge acquisition\\". The pramanas Madhva accepts are pratyeksha (direct perception), anumana (inference) and shabda (testimony) with Sakshi (the internal witness) serving as the ultimate arbiter. Jayatirtha's Nyayadipika serves as a commentary to Gita Tatparya.

The command is a separate military investigative force with investigative autonomy; CID special agents report through the CID chain of command to the USACIDC Commanding General, who reports directly to the Chief of Staff of the Army and the Secretary of the Army. By position, the USACIDC commanding general is also the Army's Provost Marshal General. Overview The command does not charge individuals with crimes; instead, CID investigates allegations and turns official findings over to the appropriate command and legal authority for disposition and adjudication. CID exercises jurisdiction over military personnel who are suspected of offenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as well as civilian personnel when there is probable cause to believe the person has committed an offense under the criminal laws of the United States with a nexus to the U.S. Army. CID special agents may be military personnel (NCOs or warrant officers), or appointed civilian personnel. Within the United States Army, CID has exclusive jurisdiction in the investigation of all serious, felony level crimes with the exception of certain national security crimes such as espionage, treason, and certain aspects of international terrorism. Investigative jurisdiction within the Army of these crimes resides with U.S. Army Counterintelligence (ACI), although joint and parallel investigations can and do happen depending on specific circumstances (most commonly with terrorism investigations). USACIDC was established as a United States Army command in 1971 and is headquartered at Marine Corps Base, Quantico, Virginia. Worldwide, the organization has slightly fewer than 3,000 soldiers and civilians, of whom approximately 900 are special agents. The initialism \\"USACIDC\\" is used to refer to the Army command itself, while criminal investigation personnel and operations are commonly referred to using the shortened initialism \\"CID\\", which has its history in the original Criminal Investigation Division formed during World War I and is still retained today for continuity purposes. History During World War I, General John J. Pershing ordered the creation of a separate organization within the Military Police Corps to prevent and detect crime among the American Expeditionary Force in France. The newly created Criminal Investigation Division (CID) was headed by a division chief who served as the advisor to the Provost Marshal General on all matters relating to criminal investigations. However, operational control of CID still remained with individual provost marshals, and there was no central control of investigative efforts within the organization, resulting in limitations. At the end of the war, the United States Army was reduced in size during the transition to peacetime and the size of CID shrank dramatically. With the onset of World War II in December 1941, the armed forces rapidly swelled in size and the Army once again became a force of millions, and the need for a self-policing law enforcement system rematerialized. However, by early 1942, investigations of crimes committed by military personnel were still considered to be a \\"command function\\" to be conducted by local military police personnel. The Office of The Provost Marshal General felt that the agents in the Investigations Department were not properly trained for criminal investigations, the only investigations taking place at the time being personnel security background investigations for individuals being considered for employment in defense industries. As the Army had expanded, the crime rate had risen, and local commanders did not have the personnel or resources to conduct adequate investigations. By December 1943, the Provost Marshal General was charged with providing staff supervision over all criminal investigations, and a month later in January 1944, the Criminal Investigation Division was reestablished under the Provost Marshal General's Office. The organization exercised supervision over criminal investigation activities, coordinated investigations between commands, dictated plans and policies, and set standards for criminal investigators. After the war, the CID was once again decentralized, with control of criminal investigations transferred to area commands in the 1950s and further down to the installation level in the 1960s. A Department of Defense study in 1964 entitled Project Security Shield made clear that complete recentralization of the Army's criminal investigative effort was needed in order to produce a more efficient and responsive worldwide capability. Beginning in 1965, criminal investigative elements were reorganized into CID groups corresponding to geographical areas in the United States. In 1966, the concept was introduced to units in Europe and the Far East. However, this arrangement did not fully resolve all the coordination problems, and in 1969, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Agency was established to supervise all CID operations worldwide. As the agency did not have command authority, in March 1971, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird directed the Secretary of the Army to form a CID command with command and control authority over all Army-wide CID assets. On 17 September 1971, the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command was established as a major Army command, vested with command and control of all CID activities and resources worldwide. Selection and training Military Special Agent candidates must be currently serving in the active Army or Army Reserve. There are no active Army National Guard CID units. Candidates must be enlisted soldiers who are US citizens, at least 21 years of age, and in the ranks of SPC-SGT or SSG with less than 12 months time in grade, and a graduate of the Basic Leader Course (BLC). Candidates must have had at least two years of military service, but not more than 12, at least one year of military police experience or two years of civilian law enforcement experience and a minimum of 60 college credit hours. Other requirements include (but are not limited to) credit checks, no physical limitation, and have the ability to deploy worldwide, normal color vision, the ability to obtain a Top Secret clearance, a drivers license and no history of mental or emotional disorders. Some requirements may be waived. To qualify for Warrant Officer positions, candidates must be at least a Sergeant/E-5, currently serving as a Special Agent, with 2 years of investigative experience with CID, have a Top Secret clearance and a bachelor's degree (waiverable). Candidates must have also demonstrated leadership potential, management abilities and good communication skills. CID does not employ Commissioned Officers as Special Agents. CID Battalions and Groups are commanded by Commissioned Officers from the Military Police Corps. These officers do not supervise the conduct of criminal investigations. Criminal investigations are conducted by field Special Agents and are typically supervised by senior Special Agents. Military Special Agent candidates initially receive training at the US Army Military Police School (USAMPS) at Fort Leonard Wood where they attend the Apprentice CID Special Agent course. Later, agents may return to USAMPS to attend specialized training in Advanced Crime Scenes, Sexual Assault Investigations, Child Abuse Prevention and Investigative Techniques, Protective Service Training as well as other subjects. Mission CID at a crime scene The primary mission of the CID, according to the organization's website, is to: *Investigate serious felony level crime (murder, rape, kidnapping, child abuse, drug trafficking, weapons smuggling, etc.) *Conduct sensitive and/or serious investigations *Collect, analyze and disseminate criminal intelligence *Conduct protective service operations *Provide forensic laboratory support *Maintain Army criminal records Additionally, CID may perform the following special missions: *Perform logistical security, from manufacturers to soldiers on the battlefield *Develop criminal intelligence to develop countermeasures to combat subversive activities on the battlefield *Criminal investigations to include war crimes and in some cases crimes against coalition forces and host nation personnel *Protective service operations for key personnel on and off the battlefield Organization US Army CID Headquarters, Marine Corps Base, Quantico.

For official photographs, and certain duty assignments, they wear the uniforms, rank and insignia of any other soldier of their respective ranks. The design of the shoulder sleeve insignia has the central star and the lines of latitude and longitude suggesting a globe. Together with the arrowheads, they mark the points of a compass, symbolizing the basic worldwide mission of the command: To perform and exercise centralized command authority, direction and control of Army criminal investigation activities worldwide. Red, white, and blue are the national colors. The CID distinctive unit insignia has a central star symbolizing centralized command. The grid lines allude to the latitude lines of the globe, thus referring to the worldwide activities of the organization. The grid lines also suggest a stylized web, with eight sides representing the original eight geographical regions of the command. The web, a symbol of criminal apprehension, is the result of methodical construction alluding to the scientific methods of criminal investigations. The outer points of the star further symbolize far-reaching authority. Red, white, and blue, are the national colors and gold is symbolic of achievement. As criminal investigators, CID Special Agents typically dress in civilian clothing which range from professional suits, business/casual attire, or comfortable clothing when appropriate for their daily investigative responsibilities. Due to the nature of their work, undercover assignments dictate further variations of attire to support specific undercover mission requirements. When deployed to certain combat environments, and during other special times and circumstances, CID agents wear Army Combat Uniforms, replacing rank insignia with subdued versions of officer \\"U.S.\\" collar brass and sometimes wearing \\"CID\\" brassards on their upper left arms. Firearms CID Special Agents are issued the 9mm Sig Sauer P320 sidearm, designated \\"M18\\" or the Sig Sauer P228, designated \\"M11.\\" For combat environments, Agents are also issued the M4A1 Carbine or shortened version, MK18, for protection missions, a short, lighter version of the M16 Rifle.

It focuses on economic theory, mathematical economics and econometrics. The CEMI was established in 1963 as an institute of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, superseding the Laboratory of Economics and Mathematical Methods which had been founded by Vasily Sergeevich Nemchinov in 1958. In 1964 a branch of the institute was created in Tallinn, and in 1966 a Leningrad branch was established. How CEMI Was Created \\"When the Institute was founded in 1963, is main goal was an \\"introduction on the mathematical methods and computers in the practice of planning, creation of the theory of the optimal control of the national economy\\".Quoted from official website. In fact, the initial founding vision of the Institute was more ambitious. Of six founding research objectives mentioned by Fedorenko in his 1964, three of them directly bore on the \\"development of a unified system of economic information\\", the \\"design and creation of a unified state network of computer centers\\", and \\"Derivation of specialized planning and management systems based on mathematical methods and computer technology.\\" Although its failure has since obscured this history, the Institute was initially meant to be the leading organization charged with creating a nationwide economic information network.Kassel, Simon. Soviet Cybernetics Research: A Preliminary Study of Organizations and Personalities, RAND, Dec. 1971, p. 94-95. Nowadays CEMI's focus has been on the transition period from communism to capitalism in Russia, and on microeconomic models and models of enterprises' behaviour. The so-called System of Optimal Functioning of the Economy (SOFE), with its mathematical planning approach based on methods developed by Leonid Kantorovich and its IT approach, was intensively discussed during Soviet times. It was objected to by some Marxist economists as representatives of the Political Economy, who were afraid that the mathematical formula approach was too close to Western economics, and might lead to Soviet economics converting to Western economics, which also rely on mathematical formulas. CEMI's first director was N.P. Fedorenko. In 1985 he was succeeded by the Russian academic V.L. Makarov, who still directs the institute. Academic N.P. Fedorenko and other Russian scientists have issued many books on SOFE; most of them are in Russian.

Of these, six remained depressions, thirteen peaked as tropical storms, and six reached hurricane strength. There were no major hurricanes this season. Many of the tropical cyclones this season ‚Äì including all six hurricanes ‚Äì formed from Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) disturbances. Eight tropical storms formed in August this year, a record for the most active August in the East Pacific, excluding Virginia. The eight named storms forming in August this year also made it the most tropical storms to ever form in a month in the East Pacific since 1966. However, this record was tied during the 2009 Pacific hurricane season. Because of a lack of Hurricane Hunter data, a majority of the intensity readings from this season were later removed from the best track file. Only one pressure reading from this season ‚Äì a reading taken from Hurricane Pauline on October 29 when it was a tropical depression ‚Äì was left on the best track data, although a pressure of taken from Tropical Storm Simone was used to set its peak intensity. Systems=Tropical Storm Annette Even though the James Lykes noted that an area of disturbed weather south of the Pacific coast of Mexico was poorly organized, it reported south-southwest winds of 50 mph (85 km/h) on June 20. It made landfall and dissipated near Manzanillo on June 22. The satellite that was orbiting over Annette never took a picture with the storm in view since the storm was usually at the edge of the satellite. A computerized mosaic showed a spiral vortex with the center over land, which was unhelpful in tracking the storm because ship reports noted that the circulation was over water. Damage, if any, is not known. Tropical Storm Bonny The first of a large group of tropical cyclones that developed from ITCZ disturbances this season, a low pressure center in the ITCZ rapidly developed late on July 3. Becoming a tropical storm on July 4, the storm received the name Bonny. The newly named storm tracked west-northwest for 24 hours before turning to the north overnight on July 5 into July 6. As a result, winds of were measured on Socorro Island, which was located to the east-northeast of the storm's center. At this time, satellites revealed that cooler sea surface temperatures and stratus inflow were starting to take their toll on Bonny. The storm began a slow dissipation and, by the time a nearby ship reported the status of the weakening storm, the system had already dropped to depression strength with winds. The storm dissipated on July 9. The remnant low of Bonny had no kinetic energy, causing the forecasters to note that it had a ragged appearance on satellite imagery. Tropical Storm Celeste The disturbance that became Celeste was first noticed by the Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center on July 13. The disturbance slowly intensified, becoming a tropical depression on July 14 and reaching storm strength on the next day. The intensity when the system was named was , but in post-season analysis the storm's peak wind speed was downgraded into 50 mph (85 km/h). This difference in intensity was blamed on brightness issues on the photo taken by satellite, making the storm look more powerful than it really was. The storm never strengthened past the 50 mph (85 km/h) peak it had reached when it became a storm. The storm would continue uneventfully until July 17, when stratus inflow was starting to become entrained in the atmospheric circulation and, shortly after peaking, the storm began to weaken after strong inflow of cool air to the northwest. The weakening Celeste became less discernible in recon reports, but the cloud vortex was still well defined. On July 20, the storm was downgraded into a depression and dissipated 24 hours afterward. Tropical Storm Diana While Celeste was weakening, a tropical disturbance associated with the ITCZ first appeared on July 19. After Celeste lost its tropical identity on July 21, the former had strengthened enough to be upgraded to tropical storm strength and was given the name \\"Diana\\". The banding in the center of the upgraded system was obscured by heavy cirrus outflow. The initial intensity set was . The Anco Swan, a ship north of Tropical Storm Diana, indicated that the tropical storm had reached its peak intensity around this time, which was maintained for two days. Then, cool inflow had become elongated in the storm, resulting in weakening. The storm degenerated into a depression on July 24 and continued moving westward. The depression finally dissipated on July 26, well away from land. Tropical Storm Estelle Estelle was a tropical storm that spent most of its life as a depression as a result of a southward shift in trade winds and the ITCZ, which provoked an early weakening and prevented re-intensification. The storm originated in a disturbance associated with the ITCZ. The disturbance had become a tropical depression on July 23 and reached storm strength the next day. The new tropical storm maintain a 50 mph (85 km/h) intensity for only 30 hours, when it weakened back to a depression. The weakened Estelle continued westward, passing into the Central Pacific around July 31. The group that oversaw the Central Pacific at the time ‚Äì the Joint Hurricane Warning Center ‚Äì issued the depression's final advisory on August 1. Tropical Storm Estelle was notable in that it had advisories issued on it in the Central Pacific despite never actually crossing into the area of responsibility. It dissipated at a longitude of 139.6¬∞W, whereas the Central Pacific begins at 140¬∞W. However, last operational advisory centered the storm at 141.6¬∞W. Hurricane Fernanda The trade winds that had resulted in the weakening of Estelle in late July had decreased in early August, allowing a weak disturbance in the ITCZ to organize near Acapulco. By August 5, the disturbance had developed a vortex and advisories were started on the newly formed depression. The depression would continue to strengthen and, after acquiring significant cirrus outflow, was upgraded to tropical storm intensity on August 6. Fernanda continued to develop, despite the proximity of Tropical Storm Gwen, which was to the east-northeast of the center. On August 8, the storm had developed an eye in a tightly wound spiral overcast and became a hurricane while moving westward. Cool inflow began to get trapped in the circulation, causing the hurricane to weaken to a storm on August 9, but due to the hurricane moving over warmer water, it was not enough to begin dissipation alone. The feeder bands, which helped the hurricane to reach its peak intensity, continued to persist over warm water until August 11, when the cirrus cap over Fernanda became uncoupled to the east, thus exposing the west side of the storm. Plane reports showed the hurricane had moved under westerly winds in the troposphere, which resulted in the storm weakening to a depression on August 13. Shower activity from the hurricane continued diminishing until August 14, and, early on August 15, Fernanda dissipated, having never affected land. Tropical Storm Gwen The ITCZ-based depression which developed into Gwen was first noted on August 5 while south of Tehuantepec. Although a ship in the region reported 40 mph (65 km/h) winds and waves, a satellite picture revealed a cloud mass of amorphous quality. Although a little vortex in the region was visible, the system would show little development for 48 hours until, on August 7, stronger rotation and outflow were apparent in satellite imagery. The next day, a ship north of the center reported waves and 35 mph (60 km/h) winds. Data based on satellite images, and the ship report, were enough to upgrade the system to Tropical Storm Gwen. Around this time, the track of the newly named system was being affected by the stronger Fernanda to its west via Fujiwhara effect. Shortly thereafter, satellite photos showed an exposed atmospheric circulation in the northwest section of the storm with cloud cover lagging behind it, and the storm was downgraded to a depression on August 8. The circulation was completely exposed by the next day, and Gwen dissipated. The remnants of Gwen continued to interact with Fernanda until complete dissipation. Tropical Storm Hyacinth The origins of Hyacinth were linked to a cold front that was over Texas on August 11. There was no activity associated with the disturbance until August 16, when a circular overcast broke away from the front. The overcast breaking away was related to a newly formed low, which moved north-northwest while rapidly intensifying, becoming a tropical storm on August 17. Hyacinth continued to move north-northwestward, entering the mouth of the Gulf of California later that day, and a ship reported a barometric pressure of . Another ship report, showing winds of 65 mph (100 km/h), was received at the same time. The storm passed 60 mi (97 km) east of La Paz, Baja California Sur, on August 18, and the next day, it made landfall near Los Mochis, Sinaloa. The clouds associated with the storm were tracked into the southwestern United States, causing showers and thunderstorms over Arizona, New Mexico, and Colorado on August 20. The storm dissipated on August 21. No deaths were reported in connection to Hyacinth, and damage from Mexico is unknown. Tropical Storm Iva While the moisture and clouds associated with Hyacinth moved northward, an area of rain-producing clouds along the ITCZ stretched from the Gulf of Tehuantepec to Clipperton Island. On August 20, two disturbances formed southwest of Mexico, the first was found via satellite imagery and the second was found by ship report. The disturbance further west developed into Tropical Storm Iva while the other disturbance ultimately became Hurricane Joanne. Ship reports on August 21 led to the disturbance to be upgraded into a tropical storm. However, in best track data, Iva was at depression strength throughout this date, becoming a tropical storm on August 22. Winds of up to 35 mph (65 km/h) were recorded north of the center, which had shifted to 13.5¬∞N, 98.5¬∞W. Despite the winds, a satellite photo of the storm showed poor organization. The storm intensified slowly while moving west-northwest at for the next 48 hours. On August 24, the storm passed south of Socorro Island, which reported winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). By this time, the storm was moving northwestward at due to the influence of strengthening Hurricane Joanne. Later on August 24, a picture of Iva and Joanne showed that the cirrus cap over Iva was becoming separated from the circulation. The storm began weakening afterward, weakening to a depression on August 25 after moving over cool sea surface temperatures. The rain clouds associated with the weakening depression moved westward, producing rains for 12 hours until the storm dissipated early on August 26. Despite never making landfall while active, Iva was responsible for driving clouds and moisture inland, causing slight showers on August 26 in the area of Yuma, Arizona, which was away for the center of the storm. After slight rainfall in the morning, a 30% chance of precipitation and the possibility of thunderstorms linked to the remnants was predicted for the rest of the day. Hurricane Joanne The other disturbance associated with the ITCZ that also formed Iva, south of Cabo San Lucas had a central pressure of reported by a ship passing through the center along with calm winds on August 23, with the depression becoming a tropical storm later that day. 18 hours after the report, the cyclone began rapid intensification, with hurricane-force winds being reported before the end of the day, along with another report of a central pressure of , but the storm did not officially reach hurricane strength until August 24. Around this time, the intensification of Joanne became a factor in the northwestward acceleration of Iva. On August 25, the hurricane had weakened to a storm, but on August 26, the storm was thought to have begun to re-intensify due to the presence of an eye on satellite, but a ship nearby reported winds of only and . The storm weakened to a depression later that day, and ultimately dissipated on August 28, its remains being absorbed into the trade winds. Tropical Storm Kathleen Kathleen developed from an ITCZ disturbance that was first noticed on August 23 while south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. The disturbance moved to the west-northwest at . A lack of surface information prevented Hurricane Hunter investigation into the system until August 25, when the disturbance developed into Tropical Storm Kathleen. Reports of heavy rains and winds of 35 mph (65 km/h) were reported by ships 75 mi (120 km) from the center of the storm at this time. Afterward, the storm moved westward, with verification of the intensity of the storm coming from the ship Denby Grange on August 28, which reported eastward winds of 45 mph (75 km/h) and a central pressure of while north of the center. The storm continued to move westward, weakening to a tropical depression on August 29. The depression continued, moving into the Central Pacific late on September 1, ultimately dissipating on September 3. Even though it was a long-lived storm, Tropical Storm Kathleen had little organization. Satellite pictures taken of the storm never showed more than a slight vortex. Tropical Storm Virginia The only tropical storm this season to form in the West Pacific and move into the basin, it was first noticed on August 24, At this time, the tropical cyclone was located northwest of Midway Atoll, just east of the International Date Line. It was upgraded to tropical storm status that same day, becoming the 11th storm of the typhoon season. After a brief flare in intensity, the storm crossed the Date Line while generating sustained winds of 60 mph (100 km/h). Within 24 hours after crossing, however, cold air entered the circulation, causing Virginia to be declared extratropical cyclone on August 25 at 38¬∞N Shortly before becoming doing so, it was estimated on best track that Virginia reached a minimum pressure of Moving towards the northeast, a ship called the Lica Maersk reported winds. Two more ship reports after the transition gave reported winds of on August 26 and on August 28, while the extratropical cyclone was over the Gulf of Alaska. The extratropical remnants of Virginia finally dissipated while in the Gulf of Alaska at an unprecedented latitude of 52¬∞N, which only one other storm has ever approached. Virginia formed at an unusually high latitude, first becoming tropical at 31¬∞N and crossing into the Central Pacific at 35¬∞N. Few tropical cyclones have ever reached such latitudes and only one named cyclone ‚Äì Typhoon Sarah from the previous year ‚Äì had ever done it. At that time, Tropical Storm Virginia held the record for the northernmost tropical storm formation in the Pacific basin. Hurricane Liza Hurricane Liza was a rapidly forming hurricane with an uncertain peak intensity. Forming suddenly from an area of the ITCZ on August 28, the hurricane quickly strengthened to reach a peak of 85 mph (140 km/h) on August 30, though there is a possibility that the hurricane topped out as a Category 3 hurricane with winds of . After reaching its peak, cool inflow caused the hurricane to begin to weaken. The hurricane was downgraded into a storm on September 2, despite a presentation that an observer remarked could mean that Liza was not even that strong. The hurricane continued to weaken, being downgraded into a tropical depression on September 4 and dissipating on September 6. Liza was responsible for causing slight flooding in Long Beach, California, and clogging storm drains. Various Labor Day swimmers were also swept up by waves triggered by Liza. A total of 261 swimmers were reported swept in Newport Beach and 47 in Zuma Beach; all of which were rescued. Near Laguna Beach, three sundecks worth $5,000 (1968 US$) were ripped from their supports by the surf. Tropical Storm Madeline On August 28, satellite pictures picked up a central dense overcast spanning a distance of while located to the east-southeast of the newly upgraded Tropical Storm Liza. The cloud mass grew in size, but was still disorganized when it was photographed on August 29, and a ship nearby reported calm winds, wind waves were so not distinct that no direction of origin could be determined, and a swell of from an undetermined direction. The best track would eventually show that the system was a depression around this time. The same ship would later report a wind speed of 50 mph (85 km/h) from the north-northwest and a pressure estimate of was determined via satellite, leading to the system to be upgraded to storm strength. The next day, the cloud mass associated with Madeline was beginning to become less organized; the storm dissipated later on August 30. The only direct evidence to support the tropical storm status of the system was a 50 mph (85 km/h) ship report. It is unknown whether or not the report of tropical storm-force winds was a gust or a sustained wind. Hurricane Naomi Forming from a disturbance in the ITCZ on September 9, the storm rapidly intensified, becoming a hurricane shortly after being upgraded into a tropical storm. The hurricane eventually made a turn to the northeast, which took it to a landfall on Sinaloa near the town of Punta Piaxtla. There were four Sinaloan casualties from the hurricane, and a worker in Texas was injured when the roof of a plant they were working at collapsed from accumulated rainfall due to the interaction between Naomi and a frontal system over the Gulf Coast. The hurricane also was responsible for a panic involving the L√°zaro Carden√°s Dam, which was unfinished when the hurricane struck. Due in large part to the help of Automatic Picture Transmission technology, two towns downriver from the dam were saved when it was kept closed. A total of $16 million (1968 USD) in damages was reported from the hurricane in Sinaloa. Tropical Storm Orla On September 21, satellite photography showed a cloud mass in diameter and ship reports the next day showed a weak circulation that was producing showers, and there was uncertainty in the location of the atmospheric circulation. Four hours later, it was found that external banding associated with the disturbance had increased and that its size had grown to 175 mi (282 km), but any information on internal banding was unavailable, due to obscuring cirrus. On September 23, the disturbance was 125 mi (201 km) southeast of Socorro Island, which reported a pressure drop of 5 mbar in 3 hours, which served as the basis for upgrading the disturbance to a tropical depression. Other information from Socorro included calm winds, low clouds, and a pressure of . Despite advisories on the depression starting on September 23, best track data showed that the disturbance had been a depression for the duration of the previous day. Later that day, the depression strengthened to a tropical storm with winds of 60 mph (95 km/h). Three hours after first being named, Orla began showing signs of an eye, and winds were operationally upgraded to , though it was later found out that it never strengthened past 60 mph (95 km/h). At this time, the area around the tropical storm was mostly clear due to a dry flow off of the mainland. A ship called the Sapporo Maru passed north of the center reported swells of , but winds of only . By September 25, the eye and some of the external banding had disappeared. The storm then proceeded to shrink both in size and in intensity due to stable inflow, and an eye became apparent for the second time. Satellite images of the storm were the basis for the possibility that Orla was maintaining stability due to low-pressure baroclinical processes, an unusual characteristic due to the fact that such conditions are common in extratropical cyclones as opposed to tropical cyclones, which Orla was. By September 27, weakening had begun, and the tropical storm was downgraded to a depression on September 28 and a spiral cloud mass continued to be evident on satellite pictures until September 30, when the depression dissipated. Hurricane Pauline Forming from an ITCZ, the initial disturbance was tracked for 24 hours, after which it was upgraded to a tropical depression on September 28, although post-analysis revealed the cyclone was a depression since September 26. A vortex developed in the center, helping the cyclone to intensify into a tropical storm on September 29 and the next day, it was upgraded to a hurricane. Pauline underwent an eyewall replacement cycle on October 1 to October 2 before making landfall on Ciudad Constituti√≥n. The hurricane moved back over water, but lost tropical characteristics prior to a second landfall near Navojoa. Total damage is unknown from the hurricane, but a boat with five occupants was reported missing during the passage of the hurricane over Magdalena Bay. The occupants were never found, and were reported dead as a result. The remnants caused a tornado that touched down near Glendale, injuring three people due to flying glass, and causing severe damage to two apartment buildings. Hurricane Rebecca The initial circulation developed in the ITCZ south of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. A low organized along the area on October 4, but intensification did not begin in full effect until the night of October 5. On October 6, the cyclone had organized enough to be considered a tropical depression and was upgraded to a tropical storm later that day. The storm continued to intensify, causing ships to avoid the storm despite its location over heavy shipping lanes. Due lack of shipping reports on October 7 and October 8 led to the idea that the storm had made landfall. The error was revealed when a ship passing nearby reported that the storm had attained hurricane status, and a second ship gave a report that the hurricane had strengthened to a high-end Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with a peak intensity estimate of Category 3 strength, making Rebecca the third hurricane of the season that possibly reached such an intensity. However, the official peak in the best track file is 85 mph (140 km/h). After reaching its peak, the hurricane moved westward until October 9, when a satellite picture gave a hint of the rapid decay the hurricane was about to face. The hurricane began to weaken, and by the time the cyclone neared Socorro Island late on October 9, it had weakened to a tropical storm. The island reported a pressure of and calm winds, while the weakening storm was north-northwest of the island. The storm weakened to a depression on October 10 and dissipated on October 11. No damages or casualties were reported from the hurricane. Rebecca was a small hurricane that approached within of the Mexican coastline. Due to its formation and movement along heavy shipping lines, ships were forced to take detours to avoid running into the hurricane. The hurricane never actually reached land, though at one point a forecast for the hurricane gave the possibility for it to make a landfall on Baja California Peninsula as a tropical depression. At the time, Rebecca drew comparisons to Hurricane Daisy of 1962 and Hurricane King of 1950 due to its intensity and size. Tropical Storm Simone Simone was the last named cyclone this season to form from a disturbance in the ITCZ. A very short-lived storm, it rapidly formed from an area of squalls associated with the ITCZ close to the Guatemalan coast. Shortly after it formed, a ship called the Villanger reported winds of 45 mph (70 km/h) to 50 mph (80 km/h) along the northwest and southeast sections of a low center 30 mi (50 km/h) in diameter, leading to the cyclone to be called Simone. The storm moved towards the north and shortly thereafter, the previous low moved over land, likely due to the lack of a source of energy. However, another center formed back over water to the northwest of the previous one, prolonging the life of the storm. The new center caused the storm to shift towards Tapachula, Mexico and traveled along the coastline until dissipation. With a lifetime of only 24 hours, Simone was the shortest-lived tropical storm of 1968. Although the system was originally missing from best track data, a revision proposed to National Hurricane Center caused the storm to be reinserted with a peak intensity of 50 mph (80 km/h) winds and a central pressure of . The reason the winds were set at 50 mph (80 km/h) was due to the high pressure of the storm, making it the most likely intensity equivalent, although some readings show that higher winds were reported from the storm. Another reason it was selected was due to it being used as a generic wind speed for tropical storms in the Pacific database. Tropical Storm Tara The final storm of the season developed from unknown origins, although there is a possibility that anticyclogenesis over Mexico that occurred after the dissipation of Simone may have played a part in the formation. When it was first noticed in satellite pictures on October 20 while southwest of Acapulco, it was estimated to have already been a tropical storm with 60 mph (100 km/h), a peak intensity that was later downgraded in best track data to 50 mph (85 km/h). The same picture also showed a compact central dense overcast, a large mass of deep convection, spanning three degrees of latitude, cirrus outflow, and loose banding features. For the next two days, the center of circulation of Tropical Storm Tara became better defined while slowly growing larger. The intensifying Tara moved to the west at to before turning to the west-northwest at on October 23. At the time of the west-northwest turn, satellite pictures picked up a separation of the cirrus cap, causing the storm to weaken. The system lasted as a weak tropical storm until October 27, when it was determined to have weakened to a depression, although the possibility exists that it had been a depression for days. The depression dissipated the next day. Other systems Tropical Depression Two was an unusual depression that developed on June 21 between Mexico and the active Annette. The depression came close to landfall shortly before dissipating on June 22, when Annette also dissipated. The cyclone formed and remained less than longitude from the more powerful tropical storm while in the proximity of land. The formation and impact of this depression are unknown due to a lack of data. This depression was unusual in that tropical cyclones rarely form within such close range to another cyclone in this basin. Tropical Depression Four was a short-lived cyclone that became the first tropical cyclone to enter the Central Pacific during the season. It formed on July 12 west of South Point, Hawaii, and moved in a general westward direction. At one point in its track, it moved west- southwestward, reaching 15¬∞N when it made a slow turn to the west-northwest. The depression moved into the Central Pacific, where the depression dissipated on July 14, having never affected land. The next tropical depression, Eight, was only marginally longer-lived than the previous depression. The depression formed on July 30 southeast of South Point, Hawaii. Initially moving west- southwestward, it eventually turned to a northwestward track, which it would move along until it dissipated on August 1 east of Hawaii after being active for 60 hours. Tropical Depression Eighteen was the only tropical cyclone formation to occur in the Central Pacific this season. It was first noticed in satellite pictures roughly west-southwest of Cabo San Lucas on August 29 and, after forming, moved to the northwest at a speed of , crossing between Hawaii and Johnston Atoll until dissipating on August 31, having never affected land. Tropical Depression Twenty-One was the longest lived depression. It formed on October 11 over south-southeast of Cabo San Lucas and moved slowly to the northwest before turning to the southwest. The depression dissipated on October 15 south-southeast of the Baja California Peninsula. It never affected land. Tropical Depression Twenty-Two formed on October 15 at near the border between Mexico and Guatemala. The depression paralleled the Mexican coast until it dissipated on October 17 about southeast of Acapulco. No reports of damages or casualties have been reported in connection to this depression. Although the best track in the document done by JTWC shows the existence of this depression, a track map with depression tracks done by the same organization did not show a listing for this depression. Storm names The following names were used for named storms that formed in the eastern Pacific in 1968. No names were retired, so it was used again in the 1972 season.

She has also co-edited, with Kevin Prufer and Martin Rock, a volume of poems by Catherine Breese Davis, accompanied by essays and an interview about the poet‚Äôs life and work. Life Martha Collins was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and raised in Des Moines, Iowa. She graduated from Stanford University with a B.A., and the University of Iowa with an M.A. and a Ph.D. She taught at University of Massachusetts Boston, where she founded the Creative Writing Program in 1979; beginning in 1997, she was the Pauline Delaney Professor of Creative Writing at Oberlin College for ten years. In spring 2010, she served as Distinguished Visiting Writer at Cornell University, and in spring 2013 was Visiting Fannie Hurst Professor of Creative Literature at Washington University. She is currently editor-at-large for FIELD magazine and one of the editors of the Oberlin College Press, as well as a contributing editor to Consequence Magazine and Copper Nickel. In 1993 Collins began teaching in the summer workshop of the William Joiner Institute for the Study of War and Social Consequences where she met several writers from Vietnam, including poet Nguyen Quang Thieu. The next year she studied Vietnamese, and in 1998 published her co-translations of Nguyen Quang Thieu‚Äôs poems. Since then she has published three more co-translated volumes of Vietnamese poetry. She is a featured faculty member at the 2018 Poetry Seminar at The Frost Place in Franconia, NH.  Poetry  Known in her first few books for somewhat formal lyrical poems that occasionally referenced larger issues such as homelessness and war, Collins learned from an exhibit of lynching postcards in 2000 that the hanging her father said he had witnessed as a child was actually a lynching of an African American man, attended by 10,000 people in Cairo, Illinois. In 2005 Collins published Blue Front, a book-length poem that involved research and focused on the event, and in 2012 she explored issues of race from both personal and historical perspectives in White Papers. Her latest book, Admit One: An American Scrapbook, addresses racism, eugenics, immigration and other issues, focusing on the early twentieth-century eugenics movement. Cynthia Hogue has described Collins as ‚Äúa dazzling poet whose poetry is poised at the juncture between the lyric and ethics [and who] has addressed some of the most traumatic social issues of the twentieth century . . . in supple and complex poems. Those who have followed Collins‚Äô books have long since realized that no subject is off limits for her piercing intellect.\\" Awards * Best American Poetry 2013 * Ohioana Poetry Award, 2013, 2007 * Visiting Artist, Siena Art Institute, 2013 * Honorary Doctoral Degree, Cleveland State University, 2008 * Anisfield-Wolf Book Award (2007) for Blue Front * 25 Books to Remember, New York Public Library, 2006 * Laurence Goldstein Poetry Prize, Michigan Quarterly Review, 2005 * Lannan Foundation Residency Grant, 2003 * Witter Bynner / Santa Fe Art Institute Grant, 2001 * American Literary Translators Association Finalist Award, 1998 * Pushcart Prize, 1998, 1996, 1985 * Gordon Barber Memorial Award, Poetry Society of America, 1992 * National Endowment for the Arts Fellowship, 1990 * Peregrine Smith Poetry Competition for The Arrangement of Space, 1990 * Alice Fay Di Castagnola Award, Poetry Society of America, 1990 * Ingram Merrill Foundation Fellowship, 1988 * Breadloaf Fellowship, 1985 * Mary Carolyn Davies Memorial Award, Poetry Society of America, 1985 * Bunting Institute Fellowship, Radcliffe College, 1982‚Äì83 * National Endowment for the Humanities Fellowship, 1977‚Äì78 Works=Poetry *Because What Else Could I Do (Pitt Poetry, 2019) *Night Unto Night (Milkweed, 2018) *Admit One: An American Scrapbook (Pitt Poetry, 2016) *Day Unto Day (Milkweed, 2014) *White Papers (Pitt Poetry, 2012) *Sheer (Barnwood, 2008) chapbook \\"Their Work,\\" \\"Time Was,\\" \\"Through,\\" from Martha Collins, Gone So Far (2005) History of a Small Life on a Windy Planet (University of Georgia Press,1993) *The Arrangement of Space (Gibbs Smith, 1991) *The Catastrophe of Rainbows (Cleveland State University, 1985) Editor * Into English: Poems, Translations, Commentaries, with Kevin Prufer (Graywolf, 2017) * Catherine Breese Davis: On the Life and Work of an American Master (Pleiades Press, 2015), with Kevin Prufer and Martin Rock * Critical Essays on Louise Bogan (G.K.

Overview In Xanadu traces the path taken by Marco Polo from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem to the site of Shangdu, famed as Xanadu in English literature, in Inner Mongolia, China. The book begins with William Dalrymple taking a vial of holy oil from the burning lamps of the Holy Sepulchre, which he is to transport to Shangdu, the summer seat of the King Kubla Khan. It has been mentioned that Kubla Khan wanted a hundred learned men armed with Christian knowledge to come to his Khanate and spread the knowledge of Christianity. However, that plan was abandoned, and Marco Polo, along with his uncle, set out from Jerusalem on the silk route to Shang-du, to deliver a vial of the holy oil, which was rumoured to be inexhaustible, and therefore kept the lamps at the Sepulchre constantly burning. The rest of the journey is outlined with descriptions of most of the ancient sites along the Silk Route, which Marco Polo was supposed to have passed. The author compares the old time splendor of the cities on the Silk Route to their present physical and political conditions, and thereby illustrates the changes. Of special note is the part on his passage through the then revolution-torn Iran. He also describes the bureaucratic tangle he got into while getting a permit for China via the Northern Areas in Pakistan, and spending a couple of days in the Kohistan valley near Besham, on the banks of the river Indus in Pakistan, which is supposedly the last area where Alexander the Great might have stopped during his conquests. Various people of different ethnicities are also mentioned in the book, mainly the present day Central Asians and also, the Gujars from Kohistan and Swat vallies, although various scholars in Pakistan have doubted the veracity of many of these accounts.See Dani, AH 'Review: Some recent books on Northern Pakistan, in English' in Daily Observer Islamabad, March 1991; Tarin, O 'William Dalrymple's Karakoram Fantasy' in a paper at the Punjab University, Lahore, Seminar Proceedings 11-12 September 1993; Syed, AA in 'Imagination gone wild in the hills?', review, The Lahore Clarion Journal, 1993, Vol 20, No 2 The author has also supposedly described a primitive rite of the Gujars which he claims he accidentally stumbled upon while exploring the area.See Syed, AA, 1993, above Dalrymple speculates that the rite is a 'shin' ritual, apparently a throwback to the ancient pagan religion of the Gujars, which they followed before they converted to Islam; whereas Pakistani scholars opine that the incident simply depicts a wedding feast in Kohistan, in Northern Pakistan, where a goat is ritually slaughtered for the guests and is typical of a festive banquet of the area, and that Dalrymple is making much out of his rather hurried and uninformed passage through these parts.See Syed, 1993 and Tarin, 1993, aa These scholars throw a skeptical light on the portions of this book connected to Dalrymple's travels from Mansehra town until his passage into China.Dani, Tarin and Syed, as cited above Reception The journey was taken on a multitude of types of transport and lasted for four months. The book, which was written when the author was only 22, received rapturous reviews and won numerous awards, and established Dalrymple as a major new arrival on the British literary scene. Eminent travel writer Patrick Leigh Fermor chose In Xanadu as his book of the year in the Spectator and wrote, \\"William Dalrymple's In Xanadu carries us breakneck from a predawn glimmer in the Holy Sepulchre right across Asia... It is learned and comic, and a most gifted first book touched by the spirits of Kinglake, Robert Byron and E.

It was introduced to help newcomers write functioning SQL commands without requiring manual escaping. It was later described as intended to prevent inexperienced developers from writing code that was vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This feature was officially deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0 and removed in PHP 5.4, due to security concerns.  Concept  The current revision of the PHP manual mentions that the rationale behind magic quotes was to \\"help [prevent] code written by beginners from being dangerous.\\" It was however originally introduced in PHP 2 as a php.h compile- time setting for msql, only escaping single quotes, \\"making it easier to pass form data directly to msql queries\\". It originally was intended as a \\"convenience feature, not as [a] security feature.\\" The use scope for magic quotes was expanded in PHP 3. Single quotes, double quotes, backslashes and null characters in all user-supplied data all have a backslash prepended to them before being passed to the script in the \`$_GET\`, \`$_REQUEST\`, \`$_POST\` and \`$_COOKIE\` global variables. Developers can then in theory use string concatenation to construct safe SQL queries with data provided by the user. (This was most accurate when PHP 2 and PHP 3 were current, since the primary supported databases allowed only 1-byte character sets.)  Criticism  Magic quotes were enabled by default in new installations of PHP 3 and 4, but could be disabled through the \`magic_quotes_gpc\` configuration directive. Since the operation of magic quotes was behind the scenes and not immediately obvious, developers may have been unaware of their existence and the potential problems that they could introduce. The PHP documentation pointed out several pitfalls and recommended that, despite being enabled by default, they should be disabled. Problems with magic quotes included: * Not all data that are supplied by the user are intended for insertion into a database. They may be rendered directly to the screen, stored in a session, or previewed before saving. This can result in backslashes being added where they are not wanted and being shown to the end user. This bug often creeps into even widely used software. * Not all data that are supplied by the user and used in a database query are obtained directly from sources protected by magic quotes. For instance, a user-supplied value might be inserted into a database, protected by magic quotes, and later retrieved from the database and used in a subsequent database operation. The latter use is not protected by magic quotes, and a naive programmer used to relying on them may be unaware of the need to protect it explicitly. * Magic quotes also use the generic functionality provided by PHP's \`addslashes()\` function, which is not Unicode- aware and is still subject to SQL injection vulnerabilities in some multi-byte character encodings. Database-specific functions such as \`mysql_real_escape_string()\` or, where possible, prepared queries with bound parameters, are preferred. * While many database management systems support escaping quotes with a backslash, the standard actually calls for using another quote. Magic quotes offer no protection for databases not set up to support escaping quotes with a backslash. * Portability is an issue if an application is coded with the assumption that magic quotes are enabled and is then moved to a server where they are disabled, or vice versa. * Adding magic quotes and subsequently removing them where appropriate incurs a small but unnecessary amount of performance overhead. * Magic quotes do not protect against other common security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting attacks or SMTP header injection attacks. In November 2005 the core PHP developers decided that because of these problems, the magic quotes feature would be removed from PHP 6. When development of PHP 6 stalled and development continued on the 5.x branch instead, the feature was deprecated in PHP 5.3.0 and removed in 5.4.  Other approaches  * Some languages such as Perl and Ruby opt for an approach involving data tainting, where data from untrusted sources, such as user input, are considered \\"tainted\\" and can not be used for dangerous operations until explicitly marked as trustworthy, usually after validation or encoding. Since the construction of SQL queries is considered \\"dangerous\\" in this context, this forces the programmer to address the problem. Tainting does not solve the problem, but it does highlight those instances where there is a problem so that the programmer is able to solve them appropriately. * Joel Spolsky has suggested using a form of Hungarian notation that indicates whether data are safe or unsafe. * Modern database engines and libraries use parameterised queries to pass data to the database separately from SQL commands, greatly reducing the need to escape data before constructing the queries.

Giacomo first appeared in an article in the Scotsman newspaper in December 1827, offering his services as a teacher of French, Italian, and Spanish. The Scotsman stated, \\"suffice it to say, that he (Giacomo) is expatriated from Italy for having carried arms in defence of the liberties of his country, and seeks an asylum and a field for the exercise of his talents in the city.\\"The Scotsman, Wednesday 05 December 1827 Andrea graduated with a Master of Arts from the University of Edinburgh, spent some time in Demerara in what was then British Guyana, then arrived in Bradford as a young house surgeon at the Royal Infirmary.

This spike results in a trisynaptic EPSP being recorded in a postsynaptic pyramidal cell (cell 4, event A). At the same time, cell 3 drives both a basket cell (5) and chandelier cell (6) to threshold. The basket cell evokes a hyperpolarizing IPSP on the postsynaptically recorded pyramidal cell (cell 4, event B), four synapses removed from the original spike. The spiking chandelier cell (6) triggers yet another pyramidal neuron to fire (7), which produces an EPSP on the recorded neuron (cell 4, event C), five synapses away from the original spike. The result seen in the postsynaptic pyramidal neuron (cell 4) is a delayed EPSP- IPSP-EPSP sequence (events A, B, and C), traveling through three, four, and five synapses respectively. Moln√°r et al. propose that polysynaptic pathways similar to this one can be activated by a single action potential in a cortical pyramidal cell. Chandelier neurons or chandelier cells are a subset of GABA-ergic cortical interneurons. They are described as parvalbumin- containing and fast-spiking to distinguish them from other subtypes of GABAergic neurons, although more recent work has suggested that only a subset of chandelier cells test positive for parvalbumin by immunostaining. The name comes from the specific shape of their axon arbors, with the terminals forming distinct arrays called \\"cartridges\\". The cartridges are immunoreactive to an isoform of the GABA membrane transporter, GAT-1, and this serves as their identifying feature. GAT-1 is involved in the process of GABA reuptake into nerve terminals, thus helping to terminate its synaptic activity. Chandelier neurons synapse exclusively to the axon initial segment of pyramidal neurons, near the site where action potential is generated. It is believed that they provide inhibitory input to the pyramidal neurons, but there is data showing that in some circumstances the GABA from chandelier neurons could be excitatory. The axon cartridges formed by chandelier cells are one of the synapse types which show the most dramatic changes during normal adolescence, which could potentially be relevant to the adult onset of psychiatric disease.

It is situated close to the Ili River, some to the west of Yining, the main city of the prefecture and some south of Shuiding, the county seat. , Huiyuan's population was reported as 20,564. Between 1762 and 1866 the Huiyuan Fortress or Huiyuan City (, Hu√¨yu«én Ch√©ng), the center of the Chinese authority in Xinjiang was located within the southern area of the modern Huiyuan town.  History = Qing dynasty  Once part of the Dzungar Khanate, this area was annexed by the Manchus in the 1750s. The Old Huiyuan fort was built in 1764 during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor after the Revolt of the Altishahr Khojas. It acted as the center of Manchu military power and civilian administration in Xinjiang. The main fortress of the \\"Nine Forts\\" of Ili (see Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture#Qing dynasty for the history of the region), Huiyuan was the seat of the Governor- general of the region, the General of Ili The fort was located less than north the Ili river in the modern Laocheng Village (ËÄÅÂüéÊùë) in the south of the modern Huiyuan. Huiyuan suffered severe damage during the Muslim Rebellion of the 1860s. Besieged in his palace, the then General of Ili, Mingsioi, blew himself up rather than surrender to the rebels. The fort was completely destroyed during the Russian occupation that followed in 1871-81. The Russians left pursuant to the 1881 Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881), and in 1882 the military-administrative center moved to Suiding (now known as Shuiding), some north of the river, while a new Huiyuan fortress and the adjunct military- administrative town were rebuilt near the center of modern Huiyuan about north of the river. The headquarter of the General of Ili moved back to the new Huiyuan fort in 1894 after the construction completed. While the city of Yining (originally known as N√≠ngyu«én Ch√©ng, ) has remained the commercial center of the region, the 19th century Huiyuan, like its successor Suiding, was mostly a fortress and an administrative town. Huiyuan was known to the Russians and Westerners as the New Kuldja, Chinese Kuldja, Manchu Kuldja, or Ili, to distinguish it from Yining (the Old Kuldja or the Taranchi Kuldja).  Present  James Millward, writing in 1998, said that the only surviving remains of the Qing era structures were a drum tower and a section of the wall that used to enclose the Jiangjun's yamen. However, it has been reported that some of the Qing period buildings, including a bell tower and a \\"Governor General's Pavilion\\", have since been rebuilt at the site of the 1882 new Huiyuan fort as a tourist attraction, often referred to as the \\"Ancient Huiyuan Town\\" (),, not to be confused with the site of the old Huiyuan fort ().

Bombs were set off in two carriages, both filled with passengers, just after the train passed Diwana near the Indian city of Panipat, north of New Delhi. 70 people were killed in the ensuing fire and dozens more were injured. Of the 70 fatalities, most were Pakistani civilians. The victims also included some Indian civilians and three railway policemen. Investigators subsequently found evidence of suitcases with explosives and flammable material, including three undetonated bombs. Inside one of the undetonated suitcases, a digital timer encased in transparent plastic was packed alongside a dozen plastic bottles containing fuel oils and chemicals. After the bombing, eight unaffected carriages were allowed to continue onwards to Lahore with passengers. Both the Indian and Pakistani governments condemned the attack, and officials on both sides speculated that the perpetrators intended to disrupt improving relations between the two nations, since the attack came just a day before Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was to arrive in New Delhi to resume peace talks with Indian leaders. There have been a number of breaks in the investigation of the bombing. India's National Investigation Agency (NIA) charged eight people in the terrorist attack, including Swami Aseemanand, a Hindu cleric formerly affiliated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh. While Aseemanand has been released on bail, three persons charged in the case are absconding, and three others are in prison. The alleged mastermind, Sunil Joshi, was killed in 2007. In 2019, NIA court has acquitted all the accused. It has been allegedly linked to Abhinav Bharat, a Hindu fundamentalist group in India.The Mirror Explodes ‚Äì Outlook ‚Äì 19 July 2010 Other allegations also concurred on Lashkar-e-Taiba.US review finds five warnings of Headley‚Äôs militant links DNA India ‚Äì 8 November 2010 A United States report declared Arif Qasmani to be involved in the attack. Consequently, after consulting with the United Nations, the United States declared him an international terrorist. Questions were raised over a Pakistani national who was arrested after the bombings for not carrying valid papers and was seen as suspicious by the investigators, but was discharged within 14 days according to a statement of the first investigation officer assigned to the case. A court order had noted the statement of the police that no proof had been found against him, which was also stated later by one of the senior officers. A narco-analysis test was conducted on SIMI's leaders Safdar Nagori, Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez who had stated about Abdul Razzaq's involvement in the blasts and him informing Safdar about it. Times Now had broadcast a video of the test in 2017. The later statements of Swami Aseemanand of Sunil Joshi telling him of involvement of his men in the blast had caused confusion for the investigators. One of the investigating officers stated in 2016 that they had investigated the Islamists including Safdar but didn't find them involved. Razzaq who had been in prison since 2005 had been interrogated and had brought Qasmani to the notice of Intelligence Bureau as a key Lashkar financier. He was questioned regarding the case, but no evidence of his involvement were found. Some officers had also questioned the reliability of narco-analysis. Background Since their formation resulting from the Partition of India in 1947, India and Pakistan have had a conflict- ridden relationship. In their plan for the partition, the British allowed all 565 princely states to decide which country they wanted to join. Most Hindu- majority princely states acceded to the Republic of India, while most Muslim- majority princely states joined the Dominion (now Islamic Republic) of Pakistan. The decision made by the leaders of some of these princely states has been a source of conflict and tension between the two countries. Kashmir is one of these princely states‚Äîits population was mostly Muslim, but the Hindu ruler Hari Singh of the state decided to join India. The countries have fought four wars over this disputed region: the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965, the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971 (resulting in the formation of Bangladesh), and the Kargil War in 1999. Since the 1980s, militants in Jammu and Kashmir have targeted attacks on civilians, members of the government and the Indian Army. Some groups, like the Islamist militant organisations Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, believe that Kashmir should be integrated into Pakistan, while others‚Äîsuch as the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front‚Äîbelieve it should become an independent state. All told, thousands of civilians have died due to the insurgency. In recent years, the Indian and Pakistani governments have made attempts to bring peace or to at least calm the tensions between the countries. One such attempt in the peace process came with the launch of the Samjhauta Express, so-named because the word samjhauta means \\"accord\\" and \\"compromise\\" in Hindi and Urdu, respectively. This twice-weekly train service runs between Delhi and Attari in India and Wagah and Lahore in Pakistan. Launched in 1976, the Samjhauta Express served as the only rail connection between the two countries until the launch of the Thar Express. Given the nature of the transnational service and the ongoing violence in the region, the Samjhauta Express was always heavily guarded, as it was a high-risk target for terrorist attacks. Weeks after the Indian Parliament terrorist attack on 13 December 2001, the train service was discontinued amid security concerns. Although it resumed service on 15 January 2004, the train was placed on high security. Just days before the attack, Pakistani Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri announced that he was going to Delhi on 21 February 2007 to meet with Indian government officials to continue peace talks and to sign a nuclear risk reduction agreement. Details Twin blasts shook two coaches of the Samjhauta Express travelling between India and Pakistan at around 23:53 IST (18:23 UTC) on Sunday, 18 February 2007, shortly after the train had passed through the railway station in the village of Diwana, near the Indian city of Panipat. One railway employee manning the level crossing at the time stated: > It was about 11.52 when I showed the signal lantern to the Attari > [Samjhauta] Express which was coming in very fast, probably at over 100 > kilometers an hour (62.1 mph). Just as [it] reached near the home signal, I > could hear two loud explosions from the coaches near the guards' van at the > rear. After the explosions, both carriages were engulfed in flames and many passengers were incapacitated by the smoke. Witnesses claim to have seen passengers screaming and attempting to escape, but since most of the train's windows were barred for security reasons, many could not escape in time. The injured were pulled out of the burning carriages by fellow passengers and local residents. In the end, the terrorist attack left 70 people dead and 50 injured. Most of the dead and injured were Pakistani nationals, though some Indians, including railway workers, were also killed. Initial identification of the victims was hindered by the fact that many of the bodies were charred beyond recognition. The rest of the train, which was left undamaged by the attack, continued on to the border town of Attari. There, passengers were transferred to a Pakistani train which took them to their destination in Lahore. Reactions=India The Indian government and media initially began pointing the finger at Pakistan for the terror attacks. Widespread condemnation of Pakistan ensued, particularly from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, and Pakistan was accused of harbouring terrorists and intentionally derailing peace attempts with India. Indian Minister of Railways, Lalu Prasad Yadav, condemned the incident and went on to say that the attack was \\"an attempt to derail the improving relationship between India and Pakistan.\\" He also announced compensation payments of Rs. 1,000,000 (approx. ‚Ç¨17,500 or US$22,750) for the next-of-kin of each of the deceased and Rs. 50,000 for those injured. Home Minister Shivraj Patil claimed that \\"whoever is behind the incident is against peace and wants to spoil our growing relationship with other countries\\". Prime Minister Manmohan Singh expressed \\"anguish and grief\\" at the loss of life, and vowed that the culprits would be caught. India's foreign ministry also promised to issue visas for Pakistani relatives of those killed or injured in the blasts. Indian journalist Siddharth Varadarajan argued that the peace process should stay on track and that any wavering would be tantamount to surrendering to terrorism. The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party condemned the attacks and petitioned the ruling Indian National Congress to ask Pakistan to comply with its 2004 promise to crack down on cross-border terrorism. The party also argued for a harsher anti-terror bill to take a \\"zero tolerance\\" approach to terrorism in India. Pakistan The government of Pakistan reacted in the same vein, through its Foreign Minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri, proclaiming that this was an act of terrorism that should be investigated by Indian authorities. Kasuri said that the terrorist attack would not halt his trip to India, as he \\"will be leaving tomorrow for Delhi to further the peace process.\\" He went on to say that \\"we should hasten the peace process.\\" In response to the terrorist attack, President Pervez Musharraf stated \\"such wanton acts of terrorism will only serve to further strengthen our resolve to attain the mutually desired objective of sustainable peace between the two countries.\\" Musharraf also said that there must be a full Indian investigation of the attack. In regards to the upcoming peace talks, he stated \\"we will not allow elements which want to sabotage the ongoing peace process to succeed in their nefarious designs.\\" Others In the United Kingdom, Foreign Office minister Kim Howells condemned what he termed \\"utterly shameful\\" attacks, offered his \\"condolences to the family and friends of those killed and injured\\", and offered \\"the Governments of India and Pakistan whatever assistance they require, to bring to justice the perpetrators of this brutal attack.\\" Leaders in the British Pakistani community called the terrorist attack a \\"despicable act\\" and urged for a speedy investigation into the tragedy so that those responsible could be arrested and jailed. In the United States, the Bush administration condemned those responsible for the bomb explosions aboard the Samjhauta Express. On behalf of the United States government, White House spokesman David Almacy stated: > We express our deepest sorrow for this tragedy and extend condolences to the > families of the victims. We appreciate the leadership of Indian Prime > Minister (Manmohan) Singh and Pakistani President (Pervez) Musharraf, and > condemn those who seek to undermine the progress in relations between the > two countries. Tension On 23 February, a Pakistani Air Force C-130 plane landed, upon being granted approval, in New Delhi to evacuate Pakistanis injured in the train bombing. Of the ten people to be evacuated, three were missing, all from the same family. Pakistan's Foreign Office spokesperson, Tasneem Aslam, claimed that the father, Rana Shaukat Ali, was harassed by Indian intelligence agency personnel at the Safdarjung Hospital. Aslam also said that Pakistan High Commission officials were denied entrance into the hospital. An Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson, Navtej Sarna, denied these allegations and stated that the patients would be taken to the airport. Sarna told the press that Ali's family was not missing, and that hospital doctors had decided not to allow Pakistani officials access into the hospital. He also stated that the C-130 plane had developed a problem and could not take off. Later, Aslam told press correspondents that the \\"[C-130] aircraft was still at the airport\\" and that Mr. Ali had chosen to travel back to Pakistan via a land route. Despite the tensions between the two countries' External Affairs ministries, the C-130 aircraft took off from New Delhi at around 21:00 local time. After the incident, Ali criticised the media, who asked him for \\"stories for their publications at a time when I am not in my senses because of the death of my five children.\\" He also stated that Indian officials showed him sketches of suspects, but he could not identify them. Investigation The day after the bombing, Indian police stated that the suitcase bomb attack was the work of at least four or five people with a possible militant connection. The police also released sketches of two suspects who the police Inspector General said had left the train just fifteen minutes before the explosions. The police say that one of the men was around 35 or 36 years old, \\"plumpish\\" and dark, with a moustache, and the second was around 26 or 27, wearing a scarf wrapped around his head. The police also stated that both men were speaking Hindi. Another man, a Pakistani national who was drunk at the time, was being questioned because he said he threw one of the bomb-containing suitcases off the train. A senior Haryana state railway police official said that the man's \\"account has been inconsistent and we have no definite conclusions yet.\\" Later, the Inspector General said \\"the suitcase was thrown on the track\\" and that the Pakistani national \\"was there and said he had thrown it.\\" In early March, Haryana police arrested two people from the city of Indore who allegedly sold the suitcases used in the bombing. No charges were pressed on the individuals. A probe conducted by the commissioner of Railway Safety officially determined that the explosions and fire on the Samjhauta Express had been caused by bombs located in the upper compartments in coaches GS 03431 and GS 14857. The probe also showed that the train slowed to a speed of just before it was going to pass the Diwana train station. The results strengthened the belief that the suspects got off the train before the explosions. On 31 March, a 25-year-old man was interrogated after being arrested in Amritsar after jumping off a moving train under suspicious circumstances. Later developments No major developments took place in the investigation since late March 2007. Meanwhile, the Indian and Pakistan governments agreed to a bilateral pact to extend passenger train and freight services between the two countries until 2010. In late April, the Indian and Pakistan governments initiated steps for safety and security measures for the Samjhauta Express. The two countries started sharing information on passengers travelling on the trains. The train is now under a reservation system, and as one Railway Ministry source said, \\"[w]ith no unreserved coaches, we now have complete passenger details from their ticket reservation data a few hours prior to their boarding, and departure of the train.\\" Also in late April, three new coaches equipped with India's most advanced fire fighting systems were added to the Samjhauta Express. Indian Railway Ministry sources commented that the system acts with brake pressure, and this glass-encased system could throw water up to . Indian and Pakistani members of the Anti-Terror Mechanism (ATM) group met on 22 October 2007 to update each other regarding the status of the investigation. In November 2008, it was reported that Indian officials suspected the attacks were linked to Lt. Col. Prasad Shrikant Purohit, an Indian army officer also alleged member of Hindu nationalist group Abhinav Bharat. Purohit himself claimed that he had \\"infiltrated\\" the Abhinav Bharat and he was only doing his job. During an army's Court of Inquiry as many as 59 witnesses stated to the court that Purohit was doing his job (of gathering intelligence inputs) by infiltrating extremist organizations. Officers have testified that he was doing what he was asked to do as a military intelligence man. Investigators concluded that the suitcases used to make the suitcase bombs originated from Indore in India, based on their stitching. Indian officials said they were prepared to share their findings with Pakistan. In January 2010, Pakistan Interior Minister Rehman Malik accused India of not pursuing the case seriously, and of refusing to divulge details about the role of Lieutenant Colonel Shrikant Purohit. Malik alleged that Purohit had hired Pakistani extremists to carry out the bombing. In October 2010, an 806-page chargesheet prepared by the Rajasthan anti-terrorist squad revealed that the Samjhauta Express had been discussed as a potential target for an attack at a meeting of Hindutva bomb makers in February 2006; the group subsequently travelled to Indore. On 30 December 2010, National Investigation Agency claimed that they have solid evidence that Swami Aseemanand was the mastermind behind the blasts. He had roped in Sandeep Dange, an engineering graduate, and Ramji Kalsangra, an electrician, to build the improvised explosive devices used in the blasts. On 8 January 2011, Aseemanand confessed that Saffron terror outfits were behind the bombing of Samjhauta express, a statement his council later stated was obtained under duress.Swami Aseemanand 'confessed' under duress Times of India ‚Äì 10 January 2011 Later RSS sent a legal notice to CBI accusing it for deliberately leaking Swami Aseemanand's confession in media. RSS spokesman Ram Madavh called the investigation maligning of organisations and individuals. However, in late March 2011, Aseemanand came out and stated: \\"I have been pressurised mentally and physically by the investigating agencies to confess that I was behind these blasts.\\"SAMJAUTA BLAST PROBE: MESSIER & MESSIER South Asia Analysis Group ‚Äì 2 April 2011 Aseemanand was charged on 20 June 2011 for planning the blast.

According to sources, Chouhan had a possible role in planting the bomb in the train. Chouhan is believed to be a close aide of Ramji Kalsangra and Sandeep Dange, two key Indian suspects in the case on whom the agency has announced a cash reward of 1 million for information of their whereabouts. The National Investigation Agency is likely to file a fresh chargesheet in a next couple of days which will name Kamal Chauhan and Amit Chauhan as the two alleged bombers who along with Lokesh Sharma and Rajendra Pehalwan allegedly planted the four suitcase bombs in the train. In April 2016, Director General of NIA requested the United States government to provide information on LeT Key financier Arif Qasmani. The US charge sheet in 2009 accused Qasmani of funding the blasts. Later, in April 2016, NIA declared that Lt Col Purohit was never an accused in the case and there was no evidence of his involvement in the bombing. In late- June 2017, Times Now and India TV reported that a Pakistani national Ajmat Ali who was a suspect in the case were discharged within 14 days based on the statements of Gurdeep Singh who was the first investigation officer assigned to the case which were also mentioned in a deposition to a court 12 days earlier. Al was arrested by Punjab police for not carrying valid papers and he was handed over to police of Haryana for interrogation. He was stated to match the description of the suspect who planted the bombs according to eyewitnesses and was accused of having used false identities by the police. Per a report, he had stated about undertaking reconnaissance of many prominent cities. He however was discharged by senior officials probing the case with the court order noting the police's statement that no proof had been found. Per India TV, top police officials in a meeting on 21 July 2010 had decided to hand over the investigation to NIA as Haryana Police failed to bring the case to any logical conclusion and had also decided to probe the role of Hindu groups. The Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad hinted the UPA government had planted the angle of role of \\"Hindu terror\\" and questioned the suspect's release. A report carried by The Hindu in July 2017 contained a statement of one of the senior officer Bharti Arora who had directed the suspect to be discharged, had headed the SIT at that time and was named by Gurdeep Singh in his statement, stated that his statement was being misread. She added that Ali was properly interrogated and discharged when nothing was found against him. She also stated that she would take legal action against the channel stating a sting report of letting-off the suspects in 14 days, for what she claimed was a \\"false report\\". NIA stated it would not investigate the claims about the case till court orders. The Hindustan Times carried a report in September 2008 of statements from the narco-analysis test conducted on SIMI's extremist wing chief Safdar Nagori as well as other leaders who were Kamruddin Nagori and Amil Parvez. Safdar at the time was of the blast was in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh due to a fractured hand. Per reports of the test, he stated that Abdul Razzaq was involved in the blast and had informed him the blasts would be carried out with the help of a few Pakistani nationals. Kamruddin and Amil Parvez had stated that Razzak was close to Nagori, had informed him and discussed about the blasts. Safdar however denied any meeting was held to plot the blast. A video of Safdar's test was broadcast by Times Now in July 2017. Rediff carried a report in 2011 that the later statements by Aseemanand on Sunil Joshi telling him of his role in the blasts had caused confusion among NIA and both the testimonies were contrary to each other. Vikash Narain Rai, the former Haryana police officer who headed the SIT from 2007 to early 2010, told The Wire in June 2016 mentioned that the SIT's first suspect were Pakistan-based terror groups or organisations like SIMI, stating that they had investigated many Islamists including Nagori. He stated that it became clear they were not involved as investigations progressed. Per a report by The Indian Express Razzaq who had been in prison since August 2005 after being deported from Iran, was interrogated after Safdar's narcoanalysis and brought Qasmani to the attention of Intelligence Bureau as a Lashkar financier. Per diplomatic sources due to this a dossier was given with Qasmani's purported involvement to the United States which according to a note recording an informal meeting between the NIA probe team and FBI was the cause for sanctions by Treasury Department on him. Razzaq was questioned by Madhya Pradesh and Haryana Police regarding the blast, but no evidence of his involvement was stated to be found.

A black handwheel is visible on the actuator, which allows manual positioning of the valve. The blue valve body is visible in-line with the pipe. The valve actuator opens or closes the butterfly disc of the valve based on electrical signals sent to the actuator. Another valve actuator is visible in the background, with windows to indicate the valve position. A valve actuator is the mechanism for opening and closing a valve. Manually operated valves require someone in attendance to adjust them using a direct or geared mechanism attached to the valve stem. Power-operated actuators, using gas pressure, hydraulic pressure or electricity, allow a valve to be adjusted remotely, or allow rapid operation of large valves. Power-operated valve actuators may be the final elements of an automatic control loop which automatically regulates some flow, level or other process. Actuators may be only to open and close the valve, or may allow intermediate positioning; some valve actuators include switches or other ways to remotely indicate the position of the valve. Used for the automation of industrial valves, actuators can be found in all kinds of process plants. They are used in waste water treatment plants, power plants, refineries, mining and nuclear processes, food factories, and pipelines. Valve actuators play a major part in automating process control. The valves to be automated vary both in design and dimension. The diameters of the valves range from one-tenth of an inch to several feet. Types There are four common types of actuators: manual, pneumatic, hydraulic, and electric. Manual  A manual actuator employs levers, gears, or wheels to move the valve stem. Manual actuators are powered by hand. Manual actuators are inexpensive, typically self-contained and easy to operate. However, some large valves are impossible to operate manually and some valves may be located in remote, toxic or hostile environments that prevent manual operations. As a safety feature, certain types of situations may require quicker operation than manual actuators can provide to close the valve. Pneumatic  Air (or other gas) pressure is the power source for pneumatic valve actuators. They are used on linear or quarter-turn valves. Air pressure acts on a piston or bellows diaphragm creating linear force on a valve stem. Alternatively, a quarter-turn vane-type actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. A pneumatic actuator may be arranged to be spring-closed or spring-opened, with air pressure overcoming the spring to provide movement. A \\"double acting\\" actuator use air applied to different inlets to move the valve in the opening or closing direction. A central compressed air system can provide the clean, dry, compressed air needed for pneumatic actuators. In some types, for example, regulators for compressed gas, the supply pressure is provided from the process gas stream and waste gas either vented to air or dumped into lower- pressure process piping. Hydraulic  Hydraulic actuators convert fluid pressure into motion. Similar to pneumatic actuators, they are used on linear or quarter-turn valves. Fluid pressure acting on a piston provides linear thrust for gate or globe valves. A quarter-turn actuator produces torque to provide rotary motion to operate a quarter-turn valve. Most types of hydraulic actuators can be supplied with fail-safe features to close or open a valve under emergency circumstances. Hydraulic pressure can be supplied by a self- contained hydraulic pressure pump. In some applications, such as water pumping stations, the process fluid can provide hydraulic pressure, although the actuators must use materials compatible with the fluid. thumb Electric valve actuator mounted on a pressure reducing needle valve. Electric  The electric actuator uses an electric motor to provide torque to operate a valve. They are quiet, non-toxic and energy efficient. However, electricity must be available, which is not always the case, they can also operate on batteries. Spring  Spring-based actuators hold back a spring. Once any anomaly is detected, or power is lost, the spring is released, operating the valve. They can only operate once, without resetting, and so are used for one-use purposes such as emergencies. They have the advantage that they do not require a powerful electric supply to move the valve, so they can operate from restricted battery power, or automatically when all power has been lost. Actuator movement Gate Valve with Handwheel (L) and with Linear Pneumatic Actuator (R) A linear actuator opens and closes valves that can be operated via linear force, the type sometimes called a \\"rising stem\\" valve. These types of valves include globe valves, rising stem ball valves, control valves and gate valves. The two main types of linear actuators are diaphragm and piston. Diaphragm actuators are made out of a round piece of rubber and squeezed around its edges between two side of a cylinder or chamber that allows air pressure to enter either side pushing the piece of rubber one direction or the other. A rod is connected to the center of the diaphragm so that it moves as the pressure is applied. The rod is then connected to a valve stem which allows the valve to experience the linear motion thereby opening or closing. A diaphragm actuator is useful if the supply pressure is moderate and the valve travel and thrust required are low. Piston actuators use a piston which moves along the length of a cylinder. The piston rod conveys the force on the piston to the valve stem. Piston actuators allow higher pressures, longer travel ranges, and higher thrust forces than diaphragm actuators. A spring is used to provide defined behavior in the case of loss of power. This is important in safety related incidents and is sometimes the driving factor in specifications. An example of loss of power is when the air compressor (the main source of compressed air that provides the fluid for the actuator to move) shuts down. If there is a spring inside of the actuator, it will force the valve open or closed and will keep it in that position while power is restored. An actuator may be specified \\"fail open\\" or \\"fail close\\" to describe its behavior. In the case of an electric actuator, losing power will keep the valve stationary unless there is a back up power supply. A typical representative of the valves to be automated is a plug-type control valve. Just like the plug in the bathtub is pressed into the drain, the plug is pressed into the plug seat by a stroke movement. The pressure of the medium acts upon the plug while the thrust unit has to provide the same amount of thrust to be able to hold and move the plug against this pressure. Features of an electric actuator  Electric multi-turn actuator with controls Baumann, Oliver \\"Type of documents/Cut-away drawings/Actuators \\". auma Riester GmbH & Co. KG. September 28, 2008. Motor (1) Robust asynchronous three-phase AC motors are mostly used as the driving force, for some applications also single-phase AC or DC motors are used. These motors are specially adapted for valve automation as they provide higher torques from standstill than comparable conventional motors, a necessary requirement to unseat sticky valves. The actuators are expected to operate under extreme ambient conditions, however they are generally not used for continuous operation since the motor heat buildup can be excessive. Limit and torque sensors (2) The limit switches signal when an end position has been reached. The torque switching measures the torque present in the valve. When exceeding a set limit, this is signaled in the same way. Actuators are often equipped with a remote position transmitter which indicates the valve position as continuous 4-20mA current or voltage signal. Gearing (3) Often a worm gearing is used to reduce the high output speed of the electric motor. This enables a high reduction ratio within the gear stage, leading to a low efficiency which is desired for the actuators. The gearing is therefore self-locking i.e. it prevents accidental and undesired changes of the valve position by acting upon the valve‚Äôs closing element. Valve attachment (4) The valve attachment consists of two elements. First: The flange used to firmly connect the actuator to the counterpart on the valve side. The higher the torque to be transmitted, the larger the flange required. Second: The output drive type used to transmit the torque or the thrust from the actuator to the valve shaft. Just like there is a multitude of valves there is also a multitude of valve attachments. Dimensions and design of valve mounting flange and valve attachments are stipulated in the standards EN ISO 5210 for multi-turn actuators or EN ISO 5211 for part-turn actuators. The design of valve attachments for linear actuators is generally based on DIN 3358. Manual operation (5) In their basic version most electric actuators are equipped with a handwheel for operating the actuators during commissioning or power failure. The handwheel does not move during motor operation. The electronic torque limiting switches are not functional during manual operation. Mechanical torque-limiting devices are commonly used to prevent torque overload during manual operation. Actuator controls (6) Both actuator signals and operation commands of the DCS are processed within the actuator controls. This task can in principle be assumed by external controls, e.g. a PLC. Modern actuators include integral controls which process signals locally without any delay. The controls also include the switchgear required to control the electric motor. This can either be reversing contactors or thyristors which, being an electric component, are not subject to mechanic wear. Controls use the switchgear to switch the electric motor on or off depending on the signals or commands present. Another task of the actuator controls is to provide the DCS with feedback signals, e.g. when reaching a valve end position. Electrical connection (7) The supply cables of the motor and the signal cables for transmitting the commands to the actuator and sending feedback signals on the actuator status are connected to the electrical connection. The electrical connection can be designed as a separately sealed terminal bung or plug/socket connector. For maintenance purposes, the wiring should be easily disconnected and reconnected. Fieldbus connection (8) Fieldbus technology is increasingly used for data transmission in process automation applications. Electric actuators can therefore be equipped with all common fieldbus interfaces used in process automation. Special connections are required for the connection of fieldbus data cables. Functions=Automatic switching off in the end positions After receiving an operation command, the actuator moves the valve in direction OPEN or CLOSE. When reaching the end position, an automatic switch- off procedure is started. Two fundamentally different switch-off mechanisms can be used. The controls switch off the actuator as soon as the set tripping point has been reached. This is called limit seating. However, there are valve types for which the closing element has to be moved in the end position at a defined force or a defined torque to ensure that the valve seals tightly. This is called torque seating. The controls are programmed as to ensure that the actuator is switched off when exceeding the set torque limit. The end position is signalled by a limit switch. Safety functions The torque switching is not only used for torque seating in the end position, but it also serves as overload protection over the whole travel and protects the valve against excessive torque. If excessive torque acts upon the closing element in an intermediate position, e.g. due to a trapped object, the torque switching will trip when reaching the set tripping torque. In this situation the end position is not signalled by the limit switch. The controls can therefore distinguish between normal operation torque switch tripping in one of the end positions and switching off in an intermediate position due to excessive torque. Temperature sensors are required to protect the motor against overheating. For some applications by other manufacturers, the increase of the motor current is also monitored. Thermoswitches or PTC thermistors which are embedded in the motor windings mostly reliably fulfil this task. They trip when the temperature limit has been exceeded and the controls switch off the motor. The positioner [1] is supplied with a setpoint [2] and an actual value [3]. The motor is controlled until the actual value is identical to the setpoint. The DCS generally needs a feedback signal [4] Process control functions Due to increasing decentralisation in automation technology and the introduction of micro processors, more and more functions have been transferred from the DCS to the field devices. The data volume to be transmitted was reduced accordingly, in particular by the introduction of fieldbus technology. Electric actuators whose functions have been considerably expanded are also affected by this development. The simplest example is the position control. Modern positioners are equipped with self-adaptation i.e. the positioning behaviour is monitored and continuously optimised via controller parameters. Meanwhile, electric actuators are equipped with fully-fledged process controllers (PID controllers). Especially for remote installations, e.g. the flow control to an elevated tank, the actuator can assume the tasks of a PLC which otherwise would have to be additionally installed. Diagnosis Modern actuators have extensive diagnostic functions which can help identify the cause of a failure. They also log the operating data. Study of the logged data allows the operation to be optimised by changing the parameters and the wear of both actuator and valve to be reduced. Duty types Typical time period in open-close duty. t1 is the operating time and may not exceed the maximum permissible running time Typical time period in modulating duty. Open-close duty If a valve is used as a shut-off valve, then it will be either open or closed and intermediate positions are not held... Positioning duty Defined intermediate positions are approached for setting a static flow through a pipeline. The same running time limits as in open-close duty apply. Modulating duty The most distinctive feature of a closed-loop application is that changing conditions require frequent adjustment of the actuator, for example, to set a certain flow rate. Sensitive closed-loop applications require adjustments within intervals of a few seconds. The demands on the actuator are higher than in open-close or positioning duty. Actuator design must be able to withstand the high number of starts without any deterioration in control accuracy. Service conditions Actuators are used in Siberia... ...and also in the Sahara Actuators are specified for the desired life and reliability for a given set of application service conditions. In addition to the static and dynamic load and response time required for the valve, the actuator must withstand the temperature range, corrosion environment and other conditions of a specific application. Valve actuator applications are often safety related, therefore the plant operators put high demands on the reliability of the devices. Failure of an actuator may cause accidents in process-controlled plants and toxic substances may leak into the environment. Process-control plants are often operated for several decades which justifies the higher demands put on the lifetime of the devices. For this reason, actuators are always designed in high enclosure protection. The manufacturers put a lot of work and knowledge into corrosion protection. Enclosure protection The enclosure protection types are defined according to the IP codes of EN 60529. The basic versions of most electric actuators are designed to the second highest enclosure protection IP 67. This means they are protected against the ingress of dust and water during immersion (30 min at a max. head of water of 1 m). Most actuator manufacturers also supply devices to enclosure protection IP 68 which provides protection against submersion up to a max. head of water of 6 m. Ambient temperatures In Siberia, temperatures down to ‚Äì 60 ¬∞C may occur, and in technical process plants + 100 ¬∞C may be exceeded. Using the proper lubricant is crucial for full operation under these conditions. Greases which may be used at room temperature can become too solid at low temperatures for the actuator to overcome the resistance within the device. At high temperatures, these greases can liquify and lose their lubricating power. When sizing the actuator, the ambient temperature and the selection of the correct lubricant are of major importance. Explosion protection Actuators are used in applications where potentially explosive atmospheres may occur. This includes among others refineries, pipelines, oil and gas exploration or even mining. When a potentially explosive gas-air-mixture or gas-dust-mixture occurs, the actuator must not act as ignition source. Hot surfaces on the actuator as well as ignition sparks created by the actuator have to be avoided. This can be achieved by a flameproof enclosure, where the housing is designed to prevent ignition sparks from leaving the housing even if there is an explosion inside. Actuators designed for these applications, being explosion-proof devices, have to be qualified by a test authority (notified body). Explosion protection is not standardized worldwide. Within the European Union, ATEX 94/9/EC applies, in US, the NEC (approval by FM) or the CEC in Canada (approval by the CSA). Explosion-proof actuators have to meet the design requirements of these directives and regulations. Additional uses Small electric actuators can be used in a wide variety of assembly, packaging and testing applications. Such actuators can be linear, rotary, or a combination of the two, and can be combined to perform work in three dimensions. Such actuators are often used to replace pneumatic cylinders.

Sulfur compounds darken gasoline, give it an offensive odor and increase toxic sulfur dioxide engine emissions.McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, 6th edition, published by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc., 2003 However, this process only reduces the odor. These sulfur compounds can be removed with the following chemical reactions:G.L. Wendt, S.H.

Wendt and S. Diggs in 1924. They also showed that the lead oxide solution brought about oxidation of the mercaptans to the corresponding organic disulfides, which are comparatively odourless. Lead oxide (litharge) dissolves in reasonably concentrated solutions of sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide owing to formation of a soluble compound, sodium plumbite: :PbO + 2NaOH -> Na2PbO2 + H2O When this alkaline solution is agitated with petroleum, the two liquids do not dissolve in one another, but any mercaptan in the oil will unite with an equivalent amount of the lead (which then passes into the petroleum) to form what is called a lead mercaptide, soluble in the oil: :2RSH + Na2PbO2 -> (RS)2Pb + 2NaOH If the mixture is now treated with powdered sulfur, which has a high affinity for lead, a black suspension of lead sulfide forms, and conversion of the mercaptide into a so-called disulfide (which remains in the oil) is induced: : -(RS)2Pb + S -> RS-SR + PbS With no sulfur added, but in the presence of atmospheric oxygen, the same conversion occurs, but only slowly, and probably not completely: : 2(RS)2Pb + 4NaOH + O2 -> 2RS-SR + 2Na2PbO2 + 2H2O It is evident that the process does not remove the sulfur from the oil but even may increase the sulfur content if too much powdered sulfur is added, and some of the lead may remain in the petroleum. The described chemistry is also the basis of the doctor test for the sweetness or sourness of gasoline (i.e., the extent of sulfur contamination). A gasoline is described as doctor sweet if, after shaking with sodium plumbite solutions, the addition of powdered sulfur fails to produce a dark precipitate of lead sulfide.

He was the sixth- youngest son of Andrew Rollock, laird of Duncrub, Perthshire, and became a student of St Mary's College, St Andrews from 1572 until 1575, graduating Master of Arts. He renewed his studies in 1581, probably studying Law in Continental Europe in order to become an Advocate. He was appointed Bishop of Dunkeld, though he exercised few episcopal duties, the purpose of his appointment being to administer the diocese and to be eligible to sit in the Parliament of Scotland. Rollock became a royal judge and councillor, becoming a Lord of Session in 1596. After travelling to England with King James VI, now James I of England, he came back to Scotland in 1605. As King James began reviving episcopacy, Rollock was compelled to give up his bishopric, and James Nicolson was appointed in his place in 1607. Rollock experienced a fluctuating position in the higher echelons of government, losing (1609) and regaining (1610) and then resigning (1620) his place on the bench, and going in (1587) and out (1610) and in again (1616) and then leaving (1625) the Privy Council. He died in 1632. He married the twice-widowed Christian Cant, but had no children.

He was general manager of La Scala in Milan, Italy from 1898 to 1908 and later the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1908 to 1935. Biography Time cover, 5 Nov 1923 Gatti-Casazza was born on 3 February 1869 in Udine, in northeastern Italy. In 1893 he succeeded his father as manager of the municipal theatre in Ferrara. He was manager of La Scala from 1898 to 1908, before his move to New York City, when he became general manager of the Metropolitan Opera from 1908 to 1935. Under his leadership the Metropolitan enjoyed a prolonged era of artistic innovation and musical excellence. He brought with him conductor Arturo Toscanini, who became the company's principal conductor and led performances of Verdi, Wagner and others that set high standards for the Metropolitan which have endured to the present day. The Viennese composer Gustav Mahler also was a Met conductor during Gatti-Casazza's first two seasons and in later years conductors Tullio Serafin and Artur Bodanzky led the company in the Italian and German repertories respectively. Affectionately called \\"Gatti\\" by friends and colleagues, Gatti- Casazza's prodigious artistic and organizational skills attracted the best singers and conductors to the Metropolitan, and, on 10 December 1910, hosted its first World premiere, La Fanciulla del West by Giacomo Puccini. Many noted singers of the era appeared at the Met under Gatti-Casazza's leadership, including Rosa Ponselle, Emmy Destinn, Frances Alda, Amelita Galli-Curci, Maria Jeritza, Lily Pons; Enrico Caruso, Jacques Urlus, Giovanni Martinelli, Beniamino Gigli, Feodor Chaliapin, Titta Ruffo, Giacomo Lauri-Volpi, and Lauritz Melchior. For his accomplishments Gatti-Casazza was one of the first Italians (and the first Italian living in the United States) to be featured on the cover of Time Magazine. He was on the weekly's cover twice; on 5 November 1923, and again on 1 November 1926.Image on Time Magazine cover (1 November 1926) In 1910, he married the soprano Frances Alda. They divorced in 1928 and he married the Met's prima ballerina Rosina Galli. He retired in 1935 and spent the last years of his life in his native Italy.

At the core of STK is a geometry engine for determining the time- dynamic position and attitude of objects (\\"assets\\"), and the spatial relationships among the objects under consideration including their relationships or accesses given a number of complex, simultaneous constraining conditions. STK has been developed since 1989 as a commercial off the shelf software tool. Originally created to solve problems involving Earth-orbiting satellites, it is now used in the aerospace and defense communities and for many other applications. STK is used in government, commercial, and defense applications around the world. Clients of AGI are organizations such as NASA, ESA, CNES, DLR, Boeing, JAXA, ISRO, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Airbus, The US DoD, and Civil Air Patrol.  History  In 1989, the three founders of Analytical Graphics, Inc. - Paul Graziani, Scott Reynolds and Jim Poland, left GE Aerospace to create Satellite Tool Kit (STK) as an alternative to bespoke, project-specific aerospace software. The original version of STK ran only on Sun Microsystems computers, but as PCs became more powerful, the code was converted to run on Windows. STK was first adopted by the aerospace community for orbit analysis and access calculations (when a satellite can see a ground- station or image target), but as the software was expanded, more modules were added that included the ability to perform calculations for communications systems, radar, interplanetary missions and orbit collision avoidance. The addition of 3D viewing capabilities led to the adoption of the tool by military users for real-time visualization of air, land and sea forces as well as the space component. STK has also been used by various news organizations to graphically depict current events to a wider audience, including the deorbit of Russia's Mir Space Station, the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, the Iridium/Cosmos collision, the asteroid 2012 DA14 close approach and various North Korea missile tests. As of version 10 (released in 2012), the software underwent a name change from Satellite Tool Kit to Systems Tool Kit to reflect its applicability in land, sea, air, and space systems. In 2019, Dutch amateur skywatcher Marco Langbroek used STK to analyze a high-resolution photograph of an Iranian launch site accident tweeted by US President Trump. It was \\"the first time in three and a half decades that an image [had] become public that [revealed] the sophistication of US spy satellites in orbit.\\" Langbroek and astronomer Cees Bassa, identified the specific classified spysat (USA-224, a KH-11 satellite with an objective mirror as large as the Hubble Space Telescope) that had taken the photograph, and the time when it was taken on a particular satellite pass.  Interface  The STK interface is a standard GUI display with customizable toolbars and dockable maps and 3D viewports. All analysis can be done through mouse and keyboard interaction. In addition, there is a scripting interface named Connect that enables STK to act within a client/server environment (via TCP/IP) and is language independent. Users on Windows have the option of using STK programatically via OLE automation. Each analysis or design space within STK is called a scenario. Within each scenario any number of satellites, aircraft, targets, ships, communications systems or other objects can be created. Each scenario defines the default temporal limits to the child objects, as well as the base unit selection and properties. All of these properties can be overridden for each child object individually, as necessary. Only one scenario may exist at any one time, although data can be exported and reused in subsequent analyses. For each object within a scenario, various reports and graphics (both static and dynamic) may be created. Relative parameters, between one object and another can also be reported and the effect of real-world restrictions (constraints) enabled so that more accurate reporting is obtained. Through the use of the constellation and chains objects, multiple child objects may be grouped together and the multipath interactions between them investigated. AGI also offers software development kits for embedding STK capabilities into third- party applications or creating new applications based on AGI technology.  Modules  STK is a modular product, in much the same way as MATLAB and Simulink, and allows users to add modules to the baseline package to enhance specific functions.  Integration  STK can be embedded within another application (as an ActiveX component) or controlled from an external application (through TCP/IP or Component Object Model (COM)). Both integration techniques can make use of the connect scripting language to accomplish this task. There is also an object model for more \\"programmer oriented\\" integration methodologies. STK can be driven from a script that is run from the STK internal web browser in the free version of the tool. To control STK from an external source, or embed STK in another application requires the STK/Integration module.  Connect  Since connect is a messaging format, it has the advantage of being completely language independent. This allows applications and client tools to be created in the programming language of the user's or developer's choice. In practice, as long as it is possible to create a socket connection, send information through that socket and then receive information that way then STK can be controlled with connect using that language. Applications have been developed in C, C++, C#, Perl, Visual Basic, VBScript, Java, JavaScript and MATLAB. Examples can also be found in the STK help files or downloaded from the AGI website.

He wrote in Hebrew, Yiddish, and German; in 1819, he published the first Hebrew novel. Born and raised in the Austrian province of Galicia shortly after its annexation in the first partition of Poland, he was a follower of Hasidism in his youth. Later, he turned against Hasidism and became a proponent of Jewish emancipation and Haskalah, although he remained an observant Jew. He is best known for his many writings on Hasidism, ranging from critical treatises to parody. Youthful publisher In 1786, only 13 years old (This needs verification, as Mahler (in Hasidim and The Jewish Enlightenment p 125) dates this to 1816. Similarly, in the Hebrew Wikipedia page it says that Perl married at 14 and had positive interest in Hasidut), he wrote a book in German, Ueber das Wesen der Sekte Chassidim aus ihren eigenen Schriften gezogen (On the Nature of the Sect of the Hasidim, Drawn from Their Own Writings), in which he attempted to demonstrate the absurdity of the beliefs and practices of Hasidic rabbis, including Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav and Rabbi Shneur Zalman, founder of what became the Lubavitcher movement. His work was rejected by the imperial censors, who apparently feared that it would create disharmony among Austria's Jewish subjects. It was published in 1816. At the age of 14 he was engaged by his parents, but he continued living in his father's home. He studied Kabala and Hasidut, but his father, who was opposed to these studies, made him a merchant. This deeply affected his opinions regarding various subjects. Perl's satire of the Hasidic movement, Revealer of Secrets (Megalleh Temirim), is said to be the first modern novel in Hebrew. It was published in Vienna in 1819 under the pseudonym \\"Obadiah ben Pethahiah\\". Structured as an epistolary novel, it is currently in print only in an English translation, by Dov Taylor, published by Westview Press. It is an unusual book in that it satirizes the language and style of early Hasidic rabbis writing in Hebrew, which was not the vernacular of the Jews of its time. To make his work available and accessible to his contemporaries, Perl translated his own work into Yiddish. A subsequent parody of Hasidic writings, Words of the Righteous, written with Isaac Baer Levinsohn and published in 1830, is available in Hebrew. Educator According to Dov Taylor, in his introduction to his English translation of Revealer of Secrets, Perl denounced Hasidism not only in his writing but in memoranda to representatives of the Austrian Empire.Taylor, Dov (1997). \\"Introduction.\\" In: Joseph Perl's Revealer of Secrets: The first Hebrew novel. Translated by Taylor. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. p. xxvi. On March 22, 1838, Perl wrote a letter suggesting that the government censor Jewish libraries, prohibit meetings in Jewish ritual baths and close traditional Jewish schools, which he called \\"a place of refuge for vagabonds, thieves . . . a nest of demoralization and of . . . nefarious, scandalous deeds.\\"Cited in: Taylor (1997), p. xxvi. In certain memoranda written in later years Perl went so far as to attack particular Hasidic rebbes by name.Dauber, Jeremy (2004). Antonio's Devils: Writers of the Jewish Enlightenment and the Birth of Modern Hebrew and Yiddish Literature. Stanford, California: Stanford University Press. p. 213-214. As an educator, he was a founder of the Deutsch-Israelitische Hauptschule, a school for Jewish children which taught secular subjects such as history, geography, mathematics, and natural science in German, in addition to the Bible and Talmud. Death Joseph Perl, who ridiculed the ecstatic dancing and singing of the Hasidim, died on Simchat Torah (a holiday known in English as \\"rejoicing in the Torah\\"), a holy day traditionally ‚Äî and currently ‚Äî celebrated by song, dance and a processional through the streets carrying Torah scrolls, so the Galician Hasidim did not miss the opportunity to dance on Perl's fresh grave immediately after his burial.Dauber (2004), p. 214. Dauber draws a connection between the reported response of Hasidim to Perl's death and the fact that they likely were aware of his memoranda to the government: \\"Many of these memoranda were intended to be secret, for obvious reasons, but Perl's authorship became generally known, and it is said that Hasidim danced on Perl's fresh grave immediately after his burial.\\"Mahler, Rafael.

Following the Indonesian declaration of independence, tensions and fighting in the city of Bandung began to emerge between the newly formed Indonesian armed forces (People's Security Agency and its successors) and Indonesian nationalist youths on one side, with Japanese and British forces on the other. After initial success in Japanese attempts to gain control of the city in October, the arrival of British forces resulted in continued fighting, which initially resulted in a stalemate where Bandung was segregated into the British-controlled north and Indonesian-controlled south. Following an ultimatum to militarily evacuate South Bandung in March 1946, Indonesian forces conducted a general evacuation of the area involving hundreds of thousands of civilians, burning down various buildings and looting warehouses to deny British, and later Dutch, forces the use of the buildings and supplies. Prelude=Independence of Indonesia When on 17 August 1945 proclamation reached Bandung first via radio on the same day, around noon, with the news spreading throughout virtually the entire city by 19 August. Details about the event remained scarce for the first few days, until more information arrived. The sudden pronouncement left the existing social order largely intact for the first month or so, with the nationalist government establishing a local government unit (Komite Nasional Indonesia, KNI) in Bandung (i.e. the Priangan Regency) by 24 August. These committees were initially focused with spreading information about the independence and maintaining public order. Japanese occupation forces in the area had begun to disarm and disband the Japanese-trained, Pembela Tanah Air (PETA) Indonesian units as soon as 18 August. The discharged officers and personnel were then recruited into the Badan Keamanan Rakyat (People's Security Agency, BKR), the new armed forces of the nationalist government. Around late August and early September, some of the nationalist youths (pemuda) began to seize arms from Japanese forces ‚Äì in some cases involving murders, but largely through simple disarmament and in some cases voluntarily. Looting against Chinese and Eurasians of the city also began to occur. Revolution in Bandung and the 10 October affair The first British forces began arriving in Indonesia by around late September 1945, and by 25 September the nationalist government declared that all Indonesian civil servants were working for them. This resulted in an outburst of seizures of Japanese-controlled buildings and property. Takeovers were initially relatively peaceful, but soon more looting began to occur, primarily of military assets, with pemuda independently planning and launching attacks on Japanese posts or vehicles to capture weapons. By early October, disarmament of Japanese forces began to take a larger scale across the wider region. In some cases, disarmament was negotiated to be held in a mock mass assault against Japanese forces who would \\"surrender\\" and disarm in order to absolve Japanese forces of their responsibility to maintain order. In early October, the Japanese military commander in Bandung, Major General Mabuchi Itsuo, was negotiating a peaceful disarmament of his men. Throughout the first few days of the month, several arms factories and warehouses were seized by nationalists and on 8 October a large group of pemuda took over a Japanese airbase, taking control and disarming its guards with almost no resistance. On 10 October, a large assault by pemuda was launched against the local Kenpeitai headquarters ‚Äì seemingly spontaneously ‚Äì and the Japanese responded by calling in commanders of the local BKR for negotiations, before coercing them with bayonets to surrender and disperse the crowds. Throughout the day, the leaders were made to disperse attacks on Japanese posts while the Japanese setup barricades and posts, sweeping throughout Bandung within the following days and effectively retaking control of the city. A week later, the Japanese handed over control of the city to arriving British units of the 37th Indian Infantry Brigade. Following negotiations, British authorities agreed to rearm the Indonesian police. Reescalation of tensions Following the 10 October incident, revolutionary fervor in the city died down for around a month. During this time, the BKR reorganized into the TKR (People's Security Army/Tentara Keamanan Rakyat), with the 3rd division of its 1st army covering the Bandung region under the command of Arudji Kartawinata (former BKR commander of Priangan). The division itself was subdivided into five regiments, two of which were headquartered in Bandung proper (one later moved to the outskirts). Each of these regiments consisted of four battalions, typically comprising 500 to 1,000 men. Aside from these, there were also irregular units of pemuda organizations, ethnic militias, and Hizbullah units under Masyumi. By November, the European population of the city had also began to return, reaching 60,000 by late November or double the pre-WW2 figure (compared to some 436,000 Indonesians, Chinese and Eurasians) with 2,000 British and 1,500 Japanese troops. On the night of 24 November, the 3rd Division under Kartawinata was pressured by pemuda following the outbreak of the Battle of Surabaya to launch a general attack against British and Japanese troops ‚Äì which ended up being a relatively limited operation, with only scattered fighting in parts of the city. The following day, an incident occurred when a flash flood killed more than 200 people, with Indonesian forces engaging in rescue operations and British troops firing on them during the confusion that occurred. Within the following weeks, fighting intensified across the city with the British calling in an additional battalion of troops in early December, when most of the northern parts of Bandung were under British control. During this time, British supply trains and trucks travelling from Jakarta were subjected to raids ‚Äì in one occasion, a supply train arrived in Bandung on 21 November looted and without its Gurkha guards. The British commander issued an ultimatum to the local Indonesian governor demanding Indonesians (numbering some 100,000) to evacuate North Bandung on 27 November ‚Äì which the governor rejected. Later, the nationalist government compromised, agreeing to move \\"elements which disturbed peace\\". In effect, significant civilian movements occurred, due to pressure from European inhabitants backed by British forces. Some form of a boundary eventually formed between Indonesian and British/Indian forces, though there were significant desertions of the Indian troops and the Gurkha units would trade weapons for food items. As the British asserted control over North Bandung, around 100,000 Indonesians evacuated the area between November 1945 and March 1946. During the remaining days of 1945 and in early 1946, a relatively calm period ensued from the stalemate, with pemuda organizations continued to consolidate to form larger entities, and the 3rd Division saw a replacement of Kartawinata with Abdul Haris Nasution as commander. Sea of Fire The 23rd Indian Infantry Division was moved to Bandung on 16 February 1946, and some fighting began to erupt again in early March. On 22 March, British authorities notified then-Prime Minister of Indonesia Sutan Sjahrir that they were planning a military operation in Bandung, requesting him to evacuate the city of armed forces to prevent fighting ‚Äì specifically, the British requested that all armed Indonesian units removed from an area within eleven kilometers of the city center. Major General Douglas Hawthorn, commander of the 23rd Division, announced on the radio on the afternoon the following day of the demands, requiring South Bandung to be evacuated of military forces while asking civilians to remain. He set a deadline of midnight the following day for the evacuation. Indonesian leaders such as Nasution requested a delay in the deadline ‚Äì nominally to organize the movement of people but primarily to move supplies and equipment ‚Äì but this was rejected by Hawthorn. Faced with evacuation, the regimental commanders in the city opted-in the afternoon the following day for a total general evacuation of South Bandung, in a scorched earth move intended to be a revolutionary gesture. On 4 p.m. that day, Nasution (who had approved of the plan) announced that the entire half of the city was to be evacuated by 8 p.m. ‚Äì though some scorched earth actions had been conducted as early as the previous evening. Various figures were given for the affected population within the eleven kilometer limit ‚Äì from 200,000 given by Merdeka newspaper a month after the event to 500,000 estimated by American historian John Smail (including those living in villages outside Bandung). British historian John Newsinger wrote that a third to half of the city were razed to the ground, and 250,000 were evacuated. As the civilians left the city, the Pemuda started fires and detonated dynamites to destroy the city's buildings ‚Äì though most of the involved soldiers were inexperienced with demolition and instead opted to loot the warehouses or distribute the contents to the public; most of the flames originated from private homes and lighter buildings. Chinese residents were particularly hard-hit by the looting and burning, and many moved north instead of the countryside. Aftermath and legacy The loss of Bandung itself resulted in significant military and psychological blow to the nationalist government, with the newly arrived Dutch forces being handed control of Bandung from the British on 17 April. American historian John Smail, who visited Bandung 18 months after the event, described South Bandung as \\"a dead city with grass growing in its streets\\", through Dutch authorities did not calculate the exact figure of losses. The conflict in the larger area continued, with continued damage in the countryside surrounding Bandung. Nasution, when later questioned on why he did not hold the city, argued that he did not want to sacrifice his units and had opted to conduct guerilla warfare in the city with his still relatively intact battalions. Scorched earth tactics employed in Bandung were later used elsewhere during the revolution by Nasution ‚Äì and later Army Commander Sudirman, who created the Strategic Order No. 1 (Perintah Siasat No. 1) ordering scorched earth tactics to delay enemy attacks, especially during later Dutch military actions. In the immediate aftermath of the events, only around 16,000 Indonesians still lived in North Bandung, with \\"practically none\\" living in the south, compared to the official figure of 380,000 in August 1945. Though the population of Bandung was estimated as 480,000 in 1945, it fell to around 100,000 by 1946 due to the fighting and the destruction, though it had recovered to over 640,000 by 1950. Despite the massive population displacement of Indonesians, the movement of the Chinese population to the northern parts of the city further complicated the overcrowding already there. This issue became more pronounced after the Darul Islam rebellion in 1948, when a large number of refugees moved to Jakarta and Bandung. When many of the March 1946 evacuees returned to the city, they found their houses occupied by new residents ‚Äì who in some cases had managed to obtain a residential permit from the government. During the fires, an Indonesian journalist based in Tasikmalaya recorded the events from a hill in Garut and published an article in the 26 March issue of the Soeara Merdeka newspaper ‚Äì initially titled Bandoeng Djadi Laoetan Api (Bandung Becomes Sea of Fire), but shortened to Bandoeng Laoetan Api (Bandung Sea of Fire) ‚Äì the name the event is known by today. Soon after the event, Ismail Marzuki composed the song Halo, Halo Bandung, which became a major popular impression of the events in Indonesia. A monument commemorating the event was erected in Bandung in 1981. The Gelora Bandung Lautan Api Stadium, the largest stadium in the province, was named after the event.

Though never a champion himself, during his career he met three of the division‚Äôs greatest fighters, Joe Gans, who he defeated(K.O. 23rd round), Frank Erne, who he lost to in a 25 round decision and George ‚ÄúKid‚Äù Lavigne, who he also defeated(K.O. 19th Round), were all world champions at some point in their careers.  ‚ÄúElbows‚Äù  The moniker of Elbows was bestowed upon McFadden for two reasons: # he used his knobby joints to defend himself with the efficiency of a stone wall; # if he could not hit an opponent with his gloved fist, he did it with his elbows McFadden‚Äôs favorite trick was to start a roundhouse with either hand towards the jaw, ostensibly missing as his glove swished harmlessly past his opponent‚Äôs chin. His elbow, however, did not miss. It would crack flush onto the mouth with a squishing of lips and a smashing of teeth. This set up the poor innocent for a follow up punch with the other glove ‚Äì and this was the punch that often ended the fight. So crafty was McFadden in employing this manoeuvre that referees often missed seeing it, or couldn‚Äôt prove it if they did. In his latter years, before he died, McFadden freely admitted using the tactic. ‚ÄúIt won me,‚Äù smiled the aging McFadden genially, ‚Äúa lot of fights‚Äù. New York Journal sportswriter and cartoonist Thomas A. Dorgan agreed. ‚ÄúMcFadden should use four gloves in the ring,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúOne on each fist and one on each elbow!‚Äù Another favourite tactic of McFadden, who was certainly not afraid of fouling, was to heel an opponent with the open glove.  Boxing career  The use of these somewhat nefarious strategies is to take nothing away from McFadden the boxer, however. With or without his elbows, McFadden was one of the truly great fighters of his era, an era which spawned many of the great fistic giants in gloved boxing. Of his 97 recorded bouts, McFadden won 45, lost 12, and drew 21, with 25 of his victories coming by way of knockout. McFadden also engaged in at least fifty other contests that were not recorded. A Champion in any other era McFadden was such a good fighter that if he had been of another era he might well have been champion. But he made the crucial mistake of being born during the age of three of the most phenomenal lightweights ever to lace on a glove: Joe Gans, Frank Erne, and Kid Lavigne. Within a period of six months between April and October, 1899, McFadden took on all three of these great champions, knocking two of them out (Gans and former champ Lavigne), and coming close to beating the third (Erne) in his first title fight. McFadden‚Äôs finest win was the first in this series, and came when he took on, and defeated Gans (whom he fought seven times), on April 14, 1899, winning by way of a 23rd-round knockout. Gans (‚ÄúThe Old Master‚Äù) was favoured four-to-one in the betting, and up to that point had never been knocked out in his career. He had gone eight years unbeaten until that evening, when a terrific McFadden left hook to the body followed by a short right to the chin brought him crashing face down to the canvas. In a time when boxing champions sometimes made less money than a good plumber, McFadden was back at work the day after his greatest victory, refusing to answer the questions of sports reporters until after working hours, lest his boss should catch him and have him fired. Post-boxing Career After he retired in 1908, McFadden opened a gymnasium in Manhattan, where he catered to financial lights such as the Morgans, Goulds, Whitneys and others. It is estimated that during the course of a single day, the ownership of half of New York passed through the posh portals of Elbows‚Äô gym. An entrepreneur, as late as 1938, at age 66, McFadden was selling a course on ‚ÄúHow to Increase Your Height‚Äù at his gymnasium. McFadden died on August 30, 1948 at the age of 73, while traveling from Buffalo, New York to Michigan. He was struck by a trailer, suffered two broken legs and multiple fractures from the accident. He was taken to Geneva Community Hospital where he shortly after died from those injuries. He was survived by 8 daughters and sons.

Named for former Governor Harry F. Byrd, the legislation was originally presented as measure to relieve the financial pressures of the Great Depression upon the counties, as the state offered to take over responsibility and control of most county roads, creating the Virginia Secondary Roads System. Under state auspices, much was accomplished in improving the state's roads, most of which were not hard-surfaced when the system was created. However, lack of local control and accountability over roads became much more of an issue late in the 20th century, especially in fast-growing counties. Following a study commissioned by the Virginia Department of Transportation in 1998, which found the arrangement to be \\"unusual among the 50 states\\", the state legislature in the early 21st century was considering major changes to afford more local control in the counties over such issues as drainage, speed limits, and planning and coordination of roads with development. History The Byrd Road Act created the state's \\"Secondary System\\" of roads in the counties. Virginia's incorporated towns were provided a local option to participate, and all the counties in Virginia were given the option of turning this responsibility over to the state. However, Virginia's independent cities were excluded, typical of the Byrd Organization and its leader's rural priorities and political power base. Only four counties of more than 90 initially opted not to join the system. Of these, Nottoway County opted to join the state system in 1933, and in the 1950s, Warwick County became an independent city and was then consolidated with another, forming the modern City of Newport News. (By the end of the 20th century, only Arlington and Henrico Counties continued to maintain their own roads.) Generally, when an area became part of an independent city, through annexation, merger, consolidation, or conversions, the secondary roads passed from the state system to local responsibility. An exception was made by the General Assembly in the former Nansemond County, which like Warwick County, became an independent city (in 1972) and then 18 months later, consolidated with neighboring Suffolk in 1974. Under that special arrangement, VDOT maintained secondary routes in Suffolk until July 1, 2006. This arrangement eventually led to new conflicts over ownership and responsibility for the circa 1928 Kings Highway Bridge across the Nansemond River on State Route 125, which was closed in 2005 by VDOT for safety reasons. Aaron Applegate, VDOT, city of Suffolk battle over closed Kings Highway Bridge , The Virginian-Pilot, May 1, 2006 Accomplishments and problems Variations in the quality of secondary state highways. All photos in this montage were taken on State Route 715 in Franklin County; some spots are unsuitable for small cars (left), while others are good-quality highways (right) In the years after 1932, the state worked diligently on secondary roads. In 1932, there were only of hard-surfaced secondary roads, out of almost . By 1972, there were only of unpaved secondary roads in Virginia's system. The state's secondary roads system had also grown by 30% from its original size, despite the large geographical areas (and miles of roadway) lost over the years to expanding and additional independent cities and incorporated towns. In the years from 1952 to 1976, virtually all of the counties in the extreme southeastern portion of the state in the Hampton Roads region became consolidated into independent cities; Princess Anne County, Norfolk County, Nansemond County, Elizabeth City County, and Warwick County all became extinct, although as previously noted, Warwick County was never in the state secondary road system, and the areas of Suffolk that had been Nansemond County received a special exception to stay in the system for an additional 30 years, which ended in 2006. In most other areas of the state, additional towns became incorporated and/or converted to independent city status, and both groups grew in territory, primarily through annexations, such as large portions of Chesterfield County that were annexed by the City of Richmond in 1944 and 1970. However, despite VDOT's (and its predecessor agencies') accomplishments, the relationship between the counties and the state highway officials since 1932 has always been somewhat strained. The 1932 Act took not only financial responsibility from the counties and transferred it to the state, but power and authority as well. Under the Code of Virginia, as amended, \\"The Boards of Supervisors or other governing bodies...shall have no control, supervision, management, and jurisdiction over...the secondary system of state highways\\" (¬ß33.1-69). Considering changes in structure, local control Late in the 20th century, the problems inherent in this arrangement became especially apparent with regards to the secondary roads system in many fast-growing suburban counties outside incorporated towns and cities. A state-sponsored study in 1998 focusing on 14 of the fastest-growing counties identified such issues as drainage, speed limits, and planning and coordination of roads with development as those local leaders felt should be within their ability to control, while the authority to do so was in fact, held by a state agency instead. Citizens seeking accountability, accused both the various county and VDOT officials of finger-pointing. According to the report, \\"Such an arrangement is unusual among the 50 states.\\" In the early 21st century, the Virginia General Assembly was considering legislation to allow some counties to choose to resume control and care for the secondary highways within their boundaries. James City County, with a population that grew by 56% between 1980 and 1990 according to the 1998 VDOT study, was reported by the local news media to be under consideration for a pilot project of this type. Similarly, in 2009 Fairfax County Chairman Sharon Bulova and County Executive Anthony H. Griffin proposed changing Fairfax County into an Independent City in order to regain local control of the county's secondary roads.

Although passenger services through the town ceased on 10 February 2002, Edendale had been served by some of New Zealand's premier passenger trains ‚Äì first the South Express, then the South Island Limited, and finally the Southerner. Edendale was a railway junction for almost eighty years. On 2 October 1882, a branch line from the South Island Main Trunk, the Wyndham Branch, was opened from Edendale to Wyndham on the opposite side of the Mataura River. On 1 May 1890, this line was extended to Glenham. Traffic was light from the beginning, with the extension to Glenham closed on 14 July 1930 and passenger services to Edendale ‚Äì originally provided by mixed trains and then by RM class Model T Ford railcars ‚Äì were cancelled on 9 February 1931. By the late 1950s, the line to Wyndham was essentially just an extension of the Edendale railway yard and insufficient quantities of freight meant that the line was closed just weeks before its eightieth anniversary and Edendale ceased to be a railway junction on 9 September 1962. Edendale has a milk processing plant operated by Fonterra which was originally operated by the Southland Dairy Co-operative. The Edendale milk processing plant was a cheese processing plant but in the 1990s expanded to include milk powder processing. The plant has been expanded several times since and was in 2009 the largest raw milk processing plant in the world. Edendale was originally an estate of the New Zealand and Australian Land Company, who surveyed the township and sold it in lots. The estate contained over 120,000 acres. In the course of years the company sold 80,000 acres to hundreds of farmers. The homestead of the Edendale estate was bought in 1902 by its former manager, Mr Donald Macdonald. Macdonald was instrumental in advocating the use of lime on the soils of Southland which vastly improved their quality. The Edendale Homestead is a Category I building listed by the Historic Places Trust. Built circa 1882, the attractive homestead is approach by a mile long drive through a beautiful and mature avenue of native trees, such as totara, black and white kahikatea and matai. Descendants of Mr Macdonald continue to own the property. In the main centre of Edendale, there are several small businesses and operations. These include a butcher, a dairy, a garage, a post office and a primary school. Edendale Primary School is a semi-rural school with students from year 0 through to year 6 whose population has thrived through the expansion of the milk processing plant, with a current roll of about 120 students.

It has large ears and eyes, a long tail and rusty-brown fur, and it feeds mostly on insects and seeds. This description is based on mice captured during a biological survey conducted in 1994 and 1995 high on the steep slopes of one of the island's volcanoes. In April, 2006, the new mammal, a Philippine forest mouse, now identified as Apomys camiguinensis was captured on the steep slopes of a volcano of Camiguin during a biological survey by Heaney and Tabaranza. In 2002, Heaney, Tabaranza, and Eric Rickart (from the Utah Museum of Natural History), described a different species of forest-living rodent, Bullimus gamay, from Mt. Timpoong, the same mountain where the new mouse was collected. A frog (Oreophryne nana) named in 1967 had been thought to be the only vertebrate restricted to the island prior to the surveys by Heaney and Tabaranza.

This left Jickling as the only lawyer in Adelaide, South Australia's capital; consequently, he was appointed an acting judge while Jeffcott was gone. Jeffcott, however, died at sea on 12 December 1837, leaving Jickling in charge of the Court. Although appointed as a caretaker judge, Jickling was responsible for two important issues: he codified the testamentary causes jurisdiction of the Court and admitted the first practitioners of the Court, in March 1838. Jickling was also a member of the South Australian Legislative Council. After Charles Cooper arrived as the Chief Justice of South Australia, Jickling ceased to be a judge, and practised at the bar for some years, until he was appointed to the office of Master of the Court, in which position he remained for some years until he retired on the pension then open to all Government officers who had served for a certain period, and returned to England.

Triage focuses on the psychological effects of war on the photo journalist protagonist, Mark. Plot summary Mark Walsh, a young war photographer, returns to New York in 1989 after being injured in Kurdistan whilst on assignment. He had spent a few frightening days in the recovery ward of a dilapidated, overcrowded hospital inside a cave, but can this explain his sleeplessness, distraction, his wounds' inability to heal? Elena, Mark's Spanish girlfriend, grows more and more alarmed by his strange behavior, while she also tries to calm her pregnant friend Diane, whose photographer husband has gone missing in the same war zone. As Mark continues to deteriorate, Elena's grandfather sweeps onto the scene. Joaquin is the last person from whom Elena wants to accept help; once very close to him, she ended all contact after learning of his role in \\"purifying\\" conscience-stricken officers after the Spanish Civil War. In treating Mark, Joaquin sees a way back into his granddaughter's life, and, despite Elena's disapproval, the two men begin to forge an extraordinary relationship. Eventually, all three travel to Joaquin's manor home in Granada, Spain so that Mark can find a safe haven in which to heal. It is in this romantic and haunted Spanish valley where both men's secrets surface with life-altering force and where Mark and Elena attempt to know and love each other again, with the discovery of her grandfather's secrets of the incurables and of Mark's knowing that Colin is dead and that he could not save him.

Career  Dempster began his career as a cadet on the Maryborough Chronicle in Queensland, and moved to Brisbane's Telegraph, where he became the paper's chief political reporter. In 1982 he was awarded the Australian Journalists' Association's gold honour badge for meritorious service.  ABC  Dempster joined the ABC in 1984, and was widely acclaimed for his reporting of the Fitzgerald Inquiry in Queensland and the Wood Royal Commission into the NSW Police Service. After joining the ABC he wrote and produced The Sunshine System, a documentary on institutionalised corruption in the Sunshine State, which exposed how senior police made hundreds of thousands of dollars a year from bribes and kickbacks linked to organised crime. The Sunshine System's revelations gave impetus to calls for a commission of inquiry into political and police corruption. The inquiry, headed by Tony Fitzgerald QC, ran from 1987 to 1989, and Dempster's re-enactments and analysis on the national 7.30 Report program brought the issue to a wide audience. In 1990, Dempster moved to Sydney to become the 7.30 Report's NSW presenter, heading a national investigative unit for the program in 1995 and covering the Wood Royal Commission into police corruption south of the Tweed. Dempster was made a member of the Order of Australia in 1992 for services to the media. In 2002 he was awarded the Walkley Award for outstanding contribution to journalism. On 28 November 2014, Dempster said he would present the final edition of 7.30 NSW \\"next Friday\\", promising the show would go out \\"with a bang\\". Dempster made the announcement at the end of 28 November's Friday night's 7.30 NSW program, a show which was being axed under the ABC cuts strategy outlined by managing director Mark Scott that week. \\"After almost 20 years the ABC is discontinuing your local show. Thank you for your support, stories ideas and constructive criticism over all this time,\\" Dempster told viewers. \\"I will be leaving the ABC after 30 years. It has been an honour to work with Australia's great and unique public broadcaster. Next week we'll be going out with bang, so, hope to see you then. Bye bye.\\" Dempster was asked by Nick Grimm on The World Today: \\"We'll be seeing you, I take it, this week on the New South Wales edition of 7.30?\\" He replied: \\"I'm waiting to get my white envelope, so I expect so. I'm sure I would have been told if my services weren't required for the next two scheduled programs of 7.30 New South Wales.\\" ABC director of news Kate Torney said Dempster's departure was a \\"huge loss\\" and described his coverage of corruption in Queensland and New South Wales as \\"exemplars of the fearless and forensic journalism which has earned Quentin the respect and admiration of his peers and the gratitude of his viewers\\". \\"Quentin is much loved and highly respected by audiences and colleagues alike. He has helped shape the ABC, on and off screen, over more than three decades,\\" she said in a statement. \\"The public is aware of Quentin's outstanding track record as an award-winning journalist. What they don't see is his commitment behind the scenes in mentoring, encouraging and guiding colleagues. He is passionate about the craft and role of journalism and is always keen to share his experience with those around him.\\" \\"He will be much missed. On behalf of the broader ABC family, I wish him and his family all the best for the future.\\" In recent times he has been an outspoken critic of the Federal Government's cuts to the ABC, describing planned job cuts as \\"industrial executions\\" and calling then Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull a \\"bullshit artist\\".

The project was intended to be developed by Preston Tithebarn Partnership, a 50/50 joint venture between Grosvenor and Lend Lease Corporation in partnership with Preston City Council. In October 2005, Preston City Council and Grosvenor signed an agreement to go ahead with the Tithebarn regeneration project as part of Council's broader plans for Preston city. Tithebarn was objected to by neighbouring councilsThe case against Tithebarn and the scheme was abandoned in 2011. History Preston Bus Station In 2000, opposition to the demolition of the existing Preston bus station led to an application to English Heritage for listed building status (as an example of 1960s brutalist architecture). Preston Borough Council among others opposed the application which ultimately was unsuccessful. Putting forward the case for a smaller terminus, a report, commissioned by the council and Grosvenor, stated that \\"buses arriving and leaving the bus station have very low bus occupancy rates indicating that passengers alight and board elsewhere in the city centre. The bus station car park similarly suffers from the poor pedestrian linkages.\\" The project The Preston Tithebarn project was to cover an area of approximately in Preston city centre and include a John Lewis department store, a new Marks and Spencer department store, revitalised markets, restaurants, cafes, new cinemas, around 100 new shops, offices, homes, refurbished Guild Hall, a new bus station and extensive new public spaces and pedestrianised streets. Development events In January 2007, John Lewis confirmed it would anchor the development with a department store. In 2008 they released designs for the flagship store on their website. Pre-planning public consultation for the Preston Tithebarn project was conducted by Preston Tithebarn Partnership between May 2008 and June 2008, and thereafter by appointment. The Preston Tithebarn Information Centre at 50-52 Lancaster Road, Preston (next to the Guild Hall) was created for the public consultation where visitors were able to view plans, information and a 3D model. Preston Tithebarn Partnership submitted a hybrid planning application to Preston City Council in September 2008. All development within the application boundary was submitted with some matters reserved, except for the 1875 Covered Market and Fish Market for which full details were submitted. In October 2008, Marks and Spencer confirmed it would join Preston Tithebarn as the second anchor, with plans to build a store. In December 2008, Cineworld Cinemas also confirmed it would join Preston Tithebarn, with plans to build a new multi-screen cinema. On 14 July 2009, following 2 days of presentations, questioning and debate, Preston City Council Planning Committee approved the application. The matter proceeded to Government Office North West. In November 2011 the scheme was abandoned after department store John Lewis pulled out. Listed building status In January 2010 an application by The Twentieth Century Society to have the bus station registered as listed building was rejected by the Secretary of State which paved the way for the public enquiry into the Tithebarn development to proceed. In May and June 2010 a Public enquiry was held into the Preston Tithebarn Project.

The manga was originally serialized by Shueisha in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump under the title and was collected in five volumes; a three-volume collection was released by Shueisha in Japan in 2002, and by Viz Media in North America in 2014. It was followed by Battle Tendency. The story is set in England in the early-to-late 1880s, and follows Jonathan Joestar, the heir of the wealthy Joestar family, and his adoptive brother Dio Brando, who wishes to take the Joestar fortune for himself. Using an ancient stone mask, Dio transforms himself into a vampire, and Jonathan learns the sunlight-based martial arts technique of to fight him. Araki described the themes of the story as \\"being alive\\" and \\"an affirmation that humanity is wonderful\\", with characters growing and overcoming problems through their own actions. The series received reviews ranging from mixed to positive, with critics frequently criticizing the anatomy and character posing in Araki's artwork, and Araki was often told during the serialization that Phantom Blood was the one series that did not fit in with the \\"best of the best\\" that were published at the same time, like Dragon Ball and Fist of the North Star. The series has seen two anime adaptations, in the form of a 2007 film by A.P.P.P., and as part of the first season of David Production's 2012 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure TV series. It was also adapted into a 2006 video game by Bandai. Plot In 19th-century England, a youth born into poverty named Dio Brando is adopted by the wealthy George Joestar to repay a family debt to Dio's father Dario, who died in 1880. Jonathan Joestar, who aspires to become a gentleman, is shunned by his family and friends, whom Dio manipulates as part of his plot to take the Joestar fortune for himself. After Jonathan overpowers Dio in a battle, Dio gets revenge by murdering Jonathan's pet dog Danny, before biding his time. Jonathan and Dio develop an interest in a mysterious stone mask that reacted to Dio's blood being spilt in the battle, which was used by the Aztecs to bring the wearer immortality. In 1888, after becoming old enough to inherit the Joestar fortune, Dio deliberately poisons George. Jonathan's search for an antidote takes him to Ogre Street, a dangerous street in London, where he befriends a thug named Robert E. O. Speedwagon. At the same time, Dio intends to arrange a freak accident to kill Jonathan with the stone mask and tests the mask on a drunkard. The mask instead turns the drunkard into a powerful vampire who nearly kills Dio before being destroyed by sunlight. Jonathan and Speedwagon return to the mansion with an antidote and expose Dio's scheme. Dio attempts to kill Jonathan with a knife but George sacrifices his life to save Jonathan. Dio uses the blood spilt by George and the mask to become a vampire. Jonathan sets the Joestar family's mansion on fire and impales Dio on a statue in the burning mansion, but Dio survives. Will A. Zeppeli, a man who intends to destroy the stone mask after it caused his father's death, teaches Jonathan how to use a supernatural energy produced by controlled breathing called Then, on November 30, 1888, Jonathan, Speedwagon, and Zeppeli travel to Wind Knights Lot, where Dio is creating an army of zombies. Zeppeli is mortally wounded by one of these zombies, Tarkus, and passes the last of his Hamon energy on to Jonathan before dying. Joined by Zeppeli's fellow Hamon users, on December 1, 1888, Jonathan destroys Dio's body by sending Hamon directly through him. Dio decapitates his head to survive the Hamon attack. Speedwagon destroys the stone mask. On February 2, 1889, Jonathan marries his childhood love Erina. The next day, they leave on a ship to America on their honeymoon. Dio sneaks aboard the ship, intending to transplant himself onto Jonathan's body. On February 7, 1889, Dio mortally wounds Jonathan. Jonathan uses the last of his Hamon to manipulate the body of Dio's servant Wang Chan into obstructing the ship's paddle wheel, setting it to explode. Jonathan dies with Dio's head in his arms. Erina escapes in the coffin that Dio hid in with a dead passenger's baby girl. Rescued near the Canary Islands two days later, Erina vows to pass on the truth of Jonathan's life to her unborn child and the generations to follow. Production Bernini's sculpture Apollo and Daphne.alt=A photograph of the sculpture Apollo and Daphne, depicting one woman and one man. Phantom Blood was written and drawn by Hirohiko Araki. Prior to working on the series, he created a manga that resembled the works of Hisashi Eguchi, an artist known for his art of female characters; Araki's editor, Ry≈çsuke Kabashima, angrily told Araki to never draw something as derivative again, which led him to take another direction with his art, and the creation of Phantom Blood. Due to the popularity of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone at the time, Araki designed characters with muscular body types. The character posing, which Araki considers is distinctive about his art, was influenced by a trip to Italy just before the serialization of Phantom Blood, where he went to the Galleria Borghese in Rome and saw Gian Lorenzo Bernini's sculpture Apollo and Daphne. Seeing it in person from different angles had a large influence on him; he described it as overwhelmingly beautiful and intense, and unlike sculptures in Japanese museums and the figure posing of most manga artists. Structure and themes Phantom Blood was created using a ki-sh≈ç-ten-ketsu structure ‚Äì introduction (ki), development (sh≈ç), twist (ten), and resolution (ketsu) ‚Äì along with the rule of rising and falling, in which the hero must grow over time in relation to their starting point in the beginning of the story, and not stagnate or regress. Araki did however note that due to the weekly format of the series, Jonathan's initial regression when Dio turns Jonathan's happy life into hardships meant that Jonathan's growth remained in the negative for a few weeks after the series' premiere, leading to a negative feeling that Jonathan always loses. Araki implemented a similar growth curve for Dio, although with him rising towards evil. Despite following the rule of the ever-progressing hero, Araki decided to bend the rule and have Jonathan die to save his wife and child: he acknowledged that dying is as far negative as a hero can go, and called it unthinkable to do such a thing in a sh≈çnen manga, but said that since he wanted to pass down the Joestar family's lineage, he needed Jonathan to die, and for his blood and spirit to be passed to Joseph, the protagonist of Battle Tendency, the second part in the series. While calling it a gamble, he called this passing of the torch a positive that enables the extreme negative of killing the first protagonist. The themes of Phantom Blood were described by Araki as \\"being alive\\" and \\"an affirmation that humanity is wonderful\\". He explained the latter as a description for humanity's ability to grow and overcome hardships through one's strength and spirit; this is a recurring theme that has been used in all following parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, portrayed through people succeeding in fights through their own actions, without relying on machines or gods. This theme, along with the passing of the torch, was influenced by Araki's grandfather's death near the start of the serialization, and his thoughts about how people leave parts of themselves behind for the next generation when they die. Wanting readers to know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue involving the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of Hamon was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he came up with the idea of a character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them. Creation of characters alt=A grayscale 1939 photograph of painter Salvador Dal√≠ As part of the creation of each character, Araki wrote down a fictional history for the character, to prevent inconsistencies; while not all information he writes in these is used directly in the manga, it helps him determine how the character should act and react in different situations. Jonathan and Dio, the protagonist and antagonist, were created with the duality of light and shadow in mind, with the intention to have them contrast against each other: Dio was depicted as an embodiment of evil, and Jonathan as \\"fundamentally virtuous\\" and just. Araki also made use of black and white in his art to further contrast the two. Jonathan was designed to be a symbol for the story and setting, something Araki would continue doing with later protagonists in the series. Because Araki wanted the series to move on with new characters in the Joestar family, Jonathan was specifically written as \\"the first Joestar\\" that would function as a symbol of purity and dignity, and not as a unique character. This limited what Jonathan could do; in retrospect, Araki considered him passive and \\"a bit boring\\". From the start of the planning of the manga, Araki intended to depict Dio as a \\"cool\\" character who descends into villainy. Thinking that it could be difficult to create an evil antagonist that readers would empathize with, Araki wrote Dio as coming from a poor family with a father \\"with no redeeming qualities whatsoever\\", giving Dio motivation to acquire power and get revenge on the world even if it led him to do immoral and illegal things. Araki also noted that a character who acts without regard for morals and laws can give readers a feeling of catharsis due to exhibiting the same \\"ugly feelings\\" people hold but cannot show, making Dio more easily relatable than a character who only does good. Dio's name was taken directly from the Italian word for \\"god\\", and was chosen to sound good together with the name \\"JoJo\\". The main supporting character of Phantom Blood, Zeppeli, was created as a \\"silly teacher\\" in the style of the martial art masters from Jackie Chan's films and The Karate Kid, with a charm in the contrast between how they appear and who they are inside. Araki designed him with a mustache, drawing inspiration from the appearances of the painter Salvador Dal√≠ and the Osomatsu-kun character Iyami; this was considered a gamble, as mustachioed characters in sh≈çnen magazines were considered to appear old and untrustworthy, potentially turning readers off. His name comes from the rock band Led Zeppelin, and was chosen to balance out the large amount of names in the series beginning with \\"J\\"; the character Speedwagon was given his name for the same reason. Release and related media Phantom Blood was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump under the title JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 1 Jonathan Joestar: His Youth. It ran from January 1 to October 26, 1987 for a total of 44 chapters, and was later collected in five tank≈çbon volumes. It was also collected in a three-volume bunkoban collection on February 15, 2002, and a single volume s≈çsh≈´hen edition in 2012. Another three-volume collection with new cover art by Araki was released from December 4, 2013 to January 4, 2014 as part of the JoJonium line, along with the second and third part of the series, Battle Tendency and Stardust Crusaders. This version was released in North America by Viz Media, beginning digitally in 2014 and in print in 2015. A digitally colored version of the complete manga was released digitally for smartphones and tablet computers in Japan on July 13, 2012. To celebrate the series' anniversary, a video game adaptation was released in 2006 by Bandai for the PlayStation 2, and a Phantom Blood anime film adaptation, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Phantom Blood, was produced by A.P.P.P. and released in Japanese theaters in 2007. The film has never been released on home video. The owarai duo Speedwagon (Jun Itoda and Kazuhiro Ozawa), who took their name from the Phantom Blood character, make cameo appearances in the film as Dario Brando and Wang Chen. Phantom Blood was again adapted into anime in 2012, as part of the first season of David Production's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure TV anime series. Volumes=Original release2002 release2012 release2013 release=Reception Phantom Blood was met with reviews ranging from critical to positive. According to Araki, he was often told during the original serialization of the manga that it was the one series that did not fit in with the \\"best of the best\\" that were serialized at the same time, such as Dragon Ball, Fist of the North Star, Captain Tsubasa, Kinnikuman and Saint Seiya. Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump readers were critical of the first few chapters, finding Jonathan unlikable as he kept losing against Dio at that point. The series was included in Anime News Network list of the best and most memorable manga of 2015, as the winner in the \\"WTF Did I Just Read?!\\" category. Joseph Luster at Otaku USA called Phantom Blood \\"a treat\\" for both new and old readers of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, but thought that it feels slow-paced compared to Stardust Crusaders. Ziah Grace and Clair Napier of ComicsAlliance were very critical of the series, calling it \\"meaningless junk\\" that should not have been republished in 2015, and recommended readers to read a plot summary of Phantom Blood and start with Battle Tendency instead. They criticized the series' depiction of animal cruelty, and the \\"bad or non- existent\\" female roles in the story. Anime News Network Rebecca Silverman appreciated the realism in how Dio appears perfectly mannered to George while also being sadistically cruel, and how the series uses a mix between Aztec mythology and vampire lore, but thought that the story could be too cruel for some readers, citing the animal cruelty as an example. She liked how the story escalates in intensity and weirdness, but criticized it for telling more often than showing, and using exclamation marks too much. Several reviewers criticized the artwork in Phantom Blood for the characters' anatomy and posing; Silverman described it as featuring impossible poses and characters appearing to have disproportionally small heads atop large, muscled bodies. She additionally criticized the art for being crowded and hard to read. ComicsAlliance disliked how the art felt derivative of Fist of the North Star. Takato at Manga-News thought that the anatomy and posing, while fitting the tone of the story, were unlikely and badly drawn. Luster thought that the art was not nearly as good as Araki's later works, but that it was charming and worked despite the \\"twisted proportions\\" due to its high intensity and stylization. Kory Cerjak at The Fandom Post enjoyed the artwork, however, calling it \\"straight out of the 80s\\", giving the series a similar feeling to watching a good action film from that time period. The box set for the three- volume JoJonium release of the series was the 47th best selling comic in Japan during its debut week according to Oricon, selling an estimated 19,374 copies. The three English volumes all charted on The New York Times Manga Best Seller list for three weeks in a row; volume 1 premiered in first place, and both volume 2 and 3 debuted in second place, after The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and Naruto volume 71, respectively.

The arc was preceded by Phantom Blood (1987) and followed by Stardust Crusaders (1989‚Äì1992). Set in North America and Europe in 1938‚Äì39, the story follows Joseph Joestar and Caesar Zeppeli, the descendants of Jonathan Joestar and Will A. Zeppeli from Phantom Blood who can manipulate a sunlight-based energy called Hamon. Along with the Hamon coach Lisa Lisa, Joseph and Caesar seek to prevent ancient humanoids called the Pillar Men, who invented the stone masks from Phantom Blood, from obtaining a powerful stone called the Super Aja, which would make them into ultimate beings and conquer their weakness of sunlight. In 2012, Battle Tendency was digitally colored and released as digital downloads for smartphones and tablet computers. A four- volume re-release under the title JoJonium was published between February 4 and May 2, 2014. This version was licensed and released in North America by Viz Media; beginning digitally in March 2015 and in print in November 2015. In its original publication, it was referred to as Battle Tendency was adapted as part of the first season of David Production's 2012 anime television series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.  Plot  In the series' backstory, 10,000 years ago, Kars, an underground-dwelling humanoid being known as a Pillar Man, created a stone mask which grants immortality by absorbing life energy to conquer the sun (which kills his kind). He slaughtered all but four of the tribe. As the Pillar Men's bodies were already immortal, they required more power for them to become ultimate beings. In 39 AD, three of the Pillar Men, Kars, Wamuu, and Esidisi, came to the Roman Empire to find a perfectly-cut known as the Kars, Wamuu, and Esidisi developed fighting styles to counter Hamon, an energy with the same properties as the energy from sunlight, and nearly wiped out the Hamon tribe, but the stone narrowly escaped them. Following this, the Pillar Men went into a 2,000-year sleep. In 1889, Erina Joestar's husband Jonathan lost his life on a ship in the Atlantic Ocean. Erina survived and saved the life of a baby girl, whose parents were killed by the stone mask. The girl, Elizabeth, was raised by the Hamon master Straizo, who taught her to use Hamon and gave her the Super Aja. Elizabeth married Erina's son George and they had a son called Joseph. When Joseph was a baby, George was killed by a zombie that blended in as a commander of the Royal Flying Corps and his death was covered up. Elizabeth killed the zombie and a warrant for her arrest was sent out. She went into hiding and adopted the alias Lisa Lisa. Joseph was raised by Erina. He inherited Hamon abilities from Jonathan. At the start of the series, in the fall of 1938, Joseph and Erina move from London to New York. Meanwhile, the oil baron Robert E. O. Speedwagon invites Straizo to Mexico to destroy a sleeping Pillar Man with Hamon. Straizo instead wounds Speedwagon, and uses a stone mask near the Pillar Man and Speedwagon's blood to become an immortal vampire. Straizo goes to New York to destroy Joseph and Erina, believed to be the last people who know about the stone mask. When Joseph defeats Straizo, Straizo tells him that the Pillar Man is about to awaken and he will meet the Pillar Man soon. Intrigued, Joseph goes to Mexico. Joseph saves Speedwagon, who survived, from the awakened Pillar Man named Santana, and tricks Santana into being turned to stone by the sunlight reflected from a well. Joseph and Speedwagon travel to Rome, where they meet Caesar Zeppeli, a man who trained in Hamon to continue the legacy of his father Mario and grandfather Will. However, the group arrives too late to prevent Kars, Wamuu, and Esidisi from awakening. Joseph plays on Wamuu's pride and convinces Wamuu to let him live to be a more worthy opponent. Both Wamuu and Esidisi implant poison-filled rings in his aorta and windpipe, giving Joseph 33 days to get the antidotes from each of them. Joseph and Caesar train in Hamon under Lisa Lisa on Air Suplena Island off the coast of Venice. Joseph and Caesar destroy Esidisi. The group tracks down Kars and Wamuu to Switzerland. Caesar is killed fighting Wamuu one-on-one, and takes the antidote for Joseph before dying. Joseph and Lisa Lisa then confront Kars and Wamuu for the Super Aja, Lisa Lisa bluffing that she has a timed explosive that will destroy the stone. Joseph kills Wamuu in battle. On February 28, 1939, Kars acquires the Super Aja and uses it along with the stone mask to become the ultimate being. Now immune to the sun and able to use Hamon, Kars's only desire is to kill Joseph. Joseph steals a Nazi plane and tries to crash it and Kars into the volcanic island of Vulcano. Joseph and Kars escape, but the shock of the plane crash causes a volcanic eruption. Kars attempts to kill Joseph with Hamon, but Joseph instinctively holds up the Super Aja, which causes the energy to make the eruption climax, sending Joseph and Kars flying into the sky on a large rock. Kars is knocked into space by volcanic debris. Unable to die, he drifts throughout space for eternity, eventually ceasing to think. Returning to Earth, Joseph is nursed to health by Lisa Lisa's assistant Suzi Q, whom he marries. In the epilogue, set in 1987, an aged Joseph takes a flight from John F. Kennedy International Airport to Japan, where his daughter and grandson live, leading in to the first chapters of the following story arc, Stardust Crusaders.  Characters  * is the main protagonist and grandson of Jonathan Joestar. Like Jonathan, he can use Hamon, though he is not initially as skilled in its use as Jonathan was. He initially uses a pair of Hamon-empowered clackers in battle, but he relies more on his wits than brute strength in fights, employing his uncanny ability to predict his opponent's actions down to what they will say next. Joseph makes return appearances in Stardust Crusaders and Diamond Is Unbreakable. * is a suave ladies' man and the grandson of Jonathan Joestar's teacher Will A. Zeppeli. He is rather cool and collected, especially compared to Joseph, with whom he is grudgingly paired to fight the Pillar Men. But over time, Joseph starts to grow on him so much that he is able to understand his strange thought patterns and they form an unbeatable duo. He infuses the Hamon into soap bubbles he creates with his specially-made gloves. * formerly is a mysterious Hamon master who lives in Venice. She is introduced as Caesar's Hamon teacher and later revealed to be the last surviving master of the Hamon Tribe as well as Joseph's mother. She fights by conducting Hamon through her specially made scarf. * is an ordinary pickpocket hailing from New York whose newfound friendship with Joseph Joestar places him at the spectator's seat of the battle against the Pillar Men. * is an ally of Joseph and an old friend of the Joestars. Since the events of Phantom Blood, Speedwagon has settled in America, where he became an oil tycoon and founded the Speedwagon Foundation in order to deal with paranormal threats such as the Stone Mask and, later, the Pillar Men. * is the commander of the Nazi forces who discovered Santana in Mexico. He is responsible for not only saving the life of Speedwagon, but also for trying to help Joseph defeat Santana by blowing himself up along with him. He returns later as a cyborg to assist in the fight against Kars and his army. * is one of the Pillar Men. Like the other Pillar Men, he uses a particular fighting style known as a \\"Mode\\". Esidisi's allows him to make his blood boil at and inject it into his foes to burn them alive by extending his needle-like blood vessels out of his own body. * is one of the Pillar Men and Kars's loyal servant, following a warrior's code of honor.

He was discovered by the Nazis in Mexico. Although he does not have a Mode, he is able to manipulate his body, allowing him to squeeze into tiny spaces and use his ribs as blades. He can also absorb other people into his own body. When awakened, Santana attempted to absorb Joseph Joestar and Stroheim, but he was turned into stone by the sun.

She felt positively about how strikingly different the protagonist Joseph is from Part 1's Jonathan.

A ten-volume hardcover re-release under the title JoJonium was published between June 4, 2014 and March 4, 2015. Viz Media initially released the sixteen-volume format of the arc in North America between 2005 and 2010. They began releasing the hardcover format in November 2016. It is the most popular arc of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series as it introduced the audience to the concept of Stands, which differentiated it from its predecessors. This popularity later spawned video games, a three volume drama CD series, two novels and two OVA series of this arc alone. An anime television adaptation by David Production, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, aired in Japan between April 2014 and June 2015. Stardust Crusaders also stands out as the only arc of the series to gain any notable western exposure prior to the release of the anime series by David Production in 2012, due to the 1993 OVA series, 1999 video game and the English releases of the manga in 2005‚Äì2010. Plot The story begins in 1988, centered on Jotaro Kujo, grandson of Joseph Joestar. Jotaro has been arrested, and refuses to leave his cell, believing he is possessed by an evil spirit. After being called by Holly, Joseph's daughter and Jotaro's mother, Joseph arrives with an associate, Mohammed Avdol. They explain that Jotaro‚Äôs \\"evil spirit\\" is actually a manifestation of his fighting spirit, called a Stand, and reveal that they possess Stands as well. Joseph explains that the sudden appearance of their Stands is caused by the nemesis of his grandfather, Jonathan Joestar: Dio Brando, now referred to as DIO. DIO has awoken his own Stand (thus awakening the Stands of the rest of the Joestar bloodline) and recruited Stand-using assassins to kill Jonathan's remaining descendants. Soon after, Jotaro defeats the first of these assassins, Noriaki Kakyoin, managing to rescue him from the influence of DIO's parasitic flesh bud. Holly soon becomes gravely ill due to a Stand manifesting in her, which is slowly killing her due to her reserved personality. With little hesitation, Jotaro, Joseph, Avdol, and Kakyoin begin a journey to Egypt to kill DIO and save Holly's life. On the way, they are joined by another reformed assassin named Jean Pierre Polnareff, who seeks to avenge his sister, whose murderer is among DIO's forces. Forced to travel on foot after DIO's assassins manage to foil their travel by plane and ship, the group encounter Hol Horse and the murderer of Polnareff's sister, J. Geil, in Calcutta, with Avdol seemingly killed during the confrontation. Polnareff kills J. Geil with Kakyoin's help, and the remaining group travels further into Pakistan. After defeating Geil's mother, a DIO loyalist named Enya, the group reach the Red Sea, where Polnareff learns Avdol faked his death to acquire a submarine that allows them to reach Egypt. Upon arriving in Abu Simbel, the heroes are joined by Iggy, a Boston Terrier with a Stand of his own, while facing the first of eight assassins with Stands named after Egyptian deities (rather than the tarot theme of before). Kakyoin is wounded in an ambush, and is taken to a hospital to recuperate. After the group defeats several more Stand users while reaching Cairo, Iggy discovers and leads them to DIO's mansion, with Kakyoin rejoining them. At the mansion's entrance, the party is split up, with Polnareff avenging Avdol and Iggy when they are killed by DIO's vampirized servant, Vanilla Ice. Jotaro, Joseph, Kakyoin, and Polnareff ultimately encounter DIO, and escape his mansion. A chase across Cairo follows, leading to Kakyoin confronting DIO and his Stand, The World. Though fatally wounded by The World, Kakyoin deduces the Stand's ability to stop time for a few seconds and relays it to Joseph before dying. Joseph is able to pass it on to Jotaro, but is fatally wounded by DIO who uses his blood to increase the duration of his ability. Jotaro then fights DIO alone, slowly discovering that he shares DIO's time-stopping ability, due to Star Platinum having similar abilities and stats to The World. The battle ends with Jotaro defeating DIO using the ability, transfusing DIO's blood back into Joseph, before destroying the vampire for good. Jotaro and Joseph then bid Polnareff farewell before returning to Japan, as Holly has made a full recovery. Characters * ' is the delinquent protagonist. He uses the Stand, Star Platinum, whose power is incredible strength, speed, and precision. It is later revealed that Star Platinum also has the power to stop time, which helps him during the final battle with DIO. * ' is Jotaro's grandfather, and the title character of the previous part of the series, Battle Tendency. He uses the Stand, Hermit Purple, which allows him to produce thorny purple vines that can perform predictions through electronic equipment such as Polaroid cameras or televisions (although at the cost of destroying said equipment); he can also swing from them or protect himself with them. He also still has access to Hamon, which was his primary ability in Battle Tendency, and can use Hermit Purple as wires to channel Hamon. * ' is a fortune teller from Cairo, and an ally of Joseph and Jotaro. He uses the Stand, Magician's Red, which allows him to manipulate fire. * ' is a former enemy turned ally of Jotaro, who uses the Stand, Hierophant Green, which he can unravel into threads to enter people and control them from the inside, or perform a long-ranged attack using blasts of green energy known as Emerald Splash. * ' is another former enemy turned ally of Jotaro. Polnareff joins the crew to avenge his younger sister, who was murdered by a man with two right hands. Polnareff uses the Stand, Silver Chariot, which takes the form of an armored knight wielding a rapier, excelling in fast swordsmanship and close-range fighting; his Stand can shed its armor to increase its agility and speed exponentially. He can also shoot his sword but only once in the battle. * ' is a Boston Terrier who uses the Stand, The Fool, which manipulates sand and dust. * ' is the daughter of Joseph and the mother of Jotaro. Although most Stands are used for fighting, her Stand works against her gentle, non-violent soul, slowly making her increasingly sick. It takes on the form of vines with roses and berries. * ', the main antagonist, is a vampire who previously appeared in Phantom Blood. He uses the Stand, The World, a close-combat Stand, similar to Star Platinum, which is capable of stopping time for brief intervals. * ' is an old woman, who is the confidant of DIO. She uses the Stand, Justice, which takes the form of a mist that takes control over anyone with an open wound, allowing Enya to control them as she would a marionette. *' is a recurring minor antagonist who nearly killed Mohammad Avdol (with the assistance of J. Geil) using his Stand, Emperor, a long range Stand resembling a gun that can shoot and steer its bullets. *' is the son of Enya the Hag, and the man who murdered Polnareff's sister, prompting Polnareff to avenge her. J. Geil wields the Stand, Hanged Man, a Stand that attacks others in reflections such as mirrors. Hanged Man can also jump from reflection to reflection in a ray of light. Production Having originally planned the series as a trilogy, Araki thought to have the final confrontation set in present-day Japan. But he did not want it to be a tournament affair, which was popular in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump at the time, and therefore decided to make it a \\"road movie\\" inspired by Around the World in Eighty Days. He modeled Jotaro after American actor Clint Eastwood, including his poses and catchphrases. Although the author said the character might seem \\"rough\\" compared to other Jump protagonists, Jotaro fits his own image of a hero perfectly as a \\"loner\\" who does not do the right thing for attention. Araki said the character wearing his school uniform in the desert has its roots in Mitsuteru Yokoyama's Babel II, and that if he were to draw the part over again, he would base the Stands on Tetsujin 28-go. Araki originally thought of Stands as something inorganic powered by life force. When creating them he often takes inspiration from artifacts such as clothing, masks, and dolls by indigenous peoples, which when fused with something biological or mechanical, makes for a very unique design. Araki said he had a lot of readers asking him to bring older characters back. Although he is not a fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return from Battle Tendency to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author thought of having Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up \\"playing it by ear\\" as serialization continued. He gave him the role of \\"navigator\\", introducing the readers to the Joestar family, Dio, Hamon and Stands, and his own Stand being a support ability rather than offensive. Stands being a succession of the Hamon and Hamon being life energy that spreads across the body through breathing, Araki thought Joseph's Hermit Purple vines wrapping around his body were a visual representation of that. Avdol was given the role of \\"subleader\\" who acts as navigator, and, with steadfast determination and an unyielding sense of duty, he is the one in the group that everyone can rely on. Araki said he gave him an \\"ethnic\\" design to have some sort of connection to Egypt and that at the time of serialization, he and most of the readers had a strong interest in the \\"birthplaces of civilization,\\" making Avdol's design a \\"product of the times.\\" Not wanting readers to get complacent, the author took Avdol out of action under the guise of death. Although he intended to bring him back, he did not have specific plans and just wrote what came natural. In hindsight, Araki felt he probably should have given Avdol a section where he played a more primary role, but also believes that he would not have ranked well in a character popularity poll, as the readers only wanted more fights featuring Jotaro. Araki also said that Avdol's Stand was difficult to draw as controlling fire is a common thing in manga and film, and if you \\"play it too loose\\" it can break the power balance. As such, fire and poison are two abilities he is okay with barring from future use. Araki stated that he had Kakyoin act as a foil to Jotaro. Although they both wear school uniforms, Kakyoin's well-tailored one gives him the feel of an honor student, while Jotaro's loose-fitting one and accessories convey that he is a delinquent. He made him Jotaro's first real Stand opponent to visually convey the concepts between short-range and long-range Stand abilities. The author revealed that he always read the kanji for Kakyoin's given name as \\"Tenmei,\\" but his editor approved the reading Noriaki for the tank≈çbon much to his surprise. In order to not have him overlap with Jotaro and Joseph, Polnareff was given a distinctive look and personality, which in turn made him shine on his own, with his lines standing out \\"for better or for worse.\\" Because he is a versatile character who could say goofy lines or serious ones, he \\"needed\\" to make more appearances. More appearances means more fights, and because he made it through so many life-or- death situations, Araki feels that Polnareff grew the most in the story. The author used foreign models as reference for his hair, and also drew it like Rudol von Stroheim's from Battle Tendency. The character's name was inspired by those of Araki's three favorite French people, actors Alain Delon and Jean- Paul Belmondo, and musician Michel Polnareff. With the series meant to be long-running, Araki took great care in deciding which unique Stand user to put the main cast against and when, in order to keep readers interested. He designed Strength, Ebony Devil, and Yellow Temperance so that their appearances and abilities did not overlap. But as these were all one-on-one battles, he then decided to introduce Hol Horse and J. Geil as a team. He had always planned on having Kakyoin and Polnareff switch allegiances to the good guys, but not Hol Horse. Although he drew a color illustration with Hol Horse alongside the Joestar group and had the character return several times through the story, he suspects he did not go through with it because his personality overlaps with Polnareff's. He also said that because he did not put many limitations on his Stand, it kind of got out of control, plus it overlaps with Kakyoin's Emerald Splash. He did enjoy Hol Horse's \\"why be number one when you can be number two\\" philosophy, which the author carried over to Yoshikage Kira in Diamond Is Unbreakable, and his outlaw appearance is similar to that of Gyro Zeppeli from Steel Ball Run and might have been inspired by Buichi Terasawa's Cobra. Not having any limitations on what he can put in JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki has animals appear and even had one join the Joestar party. Wanting to add an animal as a pet, he chose a dog which to him symbolizes loyalty and friendship. Contradicting what he said in an earlier volume, Araki revealed that just like with Kakyoin and Polnareff, he did not originally plan for Iggy to join the group. Although he feels that The Fool is a perfect fit for Iggy, it just happened to be the last tarot card for him to assign aside from The World. Additionally, he thought of assigning The Fool to an enemy instead, but things just \\"ended up working out the way they did.\\" Being the first time he made an animal a major character and the first time he showed one in battle, Araki used Yoshihiro Takahashi's Ginga: Nagareboshi Gin as a reference. He described The Fool as representing his ideal design for a Stand; starting with a dog, then adding a Native American mask, and then the tires of a car. The third aspect was added because Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump was sponsoring a Formula One car at the time. Having previously done a gambling battle in his manga Cool Shock B.T., Araki wanted to do another as a Stand battle, leading to the creation of D'Arby the Elder. His Stand ability came from the author's own belief that the money and chips you gamble with in real life are a representation of your soul. Having greatly enjoyed the fight, Araki later introduced his younger brother. Looking back, he believes that the D'Arby brothers and the Oingo Boingo brothers separated JoJo's Bizarre Adventure from other manga because it allowed him to add much more variation to its battles. He also said that this led to the dice battle in Diamond Is Unbreakable and the beetle battle in JoJolion. Enyaba was modeled after the scary old women from horror films and created to answer how Dio learned about Stands. Her Stand was also inspired by horror films, where an unknown virus comes from space. Her son's Stand being similar to a mummy and mermaid, again references horror movies. Enyaba again utilizes what Araki learned from Lisa Lisa in Battle Tendency; the supernatural basis of Stands and Hamon evens the battlefield for women and children to match up against strong men. Araki recalled how his editor suddenly ended up in the hospital during the serialization of Jotaro and Dio's final fight. Without his valuable advice, the author said it was difficult and he started panicking as the end was approaching. English adaptation Viz Media began publishing an English adaptation of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in 2005, which begins the series with the Stardust Crusaders arc, starting with the last chapter of Japanese volume 12 (moved to the beginning of volume 13). The English edition is edited by Jason Thompson, author of Manga: The Complete Guide. By December 2010, all sixteen volumes (originally Volumes 13‚Äì28) have been published. Minor edits were made to artwork where certain scenes of animal violence were redrawn by Hirohiko Araki for the English release. Volume 3 of the English edition features a single panel of a dog being decapitated which was redrawn from an alternate angle, and Japanese volume 18 (volume 6) has several redrawn panels where a mutilated dog was changed into a large rat. Volume 19 (English volume 7) features redrawn artwork in the final chapter of the \\"Death 13\\" story arc in order to remove scenes of human feces. Any instances of real-life brand names and logos (such as drinks and automotive brands) were erased. Some names were altered for the English release, presumably for copyright reasons. The character named Devo was changed entirely, along with that of Steely Dan. Oingo and Boingo were changed to Zenyatta and Mondatta after The Police album, Zenyatta Mondatta. The first volume included a recap of Parts 1 and 2 in order to clarify story points for Western readers, while mosques in volume 15 (Japanese volume 27) were redrawn after international controversy (see below), though the latter of the two was also in recent Japanese prints. Chapters In the original volumization, chapter 114 is collected in volume 12, listed on the Battle Tendency page. Original volumization2002 release2013 release2014 release=Related media From 1992 to 1993, Stardust Crusaders was adapted into the three-volume audio drama JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, subtitled Meet Jotaro Kujo, The Death of Avdol, and Dio's World. Two light novels illustrated by Araki have been released. The first is titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, released on November 4, 1993 and written by Mayori Sekijima and Hiroshi Yamaguchi. Nisio Isin was one of the authors commissioned to write novels in celebration of the series' 25th anniversary. It was released on December 16, 2011 and titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Over Heaven. A 13-episode OVA series, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, was produced by Studio APPP. The first six episodes were released on VHS and Laserdisc by Pony Canyon from 1993 to 1994, covering the latter part of this arc. When the series was released on DVD by Klock Worx from 2000 to 2002, an additional set of seven episodes were produced by the same cast and crew, serving as a prequel to the earlier episodes (which were subsequently re-released with new chronological numbering). Super Techno Arts produced a North American English dub version of all 13 episodes in chronological order as a six-volume DVD series. An anime television adaptation of the series, titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders, was produced by David Production and aired in Japan between April 2014 and June 2015. The series was simulcast by Crunchyroll, with several names rewritten to avoid copyright infringement. In addition to the second season of the anime, a mobile app game titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Shooters was also released. The arc has been adapted into several video games. The first was a role-playing video game released in 1993 for the Super Famicom under the title JoJo's Bizarre Adventure,. A fighting game for arcades by Capcom, also simply titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, was released in 1998. It was released internationally as JoJo's Venture, and followed by an upgraded version titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Heritage for the Future. The international version this time retained the manga's actual full title of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, dropping the Heritage for the Future subtitle. The upgraded version was then ported to the PlayStation and Dreamcast in 1999, and a high-definition version was released for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade in August 2012 before being delisted in 2014. Several characters from Stardust Crusaders later appear in the crossover games JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle and JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Eyes of Heaven, both published by Bandai Namco Entertainment and developed by CyberConnect2. Jotaro and DIO in particular also appear in several crossover games with other Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump characters, such as in Jump Super Stars, Jump Ultimate Stars and most recently Jump Force. Controversy In May 2008, both Shueisha and Studio APPP halted manga/OVA shipments of JoJo after a complaint had been launched against them by a group of online Muslim protestors after a scene from one of the OVA's episodes features Dio reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an. This recall affected the English-language releases as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on-top, and destroying, mosques. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009, and thus their publication was continued. Reception In a 2018 survey of 17,000 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fans, Stardust Crusaders was chosen as the third favorite story arc with 17.3% of the vote. Its battle between Jotaro and Dio was chosen as the favorite fight of the series. Reviewing Stardust Crusaders for Anime News Network, Rebecca Silverman enjoyed seeing Part 2's Joseph team up with new protagonist Jotaro and was impressed that Araki was able to keep Dio out of Part 2 completely, only to bring him back for Part 3. She initially called the replacement of Hamon with Stands both understandable and a bit of a disappointment, since the \\"insane physical abilities and contortions\\" caused by the former were a large source of the fun in the first two parts. However, Silverman would go on to describe later Stand battles as exciting and creative in subsequent reviews. NotesReferences Adventure anime and manga Fantasy anime and manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Egypt in fiction Sh≈çnen manga Shueisha manga Supernatural anime and manga Viz Media manga Tarot in fiction ","title":"Stardust Crusaders"},{"id":"9590588","text":"is the fourth story arc of the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from 1992 to 1995, with the 174 chapters collected into eighteen tank≈çbon volumes. In its original publication, it was titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 4: J≈çsuke Higashikata. It was preceded by Stardust Crusaders and followed by Golden Wind. Araki introduced the Bow and Arrow in this arc, which causes characters pierced by it (and strong enough mentally) to develop a Stand ability. This was used on DIO at the beginning of Part 3, which not only gave him a Stand but caused Stands to develop in the Joestar bloodline as well. The arc was adapted into an anime television series by David Production, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable, that began in April 2016. A live- action film adaptation by Toho and Warner Bros. titled JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I was released on August 4, 2017. Viz Media has licensed the manga and started to release it in English on May 7, 2019 in a compiled format. Plot In 1999, in the town of Morioh located in S-City, M-Prefecture, a freshman named Koichi Hirose meets a man looking for Josuke Higashikata, a popular boy in high school. Josuke, who is the illegitimate child of Joseph Joestar, soon encounters the man, who introduces himself as Jotaro Kujo. Jotaro's arrival in Morioh pulls Josuke into the world of the supernatural powers known as Stands, as he becomes involved in Jotaro's search for the Stand-creating Bow and Arrow; Josuke himself is revealed to possess the Stand Crazy Diamond, which has the ability to return any object or living creature (except himself or any deceased being) to a previous state. Josuke and Koichi eventually come across a pair of Stand-using brothers, Okuyasu and Keicho Nijimura. Keicho is revealed to be the one possessing the Bow to create Stand users, turning Koichi into one. After he and his brother are defeated, Keicho is killed by the Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper, which takes the Bow and Arrow. Okuyasu joins with Josuke's group to avenge his brother, encountering several other Stand users before they eventually find and defeat Akira Otoishi, Red Hot Chili Pepper's user, as Joseph arrives in Morioh. The Bow and Arrow are taken into Jotaro's custody and all seems to be over for the moment. Soon afterward, after Josuke spends time with Joseph, the group encounters other Stand users such as eccentric manga artist Rohan Kishibe, middle schooler Shigekiyo \\"Shigechi\\" Yangu and an aesthetician named Aya Tsuji. Koichi and Kishibe later stumble across the mysterious Ghost Street where they meet the ghosts of Reimi Sugimoto and her dog Arnold, learning that they were murdered a decade ago by a serial killer who is still lurking in Morioh. The culprit is eventually revealed to be a handsome office worker named Yoshikage Kira, who seeks to satisfy his murderous urges while living a peaceful, quiet life. Kira has acquired a Stand named Killer Queen, possessing the ability to turn anything it touches into a bomb. When his act of murdering Shigechi to conceal himself backfires (resulting in a brief battle with Jotaro and Koichi in which he is injured), Kira uses Aya to assume the identity of a man named Kosaku Kawajiri, kills them both, and disappears. Kira's father Yoshihiro uses a second Bow and Arrow to create an army of Stand users to protect his son, including a dying cat that reincarnated as a Stand-plant hybrid named Stray Cat, which shoots bubbles of compressed air at its target. Kosaku Kawajiri's son Hayato begins to suspect that his father has been replaced by an impostor and confronts Kira, who responds by impulsively murdering Hayato. In a panic that he will be discovered, Kira is pierced by Yoshihiro's Arrow a second time, giving Kira's Stand a new ability which revives Hayato. The following morning, Hayato is approached by Rohan, who is investigating whether Kira has assumed Kosaku Kawajiri's identity. After using his Stand to read Hayato's memories, Rohan is blown up by a miniature version of Killer Queen, which had been implanted into Hayato; Hayato suddenly finds himself back in bed on the same morning, one hour earlier. Kira explains that he has infused Hayato with his new ability Bites the Dust, which kills anyone who asks Hayato for Kira's identity and rewinds time by one hour afterward, with the victim's fate cemented regardless of Hayato's attempts to prevent it. The next loop ends with Josuke, Jotaro, Okuyasu, and Koichi all exploding as well; Hayato wakes up once again, and must get Kira to turn off Bites the Dust within one hour in order to prevent the others' deaths from becoming permanent. Hayato takes advantage of his knowledge of the time loop to wake Josuke up early and arrange for him to overhear Kira blowing his cover, forcing Kira to cancel Bites the Dust just in time to save the group. Josuke, with help from Hayato and Okuyasu, engages Kira and Stray Cat in a pitched battle; Yoshihiro is blown up after Josuke tricks Kira into targeting him. As Jotaro, Koichi, and Rohan arrive on the scene, Kira attempts to use a paramedic to activate Bites the Dust and rewind time once more, but is stopped by Koichi and Jotaro. Kira is accidentally run over by an arriving ambulance and dies, with Reimi subsequently forcing her killer's soul into being dragged into the underworld. Her mission accomplished, Reimi gives the group her final farewells and moves on to the afterlife. The next day, Jotaro and Joseph return home as the summer of 1999 draws to a close for the residents of Morioh, and a conclusion to all the stand users in Morioh. Characters * Josuke Higashikata is the main protagonist and illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar. He is a freshman who lives in the town of Morioh with his mother and grandfather. He uses the Stand Crazy Diamond, which can not only punch rapidly, but also restore objects to their original state or rearrange their structure, allowing him to heal injuries, erase written documents, or revert complex structures to their raw components. He becomes especially enraged if anyone ever makes fun of his pompadour hairstyle. * Koichi Hirose is Josuke's and Okuyasu's best friend and is also a freshman in high school, but appears as a short boy. His Stand is Echoes, which has three distinct \\"ACTs\\". ACT 1 and ACT 2 can replicate sound effects and attach them to anything, which result in that happening to the object (e.g. attaching the word \\"whoosh\\" causes a gust of wind to blow by) while ACT 3 loses the former abilities and gains the ability \\"3-Freeze\\" which causes a target to become very heavy. * Okuyasu Nijimura is one of the two Nijimura brothers who became friends with Koichi after defeating a Stand user who murdered his brother. His Stand The Hand, swipes with its right hand which erases whatever it swipes and it can be used to erase space, drawing objects closer to Okuyasu. * Jotaro Kujo is the protagonist of the previous story arc, Stardust Crusaders, who travels to Morioh to find his grandfather's illegitimate son, Josuke Higashikata, who is technically Jotaro's uncle despite Jotaro being older than him, as well as investigate the crimes of a Stand user. His Stand Star Platinum: The Worldhas the ability to stop the flow of time temporarily. * Joseph Joestar is Josuke's father and Jotaro's grandfather who was previously the protagonist of Battle Tendency and one of the main characters of Stardust Crusaders, now an old man and nearly senile. He uses the Stand Hermit Purple which manifests in the form of multipurpose thorny purple vines that allow him to divine information through electrical equipment or be utilized as ropes. * Rohan Kishibe is a famous manga artist who recently moved into a house in Morioh. His Stand Heaven's Door, allows him to temporarily turn a person into a book, with all of their memories written down akin to a novel. Rohan can read the memories, learn their weaknesses and secrets, as well as write down commands that they must follow (usually, \\"Can not attack Rohan Kishibe.\\") The power only activates when the target sees Rohan's drawn artwork, but can also activate if Rohan draws something in the air with his finger. Rohan also stars in his own spin-off one-shot series by Araki called Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan. * Keicho Nijimura is Okuyasu's elder brother who caused the outbreak of Stand users in Morioh to create one whose Stand can end the suffering of their father after he was mutated by Dio Brando into a monstrous, addled immortal. Keicho was later killed by Akira Otoishi when saving his brother from an attack by the guitarist's stand. Keicho's Stand Bad Company is an army of toy soldiers. * Anjuro Katagiri, also known as \\"Angelo\\" is a depraved serial killer with an IQ of 160. While on death row for murdering a rich person while staging a post- mortem ransom, Angelo is made a Stand User by Keicho and uses his water-based Stand Aqua Necklace to escape and resume his killing spree in Morioh before ultimately confronting Josuke, murdering the youth's grandfather before being fused by Crazy Diamond's powers into a stone that becomes Morioh's tourist attraction Angelo Rock. * Akira Otoishi is the main antagonist for the first half of the storyline, an aspiring rock star guitarist who acquired his Stand Red Hot Chili Pepper through Keicho's actions. * Yoshikage Kira is the main antagonist for the second half of the storyline and a mild-mannered serial killer who has been murdering women for over 15 years. His Stand, Killer Queen, has the ability to completely disintegrate his victims by explosion, leaving no evidence behind. * Yoshihiro Kira is the ghost of Kira's father whose Stand Atom Heart Father allows him to remain among the living to protect Kira from within a photograph. Having acquired a Bow and Arrow from Enya prior to moving to Morioh, Yoshihiro uses the arrow to create Stand users in an attempt to keep Josuke's group away from Kira. *Mikitaka Hazekura is a strange individual who claims that he is an alien. He befriends Josuke and Okuyasu, and occasionally helps them out. Mikitaka uses the ability Earth Wind and Fire, allowing him to shapeshift into inanimate objects. It's ambiguous whether or not Mikitaka is actually an alien, or a normal human with a Stand. * Stray Cat, a cat-like plant Stand that is a reincarnation of a cat named Tama which was accidentally killed after being hit by the Arrow. * Reimi Sugimoto is Yoshikage Kira's first victim. She was killed 15 years before the happenings of the manga and waited as a ghost for someone whom she could warn about her killer. * Hayato Kawajiri is a shy and intelligent schoolboy who realized his father Kosaku Kawajiri was murdered by Kira when the killer assumed his identity. Though Kira decided to use the boy as a means to kill Josuke's group, Hayato ended up being the killer's downfall. Production With Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki said that he moved away from \\"muscle men\\" as they fell out of popularity with his readers and he wanted to focus more on fashion. When designing his characters' outfits, Araki considers both everyday fashion and \\"cartoonish, bizarre clothing that would be impractical in real life.\\" He also forgoes using specific color schemes for his characters and gives his readers different impressions through various color combinations. Araki said that while he drew several character in Parts 1 through 3 naked to evoke Greek or Roman gods, he stopped doing it so much with Part 4 to be a \\"bit closer to home.\\" Diamond Is Unbreakable is set in the fictional town of Morioh located in S-City, M-Prefecture, which is modeled after the author's hometown of Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture. Chapters=Original volumization2004 release2016 releaseEnglish release=Related media In 2000, it was announced that Otsuichi would be writing a novel based on Part 4. The novel proved difficult to complete; in Kono Mystery ga Sugoi 2004, Otsuichi claimed to have written over 2000 pages, but thrown them all out. Intent on writing a novel that lived up to the manga, it took him until 2007 before The Book: JoJo's Bizarre Adventure 4th Another Day was finally released on November 26. It is set after the events in the manga, and includes illustrations by Araki. In 1997, Araki published the Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump one-shot Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Episode 16.. Confessional~, starring Rohan after the events of Part 4. In 1999 he wrote the three-chapter story Dead Man's Questions in Allman magazine. Dead Man's Questions stars Yoshikage Kira, the main antagonist of Part 4. Both Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe and Dead Man's Questions were later compiled in Araki's one-shot collection, Under Jailbreak, Under Execution, in 1999. The former launched a series starring Rohan, Thus Spoke Kishibe Rohan. The December 11, 2007 issue of Jump Square featured a second entry into the Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe collection, entitled Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Mutsukabezaka~, set seven years after the events of Part IV. In 2009, Araki wrote the full-color story Rohan au Louvre. The short story was displayed at the Mus√©e du Louvre as part of their 2009 Le Louvre invite la bande dessin√©e exhibit. The story was later republished in Ultra Jump in 2010. In 2012, Rohan au Louvre was released in English by NBM Publishing under the translated title Rohan at the Louvre. In 2011, Araki collaborated with the renowned Italian fashion brand Gucci for the short story Rohan Kishibe Goes to Gucci in the women's fashion magazine Spur. In 2012, Araki wrote a third Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe one-shot for Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump. Entitled Thus Spoke Rohan Kishibe ~Episode 5: Millionaire Village~ it was released in the October 6, 2012 issue of the magazine. In October 2015, Warner Bros. announced that Part 4 would receive an anime television adaptation that serves as a continuation of David Production's series adaptation. The series aired in 2016. Toho and Warner Bros. partnered to produce a live-action film based on the fourth arc of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure that was released on August 4, 2017. Takashi Miike directed the film that stars Kento Yamazaki as Josuke. Both studios planned for worldwide distribution and, with a title of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I, are hoping to create sequels. However, the film under- performed at the box office, leaving the possibility of future sequels in doubt. Reception In a 2018 survey of 17,000 JoJo's Bizarre Adventure fans, Diamond Is Unbreakable was chosen as the second favorite story arc with 17.5% of the vote. Anime News Network had both Rebecca Silverman and Faye Hopper review the first volume of Diamond Is Unbreakable. Silverman called the beginning slower and not as instantly engrossing as the previous parts, but felt this allowed Josuke, whom she and Hopper both described as kinder than the previous protagonists, to develop as a character. Hopper stated that Diamond Is Unbreakable is sometimes criticized for a \\"lack of a strong narrative throughline\\" in comparison to other parts, but argued that this is one of its greatest strengths as it allows the main characters to \\"simply be, lending them an amiable humanity that none of the over-the-top archetypes in the first 3 Parts ever had.\\" NotesReferences JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Adventure anime and manga Fantasy anime and manga Sendai in fiction Shueisha manga Viz Media manga Fiction set in 1999 Sh≈çnen manga Supernatural anime and manga Manga adapted into films ","title":"Diamond Is Unbreakable"},{"id":"9590590","text":", also known as Vento Aureo, is the fifth story arc of the Japanese manga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki. It was serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from November 20, 1995 to April 5, 1999. In its original publication, it was referred to as JoJo's Bizarre Adventure Part 5 Giorno Giovanna: Golden Heritage. Within Golden Wind, the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure title is rendered in Italian, as Le Bizzarre Avventure di GioGio. As it is the fifth part of the series, the 155 chapters pick up where the fourth left off and are numbered 440 to 594, with the tank≈çbon volumes numbered 47 to 63. It was preceded by Diamond Is Unbreakable and followed by Stone Ocean. An anime adaptation by David Production, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Golden Wind, aired on TV from October 2018 to July 2019. Plot In 2001, Koichi Hirose arrives in Naples, Italy at Jotaro Kujo's request to obtain a skin sample from a young man named Haruno Shiobana to confirm him as the son of Dio Brando, conceived with Jonathan Joestar's body prior to the events of Stardust Crusaders. Koichi ends up being scammed by Haruno, who now goes by the name Giorno Giovanna, and whose Stand Gold Experience allows him to transform inanimate objects into living organisms. After Giorno fends off an assault from gang member Leaky-Eye Luca, Stand-wielding mafioso Bruno Bucciarati attacks Giorno in order to avenge Luca's defeat. Giorno wins Bucciarati over by revealing his goal of becoming a mafia boss to better Naples and end the scourge of drug trafficking plaguing the city's youth. Bucciarati agrees to introduce Giorno into the Passione organization, with Giorno taking a deadly initiation test from the morbidly obese capo Polpo. Giorno passes the test while convincing Koichi to cease his investigation, though he indirectly kills Polpo for his test having caused an innocent bystander's death. Giorno is placed in Bucciarati's group, which consists of fellow Stand users Guido Mista, Leone Abbacchio, Narancia Ghirga and Pannacotta Fugo. The news of Polpo's apparent suicide results in Bucciarati being promoted to capo after his group retrieves and donates Polpo's amassed fortune from the island of Capri to Passione's boss. Bucciarati is then given Polpo's mission from the boss, a mysterious figure who conceals himself from everyone, including his subordinates. The assigned task is for Bucciarati's group to bring the boss's teenage daughter Trish Una safely to him; to do so they must fend off Passione's Stand-wielding Hitman Team, who seek to use Trish to discover the boss's identity and take over the organization. After retrieving a key in Pompeii, the group acquire a Stand-using turtle named Coco Jumbo and travel to Venice, defeating members of the Hitman Team along the way. Reaching Venice safely and delivering Trish to the Church of San Giorgio Maggiore, Bucciarati realizes that the boss intends to kill his own daughter to maintain his secret identity. An enraged Bucciarati saves Trish, but suffers grievous injuries at the hands of the boss' immensely powerful Stand, King Crimson, which has the ability to see several seconds into the future and skip over short bursts of time. Giorno heals Bucciarati's injuries and the two manage to escape the church. With the exception of Fugo, the group decides to defect from Passione and uncover the boss's identity in order to defeat him. They and Trish, who discovers her own Stand Spice Girl, fight for their lives against the boss's elite soldiers, who have been sent to eliminate the traitors. Following a lead on the boss's origins, Bucciarati's group travels to the island of Sardinia. Unfortunately, the boss is waiting for them, and swiftly kills Abbacchio before going into hiding once again. All seems lost until Giorno and company are contacted by someone who knows the boss's identity and suggests using a special Arrow to evolve Bucciarati's Stand. Bucciarati and the rest travel to Rome to meet the informant, who is revealed to be Jean Pierre Polnareff. Once again, the boss arrives first, and fatally wounds Polnareff. As a last-ditch gambit, Polnareff stabs his Stand, Silver Chariot, with the Arrow, evolving it into Chariot Requiem, which has the ability to swap the souls of all living beings and a mission to guard the Arrow. Chariot Requiem goes berserk, causing a city-wide soul swap with Polnareff's soul now in Coco Jumbo's body. Polnareff explains to the group about the Arrow and his Stand, revealing Passione's boss is named Diavolo. After Diavolo kills Narancia, he and the remainder of Bucciarati's group chase after the user-less Chariot Requiem, both sides focused on obtaining the Arrow. Though Diavolo succeeds in weakening the Stand, Bucciarati sacrifices himself to dispel the soul swap and pass the Arrow to Giorno. Giorno succeeds in upgrading his Stand to Gold Experience Requiem, and uses his new power to send Diavolo into a loop of never-ending death. The final scene shows gang members kneeling before Giorno as Mista and Polnareff (still in the body of Coco Jumbo) watch, suggesting that Giorno has succeeded in becoming the new Passione boss. Characters * Giorno Giovanna is the human son of Dio Brando who retains the Joestar bloodline as Dio was in possession of Jonathan Joestar's body at the time Giorno was conceived, originally named Haruno Shiobana before moving to Italy. Giorno aspires to overthrow the Passione mafia's boss and rework the organization into one that helps the Italian people, akin to Robin Hood's band, in contrast to the sheer powerlust of its current leader, Diavolo. He uses the Stand Gold Experience, which has the ability to imbue things with life. After piercing his Stand with the arrow, it turns into Gold Experience Requiem, a Stand that reverts actions and willpower back to the state of \\"zero\\", completely nullifying them and preventing them from becoming \\"real\\" (whether stand or non-stand), effectively controlling causality, specifically keeping \\"cause\\" and removing \\"effect\\". It keeps his life-giving abilities but evolves it into a greater extent, with its strength and speed rivaling, if not higher, than Star Platinum or The World. * Bruno Bucciarati is the caporegime of a gang within Passione. He uses the Stand, Sticky Fingers, which can place a zipper on any object, allowing entrance into it. Bruno can also use Sticky Fingers to separate objects into smaller objects which can be zipped back together later and repaired. He also appears in the 2012 spin-off one-shot Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci. * Leone Abbacchio is a former police officer, and a member of Bucciarati's gang. He uses the Stand, Moody Blues, which can replay past history as a 3D video recording which he and others can observe during a replay of the events, although doing so leaves it temporarily defenseless. Abbacchio also appears in Jolyne, Fly High with Gucci. * Guido Mista is a member of Bucciarati's gang. He uses a revolver in tandem with his Stand, Sex Pistols, which is composed of six small humanoids who can control the bullets Mista shoots. The humanoids are numbered #1‚Äì#7, with no #4, due to Mista's tetraphobia. Each of the pistols which make up Mista's stand have their own individual personalities and internal conflicts which Mista always tries to resolve. * Narancia Ghirga is a member of Bucciarati's gang. He uses the airplane-like Stand, Aerosmith, which is equipped with machine guns, bombs and a carbon dioxide radar, allowing him to track down any opponent that breathes. * Pannacotta Fugo is Bucciarati's right-hand man in the gang. Fugo tends to be erratic in mood, often breaking into short bursts of rage. He uses the Stand, Purple Haze, which can release a virus that rapidly devours organic matter. Purple Haze is indiscriminate in how its virus affects people, damaging both friends and enemies alike (including Fugo himself). Because of Purple Haze's dangerous ability, Fugo tends to avoid using it until he runs out of other options in a fight. Fugo is the main character of the novels Golden Heart, Golden Ring and Purple Haze Feedback. * Trish Una is the daughter of Passione's boss, and is on the run from rival factions within the mafia, such as the Hitman Team who wish to use her family ties to the Boss to track him down. She uses the Stand, Spice Girl, which can increase objects' elasticity, making them nearly indestructible. * Coco Jumbo is a turtle that gained a Stand, presumably from the Stand Arrow. Its stand, Mr. President, manifests as an inter-dimensional hotel room inside its shell. * Jean Pierre Polnareff is a French swordsman who traveled alongside Jotaro Kujo and Joseph Joestar to defeat Giorno's father in 1988. Polnareff discovered the true identity of Passione's boss while investigating the rise of drug-related crimes in his home country, but was severely injured and left for dead after being overwhelmed by the boss' Stand. He contacts Bucciarati's team after they betray the boss and offers them a way to defeat the boss: a unique Stand Arrow (an object introduced in Diamond is Unbreakable) that gives whoever uses it a completely new Stand ability. Polnareff wields the extremely fast sword-wielding Stand, Silver Chariot, but when Diavolo forced Polnareff's Silver Chariot to use the Stand Arrow on Sliver Chariot, his Stand evolves into Chariot Requiem, which has the ability to swap the souls of living beings. * Passione is the most powerful gang in Italy, controlled by a man known only as \\"The Boss\\". Passione controls all levels of crime in Italy, from the low-level thugs and protective services to extremely powerful hitmen and drug traffickers. The gang's incredible level of power over Italy is mainly due to the unusual amount of Stand users found within its members. **Diavolo is the boss of Passione, and the father of Trish, intending to kill her to keep his existence a secret, targeting Giorno's group after they refused to hand Trish over. Diavolo uses the incredibly powerful Stand, King Crimson, which has the power to partially affect the causality of the near future in relation to himself; allowing him to negate processes, leaving only their consequences. Activating its power causes a time skip, where everything except Diavolo and King Crimson is changed to be in the state they would have been a few seconds later; for example, a bullet that would have hit Diavolo will suddenly be shifted to be on his other side. Diavolo is able to predict what will happen during the timeskip by using King Crimson's second face, Epitaph; this sub-power can also be used by Doppio to see seconds into the future. **Vinegar Doppio is the Boss' younger, more innocent and eccentric underboss. As a member of Passione, he thinks of himself as the most loyal subordinate to Diavolo, but in reality, the two are separate souls inhabiting the same body. During the course of the Part, he helps Diavolo to act and move around undetected. It is ambiguous whether Doppio is truly a Stand User, but he is allowed to wield both King Crimson's arms and Epitaph in battle. ** The Hitman Team / Execution Squad (La Squadra Esecuzioni) is a squad of Stand users within Passione specializing in assassinations. While they previously served under the leadership of Diavolo, their inquiry into Diavolo's identity led to their former boss having two of their members killed. In retaliation, the group swore vengeance against Diavolo and began pursuing his daughter, Trish, in order to discover his identity and kill him. They serve as the primary group of antagonists in the first half of Golden Wind (with the exception of Risotto, who doesn't appear until after Bruno's group betrays Diavolo). ***Risotto Nero is the leader of the Hitman Team. After his cousin was killed by a drunk driver, Risotto tracked down and assassinated the driver. In order to gain protection from the police after this crime, Risotto joined Passione. Although he mostly works in the background of the story, he eventually attacks Vinegar Doppio after the rest of his teammates are killed by Bruno's team. Risotto can control the iron in his surroundings (as well as in the blood of organisms) with his Stand, Metallica. ***Formaggio is the first member of the Hitman Team that the protagonists encounter, with the assassin going after Narancia in order to find Trish's whereabouts. Formaggio can shrink any object or creature with his Stand, Little Feet. ***Illuso is the second assassin that Bruno's team encounters, and pursues Giorno, Abbacchio, and Fugo in the ruins of Pompeii. Illuso can pull opponents into a mirror world (leaving their Stands behind) with his Stand, Man in the Mirror. ***Prosciutto is the third assassin that Bruno's group encounters, and pursues the entire group on a train to Florence alongside his partner Pesci. Prosciutto can rapidly age people with his Stand, The Grateful Dead. ***Pesci is an assassin who attacks Bruno's team alongside Prosciutto. Although he acts timid and cowardly, Pesci proves to be an extremely powerful opponent. Pesci wields the Stand Beach Boy, which takes the form of a fishing rod and hook and can quickly attack opponents as well as sense life force. Beach Boy can also go straight through objects and walls to hook its target. ***Melone is an assassin who attacks Giorno, Bruno, and Trish as the group tries to find a new route to Venice. A perverted and twisted individual, Melone uses the Stand, Baby Face, which impregnates a \\"mother\\" with an individual's DNA and gives birth to a homunculus whose abilities differ depending on the DNA of both of its \\"parents\\". ***Ghiaccio is the final member of the Hitman Team that Bruno's group directly encounters (due to Risotto already being killed by the time the group finds him), and pursues Giorno and Mista as they attempt to reach Venice. Ghaccio is an extremely unstable man who is enraged by oddities in language, and wields the Stand White Album, which encases his entire body and allows him to skate around his environment as if he was on ice, as well as freezing everything including the air around him using his secondary ability Gently Weeps. ***Sorbet and Gelato are two members of the Hitman team who are brutally executed by the boss as punishment for looking into his identity. Their deaths spark the Hitman Team's hatred for Diavolo and their desperation to hunt down Trish. **Elite Guard Squad (La Unit√† Speciale) is a secret elite of Stand users within Passione who act as Diavolo's bodyguards, serving as the secondary antagonists in the latter half of Golden Wind. ***Squalo wields the shark-like Stand, Clash, which can travel in any body of liquid. ***Tiziano can force others to tell lies with his Stand, Talking Head. ***Carne wields the invincible Stand, Notorious B.I.G, which only activates after his death and chases after and attacks the closest, quickest-moving thing it can detect. ***Cioccolata wields the Stand, Green Day, which quickly kills any human in its range with mold. ***Secco wears and uses his Stand, Oasis, to swim in rock as if it was water. As a result, anything near the rock melted will be melted as well.

In its original publication, it was known as It was preceded by Golden Wind and followed by Steel Ball Run. Plot Set near Port St. Lucie, Florida, the story follows Jotaro Kujo's daughter, Jolyne Cujoh, who is framed for a murder and ends up in Green Dolphin Street Jail. However, an amulet containing the head of the Arrow from her father allows her to unlock her Stand, Stone Free. Jotaro soon comes to visit her and informs her that a disciple of DIO's framed her so that he could kill her in prison, and urges her to escape. This plan goes awry when a Stand named Whitesnake uses its power to remove Jotaro's Stand and memories, in the form of discs. Jotaro sinks into a deathlike state, and Jolyne must somehow find a way to recover the discs from Whitesnake's user, the mysterious prison chaplain Enrico Pucci. Along the way, she picks up allies such as Emporio Alni√±o, a boy whose late mother gave birth to him in prison, Ermes Costello, an inmate searching for her sister's killer, and the convicted murderer, Narciso Anasui, who soon falls into unrequited love for Jolyne. Most notable of her allies is Weather Report, an amnesiac like Jotaro ever since Pucci stole his memories, though he retains his weather-controlling Stand, also named Weather Report. She also meets Foo Fighters (shortened to F.F.), a mass of plankton and hybrid of Stand and Stand User that had been made sentient via Whitesnake and assumed the human appearance of a recently-deceased female inmate, who becomes a core ally before her untimely demise at the hands of Pucci. Pucci knew and idolized DIO sometime before the events of Part 3 occurred. While in DIO's company, DIO spoke of \\"Heaven\\" and how to create a \\"perfect world\\" when certain conditions were met. Pucci, keeping DIO to his word, proceeds with his plan to realize this \\"perfect world\\", which involves absorbing the remnants of DIO's bones in the form of a green homunculus and arriving at a predestined place on the night of the new moon. Sometime after the death of F.F., Jolyne, Ermes, and Emporio escape from prison on their hunt for Pucci while Anasui and Weather Report also escape in pursuit of Jolyne. She succeeds in sending both of Jotaro's discs to the Speedwagon Foundation and the \\"resurrection\\" of Jotaro quickly goes underway. During the battle with Donatello Versus, one of the sons of DIO, Weather's memory disc is returned to him, after which he remembers his true name, Wes Bluemarine, that Pucci is in fact his long-lost twin brother, and the torment he went through before his memories were taken. With his memories returned, Weather unleashes his Stand's true powers on the world and faces Pucci in combat. Weather Report is ultimately killed, and Pucci continues on to Cape Canaveral in time for the new moon. Jolyne and company catch up to Pucci but all seems lost when they are faced by the next evolution of his Stand, C-Moon. Jotaro arrives just in time and defends Jolyne and her friends from Pucci. However, Pucci is able to survive and realizes he can use C-Moon to replicate the gravitational conditions required for his plan. Unlocking his ultimate stand, Made in Heaven, Pucci speeds up time itself causing the rapid acceleration of the world around Pucci and the Joestar group. Pucci aims Made in Heaven to maneuver Stone Free into successfully killing Anasui, but Jotaro is able to stop time. Made in Heaven greatly shortens Jotaro‚Äôs time stop, and upon saving Jolyne from Pucci‚Äôs attack, Jotaro and Ermes are killed in front of Emporio. Jolyne sacrifices herself to halt Pucci and save Emporio, being quickly obliterated by Made in Heaven‚Äôs punches. The final effects of Made in Heaven are completed when time accelerates to the end of the universe, leading to a new cycle of time and a parallel universe in its place, where all surviving humans have precognitive understanding of fated actions in their lives; all deceased humans became different, but similar versions of themselves. Pucci, who believed that such knowledge of one's fate would bring all people happiness, proceeds to hunt down Emporio to ensure that the future does not change. As he is about to kill Emporio, he inadvertently changes fate when Made in Heaven pushes Weather Report's Stand Disc into Emporio‚Äôs head. Although Pucci accelerates time once more, Emporio is able to use Weather Report to raise the concentration of the oxygen around him, causing both him and Pucci to suffer from oxygen poisoning. Pucci pleads with Emporio not to kill him, but Emporio uses Weather Report to crush Pucci‚Äôs head. The universe reaches its end again, and another parallel universe is formed, without the precognitive effects of Pucci's universe. Within the new universe, Emporio meets a young woman who looks identical to Ermes, and a couple in a car who look similar to Jolyne and Anasui introduce themselves as Irene and Anakiss. They offer Emporio and the new Ermes a ride as they head to see Irene's father. Irene pushes Anakiss to pick up another hitchhiker who bears a striking resemblance to Weather Report as they drive off in the rain. Characters *' is an inmate at Green Dolphin Street Jail, and is the daughter of the Stardust Crusaders main protagonist Jotaro Kujo. Her Stand is Stone Free, which allows her to unravel her body into elastic thread. *' is an inmate who got her sentence on purpose, intending to get revenge on her sister's killer, Sports Maxx. She uses the Stand Kiss, which allows her to place stickers on objects that duplicate the objects perfectly until the sticker is removed, at which point the duplicate and the original will violently fuse together, leaving the object damaged. *', shortened to F.F., is a sapient being consisting of plankton, and is its own Stand. *' is a boy born to an unknown inmate in Green Dolphin Street Jail. His Stand, Burning Down the House, manifests in the form of a ghost room that he secretly lives in, together with Weather Report and Narciso Anasui. *' is an amnesic inmate who aides Jolyne at Emporio's request. His Stand, also named Weather Report, allows him to manipulate the weather and the atmosphere. *' is an inmate who is in love with Jolyne, and wishes to marry her despite her clearly not being interested in him. His stand, Diver Down, allows him to phase himself or his Stand into objects, or into others' bodies to absorb damage dealt to them. *Jotaro Kujo returns from Stardust Crusaders and Diamond is Unbreakable as Jolyne‚Äôs father.

Pucci uses the Stand Whitesnake, which allows him to torture his prisoners to their breaking point by extracting their memories and Stands in the form of compact discs; he can then insert these disks into their bystanders for information about their crimes against the public so that he may mercilessly crucify his prisoners without trial. Whitesnake eventually evolves into C-Moon, giving Pucci the ability to reverse the gravity of the area around him, as well as the gravity of anything the Stand touches. After evolving once more, C-Moon changes into Made in Heaven, gaining the power to gradually speed up time until reaching a new parallel universe. In reality, Pucci seeks to avenge DIO and continue his plans by wiping out Jolyne and her family line of Joestars, and therefore rewriting reality into DIO's image.

Set in 1890, it stars Gyro Zeppeli, a disgraced former executioner, and Johnny Joestar, a former star jockey who was shot and lost the use of his legs, as well as his fame and fortune. They, along with others, compete in the titular cross- continental race for $50 million, but the race has a hidden agenda behind it. Originally the first 23 chapters (4 volumes) were serialized in Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump in 2004 simply under the title Steel Ball Run. Although the character's names are obviously related to the series, it was unclear if the story was a part of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. However, when the series moved to Ultra Jump in 2005, it was officially announced as part 7 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, but in an alternate universe, like the following and current arc, JoJolion. The 95 chapters were combined into 24 tank≈çbon volumes (volumes 81‚Äì104 of the entire series), following the trend set by the previous part, Stone Ocean, of starting over the volume count. A couple of chapters were adapted into a \\"Vomic\\" series, which has voice actors act over the manga pages as they are shown on screen. Plot The series is set in 1890 in an alternate reality from all previous JoJo's Bizarre Adventure parts, where racing jockeys from all over the world flock to the United States to take part in the titular Steel Ball Run ‚Äî a cross-country horse race from San Diego to New York City with a prize of fifty million dollars. Johnny Joestar, a former jockey who fell from glory after a shooter paralyzed him from the waist down, enters the race after meeting the mysterious Gyro Zeppeli to learn the secrets of the man's Spin technique which temporarily restored his mobility. While beginning as rivals, Johnny and Gyro become friends as they travel through the wilderness while fending off violent competitors. As Gyro begins teaching Johnny the secrets of the Spin, his own background is explored through flashbacks. He is a former executioner from Naples who is competing in the Steel Ball Run not for his own gain, but to win the favor of the Neapolitan royalty and thus prevent the unjust execution of a young boy, Marco, who has been falsely accused of treason. The two continue their progression through the race, all the while being attacked by various assassins, terrorists, and outlaws. Although the Steel Ball Run is organized by the eccentric oil tycoon Stephen Steel, it is revealed that the race is backed by the United States government. Steel is unaware of the actual agenda of US President Funny Valentine: the race is a means for Valentine to collect the scattered pieces of a two-thousand-year-old corpse known as the Saint's Corpse (implied to be the body of Jesus Christ, brought to America by Joseph of Arimathea) so he can use the reassembled body to achieve incredible power. Stephen's wife Lucy discovers this plot and finds out that Valentine already possesses one part of the Corpse, the heart. After Johnny and Gyro encounter another piece of the Saint's Corpse, it is absorbed into Johnny's body and he develops the Stand Tusk, allowing him to fend off one of Valentine's minions. Later, they meet the mysterious racer Diego Brando (a counterpart to the character Dio Brando, a major antagonist in previous installments of the series), who obtains one of two Corpse eyes, while Gyro gains the other. Lucy intercepts a message to Valentine about the Corpse parts, making her a target for his men. She is able to escape him and with Johnny and Gyro's help she finds one of the parts. With the information provided by Lucy, Johnny and Gyro decide to search for the next three Corpse parts while sending Lucy, with the advantage of Gyro's Corpse eye, to take the Heart from Valentine himself. Meanwhile, Diego makes a deal with Valentine to help him deal with the traitor (who Valentine does not know is Lucy). Partnered with another racer, Diego attacks Johnny and Gyro. Gyro teaches Johnny how to use the Golden Ratio found in nature to amplify the power of the Spin, which evolves his Stand and allows him to defeat the other racer with this technique, but Diego escapes and all but one of the Corpse parts are stolen by another racer, Hot Pants. Johnny and Gyro are next forced to deal with a Stand based on the fable of The Honest Woodman by Aesop, which grants them a considerable fortune alongside another Corpse part but forces them to get rid of both before sunrise or else they will be trapped within an ancient tree forever and become the new users of the Stand, making the same deal with passersby. The duo spend the money hiring a mercenary force to fend off Valentine's henchmen, but Gyro is nearly lost forever until Johnny trades away the Corpse parts to the last survivor of Valentine's forces, saving Gyro's life but leaving them with nothing. Lucy uses Hot Pants' Stand to disguise herself as Valentine's wife Scarlet, while Hot Pants steals several Corpse parts from Valentine, including the Heart. Johnny and Gyro are led to a garbage dump by Hot Pants, only for all three to be nearly defeated by one of Valentine's men, who takes all of the parts they have collected. With the help of a vision of the Saint, Johnny's Stand develops new powers in combination with the Spin. Before he can win the battle, however, Valentine arrives and kills his own minion, then leaves along with all the Corpse parts except for the undiscovered head and the eyes possessed by Diego and Lucy. Upon returning to the Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Valentine uncovers Lucy's disguise and takes her captive after she fuses with the Corpse and seemingly becomes pregnant with the Corpse's head. Lucy escapes from captivity, only to be lured into Valentine's clutches once again. Diego and Hot Pants ally against Valentine, chasing him and Lucy to a trainyard while being followed themselves by Johnny and Gyro. Diego and Hot Pants fight Valentine on the moving train but his Stand ‚ÄúD4C‚Äù (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap) allows for multiple universes to exist simultaneously. Valentine's stand ability proves to be far too dangerous as Diego is lured to his death after Valentine pulls him under the moving train, bisecting him. Hot Pants is killed when space time distortions cause multiple solid objects to converge with her heart, instantly killing her. Lucy begins to metamorphose into a being resembling the Saint's Corpse. This grants Valentine even further powers in the form of an ability for D4C called Love Train, a dimensional wall of light that redirects all harm away from Valentine and randomly redistributes it as misfortune across the world. Johnny and Gyro arrive and attempt to battle the seemingly invulnerable Valentine. Johnny is momentarily incapacitated as Gyro and Valentine take their fight towards the Atlantic Ocean, with Gyro unlocking his stand ‚ÄúBall Breaker‚Äù utilizing the Golden Spin and the Steel Balls. Gyro is able to pass Johnny a cryptic hint regarding The Golden Spin, a form of spin utilizing gravity. Although Ball Breaker is able to pass through Love Train and greatly damage Valentine, he unexpectedly survives Ball Breakers second attack however, and kills Gyro after multiple wounds travel towards his heart. At the last possible second, Johnny understands Gyros hint and is able to achieve the Golden Spin with Tusk, unlocking ACT 4, which allows Johnny to mark objects or beings with infinite rotation. Valentine is horrified as Tusk ACT 4's attack is able to breach his dimensional wall and mark D4C with infinite rotation. Pursued by infinite rotation regardless of which dimension he travels to, Valentine is forced to surrender and attempts to make a deal with Johnny, offering to resurrect Gyro by finding a version of him in another universe in exchange for the Corpse. Johnny nearly agrees but realizes that this is a trick after he notices Valentine holding a gun taken from another universe, which he intended to kill Johnny with if he let his guard down. Johnny kills Valentine in a fierce standoff, but realizes somebody else has taken the Corpse, now separate from Lucy. Pursuing this unknown enemy into the final stage of the Steel Ball Run, Johnny is shocked to find that it is an alternate version of Diego Brando, taken from a different universe by Valentine and entrusted with the Corpse. Unlike the previous Diego, this one possesses the time-stopping Stand of Dio Brando, THE WORLD. A flashback reveals that Valentine has educated the alternate Diego on the dangers of Tusk ACT 4 and a battle on the streets of New York begins. The new Diego is able to stop time for Johnny utilizing THE WORLD, however, Tusk ACT 4 is shown to be able to slightly mitigate the time stop by the use of gravity. Diego eventually outsmarts Johnny by weaponizing Tusk ACT 4's own Golden Spin against it. THE WORLD is attacked by ACT 4, but Diego uses his stand to sever his leg which was attacked by the infinite rotation and redirects it at Johnny. Overwhelmed by his own stand ability, Johnny begins to die. Diego then goes on to win the race in first place. He brings the Corpse to Trinity Church, where Valentine intended to lock it in a vault so that its powers would protect America forever. At the last moment, Lucy arrives with the severed head of the previous Diego. Terrified, Diego stops time with THE WORLD, but is unable to crawl up the stairs with his missing leg and accidentally comes into contact with the root world Diego's head. Since parallel instances of the same person cannot come into contact without destroying each other, Alternate Diego fuses with the original Diego's head, instantly killing him and his Stand. With Diego missing, first place is awarded to the carefree Pocoloco, who had slept through the start of the race and only caught up by sheer luck. Stephen Steel arrives to save Johnny, who is able to reverse his own spin with his Stand after being assisted onto a horse. Valentine's death is covered up as a retirement from public life, with concerns over the race placated by the donation of the prize money to charitable causes. Johnny, having regained his ability to walk through the power of his Stand and the Spin, leaves America to return Gyro's body to his family. On the boat he meets the Japanese racer Norisuke Higashikata, whose daughter Rina he later marries, leading to the events of Part 8, JoJolion. Characters * ' is a former horse racer from Kentucky, who is paralyzed from the waist down. He participates in the Steel Ball Run to follow Gyro Zeppeli and learn how to use his Spin technique, to be able to stand again, but for the most part, uses his horse Slow Dancer in lieu of his legs. He uses the Stand Tusk, which allows him to shoot his finger nails as bullets. Tusk later evolves into different ACTs with differing capabilities, similar to Koichi Hirose's stand Echoes. * ' is a disgraced magistrate and executioner from the Kingdom of Naples, who participates in the Steel Ball Run to free a boy who he believes has been wrongly imprisoned. He is a master of a mystical art called the Spin, which is channeled through the steel balls he throws, with both combative and medical effects. Gyro has an acute knowledge of the human body, which he demonstrates during certain encounters and is well versed in surgical skills. Gyro eventually unlocks his stand Ball Breaker during the final battle. Ball Breaker induces senescence in its targets. * ' is a fourteen-year-old girl who tries to help Johnny and Gyro, and is the wife of the Steel Ball Run promoter Stephen Steel. She uses the Stand Ticket to Ride, which allows her to redirect misfortune every time her tears cuts on someone, which eventually paved the way for D4C's evolved form, Love Train. * ' is the 23rd President of the United States, and a former soldier. He uses the Stand Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, which allows him to travel between alternate dimensions when he is pressed between two objects. D4C can also cause space time distortions although this ability seems to be a byproduct of D4C's dimensional abilities. * ', nicknamed \\"Dio\\", is a Steel Ball Run participant from the United Kingdom, and a rival to Gyro and Johnny. He uses the Stand Scary Monsters, which allows him to transform into a Utahraptor. Later, an alternate version of Diego is summoned by Valentine. This Diego is far more similar to the original DIO, and even uses THE WORLD as his Stand. Both versions of Diego retain an identical appearance. * ' is a Steel Ball Run participant from the United States, and a former nun. She uses the Stand Cream Starter, which takes the form of a spray bottle that can turn flesh into a foam-like substance and spray it to fuse the flesh with people's bodies. * ' is a former Neapolitan royal guard who is hired and partnered with the Stand user Magent Magent to protect Valentine. He uses the Spin, wielding a steel ball called Wrecking Ball, which can release smaller, blinding balls if the main ball is blocked or misses. * ' is the promoter of the Steel Ball Run and is the middle-aged husband of Lucy Steel. Production alt=A 2013 photograph of Hirohiko Araki Steel Ball Run was written and illustrated by Hirohiko Araki, and was originally serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump magazine from January 19 to October 16, 2004. It was later moved to Shueisha's monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump on March 19, 2005, and ran until April 19, 2011. Araki found that the new, monthly schedule with longer chapters suited him better, as he was not as restricted in what he could draw and no longer had to write stories with momentum building up excitement for the next week's chapter, and had more flexibility to draw at his own pace. Araki described the manga's theme as \\"seeking for satisfaction\\". Like with other parts of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Araki also used \\"an affirmation that humanity is wonderful\\" as a theme, which he explained as a description for humanity's ability to grow and overcome hardships through one's strength and spirit, portrayed through people succeeding in fights through their own actions, without relying on machines or gods. Because the series follows a race across America, Araki had to split his research into three trips: one from the West Coast to the deserts, one from the Great Plains to the Mississippi River and Chicago, and one to New York. He said that it would have been impossible to get an understanding for the vast scale without having gone there personally, describing the scenery of the midwest as endless and unchanging. The feeling of distance made him think that if an enemy had approached, the open landscape would have meant that he could not have escaped due to a lack of places to hide, an experience he found useful when drawing the manga. Like other protagonists in the series, Johnny was designed to symbolize the part's story and setting, and to stand out among the previous protagonists in terms of appearance, clothing, and silhouette. He was not specifically planned to have a disability at the start of the production; rather, his disability was the result of the series' focus on protagonists growing through overcoming hardships, and Araki wanting to create a character who was forced to rely on people and horses during the race and had room to grow both mentally and physically. Valentine was created as part of Araki noticing more and more that good and evil is not always easily distinguishable and taking a greater interest in the motivations for people who do bad things. He noted that Valentine's patriotism and goals seemed just and might line up with leaders in the real world, and that it is his sacrifice of powerless people to reach his goals that make him evil and completely unsuitable as a protagonist. The concept of having the United States president fighting the main characters came from when Araki saw the film Independence Day, and liked the idea of a president who fights. Chapters=Original volumization2017 release=Reception Kono Manga ga Sugoi! recommended Steel Ball Run as a good place to start for people who have not read previous parts, due to how it serves as a reboot of the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, and appreciated how its move to the monthly seinen magazine Ultra Jump enabled Araki to write longer stories and depict things that would have been difficult to do in a sh≈çnen magazine. Erkael of Manga-News called the manga one of the best in the series, and said that it does not disappoint the reader at any point. Anime News Network called Steel Ball Run an interesting take on the battle manga genre due to its positive portrayal of a hero with a disability, and found it, along with JoJolion, to represent a big shift in the evolution of Araki's art, following his earlier shift from muscle men to thinner characters and fashion. K. Thor Jensen of Geek.com called the portrayal of Johnny and Gyro's relationship one of the best platonic friendships in comics, citing their transition from rivals to close allies who make sacrifices for one another and help each other with their respective abilities. Erkael liked the high speed and intensity of the story, saying that it was as if Araki wanted the reader to feel like they were part of the race themselves, and how the story eventually opens up to follow several different characters whose paths at times intersect, leading to a world that feels \\"rich and dense\\". They wrote that the lack of Stands early in the story, with Gyro instead using steel balls, was surprising but refreshing, and reminiscent of the hamon abilities featured in the first part in the JoJo's Bizarre Adventure series, Phantom Blood; they still enjoyed the shift in focus to Stand abilities later in the story, calling them \\"original and surprising\\". Kono Manga ga Sugoi! liked the depiction of the landscapes Johnny and Gyro travel through, calling them \\"beautiful\\".

Basinger plays a suburban housewife who is forced to fend for herself when she becomes stranded in a desolate forest with four murderous thugs including the young ‚ÄúHuey‚Äù played by Jamie Starr. It was written and directed by film producer Susan Montford based on a short story by Edward Bryant which was originally an episode of the TV series The Hidden Room in 1993. The film was produced by Mary Aloe and Don Murphy. Its executive producers included Guillermo del Toro and Basinger. The film was shot in 2006 and had a very limited release in 5 theaters in Texas during 2008. Plot On Christmas Eve, suburban housewife Della Myers gets into an argument with her abusive husband Kenneth. After putting her two children to bed, she drives to the mall to buy some wrapping paper and cards. At the mall, she can't find a parking space for a while and angrily leaves a note on the window of a car that is parked using up two parking spaces. She leaves the store as the mall is closing, and the parking lot is nearly deserted. She notices the note is gone from the 'offending' car. As she enters her own car, the car on which she had left the note pulls up behind her. She confronts the car, and four young men emerge‚ÄîHuey, Vingh, and Tom√°s‚Äîled by Chuckie. They threaten to rape her. Della insults Chuckie, and a security guard intervenes, but he is shot dead by Chuckie. As the gang realizes that they have committed a murder, Della manages to start her car and drive away. They follow her, intending to kill her, as she is the only witness. As they pursue her some distance, she eventually crashes her car in a deserted area where homes are under construction. She takes a road flare and a toolbox out of her car and hides behind a backhoe. Della runs through the buildings under construction to hide as they search for her. After some time, the thugs corner and threaten her by name, as they had found her drivers license in her purse in her car. As they have her open the toolbox, she hits Chuckie with a crescent wrench, and escapes again into some nearby woods. In the process of chasing her, Tom√°s accidentally steps on Huey, who falls through a construction site and dies from a broken neck. After some hide and seek in the woods, Della beats and finally kills Tom√°s with a lug wrench. She flees through a creek, pursued by Chuckie and Vingh. Della sneaks up on Vingh and kills him with a screwdriver and hides behind a fallen tree. Chuckie tries to persuade Della to give up; he talks about her kids, saying that he is going to pay them a visit. He tells her what he thinks of her, that she lives a boring life she doesn't want, mistreated by her husband. He finds her, touches, and teases her face. She holds his hand, pulls him down and they kiss. He draws his weapon as they engage in foreplay. She tells him to have sex with her, and as he is distracted she ignites the road flare and blinds him, takes his weapon, and kills him. Della returns home. Her husband Kenneth complains she was out late and is tracking mud throughout the house, but Della ignores him. She goes upstairs to check on her children who are both sleeping. The drunk Kenneth asks what she brought him from the mall, and she replies, \\"Nothing\\", and points the gun at him.

In 2013, a second branch of MusicHall was opened in Dubai, UAE.Article in My Metro Talk Dubai In that same year Elefteriades also opened \\"MusicHall Waterfront\\" in Beirut, an open-air venue near Downtown Beirut's sea side. And in the summer of 2019, the MusicHall landed in Jeddah, making it the very first club to open in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In 2015, he purchased a Renaissance palace in Florence, central Italy, dating back to the 15th century. The Palazzo Magnani Feroni is currently a suites accommodation in the heart of Florence and has the highest panoramic roof terrace in the Oltrarno area from which you can see all the major monuments of the city. In the summer of 2017, Michel Elefteriades opened a new restaurant-lounge, B By Elefteriades, a lavish temple dedicated to the senses and to good taste.  Fine arts  As a painter, his works have been presented at several collective exhibitions in France, Germany and Lebanon. In 1995, he presented The Wailing Wall, a 10x2 meters piece of art, at a special edition of the Salon des Artistes D√©corateurs that took place in the Beirut Central District (instead of its customary location at Paris' Grand Palais). This showing produced such controversy that it required special protection. As a sculptor, Michel Elefteriades has worked on a series of bronze sculptures which represent capitalism and its influence on men and society. In January 2016, Elefteriades has been summoned to the police station to testify in a case about a supposed sect of satanic worshipers. Some of his work has been interpreted as satanic symbols. Hence, he finds himself in the middle of a controversy orchestrated by the Lebanese Forces in order to intimidate him.  Politics  Elefteriades has engaged in political activism from the age of 15. He was an extreme left- wing militant growing up in east Beirut. In 1989, Elefteriades committed himself to the political movement of then Lebanese Prime Minister, General Michel Aoun. M.U.R. A M.U.R. poster On 13 October 1990, Syrian forces launched an attack on the Lebanese army, defeating General Aoun; and occupied what still remained of Lebanon's free territory. Elefteriades fled to France. In 1991, he came back to Lebanon and founded the Unified Movements of the Resistance (or M.U.R.), which he led until 1994. M.U.R. was a clandestine, armed group whose stated goal was fighting Lebanon's occupation by foreign armies. Elefteriades was often involved in organizing general strikes designed to paralyze the country. M.U.R. was considered an illegal labor organization and its activities often had to be implemented secretively. During this period, Elefteriades was the intended victim of two assassination attempts. The first one destroyed his car with a booby-trap; the second attempt targeted him in an armed ambush. He again left Lebanon, living in France and Cuba from 1994 until 1997. Elefteriades was active in Lebanon's Cedar Revolution as he co-organized, in April 2005, a series of festivities to celebrate national unity, including a program of free concerts that took place in downtown Beirut under the heading of \\"Independence 05\\". Activism On 8 October 2007, during a press conference commemorating Che Guevara's capture 40 years earlier, Elefteriades launched a public campaign called \\"We Won‚Äôt Pay Lebanon‚Äôs Odious Debts\\". The action was meant to put pressure on the state to take action on Lebanon's unprecedented public debt of about 40 billion US Dollars, which, at the time of the press conference, was the highest debt-to- GDP ratio in the world. The main objective of the campaign was to raise awareness inside and outside of the country about the nature of Lebanon's loans with the end goal of abolishing its debt. As a result of his activities, the Association of Banks in Lebanon called for the prosecution of Elefteriades, viewing him as a threat to Lebanon's financial stability.

Previously known as The Beach Waterpark, it features ten water attractions, several children's areas, sand volleyball and basketball courts, pool-side beverage service and other special events. The Beach was named the best privately owned water park by Aquatics International Magazine in 2010. In March 2012, The Beach announced it would be closing its doors after operating at a loss for several years, citing a bad economy and poor attendance. In July 2012, Adventure Landing LLC based in Florida announced plans to lease and reopen the water park as The Beach at Adventure Landing. It reopened to the public on May 18, 2013. History The beach began development in December 1984, since its opening in 1985, The Beach has remained a privately owned and operated facility by the Bunnel Hill Developmental Company. Although it does not always reveal exact numbers, The Beach averages 300,000 visitors per year. Since the early 2000s, The Beach has featured local DJ's on Tuesday nights during the summer for their Club Aqua Splash teen night. The Beach announced on March 9, 2012, that the park would not reopen for the 2012 season. Ralph Vilardo Jr., spokesperson for The Beach Waterpark, released a statement saying, ‚ÄúWe have been proud to provide entertainment and employment to Southwest Ohioans for more than 27 years. Like many businesses these days, we had to make the difficult decision to close after concluding that further investment to support the business cannot be justified.‚Äù Those who had purchased 2012 season passes were offered discounts and passes to other local attractions, such as Kings Island and the Cincinnati Zoo. A lawsuit was filed by Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine in response to hundreds of complaints that the proposed substitutions were inadequate. Adventure Holdings LLC, parent company of the Adventure Landing amusement park chain based in Florida, announced plans to lease The Beach Waterpark and rename it to The Beach at Adventure Landing. On March 6, 2013, the park was officially sold to National Retail Properties LP, an affiliate of Adventure Holdings LLC, for $3 million. The company held a job fair later that month to hire 500 employees and invested $5 million in renovations to the park, which reopened to the public on May 18, 2013. Attractions The Beach featured more than 50 rides and attractions including: *Riptide Racer A heart pounding 4 lane racing slide using racing mats. *Kamikaze A flume ride in the park that features a towering plunge of twists and turns including a 360-degree turn.

Reservations are recommended to guarantee a cabana.  Holiday Fest Holiday Fest at The Beach was an event that took place every year from late November to early January. Water slides were converted to toboggan runs, the wave pool became an ice rink, and the park was illuminated with holiday lighting. The event also featured carriage and pony rides. The name later changed to \\"The Beach on Ice\\". The Spirit Splash Ice Skating Rink featured at the event covered .

During the first week of school in 1970, the 700 students that attended met in the gym because it was the only completed part of the building. The school building had an open-concept design and the class schedule was a flexible modular one, based on 15-minute increments. Nearly all instruction was individualized. The first major change to scheduling was in the 1976-77 school year, which had a more traditional 7-period schedule. In 1978, it was changed to a 6-period schedule. The math department was the last to conduct primarily individualized instruction, doing so until the 1982-1983 school year. Major changes to the building took place in 1980 with a $3.3 million construction project. Some classes were held in portables until spring 1981. The construction included the Language-Arts building, auto shop, graphics and journalism areas, weight room and wrestling addition, and the student commons. During the 1985-86 school year, the softball and soccer fields were added. In 1987, the all- weather track was completed. In 2000, the swimming pool was renovated. In 1989, the heating and air conditioning systems were updated. In 2006, voters approved a $66 million fund to build a new main building, and in 2008, the new building was opened and the old main building demolished later that year.

Student newspaper The Gaudie is produced fortnightly during term time at the University of Aberdeen. It is free and is distributed around the Kings College Campus and throughout the city. Television For over 45 years, Aberdeen has been home to the ITV regional franchise for northern Scotland, Grampian Television, broadcast from a converted tram depot in the Queens Cross area. Since a takeover by the Scottish Media Group (now STV Group plc) in 1997, Grampian's identity and local programming output have gradually been depleted: now Grampian is officially known as STV North, and broadcasts from smaller studios in the Tullos area of the city. The local news programme STV News at Six is still produced from Aberdeen alongside regional commercials. BBC Scotland also have a base in Aberdeen's Beechgrove area. BBC Aberdeen is most known for Tern TV's production of The Beechgrove Garden television and BBC radio programmes. Local radio Aberdeen has three local commercial radio stations: Northsound 1 on 96.9, 97.6 & 103 FM, Northsound 2 on 1035 AM, and Original 106 on 106.8 & 106.3 FM. The two Northsound stations operated as a single station, Northsound Radio, until 1995. BBC Radio Scotland broadcasts local news opt-out bulletins for Aberdeen and North East Scotland on weekdays. Latest audience figures put Northsound 1 as the number one radio station in the area. Original 106 have increased their audience share to become the second most listened to local radio station , with 100% of programming output produced and presented in-house. Northsound 2 programming output is mostly generated from Glasgow and Edinburgh, with some from Dundee, and is shared across all AM stations in the Bauer Media Group. Northsound 1 broadcasts locally-generated programming from their Aberdeen studios for 8 hours during weekdays: 4 hours in the morning and 4 in the afternoon. The rest of the output (16 hours per day) is shared programming from Glasgow and Manchester. There is also a community radio station called North East Community Radio FM (NECR FM), broadcasting from Kintore, Aberdeenshire whose signal reaches some parts of Aberdeen city. The Station House Media Unit (based at Station House, a partially National Lottery-funded community project) runs a radio station broadcasting with a five-year community licence on 99.8 MHz FM, known as SHMU FM. Before it acquired its FM licence, the station was available on the internet. In the 1990s, the Aberdeen University Students' Association (then known as the Aberdeen University Students' Assembly, and acting through one of its constituent bodies, the Students' Representative Council) obtained a Restricted Service Licence (RSL) for temporary FM radio broadcasts; its station was first known as Slick FM. This has now become the internet station Aberdeen Student Radio, which broadcasts every day during term time from the Kings College campus. In addition, a multi-ethnic community organisation entitled Multi-ethnic Aberdeen Ltd. runs Multi-ethnic FM (Me FM) on an annual basis using an RSL and has said it hopes to apply for a permanent licence.

The Lemon Tree is another small theatre that has small theatrical programmes such as pantomimes at Christmas and small charity events. Art Aberdeen gained prominence in the art world by introducing Scottish art to the rest of Britain and the world through the works of George Jamesone. Jamesone's achievements provided the opportunity for other Scottish artists to follow in his footsteps and make their art available throughout Scotland, and the rest of the world. In 1884 a neo-Classical building was built for the purpose of displaying the world's finest art; subsequently this was called the Aberdeen Art Gallery. Within this Gallery the impressive permanent painting collection of Damien Hirst, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Francis Bacon, Monet and Renoir have been held for over 100 years, allowing the inhabitants of Aberdeen and visitors to the city alike to admire their collected works in one central hub. Grampian Hospitals Arts Trust (GHAT) arose from the simple idea that improving the hospital environment by displaying art made everyone who spent time in the buildings feel better. GHAT strives to highlight culture as a central component of wellbeing and is a sector leader in developing bespoke arts projects for people visiting, working or utilising the services within hospitals and healthcare.

It is said that, one day, while Francis was travelling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \\"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\\" The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away.Bonaventure (1867), pp. 78‚Äì85 The key of the piece is A major, often associated by Liszt with religious sentiment.Walker (1989), p. 154.

This set of episodes begins with Jotaro Kujo and his companions in the middle of their quest to find Dio Brando, offering very little exposition to the back-story that led to the present events of the OVA.

Controversy In May 2008, both studio A.P.P.P. and Shueisha halted OVA/manga shipments of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure after a complaint had been launched against them from Egyptian Islamic fundamentalists, after noticing a scene in the OVAs that has the villain, Dio Brando, reading a book depicting pages from the Qur'an. This recall affected the English-language release of the manga as well, causing Viz Media and Shueisha to cease publication for a year. Even though the manga did not feature that specific scene, Shueisha had Araki redraw scenes that depicted characters fighting on top of, and destroying, mosques. Viz resumed publication a year later, with the eleventh volume being published on April 7, 2009.

With this method, surface features (objects) are used as reference points for microscope probe attachment. Actually, FOP is a simplified variant of the feature-oriented scanning (FOS). With FOP, no topographical image of a surface is acquired. Instead, a probe movement by surface features is only carried out from the start surface point A (neighborhood of the start feature) to the destination point B (neighborhood of the destination feature) along some route that goes through intermediate features of the surface. The method may also be referred to by another name‚Äîobject-oriented positioning (OOP). To be distinguished are a \\"blind\\" FOP when the coordinates of features used for probe movement are unknown in advance and FOP by existing feature \\"map\\" when the relative coordinates of all features are known, for example, in case they were obtained during preliminary FOS. Probe movement by a navigation structure is a combination of the above- pointed methods. FOP method may be used in bottom-up nanofabrication to implement high-precision movement of the nanolithograph/nanoassembler probe along the substrate surface. Moreover, once made along some route, FOP may be then exactly repeated the required number of times. After movement in the specified position, an influence on the surface or manipulation of a surface object (nanoparticle, molecule, atom) is performed. All the operations are carried out in automatic mode. With multiprobe instruments, FOP approach allows to apply any number of specialized technological and/or analytical probes successively to a surface feature/object or to a specified point of the feature/object neighborhood. That opens a prospect for building a complex nanofabrication consisting of a large number of technological, measuring, and checking operations.

The next principal, Rob Haring, moved from Hanley Castle High School, a specialist language college in Worcestershire, to assume office at the start of 2010. The school introduced blazers to the uniform and new PE kits at the start of the 2010/11 academic year. In June 2010, it was announced that it had applied to become an academy, independent from Devon County Council's control and funded directly from central government. This took effect in November 2010. New PE kit was introduced in 2016/17. The new principal, former Team GB gymnast, Rachel Hutchinson, moved from St Peter's School in Exeter to become Principal as of September 2016.  Academics  The only secondary school in Ivybridge, Ivybridge Community College offers a range of student facilities and is usually over-subscribed. The college received an outstanding report from Ofsted in 2006, 2011 and 2013.  Curriculum  The college curriculum follows the national curriculum of England and Wales and offers French and Spanish for a compulsory modern foreign language. Year 8 students in upper classes study a second language as well. Students choose 4 GCSE subjects, alongside Maths, English, Science, General Studies and Physical Education, which are compulsory. (Note that General Studies is not a GCSE but is taught for PSHE purposes. Science is taught for six hours a week compared to 3 each for maths and English (KS3). For KS4, students have 5 hours of English, 4 hours of maths and either 4 or 6 hours of science per week. Higher standard science students do Science and Additional Science and lower standard science students study the more vocational Science and Applied Science. The school has a sixth form for students to take AS and A levels and BTEC National Diplomas. The start of the school year in 2009 was the first year where some sixth formers studied International Baccalaureate diplomas alongside those choosing to do A levels. This follows the move to the IB by many Plymouth, Exeter and other Devon schools.  Results  In 2006, 84% of English students, 86% of maths students and 86% of science students achieved NC level 5 and above at the end of Key Stage 3. All results had improved since 2005 in particular English which rose by from 78%. In 2007, 22% of year 9 students achieved a level 7 in Physical Education, compared to the 6% of pupils in 2006. In the 2006 SATs the percentage of students at level 7 was just 8%, compared to the national average of 9%. At Key Stage 4, students take GCSEs and BTEC National Diplomas. In the period 2002‚Äì05, the average percentage of students achieving five or more A*‚ÄìC grades was 78% ‚Äî 22 points higher than the average for England and Devon (of 56%). At Sixth form (Key stage 5), tertiary education comprises AS levels/A2 levels taken in years 12 and 13, along with BTEC national diplomas. In 2006, 19% of results were As, 24% were Bs, 30% were Cs, 15% were Ds, 9% were Es and 2% were Us. Sport Sports facilities include 4 tennis courts, a former AstroTurf pitch now a 3G rubber crumb, 4 basketball courts, a fitness suite, a rugby pitch, a 200m concrete running track, a gymnasium, a large sports hall, a 100m synthetic long jump track, and a smaller rubber crumb; these are also used for extracurricular clubs. In 2006 the year 8 boys‚Äô football team reached the final of the Under 13 Coca-Cola Cup and the school rugby team participated in the Sanix World Rugby Youth Invitational Tournament. In 2011, the college represented England at the Sanix World Rugby Invitational Tournament.

The men are all sitting on the workbenches. (1944) The model David Gandy wearing a bespoke suit by Henry Poole & Co (2014) Henry Poole & Co is a bespoke tailor located at ‚Ññ15 Savile Row in London. The company made the first modern-style dinner jacket based on specifications that the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII) gave the company in the 1880s. The company advertises its long relationship with the British Royal Family. History The business opened first in Brunswick Square, in 1806, originally specializing in military tailoring, with particular merit at the time of the Battle of Waterloo. Their business moved to Savile Row in 1846, following the death of founder James Poole. Henry Poole ran the business until his death in 1876, and was succeeded by cousin Samuel Cundey, whose legacy continued, for five generations, to the present-day owners Angus Cundey and son Simon. The company still holds many royal warrants of appointment, and services the Lord Chamberlain's office with court dress, with their livery department even creating uniforms for the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar. The company are also credited with the creation of the dinner suit. In 2006, the company celebrated their bicentennial with a refurbishment of their premises and 2007 saw a re-issue of a suiting material made famous by Winston Churchill, a Henry Poole customer who ordered his first suit 100 years ago. The Dinner Suit In 1860, Henry Poole made a short evening or smoking jacket for the Prince of Wales to wear at informal dinner parties at Sandringham. In 1886, a Mr. James Potter of Tuxedo Park, New York, visited London and subsequently was invited by the Prince to spend a weekend at Sandringham House. He was also advised that he could have a smoking jacket made by the Prince‚Äôs tailors, Henry Poole & Co. When the Potters returned to New York, Mr. Potter proudly wore his new smoking jacket at the Tuxedo Club and fellow members soon started having copies made for themselves which they adopted as their informal uniform for club \\"stag\\" dinners. As a result, the dinner jacket became known as a tuxedo or tux in America.\\"The Henry Poole Story: The Tuxedo\\". Henry Poole and Co.

They are seen as an alternative to hotels. \\"Short Stay\\" rentals are an offshoot of the corporate housing market. Popular uses include vacation rental and relocation. This industry is seen as the most affordable option for month-long stays, and might be 25‚Äì50% cheaper than a hotel room. Some companies permit pets. Some booking procedures to be expected are credit checks, damage and holding deposits, and departure cleaning fees. Some renters have found that online photographs and descriptions were misleading, contact with the company in question is recommended. The proliferation of short-term rentals can affect those in the area who are looking for long-term rentals. Through short-term rental, landlords can make upwards of 20% more than they would on a rent controlled property. Thus landlords convert their properties into short-term rental units, and there are less long-term housing options available to permanent residents. Landlords also sometimes pressure and coerce people out of their homes, particularly if residents are of low-income. One of the effects of this is that diversity in the neighborhood decreases as no one can move in anymore. Neighborhood community groups voice concern that these temporary residents do not have a stake in the community and therefore are less likely to be conscientious about how their behavior effects those around them. Governments are taking measures to combat the rise in short-term rentals‚Äîfor example, London is now restricted to 90 days for any property on the short-term rental market. Short-term rental properties place the responsibility of following zoning and municipal requirements onto residents using short-term rental services like Airbnb. This leads to illegal short-term rentals that violate many of these codes. Fire codes, safety codes, workers' benefits, and transient occupancy taxes are often avoided by illegal short-term rentals. Not all short-term rental units are illegal, which poses a policy challenge to local lawmakers who have to find a way to mitigate the problems that they cause for permanent residents. For example, in Santa Cruz, California, local supervisors have discussed parking restrictions in the areas where short-term rentals are, in order to discourage people from staying there and prioritize the local residents' ability to park.

He was the son of William B. Davidson, an artillery officer in the United States Army, and the former Elizabeth Chapman Hunter. He was the eldest of four sons; his brothers were Hunter, Roger, and Charles. His father died from disease while serving in Florida during the Second Seminole War in 1840. His mother died ten years later, shortly after remarrying. He graduated from West Point in 1845. His father graduated from there in 1815.

In 1851, he married Clara McGunnegle, the daughter of a merchant in St. Louis. They had several children. Civil War He was allegedly offered a commission in the Confederate Army but turned it down.Eicher p.200 Davidson was transferred to the east and took command of a brigade in the newly formed Army of the Potomac. On February 6, 1862, President Abraham Lincoln appointed Davidson to the grade of brigadier general of U.S. volunteers, to rank from February 3, 1862, the same day the U.S. Senate confirmed the previously submitted nomination.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 7210 General Davidson assumed command of the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Division, IV Corps during the Peninsula Campaign. He fought at the battles of Yorktown and Williamsburg. During the Seven Days Battles he received brevet promotions in the Regular Army for his service at Gaines' Mill and Golding's Farm. Shortly after the culmination of the Seven Days' fighting, Davidson was transferred to the Trans-Mississippi Theater where he was placed in command of the Dist. of St. Louis. From December 3, 1862 to March 26, 1863 he was also in command of the so-called Army of Southeast Missouri until much of his army was transferred to Ulysses S. Grant in preparation for the Vicksburg Campaign. He retained command of the Dist. of St. Louis until June 16, 1863 when he briefly commanded the Dist. of Southeast Missouri. From August 10 to November 3, 1863 Davidson commanded the 1st Division of Frederick Steele's Army of Arkansas in his most distinguished role in the west. He led Union advance into central Arkansas and won the Battle of Bayou Fourche, which led directly to the fall of Confederate-held Little Rock. After the Little Rock expedition, Davidson commanded the cavalry in the Dept. of the Gulf before returning to command the cavalry in the Dist. of Southeast Missouri. Davidson's raid Beginning November 27, 1864, Davidson was ordered to lead a 4,000 strong cavalry raid from Union held Baton Rouge to sever the M & O Railroad near State Line, Mississippi. The raid was intended to divert resources away from Confederate John Bell Hood's operations near Nashville and to threaten and harass Mobile. Additionally, the raid was to support Sherman's March to the Sea by requiring the Confederates to keep resources in the Mobile theater of operations. After departing Baton Rouge Davidson's forces reached Greensburg capturing several Confederate prisoners, on November 29, 1864, then to Tangipahoa where they captured a confederate conscript camp and destroyed the New Orleans, Jackson, Great Northern Railroad.Michael J. Martin North and South Magazine http://mymichaeljamesmartin.com/uploads/N_S09.pdf On December 3, 1864 Davidson's Raiders crossed the Pearl River and entered Marion County, Mississippi occupying Columbia the next day. While in Columbia the cavalry foraged extensively in the area. General Davidson then ordered a diversionary feint toward's Monticello, Mississippi led by Major Seth Remington. After engaging in a brief skirmish outside Columbia Davidson's forces headed east towards Augusta. Upon Davidson's arrival receipt of certain intelligence made him alter his plans. An excerpt from Davidson's official report provides: \\"The day after my arrival at Augusta I found Mobile papers containing full accounts of our strength and design and our daily progress and marches were telegraphed to Meridian Where Gen. R. Taylor had his headquarters, and to Mobile.\\" As a result, Davidson decided to divide his command, sending a small element of the 2nd New York Veteran Cavalry, 1st Louisiana Cavalry, and a detachment of the 11th New York Cavalry under the command of Lt. Col. Asa Gurney north via Leakesville to destroy telegraph lines and a bridge on the Mobile and Ohio at State Line near the Alabama line, while he continued on toward Farley's Ferry.id. On December 10, 1864 elements of Davidson's forces met two regiments of Confederate Cavalry near Leakesville, Mississippi at McLeod's Mill. During the ensuring Battle of McLeod's Mill, one Union soldier stated the lead flew faster than he had ever seen before. The Confederates kept falling back to their main body. Finally, Lieutenant Albert Westinghouse, in command of the first squadron, was ordered to draw sabre and make a charge, which took them past the mill. Westinghouse in the vanguard spurred his horse and shouted to his men to \\"follow me\\", all the while swinging his sabre overhead. Westinghouse was shot in the stomach while making the charge and died shortly thereafter. Three charges were made against the Confederates after they had fallen back on their main body. The Union detachment soon realized they were now facing superior numbers with the advantage interior lines of communication, and therefore abandoned the mission. After withdrawing from the engagement, the Confederates did not follow in pursuit. When the fight concluded, three soldiers from the 2nd New York were killed, including Company B's 1st Lt. Albert Westinghouse along with Sgt. Theodore Moss and James Woods of Company A. After this struggle, two days later, Gurney rejoined Davidson's main column. According to different accounts around fourteen or fifteen Confederates were killed along with several being taken prisoner by the withdrawing column. For the remainder of the war, Davidson held various administrative commands in Mississippi. He was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Davidson for appointment to the grade of brevet major general of volunteers to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 711 On April 10, 1866, President Johnson nominated Davidson for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on May 4, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 733 On July 17, 1866, President Johnson nominated Davidson for appointment to the grade of brevet major general, U.S. Army, to rank from March 13, 1865, and the U.S. Senate confirmed the appointment on July 23, 1866.Eicher, 2001, p. 707 Following the end of the Civil War, Davidson was again posted on the Western frontier, this time as a lieutenant colonel of the 10th Cavalry, known as the Buffalo Soldiers.

John de Leche, however, was elected soon afterwards, and had the support of King Edward II of England. The diocese of Dunkeld lay vacant for three years, while the issue was contested at the Papal see.

He held the latter for two years.

It is based in Rakiraki, which is situated on the northern side of the main island of Viti Levu. Their home stadium is the Ra Sports Grounds. Their uniform is maroon shirt, white shorts and maroon socks.  History  Rakiraki F.C. was founded in 1938, with the formation of the Rakiraki Football Association, under the leadership of Edward Raman. It first took part in the Inter-District Competition (IDC) held in Lautoka in 1939, in which it was resoundingly defeated by Suva, in its first game, by nine goals to nil. In 1944, Rakiraki hosted the IDC for the only time. It reached the zenith of its performance when it surprised the other teams to qualify for the 1951 IDC final, which it lost to Suva by two goals to nil. Unlike the other football teams from the western division, Rakiraki performed poorly in the 1970s and 1980s, but it improved in the 1990s and created history in 2003 to win its first IDC in the senior division, winning again in 2004, 2006 and 2007. In the 2003 IDC, held in Govind Park, Rakiraki defeated T/Naitasiri 2‚Äì0.

Lifestyle Away from football, Matson's working was varied and somewhat inconsistent. He had stints as a miner, a tramway motorman, a farmer, a navvy on the trans-Australian railway, a lumper, a storeman and a 'Spot-Lager' retailer. Early in his career, he was a teetotaller but eventually became a \\"social\\" drinker and was well known for his gambling habit. His unconventional approach to life caused problems within his family, who were sometimes compelled to live in a tent. Matson offered to enlist during World War I; however, when rejected he opted to live as a licensed Swan River fisherman and involve himself more heavily in gambling. He operated two-up schools at Subiaco and Pelican Point, SP books in some city hotels, and later an illegal gaming house in Perth. For a number of years, he held a trotting bookmaker's licence. Swimming He worked as a navvies' water-boy in Western Australia, and began swimming competitively in 1902 and playing Australian football. He had been encouraged to take up football by his swimming trainer, William Howson (who had, himself, established a world-record in 1904, swimming underwater for 110 yards), in order to \\"harden himself\\" for his swimming.Matson's Early Helper Dies, The West Australian, (Wednesday, 21 April 1954), p.19.

On 19 February 1908, swimming at the Australian championships, conducted by the West Australian Amateur Swimming Association at Claremont, Western Australia, Matson set a world record time for the 220-yard breaststroke: three minutes and fourteen seconds, winning by a length (having touched equal first at the last turn).Matson broke the previous world record for the distance by three and two-fifths of a second; the second place-getter, Trevor Richardson, also broke the previous world record for the distance (by two and two fifths of a second): Swimming, The West Australian, (Thursday, 20 February 1908), p.5. Seven days later, on 26 February 1908, swimming at a swimming carnival in Kalgoorie, Matson broke his own world record by another three and two-fifths seconds, when he swam the distance in three minutes and ten and three-fifths of a second.Note that, because the timing was made in units of fifths of a second, Matson's time can not be represented as 3min 10.6secs.'Crawl', \\"Swimming Notes\\", The (Fremantle) Evening Mail, (Friday, 28 February 1908), p.4.

Coaching career=East Perth Aged 33, Matson found his calling when he was appointed as coach of East Perth Football Club in 1918. Matson worked on the players' confidence and garnered their respect with a methodical approach to his coaching. He was lauded for his ability to outwit opponents and exploit weaknesses. Matson's dominant personality helped recruit some excellent players and a dynasty was rapidly built. In nine seasons between 1919 and 1927, East Perth won seven premierships and dominated Western Australian football. In total, he played in twelve premiership teams and, in the last ten years of his career, coached teams into nine finals. WAFL He was an essential part of the state team,Phil Matson: The Man Behind the Team, The (Perth) Mirror, (Saturday, 28 July 1923), p.9. as a selector for the successful 1921 Western Australian interstate carnival team, and as the coach of the 1924,Off to the Tasmanian Football Carnival: Western Australia's Representatives, The Western Mail, (Thursday, 24 July 1924), p.21. and the 1927 teamsWill They Maintain Western Australia's Premiership?: The State's Representatives in the Football Carnival in Melbourne This Month, The Western Mail, (Thursday, 4 Aug 1927), p.6. that lost narrowly to Victoria. Controversially, he openly criticised Victorian officials in 1924 for encouraging violence against his team. This outburst came back to haunt him. Castlemaine (BFL) In 1925, Matson accepted an offer to coach the Castlemaine Football Club, in the Victorian goldfields, in the club's first year in the Bendigo Football League competition. He was cleared as both player (he played in 2 or 3 games) and as coach to Castlemaine in April 1925.Football, The Western Mail, (Thursday, 23 April 1925), p.25.

Matson accepted and relocated to Melbourne. However, the Victorian Football League (VFL) refused Matson a permit to take up the job, which incensed both the club and prospective coach.Matson Refused Clearance: May Return to Perth, The (Adelaide) News, (Thursday, 8 April 1926), p.9.

He was the deputy leader of the Nationals in the New South Wales Parliament from 2008 to 2016. Piccoli served as the Minister for Education between April 2011 and January 2017, in both the O'Farrell and Baird ministries. Personal life Of Italian descent, Piccoli was born in Griffith. He completed a Bachelor of Economics and a Bachelor of Laws at the Australian National University in 1993. Prior to starting his political career, Piccoli worked as an irrigation rice farmer and solicitor. He is married, has two children, and is a Roman Catholic. Political career Piccoli has represented Murrumbidgee for the Nationals since the 1999 state election. In 2008 he became the deputy leader of the National Party in the NSW Parliament. He was included in the Shadow Ministry of the O'Farrell/Stoner Liberal/Nationals Coalition. Following the Coalition victory in the 2011 New South Wales election, Piccoli was chosen by Premier Barry O'Farrell and Nationals Deputy Premier Andrew Stoner to be part of their cabinet as the Minister for Education. When Deputy Premier and Nationals leader Andrew Stoner announced his resignation in 2014, Piccoli as Stoner's deputy was expected to stand as a candidate to succeed him as Nationals leader but chose not to nominate for the leadership and instead remained deputy to new leader Troy Grant. It is believed that Piccoli did not have the numbers to beat Grant for the leadership, despite Grant's political inexperience. Stoner had endorsed Grant over Piccoli as his successor.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/coalition-shocked-as- nationals-leader-andrew-stoner-resigns-troy-grant-elected-unopposed/story- fni0cx12-1227091200977?nk=83831566956855aa201422df47aadf92 In 2016 Grant resigned as Deputy Premier and Nationals leader but Piccoli again did not stand for the leadership and instead stood down as deputy leader. Piccoli has promoted an educational reform called \\"Local Schools, Local Decisions\\" to give state schools more authority. Following a January 2017 reshuffle of the Berejiklian ministry, Piccoli was not appointed to the new ministry and issued a statement that he had ruled out resigning from politics before the next election. Ethics classes Ethics classes were introduced by the Keneally Labor government as an alternative for children who did not want to attend traditional scripture classes. Prior to the 2011 state election, Barry O'Farrell made a pre-election pledge of not scrapping the ethics classes. Following the election, Fred Nile, who was vehemently opposed to the ethics classes, introduced a private members bill proposing the abolition of the classes, arguing that the ethics course is based on a philosophy linked to Nazism and communism. Mike Baird's coalition government won the 2015 state election, promising to lease parts of the electricity grid to private operators, while Fred Nile held the balance of power in the upper house. While negotiating the lease of the electricity grid, Mike Baird announced changes to scripture enrolment forms, with the availability of ethics classes removed from forms sent to parents. The existence of ethics classes would only be made known to parents in a secondary form if they had chosen no scripture classes. The form would also remove the \\"no\\" box that allows parents to opt out of scripture classes for their children, making them tick no box. The changes were described as 'misleading and deceptive' by Anglican minister John Dickson. Adrian Piccoli's department blocked access to the chairman of Primary Ethics, despite holding meetings with faith-based lobby groups. The government made the enrolment process more complex in 2016, requiring parents to fill in multiple forms before being made aware that ethics classes are an option. Resignation On 4 September 2017, Piccoli announced he was resigning from parliament to accept a position at the University of New South Wales. He resigned on 15 September, triggering a by-election in his seat of Murray. Later career Piccoli is now the director of the Gonski Institute for Education at UNSW, and Professor of Practice in the School of Education.

Bonnet was born in Brussels and began her studies in art in 1924, but abandoned them in 1926 on the death of her parents. In 1930 she married Louis Bonnet, a dealer in silk, and her financial situation allowed her to return to art. In 1936 she resumed art studies under Jacques Maes and held her first exhibition in 1938. Originally influenced by realists such as James Ensor, she later adopted a geometric style of landscape painting, which became increasingly abstract, inviting comparisons with Paul Klee. Her work was selected to be on show at the Documenta II exhibition in Kassel alongside other Belgian abstract artists like Henri Michaux, Michel Seuphor and Marc Mendelsohn. She was represented by three artworks: Vestiges (1956), Vestiges Grises (1956) and H√©lianthes (1957). Exhibitions of her work have been frequent since her death, including a major series in 1963 at the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and at the Art museums of Li√®ge and Charleroi.

It is unique in the Channel Islands in having one of the very few surviving medieval chapels, the Fisherman's Chapel, sited directly next to the main church building.  Name  The church is dedicated to Saint Brelade. St Brelade was also known as St Branwalader, and has no connection with St Brendan.  History  Interior of St Brelade Church, 2013 Interior of Fisherman's Chapel Signature of Henry Thomas Bosdet, 1899 St Brelade, August 2009 The present church is mentioned in deeds of patronage. In AD 1035, Robert of Normandy confirmed the patronage of the church to the monastery of Montivilliers, which shows that the church was here before 1035. The Church was first built by Saint Branwalader. The chancel is the oldest part of the building. The original building extended some six feet into the nave. It was then only a small monastic chapel. Early in the 12th century it became a parish church, so additions were made; and in the 14th‚Äì15th centuries, the roof was raised some two and a half feet higher to a Gothic pitch. The roof of the Fishermen's Chapel was raised at the same time. The church of the 12th century was cruciform in structure, consisting of a chancel, a nave (built in two periods) and two transepts‚Äîthe latter forming the two arms. At a later date, perhaps a century later, the chancel aisle was built, and after that the nave aisle. The tower is of later date than the chancel. Once a rood screen adorned the church; the corbels on which it rested are still in place and a closed-up doorway, through which the rood was approached, is still in existence. The font disappeared during the Reformation and was found on the slopes near the church, hidden in bracken and gorse, in 1840 and restored to the church. An ornate wooden cover for the font was provided in memory of H. G. Shepard, long-time churchwarden. Above the font there was presumed to have existed, up to 1843, a smokers' gallery. However, this supposition, first mentioned by William George Tabb, Rector, has no documentary evidence. A processional cross dating from the 13th century is to be seen in the Lady Chapel; this was found buried in the church. The church by PJ Ouless Nearly all the stone used in the building of this church came from the beach; limpet shells can be noted on the stonework. The stained glass is the work of Henry Thomas Bosdet and replaced plain glass windows dating from the Reformation iconoclasm. The carved text on the pulpit is a rendering of Proverbs 25:11: \\"Telles que sont les pommes d'or emaill√©es d'argent, telle est la parole dit comme il faut [A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in filigree work].\\" Before the restoration of Balleine in the 1890s, the whole of the interior stone work was covered in plaster which was whitewashed; the plaster was removed to show the granite, and the whole re-pointed with cement. Balleine's restoration also saw Art Nouveau woodwork in the choir stalls and pulpit and modern paving in the chancel; it is made of five different types of Jersey granite and represents the waves breaking on the seashore.  Legend  The legend has the original site of the church a mile distant and moved by night by fairy folk from their sacred site to where it now stands, until the workmen got the message and left it where it is now.\\"Did fairies move St. Brelade's Church?\\", BBC - Jersey This legend helps to explain the unusual situation of the church and can be traced back to the early 19th century. There are also many English churches which share the same legend. ‚ÄòPouques and the Faiteaux: Channel Islands‚Äô, Young, S. and Houlbrook, C. (eds.)

List of Rectors William George Tabb William George Tabb was born on born on 6 October 1897 in Jersey Channel Islands, and baptised in the old Wooden Church at First Tower by the late Rev P. J. Mourant. He was confirmed by Bishop McArthur, Bishop of Southampton, in the original St Andrew's Church on the Esplanade, now a potato store. He was educated at the old Church of England National School under distinguished headmaster. Tom Adderson. Among his Sunday school teachers there were Mr and Mrs A. F. Hunt who for many years were in charge of the Church Bookshop in Waterloo Street. He wanted to be a priest from an early age and he was much influenced by Mr Mourant, who became Vicar of St Andrew's, and by the organist of the Wooden Church, Harry Jerram. The latter became organist of All Saints and Mr Tabb followed him there and became a member of the choir, a server, a Sunday school teacher and a Lay Reader. There he met his wife, Edith Osment and her family, all of whom were members of the choir. The outbreak of the First World War brought to an end the 'old days'. Reminiscing, Mr Tabb would say that they were good in parts. It is true that it was necessary to arrive at All Saints for Evensong at 6 p.m. in Order to get a seat in Mr Foster Ward's early days, but it is also true that the country churches in particular were largely without heat or light, and they were shut and locked from Sunday to Sunday. When Dean Falle arrived in 1906 and was joined by his curate, the Rev Herbert W Quarrie, they did much to stimulate the new life and energy into the Island Church. Mr Tabb joined the Royal Navy and he had to grapple with New Testament Greek in a hammock. He saw active service in the North Sea and on Atlantic Convoy Patrols and he was present at the surrender of the German Fleet to Admiral Beatty. After the war he became the last private pupil of the late Ed Le Feuvre, Rector of Grouville - a brilliant coach. He then trained for work overseas at the Brotherhood of St Paul, Essex, supported by good friends at All Saints. Other scholars who had trained there included. Mr Curtis, curate of St Andrew, Prebendary L. Snell, sometime curate of St Helier and Mr Hornby, former rector of St John and St Clement. From there he went to Canada for ordination in the Diocese of Ottawa, where he married Edith Osment. They was married in Ontario in 1924. The Church records state: 13327-24 William George TABB, 27, clerk in holy orders, Jersey - Channel Islands, Montague Rectory - Montague, s/o Charles Francis TABB & Ada SMITH, married Edith May OSMENT, 27, Jersey - Channel Islands, Rosedale - Montague, d/o Edwin Henry OSMENT & Erith Mary KELLAWAY, witn: John SALTER of Montague & Ada Zelie TABB of Rosedale, 18 November 1924 at Smith Falls. After caring for four churches in the Montague and Franktown areas, and doing intensive missionary work in an area three times the size of Jersey, he became rector of Bearbrook with three Churches to care for. Six years later he returned to England after a severe operation and took a curacy in Dartmouth. Dean Falle was always on the lookout for young Jerseymen to fill the Parish Cures and he offered Tabb Trinity. War and the Occupation brought great burdens. States work became more difficult. When Canon Cohu was sent to Germany he found himself on the Agriculture Committee in addition to the Public Health Committee under Edward Le Quesne. Apart from these two major committees he served at various times on the original Motor Traffic and Tourism Committees, Electricity, Markets and Westaway Cr√®che. Tabb's knowledge of French together with his intimate knowledge of Jersey manners and customs, stood him in good stead as Chapter Clerk. After 10 years there he moved south to St Brelade's ChurchSt Brelade where he became Rector in 1946. While at Trinity he was able to continue his duties as chaplain to Athelstan Riley but St Brelade's needed his undivided attention. It was a growing parish, had a huge visitor population and Mrs Tabb had a large Rectory to run. He also gave up his work as Chaplain to the General Hospital and H.M. Prison. When he took office in 1946 his flock numbered 2,700. in 1965, the population of the Parish was 9,000. He was Rector of Trinity Church in Jersey from 1934‚Äì1946, and Rector at St Brelade's Church from 1946 to 1971,\\"Rectors - St. Brelade\\", Socti√©t√©-Jersiaise where he died as incumbent at the age of 74. Another distinction which he shares with Canon Norman, Rector of St Saviour, is that of being the last Rector still in office who served in the States Chamber of the States of Jersey before Rectors were dismissed by the electorate.
