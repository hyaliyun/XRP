The company was founded in 2007 by Abigail Forsyth and her brother Jamie Forsyth after they grew concerned about the volume of single-use coffee cups that they were using in their own chain of Melbourne cafes, Bluebag. They set out to develop a product solution that worked both behind the espresso machine and for customers; not compromising speed of service or coffee quality, while ensuring a better experience for coffee on the go. For this reason, KeepCup is often described as the world's first barista-standard reusable coffee cup. In 2009, KeepCup's aim was to lift reuse rates to 30%. In 2017, this goal was achieved by many of their customers after the ABC TV production War on Waste highlighted the issue of the one billion non-recyclable coffee cups that are sent to Australian landfills every year. With the release of David Attenborough's Blue Planet II and the UK Parliament's Environmental Audit Select Committee recommendation in 2018 to ban disposable cups if they are not recyclable by 2023, public consciousness of the global waste crisis has significantly increased, inspiring KeepCup to campaign harder to remove disposable cups from the public landscape.  Corporate responsibility  As of 2019, KeepCup estimates that its users have diverted billions of non- recyclable, single-use cups from landfill. KeepCup donates 1% of its global sales revenue to the One Percent for the Planet campaign, citing its ‚Äúresponsibility [as a] corporate citizen to the environment, our employees and our communities.‚Äù KeepCup also have long-standing relationships with conservation organisations like Sea Shepherd. In 2018, KeepCup conducted a life-cycle assessment (LCA) of their products, which showed that KeepCups have a lower environment impact than single-use paper/polypropylene cups after 24 days of use (assuming one use per day). After 10 days, one use per day, all KeepCups have a lower impact than compostable cups. KeepCup have advocated for legislative action that would ban single-use packaging since 2009, and hope to see the world free of single-use packaging by 2023.

Some are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. Globe is located in the heart of Arizona's Tonto National Forest on U.S. Routes 60. Also, pictured is the historic Southern Pacific Railroad Steam Engine #1774 and the North and Broad Street Overpass. Brief history Old Dominian Copper Company smelter complexOld Dominian Copper Company smelter complex Among the first people known to inhabit the area where Globe is situated were the prehistoric Salado people, who established the Besh Ba Gowah Pueblo. No one knows what happened to the Salado and why they disappeared. The San Carlos Apache's and other Native American tribes settled the area that once belonged to the Salado's. The first Europeans to arrive in the area were the Spanish conquistadors. Captain Don Garcia de Cardenas and his party arrived in Arizona, which at the time was part of \\"New Mexico\\", in 1540. In 1582, Antonio de Espejo organized a silver prospecting expedition in the area. They did not have any luck in their venture. The area became part of Mexico when Mexico gained its independence from Spain. The United States fought against Mexico in what is known as the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. The war ended officially when the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo was signed and forced onto the remnant Mexican government. It specified its major consequence, the Mexican Cession of the northern territories of Alta California and Santa Fe de Nuevo M√©xico to the United States.Robarts, \\"Mexican War veterans\\" pp.1‚Äì24Visit the cursed Apache Death Cave, where the angry spirits want you dead Two of the men who organized their own gold prospecting parties were Corydon E. Cooley, a physician who once treated a sick Apache and Calvin Jackson, a saloon keeper. Cooley had served as a First Lieutenant in the Second New Mexico Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the American Civil War. On September 26, 1869, he joined forces with Jackson after being attacked by the Apaches several times. They did not find gold, however they did find silver.GLOBE ARIZONA HISTORYThe Salado: A Crossroads in Cultures, by Jet Middaugh; Anthro 7, Spring 1998Globe Information The prospecting parties which followed were constantly attacked by the Apaches in the Pinal Mountain area. Therefore, in 1871, the U. S. Army sent General George Crook in an expedition into the area to suppress the Apaches. The complex and bloody expedition became known as the Tonto campaigns. Crook was able to terminate the Apache resistance by 1873. New teams of prospectors began to stake their claims and they organized the Pinal Mining Company. In 1872, the United States Government established the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation. The miners asked the Secretary of the Interior, Francis Amasa Walker, to remove part of the region which would become the 'Globe Mining District'. Walker complied with the request and the Mining Act of 1872 was adopted. The act became the official law governing the district. The townsite of 'Globe City' was officially laid out in July 1876. Globe became the seat of Gila County, a new Arizona county, in February 1881. The price of silver had decreased by 1881, however by the same token the price of copper increased. The Old Dominian Copper Mining Company began to flourish. Copper mining is the most profitable venture in Globe. The Besh Ba Gowah ruins Besh-Ba-Gowah ruin About a mile southwest from Globe are the ruins of Besh-Ba-Gowah a Salado masonry pueblo. The Salado were a melting pot of cultures. As visitors and immigrants came through the Salado area, their practices, lifestyles and customs were adopted and adapted based on practicality, applicability and necessity to the Salado peoples. They were farmers who used mud and rocks to construct multistory dwellings, or pueblos in the siltstone hills.Besh Ba Gowah Archaeological Park and Museum The Besh- Ba-Gowah pueblo consisted of 200-rooms and overlooks Pinal Creek. The Salado occupied this site between AD 1225 and AD 1400. Besh-Ba-Gowah is considered one of the Salado culture \\"type sites\\". At least 150 burials were exhumed from the central plaza. Archaeologists have discovered that a social structure including elites with substantial material differences existed by studying the preparation of the deceased and the mortuary offerings buried with the dead. What became of the Salado people is a mystery. Archaeologists nor Historians know the reason or reasons that the Salado disappeared. The San Carlos Apache's and other Native American tribes later settled these lands. The site is operated by the city as Besh Ba Gowah Archaeological Park and Museum and was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on May 9, 1984, Ref. #84000648.

He is best known for creating top-charting apps as a teenager to provide for his family during the Great Recession, as well as his subsequent work at Facebook. Sayman published his first app to the App Store (iOS) when he was 13 years old. He later gained recognition from Mark Zuckerberg with his launch of 4 Snaps, a turn-based photo game, in his junior year of high school. Zuckerberg then hired Sayman, becoming Facebook's \\"teen-in-residence\\" at 18. His success with mobile application development grew in his teenage years, generating millions in revenue as a high school student. Sayman is currently a product manager at Google heading a social gaming startup within the company. Personal life Michael was born in Miami, Florida in 1996 to Bolivian father Miguel Sayman and Peruvian mother Maria Cristina G√°lvez Sayman. A large part of his life is defined by effects the Great Recession had on his childhood.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gHSVxWhnzk In 2010, when Sayman was 13 years old, his parents lost their jobs and were forced to foreclose their home. His mother considered having them move back to Peru. Sayman insisted they remain in the United States, and that he would pay for everything. Throughout his adolescence, he provided for his family via the money he earned publishing apps on the App Store. In an interview with People magazine regarding his teenage years, Sayman said there were moments in which he did not know how his family would be able to afford to buy food or pay the electricity bill. In 2014, as tech companies were flying Sayman out to tour their campuses and speak at conferences, he still owed tuition to Belen Jesuit Preparatory School, the private high school he attended. The school refused to give him his graduation certificate due to his inability to pay the outstanding balance he owed. In August 2018, Sayman publicly came out as gay in an interview with People en Espa√±ol. He said in the interview that he chose to come out because he believed that \\"this will be able to help other Latinos who go through the same situation.\\" Early Career: 2010‚Äì14 Sayman taught himself programming through tutorials he found via Google. =4 Snaps= In 2013, Sayman developed an app named ‚Äú4 Snaps‚Äù, a turn-based game which gave the user a choice of words, allowed them to take four pictures based on the word they picked, and then sent over to the opponent player to guess what the word was, based on the pictures taken. He released the app on August 8, 2013 and by the year after, the app had over one million downloads. 4 Snaps was received with mostly positive reviews. It peaked at #1 on the word games chart with a few million users. Facebook: 2014‚Äì17 Sayman joined Facebook when he was 18. Mentored by Mark Zuckerberg, Sayman played a role within the company as the social network‚Äôs \\"go-to teen\\". Over the course of 3 years at the company, he worked on developing products for the teenage demographic. He helped the social-media company understand how his generation uses technology, advising on experimental products for teens and helping executives understand trends. = Lifestage = At age 19, he launched Lifestage, a new standalone, video-centric social app for high school students while working at Facebook. The app was largely focused around the teenage demographic; anyone 22 or older is locked into only being able to see their own profile. When users signed up, with no need for a Facebook account, they would select their high school, and then see the video profiles from people at their school or ones nearby. Sayman released the app on August 19, 2016 for iOS devices in the United States and name is 4Snaps. The app was met with criticism regarding its privacy model and compared to Snapchat and Yik Yak. Less than 12 months later, Facebook pulled Lifestage from the app store and shut it down on August 4, 2017. Google: 2017‚Äìpresent On August 28, 2017, it was reported that he was leaving Facebook to work at Google on its Google 'Assistant' project. Before Google, Facebook was the only place Sayman had ever worked. Sayman is currently building a social-gaming startup within Google as part of the company's effort to create offspring companies from within the internet-search conglomerate.

Ellis (October 7, 1801 ‚Äì May 15, 1848) was an American newspaper publisher and politician in the U.S. state of Michigan. He represented Monroe County in the Michigan Senate in its first two sessions.  Biography  Edward Ellis was born on October 7, 1801, in Niles, New York. His father died two months before he was born, and he spent his youth on the family farm. After being put to work with a tanner, he found he disliked the work and went to Auburn, New York, to work in a printing office. Around the age of twenty, he worked for a time as a journeyman printer in Boston, and in 1825 he purchased equipment and moved west to Monroe, Michigan, where he began printing the Michigan Sentinel, the first newspaper in the Michigan Territory printed outside Detroit. Ellis gained prominence as a political writer and was an enthusiastic supporter of the Democratic Party until, in 1847, he broke with the party over its support for slavery and secessionism. He was a member of the Territorial Council and a delegate to the state constitutional convention of 1835. At the convention, a proposal was discussed to establish public libraries in every township of the state, but with no provision for funding them or purchasing books. Ellis pushed through the idea of setting aside criminal fines paid to the state to fund the libraries. In the first election for the newly-created state legislature in 1835, Ellis was elected to represent Monroe County in the Michigan Senate, and was re-elected for a second term. He sold his newspaper and moved to Detroit around 1842, where he began publishing the American Vineyard newspaper. He is credited with being the first newspaper publisher to advocate for the nomination of General Zachary Taylor for president, for which Taylor sent him a note of thanks. Ellis died suddenly in Detroit, on May 15, 1848, shortly before the start of the convention that nominated Taylor, perhaps because of internal injuries sustained while fighting a fire a couple days previously. Ellis had a reputation for integrity, and Michigan Governor William Woodbridge said, \\"I know of no man more purely honest than he.\\" = Family = Ellis married Leonora Mary Chapman, originally of Buffalo, New York, in Detroit on February 2, 1830. Prior to marriage, Chapman had been a teacher in Kentucky. They had six children: Mary Minerva, Amelia, E. Charles, John C. C., Elizabeth T., and Benjamin F. After Ellis's death in 1848, she lived in Chicago and Detroit, and died in Detroit, the home of her eldest child Mary Minerva, on August 26, 1870.

Following founders Henry Luce and Briton Hadden, Larsen was credited with being responsible for the company's growth and success. At the time of his death he was described as being \\"one of the most influential figures in the golden age of the company's empire.\\" Early life  Larsen was born in Boston, Massachusetts. His parents were Robert Larsen and Stella Belyea Larsen. He attended Boston Latin School, graduating in 1917, and entered Harvard College, graduating in 1921. While in college he served as treasurer and business manager of The Harvard Advocate, where he brought the newspaper back to profitability by increasing circulation.  Career  Larsen directed sales from the inception of Time magazine, and he is credited with recruiting the first 12,000 subscribers via a direct mail campaign in 1923. He continued to increase sales and circulation over the next 30 years. When Hadden died in 1929, Larsen was appointed as Times business manager by Luce. In 1939 Larsen succeeded Luce as president of Time, serving in this position until his retirement in April 1979.

Most infamously, the group massacred thousands of people in the Jeju Uprising. History The Northwest Youth League was established in November 30, 1946 by refugees escaping Soviet-occupied North Korea. Murals in the Jeju April 3 Peace Park Museum state that Northwest Youth League members fought Soviets and Korean communists because ‚Äúmembers of their family had been imprisoned, raped or murdered in North Korea, and that their property had been confiscated.‚Äù The league conducted vigilante justice against suspected communists with no legal basis. The league was supported by Syngman Rhee, the ardent, anti-communist, US-backed autocrat of South Korea. A socialist uprising in Jeju occurred from 1948 to 1949, followed by a violent suppression campaign. According to Bruce Cumings, the league was brutal towards the residents of Jeju Island, exercising more authority than the police. An estimated 30,000 people were slaughtered in Jeju (along with 300,000 nationwide) by paramilitary groups including the Northwest Youth League. Survivors give accounts of torture used against children and mass murder. This created deep resentment in Jeju residents. What began as an anti-communist movement, quickly became a force to crush anyone who opposed President Rhee and the Korea Democratic Party. A decade after the Korean War, Rhee was forced into exile after the April Revolution in South Korea. Anti-communism remained a powerful force, especially during the dictatorships of Park Chung-hee and Chun Doo-Hwan.

The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories. This list contains descriptions of Supplemental Roads and highways in the Rural Secondary System numbered 1 to 199 that do not have portions within the State Primary and State Secondary systems.

Education Casparus Bernardus (Cas) Oorthuys, born 1908 in Leiden, was the fourth child and first son of Dorothea Catherina Helena Christina de Stoppelaar (1875‚Äì1948) and Reverend Gerardus Oorthuys (1876‚Äì1959), who started his career as a pastor in Brakel. In 1909 the family moved to Amsterdam, where from 1921 Oorthuys attended the Amsterdam Lyceum for three years before enrolling in the technical school in the Timorplein in Amsterdam. From 1926 to 1930 he studied architecture at the School for Architecture, Decorative Arts and Art Crafts in Haarlem and, after the closure of this school in 1927, in the architecture department of the Haarlem MTS, during which time he joined the free-thinking Dutch Association of Abstinent Students, and first took up photography. Career In 1930 Oorthuys joined the municipality of Amsterdam as a structural engineer and was involved, among other things, in the design of the market halls on the Jan van Galenstraat. In 1932 he, with many others, lost his job as a result of the economic crisis. Unemployed, he came into contact with the Communist Party of Holland, which he joined. Oorthuys sought work as a graphic designer and photographer and with the painter Jo Voskuil started an advertising agency OV 20 (\\"Oorthuys-Vos 20\\") in 1932, which ceased business in 1935. Oorthuys was involved with and a member of various left-wing organisations in his field. In 1936 he became permanent photographer at De Arbeiderspers. He produced photography and graphics for communist and anti- fascist organisations; and in the tradition of \\"workers' photography\\" he documented poverty, police violence, the unemployed, homeless people and evictions for magazines, book illustrations and book covers and exhibitions.Ensel, R. (2003). Hollandse Heimat: nationalisme en de fotografie van het landschap in het Interbellum. Henkes, B. (2005). Personalities. Groniek (168). Resistance work during World War II During the war Oorthuys helped forge identity papers and photographed clandestinely for De Ondergedoken Camera (the Underground Camera; see below) to document the activities of the German occupiers, and also the awful Hongerwinter, the Dutch famine of 1944‚Äì45. During the postwar recovery he recorded the Nuremberg war crimes trials and the rebuilding of his homeland. On 5 August 1938 Oorthuys had divorced teacher Gezina Broerse (1910‚Äì1997), whom he had married on 31 August 1932 and with whom he had two children. He married scriptwriter Lydia Krienen on 3 April 1940, just before the war broke out in May.Marie Louise Schipper, 'Cas was geen lolbroek': interview with Lydia Oorthuys, Trouw, 1 December 1998 During the Occupation, Oorthuys became involved in the Personal Identification Centre established in 1942 and made passport photos for fake ID cards, while earning a bare living on an assignment from publishing company for a book about agriculture.Kuitert, L. (2010). Publishing House Contact and Its Support for Authors in the Second World War. Quaerendo, 40(3‚Äì4), 305‚Äì326. In May 1944, when he took ration cards to the architect J.J. van der Linden and others in hiding, he was arrested by the Germans and imprisoned in camp Amersfoort.Simpelaar, L. (2016). Capturing time. Trade journal Social Work , 17 (4), 23‚Äì23. Unexpectedly, he was released again in August, presumably at the interposition of Nico de Haas who, despite having been with Oorthuys one of the founders in 1936 of the ‚Äòphoto and film‚Äô group of the Association for the Defense of Cultural Law (Bond van Kunstenaars ter Verdediging van de Kulturele Rechten, BKVK) in preparation of the anti-fascist exhibition (DOOD),Langfeld, G.

De Haan formed around Dolle Dinsdag on the initiative of the German emigrant and the former soldier ; ‚ÄòUnderground‚Äô because the Nazi occupiers declared a complete ban on \\"photographing, filming, drawing, and displaying persons and things in any other way outside of domestic spaces\\" from 20 November 1944. The group photographed in any way they could, keeping cameras concealed and shooting 'from the hip'; consequently the quality of the imagery is distinguished by its haphazard nature; often with tilted, uncentered framing and other accidental effects. Their aim was initially to document the Allies‚Äô liberation which was longer in coming than hoped, and instead they recorded a severe winter of hunger and resistance in photos that have become the image of the German occupation, especially Cas Oorthuys‚Äô picture of a woman with a piece of bread in close-up. A variation was published on the cover of Amsterdam tijdens den hongerwinter (‚ÄòAmsterdam During the Winter of Hunger‚Äô) published by Contact / De Bezige Bij, in 1947, while the now more famous image from this series reached an audience of nine million through the 1955 exhibition and publication The Family of Man.Popular Photography, Nov 1996, Vol. 60, No. 11, page 11, ISSN 1542-0337  Post-war  After the war Oorthuys maintained the left-wing convictions that had prompted his joining the worker-photographer movement Vereeniging van Arbeiders- Fotografen in 1932,Jay, B.

History of Photography, 17(1), 1‚Äì9. and with his equally idealistic friends , Eva Besny√∂, and Emmy Andriesse, formed the Vereniging van Beoefenaars der Gebonden Kunsten, the GKf, on 1 September 1945. In keeping with his convictions, from January until March 1947, Oorthuys, accompanied by his writer the educationalist Albert de la Court, travelled through Java and Borneo in Indonesia commissioned by ABC- Press and the publishing house Contact. In July 1947 the resulting book Een staat in wording (A Nascent State), promoted a peaceful solution to the Indonesian struggle for independence, and reviews reveal its impact on changing attitudes to the colony as the Netherlands tried to re-exert its control,Beb Vuijk, 'De Republik Indonesia: een staat in wording', In De Vrije Katheder, 25 June 1947. but before the book appeared, the violent Indonesian National Revolution was in full swing. From 1945 to 1975 he produced numerous books and reports on the post-war reconstructionKempers, B. (1998). De sociale esthetiek van de wederopbouw.

Photography became a family concern; during the summer holidays from 1951 they traveled to make 28 photo pocketbook in a series for Contact-Photo books, starting with Bonjour Paris with a cover by Jan van Keulen, each on a different country, promoting tourism for a now more prosperous Dutch population. The compact books were designed around the square format of the Rolleiflex that Oorthuys favoured and several were marketed by foreign publishers in English, French and German language editions. During this period he also designed five postage stamps (1951) and two more in 1964. On each of the five stamps, a portrait of a child, among them his own daughter Hansje, is montaged against the background of a typical aspect of the Netherlands, showing the (housing) construction and industry.

The agency splits its inventory of state highway mileage into four categories: *The State Primary System includes Interstate Highways, Parkways, and other long-distance highways of statewide importance that connect the state's major cities, including much of the courses of Kentucky's U.S. Highways. *The State Secondary System includes highways of regional importance that connect the state's smaller urban centers, including those county seats not served by the state primary system. *The Rural Secondary System includes highways of local importance, such as farm-to-market roads and urban collectors. *Supplemental Roads are the set of highways not in the first three systems, including frontage roads, bypassed portions of other state highways, and rural roads that only serve their immediate area. The same-numbered highway can comprise sections of road under different categories.

He also participated in the only incident of shots being fired in the Toledo War between Michigan and Ohio.  Biography  OlmsteadHis first name is spelled Olmstead in , and Olmsted in , and on his headstone . Hough was born in 1797 in Columbia County, New York, the son of Revolutionary War veteran Zepheniah Hough. When he was four, the family moved to Schuyler, New York. From the age of fourteen to eighteen, he was an apprentice to a relative as a carpenter and millwright, a trade which he pursued until 1830. That year, he was elected to the New York Legislature and served one term. He moved to Michigan Territory in 1831 and settled on a farm on the road between Tecumseh and Saline. In April 1835, while Michigan and Ohio were at odds over a strip of land along their common border, Hough was part of a posse that went into Ohio to disrupt the work of a surveying party. Here he took part in the Battle of Phillips Corners, the only confrontation of the Toledo War that resulted in shots being fired, though nobody was injured.

History  Following the Paris Commune and disintegration of the French left in the early 1870s, anarchist pedagogue Paul Robin turned to education reform. While teaching French at the Woolwich Royal Military Academy, developed his ideas through the rest of the decade, just as France began a turn towards a free, compulsory, and secular education system. Robin became the supervisor of the Pr√©vost orphanage in Cempuis in December 1880. He received the offer through the old boy network: his friend James Guillaume asked head of primary education Ferdinand Buisson to find Robin a position. Buisson and another friend of Robin's, Aristide Rey, were guiding the Pr√©vost bequest, in which the Saint- Simonian Joseph Gabriel Pr√©vost established an orphanage in Cempuis in 1861 and set aside money for its continuance after his 1875 death. The Seine department briefly used the building for administration in 1880, as Robin returned to France to run the orphanage as a 14-year experiment. The orphanage grew from 58 to 180 children between 1880 and the 1890s, including boys and girls between the ages of eight and fourteen. He integrated his family with the orphanage, treating his charges as if they were his children and vice versa. This lost him the affection of his children but endeared him to his orphans. His disciple and biographer, Gabriel Giroud, was one such orphan. Robin sought to provide an \\"integrated education\\" that combined intellectual and manual learning, both arts and sciences. Influenced by Charles Fourier's concept of la papillonne, he wanted students to have the freedom of moving between physical, intellectual, and moral tasks, so as to foster creativity. He also wanted early education to be spontaneous, as if knowledge was transmitted by chance. Much of what is known about the Pr√©vost orphanage's pedagogy comes from Giroud and the bulletin compiled by the students.

According to Greek mythology, Asea is said to be named for Aseatas, son of the Spartan king, Lycaon. During the Greco-Persian Wars, inhabitants of Asea fought in the historic Battle of Plataea (479 BCE). Asea took part in the foundation of Megalopolis, to which city most of its inhabitants removed in 371 BCE;, where for ·º∏Œ±œÉŒ±ŒØŒ± we ought to read ·ºàœÉŒ±ŒØŒ± or ·ºàœÉŒ≠Œ± but Asea continued to exist as an independent state, since the Aseatae are mentioned, along with the Megalopolitae, Tegeatae, and Pallantieis, as joining Epaminondas before the Battle of Mantineia in 362 BCE. At a later time, however, Asea belonged to Megalopolis, as we see from the descriptions of Strabo and Pausanias. The city was in ruins in the time of Pausanias (2nd century), who mentions its acropolis. In its territory, and at the distance of 5 stadia from the city, on the road to Pallantium, were the sources of the Alpheius, and near them those of the Eurotas. The two rivers united their streams, and, after flowing in one channel for 20 stadia, disappeared beneath the earth; the Alpheius rising again at Pagae, and the Eurotas at Belemina in Laconia. North of Asea, on the road to Pallantium, and on the summit of Mount Boreium, was a temple of Athena Soteira and Poseidon, said to have been founded by Odysseus on his return from Troy., 8.44.3, 8.54.2. City coins have been found dated 196 BCE. Archaeology Ancient Asea occupied a hilltop site and is believed to have been settled by the late Early Helladic period. Evidence suggests that this was destroyed by fire and that the site was reoccupied during the Middle Helladic (MH). Remains consist of much Black Minyan pottery of various types and a number of graves. The lack of evidence later than the late MH period could result from abandonment of the site at that time or just from natural erosion. It may have been established as early as 6000 BC. Its treasures are kept in archaeological museums in Tripoli, Nafplio, and Athens. The ruins of the ancient city still stand, most notably Doric temples dedicated to Poseidon and Athena, and they indicate that Asea was once a prosperous city. Its site is located near the modern Asea, which was renamed to reflect association with the ancient town.

Lack of functional dysferlin can cause a group of muscular dystrophies knows as dysferlinopathies. Myoferlin is highly expressed in several types of cancer, and mutations in otoferlin can cause deafness. Ferlins are an ancient protein family involved in vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking. Ferlins are distinguished by their multiple tandem C2 domains, and sometimes a FerA and a DysF domain. Mutations in ferlins can cause human diseases such as muscular dystrophy and deafness. Abnormalities in expression of myoferlin, a human ferlin protein, is also directly associated with higher mortality rate and tumor recurrence in several types of cancer, including pancreatic, colorectal, breast, cervical, stomach, ovarian, cervical, thyroid, endometrial, and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. In other animals, ferlin mutations can cause infertility. Ferlins are type II transmembrane proteins (N-terminus on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane) and contain five to seven C2 domains linked in tandem and have a single-pass transmembrane domain located at the C-terminus. The C2 domains are denoted in order from amino-terminus to carboxyl-terminus as C2A to C2G. C2 domains are essentially calcium and phospholipid binding domains, evolved for cell membrane interactions. In fact, many proteins involved in signal transduction, membrane trafficking, and membrane fusion employ C2 domains to target the cell membrane. However, ferlins are unique for containing more C2 domains than any other proteins (between five and seven). FerA and DysF are two intermediate domains that are unique to ferlins. There is less known about FerA and DysF domains, however, mutations of these domains in dysferlin can also lead to muscular dystrophy. As in other mammals, there are six ferlin genes in humans (Fer1L1-Fer1L6). Among them, Fer1L1-Fer1L3 have known disease relevance. Therefore, Fer1L1-Fer1L3 are better characterized compare to Fer1L4-Fer1L6 with unknown function and tissue localization. Fer1L1-Fer1L3 proteins each has a unique name and they correspond to dysferlin, myoferlin, and otoferlin accordingly.  Discovery  The first member of ferlin protein family, fer-1, was discovered in nematode Caenorhabditis elegance. Fer-1 gene was first described in 1997 by Achanzar and Ward. Fer-1 is required for reproduction in C. elegance and was therefore named Fer-1 because of its involvement in fertility. The name is an abbreviation for ‚Äúfertilization factor 1‚Äù. The nomenclature in other ferlins in humans is Fer1Lx, where x is a number from 1-6, each identifying one of the six Fer1-like ferlins in humans.  Evolution  Ferlins are ancient proteins and they have been identified in protists and metazoans, and are known to exist in a range of organisms from unicellular eukaryotes to humans, suggesting primordial functions for ferlins. More specifically, DysF domain and the last two C-terminal C2 domains followed by the C-terminal transmembrane domain (C2E-C2F-TM, containing approximately 489 amino acids) show a high degree of conservation. All ferlins contain several C2 domains. However, C2A may be missing in some ferlins. More specifically, from six human ferlins, three of them do not contain C2A domains. Another highly conserved domain is the N-terminal C2-FerI-C2 sequence. FerI is a motif detected by Pfam, however, the function of this conserved motif is currently unknown. Ferlins have been evolved into two groups, DysF-containing and non-DysF ferlins. Most invertebrates possess two ferlin proteins, one from each class. Most vertebrate however, have six ferlin genes, three of which DysF containing and the other three non-DysF ferlins, indicating that vertebrate ferlins are evolved and originated from the two ferlins in early metazoans. Both subgroups have been identified in early metazoans, suggesting the fundamental role associated to these proteins.  Structure  Ferlins are large proteins and currently the full length structure of ferlins is unknown. In order to understand their structural aspects, ferlin domains have been studied individually: C2A domains are calcium and lipid binding domains made from 8 Œ≤-strands forming 2 sheets. The loops connecting the sheets form the calcium binding site. The Œ≤-sheet structure is conserved among C2 domains, however, the loops may have different features. Depending on the amino acids located at the calcium binding site and the loops, C2 domains can have different specificities for calcium and lipid binding, suggesting that they are evolved to function in different environments. The DysF domain exists as an internal duplication where an inner DysF domain is surrounded by an outer DysF domain. Such structure is a result of gene duplication and both inner and outer DysF domains have adopted the same fold. The structure of DysF is mainly consist of two antiparallel long Œ≤-strands. To date, the crystallographic structure of human dysferlin and solution NMR structure of myoferlin DysF have been obtained by Altin Sula et al. and PryankPatel et al. accordingly. Myoferlin and dysferlin DysF domains show 61% sequence identity. A unique feature of DysF domains in both dysferlin and myoferlin is that these domains are held together by arginine/aromatic sidechain (specially tryptophan) stacking. FerA had been predicted using Pfam and SMART and remained uncharacterized both structurally and functionally until recently. It had been determined by secondary structure prediction however, that FerA domain contains several helices. Recently, a model of FerA structure obtained by homology models have been confirmed by fitting the calculated model into the FerA structure obtained by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) experiments. These structural models provided evidence that FerA contains four helices, which fold to form a four-helix bundle.  Function  alt= Topologies of ferlin domains. Labels A-F indicate: A: ferlin topology containing all seven C2 domains; B: (-)C2DE; C: (-)C2A; D: (-)C2A, (-)C2DE; E: (-)C2A, (-)C2DE, (-)FerB; F: (-)C2A, (-)C2 D, (-)C2E, (-)C2DE,(-)C2F. Different C2 domains are also labeled as C2A-C2F. In other studies, C2DE, C2E, and C2F are denoted as C2E, C2F, and C2G. In this figure, C2, DysF, and transmembrane are an amalgamation of SMART results, and FerA, FerB and FerI are an amalgamation of PFAM results. Ferlins play roles in vesicle fusion and membrane trafficking. Different ferlins are found in various organs and they play specific roles. Fer-1 is a member of ferlin protein family, and a fertilization factor involved in fusion of vesicles called membraneous organelles with the sperm plasma membrane during spermatogenesis in C. elegans. In C. elegance spermatids are immobile and during sperm maturation mobility is gained after fusion of membraneous organelles with the plasma membrane. At this point, spermatids extend their pseudopod and become mobile. This process is calcium-dependent and a normal progression of this step requires ferlin's involvement. Dysferlin is highly expressed in skeletal muscles, but is also found in heart, placenta, liver, lung, kidney and pancreas. Dysferlin is essential for membrane repair mechanism in muscle cells. Dysferlin in sea stars is 46.9% identical to human dysferlin, and is critical for normal endocytosis during oogenesis and embryogenesis. In humans, dysferlin's primary function is believed to be involvement in muscle membrane repair mechanism. Skeletal muscles experience micro-damages during exercising and daily activities. When muscles are damaged, dysferlin containing vesicles accumulate at the site of injury, and by fusing together and to the membrane, they patch the leakage. In dysferlin- null muscles, these vesicles still accumulate at the damage site, but they cannot fuse and therefore, are unable to repair the damaged muscle cells. Otoferlin is another ferlin member in humans and it plays a role in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the auditory inner hair cell ribbon synapse. In adult fruit flies, a ferlin member called misfire is expressed in testis and ovaries. Mutations in misfire and Fer-1, ferlins in flies and C. elegance, cause male sterility because of defects in fertilization. Function of ferlin proteins involves employing multiple domains. C2A domains are specialized in lipid binding. The phospholipid interaction is often calcium dependent as C2 domains have evolved to respond to increase in calcium concentration. A sudden increase in calcium concentration is observed in synaptic vesicles or inside muscle cells after membrane damage. Therefore, C2 domains are often referred to as the calcium sensor of C2 domain-containing proteins. The function and mechanism of function of C2 domains is well-characterized, although it may vary between different C2 domains. In general, C2 domains interact with the membrane via electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions. It has been proposed that FerA may be involved in membrane interaction as well. It can in fact interact with neutral or negatively charged phospholipids and the interaction is enhanced in the presence of calcium ions. The molecular mechanism by which FerA interacts with the membrane or calcium ions however, is currently unknown.  Disease association  The most important disease relevance of ferlins in humans is related to mutations in dysferlin. In humans, disease causing mutations in dysferlin have been identified in all C2 domains, FerA domain, DysF domain, and even linker segments. Lack of functional dysferlin causes a group of muscular dystrophies called dysferlinopathies. Dysferlinopathies include limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2B, Miyoshi myopathy (MM) and distal myopathy of the anterior tibialis. C2A mutations which affect its calcium binding or lipid binding can often cause muscular dystrophy. Interestingly, dysferlin C2B does not bind calcium, however, mutations in this domain can still cause muscular dystrophy. Some mutations in C2A can disrupt dysferlin interaction with other important proteins involved in membrane repair process (such as MG53) which can also lead to muscular dystrophy. Many mutations in dysferlin occur in DysF domain which often disrupt Arginine/Tryptophan stacks of this domain. This leads to a less stable and possibly unfolded protein which may result in the degradation of the entire dysferlin. Several FerA mutations have been also identified. These mutations have been shown to lower the stability of FerA domains which may explain the pathogenicity of these mutations. Otoferlin has been shown to interact with SNAREs and play a role in a calcium-dependent exocytosis in the hair cells in the inner ear. Mutations in otoferlin can cause mild to profound non-syndromic recessive hearing loss in humans. Currently, there is no association between myoferlin mutations and human diseases. However, it has been shown experimentally that loss of myoferlin results in reduced myoblast fusion and muscle size. There is also a correlation between myoferlin overexpression and several types of cancers such as lung cancer and breast cancer. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) myoferlin increases cell proliferation and promotes tumorigenesis and its expression negatively correlates with tumor size. Breast cancer patients with overexpressed myoferlin have a lower survival rate. Although it is not yet clear how myoferlin contributes in cancer pathology in a molecular level, there are scientific evidences that myoferlin overexpression is associated with tumor growth and metastasis. In fact, myoferlin depletion in cancer cell lines can result in reduced tumor size and metastasis rate.

Its nearest higher peak is Mount Huber, to the east. The standard climbing route follows the southeast glacier and ridge starting from Elizabeth Parker hut. Pronunciation sounds like the two words \\"ode array\\" (/≈çd/ /…ôÀàrƒÅ/). History The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1887 by James J. McArthur, and he named it Odaray which is the expression for \\"many waterfalls\\" in the Stoney language. Other reports have it being named in 1894 by Samuel Evans Stokes Allen for the Stoney Indian word for \\"cone\\". However, it is possible that McArthur only ascended the lesser secondary summit cone (2965 m) now known as Little Odaray which is southeast of the true summit. The mountain's current name became official in 1952 when the Geographical Names Board of Canada rescinded the name Mount Odaray. Geology Odaray Mountain is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Odaray Mountain is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. Precipitation runoff from Odaray Mountain drains into tributaries of the Kicking Horse River which is a tributary of the Columbia River.

Her life story was later recorded in a biography written by a distant cousin, Australian author Suzanne Falkiner.  Biography  Joan Falkiner was born in Melbourne, Australia in 1915. The Falkiners were stud merino sheep breeders in country Victoria and New South Wales, and by the early 20th-century had established themselves as wealthy members of Melbourne society. Joan's father was a director of the family company, and she was a childhood friend of Jo Gullett. Taley Mohammed Khan; upright=0.8 Joan Falkiner met Taley Muhammed Khan in the Black Forest in Germany in 1937, where he was seeking treatment for a painful polo injury. Taley was the Nawab of the Palanpur State, a protectorate of the British Empire under the administration of the British Raj. He had ascended to the throne of Nawab in 1918, and had since embarked on a campaign of construction and reform. When he and Joan met, she was 19 and he was 55. The two subsequently became engaged to be married, though the relationship was objected to by Joan's family. In Suzanne Falkiner's biography Joan in India, Joan's niece posits that colonial politics and racial tensions played a role in the Falkiner family's objections to the proposed marriage. Joan's family were also concerned that Taley, as a Muslim, was already married to an Indian woman (who had since become an invalid), and had a 20-year-old son. Furthermore, the Falkiners feared that if Joan married into an Indian noble family, she might be placed in purdah. In 1939 Joan eloped, and traveled to India to marry Taley. The departure of the 21 year old heiress caused a stir and much speculation in Melbourne high society. She converted to Islam and was married in an Islamic ceremony. Though recognised by as such by Taley, she was denied the title of Begum by the British Raj, which disapproved of marriages between Anglo women and Indian rulers; Joan was also not invited by the British to appear beside her husband during public functions. Regardless of these restrictions, Joan was otherwise accorded her rights as Taley's wife. In 1947, the Indian Independence movement successfully resulted in India becoming independent from the shrinking British Empire; this development meant the end British Raj. On the night of 14 August 1947 the last Viceroy of India, Lord Louis Mountbatten, decided to confer a title of nobility on Joan, allowing her to claim the title of 'Her Highness' in British eyes. However, Indian independence also led to the dissolution of the Palanpur State. Joan and Taley lived together until the latter died of cancer in 1957. Joan settled in Southern France after her husband's death. She died in 2003.

Though released on November 2, 2018 through Sacred Bones Records, Thought Gang was originally recorded in the early 1990s. The album was preceded by a Lynch-directed music video for \\"A Real Indication\\" on November 1, 2018. The video was created in 1992 in the 8mm video format. Background In 1991, Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch decided to form the jazz project Thought Gang. The short-lived effort lasted through 1993 and led to two tracks included on the soundtrack for Lynch's Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me (1992) and a few scattered pieces on other Lynch films, like 2001's Mulholland Drive and 2006's Inland Empire. On September 18, 2018, it was announced that a previously unreleased album under the title Thought Gang would be released on November 2 of that year. Lynch described Thought Gang as \\"a grand experiment\\", and Kory Grow of Rolling Stone called the music experimental free jazz with spoken word elements. Critical reception Thought Gang was met with mostly positive reception. The album received an average score of 70/100 from 5 reviews on Metacritic, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". AllMusic's Bekki Bemrose acknowledged the difficulty and eccentricity of the music but recommended it to hardcore fans of Lynch and Badalamenti. She went on to write that the album's greatest asset is its \\"sound of two old friends having a great deal of mischievous fun\\". Andy Beta of Pitchfork expressed mixed feelings on the strangeness of the music (especially Badalamenti's spoken word vocals) and wrote, \\"As frightful and bewildering as a Dion McGregor nightmare, Thought Gang reveals Lynch and Badalamenti‚Äôs shared drive to disrupt any through line or logical outcome, the sounds and words as baffling as dream logic\\". Kory Grow of Rolling Stone described the album as \\"unpredictable and uneven but also strangely compelling\\", echoing the sentiment of other reviewers that the music is at once magnetic and repulsive. Writing for Exclaim!, Jenna McClelland described the album as \\"for lovers of non-expositional storytelling, crude mystery, lipstick-red esoteric jazz, and noise\\".

He served in the Ottoman parliament from 1911 until April 1912. Early life Shukri was born in Damascus in 1868 and belonged to the wealthy, landowning al-Asali family.Roded 1983, p. 91. The family was originally from a village near Damascus in the Ghouta and still held awqaf (charitable trusts) there into the 20th century.Commins 1990, p. 93. In Shukri‚Äôs time, the family was in the al-Midan quarter of Damascus.Khoury 1983, pp. 60‚Äì61. Shukri‚Äôs father Ali Agha (died 1930) and grandfather Muhammad Agha (died 1873) were both landowners who served on the provincial council of Syria Vilayet (Ottoman province of Syria) and in the municipal council of Damascus.Roded 1983, pp. 91‚Äì92. Shukri studied at the Syrian Protestant College in Beirut. In 1896, he enrolled into the Ottoman Law Academy in Istanbul, the Ottoman capital.Moubayed 2006, p. 365.Roded 1983, p. 92. He graduated in 1902 and began his service in the provincial bureaucracy of Syria. Political career=Qaimaqam of Nazareth= Al-Asali‚Äôs career in government started with his appointment as the qaimaqam (district governor) of Nazareth in 1910. During his term, he attempted but failed to prevent the sale of the village lands of al-Fula and Afula, amounting to 2,500 acres, by Elias Sursuq to a Zionist activist.Suleiman 1984, p. 9. The large land sale raised ire not only in Palestine, but also in Damascus and Beirut, because of the high quality of the land and the Saladin-era fortress located within it. =Member of Parliament= Al-Asali resigned as qaimaqam to contest a seat in the Ottoman Parliament during a by-election precipitated by the death of Damascene parliamentarian Muhammad Ajlani.Khoury 1983, p. 61. The constitution and parliament had been suspended by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1877 but was reinstated by the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) which seized power in 1908; this permitted political activists such as al-Asali an opportunity to express their grievances and nationalist views. As a deputy in parliament al- Asali was ‚Äúa forceful advocate of Arab rights and came to lead the Syrian ‚Äòliberal opposition‚Äô in Parliament‚Äù, according to historian Philip S. Khoury.Khoury 1983, pp. 61‚Äì62. He condemned the alleged reticence of the CUP to appoint Arabs to high-ranking administrative posts;Khoury 1983, p. 62. no government ministers or provincial governors were Arabs and one percent of high-ranking bureaucratic posts were filled by Arabs.Fishman 2011, p. 117. He raised this matter backed by the aforementioned statistics in a parliamentary debate on 5 April 1911 and was lauded for it by activists in Damascus and Beirut and the Syrian community in Cairo.Seikaly 1991, p. 87. The Syrian intellectual Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar stated that al-Asali had done away with the image of meek Arab parliamentarians who simply stood by state policies without a voice of their own. The speech had no practical effect in changing policy. However, it was significant because it meant that Arab grievances could no longer be simply overlooked by the government. In contrast, the Turkish press condemned al-Asali for ‚Äúperfidy‚Äù and ‚Äúhypocrisy‚Äù, to which al- Asali responded by asserting his loyalty to the Ottoman state and sultan while reaffirming his position that Arabs were being underrepresented. Al-Asali also used his platform to criticize the CUP‚Äôs perceived weakness in confronting Zionist expansion in Palestine. According to historian Louis Fishman, on the latter subject, al-Asali ‚Äúwas in some senses the most effective speaker, focusing concretely on how Zionists were able to achieve dominance‚Äù.Fishman 2011, p. 116. Al-Asali asserted that Jews moving to Palestine were adopting Ottoman citizenship whilst maintaining the citizenship of their countries of origin which proved useful in case of legal troubles. Moreover, he stressed that the growing Jewish community in Palestine was totally autonomous of the Ottoman state, possessed a growing arsenal of firearms and were in the process of slowly gaining control of rural villages, particularly in the subdistricts of Safad, Tiberias, Jaffa and Jerusalem. In August and December 1911, al-Asali renewed his criticism of the CUP, accusing it of wearing the foundations of the empire through its autocratic governance and dismissiveness towards non- Turks.Seikaly 1991, p. 88. He further accused the CUP of brutality in its suppression of popular disturbances in the Hauran and al-Karak and for failing to prevent the Italian invasion of Libya. He later called for some of its leaders and the pro-CUP ex-prime minister Hakki Pasha to face trial for allegedly neglecting their duties to protect Tripolitania province.Seikaly 1991, p. 89. Al-Asali‚Äôs parliamentary activism effectively galvanized Syrian- Arab opposition to the CUP. Parliament was dissolved in early 1912. He subsequently lost in the parliamentary elections of April 1912. Al-Asali's defeat was attributed to his disloyalty to the CUP, which was accused of vote rigging. =Later political activism= In March 1913, al-Asali turned down an offer to serve as mutesarrif (district governor) of Latakia by Hazim Bey, the governor of Beirut Vilayet. According to historian Sami Moubayed, this was an attempt by the CUP to persuade al-Asali to tone down his criticism of the CUP‚Äôs policies. Al-Asali stated that he sought reform not a post given to him by a government that opposed such reform.Seikaly 1991, pp. 88‚Äì89. Al-Asali had become an early member of the secretive Arab Renaissance Society, founded prior to the CUP coup. Following the coup, it evolved into an open forum for political and cultural expression.Khoury 1983, p. 64. Following his defeat, al-Asali became the editor of the ardently Arabist al-Qabas newspaper which first appeared in 1912 and called for greater autonomy for the Arabic-speaking provinces of the empire. Though al-Asali supported the CUP‚Äôs secular and modernist reforms of Ottoman society, he opposed their vision of a Turkish- centric culture to be enforced upon the whole empire.Gingersas 2016, p. 41. Instead, al-Asali advocated that the citizens of the non-Turkish provinces, such as Syria, reserved the right to culturally express themselves on their own terms and in their native language. Death Though al-Asali had attempted to cooperate with the CUP to assist Syria‚Äôs inhabitants amid their struggles with food insecurity and famine during World War I, he was nonetheless arrested on allegations of cooperating with agents of the Triple Entente, enemies of the empire.Gingeras 2016, p. 212. The governor of Syria at the time, Jamal Pasha, stated his wish that al-Asali and other notables arrested ‚Äúwould one day repent‚Äù, he allowed the Damascus military tribunal to continue their proceeding despite the absence of any evidence. The tribunal condemned al-Asali to death ‚Äúfor establishing a connection to the French consulate‚Äù and joining Arabist organizations prior to World War I. The powerful Ottoman general Enver Pasha and the Druze notable Shakib Arslan requested that Jamal Pasha pardon al-Asali, but to no avail. Al-Asali was hanged on May 6, 1916 alongside a number of other Syrian nationalist leaders in Damascus and Beirut. His nephew, Sabri al-Asali, later became a three-time prime minister of a post-independent Syria during the 1950s.

Life Townsend was born in Whitechapel, London in 1757, son of Benjamin Townsend, a pewterer, and his wife Margaret. He was educated at Christ's Hospital from 1766 until 1771, when he began a seven-year apprenticeship to his father. From 1774 he was drawn to preaching; in June 1781 he was ordained pastor of the Independent Church at Kingston upon Thames. In the same month he married Cordelia Cahusac, and they later had children. He found that William Huntington, who resided in Kingston, was influencing his congregation by his antinomian views, so he resigned his charge, and in October 1784 became minister of the Independent Church in Bermondsey, London. Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb, built in 1807. Coloured etching, 1813. In 1792, with the assistance of Henry Cox Mason, rector of Bermondsey, Henry Thornton and others, he founded the Asylum for the Deaf and Dumb in the parish of Bermondsey. It rapidly grew in public esteem. On 11 July 1807 the first stone of a purpose-built school in Old Kent Road was laid by the Duke of Gloucester. The first headteacher was Joseph Watson, who had been educated at Thomas Braidwood's school for the deaf. By 1815 the institution was greatly oversubscribed.

Hazza was the Ruler's Representative in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi.  Early years  Hazza was born in the period 1905-1907 in the Western Abu Dhabi village of Mujib, the second son of Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan and Sheikha Salama bint Butti, an influential lady from the tribe of Al-Qubaisi. Sheikh Sultan would go on to rule Abu Dhabi from 1922-1926. Shakhbut was his elder brother. Sheikh Salama, alarmed by the family history of fratricide, made all four of her sons swear not to harm each other. He studied under the Imam of the Seer Mosque, Aqail Saber Haidar Al Khoury. In July 1926, aged 19, he traveled with his mother and brothers from Abu Dhabi to Al Ain when his father sent them away suspecting trouble. The subsequent coup saw Sheikh Sultan bin Zayed killed and the accession of Sheikh Saqr bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Hazza's uncle. Hazza's younger brother Khalid was caught up in the violence in Abu Dhabi, and wounded before seeking refuge with the Qubaisat, his mother's family. Hazza and Shakhbut subsequently fled Al Ain and travelled in search of refuge to Sharjah, al-Hasa, Wakra, Delma, Qatar and then Riyadh. They returned to Abu Dhabi on the death of Sheikh Saqr in 1928.  Ruler's Representative  Abu Dhabi's first oil rig, AD-1. Although Sheikh Hazza attended the first 'spudding in' of a rig in Abu Dhabi, oil was not found in commercial quantities until after his death in 1958. Sheikh Shakhbut became the next Ruler of Abu Dhabi and appointed Hazza as his wali or Representative to the Western Region. Well-versed in tribal affairs and commanding widespread respect, Hazza was keen on falconry, a love for the sport that was shared by his younger brother, Zayed, who was the Ruler's Representative in the Eastern Region. Hazza led a mission to Saudi Arabia in 1922, representing his brother and earning a rebuke from the British as they reserved to themselves all foreign relations of the Trucial States, the result of the 'Exclusive Agreement' of 1892. He was present at the first 'spudding in' of Abu Dhabi's first exploratory drilling at Ras Al Sadr, in February 1950. This well was eventually, however, found to be dry (the deepest ever drilled in the area at 13,000 feet) and it wasn't until October 1960 that oil was found in commercial quantities in Abu Dhabi. Of the many tribal disputes, Hazza was to rule over, one was to have British explorer Wilfred Thesiger's Bedouin guide freed from Sharjah prison - Salim Bin Ghabaishah, a Rashidi, went raiding with the Awamir in 1950 and was captured by the Bani Qitab. Hazza's intervention was enough to secure Ghabaishah's release.  Buraimi dispute  Hazza lived in the Liwa Oasis, in the village of Mariyah and his authority spanned Liwa, the Batin, Batinah, Qufa, Saruq, Ramlat Al Hamra and Bainunah. He was responsible for maintaining the peace between the (often fractious) Bedouin tribes, collecting Zakat and undertaking the application of law and maintaining the stability and security of the region. Not least of his challenges were continued encroachments on the territory under his control by the Saudi Arabian oil company, ARAMCO, and in 1949, Hazza and the British agent, P. D. Stobart, undertook a fact-finding tour of the border areas to the south of Abu Dhabi, which led to a protest being made to Saudi Arabia. These incidents formed part of a pattern of Saudi incursions which was eventually to lead to the occupation of Buraimi by an armed Saudi force, an action which sparked the Buraimi Dispute of 1952-1954. Together with Zayed, Hazza attended the Geneva Court in September 1955 on behalf of his brother, during attempts to arbitrate the Buraimi Dispute. However, the arbitration failed when the British and Belgian representatives walked out, and the British resolved to unilaterally abrogate the Standstill Agreement and themselves invade Buraimi.  Death  Hazza's health was declining at the time of the Buraimi Dispute, and despite undergoing treatment in the United States and India, he passed away on 20 January 1958.  Personal life  He was a close friend of Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, the Ruler of the Dubai. He was married twice, both times to a cousin from the lineage of Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, but had no children. His first wife was Sheikha Maryam bint Said bin Zayed bin Khalifa. After her death, he married Sheikha Maryam bint Hamdan bin Zayed bin Khalifa.

It was situated west of Tegea, in a small plain called the Pallantic plain (Œ†Œ±ŒªŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒπŒ∫œåŒΩ œÄŒ≠Œ¥ŒπŒøŒΩ) which was separated from the territory of Tegea by a choma (œá·ø∂ŒºŒ±) or dyke. It was from this town that Evander of Pallene was said to have led colonists to the banks of the Tiber, and from it the Palatino or Palatine Hill in Rome was reputed to have derived its name.Hes. ap. Justin, 43.1. Pallantium took part in the foundation of Megalopolis, 371 BCE; but it continued to exist as an independent state, since we find the Pallantieis mentioned along with the Tegeatae, Megalopolitae and Aseatae, as joining Epaminondas before the Battle of Mantineia in 362 BCE. Pallantium subsequently sank into a mere village, but was restored and enlarged by the emperor Antoninus Pius, who conferred upon it freedom from taxation and other privileges, on account of its reputed connection with Rome. The town was visited by Pausanias, who found here a shrine containing statues of Pallas and Evander, a temple of Core (Persephone), a statue of Polybius; and on the hill above the town, which was anciently used as an acropolis, a temple of the pure (Œ∫Œ±Œ∏Œ±œÅŒøŒØ) gods., 8.44.5-6. Its site is located near the modern Palantio (formerly Berbati), which was renamed to reflect association with the ancient town. In 1939‚Äì1940, in fact, the archaeological site was discovered and excavated by the Italian Archaeological School of Athens (Guido Libertini, but especially Alfonso De Franciscis) and again in 1984-1986 (including two years for studying all the finds from both excavations) under a collaboration of the Norwegian Institut at Athens with the Italian School (Erik √òstby and Mario Iozzo).

The row was built in 1881. It is also known as Sergeant Majors Row (terrace) and Major's. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  This property is part of the land originally granted to Robert Campbell senior by Crown grant under the hand of Sir Richard Bourke, formerly Governor of the Colony in 1834. Robert Campbell's will gave to each of his sons and daughters one sixth of his property. In 1848, a Deed of Partition was registered giving Arthur Jeffreys (Campbell's son-in-law) and George Campbell the task of selling parcels of property. In 1851, Jeffreys conveyed the allotments 1, 2, and 3 of Campbell's subdivision to Thomas Fisher. Two years later Fisher, without investing capital into the property, conveyed the site to Alfred Mitchell who in 1855 sold the land to Francis Mitchell. In 1878 the property still remained undeveloped. On 25 September 1878, Mitchell transferred the land to Edward Stanley Ebsworth. Ebsworth commenced erection of five houses to this site in and by December 1881 the Sydney Council noted that five houses were built upon the property. In 1881, the two story, seven roomed dwellings were described as being constructed of brick walls with roofs clad in \\"iron\\". In 1882, tenants were Joseph O'Connor, Frank Cook and Mary Ann Kendall. The remaining houses were empty. Ebsworth mortgaged the property to the Australian Mutual Provident Society in 1884. In September 1888 the mortgage was discharged and Ebsworth conveyed the dwellings to the Sydney Real Estate Bank Limited (SREB). In April the following year the SREB mortgaged the five dwellings to Charles Edward Pitcher and Edward Lewin Samuel. In 1892, Pitcher and Samuel transferred the mortgage to the Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd. In December 1900 the Observatory Hill Resumption Act was gazetted and the Perpetual Trustee Company Ltd. released the property to the King and the Minister for Public Works in May 1903. In 1910 the Central City Mission used No. 41 George Street.SCRA, 1979: AP/03 From 1969 No. 35 was occupied by Nita McRae, one of the founders of the Rocks Residents' Group and Green Bans activist. Much of the background work to coordinate the residents' action to save The Rocks community took place in this house. A plaque was placed in her memory in 1996.Duyker, S., 1999 Tenders were called in the early 1980s for the lease of the buildings for their current use of shops and offices. In June 1982 the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) issued an invitation to tender for lease and establishment of a medical centre at No. 37-39 George Street. It is assumed that the buildings were subsequently leased for medical purposes as at the end of 1985, consideration was being given to the \\"contraction of the medical practices at the above address [37 and 39 George Street], into 37 George Street\\". Openings which had been made in the shared party wall were infilled and the buildings were again separately leased. A Doctors Surgery continues to occupy the ground floor of No. 37 George Street. A separate office operates from the upper floor. The other buildings are currently occupied by various commercial and retail tenants. The name of the buildings, 'Sergeant Major's Row', appears to have been adopted by SCRA as a reminder for an early term for George Street, though this related more specifically the northern end of the street. In the early 1800s it was also known as \\"High Street\\", becoming \\"George Street\\" in 1810 after the then reigning monarch, King George III.Graham Brooks and Associates Pty Limited, 2004.

The name given the buildings by SCRA is a reminder of an early term for George Street which was begun as a track for water carriers carrying water from the Tank Stream to the marine encampment and the hospital - its original name was Spring Row. Then it was humorously altered unofficially to Sergeant-Major's Row, then officially to High Street by Governor King and finally to George Street by Governor Macquarie.National Trust, 1976  Description  Two storey terraced housing.; Built By: 1880s.

Nos. 29-31 were built of stone and reflect the \\"standard\\" terrace type pattern commonly found in and , with single span iron lace balcony, arched openings to ground floor and squared lintels to first floor. Half round dormer windows to attics give an added picturesque form. Nos. 33-41 were built of stuccoed brick and are of a larger, more decorative terrace type pattern, having wide balconies supported by centre cast iron columns, iron valences and balustrade.Sheedy, 1976 Style: Victorian Filigree; Storeys: Two; Facade: Stone and Brick; Roof Cladding: Galvanised Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors level with George Street. Stone quarried out at rear. = Modifications and dates = *Late 1960s: All terraces were renovated for continued use as residences. *Early 1980s: The terraces were leased for their current use of shops and offices.  Heritage listing  As at 26 June 2002, Sergeant Major's Row, a grouping of five terrace buildings located at 33-41 George Street and site is of State heritage significance for its historical, aesthetic and scientific values. The site and buildings are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area, which is of State heritage significance in its own right. Originally constructed as a speculative type development, the terraces have been occupied by a number of occupants and tenants as residences and later as commercial premises which generally reflects the growth and development of The Rocks. They are significant for their association with Robert Campbell, Edward Stanley Ebsworth and Nita McCrae who all had significant impact in the local area. The buildings are good and intact examples of late Victorian terraces that despite ongoing upgrades and some modification significantly retain their fundamental external form and characteristics, scale and details, internal spatial arrangement and a considerable amount of original and early fabric. They make an important contribution to the streetscape at the northern end of George Street as an intact grouping and representing the more human scale, early residences of The Rocks. The site and buildings provide accessible interpretation opportunities for the general public and tourists in the heart of The Rocks. Sergeant Major's Row was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The terraces are historically significant as they are representative the late nineteenth century development in The Rocks. Constructed in 1881 as residences by a local merchant, Edward Stanley Ebsworth, they were intermittently used as boarding houses and then commercial, retail and office spaces from the late 1970s which is reflective of a shift and changing nature, growth and development of the area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. Sergeant Major's Row is significant for its associations with Robert Campbell, to whom the land was first granted, with Walter Stanley Ebsworth, a prominent merchant and industrialist, and with Nita McRae, a founder of The Rocks Residents' Group and a Green Bans activist. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Row is a group of seven terraces in Victorian Filigree style which are very good examples of their type. They make an important contribution to the streetscape at the northern end of George Street. They relate well in scale and style to the pair of 1850s stone terraces at 29-31 George Street. The other buildings in the vicinity which were built early this century as part of The Rocks reconstruction by the Sydney Harbour Trust are larger in scale but sympathetic in materials and style and together with the terraces form a strong visual precinct. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The terraces have generally been occupied by a number of other individuals since construction and businesses from the late 1970s. The terraces have some association with The Rocks Residents' Group and Green Bans group through Nita McCrae who occupied No. 35 George Street during the 1970s. No. 39 was also occupied by the Nature Conservation Council during the 1980s. 37 & 39 also provided medical services to The Rocks community during this period. A Doctors' practice remains at No. 37. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The terraces clearly demonstrate and retain planning of a late Victorian residence and way of life of that period. The site, which retains the stone cut along its western boundary, that it would appear was quarried at some stage, emphasises and is a reminder of the early form and topography of The Rocks and modifications that were undertaken during its growth and development. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The terraces located at 33-41 George Street are good and intact representative examples of late Victorian terraces that generally retain their fundamental character and detail, however have been adapted which reflects the general shift and growth of The Rocks area. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The terraces demonstrate the typical design characteristic of the \\"standard\\" terrace type that is not rare or uncommon in The Rocks or the wider context with a number of similarly scaled and styled buildings located throughout the inner suburbs of Sydney.

It was written by Ed Hime and directed by Jamie Childs, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 2 December 2018. Set in Norway in 2018, the episode involves the alien time traveller the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) investigating the disappearance of a widower called Erik (Christian Rubeck). The episode was watched by 6.42 million viewers and received generally positive reviews from critics.  Plot  The Thirteenth Doctor and her companions arrive in present-day Norway, materialising near a cabin. They meet its sole occupant, a blind teen named Hanne who moved to the cabin with her father Erik following the death of her mother Trine. Her father has since disappeared, with Hanne unable to search for him because she keeps hearing a creature in the cabin every day. Upstairs, the group discover a bedroom mirror with no reflection, revealed to be a portal. While the Doctor, Graham and Yasmin enter it, Ryan remains behind with Hanne. Upon finding speakers around the house aimed at keeping her inside, Ryan's discovery prompts Hanne to knock him out and enter the portal. The Doctor and the others find themselves in the Antizone, a buffer-space between universes to prevent catastrophic damage. They briefly encounter Ribbons, a deceptive alien who guides them through the zone only to become prey for flesh-eating moths when attempting to take the Doctor's sonic screwdriver. The others evade them by entering another portal, finding themselves within a reflected parallel universe, whereupon they encounter Erik talking with Trine, despite her being dead. At the same time, Graham finds himself encountering his own dead wife, Grace. The Doctor deduces that they are encountering the Solitract, a sentient entity whose incompatibility with the universe led to its exile, becoming a universe seeking companionship. Hanne arrives and immediately recognizes the Solitract version of Trine as an impostor before being ejected back to the Antizone. The Doctor realizes that the Solitract is collapsing in on itself due to the group's presence. She then manages to get everyone out while convincing the Solitract to keep her instead of Erik by offering it her vast experience. The Solitract accepts the offer and ejects Erik, bringing the Doctor to a room within a white space. Despite her enthusiasm at the prospect of speaking to a sentient universe, as the Solitract assumes the form of a talking frog with Grace's voice, the Doctor explains she cannot stay as they are unable to co-exist. The Solitract releases her at her request, allowing her to make her way back through the Antizone before the portals collapse. After the adventure, Erik decides to return to Oslo with Hanne, while Ryan bonds with Graham and calls him \\"granddad\\" for the first time. =Continuity= During the episode, Yasmin makes a suggestion to the Doctor of \\"reversing the polarity\\".

It was written by Chris Chibnall and directed by Jamie Childs, and was first broadcast on BBC One on 9 December 2018. Set on the planet Ranskoor Av Kolos, the episode involves the alien time traveller the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker) and her companions Graham O'Brien (Bradley Walsh), Ryan Sinclair (Tosin Cole), and Yasmin Khan (Mandip Gill) working to stop the alien Stenza Tzim-Sha (Samuel Oatley) from using the powers of the psychic race the Ux to shrink the Earth in revenge for his previous defeat and exile thousands of years earlier. The episode was watched by 6.65 million viewers, and received mixed reviews from critics.  Plot  The Thirteenth Doctor directs the TARDIS to a planet called Ranskoor Av Kolos, where a large number of distress signals are originating. The Doctor and her companions find a large number of wrecked spaceships scattered on the planet's surface, as well as a psychic field that alters one's perception of reality. They come across an amnesiac pilot named Paltraki and help him regain his memories before he receives a video signal from Tzim-Sha. Tzim-Sha demands Paltraki to return an item ‚Äì seemingly a rock floating in a protective shell - to him in exchange for Paltraki's kidnapped crew. Graham later confesses to the Doctor his intent to kill Tzim-Sha to avenge his murdered wife Grace, accepting that he could never travel with the Doctor again should he survive. Once the group enters Tzim-Sha's ship, Graham and Ryan search for the kidnapped crew whilst Yasmin helps Paltraki remember his mission. The Doctor encounters Tzim-Sha, learning that he ended up on Ranskoor Av Kolos after their previous encounter on Earth, having won the loyalty of the religious-minded Ux, a race of two that can psychically manipulate reality. Tzim-Sha spends the next three millennia combining the Uxs' powers with Stenza technology to create a life support system and a weapon that shrinks planets like the one from Paltraki's ship. Yasmin and Paltraki discover four similar planets, the latter remembering his mission to save the planets Tzim-Sha took alongside a fleet that the Stenza devastated. Tzim-Sha then sets his sights to do the same to Earth out of revenge, ignoring the Doctor's warning that his actions threaten the fabric of reality. The Doctor reaches Yasmin and safely stops the Ux from shrinking Earth, convincing them that Tzim-Sha exploited them while asking their help. The Doctor works with the Ux to use the TARDIS and Tzim-Sha's ship to restore the planets to their original positions in space. Meanwhile, Graham and Ryan free Paltraki's crew along with the other ships' crews. This alerts Tzim-Sha as he enters his trophy room, finding Graham waiting to shoot him. But Graham manages to hold back, before Ryan's arrival provokes him to shoot Tzim-Sha in the foot to save his grandson.

Moran (May 2, 1870 ‚Äì April 12, 1941) was an American politician who served as President of the Massachusetts Senate from 1935 to 1936. Early life Moran was born on May 2, 1870 in Mansfield, Massachusetts. He graduated from Mansfield High School in 1887. He then spent a year at the Lawrence Academy at Groton. He studied civil engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but left after a year due to the death of his father. He then worked for many years as a signal tower operator for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. On February 19, 1903 Moran married Jane E. Chase of Mansfield. They remained married until her death in September 1934. They had no children. Moran graduated from the Northeastern University School of Law in 1914 and was admitted to the bar in 1916. Political career Moran was a member of Mansfield Republican organization since his early years. In 1911 he was appointed postmaster of Mansfield by President William Howard Taft. He was replaced by Taft's Democratic successor, Woodrow Wilson. From 1917 to 1919, Moran was a member of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He returned to the legislature in 1922 as a member of the Massachusetts Senate. He was the first Mansfield resident elected to the Senate in 56 years. =Senate presidency= Following the 1934 election, the Senate consisted of 21 Republicans and 19 Democrats. The Democrats wanted to persuade a Republican to run against incumbent Erland F. Fish for the Senate presidency in exchange for an equal division of committee chairmanships. Henry Parkman Jr. was reportedly approached, but Parkman denied working with the Democrats. The Democrats then chose to back Moran, who agreed to run for president. As the most senior member of the Senate, Moran also presided over the balloting for Senate president. The first six ballots ended with Fish and Moran each receiving 19 votes. Moran took a lead on the seventh ballot, with 18 votes to Fish's 17 and three other senators receiving 1 vote each. On the eighth ballot, Republican William A. Davenport switched sides and Moran was elected with 20 votes to Fish's 13 and Samuel H. Wragg's 5. Immediately after reading the result of the vote, Moran collapsed and was carried off to the Senate reading room, where he was attended to by Senator Charles G. Miles, who was a physician. Moran was reported to be under a great deal of strain due to his separation from his Republican colleagues and the stress of presiding over the tumultuous balloting for Senate president. During his tenure as president, Moran often sided with Democratic Governor James Michael Curley. In December 1936, Curley appointed Moran to the state racing commission. Moran died on April 12, 1941 following three years of illness.

It was built in 1891. It is also known as Zia Pina Pizzeria. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The site of 91 and 93 George Street was the site of the Assistant Surgeon's House, constructed shortly after the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788. The location of this residence relates to the location of the Colony's first hospital just to the south of the site. Once a more substantial hospital was constructed in Macquarie Street in 1816, the Assistant Surgeon no longer required the house. From about that time, the former Assistant Surgeon's house was occupied by Francis Greenway, a ticket-of-leave man who had been transported for forgery in 1814. Greenway was appointed to the position of civil architect and assistant engineer for the government in 1816, for which his salary included lodging quarters. This appointment ceased in 1822, however, Greenway refused to relinquish his government house. He produced a document (later claimed to be a forgery) purporting to give him title to the land. He appears to have continued to occupy the site until at least 1834, when the title was questioned and ownership reverted to the Crown. However, it was not until Greenway's death in 1837 that the Crown recovered the property, following action in London. Frederic Wright Unwin, solicitor and merchant, was subsequently granted the land in 1838. Unwin had extensive landholdings in the city, particularly along the western side of George Street. On 1 July 1839, Unwin leased an area of land to Michael Gannon, carpenter, for a period of 21 years. Gannon had arrived in the colony as a convict on the Almorah in 1820 and was granted a conditional pardon in 1835. The terms of the lease required that Gannon: It is unclear from the documentary evidence whether the Assistant Surgeon/Greenway's house had been demolished by the time Gannon took on the lease. However, by 1844, when the land was conveyed to R. A. A. Morehead and Matthew Young, Gannon had constructed a number of buildings on the land, including the New York Hotel at 91 George Street and a three-storey building at 93 George Street, as well as the terrace 95-99 George Street. Although Gannon was only required to erect buildings along the George Street frontage, the plan accompanying the conveyance in 1844 shows that the site also contained buildings along Argyle Street, and a workshop and stables accessible from the yard, all also presumed to be constructed by Gannon. The resulting configuration of the block was typical of urban planning in other quarters in The Rocks, that of a central yard, accessed through a passageway, and surrounded by buildings open to the public fronting the adjacent streets, as well as workshops or factory buildings opening primarily to the yard. Gannon was also responsible for the creation of the laneway (now known as Greenway Lane) accessing the yard from Argyle Street. In 1845, the hotel was described as \\"stone and shingle 3 storey hotel of 15 rooms\\" and the building then at 93 George Street was described as a \\"shop with 6 rooms.\\" Sands Directory listings for the site show that the New York Hotel operated as such until 1861, while the building at 93 George Street was a seaman's boarding house. Michael Gannon died , having been declared insolvent in 1845. The insolvency records list Gannon's address as Argyle Street, and his occupation as builder. In the early 1860s, the uses of both buildings changed. While 93 George Street became a green grocer, 91 George Street was used by Henry Fisher & Son, ship brokers, as a warehouse. By 1866, however, use of the building reverted to a hotel under John B. Bassetti, who operated the Italian Hotel. In 1870, the land containing 91 and 93 George Street was sold to William Yeoman, painter, and who, from the 1860s, owned the land at 95-101 George Street. Yeoman occupied a store which was constructed by Gannon as a workshop in the yard behind George Street. In 1885, Yeoman sold the land to John Gill. Eliza Hirshan was the occupant for 1848-1850 and Robert Brickell occupied the shop between 1851-57. From 1863 Mrs Rosa O'Brian, a dealer and fruiterer occupied the shop and dwelling owned by Messrs. Moorehead & Young and in 1869 the Chinese Merchants, Sun Lee Kee & Co. were the tenants. The tenement was turned into a boarding house in 1870 and remained so until 1877 apparently annexed to the public house adjacent on the north side. However, in 1877 Mrs Honorah Lawrence re-established the premises as a green grocers shop. She remained as a tenant until 1888. In 1889 Mrs Ada Boyce managed refreshment rooms. Although listed as a boarding house intermittently from 1859, the ground floor of 93 George Street was consistently occupied by a green grocer until 1889, when it was listed as a boarding house. It is possible that a boarding house operated in the upper floors even during years that a green grocer is recorded in the Sands Directory as the occupant of the building. Documentary evidence dating to 1890 shows that the building housed lodgers in association with the (now named) ASN Hotel Building at 91 George Street. On 26 February 1890, the City Building Surveyor, George MacRae, wrote to the City of Sydney Improvement Board to alert the Board to the premises at 93 George Street which was \\"in a ruinous condition and dangerous to the public.\\" The request was marked \\"Urgent\\" and was considered by the Board at a meeting two days later, during which the Board made a visit to the site. The same day, the Board heard received statements from the City Building Surveyor as well as John Lord, agent for the owner of the property, Robert Gill, grazier of Moonbi, who had inherited the land after John Gill's death in 1888. The City Building Surveyor's evidence before the Board provides a good account of the building: The agent for the owner, John Lord, told the Committee: In response to questions from the Board, Lord stated that he was not aware that there were 25 beds in five rooms and that in one room 19' x 17' there were nine beds. He said that his attention had been drawn only that day to some stones in the cellar having collapsed. The Board resolved that the building be \\"taken down [condemned] forthwith\\". In so resolving, the Chairman of the Board asked the City Building Surveyor if the \\"hotel adjoining the premises this day inspected was proposed to be dealt with, the Board having noticed that it appeared to be in a bad condition.\\" The Surveyor responded that \\"he had looked over the hotel building but it was not nearly in so bad a condition as the premises No. 93 George Street\\". He would, however, shortly make a more minute inspection as to its safety, when the building now condemned was taken down he would have a better opportunity of doing so. Although the documentary evidence does not indicate when the Board's order was carried out, the physical evidence suggests that 93 George Street was demolished and rebuilt as a two- storey with cellar shop, and that 91 George Street was substantially rebuilt at the same time, shortly after the Board's order in 1890. As both buildings were under one ownership, and both buildings were leased to Tooth & Co, it is likely that the rebuilding of the pair was carried out in a single event, resulting in the shared decorative features evident in early 20th century photographs of the buildings, including the garland decoration to the parapets. It appears that the upper floors of 91 George Street were extended toward the west and built over Greenway Lane during this substantial rebuilding. The Sands Directory contains no listing for either building in 1891, possibly as both buildings were under construction at the time. When listed again in 1892, the ASN Hotel was under a new licensee, R. B. Goof, and 93 George Street housed O'Neill & Co, outfitters. O'Neill & Co remained in the building until 1907, when it became refreshment rooms. Following the outbreak of plague in Sydney's waterfront areas in 1900, the property was turned over to the Crown as part of the resumption of the entire Rocks area. Following this resumption, the Maritime Services Board administered leases of 91 and 93 George Street until 12 January 1970, when ownership was taken over by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority. In 1976, the shop at 93 George Street underwent substantial renovations and opened as the Zia Pina Pizzeria.  Description  The Victorian Italianate style building is a two storied, brick built and cement rendered shop, constructed as part of the adjacent former ASN Hotel.CLS&P; 1999 It has an unusual garland decoration below the parapet. The shopfront was altered by Tooth & Co.; in 1928. In 1983, as part of the work to adapt the adjacent hotel to a police station, the shopfront (1928) was removed and an \\"1890s shopfront\\" constructed. The 1983 shopfront is not a reconstruction of the original shopfront, the details of which are unknown (2001). Style: Victorian Italianate; Storeys: 2; Roof Cladding: Corrugated Iron; Floor Frame: Timber. = Condition = As at 3 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Mostly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors level with George Street, but below that of Greenway Lane. Cellars below. = Modifications and dates = Facade: ; 1928; & 1983  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, the Zia Pina Pizza Shop and site is of State heritage significance for its aesthetic, historical and scientific cultural values and its contribution to The Rocks area, which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The shop at 93 George Street, built after a previous () building on the site was condemned by the City Improvement Board, provides an interesting reflection of the 19th century approach to town sanitation and improvements. Although a modest two-storey shop building typical of its time, 93 George Street shares a number of decorative elements with the former ASN Hotel building at 91 George Street, and contributes to the aesthetic diversity of The Rocks streetscape. The site is historically significant as a place continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788, and for the associations of the site with the first colonial architect Francis Greenway. Together with other buildings in the immediate vicinity constructed by emancipist Michael Gannon, the site, including Greenway Lane, demonstrates an approach to town planning typical of the 1840s development of The Rocks. The site has scientific significance for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of road surfaces and earlier buildings on the site. The building is socially significant for its long history, and for its contribution to The Rocks area, Australia's premier heritage precinct. Shop, Zia Pina Pizzeria was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site of 91 and 93 George Street is historically significant as a site continuously occupied by Europeans since 1788. The configuration of the buildings and Greenway Lane is historically significant in demonstrating the approach to urban planning prevalent in The Rocks . No. 91 George Street and the original building at 93 George Street were constructed contemporaneously, together with the buildings at 45-47 Argyle Street and 94-99 George Street, by Michael Gannon under the terms of his lease of the land, imparting this group of buildings with a shared origin and history. Further, 91 and 93 George Street are linked by their common subsequent ownership and operation (with 93 George Street functioning at times as a boarding house associated with the hotel at 91 George Street). Additionally, the construction of the current building at 93 George Street in 1890 was accompanied by the substantial rebuilding of the hotel at 91 George Street, resulting in a number of decorative features shared between the two buildings. The current building at 93 George Street was constructed in 1890 as a direct result of the condemnation of the previous building on the site by the City of Sydney Improvement Board, and is an interesting reflection of the 19th century approach to town sanitation and improvements. The shop at 93 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site of 91 and 93 George Street is of significance for its association with the First Fleet, as the site of the house of the Assistant Surgeon from c1788. The Assistant Surgeon's residence is also associated with the first colonial architect, Francis Greenway, who lived in a house on the site between 1815 and . The original buildings on the site, although demolished and rebuilt (no. 93) and substantially rebuilt (no. 91) in 1890, are associated with Michael Gannon, a ticket-of-leave convict who made a living as a builder in The Rocks, developing a substantial parcel of land, including the subject site, from 1839. Gannon is an interesting example of the mid-19th century class of pardoned convicts who remained in NSW and practiced trades or professions. The shop at 93 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. 91 and 93 George Street, as a pair, are aesthetically significant as a fine example of the Victorian Italianate style, characterised by the unusual garland decoration below the parapet (both buildings) and the decorative cartouche located on the splayed corner of 91 George Street. 91 George Street is aesthetically significant for its prominent contribution to the streetscape at the intersection of the two main streets in The Rocks, George and Argyle Streets. Although making a less prominent contribution to the streetscape, 93 George Street is of significance in continuing the uniform character of the smaller scale retail shop buildings with awnings found along George Street in The Rocks. Both 91 and 93 are significant as contributors to the visual diversity of the streetscape. Both buildings are aesthetically significant for their contribution to the streetscape of Greenway Lane, one of the pedestrian laneways in The Rocks area which are highly significant as evocations of the colonial townscape. The shop at 93 George Street meets this criterion on a State level. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The buildings are socially significant for their long history and for their contribution to The Rocks area, Australia's premier heritage precinct, as evidenced by their inclusion on a number of lists of buildings of heritage significance formulated by community groups such as the National Trust of Australia (NSW), and representative bodies such as the City of Sydney Council and the Heritage Council of NSW. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site is technically significant for the archaeological potential to reveal evidence of earlier configurations of the hotel structures and road surfaces as well as the c1788 structure occupied by the First Fleet's Assistant Surgeon and later by Francis Greenway. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building has rarity value being a component of the extant Victorian Italianate-style hotel and shop building in The Rocks. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The former ASN Hotel at 91 George Street is representative of hotel buildings in The Rocks in terms of its fabric, size, series of renovations, and historical uses. Likewise, the shop at 93 George Street is an example of the large number Victorian period retail shops in The Rocks of similar fabric, size, periodic renovations, and uses. The shop at 93 George Street meets this criterion on a local level.

Though there was little local film production in Italian Libya and the Kingdom of Libya, cinema-going became a popular entertainment activity. From 1973 onwards, Muammar Gaddafi tried to exercise control over cinema. Though he encouraged some local filmmaking, his obstruction of foreign film consumption resulted in the closing of cinemas. In the post-2011 instability in Libya, hopes for a resurgence of Libyan cinema combine with a lack of infrastructure. Pre-1967 cinema The earliest recorded film to be made in Libya was a 1910 French-made documentary, Les habitants du desert de Lybie.Film in Libya, in Annette Kuhn & Guy Westwell, A Dictionary of Film Studies, Oxford University Press, online version, 2012. Italy, as a colonial power, made some short documentaries about Libya.Hans- Christian Mahnke and Ramadan Salim, On Film and cinema in Libya ‚Äì Interview with Libyan film critic and festival director Ramadan Salim, African Film Festival, Inc., 2014. Libyan battles during World War II were covered in British, German and Italian newsreels. After the war, oil companies and international agencies made occasional documentaries. After independence in 1951, the Kingdom of Libya made some short films about Leptis Magna to encourage tourism. Yet Libya was poor and there was relatively little filmmaking in the country. In 1959 the Ministry of News and Guildance established a cinema division, touring the country with 16mm documentaries and newsreels, and the Ministry of Education and Learning produced some educational films. Despite the relative lack of cinematic production, film consumption was extremely popular as entertainment. The country's first cinema had been established as early as 1908,Mahmoud Darwesh and Nawas Darraji, Spotlight: Cinemas, theaters in Libya face extinction, Xinhua, 1 May 2018. though it was reportedly demolished after the Italian invasion of Libya in 1911. The Italians established cinemas, mostly but not exclusively for Italian audiences, in Libya's major cities. From the 1940s until the mid-1960s, Libya boasted a large number of cinemas: around 14 or 20 in Tripoli, and around 10 in Benghazi. Cinemas in Tripoli included the outdoor Arena Giardino and the opulent Royal Cinema, which Gaddafi would rename Al-Shaab (The People).Rim Taher, Tripoli's 'Cinema Paradise' hold out as other cinemas shut doors, Middle East Eye, 4 September 2015. Cinema under Gaddafi Gaddafi came to power in 1969. He regarded foreign films with suspicion, regarding them as American cultural imperialism. Previously the only feature films shot in Libya had been by foreign filmmakers ‚Äì films like Albert Herman's 1942 A Yank in Libya or Guy Green's 1958 Sea of Sand. The first Libyan feature film, Abdella Zarok's black-and-white When Fate Hardens / Destiny is Hard appeared in 1972. In 1973 the General Council for Cinema was founded, to take control of filmmaking and cinema building in Libya. Foreign films were dubbed into Arabic, and needed to comply with the government's cultural policy, a mix of religious law and nationalism. Most home-made films were documentaries, and social realism was promoted as an ideal for fiction films. The General Council for Cinema continued to operate until 2010. It made documentaries, around 20-25 short films, and helped support the few feature films that were made in the 1970s and 1980s. Gaddafi exercised direct personal control over film production. For example, he censored the release of a film by Kasem Hwel, Searching for Layla al-‚ÄòAmiriya. Gaddafi established a production company to make Egyptian films. In the mid-1970s the government took increasingly direct control of all cinemas, blocking the importation of films, and cinemas began to close. Alongside Kuwait and Morocco, Gadaffi's government-sponsored Mustafa Akkad's controversial 1976 filmic account of the birth of Islam, The Message. However, many Arab countries would not screen the film, and it triggered a Nation of Islam siege of three office buildings in Washington, D.C.Steve Rose, Lights, camera, revolution: the birth of Libyan cinema after Gaddafi's fall, The Guardian, 1 October 2012 Akkad's Lion of the Desert (1981), funded by Gadaffi's government, was a historical action movie portraying the Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar resistance against the Italian colonization of Libya. The film was censored in Italy until 2009. In 2009 it was announced that Gaddafi's son al-Saadi Gaddafi was financing private-equity production company involved in financing Hollywood films like The Experiment (2010) and Isolation (2011). In 2009‚Äì2010 foreign companies agreed to refurbish and re-open Libyan cinemas and theatres. However, the 2011 revolution resulted in this work coming to a halt, and much of the equipment was stolen. Cinema since 2011 After the fall of Gaddafi, there was widespread desire for Libyan film to re-assert itself. However, cinema's resurgence has been obstructed by fighting and Islamist objections. Young Libyan filmmakers started to make short films, with support from the British Council and the Scottish Documentary Institute. Film festivals in Tripoli and Benghazi were popular but targeted by Islamist militants.Ghaith Shennib, Young Libyans find escape in Tripoli's art cinema, Reuters, 16 May 2013. The International Mediterranean Film Festival for Documentary and Short Films was established in 2012. In 2013 a cinema club was discreetly established in the basement of a Tripoli art gallery. By 2015 only a single movie house remained in Tripoli, a men-only venue serving action movies to the militias controlling the city.

She is credited with having created the first heartthrob, desire-filled version of Austen's hero, Mr. Darcy.  Early life  Helen Jerome (born Nellie Bruton) (10 May 1883 ‚Äì 1966) began her early life in London, England. She was the daughter of William Bruton and his wife, and was raised Catholic. They emigrated to Sydney, Australia where William Bruton became a civil servant with the New South Wales postal department and raised their seven children. William Bruton's sister was Sister Mary Cecelia (Ellen) Bruton who was a Superior Rectress of the St Mary‚Äôs Hospice in Darlinghurst, Sydney. One of Helen‚Äôs brothers, William Joseph Bruton would become a solicitor and would also publish pieces in The Bulletin magazine. Helen took up writing, contributing poems and articles to the Catholic Freeman‚Äôs Journal in Sydney and The Bulletin in the 1890s. She married Armand Jerome, a publisher in Sydney in June 1900. They travelled to Paris on their honeymoon and Helen submitted travel stories for Australian newspapers while overseas. They had one child, Carmen. Helen continued to write under her new name, for The Worker, The Age and other newspapers, in Australia and overseas, writing travel pieces, poems and other news items. She travelled widely to Japan, Russia, the United States and Europe. Armand Jerome died in 1924. By 1923, Helen Jerome had moved permanently to the United States and published a book, The Secret of Woman in New York. Her daughter Carmen attended university in the U.S. and married Marc Matson of Washington, D.C. Jerome moved into song writing and adapting novels for the stage in the 1930s. She wrote the book of the play Pride and Prejudice: a sentimental comedy in 1932 and Jane Eyre: a drama of passions in three acts in 1936. The former was produced successfully for the stage in the U.S. and England. Jane Eyre was also successfully staged. Tufts University honoured Jerome with a Master of Arts degree in 1937. Jerome also worked on other adaptations. Jerome became a naturalised U.S. citizen in 1940. She was married to George D. Ali, an oil company executive until his death in 1942. Jerome alternated between living in both Britain and the United States. She died in England in 1966.  Legacy  Jerome‚Äôs adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, led to the successful film version of the book in 1942, directed by Robert Zigler Leonard. Her adaptation of the novel fleshed out the character of Elizabeth‚Äôs suitor Mr Darcy, providing notes to assist the actors and alert the audience to the attraction between the two characters.

In July 2020, they released their debut album, Mafia Bidness. History Shoreline Mafia was composed of 4 members: Ohgeesy (real name, Alejandro Carranza), Rob Vicious (Robert Magee), Fenix Flexin (Fenix Rypinski), Master Kato (Malik Carson). Ohgeesy and Fenix met in 2012 while doing graffiti in Los Angeles. The pair began making music soon after, and, sometime later, Rob Vicious and Master Kato joined them. Although they produced music for several years, they did not become a rap group until 2016. They chose the name Shoreline Mafia at some point after their formation. In November 2017, they independently released their first full-length mixtape, ShoreLineDoThatShit. The album featured songs such as \\"Nun Major,\\" \\"Musty,\\" and \\"Bottle Service.\\" Most of the songs on the album were produced by Ron-Ron including \\"Musty\\" and \\"Bottle Service,\\" the beats for which the group was not initially authorized to use. Despite this, the two parties eventually formed a partnership that continues to exist. In December of that year, the group performed at the Rolling Loud Festival in San Bernardino, California. In the spring of 2018, the group headlined their \\"Only The Xclusives\\" (OTX) tour. In May 2018, Atlantic Records announced that it had signed Shoreline Mafia. At that time, the label also re-released ShoreLineDoThatShit and debuted a new music video for the song, \\"Musty.\\" Later that month, the group embarked on the \\"Still OTX\\" tour, which included stops at the Rolling Loud Festival in Miami and, later, at the Billboard Hot 100 Music Festival in New York. In June 2018, Shoreline Mafia was featured on songs on the Ron-Ron and Friends compilation mixtape alongside 03 Greedo, Drakeo the Ruler, and others. The following month, Rob Vicious released a solo mixtape titled Traplantic. The songs on the album also featured members of Shoreline Mafia, including \\"Bands\\" which had verses from everyone. In August 2018, the group released a 4-track EP called Party Pack via Atlantic Records. In the fall of 2018, the band went on their \\"Only The Xclusives\\" tour throughout the United States. The group also performed at the Los Angeles iteration of the Rolling Loud Festival in December 2018. In early April 2020, Fenix Flexin announced that he would be leaving Shoreline Mafia after the release of their new album, Mafia Bidness. The album followed on July 31, 2020.

Concept and construction alt=Nakroma in September 2007 The Democratic Republic of East Timor is made up of three main parts, being the eastern half of Timor, the exclave of Oecusse adjacent to the northwestern coast of Timor, and the island of Atauro. Passport-free transport between these three locations is possible only by sea. In 2002, the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned a cooperation project to improve East Timorese living conditions by establishing a regular maritime passenger and goods transport connection between the three locations. From 2003 to 2006, a passenger ferry was chartered to operate such a connection. During that period, around 3,400 passengers used the service each month. In February 2007, a new ferry commissioned by the BMZ and financed by KfW Development Bank, the Nakroma, was officially handed over to the East Timorese government to assume the operation of the service. The donated ferry was built in Surabaya, Indonesia, by PT PAL. She is a roll-on/roll-off vessel long, and has a beam of . Her tonnage is and .

In recognition of the success of the cooperation project, the ferry was renamed Berlin Nakroma. Service history Berlin Nakroma operates regular ferry services linking Dili with Pante Macassar in Oecusse, and with Atauro, using landing facilities in Dili and Oecusse that were upgraded as part of the cooperation project. The vessel flies an Indonesian flag with Jakarta as her port of registry, although an East Timorese ship registry was established in 2015 and was scheduled to be up and running by 2017.

As at November 2018, it appears to be without any buildings or structures (apart from the railway line). Although the town plan show streets, there is no visual evidence of those streets having been established.  History  The town's name is derived from the railway station name, assigned by the Queensland Railways Department on 18 November 1911, as the junction name for the line to Quilpie, from the Charleville to Cunnamulla line. The town is first shown on a 1913 survey plan. Queensland electoral rolls show a large number of railway construction workers living in a camp in 1913, constructing the railway line. In 1922, the electoral roll shows a small number of railway workers living there, presumably operating and maintaining the line. After that, there appears to be no permanent population.

It moved three times: first to Kinmel Hall near Abergele in Denbighshire in 1948 and then to Haynes Park in Bedfordshire in 1976 before merging with Monkton Combe School, near Bath, Somerset in 1992.  Foundation of Clarendon School in Malvern, Worcestershire in 1898  Clarendon School was established in a private house in North Malvern, Worcestershire in 1898 by Miss Amy Flint, assisted by her sisters Annie and Mary. The first pupils were seven boarders aged between six and sixteen. The Misses Flint were the daughters of an Evangelical Christian travelling preacher and embedded their strong Christian values and ethos in the day-to-day operation of their new school. Miss Amy Flint remained as headmistress of Clarendon School until her retirement in 1930. She died in 1942.  The move to Abergele, Denbighshire in 1948  During World War II the school numbers grew to such an extent that new, larger premises had to be found. Some 150 girls were living in eleven houses around Malvern, and the school could not operate efficiently. Kinmel Hall, Abergele in Denbighshire was selected to house Clarendon School, with Sir John Laing (businessman) stepping in to provide support. The school moved from Malvern to Abergele in twenty Pickfords removal lorries in April 1948 - its fiftieth anniversary year.  The move to Haynes Park, Bedfordshire in 1976  In 1956 the Clarendon School Trust was established, taking the school out of private ownership. In September 1975 a large fire devastated the central part of Kinmel Hall. Meanwhile, Hawnes House School at Haynes Park in Bedfordshire had become bankrupt and its fine buildings had become available. So in early 1976, Clarendon School moved to Haynes Park.  The merger with Monkton Combe School in 1992  In 1992 Clarendon School agreed to merge with Monkton Combe School, an independent boys' school based just outside Bath, Somerset which had been founded in 1868. The two schools shared the same aims and Christian ethos and as Monkton Combe School had taken the decision to become fully co-educational that same year the merger was swift.  Clarendon House at Monkton Combe School  The name of Clarendon School continues as the name of one of three girl's boarding houses at Monkton Combe School.

A supporter of self-government, she is remembered as one of the most active figures in the labour movement, heading the Havnar Arbej√∞skvinnufelag (T√≥rshavn Working Women's Association) for almost 40 years. Biography Born out of marriage on 23 December 1891 in T√≥rshavn, Andrea S√∫sanna Rasmussen was the daughter of Jacob Johansen and Susanne Rasmussen. She was brought up by her maternal aunt and uncle, Kathrine Malene Rasmussen and Elias Johansen, in the R√¶ttar√° district of the capital. Johansen was a boat builder who had been active in politics. After finishing school, √Årting worked in dried fish production and in a fish shop. When 17, she caught tuberculosis and spent a couple of years in a sanatorium. She then went to Denmark where she worked as a maid for six years. In 1922, she married the fisherman Johannes Frederik (Heinesen) √Årting, with whom she had four children. In 1937, √Årting was elected chair of the T√≥rshavn Working Women's Association which had been founded the previous year. Most of the members were women working in the fishing industry who found it difficult to take on responsibilities in the organization as they would have to take time off work. As a local resident, √Årting could afford to be more independent and was not afraid to appear in public. She was therefore able to lead the organization with only short interruptions until 1977. She was also a board member of the F√∏roya Arbei√∞arafelag (Faroese Workers' Association) from 1940 to 1958, thereafter becoming a lifelong honorary member. √Årting was an effective leader, fighting for better pay for the workers who earned far less than fishermen, especially in the 1950s. She took part in many critical negotiations, participating in a strike in 1951 which was successful in avoiding a threatened reduction in workers' salaries. In her later years, she also fought for equal salaries for men and women, obtaining success in 1977 when it was agreed that women's hourly pay should be increased incrementally year by year until reaching that of men in 1981. On the political front, √Årting was also active in pushing for Faroese national independence. Though not successful, in 1940 she was one of the first women to stand for the elections to the L√∏gting, representing the Loysingarflokkurin or Separatist Party. With the founding of the Tj√≥√∞veldisflokkurin Republican Party in 1948, she became one of its most faithful supporters. Outside interests From her childhood, √Årting was interested in music, learning to play various instruments. She wrote poems and songs, often supporting better conditions for the workers. She also encouraged women in the rowing sport known as kaproning which had traditionally been reserved for men. More generally, she inspired women to enter public life, believing them to be just as capable as men, as she herself had demonstrated. Death Andrea √Årting died in T√≥rshavn on 30 May 1988.

Given global aviation development, exploring its possibilities and setting up aircraft records were an everyday occurrence. The one who had the idea of making a major air tour was Lieutenant colonel Alexandru Cernescu, in 1932. A core of aircraft pilots consisting of Alexandru Cernescu and captains George Davidescu and began to organize the air tour. They chose the distance from Bucharest to Cape Town and return to be the route. The first air tour of 1933 did not reach its goal, as it stopped at Malakal. In 1933 and 1935, Gheorghe BƒÉnciulescu also conducted two air tours over Africa, the first to Cairo, over the Near East, returning over North Africa and Italy, and the last exploring the possible air routes over Central Africa. At the beginning of 1935, also attempted to cover the route to Cape Town by her own plane, reaching the Victoria Lake. In 1935 Cernescu, Davidescu, Pantazi, , Gheorghe Olteanu and Anton Stengher managed to complete the air tour.  Historical background  Aviation began to develop rapidly after World War I. There appeared various types of aircraft, not only military ‚Äî bombers, fighters, reconnaissance and trainers ‚Äî, but also civil aircraft, including passengers, postal and private aircraft.Istoria Avia»õiei Rom√¢ne, p. 232 Each aircraft manufacturer wanted to bring their airplanes in the public eye, the airline companies explored new routes, whereas military aviation was interested in increasing the performance of the military aircraft: the speed, the ceiling, the rate of climb, the transport capacity etc.Istoria Avia»õiei Rom√¢ne, p. 128 Besides record-breaking, aviation asserted itself by air \\"tours\\", long-distance travels, such as those from London to Melbourne, from Paris to Tokyo and return, or from Bucharest to Saigon and return.Cernescu, p. 13 Due to its difficult climatic, meteorological and terrain conditions, Africa was considered a continent where the qualities of the aircraft and the skill of the pilots could be fully aired. As far back as October 1913, the French aviator and his mechanic, Henri J. Roux, attempted to fly a Borel monoplane from Paris to Cairo, but they could not fly above the Taurus Mountains.

McAdam, Birth of an Airline, rhodesia.nl, access date 2014-03-15  Planning the tours  The idea behind Romanian air tours conducted in Africa appeared in 1932, when a core group of three officers, Lieutenant colonelEquivalent to Wing commander Alexandru Cernescu, Captains George Davidescu and Mihail Pantazi began to do some research for this purpose.Cernescu, p. 24 At that time Alexandru Cernescu held the highest rank as a flight instructor at the Military Aviation School. George Davidescu, as a member of the State Undersecretariat for Air, dealt with the proper organization of the tour, as he was also the main navigator. Mihail Pantazi was a flight instructor and director and he taught the aircraft engines at the (ARPA) Flight School.Cernescu, p. 25Ucrain, p. 159Gheorghiu, p. 75 First, they studied the route of a flight around the Mediterranean Sea, which started from Bucharest, then continued over Asia Minor, Egypt, North Africa, Spain, France, and back to Bucharest. Although the route exceeded 10,000km, they did not considered it difficult enough. In order to demonstrate the performance the Romanian aircraft could reach, the route over the centre of Africa to Cape Town was conducted by a flight formation of three school and training aircraft, which technically reached a small private aircraft performance. The round-trip route exceeded 24,000km.  Bucharest ‚Äì Malakal tour  Before the flight: Ploe»ôteanu, Ivanovici, Davidescu, Cernescu, Manolescu, and Pantazi. Three aircraft of the ARPA, registered as YR-AAP, YR-ABL »ôi YR-ABO,Romanian Civil Aircraft Registers & Production, yumpu.com, access date 2017-06-18 were selected to perform the tour. Through the efforts of the State Undersecretariat for Air, the fuel necessary for the tour was provided by the refinery, and delivered by Shell. Shell also provided the documentation: air guides, newsletters and weather forecasts.Ucrain, pp. 160-161 The aircraft were overhauled and fitted with additional gas tanks providing an 800km flight autonomy, improved fuel tanks, dust filters for engines. They were supplied with spare parts (even a propeller attached above the posterior fuselage of YR-AAP aircraft, as shown in the picture below) and repair kits, signaling missiles, a first aid kits, food and water supplies, 1:1,000,000 or 1:2,000,000-scale maps, papers, even handguns.Cernescu, pp. 27-28 Lieutenant and , aerobatics pilots and flight instructors at the ARPA piloting school, as well as the aircraft technician Dumitru Ploe»ôteanu also took part in the team. The crews were distributed as follows: Cernescu and Manolescu on board the YR- AAP, Davidescu and Ivanovici on board the YR-ABL, and Ploe»ôteanu and Pantazi on board the YR-ABO.Cernescu, pp. 25-26 File:YR-AAP Africa raid 1933.jpgCernescu and Manolescu File:YR-ABL Africa raid 1933.jpgDavidescu and Ivanovici File:YR-ABO Africa raid 1933.jpgPloe»ôteanu and Pantazi File:YR-AAP Mediteranean Sea 1933.jpgOver the Mediterranean, near Silifke File:Davidescu Pantazi 1933 Cairo.jpgDavidescu and Pantazi in Cairo Malakal route map The planned route of the flight was Bucharest‚Äì Istanbul‚Äì Eski»ôehir‚Äì Konya‚Äì Adana‚Äì Aleppo‚Äì Gaza‚Äì Cairo‚Äì Assiut‚Äì Assuan‚Äì Wadi Halfa‚Äì Atbara‚Äì Khartum‚Äì Kosti‚Äì Malakal‚Äì Juba‚Äì Kisumu‚Äì Nairobi‚Äì Moshi‚Äì Dodoma‚Äì Mbeya‚Äì Mpika‚Äì Broken Hill‚Äì Salisbury‚Äì Bulawayo‚Äì Pietersburg‚Äì Johannesburg‚Äì Kimberley‚Äì Victoria West‚Äì Cape Town and return.Cernescu, p. 29 Some of these customs points were compulsory.Cernescu, p. 30 Climactically, air tours could be organized in March‚ÄìApril or September‚ÄìOctober. The air tour started with enough delay, on the 22October, because Pantazi was ill. The one-way air route is marked in red on the map herewith. They passed through the compulsory customs points of Giurgiu, Varna and Istanbul. Because of the bad weather they stopped in Istanbul, where they visited the Galata Tower, the Pera district, Taksim Square, the ruins of the Valens Aqueduct, Hagia Sophia, Topkapƒ± Palace, the Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum, the Military Museum, the Grand Bazaar, different mosques.Cernescu, pp.30‚Äì43 On 25October, they could hardly managed to fly over the Taurus Mountains, through a saddle at the height of 1,750metres, which is the ceiling that loaded aircraft can reach. Then they reached the Mediterranean above Silifke (the old Seleucia). After that they flew over Mersin and had the customs formalities carried out at Adana. After flying around the Gulf of Alexandretta they landed at Aleppo. The following day they took off, flew over Baalbek and the site of the Battle of Qadesh, and stopped over at Rayak Air Base to deliver a message from the French air attach√© in Bucharest. They fly through the valley of the Jordan River over Lake Tiberias. After the Dead Sea they turned to Jerusalem and reached Gaza. They entered Egypt through the compulsory customs point of El-Qantarah el- Sharqiyya, and then they landed in Cairo, where they spent three days, overhauling their aircraft and visiting the Pyramids.Cernescu, pp.43‚Äì64Ucrain, pp.162‚Äì168 The crew left Cairo on 29October along the length of the Nile. At Assiut they met Muhammed Taher Pasha, Chairman of the Aero Club of Egypt.About Aero Club of Egypt, aeroclubofegypt.net. Retrieved 2018-12-26 They flew over Abydos, the Valley of the Kings, Thebes, Luxor and Karnak and stopped at Assuan. The following day they flew over the first cataract of the Nile, the Philae Island, and hedgehopped over the temples of Ramesses II and Nefertari at Abu Simbel. They entered Sudan and stopped at the customs point of Wadi Halfa. They flew over the second cataract, then cut the meander of the Nile through the desert, along the Wadi Halfa‚Äì Abu Hamad railway line up to Railway Station No. 6, where they overnighted. The following day they flew over the fifth cataract, Atbara, and after the sixth cataract they reached Khartum, where they stayed for two days as the engine of Pantazi's aircraft needed overhauling.Cernescu, pp. 64-80Ucrain, pp. 168-170 After a short stage to Kosti, they reached Malakal on the 4 November, where they were caught in a torrential rain that deformed the plywood on the wings and empennage. As the aircraft could not be repaired on the spot, the pilots decided to return on the same route. Since the aircraft were lighter and thus they could fly longer routes, they chose some stops instead of others (Atbara instead of Railway Station No. 6, and Luxor instead of Assuan, respectively), and cancelled others (Assiut, Rayak, Konya), as you can see the purple marks on the map hereby. They reached Cairo on the 11November and left on the 14November. Due to the light aircraft they flew over the Taurus Mountains with no difficulty, and reached Bucharest on the 17November. They flew over 10,500km in that journey.Cernescu, pp. 80-111Ucrain, pp. 170-171  BƒÉnciulescu's tour  In 1933 Lieutenant colonel George BƒÉnciulescu was Secretary General of the (ARR). He took over the position in 1927 from Commander Andrei Popovici.BƒÉnciulescu- Cozadini, pp.73‚Äì75Gheorghiu, p.44 In this capacity he would participate, together with George Valentin Bibescu, and George Constantinescu, at the 33rd General Conference of the International Aeronautical Federation (IAF), which took place in Cairo between 20‚Äì25December 1933.1905-2004 General Conferences, fai.org, access date 2014-03-22 Different air shows were planned on that occasion.The Postal History of ICAO, icao.int, access date 2014-03-22BƒÉnciulescu-Cozadini, pp.98‚Äì99Gheorghiu, p.49 1934 tour route map They flew the Stinson S Junior aircraft of Prince Bibescu, registered as YR- GVB, to Cairo.

He returned alone to Bucharest, following the route: Cairo‚Äì Alexandria‚Äì Mersa Matruh‚Äì Tobruk‚Äì Benghazi‚Äì Tripoli‚Äì Tunis‚Äì Palermo‚Äì Roma‚Äì Venice‚Äì Zagreb‚Äì Belgrade‚Äì Bucharest. In the first stage, he flew to Tripoli, where he received a glorious welcome. Crossing over the Mediterranean from Tripoli to Palermo lasted three hours. He flew at a low altitude because of the fog. The stage was very dangerous, and no matter how high he had flown higher, an engine breakdown of a single-engined aircraft would have caused a fatal alighting, due to the long flight of about 150km over the water between the Cape Bon and Marsala. The stage ended in Rome. The following day he took off at 5.00a.m. and reached Bucharest after stopping at Lido di Venezia, Zagreb and Belgrade, being welcomed enthusiastically all over the place.Cozadini-BƒÉnciulescu, pp.101‚Äì103Ucrain, pp.189‚Äì190  Burnaia and Ivanovici's tour  Burnaia and Ivanovici before departure Irina Burnaia also wanted to fly her own IAR-22 aircraft,Loreman Cristinel Ta»ôcƒÉu.

Burnaia and Ivanovici on their return from the tour The crew left the BƒÉneasa airport at 10.00 in the morning on 3January.Burnaia, p. 95 During the flight, there were many mechanical failures and difficult taking off from Aleppo, where the ground is soft. Moreover, at Damascus, Ivanovici had a fever for a few days, which delayed so much their arrival in Cairo, on 12February, where they stayed for eight days to have the aircraft overhauled.Burnaia, pp.115‚Äì126 They continued the flight on 20February flying over Luxor. They only took off from Assuan and Juba at 4.00 in the morning because of the hot weather. They took off from Entebbe, which is at an altitude of 1,150metres, only after five days, with favourable wind. They decided to discontinue the flight, because Nairobi is located even higher, at 1,700metres altitude, but they still flew over Lake Victoria up to the Equator. They had the aircraft as light as possible, by sending their stuff to Cairo with the Imperial Airways, and by supplying with fuel to only reach Juba.Burnaia, pp.127‚Äì140 They stayed in Cairo for five days to make a complete overhauling and repainting of the aircraft. They were prevented from taking off from Haifa because of the rainfalls. They reached BƒÉneasa back at 4.00 in the 24--March afternoon. The air raid lasted for 80 days as a whole, out of which only 16 days of flight, the rest being delays. In total, they flew over 12,000km.  BƒÉnciulescu and Bibescu's tour  Bibescu and BƒÉnciulescu in Cairo, 17March 1935 Louis Agnus on board the Potez 561 aircraft In 1934 Air France intended to open some air routes to Southern Africa, Madagascar and Syria, by using the territory of the French colonial empire in Africa. , Chief of the French Minister for Air, and General Victor Denain, drew up a list of the pilots who could explore the least-known equatorial region of Africa. The list also included George Valentin Bibescu, Chief of the IAF at that time, and BƒÉnciulescu, who was Bibescu's suggestion. The third member of the crew was Louis Agnus, Air France's radiotelegraphist and mechanic.Cozadini-BƒÉnciulescu, pp.120‚Äì124Ucrain, p.193Gheorghiu, p.51 The air tour was to be conducted by Bibescu's Potez 561 aircraft, registered as YR-FAI. The aircraft, new, had been equipped by the plants of Potez in M√©aulte, which also installed an English aircraft radio. BƒÉnciulescu flew training routes to London or Nuremberg with those aircraft of Air France. The aircraft were brought to Paris on 8March.

The following day they flew 1,700km to Tunis, of which 600km were flown over the Mediterranean Sea. They reached Benghazi on 15March, and Cairo on the following day. They continued the journey on 18March, when they flew 2,000km to Khartum, with a stop at Wadi Halfa for getting fuel and had the customs formalities carried out. On 19March they flew over the desert of Sudan and Al- Ubayyid and reached Al-Fashir. The following day, in heavy torrential rains, they reached the most western point of the air tour, Fort-Lamy in Chad, after a layover at Ab√©ch√©. They also flew in the rain from here to Fort-Archambault over Fort Brettonet and then over Fort Crampel to Bangui. The storm forced them to deviate from the route, so they reached the Oubangui River near Kouango, from where they headed for Bangui. Here they rested for two days. On 24March they reached Bangassou, where they explored landing grounds. They reached Juba on the following rainy day, and after another day, on a suffocating weather, they flew 1,300km to Atbara, with a single layover at Malakal. On 27March, on the route to Wadi Halfa, they reached Cairo through a sandy storm which could affected their engines. They had flown about 22,000km altogether.Cozadini-BƒÉnciulescu, pp. 125-134 All that was left was the route to Syria. They took off for Rayak on 30March, after they had rested for two days. They reached Damascus on 31March, and Palmyra on 1April, where they stayed for a while before they took off for Gaza over Haifa. On 2April, they reached Cairo. BƒÉnciulescu felt sick.

The organizers of the flight proposed the Fleet F-10G or the ICAR Universal Biloc aircraft, which had 130HP engines,Antoniu, pp. 198, 217 and the Air Force Commander suggested the SET 7K aircraft, which was a more powerful metallic biplane of420 HP.Antoniu, p. 246 The State Under-Secretary for Air chose the ICAR's.Cernescu, p. 113 They were fitted with extra petrol tanks, improved oil radiators, ballon tyres, d√©rivom√®tres, and instruments for flight with no visibility. As a result, the flight ceiling dropped from 5,500m to 4,000m, but the payload increased by 165kg, and the flight autonomy tripled.Cernescu, pp.113‚Äì115 In order to simplify the flight procedure, the aircraft got civil registrations, namely: YR-ACK, YR-ACL and YR-ACM.Cernescu, p. 116 The resources needed for the flight were provided by the City Hall of Bucharest, which offered 950,000lei out of 1,100,000, of which about 850,000 were destined for gasoline and oil, and the State Undersecretariat for Air, which supplied the planes and provided the remaining 150,000lei.Ucrain, pp.203‚Äì205 The six participants to the air tour were Lieutenant colonel Alexandru Cernescu, Lieutenant colonel George Davidescu, Lieutenant colonel Mihail Pantazi, colonelEquivalent to Group captain Gheorghe Jienescu, Captain Gheorghe Olteanu and the aircraft technician Anton Stengher. The crews were formed in such a way that in each of them there was participant of the 1933 air tour. Davidescu and Jienescu were on board the YR-ACK, Cernescu and Olteanu, on board the YR-ACL, while Pantazi and Stenger flew the YR- ACM.Ucrain, pp.201‚Äì205 Cape Town route map Those stages could be longer due to the greater flight autonomy of the aircraft. The itinerary was: Bucharest‚Äì Istanbul‚Äì Eski»ôehir‚Äì Adana‚Äì Aleppo‚Äì Cairo‚Äì Assuan‚Äì Wadi Halfa‚Äì Khartum‚Äì Kosti‚Äì Malakal‚Äì Juba‚Äì Kisumu‚Äì Nairobi‚Äì Dodoma‚Äì Mbeya‚Äì Mpika‚Äì Broken Hill‚Äì Salisbury‚Äì Bulawayo‚Äì Pietersburg‚Äì Johannesburg‚Äì Kimberley‚Äì Victoria West‚Äì Cape Town and return.Cernescu, p. 117 As the experience of the 1933 tour showed, the September‚ÄìOctober period was not the best period for flying, that is why they made the decision to perform the tour in April.Cernescu, p.118 Thus, they left Bucharest at an early hour on 4April and followed the same route as in 1933, but they had a layover in Istanbul, and flew without a stop from Eski»ôehir to Adana. To save time, they cut across the Gulf of Alexandretta on the following day, had the customs formalities carried out at Aleppo, and flew straight to Cairo, over the Lebanon Mountains, Tripoli, the Mediterranean Sea to reach El Arish and El Kantara. The next day they removed the old wooden propellers in Cairo, and replaced them with metal Hamilton ones (produced by Fleet), because they had seen some cracks on the old ones. The operating cost was high. They flew to Assuan on the old route on the very day. They reached Khartum on 17April, and the following day flew over Malakal to reach Juba. Thus, the route became longer than in 1933.Cernescu, pp.118‚Äì136Ucrain, pp.206‚Äì207 Then they left the Nile and flew non-stop to Kisumu, over Lira, Lake Kioga, Tororo, and the Kavirondo Gulf, an extension of Lake Victoria, as the compass showed. And later that same day, they flew to Nairobi, by passing over the south of the Mau Escarpment. Nairobi airport was the highest airport on the route, reaching an altitude of 1,700m. In Nairobi, they met Captain Caspareuthus (see above), a line pilot who flew a four-engined Atalanta aircraft, who would help them several times during the flight. They flew over Lake Manyara and Lake Natron and had a layover at Dodoma for refuelling, where they were reached by Caspareuthus, who had had a stop at Moshi. They had to use a compass to fly through a mountain passage to Mbeya. Caspareuthus drew up the route on a business card, but as they were lucky to get to the crossing simultaneously with Atalanta, this one was their guide.Cernescu, pp.136‚Äì148Ucrain, pp.207‚Äì209 On 21April they took off from Mbeya with the intention of flying to Mpika, but due to a wrong heading they turned east. They realized the error when the time indicated that they had exceed Mpika, but they recognized the Lavushi Manda mountain at about 20km on their right-side, at which height they actually had to fly. They looked around, corrected the heading and reached Broken Hill. In order not to get lost again, instead of flying directly to Salisbury, they flew along the railways to Lusaka and then along the Zambezi River. The leading crew of the formation, Cernescu and Olteanu, dive in their attempt to recognize an auxiliary landing field, the next (Davidescu and Jienescu) followed it, but the third (Stengher and Pantazi), which had fallen behind, did not catch sight of them and flew forward and even \\"put on steam\\" thinking that they was long behind. They lost each other, only the first two aircraft reaching Salisbury. The airport employees worried about that, Caspareuthus and the Interior Minister (!) suggested to look for it, but they decided to wait until the following day. On the morning of 22April, Pantazi's engine could be heard. Pantazi and Stengher had spent the night on an auxiliary landing field near Zambezi, waiting for them to pass. Being excited, they decided to no longer fly the following day, thus dropping off the \\"timetable\\".Cernescu, pp.148‚Äì157Ucrain, pp.209‚Äì210 On 23April, they took off for Pietersburg, but a gasoline leak on the aircraft of Davidescu and Jienescu forced them to land at Bulawayo, which they only intended to fly over. They were greeted by the family of a Romanian man married to an Englishwoman and their two daughters, who were waiting for them without knowing that they would not have landed if it had not been for the malfunction. After repairing the tank they reached Pietersburg. Because it was already night, they could not fly to Johannesburg, as they intended. The following day they landed at the Rand Airport near Johannesburg. The navigation was easy, using the railways as landmarks. They flew over Bothaville, Hoopstad and arrived at Kimberley. During the last stage they stopped at Wictoria West to chill off their bones, as it was a very cold weather of late autumn, then passed north the Hex River Mountains, and reached Cape Town on 25April, where they were greeted by the commander of the airport, Romania's General Consul, the Swiss consul, a journalist and a photographer.Cernescu, pp.157‚Äì166Ucrain, pp.210‚Äì214 They rested in Cape Town for three days, while they visited the city and the officials. On 30April, they left for the country on the same route. On their return, they had the opportunity to visit the De Beers in Kimberley, where they saw diamonds and brilliants. Then there came the Johannesburg and Pietersburg stages. After they took off from Pietersburg, they found out that Davidescu and Jienescu's aircraft was losing gas again, so they returned. As the tank could only be repaired at the workshops of Imperial Airways in Johannesburg, Davidescu had to make a night train journey. Caspareuthus brought them luck again, as he asked Davidescu to join him in the co-pilot's seat, because there was no seat left. Caspareuthus deviated again from the route to show Davidescu around Pretoria at night. In Johannesburg, Davidescu was invited to visit the two local flight clubs in Germiston and Baragwanath until the tank was repaired. Caspareuthus himself took him back, so on 4May they were ready to fly for Salisbury. In the following stage, they were determined to pinpoint Mpika. Although they were flying with the compass again, that time they were no longer wrong and made it back home. The stages followed with no incidents, but in Nairobi, they had to stop because Stenger had malaria. They had to spend four days in Nairobi, while visiting the Southern Game Reserve.Cernescu, pp.166‚Äì192 On 13May, they continued the flight, and on the following day, they flew over the Bujagali Falls from where they reached Juba. After taking off from Malakal, the tank of the YR-ACK sprang a leak again, which forced them to land at Kosti. They patched the tank, and they patched it again more or less at Khartum. That patch lasted until they flew from Wadi Hatfa, that is why the crew had to pump gas manually every five minutes for five and a half hour to Cairo. They reached Cairo at 11.30, on 18May, where they asked for another tank to be delivered from Romania, which would come in three days. Meanwhile, they visited the museums and the Step Pyramid of Saqqara. They left Cairo on 22May, but they encountered another problem: at Adana they found out that the upper struts of the unlucky YR-ACK aircraft's fuselage were cracked. They improvised a patching and, in order not to overload the aircraft's tail, they got the approval of not landing in Istanbul, and had the customs formalities carried out at Eski»ôehir. They reached BƒÉneasa on 25May, where they were greeted by the crowd and officials: General (Defence Minister), General Radu Irimescu and Nicolae Caranfil (the former and current State Under-Secretary for Air), George Valentin Bibescu (President of The International Aeronautical Federation), Al. Gh. Donescu (Mayor of the Capital), General , (Commander of the Royal Air Force of Romania), etc. They were led to the Royal Palace immediately, where they received the Golden Cross of the from King Carol.Cernescu, pp.192‚Äì212Ucrain, pp.214‚Äì215 Altogether, the air tour lasted for 27 days, 149 hours and 10 minutes, of which the 23,000km of actual flight were flown in 73 hours and 5 minutes.Gujdu, pp.170‚Äì173 The flight in Africa was considered one of the greatest successes of the Romanian aviation.

Historically main generic characters for bird are ni«éo (old school, traditional character = È≥• / simplified character, based on cursive form = È∏ü) and the other main \\"bird\\" word / character graph zhuƒ´ (Èöπ). Many specific characters are based on these two radicals; in other words, incorporating one or the other radical as constituent to a more complex character graph, for example in the case of the Peng bird (traditional character graph = Èµ¨ / simplified = Èπè): in both cases, a version of the ni«éo character is radicalized on the right. =Spoken word= Modern pronunciations vary and the ancient ones are not fully recoverable. Sometimes the Chinese terms for mythological or legendary birds include a generic term for \\"bird\\" appended to the pronounced name for \\"bird\\"; an example would be the Zhenniao, which is also known just as Zhen: the combination of Zhen plus niao means \\"Zhen bird\\"; thus, \\"Zhenniao\\" is the same as \\"Zhen bird\\", or just \\"Zhen\\". =Translation= Translation into English language of Chinese terms for legendary and mythological birds is difficult, especially considering that even in Chinese there is a certain amount of obscurity. In some cases, the classical Chinese term is obviously a descriptive term. In other cases, the classical Chinese term is clearly based on the alleged sound of said bird; that is, what is known as onomatopoeia. However, often, it's not so simple (Strassberg 2002, xvii-xviii). Auspicious birds Very auspicious birds include the Feng, the Fenghuang, and the Luan (Strassberg 2002, 102 sub XI:49). Symbolically representative birds Some birds in Chinese legend and mythology symbolize or represent various concepts of a more-or-less abstract nature. =Directional Bird= The Vermilion Bird of the South symbolically represents the cardinal direction south. It is red and associated with the wu xing \\"element\\" fire. =Persistence= The Jingwei bird represents determination and persistence, even in the face of seemingly over-whelming odds. =Totem birds= Some birds may function as totems or representative symbols of clans or other social groups. Associated birds Some birds are associated with other mythological content. =Three-legged Bird of the Sun= A three-legged bird or birds are a solar motif. Sometimes depicted as a Three-legged crow. =Messenger bird= The Qingniao is associated with the Queen Mother of the West, bearing her messages or bringing her food (Yang 2005, 219 and Christie 1968, 78). =Features of mythological geography= Some birds feature as part of visions of the mythological geography of China. According to the Shanhaijing and it's commentaries, the Bifang can be found on Mount Zhang'e and/or east of the Feathered People (Youmin) and west of the Blue River (Strassberg 2002, 110 and 163) Transportation Certain birds in mythology transport deities, immortals, or others. One example is the Crane in Chinese mythology. Various birds Other birds include the Bi Fang bird, a one-legged bird (Strassberg 2002, 110-111). Bi is also number nineteen of the Twenty-Eight Mansions of traditional Chinese astronomy, the Net (Bi). There are supposed to be the JiƒÅn (È∂º; jian1): the mythical one-eyed bird with one wing; Jianjian (È∂ºÈ∂º): a pair of such birds dependent on each other, inseparable, hence representing husband and wife. There was a Shang-Yang rainbird. The Jiufeng is a nine-headed bird used to scare children. The S√π ShuƒÅng (È∑´È∑û; su4shuang3) sometimes appears as a goose-like bird. The Zhen is a poisonous bird. There may be a Jiguang (ÂêâÂÖâ; j√≠guƒÅng). Real birds Dalian, Liaoning, China: An example of a real bird: a peacock of the family Phasianidae, in the \\"Singing Birds' Forest\\" (È∏üËØ≠Êûó) The line between fantastic, mythological, or legendary birds and actually real exotic birds is sometimes blurred. Sometimes, the student of the real versus the unreal becomes challenged. Sources Various sources for information on Chinese legends and mythology about bird.

Her watercress business was the largest watercress company of the time in Europe.  Life  She was born Eliza Currall, in Birmingham, England, on 30 September 1855. She began selling watercress to help support her family following the suicide of her father. At the age of 16, she was under detention as a female juvenile offender at the Warwickshire Reformatory for Girls in Coventry, which taught offenders a trade. Around 1877, she moved to London. On 28 May 1877 she married William Arthur Griffiths, a mariner, in Liverpool and they had four daughters and three sons. They lived in Coventry, Birmingham and Liverpool before settling in Sheffield as fruit and vegetable sellers. By 1886, she owned a fruit and commission agency business at Castlefolds Market in Sheffield. Her husband was an alcoholic, and on three occasions stabbed her. He threatened to murder her when she attempted to take divorce proceedings against him, and he was imprisoned in 1897. She was granted a divorce by decree nisi in April of that year, while William was in Wakefield gaol. In her divorce petition, she argued that from the start of her marriage she had maintained her children with her own resources. It was rescinded on the basis of adultery, as she had lived with another man, James Fleet, a meat salesman at Sheffield market, in Glasgow after the divorce nisi, which she mistakenly believed had legally ended her marriage. She married Fleet in 1902, describing herself as a widow, and the couple lived in London and were sellers at Covent Garden market. In 1912 she visited the United States of America with her daughter, travelling out on the ocean liner Carmania and returning on the Lusitania. = Watercress business = Watercress (Nasturtium officinale) Vitacress watercress beds in St Mary Bourne Because of her success as an entrepreneur and grower, she was known as the Watercress Queen. She was a successful businesswoman in a male-dominated environment, and in 1908 was trading in her own right as a saleswoman of watercress and salad. She diversified her trade, and began supplying, in addition to markets, restaurants, hotels and shops, and gained an almost monopoly of London's watercress market. She founded her company James & Son and from 1908 invested in watercress beds in Hampshire and Surrey, in Hurstbourne Priors and St Mary Bourne on the Bourne rivulet. She leased six acres of watercress beds from the Earl of Portsmouth in 1908, and again in 1917, this time a further nine acres. Her business suffered from the extensive drought of 1921, for which she had to sink artesian wells for irrigation. Her firm was the largest watercress company in Europe, and she became among the largest owners of watercress sites in the world. Despite her success as a businesswoman, James continued to work on her stall at Covent Garden Market, opening each morning having arrived on her son-in-law's watercress cart.  Death and legacy  She died on 26 September 1927 from a brain haemorrhage, arteriosclerosis, and chronic Bright's disease. She was buried at West Norwood Cemetery in London, where her coffin was laid with a large wreath of watercress. By the end of her life, James was supplying London's restaurant trade, selling 50 tonnes of watercress a week. The fields of watercress beds she created in Hampshire are still used for watercress production, and are now owned by Vitacress Salads.

It was created by decree of May 29, 1762 in place of the abolished Conference at the Highest Court. The Council had the right to issue decrees signed by the emperor, and, in part of the cases, to make decisions without his participation (signed by Council members on behalf of the sovereign). The Council‚Äôs focus was on the war with Denmark conceived by the emperor. During the palace coup on June 28, 1762, members of the Council Alexander Vilboa, Mikhail Volkonsky, Mikhail Vorontsov, Alexey Melgunov, and Nikita Trubetskoy supported Catherine the Great, but the empress who ascended the throne dissolved the Imperial Council, soon establishing its own advisory body ‚Äì the Council at the Highest Court. Composition of the Imperial Council The Council included: *Georg Holstein-Gottorp (first member of the Imperial Council) *Peter August Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Beck, President of the Collegium of Foreign Affairs *Mikhail Vorontsov, President of the College of War *Nikita Trubetskoy, secret secretary *Dmitry Volkov, Director of the Cadet Corps *Alexey Melgunov *Burkhard von M√ºnnich *Alexander Vilboa *Mikhail Volkonsky Project of Nikita Panin In the first year of the reign of Catherine II, a project for the formation of the \\"Imperial Council\\" in Russia arose among the most influential people. On January 17, 1763, the Prussian envoy Solms reported the rumor that came to him that the empress decided to \\"elect five or six people who, with the titles of state secretaries, would manage the collegiums; they will gather in the empress's office, reporting to her each according to their industry and receiving orders from her\\". Actually, on January 8, 1763, Catherine II signed the Manifesto on the establishment of the \\"Imperial Council\\", but it was not made public. According to the draft drafted by Nikita Panin, the number of members of the Council should be in the range of six to eight; at the same time, the Senate was deprived of the right to legislate and was divided into departments. The project of Panin of the permanent Imperial Council of high-ranking officials, Catherine II rejected,Many of its provisions, however, were implemented, including the transformation of the Senate: it was divided into several departments, some of which were transferred to Moscow, forming the Moscow Senate office there. explaining: \\"By law, the established Council will rise in time to the value of co-ruler, bring the subject too close to the sovereign and may give rise to the desire to share power with him\\". As Sergey Solovyov pointed out in the History of Russia: The draft manifesto was discovered by Nicholas I on November 26, 1826 in the office of his deceased brother, Alexander I, signed, but with a torn signature. The documents submitted by Panin on this issue were published in 1871 in the seventh volume of the Collection of the Imperial Russian Historical Society.

He was a co-author of the design report of the first Soviet two-stage thermonuclear bomb, the RDS-37. Life and career He was born in Odessa, Ukraine. He attended the Institute of Chemical Technology in Dnipropetrovsk , graduating in 1931. From 1932 to 1941, he taught at his alma mater. He was an avid motorcyclist and reader; he read and re-read the complete works of Vladimir Lenin and Friedrich Engels. Upon the invasion of Ukraine by Nazi Germany in 1941, Aleksandrovich was evacuated to the city of Pyatigorsk, North Caucasus, and his wife and children to the nearby city of Kislovodsk. He had been excused military service on medical grounds. He protected Jews and partisans from the Nazis by hiding them in a petrol station that he had been managing in the Crimea. In December of 1941, he moved his family to Tbilisi, where his father lived, while he returned to his work at the Pharmaceutical Institute in Pyatigorsk. He organised the manufacture of military items for Soviet resistance under a civilian cloak e.g. making grenades at a toy factory. He and other employees were instructed to destroy anything of value in the Pharmaceutical Institute when it was clear the city was about to fall to Nazi troops. He moved to Tbilisi and joined the engineering corps of the Transcaucasian Front as a chemical engineer. In 1943 he was sent to their military warehouse in Kakheti. On the order of the State Defence Committee, he was sent to join Igor Kurchatov's Laboratory No.2 in 1944, as a junior technician in the nascent nuclear industry. He worked for a time at the Institute of Chemical Physics in Leningrad, where he also met two leaders of the Soviet nuclear programme, the overall leader Yulii Khariton and Yakov Zel'dovich. The endeavour was moved under tight security to KB-11, in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast. Alfred Yanovich Apin, from the Institute of Chemical Physics, led Laboratory No.1 from June 1947, in which Aleksandrovich, V.A. Davidenko, M.V. Dmitriev, V.R. Negin and designer A.I. Abramov were put to work designing and manufacturing neutron-emitting primers for the bombs. Three laboratories worked separately under Apin, and it was decided the manufacture would take place in Alesandrovich's laboratory, with equipment offered by Davidenko's. The production route used newly-produced, vastly more efficient but highly dangerous beryllium/polonium material, following intelligence gathered from Allied research developed from the Manhattan Project. New safety protocols and equipment were developed, however most of the workers in Laboratory No.7 died from radiation-induced illnesses. Khariton ordered the first three sets of primers from Aleksandrovich for June and July of 1949; the first Soviet nuclear bomb, the RDS-1, was detonated on 29 August. Aleksandrovich received the Order of Lenin and a prize, the first of a few awards for his nuclear work in the 1940s and 1950s. Apin returned to his role at the Institute of Chemical Physics in 1949 and Aleksandrovich took over as head of the laboratory. He was one of only two departmental or laboratory heads at KB-11 who were members of the communist party. He was also the sole old friend to remain on good terms with physicist Boris Smagin after the latter was investigated, sacked and internally ostracised (and unable to leave as a security risk) for having losing a small nuclear component.

During Governor Macquarie's administration the Terry's business interests prospered where \\"he held more than a fifth of the toal value of mortgages registered in the colony\\". He became known as the \\"Botany Bay Rothschild\\", at the time of his death in 1838 he left a personal estate of ¬£250 000, an annual rental income from his Sydney properties of ¬£10 000 and \\"land property which defies description\\". On the site of 139-141 George Street, Terry constructed a terrace of three buildings (today's 139-143 George Street) on his allotment. They were evidently completed in the mid to late 1820s, and they appear on the Hoddle, Larmer and Mitchell \\"Map of Sydney\\" of 1831. The few available images of the buildings suggest a substantial structure of three stories with a prominent breakout capped by a closed pediment. The terraces were constructed for general retail outlets, as they are today. From the mid 1840s tenants of the premises are listed in street directories and council rate assessments. The first of these is for the years 1842-1845 when Isaac Moore, dealer, traded from premises with a street address of no. 663 Lower George Street. Isaac Moore, incidentally, was also the licensed publican of the adjoining Patent Slip Hotel around this time. Between 1849 and the mid 1850s the tenants were the Downes family (John and Eliza) who operated a clothing store (described as a \\"slop warehouse\\" and 'general outfitter'). Toward the end of the 1850s, in 1857 the building was leased by Andrew Bogle who operated a boarding house. Bogle was succeeded by Mrs Ballantyne in 1858 who with John Ballantyne for the period 1859 to 1861 leased the premises as a drapery store. The property was held by Samuel Terry's widow and principal trustee, Rosetta, until her death in 1858. For a short period after this her real property was controlled by Mrs Rebecca Fox until June 1860 when the estate was partitioned. The beneficiary of this part of the estate was William Whaley Billyard, the crown solicitor of New South Wales. Shortly after, Billyard sold the property to William Reilly for ¬£1,762. (Reilly also acquired title to the neighbouring Russell Hotel site at the same time). Coincidental with the commencement of Reilly's ownership, street directory entries from 1863 for the premises ceased, but as the building was extant this may suggest it was either left vacant (as stated in a Council rate assessment return for 1863) or, conceivably, became part of the operation of the hotel on the Russell Hotel site, the Patent Slip, for a period. By 1866 the building had been demolished and from 1867 the street directories and rate assessments list the address as \\"vacant land\\". In June 1877 the property was transferred back into the ownership of William Whaley Billyard. In July 1881 the property was transferred into the ownership of Leo Ferdinand Sachs (further details on Sachs are not known). At the same time Sachs entered into the first of a number of mortgages made in the early 1880s, the last of which was discharged in 1886. These mortgages may have been used by Sachs to erect the extant building, which was under construction in 1882 and completed by the end of that year. The new premises provided a pair of shops fronting George Street with the street addresses of No. 139 and 141. The first tenant was William Howes, a tailor and clothier, occupant of both No. 139 and 141 in 1885. Ownership was then transferred in June 1885 to auctioneers Edmund Compton Batt and John Mitchell Purves. Batt and Purves' interest in the property was short lived and after securing two tenants in August 1886 Thomas Cripps, confectioner, for no. 141 and Thomas Selig, pawnbroker, for no. 139 (although actually tenanted by Joseph Selig, tailor and clothier)) sold the property to the Earl of Carnarvon, whose financial interests in Australia were managed by the financier and politician Sir William Patrick Manning (1845-1915). Selig continued to lease no. 139 until 1887, while Cripps' lease of no. 141 ceased during 1889. In February 1888 Thomas Stephen Small purchased the property and retained ownership until the government resumption of 1900. During these twelve years of Small's freehold ownership, No. 139 George Street was principally used as a restaurant and neighbouring no.141 had mixed uses as a chemist, butcher and confectionary. The use of the upper floors at this time would seem to have been for accommodation associated with the restaurant operations. A photograph of the neighbouring The Fortune of War Hotel of around 1906 includes a glimpse of the shopfront and awning of No. 139 George Street with advertising for rooms. The plague outbreak in January 1900 prompted the government to resume the entire Rocks and Millers Point area. To administer the resumed area a number of government authorities were established, The Rocks was administered by the Sydney Harbour Trust and its successor the Maritime Services Board until 1970. Initially under Government ownership the respective premises continued to function in a similar manner as to when the properties were held in freehold title. No. 139 for example continued as a restaurant although operated by a succession of different proprietors (with a short interim between 1909 and 1910 when it was leased by Isaac Levy, clothier). No. 141 continued to be leased from 1900 until 1913 by F. G. Erler, chemist. Following Erler in 1914 was F. A. Benson who initially traded as a chemist until 1923 and between 1924 and 1928 as an accountant. From 1929 up to the 1950s the premises were leased by John George Peek, chemist. During 1930s Peek also entered into a lease of the adjoining premises at No. 139, trading as an optometrist. In November 1987, the proprietors of the Russell Hotel (Russell Hotel Pty. Ltd.) acquired the lease of the two upper floors of No. 139-141 George Street as part of a scheme to amalgamate the trading operations of the Fortune of War (No. 137 George Street) and the Russell Hotel (No. 143 George Street). The ground floor shops however of No. 139-141 George Street continued to operate under separate lease arrangements. In 1985, for example, No. 139 was leased by Rentoul Pty. Ltd. trading as the Sheepskin Shop, and No. 141 was leased by Dinallo's Fruit Shop. Rear of the former terrace houses located at 139-141 George Street, pictured in 2019. The walkway is The Nurses Walk. Commencing in the late 1970s and continuing through the 1980s the then Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) undertook a programme of restoration and reconstruction of the premises at no. 139-141 George Street. These alterations also included the construction of the premises at the rear of 139-141 George Street, known as 30-32 Nurses Walk. Contemporary with the SCRA alterations, further alterations and additions were undertaken over the 1980s. This work was prepared for the proprietors of The Russell Hotel by Ron Vickery architect, and included in 1984 a new development at 30-32 Nurses Walk, which was completed in the mid 1980s and provided the additional rooms and connections with the neighbouring premises under the joint The Russell Hotel lease.  Description  The building is a large three storey building of dressed sandstone in the Classical Revival manner built . The upper floor windows have fine detailing in the carved stone surrounds, and the whole building is topped by a high parapet with a large central pediment. The shopfronts have been much altered.National Trust 1977 Style: Front facade 'Neo-classical'; Storeys: Three; Facade: Brick walls; Internal Walls: Brick; Roof Cladding: Iron; Floor Frame: Timber No. 139-141 George Street is a double storey sandstone masonry built commercial premises constructed . The premises are currently leased as retain outlets (ground floor - Rockhounds and the Sheepskin Shop) and as hotel accommodation (first and second floors) which is part of The Russell Hotel operation. The rear of the premises is a modern building which adjoins a laneway now known as Nurses Walk.Clive Lucas Stapleton; 1999 = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Mostly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Cellars under No. 139. Recent renovation. Floors terraced into hill slope. The work involved the assessment of underfloor deposits at this site during renovations. No evidence was found of structures pre-dating 1881, although it should be stressed that not all archaeological deposits were removed from the site. Investigation: Watching Brief.  Heritage listing  As at 31 March 2011, this pair of shops and residences and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. It is a rare example of a late nineteenth century decorative sandstone fa√ßade in the Classical Revival style a set within a streetscape, George Street North, which is the most intact nineteenth and early twentieth century streetscape in the City. The building and site demonstrate longevity of European use that is historically associated with the early colonial development in Sydney in being part of the general hospital site (1788-1816) and part of a stone terrace of three constructed for Samuel Terry (c.1830s). The subsequent use of the site as retail/commercial shops with upper floor boarding rooms is closely associated with the later economic and social development of The Rocks area as a place of residence and travellers. The building is included on key heritage registers maintained by government and community groups and these recognise the heritage values of the item individually and as part of the historic Rocks precinct. The site is also of local heritage significance owing to its potential to reveal evidence of earlier site uses and structures. Shops and Residences - stone was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The item meets this criterion at a state level owing to the longevity of European use of the site, which is associated with the early colonial development in Sydney in being part of the general hospital site (1788-1816) and part of a stone terrace of three constructed for Samuel Terry (s). The subsequent continuous use of the site as retail/commercial shops with upper floor boarding rooms is closely associated with the later economic and social development of The Rocks area as a place of residence and travellers. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site is associated with Samuel Terry and his wife Rosetta. Terry was a successful emancipist merchant, landowner and became known as \\"The Botany Bay Rothschild\\". Between 1817 and 1820 he held more than a fifth of the total value of mortgages registered in the colony, a higher proportion than that of the Bank of New South Wales. He was also one of the largest shareholders in the bank, but when he stood for election as director in 1818, 1819 and 1820 he was unsuccessful; when elected in 1822 he was refused his seat on the pretext that, as an expiree, he was not \\"unconditionally free\\". When again elected to the board of the Bank of New South Wales in August 1828 by 308 votes to 83 he took office only until December. By that time he had become a leading philanthropist, contributing to the Benevolent Society, Auxiliary Bible Society, Sydney Public Grammar school, and later to Sydney College, on whose committees he served actively. He supported the Wesleyans and became a trustee for them in 1822. In the late 1820s Terry was firmly established as a public figure, though still often censured for his methods and for his material success. He became increasingly identified with the political aspirations of the emancipists and at times their spokesman: for example, as treasurer of the committee formed in 1821 to defend their rights. In 1827, 1830 and 1831 he was a leader in organizing petitions for trial by jury and a house of assembly, and also in expressing patriotic feeling through Australia Day celebrations; he was in the chair at the fortieth anniversary dinner in 1828 and again in 1831 as first president of the \\"Australian Society for the Promotion of the Growth and Cultivation of Colonial Produce and Manufactures\\". In 1826 he became president of a Masonic Lodge and was prominent in its activities in the following years of his life. Despite criticisms and snubs he had attained a position of public eminence and often of public responsibility. When Terry died on 22 February 1838, three years after a paralytic seizure, he was buried with Masonic honours and the band of the 50th Regiment led the procession. The funeral, described as the grandest seen in the colony, may be taken as the summation of his life's striving. He left a personal estate of ¬£250,000, an income of over ¬£10,000 a year from Sydney rentals, and landed property that defies assessment. His will was eventually published by the government as a public document. His wife lived until 5 September 1858. The family sold to the government the land now occupied by Martin Place and the General Post Office, Sydney. The Terrys, Samuel and Rosetta, may be seen in retrospect as two able, single-minded early colonists who resolved to reverse their unfavourable, brutalizing early fortunesand succeeded. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The item meets this criterion at a state level as an important extant example of a late nineteenth century commercial building in the Classical Revival architectural style with its decorative sandstone fa√ßade set within the streetscape of George Street North, which is the most intact nineteenth and early twentieth century streetscape in the City. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The item meets this criterion at a state level owing to its inclusion on key heritage registers maintained by government and community groups which recognise the heritage values of the item individually and as part of the historic Rocks precinct. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item meets this criterion at a local level owing the potential of the site to reveal evidence of earlier site uses and structures. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The item meets this criterion at a local level owing the rarity of the decorative sandstone fa√ßade and setting with the heritage streetscape of George Street North. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The item meets this criterion at a local level in being a representative example of a late nineteenth century commercial premises built in the economic boom of the 1880s.

Kanayo), who has since become a millionaire profiting off organ trade. Collins persuades Mike to become a fellow member of the secret cult known as the Vultures, which is led by a \\"Great Vulture\\" spirit who promises Mike \\"instant wealth\\". At the Great Vulture's command, Mike kidnaps a child who is then imbued with moneymaking abilities. Unbeknownst to Mike, the child is Chief Collins' only son, thus his kidnapping creates a rift between the two men. Three years later, the Great Vulture demands a blood sacrifice from Mike, who delays this by offering his wife and mother instead. In the film's second arc, Mike attempts to appease the vengeful spirit of his mother by collecting seven human heads; his newfound life as a serial killer is constantly interfered with by the police.

Architecture Early engraving of the viaduct as it appeared soon after opening. The viaduct is approximately long, and consists of eleven elliptical arches, elevating above the valley floor. It is built of red brick, with a facing of Staffordshire blue bricks and sandstone. History Viaduct arches The double track viaduct was built during 1839-40 as part of the Midland Counties Railway line from Derby to Rugby, and was opened in June 1840, as such it is one of the UK's oldest disused railway viaducts. It was engineered by Charles Vignoles.

Biography Born in Windermere, a part of Cumberland at the time, he was one of six children of Spencer Timothy Hall, a homeopath with degrees from the University of T√ºbingen and University of Cincinnati. However, these degrees were not recognised in the UK, leaving the family in financial difficulty. Leonard left school at the age of thirteen to work delivering parcels. He undertook various jobs until he was sixteen, when he became a sailor. He travelled to the United States, and worked there for a time, including a stint as a cowboy. In the United States, Hall joined the Knights of Labor. He moved to Manchester in England in 1888, becoming leader of the local branch of the Socialist League. He worked part-time as a journalist, and part-time as the Lancashire district secretary of the Navvies, Bricklayers' Labourers and General Labourers' Union. In this role, he attempted to organise workers from a wide variety of industries. He and Tom Fox led a campaign to improve the working conditions of the navvies building the Manchester Ship Canal. Hall launched the Navvies Guide journal, and this agitation led to the formation of the Manchester Ship Canal Navvies Union.Labour Party, \\"Deaths: Tom Fox\\", Report of the Annual Conference (1934), p. 65 In 1889, he became the first general secretary of the Navvies' Union, and the union grew to 3,000 members. However, it suffered a major split in 1890, and Hall supplemented his income by working as editor of the Eccles Advertiser.Arthur Ivor Marsh, Historical Directory of Trade Unions, Vol. 5, pp. 448‚Äì449 Hall was supportive of broader labour movement initiatives. He was active on the Manchester and Salford Trades Council, and in 1892 ran a joint recruitment campaign with the Colne Valley Labour League. In 1893, he was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and became secretary of its Lancashire and Cheshire Federation. From 1894 to 1896, he served on the National Administrative Council (NAC) of the ILP. He was adopted as the party's prospective parliamentary candidate for Manchester North East at the 1895 UK general election. An opponent claimed that he was misusing union funds to support his candidature; an enquiry found that the charge was baseless, but he decided to withdraw from the election, leaving the ILP to instead stand James Johnston.Margaret 'Esipinasse and Judith Fincher Laird, Dictionary of Labour Biography (vol. 5), pp. 121‚Äì124 He was involved in the free speech campaign at Boggart Hole Clough, speaking in defiance of a ban by Manchester City Council, and for this served one month in Strangeways Prison, causing his family serious financial problems. Hall stood down as leader of the Navvies Union in 1897, and a few years later, he moved to Birmingham. He was re- elected to the ILP's NAC in 1909, as part of a left-wing group including J. M. McLachlan and Russell Smart.Duncan Tanner, Political Change and the Labour Party 1900‚Äì1918 p. 59 Concerned about the direction of the Labour Party under Ramsay MacDonald and the ILP's role in this, Hall contributed to a document entitled Let us reform the Labour Party, but generally known as the Green Manifesto.

XII, pp. 72‚Äì76 and C. T. Douthwaite, Hall and Smart were the leading ILP figures to attend the 1911 Socialist Unity conference organised by the Social Democratic Federation. This formed the British Socialist Party (BSP), and Hall joined the new party, winning election to its executive in 1912. However, disappointed at the BSP's rejection of syndicalism, he and Smart resigned in 1912.Paul Ward, Red Flag and Union Jack, p. 93 Outside the BSP, Hall founded a small syndicalist organisation in Birmingham, linked with Tom Mann's The Syndicalist journal, but it attracted only around twenty members. He later joined the Socialist Labour Party. Hall was killed in 1916 after accidentally tripping in front of a bus he meant to board on Paradise Street in front of Queen's College, Birmingham. At the inquest into his death, his daughter Nellie stated that his eyesight had been poor of late. He had been planning a trip to the United States and was on his way to get his passport signed for the journey when he was killed. He was 49.

Mythology  During the War of the Epigoni, a later myth relates, Manto was brought to Delphi as a war prize. Apollo made her his priestess and sent her to Colophon to found an oracle devoted to him.

Controversies Mojm√≠r Hampl has been a supporter of helicopter money, which he calls \\"direct support of consumption.\\" He argues that, in a deep recession accompanied by deflation, central banks should create new money and send them to households via central bank digital currency. According to Hampl, such a policy would circumvent the complicated monetary transmission mechanism inherent in the use of quantitative easing and support aggregate demand directly. His proposals were endorsed by, for example, Eric Lonergan. However, critics claim that helicopter money drops could lead to a sharp increase in inflation rates.

Career Moylan took up a teaching position in Alexandria College from which she took a break in 1895 to study for a BSc through Queen's University Galway. Moylan was the first woman student to get this degree in Ireland. The next woman to do this was Jane Stephens in 1903. Once she had the second degree, Moylan returned to Alexandra College where she remained a lecturer. She was an activist in promoting women's education.

Light on Yoga treats both forearm and hand balance forms as variants of this pose. It is a part of the headstand cycle in some yoga traditions. A similar pose, Pincha Mayurasana or Feathered Peacock pose, is a forearm balance with the body raised, giving some resemblance to a peacock's tail. Etymology and origins A similar pose, Ganda Bherundasana, which uses hand rather than forearm balance The name of this pose is from Sanskrit ‡§µ‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§ö‡§ø‡§ï vrschika, \\"scorpion\\", and ‡§Ü‡§∏‡§® ƒÅsana, \\"posture\\" or \\"seat\\". Pincha (Sanskrit ‡§™‡§ø‡§û‡•ç‡§ö Pi√±cha) means feathered. The pose is not found in medieval hatha yoga texts, but is described in 20th century manuals such as Light on Yoga. Description Pincha Mayurasana Because it requires strength, balance, and flexibility it is described as an advanced posture: Light on Yoga grades it as level 32 out of 60. In the basic pose, the body is balanced as in headstand, but the legs are bent and the back is lightly arched, and the head is lifted from the ground so the body is supported only by the forearms. A more advanced variant has the back arched further so the feet touch the top of the head. A second advanced variant has the legs held straight out horizontally above the head and arms, resembling the scorpion's tail stretched in a threat posture forwards over its body. The pose can also be executed in a variant with straight arms. Whether resting on forearms (Pincha Mayurasana) or with arms in handstand, the asana can be worked towards with the use of a chair to support the feet. Light on Yoga distinguishes Vrischikasana I (forearm balance, feet on head, plates 536 and 537) and Vrischikasana II (handstand, feet on head, plate 538), describing the second as an \\"extremely difficult\\" balance. The placing of the feet on the head is stated to indicate an attempt to subjugate the ego with its \\"deadly\\" scorpionlike emotions. Variations Pincha Mayurasana (Feathered Peacock Pose), is a forearm balance similar to Vrischikasana, but the legs are straight, stretched up over the head, with the back less extremely arched. Sayanasana (Posture of Repose) is the same as Pincha Mayurasana, but with only the elbows on the ground, the hands cradling the face, making it a difficult balance. Ganda Bherundasana (Formidable Face Pose) is similar to Pincha Mayurasana but with bent arms and only the hands on the ground; the back is lightly arched and the legs and feet point vertically upwards. It may be practised with a block under the shoulders.

The band first worked as a multimedia concept art collective but later moved to musical improvisations with a Lo-fi sound. In 2000, French composer Jean Baptiste Favory joined the group. The band has also performed under aliases, such as \\"Cacaflies\\" and \\"Chavilocos & The Butchers Filarmonika\\".  History  In 1996, three visual artists, Manuel Mathar, Gerardo Monsivais, and Jos√©-Luis Rojas, met one another at the University of Monterrey in Mexico and started playing any musical instrument that was around. They developed a series of artistic practices as a form of social interaction among friends. They developed their ideas through multiple art forms such as music, drawing, painting, photo, video, installation and performances. There is a large number of recordings of their musical improvisations using Lo-fi instruments. The band name, ‚ÄúLichis‚Äù, is a Mexican slang reference of a skinny stray dog, who fleetingly visited them one rainy night in their apartment. \\"Lichis\\" then became an aesthetic symbol, in their own idiosyncrasy, of a low and precarious form of life. Los Lichis collective showed their projects in some of the most important alternative art venues of the late '90s in Mexico (La Panader√≠a, X-Teresa Arte Actual, BF15 Gallery). Their art is an act of freedom with a strong dose of bizarre humor, playing with the role of an author, not showing up as protagonists, and letting the work develop under external and unpredictable circumstances. During their first music performances, the band was improvising for hours in a closed room, separated from the audience. This way, the group was able to keep the amusement and freshness of a private music rehearsal. Los Lichis is not a conventional band playing in local rock venues, and thus, their appearances were mostly in public cultural spaces. The relationship Los Lichis had with the former French-Mexican gallery BF 15, carried Monsiv√°is and Mathar to show their work at Paris's International Contemporary Art Fair (FIAC) in 2000. It was there that they met the experimental musician Jean-Baptiste Favory for improvisations, as part of the exhibition in their booth during the fair. They also broadcast a live performance through Epsilonia, an experimental music program ran by Favory in Radio Libertaire. Jean-Baptiste then became the fourth member, enriching the group's musical baggage. In 2003, they played at Sonic Protest festival in Paris. The first decade of the 21st century began with a progressive break in the artistic production of the group. This was in part due to the growing commitment of each member with their individual projects, but also because of the disappointment and boredom they felt about the contemporary art circuit. Despite this, and a temporary recess of Jose- Luis, their musical practice continued giving birth to more complex experiments. This was reinforced with the collaboration of guitarist Alfonso Guti√©rrez (1974 ‚Äì 2007), drummer Gildardo Gonzalez, and graphic artist Sergio de Osio. In Osio's workshop, many Lichis‚Äô flyers, posters, T-shirts, and CDs were printed. Occasionally, they appeared under different names, such as \\"Cacaflies\\" or \\"Chavilocos & The Butchers Filarmonika\\". The band varied in a wide range of influences including psychedelic, krautrock, punk, avant-garde, free-jazz, folk or electronic music. By the end of 2009, they returned to the original line-up, reincorporating Jose-Luis Rojas (1975 - 2017) and working on a compilation project on their own that concluded in the summer of 2013 with a double LP 12\\" Dog, compounding the first ten years of the group in 90 minutes. In 2015, they released a new limited edition CD entitled \\"The Giant Lichis\\". Both of these albums have been positively reviewed by music critic Byron Coley in British Magazine, The Wire. Also in 2015, the U.S. based label Feeding Tube Records, owned by Coley, re-released 500 copies of ‚ÄúDog‚Äù distributed worldwide by Forced Exposure. Los Lichis is regarded as one of the most important underground acts in Mexico. ‚ÄúTwenty years and Los Lichis are there, they appear and disappear, but when they let out the sound trail from their instruments, they surely leave their mark.‚Äù Mexican music critic, David Cort√©s states. \\"Los Lichis retain that naturalistic spark and simmering wildness that only the best improvised music can provide.\\" wrote Robert Ham of Pitchfork magazine.

It is found in Sumatra, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. It is a major pest on Elaeis guineensis, the African oil palm. Description The moth completes a mean life time of 90 days. After the female lays 200‚Äì300 yellowish eggs, a single egg mass can become about 140‚Äì210 neonates. The larva has a portable case which it carries around as it feeds. The first instar is about 1 mm long. About an hour after emergence from the case, the larva starts to construct a small case around the posterior of their body using oil palm leaves. This constructed case is cone shaped. The case enlarges with each instar. At the fourth instar, the case is covered with loosely-attached large round or rectangular leaf pieces. At the sixth instar, the case surface is smooth and without loose leaf pieces. The larva turns whitish gray. It takes a mean of 71.5 days to reach the sixth instar. Early instar stages are brownish. Dark patches are found all over the head and thorax. The body is completely covered by sensory setae. Convex shaped stemmata are well differentiated and cover the sides of the head laterally. Thorax is immediately behind the head and comprised three true leg pairs with hooks. Abdomen comprised five pairs of prolegs. Fully grown pupa is 6.1 mm long. Male and female pupal cases are different in color. Male pupa has a big blackish head, whereas female with creamy yellowish head. Generally females pupate away from the host. Adults show strong sexual dimorphism. The adult female is wingless and legless. Head dark brown. Body yellowish brown. Average size is 5.5 mm. The male has a wingspan of 10‚Äì12 mm. Wings smoky brown and body is hairy black. Head chubby. Antennae feathery bipectinate (comb like on both sides). During mating, the male cuts the distal end (lower end) of the case of the female. After laying a large clutch of eggs in her case, the female leaves the case and dies a few hours later. The adult male may live 3 to 4 days. =Timeline= * Average life span from egg to adult: 90 days * 1st instar: 9‚Äì16 days * 2nd instar: 16‚Äì17 days * 3rd instar: 16‚Äì18 days * 4th instar: 10‚Äì15 days * 5th instar: 12‚Äì16 days * Average life span from 1st instar to 5th instar: 71.5 days * Pupation: 8‚Äì12 days Ecology and control It is an important pest of oil palms. Larval outbreaks have been observed from Malaysian oil palm plantations from late 1950s to early 1960s. Applying chemical insecticides is the fastest and most effective method to control the pest, even though that causes environmental problems. A knapsack sprayer is used to spray insecticides from the ground. Chemicals such as trichlorfon and chlorpyrifos, cypermethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin can be applied as soil drenches. Chlorantraniliprole and indoxacarb are highly effective. Biological predators such as Brachymeria carinata, Buysmania oxymora, Goryphus bunoh, Eupelmus cotoxanthae, Dolichogenidea metesae, Pediobius anomalus, Pediobius imbreus and Bacillus thuringiensis are known to be effective. Use of Apanteles metesae, Cosmelestes picticeps are also effective measures. Entomopathogenic fungi such as Paecilomyces fumosoroseus and Metarhizium anisopliae show effective results under laboratory conditions, but field observations should be carried out.

K. S. Iyengar, first published in English. It describes more than 200 yoga postures or asanas, and is illustrated with some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar demonstrating these. The book has been described as the bible of modern yoga, and its presentation of the asanas has been called \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"encyclopedic\\". It has been translated into at least 23 languages and has sold over three million copies. Context The violinist Yehudi Menuhin invited Iyengar to teach in Europe. Yoga is a group of physical, mental, and spiritual practices from ancient India, forming one of the six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophical traditions. In the Western world, however, yoga is often taken to mean a modern form of medieval Hatha yoga, practised mainly for exercise, consisting largely of the postures called asanas. B. K. S. Iyengar (1918-2014) was born in a poor family of Brahmins in Karnataka, India. In childhood he suffered from diseases including typhoid, malaria and tuberculosis, and became extremely stiff. At the age of 18 he decided to spend his life doing yoga, and by 1938 he was already performing the asanas fluently. The violinist Yehudi Menuhin became his pupil in 1952 and then invited him to teach in Europe, which he did from the 1960s. Iyengar made yoga popular, first in India and then around the world. Book=Publication= Light on Yoga was first published in English by George Allen and Unwin in 1966, with a foreword by his pupil, the violinist Yehudi Menuhin. Revised editions were brought out in 1968 and 1976. A paperback edition was published by The Aquarian Press in 1991 under the Thorsons imprint. The book became an international best-seller; it has been translated into at least 23 languages including Chinese, Czech, Hebrew, Japanese, Hungarian, Portuguese, Russian, and Thai and has sold over three million copies. =Contents= Utthita Trikonasana, the extended triangle pose, an innovation basic to Iyengar Yoga. A yoga brick, another of Iyengar's innovations, is helping to ensure correct alignment. The book has three parts, a technical introduction to yoga, in which hatha yoga is explained to be one of the eight limbs of yoga; a detailed illustrated description of the asanas (some 200 postures, illustrated by some 600 monochrome photographs of Iyengar), followed by a brief account of the bandhas and kriyas; and an account of pranayama, yoga breathing. An appendix defines a set of asana courses, i.e. which postures to do each week, building up in difficulty, in courses structured to last up to 300 weeks. A second appendix defines the asanas supposed to be \\"curative\\" for a range of diseases and conditions from \\"Acidity\\" to \\"Varicose Veins\\". The book has a glossary of all the Sanskrit terms employed. =Approach= Each asana is named in Sanskrit with its etymology, graded, and described separately with two or more pages of text and monochrome photographs of Iyengar. For example, Utthita Trikonasana, the extended triangle pose, is stated to be at grade 3 out of a possible 60 in terms of difficulty. The technique for going into the triangle pose, performing it, and returning from it, is described in eight steps. The technique is written as a set of instructions, such as \\"Inhale deeply and with a jump spread apart the legs sideways 3 to 3¬Ω feet\\". Its claimed effects on the muscles and body are described in a concluding paragraph. The three photographs show Iyengar in a preparatory pose and then in the triangle pose itself from front and rear. =Illustrations= Unprecedented: page with four illustrations, showing the positioning, size, and style of the images, and the degree of attention given to a single pose, here Mulabandhasana The scholar- practitioner Norman Sjoman notes that Light on Yoga served to popularise the practice of asanas more than any previous book for three reasons, namely the large number of asanas illustrated, the \\"clear no-nonsense descriptions, and the obvious refinement of the illustrations.\\" The approximately 600 illustrations of the 200 asanas are all monochrome photographs (though many paperback editions have a later colour photograph on the cover). Within the confines of a conventionally sized book, the photographs are never more than about by . All are of Iyengar, dressed only in a pair of briefs and a necklace string. The images are sometimes shown three (e.g. for Koundinyasana) or four (e.g. for Mulabandhasana) to a page, generally and in those cases illustrating a single asana. The degree of attention to detail in the illustrations may be understood from the coverage of one asana, Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand), which is illustrated with 15 photographs of the main pose, and 37 more of the \\"Sarvangasana cycle\\". Reception Light on Yoga has become known as the \\"bible\\" of yoga; Publishers Weekly wrote that it \\"set the standard\\" for books about yoga, with instructions and illustrations of the poses. The yoga scholar Mark Singleton, writing in Yoga Journal, called the presentation of the asanas \\"unprecedented\\" and \\"encyclopedic\\", describing Light on Yoga as \\"the most influential do-it-yourself yoga book of all time\\". Yehudi Menuhin, in his foreword to the book, wrote that \\"Whoever has had the privilege of receiving Mr Iyengar's attention, or of witnessing the precision, refinement and beauty of his art, is introduced to that vision of perfection and innocence which is man as first created ‚Äî unarmed, unashamed, son of God, lord of creation ‚Äî in the Garden of Eden\\". The scholar of religion Andrea Jain observes that the book \\"prescribed a thoroughly individualistic system of postural yoga\\", one that was \\"rigorous and disciplined\\", requiring \\"belts, bricks, and ropes\\". She quotes Elizabeth De Michelis as writing that it \\"instantly became the global standard reference on modern yoga as a body practice.\\" Jain argues that Light on Yoga had the particular attraction for a consumer audience that its clear stepwise instructions enabled them to practice at home, and to read about the \\"biomedical explanations of each posture and its fitness and health benefits.\\" Jain notes also that the book built up the Iyengar Yoga brand by claiming a connection to the ancient tradition of yoga as far back as Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, for instance with the epigraphic prayer to Patanjali at the front of the book. Michelle Goldberg, in The New Yorker, states that the book \\"remains unparallelled as a guide to asana practice\\", and quotes Yoga Journal as saying \\"when 'teachers refer to the correct way to do a posture, they're usually alluding to the alignment Mr. Iyengar instructs and expertly models in his book.'\\" She notes that while Iyengar attributes the asanas to Patanjali's Yoga Sutras, he was being \\"too modest. It was he, not any ancient sage, who figured out how to show people the world over the safest way to stand on their heads.\\" For example, she explains, the triangle pose and the sun salutation \\"don't appear in any ancient yogic text\\" but were put together into a method by Iyengar's brother-in-law and first teacher, Krishnamacharya. Derek Beres, writing in Big Think, called the book \\"wildly popular\\" and \\"essentially the bible for yoga practitioners.\\" He describes some of the science that Iyengar claims for yoga as suspect: \\"Iyengar had a habit of calling things proven even though no actual scientific research had been conducted.\\" Beres tried Iyengar yoga alongside the \\"more aerobic Vinyasa\\" style, and \\"always appreciated [Iyengar yoga's] anatomical focus and the emphasis on breath before anything else.\\" The yoga teacher Bernie Gourley notes the book's strengths, the asanas \\"with his perfect alignment\\", but also that the book does not \\"systematically address contraindications\\" to each asana, nor does it provide evidence for the claimed benefits. The Light on Yoga project by the yoga teacher Jack Cuneo and the photographer Rick Cummings has attempted to photograph all the yoga poses in the book, to be followed by restating all the instructions in Cuneo's own words.

Early life LaRoche was the eldest son of Peter Crothaire (afterwards LaRoche), a Huguenot of Bordeaux, the barber of Queen Anne's husband Prince George of Denmark. He was admitted at the Middle Temple on 12 September 1717 and at Queen's College, Cambridge on 28 October 1717. He married before 1731, Elizabeth Garnier, the daughter of Isaac Garnier of St. James‚Äôs, Westminster, apothecary to the army. Career LaRoche worked initially as a steward for the Robartes family, who had a controlling interest in the Bodmin Parliamentary seat. He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as Bodmin at a by-election in June 1725, but was returned as Whig Member of Parliament for Bodmin at another by-election on 31 January 1727. He was returned again shortly after at the 1727 British general election. He regularly voted with the Administration except against the Hessians in 1730. In 1732 he became one of the original trustees, as listed in the charter, for the newly formed colony of Georgia on the east coast of America. He was also an assistant at the Royal Africa Company from 1732 to 1746. He progressively built up a strong electoral interest of his own in the corporation of Bodmin. He was returned again for Bodmin at the 1734 British general election. One of his recorded speeches was made on 15 April 1736 in favour of a bill designed to check the alienation of lands to charities, while others were made on 4 February 1740 and 21 January 1741 in defence of the trustees of the board of Georgia.

Biography Ewald Auguste Esselen was born in Worcester in the Cape Colony in 1858. His father was L.F. Esselen and his family was descended from Rhenish missionaries. After finishing school, Ewald studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He returned to South Africa in 1881 during the First Boer War (1880-1881) where he served as private secretary for the then vice-president Paul Kruger. In this capacity he assisted Kruger during the Pretoria Convention which was negotiated in Newcastle in the Colony of Natal. Following the peace he returned, on Kruger's advice, to Europe to continue his studies, this time studying law at the Inner Temple in London where he qualified as barrister. Between 1883-1884, he served as secretary of the Boer delegation to the London Convention which superseded the earlier Pretoria Convention. After his return to South Africa he was admitted to the bar in Cape Town in 1885. In 1886, he was elected a member of the legislative assembly for Richmond in the Cape Colony. In 1887, he accepted the position of judge to the criminal court of the South African Republic which had been offered to him by Kruger the previous year. He held this position until 1890, when he resigned due to personal reasons and became a barrister in Pretoria. He would later become a member of the Volksraad of the South African Republic, serving first in the lower chamber, and in 1893 in the upper chamber. In 1894, he was appointed to the position of State Attorney of the South African Republic but resigned after one year and returned to private practice. In 1900, he was made prisoner of war during the South African War (1899-1902), but was released on parole to go to Europe. He returned to the now Transvaal Colony in 1902 and resumed his practice. After the war he maintained an active interest in politics, becoming one of the founders the Het Volk party which advocated for self-government. Ewald Esselen died in 1918 at Sea Point in Cape Town and is buried in the Ou Begrafplaas in Pretoria.

Maharashtra Rationalist Association was an organisation dedicated to spreading rationalism and humanism in Maharashtra, India, and was an integral part of the rationalist movement in Maharashtra. The organisation is succeeded by Mumbai Rationalist Association, which in turn has paved the way for Sapiens Foundation. History The Maharashtra Rationalist Association was an offshoot of the broad social and religious reformation movement in Maharashtra which traces its origin to the nineteenth century in the thoughts and actions of Jyotiba Phule and Gopal Ganesh Agarkar. Shahu Maharaj, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ramaswami Naicker, B.R. Ambedkar, M.N. Roy, Goparaju Ramachandra Rao ‚ÄòGora‚Äô and Sahodaran Ayyappan moulded the rationalist mode of thinking in India in the 20th century. Among the first rationalist organisations in India were Rationalist Association of India which was set up in 1930, and Yukthivadi Sangham which was registered in 1935. The Atheist Centre launched by Mahatma Gandhi's follower Goparaju Ramachandra Rao \\"Gora\\" in Andhra Pradesh in 1940, and the Indian Rationalist Association (IRA) set up in Chennai with R.P. Paranjpye as founding president were among the other important organisations in the Indian rationalist movement. Maharashtra Rationalist Association was one of the first rationalist organisations in Maharashtra. It was headed by noted personalities like Justice Raghavendra A. Jahagirdar, a retired judge of the Bombay High Court who passed several landmark judgments. Yahya A. Lokhandwala, who also served as the president of Indian Rationalist Association, and Rajeev Joshi were other prominent leaders of Maharashtra Rationalist Association. Lokhandwala wrote about rationalist activities in India in international publications like American Atheist Magazine. Maharashtra Rationalist Association was the fulcrum of organised rationalism in the state. It played a pivotal role in mobilising support for irreligion in India well into the 1980s. Activists of Maharashtra Rationalist Association and two other organisations demonstrated on Tuesday, 12 May 1981 against self- styled godman Sathya Sai Baba and against the participation of O.P. Mehra, the Governor of the secular state of Maharashtra, in a religious function at Dharmakshetra, Mumbai. They shouted slogans such as \\"Sai Baba is a trickster!\\" The activists were arrested and taken to police station. The next day, the Governor invited Lokhandwala to his official residence and expressed regret for the arrest and the misbehaviour of his staff. The event received wide publicity in the media and cemented Maharashtra Rationalist Association's position as a formidable force in the renaissance movement in Maharashtra. Bombay Rationalist Association (BRA), which worked among the Malayali emigrants in Mumbai, merged into Maharashtra Rationalist Association. The Association was very active during the period before the rationalist movement split into several organisations like All India Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti, Maharashtra Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti and, very recently, \\"We, the Brights.\\" Maharashtra Rationalist Association became inactive over time for unspecified reasons. Current status Maharashtra Rationalist Association is the predecessor of Mumbai Rationalist Association, which has since paved the way for Sapiens Foundation in order to broadbase its scope into a wide range of activities such as environmentalism, LGBT rights and human rights. Sapiens Foundation is a registered non-profit organisation affiliated to Humanist International, London, and Atheist Alliance International, Washington, D.C., which have special consultative status at the United Nations. The organisation conducts events and runs campaigns under the better known banner We The Sapiens, and is headed by its Chief Executive Manoj John, who is also the Development Director of Atheist Alliance International.

The model consists of two pairs of users communicating through a shared channel. The problem of interference between two mobile users in close proximity or crosstalk between two parallel landlines are two examples where this model is applicable. Unlike in the point-to-point channel, where the amount of information that can be sent through the channel is limited by the noise that distorts the transmitted signal, in the interference channel, it is mainly the signal from the other user that hinders the communication. However, the transmitted signals are not purely random (otherwise they would not be decodable), and, therefore, the users can reduce the effect of the interference by decoding the undesired signal.  Discrete memoryless interference channel  The mathematical model for this channel is the following: Interference channel model where, for i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,2\\\\\\\\}: * W_i is the message to be transmitted by user i; * X_i is the channel input symbol (X_i^n is a sequence of n symbols) of user i; * Y_i is the channel output symbol (Y_i^n is a sequence of n symbols) of user i; * \\\\hat{W}_i is the estimate of the transmitted message by user i; and * p(y_1,y_2x_1,x_2) is the noisy memoryless channel, which is modeled by a conditional probability distribution. The capacity of this channel model is not known in general; only for special cases of p(y_1,y_2x_1,x_2) the capacity has been calculated, e.g., in the case of strong interference or deterministic channels.

A supporter of equal rights for women, she was an elected member of the Reichstag from 1920 to 1933. After joining her SPD colleagues in fruitlessly opposing the Enabling Act, which established rule by the Nazi regime in March 1933, she was driven to despair and committed suicide the following June. Biography Born on 14 December 1877 in Metz, Antonie Pf√ºlf was the daughter of the army officer Emil Pf√ºlf and Justine Stroehlein. Against the wishes of her parents, after spending her childhood in Metz, she attended a teacher training establishment in Munich. On receiving her diploma, she taught in Upper Bavaria and from 1910 to 1919 in Munich. While working as a teacher, she undertook volunteer work for orphaned children while calling for educational support for working-class children. As a result, she became a well-known figure in Bavaria.

The Award for Best Novel was first awarded in 1982 as the Award for Best Outstanding Work and is two awards, one granted to an English-language work and one to a French-language work. Until 1989 it was dedicated to any works, including non-novel length works. It became a dedicated category in 1989 as the Award for Best Long Form (French: Meilleur Livre). It became the Award for Best Novel (French: Meilleur Roman) in 2011, when the Prix Aurora and Prix Boreal combined. No winner was awarded in 1983 and 1986, but shortlists were created. Robert J.

Biography  Charles Johann Palmi√© was born on October 22, 1863 in Aschersleben, Germany. He was first trained from the age of 14 as a decorative painter under the court theater decoration painter Rieck in Dresden. Palmie then spent two years at the Dresden Academy of Fine Arts. At age 20 in 1883 he received his first large commission work from today's Leonhardi Museum in Dresden, then owned by the painter Eduard Leonhardi, to do a rich colorful painting renovation in the romanticed style of the 19th century . In 1884 Palmi√© moves from Dresden to Munich, where he completes his artistic education as a student of August Fink. In 1886 he marries the flower painter Marie Kapferer as he is now able to derive his fully time income from being an independent artist having built his reputation by being represented with work at an important exhibition in the new Munich Glass Palace (Glaspalast, Munich). Palmie travelled to paint, first he made regular trips to the Alps, then since the 1890s also made regular painting trips to the plains of the Altm√ºhltal, the W√∂rnitz and the Danube, which inspired the artist to mostly large-scale paintings in the neo- impressionist style . Later he would travel to France. 1901 Palmie opens an Inn, run by his wife, to cater to painters in Kallmunz Germany. Palmi√© called Kallm√ºnz, on the Naab River, the \\"pearl of the Naabtal\\". Soon the artist colony numbers 38 painters with many settling permanently. Kallm√ºnz became best known through Wassily Kandinsky's and Gabriele M√ºnter's stay in the summer of 1903. Falling under the influence of Claude Monet in 1891 Palmie spent the summer of 1906 painting in Giverny France where he heightened his ability to capture shimmering light and atmosphere, taking a further step toward abstraction in art. In 1909 Palmi√©, together with Wassily Kandinsky, Alexei Jawlensky, Gabriele M√ºnter and others, becomes one of the founding members of the Neue K√ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen, (Wassily Kandinsky was the Chairman which later became Der Blaue Reiter). Palmie resigns before the first NKVM exhibition in the winter of 1909 because of artistic differences. Two years later, Charles Palmi√© dies of a sudden stroke on July 15, 1911 in Munich. :de:Charles Johann Palmi√© http://www.charles-johann-palmie.com/ http://www.kettererkunst.de/bio/CharlesJohannPalmie-1863-1911.php http://www.kallmuenz.de/tourismus/kunst-und-kuenstler/kunst-persoenlichkeiten- der-geschichte/prof-palmi√©-charles-johann/ http://www.kettererkunst.de/kunst/kd/details.php?obnr=118000128&anummer;=465&detail;=1 References 1863 births 1911 deaths German Impressionist painters 20th-century German painters 19th- century German painters ","title":"Charles Johann Palmi√©"},{"id":"59053189","text":"Uladzimir Ignatik was the defending champion but lost in the second round to Ugo Humbert.

It opened in 1792 and was owned and run by five generations of members of the Newington family until 1970. In 2000, the hospital name changed from Ticehurst House Hospital to The Priory Ticehurst House when it became part of the Priory Group.  Early years  Samuel Newington opened a small hospital in Ticehurst, Sussex, in 1792. At first, it housed around twenty patients and admitted both poor and wealthy patients. In 1812, Charles Newington built himself a house in the grounds. Two of his sons, Charles and Jesse, were surgeons and worked in and later ran the asylum when their father died. They employed demobilised Battle of Waterloo veterans to landscape the area surrounding the buildings. A prospectus for the asylum was produced to show off its facilities in 1830. From 1838, only private patients were admitted and patients came from increasingly privileged backgrounds over time; by the 1850s they were 'exceptionally wealthy'. By the 1870s, Ticehurst was considered one of the most successful and well-regarded private asylums, and by 1900 the site covered over 125 hectares. During the 1870s, Herman Charles Merivale was a resident of Ticehurst House Hospital. He wrote of his experiences there in a book called My Experiences in a Lunatic Asylum by a Sane Person.  Priory Hospital Ticehurst  Today, the hospital offers day care, outpatient, and residential treatment.  Legacy of the former private hospital  The Ticehurst records are unusually well-preserved; many private asylum archives have been lost, but the archive of Ticehurst covers the dates 1787-1975. An analysis of records of more than 600 Ticehurst patients found that more than 80% of patients appeared to have symptoms that would be indicative of modern psychiatric illnesses, particularly schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder . Another analysis argued that these conditions therefore have robust validity over time.

Plot The series follows John Parlour (Simm), a loanshark who strikes up a friendship with one of clients, single mum Jo Weller (Okonedo), and decides to leave his past behind and open a credit union to help his former clients out of debt; but his former bosses, who strongly disapprove of the idea, try everything to prevent his business from becoming a success. Production Marchant's original notion for the series was not to write about poverty, but to produce something that tackled the modern idea of benign entrepreneurs. 'In a curious kind of way, Richard Branson was the starting point. I was interested in this idea of could businesses be ethical? What exactly was the bottom line?' 'It seemed quite timely to explore the difference between setting things up that are supposed to be for the social good but in turn the conflict between that and the need to be a financially successful entity.' Reception The series broadcast over two consecutive nights, with the concluding episode following on 6 November 2000. The first episode drew 2.18 million viewers. The series has yet to be released on DVD, but is available to watch on Channel 4's on-demand service All4. The Bella Review gave the series a positive review, writing: \\"Never Never, a story written by acclaimed playwright Tony Marchant, is essentially about good people doing bad things and vice versa. It's free from any sort of class judgement that might put you off, elegantly letting people be people. Good tension throughout is created by the \\"will John become a good person with morals and stuff\\" question ‚Äì which is, as it should, left unanswered.\\" They continued; \\"There's also great acting, supported by the good writing, allowing for heaps of emotions left unspoken yet blatantly obviously present. Even if the narrative is sometimes predictable to seasoned fiction readers and viewers, this production is essentially too in-your-face-honest and charming to disagree with it. That, and John Simm is just a bit too good to do anything wrong.\\" Cast * John Simm as John Parlour * Sophie Okonedo as Jo Weller * Adam Kotz as Martin * Ruth Sheen as Sandra * Ellen Thomas as Brenda * Ashley Walters as Lee * Gerard Horan as Dave Bell * Michael J.

When John H. Longnecker combined his pro-Union paper, the Baltimore County American, with the Baltimore County Advocate to create The Baltimore County Union, he placed his sons Henry and John in charge of the new weekly. Its inaugural issue claimed that it had the \\"largest circulation of any county paper in the State.\\" The publication's main competitor in Towsontown was the Maryland Journal, a Democratic paper run by William H. Ruby. Henry C. and John B. Longnecker, along with a schoolteacher named L.M. Haverstick, ran the paper for a few years before Haverstick's departure, after which they acquired full ownership of the publication. John died on March 1, 1909, and Henry consolidated the paper with the Towson News a few months later, forming the Union News and eventually retiring soon after. The new publication operated out of the old Towson News offices, a large two-story building located in Towson. The Baltimore County Union was openly supportive of the Republican party and endorsed its candidates at local, state, and national levels. During the early 1870s, the paper wrote extensively about the passage of the 15th Constitutional Amendment, an example of the publication's dedication to covering civil rights issues as well as a reflection of the significant local population of African Americans.

Biography  Born to a Corsican family originating from the village of Aull√®ne, Pierre Dominique studied medicine in Ajaccio, going on to practice a medical career first in Sart√®ne, then the psychiatric hospital of Sainte Anne d'Auray (Paris). His two years as a military doctor on the Eastern Front during the First World War earned him a Legion of Honour.\\"Le Prix Balzac\\", L'Europe Nouvelle, 29 Mar. 1924, p412. After the war he published as an author, winning the 1924 Priz de Balzac for his Notre Dame de la Sagesse and the 1930 award from the Soci√©t√© des gens de lettres.Mercure de France, 1930, p.759 He began work as a journalist for various Parisian newspapers, reporting on some of the revolutions convulsing postwar Europe: Italy, Poland, Russia and Spain. During the 1920s his political loyalties evolved from French nationalism to Corsican separatism to Radical-socialism. Between 1920 and 1922, he was the head of the Corsican federation of Charles Maurras's hardline French nationalist movement, Action fran√ßaise. He then passed over to A Muvra, flagship of Petru Rocca's Corsican regionalist movement, a cause with which he was involved throughout the interwar: he participated in the Corsican Action Party from its foundation in 1922 until 1926, sitting on its Executive Committee, as well as co- organising the Estates-General of Corsica in 1934. Between 1926 and 1940 Pierre Dominique's chief political involvement was with the French Radical- Socialist Party (PRRRS), the centre-left Radical party that dominated the Third Republic. In 1926 he founded his own centre-left journal, Le Petit- Phare, politically close to the left-wing of the republican movement. This brought him into the orbit of the Young Turk Radicals led by Gaston Bergery and √âdouard Daladier, a pressure group that sought a greater social and economic direction from the Radical-Socialist Party. From 1929 until the Second World War Pierre Dominique was editor-in-chief for the PRRRS's semi- official organ, La R√©publique. By 1932 he sat on the party's national committee. Once the Great Depression arrived, Pierre Dominique called for a far-reaching economic renovation by mobilising the resources of the French empire, strengthening the power of the executive over parliamentary institutions, and greater coordination at European level. Although initially supporting the Popular Front he was fiercely opposed to the participation of the Communist Party, and after the general strikes of 1936 he was one of the main voices advocating that the PRRRS pursue an alliance with the liberal centre-right. In 1935, he was described as a comrade-in-arms by the French League against Racism and Antisemitism,Bernard Lecache, \\"Le droit de vivre devient hebdomadaire\\", Revue le droit de vivre. October 1935; and in La R√©publique in 1938 he vehemently denounced Nazi racism: \\"Germany seeks to conquer the world, but the world is watching and is repulsed by this horrifying descent into the heart of barbarism.\\"Pierre Dominique, \\"La France n'est pas un tir aux ambassadeurs\\". La R√©publique, 9 Nov. 1938. But over the course of the 1930s, he drifted towards the authoritarian right. In 1941, after the Fall of France, he was put in charge of first the Vichy Regime's press censorship bureau, then its French Office of Information (1941‚Äì43),La Croix 27 Dec. 1940; Robert O.

The story centres on a French bar-keeper, who is saved from a bigamous marriage to an aristocratic young local by the intervention of his real wife, with the aid of champagne and French sailors. It is set in China to appeal to the 1860s French fashion for Chinoiserie. The opera was first produced at the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ath√©n√©e, Paris, on 11 April 1868. It was Lecocq's first substantial success and ran for an entire season. It was revived several times in its first three years. Background and first performances Lecocq enjoyed an early success in 1856, when he and Georges Bizet shared the first prize in a competition for composers of comic opera, organised by Jacques Offenbach. Lacking the connections to secure commissions from Parisian theatres, Lecocq spent the next decade in obscurity and routine work as a teacher, accompanist and r√©p√©titeur. His luck changed in 1867 when William Busnach, manager of the Th√©√¢tre de l'Ath√©n√©e engaged him. His first two-act work, L'amour et son carquois, presented in January 1868, was a modest success, and Busnach commissioned a three-act piece, teaming Lecocq with the established duo of librettists, Alfred Duru and Henri Chivot.

His daughter, Fleur-de-Th√©, has begged permission to accompany him, but this being contrary to Chinese custom, he has refused to take her. She has determined to go by herself and has sent for a palanquin. The bearers, frightened by some unusual noise, abandon her, leaving her alone in the street. She takes refuge in the nearest building, which is a cantine fran√ßaise ‚Äì a bar for sailors and locals ‚Äì run by Pinsonnet and his wife C√©sarine. Pinsonnet, rather taken with her beauty, promises Fleur-de-Th√© his protection. Alarmed by the approach of her father, who happens to stray into the place, she conceals herself in the next room. She is discovered there by the jealous C√©sarine, who immediately hands her over to her father. Tien-Tien, in accordance with local custom, announces that when an unmarried Chinese woman is seen by a stranger, he must marry her, or be executed. Pinsonnet is arrested. =Act 2= Tien-Tien's residence Pinsonnet is given the alternative of marrying or being impaled. He states that he is already married, but that makes no difference to the Chinese, who consider a French marriage no marriage, and he consents, not very reluctantly, to be a Chinese bridegroom. He is accordingly raised to the rank of a mandarin to bring him to suitable status for marriage to Tien-Tien's daughter. This is much resented by her former fianc√©, the swaggering soldier Ka-o-Lin. At this point C√©sarine arrives to deliver some wine ordered by Tien-Tien. She is astonished to find her husband thoroughly at home in the house of Tien-tien, and married to his daughter. She is indignant, but is pleased to find that Fleur-de-Th√© hates the situation as much as she does. They agree that Fleur- de-Th√© will elope with Ka-o-Lin, and C√©sarine, concealed by the bridal veil, will impersonate the bride. The elopement fails, as all doors are strictly guarded. =Act 3= The Blue Kiosk ‚Äì a small pavilion Pinsonnet tries to persuade his wife to remain as an extra or subordinate wife: such things, he says, are common in China, as witness Tien-Tien's twelve wives. C√©sarine pretends to comply, and, together with Fleur-de-Th√©, torments him until he is disillusioned with double matrimony. Tien-Tien discovers the trick played by C√©sarine, and, in a fury, condemns Pinsonnet to the stake. C√©sarine uses champagne as a weapon, plying Tien-Tien with Veuve Clicquot, and the Pinsonnets are rescued by sailors from the French ship at the quayside and carried off to safety.

She was named as one of 2019 Science Forbes 30 Under 30 for her work developing algorithms for classical computers to perform calculations that were previously deemed only possible with quantum computers, research that began under the supervision of Scott Aaronson when Tang was only a teenager.  Early life  Tang skipped the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in order to enroll at the University of Texas at Austin at the age of 14. Tang's first experience of research involved working on in vivo imaging for biomedical research such as optical probes to view polarised macrophages during foreign body reactions, bacterial infection, fibrin deposition, and real-time detection of neutrophil responses. In 2014 Tang was awarded an Davidson Fellow Honorable Mention for her work on an optical imaging probe for real-time detection of infection. In 2017 she took a class on quantum information taught by Scott Aaronson, who would soon become her dissertation adviser. Aaronson recognised Tang as an \\"unusually talented student\\" and presented her with a range of research projects to choose from; among them was the recommendation problem.  Research  Before Tang's work, the best known classical algorithms solving some linear algebra problems were exponentially slower, under some assumptions, than the best quantum algorithm for the same problem. Inspired by the quantum solution, based on the HHL algorithm, she found classical algorithms solving these problem in a similar time as the quantum algorithms, under similar assumptions, thus \\"dequantizing\\" them and exponentially improving over the best known classical algorithms. Her first work in quantum computing was her 2018 thesis dissertation titled A quantum- inspired classical algorithm for recommendation systems, supervised by Scott Aaronson, allowing her to complete two undergraduate degrees in computer science and in pure mathematics from the UT Austin. This work details a new algorithm that solves the recommendation problem; for example, how does Amazon or Netflix predict which books or movies a specific consumer will personally enjoy? A linear algebraic approach of the problem is the following: given m users, and n products, alongside incomplete data about which products the users prefer (organised in a binary tree data structure) where there are not too many ways the users can vary their preferences (called low-rank matrices), what are the products that a given user may want to buy? A common linear algebraic classical strategy to solve this problem is to reconstruct an approximation of the full preference matrix and use it to predict the next preferred product. Such a strategy uses at least a time polynomial in the matrix dimension. In 2016, Iordanis Kerenidis and Anupam Prakash, found an exponentially faster quantum algorithm; this algorithm uses the HHL algorithm to sample the product directly from an approximation of the preference matrix without reconstructing the matrix itself, thus avoiding the polynomial limit mentioned above. Tang's classical algorithm, inspired by the fast quantum algorithm of Kerenidis and Prakash, is able to perform the same calculations but on a normal computer without the need for quantum machine learning. Both approaches run in polylogarithmic time which means the total computation time scales with the logarithm of the problem variables such as the total number of products and users, except Tang utilises a classical replication of the quantum sampling techniques. Prior to Tang's results, it was widely assumed that no fast classical algorithm existed; Kerenidis and Prakash did not attempt to study the classical solution, and the task assigned to Tang by Aaronson was to prove its nonexistence. As he said, \\"that seemed to me like an important 't' to cross to complete this story\\". Before Tang's research was made public, she and Aaronson attended a quantum computing workshop at the University of California where Tang presented in front of an audience that included Kerenidis and Prakash on June 18 and 19 2018. After four hours of questioning, the consensus was that Tang's classical algorithm seemed correct. The recommendation problem was one of a handful of projects offered by Aaronson, which was chosen reluctantly by Tang: \\"I was hesitant because it seemed like a hard problem when I looked at it, but it was the easiest of the problems he gave me\\". In 2018 Tang was named as a University of Texas at Austin Dean's Honored Graduate in computer science, having maintained a 4.0 grade-point average. In the same year, Tang began her Ph.D. in theoretical computer science at the University of Washington under the supervision of James Lee. She pursued her research and generalized the above result, dequantizing other quantum machine learning HHL-based problems: principal component analysis and low-rank stochastic regression.  Media coverage  There was wide media coverage in response to Tang's work on using classical computing rather than quantum computing to tackle the recommendation problem, due to the perception that it eliminates one of the best examples of quantum speedup. Some researchers came to the defence of quantum computing, such as Robert Young (Director of the University of Lancaster's Quantum Technology Centre), who said in a BBC news article, \\"If we hadn't invested in quantum computing, the quantum algorithm that inspired [Ms] Tang wouldn't have existed\\". Tang herself notes the divisive nature of comparing classical to quantum algorithms, and the trepidation of proving her algorithm to her adviser, \\"I started believing there is a fast classical algorithm, but I couldn‚Äôt really prove it to myself because Scott [Aaronson] seemed to think there wasn‚Äôt one, and he was the authority\\". At the age of 18, Tang was named as one of Forbes 30 Under 30 for 2019 due to her work in developing computing methods that allow classical computers to handle tasks previously deemed only possible with a quantum computer.

All three sieges failed, and thus the Mughal Empire was unable to retake control of Kandahar from the Safavids.  History = Background = In the mid 17th-century, rising tensions between the Safavid Empire and the Mughal Empire led to a number of territorial disputes in Afghanistan. Control of Afghanistan was centered around two key cities, Kabul and Kandahar; by the 1630s the Mughals were in control of Kabul, while the Safavid's controlled Kandahar.Kohn, George C. (2007). Dictionary of wars. Infobase Publishing. . A major development came in 1638 when the Safavid governor of Kandahar, Ali Mardan Khan, betrayed the Safavids and gave control of the city over to the Mughals. This event provoked further tensions between the two empires. In 1647, a Mughal attempt to conquer Badakhshan ended in failure.Chandra, Satish (2005). Medieval India: from Sultanat to the Mughals. II. Har-Anand Publications. . pp. 226 Seizing on the weakness of its rival, the Safavid Empire invaded the Mughal-controlled parts of Afghanistan in early 1649, beginning the Mughal‚ÄìSafavid War. The Safavids won a major victory in February of that year when Kandahar was captured after a two-month siege. = Sieges = First siege  The loss of Kandahar was seen as a major strategic loss for the Mughal Empire. Furthermore, the Mughals saw the defeat as a blow to the empire's prestige, and Emperor Shah Jahan was determined to see the city returned to Mughal control. To this end he outfitted an expedition of 50,000 soldiers led by Prince Aurangzeb, Sadullah Khan (an adviser of the Mughal Court), and Jai Singh I of Jaipur. They advanced on Kandahar in April 1649, and spent several months fighting against Safavid forces in the flat countryside outside of the city. However, the Mughal army faced severe supply issues, and the army lacked sufficient artillery to destroy or breach the walls of Kandahar. In the fall of 1649, the Mughal army retreated, having lost 3000 men and thousands of draft animals.  Second siege  With the first siege defeated, the Mughals began to prepare for a second attempt to retake the city. For the second siege, the Mughals invested more in artillery by ordering the casting of larger siege cannons. The second expedition was also better funded, and employed camels as draft animals. As with the first expedition, Prince Aurangzeb, Sadullah Khan, and Jai Singh were in command. The second expedition arrived outside of Kandahar on 2 May 1652, where the force began digging siege trenches. However, the Safavid defenders of Kandahar possessed more accurate gunners (due to the Safavid Empire often warring with the Ottoman Empire in Persia), while the Mughal artillery was noted as being inaccurate. This issue was compounded when the Mughal Emperor ordered that no assault be conducted before the city walls had been breached, which the outgunned and outfought Mughal army was unable to do. In light of this, the emperor ordered that Auragzeb withdraw his army to Kabul, an order which was followed out on 9 July 1652.  Third siege  The Mughals attempted to recapture Kandahar in the spring of 1653. Having failed twice, Prince Aurangzeb was replaced by his brother, Prince Dara Shukoh, who was the heir to the Mughal Empire. Dara headed a force of 70000 soldiers commanded by a number of experienced Mughal generals and Jai Singh, whose efforts in the previous two sieges had been commended. However, Dara also delegated many of his tasks to his advisers, who often fought each other for his favor. The Mughal generals also resented that the prince favored his advisers and over more experienced military commanders. The third expedition arrived in Kandahar in April, where the army attempted to find a way to breach the city walls. However, the Mughal gunnery remained poor, and Dara was noted as being an incompetent military commander, often ordering and then countermanding ill-fated assaults. Some soldiers in the army were poorly equipped for a siege, having been outfitted for fighting a traditional line battle in the field. In June, an attempt to capture part of the city's walls failed due to Dara's interference, and by late summer discontent was growing within the army. With no victory in sight, the siege was lifted on 29 September 1653. The defeat of the final siege marked the effective end of the Mughal‚ÄìSafavid War.

Best known for winning the saddle bronc competition at the inaugural Calgary Stampede in 1912. An Indigenous athlete, he was the only Canadian to win a championship at this historic rodeo competition.  Early life  Tom Three Persons was born on March 19, 1888 to Double Talker (Ayakonhtseniki) a Kainai (Blood) woman and Fred Pace, a white trader and bootlegger. He was raised on the Blood Reservation after he was adopted by his mother‚Äôs Kainai husband. This assured his‚Äô ‚ÄòIndian‚Äô status. The Blood Reserve was his childhood home. He lived there until he ‚Äòenrolled‚Äô into St. Joseph‚Äôs Indian Industrial School, a Catholic boarding school, in May 1903. Following his release from residential school in 1906 Three Persons set about his dual careers of rodeo athlete and rancher/cowboy.  Rodeo achievements  Guy Weadick, the promoter of the first Calgary Stampede, sought to secure the best cowboys for the rodeo events. After contacting Blood Reserve Indian Agent W.J. Hyde, the Indian Agent wrote to Weadick endorsing Three Persons‚Äô entry in the two bucking horse contests. Three Persons won the saddle bronc contest by overcoming the previously un-ridden Cyclone, winning $1000, a saddle, and a gold belt buckle. An injury prevented him from defending his title at the 1913 Winnipeg Stampede. Although he remained active in local rodeos such as the Gleichen (Alberta) Stampede in 1914, and the 1918 Lethbridge Stampede, Three Persons never regained his Calgary form. Through the 1920s and 1930s he remained involved in rodeo as an organizer and judge.  Ranching, later life and death  Tom Three Persons, although living under the restrictive Canadian laws governing Indigenous peoples, was well known in southern Alberta as a rancher on the Blood Reserve. He raised cattle and horses and farmed grain. By the late 1930s, he was reported to own over 200 head of Hereford cattle. He left an estate estimated to be worth $100,000, Obituaries focused on his rodeo accomplishment at the 1912 Calgary Stampede. In 1983, he was inducted into the Canadian Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame.

In the composer's catalogue, it is given as Phantasy, subtitled: Quartet in one movement for oboe, violin, viola, violoncello. It was first performed in August 1933 as a BBC broadcast.  History  Britten composed Phantasy Quartet at age 18 as a student at the Royal College of Music, after his first work to which he assigned an Opus number, the Sinfonietta for chamber orchestra. He dedicated it to the oboist L√©on Goossens, who played the first performance in a BBC broadcast on 6 August 1933, with members of the International String Quartet. The same players performed the concert premiere in London on 21 November that year. On 5 April 1934, it was performed in Florence for the International Society of Contemporary Music, as the first piece to win the composer international recognition.  Music  The music is in the form of a 16th-century fantasy, in an arch form with elements from the sonata form. As in Mozart's Oboe Quartet, the oboe has a solo function. The duration is given as 15 minutes. It has been called \\"consummately crafted\\". The music grows out of silence and in the end returns to it in symmetry. The first theme is a march, marked molto pianissimo, with the cello beginning on the fingerboard of a muted cello, followed by viola, violin and finally the oboe. The theme becomes later also the source of themes in a fast section, similar to the development section of the sonata form. In the slow middle section, the strings alone introduce a theme in which the oboe joins. It is followed, in symmetry, by a recapitulation of the fast section, and then the march. The musicologist Eric Roseberry summarises: \\"If the pastoral slow section echoes the leisurely folkiness of an Englishry that Britten had not yet entirely rejected, the Phantasy as a whole generates a tension and harmonic grittiness which are harbingers of a less complacent outlook.\\"  Recordings  A recording by oboist Fran√ßois Leleux with Lisa Batiashvili, Lawrence Power and Sebastian Klinger combines the quartet with Mozart's oboe quartet and other chamber music by the two composers.

Mid-career and current work  Waltz of the Polypeptides sculpture on the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory campus in Long Island, New York In 2003 Haseltine created the ‚ÄòWaltz of the Polypeptides‚Äô, a large-scale sculpture inspired by the biological process undergone during construction of proteins within a cell. The artwork stretches eighty-four-foot across an outdoor space on the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory campus in Long Island. During the undertaking Haseltine developed a novel technique for taking sub-molecular data, used in bioinformatics, and massaging it through a series of computer programs to produce a usable form that could be milled or rapidly-prototyped. She went on to use this process repeatedly in her work, combining scientific data from the microscopic world and transposing it into three-dimensional sculptures. Another of Haseltine's large-scale sculptures of note is \\"SARS Inhibited\\", which depicts the active cleft of the SARS Virus with a stone path that represents the protease halting catalyzation. \\"SARS Inhibited\\" was built in 2006 on the Biolpolis Biotech Mecca courtyard in Singapore. Homologous Hope sculpture in the UPenn Medical Basser Research Center for BRCA ‚ÄúHomologous Hope,\\" built in 2014, is based on the BRCA2 protein, which, in a healthy cell, prevents breast, ovarian and prostate cancer.

The project was designed by architect Rafael Vi√±oly at the University of Pennsylvania. Haseltine's later work addresses the growing threat the planet due to anthropogenic climate change. In 2006, Along with artist, film maker and environmental activist Nora Maccoby she co-founded \\"The Green Salon,\\" an environmental solutions-based think tank based in Washington D.C. devoted to developing relationships between policy makers and NGO's. She has worked in collaboration with the Global Coral Reef Alliance since 2007 which in the fall of 2019 officially made an agreement with the Small Island States or SIDS at the United Nations to help foster sustainable solutions for countries most vulnerable to climate change..

Soon after, she created several \\"barefoot\\" experiments to test sustainable substrate for oysters in conjunction with the New School for Social Research, The NY/NJ Baykeepers and Cornell Marine Exchange in Long Island. In 2011 Mara did an artist in residency on the Tara Schooner of Tara expedition, which was conducting a worldwide study of planktonic ecosystems and their relationship to atmospheric climate change. The project was led by chief scientist Eric Karsenti, winner of \\"la m√©daille d'or du CNRS\\". Mara was awarded the honor of \\"Return of the Flag\\" for this work by the Explorers Club. Inspired by microplastic strands mixed with delicate planktonic forms in samples ascertained aboard the Tara expedition, Haseltine created a mixed-media performance entitled \\"La Boh√®me: A Portrait of Today Oceans in Peril.‚Äù The central sculpture in this work was a Tintinnid plankton fashioned from uranium-infused glass ensnared in a piece of micro-degraded plastic to which a live opera performance occurred and a Rodolfo sang to his \\"sick love\\". The installation debuted at the Explorers Club headquarters in New York on the Tara Expedition in 2012 and was shown at the Agnes b.

Supernatural 1 sculpture, 2014 In 2012, Haseltine participated in a show entitled \\"Earth Consciousness\\" curated by the Japanese futuristic artist Mariko Mori in the tropical islands of Okinawa Japan where she debuted her plans for a coral reef entitled \\"Enchanted Star Sand\\" based on a ctenophore plankton and local mythology. Upon meeting and interacting with the female Japanese Shamans of Okinawa, Haseltine's early interest in Shintoism, the original nature worshipping religion of Japan, was re-kindled. She created a body of work entitled Supernatural and Futurenatural in 2015 consisting of photography and sculpture within which there is a moment of awareness called Chikon where the spirit of the rocks or nature reveals itself. This system of interaction and awareness was reinforced by the atmospheric science of James Lovelock who put forth the Gaia Hypothesis that all of nature is connected in one living breathing organism or life force within the biosphere and further enforced by the belief of Gold Winning scientist Eric Karsenti that in fact the entire planet and all the organisms within it operate much like a living cell floating in space.

It was allegedly fought between the Clan Mackenzie and the Clan Munro. Mackenzie chronicles have claimed a signal victory. Historical evidence The first account of the Battle of Drumchatt was written in 1669 by George Mackenzie, 1st Earl of Cromartie in his History of the Family of Mackenzie and describes a battle between the Munros and Mackenzies in 1501. This has perplexed many historians because there is no reference in any contemporary historical documents to such a battle. Late 19th century historian, Alexander Mackenzie, later published an account of the same battle in his books The History of the Mackenzies (1894), and The History of the Munros of Fowlis (1898). The historian Alexander Mackenzie was a direct descendant of Hector Roy Mackenzie of Gairloch who he claims led the Mackenzies at this battle. The battle The Mackenzie's accounts states that William Munro, 12th Baron of Foulis led a group of 700 or 900 Munros, Dingwalls, and MacCullochs who attacked the Mackenzies, laying waste to their lands and taking cattle. However, on their return, they were attacked by just 140 Mackenzies according to Alexander Mackenzie, or 180 according to George Mackenzie, led by Hector Roy Mackenzie of Gairloch at a place called Drumchatt, where Munro's force of 700 or 900 was defeated. According to George Mackenzie, the leader of the Mackenzies, Hector Mackenzie, was not willing to enter into open battle on such unequal terms. Instead he ambushed William Munro's force when they were in a long and negligent march on the south side of the Knockfarrel hill which is the eastern extension of the Drumchatt ridge. According to George Mackenzie, the Mackenzies cut off many heads with axes and two-handed swords and that nineteen heads tumbled down the hill and into a well which has since been known in Scottish Gaelic as Tober ni Kean which means the \\"Fountain of Heads\\". According to one source William Munro's sheriff Alexander Vass of Lochslin was among those killed. Alexander Mackenzie also quotes a short Gaelic verse which was written by Rev. John MacRae (d.1704) in his Ardintoul MS History of the Mackenzies and which Alexander Mackenzie translates in English as: > \\"Although MacRath doth \\"fortunate\\" import, It's he deserves that name whose > brave effort, Eight hundred did put to flight, With his seven score at > Knock-Farrel\\". The Clan Munro Association (UK) translates the second line of the Gaelic verse into English differently as follows: > 'Did eight hundred men defeat and many kill, With his seven score on the > face of Pharrel hill'. A modern historian, C.I Fraser of Reelig also mentions William Munro and the alleged Battle of Drumchatt in 1501:. > William Munro of Foulis played a prominent part in public affairs in the > north, and was knighted by James IV. In 1501 in some official capacity, he > led a composite force of Munros, Dingwalls, and MacCullochs to attack Hector > Roy Mackenzie of Gairloch at Druim-a-Chait, near Strathpeffer. Mackenzie > chronicles have claimed a signal victory. Whatever the truth, the very next > year the Munro Chief was commanded to proceed to Lochaber on that hazardous > ploy, \\"the King's business\\". There, in 1505, he was slain by Lochiel.

Born in Bingley, then in the West Riding of Yorkshire, Johnson worked on a farm until 1882, when he emigrated to the United States. He undertook various jobs there, and joined the Knights of Labour during a lock out. He became increasingly active in the union, serving as a representative for worsted mill workers. In 1888, Johnson returned to the UK, becoming a shop assistant, and in 1889 he joined the East London Shop Assistants Union. He became its honorary secretary the following year, and took it into a merger which formed the National Union of Shop Assistants in 1891, becoming its full- time general secretary. While leader, he launched a journal, Shop Life Reform. Johnson was a member of the Fabian Society, on its radical wing, and unusually proposed in 1892 that Liberal Party officials should be ineligible for membership of the organisation. He was also a supporter of The Clarion, and was one of seven people present at a meeting at its office in 1892, when it was proposed that an independent labour party be formed. In 1893, this was established as the Independent Labour Party; Johnson served as secretary to the standing orders committee at is founding conference, and served on its first National Administrative Committee. He stood to become the first general secretary of the party, but was defeated by Shaw Maxwell, 66 votes to 28. Later in 1893, Johnson moved to London. The following year, he resigned his trade union post to become secretary of the Democratic Club, in succession to Shaw Maxwell. However, Shaw Maxwell soon returned to the post, and Johnson became treasurer of the Shop Assistants' Union, later serving a term as president. He also represented the union at the Trades Union Congress, the first shop assistant to attend one of its meetings.

She became a Methodist in 1775 and she convinced her husband, who was a curate in Ballyculter, of this approach to Christianity. Agnes was enthusiastic and she abandoned fancy dresses and frivolity and she was determined to preach whenever the opportunity arose. The Methodist leader John Wesley had reassured another Irish preacher, Alice Cambridge, that she should follow her heart if she was inclined to preach, but she should not preach near a male preacher as she may take some of his audience. Her husband's patron Lord Bangor objected to their approach and accused Edward of incorrect teaching. Her husband was found not guilty in court but nevertheless they lost their living in 1776 and the following year Edward's license to preach was taken away. Edward was invited to preach by John Wesley in 1782 and after returning from recovering from an illness in Ireland, Agnes also returned to work with the English Methodists.

It serves as a global headquarters for the American professional wrestling promotion, World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (WWE). While the interior is not accessible to the general public, WWE fans and visitors frequently visit or view the exterior of Titan Towers on a regular basis. Overview Built in 1981, the building consists of four stories of office space and four levels of parking. The building was acquired by Titan Sports, Inc. in 1985 to house offices of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). Though the building originally had only one flagpole with the United States flag, it later housed a second flag that featured the company's logo on a black background. The main exterior logo has also changed over the years. On September 7, 1995, the rooftop of Titan Towers was used for one of the scenes of the opening intro of WWF Monday Night Raw. This scene featured Yokozuna, The Undertaker, Razor Ramon and several other wrestlers. In 1999, Titan Towers was featured in a 30-second television commercial that consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Sable, The Rock, Kane, The Undertaker, Mankind, Chyna and Vince McMahon during Super Bowl XXXIII. That same year, on the June 14 edition of Raw is War, Austin took a kayfabe role as CEO overseeing day-to-day operations within the WWF. During the August 21, 2006 episode of Raw, D-Generation X defaced Titan Towers by tagging the \\"DX\\" logo on one of the sides of the building. In the build-up to Extreme Rules in 2013, Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman visited Titan Towers on May 13 in which they vandalized Triple H's office and attacked nearby employees of WWE. On March 20, 2019, the company announced they will sell Titan Towers, and relocate their headquarters to 677 Washington Boulevard in Stamford, Connecticut by 2021. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Titan Towers began to be used as an alternative location for selected matches during pay-per-views (as opposed to the WWE Performance Center); WrestleMania 36's \\"Firefly Fun House\\" match between Bray Wyatt and John Cena was filmed at Titan Towers using props and set pieces in storage, while WWE announced that the two eponymous ladder matches at Money in the Bank would take place on its premises, with the participants needing to make it to the rooftop in order to locate the Money in the Bank briefcase.

Publication Yi Sang was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 1933. After his main works, including Crow‚Äôs eye view, he wrote The Wings, and traveled to Tokyo. He died in 1937. This work was published in Jo-Gwang (Ï°∞Í¥ë) in September 1936. The English version of this work was published in 2001 by Ahn Jung-hyo and James B. Lee by Jimoondang Publishing Company. Significance  This work has historical significance in that it changed the literary technique of depicting self-consuming and self- disintegrating intellectuals of the colonial period and reflects the problem of social reality to consciousness. In prior 1920s first-person point of view novels, the reports and confessions of witnesses and actual experiencers were not internalized by external expressions or planar constitutions. In this novel, these things were embodied through internalized experiments through the expression of psychology. It is considered a turning point of novel history. The marriage relationship is a metaphor for the life in which the value of 'I' is neglected from daily life through the appearance of the husband being raised. The paradoxical emergence of 'I' to overcome the obstacles of self- division and to seek self-reliance was shaped by experimental literacy done by Yi Sang. In particular, the internalization of consciousness and psychology has a new significance in the literature in the 1930s, in that it did not have to ignore social reality by replacing the pathology of colonial society with the contradictions and conflicts of individual life stories.

It was specially designed to be easy to use, with well spaced keys that also have backlight for use in the dark. As a result the 101 became popular. Nokia would that year launch the Nokia 1011 which is a digital GSM phone. The Nokia 121 was aimed for business markets, and the Nokia 100 was a more simple version for consumers.

Chosen by Brazil's president Jair Bolsonaro in January 2019 following a suggestion made by Olavo de Carvalho, Ara√∫jo subscribes to conspiracy theories such as man-made climate change is untrue and a \\"communist plot\\", \\"globalism\\" is a process driven by \\"cultural Marxism\\", and the Covid-19 (Coronarivus) pandemic is the result of another communist plot he dubbed \\"comunavirus\\". Career Ara√∫jo is a career diplomat at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (often called Itamaraty after its headquarters). He served in Itamaraty's division of Mercosur affairs from 1991 to 1995, from 2007 to July 2010 and from 2010 to 2015 he was deputy chief at the Brazilian Embassies in Ottawa and in Washington, D.C., respectively. In June 2018, he was promoted to the rank of First Class Minister in the Brazilian Foreign Service, a career diplomat's top rank, that allows them to be posted as Ambassadors. In the custom of the Brazilian Foreign Service, First Class Ministers are styled \\"Ambassador\\" even when they have not yet assumed the direction of an embassy, as was the case with Ara√∫jo. =Foreign Affairs Minister (2019‚Äìpresent)= U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in April 2019 Ara√∫jo with U.S. President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, 30 August 2019 After the election of Jair Bolsonaro as President of Brazil in October 2018, the newly promoted Ambassador Ara√∫jo was chosen to be the Foreign Minister in the new Administration. The choice was considered unusual. Ara√∫jo was not an influential member of Itamaraty, being described by The Economist as \\"hitherto-obscure diplomat\\", and got the job after a suggestion by Olavo de Carvalho. An anonymous group of Brazilian diplomats published a manifesto lamenting his appointment and claiming Ara√∫jo is \\"manifestly unprepared\\" and holds \\"ridiculous\\" and \\"absurd\\" opinions. Others, also speaking anonymously, described him as an \\"extremely scholarly man\\", with profound knowledge of ancient history. Ara√∫jo assumed office as foreign minister on 1 January 2019. On 8 January 2019, he asked diplomats to inform the UN that Brazil had withdrawn from the Global Compact for Migration. Positions During the PT administrations, Ara√∫jo publicly supported the core elements of Lula da Silva's and Dilma Rousseff's foreign policy. In 2008, for instance, he criticized those who called their progressive agenda \\"ideological\\" and defended the right of Hugo Ch√°vez's Venezuela to be a member of Mercosur. More recently, he began to state opinions that apparently denied his own previous positions. In a 2017 article published by the International Relations Research Institute (IPRI), Ara√∫jo praised U.S. President Donald Trump for his nationalist rhetoric and holds that he is restoring Western values that have been challenged by nihilism, which he believes is the Western enemy that replaced communism. In the same article, he praises the self- declared neo-fascist political analyst Aleksandr Dugin, whose books, according to Ara√∫jo, \\"should be studied\\".According to Paulo Roberto de Almeida, a senior Brazilian diplomat, Ara√∫jo's apparent ideological U-turn was a \\"deliberate\\" move to please Olavo de Carvalho and \\"get the job\\" in the Bolsonaro administration.https://politica.estadao.com.br/blogs/blog-do-fucs/itamaraty Ara√∫jo also maintains a blog entitled \\"Metapolitics 17 ‚Äì Against Globalism\\", where he writes that globalism \\"is the economic globalization that has been driven by cultural Marxism\\" and that is \\"essentially anti-human and anti- Christian\\". On his blog, Ara√∫jo has also claimed that climate change is a \\"cultural Marxism\\" plot to undermine Western countries in order to support China's growth, and has also lamented the \\"criminalisation\\" of red meat, oil and heterosexual sex. He has also claimed that Nazism was a leftist movement. His statement was criticised by German historians and scholars, such as Stefanie Sch√ºler-Springorum and Wulf Kansteiner, as \\"nonsense\\" and \\"scientifically absurd\\".https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mundo/2019/03/ernesto- araujo-diz-a-canal-de-youtube-que-nazismo-foi-movimento-de-esquerda.shtml He has called for Brazil to build a new alliance with the United States, Russia, Israel, India, Italy, Japan and the Visegr√°d Group nations. Personal life Ara√∫jo was born in Porto Alegre on 15 May 1967. He graduated from the University of Bras√≠lia, where he studied linguistics and literature, and was trained as a diplomat at the Rio Branco Institute. Ara√∫jo is a practising Roman Catholic. His father, , worked as an Attorney General of the Brazilian military dictatorship. During his tenure, Henrique Fonseca de Ara√∫jo acted to prevent Gustav Franz Wagner, a Nazi official and deputy commander of the Sobib√≥r extermination camp, from being extradited to Germany. After the War, Wagner had managed to escape to Brazil, where he died some years after having his extradition denied by the Brazilian dictatorship.

He remained in those places for another two years due to extensive study which continued from 2015 to 8 to 10 January 2016. The last two years showed that every time a human feeds the birds the tits get a chick more while in Cornwall the same species used to get more fatter and therefore produced fewer chicks.

The college leagues that have tie-ins with the bowl are Conference USA, Mid-American Conference and Sun Belt Conference. The affiliation contract with ESPN Events has each conference supplying a team four times in a six-year bowl cycle from 2020 to 2025. Coastal Carolina University will host the game at its Brooks Stadium with a new capacity of 20,000 seats following an expansion project completed prior to the 2019 season. Background In 2013, \\"Group of Five\\" conferences were looking to start bowl games for their leagues, as the Power Five conferences \\"prefer to play each other in bowl games\\". The NCAA had a restriction on championship games, including bowl games, being held in South Carolina due to display of the Confederate flag on State House grounds, which was lifted in July 2015. Organizers for the Medal of Honor Bowl, an all-star game, announced their intent to apply for NCAA sanctioning as a traditional postseason bowl game featuring FBS college teams, with a tentative game date of December 18, 2016. However, in April 2016, the NCAA announced a three-year moratorium on new bowl games. In 2017, the Mid-American Conference (MAC) had two teams, Western Michigan and Buffalo, that qualified for bowl games with six wins but did not go to a bowl as the five MAC bowl slots were filled. History In June 2018, the NCAA indicated that the Grand Strand area was approved for a bowl game. ESPN Events and the Myrtle Beach Bowl was announced, on November 13, 2018. The three tie-in conferences are the Sun Belt Conference, Conference USA, and Mid- American Conference. The bowl is slated to start playing at the end of the 2020 season in December. It will be the 40th bowl game in 2020, if no current bowl game ceases operation before then.

It was mapped in 1922 by Lauge Koch, who noted that the glacier tongue extended into Lake Alida (near Foulk Fjord). Hiawatha Glacier attracted attention in 2018 because of the discovery of a crater beneath the surface of the ice sheet in the area. A publication noted in 1952 that Hiawatha Glacier had been retreating since 1920. __TOC__ Possible impact structures Two views of the Hiawatha crater region‚Äîone covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet, the other showing the topography of the rock beneath the ice sheet, including the crater In November 2018, a study revealed the existence of a large () circular depression beneath Greenland's ice sheet in the Hiawatha Glacier region‚Äîup to a kilometre below the surface of the ice. It has not been dated and its discoverers can only say with certainty that the structure is younger than the 1.985 to 1.740 Ga old Paleoproterozoic bedrock in the region. Some evidence suggests that if it is impact related, it was created after ice covered Greenland three million years ago. News reports about the discovery include speculation that it could be as young as 12,000 years; these assertions are based on the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. Fragments of charcoal up to about in size that were recovered directly from the ice at the tip of the Hiawatha Glacier, where the glacial outwash containing sand interpreted to be either impact melt or shocked metamorphite was collected, yielded an age greater than 50,000 BP. They interpret the charcoal to be wood that had undergone \\"thermal alteration.\\"Garde, A.A., Funder, S., Guvad, C., Kj√¶r, K.H., Larsen, N.K., Dahl-M√∏ller, J., Nehrke, G., Sanei, H., S√∏ndergaard, A.-S., and Weikusat, C., 2019. Organic Carbon from the Hiawatha Impact Crater, North-West Greenland. 50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference 2019. LPI Contrib. No. 2132. From an interpretation of the crystalline nature of the underlying rock, together with chemical analysis of sediment washed from the crater, the impactor was argued to be a metallic asteroid with a diameter in the order of . A volume of approximately of rock would have been either vaporized or melted. Such an impact would have continued to melt ice flowing into the crater for an as-of-yet undetermined period post-impact. If an impact origin for the crater is confirmed, still to be done, it would be one of the twenty- five largest known impact craters on Earth. Regardless of its exact age, based on the size of the Hiawatha impact crater, this impact very likely had significant environmental consequences in the Northern Hemisphere and possibly globally. A NASA glaciologist has discovered in February 2019 a possible second impact crater buried under ice in northwest Greenland. Though the newly found impact sites in northwest Greenland are only 183 km apart, at present they do not appear to have formed at the same time. If the second crater, which has a width of over 35 km, is ultimately confirmed as the result of a meteorite impact, it will be the 22nd largest impact crater found on Earth. Cape York meteorite The Agpalilik meteorite outside the University of Copenhagen Geological Museum Before the crater was discovered, the Inuit had found iron meteorites in the region. In 1957 an American surveyor found a meteorite, and in 1963 Vagn F. Buchwald found the 20-ton Agpalilik meteorite (a fragment of the Cape York meteorite) on a nunatak near Moltke Glacier, which is on the Agpalilik peninsula in the Thule district of northwest Greenland. It has been suggested that the Cape York meteorite is part of the main object responsible for creating the Hiawatha crater. Estimates of the Hiawatha impact's age (which is still being studied), along with other indicators, suggest that the crater may be connected with the Younger Dryas impact hypothesis. However, until the impact's age is determined, the connection between the Hiawatha impact and the younger Dryas event remains a suggestion. However, if correct, its associated ejecta would have dispersed as far as Pilauco Bajo in southern Chile. Dating the Hiawatha crater requires drilling almost through the ice sheet above the crater to obtain a sample of dateable, solidified impact melt from the crater.

His story gained much coverage and he has since become an activist promoting suicide prevention. Hines has been featured on CNN, HuffPost, ABC News, Larry King Now, and The Today Show. He has appeared at over 2,000 college and university campuses worldwide, and over 3,000 high schools sharing his story, \\"Triumph Over Adversity, The Kevin Hines Story.\\" He co-founded the Kevin and Margaret Hines Foundation (KMHF) a 501(c)(3) organization based in Atlanta, Georgia. The organization provides funding and education for suicide prevention in the United States and around the world. Early life and progression of events Hines was nine months old when he was adopted by Pat and Debbie Hines, who were both from the San Francisco area. At ten, he was put on Tegretol to help control epileptic seizures. The medicine worked well for him. He was athletic as a teen, becoming a football player and wrestler. At sixteen, he was taken off of the medicine because he'd had no more seizures. The Tegretol had unknowingly been suppressing characteristics of bipolar disorder, and combined outside stresses impacted him as well. Around that time, Pat left Debbie and Hines remained with her. Debbie said Hines changed drastically. Hines was also deeply affected by the suicide of his drama teacher. Manifestations of his depression included regular mood swings, paranoia, hallucinations and voices, as well as becoming harder to control. In January 2000, Hines moved in with Pat after a serious argument with Debbie. In September of that year, his girlfriend broke up with him. Over that weekend, he wrote and discarded a number of suicide notes, until the seventh one, which he was satisfied with. He told his father ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be here any more‚Äù, and his father said ‚ÄúYou have an obligation to be here. We love you.‚Äù On Monday, September 25, Pat was concerned about his son and offered to spend the day with him watching movies or bring him to his workplace. Hines declined, and hugged and kissed his father goodbye as he thought he'd never see him again, as Pat dropped him off at City College. Hines said he'd actually felt fine, because he was satisfied in knowing he was going to end his pain. He took a bus from City College to the Golden Gate bridge. Suicide attempt ABC News reported that Hines began hearing voices in his head telling him to die. On his walk up the pathway, he wept. Hines contemplated not jumping, reasoning that if any person showed that they cared about him, he would not commit suicide. A female police officer and bridge workers passed him without stopping. A woman with a German accent did come up to him and asked him to take her picture at the bridge, but she did not mention anything about his tears or ask about his well-being. After she left, he took several steps and threw himself over the rail. After leaping, Hines, as described by Time, had instant regret: \\"When my hands left that rail‚Äîand my legs curled over‚Äîas soon as I left the bridge, I thought, 'I don't want to die'.\\" He had gone over the railing head first, but when he regretted his decision, turned himself around to land in the water legs first. The impact force was comparable to slamming into a concrete wall. After he'd surfaced, he felt a creature nudging his body which he initially thought was a shark trying to eat him, and punched at it. The creature was later identified as a sea lion by a witness. The sea lion helped keep Hines afloat until he was rescued by the Coast Guard. Aftermath The New York Post reported: \\"Now Hines, who - when he leapt - had recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, tells his story to at-risk groups around the nation, urging people to get treatment for mental illness and helping them realize that suicide is not the answer.\\" The San Francisco Magazine documents Hines' life after the jump: \\"He now works as a mental-health advocate, traveling the world to share his story in the hopes of preventing suicide.\\" =Public and media appearances= Hines has been featured by CNN, HuffPost, ABC News, Larry King Now, The Today Show, BuzzFeed, PBS, 9 news Australia, The New York Post, Time, Business Insider, Newsweek, Forbes, Fox News, Reddit, and other media outlets. Activism Kevin and Margaret Hines Foundation Hines's mission, through his foundation, is to provide mental health education and suicide prevention information. The organization is run largely by his wife, Margaret, and a small team of leaders. Methods for achieving their mission include worldwide public speaking engagements, research initiatives, applicable education through wellness programs, and multi-media projects that focus on mental wellness for holistic health, including a YouTube Channel that focuses on mental health and a Documentary Film, Suicide: The Ripple Effect. The film was awarded Best Story at the Nice International Film Festival in Nice, France in 2018. One of the projects Hines has been passionate about is to have a safety net erected around the Golden Gate bridge to catch people who jump. The net has started construction and the project is scheduled to be completed in 2021. When Hines saw the first parts of net, he wept and said ‚ÄúThis is one of the most special days of my life.‚Äù  Awards and nominations  * American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Lifesaver of the Year Award * Mental Health America: The Clifford Whittingham Beers Award * Young Minds Advocacy: Mental Health Champion * NoStigmas: Hero Award * National Council Community Behavioral Healthcare: Lifetime Achievement Award * San Francisco Police Department: Commendation Award  References  Living people Suicide prevention Mental health activists 1981 births American adoptees People with epilepsy People with bipolar disorder ","title":"Kevin Hines"},{"id":"59055550","text":"John Page (1696? ‚Äì 1779) of Watergate House, near Chichester, Sussex was an English Member of Parliament.

The founding member was Paul Mirfin (lead vocals, guitar, merlin, harmonica) who, whilst working as a train conductor on Northern Rail, began writing and performing songs at music events that he organised at the local Caffe Nero branch in Harrogate. The original band came together after Mirfin put a call out at his local church to recruit musicians. During the first few months of forming there was a speedy acceleration in the popularity of the band as they played in pubs, cafes, churches and at country music festivals. The trio's unique acoustic sound with a range of instruments from Merlin to Irish Bouzouki set alongside rich three part harmonies influenced by violinist Dan Jackman's classical music training set them apart from other bands on the gig circuit. Drawing from influences such as Del Amitri, David Crowder, Johnny Cash and Mumford & Sons they were strong on melodies and story-telling lyrics. After an appearance on BBC Songs of Praise in June 2016, where Mirfin was featured as Yorkshire's Singing Train Conductor by presenter Diane-Louise Jordan, the band began to gain momentum releasing their first EP 'Bring the Rain' in the same month and playing to sell out venues in the Yorkshire area. Recorded in one day at a small local studio called Homefire, this live studio recording provided a springboard onto the international music scene.  History = 2015-2017 = Paul Mirfin had been playing on the pub gig scene in Harrogate for five years, playing solo and with folk groups such as Echo the Woods. In 2015 he began writing his own songs and contacted the church he attended to recruit musicians to form the first Paul Mirfin Band line up. Dom Cottrill (cajon, drums, vocals) and Daniel Jackman (violin, vocals) joined Mirfin in March 2015 and by October the group had a 60-minute set of original songs by Mirfin as well as covers of country and gospel classics including Come to the River by Rhett Walker, This I Know by David Crowder and I Saw the Light by Hank Williams. The three had very different musical backgrounds and their sound was informed by Cottrill's rock drumming experience, Jackman's classical music training and Mirfin's previous involvement in the country and folk scene. The band gigged on railway platforms across the north of England as Mirfin continued his career with Northern Rail resulting in the local press naming him 'The Singing Train Conductor'. The trio also played at a series of events in local cafes called 'The Oaks'. These twilight gigs were born out of an idea by Mirfin to make live music accessible to families outside of a pub environment. At one of these events BBC journalist Rachel Williams spotted the band and put them forward for a special railway themed episode of Songs of Praise also featuring R&B; and soul singer Ruby Turner and classical singer Katherine Jenkins. Shortly after this in May 2016 the band released their first EP 'Bring the Rain' recorded live at Homefire Studios Harrogate on an independent label. The songs on this EP were inspired by collisions in life and relationships following a turbulent few years in Mirfin's life. Underlying themes in many of the songs are those of love and hope, influenced by testimonies of Mirfin's Christian faith. The EP was followed by a single released in November 2017 called 'The Fighter' \\"with its memorable Trinitarian lines, \\"Well, there's one of you/And there's three of me/Come on and fight.\\" Dan Jackman, Diane-Louise Jordan, Paul Mirfin, Dom Cottrill at Harrogate Railway Station during filming for BBC1 Songs of Praise, May 2016 As the band gained in popularity gigs became more frequent with appearances at the Pateley Bridge Mighty Men Conference with Angus Buchan, the Bettys and Taylors Woodland Festival, The Knaresborough Bed Race, 'The Oaks' Live Music at Caffe Nero and an invitation from Angus Buchan to the Sacred Assembly event in Johannesburg. In December 2016, Cottrill and Jackman decided they needed to step down as full-time band members to focus on family life, which led to a short transitional period for The Paul Mirfin Band while a new line up formed and new songs were written and rehearsed. They returned for a brief period in 2017 for the filming of 'The Fighter' music video, which later won Best Rock Video 2017 at the JUMP music awards. The video, shot around Thirsk, North Yorkshire, was directed by Dave Thorp and featured actor Velton Lishke along with Mirfin as two men in conflict; Mirfin's character defeats 'The Fighter' (played by Lishke) in an underground bare knuckle fight scene without actually throwing a punch. = 2017-present = Following the success of 'The Fighter', media interest in the band and in Mirfin's testimony heightened, particularly amongst Christian broadcasting companies. In March 2017 the new band line up made their first appearance on TBN UK with presenter Leon Schoeman on TBN Meets. The new line up included Warren Timmis, an accomplished lead guitarist with a BA (Hons) in Contemporary Music and influences such as Mahavishnu Orchestra, Old Crow Medicine Show and Slash ; Mark Boyle (banjo, shruti) brought country music influences from the likes of Chet Atkins and Merle Travis and John Evamy (violin) whose classical background in music and compositional studies at University of York where he completed a BA (Hons) brought new depth to the string arrangements. Paul's brother, Ben Mirfin (drums), who had previously played in church worship bands, completed the new line up before their next major appearance at Creation Fest, Cornwall in August 2017. This coincided with the release of a cover version of 'This Train is Bound for Glory' with accompanying music video shot on Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway. They also embarked on their first tour of church venues in Liverpool, Darlington, Sheffield and Wetherby. In January 2018 it was announced that the band were returning to Homefire Studios in Harrogate to record their first full-length album 'Ancient Roads'. The full costs of the album were funded through a successful Pledge Music Campaign. In his review of the album Tony Cummings from Cross Rhythms Radio wrote: \\"In the '60s it was Parchment and Gordon Giltrap-era Graham Kendrick. In the '90s it was Eden Burning and the Pink Dandelions. And today a new band, led by singer, guitarist and songwriter Paul Mirfin from Knaresborough, have emerged onto the scene easily as good as those units of yesteryear.......the delicate acoustic-driven \\"Trust In The Silence\\" which is as haunting an intimate worship song as you're likely to hear this year. Remember the name. You'll be hearing a lot more of these Yorkshire men's slant on American country porch music in the years ahead.\\" 2018 also saw the band performing at large scale festivals in the UK and USA - Spring Harvest and True North at Harrogate Royal Hall, North Yorkshire and Joshua Fest, Quincy, California.

With 1,650 seats, the theater first opened on December 23, 1947 under the name Teatro Warner Radiocentro, it was owned by brothers Goar and Abel Mestre. Today the building serves as the headquarters of Cuban Institute of Radio and Television (ICRT). Construction Building characteristics advertisement. ca 1948 For the construction of this building, the Havana building authorities granted a permit in 1947 amending the ordinances that were then in effect in El Vedado prohibiting the construction of buildings of more than three storeys. This statute was modified six years later to expand the construction of up to four floors because many planners and owners claimed the need to authorize them to build taller buildings in the area. The building was set back from the property line five meters, adding four meters for an arcade which allowed a distance from the road while adjusting to the strong slope of 23rd Street, in this way the arcade became a wide gallery and at the same time sub-divided the basement level. This gallery became the covered hall of the cinema located in the upper corner with Calle L. The building had an expressionist curved cover of a large scale relating to the important intersection. This same scale was adopted in the restaurant that was located on the opposite corner on M. Street. The wide gallery gives access to the lobby of the office building. The third building is set up by a prismatic piece on M Street, also set back to emphasize the two corners. Program Edificio Radiocentro CMQ. Television studios entrance on Calle M. The cinema with a capacity for 1,700 spectators was originally a Cinerama which used three projectors and a twenty-five-foot radius screen. It had a small stage in which short-term shows could be offered, in order to entertain the audience in the middle of the films. The radio station CMQ occupied part of the offices of the ten-story building, which was attached to the block of rental offices. In this area, a part of the land had also been reserved for future television installations, which had not yet been built. In one of its studios, Studio Number 2 was the venue not only of radio program transmissions but also that studio was the location of all or most of the RCA Victor recordings in Cuba from 1948 to 1959. The label at the CMQ complex was Discuba, a Cuban record label founded in 1959 by RCA Victor. It released music by several internationally successful artists such as Celia Cruz, Beny Mor√©, Orquesta Arag√≥n and La Lupe. The ground floor, which was common for the entire complex, had different types of commercial establishments: several exhibition halls, a bank, a restaurant, and a cafeteria. The pedestrian circulation was designed in such a way so that it made it necessary to pass in front of these premises. Architecture Radiocentro CMQ Building floor plan showing Cinerama theater, domino frame structure office building and radio and television studios. Cinerama using three projectors and curved screen. The Radiocentro CMQ Building of 1947, built on 23rd Street between Calles L and M in El Vedado, was the first mixed use building in Cuba. The architectural program of the building included businesses, offices, radio, and television studios, as well as the Cinerama Warner cinema. This project joined the expertise of the structural engineers, the U.S. firm Purdy and Henderson, Engineers, and the architects Mart√≠n Dom√≠nguez Esteban and Miguel Gast√≥n and Emilio del Junco, all members of the ATEC (Cuban section of the CIAM). The building had a great impact since it was published in the magazine L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui.L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui, 23 May 1949 Radiocentro CMQ Building_entrance on Calle M The building is a series of independent boxes, it was designed by the Basque architect Mart√≠n Dom√≠nguez Esteban (1897-1970). Esteban had been the architect of the Hip√≥dromo de la Zarzuela, along with Carlos Arniches. The CMQ Building was loosely modeled after Raymond Hood's Rockefeller Center. The Radiocentro CMQ Building had an impact on many Cuban architects who subscribed to Modern architecture and buildings that would be built in the following years, such as the Hotel Habana Hilton across La Rampa (now known as Hotel Habana Libre) designed by Welton Becket and associates with the Cuban architectural firm of Arroyo and Men√©ndez, the1958, the twenty- three story Edificio Seguro Medico by Antonio Quintana, among others. Walter Gropius, during a visit he made in 1949 to Havana referred to the Radiocentro CMQ Building to defend the need for architectural teamwork and collaboration among architects: It is impossible for the architect to know all of the equipment and installation requirements; therefor, it is necessary for the cooperation of architectural specialists. El FOCSA The FOCSA Building In 1952 the CMQ Radio and TV Network planned to provide administrative offices, a radio station and housing for employees. CMQ selected a 110,000 sq. ft. plot of land costing approximately 700,000 pesos. The company Fomento de Hipotecas Aseguradas (FHA) financed 80% of the cost of the residences and 60% of the commercial shops. El Banco Continental Cubano granted a credit of 6 million pesos. Mart√≠n Dom√≠nguez Esteban with Ernesto G√≥mez-Sampera designed the FOCSA Building, a modernist project aimed to provide housing for its workers and additional radio stations. Work began in February 1954 and finished in June 1956. At the time of construction it was the second-largest residential concrete building in the world, second only to the Martinelli Building in S√£o Paulo, Brazil. It surpassed the L√≥pez Serrano Building in height which had been Cuba's tallest building. The FOCSA shares some curios design similarities with the Edificio del Seguro M√©dico of 1958 by Antonio Quintana including single loading of apartments, natural ventilation of the apartments and a small rear window under the kitchen cabinets marking vertically the center of the wall. El Salon de Mayo In 1943 while France was under German occupation, a group of Paris artists in a caf√© on the Rue Dauphineartists formed what they called an association with the intent to exhibit art as an answer to the Nazi party's description of Modern art as Degenerate art; eventually, they organized the Salon de Mai. The group presented its first exhibition in May 1945. Under the leadership of Gaston Diehl, the first Salon de Mai exhibition took place in the Galerie Pierre Maurs (3, avenue Matignon) from 29 May to 29 June 1945. More than 20 years later in July 1967, the Salon de Mayo came to Havana as el Sal√≥n de Mayo. It was the group's first exhibition in America. The Sal√≥n de Mayo was an art exhibition in Havana that took place in July 1967. It was an artists' collective that took its name from the Parisian Salon de Mai and was organized by Carlos Franqui with the assistance from Wifredo Lam, Ren√© Portocarrero, Alexander Calder, Joan Mir√≥ and Pablo Picasso. The exhibition presented works by more than one hundred artists and represented rival schools of twentieth-century art as well as early modernists (Picasso, Miro, Magritte). Fifteen artists contributed their original works to be reproduced in sidewalk mosaics of integral color granite by the Cuban company Ornacen, with the help of the architects Fernando Salinas and Eduardo Rodr√≠guez acting as technical consultants. The image of the mosaics was obtained with a cement mixture colored with fine gravel of crushed marble and marble powder, then polished. Bronze sheets delimited the embedded mosaics The mosaics are approximately fourteen to eighteen inches and fifteen different designs are repeated over several blocks, there are180 mosaics in total.

Presidential palace attack Attack on Radio Reloj. CMQ Radio station, March 13, 1957 Echeverr√≠a's car at L and Jovellar where he was killed. He was on the way back to the Architecture School located on the back side of the University. The Radiocentro CMQ Building played a part in the general plan of the Presidential Palace Attack of 1957 where over fifty people died, as explained by Faure Chaum√≥n Mediavilla, one of the leaders of the attack. The plan had been to attack and kill Fulgencio Batista at his office in the Presidential Palace by a commando of about fifty men and simultaneously support this operation with more than one hundred men, some would occupy the radio station Radio Reloj at the CMQ complex to announce the news of Batista's death and to encourage the people of Havana into a general strike and to incite them to join an armed rebellion. Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a, who was President of the Federation of University Students (Federaci√≥n Estudiantil Universitaria - FEU), and leader of the assault of CMQ Radio made the speech at the regular time of a music program which most people listened to so that Echeverr√≠a's anti-Batista speech would be broadcast to the whole Cuban nation. Echeverr√≠a estimated that the rioters could only occupy the radio station for three minutes, therefore he had to prepare a speech which lasted three minutes at most. Echeverr√≠a managed to finish his speech at the 181st-second mark. He managed to leave the station unharmed and on the way to the University of Havana, just a few blocks away, his car was intercepted by a patrol car. He was killed during the shootout on the sidewalk of the north side of the university.

Etymology  The volcano was originally named in 1951, on a map by the United States Geological Survey. Its name was taken after a plateau located on the northern side of the volcano's main summit, taking the appearance of an anvil.  Location  Anvil Peak is located on Semisopochnoi Island, in the Rat Islands of the western Aleutian Islands. It is one of the seven hills with a summit crater on the island. It is the highest point on the island as well as the highest point on all of the Rat Islands. It is located further north than any of the other hills on the island, taking up a large amount of the northern part of the island. The volcano is located away from Atka, from Shemya, and from Attu.  Geology  Anvil Peak has two summits, which are both volcanic cones. The larger main summit is tall, making it the highest point on the island. This summit is surrounded by ravines, which contain snow at certain times of the year. The peak is part of the old rim of a crater on the volcano, which had been slightly lowered due to erosion. A plateau is located north of this summit, which is what the volcano was named after. The plateau is about wide and is almost completely flat. Six lava flows, about wide each, are located beneath this area. These flows are visible on all except one of the sides of the cliffs holding up the flat area, and had previously been located inside of the crater on the volcano. The other summit is located southwest of the main summit, and is slightly shorter. It is not known exactly when Anvil Peak first formed, but it is believed to have formed after Mount Cerberus. According to the Global Volcanism Program of the Smithsonian Institution, its formation occurred during the late Pleistocene epoch. It has not erupted in recent times; it is thought that its last activity was probably thousands of years ago. Anvil Peak has experienced deep erosion, more so than the other cones on the islands, which is partially due to its height.

It demonstrates typical architecture of the First Spanish Period in that it has no entry from the street but rather through a courtyard on the side for security and privacy. There are no openings on the north wall, which during colonial times would have helped to keep out winds.

He is currently employed with the University of Southern California School of Dramatic Arts as an Associate Dean of Faculty and Associate Dean of Strategic Initiatives. Some of his written works include the plays Blade To The Heat and Yerma In the Desert along with several other works which have brought him attention in part for their regular addressing of issues of sexuality and gender rights. In addition to his theatrical productions, Oliver Mayer is also the co-author of a short, illustrated children's book, Big Dog on Campus, along with Patricia Rae.  Early life and career  Oliver Mayer was born in Hollywood, California to Gloria and Alexander A. Mayer. His father, Alexander, was an American who worked as an Art Director with Universal Studios for more than 20 years before passing away, and his mother was a Mexican American who worked in nursing administration and had an influence over her son's interest in theater as she wanted him to be an actor while he was a child. In 1978, at the age of 13, Mayer was taken to see the play Zoot Suit, which ultimately served to further inspire him to take up a career in play-writing. During his childhood, Mayer suffered from bullying and ultimately took up boxing as a means to cope with the pressure. He took weekly lessons between the ages of 13 and 17. He then went on to study English and vocal music at Cornell University, and spent his junior year abroad at the University of Oxford where he was inspired to receive a Master of Fine Arts in play writing from Columbia University. Mayer had his first work produced in 1985 at the age of 20 and returned to Los Angeles, California after college in 1989. He joined the faculty at the University of Southern California in 2003 and went on to spend seven years interviewing in order to become a professor with tenure.  Major works = Yerma In The Desert = Yerma in the Desert is one of Mayer's more recent theatrical productions that premiered in Los Angeles, California at the Greenway Court Theatre and Urban Theatre Movement in mid-November, 2017. The piece focuses on a woman by the name of Yerma who is being denied romantic intimacy with and by her spouse, Juan, as she is tied to a loveless marriage by the prospect of having children. The play addresses gender equality in the professional sector, LGBTQ themes and deportations within the United States of America. Yerma in the Desert is an attempt to capture the message and subject of Federico Garcia Lorca's play, _Yerma_ , in a modern-day setting as the production takes place within a university and is heavily focused on the custodial staff as opposed to the student body. = Blade To The Heat and Members Only = Among Mayer's more notable works, Blade to the Heat, is a play that centers on two boxers respectively of Mexican American and Cuban heritage, Pedro Quinn and Mantequilla Decima. The work initially premiered in 1996 in Los Angeles, California directed by Ron Link and utilized music by Gloria Trevi. It addresses topics of drug trafficking and LGBTQ themes and is set in Sinaloa, Mexico. Additionally, Blade to the Heat was loosely inspired by Federico Garcia Lorca's work, ‚Äú _Blood Wedding_ ‚Äù and Mayer's own experiences with boxing during his teenage years. The sequel to this piece, Members Only, is the most recent of Mayer's theatrical productions and was a work in progress for over six years before performances began on October 25, 2018 at LATC 514 S.

The 5th Congress of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (Serbo- Croatian Latin: , Cyrillic: ) was held from 21 to 28 July 1948, in the House of the Guard in Topƒçider, Belgrade. The Congress was attended by 2,344 delegates out of the 468,175 members of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia.  Background  It was the first Congress of Yugoslav communists held after World War II, takeover of power in the country and establishment of the SFR Yugoslavia, but also the first major gathering of Yugoslav communists held since the 5th Territorial Conference, held in October 1940. Although 20 years have passed since the previous, the 5th Congress, was held in November 1928, and 8 years have passed since the 5th Territorial Conference, the main reason for conveying the Congress was the \\"Resolution of the Informbiro\\", adopted by Soviet‚Äìdominated Cominform on 28 June 1948 in Bucharest, SR Romania.  The Congress  The main topic of the Congress was the \\"Resolution of the Informbiro\\" and supporting the Yugoslav leadership in resisting Cominform. The broadest publicity to the Congress was given by direct radio broadcasting and extensive press coverage. Reports to the Congress were submitted by Josip Broz Tito, Aleksandar Rankoviƒá, Milovan ƒêilas, Edvard Kardelj, Boris Kidriƒç, Mo≈°a Pijade and Blagoje Ne≈°koviƒá. The Congress gave political support to the Central Committee in \\"defending the independence\\" of Yugoslavia. The decision was made unanimously, by which the unity of the party was \\"confirmed\\". The Congress also adopted the \\"Resolution on the position of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia towards Cominform\\", which concluded that decisions of Cominform were inaccurate and unjust, but it was emphasized that the Central Committee should do everything to overcome the conflict. At the end of the Congress, a new Central Committee consisting of 63 members, and a new Politburo consisting of 9 members, were elected.

Founded in 1833 and still in use today, the cemetery takes its name from its location in what was once the City of Lafayette, a suburb of New Orleans that was annexed by the larger metropolis in 1852. The city's first planned cemetery, it is notable for the architectural significance of its tombs and mausoleums, often containing multiple family members, and for its layout, a cruciform plan that allowed for funeral processions.

Her research and writing deals with the Hmong diaspora, other Southeast Asian diasporas and refugees and on community-building efforts among Hmong people in the United states. Vang is the author of the books Hmong in Minnesota and Hmong America : reconstructing community in diaspora. She is also the co-editor of Claiming Place: On the Agency of Hmong Women. Hmong in America has been described as \\"the first scholarly examination of the Hmong experience in the U.S.\\"  Biography  Vang was born in Laos on June 5, 1971. She was displaced by the Vietnam War and resettled in Saint Paul, Minnesota as a child. Her parents were farmers, both in Laos and in Minnesota. As a child, she and her siblings spent summers harvesting vegetables and selling crops alongside her parents. She received a bachelor's degree from Gustavus Adolphus College (1994), a master's degree (1996) and Ph.D. (2006) from the University of Minnesota. She began teaching at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in 2006 where she became the first Hmong tenure-track faculty member. There, she established an interdisciplinary Hmong Diaspora Studies program, of which she is the director. The program was developed in response to growing demands from Asian-American students calling for coursework that reflected their life experiences; the Hmong were the largest Asian ethnic group on campus, representing 2% of the student body. Vang is now a full professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and is the university's Associate Vice Chancellor for Global Inclusion and Engagement. Vang is married to Tong Yang. Together they have one daughter and two sons.  Scholarship  Vang is best known for her book 2010 Hmong America: reconstructing community in diaspora. Described as \\"both ethnography and an insider's account\\", the book's methods include \\"archival research, oral history interviews, and observations of community gatherings.\\" The book describes the migration of 130,000 Hmong from Southeast Asia to the United States following the Vietnam War, and the evolution of Hmong communities in the United States, starting with early networks based on kinship ties, and evolving into formal organizations and churches. It focuses on people who entered the United States as \\"refugees\\" rather than as \\"immigrants\\". It argues that the timing of the Hmong migration, coming after the societal shifts of the Civil Rights Era, gave Hmong people greater opportunity for social, economic, and cultural success in the United States than many waves of immigrants before them. Credit also goes to community leaders among the Hmong who used their loyalty to Americans and their opposition to communism during the Laotian Civil War to build social and political capital for their people. The book has been recognized for documenting the role of Hmong Christianity in the United States, in contrast to previous studies that focused on religion as a site of difference between non-Christian Hmong and a majority-Christian population in the United States. The book has been criticized for excessive focus on Hmong in Minnesota (the focus of Vang's first book) and in the upper Midwest to the exclusion of some other areas of Hmong resettlement such as Arkansas. In 2016, Vang co-edited and contributed a chapter to the book Claiming Place: On the Agency of Hmong Women, which argues that women's empowerment can occur within the Hmong cultural context, despite assumptions that Hmong culture oppresses women. Drawing on the fields of Gender studies and Postcolonial studies, the authors contend that Hmong women have evinced their agency in education, professional, entrepreneurial, spiritual, and domestic spheres.

Blockwalking is used by political parties and issue groups to identify supporters, persuade the undecided, add voters to the voters list through voter registration, and is central to get out the vote operations. It is the core element of what political campaigns call the ground game or field. Practice Blockwalking may be conducted by a candidate, volunteers, and/or paid canvassers. Blockwalkers are given lists known as walk lists (or access to a canvassing app). These are lists of households to be contacted, generated from a voter database. What used to be paper lists have been mostly replaced with lists on tablet or smartphone apps. The blockwalker will try to contact each of the households on their list, and deliver a script containing questions and persuasive messaging provided by the campaign. Almost all election blockwalking includes asking how a person plans to vote whereas issue blockwalking may be intent on getting individuals interested in particular issues. Supporters may then be asked themselves to vote, donate, volunteer, or to take a lawn sign.Michael McNamara. The Political Campaign Desk Reference: A Guide for Campaign Managers and Candidates Running for Elected Office Outskirts Press, 2008. pg. 123 People who are wavering or undecided may be given a message of persuasion. If no one is home the blockwalker will typically drop literature on the person‚Äôs door for them to read when they get home. During the blockwalk the results will be entered into the voter database. This will update the campaign's list of voters, removing those who have moved or are deceased and adding new supporters who may have been found. The data on the questions will be used for further contact, a supporter may be added to a list for get out the vote or fundraising, while a hostile voter might be dropped from future contact. In the United States, blockwalking hit its all-time low during the 1996 election, with the lowest reported rates of political volunteering, and the lowest recorded voter turnout. Political scientists began to reassess the effects of canvassing. In the United States Alan S. Gerber and Donald Green launched a series of controlled experiments, and demonstrated that blockwalking was one of the most effective tools available to boost voter turnout.

Lotto kept a detailed account book, which on 8 December 1540 mentions the arrival in his studio of a canvas already nailed to a frame. He removed and replaced that frame and support. This has been argued to show that the commission for the Antoninus was originally signed around 1525 and was the reason for Lotto's move from Bergamo to Venice, where he stayed in the Dominican monastery. His work on the painting may have been interrupted in July 1526, when the artist left the monastery in disgust at certain slanders circulating about him. He returned to the monastery and renewed the commission - his will of 1546 shows him wishing to be buried in its cemetery and in return renouncing part of the fee for the painting. The work went wholly unmentioned in Venice at the time of its production due to the intelligentsia's hostility to Lotto and preference for Titian and his followers.

At the same time, mechanisms for computing semantics of Argumentation frameworks were introduced as a way of providing a calculus of opposition for computing what it is reasonable to believe in the context of conflicting arguments. With these foundations in place, the area was kick- started by a workshop held in the Scottish Highlands in 2000, the result of which was a book coauthored by philosophers of argument, rhetoricians, legal scholars and AI researchers.Reed, C. & Norman, T.J. (eds) Argumentation Machines. Kluwer, 2003. Since then, the area has been supported by various dedicated events such as the International Workshop on Computational Models of Natural Argument (CMNA)Computational Models of Natural Argument which has run annually since 2001; the International Workshop on Argument in Multi Agent Systems (ArgMAS) annually since 2004; the Workshop on Argument Mining,Proceedings of Workshops on Argument Mining. annually since 2014, and the Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA),Computational Models of Argument conference series biennially since 2006. Since 2010, the field has also had its own journal, Argument & Computation,Journal of Argument & Computation which was published by Taylor & Francis until 2016Journal of Argument & Computation and since then by IOS Press. One of the challenges that Argument Technology faced was a lack of standardisation in the representation and underlying conception of argument in machine readable terms. Many different software tools for manual argument analysis, in particular, developed idiosyncratic and ad hoc ways of representing arguments which reflected differing underlying ways of conceiving of argumentative structure. This lack of standardisation also meant that there was no interchange between tools or between research projects, and little re-use of data resources that were often expensive to create. To tackle this problem, the Argument Interchange Format set out to establish a common standard that captured the minimal common features of argumentation which could then be extended in different settings. Argment technology has applications in a variety of domains, including education, healthcare, policy making, and risk management and has a variety of sub-fields, methodologies and technologies.Bex, Floris J., Floriana Grasso, Nancy Green, Fabio Paglieri, and Chris Reed. Argument Technologies: Theory, Analysis, and Applications. London: College Publications, 2017.  Technologies = Argument assistant = An argument assistant is a software which conveniences users when writing arguments. Argument assistants can convenience users as they compose content and as they review content from one other, including in dialogical contexts. In addition to Web services, such functionalities can be provided through the plugin architectures of word processor software or those of Web browsers. Internet forums, for instance, can be greatly enhanced by such software tools and services. = Argument blogging = ArguBlogging is software which allows its users to select portions of hypertext on webpages in their Web browsers and to agree or disagree with the selected content, posting their arguments to their blogs with linked argument data.Bex, Floris, Mark Snaith, John Lawrence, and Chris Reed. \\"Argublogging: An application for the argument web.\\" Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web 25 (2014): 9-15.

Such visual diagrams facilitate diagrammatic reasoning and promote one's ability to grasp and to make sense of information rapidly and readily. Argument maps can provide structured, semi- formal frameworks for representing arguments using interactive visual language. = Argument mining = Argument mining, or argumentation mining, is a research area within the natural language processing field. The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs. = Argument search = An argument search engine is a search engine that is given a topic as a user query and returns a list of arguments for and against the topic. Such engines could be used to support informed decision- making or to help debaters prepare for debates. = Automated argumentative essay scoring = The goal of automated argumentative essay scoring systems is to assist students in improving their writing skills by measuring the quality of their argumentative content.Green, Nancy L. \\"Towards automated analysis of student arguments.\\" In International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, pp. 591-594. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2013. = Debate technology = Debate technology focuses on human-machine interaction and in particular providing systems that support, monitor and engage in debate. One of the most high-profile examples of debating technology is IBM's Project Debater which combines scripted communication with very large-scale processing of news articles to identify and construct arguments on the fly in a competitive debating setting. Debating technology also encompasses tools aimed at providing insight into debates, typically using techniques from data science. These analytics have been developed in both academic and commercial settings.http://analytics.arg.tech/ https://www.kialo.com/ = Decision support system = Argument technology can enhance decision support systems and intelligent decision support systems.

Greeks of the Classical age accepted Mopsus as a historical figure, though the anecdotes concerning him bridge legend and myth.  Mythology  Mopsus (and perhaps a tradition of his heirs, like the Melampodidae, the Iamidae from Olympia or the Eumolpidae at Eleusis) officiated at the altars of Apollo at Klaros, which he founded; at Klaros the tradition was that he had been the son of a daughter of the seer Teiresias named Manto, literally \\"seeress\\".Strabo, xiv.4.3; Pausanias, vii.3.2; Pomponius Mela, i.88, and T.J. Scheer, Mythische Vorv√§ter: zur Bedeutung griechischer Heroenmythen im Sebstverst√§ndnis kleinasiatischer St√§dte, 1993:164-68, are all noted by Lane Fox 2008:213 note 17. His unerring wisdom and discernment gave rise to the ancient Greek proverb, \\"more certain than Mopsus\\". He distinguished himself at the siege of Thebes; but he was held in particular veneration at the court of Amphilochus at Colophon on the Ionian coast of Asia Minor, adjacent to Caria. The 12th century Byzantine mythographer John TzetzesIn his scholia on the poet Lycophron. reports anecdotes of the prowess of Mopsus. Having been consulted, on one occasion, by Amphilochus, who wished to know what success would attend his arms in a war which he was going to undertake, he predicted the greatest calamities; but Calchas, who had been the soothsayer of the Greeks during the Trojan War, promised the greatest successes. Amphilochus followed the opinion of Calchas, but the prediction of Mopsus was fully verified. This had such an effect upon Calchas that he died soon after. His death is attributed by sources used by John Tzetzes to another mortification of the same nature: in this case, the two soothsayers, jealous of each other's fame, came to a different trial of their skill in divination. Calchas first asked his antagonist how many figs a neighboring tree bore; ten thousand and one, replied Mopsus. The figs were gathered, and his answer was found to be true. Mopsus now, to try his adversary, asked him how many young ones a certain pregnant sow would bring forth, and at what time. Calchas confessed his inability to answer, whereupon Mopsus declared that she would be delivered on the morrow, and would bring forth ten young ones, of which only one would be a male. The morrow proved the veracity of his prediction, and Calchas died through the grief which his defeat produced.John Tzetzes. Ad Lycophron, 427. Amphilochus subsequently having occasion to visit Argos, entrusted the sovereign power to Mopsus, to keep it for him during the space of a year. On his return, however, Mopsus refused to restore to him the kingdom,Compare the archaic tradition of the year-king. whereupon, having quarreled, they engaged and slew each other.John Tzetzes. Ad Lycophron, 440. According to another legend reported by Tzetzes,John Tzetzes. Ad Lycophron, 980. he was slain by Herakles. Mopsus was venerated as founder in several cities of Pamphylia and the Cilician plain, among them Mopsuestia, \\"the house (hestia) of Mopsus\\" in Cilicia, and Mallos, where he quarreled with his co-founder Amphilochus and both were buried in tumuli, from which neither could see that of the other.

The sieges took place after Thuljaji, the Rajah of Tanjore, provided fewer levies and money than the British had required him to and invaded lands claimed by the Arcot State.  History  From 1766 to 1769, the British East India Company, the Maratha Confederacy, and the Arcot State (also known as the Carnatics) waged a war against the Kingdom of Mysore, a nation led by Hyder Ali. To fight Hyder's armies, the Anglo-Maratha-Carnatic alliance employed a large number of levied soldiers and mercenaries from various vassal and allied states. These states were also expected to provide financial aid to their allies. However, one of these states, the Rajdom of Tanjore, was noted as having provided a smaller contingent of forces during the Mysore War than other states had. It was also revealed that Thuljajil the Rajah of Tanjore, had been in communication with Hyder Ali; these actions earned the Raj the enmity of the British and the Arcots. In 1769, forces of the Rajdom of Tanjore invaded the tribal lands of the Marawars, which the Arcot State claimed were its subjects. The Nabob of the Arcot State, Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah, demanded that the Tanjors withdraw, but this request was rebuked. In response to this rejection, Wallajah contacted the British, who agreed to gather an army at Trichinopoly to drive out the Tanjore forces. The British forces were led by General Joseph Smith, while the Carnatic forces were led by Wallajah's son. The allied army advanced on the city of Tanjore, and laid siege to the city on 22 September 1769. The besieging army succeeded in breaching the city's wall on 22 October, and plans were made to storm the city. However, the commander of the Carnatic army instead chose to negotiate with Thuljaji. On the evening before the assault was to take place, the Carantic commander informed Smith that the Rajah of Tanjore had surrendered. The British were insulted by the separate peace, but were able to remain in control of a border town that had captured during the conflict. One source records that 158 \\"europeans\\" and 281 \\"natives\\" were killed during the siege. Following the victory at Tanjore, the British army helped the Carnatics officially conquer the Marawar chiefs in 1772, whom the allies had recently liberated. In 1773, the Carnatics claimed that the Rajah of Tanjore had violated their treaty, and so the British and Carnatic forces returned to Tanjore and laid siege to the city a second time. The city walls were breached and stormed, resulting in the second fall of the city. Both the British and Carnatics won new concessions from the Rajah of Tanjore, who was later restored to his throne at the insistence of the East India Company.

Early life  Davidenko was born on 26 February 1914 in Danilovka, Volgograd Oblast. He studied at the Leningrad Hydrotechnical Institute between 1930-32 while working part-time as the operator at the Kulakov factory. In 1932, Davidenko continued his studies at the Leningrad Industrial Institute, graduating with honors. Starting in 1937, he worked for three years at the Leningrad Institute of Physics and Technology. In 1940, Davidenko worked part-time as an engineer for Plant No. 379 of the People's Commissariat of Aviation Industry of the USSR. Before he returned to Moscow, Davidenko was evacuated to the Kazan plant No.122 and 149 (under the Commissariat) after the USSR underwent Operation Barbarossa. The details of Davidenko's work at these aircraft factories are mostly unknown.  Soviet Atomic Bomb Project  In May 1943, Davidenko and many other scientists joined Igor Kurchatov's Laboratory No.2 of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. He was admired for his knowledge, meticulousness and modesty. From 1943-45, three types of nuclear reactor designs were developed there: heavy water reactors, graphite-water reactors, and uranium-fueled water reactors. Davidenko worked with Georgy Flyorov (the discoverer of spontaneous fission with Konstantin Petrzhak) in studying reactor technology. In May 1948, Kurchatov's group, together with a number of other scientists, was directed to the All-Russian Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics or KB-11 in the closed city of Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast, as part of the Soviet nuclear weapons program. While there, he witnessed a deception during an unexpected visit by Lavrentiy Beria, the feared head of Soviet security and the politician in charge of the nuclear program under Stalin. Kurchatov was in the middle of querying the beveled edge on a plutonium hemisphere, when ‚Äì reacting quickly before Beria and his entourage ‚Äì he directed Yakov Zel'dovich to double-check the calculations, which Zel'dovich 'confirmed' to Kurchatov's satisfaction shortly afterwards. Kurchatov put Davidenko in charge of one of three teams working simultaneously on neutron primers for nuclear bombs. The laboratory of the chemist Vitaly Aleksandrovich was selected to continue but Davidenko's laboratory provided equipment. He became director of Department 4 of the 'Installation' ‚Äì the experimental nuclear research department ‚Äì in 1952. Starting that year, he had repeatedly and strongly encouraged the theoretical physicists Andrei Sakharov and Zel'dovich to pursue the route of atomic implosion to compress thermonuclear fuel for a hydrogen bomb in a two- stage device. In November, he and Sakharov went to a laboratory in Leningrad where preparations were being made to monitor radiation from an upcoming nuclear test. While there, they collected newly-fallen snow to concentrate and analyse for radionuclides from the U.S.'s Operation Ivy test earlier that month at Enewetak Atoll. The concentrate was mistakenly thrown away by another chemist. Davidenko was already amongst several employees of the Installation who were considered too important to risk flying; for example, in 1953 he returned from preparations at the Semipalatinsk Test Site in Kazakhstan for the RDS-6 device ‚Äì the first Soviet hydrogen bomb ‚Äì in chief nuclear weapons designer Yuli Khariton's train carriage with other scientists. After detonation of that device, he was awarded the title Hero of Socialist Labour and in October was awarded the degree of candidate of the physical and mathematical sciences. In January 1955, his suggestions about an atomic implosion as the first stage in a two-stage thermonuclear device were finally accepted by the theorists. On 14 January, Zel'dovich wrote a note to Khariton outlining the preliminary design scheme, with the following line: \\"The A.I. [atomic implosion] idea is due to Viktor Aleksandrovich Davidenko.\\" The introduction to the final report by Sakharov and Zel'dovich on 25 June stated, \\"The participation of V. A. Davidenko was extremely profitable in the discussion of the problem during its early stage (1952).\\" He became a doctor and professor of physico-mathematical sciences and deputy supervisor of the Institute in 1957. In 1959, he stated (privately) a deep admiration for his long-time boss Kurchatov, but insisted that Kurchatov was \\"first and foremost an 'operator', and what's more, an operator under Stalin.\\" He remained at KB-11 until 1963, when he was seconded to the Kurchatov Institute. Later, he worked at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. He is buried in Kuntsevo Cemetery.

Prince Norodom Ekcharin was thought to have died as a child in 1976 during the Khmer Rouge regime, but he survived after being secretly brought to Thailand, and later grew up in Sweden and is since 2014 finally reunited with his family. Personal life When Norodom Ekcharin was born in 1969 his parents Prince Norodom Yuvaneath, being the oldest son of the late king of Cambodia, Norodom Sihanouk, and his wife Tea Kim Yin was living at the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh. Six months later, Yuvaneath, his wife and their three-year-old son Veakchearavouth went for a short time mission in Hong Kong, leaving Ekcharin in the care of his grandparents, with the plan that they soon would return, but after the coup by General Lon Nol (1970) they were not permitted to enter the country and Yuvaneath's family fled to Beijing, where they lived until 1980, when Yuvaneath moved his family to Connecticut in the United States, assuming that Ekcharin had died in Phnom Penh in 1976. But during the 1975-1979 turmoil after the Khmer Rouge captured Phnom Penh, Ekcharins relatives in Phnom Penh brought him to a hideout close to a refugee camp in Surin Province, on the Thai/Cambodian Border, from where he later reached Sweden. He grew up in Stockholm, having diffuse memories about his parentage, except that his father was a Prince, which he was instructed to never tell anyone. When growing older, his interest for his roots increased, and he came in contact with his youngest sister, and later the rest of the family, who lived in the United States. His family soon confirmed his identity, the royal court in Phnom Penh appointed him the official status as Prince, and the Chilean royal biographer Julio A Jeldres played a pivotal role in re-establishing connections as well as the update on Ekcharins destiny, which he released in an update of his book The Royal House of Cambodia.LinkedIn: Charin NorodomNorodom Veakcharin, prince of CambodiaUpdated edition provides insight into lives and lineage of Cambodia‚Äôs royals After nearly 200 workers passed out in one week at a Cambodian factory supplying the Swedish multinational clothing-retail company H&M;, Norodom Ekcharin has on several occasions confronted H&M; regarding the difficult working conditions and low salaries for their local textile workers employed in Cambodia, and tried to bring this to public attention through numerous interviews in papers and in the Swedish TV4-documentation Kalla Fakta (cold facts).H&M; duckar f√∂r kambodjansk prins Swedish outcry has royal voice in midst, Phnom Penh Post, Read 11 november 2018.A Transnational Crisis that Tested H&M;‚Äôs Commitments, Phnom Penh Post, Read 15 november 2018.

His brother, John Walter Cross, a commission agent, was the husband of the English novelist Mary Anne (n√©e Evans) Cross, known by her pen name George Eliot, having married her a few months before her death in 1880. He was educated at Marlborough College in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England. Career After his move to America following his graduation from College, he began working as railroad official, first in New Orleans then in New York. His uncle, William Wood, worked in New York at Dennistoun, Wood & Co. Cross later became a member of the New York banking firm of Morton, Bliss & Co., led by former New York Governor Levi P.

He is noted for his homoerotic, hyperreal drawings of men, and for his use of digital illustration in his artwork. Biography Jiraiya was born in 1967 to a working-class family in Sapporo, Japan. In the late 1980s, he discovered the gay magazine , and was influenced by the artwork by Gengoroh Tagame published in the magazine. In his twenties, Jiraiya worked as a mangaka for Shogakukan, and later as a graphic designer. His career as a gay manga artist began in 1998 when, at the age of 31, he submitted to and was published in the magazine G-men. He became the exclusive cover artist for G-men in 2001, replacing Gengoroh Tagame following his departure from the magazine, and illustrated the covers for issues 63 to 124 (2001 to 2006). In addition to cover illustrations, Jiraiya contributed manga to G-men. In his private life, Jiraiya works as a commercial advertising designer and is closeted. Consequently, he is notoriously reclusive, rarely makes public appearances, and does not publish photographs of his face. Style Jiraiya specializes in pin-up art of hypermasculine men with large, muscular builds, and was one of the first gay manga artists to use digital illustration extensively in his work. He is noted for his hyperreal drawing style, the result of a process in which he creates a freehand sketch from a photographic reference of body parts from different men collaged into a single figure, which he then augments with Photoshop, Illustrator, and QuarkXPress. Japanese iconography figures heavily into Jiraiya's artwork, including kendo and judo uniforms, Buddhist monks, festival costumes, and fundoshi. His narrative works are typically comic and light-hearted in tone, contrasting the sadomasochistic material of his peers, and deal with themes of group sex, romance, and athletic competition. Works=Publishing= Jiraiya has published three major collections of manga: , , and . Two anthologies his art have been published: The Art of Jiraiya by French publisher H&O; in 2007, and Art Works of Jiraiya: 1998‚Äì2012 by Japanese publisher Furukawa Shobou in 2012. In 2014, works by Jiraiya were included in Massive: Gay Erotic Manga and the Men Who Make It, the first English-language anthology of gay manga. Two d≈çjinshi by Jiraiya, Caveman Guu and Two Hoses, were translated into English by Massive Goods in 2013 and 2017, respectively. =Fashion= In addition to publishing, Jiraiya has collaborated with multiple fashion houses to release products featuring his artwork. In June 2014, Opening Ceremony launched a line of products featuring Jiraiya's artwork for Pride Month, including apparel, accessories, and a Tenga sex toy. A t-shirt collaboration between Jiraiya, Massive, and Mission Chinese Food was also launched that same year. In 2015, Opening Ceremony and Jiraiya released a second collaboration, titled \\"Power-Up Massive\\". Pretty Snake, a fashion brand founded by Project Runway contestant Joe Segal, launched a line of swim briefs with artwork by Jiraiya in 2015. =\\"The Best Couple\\"= In November 2013, Massive Goods released \\"The Best Couple,\\" a sweatshirt featuring an illustration of two original characters created by Jiraiya, Asakichi (ÊúùÂêâ) and Seiji (Ê∏ÖÊ¨°). The characters would later appear as the subjects of \\"LOVE IS MASSIVE\\", a 2016 illustration created by Jiraiya to raise funds for the victims of the Orlando nightclub shooting. Two Hoses, a 2017 d≈çjinshi by Jiraiya, outlines the backstory of The Best Couple as two firefighters drawn together by a near-death experience. Impact Along with Gengoroh Tagame, Jiraiya is regarded as one of the most influential and prolific creators of gay manga; Anne Ishii, the co-founder of Massive Goods, has stated that \\"if Tagame is the dark father of Japanese gay manga, Jiraiya is the fairy godmother.\\" He has been compared to Tom of Finland in reference to the cultural impact of his work, and Martin Margiela in reference to his reclusiveness. His art has been praised for depicting East Asian men as physically strong and sexually desirable, subverting stereotypical portrayals of East Asian men as emasculated and asexual. His fashion designs have gained popularity in the LGBTQ hip hop scene, and have been worn by Tinashe, Cazwell, and Blood Orange.

The exoplanet's discovery by an international team of astronomers ‚Äì including the European Southern Observatory and Carnegie Institution for Science ‚Äì was officially announced on 14 November 2018. It is the first confirmed planet orbiting Barnard's Star, which is six light-years away from Earth. Characteristics Barnard's Star b technically remains a planet candidate as it has been proposed with a confidence figure of 99%. The research team that made the announcement will continue observations to ensure that no improbable variations in brightness and motion in the star might account for the discovery. Direct imaging opportunities of the planet from large ground-based telescopes, or potentially the WFIRST telescope, are expected within ten years of 2018. There is an outside chance that a transit of the star might also allow for imaging. The planet was proposed through the radial velocity method, the most common planet-hunting technique. A \\"wobble\\" observed in Barnard's Star's motion was confirmed to have a period of about 233 days, corresponding to a semi-major axis of 0.4 AU for a proposed companion. The mass of the likely planetary body was then deduced to be about 3.2 Earth mass. Analysis was careful and extensive. Lead astronomer Ignasi Ribas notes: \\"We used observations from seven different instruments, spanning 20 years of measurements, making this one of the largest and most extensive datasets ever used for precise radial-velocity studies.\\" Barnard's Star b is expected to be frigid, with an equilibrium temperature of around . Its orbital distance, though close to the star by solar system standards, is around the snow line for a dim red dwarf like Barnard's Star. This is the point where volatile compounds such as water condense to form ice and thus outside the assumed habitable zone where temperatures are right for surficial liquid water. However, new research suggests that heat generated by geothermal processes could warm pockets of water beneath the surface of the planet, potentially providing havens for life to evolve. Astronomers expect to find more such \\"snow line\\" planets as proto-planetary accretion is favorable in this temperature range. A second planetary companion for Barnard's Star has been suggested based on unconfirmed \\"wobbles\\" in the current system.

In: trauer.nordkurier.de. Nordkurier, Published 7 July 2018, Retrieved 18 April 2019.) was a Nazi S.S. medic who served in several concentration camps during the second world war. After serving 3 years in prison following the war, Zafke settled in Gnevkow, Germany where he married and raised four sons and worked in an agricultural company. However, 71 years after the end of the war, following preliminary investigations by the central office for the investigation of Nazi crimes Zafke stood trial for 3861 counts of accessory to murder. After a lengthy trial delayed multiple times by Zafke's failing health, the trial was dropped as Zafke was found to be unfit for trial.  Early life  Ernst Hubert Zafke was born on the 26th of September 1920 in Pomerania (in Modern-day Poland) to a farming family. He grew up on his parents‚Äô farm, attended elementary school and joined an agricultural college. He joined the Hitler Youth in 1933 at age 13 and 6 years later, at the age of 19, the Waffen SS.  World War 2 and post-war  From 1940 to 1944, Zafke served as a paramedic with the SS. He trained at a medical school which belonged to the Dachau concentration camp facility. From 1942 to 1943, Zafke served at the Neuengamme concentration camp, where he worked as a medic. There, he was promoted to Unterscharf√ºhrer (junior squad leader). From 15 August to 14 September 1944, Zafke served at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in Poland. During this period, 14 deportation trains arrived at Auschwitz (one carrying famous diarist Anne Frank), and thousands of Jews were murdered in Auschwitz's gas chambers. On September 26, Zafke left along with 400 Jewish women to Neustadt concentration camp. Zafke had left prior to the liberation of the camp by Soviet forces. After the war ended in 1945, Zafke was arrested by British troops stationed in West Germany and handed over to the Polish government. As he was a member of the SS, he was sentenced on the 10th of March 1948 by the Krak√≥w district court to 4 years in prison. After being released from prison Zafke settled in Gnevkow, a small village in northeastern Germany. He married and had four sons. Working in a company specializing in agricultural products and pesticides, he lived a normal life in Germany. Though he was questioned by the authorities several times, his identity was never questioned and he lived a normal life in occupied Germany.  Retrial  Following the fall of the Berlin wall and the reunification of Germany, many archived records were made accessible to the public. Thus, Zafke and many other former Nazis came onto the radar of Nazi hunters. In 2013, German federal prosecutors began another investigation into Nazi members who had served in concentration camps, such as Zafke. In 2016, Zafke was arrested and charged with 3,861 counts of accessory to murder. The charges were focused only on the time he served at Auschwitz-Birkenau, from August 15 to September 14, 1944. For the first time, official evidence and eyewitnesses were not necessary, as official records had already proven that Zafke had indeed served at Auschwitz and that was enough evidence to prove Zafke knew about the murders. According to the Daily Mail, Zafke does not deny his service at Auschwitz, instead claiming that 'I heard nothing, saw nothing, killed no one'. Zafke was scheduled to stand trial in February 2016; however, this was overturned by the Judge who decided that Zafke's various medical issues made him unfit for trial. This order was again overturned by the Court of Appeals, stating that Zafke was indeed physically able to stand trial. The main highlight of the trial was that as Zafke had served at Auschwitz and knew about the murders that were continuously occurring in the facility's gas chambers. Several previous trials had been conducted previously in this fashion, including the trials of John Demjanjuk in 2011, Reinhold Hanning in 2016 and the trial of Oskar Gr√∂ning in 2015. However, Zafke's lawyers argue that Zafke, who suffers from dementia and depression due to late-stage Alzheimer's disease, is unfit for trial. After numerous delays caused by Zafke's failing health, the trial was set for October 16, 2016. However, this was further delayed due to Zafke's health. In June 2017, three judges responsible for repeatedly delaying the trial due to Zafke's failing health were removed after multiple complaints of bias. However, after two examinations in March and July 2017, the case was dropped as Zafke was deemed unfit for trial. According to the BBC, a court spokesperson stated that \\"the defendant is no longer able to reasonably assess his interests\\".

The town depended entirely upon the operations of the Pittsburgh-Buffalo Company, controlled by the Jones interests. John H. Jones, president of the company, residing there all the year round. The town was supplied with water and sewerage facilities. The amusement hall in the town contained standard bowling alleys, billiard and pool tables, a refreshment stand, and a large roller skating rink, which was also used for a meeting place. The town consisted of 140 frame houses, sixteen brick residences, a store, schoolhouse, and the Johnetta Memorial Church, presided over by Rev. Walter Kennedy. The houses were heated by gas taken from the company's own wells. The population was 662, of which about 500 are employees of the company. The Johnetta Plant of the United States Sewer Pipe Company utilized the Kittanning clay for the manufacture of refractory products. This clay immediately underlaid the Kittanning coal, which was mined in advance of the clay, and which found a ready market at the northern lake ports.[citation needed] The clay seam was about 15 feet in thickness, of exceptional purity, and adapted to the manufacture of pavers, high-grade face brick and sewer pipe.[citation needed] A post office called Johnetta was established in 1900. It was operational until 1929.

She made history by being the first transgender person to be elected to that body in Brazil in its over 180 years of existence. Da Silva created the urban quilombo Aparelha Luzia, a black cultural space that brings people of African descent together in solidarity, and is also a space for art, discussion, and performances surrounding the idea of blackness and black culture. Shortly after high school, da Silva moved to S√£o Paulo and began to embrace her transgender identity through her official transition. After graduating from University of S√£o Paulo, she spent time working as an artist, activist, and educator. Da Silva's election platform had five major features: Political Renewal, Enlargement of the Debate, the idea of the Quilombo, Fundamental Rights, and Political Challenges. Early life and identity Malunguinho da Silva was born 20 November 1981 in Recife, Pernambuco. She was assigned a male at birth, was raised by her mother and extended family, and grew up in Recife, Pernambuco.\\"√ârica Malunguinho Da Silva.\\" Elei√ß√µes. 2018. https://www.eleicoes2018.com/erica-malunguinho/ The surname \\"Malunguinho\\" refers to the cult of Jurema Sagrada, an entity of the forests of Pernambuco in Catuc√°. This is a region where her ancestors passed through. The term \\"Malungo\\" is used by African descendants of the Bantu family to mean \\"comrade\\" or \\"companion\\". This is the way in which the enslaved would refer to another person who, like them, had crossed the ocean and started a new life. The trans, black, Afro-Brazilian woman's mother, the only educated one in the family, worked as a nurse to support da Silva, her siblings, and the other members of the house. Da Silva grew up immersed in black and indigenous culture. \\"We all knew we were Black, but when you are Black in Brazil, you also suffer racism within the family,\\" she said. \\"We were always comparing who had the widest nose, or the nappiest hair.\\"Freelon, Kiratiana. \\"Trans Activist √ârica Malunguinho Reps Black Brazil.\\" AFROPUNK. 4 October 2018. http://afropunk.com/2018/10/trans-activist-erica-malunguinho-reps-black- brazil/ After high school, da Silva felt as if she \\"had to live another life\\". She moved to S√£o Paulo when she was 19 with the idea of reinventing herself.

In addition to setting up her studio in the neighborhood of Campos Eliseos in S√£o Paulo, da Silva has also spent the last 15 years working as an activist and educator. She has worked on training teachers from the public and private spheres on themes related to art, culture, and politics. Aparelha Luzia In 2016, da Silva transformed her art studio into the cultural and political center Aparelha Luzia. It is an urban quilombo, and has quickly become known as one of the most influential and important black cultural spaces in Brazil. A quilombo is a Brazilian \\"maroon\\" society that symbolizes the first act of resistance to slavery. Quilombos today are usually rural black communities that uphold their African heritage and culture and their struggles against racism. Aparelha Luzia is seen as one of the most prominent centers of black resistance, bringing together black people to find shelter against the racism they face on a daily basis. In addition, it is also considered a place to present artistic and intellectual productions with a goal of spreading the cultural and political production of blackness. The quilombo, also hosts parties, courses, formations, debates, birthdays, and it is a place for black people to connect and focus on black issues. Aparelha Luzia is housed in a 10,000-square-foot warehouse and nearly every day of the week it features live music, art, and get-togethers. Da Silva created it so there is no entrance fee, due to her commitment to the space being open to as many people as possible. Although Aparelha Luiza is managed through a collective, it is da Silva's dream that has brought over 200,000 people to the quilombo over the last two years. She has advocated for black people of all gender and sexual identities to feel included, accepted, and sheltered. Political career At 36, da Silva became the first transgender woman to be elected to state congress in Brazil.Langlois, Jill. \\"An Indigenous Woman and a Trans Woman Will Hold Office in Brazil for the First Time Amid a Conservative Wave.\\" The Washington Post. 11 October 2018. https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global- opinions/wp/2018/10/11/an-indigenous-woman-and-a-trans-woman-will-hold-office- in-brazil-for-the-first-time-amid-a-conservative-wave One of her major motivations to run was the assassination of Marielle Franco, an LGBTQ Afro- Brazilian politician. \\"I cried a lot when I heard about Marielle‚Äôs murder.

Her coalition is \\"Without Fear of Changing S√£o Paulo.\\" Da Silva is motivated to fight racism through social tourism in the quilombos and indigenous territories as a strategy to combat discrimination and advocate for protection and visibility of minorities, as well as promote a sustainable economy. She has also promised to fight for the rights of the LGBTQ community and has claimed she would focus on the fundamental rights of trans people and their inclusion in the workforce. Additionally, da Silva plans on supporting proposals that benefit homeless people and review housing programs. She desires to promote a compassionate reception in hospitals and police stations for survivors of sexual assault, and advocate for the guarantee of civil and tolerant care for women seeking abortions. =Campaign platform= Da Silva ran for congress on a platform with five major features. The first feature was political renewal. Although da Silva enjoyed grassroots work, she made it known that she saw politics in her future. She believed that the present was the time to create a new political narrative that went against the same groups being represented in politics. She understood that she had a responsibility in relation to the arts, education, LGBTQ, and black movements to focus on the intersectionalities within the framework of institutional policy. The second feature of her platform was \\"enlargement of the debate.\\" Knowing that politics is interrelated to people's everyday lives, she promoted the connection of civil society to politics. She believed that people tend to forget that politics is created by, and has impacts on real people, some of whom have been marginalized throughout history through political institutions. She believed that the political process has dehumanized itself to the point that people do not realize that the person representing them is a real person‚Äînot just a machine. She thought that people needed to consider politics as closer to them than they tended to think. The third feature was centered on the idea of the Quilombo. Da Silva is the founder of the urban quilombo Aparelha Luzia. The idea of a quilombo as a social institution and an organized self-managed society was one of the major foundations of her candidacy. She believed that quilombos should be thought of as political spaces in order to build understanding and deconstruct the popular narratives of those who have been marginalized. Quilombos can bring people together to collaborate and write their own story. The fourth feature is Fundamental Rights. Da Silva believed that today's political representatives lack the bravery and motivation needed in order to understand the inequalities and practices of marginalization based on race, gender, and class. As a result, we need politicians who are willing to fight for those who are excluded in today's society. Da Silva has been willing to focus on this systematic oppression, and made it a pillar in her campaign. She would promote the idea of pushing the limits in government in the fields of mobility, economy, health, education, culture, media, and religious freedom in order to advocate for the people who have historically, and continue to be, left out of the political discussion. The fifth and final feature is Political Challenges. As a black, transgender woman, da Silva realized that putting yourself into politics is not as simple as it seems. Nonetheless, she knew it was something that needs to be done. She faced a bench that is representative of the majority population, (white, heterosexual, cisgender men) along with those who have historically wielded power, and she hoped to propose a new outlook on society and a new way of doing politics.Da Silva, Vitoria R√©gia. \\"New Names: Meet Erica Malunguinho, Pre-Candidate for State Deputy of S√£o Paulo.\\" G√™nero E N√∫mero. 14 June 2018. http://www.generonumero.media/novos-nomes-conheca-erica-malunguinho-pre- candidata-deputada-estadual-de-sao-paulo/ =Controversies and challenges= Da Silva states that she faces many challenges due to her identity. Brazil is one of the most deadly countries for transgender people, with 179 reported murders in the year 2017. This is the highest number in a decade. Additionally, black women are acutely underrepresented in Brazil's government. After this most recent election in 2018, Brazil's Senate had no increase in representation in the Upper House, with black women still holding 12 out of 81 seats. The Lower House, however, saw a five percent increase in black women representatives, from previously holding 51 seats, to an increase with 77 seats out of 513. Another challenge da Silva will states she will face comes from Jair Bolsonaro. Bolsonaro is a divisive far-right politician who has just been elected as the 38th president of Brazil. He won 55 percent of the vote after a runoff against Fernando Haddad of the Leftist Workers' Party (PT). Throughout his campaign he has played on the public's fears about security and a recent increase in violent crime. (In 2017, homicide rates rose to a record high of 63,880, a 2.9 percent increase from 2016.) As a former army captain, Bolsonaro has claimed that he will combat the security crisis by militarizing the police, increasing pressure on criminals by allowing police officers greater weapons privileges, and decreasing restrictions on public gun possession. Bolsonaro has faced criticism throughout the election due to his past controversial and discriminatory statements about race, gender, and sexual orientation.Child, David. \\"Who Is Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil's New Far- right President?\\" GCC News  Al Jazeera. 29 October 2018. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/10/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-presidential- candidate-181007020716337.html Bolsonaro has remarked that black people living in the traditional communities of quilombos were not even good for procreating anymore. During his campaign he pledged to get rid of protected indigenous lands. He has regarded having a female child as a \\"weakness\\", and said that women should not be employed equally, and should earn less than men because they \\"get more labour rights than men\\". Additionally, he has said stated that a fellow lawmaker was not worth raping because she was \\"too ugly\\" and not his \\"type\\". In a 2011 interview, Bolsonaro was quoted for saying that if he were to have a gay son, he would prefer for him to die in an accident than be homosexual, since Bolsonaro would never be able to love him.\\"Jair Bolsonaro: Brazil's Firebrand Leader Dubbed the Trump of the Tropics.\\" BBC News. 29 October 2018. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45746013 He has also been taken to court for hate speech in the past.

It is native to Florida but may be found in the surrounding states, though this is not confirmed. This species can be hard to differentiate from Solenopsis texana and S. carolinensis, but there are a few minor differences, such as having a longer scape and a wider petiole. Thus, the main method used to distinguish these species primarily uses queens and males, though unfortunately usually only workers are collected, making it difficult to correctly identify this species. S. molesta is known to nest in rotten wood in pine‚Äìoak forests, and workers have been collected from leaf litter in said forests.  Etymology  The species' name abdita is a Latin word meaning \\"concealed\\". This is a reference to this species' visual similarity with S. carolinensis and S. texana and others in the molesta complex which makes this species hard to identify and had helped to delay the process of describing the species.  Appearance  Workers in this species are colored yellow and measure 1.1-1.3mm(0.04-0.05 inches) in length, and are almost identical in appearance to carolinensis and texana, as well as other Floridian species of the molesta complex. Queens appear brown to dark brown, possessing white wings; these reproductive females, along with males, are the main evidence used towards identifying this species, as they are easily distinguishable from reproductive ants of other species.

It replaced two earlier all- black high schools, the first founded in 1927. From that time until integration, there was only one high school for blacks in all of Montgomery County, Maryland. History The first high school for black children in Montgomery County, Maryland, originally opened in 1927 as Rockville Colored High School with 40 students. Built partly with money from the Julius Rosenwald Fund, the two-classroom building stood next to the two-room Rockville Colored Elementary School. Both were wooden buildings that shared one bathroom. The county did not initially provide transportation so parents and the black community pooled resources to buy a used bus. In 1935, the school was replaced by a larger wooden building--covered with bricks to match white high schools--nearby in Rockville and was then known as Lincoln High School. It was soon overcrowded, just as the earlier, smaller high school became. In 1937, represented by Thurgood Marshall, Rockville Colored Elementary School principal William B. Gibbs, Jr. sued the Montgomery County School Board over its practice of paying white teachers nearly double what black ones earned. This resulted in equal pay at all the county's black elementary schools and the high school as well by 1938. When built in 1950, George Washington Carver High School operated with roughly equal funding with the white schools and was fully accredited. A new brick building with eight classrooms on the first floor, and large science and home economics labs on the second floor, it offered junior college-level courses as well. This was the first post-high school opportunity for black children in Montgomery County, as Montgomery Junior College, located in Takoma Park, was for whites only. The Carver Class of 1960 was the school's last, the first black elementary schools were closed in 1955 with the remainder by 1961. Black students were distributed to formerly all-white schools throughout the county. Because some schools remained all-white, they were integrated by transferring black teachers from Carver and other schools. The board took over the facility for its administrative offices, dropping the Carver name, but restored the name after a petition by the NAACP and local black ministers. In 2002, the building was named a Rockville Historic District.

Surrounding areas such as Nassau County have similar laws. The bill was enacted in 1981 in response to the Hellerstein decision (Hellerstein v. Assessor of Islip, 37 N.Y.2d 1 (1975)). The law is embodied in Article 18 of the New York State Real Property Law. The most significant portions of the law are the creation of tax classes, the limitation on assessment increases for small homes (1 to 3 family homes called Class 1) and for other residential property with 10 units or less (a subset of Class 2), the setting of an upper limit for the \\"assessed value\\" as a percentage of \\"market value\\" across the different tax classes, and the limitation on the increase allowed in the allocation of the tax levy across the different tax classes from the previous year's assessment roll.  History  S.7000-A was a reaction to the Hellerstein decision (Hellerstein v. Assessor of Islip, 37 N.Y.2d 1 (1975)). There was discussion of a 100% re- assessment of all properties in New York State. A group called State Coalition Against 100% Re-Assessment (SCAR) fought for 5 years to stop 100% re- assessment of properties and eventually helped enact S.7000-A There was much debate before S.7000-A was enacted. These are some of the quotes: \\"The Hellerstein decision has thrown into complete chaos the entire basis on which New York City and New York State always raised tax revenue,‚Äù said Assemblyman Brian Sharoff, Brooklyn Democrat in 1976. Brian Sharoff was chairman of the State Assembly Committee on Real Property Taxation at the time. ‚ÄúIt has threatened directly the middle‚Äêclass taxpayer with the possibility of increases of two or three times in taxes. There would be substantial dislocations in urban areas.‚Äù = Before S.7000-A = Before the S.7000-A law was passed, New York State assessors typically used fractional assessments. Usually, properties were assessed when they were built and never reassessed. Over 100 years or more, this caused large discrepancies between older buildings assessed values and newer construction assessed values. = Assessment system found unconstitutional = On June 5, 1975, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled that the New York State's property tax assessment system violated the state constitution. An initial attempt was made by an Albany New York Panel to assess all property at full valuation. The proposal was defeated by groups such as State Coalition Against 100% Re-Assessment (SCAR). In order to bring the assessment law in compliance with the New York State Constitution, the New York State leadership proposed to set up two systems, one for New York City and Nassau County and one for the rest of the state. The bill called S.7000-A was vetoed by then Governor Hugh Carey on November 11, 1981. In a rare occurrence, the New York State Legislature overrode the Governor's veto on December 4, 1981.  Key components of the law = Definitions = The key terms to understand in property tax law are \\"market value\\" and \\"assessed value\\". The property tax amount is a percentage of the property's assessed value. Sometimes, the assessed value and the market value are set by law to be the same value. When the assessed value is a percentage of the market value, this is called \\"fractional assessment\\". Market value is usually the amount for which the property can be sold in an arms length transaction. However, in New York State for only apartment houses, including cooperatives and condominiums the market value is not the amount for which the property can be sold. Instead, the market value is calculated by the New York City Department of Finance using a statistical model. = Setting the assessed value of a property = The assessed value of a property is calculated based on the property's \\"market value\\", an assessment ratio set annually by the New York City Department of Finance and the Nassau County Assessor, and certain assessment rules set by state law. New York City and Nassau County are legally obligated by RPTL section 738 and N.Y.C. Admin. Code ¬ß 11-212, among other provisions, to adjust the assessment ratio or level of assessment within each class to reflect the market, and to ensure that assessments are uniform within each tax class and that the resulting taxes are equalized. = Amendments = New York City Department of Finance has lowered the assessment ratio in the past to comply with the law's uniformity requirement. After the State Legislature enacted the current system in response to Hellerstein, the Class One assessment ratio was about 25%. It was lowered to 18% in 1985, and then to 12% in 1989. In 1992, the ratio was lowered to 8%, and then in 2004 to the current 6% ratio.Tax Equity Now NY LLC, Plaintiff, -against- City of New York; New York City Department of Finance; State of New York; and New York Office of Real Property Tax Services = Setting the tax rate = The New York City Council and the Mayor of New York City set the actual tax rate for the various tax classes.

In the 1950s and 60s, he was a pupil of Peter Voulkos, a prominent figure in the California Clay Movement. Frimkess' pottery is noted for its classical style, employing forms from Greek, Chinese, and Indigenous American antiquity. His wife and collaborator, Magdalena Suarez Frimkess, paints his ceramic pieces often using anachronistic, contemporary images like Minnie Mouse or Condorito. He is also well-known for his innovative wheel-throwing and firing techniques. Early life and education Frimkess was born on January 8, 1937 in East Los Angeles, California. He grew up largely in the neighborhood of Boyle Heights and claimed to have been among the last Jewish families in the area. His father, Lou Frimkess, was an artist and graphic designer. He was exposed to fine art early in his childhood, receiving drawing and sculpting lessons, and being taken to numerous museum exhibitions. Frimkess learned how to play the saxophone and piano in his youth and aspired to become a jazz musician. At age 15, his family moved to Hollywood and he would graduate from Hollywood High School two years later in 1955. In high school, he took up sculpture, which led him to seek out art schools after graduation. At the age of 17 he became the youngest person to receive a scholarship from the Otis College of Art and Design (then known as the Los Angeles County Art Institute). After a year at the college, Frimkess switched his focus to ceramics, a move that he attributes to a peyote-induced vision of himself throwing a perfectly-shaped vessel. In the ceramics department, he studied under Peter Voulkos, perhaps the most notable figure in the California Clay Movement. He also worked alongside sculptors and ceramists like Billy Al Bengston, John Mason, Kenneth Price, Paul Soldner, and others. In 1956, he was one of 10 young artists to open and display work at a gallery on Sunset Boulevard. In 1957, Frimkess worked in a small ceramics factory while on a trip with his family in Italy, where he received additional training in throwing a very hard type of clay. Career Blues for Dr. Banks by Michael and Magdalena Frimkess In the early 1960s, Frimkess went to Berkeley, California where Peter Voulkos was then teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. While there, he studied bronze and aluminum casting with Voulkos. In 1963, his piece \\"Hooker No. 1\\" (a bronze sculpture of a television) was displayed at the San Francisco Art Institute's Annual exhibition at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Also that year at the behest of Voulkos, Frimkess took an internship at the Clay Art Center in Port Chester, New York. It was there that he met his future wife and frequent collaborator, Magdalena Suarez, who had come to the Art Center from Venezuela as part of a fellowship program. While on the east coast, Frimkess was instructed to visit museums in New York and Boston to study Greek and Chinese forms of pottery. He also began learning the technique of \\"dry throwing\\" clay rather than using water. Much of his work after 1965 replicated classical forms like Greek volute kraters, Zuni pots, and Chinese ginger jars. In 1966, his work was featured in the Abstract Expressionist Ceramics exhibition, which was displayed at several locations including in the art gallery of the University of California, Irvine and, later, the San Francisco Museum of Art. In 1970, his work was featured alongside Robert Arneson, Ron Nagle, and David Gilhooly's in an exhibit at the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1971, Frimkess was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. His subsequent focus on rehab and physical therapy took time away from his ceramic work and limited his output. He continues to throw the pots, and his wife Magdalena Suarez Frimkess would glaze and decorate them. Out Biking with Aunt Samantha by Michael Frimkess, as displayed in the Renwick Gallery In 1976, Frimkess' work was featured at the Clay: The Medium and the Method exhibition held at the art gallery of the University of California, Santa Barbara. A year later, his work was displayed at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art for their exhibition entitled Foundations in Clay. The latter exhibition was considered an update of the Abstract Expressionist Ceramics exhibition from 1966 with five of the six artists returning, including Peter Voulkos, Ron Nagle, Kenneth Price, and John Mason. That year, the James Willis Gallery in San Francisco also displayed a 17-year retrospective of Frimkess' work. Another retrospective of his solo and collaborative work was held in 1982 at the Garth Clark Gallery in Los Angeles. By 1988, Frimkess' work could be found in the Smithsonian Institution, American Craft Museum, and the National Museum of Modern Art in Kyoto, Japan. That year, his work was also featured as part of an exhibition at the Fashion Institute of Technology called Extended Visions which displayed work from artists with multiple sclerosis. In 2000, Frimkess and his wife held an exhibition of their work at Louis Stern Fine Arts entitled, Vessels of Satire: The Art of Magdalena and Michael Frimkess. In 2001, the two provided an official oral history of their lives and work to the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art. In 2003, they displayed some of their work at Little Tokyo Clayworks in Los Angeles. Beginning in 2012, their work started being displayed at South Willard, a menswear shop also in Los Angeles. In 2013, some of Frimkess' early work was displayed at an exhibition called Grapevine at the David Kordansky Gallery in Culver City, California. In March 2014, the Frimkesses' collaborative work was on display at White Columns in New York. Their work was again featured at the Hammer Museum's biennial exhibition, Made in L.A. in August 2014. The couple was also honored with the Made in L.A. Mohn Career Achievement Award. In 2016, their work was featured at an exhibition called Routine Pleasures at the MAK Center in West Hollywood, California. In addition to exhibitions, Frimkess' work has appeared in numerous publications, including Ceramics Monthly, American Ceramics, and Craft Horizons magazines. In 1966 Frimkess wrote an article for Craft Horizons entitled, \\"The Importance of Being Classical,\\" and he was later featured in its December 1973 issue (\\"Michael Frimkess and the Cultured Pot\\"). More recently, Michael and Magdalena have been profiled in both the Los Angeles Times and the New York Times. Artistic style Frimkess' early work included a variety of both ceramics and bronze or aluminum sculptures. These early pieces were often more free-form and less utilitarian, taking a cue from his mentor and teacher, Peter Voulkos. His interest and skill in making classical pottery forms began to increase in the mid-1960s. Examples of his work include Greek volute kraters, Zuni pots, and Chinese ginger jars. He also learned the technique of dry throwing hard clay with no water to make his vessels, resulting in walls that are remarkably light and thin. In addition, through his expertise and efforts in kiln design and construction, he developed a method of firing stoneware in as little as 55 minutes. Prior to his multiple sclerosis diagnosis, Frimkess would glaze and paint all of his ceramics, decorating them with contemporary scenes and pop art. The images were often \\"vernacular or historical\\" and employed the use of cartoon sequences or word balloons that often satirized problems related to corruption, segregation, and hypocrisy. His work frequently dealt with racial strife, and he often drew on his childhood growing up in a predominately Chicano, Japanese, and Black neighborhood. His pots were meant to symbolize an ideal \\"melting pot.\\" Since his multiple sclerosis diagnosis in 1971, most of the art painted on his pots has been done by his wife, Magdalena Suarez Frimkess. While her art has similar themes, it evokes a different cultural experience. Her glazes and paintings feature pop art icons like Minnie Mouse and Condorito, but they also employ folk art combined with a variety of historical references. In general, neither of the two has any input on the other's work. Both continue to work and reside in Venice, California.

It was designed by James Barnet and built in 1882 by W. Cains and Sons. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  The subject site was the location of the first General Hospital in Sydney which operated between 1788 and 1816. In 1797 High (George) Street was realigned. The realignment required the portable hospital to be pulled down and re-erected on a stone foundation slightly west of its original location. A store and dispensary were then erected to the north and west of the hospital buildings. In 1816 the Sydney Hospital opened in Macquarie Street and the old hospital closed. In 1836 William Davis was granted the subject site in the form of 16 perches, although an 1834 survey suggests that houses were on the site prior to this grant and therefore, Davis had probably been in informal ownership of the land. It is also possible that the Davis building was part of the 1790-1816 hospital. By 1844 The Rocks had a reticulated water supply to public fountains. Gas mains were laid in the 1850s, as were water mains. Sewerage lines were installed during the mid-1860s. Archaeological investigation could possibly uncover evidence of these on the subject site. The Rocks had a notorious reputation for trouble and violence stretching back to its colonial beginnings as a penal colony and early trading port. The \\"pushes\\" of the Rocks were particularly notable. Law and order were kept by mounted police or \\"troopers\\", in combination with ordinary police, who could be picked out in a crowd by their bell-topper hat, black coat and white duck trousers. The mounted police wore a military uniform similar to the regular 13th Light Dragoons. Police control of the Rocks during the mid-19th century was achieved with the Water Police in George Street, a single constable in Harrington Street, a station house in Cumberland Street, and, more to keep a watchful eye on , a station at government ground cornered at Kent and Argyle Streets. Gazettal of an official police force occurred in 1862, when the Police Regulation Act, No. 16 was proclaimed. The Rocks had paled in police significance and, taking into consideration factors elsewhere, was less a charge on the city conscience. There were still sporadic eruptions of violence in the nineties, and those whose business or inclinations obliged them to pass through The Cut, were still aware of the sandbag and the footpad and the garrotter in gas-lit early 20th century. But these were not confined to The Rocks. =Royal Commission= In the 1890s a Royal Commission was formed \\"to make a diligent and full inquiry with the view of ascertaining the undoubted facts in the matter of alleged illicit gambling and immoralities among the Chinese resident in George-Street North, in the said City of Sydney and neighbourhood, and the alleged bribery or misconduct of any members of the NSW Police Force in relation thereto\\". The commission's investigation was to take three months from the 20 August 1891, but required two extensions before a final report was given in January 1892. The two 'illegal' forms of gambling introduced by the Chinese were fan-tan (a game of chance) and pak-ah-pu (a sort of lottery). The Commission found that: In George Street North, the games mainly attracted wharf-labourers, sailors and coal-lumpers, and, because of the low cost, children were also buying the pak-ah-pu lottery tickets. The Commission put forward the following recommendations: ;For the suppression of gambling * That Non-commissioned Officers and Senior-constables be empowered without procuring a Magistrate's warrant to enter any house suspected on being a public gambling resort. * That persons found on premises where gambling is in progress should be liable to arrest and summary conviction. * That where gambling implements are found on suspected premises, the occupant should thereby be rendered liable to prosecution, and the onus of proof cast upon the accused of his being there for a lawful purpose. * That the sale and purchase of pak-ah-pu tickets be made a misdemeanour. * That, in houses suspected as public gambling resorts, the existence of barricades against police inspection be declared unlawful. * That the police should, by the frequent visitation of gaming-houses, in addition to organised raids, harass those who make a living by gambling, or who gamble for amusement, as much as possible, without neglecting their duty in other directions. ;For the suppression of opium smoking *A stricter enforcement of the law relating to the sale and distribution of opium. ;For improvement in the sanitary condition of Chinese residences * A Common Lodging House Act, compelling the keepers of lodging- houses of all descriptions to provide adequate accommodation (cubic space, ventilation, water-closets, etc.). * That Parliament should give its favourable consideration to the new Bill for the better government of the City of Sydney, now in course of preparation by the City Council There were also many allegations against policemen taking bribes from the Chinese gamblers to turn a blind eye on the illegal gaming rooms. Some allegations, 'As reported in the press some of the statements volunteered by the deputation and the Members of Parliament who introduced them to the Colonial Secretary were: However, the Commission found that the witnesses bringing bribery charges against the police could not substantiate their claims without exception they had based their statements on mere suspicion, or upon allegations that had come to them second-hand. For the most part the evidence was hopelessly general. Indeed, so far as the more serious allegations made by the deputation to the Colonial Secretary were concerned, the witnesses against the police had so utterly failed to establish their case that the police were examined, and severely cross-examined, on the charges of bribery with a view to seeing if, by any chance, they would implicate themselves; and that they certainly did not. In general, the Commission emphatically discredited the charges of bribery against the police and rejected the charge of alleged inactivity by the police towards the Chinese gambling problem. =Resumption= The site was purchased from a Mr Billyard by the NSW Department of Public Works as a site for a watch house late in 1879. Additional land between the George Street North site and the Harrington Street site was later resumed. An outbreak of the Bubonic plague occurred in Sydney in 1900. The Government began resuming private property in The Rocks and demolishing large amounts of housing. Commercial properties were leased back to their former owners. The Rocks Resumption Board and the Sydney Harbour Trust also widened streets and redeveloped the waterfront in an effort to clean up the city. =Use as a police station= Tenders were called for the erection of the Police Station on 10 May 1881. The successful tenderer was W Cain and Sons. They were informed of the acceptance in June 1881 and the building was completed in 1882 and occupied by police in 1883. It is now one of only two nineteenth century police stations in the inner city area. The Government Architect, James Barnet, designed the building in the form of a Palladian Water Gate. This was a structure where boats could discharge passengers with comfort and dry feet, and was considered as a \\"curious conceit for a police station\\". Barnet was influenced by a quay-side Lower George Street site. Above the lofty entrance arch to the Police Station are Queen Victoria's initials with a lion's head, the symbol of British justice, with a policeman's truncheon in its mouth. The message of the head and truncheon is clear: Uphold the law, or else. . . They are representative of the very visual and conscious representation of government authority Barnet imbued in the design of his government buildings. These buildings were also a reflection of a type of conservatism in Barnet's attitude towards authority through the use of symbolism in carvings and an imposing, classic, style and form that reflected the authority of the function of the building. The history of the head and truncheon are a constant source of interest. Folk legends abound. Historic sources indicate that the existing truncheon is the original. Other sources relate that in 1982 the truncheon was stolen, and a similar truncheon was created for a replacement. The original truncheon was made from an unknown material, and it has been suggested that the truncheon was originally bronze. The truncheon has been replaced twice between 1995 and 2000. The truncheon is currently a hardwood, and is now located in the lion's mouth facing in the opposite direction to the original. When Barnet retired, he listed among his works 155 police stations. In all, he produced over 1350 works. Early on he established general plans for building types. That is, there was a standard style for post offices, a style for courthouses and so on. Police Stations have received limited attention in studies of Barnet and his work. In one recent study of Barnet's work the only police station listed among Barnet's significant works is the former Police Station at The Rocks. The General Post Office, the Lands Department and the Australian Museum together with court houses, hospitals and post offices generally have received greater attention. This is perhaps because police stations were often a part of courthouses, broader law and justice complexes or combined with policeman's residences. This is evident in the NSW Police Service S170 register. The police stations are within the grand courthouses or the smaller bungalow and other residential style buildings where the local policeman also lived. There are some identifiable police stations by Barnet that stand alone as does the station at 127-29 George Street. This includes the Glebe Police Station. However it, as with others, were designed with nearby courts or other precincts in mind and followed the general type- specific patterns characteristic of Barnet's designs. Modifications to the building have been minor only. In 1900 a further two cell rooms were added. In 1921 a roof was erected over the exercise yard. In 1923 electric light was installed. The meal room was extended in 1957. The floor of the exercise yard has been raised. In 1937 additions to the first floor balconies were drawn up, for timber windows to be inserted into the balcony openings to George Street, and new flooring across from balcony floor to balcony floor to create a complete balcony at upper level over the portico. The unsympathetic windows which were inserted into the fa√ßade at the upper level balconies appear in a photo from 1970. These were removed and the original openings restored in the 1970s alterations. =Use as an art gallery= The police station ceased to operate as such on 2 November 1974, the building was transferred to the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority (SCRA) and was later opened as the Australian Craftworks Gallery. The SCRA (subsequently the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority (SHFA)) was established in the late 1960s by the State Government with the aim of redeveloping the entire Rocks area. Initial schemes for complete demolition of all the buildings within The Rocks and erection of a series of towers were received with considerable public opposition, and re- development projects were halted by Green Bans imposed by the building worker's unions. The main focus of the work undertaken by the SCRA in the 1970s was the adaptive re-use of buildings such as the subject place and the Argyle Centre. During 1977 the front balconies were restored by the SCRA, which also provided the toilets on thee first floor. The following year the raised exercise yard and part of the old covered yard were removed to make way for the Nurses Walk. Restoration work then proceeded, the work included the copper roof and the yard, cleaning of walls, stone paving and the steel fence to the present-day remains of the exercise yard. The building is currently occupied by Christie's, the Craftworks Gallery having vacated the building in 2003. The building is intact and in good condition. The building remained under the control of the Sydney Harbour Foreshore Authority, that promoted the conservation of significant items and buildings, such as the subject place, following established conservation principles and methodology.Tropman & Tropman Architects, 2004  Description  The fa√ßade features an interesting Palladian water gate design with heavily articulated piers, quoins and voussoirs. It also has a well carved lion's head key stone to the arch and a coat of arms to the Neo Classical pediment. Style: Neo-classical; Storeys: 2; Facade: Stone; Internal Walls: Brick; Roof Cladding: Slate and Copper; Internal Structure: Brick; Floor Frame: Timber The building is highly intact, retaining much of its original form and detail internally and externally. The symmetrical sandstone fa√ßade forms the front elevation of two-storey verandah/void. The slate roof is a pitched from behind the stone parapet. The rear of the building is constructed of dry pressed clay bricks which is generally unrendered. The building has two stories to the front, comprising former offices on both levels connected by a timber stair. Most original joinery and other finishes remains intact,; including stair, architraves, window. The upper level offices (facing street) have access to separate balconies which project across the double height portico space. The balconies are of timber construction with wrought iron balustrades. The single storey rear of the building is defined by two side boundary parapet walls, from which the two main roof planes pitch down to the middle. A timber framed clerestory window (curved roof over) runs the length of the building, and is located in the centre valley of two pitched rooves. Internally, there is a central corridor off which are a number of single and double cells. The cells retain many of their original (or early) fixtures including, metal cell doors and hardware and window grilles. There are external open spaces associated with the cells. = Condition = As at 27 April 2001, while the building is in overall good condition, there is some damage/deterioration of the sandstone due to poor drainage and related issues. The interior whilst largely intact, requires some maintenance. The impact of modern fittings and fixtures such as the fairy lights, and shop display fittings may require review as part of future management of the building. The modified central entry, while intrusive, is reversible and the long-term management of the building should seek to reinstate original form and detail. Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: Floors level with George Street, and terraced up to former level of Nurses Walk. = Modifications and dates = *1900Two cells added to the police station building *1921Roof erected over the exercise yard. *1923Electric light installed *1937Plans drawn up to convert first floor balconies into one balcony involving the removal of the internal wall balustrading, insertion of windows on the front fa√ßade and construction of timber floor between the two existing balconies. *1957Meal room extended. *1974Police vacated building *1977Verandah restored and fa√ßade cleaned.

Heritage listing  As at 12 April 2005, the former Police Station building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right (see item no. 4500458). A strong yet picturesquely designed small government building, it is one of only two 19th century police stations remaining in the inner city and provides an important focal point to the George Street business precinct facades. The building demonstrates late 19th century police station/cell design. While the building is architecturally unusual, for this type of building, it shows police offices and cells, similar in design and layout to other /regional rural police barracks and jails in NSW. The building is publicly accessible through its current use. Significant aspects of the building include its overall architectural form and detail. This includes the sandstone fa√ßade, steps and flagged portico, and timber balconies. The rear form comprising face brickwork, external court spaces and associated features are also important. Internally, the original layout and other features including joinery, metal cell fixtures, fireplaces and stairs contribute to the significance of the building. Police Station was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The former Police Station building and site are of State heritage significance for their historical and scientific cultural values. The site and building are also of State heritage significance for their contribution to The Rocks area which is of State Heritage significance in its own right. The building contributes to the understanding of the historical development of The Rocks. The land on which the building stands is significant as the location of the first hospital in Sydney and the history of the beginning of health and healthcare in Australia. It is also an early representation of the beneficial relationship between scientific and natural remedies through the presence of the herb garden. The building is significant for its departure from Barnet's more standardised design for public building construction which he developed from the 1860s to 1890. It is a 19th-century reminder of the location and presence of early law enforcement in Sydney and the importance of this presence in the Rocks area. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The former Police Station is associated with James Barnet, Colonial Architect, whose work is readily identifiable all over NSW and provides a strong physical connection between the past and the present in towns with visually dominate examples of his work. It is also important as part of a body of work of over 1300 buildings which demonstrates Barnet's development as an architect, his views on public architecture and his influence on the development of public architecture in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

Internally, the original layout and other features including joinery, metal cell fixtures, fireplaces and stairs contribute to the significance of the building. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. the building has social significance as the site of the first hospital, evidenced by the plaque commemorating this place by the RHAS prominently on the front of the building. It has social significance as shown by the numerous stories of the truncheon being stolen in pranks, whether true or not. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building demonstrates technical and research significance as a good example of building techniques, particularly of police station and cell design, from the late 19th century The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The building is rare, being only one of two surviving 19th century police stations in the inner city.

Origin of the idea Conceived as an outgrowth of Jane Addams ideas about helping the poor, especially children, to receive food and healthcare. In the wake of the Influenza epidemic of 1918, the city of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania authorized, in 1919, a Department of Recreation, with special provisions for establishing a children‚Äôs summer camp called Camp Happy. Site and facilities In 1920, a plot of land was located on a large tract of land near the Delaware River, at the southwest corner of Linden and Torresdale Avenue, in Northeast Philadelphia, this was to be the location of Camp Happy, a camp designed to provide healthy nutrition and fresh air for the underprivileged children of Philadelphia. \\\\+ : The camp had an infirmary, a meeting hall, where movies were shown, a dining hall and separate swimming pools for girls and boys. The children's street clothes were taken on arrival and stored in the attic of a barn, subsequently, they were issued uniforms, boys were issued canvas shorts and shirts, girls were issued pajama type jumpsuits with back flaps. Separate communal showers for boys and girls, hands were washed and teeth brushed in a communal porcelain water trough on the outside of the shower house. The stay was originally three weeks. Life in the camp Initially, the population of the camp was multi-ethnic and multi- racial, by the time of its closing in 1951, it was homogeneous. The daily regimen was militarized, standing in formation saluting the flag. The children slept on canvas cots under wool blankets in barracks that were compared to Nazi Stormtrooper barracks. Each morning, the blankets were folded, the cots are taken outside and hosed down. The counselors and one was assigned to each barracks, were teens who exercised virtually unsupervised control and exercised discipline (often arbitrary and demeaning) over the children. The occupants of each cabin were marched single file to the communal bathhouse to brush their teeth, then marched to the parade ground to line up and salute the flag. Then marched to the dining hall, for breakfast. Saying grace collectively, they sat down to eat breakfast that most enjoyed as it was better than they had at home. The day followed with planned activities, which might include the swimming pool and movies. In the early years of the camp, in the 1920s, the interaction and care by the counselors were educational and nurturing, but that deteriorated over time until by the 1950s the children felt they were prisoners, a feeling reinforced by having to wear uniforms. There were even escape attempts. Many campers felt more like prisoners and called it Camp Sad Post-war development and the end of Camp Happy After World War II there was a spurt of economic growth, increased development in Torresdale, drove up demand for real estate, so in 1952 the camp was relocated to the Pocono Mountains. When the land was bought from Girard College for $25,000 and the camp was renamed, Camp William Penn. Its demise was facilitated by both the demand for land by developers and the bad press afforded it by the Philadelphia Daily News.
