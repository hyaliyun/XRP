Gui depicted as a knight in armour bearing a mace. Gui d'Ussel, d'Ussèl, or d'Uisel (fl. 1195-1209Aubrey, 16.) was a turn-of-the-thirteenth-century troubadour of the Limousin. Twenty of his poems survive: eight cansos, two pastorelas, two coblas, and eight tensos, several with his relatives and including a partimen with Maria de Ventadorn.Gaunt and Kay, 284. Four of his cansos melodies remain.Perrin, 323. According to his vida, Gui was the youngest of three sons of a wealthy noble family of the castle Ussel-sur-Sarzonne, northeast of Ventadorn. He and his brothers Ebles and Peire, as well as his cousin Elias, are all reputed troubadours and castellans of Ussel according to the author of the vida, who makes Gui himself a canon of Montferrand and Brioude in the diocese of Clermont.Egan, 44. Among his relatives Gui was known for his cansos. The only confirmation of Gui's family from outside his vida is a reference to the brothers Guido and Eblo Usseli donating land to the abbey of Bonaigue. Gui's biographer believed him to have been in love with Malgarita, wife of Rainaut VI, viscount of Aubusson. He supposedly later fell in love with Guillemette de Comborn, wife of Dalfi d'Alvernha, and composed many songs about her. Gui spent almost his entire life in the Limousin and Auvergne, rarely travelling abroad.Aubrey, 222. Gui addresses several of his songs to Maria de Ventadorn (including the partimen) and makes reference to Peter II of Aragon in one which survives with a melody. The reference to Peter's queen in the song's razo puts the date of its composition in 1204 or later, after Peter's marriage to Marie of Montpellier. His vida records how Gui obeyed a papal injunction from Pierre de Castelnau to cease composing in 1209 and the fact that none of his poems can be reliably assigned later than that date and none mention the Albigensian Crusade, it is probable that Gui did indeed obey papal orders and cease writing.Egan, 45, notes that the Council of Montpellier of 1214 forbade clerics to mingle with curias vel hospicia vel colloquia mulierum. Gui's poetry to some measure imitates that of his contemporary Cadenet, whom he mentions in one piece.Aubrey, 21 and 225. His melodies have something in common with those of Gaucelm Faidit, whom he may have met in Ventadorn. His melodies all stay within a minor tenth interval and use numerous thirds and traids, but never repeating phrases in the AAB form. His music is characterised by motivic variety and he has been praised for his \\"subtle and creative compositional faculty\\".Aubrey, 224. The later troubadour Daude de Pradas referred to Gui in a tenso and his melody has given some indication that it may have been influenced by those of Gui.Aubrey, 232. Gui's works were reproduced in the anthology of Ferrarino Trogni da Ferrara. Notes Sources *Aubrey, Elizabeth. The Music of the Troubadours.

History The Chakma script is an abugida that belongs to the Brahmic family of scripts. Chakma evolved from the Burmese script, which was ultimately derived from Pallava.http://unicode.org/L2/L2009/09187r-n3645r-chakma.pdf The script, along with the Chakma language, has been introduced to non-government schools in Bangladesh, as well as schools in Mizoram and as of 2012 in Tripura in India. Structure Chakma Letters Chakma is of the Brahmic type: the consonant letters contain an inherent vowel. Unusually for Brahmic scripts, the inherent vowel in Chakma is a long 'ā' (aː) as opposed to short 'a' (ə) which is standard in most other languages of India such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil. Consonant clusters are written with conjunct characters, and a visible vowel killer shows the deletion of the inherent vowel when there is no conjunct. Vowels Four independent vowels exist: a, i, u, and e. Other vowels in initial position are formed by adding the vowel sign to a, as in ī, ū, ai, oi. Some modern writers are generalizing this spelling in i, u, and e. Chakma vowel signs with the letter ka are given below: Ka = Ka Ka = Kā + - a (11127) Ki = Kā + - i (11128) Kī = Kā + - ī (11129) Ku = Kā + - u (1112A) Kū = Kā + - ū (1112B) Ke = Kā + - e (1112C) Kāi = Kā + - āi (1112D) Ko = Kā + - o (1112E) Kau = Kā + - au (1112F) Koi = Kā + - oi (11130) Kaṃ = Kā + - ṃ (11100) Kaṃ = Kā + - ṃ (11101) Kaḥ = Kā + - ḥ (11102) K = Kā + - MAAYYAA (11134) One of the interesting features of Chakma writing is that candrabindu (cānaphudā) can be used together with anusvara (ekaphudā) and visarga (dviphudā): Aḥṃ = ā + Aṃṃ = ā + Uṃṃ = u + Muṃ = mā + Consonants with killed vowels and conjunct consonants Like other Brahmic scripts, Chakma makes use of the maayyaa (killer) to invoke conjoined consonants. In the past, practice was much more common than it is today. Like the Myanmar script, Chakma is encoded with two vowel-killing characters in order to conform to modern user expectations. As shown above, most letters have their vowels killed with the use of the explicit maayyaa: 𑄇𑄴 k = 𑄇 kā + 𑄴 MAAYYAA In 2001 an orthographic reform was recommended in the book Cāṅmā pattham pāt which would limit the standard repertoire of conjuncts to those composed with the five letters 𑄠 yā, 𑄢 rā, 𑄣 lā, 𑄤 wā, and 𑄚 nā. The four here are the most widely accepted repertoire of conjuncts. ya: X + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄠 yā ra: X + + rā la: X + VIRAMA + lā wa: X + VIRAMA + wā No separate conjunct forms of subjoined full-form -yā or -rā appear to exist. The fifth of these conjuncts, the -na conjunct, is exemplary of the orthographic shift which has taken place in the Chakma language. na: X + VIRAMA + nā While some writers would indeed write (in ligating style) as 𑄇𑄇𑄳𑄚 or (in subjoining style) as 𑄇𑄇𑄳𑄚, most now would probably expect it to be written as 𑄇𑄇𑄴𑄚. The ligating style of glyphs is now considered old-fashioned. Thus, taking the letter 𑄟 mā as the second element, while the glyph shapes 𑄇𑄳𑄟 kmā, 𑄖𑄳𑄟 tmā, 𑄚𑄳𑄟 nmā, 𑄝𑄳𑄝 bbā, 𑄟𑄳𑄟 mmā, 𑄣𑄳𑄣 llā, 𑄥𑄳𑄟 smā, and 𑄦𑄳𑄟 hmā are attested, most users now prefer the glyph shapes 𑄇𑄳𑄟 kmā, 𑄖𑄳𑄟 tmā, 𑄚𑄳𑄟 nmā, 𑄝𑄳𑄝 bbā, 𑄟𑄳𑄟 mmā, 𑄣𑄳𑄣 llā, 𑄥𑄳𑄟 smā, and 𑄦𑄳𑄟 hmā. Again, this distinction is stylistic and not orthographic. The 2004 book Phadagaṅ shows examples of the five conjuncts above together alongside conjuncts formed with 𑄝 bā, 𑄟 mā, and 𑄦 hā. These are all formed by simple subjoining. ba: X + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄝 nā ma: X + VIRAMA + nā ha: X + VIRAMA + nā In the 1982 book Cāṅmār āg pudhi a much wider range of conjunct pairs is shown, some of them with fairly complicated glyphs: Kkā = Kā + VIRAMA + 𑄇 Kā Ktā = Kā + VIRAMA + 𑄑 Tā Ktā = Kā + VIRAMA + 𑄖 Tā Kmā = Kā + VIRAMA + 𑄟 Mā Kcā = Kā + VIRAMA + 𑄌 Cā ńkā = ńā + VIRAMA + 𑄇 Kā ńkā = ńā + VIRAMA + 𑄉 Gā ccā = cā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄌 Cā Cchā = Cā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄍 Chā ñcā = ñā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄌 Cā ñjā = ñā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄎 Jā Ñjhā = ñā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄏 Jhā Ttā = Tā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄑 Tā Ttā = Tā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄖 Tā Tmā = Tā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄟 mā Tthā = Tā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄗 Thā Ddā = Dā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄘 Dā Ddhā = 𑄘 Dā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄙 Dhā ntā = 𑄚 nā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄖 tā nthā = 𑄚 nā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄗 thā nmā = 𑄚 nā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄟 mā ppā = 𑄛 pā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄛 pā bbā = 𑄝 bā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄝 bā mmā = 𑄟 mā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄟 mā jjā = 𑄎 jā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄎 jā lkā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄇 kā lgā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄉 gā llā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄣 lā ltā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄑 tā lpā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄛 pā lchā = 𑄣 lā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄍 chā stā = 𑄥 sā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄑 tā skā = 𑄥 sā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄇 kā spā = 𑄥 sā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄛 pā smā = 𑄥 sā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄟 mā hmā = 𑄦 hā + 𑄳 VIRAMA + 𑄟 hmā Letter, punctuation and digit names Chakma letters have a descriptive name followed by a traditional Brahmic consonant. These are given in annotations to the character names. Alongside a single and double danda punctuation, Chakma has a unique question mark, and a section sign, Phulacihna. There is some variation in the glyphs for the Phulacihna, some looking like flowers or leaves. A set of digits exists although Bengali digits are also used.

In the bull Conferentia Episcopalis Apuliae issued on 20 October 1980, Pope John Paul II created the ecclesiastical province of Lecce, with the Archdiocese of Otranto becoming a suffragan diocese.\\"Archdiocese of Lecce\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org.

History Many years ago, Lecce was known as Lupiæ, Lupia, Lycia, and Aletium.Cappelletti, p. 311. Beginning around the year 1060, Lecce became the seat of a Norman count. One of its notable counts, Tancred of Lecce, contested Emperor Henry VI for the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies. Another count was Gautier de Brienne, a cousin of Tancred. Chapter and cathedral The cathedral of Lecce, which was, like nearly all the cathedrals in the Kingdom of Naples, dedicated to the assumption of the body of the Virgin Mary into heaven, was administered and served by a Chapter. The cathedral Chapter was composed of three dignities (the Archdeacon, the Cantor, and the Treasurer) and twenty-four Canons.Ughelli, p. 68. In 1671, there were twenty Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 244, note 1. In 1741, there were again twenty-four Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica VI, p. 261, note 1. In 1885, after the unification of Italy, there were four dignities (the Archdeacon, the Treasurer, the ParoccoThe parish priest, since the cathedral was also a parish, one of four in the city. and the Theologus); there were sixteen other Canons.Giuseppe Bertolotti, Statistica ecclesiastica d'Italia (Savona: Andrea Ricci 1885), p. 633. In 2019, there were ten Canons (),Four of these Canons were Canons ex officio: the Vicar General, the diocesan Master of Ceremonies, the Rector of the diocesan seminary, and the parish priest of the parish of the cathedral. and eight honorary Canons. There was also a collegiate church, the Collegiata di Campi Salentino, which had twenty-seven Canons, headed by an Archpriest and four dignities.Pietro De Simone, \\"Lecce,\\" in: V. D'Avino, Cenni storici sulle chiese ... del Regno del Due Sicilie (Napoli: Ranucci 1848), p. 297 column 1. The seminary building was built between 1694 and 1709, by Bishop Michele Pignatelli and Bishop Fabrizio Pignatelli, to designs by Giuseppe Cino.De Simone, Lecce ed i suoi monumenti, p. 94. In 1885, the seminary had thirteen teachers and thirty clerics studying for the priesthood; in the previous five years there had been four ordinations and sixty deaths of priests.Bertolotti, p. 633. Subject to the Holy See Up until 1960, Lecce had been a suffragan (subordinate) of the archbishopric of Otranto. Reacting to the large increase in population, and to the fact that Lecce had been made a provincial capital by the Italian government, Pope John XXIII issued the bull \\"Cum a Nobis\\" on 28 September 1960, separating Lecce from its relationship with the diocese of Otranto and making it directly subject to the Holy See.Acta Apostolicae Sedis 53 (Città del Vaticano 1961), pp. 345-346. Metropolitan archdiocese Following the Second Vatican Council, and in accordance with the norms laid out in the Council's decree, Christus Dominus chapter 40,Christus Dominus 40. Therefore, in order to accomplish these aims this sacred synod decrees as follows: 1) The boundaries of ecclesiastical provinces are to be submitted to an early review and the rights and privileges of metropolitans are to be defined by new and suitable norms. 2) As a general rule all dioceses and other territorial divisions that are by law equivalent to dioceses should be attached to an ecclesiastical province. Therefore dioceses which are now directly subject to the Apostolic See and which are not united to any other are either to be brought together to form a new ecclesiastical province, if that be possible, or else attached to that province which is nearer or more convenient. They are to be made subject to the metropolitan jurisdiction of the bishop, in keeping with the norms of the common law. 3) Wherever advantageous, ecclesiastical provinces should be grouped into ecclesiastical regions for the structure of which juridical provision is to be made. the Episcopal Conference of Apulia petitioned the Holy See (Pope) that Lecce be made a metropolitan and that a new ecclesiastical province be created. After wide consultations among all affected parties, Pope John Paul II issued a decree on 20 October 1980, elevating Lecce to the status of metropolitan see. He also created the new ecclesiastical province of Lecce, whose constituent bishoprics (suffragans) were to be: Brindisi (no longer a metropolitanate, though the archbishop allowed to retain the title of archbishop), Otranto (no longer a metropolitanate, though the archbishop allowed to retain the title of archbishop), Gallipoli, Nardò, Ostuno, and Uxentina-S.

Named after Finegand, in Scotland, by John Shaw. John Shaw arrived in New Zealand in 1852, with his sister Margaret, from Finegand which is near Glenshee in Perthshire, Scotland. He took up land on the south bank of the Clutha River, and named his farm \\"Finegand\\". Finegand is situated on the Clutha River south of Balclutha. Other nearby settlements include Otanomomo and Waitepeka to the south and Kakapuaka to the northwest.  Economy  Finegand is located in a rural area and thus the economic emphasis is on agriculture. A major freezing works operated by Silver Fern Farms is located in Finegand. A multimillion-dollar upgrade of the facility was undertaken in 2007.Neal Wallace, \\"Meat Workers Remain Confident\\", Otago Daily Times (31 October 2007).  Transport  Finegand is situated on the Southern Scenic Route road, which meets State Highway 1 just to the north in Balclutha. On 15 December 1885, the first section of the Catlins River Branch railway opened through Finegand. This branch line ultimately terminated in Tahakopa, with the Finegand station 3.6 km from the junction with the Main South Line in Balclutha.New Zealand Railway and Tramway Atlas, fourth edition, edited by John Yonge (Essex: Quail Map Company, 1993), 28. At its peak in the first half of the 20th century, up to sixteen trains per week would pass through Finegand, primarily mixed trains. However, the line's profitability declined after World War II and it closed beyond Finegand on 27 February 1971. The first 4.05 km remain in operation as an industrial siding to serve the Silver Firm Farms freezing works and it is shunted as required by passing trains on the Main South Line.David Leitch and Brian Scott, Exploring New Zealand's Ghost Railways, revised edition (Wellington: Grantham House, 1998 [1995]), 103-4.

On occasion the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has challenged such deductions, regarding the activities in question as illegitimate, and in certain circumstances the Internal Revenue Code provides for such challenge. Rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court have in general upheld the deductions, where there is not a specific governmental policy in support of disallowing them. Deduction for business expenses Section 162(a) of the Internal Revenue Code allows for taxpayers to deduct from their gross income26 U.S.C. 162(a) ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred in carrying on a trade or business. Taxpayers seeking to minimize the size of their gross income for tax purposes have a strong incentive to deduct as much as possible from their pre-tax income. Thus, taxpayers will attempt to classify their activity as trade or business to take advantage of the deduction. To deduct an expense under § 162(a) the item must meet six separate elements:Samuel A. Donaldson, Federal Income Taxation of Individuals 202 (2005) # The expense must be ordinary # The expense must be necessary # It must be an expense as opposed to a capital expenditure # The expense has to be paid or incurred during the taxable year # The expense has to be in carrying on the activity # The activity has to be a trade or business activity the part for When these criteria are met, the taxpayer will typically be successful in claiming a deduction. However, taxpayers may still face challenges to their claimed deductions if allowing a deduction is considered by the IRS or tax courts as invalid as against public policy. IRS claims for public policy exception Taxpayers who engage in illegitimate or illegal business activities and claim § 162 deductions for expenses paid or incurred in carrying on those activities create problems for policymakers seeking to prevent the formation of such business activity. Section 162 of the Code does not include any provision concerning the legality of the trade or business activity in question.Supra note 1 Thus, to contest the allowance of deductions in such situations, the IRS has raised arguments based on public policy. In a series of decisions, the Supreme Court held that there is no public policy exception to § 162 deductions at common law. Without clear guidance from Congress as to the relevance of the legality of a business activity in the expense deduction determination, expenditures of a taxpayer that otherwise meet the requirements of § 162 will be allowed as deductions. Supreme Court rulings The Tellier case In Commissioner v. Tellier,383 U.S. 687 (1966). the taxpayer claimed deductions for legal expenses incurred in an unsuccessful defense against criminal prosecution related to his trade or business. The taxpayer, Tellier, was in the securities business, \\"underwriting the public sale of stock offerings and purchasing securities for resale to customers.\\" In 1956, Tellier was convicted of violating the fraud section of the Securities Act of 1933, the mail fraud statute, and conspiracy to violate those statutes. After the trial, Tellier claimed a deduction for his unsuccessful legal expenses. The IRS argued that a deduction for expenses incurred in an unsuccessful defense against a charge of criminal behavior should not be allowed because to do so would presumably grant a windfall to the guilty defendant. The Court, however, made clear that it would review deduction determinations in light of the principle that the \\"federal income tax is a tax on net income, not a sanction against wrongdoing.\\" According to the Court, absent \\"a few limited and well-defined exceptions\\" (see below) § 162 does not limit deductions for losses to those losses incurred in a legitimate trade or business. The rationale for this conclusion was the 1913 Senate debate on the first federal income tax bill. According to the Congressional Record, amendments that would have limited deductions for losses to only those incurred in a legitimate or lawful trade or business were expressly rejected by the Senate. Senator John Williams, the orchestrator of the income tax bill, stated, \\"the object of this bill is to tax a man's net income…the law does not care where he got it from, so far as the tax is concerned…\\"50 Cong. Rec. 3849 The Court upheld the deduction, holding that no public policy was offended.Tellier, 383 U.S. 687. Without any direction from Congress to limit the losses stemming from an illegitimate business, the Court was unwilling to attach what it viewed as an additional financial burden (disallowance) to the punishment imposed by the finding of criminal guilt. The Sullivan and Lilly cases The Court used similar reasoning in earlier cases concerning deductions claimed for expenses arising out of illegal or illegitimate business activity. In United States v. Sullivan,356 U.S. 27 (1958). the taxpayer claimed a deduction for rent and wages paid in support of a gambling enterprise. The enterprise and the rent and wages paid were illegal under state law. The IRS challenged the claimed deduction, stating that the illegality of the gambling enterprise required disallowance of the deduction. The Supreme Court upheld the deduction, holding that \\"to enforce as federal policy the rule espoused by the Commissioner [IRS] in this case, we would come close to making this type of business taxable on the basis of its gross receipts…If that choice is to be made, Congress should do it.\\" In Lilly v. Commissioner,343 U.S. 90 (1952). opticians claimed deductions for payments made to doctors in consideration of prescriptions for eyeglasses sold by the optician taxpayers in question. Though these payments qualified for § 162 deduction as expenses paid in the course of the opticians' trade or business, the IRS argued that the expenses should be disallowed as against public policy. While the Court disapproved of the business ethics displayed by the opticians, the Court upheld the deductions as valid under the Code. Tank Truck Rentals The Court in Tellier stated that only in extremely limited circumstances would a deduction that meets the requirements of § 162 be disallowed where Congress is silent. Specifically, the Court decided that a deduction that otherwise meets the requirements of § 162 will be disallowed where allowance would \\"frustrate sharply defined national or state policies proscribing particular types of conduct… evidenced by some governmental declaration\\". The state policy at issue in Tank Truck Rentals v. Commissioner356 U.S. 30 (1958), provides an example of the type of policy evidenced by some governmental declaration that would limit deduction. In Tank Truck Rentals, the taxpayer trucking company claimed deductions for fines and penalties it received for violating state maximum weight penal statutes. The Court ruled that allowing deductions \\"would have directly and substantially diluted the actual punishment imposed.\\" Further, the Court stated that allowing such a deduction would encourage non-compliance with a defined state regulation. Statutory limits on business expense deductions Even though there is no public policy exception to the deduction of business expenses, the Code itself imposes some public policy based exceptions. For example, § 162(c)(1) disallows a deduction for illegal bribes or kickbacks to a domestic government official or agency, and § 162(f) disallows a deduction for fines paid to the government for violating the law. Furthermore, § 280E prevents a taxpayer from taking a deduction related to the business of selling illegal controlled substances. So while the Tellier court ruling states that the federal tax is not meant to be a sanction for wrongdoing, there are often public policy prohibitions embedded in the Code itself.

PROTA Foundation, Wageningen; Backhuys, Leiden; CTA, Wageningen. - p.146-151. In Russia it's called pekinskaya kapusta (), literally \\"Beijing cabbage\\".Growing the Peking cabbage (in Russian)  Origin  The first notation of napa cabbage cultivation date from the 15th Century in the Yangtze River region in China. Then it spread to Korea and Japan. Beginning in the 19th Century with the Chinese diaspora, it was distributed to the rest of Asia, Europe, America as well as Australia. During the 16th century cabbage was first introduced to America from Europe and supply of seed materials from Europe continued till World War I. After the blockade of European seed supply, the US government research institutes and people in the seeds business developed new seed stocks for vegetable crops. Oregon and California were the cabbage seed production areas during that time.Genetics, Genomics and Breeding of Crop Plants (2011) N. Ramchiary, S. Park, X. P. Lim: Classical Breeding and Genetic Analysis of Vegetable Brassicas. Book 2.Clemson University, USA Today it is cultivated and eaten throughout the world. Napa cabbage might have originated from natural hybridization between turnip (Brassica rapa subsp. rapa) and pak-choi (Brassica rapa subsp. chinensis). Artificial crosses between these two species and also molecular data strengthened this suggestion.Sadowski, J., & Kole, C. (2011). Genetics, genomics and breeding of vegetable brassicas. Enfield: Science Publishers.  Description  The leaves, which are the harvested organ, lay side by side densely, are lime green coloured with white leaf veins and have a smooth surface. The vegetable has an oval form and weighs 1–3 kg.W. Franke (1976) Nutzpflanzenkunde. - Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany The leaves are organized in basal rosettes. The flowers are yellow and have a typical Brassicaceae cross-linked arrangement, hence the name Crucifereae, which means “cross-bearing”. Because the plant is harvested in an earlier stage than flowering, normally the flowers are not visible on the field. It develops similar to other head-forming leaf vegetables, for example cabbage lettuce. The chronological stages on the BBCH-scale are germination, leaf formation, vegetative growth (head-forming), appearance of the sprout that bears the flowers, flowering, fruit development, seed ripening and senescence.Feller, C., Bleiholder, H., Buhr, L., Hack, H., Hess, M., Klose, R., et al. (1995). BBCH-Codierung der phänologischen Entwicklungsstadien von Blattgemüse (kopfbildend). In U. Meier, Entwicklungsstadien mono- und dikotyler Pflanzen: BBCH Monografie (S. 120). Biologische Bundesanstalt für Land und Forstwirtschaft. Napa cabbage is an annual plant that reaches the generative period in the first year. It must be consumed in its vegetative period, so there is a challenge in cultivation not to reach the stadium of flowering. The stadium of flowering can be initiated by cold temperatures or the length of the day. Napa cabbage reproduces mainly by allogamy. Napa cabbage produces more leaves, bigger leaves and a higher biomass under long day conditions than under short day conditions.Nerlich, K., Pfennig, J., Kleemann, G., Feike, T., Graeff, S., Claupein, W., et al. (2009). Beschreibung von Wachstum und Entwicklung bei Chinakohl (Brassica rapa L. var. pekinensis) in Abhängigkeit von Temperatur und Tageslänge - Basisdaten zur Modellierung mit DSSAT. 45.

As a vegetable  Napa cabbage and tofu soup Napa cabbage is a cool season annual vegetable which grows best when the days are short and mild. The plant grows to an oblong shaped head consisting of tightly arranged crinkly, thick, light-green leaves with prominent white veins. Innermost layer leaves feature light yellow color. Napa cabbage belongs to the family Brassicaceae, commonly called the mustard or cabbage family. As a cruciferous plant it is closely related to species of Brassica like broccoli, bok choy and cauliflower.Genetics, Genomics and Breeding of Crop Plants (2011) Clemson University, USA Cartea M. E., Lema M., Francisco M, Velasco P. Napa cabbage is widely used in China, Japan, and Korea. Napa cabbage is used as a sign of prosperity in China, and often appears as a symbol in glass and porcelain figures. The Jadeite Cabbage sculpture of Taiwan's National Palace Museum is a carving of a napa cabbage variety. It is also found in North American, European and Australian cities after Asian immigrants settled in the regions. In Korean cuisine, napa cabbage is the main ingredient of baechu- kimchi, the most common type of kimchi, but is also eaten raw as a wrap for pork or oysters, dipped in gochujang. The outer, tougher leaves are used in soups. It can be used in stir-fry with other ingredients, such as tofu, mushroom and zucchini. It is also eaten with hot pot meals. Napa cabbage is particularly popular in South Korea's northern Gangwon Province. In European, American and Australian kitchens, it is more common to eat it cooked or raw as salad.Michael Todt (1989) Untersuchungen zur Mikroflora des lagernden Chinakohls (Brassica pekinensis Rupr.). Dissertation, University Kiel, Germany The vegetable is rich in vitamin C (26 mg/100g) and has a fair amount of calcium (40 mg/100g).Deutschen Forschungsanstalt für Lebensmittelchemie, 5. Auflage, (1994) Souci/Fachmann/Kraut. It tastes mildly aromatic.  Cultivation  Napa cabbage can be cultivated in many different areas of the world, the main area of diversification represents Asia.  Soil requirements  Napa cabbage requires deeply loosened medium heavy soil. There must not be any compaction due to plowing. The crop achieves particularly high yields on sandy loam. Extremely sandy or claylike soils are not suitable.Buschbaum, H., & Heinen, B. (1978). Chinakohl. Bonn: Rheinischer Landwirtschafts-Verlag. The crop prefers a pH range from 6.0 to 6.2, a high organic matter content and good moisture holding capacity of the soil. Lower pH or droughty soil can lead to calcium or magnesium deficiency and internal quality defects.Cook, W. P., & Smith, P. (February 1996). Oriental Cabbage Production. Hort. Leaflet 68, S. 1-4  Climate requirements  Napa cabbage needs much water during the whole growth period.Baggaley, A., Barter, G., Caldon, H., Rosenfeld, R. L., Ruch, P., Vowles, D., et al. (2011). RHS Good fruit & veg guide. London: Dorling Kindersley Limited. Often an irrigation system is needed, especially for August and September. The required amount of water depends on the stage of crop growth, weather conditions, and soil type. The most critical stage after establishment is when the head is forming. Inadequate water at this time will result in reduced uptake of calcium. This condition causes dead leaf tips within the head which makes it unmarketable. During head formation, of water per week is needed to maintain sustained growth rates. Temperature requirements are low. Temperatures below 0C are tolerated for short time periods; persistent frosts below -5 °C are not endured. Too low temperature can induce premature bolting. The plants perform best under temperatures between 13 °C and 21 °C, but depending on the cultivar.Rimmer, R. S., Shattuck, V. I., & Buchwaldt, L. (2007). Compendium of Brassica Diseases. St. Paul: American Phytopathological Society.  Seedbed requirements & sowing  Napa cabbage has very small seeds with a thousand kernel weight of about 2.5–2.8 g. For professional cultivation it is recommended to use disinfected seeds to prevent onset diseases. With the single grain seed technique, about 400–500 g seeds per hectare is required, for normal seed technique about 1 kg per hectare. If normal seed technique is used, the seedlings must be thinned out after 2–4 weeks. The seeds should be deposited 1–2 cm deep, with a row width of 40–45 cm and 25–30 cm distance between the seeds. The seedlings can be grown in the greenhouse and then transplanted into the field after 2–3 weeks. Earlier harvest can be achieved with this method. Seventy thousand to 80,000 seedlings per hectare are required. The transplanting method is normally used for the spring crop and the seeding technique for the fall crop.  Fertilization, field management  The nutrient removal of napa cabbage is high: * 150–200 kg N per hectare * 80–120 kg P2O5 per hectare * 180–250 kg K2O per hectare * 110–150 kg Ca per hectare * 20–40 kg Mg per hectare Fertilizer recommendations are in the range of the nutrient removal.Ackermann, I., Funk, M., Hintze, C., Joachimi, A., Potzkai, G., Rieger, W., et al. (1993). Feldgemüsebau : Buschbohnen, Chinakohl, Dicke Bohnen, Erbsen, Einlegegurken, Grünkohl, Knollensellerie, Kohlrabi, Kopfkohl, Kopfsalat, Möhren, Porree, Rote Beete, Schälgurken, Spargel, Spinat, Zwiebeln . Münster- Hiltrup: Landwirtschaftsverlag. Organic fertilizer must be applied before sowing due to the short cultivation time of napa cabbage and the slow availability of organic fertilizers. Synthetic N fertilizer should be applied in 3 equal doses. The last application must happen before 2/3 of the cultivation time is over to avoid quality losses during storage. Weeds should be controlled mechanically or chemically.  Harvest, storage and yield  Harvested napa cabbage being loaded on a truck in Tonghai County, Yunnan Napa cabbage can be harvested 8–12 weeks after sowing. The harvest work is mostly done by hand. The plant is cut 2.5 cm above the ground. It is usual to harvest several times per field to achieve consistent cabbage quality. Cabbages will keep in good condition for 3–4 months in cool stores with 0-1 °C and 85-90 percent relative humidity. Napa cabbage achieves a yield of 4–5 kg per m2.  Breeding  Brassica rapa species are diploid and have 10 chromosomes. A challenge for breeding of napa cabbage is the variable self-incompatibility. The self-incompatibility activity was reported to change by temperature and humidity. In vitro pollination with 98% relative humidity proved to be the most reliable as compared to greenhouse pollination. A lot of work has already been done on breeding of napa cabbage. In the 21st century, 880 varieties of Napa cabbage were registered by the Korea Seed and Variety Service. Breeding of napa cabbage was started by the Korean government research station of horticultural demonstration in 1906 to overcome starvation. As napa cabbage and radish are the main vegetables for “Kimchi” research focused on increasing yield. The most important person for this process was Dr. Woo Jang-choon who bred hybrid cultivars with self-incompatibility and contributed to commercial breeding by developing valuable materials and educating students. The main purpose of the hybrid cultivar was high yield and year-round production of napa cabbage after 1960. To enable year round production of napa cabbage, it has to be modified to tolerate high and low temperatures. Normally sowing in the late summer and harvesting in late autumn can produce high quality vegetables. As an example, a summer cultivar called “Nae-Seo-beak-ro” was developed 1973 by a commercial seed company. It tolerates high temperatures, could endure high humidity in the monsoon, and showed resistance to viral disease, soft rot and downy mildew. The low temperature in early spring reduces the quality of the vegetable and it cannot be used for “Kimchi”. In the 1970s the developing of winter cultivars started. The majority of new cultivars could not endure the cold winter conditions and disappeared. The cultivar “Dong-Pung” (meaning “east wind”) was developed 1992 and showed a high resistance to cold temperature. It is mostly used in Korea, where fresh napa cabbage is nowadays cultivated all year round. In the 70s, one seed company developed the rose-shape heading variety while other seed companies focused on semi-folded heading type. As a result of continuous breeding in the commercial seed companies and the government research stations, farmers could now select what they wanted from among various high quality hybrids of Chinese cabbage. The fall season cultivar 'Yuki', with white ribs and tight leaf folding, gained the RHS's Award of Garden Merit (AGM) in 2003. In 1988, the first cultivar with yellow inner leaf was introduced. This trait has prevailed until today. A very important breeding aim is to get varieties with resistance to pests and diseases. There exist varieties with resistance to turnip mosaic virus but as mentioned above, there exist numerous other diseases. There have been attempts to breed varieties with clubroot resistance or powdery mildew resistance but the varieties failed due to bad leaf texture traits or broken resistances.  Pests and diseases   Fungal diseases  Alternaria diseases are caused by the organisms Alternaria brassicae, Alternaria brassicicola and Alternaria japonica. Their English names are black spot, pod spot, gray leaf spot, dark leaf spot or Alternaria blight. The symptoms can be seen on all aboveground plant parts as dark spots. The infected plants are shrivelled and smaller than normal. Alternaria diseases infect almost all brassica plants, the most important hosts are oilseed brassicas. The fungus is a facultative parasite, what means that it can survive on living hosts as well as on dead plant tissue. Infected plant debris is in most circumstances the primary source of inoculum. The spores can be dispersed by wind to host plants in the field or to neighbouring brassica crops. This is why cross infections often occur in areas where different brassica crops are cultivated in close proximity. The disease spreads especially fast when the weather is wet and the plants have reached maturity. Alternaria brassicae is well adapted to temperate regions while Alternaria brassicicola occurs primarily in warmer parts of the world. Temperature requirement for Alternaria japonica is intermediate. There exist some wild accessions of Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis with resistance to Alternaria brassicae but not on commercial cultivars. These resistances should be included to breeding programmes. Alternaria epidemics are best avoided by management practices like at least 3 years non-host crops between brassica crops, incorporation of plant debris into the soil to accelerate decomposition and usage of disease-free seeds. Anhracnose is a brassica disease caused by Colletotrichum higginsianum] that is especially damaging on napa cabbage, pak choi, turnip, rutabaga and tender green mustard. The symptoms are dry pale gray to straw spots or lesions on the leaves. The recommended management practices are the same as for Alternaria diseases. Black root is a disease that infects mainly radish, but it also occurs on many other brassica vegetables inclusively napa cabbage. It caused by the fungus Aphanomyces raphani. The pathogen can persist for long times in the soil, therefore crop rotations are an essential management tool. White leaf spot is found primarily in temperate climate regions and is important on vegetable brassicas and oilseed rape. The causal organism is Mycosphaerella capsellae. The symptoms are white spots on leaves, stems and pods and can thus easily be confused with those of downy mildew. The disease spreads especially fast with rain or moisture and temperature is between 10 and 15 °C. Yellows, also called Fusarium wilt, is another Brassica disease that infects oilseed rape, cabbage, mustards, Napa cabbage and other vegetable brassicas. It is only a problem in regions with warm growing seasons where soil temperatures are in the range of 18 to 32 °C. The causal organism is Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conlutinans. Napa cabbage is relatively tolerant to the disease; mostly the only external symptoms are yellowing of lower, older leaves. The disease is soil borne and can survive for many years in the absence of a host. Most cruciferous weeds can serve as alternate hosts. Damping-Off is a disease in temperate areas caused by soil inhabiting oomycetes like Phytophthora cactorum and Pythium spp. The disease concerns seedlings, which often collapse and die. Other diseases that infect napa cabbage: * black leg or phoma stem cancer: Leptosphaeria maculans * clubroot: Plasmodiophora brassicae * Downy mildew: Hyaloperonospora brassicae * Powdery mildew: Erysiphe cruciferarum * Rhizoctonia solani * Sclerotinia sclerotiorum  Bacterial diseases  Bacterial soft rot is considered one of the most important diseases of vegetable brassicas. The disease is particularly damaging in warm humid climate. The causal organisms are Erwinia carotovora var. carotovora and Pseudomonas marginalis pv. marginalis. The rot symptoms can occur in the field, on produce transit or in storage. Bacteria survive mainly on plant residues in the soil. They are spread by insects and by cultural practices, such as irrigation water and farm machinery. The disease is tolerant to low temperatures; it can spread in storages close to 0 °C, by direct contact and by dripping onto the plants below. Bacterial soft rot is more severe on crops which have been fertilized too heavily with nitrogen, had late nitrogen applications, or are allowed to become over-mature before harvesting. Black rot, the most important disease of vegetable brassicas, is caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris.

Nematodes are disease agents that are often overlooked but they can cause considerable yield losses. The adult nematodes have limited active movement but their eggs contained within cysts (dead females) are readily spread with soil, water, equipment or seedlings.

The main elements of MTV EXIT's campaign include: # On Air; the production and broadcast of both dedicated and peripheral campaign exposure. # On the Ground; awareness-raising events including large-scale concerts, youth sessions, roadshow events and community screenings. # Online; production and maintenance of a multi-language, youth-oriented awareness and prevention website. In June 2004, MTV EXIT Foundation and Sida (Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency) joined in an alliance to combat trafficking in women for sexual exploitation in Europe. The campaign was branded as MTV EXIT, and launched in July 2004 at the EXIT Festival in Novi Sad, Serbia & Montenegro. In 2007, MTV EXIT expanded across MTV's channels in Asia and the Pacific in partnership with USAID, AusAID, Walk Free, and ASEAN. The campaign features similar elements to the European initiative. MTV EXIT in Asia and the Pacific is focusing on three major forms of trafficking in Asia and the Pacific: sex trafficking and forced prostitution, labour trafficking, and forced domestic servitude. Also, due to the complexities of trafficking and the differences found geographically, the campaign is split into two regions: Asia-Pacific and South Asia. Taking into consideration all outputs of MTV EXIT including their partnerships with over 50 anti-trafficking NGOs across Europe and Asia, the alliance has directly reached an estimated 7.5 million people through television, events, and the Internet, and countless more through additional media coverage generated.

A total of 14 men from the Christian village of Eilabun (Eilaboun) were killed, 12 of them executed by the Israeli forces after the village had surrendered. The remaining villagers were expelled to Lebanon, living as refugees for some months before being allowed to return in 1949 as part of an agreement between the state of Israel and Archbishop Maximos V Hakim. It was one of the few Arab villages to which most of the displaced were eventually able to return.Morris, p. 110. The Massacre was documented by the documentary film Sons of Eilaboun by Hisham Zreiq, a film based upon the events as told by the villagers.  Overview  Christian villages, which were usually friendly or not hostile to the Yishuv, were generally left in peace by Yishuv forces. The forces of Fawzi al-Qawuqji's Arab Liberation Army (ALA) occupied Eilabun. On the 12th of September 1948, two Israeli soldiers were killed on a nearby hilltop, Outpost 213. The severed heads of the Israeli soldiers were carried by the ALA troops and inhabitants of the village in a procession through the village.Morris, pp. 479, 499 (note 107). The story of the two decapitated soldiers also appears in narratives of the Arab al-Mawasi massacre, which occurred on November 2, 1948. The two soldiers went missing in the attack on 'Outpost 213' on September 12. Israeli intelligence reports attributed their mutilation to the 'Arab al-Mawasi tribe, and reported that one head was taken to Eilabun and the other to Maghar. After a battle outside the village in which six Israeli soldiers were injured and four Israeli armoured cars were destroyed, a battle that was part of Operation Hiram, the Golani Brigade's 12th Battalion, entered the village on 30 October 1948 and the population surrendered. Villagers flew white flagsMorris, p. 475. and were escorted by four local priests. Most of the villagers were hiding in two churches. The soldiers however were angry due to battle losses, the earlier procession, and possibly the discovery of a rotting head in one of the houses. According to a letter by village elders, one villager was killed and another wounded by IDF fire while assembling at the IDF's orders in the village square. The IDF commander then selected 12 young men, ordered that the 800 assembled inhabitants be led to nearby Maghar, and then stayed behind to execute the 12 men. Another old man was killed by fire from an armoured car on the way. Some 42 young men were kept in a POW detention camp, and the inhabitants were expelled to Lebanon. About fifty-two villagers were left in Eliabun, mainly the elderly and children. The village priests complained bitterly about the expulsion of the villagers and demanded their return. Following a United Nations investigation and pressure from the Vatican and discussion within the Israeli government, the villagers were allowed to return and receive Israeli citizenship as part of a 1949 agreement between the state of Israel and archbishop Maximos V Hakim in return for Hakim's future goodwill. The event was documented in a report by the United Nations observers.Palumbo, p. 164. Citing the United Nations Archives 13/3.3.1, box 11, a document entitled \\"Atrocities September–November.\\" On p. 165, there is a sketch of the village rendered by Captain Zeuty showing where the victims were killed and where they were buried. In 1983 the victims were commemorated by a memorial monument adjacent to the Christian cemetery in Eilabun.

Biography Early life Walding was born in Christchurch, in 1926. He went to school in that city. When he was 15, he joined the New Zealand Merchant Navy and later the British Merchant Navy. The impressions that he gained through the war shaped his outlook on life. He became a carpenter after the war, working in the Wellington area. He married Eileen Norma Walding (née Paul) of Feilding in 1950. They had six daughters. After the marriage, the couple moved to Palmerston North. Walding joined his mother's catering business, Smith and Walding. Together with his brother Charlie, he developed the company into a successful venture. In 1957, Walding established Prepared Foods Co Ltd, a gourmet food and canning business with an export focus. Political career Walding was first elected a member of the Palmerston North City Council in 1959; councillors were already elected for three year terms at that time. He was re-elected in 1962 and 1965. Having been elected to Parliament in 1967, he did not stand for the City Council again in 1968. Walding stood unsuccessfully against Bill Brown for the seat in the . Following Brown's sudden death in 1967, Walding successfully contested the resulting against four others: Gordon Cruden (National Party), John O'Brien (Social Credit Party), Goldingham (Progress) and Jamie Wedderspoon (Democratic Labour). Walding represented the Palmerston North electorate for the next eight years. During the Third Labour Government between 1972 and 1975, he was Minister of Overseas Trade, Minister for the Environment, Minister for Sport and Recreation and Associate Minister of Foreign Affairs. As Minister of Overseas Trade he made major trading market breakthroughs with both China and the Soviet Union in response to New Zealand's need to grow overseas markets after the United Kingdom cut trading ties after joining the European Common Market. At the same time he still was able to achieve favourable concessions from the United Kingdom. He solved New Zealand's problem with a beef sales quota to the United States while on a visit to Mexico. He convinced Mexico to sell its beef supply to the United States allowing New Zealand to sell more of its beef surpluses to Mexico instead of the Unites States. Both countries benefitting from the arrangement. In 1973 he made the first official visit by a minister to China since the 1949 Chinese Communist Revolution and famously rode a bicycle down the Great Wall of China. As Minister for Sport and Recreation he initiated the \\"Come Alive\\" campaign in 1973 which urged Kiwis to get active and participate in sport and other physical hobbies. In 1975 he was defeated by John Lithgow for the Palmerston North seat. Following his defeat he was elected vice-president of the Labour Party at the 1977 party conference (after failing to win the presidency) and was re-elected at the 1978 conference. In 1978 he in turn defeated Lithgow to regain the Palmerston North seat and return the parliament. Labour was still in opposition and he was appointed Shadow Minister of Trade and Industry and later Shadow Minister of Overseas Trade. In 1979 he stood again for the Labour Party presidency but was defeated by Jim Anderton 586 votes to 527. Six months prior to the , he announced his retirement from Parliament citing ill-health. He later became a key advisor to David Lange while he was leader of the opposition and was heavily involved in Labour's successful election campaign. During the campaign he accompanied Lange on his hectic schedule of public hustings as an organiser and confidante earning him the title \\"Mr Lange's minder\\". High Commissioner In late 1984, he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. In March 1985 he made a rare official visit to the Soviet Union and met with Soviet Premier Konstantin Chernenko just before Chernenko's death. Death Three months after starting the position, he died on 5 June 1985 in London. He collapsed following an evening dinner at his official residence in Chelsea before being rushed to St. Stephen's Hospital shortly after 10pm. He was survived by his wife and six daughters. Walding's wife, Eileen Walding, was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for community service in the 1990 New Year Honours. She died in Havelock North on 8 June 2017.

In 1914 he became one of the first airmen trained for the Australian Flying Corps (AFC), and the following year was among the first AFC members to see action when he was deployed to the Middle East with the Mesopotamian Half Flight. After carrying out several missions behind Turkish lines, he was captured in November 1915 but escaped in July 1918. White was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and twice mentioned in despatches for his war service. He married Vera Deakin, a Red Cross worker and daughter of former Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, in 1920. White began his parliamentary career in 1929 when he was elected to the House of Representatives as the Member for Balaclava in Victoria. He served as Minister for Trade and Customs in Joseph Lyons' United Australia Party government from 1933 to 1938, but resigned when he was excluded from Lyons' inner cabinet. He joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War and saw service in Australia and the United Kingdom. Returning to parliament as a member of the newly formed Liberal Party in 1945, he served as Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation in Robert Menzies' government from 1949 to 1951. His term coincided with the commitment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency. Australia's High Commissioner to the United Kingdom from 1951 to 1956, White was knighted in 1952 and died in October 1957. Early life Thomas Walter White was born on 26 April 1888 at Hotham, North Melbourne. He was the son of Charles James White, a brass-finisher from England, and Emily Jane (née Jenkins) of Victoria. Educated at Moreland State School, White joined the Citizen Forces as a trumpeter in 1902. He served in artillery and engineering units for the next eight years. In January 1911 he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 5th Australian Regiment. He was promoted to lieutenant in June 1912, and to captain in November 1913. First World War In August 1914, two weeks after the outbreak of the First World War, White became one of the first four students to commence training at Point Cook as a pilot in the Australian Flying Corps (AFC).Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 3–4 He was later described by a biographer as \\"pugnacious and impatient for success, with a disdain for authority and a suspicion of elites\\".Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 7 White recalled flying in the school's Bristol Boxkite: \\"The senses took the place of the instruments. One's eyes and ears did duty as engine counters; the rush of the air in the face told whether the climb or glide was at the right angle.\\"Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 8 In September he crashed the Boxkite into Point Cook's hangar while attempting to land in a crosswind; the dent he made was never repaired, and came to be recognised as part of the base's history.Campbell-Wright, An Interesting Point, pp. 38, 164 The Australian Aero Club held its inaugural meeting at Point Cook in October; White was the club's first secretary.Campbell-Wright, An Interesting Point, p. 39 The following month, he graduated from his flying course with his fellow students, who included the future Chief of the Air Staff, Richard Williams.Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 10 Captain White (second left) with Captain alt=Four men in khaki military uniforms, two wearing pith helmets (one of whom has his arm in a sling), seated behind a boy In April 1915, White was appointed a captain in the Australian Imperial Force and adjutant of the Mesopotamian Half Flight, the first AFC unit to see active service.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 1–3 Based initially in Basra on the Shatt-el-Arab waterway and operating primitive Maurice Farman biplanes, the Half Flight assisted the Indian Army during the Mesopotamian campaign, conducting reconnaissance and sabotage missions against Turkish forces. The Farmans were only capable of top speeds of , while the desert wind could reach , meaning that the aircraft often made no headway or were simply blown backwards.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 5–6 White carried out several reconnaissance and bombing operations behind enemy lines.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 16–19 On a mission in October 1915, he was forced to land owing to engine trouble and, rather than risk attempting repairs, taxied the aircraft some past enemy troops while his observer, Captain Francis Yeats-Brown, kept watch with his rifle at the ready; the \\"Keystone Cops adventure\\", as historian Alan Stephens described it, culminated in the engine finally powering up and allowing White to take off and fly to the safety of the Australian base.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, p. 7Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, p. 19 White himself touted the feat as \\"a taxi-ing record\\".Molkentin, Fire in the Sky, p. 19 The following month, he undertook a search for Major General George Kemball, whose seaplane had gone missing between Kut and Aziziyeh; White located the missing plane near a large Arab encampment, and despite being fired on by the tribesmen was able to rescue the general and transport him to Aziziyeh.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 19–20 On 13 November 1915, White was captured on a mission to cut telegraph wires near Baghdad. After damaging their aircraft on landing, White and Yeats-Brown were fired on by Arabs and Turks; Yeats-Brown succeeded in destroying the wires while White held off their attackers with rifle fire. The men attempted to taxi their aircraft away but were overpowered and beaten by Arabs before being handed over to Turkish troops.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, p. 22 White was mentioned in despatches in July 1916. He was initially imprisoned in Mosul, then in Afion Kara Hissar, enduring harsh conditions. In July 1918 he was being transported by rail to Constantinople when his train was wrecked and he escaped. Disguising himself as a Turk, he hid in a Ukrainian cargo ship berthed in Constantinople harbour. After a month the ship sailed for Odessa, where White remained another month using a fake Russian passport.Cutlack, The Australian Flying Corps, pp. 27–28 His experience of the Soviets in Odessa helped inform his subsequent anti-communism. He then stowed away on a hospital ship bound for Bulgaria, and made his way to London in December. White was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross in June 1919. That December, he was again mentioned in despatches, for \\"valuable services whilst in captivity\\". He subsequently published an account of his wartime exploits as Guests of the Unspeakable. Early parliamentary career Thomas Walter White While in London, White met Vera Deakin, a Red Cross worker and daughter of former Australian Prime Minister Alfred Deakin, and soon became engaged to her. Departing Britain in September 1919, White returned to Australia via the United States and was discharged from the AIF in January 1920. He married Vera on 22 March at St John's Church of England in Toorak, despite the opposition of some of the Deakin family, including her brother-in-law Herbert Brookes. White, whose sympathies tended towards small business, considered Brookes a \\"business bully\\", hiding behind \\"the protection of capital\\". Also in 1920, White became managing director of his father's hardware company, C.J. White & Sons Pty Ltd. He continued to serve in the Citizen Military Forces (CMF, the renamed Citizen Forces), receiving promotion to major in July 1922, and commanding the 6th Battalion as a lieutenant colonel from March 1926 to March 1931. In 1923 he was awarded the Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration, which recognised twenty years of service. White enlisted as a special constable when Victorian police went on strike in November that year; he would later express support for groups such as the New Guard. White ran as a Nationalist for the House of Representatives seat of Maribyrnong in the 1925 federal elections, but lost to the sitting Labor member, James Fenton, 19,483 votes to 28,621. In 1927, he failed to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Prahran. After the Nationalists declined to endorse him as a candidate for the Senate the following year, he won the seat of Balaclava at a by- election held on 3 August 1929. He defeated his only opponent, Independent Nationalist Frederick Francis, with 28,642 votes to 16,063, to succeed retiring member William Watt. White used his maiden speech in parliament to push for construction of the Australian War Memorial in Canberra. In the federal election held that October, he defeated the Labor contender, Donald Cameron, 31,700 votes to 22,445. The United Australia Party (UAP) came to power in the December 1931 federal elections; White was returned by a margin of 30,294. In January 1933, White was appointed Minister for Trade and Customs in Joseph Lyons' first Ministry, replacing Henry Gullett, who had stood down due to ill-health. White had given up the directorship of C.J. White & Sons the previous year. Although he personally favoured protectionism, his portfolio was responsible for reducing tariffs, as well as attempting to increase trade with Britain as opposed to the United States and Japan. He was also in charge of book and film censorship; for the latter he established an advisory board, chaired by Robert Garran, to make recommendations to him. In the September 1934 federal elections, White retained Balaclava by a margin 25,769 votes. That year he became Australian chairman of the Royal Life Saving Society, serving until 1951; he was also an active supporter of such organisations as Legacy and the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Vera White, who had been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for her wartime work, also pursued philanthropic activities, holding management or committee roles with the Royal Children's Hospital, the Victorian Society for Crippled Children and Adults, and the Red Cross. The October 1937 federal elections saw White returned by a margin of 20,954. In July 1938, he represented Australia at an inter-governmental conference on Jewish refugees held at Évian, France, to discuss the growing numbers of Jewish emigrants seeking to leave Germany and occupied territories. He sympathised with refugees he spoke to during the conference, but hedged his offer of support, saying that, \\"As we have no real racial problem, we are not desirous of importing one by encouraging any scheme of large-scale foreign migration\\". Australia agreed to accept 15,000 refugees over three years.Sykes, Cross Roads to Israel, pp. 198–199 White's reaction to the Australian government's support for the Munich Agreement was to diarise: \\"I think we should hang our heads that we did not stand up to the bully of Europe ... It may yet mean peace but at what price?\\"Martin, Robert Menzies: A Life – Volume I, p. 237 He called for stronger preparations at home in case of war, including the introduction of conscription.Henderson, Joseph Lyons, p. 412 On 8 November 1938, White resigned his portfolio, having discovered that Lyons had established an inner cabinet from which he was excluded; he was succeeded as Minister for Trade and Customs by John Perkins. Lyons' response in parliament to White's resignation publicly highlighted the divisions in the UAP.Henderson, Joseph Lyons, p. 419 White stood for the UAP's leadership after Lyons' death the following year, but was eliminated early in the balloting; Robert Menzies narrowly defeated Billy Hughes in the final ballot. Second World War and later parliamentary career alt=Informal head-and-shoulders portrait of Thomas Walter White in and unidentified man in background, both wearing air force uniforms with peaked caps Following the outbreak of the Second World War, White transferred from the CMF to the Citizen Air Force, the active reserve of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF),Coulthard-Clark, The Third Brother, p. 226 as a flight lieutenant (temporary squadron leader). He took leave from parliament in April 1940 and was appointed the inaugural commanding officer of No. 1 Initial Training School (ITS) at Somers, Victoria.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 97 In this capacity he was responsible for the first group of Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS) trainees in Australia, thirty-five student aircrew. In the September 1940 federal election, White defeated Labor's Charles Sandford with 43,876 votes to 17,135. He relinquished command of No. 1 ITS in September 1941; at this time the school was training over 900 pupils.RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, pp. 44–45 White was subsequently posted to England, initially to oversaw the Australian contingent at RAF Station Bournemouth.Gillison, Royal Australian Air Force, p. 35 Arriving at Bournemouth as a wing commander in November 1941, he proceeded to organise EATS graduates from Australia into their own distinct section under the RAF's No. 3 Personnel Reception Centre. He also facilitated improvements in accommodation, services, and postings for the Australians at Bournemouth.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, pp. 124–127 In June 1942, he became RAAF Liaison Officer at RAF Flying Training Command, where he worked to improve procedures for commissioning and promoting Australian airmen.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 541 By May 1943, the Australian contingent at Bournemouth had outgrown its facilities and transferred to Brighton, where White was given command of the RAF station.Herington, Air War Against Germany and Italy, p. 551 According to the Parliamentary Library of Australia, White also \\"surreptitiously flew on several sorties as a second-pilot\\" while in Britain. He paid tribute to the men of EATS with the narrative poem Sky Saga. White returned to Australia to contest the August 1943 federal election, defeating Labor's John Barry with 38,698 votes to 28,271. He served at the RAAF Staff School, located at Mount Martha, Victoria, until his retirement as an honorary group captain;RAAF Historical Section, Training Units, p. 178 he was medically discharged on 28 October 1944. The same month, he attended the conference that resulted in the establishment of the Liberal Party, which succeeded the UAP; the new party was officially launched under Robert Menzies' leadership in August 1945. In June 1946, now as the Liberal member for Balaclava, White unsuccessfully called for a royal commission into problems of command in the RAAF during the war.Helson, The Private Air Marshal, pp. 316–318 He retained Balaclava by a majority of over 13,000 in the September 1946 federal election, defeating Labor's Maurice Ashkanasy. A boundary redistribution prior to the December 1949 federal elections reduced Balaclava from 84,000 voters to just under 43,000; White retained the seat against the Labor contender by a margin of 14,361. Following the Liberal Party victory, White was appointed Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation, despite his personal animosity towards Menzies, which partly stemmed from the latter's failure to serve in the First World War.Martin, Robert Menzies: A Life – Volume II, pp. 129–130 He took over his portfolios from Arthur Drakeford, who had held them for eight years.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 15, 326 In January 1950, White and the Minister for Supply and Development, Richard Casey, announced that the English Electric Canberra had been selected to replace the RAAF's Avro Lincoln bombers and that the new jet would be manufactured by the Government Aircraft Factory in Victoria. White's term as Minister for Air saw the deployment of RAAF squadrons to the Korean War and the Malayan Emergency in mid-1950, and the establishment of the Women's Royal Australian Air Force, the successor organisation to the wartime Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, that November.Stephens, The Royal Australian Air Force, pp. 205, 209, 244 The following year he gave his approval for the manufacture of a Rolls Royce-engined licensed version of the North American F-86 Sabre jet fighter for the RAAF, and played a major part in the controversial decision to replace the long-serving Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal George Jones, with an RAF officer, Air Vice Marshal (later Air Chief Marshal Sir) Donald Hardman.Stephens, Going Solo, pp. 73, 347Helson, The Private Air Marshal, pp. 348–352 White also sought to strengthen the Citizen Air Force, and personally ordered the establishment of No. 24 (City of Adelaide) Squadron at Mallala, South Australia.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 326 Later life and legacy White in 1950 White secured his tenth election victory in Balaclava in the April 1951 federal election, defeating Labor's Arthur Lewis by 10,700 votes. On 21 June, he resigned from parliament to become Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, a position he held until 1956. He was succeeded as the member for Balaclava by Liberal Percy Joske, as Minister for Air by Philip McBride, and as Minister for Civil Aviation by Hubert Anthony. White was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in January 1952. As High Commissioner he advocated continued British migration to Australia and participated in the renewal of the assisted passage scheme between the two countries in 1954. He was succeeded by Sir Eric Harrison. After returning to Australia, White lived in Melbourne. He suffered from emphysema and on 13 October 1957 died of a heart attack at his home in South Yarra. Survived by his wife and four daughters, he was accorded a state funeral at St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne, and interred at Point Lonsdale cemetery. The T.W. White Society, founded in 1982, sponsors an annual prize for thoracic research awarded through the Thoracic Society of Queensland. White's daughters donated his papers to the National Library of Australia in 1997 and 1998.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016. \\"Diocese of Vigevano\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved March 9, 2016. History The earliest notices of Vigevano date from the tenth century, when it was favoured as a residence by King Arduin for hunting. In the next period it was a Ghibelline commune, and was accordingly besieged and taken by the Milanese in 1201 and again in 1275. In 1328 it surrendered to Azzone Visconti, and thereafter shared the political fortunes of Milan. In the last years of the Visconti domination it sustained a siege by Francesco Sforza. Until 1530 the town belonged to the Diocese of Novara and had a collegiate chapter. Francesco Sforza procured the erection of the see and provided its revenues. The Duke of Milan's interest in Novara was not purely philanthropic. With the Treaty of Worms (1743) the diocese became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. The first bishop was Galeazzo Pietra, succeeded by his nephew Maurizio Pietra (1552); both of these promoted the Tridentine reforms, and the work was continued by their successors. Marsilio Landriani (1594) distinguished himself in various nunciatures and founded a Barnabite college for the education of young men. Giorgio Odescalchi (1610) was a very zealous pastor; the process of his beatification has been commenced. Giovanni Caramuel Lobkowitz (1675) was an example of pastoral activity and the author of many works, philosophical, theological, ascetical etc., though his Theologia fundamentalis was censured.Cf. Pier Marino Sonnani (1688), a Minorite, who enlarged the seminary, maintained a struggle against the spread of the doctrines of Miguel Molinos. Nicola Saverio Gamboni was appointed to the see by Napoleon in 1801. In 1817, after the agreements at the Congress of Vienna, which returned the Kingdom of Sardinia to the House of Savoy after French occupation, the diocese of Vigevano was augmented.Lorenzo Mazzini, pp. 183–188. The church which became the Cathedral of Vigevano was initially built in 1100, and then rebuilt in the sixteenth century through a commission by Duke Francesco II Sforza. The facade of the second and current structure was re-designed by Cardinal Juan Caramuel y Lobkowitz in 1673 (completed c. 1680). The Church of S. Pietro Martiere was built, with the adjacent Dominican convent, by Filippo Maria Visconti in 1445; the convent is now used for government offices and courts. Among the civil edifices is the castle, once a fortress, built by Bramante in 1492, by order of Ludovico il Moro, which became a royal palace.

Life  Tractatio geometrica de quadratura circuli, 1595 Christmann, a Jew who converted before 1578 to Christianity, studied Orientalistics at the University of Heidelberg's Collegium Sapientiae and became teacher at the Dionysianum. He followed humanist Thomas Erastus to Basel and continued his study tour in Breslau, Vienna and Prague. In 1578, Pfalzgraf John Casimir founded the Reformed Casmirianum at Neustadt an der Haardt. Christmann joined the Casimirianum faculty in 1582 and dedicated his Arabic language Grammar, Alphabetum arabicum, to his colleagues there. After the return of the Reformed faith to the Electorate of the Palatinate, Christmann returned to Heidelberg to serve on the faculty of the Collegium Sapientiae in 1584. After some internal debate about the location of the chair, Christmann was appointed professor of Hebrew at the university in 1585. He compiled a catalog of the manuscripts of Guillaume Postel (1510–1581), located since 1551 at Heidelberg Castle. In 1590 he published a Latin translation of the astronomy of Al- Farghani. In 1609 at the urging of Elector Frederick IV, he was appointed Europe's second professor for the Arabic language.

Rheticus took it to Leipzig and Cracow (1554–1574) and to Košice (Kaschau), where he died and left it to his pupil and colleague Valentin Otho (1545–1603), who took it to Heidelberg, where Jakob Christmann (1554-1613) added his remark. From his widow the manuscript was sold on 17 January 1614 to Comenius (1592–1670), who left a remark signed as Johannes Amos Niuannus.

Active in Antwerp, he was influenced by the works of the Dutch architectural painters Hendrik van Steenwijk the Elder and the Younger.Frans Baudouin, \\"Pieter Neefs (i),\\" Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, [accessed 26 November 2007]. His principal contribution to the genre were his nocturnal church interiors lit by two light sources. Life The year of birth of Pieter Neefs is not known with certainty. It is placed some time between 1578 and 1590.Pieter Neefs (I) at the Netherlands Institute for Art History He is believed to have been born in Antwerp. His father was Aart Neefs, a cloth merchant and innkeeper who had difficulty making ends meet after losing most of his fortune during the Spanish Fury. Pieter's mother was Margaretha Verspreet. Liberation of Saint Peter The name of the teacher of Pieter Neefs has not been preserved, In 1610 Pieter became a free master of the Antwerp Guild of St Luke. He established himself as a specialist of church interiors, a genre that had been relatively little practiced in Flanders before him. He became so successful with his architectural paintings that he was able to get leading Antwerp painters to paint the staffage in his works.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 609–614 Pieter Neefs married Maria Louterbeens on 30 April 1612. The couple had five children of whom the second and third-born Lodewijk and Pieter became painters. Their works were very close to their father's, and attributions of their individual hands can be difficult.Frans Baudouin. \\"Neefs.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 25 September 2016. A church interior with elegant figures strolling and figures attending mass Despite his success Pieter Neefs appears to have suffered financial difficulties. His only pupil was Laureis de Cater, who turned out to have insufficient talent to become admitted as a master to the Guild. The artist died some time between February 1656, when he is recorded dealing with an inheritance, and 1661, when he is recorded as deceased by the biographer Cornelis de Bie in the volume of his Het Gulden Cabinet, which appeared in 1661. Work Pieter Neefs the Elder was a specialist of architectural interiors. His most frequent subject is the interior of churches and cathedrals. He also painted a few interiors of dungeons. His works depict existing churches as well as imaginary churches. On a few occasions he signed his works with den auden neefs (the old Neefs). Generally speaking, the works he made before c. 1640 when his son Pieter the Younger became involved in the workshop are superior in quality. It is possible that works attributed to either Pieter the Elder and the Younger are, in fact, by Lodewijjk of Ludovicus, the least-known member of the Neefs family. His works show the influence of the Dutch painters Hendrik van Steenwijk I the Elder and the Younger, in particular of the latter. This has led to the assumption by some art historians that he may have studied under either of these artists.Pieter Neefs, The Interior of a Gothic Church with Elegant Company at Sphinx Art Pieter Neefs is known to have painted several copies of Steenwyck compositions, including his earliest dated church interior of 1605.Pieter Neefs the Elder, The Interior of a Gothic Church by Night at Johnny van Haeften Interior of a Gothic Church Father and son van Steenwijck and the two generations of the family Neefs painters are considered to be representatives of the Antwerp school of architectural painting. Typical for their style was the use of a rigid linear perspective which offers a view directly down the nave of the church. This style was also adopted by the Dutch painters Dirck van Delen and Bartholomeus van Bassen.Sergiusz Michalski, Rembrandt and the Church Interiors of the Delft School, in: Artibus et Historiae, Vol. 23, No. 46 (2002), pp. 183-193 Neefs' compositions are characterised by their deeply receding spaces, created through the use of linear perspective and contrasting areas of light and dark. Neefs was very skilled in the handling of tonal variety and by moving from light to shade he was able to bring into play the effect of outside or internal light on the church interior. Neefs took this variation in his treatment of light further still, by often depicting nocturnal scenes in church interiors. While nocturnal scenes of church interiors were likely an innovation of Hendrick van Steenwyck the Elder, Pieter Neefs became one of the principal practitioners of the genre. An important proportion of his work is devoted to such views. Some of these nocturnal scenes were intended as pendants to daylight scenes. Many of Neefs' painting drew inspiration from the Cathedral of Antwerp, in particular its vast nave. However, rarely did he create realistic depictions of existing architectural structures. Most of his compositions depict imaginary churches, which are often more or less loosely based on real church structures. Neefs would vary elements of the architecture of actual churches to which he added paintings and sculptural details of his own invention. The Interior of a Gothic Church by Night The figures in the architectural views by the various Neefs were painted by such artists as Frans Francken the Younger and Frans Francken III, Jan Brueghel the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx, Adriaan van Stalbemt, David Teniers the Younger, Gonzales Coques and Bonaventura Peeters the Elder. The works of Pieter Neefs the Elder and Younger have been called propaganda for the Catholic Counter Reformation. They typically show the interior of churches loosely based on Antwerp Cathedral in which the whole panoply of Catholic ecclesiastical activity is going on, in particular the Catholic sacraments such as baptism, communion, marriage, Mass, confession, the giving of alms, etc. All of these activities were often included in a single composition in a church swarming with priests and bristling with statues and paintings.Tilman Seebass.

The capacity car is a Gunderson Maxi-IV. A well car, also known as a double-stack car or stack car (also well wagon), is a type of railroad car specially designed to carry intermodal containers (shipping containers) used in intermodal freight transport. The \\"well\\" is a depressed section which sits close to the rails between the wheel trucks of the car, allowing a container to be carried lower than on a traditional flatcar. This makes it possible to carry a stack of two containers per unit on railway lines (double-stack rail transport) wherever the structure gauge assures sufficient clearance. The top container is secured to the bottom container either by a bulkhead built into the car (e.g., bottom and top containers are the same dimensions of 40 ft.), or through the use of inter-box connectors (IBC). Four IBCs are needed per wellcar. In the process of an inbound train becoming an outbound train, there are four processes: unlock to unload the top container of inbound train, remove then unload bottom container, insert after loading bottom container of outbound train, lock after top container loaded. Advantages to using well cars include increased stability due to the lower center of gravity of the load, lower tare weight, and in the case of articulated units, reduced slack action. Double-stack cars are most common in North America and Australia where intermodal traffic is heavy and electrification is less widespread; thus overhead clearances are typically more manageable. In India double stacking of containers is done on flatcars under high catenary because the wider Indian Gauge permits more height while keeping the centre of gravity still low.  History  articulated double-stack car, with five wells. This one was built by Thrall and is owned by Pacer Stacktrain. Note that there is no bottom, which would make it unsuitable for carrying road trailers. Southern Pacific Railroad (SP), along with Malcom McLean, devised the first double-stack intermodal car in 1977.Cudahy, Brian J., - \\"The Containership Revolution: Malcom McLean’s 1956 Innovation Goes Global\\". - TR News. - (c/o National Academy of Sciences). - Number 246. - September–October 2006. - (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document)Chronological History - Union Pacific Railroad Company SP then designed the first car with ACF Industries that same year.Kaminski, Edward S.

(High-Tech Railroading)\\". - Railway Age. - (c/o HighBeam Research). - September 1, 1990 At first it was slow to become an industry standard, then in 1984 American President Lines started working with the Thrall Company to develop a refined well car and with the Union Pacific to operate a train service using the new well cars. That same year, the first all \\"double stack\\" train left Los Angeles for South Kearny, New Jersey, under the name of \\"Stacktrain\\" rail service. Along the way the train transferred from the UP to CNW and then to Conrail.  Multiple unit cars  Each unit of a double-stack car is constructed with a single well, but are often constructed with multiple units of three to five units, connected by articulated connectors. Articulated connectors are supported by the centerplate of a single truck, (often a 125-short-ton, 112-long-ton or 113-tonne capacity truck but sometimes a 150-short-ton, 134-long-ton or 136-tonne capacity one). Also, in a number of cases, multiple single-well cars (usually 3 or 5) are connected by drawbars and share a single reporting mark. On both types of multiple-unit cars, the units are typically distinguished by letters, with the unit on one end being the \\"A\\" unit, and the unit on the other end being the \\"B\\" unit. Middle units are labeled starting with \\"C\\", and going up to \\"E\\" for five-unit cars starting from the \\"B\\" unit and increasing towards the \\"A\\" unit.  Carrying capacity  53' 48' 45' 40' and 20' containers stacked Double-stack cars come in a number of sizes, related to the standard sizes of the containers they are designed to carry. Well lengths of , and are most common. A number of wells and wells also exist. (The sizes of wells are frequently marked in large letters on the sides of cars to assist yard workers in locating suitable equipment for freight loads.) On 40', 45', 48', or 53 cars, larger containers (45' or up) are often placed on top of smaller containers that fit in the available wells to efficiently use all available space. All wells are also capable of carrying two 20 ft ISO containers in the bottom position.Guide to Railcars Some double-stack cars have been also equipped with hitches which allow them to carry semi-trailers as well as containers. These are known as \\"all-purpose\\" well cars. Articulated well cars typically have a capacity of per well. As highway weight limits in the US restrict most containers to less than this is adequate for two containers stacked. Some single well cars have capacity for two fully loaded containers. Foreign and domestic intermodal trains Foreign (from a US/Canada perspective) intermodal trains carry 20, 40, 45 and 53-foot containers to and from coastal container ports to import or export intercontinentally. However, 53-foot containers are rarely shipped outside North America. Domestic intermodal trains carry 53-foot containers or trailers on flatcars and they travel throughout North America.flatcar Econo Stack or Twin Stack well car Econo Stack well cars are a variation of conventional well cars and their main purpose is to give the double stacked containers more support.

The seat of the municipality is the town Aridaia.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The municipality has an area of 985.817 km2. Name and history Map of the Kingdom of Macedon with Almopia located in the central districts of the kingdom. The name Almopia (, Almōpia) derives from the Almopes (), a Paeonian tribe that originally inhabited the area during Antiquity. The Almopes traced their descent to the eponymous mythological figure of Almops, son of Poseidon and Helle. According to Thucidydes, the Almopes were expelled from the region when it was incorporated into the ancient Macedonian kingdom during the reign of Alexander I (r. 498–454 BC).Thucydides, History of the Peloponnesian War, II.99 The 2nd-century astronomer and geographer Claudius Ptolemy records three cities in the region in his Geography: Horma (), Europos () and Apsalos (). In the early Byzantine period, the area was renamed to Enotia (Greek: Ενωτία) after a nearby fortress, probably in the vicinity of modern Notia. The name was revived between 1915 and 1927 for the Greek province as well.ΦΕΚ 304/27-12-1927 In the later Middle Ages, the area was known as Moglena (Greek: Μογλενά, , ), from the Slavic word for \\"fog\\". Until the early 11th century, Moglena was a province of the First Bulgarian Empire. Captured by the Byzantine emperor Basil II in 1015, it is attested as the seat of a bishopric in 1020, and as capital of its own theme in 1086. The area remained under Byzantine rule until the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, when it was captured by Tsar Kaloyan of the Second Bulgarian Empire. It was incorporate in the Serbian Empire by Stefan Dušan in 1346. Moglena was inhabited mainly by Megleno-Romanians and Slavic people. In Ottoman times, the region was also known by its Turkish name Karacova or Karadjova valley (\\"Black Valley\\", Greek: Καρατζόβα). Until the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922) and the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1924, Muslim Vlachs and Pomaks inhabited a large part of the regions of Moglena.Theodor Capidan, Meglenoromânii, istoria şi graiul lor , vol.

He was born with a genetic defect called syndactylism, a condition wherein two or more digits are fused together. As a result, the middle finger of his left hand was amputated as a child, and the bone was inserted into his thumb. Seattle Mariners Hinchliffe was drafted by the Seattle Mariners straight out of Bishop Gallagher High School in Detroit in the 16th round of the 1992 Major League Baseball draft, and spent most of his ten-year career in their farm system. He made his Major League Baseball debut on April 5, against the Chicago White Sox at the Kingdome, pitching three innings and allowing two earned runs. His first major league start came on April 18 against the Anaheim Angels. After Hinchliffe hit Angels third baseman Troy Glaus with a pitch in the first inning, Angels starter Steve Sparks retaliated on Ken Griffey Jr. in the third. When Glaus led off the fourth with a home run, Hinchliffe hit the following batter, Todd Greene, with a pitch, inciting a bench clearing brawl. Hinchliffe & Greene would be ejected from the game. He made seven appearances, as both a starter and reliever, compiling a 0-2 record and 11.29 earned run average before being demoted to the Mariners' Pacific Coast League affiliate, the Tacoma Rainiers mid-May. Hinchliffe went 9-7 with a 5.15 ERA as a starting pitcher at Tacoma to earn a call back up to Seattle that September. He made four appearances upon his return, going 0-2 with a 5.11 ERA. Anaheim Angels He was released in January, and somewhat ironically became teammates with Glaus on the Anaheim Angels shortly afterwards. He appeared in back-to-back games against the Kansas City Royals on May 20 & May 21, but spent most of the season in the Pacific Coast League. He went 2-3 with a 3.80 ERA mostly out of the bullpen with the Edmonton Trappers before being dealt with Keith Luuloa to the Chicago Cubs for Chris Hatcher, Mike Heathcott & Brett King.

He was a professor of education at Winston-Salem State University in North Carolina for 21 years, and served two terms in the North Carolina General Assembly. He had also taught education at West Virginia State College. Dr. Hauser described himself as the \\"second strike\\" against segregated travel in America for refusing to move to the back of a bus in 1947, the \\"first strike\\" being credited to Irene Morgan Kirkaldy, a black woman whose refusal to give up her bus seat to white passengers in 1944 led to a landmark United States Supreme Court decision more than 10 years before Rosa Parks. \\"C.B.\\" Hauser was born on a farm in the small southern town of Yadkinville, North Carolina, the third of thirteen siblings. He believed that he learned leadership skills while growing up on the farm because, as third oldest child, he had to help take care of his many younger siblings, while at the same time doing his chores and getting whatever education he could in what he called \\"this 'no stop sign' small segregated southern town.\\" He said, \\"All that personal history gave me a fortitude, which I drew on that day in 1947 on that Greyhound bus going to West Virginia.\\" He later said that he did not sit on the back seat of the bus that October day because he knew the Supreme Court had ruled that interstate passengers were not subject to state Jim Crow laws. He felt that as an educated U.S. citizen who had served his country in time of war, having spent 44 months fighting overseas, he was determined to exercise his right as a citizen. He had served with the U.S. Army 582-641st Ordnance and Munitions Division. Promoted to Staff Sergeant, his exemplary service was recognized with a Good Conduct Medal, an Eastern Theater of Operations Ribbon, and Five Battle Stars. As a veteran, he took full advantage of the GI Bill, earning his masters degree and a doctorate in education from the University of Pennsylvania. He also attended Catholic University and Texas Southern University, becoming a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He enlisted in the Army with the ambition of becoming a commissioned officer or a warrant officer, but was ultimately denied a commission despite fulfilling all mental and physical exams. He attributed this to racial discrimination. For his refusal to move to the back of a Greyhound bus while traveling from Winston-Salem to his teaching job at West Virginia State College, Hauser was arrested and jailed. He recalled that as talk of lynching and mob violence swirled around him, he remained composed and unafraid. At one point he even heard someone shout \\"Get the rope!\\" In recalling this years later he said, \\"Like in the war as the bombs exploded and the possibility of death filled the air, I just concentrated on what I needed to focus on to survive.\\" He was, as President John F. Kennedy famously said of their generation, \\"Tempered by war.\\" Upon his release on bail, he set about planning his legal response. During the months that followed, prior to his day in court, he considered filing a lawsuit for false arrest. He also felt that his case might provide a test of the constitutionality of North Carolina segregation laws. The judge ruled that his arrest was unconstitutional, stating that he had the right to sit wherever he pleased. The judge further stated that, having sworn to uphold the United States Constitution, he was obliged to throw the case out of court. The Atlantic Greyhound Lines was ordered to pay a judgment of $2,000. With the money Dr. Hauser bought a car, elated that he \\"didn't have to take the bus again!\\" In taking such his action, Dr. Hauser followed the path of Elizabeth Jennings Graham. A century before Rosa Parks' famous stand, and 90 years before that of Irene Morgan Kirkaldy, Graham was 24-year-old schoolteacher who was ejected from a horse drawn New York City streetcar because she was a woman of color. She took her case to court, and was victorious. Although a lifetime member of the N.A.A.C.P., Dr. Hauser resisted requests to take a more active role in the civil rights movement, preferring to contribute to the effort in his own way. He retired from teaching in 1977, going on to serve two terms in the North Carolina General Assembly in the early 1980s. A decorated war veteran, he died on Veterans Day at age 90. Quote In speaking of his role in the legal battle for equal treatment in public transportation, Dr. Hauser said: \\"Everybody's heard the expression \\"three strikes you're out!\\" Well, that's what it came down to when Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on that Alabama day in [1955]. The laws were in place. The masses were ready for a change. The leadership had been developed. And the time had finally come.\\" \\"...Irene Morgan was the first strike against the Jim Crow laws with her 1944 Virginia court challenge.

It was a continuation of an earlier conflict between the two belligerents which had ended just months earlier, after Sweden and Denmark brokered a peace agreement in Roskilde in 1658. In the aftermath of that conflict, the Swedish king Charles X Gustav desired to add the province of Royal Prussia in Poland to the Swedish realm, but his position in the region was not strong enough with the opposition of Brandenburg and Austria.Frost, p. 180. However, the Danes stalled and prolonged the fulfillment of some provisions of the earlier peace; the Swedish king decided to use this as a pretext to attack with an ambitious goal: to vanquish Denmark as a sovereign state and raze the capital of Copenhagen. A quick and decisive defeat of Denmark was however only seen as a means to a greater end. The long-term goal was to wage war in Europe without fearing Danish interference. The Swedish army surrounded Copenhagen, hoping to starve it into submission. This failed when the Dutch Republic joined the conflict on the Danish side and a reinforcing fleet managed to smash its way through the Swedish naval forces in Øresund. Charles then tried a decisive assault on the city, hoping to conquer it and win the war; this plan likewise failed. Brandenburg, Poland and Austria then also joined the war against the Swedes. Charles X fell ill in early 1660 and died in February of that year. With the death of the Swedish king, one of the major obstacles to peace was gone and the Treaty of Oliva was signed with the Allies (the Poland, Austria and Brandenburg). However, the Danes were not keen on peace after their recent successes and witnessing the weakness of the Swedish efforts. The Dutch retracted their blockade, but were soon convinced by the Danes to support them again. The French and English intervened for the Swedish and the situation was again teetering on the edge of a major conflict. However, the Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested negotiated a peace treaty without any direct involvement by foreign powers and the conflict was resolved with the Treaty of Copenhagen, where Sweden was forced to return Bornholm to Denmark and Trøndelag to Norway. The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present day.  Background  Charles X of Sweden had concluded the earlier war with Denmark with a stunning victory by succeeding in the bold March across the Belts. Denmark-Norway had been forced into a humiliating peace in the Treaty of Roskilde in which Denmark had to cede Scania, Halland and Blekinge on the Scandinavian Peninsula and the island of Bornholm, and Norway lost the provinces of Båhuslen and Trøndelag. Europe was stunned by the quick victory, and Charles proudly publicized his accomplishments. However, peace meant new problems. In the peace treaty of Roskilde, Denmark was obliged to supply the Swedish army with provisions until May 1658, but soon thereafter the army would need to be moved. The Swedish king knew that the army would not be able to be supplied in Sweden for long, and disbanding it was not desirable with the Poles eager to revenge the 1655 invasion of Poland. Sweden was not in want of enemies to attack: campaigns in Livonia and Estonia were considered, but were rejected due to supply problems. The Swedish King maintained that his main goal was to invade Royal Prussia, but he also wanted to punish Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia. The many enemies in continental Europe, among them Poland and a hostile Dutch would make this a difficult endeavor however. A new attack on Prussia would also see little international support, France was already urging peace. The surprising Swedish solution to this dilemma would be to return to Denmark in an attempt to finish the job.Frost, pp. 180-181 When the Danish stalled and prolonged the fulfillment of some provisions of the earlier peace treaty the Swedish king decided to use this as a pretext to attack with a breathtaking goal: to vanquish Denmark as a sovereign state, raze the capital of Copenhagen and divide the country into four administrative regions. This would allow Sweden to control the Baltic Sea and bring in large customs revenues. However, even this ambitious goal was just to be stepping stone towards the ultimate plan of a quick conquest of Denmark so that the Swedes could wage a campaign in Europe without risking Danish interference.Englund, p. 601  Events  In June 1658 it was decided that the Swedish forces would attack. On August 6, 1658 a fleet of 70 ships with 5,700 men and 18 pieces of light artillery embarked upon a journey to Denmark. Since the previous war, Jutland was still occupied by Swedish troops and there were troops on Fyn. In addition to this, Field Marshal Gustav Otto Stenbock had assembled reinforcements in Scania in Southern Sweden.Englund, p. 602 The plan was for the Swedish army to march on Copenhagen.Isacson, pp. 187-188  Siege of Copenhagen  The Danes prepare the defences of Copenhagen. Painting by Heinrich Hansen. On August 11, 1658 Charles X and his forces reached Valby hill (current day Frederiksberg) from where they could overlook the Danish capital. His arrival was expected and Danish King Frederick III had already ordered every building outside the city walls burnt, even though it had housed a third of the population of the city. That same day the city gates were closed and would not open again for another 22 months. A Swedish fleet of 28 ships blocked the harbor, preventing resupply by sea. The siege had begun.Isacson, p. 191 When the Swedish king arrived to find half the city in flames and the Danes willing to put up a fight he had a difficult decision to make, whether to press forward immediately or whether to lay siege on the city and try to starve it out. His advisers were divided on the issue, and the king ultimately decided on the latter route. The wisdom of this decision has been questioned, since the Danish defenses were in poor shape initially. However, the population of Copenhagen rallied behind Frederick III, and the walls, moats and other defensive structures of the city were quickly improved. A large number of cannons were brought into the city from ships anchored in the harbor and placed along likely attack routes. The city also had plenty of defensive materiel: of lead, 4,000 muskets, and a staggering of slow match.Isacson, pp. 192–196 The Swedish siege force consisted of 11 brigades and 16 squadrons comprising 4,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 50 cannons. The Swedes took the outer defensive perimeter, built in 1625 by Christian IV, which had fallen into disrepair. It was hastily repaired and artillery was brought to bear on the city.Isacson, p. 197 The Danes would not let the Swedish attack go uncontested, and made several counter-attacks. On August 23, 1658 almost 3,000 students, sailors and soldiers staged a surprise sortie through a hidden passage in the wall,This sally would later become known as \\"Generaludfaldet\\" in Danish history. destroying fortifications under construction and capturing three cannons.Isacson, pp. 198–199 Over 200 heated shot a day were hurled into the city, and several large howitzers were brought to bombard the Danish capital, including the 300-pounder \\"Eric Hansson\\", earlier used in the siege of Krakow.Englund, p. 615 But the citizens of Copenhagen proved to be resilient and endured the constant barrage.Isacson, p. 203  Kronborg captured  Colonel Poul Beenfeldt, Danish commander of Kronborg. In a 1649 treaty the Dutch had pledged to defend Denmark against unprovoked aggression, and from a Swedish point of view it was essential to establish naval supremacy in Øresund to keep the Dutch out should they decide to intervene in the conflict. Kronborg Castle sat near the narrowest part of Øresund, a sound only four kilometres wide, which gave the castle a supreme strategic importance. Frederick III had appointed the colonel Poul Beenfeldt commander of the castle and ordered him to defend it at all costs. Should he fail in that, Kronborg was to be blown up to prevent the Swedes from using it.Isacson, p.204 On August 16 the Swedes arrived at Helsingør, took shelter in the city and started bombarding the castle with artillery. The Danes returned the fire, attempting to set the city on fire. They managed to destroy a dozen houses, but the fire did not spread enough to cause a conflagration. Danish artillery rained continually on the Swedish soldiers. However, the Swedish force still managed to advance, taking the outer line of defenses. The mood in the castle darkened, and Beenfeldt's courage wavered. The Lord High Admiral of Sweden, Carl Gustaf Wrangel, resorted to subterfuge and spread the rumor that Copenhagen had fallen and the Swedish soldiers started a false celebration. Discouraged and demoralized, the Danes capitulated. The loss of Kronborg was a blow for the Danish; 77 captured cannons were quickly put to use in the siege and with the castle in Swedish hands, it was believed that the Dutch would have a difficult time to come to aid.Isacsson, pp.204–207  Battle of the Sound  The Battle of the Sound was fought on October 29, 1658. Painting by Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten, 1660. Despite Swedish hopes that the Dutch would not enter the conflict, they honored their 1649 treaty by sending a 45-ship relief fleet. On October 7, 1658 the Dutch fleet set sail from Vlie. Two weeks later, on October 22, it anchored northwest of Helsingør, unable to proceed for six days due to wind conditions. Wrangel suggested the Swedes should attack, but Charles X still wanted to avoid provoking the Dutch.Frost, p. 182; Isacson, p. 208 On October 29 at eight o'clock in the morning, a shot was heard from the Dutch flagship. It was the signal to advance and smash the Swedish line. The Dutch fleet was divided into three squadrons. Vice Admiral Witte de With on the 54-gun ship Brederod and his 11-ship squadron led the charge, followed by Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam on the 72-gun Eendracht with 13 ships in the squadron. The last squadron, led by Pieter Floriszoon had 11 ships. In total, the Dutch fleet consisted of 45 ships with 1,838 cannons and 4,000 sailors. Following the warships, many transports with large quantities of food and supplies as well as 28 regiments of experienced soldiers followed, in total 2 300 men. Standing against them was a Swedish navy force led by Carl Gustaf Wrangel and Admiral Klas Hansson Bjelkenstjerna, consisting of 43 ships, with 1,605 cannons and 4,055 sailors. The Swedes also had great hopes that the coastal artillery of Kronborg would inflict great damage. Charles personally fired the first hostile shot from Kronborg, but it fell short; the Dutch had wisely chosen to sail closer to the Swedish side, where there were fewer land-based guns to contend with. The Swedish force had more guns, but the Dutch had the advantage of the wind. In the narrow straits of Øresund, nearly a hundred warships now battled.Isacson, pp. 208–212 The engagement was confusing for both sides, and the view was soon obscured by gunpowder smoke. Many ships on both sides were badly damaged, and around 2,000 men killed or wounded. Towards the end, a squadron of Danish ships met up with Dutch and escorted them into the harbor of Copenhagen. The Swedish fleet had failed; much-needed reinforcements and supplies had reached the beleaguered Danish town. The combined Danish and Dutch fleet now had control of the seas, forcing the Swedish fleet to seek refuge in the harbor of Landskrona on the Swedish mainland.Isacson, pp. 212–215  Attack on Copenhagen  Swedish assault on Copenhagen, February 11, 1659. Painting by Poul Steffensen (1898). Major general Fabian von Fersen, commander of one of the attacking divisions during the assault on Copenhagen. After six months of siege the Dutch had re-opened the sea lanes. Charles now faced a difficult choice: if he tried to sue for peace, the conditions would have been worse than the previous peace. The other option was an all-out attack on Copenhagen, hoping that conquering the city would end the war. The number of Swedish attackers are somewhat uncertain, roughly 8,000 men, comprising 4,500 infantry, 2,000 cavalry, 1,000 sailors and a few hundred gunners. The king planned the attack meticulously, but neglected to uphold adequate secrecy; the Danes were soon fully aware of the details of the Swedish attack plan thanks to a number of deserters and spies able to move between the encampments. The Danes had 6,000 trained soldiers, and an additional 5,000 men and women from the city had also taken up weapons, bringing the number of defenders to 11,000.Isacson, p. 216–217 The Swedish forces had performed diversionary attacks on the outskirts of the city on two consecutive nights in order to tire the defenders, and at midnight on February 11, 1659, the main attack commenced. The main spearhead of the Swedish forces attacked from south of St. Jørgens lake with the King himself in overall command.Isacson, p. 218–220 A hundred cannons on Slotsholmen were brought to bear on the Swedish attackers with fast and accurate fire. The two attacking divisions advanced nevertheless, led by major general Fabian von Fersen and major general Johan von Essen. They reached the outer palisades on the ice, which were quickly breached, but the Swedes were immediately stopped by holes in the ice that the Danes had cut. The bridges they had brought were not long enough after the ice moats had been widened with the help of Dutch marines. Caught on the ice, the Swedes were in the open and subject to heavy fire. Longer bridges were eventually brought, and the attack continued towards the city walls. The battle was ferocious, with the attackers desperately trying to establish a bridgehead on the walls. But in the end, the defenders were successful and the Swedes were thrown back.Isacson, p. 223–225 The northern attack force moved south towards Østerport where the fortification Kastellet laid. The Swedes got very close to Nyboder and were in the process of crossing the moat, when they fell victim to a well-conducted ambush, and withdrew with heavy losses.Isacson, p. 228 Around 6 in the morning, Charles X of Sweden knew that all attacks had failed. He ordered a retreat to the outskirts of the city, back to the starting position.Isacson, p. 229 The victory was important for the Danes. Not only had their arch-enemy been defeated, out of the smoldering city came a stronger bourgeoisie with renewed confidence, more privileges and an improved position vis-a-vis the Danish crown. In many ways, it was a new Denmark which emerged from the assault of its capital on February 12, 1659.Isacson, p. 229; Englund, p. 610  The Allies invade Funen  When the Swedish invaded Zealand in August 1658, the Dutch Republic was not the only foreign power that took notice.Isacson, p. 233 A union between Brandenburg, Poland and Austria had already started to put together a relief army in December 1657, but preparations of the polyglot force took so long that the Treaty of Roskilde was signed before the army was ready to march. However, the preparations were not in vain—with the 1658 invasion the allies were in an excellent position to quickly put together a force and march towards Denmark.Englund, p. 616 Thanks to the earlier preparations, a large force of 14,500 Brandenburgers under Frederick William, 10,600 Austrians led by the Italian Field Marshal Raimondo Montecuccoli and 4,500 Poles led by Stefan Czarniecki had crossed the Oder on September 14, 1658.Englund, p.617 Swedish possessions in Central Europe all along the Baltic coast were under attack, and the Austrians at least were enthusiastic in Pomerania sending an army of 17,000 to lay a siege on Stettin where they joined 13,000 Brandenburgers. and also moved towards Jutland. However, the anti-Swedish coalition suffered internal conflicts. The Polish opinion of Austria was in rapid decline, and their enthusiasm for the campaign was at best lukewarm.Frost, p. 182 Nevertheless, the allies managed to take possession over Jutland and the Swedish commander Philip of Sulzbach was forced into a long series of retreats. On May 19, 1659, the Swedes abandoned their last positions at Fredriksodde and took up positions at Funen. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, 1659 the first allied assault on Funen began with 9,000 soldiers. Against them stood 4,000 Swedes, considerably fewer, but consisting of battle-hardened veterans. The first attack was duly repelled. On June 26, a second attempt was made: the allies landed after heavy fire had pounded what was thought to be the Swedish positions. However, the Swedes had pulled back and returned unscathed with heavy fire of their own. The invaders were again thrown back. Before a third attempt could be made, a Swedish naval squadron under Owen Coxe managed to sink a large number of the invading fleet at the naval battle of Ebeltoft, and took 1,000 prisoners. In the end the allies had not succeeded to invade Funen, and a decision was taken to instead go back and attack Swedish Pomerania.Isacsson, pp. 242–43 Meanwhile, other European powers had decided that it was not in their interest that any one power should dominate the Baltic Sea. After long negotiations, known as the first Concert of the Hague, England sent a large fleet of 43 ships with more than 2,000 cannons. The force did not directly participate in fighting but nevertheless sent a clear message to the Dutch fleet patrolling the Danish waters. England worked hard to broker a peace, aided by France which also declared its willingness to help the Swedes if the Danes refused to negotiate.Isacsson, pp. 237–238  Battle of Nyborg  The landing at Kerteminde, at the island of Funen, on November 11, 1659 by one corps of the allied army consisting of Danish, German, Polish and Dutch troops under field marshal Hans Schack. Painting by Christian Mølsted. On November 11 Hans Schack and his forces boarded Dutch transport ships to take them to the east side of Funen. After some false starts, due to weather and Swedish resistance, he managed to land near Kerteminde. Major general Ernst Albrecht von Eberstein was in charge of the allied forces that had been left on Jutland, and was also moving towards Funen; landfall was made two days later without any Swedish resistance. Both Eberstein and Schack marched towards Odense, meeting up on November 12. So far, the invasion of Funen was going smoothly for the combined Danish and allied forces.Isacson, p. 248 Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter, the famous Dutch admiral who took command of an expeditionary fleet which managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark. The Swedish commander Sulzbach made a tactical error in not attacking either Schack or Eberstein before they could join up, even though his generals urged him to do so. Instead, he chose to withdraw to Nyborg. The Swedish king was not pleased and immediately sent Gustaf Otto Stenbock to relieve Sulzback of his command. When Stenbock arrived he found the city's defenses wanting and sent a note to the king that he could not guarantee that he would hold the city.Isacson, p. 249 Instead of immediately taking advantage of the situation, Eberstein and Shack quarreled over who should command the combined forces. The impasse was finally resolved by Ebestein and Shack by agreeing that they would hold command the forces every other day.Isacson, p. 250 The Swedish commanders had decided they must try to make a stand. A few kilometers west of Nyborg the Swedish forces of about 5,500 men stood in battle formation in the way of the advancing forces. The Swedes had a good position, with a small lake on the left flank and a forest on the right, providing good cover for a retreat to Nyborg should it be necessary. Opposing them were 9,000 men, with Eberstein in command that day. They divided into two lines, each commanded by the respective commanders. Thrice Eberstein attacked; only to be rebuffed by intensive Swedish fire and cavalry attacks. Eberstein himself was almost captured, only narrowly escaping.Isacson, p. 251 Even then, Eberstein refused to ask Schack for assistance in the battle. Colonel Ditlev Ahlefeldt of the allied forces would not to let pride and vanity be the downfall of the attack and pleaded with Schack to attack. Shack brandished his rapier and mounted a forceful attack into the Swedish left flank. A bloody engagement ensued, but the Swedish cavalry was no match for the rested Danish forces—they fled towards Nyborg leaving the infantry defenseless. The Polish riders showed no pardon, cutting down the Swedish infantry almost to a man.Isacson, p. 252 The Dutch also intervened with an expeditionary fleet led by Michiel Adriaenszoon de Ruyter. The Swedes had fought bravely. Salzback had personally dispatched 8 men. But their losses were heavy, over 2,000 men had been killed, almost half the force while the allies had lost 1,900 men. The defenses at Nyborg was in no condition to withstand a siege. There was nothing for the Swedish to do but to surrender, forcing 5,000 men into captivity; Sweden had suffered a devastating defeat.Isacson, pp. 252–253 The Latvian city of Mitau (Jelgava) fell to Polish-Lithuanian forces commanded by Aleksander Hilary Połubiński in January 1660 and the allies were preparing an invasion of Zeeland; the outlook was not good for the Swedes. Fortunately for them, the war would soon end.  Insurgencies  The Swedes were not popular in the regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to rise up against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, especially in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.Englund, pp. 697–700  Bohuslän and Frederikshald  Lieutenant general Jørgen Bjelke, Commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army. Painted around 1655. The fortress of Fredriksten above the town of Frederikshald in Norway was attacked by Swedish forces and repulsed by the Norwegian army three times during the years 1658–60. After each withdrawal the Swedes would return in greater force, but never succeeded in capturing the strong fortress. Norwegians called the battles in this theatre of war \\"bjelkefeiden\\" (\\"the Bjelke feud\\") after the commander-in-chief of the Norwegian army, lieutenant general Jørgen Bjelke. After each attack on Frederiksten, Bjelke invaded the former Norwegian province of Bohuslän and twice succeeded in reconquering most of it. The first Swedish attack on Frederikshald started on 14 September 1658 with a force of 1600 under Harald Stake, who falsely believed the town to be undefended. But Frederikshald was defended by two companies of the civic militia under captain Peder Olsen Normand, who had taken up a position on the Overberget hill south of the town. Detachments from the regiments of Oppland and Østfold with four cannons came to their rescue. The Swedish attackers were taken by surprise and were completely defeated the day after their arrival. The second battle of Frederikshald took place in February 1659. Harald Stake was back with 4000 men, who approached the town across the frozen inlet of Svinesund and opened artillery fire from the island Sauøya. He then let his infantry attack from the west across the river Tista. Its bridge was defended by some companies under Tønne Huitfeldt and Peder Normand. The Oppland and Østfold regiments together with four cavalry squadrons remained inside the town as strategic reserves. Bjelke, having arrived some days earlier, was in command of the Norwegian forces. The Swedes initially drove the defenders back across the Tista bridge, but were halted at the bridgehead. After heavy losses the Swedes retreated to the far side of the river. The Norwegians then prepared for a renewed attack by fortifying the weak spots around Frederikshald. An even greater Swedish force of 5000 soldiers (of which 3000 were cavalry) under Lars Kagg, Gustaf Horn and Harald Stake laid siege to Frederikshald in January 1660. They captured some forward defensive positions, but the sudden death of Charles X on February 13 was a probable cause for lifting the siege February 22.Bryhn 1978, pp.11-12  Trondheim  The Trøndelag province in which Trondheim is the largest city is situated in the center of Norway. As a result of the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the cession of Trøndelag had divided Norway into two parts with no land connection between the north and south. Later that year, however, Trøndelag was reconquered by Norwegian army units under their commander-in-chief, lieutenant general Jørgen Bjelke. Already on September 28, 1658, a small fleet of three ships and several smaller boats landed the Norwegian forces close to Trondheim. The Swedish governor Claes Stiernsköld had 120 cavalry and 600 infantrymen under his command with the Swedish ship Gotland in the harbor of Trondheim. Two Dano-Norwegian ships attacked Gotland, thought no significant damage was inflicted on either side.Isacson, p. 256 A small Swedish reinforcement force arrived in Trondheim, but both food and ammunition were in short supply. On October 4, the Norwegian forces arrived at the city reinforced by 1,000 peasants from the surrounding countryside who had taken up arms. When hearing that aid was near, the population of the city revolted, but the uprising within Trondheim was quickly suppressed. Charles X ordered Lieutenant Colonel Erik Drakenberg to assemble a force in Jämtland and march towards Trondheim, but the relief was stopped by Norwegian peasants that had taken to the hills and defended the mountain passages. The Norwegian forces increased the pressure on Trondheim and red-hot shot rained down on the city daily. Despite Stiernsköld's swearing to \\"boil soup on his leather pants before surrendering\\" he was nevertheless forced to leave the city on December 11. According to the terms of the surrender, Stiernsköld and his men were allowed to leave under military honors with 2,500 men presenting arms.Isacson, p. 258  Bornholm  On April 29, 1658 Bornholm was presented with its new governor: Colonel Printzensköld, who arrived with his family and 120 soldiers. Printzensköld soon enacted a number of unpopular taxes and many of the island's young men were conscripted. In addition, plague had hit the island hard 4 years earlier, killing 5,000 of the population of 13,000. The island was seething with anger and resentment, and after the Swedish invasion of Denmark Frederick III sent letters to leading men in the community, urging them to revolt. They wasted no time, and Printzensköld was shot dead during an inspection tour on December 8, 1659. The remaining Swedes, mostly Scanians who had little reason to be loyal to the Swedish King, surrendered. The Swedish navy was otherwise occupied and could offer no relief. Bornholm was again under Danish control.Isacsson, pp. 258–260  Scania  One of Frederick III's bodyguards, Statius, traveled to Scania to organize the peasants into Snapphane units and instigate anti-Swedish sentiment. In Malmö, a cabal of rich bourgeoisie, led by Bartholomaeus Mikkelsen, planned a revolt. The conspiracy tried to recruit one of Malmös two mayors, Efvert Wiltfang, but he would not commit himself to the uprising, even though he said he would support Frederick III. At the end of December, the Danes embarked on a foray into Scania, but were foiled by bad weather and poor navigation. Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities had become aware of the plot and the main leaders were arrested, among them Mikkelsen and Wildfang, and the conspirators were sentenced to death. On December 22, 1659 Mikkelsen and two others were beheaded, but in an attempt to placate the Scanian people the execution of Wiltfang and 10 others was stayed. The uprising had been averted, but rebels and insurgents continued to operate in the countryside.Isacson, pp. 260–263  Peace and aftermath  The political borders in Scandinavia in 1658. The areas in green were returned to Denmark-Norway in the 1660 peace treaty. Charles X fell ill in the beginning of 1660 and died of pneumonia on the night of February 13, 1660.Henrikson, p. 539 With the death of the Swedish king, one of the major obstacles to peace was out of the way; in April the Treaty of Oliva was signed with the Allies (Poland, Austria and Brandenburg). However, the Danes were not keen on peace after their recent success. After further concessions, the Dutch released the blockade on Landskrona, allowing the Swedish fleet out in the Øresund strait and blockade Copenhagen. Danish diplomacy soon got the Dutch back on their side again, and real war between Sweden and the Dutch Republic seemed imminent. The French and English intervened in favor of the Swedes and the situation was again teetering on the edge of a major conflict.Henrikson, pp. 541–542 The Danish statesman Hannibal Sehested was instructed by Frederick III to negotiate with the Swedes, and the resulting peace treaty can largely be credited to him. Without any direct involvement by foreign powers, the Danes and Swedes managed to negotiate the Treaty of Copenhagen within weeks, much to the surprise of both parties. A bone of contention was the islands of Hven and Bornholm, the latter having received the Danish king's personal promise of protection. In the end, Bornholm remained under Danish control in exchange for a number of estates in the south of present-day Sweden.Henrikson, p. 542 In the Treaty of Roskilde two years earlier, Denmark-Norway had been forced to cede the Danish provinces of Scania, Halland, Blekinge, the island of Bornholm and the Norwegian provinces Trøndelag and Båhuslen. The Treaty of Copenhagen reaffirmed the Swedish rule over Scania, Halland, Blekinge, and Bohuslän, while Bornholm and Trøndelag were returned. It was a significant victory for Denmark-Norway, but it did not result in a reversal of the costly earlier peace.Frost, p. 183 The treaty of 1660 established political borders between Denmark, Sweden and Norway which have lasted to the present. The bold March across the Belts had threatened Copenhagen so seriously that it had won the previous war for Charles. When his attempt to follow through with his previous venture failed, he proved unable to suppress militarily the combined forces of his foes. Sweden had come close to dominating the Baltic, which was not in the interest of the major powers. England, France and to a lesser extent the Netherlands all favored a return to the status quo of the Roskilde peace.Frost, pp. 182–183 In Denmark, the war resulted in sweeping social changes. Frederick III browbeat the nobility which had long held power in Denmark into accepting a hereditary and absolute monarchy.Frost, pp. 193-195  Notes   References   *  Further reading  * Ulf Sundberg (1998) Svenska krig 1521-1814.

The Federal Work-Study Program helps students earn financial funding through a part-time employment program. Approximately 3,400 institutions participate in the program. Program outline The Federal Work-Study Program provides a method for postsecondary education students to earn funds that are used toward their education. The program was formerly known as the College Work-Study Program. The FWS program helps students earn monetary awards towards their postsecondary education. The program is limited to students with on financial need, whose Expected Family Contribution is less than the cost of attendance. Eligible college students join work programs through their college. There are many different types of jobs that qualify for the program, and they vary significantly from one college to another. Students are assured of receiving at least federal minimum wage for the duration of their employment. The FWS program helps to ensure that college students who are truly in need of the money get the jobs. Federal Work-Study provides part-time jobs for undergraduate and graduate students with financial need, allowing them to earn money to help pay education expenses. The program encourages community service work and work related to the recipient's course of study. Process Federal Work Study funding is given to institutions to provide part-time work opportunities for students involved in certain majors. Federal funding is made to participating institutions based on requests made by the institutions. A statutory formula is used to help institutions determine the allocations to request. Once funds are allocated to each university, they then administer the funds. Once all the funds for the institution have been allocated no more students can participate that year. Students can apply for the Federal Work Study Program if they have financial need (see Expected Family Contribution). The students must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to qualify.http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/ The Department of Education : Free Application for Federal Student Aid Each institution provides its own restrictions on the way it allocates funds. The institution provides a number of different types of jobs both in their own institution as well as through private employers. The federally funded program encourages institutions to use the funds to help give back to the community. At least 7% of the jobs offered must be helping the community. Some of the jobs offered are often reading tutors for young children, literacy tutors and mathematics tutors. Other jobs can be on campus such as working in the library or student center or performing administrative functions in the office. Some institutions may have restrictions on the number of hours per week that students can work. Also, there may be restrictions that pertain to the student's grade point average. For example, if a student's grade point average slips below a certain point, the college may not allow the student to work through the FWS program.  Qualifying for FWS  In order to qualify for the Federal Work Study Program students must apply for federal assistance through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) program. The program is open to both undergraduate and graduate students. Students should check with the current requirements for FAFSA. Students can start to investigate the FAFSA as early as junior year of high school.http://www.ecampustours.com/payingforcollege/financialaidandfafsa/whatisworkstudy.htm eCampustours information about workstudy The Free Application for Federal Student Aid is open to all students who have need. The program will determine if students qualify and how much money they will receive. The FWS program is administered through the student's school. Each school has a different amount of funds available to give out for the program. Generally, International or foreign students do not qualify for the Federal Work-Study program. Students must be one of the following to receive federal student aid: * U.S. citizen * U.S. national (includes natives of American Samoa or Swains Island) * U.S. permanent resident who has an I-151, I-551, or I-551C (Permanent Resident Card). If students are not in one of these categories, they must have an Arrival-Departure Record (I-94) from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) showing one of the following designations: * Refugee * Asylum Granted * Cuban-Haitian Entrant, Status Pending * Conditional Entrant (valid only if issued before April 1, 1980) * Victims of human trafficking, T-visa holder or child of a T-1 visa holder. * Parolee: Students must be paroled into the United States for at least one year and must be able to provide evidence from the USCIS that they are in the United States for other than a temporary purpose and that they intend to become a U.S. citizen or permanent resident. Applying for FWS Students who wish to apply for the Federal Work Study Program must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). On the FAFSA application there will be an option that asks if the student would like to be considered for the work-study program. This option must be checked by the applicant. This will ensure that the student is considered for the Federal Work-Study program. The applicant's financial need will be determined based on their application. The students may be employed by any number of places including a federal, state or local agency, a private organization or by the institution itself. The student must indicate an interest in the FWS program on their application for FAFSA. If the student is eligible the amount of the FWS award will be listed along with the FAFSA award. Students who did not indicate an interest in the FWS program on their FAFSA can still get into the work program. Each institution has its own deadline for these funds. It is worth noting that the deadline for the Federal Work Study Program is typically earlier than the deadline for filing a FAFSA. Therefore it is important to apply as early as possible. Once the funds at the institution have been exhausted there are no further FWS funds to be provided. The amount of aid that a student may receive depends on the total amount of assistance that the student is receiving. To apply for the Federal Work Study program students should apply to their own school for a job. Each institution has its own campus-based program that will indicate the exact procedure for applying as well as the specific deadlines. Since the FWS program is typically a first- come-first-served program in most institutions, if the student applies after the deadline, the student will most likely not get in. The program will accommodate the number of students that it can through use of the money that was funded federally.  Department of Education on FWS  The US Department of Education said not all schools in the United States take part in the Federal Work-Study Program. One of the reasons is these institutions do not have sufficient funds for qualified students. An award does not guarantee the student a job. The awardees must find a work-study job to earn the funds. Some schools match their students with potential employment offers but many require their enrollees to apply and interview for vacant positions. The program is not guaranteed every school year. Students are advised to get in touch with their respective schools for specific awards criteria. The jobs can be inside or outside the campus. The type of work can be anything like assisting in the financial aid office or serving as research assistant. Off campus, options can be working for a public office or private not for profit organization. Some schools collaborate with private employers for work-study jobs.

It was composed by Leonard Bernstein with lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and is sung solo by the male lead character and tenor 'Tony'. The part of Tony was played by Larry Kert in the original Broadway production and by Richard Beymer (voiced by Jimmy Bryant) in the 1961 film. Production In his work Leonard Bernstein, Humphrey Burton explained: \\"When it was decided to add Tony’s first-act song “Something’s Coming,” Bernstein and Sondheim raided the scene- setting page in Laurents’s outline. “something’s coming,” Laurents had written: “it may be around the corner, whistling down the river, twitching at the dance – who knows?” The lines were incorporated in the lyrics. “We raped Arthur’s play-writing,” Bernstein said. “I’ve never seen anyone so encouraging, let alone generous, urging us, ‘Yes, take it, take it, make it a song.’”\\" Bernstein reported on the last minute change thus: Synopsis BBC.com explains: Composition BBC.com explains \\"The song opens and closes in D major. It modulates to C major for two contrasting sections of the song...The song opens with a syncopated accompaniment figure in 3/4 time. A similar repeated pattern is heard throughout. The pitches change to fit the harmony. The accompaniment stays in the background throughout so that the singer can be heard clearly. The opening accompaniment is played by clarinets (including bass), pizzicato (plucked) strings, drum kit (snare drum and hi-hat cymbal, played with wire brushes)\\". The site also noted \\"the same bar of accompaniment is repeated several times...[as] this gives time for the actors to move across the stage and is a device often used in musicals. It noted that the song alternates between 2/4 and 3/4 time signatures, the word-setting is mostly syllabic (one word to a syllable), and that the song includes many examples of triplets. It also explains \\"'Something's Coming' does not follow a standard song structure such as verse and chorus. Instead it is held together by three ideas or themes which are heard throughout the song and presented in different ways.\\" The first theme has a \\"tritone between the bass note C and the F sharp in the vocal line. The F sharp resolves onto a G.\\", the second has \\"declamatory repeated notes and the use of accents\\", and the third has \\"long sustained notes, legato phrases and rising intervals\\". Critical reception Chichester.col.uk noted the song is meant to \\"capture...a sense of hope\\". AllMusic wrote of the Oscar Peterson Trio jazz version of the song \\"Something's Coming seems like a series of vignettes, constantly shifting its mood, as if moving from one scene to the next. \\"  Use in Exams  In 2008, the English exam board Edexcel added 'Something's Coming' to their Music GCSE syllabus, and is now used as one of the 12 set works covered in the course, under '20th Century Music'.

A member of parliament from 1859 to 1891, he served under Benjamin Disraeli as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1874 to 1875 and as Judge Advocate General from 1875 to 1880. In cricket, he batted for Marylebone Cricket Club in nine games between 1840 and 1846, as well as appearing once for the Cambridge University cricket team and again for a first-class Invitational XI match. Early life Cavendish-Bentinck was born in Westminster, Middlesex, in 1821, the only son of Major-General Lord Frederick Cavendish-Bentinck (1781–1828), fourth son of Prime Minister William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland (1738–1809). His mother was Mary Lowther (d. 1863), a daughter of William Lowther, 1st Earl of Lonsdale (1757–1844), a Tory politician who served as a Member of Parliament for Appleby, Carlisle, Cumberland, and Rutland. He was educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. While at Westminster School, he played for the school's First XI cricket team and faced the MCC for the first time in June 1837, scoring 14 and 13, although his team was defeated by 49 runs, and for a second time in July 1839 when he opened the innings with scores of two and six. Career In 1840, Cavendish-Bentinck was commissioned into the Grenadier Guards, but retired in 1841 after only a year. He joined the MCC to play against Oxford University on 11 June 1840 – his debut first- class match. Oxford, despite playing at home, fell to a heavy defeat as the MCC won by seven wickets. Cavendish-Bentinck made 11. His one appearance for Cambridge came in a match against the MCC, on 1 July 1841. Apart from various appearances for the MCC against school sides, Cavendish-Bentinck would play eight other first-class games for the MCC, scoring fifty-three runs in total, including a best of 29 not out. Add to this one match between two invitational teams – a Slow Bowlers XI featuring Bentinck versus a Fast Bowlers XI – and Cavendish-Bentinck played eleven games in total, scoring 66 runs at a low batting average of 5.50. In 1846, he was called to the Bar from Lincoln's Inn and became an equity draftsman and conveyancer. Political career Cavendish-Bentinck stood unsuccessfully for the borough of Taunton at the general election April 1859, but was elected Member of Parliament (MP) for the borough at a by-election in August that year. He held the seat until the 1865 general election, when he was returned unopposed for Whitehaven.Craig, Election results 1832–1885, page 330 He held that seat until his death, aged 69, in 1891. He served in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade from 1874 to 1875 and as Judge Advocate General from 1875 to 1880. In 1875, he was sworn of the Privy Council. Apart from his legal and political career, Cavendish-Bentinck was a Trustee of the British Museum from 1875 until his death and a Justice of the Peace for Cumberland and Dorset.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 In 1885, he was one of the staunchest adversaries of William Thomas Stead during the Eliza Armstrong case.Raymond L.

The site consists of the original battery and barracks, designed by Colonial Architect James Barnet, located at the end of Suakin Drive, Georges Heights, two later batteries located adjacent to the corner of Middle Head Road and Best Avenue, Georges Heights, and the Beehive (or Lower) Casemate adjacent to the Armoured (or Upper) Casemate in Chowder Bay Road. The Georges Head Battery is one of three forts in the area that were built for the purpose of defending the outer harbour. The other two forts are located at Middle Head and Bradleys Head, Mosman. The fort became a command post in the 1890s for the coordination of all of Sydney's harbour defences. It was decommissioned in 2002 and part of the land is managed by the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust, with other parts managed by the NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service as part of the Sydney Harbour National Park. The property is owned by NSW Officer of Environment and Heritage, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. The site was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  right right right right right Australian Defence activity began in this area of Sydney Harbour as early as 1803 when a gun battery was installed on Georges Head. Built between 1801 and 1803 the then so called \\"Georges Head\\" battery was hewn by hand out of solid rock using a work gang of 44 convicts on what is now known as Obelisk Point near Middle Head. The Georges Head Battery is in fact 1 km to the south west. This is the oldest remaining colonial fortification in Australia and was built to defend the entrance to Sydney Harbour during the Napoleonic wars. The fort was isolated from Sydney town and was abandoned a few years after construction. In July 2010 the NSW Governor, Marie Bashir, officially reopened the site and the historic fort was recognised. On 10 March 1801 Governor Philip Gidley King informed the Secretary of State for Colonies that a battery was \\"in forwardness opposite the entrance to the Harbour, which will completely prevent attack from without\\". Despite that confidence, the job took another two years to finish. With only picks, crowbars, wedges and sledgehammers, a gun pit was cut out of solid sandstone, leaving a curved parapet long on the cliff edge about above sea level. There were two embrasures or gun openings, but guns could also be fired over the parapet. The guns – four twelve-pounders and two six-pounders – were landed at Obelisk Beach (then known as Georges Beach) and hauled up through the bush. Also in the gun pit was built a magazine for powder and shot, with stone walls three feet thick. The \\"Sydney Gazette\\" reported on 23 October 1803 that \\"The new battery is compleated and the artificers and labourers recalled ... the battery mounts six guns, two long twelves [12 pounders] on the right, two of the same size on the left and two short sixes in the centre. The first of these command the bay inwardly, those on the left command the entrance of the harbour between the heads and those in the centre point across the channel.\\" With the French threat in the east removed with the capture of Mauritius in 1810 the battery was abandoned and never used again for military purposes. In 1815 Governor Macquarie established a farm for Aborigines and placed Bungaree in charge. The experiment did not succeed. 1870s Following the removal of the British forces from Australia in 1870, construction began in 1871 on the battery at Georges Head and was completed in 1873. The departure of British forces put the onus on colonies like New South Wales and Victoria to assist in, and organize its own defences, prior to the Federation of Australia. Georges Head Battery was an outer line harbour defence fortification designed especially to attack and prevent enemy ships from infiltrating the inner harbour. The fort held a prominent position and was located high above sea level with strategic views to the entrance of Port Jackson. Other batteries were located on Middle Head, South Head, Shark Point and Bradleys Head, but none were ever used for combative purposes. Georges Head was armed with four 80-pounder rifled muzzle loading guns and two 68-pounder guns. The rifled guns were conversions of the long-obsolete 68-pounder smooth bore guns, and a common weapon in British colonies. It took three months and 250 soldiers to roll the gun barrels all the way from to the batteries. They came along a rough track which later became Military Road. The guns had been positioned so poorly that this created the risk of one gun firing upon another. Also, the guns and soldiers were visible from the harbour. In 1877 large mounds of earth were placed between the pits to make sure the guns could not fire upon each other and to help protect the gun crew from enemy fire. When construction of the fort was complete, there were a total of 41 gun emplacements positioned around the harbour. Defence tactics were planned using telescopes and plotters mounted in the middle of the second gun pit. From the telephone exchange, the Port Jackson District Commandant could communicate with all military installations on the harbour. Telephone cables ran through the tunnels, down the cliff and under the harbour to batteries on the other side. 1880s In 1888 Georges Head was chosen as the best place to observe and fire underwater mines, the latest in harbour defences. Each underwater mine was attached to an electric cable that ran up the cliff to a firing post. From there, miners watched for ships entering the harbour. The miners' job was to explode the mine closest to an approaching enemy ship. Minefields were laid across the main shipping channels of Port Jackson from 1876 to 1922 and a base was built at Chowder Bay for the submarine miners. The work of the submarine miner was secretive, technical and dangerous. During a demonstration in 1891, a crowd of several thousand watched as a terrible accident killed four miners and injured another eight. World War II In 1942, during World War II the Sydney Harbour anti-submarine boom net was installed. The boom net spanned the entire width of Sydney Harbour from Green (Laings) Point, Watsons Bay to Georges Heights in Mosman. The command post remained until the 1930s. The area then became home to various defence bases until 2002 when the Australian Army left after 130 years at Georges Head. The area in which the fortifications are situated is now open to the public and the Sydney Harbour Federation Trust has restored the historic fortifications, creating a new type of lookout. Casualty clearing station and storage facility The hospital was carved out of solid rock during the construction of the tunnel system in 1872, and was originally designed to provide a storage room for the black powder charge used when firing the 68-pounder and 80-pounder guns of the battery. The floor was originally covered in a bituminous substance, the walls were tiled with ceramic tiles not unlike those seen on the wall pictured, and the tunnel ceiling leading to the room was lined with cork. The purpose of these measures was to reduce the possibility of sparks and the potential for a powder explosion. The zigzag tunnel at the far end of the room was designed to act as a blast wall to contain any blast within the immediate area. The room has been modified since 1872 and was used as a casualty clearing station in 1932/33 when the battery was re-gunned with the 6 inch breech loaded MK7 guns. Designed for emergencies only, it fortunately saw no casualties of war.  Heritage listing  Georges Heights and in particular the Officer's mess precinct is culturally significant for the important role it played in the strategic defence of Sydney. This commenced with the initial fortification phase in 1871(−1884) and extended through the submarine mine defence phase (1884–1922), the federation of Australian States and thus it became part of the wider coastal network of defences. The site is part of the network of fortifications that were established to protect Sydney Harbour from attack. Alterations to the A84 Battery show the continual evolution and development of defensive systems and the application of the most modern technology and building techniques. The buildings in the precinct illustrate the evolution of defence accommodation from the 1871 Barracks (later the Officer's Mess) to 1892 Married Quarters (now Gunshot Alley) to the 1954 separate individual rooms (Officers' Mess Accommodation). The buildings have been associated with key people in NSW history particularly; * Colonial architect James Barnet, who was one of Australia's greatest architects and designed the original barracks (now Officers' Mess); and * FR de Wolski, Engineer-in-Chief of Defence Works around 1890 and who contributed to the establishment of Gunshot Alley. The site has remained in government and military ownership from the earliest British settlement and thus provides strong research potential in its structures and surface cultural deposits to demonstrate past ways of military life. The construction of fortifications on the site followed the departure of British Imperial forces in 1870 and is evidence of the British Government's resolve that colonies with responsible government should bear the cost of their own defence. George's Head has outstanding aesthetic values as a prominent headland. The site is valued by the local community and Defence personnel for its role as a vantage point and as a gateway to the harbour. It is also a rare remnant of fragile natural environment, and is also valued for its historical uses. Georges Head Military Fortifications was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999, and in 2004 the Barracks Group, including the Georges Head Battery, was inscribed on the Australian Heritage Database. George's Head was part of the Middle Head and George's Heights defence site listed on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate, and contains three separate independent listings, the A84 Battery, Battery C9A and the 1873 Officers' Mess building.Eric Martin & Associates, 2003 Gallery Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0108.JPG Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0018.JPG Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0139.JPG Image:MiddleGeorgeshedfort0083.JPGFormer officers' residence and barracks, now a restaurant Image:Georges hts fort2.jpg Image:Georges hts fort4.jpgThe tunnel complex within RML 10 inch 18 ton gun Georges Head 1891 AWM P00991.021.jpgRML 10 inch 18 ton gun in 1891 BL 6 inch Mk V gun Georges Head 1892.jpgReplaced by BL 6 inch Mk V guns in 1892 Chowderbay forts Gunroom today.JPGOne of the 3 gun rooms today MiddleGeorgeshedfort0155.JPG Georges hts fort1.jpgA tunnel leading to the former officers residence MiddleGeorgeshedfort0014.JPGA submarine mine observing station behind the gun emplacements Georges hts fort.jpgIn one of the battery's trenches MiddleGeorgeshedfort0024.JPGPart of the fortification tunnel complex from above MiddleGeorgeshedfort0052.JPGThe battery casualty clearing station, once storage facility See also *Bradleys Head Fortification Complex *Middle Head Fortifications * Protected areas of New South Wales * Military history of Australia References  Bibliography    Attribution  External links *www.harbourtrust.gov.au Middle Head history. *Australian Bunker and Military Museum.

History The school opened in 1958. Robert E. Lee and Confederate naming In 1991 the school retired the usage of uniforms for athletes and band members which had Confederate battle flags. The band used to perform a rendition of the song \\"Dixie\\" during athletic competitions but NEISD removed this as well; these moves were done to lessen the stigma against the school. For a period the school continued allowing students to display the Confederate battle flag on their clothing and personal items. The NEISD school board has twice voted on whether to rename the school to address concerns about the safety and focus of students in the context of national debate around memorializing the Confederacy. The board considered whether to rename the school in 2015, after the Charleston church shooting occurred. Lee student Kayla Wilson created an online petition asking for a rename, and students asked the board of trustees of NEISD to consider renaming Lee. Mayor of San Antonio Julián Castro also supported renaming. The vote failed on a 5-2 basis. In August 2017, after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, a San Antonio resident created an online petition to have the school renamed. Another individual created a petition asking for the name to be kept. That month the board voted in favor of retiring the Robert E. Lee name; it did not immediately determine what the new name of the school would be. The board wished to name the school after an idea instead of a person and asked for suggestions. It received 2,400 proposals, and the district rejected 1,900 of them due to not matching the district's parameters and/or due to obscenities. The San Antonio Express-News characterized several of the proposals as having \\"offensive and inappropriate references.\\" In October 2017 the NEISD board agreed to change the name of the school to Legacy of Educational Excellence (L.E.E.) High School on a 5 to 2 vote. The rename took place in fall 2018. Initially the \\"volunteer\\" remained as the school's mascot, but in April 2018 the district announced that the new mascot was a military service dog wearing a military service vest after students voted in favor of that mascot. In addition to the new mascot and name, the statue of Robert E. Lee, along with most other named signs were taken down.

Origin  The family of Samuel Benjamin \\"Ben\\" Skinner operated a dairy farm on a portion of their vast land holdings in northeast Florida beginning in the early 1920s. During the late '50s the growing influence of grocery stores made it more difficult for small, independent dairies to remain financially solvent. The decision was made to build small freestanding \\"milk houses\\" in residential neighborhoods. These stores offered milk and other dairy products and they were ideally suited to replace the declining milk home delivery service. The first store was built in 1958 and the chain peaked in 1985 with 29 stores throughout northeastern Florida (24 in Jacksonville, 3 in Clay County and two in St. Augustine).  Architectural design of stores  Created by the architectural firm of Hardwick & Lee, the Skinner's Milk Houses were present throughout the Jacksonville area. They had a distinct design with a pitched \\"butterfly\\" roof, and each identical store was painted orange, brown, and white, incorporated a drive-through that could be approached from both sides, and used aluminum sliding glass doors which were a novelty at the time. The “wings” were orange, the block walls on the ends were dark brown, the underside of the wings and block side walls incorporating the sliding doors were off-white. The overhanging roof design also provided shelter for drive-through customers during north Florida's frequent rainstorms.  Final years  In 1984 Skinner's Dairy transitioned to next family generation ownership, its third, when it was purchased by H. Denny Gaultney, son-in-law of W. H. Skinner. The new management began constructing new stores in a new design in 1987. Six of the new stores in the second series were built in Duval County from 1986–1988. Three second series stores built in 1987 are in Clay County. From the late 1980s to mid-1990s the company concentrated on the wholesale side of the fluid milk business expanding distribution statewide, and to lower southeastern states and the Caribbean. The dairy was sold to Velda Farms in January 1996. The land that constituted the dairy headquarters and farm was a sizable piece of property located off Bowden Road on the city's south side. The land was redeveloped in 2000 as an office park known as The Silos, a reference to the land's previous appearance and function.  Legacy  As of December 2007, 16 of the original 21 stores still existed in one form or another, housing a variety of businesses. Current tenants include several drive-thru restaurants and sandwich shops, a bakery,https://coastaljax.com/reviews/restaurants/liberty-bakery/ a florist, a dry-cleaner, a coffee shop, golf instruction, and a truck bed liner installation business.

Development history  Royal Page Davidson of the Northwestern Military Academy in Highland Park, Illinois, was doing some experimenting about this time with automobile chassis, modifying them and adding machine guns with armored shielding for protection of the driver. Davidson was the leading pioneer of armored military vehicles in the United States. Davidson designed the military gun carriage vehicleThe Engineering Index By Association of Engineering Societies (U.S.), Engineering Magazine (1901), vol 3 1896/1900, page 53 and ordered it to be built from the Peoria Rubber and Manufacturing Company using patents of Charles Duryea, a well-known automobile manufacturer of the time.Marquis-Who's Who (1967), p. 64 Royal Page Davidson designed the first armored car. Charles Duryea, with his automobile manufacturing company, put it into an automobile- style patent which he filed for on May 16, 1898. It was finally approved as Patent No. 653,224 on July 10, 1900. The military gun carriage gasoline-driven vehicle was built on a Duryea Automobile Company standard production automobile chassis that was converted for military purposes.Clemens, p. 6 The first ones cost $1,500.St. John's, p. 47 Previously, in 1896 or 1897, Davidson made an attempt at a three-wheeled gasoline vehicle for military purposes. His experimentation on this vehicle was at the Northwestern Military Academy in Highland Park, Illinois. He made a demonstration of his vehicle to the Army; however, it soon broke down when it left Chicago to go to New York. The Army interpreted this as too severe a task for such a vehicle and that the technology at the time was not up to such a task. The Army from then on leaned away from gasoline-driven vehicles.The Horseless Age: The Automobile Trade Magazine, published by The Horseless Age Company (1909), page 342 In the gun carriage patent, Duryea says the lighter form motor vehicle is a tricycle capable of seating two people. He further says the object of the invention was \\"to provide a cheap, simple, and effective steering, a compact and durable speed-varying mechanism, a more ready control, an improved brake, a light air- jacketed engine, a cheap and simple balance-gear, and such other minor objects as may appear in the specification\\".Patent No. 653,224 items 10 - 20. Davidson arranged for a Colt .30 caliber automatic machine gun to be mounted on the vehicle intended for military use. The vehicle was the first of a series of military vehicles constructed by Royal Page Davidson for the use by the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy. The first vehicles had three wheels (tricycle) and only a gun shield for protection for the driver, while the later vehicles Davidson designed were fully protected by armor.Hunnicutt, p. 4 Since it was originally of a tricycle configuration, the three pneumatic wheels came with wooden spokes and were 36 inches in diameter. The one wheel in the front was used for steering. Later the partially armored vehicle was made with 4 single-spoked wheels, and a driving wheel was installed. The wheels did not come with mudguards. The vehicle had the capacity of four people to ride on top of the rear engine compartment, one driver and three passengers. The front-seat driver and passenger faced forward, while the other two passengers were back-to-back on the rear seat and facing the opposite direction. The vehicle could go 200 miles on a tank of gas and held tents, blankets, equipment and ration supplies for a week or so.Scientific American, Jan. 27, 1900; p. 59 With the addition of the 4,000-round machine gun mounted on the vehicle, one Northwestern cadet wrote \\"With this gun you could sneak upon an enemy and fire 480 shots a minute and get away before they would know what happened.\\" Davidson made this military armed vehicle in 1899 at the Northwestern Military Academy campus in Highland Park, Illinois. A drawing of the semi-protected military armored vehicle appeared in an 1899 Peoria newspaper. In the \\"Minor Section\\" section of the magazine The Horseless Age they said \\"The Peoria Rubber & Manufacturing Company of Peoria is pushing the motor gun carriage which they are making for Major Davidson in the hope that the Major may reach New York with it in time for the Dewey celebration.\\"The Horseless Age, Vol. 4 No. 25, Sept. 20, 1899 The newspapers of the day reported that the United States was first to use motorized guns. In 1900 the gun carriage vehicle was modified into a sturdier four-wheeler which eventually became the Davidson Automobile Battery armored car, a lightly armored military vehicle. Davidson, inventor of the first military vehicle in the United States,Kane, p. 41 The first armored car was designed by Colonel Royal Page Davidson in May 1898. A Colt automatic machine gun was mounted on the car, which was intended for military use. The automobile was manufactured by the Duryea Automobile Company of Peoria, Illinois, and was used by the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy of Lake Geneva, Wis. received little credit from the army for his efforts of being the first to build armored cars in the United States.Tucker, p. 129 U.S. Army Major Royal P.

Retrieved March 9, 2016 History In the Gothic War Nepi was one of the last strongholds of the Goths. The town was sacked by the Lombards in 569. In the eighth century, however, it became the seat of Tuto, a Lombard dux, known for his interference in the papal election of 768. In the struggle between the emperors and the popes, Nepi was imperialist during the reigns of Pope Alexander II, Pope Nicholas II, Pope Gregory VII, and Pope Innocent II; on the other hand, in 1160, it fought against the commune of Rome, and in 1244, was besieged by Emperor Frederick II. A feudal possession, first of the prefects of Vico, and then of the Orsinis, of the Colonnas, and of C�sar Borgia, from 1537 to 1545, it was erected into a duchy in favour of Peter Louis Farnese; and when the latter was transferred to Parma, Nepi returned to immediate dependence on the Holy See. In 1798 the French set fire to the cathedral and to the episcopal palace, and archives were lost. The Church of Nepi, which venerates, as its evangelizer, St. Ptolemaeus, who, it is claimed, was a disciple of the Apostles. In 419, Eulalius, competitor of Pope Boniface I, was made Bishop of Nepi; Bishop Paulus was sent as visitor to Naples by Gregory the Great; Bishop Stephanus, in 868, was one of the presidents and papal legates of the Council of Constantinople against Photius. Sutri is placed on the Cassian Way. The cathedral is of the thirteenth century, modernized by frequent alterations. Santa Maria della Grotta is an interesting church. The history of Sutri in antiquity resembles that of Nepi, for Sutri also was taken by the Lombards in 569, but was retaken by the exarch Romanus; Liutprand likewise took the town in 726, but in the following year restored it to \\"St. Peter\\". As the city is on the Cassian Way not far from Rome, it was, as a rule, the last halting-place of the German emperors on their way to the city, and sometimes they received there the papal legate. The Synod of Sutri was held there in 1046. This town has an ancient Christian cemetery where the body of St. Romanus was found, who is the patron of the city; the cathedral possesses a statue of him by Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Among the martyrs of Sutri is St. Felix (about 275). The first bishop of known date was Eusebius (465); other bishops were Martinus, or Marinus, who was sent as ambassador to Otho I in 963; Benedictus, who, in 975, became Pope Benedict VII; Bishop Bonitho (Bonizo), historian of the Gregorian epoch, who was driven from his diocese by the anti-papal faction and later was made Bishop of Piacenza. The diocese was united to Nepi under Bishop Luke de Tartarts (1345); under Pomponius Cesi (1519), who became a cardinal, the cemetery of St. Savinilla was discovered; Michael Ghislieri (1556) became Pope Pius V; Joseph Chianti (1701) founded the seminary; Camillus Simeoni (1782) was exiled by the French and became a cardinal.

This authentication is possible if the user owns a valid identity on an HLR (Home Location Register) or on an HSS (Home Subscriber Server). GBA is standardized at the 3GPP (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/33220.htm). The user authentication is instantiated by a shared secret, one in the smartcard, for example a SIM card inside the mobile phone and the other is on the HLR/HSS. GBA authenticates by making a network component challenge the smartcard and verify that the answer is the one predicted by the HLR/HSS. Instead of asking the service provider to trust the BSF and relying on it for every authentication request, the BSF establishes a shared secret between the simcard card and the service provider. This shared secret is limited in time and for a specific domain. Image:Generic Bootstrapping Architecture.jpg Strong points This solution has some strong points of certificate and shared secrets without having some of their weaknesses:  There is no need for user enrollment phase nor secure deployment of keys, making this solution a very low cost one when compared to PKI.  Another advantage is the ease with which the authentication method may be integrated into terminals and service providers, as it is based on HTTP's well known \\"Digest access authentication\\". Every Web server already implement HTTP digest authentication and the effort to implement GBA on top of digest authentication is minimal. For example, it could be implemented on SimpleSAMLPhP http://rnd.feide.no/simplesamlphp with 500 PHP lines of code and only a few tens of lines of code are Service Provider specific making it really easy to port it to another Web site.  On device side is needed: * A Web browser (in fact an HTTP client) implementing digest authentication and the special case designed by a \\"3gpp\\" string in the HTTP header. * A means to dialog with a smartcard and signed the challenge sent by the BSF, either Bluetooth SAP or a Java or native application could be used to serve the request coming from the browser.  Technical overview  Actually, contents in this section are from external literature.Generic Authentication Architecture by Timo Olkkonen, Helsinki University of Technology There are two ways to use GAA (Generic Authentication Architecture). * The first, GBA, is based on a shared secret between the client and server * The second, SSC, is based on public-private key pairs and digital certificates. In the shared secret cases, the customer and the operator are first mutually authenticated through 3G and Authentication Key (AKA) and they agree on session keys which can then be used between the client and services that the customer wants to use. This is called bootstrapping. After that, the services can retrieve the session keys from the operator, and they can be used in some application specific protocol between the client and services. Figure above shows the network GAA entities and interfaces between them. Optional entities are drawn with lines network and borders dotted the scoreboard. The User Equipment (UE) is, for example, the user's mobile phone. The UE and Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) mutually authenticate themselves during the Ub (number [2] above) interface, using the Digest access authentication AKA protocol. The UE also communicates with the Network Application Functions (NAF), which are the implementation servers, over the Ua [4] interface, which can use any specific application protocol necessary. BSF retrieves data from the subscriber from the Home Subscriber Server (HSS) during the Zh [3] interface, which uses the Diameter Base Protocol. If there are several HSS in the network, BSF must first know which one to use. This can be done by either setting up a pre-defined HSS to BSF, or by querying the Subscriber Locator Function (SLF). NAFs recover the key session of BSF during the Zn [5] interface, which also uses the diameter at the base Protocol. If NAF is not in the home network, it must use a Zn-proxy to contact BSF .  Uses  * The SPICE project developed an extended Use Case named \\"split terminal\\" where a user on a PC can authenticate with their mobile phone: http://www.ist-spice.org/demos/demo3.htm. The NAF was developed on SimpleSAMLPhP and a Firefox extension was developed to process the GBA digest authencation request from the BSF. Bluetooth SIM Access Profile was used between the Firefox browser and the mobile phone. Later a partner developed a \\"zero installation\\" concept. * The research institute Fraunhofer FOKUS developed an OpenID extension for Firefox which uses GBA authentication.Presentation at ICIN 2008 by Peter Weik * The Open Mobile Terminal Platform http://www.omtp.org references GBA in its Advanced Trusted Environment: OMTP TR1 recommendation, first released in May 2008. Sadly, despite many advantages and potential uses of GBA, its implementation in handsets has been limited since GBA standardization in 2006. Most notably, GBA was implemented in Symbian-based handsets.

Prelude  Evelyn Baring was the new Governor, who arrived in Kenya on 30 September 1952. After the European invasion, large amounts of Kenya's best land were alienated for exclusive white use. Black Africans were allowed to remain as tenant farmers ('squatters') on land they had previously owned or newly cultivated; their terms of service steadily worsened. At Olenguruoune in 1944, 11,000 squatters were expelled, the beginning of the last act of a land dispute that had raged since the 1920s.The number is Piers Brendon's, see Brendon 2007: 546.See further Kanogo's 1987. The first Mau Mau oaths were probably administered there and then.See Throup 1985:415. Kenyatta returned home from the UK in 1946. By 1947, oathing had spread all over Kikuyuland and into Nairobi.Corfield 1960: 51. Mitchell, the previous Governor, proscribed the new organisation – now called Mau Mau – in 1950. On 9 October 1952, Senior Chief Waruhiu was shot and killed by Mau Mau gunmen. Baring had been on a tour of Central Province. It was cut short.Conveniently, Baring later remembered having been told by the chiefs that, \\"if you don't get Kenyatta and those all around him and shut them up somehow or other we are in a terrible, hopeless, position\\". See Elkins 2005: 33. She is quoting the MS of an interview between Baring and Margery Perham; see Elkins 2005: 381 n. 6 for the full reference. At the funeral, he and Kenyatta locked eyes over the casket; days afterwards, Baring signed the arrest warrants for the Six.Elkins 2005:35 Operation Jock Scott On the night of 20/21 October, a mass arrest was carried out of Mau Mau and KAU leaders. There is some doubt about the actual number of arrests.See page 74 of Emergency In Kenya: Kikuyu And The Mau Mau Insurrection :\\"Sources vary as to the number of arrests actually made that night, though Governor Baring had signed 183 arrest and detention warrants. By dawn somewhere between 83 and 112 arrests had been made quietly and without resistance.\\" Baring had signed the Emergency order on the evening of the 20th,Elkins 2005: 36 the emergency was publicly proclaimed on the morning of the 21st. Troops from the Lancashire Fusiliers, flown in on the 20th, were in place later that day, patrolling the African areas of segregated Nairobi. The trial Anthony Somerhough, the Deputy Public Prosecutor, opened proceedings on 3 December 1952. The charge against the defendants was that they had jointly managed a proscribed society (and that the proscribed society, the Mau Mau, had conspired to murder all white residents of Kenya). The defence was led by Denis Nowell Pritt,Pritt had sat as Labour MP and later, after his explulsion from the Labour Party for Soviet sympathies, as an independent Left MP; he was thought by George Orwell to be 'perhaps the most effective pro-Soviet publicist in this country' (Morgan 2004). Neither of these facts made him popular with white Kenyans. assisted by a multiracial team: HO Davies, a Nigerian; Chaman Lall, an Indian and friend of Nehru;See Elkins 2005:40 and the Kenyans Fitz De Souza, Achhroo Ram Kapila, and Jaswant Singh. In line with the segregationist legislation then in force, they were prohibited from staying in the same hotel.See Elkins 2005:40-1. Baring offered Ransley Thacker, the presiding judge, an unusually large pension, and that from the Emergency fund rather than a more conventional source; the two also maintained secret contact during the trial.See Elkins 2005: 40, and Anderson 2005: 65 Witnesses were suborned, as Baring admitted in a letter to Lyttelton, saying that \\"every possible effort has been made to offer them rewards\\".See Elkins 2005: 40 Rawson Macharia, the key witness at the trial, was later to testify that he had been offered a university course in public administration at Exeter University College, protection for his family, and a government job on his return from the UK.See Lonsdale 2000: 235 Other witnesses were offered land at the Coast.See Lonsdale 2000: 235–6 The crucial piece of evidence was Macharia's.See Kaggia, 2012: 102 He testified that in March 1950, he had taken one of the Mau Mau oaths at Kenyatta's hands. He further claimed that the oath had required him to strip naked and drink human blood. Macharia's submissions were the only evidence of a direct link between Kenyatta and Mau Mau produced before the court.However, Mau Mau was proscribed in August 1950, so, even had the claims been true, it is unclear that they would have proved Kenyatta's membership, let alone management, of a proscribed organisation.The defendants were all convicted, and sentenced to long terms and permanent restriction. All defendants got seven years each. The remainder of the nationalist movement – in which Mboya and Odinga featured prominently – kept up the pressure for Uhuru and the release of the detainees: KANU's election slogan in the 1961 election was Uhuru na Kenyatta (Independence with Kenyatta). KANU won the election and then refused to form a government unless Kenyatta was released. Despite Renison's famous dismissal of Kenyatta as the leader \\"unto darkness and death\\", it was clear that he was indispensable; he was duly released in 1961. The rest of the Six were released soon thereafter. Kenyatta went on to the presidency of Kenya; Kaggia and Ngei served as ministers; Oneko was detained by Kenyatta between 1969 and 1974, before later serving as MP for Rarieda in Kenya's 7th Parliament; Kung'u Karumba disappeared in 1975, while in Uganda on business; Fred Kubai twice served as MP for Nakuru East – from 1963 to 1974, and from 1983 to 1988 – before his death in June 1996.

Banshee was sold off in 1912. Construction and design HMS Banshee was one of three \\"twenty-seven knotter\\" torpedo boat destroyers ordered from Laird, Son and Co on 7 February 1894 as part of the Royal Navy's 1893–1894 construction programme. The Admiralty laid down broad requirements for the destroyers, including a speed of on sea trials, a \\"turtleback\\" forecastle and armament, which was to vary depending on whether the ship was to be used in the torpedo boat or gunboat role. As a torpedo boat, the planned armament was a single QF 12 pounder 12 cwt ( calibre) gun on a platform on the ship's conning tower (in practice the platform was also used as the ship's bridge), together with a secondary gun armament of three 6-pounder guns, and two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes. As a gunboat, one of the torpedo tubes could be removed to accommodate a further two six-pounders. Detailed design was left to the builders (although all designs were approved by the Admiralty), resulting in each of the builders producing different designs rather the ships being built to a standard design. Banshee was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was light and full load. The ship was powered by two triple expansion steam engines rated at , fed from four Normand boilers, with the boilers' outtakes ducted together to four funnels. She had a crew of 50 officers and men. Banshee was laid down at Laird's Birkenhead shipyard on 1 March 1894 as Yard number 598 and was launched on 17 November 1894. Sea trials were successful, with Banshee reaching speeds of over the measured mile and an average speed of during the three-hour continuous steaming trial. She was completed in July 1895. Service history In July 1896, Banshee took part in the Royal Navy's annual fleet exercises. Later that year, she was joined the Mediterranean Fleet, where she remained for most of the rest of her service. Lieutenant Alan Cameron Bruce was appointed in command in the Spring of 1902. She visited Lemnos in August 1902, and Argostoli in early October. Lieutenant James Uchtred Farie was appointed in command later that year.

History The town, then called Monsvici or Monteregale, was a part of the diocese of Asti until 1198, when it established itself as a commune.Grassi, I, p. v-vi. The commune had a podestà.Grassi, II, p. 45, a treaty between the commune of Mons Regalis and the Marchesi di Ceva, 7 August 1250.. The diocese of Mondovi was established during the Great Schism by Pope Urban VI of the Roman Obedience, in the papal Bull, Salvator Noster of 8 June 1388.Grassi, II, pp. 162-164. On 26 June 1388, he established Mondovi as a civitas.Grassi, II, pp. 165-166. The city of Mondovì provided the bishop with an episcopal palace, next to the church of S. Antonio.Grassi, II, p. 365. The first bishop of Mondovì was the Dominican Damiano Zavaglia; among his successors were Percivallo di Palma (1429), Amadeo Romagnano (1497), who reconstructed the cathedral (1550); Michele Ghislieri, O.P. (1550), Grand InquisitorHis title in Latin was contra hereticam pravitatem in tota republica christiana Summus Inquisitor a S. Sede Apostolica specialiter deputatus. He held the post in Rome and administered his diocese through a Vicar, Bishop Gerolamo Ferragata. Grassi, II, p. 394. and later Pope Pius V; Cardinal Vincenzo Lauro (1566), founder of the seminary, during whose incumbency the cathedral and other churches were torn down to make room for the citadel; Giovanni Battista Isnardi (1697), who restored the episcopal palace and the church of St. Dalmazaio; Carlo Felice Sanmartino (1741), founder of the new seminary, and Giovanni Tommaso Ghilardi, O.P. (1842). The city, at first part of the Diocese of Asti, became the seat of a bishop, suffragan of the Archbishop of Milan, but, since 1515, the Archdiocese of Turin has been its metropolitan.Bull of Pope Leo X, Hodie ex certis, 21 May 1515. Grassi, II, p. 358. In 1817, the territory of Cuneo was detached from the See of Mondovì, making the diocese of Cuneo. Cathedral and Chapter The Cathedral of Mondovi is dedicated to S. Donato. In the bull in which he created the diocese, Pope Urban VI says that he promotes the Collegiate Church of S. Donato into a cathedral church.\\"Cronaca de' vescovi di Monteregali\\", in the Libro Grosso del Capitolo, in: Grassi, II, p. 162: et insuper Collegiatam ecclesiam S. Donati in huiusmodi nova civitate sitam in cathedralem ecclesiam similiter erigimus et constituimus.... The cathedral was served by a Chapter, which, as Pope Urban says, is to have the same dignities with the same names as that of Asti, and ten canons with the same titles as those of the Chapter of Asti. The Chapter of Mondovì was made up of four dignities (the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Provost, and the Cantor) and eight Canons. There were also sixteen Chaplains.Ritzler-Sefrin, V, p. 275 note 1. Ughelli, IV, p. 1085, states that there were ten Canons. Cf. Grassi, I, pp. 9-10, who says that as late as 1404 there was no Chapter as such; there was an Archpriest and probably several Canons. The Pope, unfortunately, makes no mention of how the dignities and Canons are to be appointed or by whom. It is known that the first two bishops installed no Canons.Grassi, II, p. 365: tamen idem episcopus, sequendo errorem primi, nullos instituit Canonicos, et sic eis non remisit molendina.... Statutes of the Cathedral Chapter of Mondovì were approved by the Chapter on 23 September 1480, and ratified by the Archdeacon of Turin, Guillermo Caccia, JUD and Protonotary Apostolic, the Apostolic Delegate.Grassi, II, pp. 283-306. In 1577, Duke Emanuele Filiberto, faced with the need to fortify the city of Mondovì, announced that he needed the hilltop on which the Cathedral church of S. Donato had existed for many centuries. His plans also required the demolition of the churches of San Domenico (which belonged to the Dominican friars) and Sant'Antonio (which belonged to the Jesuits. After consultations with the Papal Nuncio in Turin, Gerolamo de'Federici, and all the parties concerned in Mondovì (the Bishop, Vincenzo Lauro, the Cathedral Chapter, and all of the religious orders), the plan was submitted to Pope Gregory XIII to transfer the seat of the bishop from S. Donato to the Franciscan church of San Francesco, and to move the Franciscans to Sant'Andrea. The Dominicans would be assigned the parish church of Carassone which had the title of San Giovanni di Lupazano. The Jesuits would be moved to the palazzo of Francesco da Ponte. On 15 March 1577 the Pope gave his consent, and the church of San Francesco became the Cathedral of Mondovì, under the title of S. Donato. The Franciscans were authorized to build a new church of San Francesco.Cappelletti, pp. 233-243. Bishop Lauro succeeded Bishop Gerolamo de'Federici as Papal Nuncio in Turin, and was made a cardinal by Gregory XIII in 1583.Eubel, III, p. 47 no. 25. In 1835, the Chapter was made up of six dignities and fourteen Canons. The dignities were: Archdeacon, Archpriest, Provost, Cantor, Penitentiary and Theologus.Calendario generale pe' Regii Stati, publicato con authorita del Governore e S. S. R. M. (Torino 1835), p. 65. The Canon Penitentiarius and the Canon Theologus were added by Bishop Vincenzo Lauro in 1580 and 1584.Cappelletti, XIV, p. 243. The cathedral contains paintings by Giulio Romano, Cambiaso, and others. The residence of the bishop is one of the most impressive episcopal palaces in Italy. In the church of la Missione there are frescoes by the Jesuit Pozzi. Outside the city is the sanctuary of the Madonna del Pilone, dating from the fourteenth century, but finished later (1730–49). The palace of the counts of San Quintino contained the first printing-office in Piedmont, and was the seat of a university (1560–1719) founded by Duke Emmanuel Philibert, the first institution of its kind in Piedmont.Grassi, II, pp. 392-393 (6 December 1560). A studium had been founded in Turin in 1404, but it had been closed in 1536. Diocesan synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

Both of these musicians have a career that has seen them record and release nearly 20 albums between them. According to Jason De Ron, the name Altera Enigma was chosen because it represents something mysterious and unique. (in German) Kenny Cheong, a jazz fusion bassist, joined the project in 2005, and Altera Enigma's first album was released in 2006. Jayson Sherlock, a former band-mate of De Ron in Paramecium and also a former member of the band Mortification and the sole member of Horde, joined on drums in 2007. In 2009, Jeff Arwadi, having relocated from Indonesia to Canada in 2007, decided to step down from the project. Biography Altera Enigma was formed as an outlet for Jason and Jeff to work together on music that would push their boundaries and challenge them musically. While both Jason and Jeff are more well known for playing metal music, both musicians claim a heavy influence from jazz and progressive music in all its forms. In an interview with NekroBlog, Jason said that, generally, metal has very limited emotional range, and that Altera Enigma is an attempt to break that mold. Kenny Cheong, a jazz fusion bassist who plays a five string fretless, joined the band in 2005 and allowed Altera Enigma to further develop their signature sound. The band released its first album, Alteration, in 2006. 2007 saw the addition of drummer Jayson Sherlock, formerly of Mortification, Paramaecium, and Horde. The band is in the process of creating a new album, but progress on the record has been slow due to various events in the band members lives. As of March, 2010, Jeff, who now resides in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, decided that he needed to step away from Altera Enigma, and his contribution to the project is now minimal, although according to Jason DeRon the band will continue to take advantage of his creativity and inventiveness. As of May 2011, the band have announced that work on their second album is almost complete, with bass, keys, guitars done, and only drums left to record.

While most of the 27-knotters mounted their full armament of 1 × 12 pounder (76 mm) gun, 5 × 6-pounder guns and two 18-in torpedo tubes, Swordfish, owing to concerns about stability, tended to only carry a single torpedo tube.Lyon 2001, pp. 99–100.

Her maternal grandparents were Romanos I Lekapenos and Theodora. The work Theophanes Continuatus was a continuation of the chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor by other writers, active during the reign of her father. The chronicle ends in 961 and records her fate following the death of Constantine VII on 9 November 959. Her brother Romanos II succeeded to the throne and his wife Theophano convinced him to send all five of his sisters to the convent of Kanikleion. Theodora and her sisters Zoe, Agatha, Theophano and Anna were initially held in Kanikleion. Later they were split with Theodora, Zoe and Theophano sent to the monastery of Antiochus while Agatha and Anna were sent to Myrelaion, a nunnery built by their maternal grandfather. While the sisters were following their monastic lives, changes were occurring in the imperial throne. Romanos II died on 15 March 963. His co-rulers and successors were his underage sons Basil II and Constantine VIII. Their mother served as their regent until marrying victorious general Nikephoros II. Nikephoros rose to the throne as senior emperor. However Theophano and John Tzimiskes, Nikephoros' nephew, organized his assassination on the night of 10–11 December 969. John became senior Emperor in place of Nikephoros. Theophano was exiled to the island of Pringipos. His previous marriage to Maria Skeleraina had solidified an alliance with general Bardas Skleros, but the loyalties of the rest of the Byzantine Empire were not as secure. John rectified the situation by releasing Theodora from Myrelaion and arranging their marriage. According to Leo the Deacon, the marriage occurred in November 971. The Cambridge Medieval History.

The diocese of Sovana had originally been directly dependent upon the Holy See, and its bishops attended the pope's synods. When Pope Pius II, who was a Piccolomini of Siena, created the metropolitan archdiocese of Siena, he made Sovana one of its suffragan dioceses.Ughelli III, p. 734. The bishops of Sovana usually resided in the former palace of the Orsini in Pitigliano, which was given to Bishop Francesco Pio Santi (1776–1789) by the Grand Duke of Tuscany. The bishop has his seat in the Cattedrale di Ss. Pietro e Paolo, dedicated to Saints Peter and Paul, in Pitigliano, a part of the province of Grosseto; the municipality of Sovana (Soana) in Toscana also has a Co-Cathedral named in honor of saint Peter. Orbetello has the Concattedrale di S. Maria Assunta (S. Biagio), dedicated to the Assumption and St. Biagio.  History  The two towns, Sovana and Pitigliano, are situated in the Province of Grosseto, Central Italy. The Diocese of Sovana, was in existence by 680, and was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Siena. Sovana was an ancient Etruscan city, and preserved a certain importance till the end of the thirteenth century, having been the capital of the counts of Aldobrandeschi, lords of Southern Tuscany, from the days of Charlemagne. In 1230 the diocese lost territory which had been given as a gift to Territorial Abbacy of Santi Vincenzo ed Anastasio alle tre Fontane in Rome. In 1240 the city withstood a siege by Emperor Frederick II. Later it passed under the sway of the Orsini family, who transferred their residence to Pitigliano, mentioned for the first time in 1081. In 1401 the city fell into the power of the Republic of Siena. In 1434 Count Gentile Orsini having been killed at Sovana, the people of Pitigliano put the town to fire and sword, and brought about its destruction. On 22 April 1459, Pope Pius II issued the bull \\"Triumphans Pastor\\", in which he raised the diocese of Siena to metropolitan status, and assigned to it as suffragans the dioceses of Sovana, Chiusi, Massa, and Grosseto.: \\"Necnon filias nostras praedictas Suanensem, Clusinensem et Grossetanensem et Massanensem Ecclesias, cum suis civitatibus et dioecesibus, iuribus el pertinentiis universis, Ecclesiae Seuensi et arcbiepiscopis praefatis, tamquam illorum metropolitanis et de eorum provincia....\\" The territory of this diocese includes the Vallombrosan Abbey of Monte Calvello, which was transferred in 1496 by Pope Alexander VI a new abbey within the city walls. The diocesan seminary was founded by Bishop Domenico Maria della Ciaja, O.P. (1688–1713). On 11 January 1844,Fabriziani, p. 84, gives the date of 13 January 1843, as do: Bruscalupi (1906), Monografia storica, p. 420, and . Gaetano Moroni, Dizionario di erudizione storico- ecclesiastica Vol. 53 (Venice 1851), p. 295, column 2, gives the date of 11 January 1844, which appears to be the correct date: Pope Gregory XVI created the diocese of Pitigliano, and assigned it aeque principaliter to the bishop of Sovana. The diocese was renamed as Diocese of Sovana–Pitigliano (Soanensis–Pitilianensis in Latin), and the former collegiate church of Saints Peter and Paul in Pitigliano became the new cathedral.Cappelletti XVII, p. 752. Bruscalupi, Monografia storica della contea di Pitigliano, p. 420. The Second Vatican Council, in order to ensure that all Catholics received proper spiritual attention, decreed the reorganization of the diocesan structure of Italy and the consolidation of small and struggling dioceses. It also recommended the abolition of anomalous units such as exempt territorial prelatures.In its decree Christus Dominus, section 22, it stated: \\"Concerning diocesan boundaries, therefore, this sacred synod decrees that, to the extent required by the good of souls, a fitting revision of diocesan boundaries be undertaken prudently and as soon as possible. This can be done by dividing dismembering or uniting them, or by changing their boundaries, or by determining a better place for the episcopal see or, finally, especially in the case of dioceses having larger cities, by providing them with a new internal organization.... At the same time the natural population units of people, together with the civil jurisdictions and social institutions that compose their organic structure, should be preserved as far as possible as units. For this reason, obviously, the territory of each diocese should be continuous.\\" The territorial Abbey of Saints Vincent and Anastasius in suburban Rome was one of them, having been suppressed in 1812, then handed over to the Friars Minor in 1825, though malaria drove them out; in 1867, the Cistercians took over the abbey with a contingent of Trappist friars. The widely dispersed properties which belonged to the abbey and the Catholics living on them had come to be neglected. After extensive consultation, therefore, Pope John Paul II issued the apostolic constitution Abbatia SS. Vincentii on 25 March 1981, which reassigned various territories of the abbey to the dioceses in which they were situated. Properties in Tuscany at Orbetello, Monte Argentarii, Isola Igilii, and Capalbi, along with the parishes established in them, as well as oratories, chapels, cemeteries, and all other ecclesiastical goods, were assigned to the diocese of Sovana- Pitigliano. The diocese's name was changed to Diocese of Sovana–Pitigliano–Orbetello.Acta Apostolicae Sedis vol. LXXIII (1981) pp. 474-476. On 30 September 1986, the diocese was renamed Diocese of Pitigliano–Sovana–Orbetello (Pitilianensis–Soanensis–Urbetelliensis in Latin), taking into account regulations that favored the larger and more important city.Acta Apostolicae Sedis vol. LXXIX (Città del Vaticano 1987), pp. 451-452. Chapter and cathedral The cathedral of Pitigliano began as a simple parish church, dedicated to S. Mark the Evangelist. In 1509, Pope Julius II raised the parish church to the dignity of a collegiate church, dedicated to Ss. Peter and Paul.Bruscalupi, Monographia storica della contea di Pitigliano, p. 17. It was administered by a Chapter, composed of an Archpriest and eight Canons. In 1669, the Chapter of the cathedral of S. Pietro in Sovana had one dignity and three Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin V, p. 364, note 1. The population was 150 persons. Ughelli (1725) notes that there were two dignities (the Provost and the Dean) and three Canons. There were two parishes in the city of some 400 persons, one of which was the cathedral, whose Provost had the care of the souls of the parishioners.Ughelli, Italia sacra III, p. 733-734. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. John Paul II, Constitutio Apostolica de Synodis Dioecesanis Agendis (March 19, 1997): Acta Apostolicae Sedis 89 (1997), pp. 706-727. The first synod held in the diocese of Sovana following the decrees of the Council of Trent on the regular holding of synods took place on 2 May 1601, under the direction of Bishop Metello Bichi (1596–1606).Diocesi di Pitigliano Sovana Orbetello, Ippolito Corridori, \\"I sinodi nella storia della diocesi,\\"; retrieved: 1 January 2020.

Most commercial aircraft have one passenger deck and one cargo deck for luggage and ULD containers, but only a few have two decks for passengers, typically above or below a third deck for cargo.  History  Breguet Deux-Ponts, the first full double-deck aircraft Many early flying boat airliners, such as the Boeing 314 Clipper and Short Sandringham, had two decks. Following World War II the Stratocruiser, a partially double-decked derivative of the B-29 Superfortress, became popular with airlines around the world. The first full double-deck aircraft was the French Breguet Deux-Ponts, in service from 1953. The first partial double-deck jet airliner was the widebody Boeing 747, in service from 1970, with the top deck smaller than the main deck. Boeing originally designed the distinctive 747 bubble top with air cargo usage in mind. The small top deck permitted the cockpit and a few passengers and nose doors with unobstructed access to the full length of the hold. Most 747s are passenger jets, and a small percentage are cargo jets with nose doors. The first full double-deck jet airliner is the Airbus A380, which has two passenger decks extending the full length of the fuselage, as well as a full-length lower third deck for cargo.

Plot Matt Riddlehoover wrote, directed, edited and stars in this seriocomic feature about a gay playwright who feeds off his stubborn attraction to the wrong type of guy (played in multiple roles by Jonas Brandon). When he attracts the attention of a newspaper columnist (Lindsey Hancock) who will champion his work, success seems guaranteed until he meets her boyfriend - played by Brandon.

The term may also refer to a brand name of Ioflupane (123I) which is used for the study. The scan principle is based on use of the radiopharmaceutical Ioflupane (123I) which binds to dopamine transporters (DaT). The signal from them is then detected by the use of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) which uses special gamma-cameras to create a pictographic representation of the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain. DaTSCAN is indicated in cases of tremor in patients, when we are not sure about its origin. Although this method can distinguish essential tremor from Parkinson's syndrome, it is unable to show us if the problem is Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy. Its main advantage is that DaTSCAN is able to diagnose Parkinson´s disease much earlier – in stage of 30% loss of the dopamine brain cells instead of 80-90% , when the symptoms are already so visible, that we can be sure about the diagnosis. The earlier diagnosis, the earlier treatment with better results. Striatum Dopamine Pathways Dopamine D2 receptors Gamma-camera  Procedure  At the beginning a patient should take two iondine tablets and wait for one hour. These pills are highly important, because they prevent the accumulation of radioactive substances in thyroid gland! After one hour, the patient gets an injection to shoulder, which contain the radiopharmaceutical and then he has to wait for 4 hours. The concentration of the substance increases and then it is scanned by gamma- camera, which is located around his head. Whole examination lasts about 30-45 minutes and it is non-invasive. If a patient use some of the medication listed below, it is necessary to stop the using few days or weeks before the DaTSCAN, but just after a consultation with his doctor. The examination takes just a few hours, so patients needen´t to stay in a hospital overnight, but they have to drink much more than they are used to and go to the toilet more often. It is important for a fast elimination of the radioactive substances from the body.

The song was co- authored by Mick's brother David Jackson and Elmar Krohn, and produced by Sylvester Levay. Jackson recorded his version first and The Jacksons' management team picked up the song at Midem, the music industry trade fair in Cannes, where it was offered to them by Mick Jackson's publisher without Jackson's knowledge. Due to a delay at the pressing plant which was producing Mick Jackson's single, in the UK the two versions were released within weeks of each other. The press at the time enjoyed the similarity in the names and release coincidence, calling the situation 'The Battle of the Boogie' as the two records jockeyed for chart positions. Radio stations got on the battle bandwagon. BBC Radio One only played The Jacksons' version, Capital Radio only played Mick's single. The music press was equally split. Melody Maker did not review Mick Jackson's version, but praised the Jacksons and wrongly referred to their single as a \\"self-penned song\\" (16 September 1978), whereas NME hailed Mick Jackson as the winner of the battle, calling his version \\"far superior\\" (7 October 1978). Mick Jackson's original peaked at No. 15 and The Jacksons peaked at No. 8 in the UK Singles Chart. Mick Jackson's subsequent 1979 release, \\"Weekend\\" was released in the same week as The Jacksons' second single \\"Destiny\\". The songs entered the charts on the same day, peaking at 38 and 39 in the UK Singles Chart respectively, and both 'Michael Jacksons' appearing on the same edition of Top of The Pops. \\"Weekend\\" spent eight weeks on the chart; thus equalling his earlier single's tenure, and also avoiding the one-hit wonder tag. Jackson released three albums – Weekend (1978 – Atlantic Records), Step Inside My Rainbow (1980 – CBS Records) and \\"Square Deal\\" (1982). He has worked with many artists such as David Knopfler, Eric Burdon, Lisa Stansfield and Barry Manilow. In 2010, filmmaker Patrick Nation made a Channel 4 documentary about Jackson, entitled The Other Michael Jackson: Battle of the Boogie.

This includes both dry and sweet wines as well as fortified \\"sherry-like\\" wines aged in a solera.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 1130-1131 Allen Lane 2012 The grape has a long history on the island of Sardinia with Sardinians claiming that consuming ample quantities of wine produced from the grape as being responsible for low instances of malaria on the island.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 215 Firefly Books 2004 Despite the similarities in their names and synonyms, Vernaccia di Oristano is a distinct variety that is not related to the Tuscan wine grape Vernaccia used to make Vernaccia di San Gimignano. The grape also does not appear to be related to the red wine grapes Aleatico or Grenache which are known as Vernaccia in different parts of Italy. History and name According to legend, the ancient Phoenicians introduced Vernaccia di Oristano to the island of Sardinia sometime after they founded the port of Tharros on the west coast of the island (ruins pictured). According to legend, Vernaccia was introduced to the island of Sardinia by the Phoenicians sometime after the ancient Semitic civilization founded the port of Tharros in 800 BC. The first documented mentioning of Vernaccia di Oristano was from a legal document drafted in 1327 in the town of Iglesias in southwest Sardinian that specified that winemakers were limited to producing one barrel each of wine made from several different grape varieties, including Vernaccia, Greco, Brusco bianco and Vermiglio, but that each wine was to be kept separate. There are several theories behind the origins of the name Vernaccia that is shared by Vernaccia di Oristano and several other Italian varieties. The most common theory is that name is derived from the Latin word vernaculus (also the root of the word \\"vernacular\\") which means \\"native\\" or \\"indigenous\\" and would be attached to any grape perceived to be native to the local region. In the case of Vernaccia di Oristano, ampelographers believe that the grape may be native to the Tirso river valley that crosses the island of Sardinia before emptying into the Gulf of Oristano. The province of Oristano where Vernaccia di Oristano may have originated. Also shown on the map is the location of the ruins of the Phoenician settlement of Tharros on the coast of the Gulf of Oristano. Other theories postulate that the name could be derived from other Latin words such as verrum, meaning boar, based on the beasts that are common in central Italy and known to trespass into vineyard and eat the grapes on the vine. The Latin word for winter, ibernum, is another possibility since many of the Vernaccia species were used as table grapes for eating during the winter months. One other contending theory is that the village of Vernazza in the Cinque Terre region of Liguria on the northwest coast of Italy could be a potential origin and eponym for some of the Vernaccia grapes. However, in the case of Vernaccia di Oristano there is no direct evidence linking the grape to the Ligurian wine region. Viticulture Vernaccia di Oristano is a mid to late ripening grape variety that can be very sensitive to the dangers from late spring frost during the growing season. It is also susceptible to the viticultural hazards of infection from downy and powdery mildew. Relationship to other grapes While Grenache (pictured) is known under the synonym of Vernaccia nera in some parts of Italy, it doesn't appear to have any close genetic relationship with Vernaccia di Oristano. Despite similarities in names and synonyms, DNA analysis has shown that Vernaccia di Oristano is a distinct variety that is not closely related to the several other grapes that share the name Vernaccia. This includes the Tuscan wine grape Vernaccia used to make the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine of Vernaccia di San Gimignano as well as the red wine grapes Aleatico which is known as Vernacia di Pergola in southern Italy and Grenache which is known under the synonym of Vernaccia nera in the Marche region and Umbria. DNA has showed a possible close genetic relationship of parent-offspring between Vernaccia di Oristano and the white Emilia-Romagna wine grape Santa Maria used to make Vin Santo style wines in the province of Piacenza. Wine regions In 2000, there were of Vernaccia di Oristano planted in Italy, almost exclusively in the province of Oristano in the lower Tirso river valley on the west coast of the island. Here it is the exclusive grape behind the DOC wine of the same name which is made in both dry and sweet styles as well as fortified liquoroso wines. According to DOC requirements, Vernaccia di Oristano grapes are limited to a maximum harvest yield of 8 tonnes/hectare (≈ 0.53 tons/acres). The wine is then aged in barrels (often made of chestnut instead of oak) for at least two years for fortified styles. The aging requirement is increased to 29 months for secco (dry and unfortified) styles and 53 months for Superiore Riserva (also dry and unfortified) wines. For unfortified styles, the finished wines must attain a minimum alcohol level of at least 15% to attain DOC designation while the fortified liquoroso styles (both dry and sweet) must contain at least 18% alcohol by volume. Styles Like Sherry and other sherry-style wines such as the French wine Vin jaune (pictured), Vernaccia di Oristano is often stored in barrels that are only partially filled, leaving a large amount of head space where oxygen can come into contact with the wine. Similar to Fino Sherry and Vin Jaune, there is a formation of the layer of yeast known as Flor (pictured here) to protect the wine from oxygen. Like Sherry, Vernaccia di Oristano wines are often made utilizing a solera system of \\"fractional blending\\" where new wine is added to barrels at the \\"top\\" of the solera and then gradually blended into barrels of wine from other vintages as it works it way down through the solera and eventually being bottled. This means that within a single bottle of Vernaccia di Oristano could be blends of wines from several decades of vintages with one Sardinian producer having a solera that contains wine from over a 100 different vintages. Also like some styles of Sherry, Vernaccia di Oristano is intentionally aged in oxidative conditions being stored in barrels that are only partially filled--leaving substantial ullage or head space for oxygen to come into contact with the wine. This can add some complexity to the wine and the presence of nutty, sherry-like aromas and a deep golden color, particularly for the sweeter dolce styles. Synonyms Over the years, Vernaccia di Oristano has been known under a variety of synonyms including: Aregu biancu, Aregu Seulu, Cagnaccia, Carnaggia, Cranaccia, Garnaccia, Granazza, Moranina, Varnaccia, Vernaccia, Vernaccia Austera, Vernaccia bianca, Vernaccia Orosei, Vernaccia S. Rosalia, Vernaccia San Rosalia, Vernaccia di S.

Biography Our knowledge of Ghetti's career rests chiefly on a brief notice by Vasari, a few mentions in documents, and half a dozen jewel-like, painstakingly finished paintings. Vasari briefly mentions Ghetti, whom he calls \\"Baccio Gotti\\" in the Lives, describing him as a pupil of Ghirlandaio and stating that he worked in France at the court of King Francois I. Until 2003, no works by Ghetti were known; on that year documents were published by Louis Alexander Waldman showing the artist had painted and restored a number of works for the church of San Pietro a Selva, near Malmantile, a neighborhood of Lastra a Signa in the lower Arno valley. The only sixteenth-century painting in the church is a frescoed lunette depicting the Madonna and Child. Waldman (2003) identified this painting as a work of a follower of Ridolfo Ghirlandaio, called the Master of the Copenhagen Charity (the name came from his most beautiful work, an allegory of Charity now in the Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen). The conjunction of the painting and the document led to the identification of the Master of the Copenhagen Charity as Bartolomeo Ghetti. Career in France and Florence As noted by Waldman (2003) Ghetti can almost certainly be identified with the painter and illuminator “Barthélemy Guéty” who is named in a number of payment records surviving from the court of François I. From these we learn that Ghetti had already worked for François at some time before his accession in 1515, and that the painter received payments and salary as court painter and valet de chambre in 1519 and between 1521 and 1532. The payments records reveal that, together with Matteo dal Nassaro, Ghetti designed the rich set of hangings, with subjects drawn from Virgil's Bucolics, that were produced to decorate a so-called Chambre verte in 1521. Further payments from the French king survive from 1528 and 1529. He was still producing pictures and also illuminating manuscripts for the king in 1532, when François paid him 300 écus for two designs of figures from histories and poetry, satyrs and nymphs, that the king wished to decorate the Hall of jeu de paulme of the Louvre“pour deux patrons, par lui fais où sont figurés et painctz plusiers histoires de poésie, satires et nimphes, que le Roy a fait demourer en la salle du jeu de paulme du Louvre” (possibly cartoons for tapestries) and for two Books of Hours. Ghetti received a donative from the king in April 1532, recorded in a document that indicates that François was hoping by this means to keep him his court: “par forme de pention et bienfaict, et pour s’entretenir à son service.” Ghetti must have traveled between Florence and France a number of times over the course of his career, as indicated by the document that record his presence in both locations. Though, as we have seen, he worked for François I before 1515, “Bartholomeus Zenobii Ghetti” was present at a meeting of the Florentine Compagnia di San Jacopo, called “La Sgalla” on 1 January 1516 (modern style). He may have worked in France for a considerable period during the years between 1516 and 1524, during which time there is no documentation for his presence in Italy. In 1525, though, Ghetti was again in Florence, where he made payments to the Compagnia di San Luca and was recorded in the books of yet another Florentine confraternity, the Compagnia di San Sebastiano. In the same year the Compagnia di San Giovanni of Fucecchio decided to commission an altarpiece for their oratory, which Ghetti would subsequently execute (his sole surviving large-scale work). In 1527we find the artist engaged in a dispute with the rector of San Pietro a Selva (near Malmantile) over some work he had recently done for that church. He appointed a procurator in Florence in May 1528, undoubtedly with a view to returning to France; as noted, his presence at the court of François I is documented later in the same year and into 1529. It would appear that the painter returned definitively to Florence some time between his receipt of the 1532 donative from the French king (which in the end failed to achieve its aim) and 7 December 1533, when, as a new document reveals, he appears on the membership rolls of the Florentine confraternity, the Compagnia dello Scalzo. Antonio Mini's letter mentioning Ghetti, quoted earlier, may have been occasioned by the painter's definitive return to Florence, where a succession of documents confirm his presence in Florence between 1535 and his death (which occurred around June 1536). Work as Manuscript Illuminator in France In 1894 Durrieu and Marquet de Vasselot speculatively identified “Barthélemy Guéty” (whom they believed to have been French) as the possible illuminator of three illuminated manuscripts, two of which were made for François I or his mother, Louise of Savoy. The volumes are: Ovid's Heroïdes in the French translation of Octavien de Saint-Gelais (Dresden, Sächsische Landesbibliothek − Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek, Ms. O.65), a manuscript whose provenance is unknown; an Oraisons de Cicéro en françois produced for François I (Paris, Bibl. Nat., Ms. fr. 1738); and the Faicts et gestes de la Royne Blanche d’Espagne written and illuminated for Louise (Bibl. Nat., Ms. fr. 5715). The Cicero contains one sole miniature depicting François I at the Battle of Marignano and the Faicts et gestes includes a single illumination which depicts Louise of Savoy in the guise of Blanche of Castille enthroned and accompanied by an invalid (possibly symbolizing the misfortune of the state after enduring the death of the king). The Dresden Ovid, however, is richly illustrated. Its rich and ornate illuminations possess an undeniably Italianate flavor, particularly in their deeply receding landscapes and ornate all’antica architecture. The courtly and elegant ladies depicted in the miniatures, with their oval faces, high foreheads, and elaborate hairstyles bear a distinct affinity to the female figures in Ghetti's panel paintings. There is a remarkable similarity in the way in which figures tend to be reduced to geometric solids, which are carefully modeled with light and shadow. The female figures tend toward the sturdy, and the hands share something of the same angularity found in Ghetti's work on panel. Such suggestive visual comparisons as these urge that the miniatures in the three manuscripts deserve further investigation as possible works by Ghetti. Works in Fucecchio Ghetti's largest work is his Madonna and Child with Saints John the Baptist, Mark, Andrew and Peter and Baptism of Christ now in the Collegiata of Fucecchio. This work was evidently admired by early viewers, since a partial copy of the picture made in 1641 by Andrea di Giovanni Battista Ferrari exists at the nearby parish church of San Bartolomeo at Gavena. More recently, Sydney Freedberg justly called the Fucecchio altarpiece a work of ‘great force and originality’.Freedberg incorrectly attributed the Fucecchio altarpiece to Francesco Granacci The patron and date of the Fucecchio altarpiece are identified by a deliberation in the records of a confraternity in that town, the Compagnia di San Giovanni Battista, dated 10 June 1525. The Compagnia, whose residence was adjacent to the Collegiata of Fucecchio, appointed three of its members as procurators to commission ‘a new, suitable and elegant panel for the altar of the said Compagnia, with those figures and ornaments which shall seem fitting to the said procurators’. The procurators were also given the authority to negotiate the price of the new altarpiece they were commissioning. In all likelihood they commissioned Ghetti's altar-piece shortly after the deliberation was made in the summer of 1525, and the San Pietro a Selva lunette was probably painted not too long before the laudum of September 1527, the similarities between the two pictures are easy to comprehend. Together these two works represent the cornerstones on which any chronology of Ghetti's stylistic development must be based. A passage from the 1541 statutes of the Compagnia di San Giovanni Battista at Fucecchio reveals that the altar of their oratory, adjacent to the Collegiata but deconsecrated in the late eighteenth century, had a dual dedication to the Virgin and St. John the Baptist. Since both John appears prominently in Ghetti's Madonna and Child at Fucecchio and in the Baptism now displayed above it, there is good reason to believe that both these panels were made to be displayed over the altar of the oratory of the Compagnia di San Giovanni Battista. The original format of the Fucecchio altarpiece is not entirely certain, though it is probable that the lunette with the Baptism of Christ was always located above the lower panel depicting the Madonna and Child with saints. Both panels have been cut down drastically from their original dimensions, and the lunette — apparently chopped down to an uncomfortable and much smaller arched format at an unknown date — was subsequently reintegrated with new spandrels in order to fill it out as a rectangle. An inventory of artworks transferred to the Collegiata of Fucecchio by the Opera di San Salvatore after the latter's suppression by Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo (2 June 1790) describes the altarpiece in essentially its present configuration, with the Baptism of Christ above the sacra conversazione. The condition of the whole is described by the inventory as ‘middling’ (mediocre). This seems to accord with the state of the surface as we see it today; the results of a previous overcleaning were revealed during the course of a restoration by Sandra Pucci in 1995. The composition of Ghetti's altarpiece at Fucecchio — featuring the Virgin on an elevated throne and covered by a canopy, set against a colonnaded apse and flanked by standing saints — reflects Raphael's unfinished Madonna del Baldacchino, a work that cast a long shadow in early- Cinquecento Florentine painting. Ghetti copied the figure of St. Peter at lower right from Granacci's Madonna and Child with Sts. John the Baptist, Nicholas of Bari, Anthony Abbot and Peter at Montemurlo — curiously, the same figure that his fellow Florentine Giovanni Larciani had copied in his own Fucecchio altarpiece only a few years earlier. Like his work at nearby San Pietro a Selva, Ghetti's commission at Fucecchio may have come about (in part at least) by way of local family connections. Archival records reveal that Florentine nun, Margherita di Domenico Ghetti. quite possibly a relative of the painter, was in the Clarissan convent of Sant’Andrea at Fucecchio from at least April 1529 through the end of the 1530s, serving as its abbess in 1531–32; the circumstance suggests some ancestral connection between the Ghetti clan of Florence and the town of Fucecchio. In any event, the extent of Bartolomeo Ghetti's activity in the lower Valdarno suggests that his family may have had roots in this region. Parallels could be drawn with Ghetti's contemporaries. Larciani who found a ready market for his work in the Arno valley from which his ancestors had migrated to Florence. And Rosso Fiorentino migrated during this period to Arezzo and its surrounding towns — from one of which, years earlier, his father had emigrated to Florence. Missing Virgin and Child with St. John Waldman (2003) first identified Ghetti as the author of a panel depicting the Madonna and Child with St. John, property of the Seminario Patriarcale of Venice. Although this picture mysteriously disappeared from the Seminario's Pinacoteca a few decades ago, the work was well photographed as a result of a traditional attribution to Raphael, and on the basis of a clear Alinari photograph dating from the early years of the twentieth century it has been possible to identify the painting's true author with a more than reasonable degree of certainty. Ghetti's lost Madonna and Child, which measures 54 x 50 cm., forms part of the historic collection of marchese Federico Manfredini (1743–1829), the wealthy and influential counselor of the Grand Dukes of Tuscany. Born into the provincial nobility at Rovigo in 1743, Manfredini first rose to prominence as a military commander in Austrian service. His career at the Tuscan court of Lorraine began in 1776, when Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo summoned him as tutor to his children. Under Pietro Leopoldo's son and successor Ferdinando III, Manfredini was appointed Maggiordomo Maggiore, and negotiating in this guise with Napoleon in 1797 he briefly preserved the independence of the Grand Duchy. Forced to flee with his sovereign before Napoleon's forces only two years later, Manfredini fell into disgrace and was exiled to Sicily. In 1803, when Ferdinando III was compensated for the loss of Tuscany with the title of Prince Elector and Duke of Salzburg, Manfredini returned to his former position at the Grand Ducal court. But he retired from public life, officially on account of a riding accident, in 1805, making his home at first in Padua and subsequently at his villa at Campo Verardo, in the Venetian terraferma, where he died in 1829. According to early authors, the Madonna and Child with St. John comes from the Grand Ducal collection at Palazzo Pitti, from which the picture — already bearing the optimistic attribution to Raphael — was presented to Manfredini by Grand Duke Pietro Leopoldo of Tuscany. The Alinari photograph shows the inner part of the work's gilt frame, consisting of a cyma molding and, around it, a row of oblong beads; this is easily recognizable as the standard cornice da collezionista given by Manfredi to many of his paintings, and which still graces a large proportion of the paintings in the Seminario of Venice. The celebrity of Manfredini's “Raphael” is attested by the existence of copy, known only from an old photograph in the Fototeca Berenson. A note on the back indicates that it is on canvas and belonged to the Carlo Foresti collection in Milan as of in October 1926. This version has a slick, glib quality that suggests it is probably a replica created around the end of the eighteenth century or the beginning of the nineteenth — perhaps as a substitute for the original that was given away by the Grand Duke. The traditional attribution to Raphael endured for well over a century after Manfredini acquired it, still appearing (but with a question mark) on the early twentieth century photograph by Alinari. According to tradition, Charles Le Brun perceived in it the emergence of Raphael's first truly individual style, after throwing off the manner of Perugino. It was accepted by Edwards in his 1809 inventory, by the Venetian police inspector and art dilettante Antonio Neu Mayr (or Neumayr) in his 1811 treatise on Italian painting and his 1836 Mazzolino pittorico, and by Giannantonio Moschini in his 1842 catalogue. The anonymous 1912 Guida del visitatore artista opened up the question to include either Raphael or some other pupil of Perugino, while Giovanni Costantini's 1916 essay on the Manfredini collection reasserted the traditional attribution with a question mark. An attribution to Bachiacca was argued by Adolfo Venturi in his monumental Storia dell’arte italiana, which was accepted by Roberto Salvini and by Berenson in the first published version of his lists. In the 1936 Italian edition, Berenson later reconsidered the problem and proposed an attribution to Domenico Puligo, to which a question mark would be subjoined in the posthumous edition of 1963. The identification has not been taken up in the literature on Puligo, including the recent catalogue raisonné of the artist's work by Elena Capretti. Guidebooks to the collection reveal that the painting had vanished from the Seminario by the late 1960s. It seems highly possible, however, that the picture disappeared from the Pinacoteca of the Seminario as early as the Second World War, when a number of objects from the collection went missing.

For Q1 Character names see Thompson & Taylor (2006b, 42) Three different early versions of the play survive: known as the First Quarto (\\"Q1\\"), Second Quarto (\\"Q2\\"), and First Folio (\\"F1\\"), each has lines—and even scenes—missing in the others, and some character names vary. Overview of main characters A detail of the engraving of Daniel Maclise's 1842 painting The Play-scene in Hamlet, portraying the moment when the guilt of Claudius is revealed *Hamlet is the Prince of Denmark; he is son to the late King Hamlet; and nephew to the present King Claudius. *Claudius is the King of Denmark, elected to the throne after the death of his brother, King Hamlet. Claudius has married Gertrude, his brother's widow. *Gertrude is the Queen of Denmark, and King Hamlet's widow, now married to Claudius, and mother to Hamlet. *The Ghost appears in the image of Hamlet's father, the late King Hamlet (Old Hamlet). *Polonius (\\"Corambis\\" in \\"Q1\\") is Claudius's chief counsellor, and the father of Ophelia and Laertes. *Laertes is the son of Polonius, and has returned to Elsinore from Paris. *Ophelia is the daughter of Polonius, and Laertes's sister, who lives with her father at Elsinore. She is in love with Hamlet. *Horatio is a good friend of Hamlet, from the university at Wittenberg, who came to Elsinore Castle to attend King Hamlet's funeral. *Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are childhood friends and schoolmates of Hamlet, who were summoned to Elsinore by Claudius and Gertrude. *Fortinbras Norwegian crown prince, who assumes the throne of Denmark after Hamlet's death. Elsinore sentries Marcellus, Barnardo and Francisco Marcellus, Bernardo (or Barnardo) and Francisco are sentries at Elsinore. Francisco gives up his watch to Bernardo in the opening of the play, and it is Bernardo and Marcellus, who first alert Horatio to the appearance of King Hamlet's Ghost.Hamlet 1.1 & 1.2 Marcellus goes with Horatio to tell Hamlet about the Ghost's appearance.Hamlet 1.2 Marcellus is the most prominent of the three.Hamlet 1.1, 1.2, 1.4 & 1.5 Barnardo (in F1) is spelled Bernardo in Q2 (Second Quarto) and Barnard in Q1 (First Quarto). Elsinore entourage Voltemand and Cornelius Voltemand and Cornelius are ambassadors sent by the King of Denmark, Claudius, to old King Norway.Hamlet 2.2 Reynaldo He is a servant to Polonius.Hamlet 2.1 (In the \\"Q1\\" text, Reynaldo is called \\"Montano\\" and Polonius is called \\"Corambis.\\") Polonius sends Reynaldo to Paris to check up on what Laertes is doing. A Gentleman He informs Gertrude of Ophelia's strange change in behaviour, before Ophelia's first \\"mad\\" appearance.Hamlet 4.5 Osric He is the courtier sent by Claudius to invite Hamlet to participate in the duel with Laertes.Hamlet 5.2 (This character is called \\"Ostricke\\" in the Second Quarto.) Osric, as well as Polonius, attempts to engage with Hamlet in the elaborate, witty discourse, fully consistent with Baldassare Castiglione's 1528 work, The Courtier. This work outlines several courtly rules, specifically advising royal retainers to amuse their masters with inventive language.MacCary (1998, 84–85). The Players The Players are a company of actors who arrive at Elsinore Castle. Friends of Hamlet, they had earlier performed in \\"the city\\" (presumably Copenhagen), but faced stiff competition from boy performers, so they have traveled to Elsinore to offer Hamlet their services. At Elsinore, they perform a version—which Hamlet has modified and called The Mousetrap—of the play The Murder of Gonzago in the \\"play within a play\\". First Player or Player King He is the leader of the troupe of touring actors. In the \\"play within a play\\", he takes the part of the king who is murdered.Hamlet 3.2 Second Player or Player Queen This role was traditionally performed by a man, as were all the female parts in Hamlet, since women did not appear on stage in Elizabethan times. Third Player He is also called Lucianus in the \\"play within a play\\".Hamlet 3.2.26 The name may be a reference to Lucius in the Brutus legend, a source for Saxo Grammaticus' Gesta Danorum, itself a candidate source for Hamlet. Plays the role similar to Claudius and kills the king by pouring poison into his ear. Fourth Player The Mousetrap play- within-a-play has a very brief Prologue recited by one of the Players. The First Player may do the Prologue, but if not, a Fourth Player, with a speaking part, is probably required to do it. Ophelia's funeral Two Clowns (a sexton gravedigger, and a bailiff) The bailiff informs the sexton that Ophelia's death was suicide, but the sexton argues the point. Later, the sexton unearths Yorick's skull, which leads to Hamlet's famous \\"Alas, poor Yorick\\" speech. During the Interregnum, all theatres were closed down by the puritan government.Marsden (2002, 21) However, even during this time playlets known as drolls were often performed illegally, including one based on the two clowns, called The Grave-Makers, based on Act 5, Scene 1 of Hamlet.Holland (2007, 34) A Priest, or Doctor of Divinity He officiates at Ophelia's funeral, and does not give her full Christian burial rights, since the church suspects her death was suicide. Called a \\"Priest\\" in the First Folio edition of \\"Hamlet,\\" his speech prefix in the Second Quarto is \\"Doct\\" for Doctor of Divinity, a Protestant clergyman. Thus, the two original \\"good\\" printings of the play are in disagreement whether the clergyman is Protestant or Catholic.Hamlet 5.1.197 onwards Other characters A Captain He is a commander in Fortinbras' invading army, and is assigned by Fortinbras to get the license from Claudius for Fortinbras's army to be in Denmark.Hamlet 4.4 Sailors (pirates) The sailors are two pirates who deliver a letter from Hamlet to Horatio, informing Horatio that Hamlet has returned to Denmark. English Ambassadors They appear in the final scene to report that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead.Hamlet 5.2.236 onwards  References  All references to Hamlet, unless otherwise specified, are taken from the Arden Shakespeare \\"Q2\\" (Thompson and Taylor, 2006a).

Military academy made unique contributions to history:[Lake Edition], Arlington Heights, Ill.: Paddock Publications Nov 11, 2001. pg. 1 It was built by Royal Page Davidson and the cadets of the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in Highland Park, Illinois. Davidson designed this vehicle in 1901.St. John's, p. 47 He and his students at the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy built two of these partially armored military vehicles. They were armed with Colt .30 caliber machine guns.Clymer, p. 11 The Davidson Durryea Semi-Armoured car mounted a Colt automatic gun. The vehicles were powered by a tubular steam boiler. They had difficulty in going up hills because of changes of the water level in the boiler. Davidson made these lightly armored military vehicles of one thousand pounds at the Academy campus in Highland Park, Illinois. These two partially armored military vehicles were labeled No. 1 and No. 2. Presently No. 2 is at the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. The Peoria Rubber and Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Company in Peoria, Illinois manufactured Davidson's armored military vehicles. They built them from the patent specifications of Charles Duryea of the Duryea Motor Wagon Company. The Automobile Battery armored vehicle front steam boiler is connected to a six-horsepower Duryea Motor Wagon Company three-cylinder steam engine. The front bulletproof shield to protect the driver was detachable. There was a vertical opening in the metal shield surrounding the machine gun. The machine guns on the vehicles could fire 480 shots a minute, rotate 180 degrees, and had a firing range of 2000 yards. The Davidson Automobile Battery armored vehicle’s fuel tank and engine were covered with armor and a metal bulletproof removable shield added to the front to protect the passengers. Davidson had his cadets add the Colt automatic machine gun as part of the School's Manual Training Department's program. The military vehicle was intended to be a scout car. These prototypes that Davidson with his cadets manufactured were never produced commercially, however they would become the armored car as we know it today as well as the armored tank used in modern warfare. It is the forerunner of today's anti-aircraft gun carriers.Stern, p. 175 Colonel Davidson also designed and built two mobile weapons that were precurors of our modern anti-aircraft gun carriers. The curved front body section had a Colt machine gun mounted on top for the front passenger to use, while the driver drove the military vehicle. There was cargo space available underneath the carriage of the armored vehicle. The Davidson Automobile Battery partially armored vehicle was further developed to the first fully armored vehicle in the U.S. Footnotes Sources * American men of mark (1917), A Thousand American Men of Mark Today * Clemens, Al J., The American Military Armored Car, A.J.

Carnaroli is used for making risotto, differing from the more common arborio rice due to its higher starch content and firmer texture, as well as having a longer grain. Carnaroli rice keeps its shape better than other forms of rice during the slow cooking required for making risotto due to its higher amylose content. It is the most widely used rice in Italian cuisine, and is highly prized. History The history of Carnaroli is not well defined,di chiamarsi carnaroli the sources date its birth to 1945 thanks to the crossing between Vialone and Lencino, following the numerous attempts made in the rice fields of Paullo by the agronomist Ettore De Vecchi.Carnaroli, il riso nato a Paullo This variety was named after the name of a farmer who worked with De Vecchi, or to the desire to dedicate it to Emiliano Carnaroli, the commissioner of the \\"Ente Nazionale Risi\\" (Rice National Organism) at that time. The first registration of the Carnaroli variety in the Varietal Register is from 1974 and the responsibility for the conservation in purity was entrusted to Achille De Vecchi from Paullo. In 1983, after the conservation tasks were passed to the \\"Ente Nazionale Risi\\", it was re-registered in the national register and the person responsible for conservation in purity became the National Organism itself.

He was considered the greatest linguist of his age.Andrew Edward Breen, A General and Critical Introduction to the Study of Holy Scripture, p. 551. Sirleto was born at Guardavalle near Stilo in Calabria. The son of a physician, he received an excellent education, made the acquaintance of distinguished scholars at Rome, and became an intimate friend of Cardinal Marcello Cervino, later Pope Marcellus II. He prepared for Cervino, who was President of the Council of Trent in its initial period, extensive reports on all the important questions presented for discussion. After his appointment as custodian of the Vatican Library, Sirleto drew up a complete descriptive catalogue of its Greek manuscripts and prepared a new edition of the Vulgate. Pope Paul IV named him prothonotary and tutor to two of his nephews. After this pope's death he taught Greek and Hebrew at Rome, numbering Charles Borromeo among his students. There was talk of making him Pope, but it was considered that the drift of his mind was too much given to letters to permit him to run a strong, practical administration in those troubled times. During the concluding period of the Council of Trent, he was, although he continued to reside at Rome, the adviser of the cardinal-legates. He was himself created cardinal in 1565 at the request of Charles Borromeo, became Bishop of San Marco in Calabria in 1566, and Bishop of Squillace in 1568. An order of the papal secretary of state, however, enjoined his residence at Rome, where he was named, in 1570, librarian of the Vatican Library. This he enriched with many valuable texts on Greek, Latin and Oriental subjects. His influence was paramount in the execution of the scientific undertakings decreed by the Council of Trent. He collaborated in the publication of the Roman Catechism, presided over the Commissions for the reform of Roman Breviary and Roman Missal, and directed the work of the new edition of the Roman Martyrology. Highly appreciative of Greek culture, he entertained all friendly relations with the East and encouraged all efforts tending to ecclesiastical reunion. His learning was such that he was reported to discourse in his sleep in Greek and Latin. Latino Latini declared in a letter to Andreas Masius that he considered that Sirleto was equal in learning to all the others who worked on the Vulgate. He was attended in his last illness by Philip Neri. He died at Rome, and was buried in the presence of Pope Sixtus V. He was a manuscript collector (e.g. Minuscule 373).

Wave radar is a type of radar for measuring wind waves. Several instruments based on a variety of different concepts and techniques are available, and these are all often called. This article (see also Grønlie 2004), gives a brief description of the most common ground-based radar remote sensing techniques. Instruments based on radar remote sensing techniques have become of particular interest in applications where it is important to avoid direct contact with the water surface and avoid structural interference. A typical case is wave measurements from an offshore platform in deep water, where swift currents could make mooring a wave buoy enormously difficult. Another interesting case is a ship under way, where having instruments in the sea is highly impractical and interference from the ship's hull must be avoided.  Radar remote sensing   Terms and definitions  Basically there are two different classes of radar remote sensors for ocean waves. * Direct sensor measures directly some relevant parameter of the wave system (like surface elevation or water particle velocity). * Indirect sensors observe the surface waves via the interaction with some other physical process as for example the radar cross section of the sea surface. Microwave radars may be used in two different modes; * The near vertical mode. The radar echo is generated by specular reflections from the sea surface. * The low grazing angle mode. The radar echo is generated by Bragg scattering, hence wind generated surface ripple (capillary waves) must be present. The backscattered signal will be modulated by the large surface gravity waves and the gravity wave information is derived from the modulation of the backscattered signal. An excellent presentation of the theories of microwave remote sensing of the sea surface is given by Plant and Shuler (1980). The radar footprint (the size of the surface area which is illuminated by the radar) must be small in comparison with all ocean wavelengths of interest. The radar spatial resolution is determined by the bandwidth of the radar signal (see radar signal characteristics) and the beamwidth of the radar antenna. The beam of a microwave antenna diverges. Consequently, the resolution decreases with increasing range. For all practical purposes, the beam of an IR radar (laser) does not diverge. Therefore, its resolution is independent of range. HF radars utilize the Bragg scattering mechanism and do always operate at very low grazing angles. Due to the low frequency of operation the radar waves are backscattered directly from the gravity waves and surface ripple need not be present. Radar transceivers may be coherent or non-coherent. Coherent radars measure Doppler-modulation as well as amplitude modulation, while non-coherent radars only measure amplitude modulation. Consequently, a non-coherent radar echo contains less information about the sea surface properties. Examples of non-coherent radars are conventional marine navigation radars. Energy backscattered from sea surface as a function of angle. The radar transmitter waveform may be either unmodulated continuous wave, modulated or pulsed. An unmodulated continuous wave radar has no range resolution, but can resolve targets on the basis of different velocity, while a modulated or pulsed radar can resolve echoes from different ranges. The radar waveform plays a very important role in radar theory (Plant and Shuler, 1980).  Factors influencing performance  *Mode of operation or measurement geometry (vertical or grazing) *Class of system (direct or indirect) *Frequency of operation *Radar waveform (unmodulated CW or modulated/pulsed) *Type of transceiver (coherent or non-coherent) *Radar antenna properties  Remote sensing techniques  An excellent survey of different radar techniques for remote sensing of waves is given by Tucker (1991).  Microwave rangefinders  Microwave rangefinders also operate in vertical mode at GHz frequencies and are not as affected by fog and water spray as the laser rangefinder. A continuous wave frequency modulated (CWFM) or pulsed radar waveform is normally used to provide range resolution. Since the beam diverges, the linear size of the footprint is directly proportional to range, while the area of the footprint is proportional to the square of range. One example of a microwave range finder is the Miros SM-094, which is designed to measure waves and water level, including tides. This sensor is used as an air gap (bridge clearance) sensor in NOAA's PORTS system. Another example is the WaveRadar REX, which is a derivative of a Rosemount tank radar. Digitized sea clutter image. From data on the elevation of the surface of the water at three or more locations, a directional spectrum of wave height can be computed. The algorithm is similar to the one which generates a directional spectrum from data on heave (vertical motion), pitch and roll at a single location, as provided by a disc-shaped wave buoy. An array of three vertical radars, having footprints at the vertices of a horizontal, equilateral triangle, can provide the necessary data on water surface elevation. “Directional WaveGuide” is a commercial radar system based on this technique. It is available from the Dutch companies Enraf and Radac. Marine navigation radars Marine navigation radars (X band) provide sea clutter images which contain a pattern resembling a sea wave pattern. By digitizing the radar video signal it can be processed by a digital computer. Sea surface parameters may be calculated on the basis of these digitized images. The marine navigation radar operates in low grazing angle mode and wind generated surface ripple must be present. The marine navigation radar is non-coherent and is a typical example of an indirect wave sensor, because there is no direct relation between wave height and radar back-scatter modulation amplitude. An empirical method of wave spectrum scaling is normally employed. Marine navigation radar based wave sensors are excellent tools for wave direction measurements. A marine navigation radar may also be a tool for surface current measurements. Point measurements of the current vector as well as current maps up to a distance of a few km can be provided (Gangeskar, 2002). Miros WAVEX has its main area of application as directional wave measurements from moving ships. Another example of a marine radar based system is OceanWaves WaMoS II. Measurement geometry of pulsed Doppler wave and current radar. The range gated pulsed Doppler microwave radar  The range gated pulsed Doppler microwave radar operates in low grazing angle mode. By using several antennas it may be used as a directional wave sensor, basically measuring the directional spectrum of the horizontal water particle velocity. The velocity spectrum is directly related to the wave height spectrum by a mathematical model based on linear wave theory and accurate measurements of the wave spectrum can be provided under most conditions. As measurements are taken at a distance from the platform on which it is mounted, the wave field is to a small degree disturbed by interference from the platform structure. Miros Wave and current radar is the only available wave sensor based on the range gated pulsed Doppler radar technique. This radar also uses the dual frequency technique (see below) to perform point measurements of the surface current vector The dual frequency microwave radar The dual frequency microwave radar transmits two microwave frequencies simultaneously. The frequency separation is chosen to give a “spatial beat” length which is in the range of the water waves of interest. The dual frequency radar may be considered a microwave equivalent of the high frequency (HF) radar (see below). The dual frequency radar is suitable for the measurement of surface current. As far as wave measurements are concerned, the back-scatter processes are too complicated (and not well understood) to allow useful measurement accuracy to be attained. The HF radar The HF radar CODAR SeaSonde and Helzel WERA are well established as a powerful tool for sea current measurements up to a range of 300 km. It operates in the HF and low VHF frequencies band corresponding to a radar wavelength in the range of 10 to 300m. The Doppler shift of the first order Bragg lines of the radar echo is used to derive sea current estimates in very much the same way as for the dual frequency microwave radar. Two radar installations are normally required, looking at the same patch of the sea surface from different angles.CODAR Ocean Sensors (COS) The latest generation of shore-based ocean radar can reach more than 200 km for ocean current mapping and more than 100 km for wave measurements Helzel WERA. For all ocean radars, the accuracy in range is excellent. With shorter ranges, the range resolution gets finer. The angular resolution and accuracy depends on the used antenna array configuration and applied algorithms (direction finding or beam forming). The WERA system provides the option to use both techniques; the compact version with direction finding or the array type antenna system with beam forming methods.  Specialized X-Band  The FutureWaves technology was originally developed as an Environmental Ship and Motion Forecasting (ESMF) system for the Navy's ONR (Office of Naval Research) by General Dynamics' Applied Physical Sciences Corporation. The technology was adapted to be released in the commercial market and made its first public appearance at the 2017 Offshore Technology Conference in Houston Texas. This technology differs from existing wave forecasting systems by using a customized wave sensing radar capable of measuring backscatter Doppler out to ranges of approximately 5 km. The radar antenna is vertically polarized to enhance the sea-surface backscatter signal. It also uses an innovative radar signal processing scheme that addresses the inherently noisy backscatter signals through a mathematical process termed least squares inversion. This approach applies a highly over-determined filter to the radar data, and rejects radar scans that do not observe incoming waves. The result is an accurate representation of the propagating incident wave field that will force ship motions over a 2-3 minute window. The wave processing algorithms also enable real-time calculation of wave field two-dimensional power spectra and significant wave height similar to that provided by a wave buoy. It also uses a vessel motion prediction process that relies on a pre-calculated force/response database. Dynamic motional degrees of freedom are then represented as a lumped mechanical system whose future motions are predicted by numerically solving a multi-degree-of-freedom, forced, coupled differential equation with initial inertial state provided by vessel motion sensor outputs. The time-domain solution allows for nonlinear forcing mechanisms, such as quadratic roll damping and roll control systems, to be captured in the forecasting. Finally, it uses the Gravity open architecture middleware solution to integrate the sensor feeds, processing subroutines and user displays. This open architecture approach will allow users to implement customized operator displays along with physics based models of specific vessels and machinery (e.g. cranes) into the system.

This neo-Romanesque church was designed by Polish architects Tomasz Pajzderski and Władysław Marconi. The cornerstone was laid in 1905 and the church was completed in 1910. The bricks for its walls were sourced from Częstochowa, whilst the roof tiles came from Włocławek. Its construction was financed by Edward Woyniłłowicz (1847-1928), a prominent Belarusian-Polish landowner, businessman and civic activist. The church was named and consecrated in memory of Woyniłłowicz's two deceased children, Szymon and Helena.  History  In 1903, about 2,000 of Minsk's Catholics wrote a petition to the local authorities asking for a site to start building a new Catholic church. This request was approved and construction started in 1905. The church was consecrated on 20 September 1910. On 21 December 1910, the church was opened. At this time, Minsk was part of the Minsk Governorate of the Russian Empire. In 1921, Minsk became the capital of the Belorussian Soviet Socialist Republic (BSSR) within the Soviet Union and the church was sacked by the Red Army. In 1932, it was closed down by the Soviet authorities and was secularised. It was transferred to the State Polish Theatre of the BSSR. It was later used as a cinema. In 1941 during the Second World War, the German occupation administration returned the building to its original use as a church. After the war, it was again closed by the Soviet authorities and again used as a cinema. In 1990, after two hunger strikes which were organized by the Minsk Catholic activists Anna Nicievska-Sinevicz and Edward Tarletski, the building was returned to the Roman Catholic Church. The church's interior has been fully restored and it is now an important centre of religious, cultural and social life in Minsk. It has also become a centre for the revived Belarusian Greek Catholic Church. In 2006, the earthly remains of Edward Wayniłłowicz and his wife were reburied in the church. In 1921, Wayniłłowicz, the donor who had the church built, was forced to leave his home and lands in Slutsk, Belarus, due to the territorial changes after the First World War as stipulated in the Peace of Riga. He resettled in Bydgoszcz, Poland where he died in 1928. On 26 August 2020, during an anti-government demonstration in Independence Square, law enforcers blocked the doors of the church were blocked by the police while there were about 100 people inside.У Менску затрыманьні, АМАП заблякаваў людзей у Чырвоным касьцёле.

The name was chosen in honour of the military Saint Archangel Michael, who assisted in the victory in the shape of a wing in the sky. Its medieval history including claims of recognition in 1171 by Pope Alexander III, relies heavily on documentation from the 16th to the 18th century, it is classified by the privately operated and funded International Commission on Orders of Chivalry as an \\"Institution of chivalric character\\" that was founded as a chivalric order subsequently \\"revived by the dynastic successor of the founding authority\\" (2004).http://www.icocregister.org/2004otherinstitutions.htm The knights were under the jurisdiction of the Abbot of the Cistercian Alcobaça Monastery, and recited the same prayers as its lay brothers along with other military orders during the Reconquista. It is considered to have been revived twice. First in 1828 or 1848 in support of the Miguelist movement by King Miguel I of Portugal, and secondly in its current form in 1981 by later Portuguese monarchists, recognised in 1986 by the Royal House of Braganza. Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza, pretender to the Portuguese throne as head of its former royal house, is Grand Master of the order and Judge of the associated Royal Brotherhood, statuted as Roman Catholic association of the faithful in 2001, with proof of previous statutes of 1630, 1848 and 1981. Ever since, the order has been conferred on individuals of merit through the brotherhood chosen exclusively by the House of Braganza. Name The name derives from the Wing of Saint Michael the Archangel, who, it was believed, assisted at the victory of the Taking of Santarém from the Moors on 8 May 1147. It is confirmed fact that the passage of Halley's Comet was perceived as a flaming wing in the sky. History Depending on the source consulted, the order existed briefly in the 12th century, fell into disuse in 1732, subsequently revived in 1848, survived until 1910, subsequently revived in 1986. Unlike many other Portuguese orders, it has not been nationalized as a decoration of the state by the post-1910 Portuguese Republic. Middle Ages The order was founded by King Afonso I to honour a group of knights of the Order of Saint James of the Sword from the Kingdom of León who assisted him in retaking Santarém from the Moors on the Feast of Saint Michael, May 8, 1147. Originally, the order was formed from members of the Military Order of Saint James. This is why it maintains on its coat of arms the red sword of this Order conjoined with two fleurs de lis representing the Cistercian Rule its members observed at the Royal Abbey of Alcobaça where the Order, along with 6 other Military Orders was headquartered until the re-establishment of all Orders as unarmed and non- military Orders of \\"Honorific Knighthood\\" in 1834. The Order's first statutes were approved by Pope Alexander III in 1171. The order fell into disuse by 1732 at the latest. In 1907, George Cyprian Alston, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia stated that the order died in the Middle Ages, soon after the death of its founder, Alphonse, while others, such as John C.L. Gieseler (also known by the German form of his name Johann K.L. Gieseler), argued that it only ever existed on paper. It was not, in any case, included among the royal orders that were nationalized by the Portuguese Republic after the Revolution of 1910. Miguelism The Order was restored by King Miguel I in 1828 during his brief rule before losing the Liberal Wars to his brother King Pedro IV. Later, in 1848, the order received new statutes under permission of Pope Gregory XVI, whilst King Miguel was living in exile in the Rome. These Statutes restructured it as a secret military order to combat Freemasonry and restore the Absolutist Monarchy in Portugal. Some Portuguese scholars, such as Marcus de Noronha da Costa, Gomes Abrunhosa Marques de Almeida, and Manuel Ângelo, reject the description of the 1848 institution as a revived order and regard it as a secret society aiming to restore Miguel's branch of the Braganza family to power in Portugal. The headquarters of the revived order were located in Porto. After his death in 1866, a group of knights are said to have remained until 1868. Its activity was however officially suspended after the Pope prohibited all secret organisations, Roman Catholic or otherwise. There are disputed claims that Miguel's revived order was awarded by his descendants until in 1986, Duarte Pio, Duke of Braganza and pretender to the Portuguese throne, informed the Holy See and the Portuguese Republic that he still considered himself to be the Grand Master of the Order, and that although he did not have the power to validly alter the statutes a king had previously approved, he nonetheless still conferred it as an award. Duarte Pio's claims have been disputed in Portuguese courts which, in at least one case, held that Duarte Pio's order is an entirely new private entity, not a dynastic award of the House of Braganza. The Civil Courts finally ruled decisively in favour of the valid and founded claims of Dom Duarte de Bragança, and on December 7, Duarte Pio of Braganza won the case and retained the legal rights.http://www.flashvidas.pt/a_ferver/detalhe/duarte_pio_absolvido_pelo_tribunal.html  Modern revival  In 2001, the Duke promulgated new statutes submitted to various bishops to govern a royal Catholic brotherhood to complement the order as an active social group for Roman Catholic members, and since that time, the order has been conferred on individuals through the brotherhood chosen exclusively by the House of Braganza. The signing of the new statutes of the order were made with proof of previous statutes of the years 1630, 1848 and 1981 by Prince Duarte Pio. Dispute 2014-2015 In 2014, the Court of Lisbon forbade Duarte Pio of Braganza to use the insignia of the Order of Saint Michael of the Wing and demanded that he pay compensation of €300,000 to the legal owners of the rights, Nuno da Câmara Pereira, who allegedly registered the name \\"Order of Saint Michael of the Wing\\" (Portuguese: \\"Ordem de São Miguel da Ala\\") in 1981, whereas Duarte Pio is said to have registered it in 2004.D.

Located in central Italy along the Tyrrhenian coast, Tuscany is home to some of the world's most notable wine regions. Chianti, Brunello di Montalcino and Vino Nobile di Montepulciano are primarily made with Sangiovese grape whereas the Vernaccia grape is the basis of the white Vernaccia di San Gimignano. Tuscany is also known for the dessert wine Vin Santo, made from a variety of the region's grapes. Tuscany has forty-one Denominazioni di origine controllata (DOC) and eleven Denominazioni di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG). In the 1970s a new class of wines known in the trade as \\"Super Tuscans\\" emerged. These wines were made outside DOC/DOCG regulations but were considered of high quality and commanded high prices. Many of these wines became cult wines. In the reformation of the Italian classification system many of the original Super Tuscans now qualify as DOC or DOCG wines (such as the new Bolgheri label) but some producers still prefer the declassified rankings or to use the Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) classification of Toscana. Tuscany has six sub-categories of IGT wines today. History Banqueting scene in the Tomb of the Leopards Winemaker and politician Bettino Ricasoli The history of viticulture in Tuscany dates back to its settlements by the Etruscans in the 8th century BC. Amphora remnants originating in the region show that Tuscan wine was exported to southern Italy and Gaul as early as the 7th century BC. By the 3rd century BC, there were literary references by Greek writers about the quality of Tuscan wine.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition (Oxford University Press) 2006:259. From the fall of the Roman Empire and throughout the Middle Ages, monasteries were the main purveyors of wines in the region. As the aristocratic and merchant classes emerged, they inherited the sharecropping system of agriculture known as mezzadria. This system took its name from the arrangement whereby the landowner provides the land and resources for planting in exchange for half (\\"mezza\\") of the yearly crop. Many Tuscan landowners would turn their half of the grape harvest into wine that would be sold to merchants in Florence. The earliest reference of Florentine wine retailers dates to 1079 and a guild was created in 1282.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 715-716 Oxford University Press 2006 The Arte dei Vinattieri guild established strict regulations on how the Florentine wine merchants could conduct business. No wine was to be sold within of a church. Wine merchants were also prohibited from serving children under 15 or to prostitutes, ruffians and thieves. In the 14th century, an average of of wine was sold every year in Florence. The earliest references to Vino Nobile di Montepulciano wine date to the late 14th century. The first recorded mention of wine from Chianti was by the Tuscan merchant Francesco di Marco Datini, the \\"merchant of Prato\\", who described it as a light, white wine. The Vernaccia and Greco wines of San Gimignano were considered luxury items and treasured as gifts over saffron. During this period Tuscan winemakers began experimenting with new techniques and invented the process of governo which helped to stabilize the wines and ferment the sugar content sufficiently to make them dry. In 1685 the Tuscan author Francesco Redi wrote Bacco in Toscana, a 980-line poem describing the wines of Tuscany. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars, Tuscany returned to the rule of the Habsburgs. It was at this point that the statesman Bettino Ricasoli inherited his family ancestral estate in Broglio located in the heart of the Chianti Classico zone. Determined to improve the estate, Ricasoli traveled throughout Germany and France, studying the grape varieties and viticultural practices. He imported several of the varieties back to Tuscany and experimented with different varieties in his vineyards. However, in his experiments Ricasoli discovered that three local varieties— Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Malvasia— produced the best wine. In 1848, revolutions broke out in Italy and Ricasoli's beloved wife died, leaving him with little interest to devote to wine. In the 1850s Oidium Uncinula necator and war devastated most of Tuscany's vineyards with many peasant farmers leaving for other parts of Italy or to emigrate to the Americas.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 416-420 Simon and Schuster 1989 Climate and geography Vineyards around Siena. The region of Tuscany includes seven coastal islands and is Italy's fifth largest region. It is bordered to the northwest by Liguria, the north by Emilia-Romagna, Umbria to the east and Lazio to the south. To the west is the Tyrrhenian Sea which gives the area a warm mediterranean climate. The terrain is quite hilly (over 68% of the terrain), progressing inward to the Apennine Mountains along the border with Emilia-Romagna. The hills have a tempering effect on the summertime heat, with many vineyards planted on the higher elevations of the hillsides.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 142-145 Hungry Minds 2001 The Sangiovese grape performs better when it can receive more direct sunlight, which is a benefit of the many hillside vineyards in Tuscany. The majority of the region's vineyards are found at altitudes of 500–1600 feet (150–500 meters). The higher elevations also increase the diurnal temperature variation, helping the grapes maintain their balance of sugars and acidity as well as their aromatic qualities.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 703 Oxford University Press 2006 Wines and grapes Sangiovese grapes harvested in the Montepulciano region. After Piedmont and the Veneto, Tuscany produces the third highest volume of DOC/G quality wines. Tuscany is Italy's third most planted region (behind Sicily and Apulia) but it is eighth in production volume. This is partly because the soil of Tuscany is very poor, and producers emphasize low yields and higher quality levels in their wine. More than 80% of the regions' production is in red wine. The Sangiovese grape is Tuscany's most prominent grape; however, many different clonal varieties exist, as many towns have their own local version of Sangiovese. Cabernet Sauvignon has been planted in Tuscany for over 250 years, but has only recently become associated with the region due to the rise of the Super Tuscans. Other international varieties found in Tuscany include Cabernet franc, Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot noir, Sauvignon blanc and Syrah. Of the many local red grape varieties Canaiolo, Colorino, Malvasia nera and Mammolo are the most widely planted. For Tuscan white wines, Trebbiano is the most widely planted variety followed by Malvasia, Vermentino and Vernaccia. Super Tuscans Tignanello, one of the early Super Tuscans. Super Tuscans are an unofficial category of Tuscan wines, not recognized within the Italian wine classification system. Although an extraordinary number of wines claim to be “the first Super Tuscan,” most would agree that this credit belongs to Sassicaia, the brainchild of marchese Mario Incisa della Rocchetta, who planted Cabernet Sauvignon at his Tenuta San Guido estate in Bolgheri back in 1944. It was for many years the marchese’s personal wine, until, starting with the 1968 vintage, it was released commercially in 1971. The growth of Super Tuscans is also rooted in the restrictive DOC practices of the Chianti zone prior to the 1990s. During this time Chianti could be composed of no more than 70% Sangiovese and had to include at least 10% of one of the local white wine grapes. Producers who deviated from these regulations could not use the Chianti name on their wine labels and would be classified as vino da tavola - Italy's lowest wine designation. By the 1970s, the consumer market for Chianti wines was suffering and the wines were widely perceived to be lacking quality. Many Tuscan wine producers thought they could produce a better quality wine if they were not hindered by the DOC regulations.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 155 & 167-169 Hungry Minds 2001 The marchese Piero Antinori was one of the first to create a \\"Chianti-style\\" wine that ignored the DOC regulations, releasing a 1971 Sangiovese-Cabernet Sauvignon blend known as Tignanello in 1978. He was inspired by Sassicaia, of which he was given the sale agency by his uncle Mario Incisa della Rocchetta. Other producers followed suit and soon the prices for these Super Tuscans were consistently beating the prices of some of most well known Chianti. Rather than rely on name recognition of the Chianti region, the Super Tuscan producers sought to create a wine brand that would be recognizable on its own merits by consumers. By the late 1980s, the trend of creating high-quality non-DOC wines had spread to other regions of Tuscany, as well as Piedmont and Veneto. Modification to the Chianti DOC regulation attempted to \\"correct\\" the issues of Super Tuscans, so that many of the original Super Tuscans would now qualify as standard DOC/G Chianti. Most producers have brought their Super Tuscans back under legal regulations, notably since the creation of the less restrictive IGT Toscana designation in 1992 and the DOC Bolgheri designation in 1994, while the pioneer Sassicaia was prized with its own exclusive Bolgheri Sassicaia DOC. In addition to wines based on the Sangiovese grape, many well known Super Tuscans are based on a \\"Bordeaux-blend\\", meaning a combination of grapes typical for Bordeaux (esp. Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot). These grapes are not originally from the region, but imported and planted later. The climate in Tuscany has proven to be very good for these grapes. Vin Santo While Tuscany is not the only Italian region to make the passito dessert wine Vin Santo (meaning \\"holy wine\\"), the Tuscan versions of the wine are well regarded and sought for by wine consumers. The best-known version is from the Chianti Classico and is produced with a blend of Trebbiano and Malvasia Bianca. Red and rosé styles are also produced mostly based on the Sangiovese grape. The wines are aged in barrels for a minimum of three years, four if it is meant to be a Riserva.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 156-163 Hungry Minds 2001 Wine regions Tuscany's 41 DOC and 11 DOCG are spread out across the region's ten provinces.  Brunello di Montalcino  Village of Montalcino. Brunello is the name of the local Sangiovese variety that is grown around the village of Montalcino. Located south of the Chianti Classico zone, the Montalcino range is drier and warmer than Chianti. Monte Amiata shields the area from the winds coming from the southeast. Many of the area's vineyards are located on the hillsides leading up towards the mountain to elevations of around though some vineyards can be found in lower-lying areas. The wines of northern and eastern regions tend to ripen more slowly and produce more perfumed and lighter wines. The southern and western regions are warmer, and the resulting wines tend to be richer and more intense. The Brunello variety of Sangiovese seems to flourish in this terroir, ripening easily and consistently producing wines of deep color, extract, richness with full bodies and good balance of tannins. In the mid-19th century, a local farmer named Clemente Santi is believed to have isolated the Brunello clone and planted it in this region. His grandson Ferruccio Biondi-Santi helped to popularize Brunello di Montalcino in the later half of the 19th century. In the 1980s, it was the first wine to earn the DOCG classification. Today there are about two hundred growers in the Montalcino region producing about 333,000 cases of Brunello di Montalcino a year. Brunello di Montalcino wines are required to be aged for at least four years prior to being released, with riserva wines needing five years. Brunellos tend to be very tight and tannic in their youth, needing at least a decade or two before they start to soften with wines from excellent vintages having the potential to do well past 50 years. In 1984, the Montalcino region was granted the DOC designation of Rosso di Montalcino. Often called \\"Baby Brunellos\\", these wines are typically made from the same grapes, vineyards and style as the regular Brunello di Montalcino but are not aged as long. While similar to Brunellos in flavor and aromas, these wines are often lighter in body and more approachable in their youth. Carmignano Carmignano was the first Tuscan DOCG to sanction the use of blending Cabernet Sauvignon (pictured) with Sangiovese. The Carmignano region was one of the first Tuscan regions to be permitted to use Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc in their DOC wines since those varieties had a long history of being grown in the region. Noted for the quality of its wines since the Middle Ages, Carmignano was identified by Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany as one of the superior wine producing areas of Tuscany and granted special legal protections in 1716. In the 18th century, the producers of the Carmignano region developed a tradition of blending Sangiovese with Cabernet Sauvignon, long before the practice became popularized by the \\"Super Tuscan\\" of the late 20th century.K. MacNeil The Wine Bible pg 376, 386-387 Workman Publishing 2001 In 1975, the region was awarded Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) status and subsequently promoted to Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) status in 1990 (retroactive to the 1988 vintage). Today Carmignano has approximately planted, producing nearly of DOCG designated wine a year.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 140 Oxford University Press 2006 Chianti A glass of Chianti. Located in the central region of Tuscany, the Chianti zone is Tuscany's largest classified wine region and produces over eight million cases a year. In addition to producing the well known red Chianti wine, the Chianti zone also produces white, other Rosso reds and Vin Santo. The region is split into two DOCG- Chianti and Chianti Classico. The Chianti Classico zone covers the area between Florence and Siena, which is the original Chianti region, and where some of the best expressions of Chianti wine are produced. The larger Chianti DOCG zone is further divided in six DOC sub-zones and areas in the western part of the province of Pisa, the Florentine hills north of Chianti Classico in the province of Florence, the Siena hills south of the city in the province of Siena, the province of Arezzo and the area around the communes of Rufina and Pistoia.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 147-155 Hungry Minds 2001 Since 1996, Chianti is permitted to include as little as 75% Sangiovese, a maximum of 10% Canaiolo, up to 10% of the white wine grapes Malvasia and Trebbiano and up to 15% of any other red wine grape grown in the region, such as Cabernet Sauvignon. This variety of grapes and usage is one reason why Chianti can vary widely from producer to producer. The use of white grapes in the blend could alter the style of Chianti by softening the wines with a higher percentage of white grapes, typically indicating that the wine is meant to be drunk younger and not aged for long. In general, Chianti Classicos are described as medium-bodied wines with firm, dry tannins. The characteristic aroma is cherry but it can also carry nutty and floral notes as well. In 2006, the use of white grapes Trebbiano and Malvasia was prohibited (except in Chianti Colli Senesi until the 2015 vintage). Local laws also require wines to have a minimum of 70% Sangiovese (and 80% for the more prestigious Chianti Classico DOCG). The native varieties Canaiolo and Colorino are also permitted, as are the international classics, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, to a limited degree.wine-searcher.com The Chianti Classico region covers approximately and includes the communes of Castellina, Gaiole, Greve and Radda and Panzano, as well as parts of four other neighboring communes. The terroir of the Classico zone varies throughout the region depending on the vineyards' altitude, soil type and distance from the Arno River. The soils of the northern communes, such as Greve, are richer in clay deposits while those in the southern communes, like Gaiole, are harder and stonier. Riserva Chianti is aged for at least 27 months, some of it in oak, and must have a minimum alcohol content of 12.5%. Wines from the Chianti DOCG can carry the name of one of the six sub-zones or just the Chianti designation. The Chianti Superiore designation refers to wines produced in the provinces of Florence and Siena but not in the Classico zone. Bolgheri The Super Tuscan wine Sassicaia from the Bolgheri region. The DOC Bolgheri region of the Livorno province is home to one of the original Super Tuscan wines Sassicaia, first made in 1944 produced by the marchesi Incisa della Rochetta, cousin of the Antinori family. The DOC Bolgheri region is also home to the Super Tuscan wine Ornellaia which was featured in the film Mondovino as well as Tignanello from Marchesi Antinori. Vernaccia di San Gimignano Vineyards in San Gimignano Vernaccia di San Gimignano is a white wine made from the Vernaccia grape in the areas around San Gimignano. In 1966, it was the first wine to receive a DOC designation. This wine style has been made in the area for over seven centuries and is considered Tuscany's best and most characterful white wine. The wine is dry and full-bodied with earthy notes of honey and minerals. In some styles it can be made to emphasize the fruit more and some producers have experimented with aging or fermenting the wine in oak barrels in order to give the wine a sense of creaminess or toastiness. Vino Nobile di Montepulciano A Vino Nobile di Montepulciano. The Vino Nobile di Montepulciano received its DOCG status shortly after Brunello di Montalcino, in 1980. The DOCG covers the red wine of the Montepulciano area. The wine received its name in the 17th century, when it was the favorite wine of the Tuscan nobility. Located in the southeastern region of Tuscany, the climate of the region is strongly influenced by the sea. The variety of Sangiovese in Montepulciano is known as Prugnolo Gentile and is required to account for at least 80% of the wine. Traditionally Canaiolo and Mammolo make up the remaining part of the blend but some producers have begun to experiment with Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 164-174 Hungry Minds 2001 The wines are required to age two years prior to release, with an additional year if it is to be a riserva. The recent use of French oak barrels has increased the body and intensity of the wines which are noted for their plummy fruit, almond notes and smooth tannins. The origin of Valdichiana wines In Etruscan times, Valdichiana, an area which presently stretches along the Southeastern part of Tuscany up to the Florence-Rome road ramification, was called the \\"Breadbasket of Etruria\\". However, its hills were already dotted with vineyards. Later on, Plinius the Elder would describe the quality of these wines as follows: Talpone (red) and Ethesiaca (white). This was a vine growing culture spreading over the hills of the Tuscan part of Valdichiana surrounding the important commercial centres of Foiano della Chiana, Lucignano, Cortona, Montepulciano and Arezzo. The importance given to this economical activity was confirmed in the following years in successive stages in the writings of the Bishopric of Arezzo. \\"Valdichiana Champagne\\". During the 1800s, the merchants of Bourgogne and Champagne decided to use the wines of Tuscan Valdichiana due to their renowned quality as a base for their champagnes after the phylloxera or vine-pest had destroyed their vineyards. The wine making tradition was enriched and endorsed in the late 1960s and early 1970s with the DOC guarantee of origin recognition thanks to the effort of few noble families such as Della Stufa (Castello del Calcione, Lucignano) and Mancini Griffoli (Fattoria Santa Vittoria, Pozzo della Chiana). The first policy document of 1972 only protected the denomination of the “Virgin White Valdichiana” type. Later, the policy document was modified and enriched to include the entire selection of wines produced in the Tuscan Valdichiana. In 1989, the DOC guarantee of origin was extended to the sparkling and spumante types. In 1993, output was lowered and modified. Later, in 1999, a production policy was put in action for white berry types (chardonnay and grechetto), red berry types (red, rosato, sangiovese), and Vin Santo, thus fulfilling the aspirations of the producers after more than thirty years. In 1999, the DOC guarantee of origin also varied the name “Valdichiana” and in 2011 with DM 22/11/11, the \\"Tuscan Valdichiana\\" denomination was further varied with the aim of giving the exact perception that the wine produced there comes from the part of the Valdichiana that is situated in the Tuscan region in the provinces of Arezzo and Siena, thus allowing the plan of promotion to strengthen the fundamental, unique, strong, and essential bond with its territory. Other Tuscan wines The Pomino region near Ruffina has been historically known for the prevalence of the French wine grape varieties, making wines from both Cabernets as well as Chardonnay, Merlot, Pinot blanc, Pinot grigio in addition to the local Italian varieties. The Frescobaldi family is one of the area's most prominent wine producers. In southern Tuscany, towards the region of Latium, is the area of Maremma which has its own IGT designation Maremma Toscana. Maremma is also home to Tuscany's newest DOCG, Morellino di Scansano, which makes a fragrant, dry Sangiovese based wine. The province of Grosseto is one of Tuscany's emerging wine regions with eight DOC designations, half of which were created in the late 1990s. It includes the Monteregio di Massa Marittima region which has been recently the recipient of foreign investment in the area's wine, especially by \\"flying winemakers\\". The Parrina region is known for its white wine blend of Trebbiano and Ansonica. The wine Bianco di Pitigliano is known for its eclectic mix of white wine grapes in the blend including Chardonnay, the Greco sub variety of Trebbiano, Grechetto, Malvasia, Pinot blanc, Verdello and Welschriesling. In Maremma, a hidden gem with many wineries, is Poggio Argentiera winery which makes Morellino di Scansano and other wines. The wines of Montecarlo region include several varieties that are not commonly found in Tuscan wines including Sémillon and Roussanne. The minor Chianti grape Ciliegiolo is also popular here. The island of Elba has one of the longest winemaking histories in Tuscany and is home to its own DOC. Some of the wines produced here include a sparkling Trebbiano wine, a sweet Ansonica passito, and a semi-sweet dessert wine from Aleatico.

It existed as the Diocese of Modena in central Italy from the 4th century.Vedriani, p. 13. Ughelli, p. 75, points out that there is no reference to a bishop or a diocese before 339. Lanzoni, p. 791. Originally it was a suffragan (subject to) the diocese of Milan, but later became a suffragan of Ravenna. Because of the schism of the Antipope Clement III, Pope Paschal II released Modena from obedience to the church of Ravenna, but Pope Gelasius II restored the previous status.Kehr, p. 299. Modena continued as a suffragan of Ravenna until 1582, when the Archdiocese of Bologna was created by Pope Sixtus V in the Bull Universi orbis of 1 December 1582, and was assigned Modena as one of its suffragans.The suffragans of Bologna were: Piacenza, Parma, Reggio, Modena, Imola, Cervia, and Crema. Kehr, Italia pontificia V, p. 299. In 1820 the diocese of Modena incorporated the territory of Nonantola Abbey. Modena was raised to the status of an archdiocese and its bishop to the status of a Metropolitan Archbishop by Pope Pius IX in his bull of 22 August 1855, entitled Vel ab antiquis.Cappelletti, pp. 298-308. The archdiocese took the current form of its name in 1986. Its suffragans are the Diocese of Carpi, Diocese of Fidenza, Diocese of Parma, Diocese of Piacenza-Bobbio, and Diocese of Reggio Emilia-Guastalla. History On 7 July 1148, in a synod held at Cremona, Pope Eugene III condemned the city of Modena and divided its territory among four neighboring bishoprics, so that the bishop of Modena was left being a bishop nullius dioecesis. It is known, from a decree of 8 April 1149, that he assigned ten parishes of Modena to the diocese of Reggio.Tiraboschi, Memorie III, p. 21. Concerning the restitution of the diocese, perhaps by Pope Eugenius, perhaps by Pope Adrian IV, there is no information. Cardinal Hildebrandus Crassus was named Rector et Procurator Ecclesiae Mutinensis, and he subscribed documents with that title from 1150 up until 1155.Tiraboschi, Storia...di Nonantola (1784), p. 40.

In 1231 Pope Gregory IX had to order the monastery of S. Peter in Modena to submit to the rule of the bishop of Modena, rejecting their argument that Pope Eugene's release from subjection to the bishop had had a permanent effect, and that the monstery was still in 1231 immediately subject to the Holy See (Papacy).Tiraboschi, Memorie III, p. 182; IV, pp. 105-106. During the episcopacy of Bishop Giovanni Morone (1529–1550; 1564–1571), both the Jesuit Order and the Capuchin Order were introduced into the diocese of Modena. In 1535 he served as papal Nuncio to the King of France, and, from 1536 to 1542, with brief interruptions, Morone was papal Nuntius to the King of Bohemia, Ferdinand, King of the Romans.Ughelli, p. 136. Ludwig Pastor, The history of the popes : from the close of the Middle Ages Volume XI (London: Kegan Paul 1912) pp. 206-207. At the end of 1540, he wrote to Cardinal Farnese, expressing his anxiety about the diocese of Modena, which he considered to be worse than Prague in terms of dubious religious discussions. For his diplomatic work, he received the red hat of the cardinalate on 2 June 1542. On 16 October he was named Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church.Eubel, III, p. 27 no. 40. He was then appointed one of the presidents of the Council of Trent, which his work in Germany did much to make possible. In 1796, Modena and Nonantola became part of the empire of the French Republic, expanding under the military leadership of General Napoleon Bonaparte. The monastery and the diocese of Nonantola were suppressed.Abbazia di Nonantola, Basilica abbaziale, L' abbazia nei secoli: cronologia essenziale, retrieved: 5 November 2018. On 11 December 1821, Pope Pius VII confirmed in the bull Sacrorum canonum the rearrangements of the dioceses in the Duchy of Modena which had been worked out by the Sacred Consistorial Congregation. These adjustments had been made necessary by the intrusive enactments made by the occupying French governments of the Cisalpine Republic and the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Modena, which had been made a suffragan of Milan, was returned to the ecclesiastical province of Bologna, and its acquisition of the territorial Abbey of Nantola was confirmed. Cathedral and Chapter The fabric of the cathedral was erected during the 11th century. The high altar, dedicated to S. Geminianus, was consecrated by Pope Paschal II, in the presence of Countess Matilda of Tuscany, on 8 October 1106. The remains of S. Geminianus had already been transferred to the new basilica in a ceremony presided over by the Pope and the Countess on 30 April 1106.Ughelli, II, p. 116. Cappelletti, p. 251. Kehr, V, p. 310, no. 1. In 1184, Pope Lucius III visited Modena, accompanied by ten cardinals, the Archbishops of Ravenna and Lyons, and the Bishops of Reggio and Bologna. On 12 July 1184, he presided over the consecration of the newly refurbished Cathedral.Cappelletti, pp. 260-262. Canons were already in existence at Modena by 892. A document of the Emperor Guido (891–894), dated November 892, speaks of granting Bishop Leudoinus powers for building ramparts ad muniendam ipsam sanctam Ecclesiam suamque constitutam Canonicam.'... for fortifying the Cathedral itself and its Canonica'. Tiraboschi, Memorie ... Modenesi III, Codex diplomaticus, pp. 66-68. Boschi, p. 92. Bishop Varinus (c. 1003 – after 1120) had been Primicerius of the Cathedral Chapter before being elected bishop. Bishop Martinus (1207–1221) had been Provost of the Cathedral Chapter when he was elected bishop. Bishop Alberto Boschetti (1234–1264) had been Magister scholae (cantorum) when elected bishop. Bonincontro da Floriano (1313 ? – 1318) had been Archpriest of the Cathedral when elected.Borghi, p. 97-98. On 9 May 1177, Pope Alexander III ratified the agreement reached by the Chapter, that they would not have more than fourteen Canons. On 30 May 1177, Pope Alexander ratified another decision of the Chapter, not to allow Canons who lived outside the Canonicate to hold prebends.Tiraboschi, Memorie III, Codice diplomatico, p. 70, no. 483. Kehr, p. 310, nos. 6, 7. Cappelletti, p. 318, interprets the words extra morantium, nisi forte in scolis fuerit to mean 'residing outside the city'. In 1679, the Cathedral Chapter was composed of nine dignities and twelve Canons. In 1745 there were twelve dignities and twelve Canons.Ritzler-Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 277 note 1; VI, p. 298 note 1. From 1855, the Chapter has been composed of one dignity, the Archpriest, and twelve Canons.Cappelletti, p. 313. Synods A diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See. Bishop Guido de Baisio (1318–1334) held a diocesan synod on 5–6 May 1320.Sillingardi, p. 110. Bishop Nicolò Sandonnini (1465–1479) held a diocesan synod in Modena in 1479.Tiraboschi, Storia... Nonantola I, p. 50. During the episcopate of Cardinal Ercole Rangoni (1520–1527), a synod was held by his Vicar General, Giandomenico Sigibaldi in 1521. A diocesan synod was held in Modena on 4–5 September 1565 during the Administratorship of Cardinal Giovanni Morone (1564–1571), in accordance with the decrees of the Council of Trent. Morone was particularly eager to have the laity attend the synod, so that they could be better informed about the decrees of the Council.Giuseppe Russo, \\"Il primo Sinodo modenese dopo il Concilio di Trento,\\" Atti e memorie della deputatione di storia patria per le antiche provincie modenese 10 (1968), pp. 117-124. The Constitutions of the synod of Modena were also published. Bishop Sisto Visdomini (1571–1590) presided over a diocesan synod on 23 September 1572, and again on 25 October 1575. A synod was held by Bishop Gaspare Sillingardi (1593–1607) on 15 June 1594. Bishop Pellegrino Bertacchi (1610–1627) presided over a diocesan synod held in Modena on 23 May 1612. He also held synods on 21 May 1615, in 1617 and in 1624. His immediate successor, Bishop Alessandro Rangoni (1628–1640) held diocesan synods on 5–6 November 1631,Constitutiones et decreta in diocesana synodo Mutinae, habita anno 1631, die 5 & 6 novembris, iterum ab ilustrissimo & reverendissimo praesule d.d.

There were synods in 1726 and 1739 under Bishop Stefano Fogliani (1717–1742). A synod of the independent territorial abbey of Nonantola was held at Nonantola on 8 September 1688, under the authority of Cardinal Giacomo de Angelis.

It also appears on their 1973 live album. The lyrics were written by lead singer Peter Gabriel.  Overview  The song takes the form of a futuristic play set initially in the present but ending in 2012. Like \\"Harold the Barrel\\" and \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\" from their previous album Nursery Cryme, the song's lyrics are split between different characters, with lead singer Peter Gabriel often adapting a different vocal style to each character. The song uses elements of reality and science fiction as a means of social criticism on the corporate greed and oppression of the UK's private landlords in the 1960s and 1970s, epitomised by Peter Rachman who used \\"winkling\\" (a mixture of threats and inducements) to remove tenants on low rents from properties and enable their profitable reletting or redevelopment. Social commentary was an evident theme throughout Genesis's early work, especially in their following album, Selling England by the Pound (1973).  Plot  The play contains three main characters: * John Pebble: A business man of Styx Enterprises. Near the end of the song, he has been knighted and works for United Blacksprings International. * Mark Hall (also known as \\"The Winkler\\"): A man who works for Styx Enterprises and has the task of evicting tenants. * Mrs Barrow: a tenant in a house in Harlow,Mr Hall: [to Mrs Barrow] Here we are in Harlow New Town, did you recognise your block across the square, over there? purchased by Pebble. The song starts with a fast-paced refrain of Pebble ordering Hall to \\"Get 'em out by Friday\\". In the following verse, the Winkler tells a disbelieving Mrs Barrow that a firm of men has purchased her property and that she has been evicted. She refuses to leave, so Pebble raises the rent on the property. In lieu of this, the Winkler offers £400 for Mrs Barrow to move; she does, albeit grudgingly. Shortly after Mrs Barrow moves in, however, Pebble again raises the rent. A slow instrumental indicates a passage of time, taking the story to the year 2012. At this time, Genetic Control has announced that they are restricting the height of all humans to four feet. This piece of news is then discussed in a pub by a man named \\"Joe Everybody,\\" who reveals the reason behind the restriction: so that Genetic Control, who has recently bought some properties, will be able to accommodate twice as many people in the same tower block. The penultimate verse is that of Pebble, now knighted, repeating the process for another set of properties.

Reception  Both the song and its accompanying album were generally well- received; Rutherford commented that the lyrics were the best that Gabriel had written while AllMusic cited the song as \\"the truest sign Genesis has grown muscle without abandoning the whimsy\\".

This was the first American military anti-aircraft vehicleHunnicutt, p. 10 Colonel Davidson's 1909 semi-armored Cadillac. The Colt machine guns have been fitted with high angle mounts for use as a balloon destroyer. No doubt, this was the first American anti-aircraft vehicle. Colonel Davidson was definitely ahead of his time. The Davidson-Cadillac armored car of 1915 was developed on a Cadillac chassis by Royal Page Davidson and the cadets of the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in Highland Park, Illinois. This military vehicle is the first true fully armored vehicle made in the United StatesChilton, p. 416 This car has the distinction of being the first true armored car built in the United States. because it was built specifically just for that purpose and was not a conversion of an automobile or truck.  Description  The Davidson car was armor clad around the entire vehicle. It had radiator doors that would open for access and the rear part had an open top, where a machine gun was mounted just behind the driver.  History  Royal P. Davidson in 1915 commanded a special fleet of eight military vehicles on a convoy from Chicago to San Francisco to evaluate their performance.Hunnicutt, p. 10 The vehicles he designed for military use were built by Cadillac. The column included a reconnaissance scout vehicle with instruments for observation, two wireless radio communications vehicles, field cooking vehicle complete with fireless cookers, a hospital vehicle with operating tables and an X-ray machine, a balloon destroyer, a quartermaster's car and the first fully armored military vehicle. War Department personnel representing the government went with the convoy to give reports on the performance of the vehicles.Willcox, p. 40 Some of the vehicles had rapid fire machine-guns and searchlights. Five were eight-cylinder vehicles. The Davidson-Cadillac fully armored military vehicle was capable of 70 mph when the roads allowed. It was America's first military fully armored vehicle. The reconnaissance scout vehicle was equipped with military rifles, map tables, instruments for making maps on the spot, a dictating machine, instruments for observation for seeing behind walls, altitude indicators, and range and elevation finders. The radio wireless communication vehicles came with telescope masts mounted on the running board. They came with generators to generate the normal current of 110 volts. One of these radio vehicles came with a rapid fire Colt automatic machine gun. It also had a powerful electric searchlight with a heliograph shutter. The vehicles with the field kitchen and hospital were mounted on an eight-cylinder chassis of a 145-inch wheelbase. Cooking was done using an electric cooker that did not produce any visible fire. The armored vehicle came with bullet-proof steel. It had loopholes for firing out with rifles. It also had a rapid fire Colt automatic machine gun. It came with winch equipment so it could be pulled out of mud. The balloon destroyer vehicle came with a machine gun making it the first American anti- aircraft vehicle.New York Times - July 18, 1915 - \\"This Armored Motor Car is now touring across the continent.\\" Davidson had these military vehicles built to convince the government that a mechanized army was the way to go. Davidson and some of his school cadets drove the fully armored vehicle along with seven other support vehicles for 34 days from the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy in the Chicago area to the Panama Pacific Exposition being held in San Francisco in 1915. The first military convoy across the country received much publicity from many newspapers nationwide. The military vehicles were shipped back by train to the Academy in Highland Park when the exposition was over instead of being driven back, since Davidson achieved his goal of demonstrating to the United States Army and the government that a mechanized army was the technology of the future. Davidson's Automobile Corps convoy of the 8 specially designed military vehicles were driven by the cadets of the Northwestern Military Academy as an escort for the Liberty Bell to the Panama Pacific Exposition on the Lincoln Highway in 1915. This was the last time the Liberty Bell traveled from its home for any exposition.

Griffin (born August 15, 1950)Whitburn, Joel. Top R&B; Singles 1942-1999. Record Research Incorporated, 2000, p.176 is an American singer and songwriter. He is best known for replacing Smokey Robinson as lead singer of The Miracles in 1972.  Biography  Griffin was born and raised in West Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Garrison Junior High School and Forest Park High School. He, like his brother Donald Griffin (1955–2015), (who later replaced Marv Tarplin in the Miracles), was a guitarist, as well as a singer, and sang with a local Baltimore group called The Last Dynasty. Damon Harris, who later went on to fame as a member of The Temptations, was a high school friend and group member in another local group, the Young Tempts (later renamed as The Young Vandals). Griffin idolized Miracles lead singer Smokey Robinson, while Harris idolized Temptation Eddie Kendricks. Both of them wound up as replacements for their idols in their respective groups. Griffin and three friends formed the group Last Dynasty and won a talent program on NBC Television. \\"It was like a pre-American Idol thing. My group won. We sang \`Friendship Train' by Gladys Knight and the Pips,\\" Griffin said. The Last Dynasty won a record deal from RCA as first prize, but never took it. The next week, Griffin was in Detroit, auditioning for Berry Gordy and the Motown executives. He was the 60th guy they brought in to audition to replace Smokey Robinson - and Griffin got the job. During The Miracles' nationwide 1972 Farewell Tour with Smokey Robinson, Griffin was introduced by Robinson as his replacement in The Miracles as lead singer. After a year of woodshedding with Motown's famous Artist Development Dept., Griffin released his first single with The Miracles, \\"What Is A Heart Good For\\", from their first post-Robinson album, Renaissance in 1973. Griffin sang this song on his first national television appearance as a Miracle with the remaining group members of The Miracles, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, and Pete Moore on another NBC music program, The Midnight Special, in 1973, hosted by Robinson. The single was withdrawn and replaced with a ballad, \\"Don't Let It End (Till You Let It Begin)\\", which was a mild hit. After a second single, \\"Give Me Just Another Day\\", was released later that year, Under the management of Martin Pichinson, The Miracles released \\"Do It Baby\\" in 1974, which peaked at #4 on the Billboard R&B; charts and became the group's first bona-fide hit with Griffin. Like Robinson before him, Griffin co-wrote many of the Miracles' songs, in addition to singing lead. Griffin and original Miracles member Pete Moore wrote all of the Miracles' 1975 platinum sellingGblev.com album, City of Angels. During his tenure with the group, they recorded three hits: \\"Do It Baby\\" in 1974, and the Miracles' most successful single, the number-one hit \\"Love Machine\\", in 1975 which sold 4.5 million records worldwide. Griffin also sung lead on \\"Don't Cha Love It\\", a Top 10 R&B; #4 single. The Miracles left Motown in 1976, signing with Columbia Records. After two albums for Columbia, Griffin and Moore decided to retire from performing and focus on songwriting. In 1982, Griffin released his first solo album, Be With Me, which yielded the UK Singles Chart Top 20 hit \\"Hold Me Tighter in the Rain\\". The following year, Respect yielded the club hit, \\"Serious\\" which peaked at #64 in the UK chart. After a third album with Leon Ware, Griffin switched record label to Atlantic Records but despite completing an album, only one single \\"Believe It or Not\\" was released there before he was left without a recording contract. In 1989, Griffin joined UK record producer Ian Levine's Motown-reunion project Motorcity Records, and was the first to release a single on the label, \\"First in Line\\". Griiffin also fronted a Miracles reunion with a new recording of \\"Love Machine\\". Griffin became a writer and backing vocals arranger for several of the other artists, and recordes a large number of tracks himself, but his album Technicolour was never released and the label collapsed in 1992. Most of his Motorcity recordings were released on the 1996 compilation Best Of Billy Griffin. Levine and Griffin also landed a couple of hit singles for the UK soul band The Pasadenas and co-produced Take That's debut album, which including the hit singles \\"Could It Be Magic\\" (UK #3) and \\"I Found Heaven\\" (UK #15). They also worked with Levine's boy band, Bad Boys Inc.

Zhyrovichy monastery  History   Legend  One night around 1500 (storytellers and scholars disagree on the year), some herders noticed a wild pear tree radiating light, whose source in the branches turned out to be a jasper oval, about the size of a child's hand, carved with the image of a woman and child and the Slavonic inscription, «More honorable than the cherubim, And more glorious beyond compare than the seraphim, In virginity you bore God the Word; True Mother of God, we magnify you». The portrait was recognizable as an Eleousa or Tenderness type of icon, with the child's cheek against his mother's, and the words as the refrain of the Magnificat in the Eastern liturgy.  History  The monastery was founded in the 16th century. Due to a belief, an icon of Virgin Mary was found in the local woods. A church was built on the place where the icon was found, but soon it was burned by fire and the icon was lost. Many years later the icon was found again with mysterious imprints on it – presumably those of Virgin Mary’s palm and foot. The icon is considered miraculous and the stone became part of the altar in the church of Exaltation of the Cross. Since then the Zhyrovichy monastery is a major place of pilgrimage in Belarus. Mother of God of Zhyrovichy (XV st., oval icon on jasper) Until 1609 the monastery was Orthodox. Then the monastery was transferred to the Uniate order of Basilian. The original buildings of the monastery were wooden. A major fire occurred in the monastery in 1655. After that the monastery rebuilt already largely made of stone. At the monastery in Zhyrovichy has three temples. Firstly, it is the center and the main temple of the monastery - the Holy Assumption Cathedral, which was built in 1613-1650 years. The cathedral was significantly rebuilt in 1839, so its appearance is not too well reflects its age. The second temple in Zhyrovichy is the church of God Apparitions, built in 1796. The third temple is the church of the Holy Cross, built in 1769. This church is very unique. The fact that it is designed so that the entrance and to the altar lying wide staircase. In this temple made to slowly climb the stairs, stopping at each step to pray. All the temples and churches of the monastery in Zhyrovichy are important architectural monuments of his time, valuable objects of historical and cultural heritage, and prominent landmarks. Napoleon Orda. Zhyrovichy. 14.03.1865 The complex of buildings of the monastery in Zhyrovichy includes many more facilities which were mostly built in the 17-18 centuries. Among these buildings there seminary building, residential housing for the monks and seminarians, outbuildings and more. Outside the main territory of the monastery in the village Zhyrovichy located a few objects that although there are separate yet related to the monastery. First of all, it is the bell tower, built in 1828 in front of the main cathedral of the monastery. The bell tower in the village Zhyrovichy be performed under the church and the monastery, it is more not only like a bell tower as another separate temple. Belfry made on such a scale is a very unique attraction of Belarus. In Zhyrovichy there are two saints source. A copy of the stone image was brought to Rome, where it is revered as the Madonna del Popolo in the Church of Sts. Sergio and Bacchus. In 1730, Athanasius Sheptitsky, Greek Catholic Metropolitan of Kiev and Galicia, solemnly crowned the Mother of God of Zhyrovichy with a Roman crown blessed by Pope Benedict XIII. Being in the hands of uniats, the sacred image was deeply celebrated by both uniats and catholics. A great reverence to this icon was shown by the kings of Poland. In the 1839, the monastery returned to Orthodoxy. In 1915, the icon was moved to the crypt of St. Basil’s Cathedral on Red Square in Moscow. Smuggled out of the Soviet Union in a shipment of jam, it returned to the Grodno diocese in 1938, missing most of its ornaments. Nowadays the icon is kept in the cathedral of the Holy Blessed Virgin's Assumption, in the monastery of Zhirovichy.  Practices  The Belarusian Greek Catholic Church and Roman Catholic Church in Belarus celebrate the feast of the Mother of God of Zhyrovichy on May 7. Russian and Belarusian Orthodox Churches celebrate the feast of the Mother of God of Zhyrovichy on May 20 (May 7 in the Julian calendar). The Saint Ascension monastery in Zhyrovichy existed even during Soviet times and in 1989 it became a clerical seminary – a highest religious educational institution, accepting entrants from all the countries of the former USSR.

Having visited his first distillery, Talisker in 1975 it is believed that he has since visited more distilleries globally than any person.The Odd Whisky Coy - \\"So Right, Odd & Original\\" He had used his secondments to Scotland in the early and mid-1980s to visit as many distilleries as possible and even work in them during his free time. 1994 saw the release of Jim Murray's Irish Whiskey Almanac, the first of many popular whisky books that he would go on to write in securing his place as possibly the world's leading authority.Drinks Media Wire - Alberta Premium Awarded World-Class Distinction This book was revised and extended for a re-release three years later as Classic Irish Whiskey (1997). Other publications include Jim Murray's Complete Book of Whisky (1997), Classic Bourbon, Tennessee & Rye (1998), Classic Blended Scotch (1999) and The Art of Whisky (1998). Murray won the Glenfiddich Whisky Writer of the Year award three times. Murray is quoted as saying that he fiercely guards his independence and honesty. He says that he believes this can be compromised by writing for advertising-dependent media. His recent magazine writings have been selective and only on the understanding that he retains full copyright. To further protect his writing, Murray has trademarked his name. Jim Murray's Whisky Bible is an ongoing project, with the first of the series having been published in 2003. It is a compact guide containing every whisky that Murray and a team of researchers are able to source from the worldwide market. Each whisky is tasted by Murray alone and graded out of an overall score of 100. This total is reflective of the four key criteria: nose, taste, finish and balance, each awarded marks out of 25. With every new edition of The Whisky Bible, Murray provides tasting notes and ratings for around 1,000 newly released or previously obscure whiskies, with nearly 4,000 brands being reviewed overall. As well as writing and broadcasting on whisky, and being a chair judge at the International Wine and Spirit Competition, Murray has also worked as a consultant blender with both whisky and rum. He claims one of his achievements includes playing a major role in resurrecting Ardbeg distillery in Islay after it closed in 1996. Murray has also become well known for his championing the cause of American whiskey and Canadian rye whisky, Japanese whisky, and Irish single pot still whiskey, all of which had fallen out fashion when he first began writing about them. In late 2020, after claims were made that Murray's whisky reviews include sexist language, a distiller and a retailer sought to distance themselves from him. The Scotch Whisky Association characterized Mr. Murray’s language as “offensive.” Murray denied that his reviews were sexist, stating \\"It is to do with sensuality. All foods and drinks are sensual.\\" Murray lives in Northamptonshire, England, and also has a home near Frankfort, Kentucky, United States, in the heart of the bourbon-making region.

Only the first domino should be toppled by hand. Using dominoes of different colors, the builders are able to create patterns and images. The dominoes can have different top and back colours, meaning that the dominoes display different colours before and after being toppled. Other tricks include three-dimensional stackings; shapes such as spirals and letters; Rube Goldberg machines; special toppling techniques, and special effects. The first public domino shows were those of Bob Speca, Jr. from Broomall, Pennsylvania, US. In 1976, at the age of 18, he established the first official world record for the most dominos toppled in a chain reaction, by setting up and toppling down 11,111 pieces.Speca, R. (2004): Championship Domino Toppling Book, Sterling Publishing. That event, and his appearance on The Tonight ShowBob Speca on The Tonight Show triggered a domino-toppling craze, leading to a long lasting competition among domino- builders about the world record. In 1984, Klaus Friedrich from Germany was the last person to set up a new domino-toppling world record single-handedly. List of domino-toppling world record holders In that same year student film makers Sheri Herman and Bonnie Cutler from Temple University produced and directed a film entitled AND THEY ALL FALL DOWN, showcasing Bob Speca's talents. The film is part of the permanent collection of the Berlin Film Museum. In 1998, the Netherlands hosted a huge domino toppling exhibition called Domino D-Day, it was renamed Domino Day, following the initial 1998 event. It ran annually until 2009, and has been suspended due to financial and administrative issues since 2010. Domino Day made popular the concept of the \\"Builder's Challenge\\" where in the build team must place dominoes into the project once the topple has already begun in order to complete the build in a \\"race against the clock\\" type challenge. Since 2015, The Incredible Science Machine, an international, multi-team build event has been held annually in the USA, as of November 2017 they hold the current record for most dominoes toppled in America with just under 250,000.

Appointed in 1892, the year of their admission to the Football League, he oversaw the club winning the inaugural Football League Second Division championship, promotion to the First Division the following year, and two further promotions before his retirement in 1908. Jones worked as a manufacturer of scales. He began acting as unpaid secretary for Small Heath Alliance F.C. in 1885, the year they turned professional. That season they reached the semifinal of the FA Cup, which brought money into the club and broadened popular awareness of it. He supervised their entry into organised league football in the Football Alliance which started in 1889, and their subsequent invitation to join the newly formed Second Division of the Football League. It was at this point that Jones became the club's first paid secretary, and in addition took over responsibility for team affairs. In Jones's first season as secretary-manager Small Heath won the inaugural Second Division championship, though this did not bring automatic promotion; the club were unsuccessful in a test match against the bottom club in the First Division, Newton Heath. The following season the club were promoted via a test match victory over Darwen. Their stay in the top flight was brief, and with relegation came the loss of top players, falling attendances and consequent reduced income. Despite the financial difficulties the club found itself in, Jones was responsible for some excellent players joining. In his 13-year tenure as manager his team were promoted three times and relegated again three times. After the 1908 relegation, Jones was replaced as secretary-manager by Alex Watson, though he stayed at the club as part-time accountant until the First World War.

Life  Derrick was brought up in rural Berkshire by back-to-the-land parents and attended Douai School, where the headmaster, Dom Ignatius Rice, was a friend of his father. On a holiday in Hungary, not long after beginning his studies at the University of Oxford, Derrick was incapacitated by a severe intestinal infection and spent several years as an invalid.

Reid & Hanna  The general engineering firm of Reid & Hanna was founded in 1816 in Paisley, Scotland. Paisley had become an important industrial town in the late 18th century. By the mid-19th century weaving would become the town's principal industry. Of course the textile industry created opportunities for local machine factories and / or repair shops. Reid & Hanna might have been a company that just catered to the needs of the local textiles industry. Paisley was also a traditional center for shipbuilding. It is connected to the Clyde by the modest River Cart. When ships became too big for the River Cart, the local maritime industry adapted to building small vessels, specializing, or building \\"knock down\\" vessels. In July 1834 Reid & Hanna were reported to have finished a very beautiful sheet iron gig for use on the Paisley Canal, together with Walker firm. Two others were under construction for Dublin. In late 1834 the company launched a 70 feet boat with an unloaded draught of 6 inches, for trade on the canals. Due to the bends in the canal it could not be launched at Reid & Hanna's. The two parts were assembled and launched at Saucel wharf, also in Paisley.  Hanna & Donald  James Donald became a partner in the firm in 1851, and so the firm incorporated his name and became Hanna & Donald.  Hanna, Donald & Wilson  William Donald was a younger brother of James Donald, and built ships in the firm of Donald & MacFarlane, later Donald & Co in Glasgow. That business failed in 1868, and Hanna & Donald acquired their Atlas works in Paisley. The same year saw the company commence its shipbuilding operations along with the Abercorn Shipbuilding Co , Paisley. In 1870 the business changed its name to Hanna, Donald & Wilson, and moved its center of operations to the Abercorn Foundry and Abbey Works in Paisley. In the second half of the nineteenth century the company offered its services as gas and water engineers, iron founders and boiler makers. It supplied civil and mechanical engineering services to a wide range of European countries and countries in the British Empire or Commonwealth across the world as far afield as South East Asia, Canada and Australia.  Ships  Fervent class destroyer Operating from a landlocked site, the shipbuilding department of the company specialized in shallow draught boats for inland waters. Other vessels were delivered to customers in prefabricated sections and reassembled on site. Volharding Dock was a floating dry dock which had her hull finished in Scotland. She left for Java as a sailing ship on 21 July 1875, and arrived there after an epic journey of 341 days. Batavia Dock of was built in Scotland and re-assembled in the Dutch East Indies. She was launched there, but sank when she was lowered for a test, probably because of the lack of skill and experience in the riveting which was required to properly assemble such a structure. The company also built high speed naval vessels, including two s, for the Royal Navy and similar boats for the Greek Navy. The Fervent class destroyers would land the company in big trouble, because it was not able to give these the required speed.  Bridges  Albert bridge, Glasgow The company also built many bridges and similar structures. Examples of bridges built by the company are Albert Bridge, Glasgow, Abbey Bridge in its hometown Paisley, the pedestrian bridge at the former Strathbungo railway station (now in Glasgow), and a pedestrian bridge at Pitlochry railway station.  Roofing  Hanna, Donald & Wilson worked on many iron and steel roofs for railway stations and other large structures. Hanna built the Mavisbank shed in Glasgow Harbor, the roofs for the Elphinstone docks in Mumbai , and that of St Enoch Station in Glasgow. The glass roof of Waverley Station in Edinburgh was a special case. When it was built it spanned two areas. One was of 6,288 square yards, and the other of 6,840 square yards, which was immense for the time. At about the same time a nearby vegetable market was spanned by a roof of 393 feet by 150 feet. The glass roof of the station was later changed and extended. In 2010-2012, the surface was 34,000 m2 (370,000 sq ft). In these years the glazing of the station roof was entirely replaced with new strengthened clear glass panels.  Gasworks and Gas Services  The gas holder in Paisley The international character of the company especially applied to the construction of gasworks. For the Continental Union Gas Company Hanna built gas works in 13 cities, mainly in Italy. For the European Gas Company Hanna built in Le Havre, Rouen and Caen. For the Malta and Mediterranean Gas company in Valetta, Turpane, Corfu and Marsala. Hanna was also involved or built gasworks in Amsterdam, Bucharest, Kharkiv, Brisbane and Melbourne. In Britain the company did work for the Crystal Palace Gas Works Company, the Royal Arsenal at Woolwich, the Military College at Sandhurst, and some 50-60 other towns in the United Kingdom. In Scotland itself Hanna, Donald & Wilson was involved in Glasgow, Paisley, Greenock, Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Leith. For the Glasgow Gas Works Hanna built four gas holders of a capacity of 1.25 million cubic feet of gas. The Gasholder in its home town Paisley was also built by Hanna, and completed in 1890. The tank was built by James Goldie and Son of Glasgow. It had a 1,390,000 cubic feet capacity, and is held by 18 cast iron columns 75' 6\\" in height and 5' 0\\" at the base. The structure is now a listed building Paisley, Well Street, Gasholder. This was not the first gasometer in Paisley, because in 1853, the company had also opened such a work.  The end  When William Donald decided to pursue a career in medicine the company came to an end. The engineering and shipbuilding companies were wound up in the 1910s. The last asset, the Abercorn ship yard, was sold off in 1920. Notes  References   * Defunct shipbuilding companies of Scotland .

According to the official report, the crash was non- survivable. The Ajaccio-Nice Caravelle crash is the deadliest aviation incident in the Mediterranean Sea to date. The probable cause was attributed to a fire of uncertain origin which originated in the rear of the cabin. There were early speculations that the plane was hit by a surface-air missile, since there is a firing area not far from the crash site. Though the hypothesis was officially discarded by the inquiry board, many victims relatives still have doubts nowadays and ask to have access to classified documents about the event. Official report from French transport ministry In December 1972, the inquiry board of the French ministry of transportation published its official report. The report surmised that the loss of the aircraft had been caused by a fire in the passenger toilet caused either by a defective water heater or a cigarette discarded in a waste bin. This rejected the suggestion of any missile strike, basing its findings on the aircraft's survival time after the pilot's initial report to air traffic control of a fire on board, the examination of the wreckage recovered from the seabed, knowledge of a similar accidental fire in another Sud Aviation Caravelle and the declaration by the French defence ministry that there were no surface ships in the area capable of launching missiles. Among the dead was French general René Cogny.  Missile theory  On 10 May 2011, Michel Laty, a former army typist, alleged on French television channel TF1 that he saw a report indicating a missile, misfired by the French army during a weapon test, in fact caused the crash. A 2019 article in The Guardian newspaper reported that after the crash, documents and photographs about it disappeared. The 11 September page in the log book for Le Suffren, a French Navy missile frigate in the area, was torn out. The aircraft's black box flight recorder was said to have been damaged, with the recording of flight AF1611 unreadable, although earlier flights were recorded. Wreckage recovered was seized by France's military. An investigation was started in 2011 by gendarmes, and in September 2019 the theory that a fire had started in a toilet was disproved. A family member of one of those killed said \\"The investigating judge has said he is practically certain to almost 100% that the plane was hit by a missile. Now we are waiting\\". French president Emmanuel Macron wrote to a victim's family saying that he hoped the affair would be declassified, and that he had asked the armed forces minister to begin the process of releasing documents related to the crash.

The key feature of this algorithm is that the neighborhood relationships among neighboring objects in the feature space are used to constrain the memberships of neighboring objects in the fuzzy membership space. Description of the FLAME algorithm The FLAME algorithm is mainly divided into three steps: # Extraction of the structure information from the dataset: ## Construct a neighborhood graph to connect each object to its K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN); ## Estimate a density for each object based on its proximities to its KNN; ## Objects are classified into 3 types: ### Cluster Supporting Object (CSO): object with density higher than all its neighbors; ### Cluster Outliers: object with density lower than all its neighbors, and lower than a predefined threshold; ### the rest. # Local/Neighborhood approximation of fuzzy memberships: ## Initialization of fuzzy membership: ### Each CSO is assigned with fixed and full membership to itself to represent one cluster; ### All outliers are assigned with fixed and full membership to the outlier group; ### The rest are assigned with equal memberships to all clusters and the outlier group; ## Then the fuzzy memberships of all type 3 objects are updated by a converging iterative procedure called Local/Neighborhood Approximation of Fuzzy Memberships, in which the fuzzy membership of each object is updated by a linear combination of the fuzzy memberships of its nearest neighbors. # Cluster construction from fuzzy memberships in two possible ways: ## One-to-one object-cluster assignment, to assign each object to the cluster in which it has the highest membership; ## One-to-multiple object-clusters assignment, to assign each object to the cluster in which it has a membership higher than a threshold. The optimization problem in FLAME The Local/Neighborhood Approximation of Fuzzy Memberships is a procedure to minimize the Local/Neighborhood Approximation Error (LAE/NAE) defined as the following: :: E(\\\\\\\\{\\\\boldsymbol{p}\\\\\\\\})=\\\\sum_{\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\in\\\\boldsymbol{X}} \\\\bigg\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{p(x)}-\\\\sum_{ \\\\boldsymbol{y \\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(x)} } w_{\\\\boldsymbol{xy}} \\\\boldsymbol{p(y)} \\\\bigg\\\\^2 where \\\\boldsymbol{X} is the set of all type 3 objects, \\\\boldsymbol{p(x)} is the fuzzy membership vector of object \\\\boldsymbol{x}, \\\\mathcal{N}(x) is the set of nearest neighbors of \\\\boldsymbol{x}, and w_{\\\\boldsymbol{xy}} with \\\\sum_{\\\\boldsymbol{y\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(x)}}w_{\\\\boldsymbol{xy}}=1 are the coefficients reflecting the relative proximities of the nearest neighbors. The NAE can be minimized by solving the following linear equations with unique solution which is the unique global minimum of NAE with value zero: :: p_k(\\\\boldsymbol{x})-\\\\sum_{\\\\boldsymbol{y\\\\in \\\\mathcal{N}(x)}} w_{ \\\\boldsymbol{xy} } p_k(\\\\boldsymbol{y}) = 0, \\\\quad\\\\forall{\\\\boldsymbol{x}\\\\in \\\\boldsymbol{X} },\\\\quad k=1,...,M where M is the number of CSOs plus one (for the outlier group).

It is majority owned by Icelandic investment companies Horn Invest and The Enterprise Investment Fund. Promens' headquarters are in Kópavogur, Iceland. It has main business operations in Iceland and India. Promens operates 42 manufacturing in 19 countries, with 3800 employees, and total sales exceeding EUR 611 million in 2011. Promens traces its roots back to 1984 when a group of local investors in Dalvik, Iceland, established a company called Sæplast to manufacture insulated, double walled containers for the fishing and fish processing industries. After extensive adoption by the Icelandic fisheries industry, the company began exporting its products worldwide. In 1993, Sæplast won the President of Iceland's Export Award. The same year Sæplast was listed on the Icelandic Stock Exchange. During 1999-2000 Sæplast acquired three companies abroad; in 1999 the Dyno AS factories in Ålesund, Norway and St. John, Canada, and in 2000, Nordic Supplies Container AS of Norway. This expanded Sæplast's product range from rotationally molded tubs to include floats and safety equipment for the marine industries. As a result of these acquisitions, Sæplast's turnover increased by 400%, with 40% of the company's turnover now coming from the floats and safety equipment. During this time, the number of overseas employees reached three times the personnel in Iceland. In 2001 Sæplast Asia was established in Hong Kong. In 2002, Icebox Plastico, Spain was acquired by Sæplast, and in 2003 Plasti-Ned of the Netherlands was also acquired by Sæplast. Atorka Group of Iceland purchased a majority interest in Sæplast in 2004 and delisted the company from the ICEX. In 2004 the largest Icelandic company in the field of expandable polystyrene production, Tempra hf was acquired by Sæplast. In May 2005, Promens hf was formed to take over several of Sæplast's subsidiaries: Sæplast Dalvík ehf, and Tempra hf. in Iceland, Plasti-Ned BV and Sæplast Holland BV. in the Netherlands, Sæplast Iberia S.A. in Spain, Sæplast Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong and Sæplast UK Ltd., a 63% share in Sæplast India Ltd. Sæplast Ålesund AS., Sæplast Norge AS. and Sæplast Canada Inc. remained under Sæplast hf. In July 2005 the company acquired, the Bonar Plastics division from Low and Bonar Plc, adding eleven rotomolding plants in ten countries within Europe and in North America. Sixty-five percent of the sales of Bonar Plastics is derived from custom moulded products manufactured for other producers of industrial products. At the time of the acquisition Bonar Plastics produced parts for at least 15 industries and blue-chip customers include DaimlerChrysler, Caterpillar, John Deere, Peugeot, Renault and Volvo. At the time 35% of its sales were its own products, particularly tubs and tanks for storage and transportation of materials for the chemical, pharmaceutical and food industries.  Divisions  Promens Plastics division operates 11 rotomoulding factories in eight countries. The division’s factories are located in Dalvik in Iceland, Hockenheim in Germany, Deventer and Rijen in the Netherlands, Miedzyrzecz in Poland, Annezin, Bellignat, Blye, Geovreisset, L'Aigle, La Roche-sur-Foron and Montoir in France, Barcelona in Spain, Saint John in New Brunswick Canada, one plant in India and one plant in Taicang, China.

David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Diocese of Parma\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016. In 1892 the diocese absorbed the spiritualities of Fontevivo Abbey, a former territorial abbey. The Bishop of Parma has since also had the title of Abbot of Fontevivo. The bishop's seat is in Parma Cathedral. The diocese is a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Modena-Nonantola. Originally the diocese of Parma was in the ecclesiastical province of Milan, but it subsequently became a suffragan of the Archbishop of Ravenna. In 1106, Pope Paschal II removed Parma from the supervision of Ravenna, but in 1119 Pope Gelasius II restored the dioceses of Emilia to the jurisdiction of Ravenna. With the creation of the new archdiocese of Bologna in 1593, Parma became subject to Bologna. In 1875, the diocese of Parma became immediately subject to the Holy See (papacy).Kehr, p. 414. History At Easter 967, Bishop Uberto of Parma attended a council at Ravenna, presided over by Pope John XIII and the Emperor Otto I. The Council deposed Archbishop Herold of Salzburg for heresy. The Emperor confirmed the Pope in the possession of all of the territories of the Roman church, including the exarchate of Ravenna. The Pope raised the diocese of Magdeburg to the status of an archbishopric at the Emperor's request. He also confirmed the privileges of the Church of Ferrara.Allodi, I, p. 58. J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus decimus octavus (18) (Venice: A. Zatta 1773), pp. 499-506. Carl (Charles) Joseph Hefele, Histoire des conciles Tome sixième (Paris:Adrien le Clere 1871), pp. 204-205. In 987, Archbishop Honestus (Onesto) of Ravenna summoned a provincial synod, to meet in the village of Marzaglia, in the diocese of Parma. The bishops who attended included Giovanni of Imola, Gerardo of Faenza, Odone of Cesena, Ulberto of Bologna, Sigolfo of Piacenza, and Uberto of Parma. The assembly dealt with complaints made by the Bishop of Bologna against the Bishop of Parma, claiming that Bishop Uberto was holding properties close to Bologna which ought to belong to Bologna, which was a poor diocese and unable to staff all of its churches. Archbishop Onesto was able to effect a reconciliation through the mutual exchange of disputed properties.Allodi, I, p. 58. J. D. Mansi (ed.), Sacrorum Conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, editio novissima, Tomus decimus nonus (19) (Venice: A. Zatta 1774), pp. 41-42. In 1410 the plague struck Parma with especial virulence. It is claimed that one-quarter of the population died.Allodi, I, pp. 681-682. Apostolic Visitation In accordance with a bull of Pope Gregory XIII of 14 September 1578, Archbishop Giambattista Castelli of Rimini began an Apostolic Visitation of the diocese of Parma. His first investigation was of the Cathedral Chapter. His first painful discovery was that four of the priests whose duty it was to celebrate Mass in the Cathedral were not able to recite the prayer, Suscipiat Dominus from the Canon of the Mass for the Archbishop. Then the Archbishop turned to an inspection of the Canons of the Cathedral Chapter. He cited the decree of the Council of Trent de reformatione (chapter 12), approved in the 24th Session, which granted their daily stipend from the capitular treasury only to those who had attended at each of the canonical hours. The Canons replied that their custom, since the great plague of 1348 had produced a scarcity of clergy, required only the attendance at the daily Mass and at the Vespers on the eve of a great feast day. Touching as it did both on local tradition and the Canons' income, the Archbishop's ruling set off a legal firestorm.Allodi, II, pp. 98-105. Cappelletti, pp. 184-191. The Canons lodged an appeal in Rome with the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation of the Council, Cardinal Marcantonio Maffei, and sent the Archdeacon, Msgr. Cesare Picolello and Canon Francesco Ballestrieri, armed with a testimonial letter of the elders of the Commune of 9 January 1579, stating that the people of Parma were content with the celebration of the canonical hours in the Cathedral. Cardinal Alessandro Sforza was induced to speak with Cardinal Maffei, and the Congregation took up the appeal on 29 January 1579, in the presence of twelve cardinals, nine of whom voted in favor of the Canons of Parma, ruling that the Canons' service was not in violation of the decrees of the Council of Trent. The Pope was informed of the decision, and gave his approval.Allodi, II, pp. 101-102. In 1580, on the initiative of Duke Ottavio, the Jesuits were introduced into Parma, and given the church of San Benedetto, which had belonged to the abbey of S. Giovanni Evangelista. They continued to use the church until the reign of Pope Clement IX. They also acquired the Oratory of S. Rocco.Allodi, II, p. 105. By 1618, the Jesuits had a college for high school students, and one-third of the twenty-six professors at the University of Parma were Jesuits. Cathedral and Chapter The residence of the Canons of the Chapter of the cathedral of Parma (Canonica) was established on 29 December 877 by Bishop Wibodus and King Carloman.Cappelletti, p. 98. The cathedral of Parma, which had been constructed with substantial aid from the Countess Matilda of Tuscany, was consecrated by Pope Paschal II on 31 October 1106.Chronicon Parmense, p. 325. eodem anno MCVI de mense novembris consecrata fuit ecclesia major sanctae Mariae de Parma a praedicto Paschali Papae. nam celebrato concilio in Guastalla immediate Papa et d. comitissa Matildis venerunt Parmam, et ibi ad preces dictae d. comitissae consecravit praedictam ecclesiam quam ipse construxerat. Cappelletti, p. 158. On 3 January 1116 began a series of earthquakes in the neighborhood of Parma, which lasted for thirty days. In 1117 another major earthquake destroyed the Cathedral of Parma.Chronicon Parmense, p. 325. Fuit unus maximus terraemotus et tunc magna pars ecclesiae majoris de Parma corruit....

The baptistry of the Cathedral was dedicated on 25 May 1270 by Bishop Opizzo de Sancto Vitale.Ordinarium, p. 155, note 3. The largest bell of the cathedral, named \\"Bajonus\\", was given by Cardinal Gerardo Bianchi in 1291.Ordinarium, p. 10, with note 1. It was tolled at the funerals of the magistrates of Parma, and of the members of the most noble families: the Rossi, the Sanvitale, the Corrigia and the Pallavicini; the Marchesi di Lupi, and the lords of Cornazzano and Conignaco. On 8 January 1584, the high altar of the Cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Ferrante Farnese.Allodi, II, p. 111. In 1691, the Cathedral was staffed by a Chapter composed of three dignities (Archdeacon, Archpriest, and Provost) and fourteen Canons.Ritzler- Sefrin, Hierarchia catholica V, p. 302, note 1. In 1579, the residence of the Canons was at the monastery of S. Giovanni Evangelista in Parma, directly behind the apse of the cathedral.Allodi, I, p. 187. The Cathedral was awarded the status of a minor basilica by Pope Gregory XVI in a bull of 13 June 1834.Vitale Loschi (1834).

On 24 April 1246, Cadalo, the new Bishop of Parma, and his family, who were established in the diocese of Verona, created and endowed a new monastery, that of S. Giorgio, in Breida, near Verona.Kehr, Italia pontificia Vol. VI, part 1, pp. 259-260. Bishop Cadalo held a diocesan synod in 1061. He was in schism with Pope Alexander II, and counted all of Lombardy in his camp except for territories belonging to Countess Matilda of Tuscany.Allodi, I, p. 225. Vittorio Cavallari, \\"Cadalo e gli Erzoni,\\" Studi storici veronesi 15 (1965), pp. 95-158. Synods On 28–30 September 1466, a diocesan synod took place, presided over by the Vicar General Avinatri, with a special mandate from Bishop Giovanni (Giacomo) Antonio della Torre (1463-1476). The opening Mass was celebrated by della Torre's Auxiliary Bishop, Fra Agostino. The statutes of the earlier synods of Bishops Obizzo Sanvitale (1257–1295), Papiniano della Rovere (1300-1316), and Delfino della Pergola (1425-1463), were read out.Allodi, II, p. 772-774. Bishop della Torre held a second synod in March 1470.Pezzana, pp. 319-320. In 1564 Bishop Alessandro Sforza (1560-1573) presided over the first diocesan synod following the close of the Council of Trent. In 1568 he took part in the provincial synod of the ecclesiastical province of Ravenna, presided over by Cardinal Giulio della Rovere.

From 1972 to 2002 he was a Professor and Head of the Computing Department at Imperial College London. His research contributions include the early realisation of the software evolution phenomenon and the eponymous Lehman's laws of software evolution. Career Lehman was born in Germany on 24 January 1925 and emigrated to England in 1931. He studied mathematics as an undergraduate at Imperial College London where he was involved in the design of the Imperial College Computing Engine's Digital Computer Arithmetic Unit. He spent a year at Ferranti in London before working at Israel's Ministry of Defense from 1957 to 1964. From 1964 to 1972 he worked at IBM's research division in Yorktown Heights, NY where he studied program evolution with Les Belady. The study of IBM's programming process gave the foundations for Lehman's laws of software evolution. In 1972 he returned to Imperial College where he was Head of Section and later Head of Department (1979–1984). Lehman remained at Imperial for some thirty years until 2002 when he moved to the School of Computing Science at Middlesex University.

Botanical Magazine 79: t. 4716 Sandersonia aurantiacaKew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, Sandersonia aurantiaca Common names for S. aurantiaca include Christmas bells, golden lily of the valley, Chinese lantern lily and Chinese lantern bulb. S. aurantiaca is a perennial plant of trailing growth that can reach 30 inches in height. The flowers are yellow or orange.Botanica: The Illustrated AZ of over 10000 garden plants and how to cultivate them (Könemann, 2004, ), 818, 962. Care Sandersonia aurantiaca thrives in well-drained sandy soil enriched with compost and enjoys full sun, but not excessive heat (under which condition it requires frequent watering). A delicate plant, it bruises easily if handled carelessly. The growth habit is upright but lax, with plants benefitting from staking. Herbaceous perennials, Sandersonias die back naturally at the end of the season, surviving the winter in zones 9 and 10. They do well in San Francisco, San Diego, and other places with mild climates and are also suited to cultivation in glasshouses. Growth is slow for the first few years but becomes more rapid with each growing season, once the plants are fully established. When they have formed large enough clumps, they may be propagated by division. The orange/yellow flowers resemble tiny Chinese Lanterns. The orange of the flowers of Sandersonia aurantiaca is, however, more yellow in tone than that of the inflated calyces of Physalis alkekengi (another plant known by the common name Chinese lantern). Of the two plants, Sandersonia is the more resistant to fungal disease. Toxicity, due to colchicine content The corms of Sandersonia aurantiaca contain levels of the toxic alkaloid colchicine comparable to those in Gloriosa superba, another very poisonous plant belonging to the family Colchicaceae (named for the equally toxic Colchicum autumnale).Finnie, J.F. and van Staden, J.

The plant has been held responsible for at least one case of fatal poisoning, the victim being an 80-year-old Japanese woman who died nine days after eating the corms, after doctors failed in their attempts to reverse the decline in her white blood cell count. The toxic principle was determined to be Colchicine and this was the first occasion upon which the alkaloid was found to be present in Sandersonia aurantiaca.http://www.thepoisongarden.co.uk/atoz/colchicum_autumnale.htm Retrieved 19.15 on Monday 9/9/19 Gallery File:Sandersonia aurantiaca 1DS- II 2-5451.jpgSide view of single flower.

Together with Jules A. Hoffmann, he received one-half of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, for \\"their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity\\" (the other half went to Ralph M. Steinman for \\"his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in adaptive immunity\\"). Beutler is currently director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. Education Between 1959 and 1977, Beutler lived in Southern California. He received his secondary school education at Polytechnic School in Pasadena, California. He attended college at the University of California, San Diego, graduating at the age of 18 in 1976. He enrolled in medical school at the University of Chicago in 1977 and received his M.D. degree in 1981 at the age of 23. During his childhood and early adolescent years, Beutler developed a lasting interest in biological science. Some of his formative experiences in biology included studies in the laboratory of his father, and later, in the City of Hope laboratory of Susumu Ohno, a mammalian geneticist known for his work on evolution, genome structure, and sex differentiation. In addition, he worked in the laboratories of Abraham Braude, an expert in the biology of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), also known as endotoxin, and Patricia Spear, an authority on Herpes simplex virus. Later, Beutler was to perform extensive research on both LPS and herpesviruses, aimed principally at understanding inborn host resistance to infectious diseases, often referred to as innate immunity. Academic positions Beutler majored in biology as an undergraduate at the University of California, San Diego, where he graduated in 1976 at the age of 18. He attended medical school at the University of Chicago. From 1981 to 1983 Beutler continued his medical training at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas, as an intern in the Department of Internal Medicine, and as a resident in the Department of Neurology. Between 1983 and 1985 he was a postdoctoral fellow at Rockefeller University in the laboratory of Anthony Cerami. He became an assistant professor at Rockefeller University in 1985. He was also an associate physician at the Rockefeller University Hospital between 1984 and 1986. Beutler returned to Dallas in 1986 as an assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and an assistant investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, where he retained a position for the next 14 years. He became an associate professor and an associate investigator with HHMI in 1990, and a professor in 1996. In 2000, Beutler moved to The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, as a professor in the department of immunology. In 2007, he became chairman of the newly created Department of Genetics at Scripps Research. In 2011, Beutler returned to UT Southwestern Medical Center to become director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense. On October 4, 2011, Beutler was named regental professor of the University of Texas System.http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/news- releases/year-2011/internationally-acclaimed-immunologist-to-lead-new-center- at-ut-southwestern.html Scientific contributions Jules A. Hoffmann, Göran K. Hansson (chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physiology or Medicine) and BeutlerBeutler is best known for his pioneering molecular and genetic studies of inflammation and innate immunity. He was the first to isolate mouse tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), and to demonstrate the inflammatory potential of this cytokine, proving its important role in endotoxin-induced shock.Beutler, B., et al. Passive immunization against cachectin/tumor necrosis factor protects mice from lethal effect of endotoxin. Science 229(4716):869-71, 1985 Subsequently, he invented recombinant molecules expressly designed to neutralize TNF, fusing the binding portion of TNF receptor proteins to the heavy chain of an immunoglobulin molecule to force receptor dimerization.Peppel, K., et al. A tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity. J.Exp.Med. 174(6):1483-9, 1991 These molecules were later used extensively as the drug Etanercept in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, psoriasis, and other forms of inflammation. Interested in the mechanism by which LPS activates mammalian immune cells, Beutler used TNF production as a phenotypic endpoint to identify the LPS receptor. Identification of the receptor hinged on the positional cloning of the mammalian Lps locus, which had been known since the 1960s as a key genetic determinant of all biological responses to LPS.Sultzer, B.M. Genetic control of leucocyte responses to endotoxin. Nature 219(5160):1253-4, 1968 Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals, demonstrating that one of the mammalian Toll-like receptors, TLR4, acts as the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex.Poltorak, A., et al. Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene. Science 282(5396):2085-8, 1998 The TLRs (of which ten are now known to exist in humans) are now widely known to function in the perception of microbes, each detecting signature molecules that herald infection. These receptors also mediate severe illness, including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection. They are central to the pathogenesis of sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.Christensen, S.R., et al. Toll-like receptor 7 and TLR9 dictate autoantibody specificity and have opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles in a murine model of lupus. Immunity 25(3):417-28, 2006 The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011.Jules A. Hoffmann (background) and BeutlerThe positional cloning of Lps was completed in 1998. Beutler thereafter continued to apply a forward genetic approach to the analysis of immunity in mammals. In this process, germline mutations that alter immune function are created through a random process using the alkylating agent ENU, detected by their phenotypic effects, and then isolated by positional cloning. His work disclosed numerous essential signaling molecules required for the innate immune response,Hoebe, K., et al. Identification of Lps2 as a key transducer of MyD88-independent TIR signalling. Nature 424(6950):743-8, 2003Hoebe, K., et al. CD36 is a sensor of diacylglycerides. Nature 433(7025):523-7, 2005Tabeta, K., et al. The Unc93b1 mutation 3d disrupts exogenous antigen presentation and signaling via Toll-like receptors 3, 7 and 9. Nature Immunol. 7(2):156-64, 2006 and helped to delineate the biochemistry of innate immunity. ENU mutagenesis was also used by Beutler and colleagues to study the global response to a defined infectious agent. By screening mutant mice for susceptibility to mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV), they identified a large number of genes that make a life-or-death difference during infection, and termed this set of genes the MCMV \\"resistome\\". These genes fall into \\"sensing,\\" \\"signaling,\\" \\"effector,\\" \\"homeostatic,\\" and \\"developmental\\" categories, and some of them were wholly unexpected. For example, Kir6.1 ATP-sensitive potassium channels in the smooth muscle of the coronary arteries serve an essential homeostatic role during infection by this microbe, and mutations that affect them cause sudden death during infection. In the course of their work, Beutler and his colleagues identified genes required for other important biological processes, including the regulation of iron absorption, hearing, and embryonic development, since their disruption by ENU created strikingly abnormal visible phenotypes. Awards and recognition Beutler has been elected to numerous honorary academic societies. These include the United States National Academy of Sciences and the Institute of Medicine. Beutler is also an associate member (foreign associate) of the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), and a member of the Association of American Physicians, and the American Society for Clinical Investigation.

The singing also involves musical accompaniment. Bhima, the second of the Pandava is the hero of the story in this style. This form of folk theatre is popular in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh and in the neighbouring areas of Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.Ministry of Tribal affairs felicitates Smt. Teejan Bai Jhaduram Dewangan and Teejan Bai are the most renowned singers of this style. Among contemporary artists, Ritu Verma is popularPandavani along with others such as Shantibai Chelak and Usha Barle Origins The origins of this singing style are not known and according to its foremost singer Teejan Bai, it might be as old as the Mahabharata itself, as few people could read in those times and that is how perhaps they passed on their stories generation after generation.Teejan Bai Interview Traditionally, Pandavani was performed exclusively by men. Since the 1980s, however, women also began to present Pandavani. Pandavani can be understood as a part of the tradition of the tellers-of-tales present in every culture or tradition (like Baul singers of Bengal and Kathak performers), where ancient epics, anecdotes and stories are recounted or re-enacted to educate and entertain the masses. About the style Pandavani, literally means stories or songs of the Pandavas, the legendary brothers of Mahabharat, and involves the lead singer, enacting and singing an episode (called 'prasang') from the epic with an ektara or a tambura (stringed musical instrument), decorated with small bells and peacock feathers in one hand and sometimes kartal (a pair of cymbals) on another.The Tribune, 16 November 2002 During a performance, as the story builds, the tambura becomes a prop, sometimes to personify Bhima's 'gadaa' mace, or Arjun's bow or chariot, or the hair of queen Draupadi or DushasanTeejan Bai, Rediff.com thus helping the narrator-singer play all the characters of story. The form does not employ any stage props or settings. With the use of mimicry and rousing theatrical movements, once in a while the singer-narrator breaks into an impromptu dance at the completion of an episode or to celebrate a victory in the story being retold. The singer is usually supported by a group of performers on Harmonium, Tabla, Dholak, Manjira and two or three singers who sing the refrain and provide backing vocals. Each singer adds his or her unique style to the singing, sometimes adding local words, improvising and offering critique on current happenings and insights through the story. Gradually, as the story progresses, the performance becomes more intense and experiential with added dance movements. An element of surprise is often used. The lead singer continuously interacts with the accompanying singers, who ask questions, give commentary and interjections; thus enhancing the dramatic effect of the performance. The performance can last for several hours on a single episode of Mahabharata. What starts out as a simple story narration turns into full-fledged ballad. Variations (Shaili) * Vedamati – the style of narration is said to be based on Sabbal Singh Chauhan's Mahabharat written in the Doha-Chaupal Metre. The term Veda is loosely used to refer to text. This style was made popular by Jhaduram Devangan. Other exponents of this style are Poonaram Nishad, Ritu Verma, Rewaram Sahu. * Kapalik – the style of narration where the performer is free to improvise consistently on episodes and characters in the epic. The term Kapal is of significance here as it refers to memory or experience which inform the content of the performance. Teejan Bai is an exponent of this genre of pandwani.Usha Barle, Shanti Bai are also the performers of this style. Impact on popular culture Influences of Pandavani can be clearly seen in the plays of Habib Tanvir, who used folk singers of Chhattisgarh in his plays, creating a free-style story narration format, typical of Pandavani.

He previously served in oil-rich Rivers State as Governor of Rivers State from 2007 to 2015 and Speaker of the Rivers State House of Assembly from 1999 to 2007. Background Amaechi was born in Ubima, Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State to the family of the late Elder Fidelis Amaechi and Mary Amaechi. His first and last names are Igbo meaning “God is strength or power” and “who knows tomorrow” respectively. He was raised in Diobu, a densely populated neighbourhood in Port Harcourt. He had his early education at St Theresa's Primary School from 1970 to 1976. He earned his West African Senior School Certificate in 1982 after attending Government Secondary School Okolobiri. Amaechi received a Bachelor of Arts degree (Honours) in English Studies and Literature from the University of Port Harcourt in 1987, where he was the President of the National Union of Rivers State Students (NURSS). He completed the mandatory National Youth Service Corps in 1988, and thereafter joined Pamo Clinics and Hospitals Limited owned by Peter Odili, where he worked until 1992. He also a director of several companies, including West Africa Glass Industry Limited and Risonpalm Nigeria Limited. Early political career During the transition to the Third Nigerian Republic, Amaechi was Secretary of the National Republican Convention in Ikwerre Local Government Area of Rivers State. Between 1992 and 1994, he was Special Assistant to the Deputy Governor of Rivers State, Peter Odili – his boss believed in Amaechi as a young man with potential in politics, and brought him under his wing. In 1996, he was the Rivers State's Secretary of the Democratic Party of Nigeria (DPN) caretaker committee during the transition programme of General Sani Abacha.  Rivers State House of Assembly (1999–2007)  In 1999, he contested and won a seat to become a member of the Rivers State House of Assembly to represent his constituency. He was subsequently elected as the Speaker of the House of Assembly. Amaechi was elected the Chairman of Nigeria's Conference of Speakers of State Assemblies. In May 2003, he was re-elected as the Speaker. In 2003, when the National Assembly moved to hijack the legislative functions of the State House of Assembly as enshrined in the constitution, he and his colleagues took the matter to Supreme Court. As speaker, Amaechi used his close working relationship with Governor Peter Odili to increase the harmonious relationship between the Executive and Legislative arms of government in Rivers State, until when Rotimi Amaechi launched a campaign against the State Government, and verbally attacked the image of the State Governor, in an effort to succeed Peter Odili as governor in 2007. Governor of Rivers State In 2007, Amaechi contested and won the People's Democratic Party (PDP) primary for Rivers State Governor in 2007. His name was substituted by the party, an action which he challenged in court. The case eventually got to the Supreme Court. He became governor on October 26, 2007, after the Supreme Court ruled that he was the rightful candidate of the PDP and winner of the April 2007 Governorship election in Rivers State. His administration invested in infrastructure development, construction of roads and bridges, sticking to the vision of connecting all parts of the state by road. The governor was also committed to urban renewal and modernization of transportation services. His administration began building a monorail to provide mass transportation within the city of Port Harcourt. Some power plant projects (Afam, Trans Amadi, Onne) were also built to improve power supply in the State. He was re-elected for a second term on 26 April 2011. In August 2013, Amaechi was amongst seven serving governors who formed the G-7 faction within the PDP. In November 2013, Amaechi alongside five members of the G-7 defected to the new opposition party the All Progressives Congress (APC) and became director general of Muhammadu Buhari's presidential campaign.  Minister of Transportation  In 2015, following Muhammadu Buhari's election, Amaechi was appointed to his cabinet as Federal Minister of Transportation. In July 2019, he was re-nominated for ministerial appointment by President Buhari. Amaechi was ask to take a bow and go during his screening by the Senate.  Corruption  Since leaving office in 2015, Amaechi has been the subject of corruption allegations by his successor Governor Ezenwo Wike. Wike accused him of using state funds to finance President Muhammadu Buhari's campaign during the 2015 presidential election through the sale of Rivers state-owned oil and gas assets, and fraudulently misappropriating the proceeds of the sale amounting to US$309 million. Amaechi has persistently denied the allegations against him. In 2018, he acknowledged that despite Buhari's anti-corruption war corruption exists within the administration.

It lies near to the village of Azokh in Nagorno- Karabakh, Azerbaijan. Currently, this cave and the surrounded villages are under occupation of Armenian forces.  The discovery of the cave  The cave was discovered by the \\"Palaeolithic Archaeological Expedition\\" of the Azerbaijan National Academy of Sciences under the leadership of Mammadali Huseynov in 1960 and is considered to be the site of one of the most ancient locations of proto-human presence in Eurasia. A Neanderthal-like jaw bone found in 1968 is assumed to be over 300,000 years old and thus one of the oldest proto-human remains found in central Asia. Its discovery gave rise to the term Azykh Man. Archaeologists have suggested that the finds from the lowest layers are of a pre-Acheulean culture (730,000 to 1,800,000 years ago), that resembles the Olduwan culture named after Tanzania's Olduvai Gorge in many respects. The poor quality of the 1960s excavation, in which no taphonomic data was collected,Taphonomy and Site Formation of Azokh 1, in Azokh Cave and the Transcaucasian Corridor, 2016. led to uncertainties over the chronological sequence of the layers.V. Doronichev, \\"The Lower Paleolithic in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus: A Reappraisal of the Data and New Approaches\\" in PaleoAnthropology 2008, p147. Excavations resumed in the mid-1990s. In 2002 an international research team headed by Tanya King discovered undisturbed entrances to the cave as well as fauna and stone tools.Exploration and Survey of Pleistocene Hominid Sites in Armenia and Karabagh Fossil assemblages recovered from the excavations between 2002 and 2009 found Pleistocene-era remains of bears accumulated as a result of hibernation, but no evidence for simultaneous occupation of the cave by bears and hominins. Other faunal remains, mainly herbivores, had been brought to the cave by hominins, but butchering had taken place somewhere else, not at the rear of the cave where the remains were found. When cave sediments reached close to the cave roof, the cave ceased to be used by hominins. Finally, during the Holocene, the upper sediments were eroded by water, opening up the cave to renewed human use.Taphonomy and Site Formation of Azokh 1, in Azokh Cave and the Transcaucasian Corridor, 2016. Excavations in 2009 The cave is now considered to have housed some of the earliest groups of proto-humans in Eurasia.Quaternary Deposits at the Lesser Caucasus, The Armenian Corridor Using uranium isotopes as a speleothem dating method, the minimum date for the formation of the cave, and thus the earliest hominid deposits, have been dated to 1.19 ±0.08 million years.Dating Methods Applied to Azokh Cave Sites, in Azokh Cave and the Transcaucasian Corridor, 2016.  Layers  Archaeological layers registered in the Azykh Paleolithic Cave during archaeological excavations are as follows:  The first layer  The first layer is composed of black sediments, sometimes yellow mixed soil. During the archaeological excavations, clay dishes belonging to medieval times were found. During the archaeological excavations carried out in 1962-1965, parts of clay dishes belonging to the Middle Ages, Bronze Age, and Eneolithic period were found. However, during archaeological excavations in subsequent years, the material remains belonging to the Eneolithic period were not registered. The total thickness of the layer was 77–125 cm.  The second layer  consists of light-yellowish clay soil. During the archeological investigations, a piece of individual rock and clay dishes were registered inside the layer. Clay dishes have mainly belonged to the medieval, Bronze, and Eneolithic periods. The total thickness of the layer was 90-180 sm.  The third layer  The third layer consists of gray soil. According to different features, three stratums were identified in the third layer during the archeological excavations conducted between 1973 and 1974: = The first stratum = The first stratum consists of dark-gray soil. Parts of small rock are also found inside of stratum. For the first time, stone products and hunted animal bones belonging to Mousterian were found in this stratum. = The second stratum = The second stratum consists of clay soil. Inside the stratum, rock fractures falling from the ceiling of the cave were registered. At the same time, several large rock stones were discovered inside the stratum. = The third stratum = The third stratum consists of light gray clay rocks where rock fractures were found. The lower part of the stratum consists of yellow soil. During the archeological excavations conducted in 1973 for the first time, 20 tools like axe belonging to Mousterian were found in the lower stratum of the third layer. These were one of the rarest findings of the Mousterian excavations because these tools were characterizing the Acheulean period. The overall thickness of the third stratum was 90–145 cm.  The fourth layer  The fourth layer consists of dark-brown clay soil. There are small rock fractures on the strata. These fractures are made of stalagmites, stalactites, stalagmitic pieces. No material culture examples from the fourth layer have been registered until the 1973 archaeological excavations. However, during the archeological excavations carried out in 1973, several stone items and hunted animal bones belonging to the last Acheulean were found in the fourth layer. The total thickness of the layer reaches 1-1.2 m.  The fifth layer  The fifth layer consists of yellow soil. The richest and thickest sediment in the stratigraphy of the Azykh cave is in the fifth layer. During the 1963-1969 and 1971–1986 years according to archeological excavations carried out on the fifth layer, numerous hunted animal bones and 300 pieces of stone were found. In the fifth layer of the Azykh cave, which has the richest stratigraphy within the Greater Caucasus paleolithic caves, fireplaces for cooking, primary building installations, and saved bear skulls were found. In the entire research season, the following smaller stratum were discovered in the fifth layer: = The first stratum = The first stratum consists of dark-brown clay soil. In addition to archeological findings, rock fractures have also been found. The thickness of the stratum is 30–43 cm. = The second stratum = The second stratum consists of light-brown clay soil. Stones products and fauna remains were found inside the stratum. The thickness of the stratum was 28–44 cm. = The third stratum = The third stratum consists of light-yellow clay soil. During the archaeological excavations, plenty of hunted animal bones were found along with stone products. The thickness of the stratum was 48–62 cm. = The fourth stratum = The fourth stratum consists of dark yellow clay soil. Along with archaeological materials, small rock fractures have also been found in it. The thickness of the stratum reaches 38–44 cm. = The fifth stratum = The fifth stratum consists of gray-green clay soil. During the research, hunted animal bones were found along with labor tools. The thickness of the stratum was 44–56 cm. = The sixth stratum = The sixth stratum consists of dark-brown clay soil. During the archaeological excavations, many fauna remains were found along with labor tools. There are rock fractures falling from the ceiling of the cave. The thickness of the stratum was 42–56 cm.  The sixth layer  The sixth layer consists of gray clay soil. However, in comparison with other layers mentioned above, the sixth layer is rich in quite a lot of gravels and rock stones. More than 3,000 pieces of stone were found here. The thickness of the layer was 55–87 cm.  The seventh layer  The seventh layer is composed of a light-blue clay layer. In the articles about the Azykh Cave published in 1974 on archaeological excavations indicated that there was no archaeological material remains below the 6th layer. However, during archaeological excavations in sediments of the cave below the 6th layer, in 1974, four archeological layers (7th-10th layers) were registered and material remains were found in these layers. The thickness of the layer was 82–98 cm.  The eighth layer  The eighth layer is composed of dark-blue clay. During the archaeological excavations, the material remains were discovered inside of the layer. At the same time, single rock pieces falling from the ceiling of the cave were found. The thickness of the base was 90–115 cm.  The ninth layer  The ninth layer is composed of open-blue clay soil. During the archaeological excavations, culture samples were found inside of the layer. The thickness of the layer was 78–84 cm.  The tenth layer  The tenth layer is composed of yellow clay soil, relatively with more stone layers. During the archaeological excavations, stone tools were found inside of this layer. The layer is quite hard as it is located on the surface of the rock. The thickness of the layer was 78–83 cm.

He is a longstanding member of the American Institute of Architects College of Fellows. Among other works, Dworsky designed Crisler Arena, the basketball arena at the University of Michigan named for Dworsky's former football coach, Fritz Crisler. Other professional highlights include designing Drake Stadium at UCLA, the Federal Reserve Bank in Los Angeles and the Block M seating arrangement at Michigan Stadium. He is also known for a controversy with Frank Gehry over the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Previously, Dworsky was an American football linebacker, fullback and center who played professional football for the Los Angeles Dons of the All-America Football Conference in 1949, and college football for the Michigan Wolverines from 1945 to 1948. He was an All- American on Michigan's undefeated national championship teams in 1947 and 1948. College football at the University of Michigan Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1927, Dworsky lived in the Twin Cities and Sioux Falls, South Dakota before attending the University of Michigan. Dworsky was a four-year starter for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1948. He played linebacker, fullback, and center for the Michigan Wolverines and was a key player on the undefeated 1947 and 1948 Michigan football teams that won consecutive national championships. The 1947 team, anchored by Len Ford, Alvin Wistert, Dworsky and Rick Kempthorn, has been described as the best team in the history of Michigan football. Dworsky won a total of six varsity letters at Michigan, four in football and two in wrestling where he competed in the heavyweight division. Dworsky is among the famous Jews in football, and has been extensively profiled in encyclopedic Jewish publications. Dworsky married the former Sylvia Ann Taylor on August 10, 1957. The couple has three children: Douglas, Laurie and Nancy. They reside in Los Angeles. 1947 season Dworsky in wrestling uniform at Michigan. The 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team went 10–0 and outscored their opponents 394 to 53. Dworsky led a defensive unit that gave up an average of 5.3 points per game and shut out Michigan State (55-0), Pitt (60-0), Indiana (35-0), Ohio State (21-0), and USC (49-0). He also played fullback and center for the 1947 team and was named a third team All-American by the American Football Coaches Association. In a 1988 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Dworsky described the 1947 team's defensive scheme as follows: \\"We were an intelligent team and we had some complex defenses, the nature of which you see today. I called the defensive signals and we would shift people, looping, or stunting.\\" After going undefeated and winning the Big Ten championship, Michigan was invited to Pasadena to face the USC Trojans in the 1948 Rose Bowl—the Wolverines' first bowl game since 1901. Just before Christmas, the team boarded a train in Ann Abor for a three-day trip across the country. With little to do on the train, Alvin Wistert recalled that Dworsky entertained the team with music. \\"Dan Dworsky was a piano player. We'd gather around and sing. There was a piano in the last car.\\" After the long trip, the Wolverines beat the Trojans 49-0\\\\. Dworsky recalled that the coaching staff did an excellent job of scouting the Trojans. \\"When we went to the Rose Bowl, we had USC down pat. We knew their system as well as they did.\\" The Trojans gained only 91 yards rushing and 42 yards passing, moving past midfield only twice. Dworsky played center during the Rose Bowl, blocking USC's All-American tackle (and future Los Angeles city councilman), John Ferraro. In Dworsky's collegiate days, the final national rankings were determined before the bowl games. At the end of the regular season in 1947, Michigan was ranked No. 2 behind Notre Dame, but after defeating USC 49-0 in the Rose Bowl, the Associated Press held a special poll, and Michigan replaced Notre Dame as the national champion by a vote of 226 to 119. Dworsky later noted, \\"Notre Dame still claims that national championship and so do we.\\" 1948 season The 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team went 9-0 and outscored their opponents 252 to 44. The defensive unit led by Dworsky held its opponents to just 4.9 points per game, including shutouts against Oregon (14-0), Purdue (40-0), Northwestern (28-0), Navy (35-0), and Indiana (54-0). The 1948 Wolverines finished the season ranked No. 1 by the AP, but Big Ten Conference rules prohibited a team from playing in the Rose Bowl two years in a row. Dworsky did, however, play in the 1948 Blue–Gray All Star game. Relationship with Fritz Crisler Dworsky was a four-year starter under Michigan's legendary coach, Fritz Crisler. Dworsky later said that Crisler's \\"real genius\\" was in blending all the elements. The 1947 championship team included several older veteran players who had returned from military service. Dworsky recalled: \\"About half of us were 18-year old kids, and half were veterans. We had guys who were serious guys and guys who were excitable. Fritz struck a balance, so we never had to be pushed, but we never lost our focus either.\\" Dworsky recalled: \\"Crisler was not only an intellectual in strategy, but also in the way he ran practices.... He ran practices rigidly and we called him 'The Lord'. He would allow it to rain, or not. He was a Douglas MacArthur-type figure, handsome and rigid.... I sculpted him and gave him the bust in 1971.\\" Dworsky also kept another bust of Crisler in his office. Professional football with the Los Angeles Dons In 1949, Dworsky was the first round draft pick of the Los Angeles Dons of the All- America Football Conference. The Dons were the first professional football team in Los Angeles. Dworsky played eleven games with the Dons in 1949, his only season in professional football. Dworsky played linebacker and blocking back for the Dons and had one interception and one kick return for 14 yards. The AAFC disbanded after the 1949 season, and Dworsky turned down an offer from the Pittsburgh Steelers to return to the University of Michigan where he graduated in 1950 with a degree in architecture. Dworsky later noted: \\"It was a toss-up whether I would become a pro football player or an architect. Being a linebacker is good conditioning for a young designer. You learn to block the bull coming at you from all sides.\\" Career as an architect Overview of Dworsky's practice After receiving his degree in architecture in 1950, Dworsky moved to Los Angeles and served as an apprentice in the early 1950s with prominent local early modernists William Pereira, Raphael Soriano, and Charles Luckman. In 1953, Dworsky began his own architecture firm in Los Angeles, known as Dworsky Associates. The firm grew into one of the most prominent architectural firms in California, creating major public buildings in California. Dworsky Associates won the 1984 Firm of the Year Award from the California Council of the American Institute of Architects. In September 2000, Dworsky Associates merged with CannonDesign and ceased to operate as an independent firm. Architectural style Dworsky belongs to the generation of post-World War II modernists that took its cues from the 1920s German Bauhaus and the French-Swiss master Le Corbusier. In 1988, Dworsky noted: \\"I am most intrigued by the essential mystery of architecture. For me, built space will always be a kind of theater, a stage on which life is played, and played out. That's why I keep on being an architect. Asked what inspires his architecture, Dworsky said he draws from the \\"solid, resolved concepts\\" of modern designers such as Le Corbusier and Marcel Bruer, while being encouraged on occasion to experiment by such \\"new wave\\" designers as Frank Gehry and Eric Owen Moss. Crisler Arena and the Block \\"M\\" Crisler Arena Dworsky's \\"Block M\\" at Michigan Stadium The Tom Bradley Terminal at LAX Federal Reserve Bank, Los Angeles Drake Stadium at UCLA Dworsky's first major commission was to design a basketball arena for his alma mater, the University of Michigan. The members of the 1947 Michigan Wolverines football team had reunions with Fritz Crisler every five years in Ann Arbor, and it was at one of those reunions that Crisler (by then the school's athletic director) gave Dworsky one of his big breaks, asking him to design the arena. Built in 1967, the arena was named Crisler Arena, as a tribute to the coach. Dworsky's design of the arena was well received and was said to demonstrate \\"his ability to combine majesty of scale with human accessibility\\". The roof of Crisler Arena is made of two plates, each weighing approximately 160 tons. The bridge-like construction allows them to expand or contract given the change of seasons or the weight of the snow. Crisler Arena remains the home of Michigan's basketball team and houses memorabilia and trophies from all Wolverine varsity athletic teams. In 1965, the wooden benches at Michigan Stadium were replaced with blue fiberglass benches. Dworsky designed a yellow \\"Block M\\" for the stands on the eastern side of the stadium, just above the tunnel. Drake Stadium at UCLA After his work on Crisler Arena, Dworsky was commissioned by UCLA to design a track and field stadium on the university's central campus. Dworsky designed the stadium, known as Drake Stadium. Since its inaugural meet on February 22, 1969, the stadium has been the site of numerous championship meets, including the National AAU track & field championships in 1976, 1977, and 1978. It is also used each year for special campus events, such as the annual UCLA Commencement Exercises in June. Major works The major works credited to Dworsky and his firm include the following: * The Jerry Lewis Neuromuscular Research Center at UCLA (1979). * The Tom Bradley International Terminal at Los Angeles International Airport (1984). * A planned community complex for the California School for the Blind in Fremont, California. The design won a merit award from the California AIA. * The Theater Arts Building at California State University Dominguez Hills. Dworsky cited the theater as one of his favorite projects.

Walt Disney Concert Hall controversy Walt Disney Concert Hall In February 1989, the Walt Disney Concert Hall Committee selected Dworsky as executive architect to work with designated architect Frank Gehry in designing the future home of the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Dworsky was selected to translate Gehry's conceptual designs into working drawings that would meet building code specifications. By 1994, the cost of the project had skyrocketed to $160 million (it eventually reached $274 million), and controversy halted the project. By 1996, a major donor was sought to complete the project by 2001 (four years behind schedule). Gehry and his design came under fire, and some considered him a spoiled, impractical artist. Gehry publicly blamed Dworsky: \\"The executive architect was incapable of doing drawings that had this complexity. We helped select that firm. I went to Daniel, supposedly a friend, and I said, 'This is going to fail and we now have the capability to do it, so let us ghost-write it.'\\" Dworsky refused. Gehry was also quoted in the Los Angeles Times as saying: \\"We had the wrong executive architect doing the drawings. I helped pick him, I'm partly responsible. It brought us to a stop.\\"\\" Gehry told Los Angeles magazine in 1996 that he \\"no longer speaks to his former friend (Dworsky)\\". Gehry continued his public attacks on Dworsky: \\"He (Dworsky) made a lot of money. He begged me for the job. I'd like to shoot him.\\" Dworsky was eventually told to stop working on the drawings before he completed them, but he defended himself against Gehry's criticism. \\"Knowledgeable people were supportive of us. They were saying it's a very complex and unusual design, and they can understand the difficulties in trying to achieve this within a limited budget and a limited schedule. It was unfortunate that Frank came out with his criticism, but he was the center of the storm, having designed the building, and he was just trying to lessen the blame on himself.\\" Dworsky also told the Los Angeles Times: \\"This is a one-of-a-kind building. You just don't simply open up the plans and understand them quickly.\\" Dworsky's allies refer to Gehry's work as \\"confusing\\". Disney Hall official Frederick M. Nicholas also defended Dworsky's work against Gehry's attacks, denying that there were any problems with the Dworsky drawings not attributable to fast-tracking. Nicholas said: \\"They were not 'bad' drawings. It was a question of the subs not understanding them.\\" Notes External links * Photo of Soboleski, Dworsky, Wistert, Elliott and Crisler at 1948 Rose Bowl * Photo of 1948 Rose Bowl Team - Dworsky 3rd from left in back row 1927 births Living people American football centers Architects from California 20th-century American architects Los Angeles Dons players Michigan Wolverines football players Sportspeople from Los Angeles Sportspeople from Minneapolis Sportspeople from Sioux Falls, South Dakota Jewish American football people Jewish architects Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning alumni American wrestlers Players of American football from South Dakota Players of American football from Minnesota Players of American football from California ","title":"Dan Dworsky"},{"id":"14449115","text":"Otanomomo is a locality in the South Otago region of New Zealand's South Island.

The hourglass was one of the earlier timekeeping devices and has become a symbol of the concept of time. For thousands of years, devices have been used to measure and keep track of time. The current sexagesimal system of time measurement dates to approximately 2000 from the Sumerians. The Egyptians divided the day into two 12-hour periods, and used large obelisks to track the movement of the sun. They also developed water clocks, which were probably first used in the Precinct of Amun-Re, and later outside Egypt as well; they were employed frequently by Persians and the Ancient Greeks, who called them clepsydrae. The Zhou dynasty is believed to have used the outflow water clock around the same time, devices which were introduced from Mesopotamia as early as 2000. Other ancient timekeeping devices include the candle clock, used in ancient China, ancient Japan, England and Mesopotamia; the timestick, widely used in Persia, India and Tibet, as well as some parts of Europe; and the hourglass, which functioned similarly to a water clock. The sundial, another early clock, relies on shadows to provide a good estimate of the hour on a sunny day. It is not so useful in cloudy weather or at night and requires recalibration as the seasons change (if the gnomon was not aligned with the Earth's axis). The earliest known clock with a water-powered escapement mechanism, which transferred rotational energy into intermittent motions,David Landes: \\"Revolution in Time: Clocks and the Making of the Modern World\\", rev. and enlarged edition, Harvard University Press, Cambridge 2000, , p.18f. dates back to 3rd century in ancient Greece; Chinese engineers later invented clocks incorporating mercury-powered escapement mechanisms in the 10th century, followed by Arabic engineers inventing water clocks driven by gears and weights in the 11th century. The first mechanical clocks, employing the verge escapement mechanism with a foliot or balance wheel timekeeper, were invented in Europe at around the start of the 14th century, and became the standard timekeeping device until the pendulum clock was invented in 1656. The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century. The pendulum clock remained the most accurate timekeeper until the 1930s, when quartz oscillators were invented, followed by atomic clocks after World War II. Although initially limited to laboratories, the development of microelectronics in the 1960s made quartz clocks both compact and cheap to produce, and by the 1980s they became the world's dominant timekeeping technology in both clocks and wristwatches. Atomic clocks are far more accurate than any previous timekeeping device, and are used to calibrate other clocks and to calculate the International Atomic Time; a standardized civil system, Coordinated Universal Time, is based on atomic time. Timekeeping devices of early civilizations The sun rising over Stonehenge in southern England on the June solstice Many ancient civilizations observed astronomical bodies, often the Sun and Moon, to determine times, dates, and seasons.Chobotov, p. 1 The first calendars may have been created during the last glacial period, by hunter-gatherers who employed tools such as sticks and bones to track the phases of the moon or the seasons. Stone circles, such as England's Stonehenge, were built in various parts of the world, especially in Prehistoric Europe, and are thought to have been used to time and predict seasonal and annual events such as equinoxes or solstices. As those megalithic civilizations left no recorded history, little is known of their calendars or timekeeping methods.Richards, p. 55 Methods of sexagesimal timekeeping, now common in both Western and Eastern societies, are first attested nearly 4,000 years ago in Mesopotamia and Egypt.Barnett, p. 102 Mesoamericans similarly modified their usual vigesimal counting system when dealing with calendars to produce a 360-day year.Aveni, p. 136. Ancient Egypt Ancient Egyptian sundial (c. 1500 BC) from the Valley of the Kings. Daytime divided into 12 parts. The oldest known sundial is from Egypt; it dates back to around 1500 BC (19th Dynasty), and was discovered in the Valley of the Kings in 2013.One of world's oldest sundials dug up in Kings' Valley, Upper Egypt Sundials have their origin in shadow clocks, which were the first devices used for measuring the parts of a day.Major, p. 9 Ancient Egyptian obelisks, constructed about 3500 BC, are also among the earliest shadow clocks. The Luxor Obelisk in Place de la Concorde, Paris, France Egyptian shadow clocks divided daytime into 12 parts with each part further divided into more precise parts. One type of shadow clock consisted of a long stem with five variable marks and an elevated crossbar which cast a shadow over those marks. It was positioned eastward in the morning so that the rising sun cast a shadow over the marks, and was turned west at noon to catch the afternoon shadows. Obelisks functioned in much the same manner: the shadow cast on the markers around it allowed the Egyptians to calculate the time. The obelisk also indicated whether it was morning or afternoon, as well as the summer and winter solstices. A third shadow clock, developed c. 1500 BC, was similar in shape to a bent T-square. It measured the passage of time by the shadow cast by its crossbar on a non-linear rule. The T was oriented eastward in the mornings, and turned around at noon, so that it could cast its shadow in the opposite direction.Barnett, p. 18 Although accurate, shadow clocks relied on the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians therefore developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century BC Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor.Berlev, p. 118 There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings on the side of the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504 BC), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt.Philbin, p. 128Cotterell, pp. 59–61 Another Egyptian method of determining the time during the night was using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600 BC, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.Whitrow, p. 28 Ancient Greece and Rome Ctesibius's clepsydra from the 3rd century. Clepsydra, literally water thief, is the Greek word for water clock. Water clocks, or clepsydrae, were commonly used in ancient Greece following their introduction by Plato, who also invented a water-based alarm clock. One account of Plato's alarm clock describes it as depending on the nightly overflow of a vessel containing lead balls, which floated in a columnar vat. The vat held a steadily increasing amount of water, supplied by a cistern. By morning, the vessel would have floated high enough to tip over, causing the lead balls to cascade onto a copper platter. The resultant clangor would then awaken Plato's students at the Academy.Barnett, p. 28 Another possibility is that it comprised two jars, connected by a siphon. Water emptied until it reached the siphon, which transported the water to the other jar. There, the rising water would force air through a whistle, sounding an alarm. The Greeks and Chaldeans regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations. Greek astronomer, Andronicus of Cyrrhus, supervised the construction of the Tower of the Winds in Athens in the 1st century. The Tower of the Winds in Athens, Greece, a 1st- century-BC clocktower from the period of Roman Greece In Greek tradition, clepsydrae were used in court; later, the Romans adopted this practice, as well. There are several mentions of this in historical records and literature of the era; for example, in Theaetetus, Plato says that \\"Those men, on the other hand, always speak in haste, for the flowing water urges them on\\". Another mention occurs in Lucius Apuleius' The Golden Ass: \\"The Clerk of the Court began bawling again, this time summoning the chief witness for the prosecution to appear. Up stepped an old man, whom I did not know. He was invited to speak for as long as there was water in the clock; this was a hollow globe into which water was poured through a funnel in the neck, and from which it gradually escaped through fine perforations at the base\\". The clock in Apuleius's account was one of several types of water clock used. Another consisted of a bowl with a hole in its centre, which was floated on water. Time was kept by observing how long the bowl took to fill with water. Although clepsydrae were more useful than sundials—they could be used indoors, during the night, and also when the sky was cloudy—they were not as accurate; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making the reading of the clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued to be made in the following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze. Between 270 and 500, Hellenistic (Ctesibius, Hero of Alexandria, Archimedes) and Roman horologists and astronomers began developing more elaborate mechanized water clocks. The added complexity was aimed at regulating the flow and at providing fancier displays of the passage of time. For example, some water clocks rang bells and gongs, while others opened doors and windows to show figurines of people, or moved pointers, and dials. Some even displayed astrological models of the universe. Although the Greeks and Romans did much to advance water clock technology, they still continued to use shadow clocks. The mathematician and astronomer Theodosius of Bithynia, for example, is said to have invented a universal sundial that was accurate anywhere on Earth, though little is known about it. Others wrote of the sundial in the mathematics and literature of the period. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman author of De Architectura, wrote on the mathematics of gnomons, or sundial blades. During the reign of Emperor Augustus, the Romans constructed the largest sundial ever built, the Solarium Augusti. Its gnomon was an obelisk from Heliopolis. Similarly, the obelisk from Campus Martius was used as the gnomon for Augustus's zodiacal sundial. Pliny the Elder records that the first sundial in Rome arrived in 264, looted from Catania, Sicily; according to him, it gave the incorrect time until the markings and angle appropriate for Rome's latitude were used—a century later.Barnett, p. 21 Ancient and medieval Persia Ancient Persian clock. Ancient Persian clock Reconstruction of the scene of a water clock manager (MirAab), Iran According to Callisthenes, the Persians were using water clocks in 328 to ensure a just and exact distribution of water from qanats to their shareholders for agricultural irrigation. The use of water clocks in Iran, especially in Zeebad, dates back to 500. Later they were also used to determine the exact holy days of pre-Islamic religions, such as the Nowruz, Chelah, or Yaldā—the shortest, longest, and equal-length days and nights of the years. The water clocks used in Iran were one of the most practical ancient tools for timing the yearly calendar.Conference of Qanat in Iran – water clock in Persia 1383, in Persian Water clocks, or Fenjaan, in Persia reached a level of accuracy comparable to today's standards of timekeeping. The fenjaan was the most accurate and commonly used timekeeping device for calculating the amount or the time that a farmer must take water from a qanat or well for irrigation of the farms, until it was replaced by more accurate current clock. Persian water clocks were a practical and useful tool for the qanat's shareholders to calculate the length of time they could divert water to their farm. The qanat was the only water source for agriculture and irrigation so a just and fair water distribution was very important. Therefore, a very fair and clever old person was elected to be the manager of the water clock, and at least two full-time managers were needed to control and observe the number of fenjaans and announce the exact time during the days and nights.سايه‌ي شهرداري نجف‌آباد بر كهن‌ترين «ساعت آبي»‌ شهر Amordad News (in Persian) The fenjaan was a big pot full of water and a bowl with small hole in the center. When the bowl become full of water, it would sink into the pot, and the manager would empty the bowl and again put it on the top of the water in the pot. He would record the number of times the bowl sank by putting small stones into a jar. The place where the clock was situated, and its managers, were collectively known as khaneh fenjaan. Usually this would be the top floor of a public-house, with west- and east-facing windows to show the time of sunset and sunrise. There was also another time-keeping tool named a staryab or astrolabe, but it was mostly used for superstitious beliefs and was not practical for use as a farmers' calendar. The Zeebad Gonabad water clock was in use until 1965 when it was substituted by modern clocks. Ancient and medieval China Joseph Needham speculated that the introduction of the outflow clepsydra to China, perhaps from Mesopotamia, occurred as far back as the 2nd millennium, during the Shang Dynasty, and at the latest by the 1st millennium. By the beginning of the Han Dynasty, in 202, the outflow clepsydra was gradually replaced by the inflow clepsydra, which featured an indicator rod on a float. To compensate for the falling pressure head in the reservoir, which slowed timekeeping as the vessel filled, Zhang Heng added an extra tank between the reservoir and the inflow vessel. Around 550 AD, Yin Gui was the first in China to write of the overflow or constant-level tank added to the series, which was later described in detail by the inventor Shen Kuo. Around 610, this design was trumped by two Sui Dynasty inventors, Geng Xun and Yuwen Kai, who were the first to create the balance clepsydra, with standard positions for the steelyard balance. Joseph Needham states that: Timekeeping innovations in medieval and pre-modern periods The term 'clock' encompasses a wide spectrum of devices, ranging from wristwatches to the Clock of the Long Now. The English word clock is said to derive from the Middle English clokke, Old North French cloque, or Middle Dutch clocke, all of which mean bell, and are derived from the Medieval Latin clocca, also meaning bell. Indeed, bells were used to mark the passage of time; they marked the passage of the hours at sea and in abbeys. Throughout history, clocks have had a variety of power sources, including gravity, springs, and electricity. Mechanical clocks became widespread in the 14th century, when they were used in medieval monasteries to keep the regulated schedule of prayers. The clock continued to be improved, with the first pendulum clock being designed and built in the 17th century. Candle clocks A candle clock The earliest mention of candle clocks comes from a Chinese poem, written in 520 by You Jianfu. According to the poem, the graduated candle was a means of determining time at night. Similar candles were used in Japan until the early 10th century. The candle clock most commonly mentioned and written of is attributed to King Alfred the Great. It consisted of six candles made from 72 pennyweights of wax, each high, and of uniform thickness, marked every inch (2.54 cm). As these candles burned for about four hours, each mark represented 20 minutes. Once lit, the candles were placed in wooden framed glass boxes, to prevent the flame from extinguishing. The most sophisticated candle clocks of their time were those of Al-Jazari in 1206. One of his candle clocks included a dial to display the time and, for the first time, employed a bayonet fitting, a fastening mechanism still used in modern times. Donald Routledge Hill described Al-Jazari's candle clocks as follows: An oil-lamp clock A variation on this theme were oil-lamp clocks. These early timekeeping devices consisted of a graduated glass reservoir to hold oil—usually whale oil, which burned cleanly and evenly—supplying the fuel for a built-in lamp. As the level in the reservoir dropped, it provided a rough measure of the passage of time. Incense clocks In addition to water, mechanical, and candle clocks, incense clocks were used in the Far East, and were fashioned in several different forms.Richards, p. 52 Incense clocks were first used in China around the 6th century; in Japan, one still exists in the Shōsōin, although its characters are not Chinese, but Devanagari. Due to their frequent use of Devanagari characters, suggestive of their use in Buddhist ceremonies, Edward H. Schafer speculated that incense clocks were invented in India. Although similar to the candle clock, incense clocks burned evenly and without a flame; therefore, they were more accurate and safer for indoor use. Several types of incense clock have been found, the most common forms include the incense stick and incense seal. An incense stick clock was an incense stick with calibrations; most were elaborate, sometimes having threads, with weights attached, at even intervals. The weights would drop onto a platter or gong below, signifying that a certain amount of time had elapsed. Some incense clocks were held in elegant trays; open-bottomed trays were also used, to allow the weights to be used together with the decorative tray.Levy, p. 18 Sticks of incense with different scents were also used, so that the hours were marked by a change in fragrance.Richards, p. 130 The incense sticks could be straight or spiraled; the spiraled ones were longer, and were therefore intended for long periods of use, and often hung from the roofs of homes and temples. In Japan, a geisha was paid for the number of senkodokei (incense sticks) that had been consumed while she was present, a practice which continued until 1924. Incense seal clocks were used for similar occasions and events as the stick clock; while religious purposes were of primary importance, these clocks were also popular at social gatherings, and were used by Chinese scholars and intellectuals.Bedini, pp. 103–104 The seal was a wooden or stone disk with one or more grooves etched in it into which incense was placed.Fraser, p. 52 These clocks were common in China, but were produced in fewer numbers in Japan. To signal the passage of a specific amount of time, small pieces of fragrant woods, resins, or different scented incenses could be placed on the incense powder trails. Different powdered incense clocks used different formulations of incense, depending on how the clock was laid out. The length of the trail of incense, directly related to the size of the seal, was the primary factor in determining how long the clock would last; all burned for long periods of time, ranging between 12 hours and a month.Bedini, p. 105Fraser, p. 56 While early incense seals were made of wood or stone, the Chinese gradually introduced disks made of metal, most likely beginning during the Song dynasty. This allowed craftsmen to more easily create both large and small seals, as well as design and decorate them more aesthetically. Another advantage was the ability to vary the paths of the grooves, to allow for the changing length of the days in the year. As smaller seals became more readily available, the clocks grew in popularity among the Chinese, and were often given as gifts.Bedini, pp. 104–106 Incense seal clocks are often sought by modern-day clock collectors; however, few remain that have not already been purchased or been placed on display at museums or temples.Bedini, p. 187 Sundials A 20th-century sundial in Seville, Andalusia, Spain Sundials had been used for timekeeping since ancient Egypt. Ancient dials were nodus-based with straight hour-lines that indicated unequal hours—also called temporary hours—that varied with the seasons. Every day was divided into 12 equal segments regardless of the time of year; thus, hours were shorter in winter and longer in summer. The sundial was further developed by Muslim astronomers. The idea of using hours of equal length throughout the year was the innovation of Abu'l-Hasan Ibn al-Shatir in 1371, based on earlier developments in trigonometry by Muhammad ibn Jābir al- Harrānī al-Battānī (Albategni). Ibn al-Shatir was aware that \\"using a gnomon that is parallel to the Earth's axis will produce sundials whose hour lines indicate equal hours on any day of the year\\". His sundial is the oldest polar- axis sundial still in existence. The concept appeared in Western sundials starting in 1446. Following the acceptance of heliocentrism and equal hours, as well as advances in trigonometry, sundials appeared in their present form during the Renaissance, when they were built in large numbers. In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c. 1620) discusses how to construct sundials. Hourglass Since the hourglass was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338.Frugoni p. 83 From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first dependable, reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown, but does not seem to have been used in China before the mid 16th century,see notes fig. 995 Plate CDXV in Science and Civilization in China, Volume 4 part 3, Joseph Needham, 1971, Cambridge University Press, Library of Congress Catalogue Card Number: 54-4723 and the hourglass implies the use of glassblowing, which appears to be an entirely European and Western art.Science and Civilization in China, Volume 4-3, Joseph Needham, 1971, Cambridge University Press, page 570 Clocks with gears and escapements The earliest instance of a liquid-driven escapement was described by the Greek engineer Philo of Byzantium (fl. 3rd century) in his technical treatise Pneumatics (chapter 31) where he likens the escapement mechanism of a washstand automaton with those as employed in (water) clocks. Another early clock to use escapements was built during the 7th century in Chang'an, by Tantric monk and mathematician, Yi Xing, and government official Liang Lingzan. An astronomical instrument that served as a clock, it was discussed in a contemporary text as follows: > [It] was made in the image of the round heavens and on it were shown the > lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly > circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, > rotating it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, > there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the > sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit > ... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the > horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact > determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying > and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon > surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell > being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten > automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about > by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and shafts, hooks, > pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually. The original diagram of Su Song's book showing the inner workings of his clock tower Since Yi Xing's clock was a water clock, it was affected by temperature variations. That problem was solved in 976 by Zhang Sixun by replacing the water with mercury, which remains liquid down to . Zhang implemented the changes into his clock tower, which was about tall, with escapements to keep the clock turning and bells to signal every quarter-hour. Another noteworthy clock, the elaborate Cosmic Engine, was built by Su Song, in 1088. It was about the size of Zhang's tower, but had an automatically rotating armillary sphere—also called a celestial globe—from which the positions of the stars could be observed. It also featured five panels with mannequins ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times. Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive in horology. Originally built in the capital of Kaifeng, it was dismantled by the Jin army and sent to the capital of Yanjing (now Beijing), where they were unable to put it back together. As a result, Su Song's son Su Xie was ordered to build a replica. Drawing of the Jayrun Water Clock in Damascus from the treatise On the Construction of Clocks and their Use (1203) The clock towers built by Zhang Sixun and Su Song, in the 10th and 11th centuries, respectively, also incorporated a striking clock mechanism, the use of clock jacks to sound the hours.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, p. 165 A striking clock outside of China was the Jayrun Water Clock, at the Umayyad Mosque in Damascus, Syria, which struck once every hour. It was constructed by Muhammad al-Sa'ati in the 12th century, and later described by his son Ridwan ibn al- Sa'ati, in his On the Construction of Clocks and their Use (1203), when repairing the clock. In 1235, an early monumental water-powered alarm clock that \\"announced the appointed hours of prayer and the time both by day and by night\\" was completed in the entrance hall of the Mustansiriya Madrasah in Baghdad. The first geared clock was invented in the 11th century by the Arab engineer Ibn Khalaf al-Muradi in Islamic Iberia; it was a water clock that employed a complex gear train mechanism, including both segmental and epicyclic gearing, capable of transmitting high torque. The clock was unrivalled in its use of sophisticated complex gearing, until the mechanical clocks of the mid-14th century. Al-Muradi's clock also employed the use of mercury in its hydraulic linkages, which could function mechanical automata. Al-Muradi's work was known to scholars working under Alfonso X of Castile, hence the mechanism may have played a role in the development of the European mechanical clocks. Other monumental water clocks constructed by medieval Muslim engineers also employed complex gear trains and arrays of automata. Like the earlier Greeks and Chinese, Arab engineers at the time also developed a liquid-driven escapement mechanism which they employed in some of their water clocks. Heavy floats were used as weights and a constant-head system was used as an escapement mechanism,Hassan, Ahmad Y, Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering, History of Science and Technology in Islam which was present in the hydraulic controls they used to make heavy floats descend at a slow and steady rate.Donald Routledge Hill (1996), \\"Engineering\\", p. 794, in Rashed & Morelon (1996) pp. 751–95 A mercury clock, described in the Libros del saber de Astronomia, a Spanish work from 1277 consisting of translations and paraphrases of Arabic works, is sometimes quoted as evidence for Muslim knowledge of a mechanical clock. However, the device was actually a compartmented cylindrical water clock,Silvio A. Bedini (1962), \\"The Compartmented Cylindrical Clepsydra\\", Technology and Culture, Vol. 3, No. 2, pp. 115–141 (116–118) which the Jewish author of the relevant section, Rabbi Isaac, constructed using principles described by a philosopher named \\"Iran\\", identified with Heron of Alexandria (fl. 1st century AD), on how heavy objects may be lifted. Clock towers Clock towers in Western Europe in the Middle Ages were also sometimes striking clocks. The most famous original still standing is possibly St Mark's Clock on the top of St Mark's Clocktower in St Mark's Square in Venice, assembled in 1493 by the clockmaker Gian Carlo Rainieri from Reggio Emilia. In 1497, Simone Campanato moulded the great bell on which every definite time-lapse is beaten by two mechanical bronze statues (h. 2,60 m.) called Due Mori (Two Moors), handling a hammer. Possibly earlier (1490) is the Prague Astronomical Clock by clockmaster Jan Růže (also called Hanuš)—according to another source this device was assembled as early as 1410 by clockmaker Mikuláš of Kadaň and mathematician Jan Šindel. The allegorical parade of animated sculptures rings on the hour every day. Astronomical clocks Astrolabes were used as astronomical clocks by Muslim astronomers at mosques and observatories. During the 11th century in the Song Dynasty, the Chinese astronomer, horologist and mechanical engineer Su Song created a water-driven astronomical clock for his clock tower of Kaifeng City. It incorporated an escapement mechanism as well as the earliest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, which drove the armillary sphere. Contemporary Muslim astronomers also constructed a variety of highly accurate astronomical clocks for use in their mosques and observatories, such as the water-powered astronomical clock by Al-Jazari in 1206, and the astrolabic clock by Ibn al-Shatir in the early 14th century. The most sophisticated timekeeping astrolabes were the geared astrolabe mechanisms designed by Abū Rayhān Bīrūnī in the 11th century and by Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr in the 13th century. These devices functioned as timekeeping devices and also as calendars. Castle clock by Al-Jazari, 14th-century illustration A sophisticated water-powered astronomical clock was built by Al-Jazari in 1206. This castle clock was a complex device that was about high, and had multiple functions alongside timekeeping. It included a display of the zodiac and the solar and lunar paths, and a pointer in the shape of the crescent moon which travelled across the top of a gateway, moved by a hidden cart and causing doors to open, each revealing a mannequin, every hour.Routledge Hill, Donald, \\"Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East\\", Scientific American, May 1991, pp. 64–9 (cf. Donald Routledge Hill, Mechanical Engineering) Howard R. Turner (1997), Science in Medieval Islam: An Illustrated Introduction, p. 184. University of Texas Press, . It was possible to reset the length of day and night in order to account for the changing lengths of day and night throughout the year. This clock also featured a number of automata including falcons and musicians who automatically played music when moved by levers operated by a hidden camshaft attached to a water wheel. Early mechanical clocks and watches The astronomical clock of St Albans Abbey, built by its abbot, Richard of Wallingford, circa 1380. British Library, London. The earliest medieval European clockmakers were Catholic monks. Medieval religious institutions required clocks because they regulated daily prayer- and work- schedules strictly, using various types of time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, they were often wound at least twice a day to ensure accuracy.Usher, p. 194 Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or by rotating beater. Although the mortuary inscription of Pacificus, archdeacon of Verona, records that he constructed a night clock (horologium nocturnum) as early as 850,\\"A history of mechanical inventions\\", Abbott Payson Usher(1929), p.192 \\" his clock has been identified as being an observation tube used to locate stars with an accompanying book of astronomical observations, rather than a mechanical or water clock, an interpretation supported by illustrations from medieval manuscripts.Gerhard Dohrn-van Rossum, History of the Hour: Clocks and Modern Temporal Orders, (University of Chicago Press, 1996), p 54. St. Gallen, Stiftsbibliothek, Cod. Sang. 18: Composite manuscript, astronomical clock of Pacificus of Verona The religious necessities and technical skill of the medieval monks were crucial factors in the development of clocks, as the historian Thomas Woods writes: Louis de Bruges in front of an astronomical clock. Henri Suso, Horloge de Sapience, 1470-1480 The appearance of clocks in writings of the 11th century implies that they were well known in Europe in that period.Reid, p. 4 In the early 14th-century, the Florentine poet Dante Alighieri referred to a clock in his Paradiso;\\"Then, as a horologe that calleth us / What time the Bride of God is rising up\\". the first known literary reference to a clock that struck the hours. Giovanni da Dondi, Professor of Astronomy at Padua, presented the earliest detailed description of clockwork in his 1364 treatise Il Tractatus Astrarii.Davies, Norman; p. 434 This has inspired several modern replicas, including some in London's Science Museum and the Smithsonian Institution. Other notable examples from this period were built in Milan (1335), Strasbourg (1354), Rouen (1389), Lund (c. 1425) and Prague (1462). Salisbury Cathedral clock, dating from about 1386, is one of the oldest working clocks in the world, and may be the oldest. It still has most of its original parts, although its original verge and foliot timekeeping mechanism is lost, having been converted to a pendulum, which was replaced by a replica verge in 1956. It has no dial, as its purpose was to strike a bell at precise times. The wheels and gears are mounted in an open, box-like iron frame, measuring about square. The framework is held together with metal dowels and pegs. Two large stones, hanging from pulleys, supply the power. As the weights fall, ropes unwind from the wooden barrels. One barrel drives the main wheel, which is regulated by the escapement, and the other drives the striking mechanism and the air brake. Note also Peter Lightfoot's Wells Cathedral clock, constructed c. 1390. The dial represents a geocentric view of the universe, with the Sun and Moon revolving around a central fixed Earth. It is unique in having its original medieval face, showing a philosophical model of the pre-Copernican universe. Above the clock is a set of figures, which hit the bells, and a set of jousting knights who revolve around a track every 15 minutes. The clock was converted to pendulum-and-anchor escapement in the 17th century, and was installed in London's Science Museum in 1884, where it continues to operate. Similar astronomical clocks, or horologes, survive at Exeter, Ottery St Mary, and Wimborne Minster. The face of the Prague Astronomical Clock (1462) One clock that has not survived is that of the Abbey of St Albans, built by the 14th-century abbot Richard of Wallingford. It may have been destroyed during Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries, but the abbot's notes on its design have allowed a full-scale reconstruction. As well as keeping time, the astronomical clock could accurately predict lunar eclipses, and may have shown the Sun, Moon (age, phase, and node), stars and planets, as well as a wheel of fortune, and an indicator of the state of the tide at London Bridge. According to Thomas Woods, \\"a clock that equaled it in technological sophistication did not appear for at least two centuries\\".Woods, p. 36Macey, p. 130 Giovanni de Dondi was another early mechanical clockmaker whose clock did not survive, but his work has been replicated based on the designs. De Dondi's clock was a seven-faced construction with 107 moving parts, showing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and five planets, as well as religious feast days. Around this period, mechanical clocks were introduced into abbeys and monasteries to mark important events and times, gradually replacing water clocks which had served the same purpose. During the Middle Ages, clocks primarily served religious purposes; the first employed for secular timekeeping emerged around the 15th century. In Dublin, the official measurement of time became a local custom, and by 1466 a public clock stood on top of the Tholsel (the city court and council chamber).Clarke, p. 60 It was the first of its kind to be clearly recorded in Ireland, and would only have had an hour hand. The increasing lavishness of castles led to the introduction of turret clocks.Bottomley, p. 34 A 1435 example survives from Leeds castle; its face is decorated with the images of the Crucifixion of Jesus, Mary and St George. Early clock dials showed hours: the display of minutes and seconds evolved later. A clock with a minutes dial is mentioned in a 1475 manuscript, and clocks indicating minutes and seconds existed in Germany in the 15th century.p. 209, A history of mechanical inventions, Abbott Payson Usher, Courier Dover Publications, 1988, . Timepieces which indicated minutes and seconds were occasionally made from this time on, but this was not common until the increase in accuracy made possible by the pendulum clock and, in watches, by the spiral balance spring. The 16th-century astronomer Tycho Brahe used clocks with minutes and seconds to observe stellar positions.p. 529, \\"Time and timekeeping instruments\\", History of astronomy: an encyclopedia, John Lankford, Taylor & Francis, 1997, . A watch drawn in the scientific journal Acta Eruditorum in 1737. The Ottoman engineer Taqi al-Din described a weight-driven clock with a verge-and-foliot escapement, a striking train of gears, an alarm, and a representation of the moon's phases in his book The Brightest Stars for the Construction of Mechanical Clocks (Al-Kawākib al-durriyya fī wadh' al-bankāmat al-dawriyya), written around 1556.Ahmad Y al-Hassan & Donald R. Hill (1986), \\"Islamic Technology\\", Cambridge, , p. 59 =Wristwatch= One of the earliest references to a wristwatch – an 'arm watch' given to Queen Elizabeth I by her favourite Robert Dudley. The concept of the wristwatch goes back to the production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was not just a matter of fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely in the pocket. When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women. Wristwatches were first worn by military men towards the end of the nineteenth century, when the importance of synchronizing manoeuvres during war without potentially revealing the plan to the enemy through signalling was increasingly recognized. It was clear that using pocket watches while in the heat of battle or while mounted on a horse was impractical, so officers began to strap the watches to their wrist. The Garstin Company of London patented a 'Watch Wristlet' design in 1893, although they were probably producing similar designs from the 1880s. Clearly, a market for men's wristwatches was coming into being at the time. Officers in the British Army began using wristwatches during colonial military campaigns in the 1880s, such as during the Anglo-Burma War of 1885. During the Boer War, the importance of coordinating troop movements and synchronizing attacks against the highly mobile Boer insurgents was paramount, and the use of wristwatches subsequently became widespread among the officer class. The company Mappin & Webb began production of their successful 'campaign watch' for soldiers during the campaign at the Sudan in 1898 and ramped up production for the Boer War a few years later. Passchendaele – a tactic that required precise synchronisation between the artillery and infantry. These early models were essentially standard pocket-watches fitted to a leather strap, but by the early 20th century, manufacturers began producing purpose-built wristwatches. The Swiss company, Dimier Frères & Cie patented a wristwatch design with the now standard wire lugs in 1903. In 1904, Alberto Santos- Dumont, an early aviator, asked his friend, a French watchmaker called Louis Cartier, to design a watch that could be useful during his flights. Hans Wilsdorf moved to London in 1905 and set up his own business with his brother- in-law Alfred Davis, Wilsdorf & Davis, providing quality timepieces at affordable prices—the company later became Rolex.Rolex Jubilee Vade Mecum published by the Rolex Watch Company in 1946. Wilsdorf was an early convert to the wristwatch, and contracted the Swiss firm Aegler to produce a line of wristwatches. His Rolex wristwatch of 1910 became the first such watch to receive certification as a chronometer in Switzerland and it went on to win an award in 1914 from Kew Observatory in Richmond, west London. The impact of the First World War dramatically shifted public perceptions on the propriety of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed in the air as much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917. left The company H. Williamson Ltd., based in Coventry, was one of the first to capitalize on this opportunity. During the company's 1916 AGM it was noted that \\"...the public is buying the practical things of life. Nobody can truthfully contend that the watch is a luxury. It is said that one soldier in every four wears a wristlet watch, and the other three mean to get one as soon as they can.\\" By the end of the War, almost all enlisted men wore a wristwatch, and after they were demobilized, the fashion soon caught on—the British Horological Journal wrote in 1917 that \\"...the wristlet watch was little used by the sterner sex before the war, but now is seen on the wrist of nearly every man in uniform and of many men in civilian attire.\\" Within a decade, sales of wristwatches had outstripped those of pocket watches. =Equation clock= In the late 17th and 18th Centuries, equation clocks were made, which allowed the user to see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a sundial. Before the invention of the pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on the time of year. Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums. Era of precision timekeeping The Dutch polymath and horologist Christiaan Huygens, the originator of the era of precision timekeeping,Macey, Samuel L. (ed.): Encyclopedia of Time. (NYC: Garland Publishing, 1994, ); in Clocks and Watches: The Leap to Precision by William J. H. Andrewes, p. 123–127 was \\"the most ingenious watchmaker of all time\\" (in Arnold Sommerfeld's own words).Gindikin, Simon; Shuchat, Alan (2007). Tales of Mathematicians and Physicists, p. 79 Pendulum clock Innovations to the mechanical clock continued, with miniaturization leading to domestic clocks in the 15th century, and personal watches in the 16th. In the 1580s, the Italian polymath Galileo Galilei investigated the regular swing of the pendulum, and discovered that it could be used to regulate a clock. Although Galileo studied the pendulum as early as 1582, he never actually constructed a clock based on that design. The first pendulum clock was designed and built by Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens, in 1656. Early versions erred by less than one minute per day, and later ones only by 10 seconds, very accurate for their time. In England, the manufacturing of pendulum clocks was soon taken up. The longcase clock (also known as the grandfather clock) was first created to house the pendulum and works by the English clockmaker William Clement in 1670 or 1671; this became feasible after Clement invented the anchor escapement mechanism in about 1670. Before then, pendulum clocks used the older verge escapement mechanism, which required very wide pendulum swings of about 100°. To avoid the need for a very large case, most clocks using the verge escapement had a short pendulum. The anchor mechanism, however, reduced the pendulum's necessary swing to between 4° to 6°, allowing clockmakers to use longer pendulums with consequently slower beats. These required less power to move, caused less friction and wear, and were more accurate than their shorter predecessors. Most longcase clocks use a pendulum about a metre (39 inches) long to the center of the bob, with each swing taking one second. This requirement for height, along with the need for a long drop space for the weights that power the clock, gave rise to the tall, narrow case. Clement also introduced the pendulum suspension spring in 1671. The concentric minute hand was added to the clock by Daniel Quare, a London clock-maker, and the Second Hand was introduced. The Jesuits were another major contributor to the development of pendulum clocks in the 17th and 18th centuries, having had an \\"unusually keen appreciation of the importance of precision\\".Woods, pp. 100–101Woods, p. 103 In measuring an accurate one-second pendulum, for example, the Italian astronomer Father Giovanni Battista Riccioli persuaded nine fellow Jesuits \\"to count nearly 87,000 oscillations in a single day\\". They served a crucial role in spreading and testing the scientific ideas of the period, and collaborated with contemporary scientists, such as Huygens. Spiral-hairspring watch Drawing of one of his first balance springs, attached to a balance wheel, by Christiaan Huygens, published in his letter in the Journal des Sçavants of February 25, 1675. The application of the spiral balance spring (spiral hairspring) for watches ushered in a new era of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. A mechanical watch movement. From its invention in 1675 by Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, is still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today. Like pendulum clocks, spiral-hairspring watches were early precision timekeeping devices. The invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century allowed portable clocks to be built, evolving into the first pocketwatches by the 17th century, but these were not very accurate until the balance spring was added to the balance wheel in the mid 17th century. Some dispute remains as to whether British scientist Robert Hooke (his was a straight spring) or Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens was the actual inventor of the balance spring. Huygens was clearly the first to use a spiral balance spring, the form used in virtually all watches to the present day. The addition of the balance spring made the balance wheel a harmonic oscillator like the pendulum in a pendulum clock, which oscillated at a fixed resonant frequency and resisted oscillating at other rates. This innovation increased watches' accuracy enormously, reducing error from perhaps several hours per day to perhaps 10 minutes per day, resulting in the addition of the minute hand to the watch face around 1680 in Britain and 1700 in France. Like the invention of pendulum clock, Huygens' spiral hairspring (balance spring) system of portable timekeepers, helped lay the foundations for the modern watchmaking industry. The application of the spiral balance spring for watches ushered in a new era of accuracy for portable timekeepers, similar to that which the pendulum had introduced for clocks. From its invention in 1675 by Christiaan Huygens, the spiral hairspring (balance spring) system for portable timekeepers, still used in mechanical watchmaking industry today. Pocket watch In 1675, Huygens and Robert Hooke invented the spiral balance, or the hairspring, designed to control the oscillating speed of the balance wheel. This crucial advance finally made accurate pocket watches possible. This resulted in a great advance in accuracy of pocket watches, from perhaps several hours per day to 10 minutes per day, similar to the effect of the pendulum upon mechanical clocks. The great English clockmaker, Thomas Tompion, was one of the first to use this mechanism successfully in his pocket watches, and he adopted the minute hand which, after a variety of designs were trialled, eventually stabilized into the modern-day configuration. The Rev. Edward Barlow invented the rack and snail striking mechanism for striking clocks, which was a great improvement over the previous mechanism. The repeating clock, that chimes the number of hours (or even minutes) was invented by either Quare or Barlow in 1676. George Graham invented the deadbeat escapement for clocks in 1720. Marine chronometer Harrison's H4 chronometer of 1761, published in The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper, 1767.The principles of Mr Harrison's time-keeper Marine chronometers are clocks used at sea as time standards, to determine longitude by celestial navigation. A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would have to keep the time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship. A twin-barrel box chronometer. After the Scilly naval disaster of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent to millions of pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks. In 1735 Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat. The chronometer was trialled in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds. Electric clock One of Alexander Bain's early electromagnetic clocks, from the 1840s In 1815, Sir Francis Ronalds (1788–1873) of London published the forerunner of the electric clock, the electrostatic clock. It was powered with dry piles, a high voltage battery with extremely long life but the disadvantage of its electrical properties varying with the weather. He trialled various means of regulating the electricity and these models proved to be reliable across a range of meteorological conditions. Alexander Bain, a Scottish clock and instrument maker, was the first to invent and patent the electric clock in 1840. On January 11, 1841, Alexander Bain along with John Barwise, a chronometer maker, took out another important patent describing a clock in which an electromagnetic pendulum and an electric current is employed to keep the clock going instead of springs or weights. Later patents expanded on his original ideas. Quartz clock and watch Internal construction of a modern high performance HC-49 package quartz crystal oscillator. The piezoelectric properties of crystalline quartz were discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. The first quartz crystal oscillator was built by Walter G. Cady in 1921, and in 1927 the first quartz clock was built by Warren Marrison and J. W. Horton at Bell Telephone Laboratories in Canada.Marrison, vol. 27 pp. 510–588 The following decades saw the development of quartz clocks as precision time measurement devices in laboratory settings—the bulky and delicate counting electronics, built with vacuum tubes, limited their practical use elsewhere. In 1932, a quartz clock able to measure small weekly variations in the rotation rate of the Earth was developed. The National Bureau of Standards (now NIST) based the time standard of the United States on quartz clocks from late 1929 until the 1960s, when it changed to atomic clocks. In 1969, Seiko produced the world's first quartz wristwatch, the Astron. Their inherent accuracy and low cost of production has resulted in the subsequent proliferation of quartz clocks and watches. Atomic clock Atomic clocks are the most accurate timekeeping devices in practical use today. Accurate to within a few seconds over many thousands of years, they are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments. The idea of using atomic transitions to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879,Sir William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and Peter Guthrie Tait, Treatise on Natural Philosophy, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1879), vol. 1, part 1, page 227. although it was only in the 1930s with the development of magnetic resonance that there was a practical method for doing this. A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept. The first accurate atomic clock, a caesium standard based on a certain transition of the caesium-133 atom, was built by Louis Essen in 1955 at the National Physical Laboratory in the UK. Calibration of the caesium standard atomic clock was carried out by the use of the astronomical time scale ephemeris time (ET). The International System of Units standardized its unit of time, the second, on the properties of cesium in 1967. SI defines the second as 9,192,631,770 cycles of the radiation which corresponds to the transition between two electron spin energy levels of the ground state of the 133Cs atom. The cesium atomic clock, maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, is accurate to 30 billionths of a second per year. Atomic clocks have employed other elements, such as hydrogen and rubidium vapor, offering greater stability—in the case of hydrogen clocks—and smaller size, lower power consumption, and thus lower cost (in the case of rubidium clocks). Clock and watch-making industry A pocket watch The first professional clockmakers came from the guilds of locksmiths and jewellers. Clockmaking developed from a specialized craft into a mass production industry over many years. Paris and Blois were the early centres of clockmaking in France. French clockmakers such as Julien Le Roy, clockmaker of Versailles, were leaders in case design and ornamental clocks.Davies, Norman; p. 435 Le Roy belonged to the fifth generation of a family of clockmakers, and was described by his contemporaries as \\"the most skillful clockmaker in France, possibly in Europe\\". He invented a special repeating mechanism which improved the precision of clocks and watches, a face that could be opened to view the inside clockwork, and made or supervised over 3,500 watches. The competition and scientific rivalry resulting from his discoveries further encouraged researchers to seek new methods of measuring time more accurately. Clockmakers came to the American colonies from England and Holland during the early 1600s. Among the earliest known clockmakers in the colonies were Thomas Nash of New Haven, Connecticut (1638), William Davis of Boston (1683), Edvardus Bogardus of New York City (1698) and James Baterson of Boston (1707). Dallas Museum of ArtTall-case striking clock constructed in Boston by Benjamin Bagnall, Sr., between 1730 and 1745 (2017) Connecticut clockmakers were crafting striking clocks throughout the 1600s. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City holds in its collections a tall-case striking clock that Benjamin Bagnall, Sr., constructed in Boston before 1740 and that Elisha Williams probably acquired between 1725 and 1739 while he was rector of Yale College. The Dallas Museum of Art holds in its collections a similar striking clock made entirely of American parts that Bagnall constructed in Boston between 1730 and 1745.(1) (2) During the 1600s, when metal was harder to come by in the colonies than wood, works for many American clocks were made of wood, including the gears, which were whittled and fashioned by hand, as were all other parts. There is some evidence that wooden clocks were being made as early as 1715 near New Haven, Connecticut.Bedini, 1964: Instruments of Wood: The Use of Wood, pp. 66-69. \\"Wooden clocks were made as early as the 17th century in Germany and Holland, and they were known in England in the early 18th century. In the Colonies the wooden clock was first produced in Connecticut, and the earliest type was associated with Hartford County. ....\\" Benjamin Cheney of East Hartford, Connecticut, was producing wooden striking clocks by 1745.(1) (2) (3) Image and description of wooden movement of clock constructed by Benjamin Cheney around 1760 on exhibit in 2015 in Clock Gallery of Old Sturbridge Village: In (4) David Rittenhouse constructed a clock with wooden gears around 1749 while living on a farm near Philadelphia at the age of 17.(1) (2) (3) Between 1794 and 1795, in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the French government briefly mandated decimal clocks, with a day divided into 10 hours of 100 minutes each.Alder, pp. 149–150 The astronomer and mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace, among other individuals, modified the dial of his pocket watch to decimal time. A clock in the Palais des Tuileries kept decimal time as late as 1801, but the cost of replacing all the nation's clocks prevented decimal clocks from becoming widespread.Alder, pp. 150–162 Because decimalized clocks only helped astronomers rather than ordinary citizens, it was one of the most unpopular changes associated with the metric system, and it was abandoned. In Germany, Nuremberg and Augsburg were the early clockmaking centers, and the Black Forest came to specialize in wooden cuckoo clocks. An antique pocket watch movement, from an 1891 encyclopedia. The English became the predominant clockmakers of the 17th and 18th centuries. The main centres of the British industry were in the City of London, the West End of London, Soho where many skilled French Huguenots settled and later in Clerkenwell. The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers was established in 1631 as one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. Thomas Tompion was the first English clockmaker with an international reputation and many of his pupils went on to become great horologists in their own right, such as George Graham who invented the deadbeat escapement, orrery and mercury pendulum, and his pupil Thomas Mudge who created the first lever escapement. Famous clockmakers of this period included Joseph Windmills, Simon de Charmes who established the De Charmes clockmaker firm and Christopher Pinchbeck who invented the alloy pinchbeck. Later famous horologists included John Arnold who made the first practical and accurate modern watch by refining Harrison's chronometer, Thomas Earnshaw who was the first to make these available to the public, Daniel Quare, who invented a repeating watch movement, a portable barometer and introduced the concentric minute hand. Quality control and standards were imposed on clockmakers by the Worshipful Company of Clockmakers, a guild which licensed clockmakers for doing business. By the rise of consumerism in the late 18th century, clocks, especially pocket watches, became regarded as fashion accessories and were made in increasingly decorative styles. By 1796, the industry reached a high point with almost 200,000 clocks being produced annually in London, however by the mid-19th century the industry had gone into steep decline from Swiss competition. Switzerland established itself as a clockmaking center following the influx of Huguenot craftsmen, and in the 19th century, the Swiss industry \\"gained worldwide supremacy in high-quality machine-made watches\\". The leading firm of the day was Patek Philippe, founded by Antoni Patek of Warsaw and Adrien Philippe of Bern.

History Gilla was discovered by German producer Frank Farian who got her signed to Hansa Records in 1974. After an unsuccessful German cover version \\"Mir ist kein Weg zu weit\\" of Marcella Bella's Italian hit single \\"Nessuno mai\\", Farian had her record a German disco version of Labelle's \\"Lady Marmalade\\". Despite being a modest hit (#24), it caused some attention of being the first German record to feature such explicit lyrics as \\"Willst du mit mir schlafen gehn?\\" (Do You Want To Go To Sleep With Me) (1975). It was followed later in the year with \\"Tu es\\" (also recorded in English as \\"Why Don't You Do It\\") which became Gilla's biggest hit, peaking at No. 10 in the German charts and giving Farian a commercial breakthrough as a producer. Gilla's debut LP, featuring a mix of disco, pop and schlager tracks, was released shortly after. In the summer of 1976, Gilla followed with \\"Ich brenne\\" (I'm Burning), once again also recorded in English as \\"Help Help\\". It was a Dutch hit single but fared less well in Germany. Farian remixed the track with his own vocals for inclusion on Boney M.'s Take the Heat Off Me to replace \\"Baby Do You Wanna Bump\\" in some territories. In early 1977, Gilla's second album Zieh mich aus (Undress Me) was released. Despite featuring German versions of Boney M.'s hit single \\"Sunny\\" and \\"No Woman No Cry\\", it fared poorly. The album also included the German version of a future hit for Boney M., \\"Belfast\\" which was originally written years earlier for Boney M. member Marcia Barrett. Gilla's first international album was released in the summer of 1977. Entitled Help Help, it featured her previous English recordings like \\"Why Don't You Do It\\" and \\"Help Help\\" + their B-sides, as well as English versions of songs from Zieh mich aus. \\"Gentlemen Callers not Allowed\\" (\\"Herrn-Besuche nicht erlaubt\\") was released as a single and promoted with Boney M.'s charismatic male dancer Bobby Farrell on a few TV shows but it was still only a minor success. In January 1978, Gilla released a disco-rock cover of The American Breed's \\"Bend Me, Shape Me\\". The single was a No. 11 hit in Switzerland and 73 in Australia. It was decided to repackage the Help Help album with the inclusion of the new track and its B-side \\"The River Sings\\" (\\"Der Strom der Zeit\\") in May, entitled Bend Me, Shape Me. Once again, it was only a minor seller. Singer Bruce Low released a big-selling German cover of Boney M.'s mega-hit \\"Rivers of Babylon\\" so Farian decided to have Gilla record a German cover of the follow-up single \\"Rasputin\\". Released in November 1978, it was a flop and not even included on the following compilation Star Discothek a few months later. Trying to repeat the success of \\"Bend Me, Shape Me\\", Gilla and her fiancé and co-producer Helmut Rulofs (who was also a recording artist under the name Chris Denning) released another disco-rock cover of The Animals's \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\" in March 1979. In 1980, her second English language album Cool Rock'n Roll was released including the title track single and \\"Go Down Mainstreet\\". Gilla and Rulofs, however, found bigger success when Farian recorded one of their songs with Boney M. \\"I See a Boat on the River\\" being a German Top 10 hit and a European hit single from the million-selling The Magic of Boney M. - 20 Golden Hits, Gilla credited as G. Winger (Winger being an abbreviation of her surname Wuchinger). In October 1981, Gilla's final single \\"Cigarillo\\" backed with a cover of \\"Friday on My Mind\\" was released before she retired from the music business. She made a brief return with Rulofs as the duo Sweet Mix in 1982 but their single \\"Susan Don't Cry for Me\\" came and went without notice. They also contributed the track \\"Video\\" for Precious Wilson's album All Coloured in Love that year. Being largely forgotten in Europe today, Gilla has in recent years performed regularly in Russia where her records are enjoying considerable popularity.

Oral and maxillofacial imaging includes cone beam CT, multislice CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, panoramic radiography, cephalometric imaging, intra-oral imaging (e.g. bitewing, peri-apical and occlusal radiographs) in addition to special tests like sialographs. Other modalities, including optical coherence tomography are also under development for dental imaging.  Training  United States OMFR or DMFR is one of nine dental specialties recognized by the American Dental Association. To become an Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist (OMFR) one must first complete a dental degree and then apply for and complete a postgraduate course of training (usually between 2–4 years in length). Training includes all aspects of radiation physics, radiation biology, radiation safety, radiologic technique, the patho-physiology of disease and interpretation of diagnostic images. The Commission on Dental Accreditation (CODA) accredited programs are a minimum of two years in length. Several CODA accredited programs in OMFR require the resident to complete a graduate degree (MS), whereas others allow the option of pursuing a concurrent PhD or MS degree. Following successful completion of this training the Oral and Maxillofacial Radiologist becomes Board eligible to challenge the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology examination. Successful completion of board certification results in Diplomat status in the American Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. Australia Australian programs are accredited by the Australian Dental Council (ADC) and are 3 years in length, culminating in either a master's degree (MDS or MPhil) or a Doctor of Clinical Dentistry degree (DClinDent). Currently, the only Australian institution offering specialist training in OMFR is The University Of Queensland. Programs are focused on clinical radiology and offer comprehensive training with registrars reporting plain film, Cone Beam CT, Multislice CT and MRI of the maxillofacial region. Fellowship (FRANZCR) can then be acquired through the Royal Australia New Zealand College of Radiologists and/or the Royal Australasian College of Dental Surgeons (FRACDS/MRACDS DMFR). Oral and maxillofacial radiologists in Australia tend to work in the private sector, reporting in medical radiology practices alongside medical radiologists. Canada Canadian programs are accredited by the Canadian Dental Association (CDAC) and are a minimum of two years in length and usually culminate with a Master of Science (MSc) degree. Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Fellowship exams with the Royal College of Dentists of Canada (FRCD (C)). United Kingdom Programs in the United Kingdom are 4 years in length and culminate in a Certificate in Completion of Specialty Training (CCST) and often a Master of Science degree (MSc). Graduates are then eligible to sit for the Diploma of Dental Radiology from the Royal College of Radiologists (FRCR DDR).  During COVID-19 outbreak  The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has brought substantial challenges to the world health system, including the practice of dental and maxillofacial radiology (DMFR). A recently published rapid communication has collected and evaluated all the best current evidence and published guidelines as well as professional recommendations to help maxillofacial radiologists and dental practitioners for safer radiological and imaging examinations on healthy, suspected, or confirmed COVID-19 patients during outbreak.Oral and Maxillofacial radiologists have an imperative role to play in the care of patients during COVID-19 pandemic. By managing relevant imaging strategies and infection control policies, radiologists, staff, and out- or inpatients will be safely protected from COVID-19 virus during outbreak. Digital imaging and tele-consultations are emphasized to reduce the risk of cross-infection. DMFR professionals should follow-up COVID-19 patients after recovery for possible acute or chronic sialoadenitis.

Umpiring career As was customary in his era, Walsh was the sole umpire in every game he called. After debuting in the National Association in September 1875, he umpired in the NL's first season in , with only Charles F. Daniels officiating more games, but he departed at the end of July before returning to work two games at the end of the season, then several games in and and much of the second half of the season. He moved to the American Association for the - campaigns when that league was established, and after one season as a manager he resumed his officiating work in and ; he also called a single game each in the and 1888 seasons. Among the highlights of his 11-year career were his games officiating three no-hitters, the first coming on September 11, 1882 by Tony Mullane. The second came a mere eight days later on September 19 when Guy Hecker tossed one; these were the first two no-hitters in the American Association, then in its first season. The third no-hitter occurred on July 24, 1886 when Adonis Terry threw the first of his two career no-hitters. Mullane's no-hitter for the Louisville Eclipse was nearly derailed in the ninth inning, however; with two out, Pop Snyder of the Cincinnati Red Stockings lofted a fly ball to center field, but John Reccius mishandled what should have been an easy catch. Snyder, now on first base, complained to Walsh that Mullane was bringing his arm above his shoulder when pitching, which was not permitted at the time. Walsh overruled the complaint, however, and Mullane got Dan \\"Ecky\\" Stearns to ground out to end the game. The game was also notable for another incident in the eighth inning; the American Association's rules at that time permitted a substitute to run for a batter who was injured, as long as both teams' captains consented, with the substitute standing behind home plate and prepared to run if the hitter made contact. Pete Browning, who had a pulled leg muscle and had not reached base in the game, batted what appeared to be a single into right field, but forgot the presence of the substitute (Hecker) and ran to first base as Hecker stopped in surprise. Snyder, the Cincinnati catcher, had pitcher Will White throw the ball to Stearns at first base, and Walsh immediately signaled an out, ruling that Hecker was the correct runner and had not reached first. The lost hit eventually resulted in Browning's final career batting average being .341 rather than .342; the higher average would have tied him with Dan Brouthers for the highest mark among players of the era before , when the pitching distance was extended from 50 to 60'6\\". Walsh also had his share of lowlights in the rough-and-tumble world of umpiring in the late 19th century. On July 13, 1882, during the 4th inning of the game between the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Baltimore Orioles‚ angry spectators encircled him after he made a controversial call, and he was forced to take refuge in the Baltimore clubhouse for 15 minutes. On September 14, he was assaulted by some young fans after a game in Brooklyn‚ but he escaped serious injury. Managerial career Walsh is currently credited with a managerial career which lasted one season, when he took the reins of the Louisville Eclipse for the season. He led the team to a 68-40 record and finished 3rd in the American Association standings. Although current reference works generally list him as the manager of the 1884 club, there has been some dispute as to the historical accuracy of that attribution; in 1997, historian David Nemec wrote: \\"At one time Macmillan listed Joe Gerhardt as Louisville's manager for part of the 1883 season and the first half of the 1884 season. Now both Macmillan and Total Baseball credit Gerhardt with managing Louisville during all of the 1883 season, but say Mike Walsh ran the club in 1884. That would be news to Pete Browning, Guy Hecker and everyone else from those days still keeping up on the game. Gerhardt ran the team on the field in 1884 until August, when he was replaced as captain. The local papers all made a big to-do of his being canned. Perhaps Walsh, a club official and ex-umpire, was the one who decided to axe Gerhardt and take on the job himself, but until it was a fait accompli the team was under Gerhardt's wing. Macmillan had it right originally.\\"Nemec, p. 29. Post-career Walsh died in Louisville, Kentucky at the age of 78, and is interred in that city's St. Louis Cemetery.

During his youth, growing up in Luxembourg, he developed a strong interest in insects under the influence of his father, Jos Hoffmann. This eventually resulted in the younger Hoffmann's dedication to the field of biology using insects as model organisms. He currently holds a faculty position at the University of Strasbourg. He is a research director and member of the board of administrators of the National Center of Scientific Research (CNRS) in Strasbourg, France. He was elected to the positions of Vice- President (2005-2006) and President (2007-2008) of the French Academy of Sciences. Hoffmann and Bruce Beutler were jointly awarded a half share of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for \\"their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity,\\". [More specifically, the work showing increased Drosomycin expression following activation of Toll pathway in microbial infection.] Hoffmann and Bruno Lemaitre discovered the function of the fruit fly Toll gene in innate immunity. Its mammalian homologs, the Toll- like receptors, were discovered by Beutler. Toll-like receptors identify constituents of other organisms like fungi and bacteria, and trigger an immune response, explaining, for example, how septic shock can be triggered by bacterial remains. Education Jules Hoffmann went to the Lycée de Garçons de Luxembourg before leaving to France. Hoffmann received undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry at the University of Strasbourg, France. In 1969, he completed his Ph.D. in biology also at the University of Strasbourg under Pierre Joly in Laboratory of General Biology at the Institute of Zoology. His post-doctoral training was at the Institut für Physiologische Chemie at Philipps-Universität in Marburg an der Lahn, Germany, in 1973–1974. Studies and Research Careers During his Ph.D. program under Pierre Joly, Hoffmann started his research in studying antimicrobial defenses in grasshoppers, inspired by the previous works done in the laboratory of Pierre Joly showing that no opportunistic infections were apparent in insects after the transplantation of certain organs from one to another. Hoffmann confirmed discovery of phagocytosis done by Eli Metchnikoff, through injection of Bacillus thuringiensis and observation of increase of phagocytes. In addition, he showed strong correlation between hematopoiesis and antimicrobial defenses by assessing the susceptibility of an insect to the microbial infection after X-ray treatment. Hoffmann shifts from using grasshopper model to using dipteran species in the 80s. By using Phormia terranovae, Hoffmann and his colleagues were able to identify 82-residues long antimicrobial polypeptide named Diptericin which was glycine-rich, along with other polypeptides in Drosophila melanogaster such as Defensin, Cecropin, and Attacin. Further molecular genetic analysis revealed that the promoters for the genes encoding these antimicrobial peptides contained DNA sequences similar to the binding elements for NF-κB in mammalian DNA. Dorsal gene, critical in dorso-ventral patterning in the early embryo of Drosophila melanogaster was also identified to be in this NF-κB family. It was initially speculated by Hoffmann and colleagues that activity of Dorsal was directly linked to the expression of the Diptericin gene. However, it turned out that Diptericin was normally induced even in the loss-of-function Dorsal mutants. Further conducted research showed that Diptericin expression was dependent on the expression of imd gene. Identification of another antifungal peptide named Drosomycin and RNA blots demonstrated that two distinct pathways(Toll, Imd) exist, involving Drosomycin and Diptericin respectively. Similarities of structure and function between several members in the Drosophila embryo and members in mammals being noted, study \\"The Dorsoventral Regulatory Gene Cassette spảtzle/Toll/cactus Controls the Potent Antifungal Response in Drosophila Adults\\" by Lemaitre and Hoffmann in 1996 illuminated the possible existing innate immunity in Drosophila in response to fungal challenge. Later works identified that Toll transmembrane receptors are present in a wide variety of phyla and are conserved through evolution along with conservation of NF-κB activating cascades. Hoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968, and became a research associate in 1969. Since 1974 he has been a Research Director of CNRS. Between 1978 and 2005 he was Director of the CNRS research unit \\"Immune Response and Development in Insects\\", and from 1994 to 2005 he was director of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of CNRS in Strasbourg. Hoffmann is a member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, the French Academy of Sciences, the Academia Europaea, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO), the United States National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Fondation Écologie d'Avenirhttp://fondationecologiedavenir.org/Conseil_Orientation.htm and the Russian Academy of Sciences. Hoffmann became a Commander of the Legion of Honour in 2012. In 2015, Hoffmann signed the Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change on the final day of the 65th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then- President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful COP21 climate summit in Paris.  Controversy  Bruno Lemaitre, a research associate in the Hoffmann laboratory at the time when the major work on Drosophila innate immunity was conducted (for which Hoffmann was awarded the Nobel), claims he was inadequately recognized by Hoffmann as the instigator of and main contributor to the nobel-winning work.

Critical reception The Voice garnered mixed reviews from music critics. AllMusic's David Jeffries gave praise to the album's three singles and \\"Give Me a Call\\" but felt the rest of the track listing contained \\"redundant cuts and overdone party numbers\\" with Jones' overused gimmicky catchphrases. He called the record a \\"significant step up\\" from The American Dream EP. Nathan Slavik of DJBooth highlighted both \\"Next to You\\" and \\"Cuddy Buddy\\" as potential radio chart- toppers but found the album going into \\"unlistenable territory\\" with tracks ranging from a \\"half-baked\\" dance craze (\\"Drop & Gimmie 50\\"), butchering of a celebratory anthem (\\"Happy Birthday\\") and full-on misogyny (\\"Scandalous Hoes II\\"). Slavik concluded by giving his take on Jones' next project: \\"Sadly expectations will be low after The Voice, here's hoping he truly delivers something unexpected.\\" Conversely, Steve 'Flash' Juon from RapReviews praised Jones for delivering a decently paced album that has catchy beats to invigorate the collaborative tracks while also showcasing both his lyrical and vocal improvements from the past four years, concluding with \\"Regardless of the reasons it's clear that Mike Jones is a more seasoned and polished pro of the rap game, and The Voice is planning to have a long career in hip-hop music.

He served as a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Northwest Territories from 1888 until 1891. Prior to that he was a school trustee. __TOC__ Early life Thorburn was born on December 18, 1836, in Edinburgh, Scotland. His father was a Manufacturer. He left Scotland when he was 20 years old, arriving in Lower Canada in 1856. He married his wife Elizabeth at Galt, Ontario, on July 1, 1863. After marriage he moved out to the Northwest Territories settling in the town of Broadview. He started his own general store and became a real-estate agent for the Canada North-West Land Company. His first involvement with politics was on the municipal level when he became a school trustee. Political career Thorburn was elected to the Northwest Territories Legislature in the first Northwest Territories general election held in 1888. He won a hotly contested three-way race in the Whitewood electoral district. In that race he defeated second place Thomas Lyons by eight votes and third place candidate John Hawkes by 63 votes winning the electoral district with almost 39% of the popular vote. During his time in office, land was needed for settlement and local infrastructure in his district. On April 16, 1891 Thorburn and a committee petitioned Minister of Interior Edgar Dewdney who was visiting the area. The petition called for the surrender of surrounding land that was being used by the Kahkewistahaw First Nation. The constituents of Whitewood wanted the land to be opened up for settlement and the development of a Canadian Pacific Railway line. The petition was rejected by Dewdney. Thorburn ran for a second term in office in the 1891 Northwest Territories general election. Despite marginally increasing his popular vote, he was defeated by Daniel Campbell finishing second with 41.5% of the popular vote and 19 votes behind Campbell. He finished well ahead of John Hawkes in the race, whose popular vote collapsed from the last election. He died in 1894 and was buried at Broadview Cemetery.

Origins  Ilunga was the son of Ilunga Mbili the warrior, hunter, prophet and Prince who came from East of the Lualaba river and became general of King Kongolo’s army and also helped him establish the Luba Kingdom. Tshibinda Ilunga was his son as well as King Kongolo’s maternal nephew; his older brother was Kalala Ilunga. After Ilunga Mbili left the Luba Kingdom and went back to his homeland, he left his two sons to be raised by the prophet Mujibu in the royal court. Tshibinda Ilunga’s mother was Bulanda, and her sister Mabela was Kalala Ilunga’s mother; both women were King Kongolo’s sisters and wives to Ilunga Mbili.  Rise  Growing up, Kongolo’s nephews show great hunting and war skills as well as exceptional mystical abilities like their father. Tshibinda excels as a hunter and Kalala as a warrior; both help Kongolo extend the kingdom, and Kalala who heads the army establishes an empire. The fame of both Princes overshadows that of King Kongolo who becomes jealous of his nephews, and plots to have them murdered. While Kalala and his troops are sent on an expedition, on the orders of the King there’s a mutiny and a group of soldiers attempt to kill Kalala. Most remain faithful to Kalala; he therefore comes out victorious. After seeing Kalala alive, Kongolo becomes fearful of his nephews’ growing power and influence. He organizes a ceremony in which the Princes had to dance in front of the King as were the customs. A hole filled with spears and idols was dug in the lane on which Kalala had to dance. It is said that Kalala was warned by the spirits through the drum beats and so Kalala was able to safely complete the dance avoiding the hole. King Kongolo becomes furious and orders the death of both Princes. Kalala Ilunga and Tshibinda Ilunga run away after their mothers had given them their father’s princely attributes. They leave the Kingdom in search of their father. Upon finding him, Ilunga Mbili recognizes them by their attributes and welcomes them. He then puts them in charge of his army and sends them back to the Luba Kingdom. King Kongolo flees to the caves after being overthrown; the brothers chase him and kill him. Kalala beheads him and cuts off his genitalia which he shows to the people as proof of his victory. Kalala Ilunga is then proclaimed Emperor “Mulopwe” in Tshiluba. Kalala Ilunga firmly establishes the Luba Empire. After the crowning of Kalala, Tshibinda Ilunga separates from his brother and at the head of an army, he leaves pursuing other lands westward.  The Land of the Lunda  The Lunda were a group of people living southwest of the Luba; the Chief of the Lunda gave his bracelet of power “rukan” to his daughter Lueji Naweej. Her brothers became furious and exiled themselves from the Kingdom and went on to found the Chokwe. On his arrival in the land of the Lunda, Tshibinda Ilunga meets Queen Lueji Naweej and both fall immediately in love. Lueji is impressed with Tshibinda’s features and his princely garments. Like his father, Tshibinda was tall, dark skinned with a sharp nose; contrary to the indigenous Lunda and Luba people. Lueji invites Tshibinda and his suite to her court where they wed.  Rulership  Tshibinda Ilunga introduces the Luba rituals, culture and religion which the Lunda adopt. Lueji rules by handling law and order while Tshibinda leads his army and conquers the surrounding people including those of Lueji’s brothers the Chokwe, and establishes the Lunda Empire. Due to Lueji’s abnormal dysmenorrhea, she was too sick to rule hence gave the “rukan” to Tshibinda. Tshibinda Ilunga is proclaimed Emperor and takes the title of Mukalenge; he introduces the Luba’s principle of sacred kingship and rule by council; his mystical powers gave him the status of a God-King and identified him as a Solar deity. Under Tshibinda Ilunga, the Lunda Empire rivals that of his brother even greatly surpassing it. The Empire extends from the east of Angola to the southeast Democratic Republic of Congo neighbouring the Luba Empire and all the way south of Zambia.  Death and Decline  Tshibinda Ilunga was known as a hunter, warrior, prophet and civilizing hero. At his death his son Mwata Mutomb succeeds him and becomes the first Mwata Yamvo and extends the Empire further. During his reign, Mwata Mutomb’s authority is disputed by the Lunda who consider him and his family as foreigners. Because of numerous civil wars led by the Chokwe, he and the rest of the imperial family are forced to capitulate. They leave the Empire and begin a migration cutting all ties with the Lunda. At the death of Queen Lueji Naweej, it is the son of her brother who takes the “rukan” and assumes to style and title of Mwata Yamvo; which all future Lunda rulers will assume. Like the Luba Empire; the Lunda Empire eventually splits creating offshoot Kingdoms such as the Kazembe. Today in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Lunda Kingdom is still ruled by a Mwata Yamvo. The descendant of Tshibinda Ilunga migrated north to the current Kasai-Oriental province in the Democratic Republic of Congo and founded the Kingdom of the Bakwa Dishi. The Chokwe are known for their artistic wood carvings of Tshibinda Ilunga. He is usually portrayed with an extravagant hair style depicting his royal statues, a medicine horn as a symbol of his mystical knowledge and a staff which shows his rulership.

This could be the processing, the database, the rendering or the user interface. It represents a special case of distributed computing, with examples of distributed systems including web- based GIS and Mobile GIS. Distribution of resources provides corporate and enterprise-based models for GIS (involving multiple databases, different computers undertaking spatial analysis and a diverse ecosystem of often spatially-enabled client devices). Distributed GIS permits a shared services model, including data fusion (or mashups) based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) web services. Distributed GIS technology enables modern online mapping systems (such as Google Maps and Bing Maps), Location-based services (LBS), web-based GIS (such as ArcGIS Online) and numerous map-enabled applications. Other applications include transportation, logistics, utilities, farm / agricultural information systems, real-time environmental information systems and the analysis of the movement of people. In terms of data, the concept has been extended to include volunteered geographical information. Distributed processing allows improvements to the performance of spatial analysis through the use of techniques such as parallel processing.  Etymology  The term Distributed GIS was coined by Bruce Gittings at the University of Edinburgh. He was responsible for one of the first Internet-based distributed GIS. In 1994, he designed and implemented the World Wide Earthquake Locator, which provided maps of recent earthquake occurrences to a location-independent user, which used the Xerox PARC mapping system (based in California, USA), managed by an interface based in Edinburgh (Scotland), which drew data in real-time from the National Earthquake Information Center (USGS) in Colorado, USA.. The justification for the original Earthquake Locator, an experiment in distributed internetworking, World Wide Earthquake Locator Gittings first taught a course The University of Edinburgh Course Catalogue . Distributed GIS Course in this subject in 2005 as part of the Masters Programme in GIS at that institution. Since there was no Wikipedia article relating to Distributed GIS at the time, he set his students the task of creating one in 2007 as a class exercise. Types Enterprise GIS Enterprise GIS refers to a geographical information system that integrates geographic data across multiple departments and serves the whole organisation.ESRI, 2003 The basic idea of an enterprise GIS is to deal with departmental needs collectively instead of individually. When organisations started using GIS in the 1960s and 1970s, the focus was on individual projects where individual users created and maintained data sets on their own desktop computers. Due to extensive interaction and work-flow between departments, many organisations have in recent years switched from independent, stand-alone GIS systems to more integrated approaches that share resources and applications.Ionita, 2006 Some of the potential benefits that an enterprise GIS can provide include significantly reduced redundancy of data across the system, improved accuracy and integrity of geographic information, and more efficient use and sharing of data.Sipes, 2005 Since data is one of the most significant investments in any GIS program, any approach that reduces acquisition costs while maintaining data quality is important. The implementation of an enterprise GIS may also reduce the overall GIS maintenance and support costs providing a more effective use of departmental GIS resources. Data can be integrated and used in decision making processes across the whole organisation.  Corporate GIS  A corporate Geographical Information System, is similar to Enterprise GIS and satisfies the spatial information needs of an organisation as a whole in an integrated manner.Chan & Williamson 1997 Corporate GIS consists of four technological elements which are data, standards, information technology and personnel with expertise. It is a coordinated approach that moves away from fragmented desktop GIS. The design of a corporate GIS includes the construction of a centralised corporate database that is designed to be the principle resource for an entire organisation. The corporate database is specifically designed to efficiently and effectively suit the requirements of the organisation. Essential to a corporate GIS is the effective management of the corporate database and the establishment of standards such as OGC for mapping and database technologies. Benefits include that all the users in the organisation have access to shared, complete, accurate, high quality and up- to-date data. All the users in the organisation also have access to shared technology and people with expertise. This improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the organisation as a whole. A successfully managed corporate database reduces redundant collection and storage of information across the organisation. By centralising resources and efforts, it reduces the overall cost. Mobile GIS With ~80% of all data deemed to have a spatial component, modern Mobile GIS are a powerful geo-centric business process integration platform enabling the Spatial Enterprise. The number of mobile devices in circulation has surpassed the world's population (2013) with a rapid acceleration in iOS, Android and Windows 8 tablet up-take. Tablets are fast becoming popular for Utility field use. Low-cost MIL-STD-810 certified cases transform consumer tablets into fully ruggedised, yet lightweight field use units at 10% of legacy ruggedised laptop costs. Although not all applications of mobile GIS are limited by the device, many are. These limitations are more applicable to smaller devices such as cell phones and PDAs. Such devices have: small screens with a poor resolution, limited memory and processing power, a poor (or no) keyboard, and short battery life. Additional limitations can be found in web client based tablet applications: poor web GUI and device integration, on-line reliance, and very limited off- line web client cache. Location-Based Services Location-based services (LBS) are services that are distributed wirelessly and provide information relevant to the user's current location. These services include such things as ‘find my nearest …’, directions, and various vehicle monitoring systems, such as the GM OnStar system amongst others. Location-based services are generally run on mobile phones and PDAs, and are intended for use by the general public more than Mobile GIS systems which are geared towards commercial enterprise. Devices can be located by triangulation using the mobile phone network and/or GPS. Web Mapping Services A web mapping service is a means of displaying and interacting with maps on the Web. The first web mapping service was the Xerox PARC Map Viewer built in 1993 and decommissioned in 2000. There have been 3 generations of web map service. The first generation was from 1993 onwards and consisted of simple image maps which had a single click function. The second generation was from 1996 onwards and still used image maps the one click function. However, they also had zoom and pan capabilities (although slow) and could be customised through the use of the URL API. The third generation was from 1998 onwards and were the first to include slippy maps. They utilise AJAX technology which enables seamless panning and zooming. They are customisable using the URL API and can have extended functionality programmed in using the DOM. Web map services are based on the concept of the image map whereby this defines the area overlaying an image (e.g. GIF). An image map can be processed client or server side. As functionality is built into the web server, performance is good. Image maps can be dynamic. When image maps are used for geographic purposes, the co-ordinate system must be transformed to the geographical origin to conform to the geographical standard of having the origin at the bottom left corner. Web maps are used for location-based services.  Local search  Local search is a recent approach to internet searching that incorporates geographical information into search queries so that the links that you return are more relevant to where you are. It developed out of an increasing awareness that many search engine users are using it to look for a business or service in the local area. Local search has stimulated the development of web mapping, which is used either as a tool to use in geographically restricting your search (see Live Search Maps) or as an additional resource to be returned along with search result listings (see Google Maps). It has also led to an increase in the number of small businesses advertising on the web. Mashups In distributed GIS, the term mashup refers to a generic web service which combines content and functionality from disparate sources; mashups reflect a separation of information and presentation. Mashups are increasingly being used in commercial and government applications as well as in the public domain. When used in GIS, it reflects the concept of connecting an application with a mapping service. An examples is combining Google maps with Chicago crime statistics to create the Chicago crime statistics map. Mashups are fast, provide value for money and remove responsibility for the data from the creator. Second generation systems provide mashups mainly based on URL parameters, while Third generation systems (e.g. Google Maps) allow customisation via script (e.g. JavaScript). Strategy The development of the European Union (EU) Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community (INSPIRE) initiative indicates this is a matter that is gaining more awareness at the national and EU scale. This states that there is a need to create ‘quality geo-referenced information’ that would be useful for a better understanding of human activities on environmental processes. Therefore, it is an ambitious project that aims to develop a European spatial information database.Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe —EU INSPIRE Initiative. The GI strategy for Scotland was introduced in 2005 to provide a sustainable SDI, through the ’’One Scotland – One Geography’’ implementation plan. This documentation notes that it should be able to provide linkages to the ’’Spaces, Faces and Places of Scotland’’. Although plans for a GI strategy have been in existence for some time, it was revealed at the AGI Scotland 2007 conference that a recent budget review by the Scottish Government indicated there will not be an allocation of resources to fund this initiative within the next term. Therefore, a business plan will need to be presented in order to outline the cost-benefits involved with taking up the strategy.The Scottish Government—Further information on the GIS Strategy for Scotland. Standards The main standards for Distributed GIS are provided by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). OGC is a non-profit international group which seeks to Web- Enable GIS and in turn Geo-Enable the web. One of the major issues concerning distributed GIS is the interoperability of the data since it can come in different formats using different projection systems. OGC standards seek to provide interoperability between data and to integrate existing data. OGC In terms of interoperability, the use of communication standards in Distributed GIS is particularly important. General standards for Geospatial Data have been developed by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). For the exchange of Geospatial Data over the web, the most important OGC standards are Web Map Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS). Using OGC compliant gateways allows for building very flexible Distributed GI Systems. Unlike monolithic GI Systems, OGC compliant systems are naturally web-based and do not have strict definitions of servers and clients. For instance, if a user (client) accesses a server, that server itself can act as a client of a number of further servers in order to retrieve data requested by the user. This concept allows for data retrieval from any number of different sources, providing consistent data standards are used. This concept allows data transfer with systems not capable of GIS functionality. A key function of OGC standards is the integration of different systems already existing and thus geo-enabling the web. Web services providing different functionality can be used simultaneously to combine data from different sources (mash-ups). Thus, different services on distributed servers can be combined for ‘service- chaining’ in order to add additional value to existing services. Providing a wide use of OGC standards by different web services, sharing distributed data of multiple organisations becomes possible. Some important languages used in OGC compliant systems are described in the following. XML stands for eXtensible Markup language and is widely used for displaying and interpreting data from computers. Thus the development of a web-based GI system requires several useful XML encodings that can effectively describe two-dimensional graphics such as maps SVG and at the same time store and transfer simple features GML. Because GML and SVG are both XML encodings, it is very straightforward to convert between the two using an XML Style Language Transformation XSLT. This gives an application a means of rendering GML, and in fact is the primary way that it has been accomplished among existing applications today. XML can introduce innovative web services, in terms of GIS. It allows geographic information to be easily translated in graphic and in these terms scalar vector graphics (SVG) can produce high quality dynamic outputs by using data retrieved from spatial databases. In the same aspect Google, one of the pioneers in web-based GIS, has developed its own language which also uses a XML structure. Keyhole Markup Language (KML) is a file format used to display geographic data in an earth browser, such as Google Earth, Google Maps, and Google Maps for mobile browsers Global System for Mobile Communications Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is a global standard for mobile phones around the world. Networks using the GSM system offer transmission of voice, data and messages in text and multimedia form and provide web, telenet, ftp, email services etc. over the mobile network. Almost two million people are now using GSM. Five main standards of GSM exist: GSM 400, GSM 850, GSM 900, GSM-1800 (DCS) and GSM1900 (PCS). GSM 850 and GSM 1900 is used in North America, parts of Latin America and parts of Africa. In Europe, Asia and Australia GSM 900/1800 standard is used. GSM consists of two components: the mobile radio telephone and Subscriber Identity Module. GSM is a cellular network, which is a radio network made up of a number of cells. For each cell, the transmitter (known as a base station) is transmitting and receiving signals. The base station is controlled through the Base Station Controller via the Mobile Switching Centre. For GSM enhancement General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), a packet-oriented data service for data transmission, and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UTMS), the Third Generation (3G) mobile communication system, technology was introduced. Both provide similar services to 2G, but with greater bandwidth and speed. Wireless Application Protocol Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) is a standard for the data transmission of internet content and services. It is a secure specification that allows users to access the information instantly via mobile phones, pagers, two-way radios, smartphones and communicators. WAP supports HTML and XML, and WML language, and is specifically designed for small screens and one-hand navigation without a keyboard. WML is scalable from two-line text displays up to the graphical screens found on smart phones. It is much stricter than HTML and is similar to JavaScript. Geotagging Geotagging is the process of adding geographical identification metadata to resources such as websites, RSS feed, images or videos. The metadata usually consist of latitude and longitude coordinates but may also include altitude, camera holding direction, place information and so on. Flickr website is one of the famous web services which host photos and provides functionality to add latitude and longitude information to the picture. The main idea is to use metadata related to pictures and photo collection. A geotag is simply a properly-formed XML tag giving the geographic coordinates of a place. The coordinates can be specified in latitude and longitude or in UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator) coordinates. The RDFIG Geo vocabulary from the W3C is the common basis for the recommendations. It supplies official global names for the latitude, longitude, and altitude properties. These are given in a system of coordinates known as \\"the WGS84 datum\\". A geographic datum specifies an ellipsoidal approximation to the Earth's surface; WGS84 is the most commonly used such datum.  Parallel Processing  Parallel processing is the use of multiple CPU’s to execute different sections of a program together. Remote sensing and surveying equipment have been providing vast amounts of spatial information, and how to manage, process or dispose of this data have become major issues in the field of Geographic Information Science (GIS). To solve these problems there has been much research into the area of parallel processing of GIS information. This involves the utilization of a single computer with multiple processors or multiple computers that are connected over a network working on the same task. There are many different types of distributed computing, two of the most common are clustering and grid processing. Some consider grid computing to be “the third information technology wave” after the Internet and Web, and will be the backbone of the next generation of services and applications that are going to further the research and development of GIS and related areas. Grid computing allows for the sharing of processing power, enabling the attainment of high performances in computing, management and services. Grid computing, (unlike the conventional supercomputer that does parallel computing by linking multiple processors over a system bus) uses a network of computers to execute a program. The problem of using multiple computers lies in the difficulty of dividing up the tasks among the computers, without having to reference portions of the code being executed on other CPUs. Amdahl's law expresses the speedup of a program as a result of parallelization. It states that potential program speedup is defined by the fraction of code (P) that can be parallelized: 1/(1-P). If the code cannot be broken up to run over multiple processors, P = 0 and the speedup = 1 (no speedup). If it is possible to break up the code to be perfectly parallel then P = 1 and the speedup is infinite, in theory though practical limits occur. Thus, there is an upper bound on the usefulness of adding more parallel execution units. Gustafson's law is a law closely related to Amdahl's law but doesn't make as many assumptions and tries to model these factors in the representation of performance. The equation can be modelled by S(P) = P − α * (P − 1) where P is the number of processors, S is the speedup, and α the non-parallelizable part of the process. The hadoop framework has been used successfully in GIS processing. See also *Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) References *Chan, T, O, Williamson, I, P.

The success of the project, under the direction of the world’s leading baroque musicians, can be measured in the number of ex-EUBO members who now play in Europe's leading baroque orchestras. History EUBO was founded in 1985 as a major initiative of European Music Year to celebrate the 300th anniversaries of three great baroque musicians: Johann Sebastian Bach, Domenico Scarlatti and George Frideric Handel. Since then, more than 600 full-time members of EUBO have given over 900 performances in 54 countries worldwide. The orchestra performs at many of Europe’s leading music festivals and concert halls, including the Amsterdam Concertgebouw, St John's Smith Square in London, the festivals Bachwoche Ansbach, and specialist early music festivals in Utrecht, York, Brugge, Valletta and London. Outside Europe, as well as tours to Japan, United States and South Africa, EUBO has played in less favoured parts of the world such as Ramallah and the Gaza Strip, Botswana, and Soweto. Structure and funding The European Union Baroque Orchestra is an educational charity registered in England & Wales with its administrative office in Wootton, Oxfordshire. The orchestra is completely renewed every year. Auditions take place in spring, with usually around 100 young baroque musicians applying for the 20-25 places in the ensemble. The successful applicants then come together for concert tours which take the talented young orchestra to all corners of Europe. Members of EUBO gain performing experience, working together under the inspirational leadership of Music Director Lars Ulrik Mortensen and some of the world’s finest baroque musicians. Ton Koopman, Margaret Faultless, Roy Goodman, Enrico Onofri, Rachel Podger, Paul Agnew, Gottfried von der Goltz, Alfredo Bernardini, Sergio Azzolini and Amandine Beyer are amongst the artists who regularly work with EUBO. EUBO is partnered by nine European organisations within a co-operation project ‘EUBO Mobile Baroque Academy’ with co-funding from the Creative Europe programme of the European Union. The project addresses the unequal provision across the EU of baroque music education and performance in new and creative ways. EUBO has been honoured with the status of Cultural Ambassador for the European Union in perpetuity. Since 2008, EUBO has been Orchestra-in-Residence in Echternach, Luxembourg, working together with the City of Echternach, Festival International Echternach and the cultural centre Trifolion. EUBO’s residency in Echterach and the Echter’Barock series of concerts are made possible by grants from the City of Echternach and the Ministry of Culture in Luxembourg.

It was established under the French rule in 1925.Art Articles - Vietnamese Modern Paintings - The Pioneers The university has trained many of Vietnam’s leading artists and each year it participates in many cultural exchanges with sister institutions overseas. History The long and distinguished history of the Hanoi University of Fine Art may be traced back to the colonial École Supérieure des Beaux Arts de l’Indochine (1925-45) (the Indochina College of Fine Arts) which trained successive generations of Vietnamese students -- and a smaller number of students from Cambodia and Laos -- in the western art tradition, laying the essential groundwork for the development of a distinctive Vietnamese style of modern art. The École des Beaux-Arts de l’Indochine in Hanoi was the predecessor of the Hanoi College of Fine Arts (:vi:Trường Đại học Mỹ thuật Việt Nam). The école was established by the French colonial government, along similar lines to the École Nationale des Beaux-Arts d’Alger, established 1843, and École des Beaux-Arts de Tunis, established 1923. The school was for all students who were then known to the French as Indochinese -- including Tonkinese (Bắc Kỳ), Annamese (Trung Kỳ), Cochin Chinese (i.e., not ethnic Chinese but inhabitants of Nam Kỳ), Khmer, and Lao -- although inevitably most students were drawn from Hanoi itself.Nora A.

He was known to be one of the active participators in the Nhân Văn affair in the mid-1950s which saw many middle class intellectuals demanding freedom and democracy in communist-led North Vietnam. After he criticised the disastrous land reform campaign in 1956, he was stripped of all positions he held in the government and was forced to retire from practicing law. Biography Nguyễn Mạnh Tường was born in 1909 in the Hàng Đào street of Hà Nội. He graduated from the Lycée Albert Sarraut at age 16 and studied overseas at the University of Montpellier in southern France in 1927. At age 22, he became the first Vietnamese person to receive two doctorates in France: Juris Doctor (with the dissertation L'individu dans la vieille cité annamite, Code des Lê, D.E., Droit, Montpellier, Imp. de la Presse Montpellier 1932) and a Doctor d'État in Literature (L'Annam dans la littérature française, D.E., Lettres, Montpellier 1932). According to the press of the time, a young Vietnamese person with two doctorates was unheard of in the French educational system. A good friend of his was Nguyễn Văn Huyên, who was working toward a Doctor of Letters in France. Returning to Vietnam in 1936, Nguyễn Mạnh Tường taught French literature in Hanoi at the Lycée du Protectorat (trường Trung học Bảo hộ or trường Bưởi, since 1945 named Chu Văn An High School). Dissatisfied with prejudiced French policies, he left the school and opened a law firm. While participating in the Vietnamese resistance against France (see First Indochina War), he worked as a lawyer and taught in Thanh Hóa until the Partition of Vietnam in 1954, when he moved back to Hanoi and became a professor at University of Literature (Đại học Văn khoa, now Vietnam National University, Hanoi). After 1954, he became dean at the Hanoi University of Law (Đại học Luật Hà Nội), vice-chairman of the Vietnamese Lawyers Association (Hội Luật gia Việt Nam); chair of the Vietnam Law Group (Đoàn Luật sư Việt Nam); vice- dean at the Hanoi National University of Education (Đại học Sư phạm Hà Nội); member of the Central Committee of the Vietnamese Fatherland Front; member of the Vietnam-France Friendship Society (Hội Hữu nghị Việt-Pháp), Vietnamese- Soviet Friendship Society (Hội Hữu nghị Việt-Xô), and Committee for the Protection of World Peace (Uỷ ban Bảo vệ Hoà bình Thế giới); founder of the Unity Club (Câu lạc bộ Đoàn Kết); and vice-provost at Hanoi National University of Education; he also conducted education research.

Unique on any Roman frontier, it runs practically from coast to coast to the south of the wall. The earliest surviving mention of the earthwork is by Bede (Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, I.12), who refers to a vallum, or earthen rampart, as distinct from the wall, or murus; the term is still used despite the fact that the essential element is a ditch, or fossa. It was long thought that the Vallum predated the stone wall, whose most elaborate phasing was presented in 1801 by William Hutton, who thought, wrongly, that the south vallum mound and the marginal mound, with a ditch between, were the work of Agricola, that the vallum ditch and north mound were added by Hadrian, and that the stone wall was the work of Severus. In fact all these elements date to Hadrian's reign, with the stone wall having been built first.  Layout and course  The Vallum comprises a ditch, nominally wide and deep, with a flat bottom, flanked by two mounds about 6 metres wide and high, set back some from the ditch edges. For a great deal of its length a third lower mound, the so-called marginal mound occupies the south berm (flat area between mound and ditch), right on the southern lip of the ditch.Heywood, B. (1966). \\"The Vallum—Its Problems Restated\\", in M. G. Jarrett and B. Dobson, eds., Britain and Rome: Essays Presented to Eric Birley. Kendal: Wilson, pp. 85–94 The total width of the fortification (consisting, from north to south, of mound, berm, ditch, marginal mound, berm, mound) was thus about . In several places – for example at Heddon-on-the-Wall and Limestone Corner – the Vallum was cut through solid rock, sometimes for lengthy distances. The distance of the Vallum from the Wall varies. In general there was a preference for the earthwork to run close to the rear of the Wall where topography allowed. In the central sector the Wall runs along the top of the crags of the Whin Sill, while the Vallum, laid out in long straight stretches, lies in the valley below to the south, as much as away.  Archaeology and purpose  Before the middle of the 19th century, the Vallum was most commonly known as Agricola's Ditch, since antiquarians wrongly thought that it had been constructed during the period when Agricola was Governor of Britannia, the Roman province spanning what is now England, Wales and southern Scotland. After John Hodgson published the final portion of his History of Northumberland in 1840,John Hodgson (1840). A History of Northumberland. Newcastle: E. Walker. it became generally accepted that the Wall and Vallum had been built during the reign of Hadrian. Hodgson based his view on evidence which included a stone tablet now in the Great North Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne, which had been found in Milecastle 38 on the Wall in the previous century, its significance having been overlooked. The inscription on the tablet, probably made and erected to mark the completion of the milecastle, includes the names of Hadrian and Aulus Platorius Nepos (Governor of Britannia during Hadrian's reign), as well as \\"Legio II Augusta\\" (Second Augustan Legion). It is now accepted that units of that Roman legion built the section of Hadrian's Wall which includes the milecastle, and they would have automatically included the names of the current emperor and governor on the tablet.Roger J. A. Wilson (2002). A Guide to the Roman Remains in Britain. London: Constable & Robinson. p. 467. Benwell in western Newcastle upon Tyne. The central ditch that it crosses has been largely filled in. The first excavation was undertaken in 1893 at Great Hill (at Heddon-on-the-Wall, near Newcastle upon Tyne),Society of Antiquaries of Newcastle upon Tyne (1894). \\"First Report of the Committee Appointed to make Excavations per Lineam Valli\\". Archaeologia Aeliana. 2 (16): xxvi–xxvii. where it was observed that the Vallum ditch was cut through a seam of fire-clay which was deployed in both mounds. This excavation demonstrated that the main north and south mounds were contemporary and built using material dug from the ditch. In the late 20th century several excavations established that the marginal mound was also contemporary.Wilmott, T. (forthcoming). \\"Four Investigations of the Linear Elements of Hadrian’s Frontier Works, 1980–2000\\". Hadrian’s Wall: Archaeological Research by English Heritage, 1976–2000, ed. T. Wilmott. The Vallum is known to have been constructed some time after the wall was completed, as it deviates to the south around several wall-forts which were either completed or under construction when the wall was nearing completion.Simpson, F. G.; Richmond, I. A. (1937). \\"The Fort on Hadrian's Wall at Halton\\". Archaeologia Aeliana. 4 (14): 151–71. There would have been a crossing-point like a causeway or bridge to the south of each wall-fort – several such causeways are known, such as the one at Condercum in Benwell, a western suburb of Newcastle. Causeways have also been detected to the south of several milecastles.Welfare, H. (2000). \\"Causeways, at Milecastles Across the Ditch of Hadrian’s Wall\\". Archaeologia Aeliana. 5 (28): 13–25. It is thought that the easternmost section of Hadrian's Wall between the forts of Pons Aelius (Newcastle upon Tyne) and Segedunum (Wallsend) was an addition to the original plan. The Vallum was not constructed behind this extra length of the wall, indeed it did not apparently even reach the fort at Newcastle; instead it seems it stopped in the western Newcastle suburb of Elswick. This was probably because from here on the Vallum's function as a southern barrier to the wall was performed by the River Tyne. Although there is no definitive historical evidence as to why the Roman army built this unusual barrier, modern archaeological opinion is that the Vallum established the southern boundary of an exclusion zone bounded on the north by the wall itself.Bidwell, P. T. (2005). \\"The System of Obstacles on Hadrian’s Wall: Their Extent, Date and Purpose\\". Arbeia Journal 8: 53–76. The zone would have been \\"out-of- bounds\\" to civilians and those with no valid reason to be there. It might thus have been the Roman equivalent to a modern demilitarized zone or DMZ, such as the Korean Demilitarized Zone currently separating North Korea and South Korea. Sometime in the 2nd century AD, the Vallum was \\"slighted\\" – that is, the ramparts were broken through and the ditch filled in at fairly regular intervals along its length. Archaeologists and historians have speculated that either the Vallum was then deemed unnecessary, or that it was proving to be a hindrance to military and authorised civilian traffic. Some have suggested that this coincided with the building of the Antonine Wall in Scotland and the temporary abandonment of Hadrian's Wall. It is worth noticing at this point that the Antonine Wall was a less formidable barrier than Hadrian's Wall, for two main reasons: firstly, because it was built out of turf rather than stone; and secondly, because it had no equivalent ditch system like the Vallum behind the Wall. It may have been for these reasons that the Antonine Wall was not garrisoned for very long.

In about 1880 he enrolled at Princeton University. He was pastor at a Presbyterian church in Philadelphia from 1882 to 1885, when he resigned, becoming an independent preacher and a lecturer on \\"independent religion\\" in New York. In 1892 he became leader of the Ethical Culture Society of Chicago, a group established by Felix Adler. In 1900 he organized the Independent Religious Society of Chicago, a rationalist group, of which he remained pastor until 1925. He retired to Piedmont, California, where he lived for the rest of his life. During his life Mangasarian wrote a number of books. His most popular, including The Truth About Jesus — Is He a Myth? (1909) and The Bible Unveiled (1911), deal with the evidence against the existence of an historical Jesus. He also wrote hundreds of essays and lectures on questions of the times. His books and essays were translated into French, German, Spanish, and other foreign languages. The general subject of his writing was religious criticism and the philosophy of religion. Mangasarian considered himself a Rationalist or a Secularist not an Atheist, since he considered atheism a non- verifiable belief system.  Bibliography  * A Voice from the Orient (J. G.

Song history During Luv's heyday (1977–1981), the female pop act failed in its attempt to get a hit record in Japan, whereas it dominated the music charts in a large part of Continental Europe, South Africa and Mexico. In 1980, the trio planned to take part in the Yamaha Music Festival but cancelled its participation to this competition. It prevented indeed Luv' from reaching the mainstream Japanese music market. A decade later, as the Dutch vocal formation made its comeback with a different line-up, it tried to promote new material (produced by Nigel Wright) through the network of discos and clubs in the Asian archipelago. That's why, Luv's record company decided to release the song \\"Girl Like Me\\" as a Maxi single, hoping to have a club hit and later a mainstream chart topper. It was promoted as a Eurobeat song (this style of music was very popular back then in Japan). It also was included on Japanese Various Artists Eurobeat compilations.CD list of compilation \\"That's EUROBEAT ALMANAC 1986-1991\\" However, this strategy to adapt the Japanese market didn't succeed.

It has no suffragan dioceses, and is directly subject to the Holy See. History During the Gothic Wars the city of Lucca was besieged and taken by Totila (550). Hoping for assistance from the Franks, the Lucchesi obstinately resisted the attack of Narses, surrendering only after a siege of seven months (553). It later fell into the hands of the Lombards, was thenceforward a place of great importance, and became the favourite seat of the Marquesses of Tuscany. In 981 Otto II, Holy Roman Emperor bestowed on its bishop civil jurisdiction over the entire diocesan territory; but in 1081 Emperor Henry IV made it a free city and conferred other favours upon it, especially in the way of trade. This was the origin of the Republic of Lucca. Lucca was generally on the side of the pope against the emperor, and hence joined the League of S. Ginesio (1197). There is a legend that the Gospel was preached at Lucca by St. Paulinus, a disciple of St. Peter, and the discovery in 1197 of a stone, recording the deposition of the relics of Paulinus, a holy martyr, apparently confirmed this belief. On the stone, however, St. Paulinus is not called Bishop of Lucca, nor is there any allusion to his having lived in Apostolic times.\\"Analecta Bollandiana\\", 1904, p. 491; 1905, p. 502. The first bishop of certain date is Maximus, present at the Council of Sardica (343). At the Council of Rimini (359), Paulinus, Bishop of Lucca, was present. Perhaps the above-mentioned legend arose through a repetition of this Paulinus. Remarkable for sanctity and miracles was St. Fridianus (Frediano) (560–588), son of Ultonius, King of Ireland, or perhaps of a king of Ulster (Ultonia), of whom in his \\"Dialogues\\" (III, 10) Gregory the Great relates a miracle.On St. Fridianus see Colgan, \\"Acta Sanct.

The Commonwealth of Nations describes it in this context: It is modeled on gender mainstreaming, which the United Nations defined in the 1990s as: Strategy Youth mainstreaming is a two-fold strategy for pursuing youth development. Inspired by the experience of gender mainstreaming, it involves ensuring youth is reflected in policy and project stages in various sectors and ensuring there are specific projects addressing youth. Together these add up to a youth responsive approach. By reflecting, addressing, being sensitive to, and being responsive to youth issues, mainstreaming is meant to both looking at the impact of a policy/project on young women and men, and involve young men and women in order to ensure youth participation in the decision-making of those policies and/or projects that affects them. Advocates of youth mainstreaming point out that young people represent a disadvantaged and marginalised social group, being over-represented among the global poor and unemployed. As such it is argued that \\"pro-poor\\" strategies must be \\"pro-youth\\", and that any development intervention seeking sustainable impact must address the youth cohort. Purposes The purposes of youth mainstreaming include: * Avoiding perpetuating and/or reinforcing the marginalisation of young people * Confronting society's stigmatization of young people as deviant, criminal, incapable etc. * Maximizing the positive impact of policies and/or projects upon young people * Promoting inter-generational transfer of knowledge and positive cultural values * Investing in young people: realise the benefits of engaging them as a human resource * Respecting the right of young people to participate in decision-making (for under 18s this is enshrined in Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child). * Benefiting from young people’s knowledge, skills, ideas and practical contributions * Empowering young people, which is a Commonwealth objective under the \\"Plan of Action for Youth Empowerment\\". Process The basic steps in youth mainstreaming are to factor youth impacts and youth participation into all stages of a project, of whatever size and sector: * Situation Analysis: Young women and men’s condition and position need to be researched. Young people can act as peer researchers, informants in the process. * Planning: Young people should be a target population, and young people’s views and aspirations should be taken into account. * Implementation of Activities: Young people should be maximally involved, consistent with their informed consent and their education, livelihoods and leisure needs. * Monitoring and Evaluation: There should be youth-specific indicators, including those related to the quantity and quality of youth participation in the project. M&E; should also involve asking young people’s view of how much progress has been made and what the challenges are. * Budgeting: Specific line items should cover youth-specific activities and the mechanisms to be put in place to secure their participation in all stages of the project. The steps that institutions can take toward youth mainstreaming are: * Capacity-building on youth mainstreaming * Designation of youth mainstreaming focal points within each department * Integration of youth mainstreaming in planning, budgeting and Monitoring and Evaluation procedures. Essential questions # Are young women and men part of the target population? # Will the situation analysis disaggregate data by age-group as well as gender, socio-economic, ethnic group etc? # Have existing youth structures (e.g. National Youth Councils, youth NGOs and youth clubs, secondary schools, colleges) been consulted as part of background research? # Will young people be given a role in conducting the Situation Analysis? # Will young people’s views be canvassed and taken into account when setting goals and objectives? # Do young people fall under the general goals and objectives? # Are there youth-specific goals and objectives? # What are the youth-specific line items in the budget? Will control over any of the budget be shared with/delegated to young people? # What are the youth-specific activities likely to be? # How is flexibility built into the project design, so that young people’s decision-making will be given expression? # What are the youth- specific performance indicators? # How will young people be involved in monitoring and evaluation?

The Rock Hotel lies above the park. History In 1816 the gardens were commissioned by the British Governor of Gibraltar General George Don. It was his intention that the soldiers stationed in the fortress would have a pleasant recreational area to enjoy when off duty, and so inhabitants could enjoy the air protected from the extreme heat of the sun. The gardens were resurrected in 1991 by an external company when it was realised that since the 1970s they had fallen into a poor state. Three years later the gardens had the addition of a zoo: the Alameda Wildlife Conservation Park. In 2001 a bronze sculpture of James Joyce's Molly Bloom was installed in the gardens. This running figure was commissioned from Jon Searle to celebrate the bicentenary of the Gibraltar Chronicle in 2001. The Eliott Memorial General Don had commissioned a memorial of George Augustus Eliott, 1st Baron Heathfield in 1815, which did not materialise in the form initially requested. A colossal statue of General Eliot, carved from the bowsprit of the Spanish ship San Juan Nepomuceno, taken at the Battle of Trafalgar was first created. That statue was taken to the Governor's residence, The Convent, where it stands today, being replaced by the present bronze bust in 1858. This statue is guarded for four 18th-century howitzers. Plants of the gardens The Elliott Memorial dates from 1858Alameda Gardens, Strolling Guides, accessed August 2012 The plants of the Alameda Gardens are a combination of native species and others brought in from abroad: *Dracaena draco (Canary Islands Dragon Tree), a subtropical Dragon Tree native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira, Azores, and locally in western Morocco. The oldest dragon tree in the gardens is about 300 years old. * Stone pine (Pinus pinea), a species of pine native of southern Europe, primarily the Iberian Peninsula. *Wild Olive (Olea europaea), a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae. *Celtis australis (European Nettle Tree), a deciduous tree that can be among 20 to 25 metres of height. *Grevillea robusta (Australian Silk Oak), the largest species in the genus Grevillea. There is only one specimen of this tree in the gardens. * Canary Island Date Palm (Phoenix canariensis), a large palm native to the Canary Islands off the Atlantic coast of north Africa. *Washingtonia filifera (Washingtonia), a palm native to the desert oases of Central, southern and southwestern Arizona, southern Nevada, extreme northwest Mexico and inland deserts of southern California. *Howea forsteriana (Kentia palm), endemic to Lord Howe Island. *Ptychosperma elegans (Solitaire Palm), endemic to the Northern Territory and eastern Queensland in Australia. * Chinese hibiscus (Hibiscus rosa-sinensis), an evergreen shrub native to East Asia. * Bougainvillea, a genus of flowering plants native to South America from Brazil west to Peru and south to southern Argentina (Chubut Province). *Asteraceae (daisies), the second largest family of flowering plants. *Pelargonium, a genus of flowering plants. * Succulent plant, water-retaining plants adapted to arid climate or soil conditions. Events The Alameda Open Air Theatre was inaugurated once again on 12 April 1996 at four o'clock with three bands of music playing - the same number of bands as had attended 180 years before to the hour at the opening of the Alameda Gardens in 1816. In order to extend its use from just theatre to general use, a number of new features were introduced, like the waterfall and lake - the largest area of open fresh water on the Rock, with Koi Carp and a collection of exotic lilies. Since its opening, this venue has been used for a variety of purposes, from beauty contests to band concerts, also weddings, dinner dances, conferences and variety shows. It also is the main venue for the GIB Fringe.

He was the author of more than 2,000 poems. Childhood and youth Emiliano Fernández was born to Silvestre Fernández and Bernarda Rivarola. During his first years he lived in the town of Ysaty, where he attended the elementary school until the 5th grade. During the revolution of 1904, which took the Liberal Party, a traditional political group founded in 1887, to power, he moved to Concepción, where later he made the military service. From the 1920s, with a bohemian spirit he began to travel to all the points of Paraguay, writing his first poems which he would then recite or sing with his guitar: “Primavera” (I y II), “Trigueñita” y “Pyhare amaguype”, published in “Okara poty kue mi”, magazine of poetry and popular songs, edited for many years by the Trujillo family. He later wrote two of his most popular songs in an epic tone: “Che la reina” o “Ahama che china” and “Rojas Silva rekavo”. During the Chaco War, between Paraguay and Bolivia ( 1932–1935 ) he was a member of the Infantry regiment “13 Tuyutí”, as a soldier, writing his best poems between the pauses of the battles. He was wounded and moved to Asunción. As a soldier, in the first of battle Nanawa, when he was wounded in action, Fernández reached the summit of value and sacrifice. During the international conflict, his poems reached all the distant points of the country, giving enthusiasm and conviction of victory, which later gave him the nickname of “Tirteo verde olivo”, after the Spartan poet Tyrtaeus, an expression he owes to Mauricio Cardozo Ocampo. More than 60 years later, whenever one of his songs is listened to, an inevitable patriotic emotion fills the hearts of his fellow citizens. The scholar and intellectual Carlos Villagra Marsal considers him the most popular poet in Paraguay. With his poems written in “jopara” (mixture of guarani and Spanish) he could get deep inside the soul of his people. One of the curiosities in his immense work are the verses dedicated to the women who had sometime had a relation with him, and there weren’t few: his wife, Maria Belen Lugo, Leandra Paredes, Zulmita Leon, Mercedes Rojas, Catalina Vallejos, Dominga Jara, Eloisa Osorio, Otilia Riquelme, Marciana de la Vega, among many others. His last poem was dedicated to his nurse, Facunda Velásquez, a short time before dying. He devoted himself to journalism for a few years, working in the “Semanario Guaraní” with Facundo Recalde. During his life he Publisher a small book named “Ka’aguy jary’i”, containing some of his more emblematic poems. Mentions In 1950, the Guarani Association of Writers declared him the “national Glory”. History and works Emilianore, as he was known, was a synthesis of the Paraguayan bohemian world. He was a traveler and a late sleeper, he lived for a while in Sapucai, then in Caballero, then in San Pedro, Puerto Casado, Puerto Pinasco, Rancho Carambola (Brazil), and besides being a musician and a poet, he was also known for various activities such as carpenter, scouts guide, and forest man. In one of the files of his many works in Carlos Casado, we can see together with the firing paper, the following recommendation:” he is not to be taken ever as a worker in this company because he likes to party too much.” Works His extensive poetic work as well as musical incluyes, among others, the popular songs “Asunción del Paraguay”, “Las siete cabrillas”, “Adiós che paraje kue”, “La última letra”, “Siete notas musicales”, “Guavirá poty”, “Oda pasional”, “Tupasy del campo”, “Despierta mi Angelina”, “Che pochyma nendive”, “Nda che pochyi nendive”, “¿Porqué?”, “De lejos vengo”, “Tujami”, “Jagua rekove”, “Mboriahu memby”, “Reten pe pyhare”, “13 Tuyutí”, “Soldado guaraní”, “1º de Marzo”, “Ñesuhame”, “Nde keguype”, “Nde juru mbyte”, “Farra chui che kepe guare”. His last years A short while before dying, he left a great message in his poem \\"Mi pluma\\": \\"my pen is a girl, my flag and my heroine, in the fight her audacity and her courage never stops, she is the spear that touches sharply, very softly a sentinel of my life, faithful guardian of my honor.

The historian Roberto A. Romero, among his biographers one of the main ones, refers about the circumstances of his death: ”On November 3, 1948, at around 6 pm , Emiliano arrived to the “Caracolito” store in the neighborhood Loma Kavara…There he was hit by a bullet from the shadows, who wounded him seriously…He had been ambushed. The author of the crime was never caught. The musicians Ricardo Pereira, Federico Esmerdel and Carlos Vera took him to the Militar hospital…. That night he underwent a surgery by Dr Pedro de Felice. He stayed there for a few months…but he didn’t recover from his wounds…he died…after a long suffering, at around 4.25 on September 15, 1949.” On the fact of his death, Okara poty kue mi says: \\"he died from a treacherous bullet\\". The great Paraguayan poet Elvio Romero sang to him: “With a walking soul he went to rest on death, in the sad instant of his walking.

Early Life Buckton was born in London and lived in Hornsey, England, the eldest son of George Buckton (1785 - 1847; Proctor to the Prerogative Court of Canterbury) and Eliza Buckton (née Merricks, 1786 - 1842). At the age of five he had an accident which left him partially paralysed for the rest of his long life; this precluded attendance at school so he was privately educated. He became however a scholar of classics and was an accomplished musician and painter. After his father's death he moved to Queen's Road, West London, and In 1848 he became an assistant to August Wilhelm von Hofmann (1818-1892) at the nearby Royal College of Chemistry in London.[1], [2], [3] In 1867 he married Mary Ann Odling (1831 – 1927), the sister of William Odling with whom he had written his last chemical paper. He designed his house at Haslemere and built an observatory there. Research in Chemistry His first paper, on reactions of cyanogen with platinum ammine complexes, appeared in 1852.[5] He wrote two papers with Hofmann on reactions of sulfuric acid with amides and nitriles. [6] He also publIshed much work on alkyls of main-group elements, e. g. on the discovery of the anti-knock agent tetra-ethyl lead. [7]; His last paper on chemistry, on aluminium trimethyl and triethyl, appeared in 1865 c-authored with William Odling. [8] Much of his research on alkyls has been reviewed by modern authors.[9], [10] appeared wrote scientific papers on chemistry until 1865 when he moved to Haslemere and started to study Hemiptera.

He played professionally for Partizan, Aris, Panathinaikos, Panionios, Pallacanestro Cantù, Cholet and Cabitel Gijón. Early career and college Pecarski played college basketball at Marist College in Poughkeepsie, New York, arriving there in 1984 under also newly arrived head coach Matt Furjanic. Considered by some to be Europe's top seventeen-year-old player, Pecarski got injured in the preseason thus opening up an opportunity at center for another newly acquired European prospect — eighteen-year-old Rik Smits. The Red Foxes had a successful 1985–86 season, making the 64-team NCAA tournament for the first time in team's history. However, they went out at the very first hurdle, losing versus Georgia Tech in the first round of the Southeast regional bracket. Pecarski averaged 10.5 points per game and 5.9 rebounds per game over the entire season. The following season, playing under new head coach Dave Magarity, Pecarski improved his scoring average to 12.4 points per game and led the team in rebounds with 8.4 boards per game, as the Red Foxes repeated the feat of making the NCAA tournament, but were again eliminated in the first round — this time by Pittsburgh. Pecarski didn't play for the Red Foxes in the 1987–88 season, in order to train with Yugoslavia for the 1988 Olympics. He returned to Marist for the 1988–89 season and averaged 19.5 points per game, 9.1 rebounds per game and 1.1 blocks per game, leading the school in all three categories.

In a racing career which lasted from July 1974 until August 1975 he ran eleven times and won eight races. He was the leading British two-year-old of 1974 when his wins included the Champagne Stakes and the Dewhurst Stakes. In 1975 he was narrowly beaten in the 2000 Guineas but went on to win the Irish 2000 Guineas and the Epsom and Irish derbies. He is best remembered however, for his win over Bustino in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond Stakes, which has been described as Britain's \\"Race of the Century\\". He was retired to stud at the end of 1975 and had some success as a sire of winners. He was exported to Japan where he died in 1992. Background Grundy was a chestnut horse with a white blaze and flaxen mane and tail. bred by Overbury Stud near Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, England. He was a son of Great Nephew who also sired Epsom Derby winner Shergar and the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame filly, Carotene. His dam, Word From Lundy, was a daughter of the French runner Worden, whose wins included Italy's Premio Roma and the 1953 Washington, D.C. International Stakes in the United States. Word From Lundy won over two miles, but was from a family which was noted for its speed, having produced the leading sprinter Tower Walk. In 1973 the yearling was sent to the Newmarket October sales where he was bought by the bloodstock agent Keith Freeman for 11,000 guineas. Freeman was acting on behalf of Carlo Vittadini, an Italian banker who owned a stud farm in Italy and later Beech House Stud at Newmarket, England. The colt was sent into training with Peter Walwyn at Seven Barrows, Lambourn in Berkshire. Grundy was ridden in all his races by the Irish jockey Pat Eddery. Racing career 1974:two-year-old season Grundy made his first racecourse appearance at Ascot in July 1974. He won the Granville Stakes over six furlongs, defeating his stable companion No Alimony, who went on to win the Craven Stakes and the Predominate Stakes in 1975. In August he won the Sirenia Stakes over the same distance at Kempton from Prospect Rainbow. In September, Grundy was sent to Doncaster to contest the Champagne Stakes in which he was matched against the Coventry Stakes winner Whip It Quick. Eddery struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but succeeded in getting Grundy to the line half a length ahead of Whip It Quick without having to use the whip. On his final start of the season, Grundy ran in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. In this race he was pitted against the Irish-trained Steel Heart, an exceptionally fast colt who had won the Gimcrack Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. Racing on soft ground for the first time, Grundy went to the front two furlongs from the finish and pulled clear to beat Steel Heart by six lengths. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best British juveniles, Grundy was placed first with a rating of 133. Timeform rated him the best two-year-old in Europe on 134. 1975:three-year-old season Grundy's preparation for the British Classic Races was interrupted in March by a training accident at Seven Barrows when he was kicked in the face by another three-year-old colt, Corby. He made his three-year-old debut in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury in April. Running on very heavy ground he lost his unbeaten record when he finished second by two lengths to Mark Anthony. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket, Grundy started 7/2 favourite in a field of 24 runners but finished second again, beaten half a length by the 33/1 outsider Bolkonski. The start of the race had been delayed for twenty minutes by protests by striking stable lads. Grundy was then sent to Ireland for the Irish 2,000 Guineas at the Curragh. He took the lead at the midway point of the race and \\"romped away\\" to win comfortably by one and a half lengths from the French-trained Monsanto with Mark Anthony a length a way in third to record his first win of the season. On 4 June Grundy was sent off the 5/1 second favourite for The Derby. The Derby attracted a crowd reported to number 750,000, which included the Queen Elizabeth II, the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh. The 6/4 favourite for the race was the French-trained Green Dancer, who had won the Observer Gold Cup on his previous visit to Britain, and had since won the Poule d'Essai des Poulains and the Prix Lupin. Grundy was restrained by Eddery in the early stages before moving up to fourth place on the turn into the straight. Grundy overtook the front-running Anne's Pretender to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and pulled clear to win by three lengths from the filly Nobiliary with Hunza Dancer in third. Three weeks after his win at Epsom, Grundy was sent to the Curragh for the Irish Derby for which he started 9/10 favourite. Despite trailing in seventh place coming into the home straight, he broke away from the field in the closing stages and won decisively by two lengths from King Pellinore and Anne's Pretender. =Britain's \\"Race of the Century\\"= In The Observer's list of the \\"10 greatest horse races of all time,\\" the match between Grundy and Bustino in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on July 26, 1975 was ranked number two. Three-year-old Grundy started 5/4 on favourite against a very solid field in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes that was open to older horses. The participants included Eclipse Stakes winner [and later winner of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe], Star Appeal, Dibidale, winner of the 1974 Irish Oaks, Nelson Bunker Hunt's mare, Dahlia, one of the greatest female horses in Thoroughbred racing history and winner of this race in 1973 and 1974, and Lady Beaverbrook's four- year-old horse Bustino, the winner of the previous year's St. Leger Stakes Classic. Bustino's two pacemaker stablemates, Highest and Kinglet, set a blistering early pace in the 2,414 metre (1½ miles) race that was designed to wear down Grundy, to diminish his trademark finishing acceleration. With the pacemakers' jobs done and half a mile left to run, Bustino and jockey Joe Mercer moved into the lead. He was ahead by four lengths by the time they entered the top of the straight when Pat Eddery on Grundy mounted a charge. The two horses began pulling away from the rest of the field and with a furlong left to run, Grundy caught and passed Bustino who in turn refused to quit and retook the lead. Just fifty yards from the finish line, a relentless Grundy fought back and recaptured the lead, holding off Bustino's continued furious effort to win by half a length after a \\"thrilling duel\\" with Dahlia another five lengths behind in third. Grundy's winning time of 2:26.98 broke the race record by almost two and a half seconds, the record stood until 2010 when Harbinger ran 2:26.78 over a slightly modified course. As sometimes happens, a race of this nature took a toll on both horses. Bustino and Grundy appeared totally exhausted as they returned to the unsaddling enclosure. Bustino never raced again. Despite immediate concerns, Grundy appeared to recover well from his exertions and reappeared three weeks later in the Benson and Hedges Gold Cup at York. He failed to reproduce anything approaching his best form however, and finished a tired fourth behind Dahlia, Card King and Star Appeal, all of whom he had beaten comfortably at Ascot. Grundy was then retired to stud. Assessment and honours In 1974, Grundy was given a rating of 134 by Timeform, making him the top-rated two-year-old in Europe. He was also the top-rated juvenile in the Free Handicap. In 1975, Grundy was Timeform's highest rated horse with a rating of 137. Grundy's 1975 rating was the sixth highest rating given to any British three-year-old colt up to that time, behind Tudor Minstrel, Mill Reef, Brigadier Gerard, Pappa Fourway and Abernant. Grundy's earnings of £326,421 broke the record for a horse trained in Britain or Ireland which had previously been held by Mill Reef. The record was broken by The Minstrel in 1977. In 1975, Grundy was voted British Horse of the Year by the Racegoers' Club, receiving 38 of the 40 votes. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Grundy a \\"great\\" Derby winner and the twenty-fifth best British or Irish racehorse of the 20th century. Stud career Until 1984, Grundy stood at the British National Stud. A moderately successful stallion, Grundy's Group One winners include the 1980 Epsom Oaks winner, Bireme, the 1981 Gran Premio d'Italia winner, Kirtling, and the 1983 Ascot Gold Cup victor, Little Wolf. In November 1983, Grundy was sold for £1,600,000 and exported to stand in Japan where he died in 1992.

Childhood and youth He was an intern at the Colegio San Jose de Asuncion, an institution he was to call “a jail” more than once, which shows his vital and free spirit as a youth. Besides philosophy and math, he also dedicated himself to literary criticism and especially to poetry. In the prologue of the second edition of “Ceniza Redimida” the scholar Miguel Angel Fernandez writes: “An unhappy childhood, far away from his parents, apparently marked his life, and in his poetry we may find the traces of this first stage of his life. His adolescence and youth were not more fortunate...” His value as a poet is undeniable. All of the scholars on Paraguayan literature say that his work is the starting point of a new poetic conception joining the not always easy new path of vanguardism. In his book “La poesia paraguaya - Historia de una incognita” the critical and intellectual Brazilian Walter Wey says: “Campos Cervera put the Paraguayan literature in the American rhythm and at the same level of the actual poetry of the continent. For that, he didn't need to get into the heart of the Hispanic-American. He only did what was expected from his country: a deep study of the modern natives which stayed in the objective aspects of life and nature. He then moved to the social and human subjects deepening, taking advantage of the immense and unexplored folk stories. In this sense, he also opened the way to the new generations. If he didn’t show completely the revelation of Paraguay as it was expected from his intuition, he did show how the future could be revealed. He also showed that in almost 100 years of poetry, the Paraguayan poets despite describing the county they didn’t identify with it and the life style.” History He was a collaborator of magazines such as Juventud, Ideal and Alas in the 1920s, his production of the time is similar to the current of the postmodernism. He used to sign with the pseudonym \\"Alfonso Monteverde”. In 1931, his participation in the acts of October 23 marked his first exile, first to Buenos Aires, Argentina and then to Montevideo, Uruguay. By then, he was clear in his ideas towards the left, maybe influenced by the anarchy and the Marxist socialists he contacted in Argentina and Uruguay. In 1938, three years after his return to Paraguay, together with Josefina Pla - who was also back from Europe after the death of her husband, Julian de la Herreriam - he is located in the centre of a movement which has, among others, Augusto Roa Bastos, Oscar Ferreiro, Ezequiel Gonzalez Alsina and Hugo Rodriguez Alcala as members, who were later to be known as “Generacion del 40” in Paraguayan literature. The meeting place of those young people was the “Vy’a raity” - soon Elvio Romero joined - and his productions are to be read in magazines such as the Ateneo Paraguayo, Noticias and the literary supplement of the newspaper “El Pais“. In 1940, when the president of the republic, General Jose Felix Estigarribia, died in a mysterious aviation accident, General Higinio Morinigo took over. He was in the same political line of the nationalist authoritarians of fascist Europe; his government will last until 1948. A year before, in 1947, one of the worst phases of a bloody civil war was to take place, which among many things deprived the country of the talent and creativity of its best artists and intellectuals. Among them, Herib went into exile to Buenos Aires, until he died. Cesar Alonso de las Heras and Juan Manuel Marcos, wrote in a text for students of the Paraguayan contemporary literature that \\"Campos Cervera is the father of Paraguayan literature. Although in fiction, essays and theater he might have to dispute first place with Casaccia, Barrett and Correa, respectively, we cannot doubt his influence on poetry. His poems…show for the first time in this country mastery of surrealist metaphors, the techniques of Neruda, the rhythm of Nicolas Guillen, the nostalgic air of Albertito whom he dedicated his work Regresarán un día (English: \\"They shall return one day\\"). \\"The nostalgia and the hope, the verbal elegance and the spiritual transparency distinguish his very personal style, deeply rooted in the national circumstances of the poet.\\" Works In 1950 he published his only poetry book available during his lifetime, Ceniza redimida, which gathered 28 of his best poems. “Hombre secreto” was his second poem book, which was to appear after his death. Other works were the story “El buscador de fe”, the short novel El ojo enterrado, and the theatre play Juan Hachero, which was not produced on stage and still unedited, as well as his novel Hombres en la selva and the poem book Romancero del destierro, which originals were taken during his exile in Montevideo. Last years He was married to Tita de los Rios, and later divorced. He had children with Maria Carmen Palermo. He died in Buenos Aires, on August 28, 1953. The journalist Humberto Perez Caceres, workmate of Herib in the newspaper “ Democracia” in Buenos Aires, transmitted his last words to his country: ”The art, the politics, the cultural works, must drink the best of the nationality. The process has an itinerary from the national to the universal, not the opposite. Let it not be a useless art, not beauty divorced from the country. The country, his service, his redemption, its happiness, its justice must constitute the motivation of all work. The national... our country, our men, our countrymen, and workmen, our women. It is to them, to their elevation, that he artist must dedicate all of their efforts.” References * Diccionario Biográfico \\"FORJADORES DEL PARAGUAY\\", Primera Edicción Enero de 2000.

Physical appearances vary widely and often show the blending of European, Amerindian, and African features that has occurred over many generations. Most Central Americans, as is other Latin Americans, are mestizos. Mestizos have both European and American Indian ancestors and, in some cases, African ancestors as well. Their European ancestors were mostly Spaniards. Most Spaniards possess typical Mediterranean features - olive skin, dark hair and eyes. Their Indian ancestors were living in what is now Latin America when the Spaniards arrived. The European ancestors of Brazilians are mostly Portuguese. Most of the African ancestors were brought as slaves to the region while it was in Spanish control. Some Colombians are of mixed Spanish and African descent (known as mulattoes), with their African ancestors having been brought over by the Spaniards to work as slaves, while many other Colombians are of Amerindian, Arab, German, Italian and Spanish descent. Most Argentine-Australians are of Spanish and/or Italian descent, though other ethnic groups such as the British, Eastern Europeans, Arabs, Mestizos, Mulattoes and Asians also immigrated to Argentina.

In a racing career which lasted from the spring of 1944 until June 1945 he ran nine times and won eight races. He was the top-rated British two-year-old of 1944 when he was unbeaten in six races including the Coventry Stakes and the Middle Park Stakes. In 1945 he was beaten when favourite for the 2000 Guineas but won the Derby, despite being afflicted by an eye condition which eventually left him completely blind. He was retired to a successful stud career before dying in 1956. Background Dante was a brown horse with a small white star and one white foot, bred and owned by Sir Eric Ohlson at Manor House Stud in Middleham in North Yorkshire. His dam, Rosy Legend won four races in her native France before being sent to England as a four-year-old. In 1941 she was covered by the stallion Nearco and conceived the foal who would become Dante. In Autumn she was offered for sale following the death of her owner, Lord Furness and was bought for 3,500 guineas by Ohlson. She later went on to produce Dante's full brother Sayajirao, who won the St. Leger Stakes in 1947. Nearco went on to be the Champion sire in 1947 and 1949,http://www.tbheritage.com/HistoricSires/LeadingSires/GBLeadSires.html and one of the most important sires of the 20th century. Dante was sent into training with Matthew Peacock at Middleham. Racing career 1944: two- year-old season At age two, the colt went undefeated in six starts, and became \\"the idol of the North\\". In June he won the Coventry Stakes by four lengths. The race was run at Newmarket Racecourse instead of its customary venue of Royal Ascot because of wartime restrictions. In Autumn, he returned to Newmarket and won the Middle Park Stakes by two lengths. In the Free Handicap, a ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, Dante was rated the best British juvenile of 1944, one pound ahead of Court Martial. 1945: three- year-old season At age three, Dante attracted a large crowd for his reappearance in the Roseberry Stakes at Stockton Racecourse in April and won impressively by four lengths at odds of 1/10. After the race, his jockey, the Chorlton-cum-Hardy-born William Nevett called him \\"the finest horse I have ever ridden\\". He was then sent to Newmarket for the 2,000 Guineas and started Even money favourite in a field of twenty runners, despite reports that he had suffered an eye problem two days before the race. It was initially thought that he had been injured by a piece of grit: in fact he was suffering the early stages of a degenerative disease which eventually blinded him. In an upset, he was beaten a neck by Court Martial with another son of Nearco, Royal Charger, two lengths away in third. In June, Dante started favourite at odds of 100/30 for the Derby Stakes, which was run at Newmarket despite the recent end of the war. The race attracted a crowd of 30,000, the largest for a \\"wartime\\" Derby and was attended by the King and Queen. Court Martial, regarded as a doubtful stayer on pedigree grounds, was sent off at odds of 100/9 with twenty-five other colts in opposition. Ridden by Nevett, Dante was towards the rear of the field in the early stages but accelerated past the opposition in the final quarter mile and won by two lengths from Midas, who beat Court Martial by a head for second place. Dante was the first Northern horse to win the Derby since Pretender in 1869, and his victory was received with \\"great rejoicing\\" in Yorkshire. Following his Derby win, Dante was made odds-on favourite for the St Leger. In August, rumours about Dante's condition began to circulate, and on 25 August Peacock withdrew the horse as he said that the colt could not be \\"made good\\" in time for the race. It was reported that the colt was suffering from \\"leg stiffness\\" which did not respond to treatment. Dante never ran again and was retired to stud. Assessment and honours In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Dante a \\"superior\\" Derby winner, and the thirty-ninth best horse trained in Britain or Ireland in the 20th century. Phil Bull, the founder of Timeform, called Dante \\"one of the best horses of the century\\". Stud record Retired to Theakston Stud in Theakston, North Yorkshire, Dante proved a successful sire whose offspring included: * Toulouse Lautrec (b. 1950) - won Gran Premio d'Italia, Gran Premio di Milano * Darius (b. 1951) - won Champagne Stakes (1953), July Stakes (1953), 2,000 Guineas (1954), St. James's Palace Stakes (1954), Eclipse Stakes (1955) * Carrozza (b. 1954) - won Epsom Oaks for owner, Queen Elizabeth II * Discorea (b. 1956) - won 1959 Irish Oaks Dante died in 1956 and was buried at the Theakston Stud.

He was loaned out to a number of lower division clubs, namely Clydebank, Alloa Athletic, Queen's Park and Hamilton Academical. Since 2003 he has played more regularly, mainly at the First Division level. Stewart was first choice goalkeeper throughout the second half of season 2006–07 for First Division side Livingston, where he played the last dozen or so games after ousting Mariusz Liberda from the number one jersey. After being released by Livingston's new owners, Stewart signed for Division One rivals Morton in May 2008. Stewart was originally expected to be the first choice goalkeeper for season 2008–09, however after a shaky début against Clyde at Broadwood on 2 August 2008, he was dropped for the former St Johnstone goalkeeper Kevin Cuthbert, who was listed as a trialist on the substitutes bench for that game. After this he spent most of his début season in the stand, with manager Davie Irons preferring to list youth players Kieran Cannon and Ryan McWilliams as the back-up goalkeepers to Cuthbert. Despite having a year left on his contract with Morton, he was told in May 2009 that he was free to find another club. Since then he turned himself into the club's first choice goalkeeper, and signed a new contract in June 2010. He was released by the club in May 2012 and claimed that the signing of Alan Combe in March, after he sustained a broken toe, forced him to leave the club to find regular football elsewhere. Stewart became a goalkeeping coach in Qatar, with Al-Khor Sports Club in August 2013. Stewart returned to Scotland during February 2013, playing three trial matches for Stranraer before signing for Cowdenbeath. After leaving Central Park, Stewart signed for Airdrieonians after a free transfer on 8 June 2013 and signed a one-year contract. On 27 August 2013, after the club's League Cup second round defeat at home to Livingston, Stewart had to be restrained by stewards as he argued with a fellow fan as he headed up the tunnel at full-time. On 30 August 2013, Stewart departed the club by mutual consent.http://www.acadvertiser.co.uk/coatbridge-airdrie-sport/lanarkshire- football/airdrieonians-fc/2013/08/28/airdrieonians-v-livingston-match- review-65864-33777588/http://www.airdriefc.com/news/2013/08/squad.html On 9 November 2013, it was announced that Stewart had signed for Raith Rovers. International  Stewart made one appearance for the Scotland u21 side keeping a clean sheet in a 1-0 victory over Latvia. Stewart now coaches the goalkeepers for the Scotland U15 side. Coaching career Stewart was appointed as co-manager of Junior club Kilwinning Rangers in February 2014 alongside former Queen of the South and Ayr United player Chris Strain. Stewart joined the Rangers F.C. Academy becoming the head of Academy goalkeeping. Personal life Stewart is the son of former Scotland goalkeeper Jim Stewart and is married to women's football star Julie Fleeting. They have three daughters named Ella, Sophia and Matilda. Stewart was born in England when his father was playing for Middlesbrough. The Stewarts returned to Scotland later on that year, when Jim signed for Rangers.

Red municipalities are directly involved, while the green have had similar products from Terra Securities The Terra Securities scandal was a scandal that became public in November 2007. It involved highly speculative investments by eight municipalities of Norway in various hedge funds in the United States bond market.Mark Landler: \\"U.S. Credit Crisis Adds to Gloom in Arctic Norway\\" New York Times, December 2, 2007 (Retrieved on December 2, 2007) The funds were sold by Terra Securities to the municipalities, while the products were delivered by Citigroup. The municipalities involved were Narvik, Rana, Hattfjelldal and Hemnes in Nordland, Vik and Bremanger in Sogn og Fjordane, Haugesund in Rogaland, and Kvinesdal in Vest-Agder, all large producers of hydroelectricity. The investments were very complicated in nature. They were geared, and they involved high risk through a small upside but a very large downside. Terra Securities, now bankrupt, was a subsidiary of Terra Markets, which is owned 66.73% by Terra-Gruppen, an alliance and co-branding company owned by 78 local savings banks in Norway. The remaining 33.27% was owned by the management of the company. Citigroup is the third largest bank in the United States. Background In 2001, Vik municipality found a loophole in the Municipality Act and invested borrowed money in the stock market, by first investing and then seeking permission later. This utilization of the loophole was confirmed by the Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development in 2002, because the money borrowed was secured in future income. Vik had borrowed through DnB Markets based on annual payments of NOK 10M, secured through income from hydroelectric power production. This money was then invested in bonds through Terra Securities in 2001 and 2002. In the same year, in 2001, the four Nordland municipalities Narvik, Rana, Hemnes and Hattfjelldal borrowed money to invest in complicated bonds issued by Citigroup and sold through Terra Securities. The municipalities also signed a confidentiality clause with Terra, which ensured that no independent third party could evaluate the quality of the investments. It has been questioned if such a clause, under the circumstances, was legal. In Narvik's case, part of the capital came from the municipal sale of 50% of Narvik Energi, the municipal power company, in 2002 to DONG Energy and HelgelandsKraft. The other three municipalities had ownership in HelgelandsKraft (Rana 26.8%, Hemnes 7.0% and Hattfjelldal 2.5%) as well as property tax income from power stations owned by Statkraft. These municipalities were investing future income from these sources. The main advisors in Terra were Knut Anders Opstad and Harald Norberg. They had tried to sell the investments to all municipalities with income from power production by contacting the Association of Norwegian Power Municipalities, but had been rejected by the organization. Nature of the investments After the reinvestment in 2007, the municipalities gained a potential upside on their investments of between 0.5% and 3.0% above risk-free placements, but instead risked losing not only their entire investment, but in a worst-case scenario twice what they invested. A total of NOK 451 million was invested, but was 'geared' by borrowing an additional amount corresponding to ten times the investment, so that - in reality - the municipalities were actually investing between NOK 4 and 5 billion. In a worst-case scenario the municipalities could lose NOK 900 million. The investment model was so complex that the CEO of Terra Securities could not confirm that even he actually understood how it worked. The deficit from the investment came in late 2007 caused by a credit bubble in the United States. The investments made by Haugesund involved a placement of NOK 227.5M as a security for Citigroup, in case loans to United States municipalities were defaulted beyond 3.32%; Haugesund would have to pay this to Citigroup. The mayor of Haugesund, Petter Steen jr. claims that he thought the municipality was buying a bond in Statkraft. Instead they were selling such a bond as security for the hedging they were performing for Citigroup. Total investments in Terra/Citigroup scheme: * Bremanger: NOK 170 million * Hattfjelldal: 103M * Haugesund: 220M * Hemnes: 84M * Kvinesdal 32M * Narvik: 52M * Rana: 297M * Vik: 38.5M Reaction to the scandal After the financial newspaper Finansavisen began reporting the case, and the municipalities suspected that they had been misled, they hired expertise from the law firm Lund & Co. as well the financial advisory firm Pareto. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway announced that they would perform an investigation of the case, regarding the legality of the products sold and the information provided by Terra. Minister of Local Government and Regional Development Magnhild Meltveit Kleppa asked the County Governor of Nordland to investigate whether the agreements made were legal according to the Municipality Act. Terra-Gruppen started an internal investigation, but has since only relocated the two advisors, claiming that top management could not be held responsible for any issues in connection with the products. However, Sverre Leiro, CEO of NorgesGruppen and one of the two independent members of the board of Terra-Gruppen resigned on 23 November 2007, claiming that remaining as a board member could tarnish his and NorgesGruppen's reputation. On 26 November 2007, Terra announced that they were willing to take the downside of the investments made in 2007 by the four Nordland municipalities, a total loss of NOK 150M. This would result in a net loss for the municipalities of NOK 150M. By 27 November the municipalities had rejected the offer. Local politicians in Narvik feared that they would be forced to sell the remaining stake in Narvik Energi if they could not extract themselves from the agreement with Terra. On 28 November 2007, the Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway announced that they would withdraw all operating licenses held by Terra Securities. Director of the authority, Bjørn Skogstad Aamo said the reasons were \\"numerous and serious breaches of requirements for good and correct information to clients\\". Subsequently, the company filed for bankruptcy and the CEO of Terra-Gruppen, Ola Sundt Ravnestad, announced his resignation. Ravnestad will receive NOK 5.5 million in remuneration after he retires from the job. Due to the bankruptcy of Terra Securities, Citigroup announced, on 30 November 2007, that they would sell the funds on the open market, essentially inflicting a cost of approx. NOK 350M on the municipalities. On 7 December 2007 Tønsberg District Court gave the eight municipalities arrest in all personal property of the broker Knut Anders Opstad, including his private holding company, Opstad Invest AS. Representatives for the municipalities indicated they would also seek arrest of the other involved parties' property. On 17 June 2008, the municipality of Rana dismissed their Chief Municipal Officer, Jan Reitehaug, and the Financial Director. This was the result of an independent consultant report that concluded that the municipality had breached four paragraphs of the Municipality Act as well as the municipalities' own financial policies. Furthermore, it revealed that the Chief Municipal Officer did not realise that the representatives were brokers — but thought they were merely advisors. The administration also failed to obtain political approval for several of the transactions, and failed to register broker fees because they did understand what they were. In August 2008, several of the municipalities announced they were considering taking legal action against Citigroup, in either the United Kingdom or the United States, to hold Citigroup responsible for the losses. On 8 September, the eight municipal councils involved unanimously voted to hold DnB NOR and Depfa Bank liable for their losses, by issuing loans that were illegal according to the Municipality Act. The municipalities will no longer honour the loan commitments, and stop payments. Kjell-Idar Juvik claimed he hoped the banks would be willing to negotiate the matter, and hoped to avoid legal proceedings, but said that municipalities would not hesitate to bring the matter to court. DnB Nor announced that following day that they are considering taking legal action against the municipalities to force them to continue payments. Press coverage The incident has been subject to extensive press coverage with headlines and entire first pages in both local and national newspapers, as well as in-depth research articles in the financial press. TV coverage has involved both news and debate programs on several channels, along with the inevitable ironic comments by comedians in various satirical TV shows. Parties involved  *Eight municipalities, which, it is claimed, were inadequately informed by Terra Securities representatives of the high risks involved. Also, the legality of furnishing \\"future expected income\\" as security for loans has been questioned. The municipalities risk huge losses from their speculative investments. The municipalities have been represented by their mayors: **Asgeir Almås (Labour, Hattfjelldal) **Karen Margrethe Kuvaas (Labour, Narvik) **Kjell-Idar Juvik (Labour, Hemnes) **Erik Lidal (Centre, Vik) **Odd Omland (Labour, Kvinesdal) **Petter Steen jr.

While \\"the risks were clearly conveyed by Citigroup to Terra\\" (according representatives from Citigroup), the risks of the prospects were allegedly not communicated to the final buyers.

The letter dated November 27, 2007 from The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway to Terra Securities ASA, states that \\"The Supervisory Authority contends that Terra Securities ASA's presentation appears inadequate and misleading, as central elements such as the possibility of potential extra payments and losses, together with the size of these, has been omitted.

While this includes when one of the children uses physical force, threats, trickery or emotional manipulation to elicit cooperation, it also can include non-coercive situations where the initiator proposes or starts a sexual act that the victim does not understand the nature of and simply goes along with, not comprehending its implications or what the consequences might be. Child-on- child sexual abuse is differentiated from normative sexual play or anatomical curiosity and exploration (e.g. \\"playing doctor\\") because child-on-child sexual abuse is an overt and deliberate action directed at sexual stimulation, including orgasm. When sexual abuse is perpetrated by one sibling upon another, it is known as \\"inter-sibling abuse\\". When victims of inter-sibling child-on-child sexual abuse grow up, they often have distorted recall of the act, such as thinking it was consensual or that they were the initiator. Causes In the case of child-on-child sexual abuse, young children who have not matured sexually are incapable of knowing about specific sex acts without an external source. Consequently, children who initiate or solicit overtly sexual acts with other children most often have been sexually victimized by an adult beforehand,Drew Pinsky, MD and Ted Stryker (November 5, 2007) \\"Loveline\\" (audio interview, 0:38:45-0:40:31). lovelineshow.com. Retrieved November 15, 2007. or by another child who was in turn abused by an adult.Marshall, W.L. (1997). Pedophilia: Psychopathology and theory. In D. R. Laws &W.; O’Donohue (Eds.), Sexual deviance: Theory, assessment, and treatment (pp. 152–174). New York: Guilford. More than half have been victimized by two or more perpetrators. In some instances, the perpetrating child was exposed to pornography or repeatedly witnessed sexual activity of adults at a very young age, and this can also be considered a form of child sexual abuse. In many cases, a child or adolescent may have no intent to cause any harm to another child, and they act merely on a passing impulse. However, this act may still result in harm to the other child and is a form of child-on-child sexual abuse.\\"Do Children Sexually Abuse Other Children? Preventing Sexual Abuse Among Children and Youth\\" , \\"Stop It Now!\\", 2007 Furthermore, children who had experience an unwanted sexual approach may not understand that this act was crime against themselves. Prevalence Child-on-child sexual abuse frequently goes unreported because it is not widely known of in the public, and often occurs outside of adults' direct supervision. Even if known by adults, it is sometimes dismissed as harmless by those who do not understand the implications. In particular, inter-sibling abuse is under-reported relative to the reporting rates for parent–child sexual abuse, and disclosure of the incest by the victim during childhood is rare. Effects Children who were sexually victimized by other minors, including inter-sibling abuse, show largely the same problems as children victimized by adults, including anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse, suicide, eating disorders, post traumatic stress disorder, sleep disorders and difficulty trusting peers in the context of relationships. The victim often thinks that the act was normal, including thinking they were the initiator or that they went through the act voluntarily. Major factors that affect the severity of symptoms include the use of force or coercion, the frequency of the abuse, and the invasiveness of the act.Brown, Janelle C., Ph.D. (September, 2004). \\"Child-on-child sexual abuse: An investigation of behavioral and emotional sequelae,\\" University of Pennsylvania, p. 1539. An increased risk of victimization later in life has also been reported. The term minor sex offenders may be used for children under 18 years old that have initiated any non-consensual sexual activity with another person. This population may be viewed as a younger version of sexual perpetrators and may be assessed as part of a same group, when they represent a significant heterogenous group. For example, these children tend to exhibit different motivations for their actions than adult sexual offenders and they tend to respond more favorably to treatment.

Onslow was born in Guildford, Surrey in 1731. He entered the British Army as an ensign in the 1st Regiment of Foot Guards on 17 February 1748 and became a captain in John Guise's Regiment of Foot on 12 January 1751. Onslow continued to rise in the Army, and was promoted major in the 57th Regiment of Foot on 3 August 1757. He returned to his original regiment, the Foot Guards, on 27 March 1759 with the rank of captain-lieutenant and was promoted lieutenant-colonel on 7 November 1759. He entered the House of Commons in March 1760 upon the death of his father, replacing him as one of the members for Guildford. He was known as \\"Colonel Onslow\\" in the Commons to distinguish him from his first cousin George Onslow, later Earl of Onslow. Onslow began his parliamentary career as one of the Rockingham Whigs, like his cousin George. Onslow was the only member to declare that issue no. 45 of The North Briton was not a libel on the King, and he opposed the expulsion of Wilkes from the House. As a reward for his support of the Rockingham administration, he received the post of Out- Ranger of Windsor Forest for life in 1765. In 1766, he voted for the repeal of the Stamp Act. However, Onslow's political views then took a decidedly conservative turn, supporting the Grafton and then the North ministries. In 1770, he opposed the resolutions of Burke on the disturbances in North America. In the following year, Onslow took a leading role in the efforts to block printers from reporting debates in the Commons. The resulting confrontation, fueled in turn by a report that described him as \\"little cocking George\\" (an allusion to his enjoyment of cockfighting), was a severe blow to the prestige of the North ministry, and Onslow was hanged in effigy on Tower Hill alongside an effigy of Sir Fletcher Norton, speaker and fellow- member for Guildford. Onslow remained a steadfast supporter of North, opposing efforts to make peace after the surrender of Burgoyne at Saratoga. He also opposed the petitions for economic reform debated in 1780, and the Contractor's Bill in 1781. He voted against the motion of no confidence that unseated the ministry in March 1782, and followed North into opposition. Onslow supported the return of North in the Fox-North Coalition, but retired from Parliament in 1784. Onslow died in 1792 at Dunsborough House, Ripley, Surrey, after suffering a carriage accident. He had married Jane Thorp, sister of Robert Thorp, on 29 July 1752. They had five children: *Richard Onslow (b. 1754) *Pooley Onslow (b. 1758), married on 23 January 1788 Rear Admiral Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet; married on 13 June 1801 Arthur Onslow (1759–1833) *George Onslow (b. 1764) *Rev.

It has previously been called the Green Spring Academy Shoreditch, Bethnal Green Academy, Bethnal Green Technology College, Bethnal Green High School, Daneford School, and Daniel Street School. It is known as the school attended by the Kray twins as well as by Sharmeena Begum and the Bethnal Green trio. History Mulberry Academy Shoreditch originated as Mansford Secondary School, which was founded in 1896, and Daniel Street School, founded in 1900. In the 1940s, the Kray twins attended Daniel Street. In 1959, the two schools merged to create Daneford School (a portmanteau of Daniel and Mansford), a secondary modern on Gosset Street. In 1965, Daneford acquired new buildings designed by London County Council, and became a single-sex school for boys. It acquired comprehensive status in 1973.leftFrom the late 1970s, the area of East London around Daneford started experiencing increasing racial tensions, and Bangladeshi students at Daneford experienced racist attacks. The Campaign Against Racism in Schools (CARS) was set up at Daneford, and teachers took part in demonstrations campaigning for the Inner London Education Authority (ILEA) to adopt an anti-racist policy. In 1982, The Daneford Trust was founded at the school, a charity that facilitates youth overseas exchanges. In 1997, Daneford School became Bethnal Green High School when it became co-educational and started accepting female students. Shortly after, its name changed again to Bethnal Green Technology College. In 2005, the school went into special measures as a result of an Ofsted inspection. The headteacher resigned and was replaced by an interim headteacher, Keith Holt. Mark Keary was appointed headteacher in June 2006 and in 2007 the school came out of special measures. Keary was praised by Charles, Prince of Wales in a 2008 visit for the use of teachers from the Teach First scheme in the school. In 2010, the school benefitted from a £17 million refurbishment with money from the Building Schools for the Future scheme. Controversially, in July 2011 the governors of the school voted to adopt academy status. The decision was said to split the local Labour Party group on Tower Hamlets London Borough Council. The school became Bethnal Green Academy in January 2012 and a sixth form was opened in September that year. Bethnal Green Academy was rated 'Outstanding' in an Ofsted inspection in December 2012. In December 2014, a female pupil at the school, Sharmeena Begum, left the UK to join the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). In February 2015, three more female pupils known as the Bethnal Green trio - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana - left via Turkey to join ISIL. Five further female pupils at the school were subject to a travel ban and were made wards of court to prevent them leaving the country. Counter-extremism officers from the Department for Education investigated the school. In order to shake off the negative associations, the school was renamed Green Spring Academy Shoreditch in 2015. At the request of the AQA and Pearson exam boards, an independent investigation was launched into allegations of exam-fixing at the school. Its conclusion led to several staff, including the headteacher Mark Keary, being suspended in February 2017. Several teachers left following the disciplinary process. Keary launched an Employment Tribunal claim in response, arguing wrongful dismissal and disability discrimination. In 2019, he was cleared of any wrongdoing by the Teaching Regulation Agency. In September 2018, the school was transferred to the control of the Mulberry Schools Trust and renamed Mulberry Academy Shoreditch.

History  Origins 1912-1941  The Pro Arte String Quartet was founded by Alphonse Onnou in Brussels in 1912.Thus the official website. According to (Eaglefield-Hull 1924), in 1922. After becoming the Court Quartet to Queen Elizabeth of Belgium, the quartet began the first of many international tours in 1919. After the First World War it became famous for the performance of modern music and for its extensive recordings of Haydn. The composers Bartók, Milhaud and Honegger entrusted to the ensemble new works to premiere. The Pro Arte Quartet made its American debut in 1926 in New York and returned for 30 tours to the United States, often under the auspices of the chamber music patron Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge. It performed at the inauguration of the Hall of Music at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC. In 1932 it was named the \\"Quatuor de la Cour de Belgique\\". Its first visit to Madison, Wisconsin was in 1938. Two years later, the musicians were stranded in Madison by the outbreak of World War II and accepted a residency at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the first such residency at a major American university. The Royal Conservatory of Brussels holds a comprehensive collection of autograph and printed Second Violin scores from Laurent Halleux, who joined the Pro Arte Quartet when he was only fifteen and stayed with the group till 1943. It sheds light on the works performed by the quartet, especially from American composers from the early XXe s. such as Aaron Copland, Roy Harris or Louis Gruenberg.  1941-1947  While touring in Wisconsin in 1941 they were offered a permanent residency. In 1944, following the disbanding of the Kolisch Quartet, Rudolf Kolisch took up leadership of the Pro Arte in 1944, combined with a Wisconsin Professorship. In 1946, Robert Maas became the original cellist in the newly formed Paganini Quartet. In 1947, violist Germain Prevost, the last of the original members, resigned. In the late 1950s, the Pro Arte Quartet became members of the University's School of Music faculty in addition to being artists-in-residence.See the history of the quartet in the official website  Centennial anniversary commissioning project 2011-2012  The Pro Arte Quartet reached its centennial anniversary in 2012.

Anthromes were first named and mapped by Erle Ellis and Navin Ramankutty in their 2008 paper, \\"Putting People in the Map: Anthropogenic Biomes of the World\\". Anthrome maps now appear in numerous textbooks and in the National Geographic World Atlas  Anthropogenic transformation of the Biosphere  For more than a century, the biosphere has been described in terms of global ecosystem units called biomes, which are vegetation types like tropical rainforests and grasslands that are identified in relation to global climate patterns. Considering that human populations and their use of land have fundamentally altered global patterns of ecosystem form, process, and biodiversity, anthropogenic biomes provide a framework for integrating human systems with the biosphere in the Anthropocene.  Before 1700  Humans have been altering ecosystems since we have evolved. Evidence suggests that our ancestors were burning land to clear it at one million years ago. 600,000 years ago, humans were using spears to kill horses and other large animals in Great Britain and China. For the past tens of thousands of years, humans have greatly changed the plant and animal life around the globe, from what type of wildlife and plant life dominated to what type of ecosystems dominate. Examples include Native Americans; they altered the forest, burnt land to clear it, settled in cities, disrupting forests and other ecosystems, and built monuments that required moving large amounts of earth, such as the Cahokia Monuments. More examples are the civilizations of the ancient world; they mined large amounts of material, made roads, and especially for the Romans, when mining lead, released large amounts of mercury and lead into the air. They also moved large numbers of animals for entertainment, disrupting wildlife patterns. Archaeological evidence reveals that human societies have been transforming landscapes through different forms of land use around the world for more than 10,000 years, leaving most transformed by hunter-gatherers, farmers, and pastoralists by 3000 years ago.  Agriculture (1700–present)  Humans have been altering ecosystems since before agriculture first developed, and as the human population has grown and become more technologically advanced over time, the land use for agricultural purposes has increased significantly. The anthropogenic biome in the 1700s, before the industrial revolution, was made up of mostly wild, untouched land, with no human settlement disturbing the natural state.Ellis, E. C. (2011). Anthropogenic transformation of the terrestrial biosphere.Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences, 369(1938), 1010-1035. In this time period, most of the Earth's ice-free land consisted of wildlands and natural anthromes, and it wasn't until after the industrial revolution in the 19th century that land use for agriculture and human settlements started to increase.Ellis, E. C., Klein Goldewijk, K., Siebert, S., Lightman, D., & Ramankutty, N. (2010). Anthropogenic transformation of the biomes, 1700 to 2000. Global Ecology and Biogeography, 19(5), 589-606. With technology advancing and manufacturing processes becoming more efficient, the human population was beginning to thrive, and was subsequently requiring and using more natural resources. By the year 2000, over half of the Earth's ice free land was transformed into rangelands, croplands, villages and dense settlements, which left less than half of the Earth's land untouched. Anthropogenic changes between 1700 and 1800 were far smaller than those of the following centuries, and as such the rate of change has increased over time. As a result, the 20th century had the fastest rate of anthropogenic ecosystem transformation of the past 300 years.  Land distribution  As the human population steadily increased in numbers throughout history, the use of natural resources and land began to increase, and the distribution of land used for various agricultural and settlement purposes began to change. The use of land around the world was transformed from its natural state to land used for agriculture, settlements and pastures to sustain the population and its growing needs. The distribution of land among anthromes underwent a shift away from natural anthromes and wildlands towards human-altered anthromes we are familiar with today. Now, the most populated anthromes (dense settlements and villages) account for only a small fraction of the global ice-free land. From the year 1700-2000, lands used for agriculture and urban settlements increased significantly, however the area occupied by rangelands increased even more rapidly, so that it became the dominant anthrome in the 20th century. As a result, the biggest global land-use change as a result of the industrial revolution, was the expansion of pastures.  Human population  Following the industrial revolution, the human population experienced a rapid increase. The human population density in certain anthromes began to change, shifting away from rural environments to urban settlements, where the population density was much higher. These changes in population density between areas shifted global patterns of anthrome emergence, and also had wide-spread effects on various ecosystems. Half of the Earth's population now lives in cities, and most people reside in urban anthromes, with some populations dwelling in smaller cities and towns. Currently, human populations are expected to grow until at least midcentury, and the transformation of the Earth's anthromes are expected to follow this growth.  Current state of the anthropogenic biosphere  The present state of the terrestrial biosphere is predominantly anthropogenic. More than half of the terrestrial biosphere remains unused directly for agriculture or urban settlements, and of these unused lands still remaining, less than half are wildlands. Most of Earth's unused lands are now within the agricultural and settled landscapes of semi- natural, rangeland, cropland and village anthromes.  Major anthromes  Anthromes include dense settlements (urban and mixed settlements), villages, croplands, rangelands and semi-natural lands and have been mapped globally using two different classification systems, viewable on Google Maps and Google Earth.http://ecotope.org/anthromes/maps/ There are currently 18 anthropogenic biomes, the most prominent of which are listed below.Alessa, L., & Chapin, F. S. (2008). Anthropogenic biomes: a key contribution to earth-system science. Trends in Ecology & Evolution, 23(10), 529-531. = Dense settlements = Dense settlements are the second most densely populated regions in the world. They are defined as areas with a high population density, though the density can be variable. The Population density, however, never falls below 100 persons/km, even in the non-urban parts of the dense settlements, and it has been suggested that these areas consist of both the edges of major cities in underdeveloped nations, and the long standing small towns throughout western Europe and Asia. Most often we think of dense settlements as cities, but dense settlements can also be suburbs, towns and rural settlements with high but fragmented populations.Ellis, E. C. (2013). Sustaining biodiversity and people in the world's anthropogenic biomes. Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability, 5(3), 368-372. = Croplands = Croplands are another major anthrome throughout the world. Croplands include most of the cultivated lands of the world, and also about a quarter of global tree cover. Croplands which are locally irrigated have the highest human population density, likely due to the fact that it provides crops with a constant supply on water. This makes harvest time and crop survival more predictable. Croplands that are sustained mainly from the local rainfall are the most extensive of the populated anthromes, with annual precipitation near 1000 mm in certain areas of the globe. In these areas, there is sufficient water supplied by the climate to support all aspects of life without hardly any irrigation. However, in dryer areas, this method of agriculture would not be as productive. = Rangelands = Rangelands are a very broad anthropogenic biome group that has been described according to three levels of population density: residential, populated and remote. The Residential rangeland anthrome has two key features: its population density is never below 10 persons per square kilometre, and a substantial portion of its area is used for pasture. Pastures in rangelands are the most dominant land cover. Bare earth is significant in this anthrome, covering nearly one third of the land for every one square kilometer. Rangeland anthromes are less altered than croplands, but their alteration tends to increase with population. Domesticated grazing livestock are typically adapted to grasslands and savannas, so the alteration of these biomes tends to be less noticeable. = Forests = Forested anthromes are dominated by tree cover, and they have high precipitation and minimal human populations, where the population density is usually less than 3 persons/km². Most populated forests act as carbon sinks because of the lack of human activity. Without harmful emissions being released in the forests due to human activity, the vegetation is able to utilize carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and act as a sink. Remote forests are a little different than populated forests because the majority of the vegetation in these forests have been clear-cut for human consumption. Forests are generally cleared to sustain substantial populations of domestic livestock, and to utilize the lumber. = Indoor = Very few biologists have studied the evolutionary processes at work in indoor environments. Estimates of the extent of residential and commercial buildings range between 1.3% and 6% of global ice-free land area. This area is just as extensive as other small biomes such as flooded grass- lands and tropical coniferous forests. The indoor biome is rapidly expanding, while forest anthromes are shrinking. The indoor biome of Manhattan is almost three times as large, in terms of its floor space, as is the geographical area of the island itself, due to the buildings rising up instead of spreading out. Thousands of species live in the indoor biome, many of them preferentially or even obligatorily. The only action that humans take to alter the evolution of the indoor biome is with cleaning practices. The field of indoor biomes will continue to change as long as our culture will change. = Aquatic = Managed aquatic biomes or aquatic anthromes have rarely been studied as such. They range from fish ponds, marine shrimp and bentic farming sites to large tracts of land such as parts of the Guadalquivir Marshes in Andalusia, Spain.Ecosystem approach to Aquaculture management and biodiversity conservation in a Mediterranean coastal wetland: case study of Doniana marshes (Andalucia, Spain), United Nations Environmental Program / Mediterranean Action Plan, Tunis 2012.  Implications of an anthropogenic biosphere  Humans have fundamentally altered global patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem processes. It is no longer possible to explain or predict ecological patterns or processes across the Earth without considering the human role.Ellis, E. C. (2015). Ecology in an Anthropogenic Biosphere. Ecological Monographs. Human societies began transforming terrestrial ecology more than 50 000 years ago, and evolutionary evidence has been presented demonstrating that the ultimate causes of human transformation of the biosphere are social and cultural, not biological, chemical, or physical. Anthropogenic biomes offer a new way forward by acknowledging human influence on global ecosystems and moving us toward models and investigations of the terrestrial biosphere that integrate human and ecological systems.  Challenges facing biodiversity in the anthropogenic biosphere  = Extinctions = Over the past century, anthrome extent and land use intensity increased rapidly together with growing human populations, leaving wildlands without human population or land use in less than one quarter of the terrestrial biosphere. This massive transformation of Earth's ecosystems for human use has occurred with enhanced rates of species extinctions. Humans are directly causing species extinctions, especially of megafauna, by reducing, fragmenting and transforming native habitats and by overexploiting individual species. Current rates of extinctions vary greatly by taxa, with mammals, reptiles and amphibians especially threatened; however there is growing evidence that viable populations of many, if not most native taxa, especially plants, may be sustainable within anthromes. With the exception of especially vulnerable taxa, the majority of native species may be capable of maintaining viable populations in anthromes. = Conservation = Anthromes present an alternative view of the terrestrial biosphere by characterizing the diversity of global ecological land cover patterns created and sustained by human population densities and land use while also incorporating their relationships with biotic communities.Martin, L. J., Quinn, J. E., Ellis, E. C., Shaw, M. R., Dorning, M. A., Hallett, L. M., ... & Michel, N. L. (2014). Conservation opportunities across the world's anthromes. Diversity and distributions, 20(7), 745-755. Biomes and ecoregions are limited in that they reduce human influences, and an increasing number of conservation biologists have argued that biodiversity conservation must be extended to habitats directly shaped by humans. Within anthromes, including densely populated anthromes, humans rarely use all available land. As a result, anthromes are generally mosaics of heavily used lands and less intensively used lands. Protected areas and biodiversity hotspots are not distributed equally across anthromes. Less populated anthromes contain a greater proportion of protected areas. While 23.4% of remote woodland anthrome is protected, only 2.3% of irrigated village anthrome is protected. There is increasing evidence that suggests that biodiversity conservation can be effective in both densely and sparsely settled anthromes. Land sharing and land sparing are increasingly seen as conservation strategies.

The group \\"divided their activities between free parties and legal club nights, acting as a bridge between counter-culture and the mainstream\\".ed. Low M. and Barnett C., (2004) Spaces of Democracy: Geographical Perspectives on Citizenship, Participation and Representation, SAGE Publications, It was founded in Nottingham in 1989 as a reaction against the growing number of rave promoters whose bias was towards their own financial enrichment, rather than the joy of their party-goers. They wished to form a cohesive, collective, political front against the prevailing anti-rave legislation that was beginning to come into force at that time. This became more marked around the time of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, with DiY playing a key role in the largest illegal rave ever put on at Castlemorton Common Festival prior to the Bill and a constant stream of illegal, outdoor parties (often at travellers' sites, quarries and disused airfields) all over the country. Simon Reynolds wrote that DiY threw \\"free parties at abandoned airfields or on hilltops, drawing a mixed crowd of urban ravers and crusty road warriors\\".Reynolds, S., 1998, Energy Flash, Picador, DiY also worked successfully in the realm of legitimate club nights, with their \\"Bounce\\" night touring the country as well as being a staple of Nottingham's night life. Its popularity, connected to its lack of concern for dress codes and its non-exploitation of its loyal clubbers, coupled with its very particular form of deep, soulful, often minimal house music, led to it being recognised as one of the top ten club nights in Britain by The Times. In early 1993, they put out their first single Hothead, followed by a compilation album Strictly 4 Groovers on Warp Records. Strictly 4 Groovers also became the name of their own record label between 1993 and 1996, later to become known as DiY Discs between 1997 and 2006. The label put out releases from members of the DiY Collective, as well local artists including Atjazz, Rhythm Plate and Charles Webster. The collective's primary DJs - Simon DK, Digs and Woosh - still play at various nights in the U.K., Europe and United States. DiY continue to hold occasional free parties, typically to celebrate a milestone date - on 19 September 2009, DiY celebrated their 20th birthday with a free party in near their home town of Nottingham, and on 23 August 2014, they their 25th (Silver) birthday with a free party held in a field in Leicestershire.

They consist of a thin insulating polymer film having conductive circuit patterns affixed thereto and typically supplied with a thin polymer coating to protect the conductor circuits. The technology has been used for interconnecting electronic devices since the 1950s in one form or another. It is now one of the most important interconnection technologies in use for the manufacture of many of today's most advanced electronic products. In practice there are many different kinds of flexible circuits, including one metal layer, double sided, multilayer and rigid flex circuits. The circuits can be formed by etching metal foil cladding (normally of copper) from polymer bases, plating metal or printing of conductive inks among other processes. Flexible circuits may or may not have components attached. When components are attached, they are considered by some in the industry to be flexible electronic assemblies. Rigid flexible Example of Rigid Flex (far left hand side) Rigid flexible circuits can have circuit boards both externally or internally. They consist of multiple inner layers of flexible circuits. Advantages in rigid flexible circuits include high reliability and flexibility in design options. Rigid flexible circuits contain more materials than flat flexible circuits. The materials include rolled annealed copper, electro deposited copper, epoxy, acrylic, pre-preg, pressure sensitive, adhesiveless base material, FR-4, polyimide, polyester, solder mask, flexible solder mask, and photo image-able cover lay. Rigid flexible circuits are found in electronic products in many areas, such as, in the military and the medical field. Flat flexible Example of a simple flexible printed circuit. Flat flexible circuits are able to fold into nearly any shape due to their flexibility and smaller size. Although they are small and light-weight, they are durable and capable of handling high density. Materials in flat flexible circuits include bare copper, tin-plated copper, acrylic, pressure sensitive adhesives, polyester, photoinduced electron transfer, polyethylene naphthalate, tin, conductive silver ink, and aluminum or copper tape. Typical applications of flat flexible circuits include plotters, copiers, and printers. Advantages There are many advantages that come with using flexible circuit technology beyond the initial flex capabilities. Performance advantages, such as, dynamic flexing and increased heat dissipation allow engineers to design these circuits into applications where extreme temperatures and vibrations are common. Other advantages with using flexible circuits include less weight, increased package density, and a more integrated design. Flexible circuits can cost less than traditional assemblies because one flex assembly can replace several, single circuits. Flex circuits also allow design engineers to utilize space three dimensionally which cuts down on the overall footprint of the circuit and saves space. Applications Applications of flexible circuits ranges in a variety of fields. Flexible circuits are used in cell phones, LCD televisions, antennas, and laptops. Flexible circuits have evolved and help provide durability and reliability. Flexible circuits are also used in the aviation field. Other applications of flexible circuits are in hearing aids, calculators, cameras, printers, and in satellites.

The hamlet developed around a fort of the same name, built by English colonists in 1712 near the Mohawk village of Tionondoroge for their defense. Queen Anne ordered the fort built at the request of the Mohawk, in exchange for their allowing her to settle German Palatines in their territory. The English called the Mohawk settlement the Lower Mohawk Castle. Within a few years, the fort included an Anglican chapel, first built in logs and replaced by a stone church in 1741. It was a mission church for the Mohawk in addition to English settlers. The fort survived the wars in the region; it was taken down in 1820 to make way for construction of the Erie Canal. History  Land deed  The Fort Hunter land, approximately 80 acres on both sides of the mouth of the Schoharie, was deeded in 1697 to Jan Peterse Mabee. He had an advantage because his wife Anna Borsboom, apparently of mixed race, was \\"something related to the Indian castle\\". The deed was signed by Sachem Rode of the Wolf Clan. In order to build the fort, there was a land swap, with the Mabee family receiving land further south on Schoharie Creek. Copies of the deed are held both in the Albany State Archives and at the shrine of Saint Kateri Tekakwitha in nearby Auriesville, New York.  Palatine settlement  Fort Hunter and Queen Anne's Chapel around 1711 The future site of Fort Hunter was on Schoharie Creek, near the easternmost of the two primary Mohawk settlements of the time. It was in part for defense of the nearby Mohawk village against the French and their Indian allies. The Mohawk name for their village was rendered variously in English as Tionondoroge\\"', Teantontalago, Thienderego, Tionondorage, and Tiononderoga. The European colonists also called it the Lower Mohawk Castle, referring to its relative position near the Mohawk River, which flows east. Canajoharie, the other primary Mohawk village, was known as the Upper Mohawk Castle and was located further west upriver, also on the south side of the river. By the Dongan Charter, the city of Albany acquired the right to own at the Lower Mohawk Castle. Hendrick Tejonihokarawa of the Wolf Clan, a Mohawk sachem also known by the English as Hendrick Peters, was one of the \\"Four Mohawk Kings\\" who went to London in 1710 to meet with Queen Anne. The chiefs asked her for Anglican missionaries to help offset French Catholic influence in the Iroquois Confederacy, as well as for defenses against French soldiers. In 1711, the Crown authorized the construction of Fort Hunter near Tionondorage for such defense. The fort contained a chapel and mission house. Queen Anne donated a set of communion silver and sent two missionaries to the colony. In return, she asked Tejonihokarawa for help in settling Palatine Germans, Protestant refugees then working at English camps in the Hudson Valley in present-day Dutchess County. They had left the Palatine because of French invasions related to religious wars. Through Governor Hunter, the sachem made some Mohawk land available to settlers near Schoharie Creek, where some of the Palatines eventually settled.Snow, Dean R. \\"Searching for Hendrick: Correction of a Historic Conflation\\" . New York History, Summer 2007  Fort Hunter  Fort Hunter was constructed by English colonists in 1712. In 1723 some 100 heads of German households were later granted land in what was known as the Burnetsfield Patent, west of the rapids at Little Falls, New York. They were a buffer between the French and Iroquois, and the English settlements. A log cabin was erected for use as a chapel, and at one time there were 30 houses for Mohawk within the fort. The log structure was replaced with a stone church in 1741 and a parsonage was later built outside the fort. It still stands. The fort was used by area residents for defense in the French and Indian War, and American Revolutionary War.  Erie Canal  Erie Canal aqueduct at Fort Hunter, NY In 1820 the fort and church were taken down to make way for construction of the Erie Canal, which dramatically increased trade and traffic through the valley.  Today  Today, the hamlet of Fort Hunter is the location of the Schoharie Crossing State Historic Site. It includes the remains of the Schoharie Crossing, a navigable aqueduct over the creek, and part of a lock from the early nineteenth-century development of the Erie Canal along the Mohawk River.

Together with the Polish Count Tadeusz Grabianka, also influenced by the Christian mysticism of Swedenborg he founded in 1760 the secret society of \\"Rite hermétique\\" or Illuminati of Avignon. Pernety was born at Roanne. He took part in the 1763–64 expedition under Louis Antoine de Bougainville that established the Port Saint Louis settlement in the Falkland Islands, and published a two-volume account of his nature exploration of the Falklands and the Brazilian island of Santa Catarina. In particular, he gave the first description of the Falklands stone runs phenomenon. In 1767 Pernety moved to Berlin. In 1779 he became a member of Illuminés of Avignon. In 1780 the oracle \\"la Sainte Parole\\" began to advise the Illuminés of Avignon to leave Berlin to establish elsewhere the foundations of a new Sion. In 1783 Pernety left Berlin at the command of the oracle. In October 1784 the oracle told the group that it should move to Avignon. In 1793 Illuminés of Avignon were suppressed by law. Pernety died in Avignon. In 1782 Pernety translated from Latin into French Emanuel Swedenborg's Heaven and Hell and in 1786 Swedenborg's Divine Love and Wisdom.

In 1920, Lazinski was arrested by Soviet authorities, the cathedral was closed down in 1934. During the Second World War, the Germans allowed the cathedral to function again, but after the war it was again closed down by the Soviets. In 1951, the cathedral's bell towers were intentionally destroyed by Soviet artillery and the building itself was given to the Spartak sports society.

It may also have been known as Steele County. History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created Heele County declared: > That the territory comprised within the following limits, be erected into a > county to be called Heele: commencing at the south east corner of Town Range > 4, North 69 West; thence north to the north east corner of Town 69 West > Range 10 North, thence west to the summit of the Rocky Mountains; thence > southwardly to the north west corner of Jackson county; thence east to the > place of beginning. Heele County encompassed much of what is today Larimer County, Colorado. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Larimer County, for the new Colorado Territory. Elections And Elected Officials If identified as Steele County, the first office holding official was Antoine Jeness, appointed by Governor Robert Williamson Steele in December 1859 as President Judge of Steele County. He was to hold office until the county's first popular election was held on January 2, 1860.

At its peak in the 1980s, Perry operated more than 200 drug stores, primarily in the state of Michigan, as well as 200 Auto Works auto parts stores and fourteen A. L. Price discount health and beauty aids outlets. In 1995, Perry Drug Stores was bought out by Rite Aid, a pharmacy chain based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania. The Perry chain, which at the time comprised 224 stores, was the largest acquisition ever made by Rite Aid. In addition, this acquisition brought the Rite Aid name to the Detroit area for the first time. History A former Perry Drugs location (previously Cunningham Drug) in Oscoda, Michigan. Since this picture was taken, the building has been re-tenanted by Goodwill Industries. Founder Jack A. Robinson opened his first Perry Drug Store in 1957 on Perry Street in Pontiac, Michigan. Over time, the chain expanded to become a prominent drugstore in the Detroit area, competing with local chains such as Arbor Drugs and Cunningham Drug. In 1978, a prototype Perry store was opened, featuring an expanded sporting goods line, a home and automotive center, and live pets for sale. Auto Works, an automotive parts retail chain, was introduced in 1982. Twenty-six Cunningham Drug locations were spun off by the chain's owner into a new chain called Apex Drug. By 1985, the Apex Drug locations and several other Cunningham locations were acquired by Perry, while the Cunningham locations in Florida remained in operation. In 1981, Perry Drug expanded into the Chicago, Illinois market for the first time. (The chain had previously tried to enter Chicago through a failed acquisition of DeKoven Drugs.) A year later, these stores were sold to businessmen Fred Barney and Bill Cartwright, two veteran businessmen who formed the Chicago operations into Perry Drug Chicago. Several units in Michigan were acquired in 1990 from Revco. This acquisition made Perry the dominant drugstore chain in the Detroit area and expanded Perry's presence to the Upper Peninsula for the first time. 1990s: Sale to Rite Aid Perry Drug Stores posted a brief period of sharp declines in sales in 1990, with locations in Indiana and Wisconsin being sold off. By 1993, the Perry Drug Chicago locations were re-acquired and liquidated. After its out- of-state operations were sold, Perry continued to expand its presence within Michigan. Many locations were remodeled to the chain's \\"store of the '90s\\" format; in addition, an online computer system called PerryLink was implemented at all stores, allowing for customers to have their prescriptions filled at any location. Rite Aid, a drugstore chain based in Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, acquired twenty-five locations from Hook's Drug Stores in 1994, subsequently selling nine of the locations to Perry. One year later, Rite Aid acquired all 224 of Perry Drug Stores' locations, including the former Hook's Drugs locations. The acquisition of Perry Drug Stores in 1995 was the largest acquisition made by Rite Aid. It also brought Rite Aid to the Detroit area, where it previously had no stores. Other operations In addition to the drugstore chain, Perry owned two other specialty chains: Auto Works and A.L. Price. Auto Works was an automotive store which comprised more than 200 locations at its peak. This chain was sold off in 1988 to Northern Automotive (now known as CSK Auto). A.L Price was a deep-discount health and beauty aids retailer with fourteen locations in the Detroit area. In 1990, Perry Drug Stores sold off all fourteen A. L. Price locations, as part of a decision to focus entirely on the drugstore chain itself; three years later, eleven of these stores were re-acquired by Perry.

The inn overlooks the Delaware River and is located at the corner of Radcliffe and Mill Streets in the Bristol Historic District. Background Clift built the Ferry House as part of his operation taking people across the Delaware River. The property was leased by Michael Hurst in 1684 and was subsequently opened as an inn by Thomas Brook in 1705. The inn was purchased by Charles Besonett in 1735 who subsequently rebuilt the inn larger following a fire on the property. The inn was renamed named the King George II Inn in 1765. As George Washington's army approached Bucks County in 1781, the image of George II was replaced with a likeness of General Washington. Shortly afterwards, the inn was renamed the Fountain House. During the 1800s, Bristol was a popular resort and spa, and the inn catered to the travelers. In 1892, the inn was renamed Ye Olde Delaware House, with the King George name restored about fifty years later. The restaurant closed in 2010, and opened again in 2015.

The church was born out of the Anglican church community among the Yoruba people in Western Nigeria. History Moses Orimolade Tunolase was born 1879 into the royal family of Ayibiri in Ondo State of Nigeria. Orimolade could neither stand nor walk until he was well over five years of age. In an effort to get Orimolade the help he needed, his parents had taken him to St. Stephen's Anglican Church, the only church in the Yoruba town of Ikare in Western Nigeria at the time. Orimolade was often left in the custody of the clergyman at this Church (Missionary Society) establishment of the Anglican Communion. One night the minister observed a strange light in the church and heard singing coming from inside. The minister discovered that the building was empty, except for Orimolade, who was about 5 years old at the time, sitting on the floor of the church in bright phosphorescence. At age 12 years, Orimolade had a dream in which he was presented with a rod, a Royal Insignia and a crown. He woke with a personal conversion to the Christian faith and a conviction of his calling to preach the gospel of Jesus Christ but his evangelistic mission did not begin until after a period of seven years in confinement. Some of his close associates at the time attributed this confinement to a protracted illness while others regarded it as a period spent in training and preparation for his missionary work. Orimolade emerged from this confinement with partial recovery of the use of his legs and a remarkable ability to pray and preach the King James Version of the Bible that had been translated into his own native Yoruba language earlier by his tribesman, Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther. Orimolade started his missionary work as an itinerant preacher in Ikare (his Yoruba town of birth) with no formal education. He openly confronted witches and wizards in Irun (another Yoruba town) and pulled down the image of Osijora, one of the idols worshipped in the village. He condemned the prevalent practice of human sacrifice in Benin City. He consecrated a pool in Kaba town and rid it of the evil spirit the villagers had worshipped. Orimolade converted many to the Christian faith. Traditional worshippers willingly gave up their charms and images for burning in response to his preaching and prayer. He directed his converts to the existing churches, irrespective of denominations, and where no church existed he helped establish one. Some of the churches established by Orimolade were actually established for the Church Missionary Society. Egbe Aladura The African people converted to the Christian faith by the members of the Church Missionary Society for the Anglican Church and were introduced to the Bible. Some of the Christianized western world views and European moral values contradicted and contravened the nature and culture of the African people. The manifestations of the gifts of the Holy Spirit among the African converts were misunderstood and mistaken by the missionaries for diabolical African voodoo. Polygamous marriages were dissolved resulting in the bastardization of the children from these African traditional marriages. The availability of the translations of the scriptures in African languages brought the Bible to life among the African people and changed their views of the missionaries and the missions. Drumming, clapping and dancing as methods of worship were embraced by the African people but created challenges for the missionaries and their European concept of worship. The difference in understanding of religious expression resulted in clashes and conflicts between the missionaries and the African leadership in the Anglican Church. The blind insistence of the missionaries on the superiority of the European concept of Christianity provided the moral impetus for the denial of the African leadership the right to succeed Bishop Samuel Ajayi Crowther and left the African people in the Anglican Church disconnected and discontent. In response the people started gathering into prayer groups called Egbe Aladura. The Aladuras promoted and popularized the power of prayer to heal. When the 1918 influenza pandemic spread to West Africa the people sought healing among the Aladuras. The healing and survival of so many Nigerians among the Aladuras during the Spanish flu spurred the growth and spread of these prayer groups in the early 1920s. Moses Orimolade arrived in Lagos on July 12, 1924 and lodged at Holy Trinity (Anglican) Church with the Sexton of the Church, Emmanuel Olumodeji from his hometown. He started preaching and praying for people all over Lagos in Nigeria. Many people in and around Holy Trinity sought after Orimolade for spiritual inquiry and counseling. He developed a reputation for seasoned preaching and fervent prayer and became known among the people as the \\"Baba Aladura\\" (Father that prays). The prosperity and popularity of Moses Orimolade was not welcomed among the Anglican leadership and led to his ejection from the premises of Holy Trinity on 11 September 1924. This aroused the sympathy and support of people in and around the Church. They followed Orimolade out of Holy Trinity and thereafter to his places of residence. Orimolade called this group of supporters and sympathizers the \\"Aladura Band\\" and continued his preaching and prayer with them. Separation from Anglicans On 18 June 1925 the Aladura Band was called to the rescue of an unconscious Methodist teenage girl, Abiodun Akinsowon, who had fallen into a trance when she tried to look into the chalice carried by the Catholic Archbishop on Corpus Christi public procession. Abiodun remained in the trance for 21 days in the care of the Aladura Band. She regained consciousness after 21 days and joined the Aladura Band. She became the first visioner in the band. The name of the band was changed to the Seraph Band on 9 September 1925 by Moses Orimolade. The addition of Cherubim to the name was advised by spiritual injunction on 26 March 1926 to reflect the heavenly representation of the Cherubim and Seraphim. The band was fully formed and functional by the end of 1925. Moses Orimolade reigned as the Sole Founder and Spiritual head of the band from 1925 to 1933. Schism Abiodun Akinsowon led the evangelistic tours of the band from Lagos westward. She was sent to establish most of the early branches of the band in the west of Nigeria. She earned the appellation \\"Captain Abiodun\\" in the band. She was adored by Moses Orimolade and admired by many members of the band. Abiodun Akinsowon rode with Moses Orimolade in the hammock chair to the envy of many men and women in the band. However, she was advised to step aside from the band in 1929 to form the Cherubim and Seraphim Society after she failed to convince Moses Orimolade to refuse the volunteer housekeeping services of a widow (Iya Ijesha) who had been healed in the band. The elders of the western Conference of the band declared independence and formed the Sacred Order of Cherubim and Seraphim following their futile effort to reunite Abiodun Akinsowon and Moses Orimolade. In 1930 a committee of elders was chosen to draft the Article of Association in preparation for the incorporation of the band. The first draft of the Article of Association was rejected by Moses Orimolade because of a clause that transferred the executive power and control of the band to the membership of the band. Upset, the authors pulled out of the band in 1930 to form the Praying Band of the Eternal Sacred Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim under the leadership of Ezekiel Davies. The northern Conference of the band continued on as the Holy Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim Movement. The Parent Body was registered and incorporated in 1930 as the Eternal Sacred Order of the Cherubim and Seraphim (ESOC&S;), with Moses Orimolade alias Baba Aladura as the Sole Founder and Spiritual Head \\"ALAGBA\\". Family Background He was from the idol worshipping background. His father was an herbalist and a popular Masquerade known all over the town. Moses Orimolade Tunolase was born in 1879. According to Elder George Olanrewaju Tunolase who is a cousin to Orimolade, when Orimolade was in the womb he would be talking to his mother and advising her on what to do. And the mother found it difficult to deliver him, while the beads of the then Owa -Ale of Ikare was demanded to be put on the mother’s neck for her to deliver safely, still, she didn’t deliver the child. However he was eventually delivered, and the very day he was born he started walking, this caused his father to use juju on him to avoid embarrassment. However, an epileptic woman who was being treated by the father of Moses fell on him when he had fit but that did not kill the newly baby boy as he grew up to be a very powerful preacher and miracle healer ‘’ While some said he was lame from birth but George denied that he was not,’’ he used to carry my father on his shoulder to the farm., so it is not true that he was lame’’.. Married Life During his lifetime, he neither married nor had children. Speaking to The Nation, Pa Tunolase [74] who is still living in the family house said ‘’my late father who was the elder brother to the late founder of Cherubim and Seraphim told me that Moses did not marry at all. He said Moses told his father that they could go and marry but for him he had chosen to be a Eunuch, as there are three types of Eunuch, the ones that the kings castrated and kept watching their Queens, the ones from heaven and those who became eunuch in order to serve God of which Moses chose’’. The Uncle continued ‘’my father told me that Orimolade said that his children would be like the sand of seashore. We were confused, but now the Aladura sect are numerous all over the world as they cannot be counted. Myth surrounding his miracles Many mysteries are woven round the Moses. He was said to have possessed a supernatural power that no one ever had. According to Most Superintendent Kunle Ayanfe, Moses was said to have been a special person with a supernatural power. He would get to where he and his group were going before anyone of them and they wondered how. Till he died nobody was able to unravel the mystery.’’ According to Ayanfe ‘’ some white men who heard about his good works came to approach him to come and heal their boss in overseas. Moses refused to go with them in the aircraft they brought and promised to meet them there. Before the white men got there, he had gone and come back. When the messengers got to their boss and saw him healed and bouncing, he told them he had been healed by a man whom he described with the features of Moses, the man they came to meet in Nigeria. He had the power as he used to pass through the rock and water while people wonder how he manage to perform such a feat. Tombs Before his death on October 19, 1933, he instructed his followers to exhume his body forty years after his death and bury him in his home town, Ikare, Akoko in Ondo state. Accompanied by the late Highlife musician I.K Dairo who was also popularly called Baba Aladura, and on October 19, 1975, his body was exhumed and taken to Ikare, Akoko. where he was buried. In fact, his body was said to be fresh and intact, not decayed while his clothes were as white as snow. Ojokoro empty Tomb At Ojokoro where the first Aladura church was established is a big mausoleum. A giant statue of the founder is erected there on top of an empty grave. In the grave are three candles which are usually lighted during service. The church faithfuls would dance round the mausoleum, sleep in the mausoleum where two graves of the senior leaders were buried. Not only this, the faithful also placed kegs of water and other things where they pray over them invoking the God of Moses Orimolade to heal, assist and answer their prayers. Asked if the spirit of Moses is still there, an elder in the church said ‘’ Moses Orimolade shed his blood here, his flesh dried here, so it is only the body that was removed to his home town Ikare Akoko in Ondo State. We His spirit is still here. While this reporter asked whether it is not a blasphemy, Matthew Akeusola denied it and said they need to appreciate and honour him. Ikare Tomb Here, at Mercyland known as Oke -Anu which is in Iku in Iyometa Area, of Ikare Akoko Ondo State where the exhumed body of Orimolade was eventually buried in 1975. Placed by the tomb are A Holy Bible, candles, crucifix and other things while at the entrance of the mausoleum are kegs of water and other things while people file out praying on the mountain. Special Room In the family house of the Orimolade Tunolases at Okorun also in Iyometa Area of Ikare is a special room where the late founder lived before he died. The room has been kept sacredand reserved as the faithfuls visit there for special prayers. The room is divided into two, while the inner one is where some paraphernalia of his office are kept. Ayanfe who led this reporter there at the initial stage fell into a trance and later came back alive, he said ‘’ this room is a powerful room and nobody is allowed to come in anyhow. It is sacred’’. Corroborating what Ayanfe said, the old man in the house, Pa Tunolase said he used to hear spiritual songs every night but he is not afraid for he knew it is the Angels from Heaven that are singing. His words ‘’ I used to hear spiritual songs coming out from the room in the midnight , and we don’t see anybody at all as we only hear voices. But it is crystal clear that the man Moses is a saint. Apostle Oladokun Aduragbemi the President General and the Spiritual Head of Eso, C&S;, Noah’s Ark in London said he came all the way from London to participate in the remembrance of the departed leader and said the room where Moses used in his father’s house is a sacred place where one’s prayer is accepted straight if one has faith. He gave an example ‘’ I came from London few days ago and I was called on the phone that one of my children was sick. I went straight to Papa’s room and prayed. Some hours later I was informed that he has been okay and doing well. Moses Well & Streams There is a well believed to be efficacious in healing all kinds of diseases. The well was said to have been blessed by the late founder who use it for healing all kinds of diseases. Women are not allowed to fetch it but only a male. Any female that fetches it will have her menstruation seized for ever and will not conceive. Examples are abound. According to Prophet Adeleke Adeyanju, Moses Orimolade, by power of The Sovereign Lord established two streams which still exist till today. 1\\\\. located in Ifako Ijaye, Lagos State. 2\\\\. located in Ijoko, Ogun State. Ifako Stream The Ifako stream was made when a man named Coker (a community leader) told Moses Orimolade that there was no water for the people in area to drink or wash. The area which is hilly experienced water shortages due to its geographical location. Orimolade walked through the valley and prayed then he stuck the earth with his staff and water gushed out from the ground. He also blessed the water. The water is used for spiritual deliverance up till today. The streets are named after Orimolade and Coker Ijoko Stream The Ijoko stream came to existence when a woman who is barren and had lost hope on ever having a child approached Moses Orimolade. The woman according to soothsayers and herbalists would only have a child if she's ever opportuned to visit Israel's Jordan River to take a bath as the only child she's destined to have has been kept there by evil forces. Moses Orimolade then walked down the Valley of Ijoko and prayed to God. He stuck his staff into the ground and commanded that the Jordan River in Israel establishes itself in the Ijoko area because of the woman. And it was so. The woman had the bath and bore a child. The river is still there till today and it is named after the Jordan River. Many have since then had their testimonies taking a bathe in the river after then. Palm Tree The palm tree is mysterious and medicinal. It was planted by the late founder, Orimolade. According to a prophetess,….’’the bark is highly medicinal. It cures all ailments. People come from all over the world to take from it. We don’t joke with it. Speaking further, a prophet and a prophetess said ‘’ the palm fronds on the palm trees are different from others and you cannot get it from anywhere in the world. Dr. Gabriel Olukayode said he was born in the Aladura sect and cannot leave it. For Popoola Babatunde Raphael, the growth within the Aladura can be compared with that of the Catholic, as it is growing everyday and no other sect can rival it. Defending why the growth is still spreading, Gorge Asogba said ’’ since Orimolade had refused to have children, God compensated him by multiplying the number of the Aladura faithful as they are called Children of Moses Orimolade. Asked why most of the faithful and their children wear dreadlocks, Asogba defended it by saying ‘’Moses Orimolade had dreadlocks and so it was passed to us all and it is for protection. Whoever has such in the family is a blessing to such family’’ When challenged that some Christians have the opinion that they are fetish since they are practising the Old Testament in the way of their worship by sacrificing, using coconuts, candles among other things, but Aduragbemi debunked the claim and said ‘’ they are just envious of the sect’’. Beliefs and practices The Order believes in the Holy Bible as the word of God and in salvation through Jesus Christ and in the Trinity in unity, the use of incense, purification by prayer and fasting and resurrection of the dead. Its first and primary work is that of prayer and preaching of the gospel. It believes in the curative effect of prayer for all afflictions, spiritual and temporal, but condemns and abhors the use of charms or fetish witchcraft or sorcery of any kind and all heathenish sacrifices and practices. It is not averse to the judicious use of curative herbs, the engagement of qualified medical practitioners or doctors or the use of patent medicines or other drugs. It endorses and practices the sanctification of water by prayer and the effect of such consecrated water for every purpose. The ESOC&S; is a Spiritual Christian Movement with membership in the Christian Association of Nigeria. Membership is open to people of all races, ages and to both sexes. Members are required to wear prayer robes at all times for worship. All members are priests and may be called upon at any time to perform religious rites appropriate for their age and sex. Ordination and promotion are based on performance and promotion of the activities of the holy order, attendance at religious ceremonies and availability for religious duties. Shoes are not allowed in the house of prayer. Female members and non-members must cover their heads and may not enter the worship area during their monthly periods. Tithes and offerings are used for bills, worship articles and welfare of the order. The Holy Order has no paid priesthood. The church currently has about 10 million members that worship in about 1500 branches all over the world including the United Kingdom and the United States.

North County was named for North Park and encompassed what is today Jackson County, Colorado. The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties for the new Colorado Territory.

It was a low point, released primarily to help pay off debt, and was the last of his efforts to make his music more radio- friendly. His subsequent work went in the much darker and more industrial direction that would revive his career. Numan's two previous studio albums, 1988's Metal Rhythm and 1991's Outland, had been released through IRS Records. However, Numan's relationship with that label had become strained, leading to his quitting IRS and reactivating his own label, Numa Records, on which he had released his work from 1984 until 1986. He continued to release albums on that label, before closing it down permanently after Sacrifice.  Overview  Musically, Machine + Soul continued the synth-rock/funk style of Metal Rhythm and Outland; in fact, the two Prince covers, \\"U Got the Look\\" and \\"1999\\" (the latter of which was relegated to B-side status), were recorded during the Outland sessions and at one point were set for inclusion on that album. Like Outland, Machine + Soul features movie vocal samples (for example, a line from Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory can be heard at the beginning of the album). However, Numan strove for a much more commercial sound with Machine + Soul, influenced by the work of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as well as by Prince. A decade after Machine + Soul's release, Numan had little difficulty describing his feelings for the album: Numan stated that reflecting on the album and its reception almost convinced him to retire from the music industry altogether. Numan later said that in 1993, \\"Nothing was right...That music, those clothes, that haircut. Imagine falling off a ship in the ocean, knowing if you stop swimming you're finished. That's what I was doing then. I was trying not to die.\\"interview in Uncut #130 (March 2008), p.21 Machine + Soul peaked at No. 42 on the UK album charts. Three singles were released from the album: \\"Emotion\\", which did not chart; \\"The Skin Game\\", which peaked at No. 68; and the title track, which peaked at No. 72. Over a year after the album's release, Numan embarked on the 14-date \\"Dream Corrosion Tour\\" of October–November 1993, from which the live album Dream Corrosion was released. Recorded at the Hammersmith Apollo, London on 6 November 1993, and released in August 1994, Dream Corrosion reached only #86 on the UK Album charts, however, it has been cited as the template with which Numan relaunched his career, preparing him for his return-to-form album Sacrifice in 1994. With Sacrifice, Numan dispensed with the dance rhythms and female backing vocals, in favour of a back-to-basics approach, more introspective lyrics, and a darker musical sound. Three songs from Machine + Soul (the title track, \\"Emotion\\" and \\"U Got the Look\\") were included on the 1996 remix album, Techno Army featuring Gary Numan. Machine + Soul was reissued in 1998 in the US and 1999 in the UK. The album's original sleeve was discarded for both releases. Both editions featured entirely new covers, utilizing photographs from Numan's Metal Rhythm era.  Track listing  All tracks are written by Gary Numan except where noted.

The constitution was the outcome of the Constitutional Conference chaired by Malcolm Shepherd, 2nd Baron Shepherd which lasted from 16 July to 24 July 1968. The Gibraltarian members of the Constitutional Conference were: Joshua Hassan, Aurelio Montegriffo and Abraham Serfaty for the Association for the Advancement of Civil Rights; Robert Peliza, Maurice Xiberras and legal advisor Sir Frederick Bennet for the Integration With Britain Party; and Peter Isola.The Gibraltar Constitution - 1969 Development The move towards the 1969 Constitution was sparked off after the outcome of the 1967 sovereignty referendum, where 99.19% of Gibraltarians voted against passing under Spanish sovereignty and in favour of retaining their link with Britain, with democratic local institutions and with Britain retaining its present responsibilities. Preamble The Gibraltar 1969 Constitution preamble engraved onto a stalactite at the Gibraltar Museum. The crucial feature of the 1969 Constitution for the Gibraltarians was the Preamble to the Order in Council promulgating the Constitution, in its final form began: This Preamble has been called the \\"single most significant statement made on the sovereignty of Gibraltar since the signing of the Treaty of Utrecht\\". Frontier closure Upon the request of the United Nations, Spain and the United Kingdom had been developing inconclusive talks about Gibraltar for the previous three years. Since 1954, the Government of Spain under the leadership of Francisco Franco had been applying increasingly restrictive measures in its relationships with Gibraltar. On 24 July 1968, it complained to the UN Secretary General claiming that the constitutional talks were a \\"further obstacle to the solution of Gibraltar's future\\", a statement that was rejected by the Government of the United Kingdom.\\". Shortly thereafter the frontier was closed by the Spanish Guardia Civil and chaos ensued as controls were implemented on travellers trying to use the ferry service at the port of Algeciras. This situation (which lasted into September 1968) was a precursor to the frontier closure implemented the following year. The Constitution was published on 30 May 1969 and came into immediate effect. Elections were scheduled for 30 July. The Spanish government described the promulgation as an open disregard by the UK government of the UN Resolutions and a violation of the Treaty of Utrecht. On 6 July 1969, the decision to close the land border between Spain and Gibraltar was taken. Next day the decision was implemented. The closing of the border, together with various other restrictions, was a severe shock for the Gibraltarians, who became aware that across the frontier there was a hostile and threatening foreign power. The closure of the frontier would last thirteen years and was considered by the Gibraltarians as the last in a series of sieges held by Spain to attempt to secure the surrender of the town.

Who had the majority of his success during the 1990s when he finished third at the inaugural Professional Darts Corporation's version of the World Championship in 1994 - after the majority of top players decided to separate from the British Darts Organisation. Career During that successful run in the 1994 PDC World Darts Championship Brown beat Kevin Spiolek, Keith Deller and Alan Warriner to reach the last four before losing heavily 0-5 to Phil Taylor. He then beat Peter Evison 5-1 in the third/fourth place play-off, a feature which is no longer staged in the event. Later in 1994, Brown also reached the semi-finals of the PDC Greene King U.K. Masters in Bury St. Edmunds. Having played league darts from the age of 13, Brown made his debut for the Surrey County 'B' Team (in the British Inter-Counties League) in September 1978. After three years struggling to hold down a team place, he joined the London County squad in 1981, and by 1983, had become established in the London 'A' Team. In 1989 Brown received the great honour of being appointed London Team Captain, following in the footsteps of such illustrious names as Eric Bristow, Cliff Lazarenko, and Clive Pearce. His first World-Ranked titles came in 1988 with wins at the Dutch Open and North American Open (which he retained the following year). Another particularly successful year was 1991, when he won the Swiss Open and Darts America, and also reached the final of the French Open, Malta Open and German Open. He was also a semi-finalist at the Belgium Open and a quarter-finalist in the Dutch Open. Despite this success, he never competed at the World Championship until the devastating split in the game. That was when the PDC (then known as the World Darts Council) field was boosted by a number of North American players who qualified for events alongside the 16 players who had left the BDO to form their own organisation. He competed at the PDC World Championship each year between 1994 and 2004, but was unable to repeat the form he showed at that first event in 1994 - only reaching the last 16 in 1999 and 2000. His best performance at the World Matchplay came in 2000 when he made it to the quarter-finals but lost heavily to Ronnie Baxter. Brown has also had success on the North American darts circuit reaching several World-Ranked finals including the 1998 Calgary Golden Harvest (losing to Rod Harrington), the 1999 Cleveland Darts Extravaganza (losing to Alan Warriner), the 2001 Blueberry Hill Open (losing to John Part), and the 2006 U.S.A. Darts Classic (losing to David Marienthal). He won the 2004 Windy City Open and was runner-up the following year, and most recently won the 2009 Houston Open. In fact, Brown is one of a very small handful of players to have won World-Ranked events in three different decades, and was also the first player to hold all three ADO National Championships simultaneously. He is also the only American male to be inducted into both the US National Darts Hall of Fame, and the Golden Harvest International Darts Hall of Fame. Brown lost out controversially on a place at the 2008 Lakeside World Championship. He made it to the semi-finals of the qualifiers in Bridlington - only to lose to Michael Rosenauer who then beat Swedish player Kenneth Hogwall to qualify for Lakeside. Rosenauer had also achieved qualification status for the PDC World Championship and elected to choose that championship instead - thus upsetting those players who he had knocked out of the qualifiers for the BDO version. After a somewhat disappointing 2008, Brown returned to form the following year. In addition to finishing the year as ADO #1, he claimed a spot on the US World Cup team for the 2009 WDF World Cup which was held in Charlotte, North Carolina, USA. This was Brown's third time on a US World Cup Team, following South Africa (1999) and Malaysia (2001). Brown also came close to qualifying for the 2010 BDO World Darts Championship by way of the BDO Invitational Table, and had he done so, would have been the first American ever to qualify for Lakeside via the rankings. He competed at the 2010 World Masters, where he lost to Scotland's John Henderson in the third round, and again reached the semi-finals of the BDO World Championship playoffs, losing to eventual qualifier Jan Dekker. Brown finished 2010 ranked as US #1 (for the fourth time) by the ADO. In 2012, Brown was forced to miss a number of major US tournaments, but still finished 11th in the ADO National Rankings. This means that, since Brown's first full year on the ADO circuit (1993), he has never been outside the Top 12 - a run of 20 consecutive years. Also in 2012, he won the Men's Singles at the Blueberry Hill Open for a record sixth time. Personal life Steve Brown lives in Loveland, Ohio, with his wife Missy. His favorite sports are speedway and football (soccer) - he supports AFC Wimbledon - and he also enjoys fishing, particularly catfishing. Other hobbies include cooking, classical music, and visiting cemeteries and graves of the famous. In addition to playing darts professionally, Brown is also involved in darts administration, currently serving as Communications Officer for the American Darts Organization. He had previously served five terms as Area 6 Manager. Steve's father, Ken was also a noted darts player during the 1970s, and was the first player ever to play in an official international match. In March 1974, Ken represented a Great Britain (BDO) team which played against the USA in New York. He was first on, beating Nicky Virachkul 2-1. Ken Brown's best tournament result came in reaching the last 16 of the Winmau World Masters in 1976. He also represented England six times (winning five) including a Man-of- the Match performance against Wales in 1978 (his last England appearance), and partnered Sandra Gibb to victory in the Mixed Doubles event in Yorkshire TV's Indoor League.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. It is open to visitors at advertised times. The church was in use until 1981. It remains consecrated and is used occasionally for services. History In the second half of the 18th century the parish church of Macclesfield, St Michael's was not big enough to cope with the needs of the growing population of the town. In 1772 David Simpson was appointed curate to the church but was deprived of his curacy because of his evangelical beliefs and preaching. Simpson had been invited to Macclesfield by Charles Roe, a local industrialist. Roe built Christ Church for David Simpson, who became its first vicar.Smith, Mark (2004) 'Simpson, David (1745-1799)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Retrieved on 27 November 2007 () The body of the church was built in seven months in 1775 and the church was opened on Christmas Day of that year. The tower was built the following year. Its height is which is out of proportion to the body of the church. It was built to this height to compete with the height of the tower of St Michael's Church. The church originally contained a large pulpit. David Simpson was a close friend of John Wesley, the founder of Methodism. Unusually for an Anglican church, Simpson invited Wesley to preach there on at least 12 occasions. Christ Church was vested in the Trust on 1 June 1985. A local group, The Roe-naissance Project, established in 2012 is working with The Churches Conservation Trust and Cheshire East Council to find a new appropriate and sustainable use for the building. Architecture Exterior The north elevation of the church The church is built in brick with stone facings in Georgian style. Its plan consists of a tower at the west end, a nave and a short chancel. The tower has west and north doors. Above the west door is a window with an elliptical head. The third stage contains elliptical windows, some of which are blind, and above these clock faces. The belfry windows are of two lights and louvred. The top has an embattled parapet above a cornice. The exterior of the nave and chancel are expressed as two storeys, with a cornice between. Above is a parapet over another cornice. At the east end is a Palladian window with round windows and doors on each side. In the middle of the north elevation is a door with a pediment above. This is surrounded with rusticated stone extending up to the parapet with another pediment at the top. The parapets of the tower and body of the church were originally surmounted by pinnacles but these are no longer present. Interior Inside the church a continuous gallery curves round the north, west and south sides, which is supported by columns of cast iron which are encased in wood. This is a very early use of cast iron in a church. The organ is in the west gallery. The ceiling is coved with plain plaster panelling. The church contains box pews and a small marble font. The stained glass in the east window is by William Wailes. There is glass in a window on the south side of the church by Morris & Co. On the south wall is a monument to Charles Roe in black and white marble dated 1784 by John Bacon. It is in low relief and carries a bust of Roe, with images of the church, Roe's silk mill and his copper works. Also on the south wall is a monument to David Simpson. The three-manual organ was made by Gray & Davison in 1875. There is a ring of ten bells which are still used regularly. Ten bells were cast in 1777 by Rudhall of Gloucester. In 1815, the two lightest bells were sold, and the 9th was recast by William Dobson of Downham. The tenor bell was recast by Taylors of Loughborough in 1902, and in 1947 they added two trebles to make a ring of ten again. Being a redundant church, there is no ringing for Sunday services, but there is a regular practice on Monday evening (usually 19:00 to 21:15), though it is advisable to enquire, particularly for Bank Holidays. The three-decker pulpit and choirstalls have been dismantled and put into storage. There are several items of carving from the \\"Macclesfield School of Carving\\" within the church. The most notable is a fine Edwardian reredos altar screen. This was dis-assembled during a restoration programme by over enthusiastic conservators to return the look of the Church to its Georgian original.

PBA career Hardwick joined the PBA Tour in 1961, and amassed a total of 18 PBA titles during his career. He was the first player to capture the PBA career \\"Triple Crown,\\" which is achieved by winning the three primary PBA major tournaments: U.S. Open, PBA National Championship, and Tournament of Champions. Hardwick captured all three between 1963 and 1969. There have been only six other Triple Crown winners since: Johnny Petraglia, Mike Aulby, Pete Weber, Norm Duke, Chris Barnes, Jason Belmonte. Hardwick was named PBA Player of the Year in both the 1963 and 1969 seasons. A 22-year old in 1963, Hardwick is still the youngest bowler to ever win PBA Player of the Year honors (through 2019). In 1969, he matched Dick Weber's 1961 PBA record by winning seven titles in one season.\\"PBA History\\" at www.pba.com The record would stand until 1978, when it was broken by Mark Roth's eight titles. Another record, which still stands even in this high scoring era, is the 2165 for an eight- game block achieved in Japan in 1968. Billy was ranked #12 on the PBA's 2008 list of \\"50 Greatest Players of the Last 50 Years\\". He retired relatively early from the PBA Tour after developing arthritis. Billy's final PBA title came in April, 1976 at the Monro-Matic Open in Toledo, Ohio when he was still just 34 years old. He was inducted into the PBA Hall of Fame in 1977, and was the proprietor of Billy Hardwick's All-Star Lanes in Memphis.U.S. Bowler, Spring 2009 issue, p. 7. Billy injured the third finger of his right hand in a machine shop accident while in high school. As a result, this finger would not bend, making it impossible to use a conventional bowling ball grip (thumb, third finger, and ring finger). Instead, he used his thumb and first two fingers. Billy was a Full Roller. A Full Roller rolls the ball over the full circumference of the ball, with the ball track going through the palm of the bowling ball at an angle between the gripping holes. Billy was unique in that he rolled a very straight ball with little side turn or hook. Billy also rolled the ball much slower than most other players. With his straighter, slower, Full Roller roll and his pinpoint accuracy (Billy rarely missed a spare and often converted the splits he was faced with), Billy was able to lay the ball tightly into the pocket again and again and consistently carry the strike. For this seemingly contradictory ability to roll straight and still carry strikes, he was nicknamed \\"The Magician\\" when he was competing on the 1965 \\"Championship Bowling\\" TV show. During the 1976 Firestone Tournament of Champions title match, where Billy faced a young Marshall Holman, analyst Nelson Burton Jr. remarked to Chris Schenkel on seeing Billy throw his second opening strike in a row with his slow straight shot, \\"How does he do it, Chris?! Everyone wonders how Hardwick does it.\\" After his third strike in a row, Nelson further commented, \\"It is almost unbelievable the control and accuracy of Hardwick. He does not depend on the power strikes like Marshall Holman, he depends on splicing a small target out there at the arrows. When Hardwick is right, he can hit a half-board, consistently, 20 foot down the lane, Chris. Put it right in the pocket. All three strikes he's got so far are perfect packed strikes.\\" After his career, while living in Florida, he was an important mentor to Glenn Hannigan, who he groomed to be \\"the best bowling writer in the county\\". Hannigan later became a leading writer and editor for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and authored many books on the Olympics. Hannigan credits Hardwick with making him comfortable asking the tough questions to elite athletes. According to his son, Chris, speaking on the Opie & Anthony Show on August 12, 2010, Hardwick was the last athlete to film a beer commercial profiling athletes. Chris added that his father originally had lines in the commercial but, \\"got a little intoxicated after so many takes that they cut out his lines for the commercial.\\" A decision was made after that commercial that it would make a bad impression on the youth to give the message that if you want to become a champion, you should drink.

History In July 1858, gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County, Kansas Territory. This discovery precipitated the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska, so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24, 1859. On November 28, the General Assembly of the Territory of Jefferson organized 12 counties: Arrappahoe County, Cheyenne County, El Paso County, Fountain County, Heele County, Jackson County, Jefferson County, Mountain County, North County, Park County, Saratoga County, and St. Vrain's County. The legislation that created Park County declared: > That the territory comprised within the limits of what is known as the South > Park, be erected into a county to be called Park county. Park County was named for South Park, and encompassed much of what is today Park County, Colorado. The settlements then existing in the county were the new mining camps of: Tarryall City, Jefferson, Hamilton, Montgomery, and Buckskin Joe (Laurette). The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction, but on February 28, 1861, U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado. On November 1, 1861, the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties, including Park County, for the new Colorado Territory.

The origin of the label's name is a reversal of the popular aphorism, \\"A quick nickel is better than a slow dime.\\" Within a short time, Amanda MacKaye became less involved and John Wall, who was playing in Kerosene 454 at the time, started running the label with Juan.

There were 35 Slowdime releases in all, on LP, CD, 12” single, and 7” single formats. The label’s final release was the album “Music Out of Music” by Bologna, Italy’s Three Second Kiss.

It is the 45th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. Plot The Stooges are guides (circa late 1800s), who are helping a trio christened \\"Nell's Belles\\" travel across the Rocky Mountains to San Francisco, the location of their next performance. While preparing some corned beef, a group of Native Americans and urges them to get off their land as soon as possible. Since Curly scared off the horses earlier, the group is stuck there for the night. During the night, Moe and Larry angrily tell Curly to sleep by himself because he is barking like a dog in his sleep. Unfortunately, snow falls while they sleep. They awake to discover a bear has devoured their food supply, so the three hapless guides try unsuccessfully to catch some fish in a nearby frozen lake. The fishing expedition is interrupted by Nell (Kathryn Sheldon), who discovers the Belles — Lorna Gray, Dorothy Appleby and Linda Winters — have been abducted by that same tribe. The Belles manage to escape, and the troupe leaves the Native American land quickly. Production notes Rockin' thru the Rockies was filmed on November 7–11, 1939.Rockin' Thru the Rockies at threestooges.net The film title is often mistaken for the 1945 feature film Rockin' in the Rockies starring the Stooges. After the snow collapses the tent-like structure from the set of \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin\\" (in which the troupe performs in a traveling show), Curly falls through a curtain, lands on the girls in bed, and says, \\"The walls of Jericho collapsed.\\" This is a reference to a scene in Columbia's It Happened One Night, where the flimsy barricade set up between Claudette Colbert and Clark Gable in a motor lodge was called the \\"walls of Jericho.\\" The name of the troupe, \\"Nell's Belles,\\" is a play on the old expression \\"Hell's Bells,\\" which of course would not have been permitted by the Production Code. In this short Curly also briefly chants, \\"Give 'em the axe, give 'em the axe; right in the neck, right in the neck\\" which is a reference both to the Stanford Axe as well as the chant traditionally shouted by Stanford during the Big Game, which was popular in southern California during the early part of the 20th century.

Halstead made the observation that metrics of the software should reflect the implementation or expression of algorithms in different languages, but be independent of their execution on a specific platform. These metrics are therefore computed statically from the code. Halstead's goal was to identify measurable properties of software, and the relations between them. This is similar to the identification of measurable properties of matter (like the volume, mass, and pressure of a gas) and the relationships between them (analogous to the gas equation). Thus his metrics are actually not just complexity metrics.

Furber was a member of the \\"English Society of Gardners\\", a group formed in 1724 to protect the reputations of plant growers by mutually agreeing to names for newly discovered plants. Furber contributed to the group's work, including collaborating on a book documenting the plants discovered and named by the group. He had a nursery in Kensington in London (near modern Hyde Park Gate/Gloucester Road) from around 1700 until his death. It was taken over by his colleague John Williamson, then others and survived until the 1840s. Henry Fletcher produced each of the twelve hand-colored engravings from paintings by Pieter Casteels). Furber's most notable work was Twelve Months of Flowers, published in 1730. The book was written as a catalog of plants and seeds, and featured twelve detailed engravings of seasonal plants in bloom. Henry Fletcher produced each of the twelve hand-colored engravings from paintings by Pieter Casteels. Each plant was numbered, with a list of the corresponding species names provided. More than 400 different species of plant were featured. The plates were originally sold on a subscription basis for £1 5s in uncolored form, or £2 12s 6d for a colored version. The book was reprinted in 1982. In 1732, Furber produced a follow-up work entitled Twelve Months of Fruit. Like his previous collection of flowers, Twelve Months of Fruit featured twelve full-color plates with 364 different fruit. Each plate focused on one month, and showed the varieties of fruit that would ripen during that month. Other works by Furber include a 1732 book entitled The Flower Garden Displayed, a general-purpose book written for a wider audience. He also had a position as an overseer of the poor in Kensington (St Mary Abbots parish, 1718) and was a churchwarden between 1725–6 and 1736–7. Personal life He married Mary Everton in about 1706 and they had one son, William. He was buried at St Mary Abbots on 1 September 1756.

Biography Alberto Posadas was born in 1967 in Valladolid where he underwent his first musical education which he then continued in Madrid at the Madrid Royal Conservatory. In 1988 he met Francisco Guerrero Marín with whom he studied composition and whom he considered his real master. This meeting represented an important turning point in his career. Together with Guerrero he discovered new techniques for musical form creation such as mathematical combinatorics and the fractals. Nonetheless, his determination and constant search for the integration of aesthetics in these procedures led him to employ another “model” of composing such as the translation of architectural spaces into music, the application of topology and painting techniques related to perspective or the exploration of the acoustic features of instruments at a micro level. He explored the possibilities of electro-acoustic music developing, in a self-taught way, through various projects starting with Liturgia de silencio (1995) and continuing with more recent pieces like Snefru or Versa est in luctum (2002). His interest in investigating the application of movement to the electronic transformation of sound determined him in 2006 to become involved in a multi-disciplinary project promoted by IRCAM Paris whose premiere is scheduled for 2009. In 2006 Alberto Posadas received a grant from the Casa Velázquez, Madrid, to develop, together with Andrés Gomis, a research project about the new interpretation techniques for bass saxophone and their application to composition. Posadas’ compositional work is almost entirely dedicated to the instrumental genre in all its varieties: solo, duo, quartet, ensemble, orchestra, etc. 1993 represented the beginning of his career as a composer abroad. Since then, his works have been played in Austria, Germany, the USA, Switzerland, Portugal, France, Canada, Belgium, etc. It was actually abroad, in Belgium, that he received his first award – the Audience Prize for his string quartet A silentii sonitu in the Ars Musica Festival, Brussels, 2002. Part of his work has been commissioned by festivals such as Agora (Paris), Donaueschinger Musiktage (Donaueschingen), Musica Festival (Strasbourg) or Ars Musica (Brussels) as well as for Ensemble Intercontemporain, having been selected for the “Reading panel 2003/2004”. Alternatively, he received personal commissions directly from musicians, these pieces amounting to a substantial part of his solo and small ensemble work. Works for Esteban Algora, Andrés Gomis, Alexis Descharmes or Oiasso Novis among others, confirm this joint work between composer and musician. Posadas’ music has been featured at the Wiener Musikverein of Vienna, the Encontros Gulbenkian of Lisbon as well as at the aforementioned festivals. His works have been performed by internationally acclaimed ensembles and orchestras such as Ensemble Intercontemporain, Ensembe L’itineraire, Ensemble Court-Circui't, Nouvel Ensemble Moderne, Arditti String Quartet, Orchestre National de France, Orchestre Philharmonique du Luxembourg, etc. and conducted by the prestigious conductors Arturo Tamayo, Pascal Rophé, Beat Furrer, to name but a few. He is currently working on various parallel commissions: a work for ensemble with live electronics, dance and video for IRCAM Paris (world première in AGORA 2009); a cycle of string quartets for MUSICA Festival Strasbourg in co- production with Casa da Musica of Porto and CDMC Spain (world première in 2008) and a concerto for saxophone and orchestra for the Orquesta de la Comunidad de Madrid, commissioned by Fundación Autor Spain (world première 2008/2009). Since 1999 his works have been published by the French publishing house Editions musicales européenes, on whose web site (www.emepublish.com ) his works catalogue and discography are on display. Since 1991 he has worked as a teacher of analysis, harmony and composition and is often invited as a guest lecturer to courses on contemporary music in Montreal University, Aula de Música of Alcalá University (Madrid), Fundación Universidad de verano de Castilla y León, E. T. S. de Ingenieros of Autónoma University, Madrid, International Contemporary Music Festival of Alicante, Quincena Musical of San Sebastián, “Encontres” International Festival of Balearic Islands, etc. He currently works as a professor in the Music Conservatory of Majadahonda, Madrid. In October 2011, he received the composition award in the Spain's annual Premio Nacional de Música. Aesthetics Three compositional ideas, initially independent but often intertwined, are developed throughout Alberto Posadas’ work. The first one is based on the use of mathematical and physical procedures, starting with systems of combinatorial mathematics and evolving towards the application of ”fractal theory”. This fusion between mathematics and music comes from a desire to put into music the systems that regulate nature. This approach has been applied to works like Apeiron for orchestra, A silentii sonitu for string quartet and Invarianza for ensemble. A second idea delves into the acoustic possibilities of each instrument at a microscopic level, in order to produce both the musical material of a piece and its regulation. Pieces like Eridsein for flute, Sínolon for clarinet and Anábasis for tenor saxophone have been composed from this standpoint. Finally, a third idea tries to establish a relationship between music and other arts such as architecture. The space–time association is intended while applying the inherent dimensions and proportions of an architectural piece to the different parameters of music. The Egyptian pyramids have been the models used so far for this purpose and this is reflected in pieces like Snefru for accordion and electronics or Nebmaat for saxophone, clarinet and string trio. With regard to painting, its relationship with music is examined in one of its perspective techniques – the anamorphosis – as a procedure to topologically transform music. This is the approach used in the eponymous ensemble piece Anamorfosis.

It was located within the Diocese of Manchester and sponsored by the Legionaries of Christ, a religious congregation of the Roman Catholic Church. The school buildings still stand overlooking Lake Winnipesaukee in the central New Hampshire town of Center Harbor. It served approximately 130 students at its heyday. It closed permanently in June 2015. Background The school was formerly a minor seminary and novitiate of the Missionaries of La Salette. The property was purchased by the Legionaries of Christ in 1982, and since that time until its closing in 2015, the school expanded and continued in its purpose to provide a healthy environment for teenage boys. While some students continued on to a seminary after graduation, many pursued college or university degrees. Students came from throughout the United States and from several countries around the world including Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, South Korea, and South Africa. Mission The school's main focus was to bring the young men attending it to grow in a deep relationship with Jesus Christ and also strove to help young men to discern God's plan in their life, with a special emphasis on the Catholic priesthood within the congregation of the Legionaries of Christ. Academics The academic program followed a classical liberal arts model with particular attention to classical (Latin and Greek) and modern foreign languages, British and American literature, mathematics and the natural sciences, history, theology, cultural studies, and the fine arts (vocal music, theater arts/communication, and mass media and video production). The Latin and Greek courses, in particular, encouraged all students to be able to read Virgil's Aeneid in the original Latin and be able to translate the Gospel of John from the original Greek by senior year. The mathematics program begins with pre- algebra and extends to Trigonometry and Calculus with emphasis in theory rather than application. Students were required to take Spanish as a modern foreign language. Each student was also required to participate in the school’s band and choir program. Students also participated in service to the community in order to graduate. Spirituality Religious services such as the Holy Mass, Rosary, and Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament were provided regularly for the students. Students were introduced to Catholic spirituality which takes different elements from various spiritual authors. Athletics Athletic activities were numerous and included basketball, soccer, hockey and baseball. Outdoor and recreational activities were also provided such as hiking expeditions in the White Mountains and seasonal opportunities for swimming, boating, skiing, and sledding.

In a career which lasted from August 1973 until July 1975 he ran nine times and won five races. He was the best British three-year-old of 1974, when his wins included the Classic St Leger, as well as the Sandown Classic Trial, Lingfield Derby Trial and Great Voltigeur Stakes. As four-year-old he won the Coronation Cup in record time and finished second to Grundy in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in what was described as the Race of the Century. Background Bustino was a bay horse bred by Edgar Cooper Bland. He was sired by 1967 British Horse of the Year, Busted, out of the mare Ship Yard. As a descendant of the mare Rose Red, Bustino was related to the British Classic winners Larkspur, Alycidon and My Babu as well as the Belmont Stakes winner Celtic Ash. As a yearling he was sent to the sales at Newmarket where he was bought for 21,000 guineas by Lady Beaverbrook. Lady Beaverbrook was considered an eccentric character who gave most of her horses names consisting of one word with seven letters (Bustino, Terimon, Boldboy, Niniski, Mystiko, Petoski), as this was the most common form for Derby winners. Bustino was sent into training with Dick Hern at West Ilsley in Berkshire. Racing career 1973: two-year-old season Like many of Hern's best horses, Bustino was not highly tried at two. He made his only appearance in the Acomb Stakes at York in August and finished third. 1974: three-year-old season As a three-year-old in 1974, the colt began by winning the Sandown Classic Trial from the future Epsom Derby winner Snow Knight, who was carrying five pounds more in weight. In the Lingfield Derby Trial he again defeated Snow Knight, this time at level weights. At Epsom, he seemed to be unsuited by the firm ground and finished fourth in the Derby, behind Snow Knight, Imperial Prince and Giacometti. Bustino was then sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse, in which he finished second of the eighteen runners, beaten two lengths by Sagaro. Back in England, he won the Great Voltigeur Stakes in August, beating Irish Derby winner English Prince. At Donacaster in September, Bustino started the 11/10 favourite for the St. Leger Stakes. He was assisted by his stable companion Riboson, who set a strong pace, before Bustino took the lead in the straight and won by three lengths from Giacometti. 1975: four-year-old season Sent back to the track in 1975 at age four, Bustino won the Group One Coronation Cup at Epsom Downs Racecourse then was an integral part of what the British racing world and major newspapers dubbed the \\"Race of the Century.\\" =Britain's \\"Race of the Century\\"= Bustino was up against a very solid field in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes that was open to older horses. The participants included Eclipse Stakes winner, Star Appeal, Nelson Bunker Hunt's mare, Dahlia, one of the greatest female horses in world Thoroughbred racing history, and the three-year-old Grundy, a winner of both the Epsom and Irish Derbys. Trainer Dick Hern knew Bustino had the stamina for the 2,414 metre race (1½ miles) and started two of Bustino's stablemates to set a blistering early pace designed to wear down Grundy. With half a mile left to run, Bustino and jockey Joe Mercer moved into the lead. He was ahead by four lengths by the time they entered the top of the straight when Pat Eddery on Grundy mounted a charge. The two horses began pulling away from the rest of the field and with a furlong left to run, Grundy passed Bustino, who soon retook the lead. Fifty yards from the finish line, Grundy fought back and recaptured the lead, holding off Bustino's continued furious effort to win by half a length with Dahlia another five lengths behind in third. The winning time of 2:26.98 beat the race record by almost two and a half seconds, a record that lasted for 35 years. As sometimes happens, a race of this nature took a toll on both horses. Grundy ran only once more without success, and Bustino never raced again. In The Observer newspaper's list of the \\"10 greatest horse races of all time,\\" the match between Bustino and Grundy in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 26 July 1975, was ranked number two: number one was the race between Quashed and Omaha for the 1936 Ascot Gold Cup. Bustino was being prepared for the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe when he sustained an injury to his foreleg which ended his racing career. He was retired to stud with a valuation of £600,000. Assessment Bustino was awarded a rating of 136 by Timeform. A rating of 130 is considered the mark of an above average Group One winner. In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Bustino the eighty-seventh best racehorse of the 20th century and the thirty-eighth best British horse. Stud career Retired to stud duty, Bustino proved a very successful sire. His offspring include: * Easter Sun (b. 1977), won 1982 Group 1 Coronation Cup * Height of Fashion (b. 1979), as a two-year-old won the Acomb Stakes, May Hill Stakes and Fillies' Mile and as a three year old the Lupe Stakes and Princess of Wales's Stakes, beating Ardross.

The area was given its name soon after Ed Less discovered the Nonesuch vein of copper on the Little Iron River in 1865.\\"Nonesuch.\\" October 17, 2007. Copper Country Vertical File: Copper and Mining - Companies - Nonesuch Mining Company (2004). MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical collections, Michigan Technological University, Michigan. The name refers to the occurrence of the copper in sandstone: \\"nonesuch\\" ore existed elsewhere in the Copper Country.\\"Old Nonesuch Lode in the Porcupine Mountains was Once Heralded as One of the Richest Copper Beds Ever Found.\\" October 17, 2007. Copper Country Vertical File: Copper and Mining - Companies - Nonesuch Mining Company (1955). MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical collections, Michigan Technological University, Michigan. The life of Nonesuch was relatively short. It saw its first mining in 1867 and its last in 1912.Rafferty, M. & Sprague, R: Porcupine Mountains Companion: Inside Michigan's Largest State Park. Pages 194-204. Nequaket Natural History Associates, 2001. The mine was opened and closed five different times, each under different ownership. The only time it made a profit was in the period 1879-1881.Horace J. Stevens, (1902) The Copper Handbook, v.2, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.212. A US post office operated at Nonesuch from 1876 to 1887. Between 1881 and 1884 the town reached its peak with a population of about 300. The town included school with 30 students, as well as a boarding house, livery stable, markets, stage coach service, and a uniformed baseball team.\\"Nonesuch.\\" October 17, 2007. Copper Country Vertical File: Copper and Mining - Companies - Nonesuch Mining Company (2004). MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical collections, Michigan Technological University, Michigan. The copper at the mine was found in a bed of sandstone, and the underlying shale, also a few feet thick.Roland Duer Irving (1883) The copper-bearing rocks of Lake Superior, US Geological Survey, Monograph 5, p.221. These shales and sandstones were given the name Nonesuch shales and sandstones because they were rocks with very fine copper in them.Stevens, H.J: The Copper Handbook. Page 186. Houghton: Horace J. Stevens. This unusual (for the Copper Country) form of copper was ultimately the reason for the mine's repeated failures. It was very difficult to separate the fine copper from the surrounding rock. As was common practice in the Copper Country, the ore was crushed in a stamp mill and concentrated by gravity. However, the gravity separators of the time could not efficiently separate the fine copper particles, and much copper was lost in the waste tailings. By February 1887, the Nonesuch mine was completely stripped of its machinery, which was brought to the dock in Union Bay to be shipped to other mines in the area.\\"Nonesuch.\\" October 17, 2007. Copper Country Vertical File: Copper and Mining - Companies - Nonesuch Mining Company (2004). MTU Archives and Copper Country Historical collections, Michigan Technological University, Michigan. A few stayed in town after the mine shut down and logged or farmed to make a living. In 1906 The Calumet and Hecla Mining Company brought 200 tons of mining equipment to Nonesuch and explored the area. They eventually opened a mine in the Nonesuch shale at White Pine, three miles due east of Nonesuch. Four years later in 1912, a 20-person crew was sent to Nonesuch to start mining, but shut down in less than a year. The mine never again reopened.Rafferty, M. & Sprague, R: Porcupine Mountains Companion: Inside Michigan's Largest State Park. Pages 194-204. Nequaket Natural History Associates, 2001. Copper expert Horace Stevens commented in 1902: :\\"Discovered in 1865 the mine was first opened in 1867, since which time it has swallowed several large fortunes, and has yielded the insignificant amount of 180 tons 1,072 pounds of refined copper from one of the richest beds of copper-bearing rock ever opened.\\" :\\"The copper is there-millions and millions of pounds of it, not worth a penny a ton in the mine. Some day the problem will be solved, and a new crop of millionaires made from the Nonesuch.\\"Horace J. Stevens, (1902) The Copper Handbook, v.2, Houghton, Mich.: Horace Stevens, p.211-213. Total recorded production of the mine was 390 thousand pounds of copper.B. S. Butler and W. S. Burbank (1929) The copper deposits of Michigan, US Geological Survey, Professional Paper 144, p.91. In 1955, the Copper Range Company opened the White Pine mine, solved the problems of mining and treating the ore, and successfully mined copper from the Nonesuch Shale for the next 40 years.

The language is also spoken by minority populations of the neighbouring states of Jharkhand, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. The region has been known at different stages of history as Kalinga, Udra, Utkala or Hirakhanda. Odisha was a vast empire in ancient and medieval times, extending from the Ganges in the north to the Godavari in the south. During British rule, however, Odisha lost its political identity and formed parts of the Bengal and Madras Presidencies. The present state of Odisha was formed in 1936. The modern Odia language is formed mostly from Pali words with significant Sanskrit influence. About 28% of modern Odia words have Adivasi origins, and about 2% have Hindustani (Hindi/Urdu), Persian, or Arabic origins. The earliest written texts in the language are about thousand years old. The first Odia newspaper was Utkala Deepika first published on 4 August 1866. Odia is the only Indo-European language of India other than Sanskrit and the sixth Indian language that has been conferred classical language status and forms the basis of Odissi dance and Odissi music. Historians have divided the history of the Odia language literature into five main stages: Old Odia (800 AD to 1300 AD), Early Medieval Odia (1300 AD to 1500 AD), Medieval Odia (1500 AD to 1700 AD), Late Medieval Odia (1700 AD to 1850 AD) and Modern Odia (1870 AD to present). Further subdivisions, as seen below, can more accurately chart the language's development.  First literature of Odisha (4th century BC) The ancientness of the Odia literature is being proved from its soil which says about two types of literature from very beginning. The creativity, development and preservation of Odia language and literature through ages can be seen in its spoken (in the form of folk lores) and written forms (e.g. rock edicts, manuscripts). The songs sung after birth, death, while working, and during festivals have helped to preserve the language in the first way (i.e. spoken form) by getting transferred through generations, while, the stories painted in cave paintings have constituted preservation in the second way (i.e. written form). The inhabitants of this land started to drown this language about 15,000 years ago. The Gudahandi painting of Kalahandi district and the cave art of Khandagiri and Udayagiri are the great achievements of this primitive architecture. Kharavela's Hatigumpha inscription serves as evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual, and social status and is the 1st poetic stake inscription. Though Ashoka had created many rock edicts and inscriptions before Kharavela, yet his instructions for administration have been written in a rude and chocked language. On the other hand, the Hatigumpha inscription shows the flexibility of the language in a sweet flow. Main feature of this inscription was based on principles of Sanskrit poetic structure: such as- It means that such creations will be called as poem which Protagonist would be Dhirodatta belonging to an untouchable kshtriya. In Rasa (aesthetics) Srunagâra (Love, Attractiveness), Vîra (Heroic mood), Sânta (Peace or tranquility) among them one would be the main rasa and others are remain with them as usual. All aspects of drama, historic tales and other legendary folklores are present. The description of all the fourfold-Dharma, Artha, Kama and Mokshya are still present here, but one should be given priority than other theme. At the beginning it should be written as respective, blissful and subject aware with welfare of people being hatred towards evil and devotional towards sages/saints. When Hatigumpha Inscription was created by Kharavela, all these principles were traced by him before, which has been followed by Rudradaman (Girinar inscription 150 AD), Samudragupta (Prayaga inscription 365 AD), Kumargupta (Mandasore inscription 473 AD), created their own famous creativities in a decent poetic style on many rocks in the Sanskrit language. The trend of writing was not obstructed after Kharavela. From Asanapata inscription in Keonjhar created by Satru Bhanja, (a warrior of Odisha) were engraved in the temple, Laxminarayana of Simhanchalam by Mukunda Deva are such examples. In the beginning, these inscriptions had a dynamic journey from Pali to Sanskrit. They have not lost the sense of Odia. Therefore, Odia language, literature, script and culture are based on the discussions on these inscriptions. The words written in the Hatigumpha Inscription are still used in the present day Odia language. Age of Charya literature (7th to 8th centuries AD) The beginnings of Odia poetry coincide with the development of Charyapada or Caryagiti, a literature started by Vajrayana Buddhist poets.Mukherjee, Prabhat. The History of medieval Vaishnavism in Odisha. Chapter: The Sidhacharyas in Odisha Page 55. This literature was written with a certain metaphor called \\"Sandhya Bhasha\\", and some of its poets like Luipa and Kanhupa came from the same territory as present day Odisha. The language of Charya was considered to be Prakrit. In one of his poem, Kanhupa wrote: In this poem shakti is replaced by the image of the \\"untouchable maid\\". The description of its location outside the city corresponds to being outside the ordinary consciousness. Although she is untouchable the bald Brahmin, or in other words so-called wise man, has a secret hankering for her. But only a kapali or an extreme tantric can be a fit companion for her, because he is also an outcast. The kapali is naked because he does not have any social identity or artifice. After the union with the shakti, the shakti and the kapali will climb on the 64-petalled lotus Sahasrara chakra and dance there. This poet used images and symbols from the existing social milieu or collective psychology so that the idea of a deep realization could be easily grasped by the readers. This kind of poetry, full of the mystery of tantra, spread throughout the northeastern part of India from the 10th to the 14th centuries, and its style of expression was revived by the Odia poets of the 16th to the 19th centuries.  Pre-Sarala Age (12th to 14th centuries AD)  In the pre-Sarala period, Natha and Siddha literature flourished in Odisha. The main works of this period are Shishu veda (an anthology of 24 dohas), Amara Kosha and Gorakha Samhita. Shishu veda is mentioned in the works of Sarala Das and the later 16th century poets. It is written in Dandi brutta. Raja Balabhadra Bhanja wrote the love story, Bhagabati known for its emotional content.http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2014/mar/engpdf/26-29.pdf The other important works of this period are the Kalasha Chautisha (By Baccha Das), Somanatha bratakatha, Nagala chauthi, Tapoi and Saptanga. Rudrasudhanidhi is considered the first work of prose in Odia literature written by Abhadutta Narayan Swami. Markanda Das composed the first Koili (an ode to cuckoo) in Odia just before the beginning of the age of Sarala Das. His composition Kesava Koili describes the pain of separation of Yasoda from her son Krishna. He is also known to compose the epic Daasagriba badha, Jnaanodaya koili. Age of Sarala Dasa In the 15th century, Sanskrit was the lingua franca for literature in Odisha and Odia was often considered the language of the commoners and Dalits(Untouchables), who had no access to Sanskrit education. The first great poet of Odisha with widespread readership is the famous Sarala Das, who translated the Mahabharata into Odia. This was not an exact translation from the Sanskrit original, but rather an imitation; for all practical purposes it can be seen as an original piece of work. Sarala Das was given the title Shudramuni, or seer from a backward class. He had no formal education and did not know Sanskrit. This translation has since provided subsequent poets with the necessary foundation for a national literature, providing a fairly accurate idea of the Odia culture at the time. Sarala Dasa, born in the 15th century Odisha of the Gajapati emperor Kapilendra Deva, was acclaimed as the \\"Adikabi\\" or first poet. The reign of the Gajapatis is considered as the golden period for Odisha's art and literature. Kapilendra Deva patronized Odia language and literature along with Sanskrit unlike his predecessors who used only Sanskrit as their lingua franca. In fact a short Odia poem Kebana Munikumara is found in the Sanskrit Drama Parashurama Vijaya ascribed to none other than the emperor Kapilendra Deva himself.http://oaob.nitrkl.ac.in/58/1/Prachina_Odia_Kabita.pdf It is believed that Sarala Dasa's poetic gift came from the goddess Sarala (Saraswati), and that Sarala Das wrote the Mahabharata while she dictated it. Though he wrote many poems and epics, he is best remembered for the Mahabharata. His other most known works are Chandi Purana and the Vilanka Ramayana. He also composed the Lakshmi-Narayana Bachanika. Arjuna Dasa, a contemporary of Sarala-Das, wrote Rama-Bibha, which is a significant long poem in Odia. He is also the author of another kavya called Kalpalata.  Age of the Panchasakhas  Five Odia poets emerged during the late 15th and early 16th centuries: Balarama Dasa, Atibadi Jagannath Das, Achyutananda Das, Ananta Dasa, and Jasobanta Dasa. Although they wrote over a span of one hundred years they are collectively known as the \\"Panchasakhas\\", since they adhered to the same school of thought, Utkaliya Vaishnavism. The word \\"pancha\\" means five and the word \\"sakha\\", friend. The Panchasakhas were Vaishnavas by thought. In 1509, Shri Chaitanya came to Odisha with his Vaishnava message of love. Before him, Jaydev had prepared the ground for Vaishnavism through his Gita Govinda. Chaitanya's path of devotion was known as Raganuga Bhakti Marga. He introduced chanting as a way to make spiritual connection & taught the importance of Hare krushna mantra. Unlike Chaitanya, the Panchasakhas believed in Gyana Mishra Bhakti Marga, similar to the Buddhist philosophy of Charya literature stated above. The Panchasakhas were significant not only because of their poetry but also for their spiritual legacy. In the holy land of Kalinga (Odisha) several saints, mystics, and devotional souls have been born throughout history, fortifying its culture and spiritualism. The area uniquely includes temples of Shakti, Shiva and Jagannâtha Vishnu. Several rituals and traditions have been extensively practised here by various seers – including Buddhist ceremonies, Devi \\"Tantra\\" (tantric rituals for Shakti), Shaiva Marg and Vaishnava Marg. There is hardly any \\"Sadhak\\" who did not pay a visit to the Shri Jagannath temple. There is an interesting description of the origin of the Panchasakhas, in Achyutananda's Shunya Samhita. As per his narration, towards the end of Mahabharat when Lord Krishna was leaving his mortal body, Nilakantheswara Mahadeva appeared & revealed to him that the Lord's companions Dama, Sudama, Srivatsa, Subala, and Subahu would reincarnate in the Kali Yuga & be known as Ananta, Acyutananda, Jagannatha, Balarama and Yasovanta, respectively. Thus, believers in the Panchasakha consider them the most intimate friends of Lord Krishna in Dvapara Yuga, who came again in Kali Yuga to serve him. They are also instrumental in performing the crucial & much-awaited Yuga-Karma, where they destroy the sinners and save the saints, according to Sanatana-Hindu beliefs. Balaram Das's JAgamohan Ramayan provided one pillar, along with Sarala-Das's Mahabharata, upon which subsequent Odia literature was built. His Lakshmi Purana is considered the first manifesto of women's liberation or feminism in Indian literature. His other major works are Gita Abakasa, Bhava samudra, Gupta Gita, Vedanta Sara, Mriguni Stuti, Saptanga yogasara tika, Vedanta sara or Brahma tika, Baula gai gita, Kamala lochana chotisa, Kanta koili, Bedha parikrama, Brahma gita, Brahmanda bhugola, Vajra kavacha, Jnana chudamani, Virata gita, Ganesha vibhuti & Amarakosha Gita.http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/2014/July/engpdf/69-73.pdf The most influential work of this period was however Atibadi Jagannath Das's Bhagabata, which had a great influence on the Odia people as a day-to-day philosophical guide, as well as a lasting one in Odia culture. His other works include Gupta Bhagavat, Tula vina, Sola chapadi, Chari chapadi, Tola bena, Daru brahma gita, Diksa samyad, Artha koili, Muguni stuti, Annamaya kundali, Goloka sarodhara, Bhakti chandrika, Kali malika, Indra malika, Niladri vilasa, Nitya gupta chintamani, Sri Krishna bhakti kalpa lata. Shishu Ananta Das was born in Balipatana near Bhubaneswar in the late 15th century. He wrote Bhakti mukti daya gita, Sisu Deva gita, Artha tarani, Udebhakara, Tirabhakana, a Malika and several bhajan poetries. Yashobanta Das was the composer of Govinda Chandra (a ballad or Gatha- Sangeeta), Premabhakti, Brahma Gita, Shiva Swarodaya, Sasti mala, Brahma gita, Atma pariche gita, a Malika and several bhajans. Mahapurusha Achyutananda is considered the most prolific writer of the Panchasakhas. He is believed to be born through special divine intervention from Lord Jagannath. The name Achyuta literally means \\"created from Lord Vishnu\\". He is also referred to as \\"Achyuti\\", i.e. \\"He who has no fall\\" in Odia. He was born to Dinabandhu Khuntia & Padma Devi in Tilakona, Nemal around 1485 AD. He established spiritual energetic centers called \\"gadis\\" all over east India (in the former states of Anga, Banga, Kalinga, Magadha) and Nepal. Gadis such as Nemal, Kakatpur, Garoi, & Jobra Ghat were places for spiritual actions, discourses and penance. He was learned in Ayurveda, sciences & social regulations. His works are Harivamsa, Tattva bodhini, Sunya samhita, Jyoti samhita, Gopala Ujjvala, Baranasi Gita, Anakara Brahma Samhita, Abhayada Kavacha, Astagujari, Sarana panjara stotra, Vipra chalaka, Manamahima, Maalika. The Panchasakha's individual characteristics are described as follows (in Odia and English): During the Panchasakha era another seer Raghu Arakhsita, who was not part of the Panchasakhas but was a revered saint, composed several Padabalis in Odia. The Panchasakha and Arakhshita together are known as the Sada-Goswami (six Lords). Madhavi Pattanayak or Madhavi Dasi is considered as the first Odia woman poet who was a contemporary of Prataprudra Deva and wrote several devotional poetries for Lord Jagannatha.  Imaginative medieval Odia literature (16th to mid 17th centuries)  Several Kaalpanika (imaginative) and Pauraanika (Puranic) Kavyas were composed during this period that formed the foundation for Riti Juga. The major works of this era other than those written by the Panchasakhas are Gopakeli and Parimalaa authored by Narasingha sena, contemporary of Gajapati emperor Prataprudra Deva, Chataa Ichaamati and Rasa by Banamali Das, Premalochana, Bada Shakuntala & Kalaabati by Vishnu Das, Nrushingha purana and Nirguna Mahatmya by Chaitanya Dash (born in Kalahandi), Lilaabati by Raghunatha Harichandan, Usha Bilasa by Shishu shankar Das, Sasisena by Pratap Rai, Rahashya Manjari by Devadurlava Das, Hiraabati by Ramachandra Chottaray, Deulatola by Nilambara Das, Prema Panchamruta by Bhupati Pandit, Rukmini Vivaha by Kartik Das, Goparasa by Danai Das and Kanchi Kaveri by Purushotama Das. In the 16th century three major poets translated Jayadeva's Gita Govinda into Odia. They are Dharanidhara Mishra, Brindavan Das(Rasabaridhi) and Trilochan Das (GovindaGita).http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/may-2007/engpdf/Page46-48.pdf Brundabati Dasi, a woman poet of great talent wrote Purnatama Chandrodaya Kavya towards the end of the 17th century. Several Chautishas (a form of Odia poetry where 34 stanzas from \\"ka\\" to \\"Khsya\\" are placed at the starting of each composition) were composed during this time. The famous ones being Milana Chautisha, Mandakini Chautisha, Barshabharana Chautisha, Rasakulya Chautisha, \\"Manobodha Chautisha\\". Muslim poet Salabega was one of the foremost devotional poets of this era who composed several poems dedicated to Lord Jagannath during Jahangir's reign in the 17th century.http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/june_july-2007/engpdf/Pages25-26.pdf Riti Yuga/Age of Upendra Bhanja (1650–1850) After the age of the Panchasakhas, several prominent works were written, including the Usabhilasa of Sisu Sankara Das, the Rahasya-manjari of Deva-durlabha Dasa and the Rukmini-bibha of Karttika Das. A new form of novels in verse evolved at the beginning of the 17th century when Ramachandra Pattanayaka wrote Haravali. The prominent poets of the period, however, are Dhananjaya Bhanja (born 1611. AD), Dinakrushna Das (born 1650. AD), Kabi Samrat Upendra Bhanja (born 1670. AD) and Abhimanyu Samantasinhara. Their poetry, especially that of Upendra Bhanja, is characterised by verbal tricks, obscenity and eroticism. Upendra Bhanjas works like Baidehisha Bilasa, Koti Brahmanda Sundari and Labanyabati are considered as landmarks of Odia Literature. He was conferred the title \\"Kabi Samrat\\" of Odia literature for his aesthetic poetic sense and skill with words. He wrote 52 books out of which only 25–26 are available. He alone contributed more than 35000 words to Odia literature and is considered the greatest poet of Riti Juga. Dhananjaya Bhanja (1611–1701), a poet of repute, king of Ghumusar and grandfather of Upendra Bhanja, wrote several kavyas like Anangarekha, Ichaavati, Raghunatha Bilasa, Madana Manjari. Besides Tribikrama Bhanja (author of Kanakalata) and Ghana Bhanja (author of Trailokyamohini, Rasanidhi and Govinda Bilasha) of the Bhanja royal family also enriched Odia Literature. Lokanatha Vidyadhara, a contemporary of Upendra Bhanja wrote Sarbanga Sundari. Dinakrushna Das's Rasokallola and Abhimanyu Samanta Simhara's Bidagdha Chintamani are also prominent kavyas of this time. Bidagdha Chintamani is considered the longest Kavya in Odia literature with 96 cantos exceeding that of Upendra's longest kavya of 52 cantos. Other famous works of Abhimanyu Samanta Simhara are Sulakhshyana, Prema Chintaamani, Prema Kala, Rasaabati, Prematarangini. These poets significantly influenced modern Odia Literature. A new form of poetry called \\"Bandha kabita\\" also started during this time where the poet wrote the poem within the bandha or frame of a picture drawn by him. Upendra Bhanja was the pioneer in this form of pictorial poetry. His Chitrakavya Bandhodaya is the first such creation containing 84 pictorial poems. Poets who wrote in this tradition include Sadananda Kabisurya Bramha (Lalita Lochana and Prema Kalpalata), Tribikrama Bhanja (Kanakalata), Kesabaraja Harichandana (Rasa Sindhu Sulakhshyana).  Lyrical Odia Literature towards the end of Riti Juga:  Towards the end of Riti Yuga, four major poets emerged and enriched Odia literature through their highly lyrical creations. These were Kabi Surya Baladeb Rath, Brajanath Badajena, Gopalakrushna Pattanayaka and Bhima Bhoi. Kabisurya Baladev Rath wrote his poems in champu (mixture of prose and poetry) and chautisha style of poetry. His greatest work is Kishore Chandranana Champu which is a landmark creation extensively used in Odissi Music. Brajanath Badjena started a tradition of prose fiction, though he was not an excellent prose writer. His Chatur Binoda (Amusement of Intelligent) seems to be the first work that deals with different kinds of rasas, predominantly the bibhatsa rasa, but often verges on nonsense. The style of \\"Chitra Kavya\\" (mixture of poetry and paintings) was at its best in the 18th century. Several chitra pothis can be traced to this time. Bichitra Ramayana of Biswanaath Khuntia is one of the most celebrated works of this period composed in the early 18th century. Pitambar Das wrote the epic Narasingha Purana consisting of seven parts called Ratnakaras in the 18th century. Maguni Pattanaik composed the Rama Chandra Vihara. Rama Lila was composed by Vaishya Sadashiva and Ananga Narendra. Bhima Bhoi, the blind poet born in a tribal Khondh family is known for his lucid and humanistic compositions like Stuticintamani, Bramha Nirupana Gita, Shrutinishedha Gita. The other major poets towards the end of Riti Yuga are Banamali Dasa, Jadumani Mahapatra, Bhaktacharan Das (author of Manabodha Chautisha and Mathura Mangala), Haribandhu, Gaurahari, Gauracharana, Krishna Simha all of whom enriched Odia lyrical literature.http://odisha.gov.in/e-magazine/Orissareview/jul2005/engpdf/BKP_SBCD_monobodha_chautisa.pdf  Age of Radhanath  The first printing of the Odia language was done in 1836 by Christian missionaries, replacing palm leaf inscription and revolutionising Odia literature. After this time books were printed and journals and periodicals became available in Odia. The first Odia magazine, Bodha Dayini was published in Balasore in 1861. Its goal was to promote Odia literature and draw attention to lapses in government policy. The first Odia paper The Utkala Deepika, was first published in 1866 under editor Gourishankar Ray and Bichitrananda. The Utkal Deepika campaigned to bring all Odia-speaking areas together under one administration, to develop the Odia language and literature and to protect Odia interests. In 1869 Bhagavati Charan Das started another newspaper, Utkal Subhakari, to propagate the Brahmo faith. In the last three and a half decades of the 19th century, a number of newspapers were published in Odia. Prominent papers included Utkal Deepika,Utkal Patra, Utkal Hiteisini from Cuttack, Utkal Darpan and Sambada Vahika from Balasore and Sambalpur Hiteisini from Deogarh. The success of these papers indicated the desire and determination of the people of Odisha to uphold their right to freedom of expression and freedom of the press, with the ultimate aim of freedom from British rule. These periodicals performed another vital function, in that they encouraged modern literature and offered a broad reading base for Odia-language writers. Intellectuals who came into contact with Odia literature through the papers were also influenced by their availability. Radhanath Ray (1849–1908) is the most well-known poet of this period. He wrote with a Western influence, and his kavyas (long poems) included Chandrabhaga, Nandikeshwari, Usha, Mahajatra, Darbar and Chilika. Fakir Mohan Senapati (1843–1918), the most known Odia fiction writer, was also of this generation. He was considered the Vyasakabi or founding poet of the Odia language. Senapati was born raised in the coastal town of Balasore, and worked as a government administrator. Enraged by the attempts of the Bengalis to marginalize or replace the Odia language, he took to creative writing late in life. Though he also did translations from Sanskrit, wrote poetry and attempted many forms of literature, he is now known primarily as the father of modern Odia prose fiction. His Rebati (1898) is widely recognized as the first Odia short story. Rebati is the story of a young innocent girl whose desire for education is placed in the context of a conservative society in a backward Odisha village, which is hit by the killer cholera epidemic. His other stories are \\"Patent Medicine\\", \\"Dak Munshi\\", and \\"Adharma Bitta\\". Senapati is also known for his novel Chha Maana Atha Guntha. This was the first Indian novel to deal with the exploitation of landless peasants by a feudal lord. It was written well before the October revolution in Russia and emerging of Marxist ideas in India. Other eminent Odia writers and poets of the time include Gangadhar Meher (1862–1924), Madhusudan Rao, Chintamani Mohanty, Nanda Kishore Bal (1875-1928) Gourishankar Ray (1838-1917) and Reba Ray (1876-1957). Age of Satyabadi During the Age of Radhanath the literary world was divided between the classicists, led by the magazine The Indradhanu, and the modernists, led by the magazine The Bijuli. Gopabandhu Das (1877–1928) was a great balancer and realized that a nation, as well as its literature, lives by its traditions. He believed that a modern national superstructure could only endure if based on solid historical foundations. He wrote a satirical poem in The Indradhanu, which led to punishment by the Inspector of Schools, but he refused to apologise. Gopabandhu joined Ravenshaw College in Cuttack to pursue graduation after this incident. He started the Kartavya Bodhini Samiti (Duty Awakening Society) in college to encourage his friends to take on social, economic and political problems and become responsible citizens. While leading a team to serve flood victims, Gopabandhu heard that his son was seriously ill. He preferred, however, to save the \\"sons of the soil\\" rather than his son. His mission was to reform society and develop education in the name of a social service vision. He lost his wife at age twenty-eight, and had already lost all three of his sons by this time. He left his two daughters and his property in the village with his elder brother, rejecting worldly life. For this social service mission he is regarded by Odias as the Utkalmani. As freedom movements began, a new era in literary thought emerged influenced by Gandhi and the trend of nationalism. Gopabandhu was a large part of this idealistic movement, founding a school in Satyabadi and influencing many writers of the period. Other than Gopabandhu himself, other famous writers of the era were Godabarisha Mishra, Nilakantha Dash, Harihara Acharya and Krupasinshu. They are known as 'Panchasakhas' for their similarities with the historical Age of Panchasakhas. Their principle genres were criticism, essays and poetry. Chintamani Das is particularly renowned. Born in 1903 in Sriramachandrapur village near Sakhigopal, he was bestowed with the Sahitya Akademi Samman in 1970 for his invaluable contribution to Odia literature. Some of his well-known literary works are Manishi Nilakantha, Bhala Manisa Hua, Usha, Barabati, Byasakabi Fakiramohan and Kabi Godabarisha. Age of Romanticism or Sabuja Yuga Influenced by the Romantic thoughts of Rabindranath Tagore during the 1930s when progressive Marxist movements dominated Odia Literature, Kalindi Charan Panigrahi (the brother of Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi who founded Marxism in Odisha) formed a group called \\"Sabuja Samiti\\" with two of his writer friends Annada Shankar Ray and Baikuntha Patnaik. This was a very short period in Odia literature, later folded into Gandhian and Marxist work. Kalindi Charan Panigrahi later wrote his famous novel Matira Manisha, which was influenced by Gandhism, and Annada Shankar Ray left for Bengali literature. Mayadhar Mansingh was a renowned poet of that time, but though he was considered a Romantic poet he kept his distance from the influence of Rabindranath.  Pragati Yuga  Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad formed in 1935 was one of the first progressive literary organizations in India, contemporaneous to other progressive writers movements. The founders of the Progressive Movement in Odisha were Nabakrushna Choudhury, Bhagabati Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. At the inaugural session of Nabajuga Sahitya Sansad, the great freedom fighter Malati Choudhury sang \\"Nabeena Jugara Taruna Jagare\\" written by Ananta Patnaik. The mouth piece of Nabajuga Sahity Sansad was Adhunika, the First Progressive Literary Magazine in Odia. Adhuinka was conceived, initiated, edited, published and nurtured by Bhagabati Charan Panigrahi and Ananta Patnaik. Many writers of that time wrote in Adhunika. Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha The Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is a monumental 7-volume work of about 9,500 pages published between 1930 and 1940. It was a result of the vision and dedicated work of Gopal Chandra Praharaj (1874–1945) over nearly three decades. Praharaj not only conceived of and compiled the work, he also raised the finances to print it through public donations, grants and subscriptions and supervised the printing and the sales of the published work. The Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an Odia language dictionary that lists some 185,000 words and their meanings in four languages – Odia, English, Hindi and Bengali. It includes quotations from wide-ranging classical works illustrating the special usage of various words. It also contains specialised information such as botanical names of local plants, information on astronomy and long articles on various topics of local interest. In addition, there are biographies of personalities connected with Odisha's history and culture. The Purnachandra Odia Bhashakosha is an encyclopedic work touching on various aspects of the Odia language and Odisha region, as well as many topics of general interest. Its author Praharaj was a lawyer by profession and was ridiculed and reviled by many during production itself. Many printed copies were destroyed unbound and unsold. Many copies sat in libraries of the princes who had patronised the work and most of these copies were sold cheaply when the princes met financial ruin. There are few surviving copies, and those that exist are fragile and worm-damaged. The work is regarded by the older generation, but not well known among younger Odias. Post Colonial Age Poetry As the successors of Sachi Routray, the father of modern odia poetry, Guruprasad Mohanty and Bhanuji Rao were highly influenced by T.S. Eliot and published a co-authored poetry book Nutan Kabita. Ramakanta Rath later modified Eliot's ideas in his own work. According to Rath : \\"After the publication of Kalapurusha Guru Prasad's poetry collection influenced by T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land] we realized that a sense of alienation is the main ingredient of modern poetry.\\" Before independence Odia poetry was mostly written with Sanskritic or \\"literary\\" idiom, but after independence poets freely used of Western concepts, idioms, images and adaptation of Western myths.Ramakanta Rath, Sitakant Mahapatra, Soubhagya Kumar Mishra, Rajendra kishore Panda, Pratibha Satpathy, Mamata Dash, Haraprasad Das are the most famous of these poets. From the mid 60s and into the 70s the prominent poets of Odia were : Radha Mohan Gadanayak, Benudhar Rout, Brajanath Rath, Bangali Nanda, Harihar Mishra, Dipak Mishra, Kamalakant Lenka, Banshidhar Sarangi, Durga Charan Parida, Devdas Chhotray, Saroj Ranjan Mohanty, Amaresh Patnaik, Ashutosh Parida, Prasanna Patsani, Hussain Rabi Gandhi, Sadasiba Dash. Other poets of this time are : Hrishkesh Mullick, Satrughna Pandab, Prabasini Mahakuda, Aaparna Mohanty, Aswini Mishra, Roninikant Mukherjee, Girija Baliarsingh, and Dr.Goutam Jena ,who has written ten poetry books and three criticism books.His poem collections are Samaya Bisada Nai.EkaEkaDina, Ranga Siuli, Maya Manaska, Pancham Raga, Bahuda Bela, Jivana Veda, Darsana yoga, Priya Mati and Kabita 2020.He is the pioneer of \\"Matimanaskabad\\" Ramesh Pati . The early 80s saw in Odia literature a group of poets with new thoughts and styles who overshadowed the earlier generation. These poets had their root in typical Odia soil. The rich heritage and culture with the feelings of commomen were depicted in their Odia poems. They were somehow nearer to the readers as there were little ambiguity in their expression. These contemporary poems were better than the so-called modern poems. The prominent poets of this time included : Manasi Pradhan. Critics refer to them as the contemporary poet generation. Odia Translation of World Classics Eminent scholar Prof. Ananta Charan Sukla's celebrated Odia Translation (with Commentary, Critical Study and Notes) of Aristotle's Poetics (Aristotle-anka Kabyatatwa) published in the late 1960s is a rare and outstanding work. It is the second translation of the classic work in any Indian language after Bengali. His translation of four classic Greek plays is also a commendable work. Fiction =Before the 1970s= In the post- independence era Odia fiction took a new direction. The trend Fakir Mohan started developed more after independence, led by Gopinath Mohanty (1914–1991), Surendra Mohanty and Manoj Das (1934– ). These authors pioneered the trend of developing or projecting the \\"individual as protagonist\\" in Odia fiction. There is some tension between the two Mohantys among critics. Eminent feminist writer and critic Sarojini Sahoo believes that it is not Gopinath's story \\"Dan\\", but rather Surendra Mohanty's \\"Ruti O Chandra\\" that should be considered the first story of the individualistic approach.Istahar-92, (26th Volume, 2nd Issue), The major difference between Surendra and Gopinath is that, where Gopinath is more optimistic, Surendra is nihilistic. This nihilism prepared the ground for the development an existentialist movement in Odia literature. Surendra Mohanty is a master of language, theme and concept. Some of his famous short story collections and novels are Krushna Chuda, Mahanagarira Rati, Ruti O Chandra, Maralara Mrutyu, Shesha Kabita, Dura Simanta, Oh Calcutta, Kabi-O- Nartaki, Sabuja Patra-O-Dhusara Golap, Nila Shaila and Andha Diganta. In his fiction Gopinath Mohanty explores all aspects of Odishan life, both in the plains and in the hills. He uses a unique prose style, lyrical in style, choosing worlds and phrases from the day-to-day speech of ordinary men and women. Gopinath's first novel, Mana Gahtra Chasa, was published in 1940, followed by Dadi Budha (1944), Paraja (1945) and Amrutara Santan (1947). He published 24 novels, 10 collections of short stories, three plays, two biographies, two volumes of critical essays and five books on the languages of Kandh, Gadaba and Saora tribes. He also translated Tolstoy's War and Peace (Yuddh O Shanti) in three volumes (tr. 1985–86) and Togore's Jogajog (tr. 1965) into Odia. The writer Kalpanakumari Devi's sequence of novels, in particular, her Srushti o pralaya (1959), documenting the social change in the country have been lauded. Starting his literary career as a communist and later becoming an Aurobindian philosopher, Manoj Das proved himself as a successful bilingual writer in Odia and English. His major Odia works are: Shesha Basantara Chithi (1966), Manoj Dasanka Katha O Kahani (1971), Dhumabha Diganta (1971), Manojpancabimsati (1977) and Tuma Gam O Anyanya Kabita (1992). Notable English works include The crocodile's lady : a collection of stories (1975), The submerged valley and other stories, Farewell to a ghost : short stories and a novelette (1994), Cyclones (1987) and A tiger at twilight (1991). Renowned writer Ananta Charan Sukla's short story collection, \\"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\\" (Last Letter to Sulata) published in 1965 is also worth mentioning. The ten stories included in this book are \\"Sulataku Sesa Chitthi\\", \\"Kapilas\\", \\"Janeika Kulapati-nka Mrutyu\\", \\"Tandril Ru Tornoto\\", \\"Mystic Realistic\\", \\"Prasanta Samudra: Asanta Lahari\\", \\"Nalakula Matha, Nepala Babu O Narana\\", \\"Daudana Bada Khara\\", \\"Duragata\\" and \\"Sandipani-ra Symphony\\". Other significant pre-1970s fiction writers are Chandrasekhar Rath, Shantanu Kumar Acharya, Mohapatra Nilamani Sahoo, Akhil Mohan Patnaik, Gobind Das, Rabi Patnaik and Jagannath Prasad Das. Chandra Sekhar Rath's novel Jantrarudha is one of the renowned classics of this period. Shantanu Acharya's novel Nara- Kinnara was also influential. =After the 1970s= The trends started by the 1950s and 1960s were challenged by the young writers in the 1970s. This challenge began in the 1960s with a small magazine Uan Neo Lu in Cuttack. The title of the magazine was made up of three of the Odia alphabets, which were not in use. Writers associated with the magazines included Annada Prasad Ray, Guru Mohanty (not to be confused with Guru Prasad), Kailash Lenka and Akshyay Mohanty. These writers were not as famous as some contemporaries, but they began a revolution in Odia fiction. They tried to break the monopoly of established writers, introducing sexuality in their work and creating a new prose style. In the late 1960s the Cuttack's in Odia Literature was broken when many \\"groups\\" of writers emerged from different parts of Odisha. Anamas from Puri, Abadhutas from Balugaon, Panchamukhi from Balangir, Abujha from Berhampur and Akshara group from Sambalpur created a sensation in Odia literary scene. The changes that started in the 1960s were confirmed in the next decade. Jagadish Mohanty, Kanheilal Das, Satya Mishra, Ramchandra Behera, Tarun Kanti Mishra, Padmaja Pal, Yashodhara Mishra and Sarojini Sahoo created a new era in Odia fiction. Kanheilal Das and Jagadish Mohanty began creating a new style and language popular among a general audience as well as intellectuals. Kanheilal Das died young and is still considered a great loss for Odia fictions. Jagadish Mohanty introduced existentialism to Odia literature. His renowned works include Ekaki Ashwarohi, Dakshina Duari Ghara, Album, Dipahara Dekhinathiba Lokotie, Nian O Anyanya Galpo, Mephestophelesera Pruthibi, Nija Nija Panipatha, Kanishka Kanishka, Uttaradhikar and Adrushya Sakal. Ramchandra Behera is known for short story collections Dwitiya Shmashana, Abashishta Ayusha, Omkara Dhwani, Bhagnangshara Swapna and Achinha Pruthibi. Padmaj Pal is also known for short story collections including Eaglera Nakha Danta, Sabuthu Sundar Pakshi, Jibanamaya and Uttara Purusha. Tarun Kanti Mishra emerged during 1970s as a powerful storyteller with an elegant style, full of poise and vigor. His outstanding works include 'Sharadah Shatam' ( A Thousand Autumns), – a novel dealing with resettlement and rehabilitation of displaced persons from East Pakistan, now Bangladesh—and anthologies of short stories such as 'Komal Gandhar', 'Bitansa', 'Bhaswati' and 'Akash Setu'. Sarojini Sahoo, another prominent writer, later famous as a feminist writer, also significantly contributed to Odia fiction. Her novel Gambhiri Ghara is not only a landmark Odia novel but has also gained international fame for its feminist and liberal ideas. Her other works include Amrutara Pratikshare, Chowkatha, Upanibesh, Pratibandi, Paksibasa, Tarlijauthiba Durga, Dukha Apramita, Gambhiri Ghara and Mahajatra. Kanaklata Hati, another women fiction writer in whose writing we will find psychoanalysis of female mind. To date she has published two-story collections- 'Nirbak Pahada' & 'Kuhudi Ghara'. She has some translated story collections like 'Galpa Galpantara' and'Praibeshi Galpa'. =Popular fiction writings= A popular Odia literature also emerged in the 1970s, read by rural populace especially women. The best selling writers are Bhagirathi Das, Kanduri Das, Bhagwana Das, Bibhuti Patnaik and Pratibha Ray. Some of their works were made into films in the Odia language. In recent times Rabi Kaunungo, Tarun Kanti Mishra, Ajay Swain, Mrinal Chatterjee, Radhu Mishra, Dr Laxmikant Tripathy, Nisith Bose, Suniti Mund, Anjan Chand and Dr. Kulangara have contributed to popular writing. =Women's writings and feminism= The founding of a women's magazine called Sucharita in 1975 by Sakuntala Panda had a significant impact in helping female writers find a voice. Some of those writers are Giribala Mohanty, Jayanti Rath, Susmita Bagchi. Paramita Satpathy, Hiranmayee Mishra, Chirashree Indra Singh, Sairindhree Sahoo, Supriya Panda, Gayatri Saraf, Suniti Mund and Mamatamayi Chowdhry. Giribala Mohanty (1947–) needs a special introduction for her deep sensitiveness for women's issues. Her poems depict the emotional binary of social apathy and the self-confidence of women. Her collections of Poems 'Streeloka' (Women), 'Kalijhia' (The Dark complexion Girl),'Ma Habara Dukha' (The sorrow of being a mother) and 'Kati Katia Katyayani' expresses her feelings in a lucid and lyrical way. Sarojini Sahoo had a significant influence on these women, paving the way with a feminist approach to fiction and the introduction of sexuality in her work. She is known as the Simone de Beauvoir of India, though theoretically she denies the Hegelian theory of \\"Other\\" developed by de Beauvoir in her The Second Sex. Unlike de Beauvoir, Sahoo claims that women are an \\"Other\\" from the masculine perspective, but that they are entitled to equal human rights according to Plato. Suniti Mund's Story Book 'Anustupa', Poetry Book 'Jhia' And Novel 'Abhisapta', 'Agarbatira Ghara', 'Matrimony dot com','Gigolo' is also a feminist voice. Drama The traditional Odia theater is the folk opera, or Jatra, which flourishes in the rural areas of Odisha. Modern theater is no longer commercially viable, but in the 1960 experimental theatre made a mark through the works of Manoranjan Das, who pioneered a new theater movement with his brand of experimentalism. Bijay Mishra, Biswajit Das, Kartik Rath, Ramesh Prasad Panigrahi, Ratnakar Chaini, Prasanna Das, Pramod Kumar Tripathy, Sankar Tripathy, Ranjit Patnaik, Dr. Pradip Bhowmic, Hemendra Mahapatra, and Purna Chandra Mallick continued the tradition. Tripathy's contribution to the growth and development of the immensely popular and thought-provoking lok natakas is universally recognised and he is often called the Rousseau of lok natakas. Noted writer Ananta Charan Sukla's Odia translation of four classic Greek dramas is a rare contribution to Odia drama literature. His book, \\"Greek Drama\\", published in 1974, has translations (with commentary) of Prometheus Bound (by Aeschylus), Oedipus the King (by Sophocles), Medea (by Euripides) and The Frogs (by Aristophanes). Sukla's translations of the plays have been staged in various colleges and universities of Odisha. Besides, his two historical plays on Odia freedom fighters Chakhi Khuntia and Jayee Rajguru have also been widely staged. Though there is no commercially viable modern Odia theater, there are amateur theater groups and drama competitions. Operas, on the other hand, are commercially successful. Popular science fiction writers from Odisha Some popular science fiction writers include Prof Prana Krushna Parija, Padmashree Binod Kanungo, Prof Gokulananda Mohapatra, Prof Gadadhar Mishra, Prof Kulamani Samal, Sarat Kumar Mohanty, Prof Amulya Kumar Panda, Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy, Dr. Debakanta Mishra, Dr.Ramesh Chandra Parida, Sashibhusan Rath, Dr. Chitta Ranjan Mishra, Dr. Nityananada Swain, Dr. Choudhury Satybrata Nanda, Er. Mayadhar Swain, Kamalakanta Jena, Himansu Sekhar Fatesingh and Bibhuprasad Mohapatra. Dr. Nikhilanand Panigrahy's \\"Sampratikatara Anuchintare Bigyan O Baigyanik\\" is a popular book among avid readers. Sashibhusan Rath's Vigyan Chinta and Kamalakanta Jena's Gapare Gapare Bigyan (Awarded by Odisha Bigyan Academy 2011) are written for children as well as adults. In the United States of America A large initiative, Pratishruti, was started to connect literary minded people in North America with their Indian peers. The goal is to expose Indian-Americans to the best writings of outstanding Odia writers as well as to cultivate new writers in America. Black Eagle Books, a non-profit publishing initiative was started in April 2019 to propagate Odia literature globally through book publication and translation projects. To encourage new writers, Black Eagle Books started \\"Black Eagle Books First Book Award\\" and award for 2019 was given to Niharika Mallick for her translation anthology of contemporary Hindi short stories in Odia, Adhunika Hindi Galpamala.

Schober was appointed Vienna Chief of Police in 1918 and became the founding president of Interpol in 1923, holding both positions until his death. He served as the chancellor of Austria from June 1921 to May 1922 and again from September 1929 to September 1930. He also served ten stints as an acting minister, variously leading the ministries of education, finance, commerce, foreign affairs, justice, and the interior, sometimes just for a few days or weeks at a time. Although Schober was elected to the National Council as the leader of a loose coalition of Greater German People's Party and Landbund near the end of his career, he never formally joined any political party. Schober remained the only chancellor in Austrian history with no official ideological affiliation until 2019, when Brigitte Bierlein was appointed, becoming the first woman to take office.  Early life  Johannes Schober was born on November 14, 1874 in Perg, Upper Austria. Schober was the tenth child of Franz Schober, a senior civil servant and veteran of Radetzky's Italian campaigns, and Klara Schober, née Lehmann, a smallholder's daughter. On his father's side, the family came from money and prestige; Schober's paternal grandfather had been a physician. As was common among Catholic Austrians who were upper middle class but not quite upper crust, Schober's parents combined an ethos of obedience to Church and State with a broad pan- German streak and a strong attachment to their rural homeland with an appreciation for the humanities and the arts. The education they imparted on young Johannes appears to have emphasized hard work, piety, and patriotism. The boy showed considerable academic aptitude during his years in the local elementary school and was thus groomed for university education from an early age. He attended the gymnasium in Linz and the Vincentinum, a Catholic boys' boarding school. Even though he had to work as a private tutor to pay his way, his grades were excellent. In 1894, having completed his secondary education, Schober enrolled at the University of Vienna to read law. A great lover of music, he joined the Academic Choral Society (), a type of Burschenschaft.  Career   Service in the Empire  Johannes Schober, ca. 1922 In 1898, Schober left the university and joined the Rudolfsheim police inspectorate as an apprentice clerk (). He had completed his studies but had either not taken or not passed the complete set of graduation exams. He left, accordingly, not with a doctorate but an . Being nothing but a glorified certificate of attendance, the did not qualify its holder to receive the post-graduate education necessary to become a lawyer in private practice, a prosecutor, or a judge. Even so, it technically made its holder a person of academic rank. As such, it was good enough to permit admission into higher civil service. In particular, it qualified Schober to receive post-graduate training for the position of lawyer in police service (). By 1900, Schober had completed his training with distinction and was assigned to the prestigious Innere Stadt inspectorate. Schober had been induced to join the police by one of his favorite operas, the Evangelimann, a play based on the 1892 autobiography of a Viennese detective inspector. Because Schober was fluent not just in German and French but also in English, he was put in charge of protecting Edward VII during Edward's summer holidays in Marienbad. His proximity to the British monarch for six consecutive summers appears to have been the basis for the friendly relations to the English-speaking world that Schober was noted for later in life. The assignment also seems to have been a boost for his career. He was promoted to a position in the Ministry of the Interior proper, where he was involved in watching over the Emperor and the Imperial Family – protecting them, but also keeping them under surveillance. Effective March 1, 1913, at the relatively young age of 38, Schober was made one of the heads of the Office of State Security (). When World War I broke out a little over a year later, Schober thus found himself one of the chiefs of Austrian counter- intelligence operations. He became noted for his lenient disposition. When Edmund von Gayer, the Vienna Chief of Police, was made Minister of the Interior in June 1918, Schober was appointed his successor. Schober also received the honorary title of on the occasion.  Chief of Police  Karl Renner presided over the peaceful transition from monarchy to republic, successful in part due to Schober's ready assistance During the chaos days of the collapse of the Empire in late 1918, Schober's tact and resourcefulness played a crucial role in maintaining peace and public order in Vienna. Following the proclamation of the Republic of German-Austria on November 12, Schober placed his forces at the disposal of the provisional government but also secured the safety of the Imperial Family, whose departure from Vienna he supervised. Leaders of multiple major parties – especially Social Democrats, and Karl Renner in particular – declared themselves grateful. On November 30, the provisional government confirmed Schober in his position as the Vienna Chief of Police. On December 3, he was put in charge of public safety () in the rest of the country as well. Austria's Communists, even though they envisioned the establishment of a soviet republic instead of the parliamentary system that Austria was headed for, had been largely peaceful during the critical months between October 1918 and February 1919. The Social Democrats had pursued, with apparent success, a strategy of absorbing and assimilating them; the provisional Austrian army had absorbed and assimilated their party militia. No Communist Party had run in the February 1919 Constituent Assembly elections. In March, however, Béla Kun's establishment of the Hungarian Soviet Republic encouraged parts of the Communist leadership to try to seize power by force. Protests with thousands of participants were orchestrated, some of them ending in clashes of protesters with police. A confrontation on April 17 killed 5 police and a female civilian. A further 36 police and 30 civilians were injured, many of them severely. The protesters set fire to the parliament building. The harsh positions taken by the victorious Allies in the Paris Peace Conference, especially the reparations payments they were preparing to impose, heightened the tensions. The Communists began preparing a mass protest for June 15, urging their supporters to carry arms and hoping to turn the march into an insurrection. A conference of party leaders on June 14 was meant to finalize marching orders. Informed of these plans, Schober petitioned the government to disallow the protest. When the government declined, Schober had security police raid the conference and arrest all 122 participants. The next day, a demonstration demanding the release of the prisoners precipitated a bloody street fight that left 12 protesters dead and 80 seriously injured. Schober's crackdown earned him the trust of the political right. He was now considered \\"a tough law-and-order man.\\"  Abortive bid for the chancellorship  The fourteen parties in Austria's Constituent Assembly had radically different visions regarding the constitutional, territorial, and economic future of their demoralized, impoverished rump state. The government, a grand coalition of Social Democrats and Christian Social Party, found itself blocked at every turn by party leaders' unwillingness to compromise. No other alliance would have commanded the support of a stable parliamentary majority. Austrians began to warm to the idea of a \\"cabinet of civil servants\\" (\\"\\"), a government of senior career bureaucrats who would be loyal to the State and not to any particular ideological camp. The Habsburg Empire had consciously cultivated an ethos of partisan neutrality in its civil servants. A pool of highly educated middle-aged administrators who counted sober professionalism as an important aspect of their self-image stood ready to be tapped. When the grand coalition fell apart in June 1920, Schober looked like the man of the hour to many. He was known to be close to the pan-German cause but still considered nonpartisan. Ignaz Seipel, chairman of the Christian Social Party, was reluctant to assume the chancellorship because of the difficult decisions and general hardship he knew still lay ahead; he wanted someone else to do the dirty work. Schober was respected across party divides for his competence and effectiveness. He also enjoyed a reputation for personal integrity, an important point in a country sick of corruption and nepotism. All but unanimously, the new National Council invited Schober to draw up a list of ministers. When Schober chose Josef Redlich as his Finance Minister, a post that Redlich had already held for a short while during the final days of the collapsing Empire, the Greater German People's Party vetoed Redlich on the grounds that Redlich was Jewish. Schober bowed out. Michael Mayr became chancellor in his stead.  First government  Ignaz Seipel, the leader of the Christian Social Party and Schober's eventual main antagonist Mayr's term as a chancellor lasted less than a year. The Republic of German-Austria had been proclaimed with the understanding that it would eventually join the German Reich, a vision shared by a clear majority of its population at the time. The treaties of Versailles and Saint-Germain prohibited a union of the two countries, but unification remained popular. Several provincial governments hatched plans to break away from Austria and join Germany on their own; preparations for local referendums were made. Mayr ordered the would-be defectors to cease and desist but was ignored. Having lost its authority, the second Mayr government resigned on June 1, 1921. Schober was asked to step up, agreed, and became Chancellor of Austria on June 21. The cabinet was supported by a coalition of Christian Social Party and Greater German People's Party, but eight of its eleven members were independents. The Christian Socials Walter Breisky and Carl Vaugoin served as the vice chancellor and the minister of the army, respectively; the People's Party's Leopold Waber served as the minister of education and the interior. The remaining seven ministers were, like Schober himself, veteran civil servants with no overt party affiliation. In addition to holding the chair, Schober led the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, although only in an acting capacity () and not as an actual minister. The main problems facing Schober's cabinet were Austria's galloping inflation and the country's unresolved relationship with Czechoslovakia. Austria depended on its neighbor to the north for food and coal – food and coal it was increasingly unable to afford. Austria needed credit, not just for essential consumables but also in order to restructure. No loans would be forthcoming, however, as long as the Allies could not be thoroughly certain that Austria would obey the provisions of the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Prague was still worried about a possible Austrian attempt to join Germany and also about a possible Austrian attempt to restore the Habsburgs to power; amicable relations with Czechoslovakia would go a long way towards reassuring Austria's potential creditors. On December 16, Chancellor Schober and President Michael Hainisch signed the Treaty of Lana, promising to honor the Treaty of Saint-Germain, to refrain from interfering in Czechoslovak internal affairs, and to remain neutral in the event on an attack on Czechoslovakia by a third party. Their counterparts, Tomáš Masaryk and Edvard Beneš, made equivalent promises in return. They also promised to put in a good word for Austria in London and Paris and, in fact, committed to a generous loan themselves. From the point of view of Schober, the treaty was a great success. Austria had given away nothing that had not long been lost already, and the symbolic gesture had been handsomely rewarded. From the point of view of the People's Party, the treaty was tantamount to treason. Austria had further reduced its chances of ever joining Germany and had sold out the Sudeten Germans to boot. On January 16, the People's Party representative in Schober's cabinet, Waber, resigned his post; Schober and Breisky took over as acting ministers of the interior and of education, respectively. Unable to govern without the support of the People's Party, Schober ultimately stepped down himself on January 26. Breisky was appointed his successor.  Second government  van Karnebeek at the 1922 Genoa Conference Schober's resignation ended the coalition and therefore relieved the People's Party of its contractual obligation to side with the cabinet in the National Council, i.e. to support the ratification of the Treaty of Lana. The treaty was ratified with the votes of Christian Socials and Social Democrats. Having been able to vote in opposition, the People's Party was partially appeased and was ready to resume support for the Schober government, who in any case was still the only plausible contender. Schober resumed the chancellorship on January 27. Breisky had been in office for barely twenty-four hours. Breisky went back to being vice chancellor. Schober returned as acting minister of the interior, although not as acting minister of foreign affairs. Reluctant support in the National Council nonwithstanding, the nationalists never forgave Schober for the Treaty of Lana. While Schober continued to fight Austria's crippling financial problems and otherwise focused on foreign policy, Seipel, still the chairman of the Christian Social Party, decided that the time had come for him to take over. In April, Schober left the country to participate in the crucial Genoa Conference. His opponents used his absence to orchestrate his replacement. In May, already on his way home, Schober learned that the Christian Socials had withdrawn their support his cabinet. Schober resigned on May 24; he agreed to stay on in a caretaker capacity until the first Seipel government could be sworn in on May 31.  Return to law enforcement  Ousted as chancellor, Schober resumed his duties as the Vienna Chief of Police and the man in charge of Austrian public safety. He undertook to modernize the force, to expand its capacities, and to intensify international cooperation. In 1923, Schober convened the Second International Police Congress and took the initiative in creating Interpol. He personally assumed the role of Interpol's founding president. Schober otherwise focused on centralizing the Austrian police corps' command structure and on strengthening traffic police, criminal police, the intelligence network, and the force's internal welfare program. He also worked to reduce to influence of Social Democrats on the force.  July Revolt  The events of July 15 contributed to the rise of the Heimwehr movement and thus to Austria's eventual fall from democracy On January 30, 1927, members of the militia opened fire on an unarmed and unsuspecting crowd of Social Democrats in an ambush attack in the small town of Schattendorf, killing two and wounding five others. The were a right-wing vigilante group of war veterans, originally founded by disgruntled officers but also recruiting among the enlisted. Their stated aims were \\"uniting all Aryan front-line fighters\\" (\\"\\"), \\"nurturing the love for the homeland\\" (\\"\\"), fighting leftists, and suppressing Jews. Their membership numbered in the thousands; a rally in 1920 appears to have attracted some sixty thousand sympathizers. The group's main activity was assaulting Social Democrats and Communists and disrupting their meetings. In 1927, the group was in the process of being assimilated into the Nazi Party, a process that would be completed by 1929. The killings caused considerable outrage. The shooting had been a surprise attack from a concealed position. One of the slain was a disabled veteran and father. The other dead body was that of a young child, the only child of an impoverished family. Tensions between the parties rose so high as to completely paralyze the National Council. All useful work having ground to a halt, the legislature voted to dissolve itself and called for early elections. The had killed Social Democrats before, but the resulting trials had usually ended in acquittals or conspicuously lenient sentences. The Social Democrats now announced that they had had enough; their opponents in turn accused them of trying to exert undue pressure on the judiciary. On July 14, the two charged with the shooting where acquitted. Workers and other Social Democrats in Vienna reacted with spontaneous strikes and protests. Party leadership was hesitant to stoke the flames but lost control. The police appeared disorganized and overwhelmed. Skirmishes ensued. Unfounded rumors accused the police of murdering protesters, the protesters of lynching police. Around noon on July 15, an angry mob cordoned off the Palace of Justice and set fire to the building, then prevented the fire brigade from moving in. Fearing for the lives of those trapped inside the Palace, police decided to disperse the mob by shooting their rifles – mainly into the air, but also into the crowd. At the end of the day, 4 police and 85 protesters were dead; some 600 police had been injured. The number of injured civilians was difficult to ascertain because many avoided seeking medical assistance for fear of prosecution. Hospitals reported that 328 had been admitted for inpatient treatment; the total number of civilians hurt was 548 according to the authorities and 1057 according to the Arbeiter-Zeitung. Although Schober had been mostly uninvolved in the events of July 15, the Social Democrats laid the blame for the loss of life squarely at his door. The Arbeiter-Zeitung called him a \\"bloodhound\\" (\\"\\") and a \\"murderer of workers\\" (\\"\\"). Schober became a deeply controversial figure for the rest of his life and for decades beyond. Noted public intellectuals such as Karl Kraus, an eminent writer and erstwhile admirer of Schober's, joined the attacks. Kraus accused Schober of \\"fecklessness, deceitfulness, and abuse of power\\" and called for Schober to resign. He launched a poster campaign and railed against Schober in a 1928 stage play, The Insurmountables (). In what has been called a \\"crusade\\" by commentators, Kraus would make Schober his prime target until the day Schober died. Schober, who sincerely believed that he had always treated the Social Democrats with fairness and whose skin was thinner than his reputation suggested, experienced the attacks as vicious and appears to have been genuinely hurt. He was elated when Karl Seitz, a leading Social Democrat and the Mayor of Vienna, extended a personal apology in 1929.  Third government  Chancellor Schober in The Hague, January 1930 In spite of the successful integration of Austria into the international community that Schober – and later Seipel – achieved, the country's economic situation continued to deteriorate. The currency collapsed into hyperinflation. Inflation was brought under control through a currency reform, but the foreign creditors funding this reform demanded a course of strict austerity that made most Austrians even poorer. Unemployment was high, unemployment benefits and pensions were inadequate. In fact, even Austrians in stable formal employment had trouble meeting basic needs. Partisan strife also continued to worsen. Inspired by the apparent successes of Fascist movements abroad, frustrated by the Austrian democracy's inability to put the nation back on track, and distressed by the July Revolt, an increasing number of Austrians on the political right believed that the country's elites in general, and its parliamentary system in particular, needed to be swept away. A strongman was called for to end the infighting, shut down the Social Democrats, and put the Jews in their place. A system of thought developed that combined Fascism, Catholic clericalism, and the Antisemitism traditionally endemic in large parts of the Austrian political right. The resulting Austrofascist Heimwehr movement was loosely affiliated with the Christian Social Party; it had the support of much of the party's core constituencies and of many, although not all, of the party's leaders. By 1929, the Heimwehr had become a serious danger to Austrian democracy. It demanded that Austria's parliamentary democracy be replaced with a presidential system and threatened insurrection should the government refuse. The threats were credible. The Streeruwitz government, a coalition of Christian Social Party, People's Party, and the agrarian Landbund, engaged the Heimwehr in negotiations regarding constitutional reform. Heimwehr, government, and Social Democrats were close to a compromise when, in late September, Heimwehr and Christian Social Party brought down Streeruwitz anyway. Seipel was still leading the Christian Social Party but once again had no desire to step up and assume responsibility himself. As he had done in 1921, Seipel chose to install Schober instead. The third Schober government was sworn in on September 26. Like Schober's previous two cabinets, it consisted mainly of political independents. Schober's picks included Michael Hainisch and Theodor Innitzer. A former president of Austria and a noted professor of theology, respectively, Hainisch and Innitzer enjoyed wide name recognition and broad respect with the general public. Schober himself became acting minister again, this time leading the ministries of education and of finance. Any hope of economic recovery was instantly squashed by the Wall Street Crash of 1929, striking a mere four weeks after Schober's inauguration. The Great Depression hit Austria even harder than most other countries. Austria still depended on regular foreign cash infusions, but credit quickly dried up as a result of the downturn. The government was successful in other respects, however. Most importantly, Schober neutralized the threat of Heimwehr revolt. On the one hand, he signalled willingness to meet Heimwehr demands for constitutional reform halfway, continuing negotiations where the Streeruwitz government had left off. On the other hand, he pointedly refused to include Heimwehr men in his cabinet and insisted that the new constitution be implemented legally, i.e. pursuant to the amendment rules laid down in the existing constitution. The new constitution would need the support of two thirds of the members of the National Council, meaning that it could not be passed without the assent of the Social Democrats. Schober invited Social Democratic representatives to join the talks and refused to be intimidated by the rallies the Heimwehr kept staging as a show of force. Eventually, a compromise was reached; the Council passed a set of amendments to the Federal Constitutional Law on December 7, 1929. The compromise significantly strengthened the power and prestige of the office of the president. It also altered appointment procedures to the Constitutional Court in a way that the Heimwehr thought would guarantee right-of-center majorities for the foreseeable future. The compromise was a disappointment for the Heimwehr and its foreign allies, and a victory for the Social Democrats, in all other respects. Schober was also successful on the foreign policy front. In particular, Schober convinced the Allies of World War I, on a conference in The Hague in January 1930, to forgive the reparations that Austria still owed. Observers noted that Schober achieved his diplomatic victories through a strategy of comporting himself as an affable simpleton. Short, pudgy, intellectually outmatched, eager to oblige, happy to be patronized, and head of a country that was no threat to anyone any more, Schober seems to have put his negotiating partners into a generous mood. According to one contemporary Austrian cartoon, Schober received so many friendly pats on the shoulder from foreign dignitaries that he took to traveling with a cushion strapped to his back. Dissatisfied by the new constitution and in financial straits due to a crisis in the Austrian banking sector that had toppled one of its main donors, the Heimwehr decided that the way forward was to increase the pressure again. A Heimwehr rally in Korneuburg on May 18 culminated in de facto declaration of war on the Republic, a firm promise of armed insurrection. One of the leaders of the radical element in the Heimwehr at the time was Waldemar Pabst, a German national. Schober had Pabst deported. The Heimwehr was now determined to get rid of Schober. The Christian Socials agreed to help. The party was jealous of Schober's successes; the relationship was strained additionally by personal tensions between Schober and Seipel and between Schober and his Vice Chancellor, Carl Vaugoin. Vaugoin, a friend of the Heimwehr to begin with, provoked a quarrel with Schober by demanding that Franz Strafella be appointed director general of the Austrian Railways; Strafella was both a noted Heimwehr man and known to be corrupt. When Schober refused, Vaugoin ostentatiously resigned on September 25. Realizing that his cabinet was unable to carry on, Schober submitted his own resignation the same day.  Schober Bloc  Schober in Berlin, 1931 On the one hand, the 1929 constitutional reform meant that chancellor and cabinet would no longer be elected by the National Council but appointed by the president. On the other hand, the cabinet still depended on majority support in the National Council to be able to govern effectively. On the third hand, the reform also vested the president with the power to dissolve the National Council, forcing new elections. President Wilhelm Miklas, a Christian Social himself, appointed a cabinet consisting exclusively of Christian Social politicians and Heimwehr chiefs. He installed Vaugoin as Schober's successor and Seipel as his minister of foreign affairs. Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, a Heimwehr leader, became Minister of the Interior. Franz Hueber, another Heimwehr leader and brother in law of Hermann Göring, became minister of justice. Lacking support from either of the Christian Socials' traditional coalition partners – the nationalist Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund – the Vaugoin government was stillborn. Miklas dismissed the legislature and called a snap election for November 9. The Heimwehr, made confident by its easy victory over Schober and intrigued by the successes of the Nazi Party in Germany, now decided to break with the Christian Socials and stand for election as a separate party, the Homeland Bloc (). Instantly, fears of a possible Heimwehr putsch resurged; the country felt that civil war was in the air. People's Party and Landbund united against their common enemy and convinced Schober to serve as the leader of their alliance, which they proceeded to name the Schober Bloc (). The Austrian legislative elections of November 9, 1930 resolved, once again, nothing. Except for the fact that the Heimwehr won a meager eight seats, taking seven of them from the Christian Socials, the composition of the National Council remained virtually unchanged. Thanks to the Heimwehr splitting the Christian Social vote, the Social Democrats were the plurality party again. With no actual majority and no potential coalition partners, the victory was hollow, however. The Vaugoin government, still without majority support, resigned on November 29. Otto Ender, the Christian Social governor of Vorarlberg, swiftly repaired the coalition of Christian Socials, People's Party, and Landbund and was sworn in as the new chancellor on December 4. The Ender government included both Schober, this time as the vice chancellor and acting minister of foreign affairs, and Vaugoin, who resumed his position as minister of the army. The main item on the Ender government's agenda was Austria's economic situation, still deteriorating and utterly desperate by now. In a country of 6.5 million, the number of unemployment working-age adults was approaching 600,000. Only about half of them were receiving unemployment benefits. Heavy industry was shutting down; in industrial cities such as Steyr and Leoben, more than half the population had no remaining income whatsoever. Children went hungry and often literally barefoot. When Julius Curtius, foreign minister of the German Reich, visited Vienna on March 3, 1931, Schober and Curtius negotiated a customs union between the two neighbors. The idea had already been floated in 1917 and then in 1927, and it still made eminent sense for both sides. Austria's manufacturing sector would gain better access to the German market. Germany would gain access to Southeast Europe and would economically encircle both Czechoslovakia and Poland; in the long term, Czechoslovakia and Poland might choose to realign themselves away from France, their preferred partner in 1931, and towards the great power they actually bordered. Both Schober and Curtius knew that the Allies would not permit the union. France in particular would be vehemently opposed; the French were worried that German economic recovery would lead to renewed German military dominance. France, however, was known to be hatching its own plans for European economic unification, to be negotiated under the auspices of the League of Nations. Schober and Curtius hoped they would be able to convince Paris to permit their customs union in the context of these negotiations. They resolved to keep their agreement secret for the time being. When the agreement was leaked, France, as predicted, immediately vetoed it. Germany and Austria considered implementing the customs union anyway, but the sudden implosion of the Creditanstalt in May laid these plans to rest. The Creditanstalt was Austria's largest bank and controlled two thirds of its remaining industry. To prevent the total collapse of its economy, Austria now needed an immediate cash infusion in an amount that the struggling Reich was unable to muster. France agreed to help, on the condition that the customs union be abandoned and that Austria agree to have its finances audited by the League of Nations; Austria would also have to promise to implement whatever restructuring measures the League would subsequently recommend. Ender could not stomach these conditions. He resigned on June 20, handing the reins to Karl Buresch, who could. Schober stayed on, serving in the first Buresch government both as the vice chancellor and as the acting minister of foreign affairs. The enmity of the French he had earned for himself, however, meant that his ability to function as a foreign minister was severely limited now. When his continued presence in the cabinet endangered the issuance of a strategic foreign currency bond, the Buresch government resorted to a sham resignation to remove Schober from office.  Death  Schober died on August 19, 1932. His death was not unexpected. Schober had been suffering from heart disease; his condition had noticeably worsened during his final months. It has been speculated that his end may have been hastened by disappointment and bitterness; Schober believed he had been treated shabbily by his political allies. Schober's death came a mere three weeks after the death of Ignaz Seipel, who had also been struggling with long illness. The coincidence was widely noted. The two former enemies had reconciled during their final days, conveying best wishes to each other \\"from sickbed to sickbed.\\"  Honors  * 1930: Honorary doctorate of technical sciences of the Graz University of Technology * 1930: Honorary doctorate of law of the University of Vienna * 1930: Honorary doctorate of political science of the University of Graz  Citations   References  English  German      Further reading   External links  * Johannes Schober CV on the website of the Austrian Parliament * 1874 births 1932 deaths 20th-century Chancellors of Austria Austrian police officers Chancellors of Austria Finance Ministers of Austria Foreign ministers of Austria Vice-Chancellors of Austria Interpol officials German nationalism in Austria Members of the National Council (Austria) Austrian civil servants 20th-century jurists Austrian jurists University of Vienna alumni People from Perg District ","title":"Johannes Schober"},{"id":"14452224","text":"In enzymology, a sulfate-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :ATP + H2O + sulfateout \\\\rightleftharpoons ADP + phosphate + sulfatein The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and sulfate, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and sulfate.

Originating as a Government research programme, the initiative is now managed by a community forum, the UTMC Development Group, which represents both local transport authorities and the systems industry. UTMC systems are designed to allow the different applications used within modern traffic management systems to communicate and share information with each other. This allows previously disparate data from multiple sources such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras, Variable Message Signs (VMS), car parks, traffic signals, air quality monitoring stations and meteorological data, to be amalgamated into a central console or database. The idea behind UTMC is to maximise road network potential to create a more robust and intelligent system that can be used to meet current and future management requirements. Background and history The UTMC was launched in 1997 by the UK Government's Department for Environment, Transport and the Regions (now the Department for Transport (DfT)). During the first three years, a number of research projects were undertaken to establish and validate an approach based on modular systems and open standards. These have contributed to the UTMC Technical Specifications, which define UTMC standards. * To assist local authorities in gaining the most from Intelligent transportation system and to achieve their transport objectives, the Department for Transport initiated the six-year, £6M UTMC programme in 1997. The first half of the UTMC programme (1997–2000) concentrated on specific applied research tasks, on both technical and operational issues. * In January 2001, the programme embarked on a demonstrator phase to consolidate the results of the earlier research. Full scale demonstrator projects taking a pragmatic UTMC approach were run in Preston with key systems provided by Mott MacDonald, Reading and Stratford- upon-Avon using Siemens and York with systems from Tenet Technology (these systems are now owned and marketed by Dynniq). * Early in 2003, the UTMC Development Group (UDG) was set up, as a group of local authorities and suppliers, with the support of the DfT, to oversee the future development of UTMC. This has managed the initiative continuously since 2004. UTMC has helped local authorities achieve their goals by adopting an appropriate, but not over constraining, set of standards to allow users, suppliers and integrators of UTMC systems to plan and supply systems cost-effectively in an open market. These standards are essential in breaking boundaries and local authority borders to allow network interoperability.  UTMC Activities  Specifications and Standards The UTMC Specifications and Standards Group (S&SG;) is responsible for ensuring that the UTMC technical framework continues to meet local authorities' needs, currently and in the future. The S&SG; oversees the maintenance and upkeep of the UTMC Technical Specifications. Its members are drawn from both local authorities and the supplier community, but it is always led by local authorities. The S&SG; works closely with the full range of UTMC suppliers to ensure its requirements are technically achievable. It operates a transparent consultation regime on all technical changes. From time to time it may commission and fund technical research and standards development activities, though it operates principally through coordinating the input freely provided by suppliers and users. The Specification provides standards for shared data (i.e. data communicated between applications of a UTMC system, or between a UTMC system and an external system) through: *holding definitions of current UTMC Objects, and making them available to users; *receiving submissions for potential new UTMC Objects, and coordinating consultation as necessary; *facilitating contact between Object developers; *advising on changes needed to potential new UTMC Objects; *registering new UTMC Objects. As well as undertaking technical work to develop national specifications, there are a number of activities that help \\"market\\" the initiative to the traffic management community. There is a conference, usually held annually, papers and articles are published in key industry journals and regular workshops are held focusing on key (technical or operational) themes. In 2006, the UTMC community ran a number of special sessions at the ITS World Congress held in London, as well as running a village of suppliers demonstrating UTMC-compatible products. The UTMC initiative formerly published a Products Catalogue, representing products submitted as compliant by suppliers. This was discontinued in December 2014. UTMC specification documents The following documents are maintained and published for open use on the UTMC website. * The UTMC Framework Technical Specification TS003 presents the core technical standards recommended for use by Traffic Managers in their systems. * The UTMC Objects Registry TS004 presents a standardised set of data structures associated with traffic management, in several forms including UML data model, XML schema, SNMP MIBs, some IDL scripts for CORBA based systems, and tabular representation (originally designed for database designers). The current issue of the Technical Specification is available for free download on the UTMC resources website . Examples of UTMC in action Local authorities with UTMC have more control over their road network. Some examples of what they can do are: Advise By monitoring how long it takes a vehicle to pass two ANPR cameras and then dividing the time by the distance between the cameras, an average speed can be measured and used to inform motorists via VMS how long it will take them to reach a destination, or to set diversions. Example by Envitia: VMS in Aberdeen . Example by IDT: Journey time monitoring in Birmingham Warn Wind detectors attached to a bridge give drivers of high sided vehicles warnings before they cross.

Guide By linking parking guidance systems to a common database traffic control room operators can inform motorists via strategic VMS about the current state of car parks; especially useful for special events like carnivals when normal use is exceeded.

Joint Chairs’ Group (JCG) The JCG was created in 2004 to bring together the UDG with other key ITS community organisations; it was later expanded to include representation from the Department for Transport and the Highways Agency. The JCG's aim was to ensure that the strategic direction of the various groups and bodies involved in UK ITS was kept aligned. The JCG was suspended in September 2012, as the prevailing financial conditions had reduced the resource available to its participants. UTMC links with international standards UTMC builds on a base of mainstream internet protocols, and focusses on defining data structures suitable for exchange between ITS systems and devices. At the time of its origination there were few available international standards to build on, and the research was therefore used to generate many of its own standards. However for exchange between central systems (for example, B2B data exchange between neighbouring roads authorities), UTMC refers to the specifications of the European project DATEX. DATEX (as Datex II) is now being standardized through the European standards agency CEN and UTMC has been involved in a number of European standards- related projects, notably POSSE (Promotion of Open Specifications and Standards in Europe). There is a current workstream within UTMC aiming to align the UTMC Technical Specification more closely with Datex II.

Liutprand captured the town in 726, but Pope Zacharias persuaded him to restore it to the Duchy of Rome in 742, after which it remained under pontifical rule. Narni venerates as its first bishop the martyr Juvenalis, who died in the second half of the fourth century; St. Maximus, who was bishop in 425, was succeeded by his two sons Hercules and Pancratius. Gregory the Great refers to the bishop St. Cassius, who died in 558; the same pontiff wrote a letter to the bishop Projectinus which shows that, at Narni, at that time, there were still pagans to be converted. Bishop John (940) was succeeded by his son, who became Pope John XIII; among other bishops were: William, a Franciscan, whom Pope Urban V employed against the Fraticelli (1367); and Raimondo Castelli (1656), founder of the seminary. From 1198 to 1214, Narni was in rebellion against Pope Innocent III, who temporarily suppressed its episcopal see. The churches of this city contain many paintings of the ancient Umbrian school.

Biography Kertes is the lead singer and songwriter of the rock band Ra'ash (רעש). Ra'ash released their debut album Noise Only Noise. N. (רעש רק רעש. ק.) in 1994 to critical acclaim. Kertes wrote and sang most of the songs on the album, although the songs that were written and sung by the second singer Jonnie Shualy gained more popularity. In 1995 Kertes and all of the members of Ra'ash participated in recording of Shualy's first solo album The Thousand and One (האלף ואחד). In 1996 Ra'ash released their second album, \\"Tmimot\\" (תמימות) . All of the album was written and sung by Kertes. The group appeared on the TV and two songs received limited TV and radio play, but the sales were low. In the same year Kertes played in an album by the popular Israeli singer Yael Levi, which Shualy produced. At that time Kertes moved from Tel-Aviv to Ezuz, a small moshav in the Negev desert. In 1998 all members of Ra'ash played on the debut album of Adi Ran (עדי רן), a baal teshuva. The album became popular mostly in the Jewish religious communities. In 2000 Ra'ash released their last album as a band, Ani Ze Lo' Ata (אני זה לא אתה). Singing and songwriting on this record were roughly divided between Kertes and Shualy. The album received positive reviews, but the band went on an indefinite hiatus shortly after its release. In 2001 Ra'ash played their last show as a band at a two-day festival of Nana Disc artists. In 2003 Kertes released his first solo album, Yellow Sea (ים צהוב). Death On January 1, 2018, Kertes died at the age of 53 from lung cancer. He was interred at Yarkon Cemetery.

Blakeslee Natural Area, Monroe County, Pennsylvania. The northern hardwood forest is a general type of North American forest ecosystem found over much of southeastern and south central Canada, Ontario and Quebec, extending south into the United States in northern New England, New York, and Pennsylvania, and west along the Great Lakes to Minnesota and western Ontario. Some ecologists consider it a transitional forest because it contains species common to both the oak-hickory forest community to the south and the Boreal forest community to the north. The trees and shrub species of the Northern Hardwood Forest are known for their brilliant fall colors, making the regions that contain this forest type popular fall foliage tourist destinations. Sugar maple, yellow birch, American beech, and white ash are the common key indicator tree and shrub species in the Northern Hardwood Forest. Other species include eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Herb and heath species include wintergreen, wild sarsaparilla, and wood sorrel. Birds and animals common to the Northern Hardwood Forest include the black-capped chickadee, white-throated sparrow, cedar waxwing, porcupine, snowshoe hare, white-tailed deer, and American Red Squirrel. Most of the Northern Hardwood Forest is not virgin forest, it is regrowth following centuries of commercial timber harvesting and the clearing of land for agricultural purposes. This is particularly true of New England, New York, and Eastern Canada, where the land was cleared to make room for farms in the 17th and 18th centuries and subsequently abandoned in the 19th century when farming interests migrated to the midwestern United States and central Canada. The Northern Hardwood Forest is indigenous to several well-known parks and national forests, including the Boundary Waters region of Minnesota, New York's Adirondack Park, the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire, the Green Mountain National Forest in Vermont, Baxter State Park and Acadia National Park in Maine, and Fundy National Park in New Brunswick. The Berkshires region of western Massachusetts is very typical of a Northern Hardwood Forest ecosystem. Northern hardwood stands are also found in the higher elevations of the southern Blue Ridge Mountains, typically between and , where climatic conditions resemble those in northern states and southern Canada.

The screenplay by Robert Presnell is based on the book Missing Men by former New York City Police Captain John H. Ayers and Carol Bird. Plot Brash detective Butch Saunders is demoted from the robbery division to the bureau of missing persons. Captain Webb, his new boss, is unsure whether Butch will fit in or is on his way out of the police department. Webb assigns Joe Musik to show Butch around. Gradually, Butch earns Webb's respect and trust. Cases the bureau handles include a philandering husband, a child prodigy who yearns to live a normal life, an aging bachelor whose housekeeper has disappeared, and an old lady whose daughter has run away, among others. Hank Slade works doggedly on one particular case - a missing wife - throughout the film, only to discover that she has been working at the bureau the whole time, right under his nose. When attractive Norma Roberts comes looking for her missing Chicago investment banker husband Therme Roberts, Butch takes the case, making no secret that he is attracted to her, even though they are both married. She, however, keeps him at arm's length. Butch is later shocked when Captain Webb tells him that she is really Norma Phillips and the man she claims is missing is actually the person she was on trial for murdering (before escaping) and not her husband at all. When Butch goes to arrest her at her apartment, he finds her hiding in a closet. Norma begs him to send the other policemen away, telling him she can explain everything. However, when he returns alone, she has fled. She fakes her suicide by drowning and disappears, but shows up when Butch stages her funeral with a borrowed corpse. When Butch spots her, she tells him that, as Roberts' personal secretary, she discovered he had a mentally defective, idiotic twin brother, whom he took great pains to hide from everyone. She claims that, facing embezzlement charges, Therme murdered his brother and disappeared. Norma attended the funeral in hopes that he would show up as well. She points a man out. Butch and Norma chase him to his apartment building. Butch tells Norma to remain outside for her safety while he apprehends the man. When he returns, Norma has vanished. The man denies being Roberts, but Butch takes him to the police station. There, to his relief, he finds Norma, who had gone for help. Webb tricks him into admitting he is Therme Roberts, and when Butch learns his gold-digging wife Belle never divorced her first husband (the husband shows up at the bureau looking for her), he and Norma are free to be together.

The film went into general release on September 16. In 1936, the picture was reissued with the opening credits reconfigured to give top billing to Davis, who was by then the studio's leading female star. Bureau of Missing Persons also premiered at the Grauman's Chinese Theatre in California on April 20, 1972. Critical reception Mordaunt Hall, critic for the New York Times, gave the film a generally positive notice and remarked on the fact-based elements: \\"It is quite obvious that fact is the basis of many of the incidents and if several of the characters are too rowdy at times to be lifelike, it does not detract from the general interest of the production.\\" Time said, \\"this is as engrossing as the normal detective cinema, but what gives Bureau of Missing Persons substance and makes it interesting journalism as well as adequate fiction are convincing shots of how a Missing Persons Bureau works\\". Variety called it \\"pretty fair entertainment ... steered clear of over sombreness or becoming too morbid\\" and added, \\"Just when it threatens to become banal, excellent trouping and some inspired dialoguing snap it back into proper gait.\\" The Film Daily review said it was \\"marred by mixed incidents and hoke Hollywood ending\\".

Above the door, the text \\"Gymnasium Augustinianum\\" can still be read. Scholengemeenschap Augustinianum is a secondary school in the municipality of Eindhoven. It offers havo and vwo. History The school first opened on October 3, 1898 by Augustinians in Eindhoven. Back then, the name was Gymnasium Augustinianum, which was changed to Roman Catholic Gymnasium in 1917. In 1928 the school moved to another convent, which broke all contacts with convent Mariënhage. The activities of the school were moved to yet another building during the Second World War while the convent was in hands of the Germans. After the war it was used as a military hospital as well as a building for victims returning from Germany. Meanwhile, the school was allowed to use a part of the building again. The school magazine was first released in 1935, when two other school magazines merged into this new one. It was given the name \\"Primula Veris\\" by Frather Rector Ter Haar:.Joop van 't Hoop and Peter van Overbruggen, Een eeuw Augustinianum: eeuwige jeugd, 1998, pages 60–61 The magazine had not been released for four years until 2008. A winter edition is now put together. Because of the steady growth of pupils the school needed to expand, this was however blocked by other plans of city council and it was decided that a new building would be built. Construction began in April 1958; the same year in which the first pupil from a non-rich environment entered the school. This building is not in use anymore and was demolished in 2019. A new building was erected in 2017. Recent history The school is generally known as a small school, which for many people is a reason to go to the Augustinianum. However, the past few years has seen an increase in student numbers; the school currently counts well over 1000 pupils, whereas in 2000 it only counted around 800. Many of its students participated in the pupil strike in November 2007, ignoring lessons starting after 11:00 AM and going to city hall to protest. Notable students Former Prime Minister Dries Van Agt was educated here. Extra-Curricular activities The school offers several extracurricular activities. The best known is \\"Augpop\\", a program in which groups of pupils are guided by a professional musician to form bands. Some of these bands perform quite well locally and have gained popularity within the school. Every year a night in a local cafe (traditionally Cafe Wilhelmina) is organized in which all bands play in front of an audience.Spetterend Augpop 2006 Another music oriented activity is Aug unplugged, with a focus on non-electrical instruments. This started out as a project called Aug Classical but has since become Aug Unplugged, referencing the use of only classical instruments.Aug Unplugged References External links *Website of Augustinianum. *information about the school's quality Educational institutions established in 1898 Christian schools in the Netherlands Secondary schools in the Netherlands Schools in Eindhoven ","title":"Scholengemeenschap Augustinianum"},{"id":"14452416","text":"The Synod of Cashel of 1172, also known as the Second Synod of Cashel,The first being the Synod held at Cashel in 1101 was assembled at Cashel at the request of Henry II of England shortly after his arrival in Ireland in October 1171.

McCormick described the Synod as one of the most important events of this period of Irish history.McCormick (1889), p. 31 The Synod is not mentioned in Irish sources, so historians have had to rely on other sources,Holland (2005) in particular Giraldus Cambrensis' (Gerald of Wales) account in Expugnatio Hibernicae (Conquest of Ireland). In his account of the Synod he lists the \\"constitutions\\" of the synods, \\"verbatim, as they were published\\".Giraldus, Conquest of Ireland, Chapter XXXIII, p. 36 The meeting of the Synod Upon his arrival in Ireland, Henry went to Lismore. This was the see of Gilla Críst Ua Connairche (Christianus), who was native papal legate to Ireland. Henry also visited Cashel and Dublin, and thus had the opportunity to meet the archbishops Donnchad Ua hUallacháin of Cashel and Lawrence O'Toole of Dublin. According to Martin Holland, arrangements for a synod to meet at Cashel soon afterwards were put in place through these contacts. Giraldus lists these three bishops, as well as Cadla Ua Dubthaig, Archbishop of Tuamnamed as \\"Catholicus Tuotuenensis archiepisopi\\" (Expugnatio, XXXIV) among the clergy of Ireland attending the synod, \\"with their suffragans and fellow-bishops, together with the abbots, archdeacons, priors, and deans, and many other Irish prelates\\".Giraldus, Conquest of Ireland, Chapter XXXIV, pp. 36-37 Gilla Meic Liac mac Diarmata (Gelasius), Archbishop of Armagh and Primate of Ireland, did not attend. According to McCormick he refused to attend.McCormick (1889), p. 54 Giraldus relates that his absence was due to \\"infirmities and advanced age\\", and that he afterwards came to Dublin to give his assent \\"to the royal will in all these matters\\". Acts of the Synod Giraldus lists seven acts or \\"constitutions\\" of the Synod, here given in the translation of William Gouan Todd:For a different translation, see The Conquest of Ireland, chapter XIV. For the Latin text see Topographia hibernica, et Expugnatio hibernica.Todd, chapter XII I That the faithful throughout Ireland do contract and observe lawful marriages rejecting those with their relations either by consanguinity or affinity. II That infants be catechised before the door of the church and baptised in the holy font in the baptismal churches. III That all the faithful do pay the tithe of animals corn and other produce to the church of which they are parishioners. IV That all ecclesiastical lands and property connected with them be quite exempt from the exactions of all laymen. And especially that neither the petty kings nor counts nor any powerful men in Ireland nor their sons with their families do exact, as was usual, victuals and hospitality or entertainments in the ecclesiastical districts or presume to extort them by force and that the detestable food or contributions, which used to be required four times in the year from the farms belonging to churches by the neighbouring counts, shall not be claimed any more. V That in case of a murder committed by laymen and of their compounding for it with their enemies clergymen their relatives are not to pay part of the fine (or erick) but that as they were not concerned in the perpetration of the murder so they are to be exempted from the payment of money. VI That all the faithful lying in sickness do in the presence of their confessor and neighbours make their will with due solemnity dividing in case they have wives and children excepting their debts and servants wages their moveable goods into three parts and bequeathing one for the children and another for the lawful wife and the third for the funeral obsequies. And if haply they have no lawful progeny, let the goods be divided into two parts between himself and his wife. And if his lawful wife be dead, let them be divided between himself and his children. VII That to those who die with a good confession due respect be paid by means of masses and wakes and a decent burial. Likewise that all divine matters be henceforth conducted agreeably to the practices of the holy Church according as observed by the Anglican Church. The seventh act Giraldus lists these seven acts numbered as primo, secundus, etc. until septimus, as related in Todd's translation above. The last part of the seventh act concerns the relationship between the Anglican and the Irish Church. According to Marie Therese Flanagan,Flanagan (1977), p. 57 > some historians have interpreted this as an actual decree of the synod, and > have seen in it the origins of a policy of anglicisation of the Irish church > pursued by the Angevin kings in Ireland. Thus, the synod of Cashel is often > the starting point of any account of episcopal appointments in Ireland after > the coming of the Normans and the extension of the electoral procedure of > the English church to the Irish church is presumed to derive in principle > from this decree. Flanagan, however, points out that, as it stands in Giraldus' account, this sentence refers only to the liturgical practices of the English church. She also questions whether this part is a part of the decrees of the synod, stating that \\"it appears to be rather Gerald's own comment on what would be attempted by Irish churchmen. Martin Holland does not include this part in his overview of the enacted decrees, but adds: > It was also decided that in Ireland, all matters relating to religion were > to follow the observances of the English church. Some have interpreted this > as referring to liturgical practices only; others see it as encompassing > more, and therefore being much more fundamental, especially since it is > claimed that the Irish bishops swore fealty to Henry at around this time.

It was typically used by professional traders and financial analysts in trading rooms. It was superseded by the Eikon platform, first released in 2010. 3000 Xtra provided real-time market data such as price data on exchange traded stocks, warrants, options, futures, indices, bonds, commodities and currencies, as well as streaming news and comprehensive economic indicators and financial data. Originally designed as an information system, later versions also introduced trading functions, allowing orders to be placed on a number of electronic exchanges and with other dealing desks. The client software connected to Reuters hardware at the client's premises, which combined multiple connections to the Reuters networks over redundant, fault-tolerant dedicated links, often private T1s. This was provided on-site via a proprietary and often redundant hardware installation, such as Reuters Market Data System (RMDS) or Triarch. One of the early attractions for dealers was the integration with Microsoft Excel and the instant messaging facility for sending messages to other dealing desks. The flexible Kobra client software allowed for a variety of real-time and historic market data visualizations and custom analytics. In addition, it could provide real-time Reuters headlines and news. It went on to become the de facto platform on traders' desks in banks and financial institutions due to the breadth of the information available, despite the significant cost and dedicated infrastructure required. Its main rival was the Bloomberg Terminal, although in many cases both systems were used. History Quote screen showing details for the stock HSBC on Hong Kong exchange The 3000 Xtra system was first released in 1999, but in many ways was a continuation of previous Reuters products that included Equities 2000 (released in 1987), Dealing 2000-2 (released in 1992), 3000 Series (released in 1996) and \\"Advanced Reuters Terminal\\" (released in 1986). It inherited a lot of design features such as much of the user interface from those earlier systems that were developed in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Thomson Reuters began decommissioning Reuters 3000 Xtra in 2013, replacing it by the newer Thomson Reuters Eikon platform. Architecture The system was designed to use private network links to Reuters to get live prices from global stock, commodity, futures, derivative and bond markets as well as foreign exchange price makers. The client terminal would connect to a local Unix server typically hosted on site by the financial institution. The server would have dedicated links back to Reuters global network. The client software was a Windows-based application. Live connection to Excel spreadsheets was provided via the Reuters Power Plus Pro utility. The system was enhanced through a number of different versions over the years. From version 5 onwards, it was qualified for Citrix thin client delivery, which became a common way to access the software.

An account manager maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The account manager does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the client of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one account manager throughout the duration of hiring the company. Account managers serve as the interface between the customer service and the sales team in a company. They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The account manager serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result. Key accounts provide the most business because they contain a small number of clients which contribute a large portion of the company's sales. According to research, sales from a company's key accounts have increased from 23% in 1975 to 60% currently. Responsibilities The responsibilities of an account manager can vary depending on the industry they work in, size of the company and nature of the business. Each customer account can vary in demands and an account manager may work with brand managers for one account and a media department for another. Account managers usually report directly to the account director or agency director of the activity and status of accounts and transactions. An account manager may also manage a single account or a variety of accounts depending on the requirement of the company. Although the responsibility can vary between companies and between accounts, there are a shared set of common responsibilities which are as follows: # Generate sales for a portfolio of accounts and reach the company's sales target # Identify new sales opportunities within existing accounts to retain a client-account manager relationship by up-selling and cross-selling # Manage and solve conflicts with clients The Account Manager is expected to have specific information regarding daily operations of the Company and keep the Client updated. # Interact and coordinate with the sales team and other staff members in other departments working on the same account # Establish budgets with the client and company # Meet time deadlines for accounts There are situations in which an account manager, for example in advertising firms, is responsible for more than one account and therefore looks after multiple clients. When account locations do not overlap the account manager can be placed at the divisional, district, or territory level. When a sales team has a senior sales manager, the account manager coordinates sales accounts from other departments or specialties. In this scenario, the sales team will work under the direct supervision of influencers and deciders instead of with a buyer. * Global account managers: Manage company accounts worldwide. This typically occurs in large companies with international accounts. * National account managers: Manage numerous accounts nationwide. This typically occurs in medium to large companies when a company has multiple locations across the country. Global account managers and national account managers may work together in a hierarchical or matrix structure. The trend is to move responsibility for the major key accounts to the global level. Key account manager Key account manager is assigned to a company headquarters to oversee the account team assigned to a particular account. Key account management includes sales but also includes planning and managing the full relationship between a business and its most important customers. An account manager who works in this role will engage in a variety of tasks including project management, coordination, strategic planning, relationship management, negotiation, leadership and innovative development of opportunities, and keeping record of transaction of sale and purchase goods. The tasks may include working with product design and application, logistics, sales support, and marketing. Key account management models The basic assumption for a key account management model is the correct classification of the key accounts. A basic model often used in the period of 1950-1970 was the classification model of Webster. This model has been adapted by Milman and Wilson into a two-dimensional model and was paramount in the period of 1970-1990. Bensaou has tested this model empirically by his research of carmakers in the United States and Japan and made revisions. De Blick synthesized the adaptations into the 4S-model, a key account classification model. By the late 1990s, key account management spread to most B2B (business- to-business) models. Work environment Account managers can work for small or large companies either corporate, financial, retail, or government for instance. Any company with a specific clients they conduct business with, can employ an account manager. Typical employers can be: #Direct marketing consultancies and agencies #Marketing departments #Major commercial organizations Account managers usually work in an office setting and can work more than 40 hours weekly. Travel is usually included in the job description. National or global account managers will very likely experience extra travel. Qualifications Although personality and an aptitude for sales is key, a degree in business, marketing, or related field is typically required and depending on the nature of the account, a background in marketing or media studies may be preferred. Due to each company having different requirements, it is important to obtain information from each potential company of employment.

The name relates to both white (Greco bianco) and black (Greco nero) grape varieties. While there is more land area dedicated to Greco nero, the Greco bianco is the grape most commonly referred to by \\"Greco\\". In the Campania region it is used to produce the Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) wine Greco di Tufo. In Calabria, it is used to make the Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wine Greco di Bianco. The name \\"Greco\\" is sometimes used as a synonym for several varieties of supposed Greek origins-most notably Trebbiano.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Wine Course Third Edition pg 112 Abbeville Press 2003 History During the Greek colonization of southern Italy, Greek settlers brought with them new grape varieties, perhaps including the ancestor vine of Greco. The ancestor of the Greco vine may have been brought to southern Italy more than 2,500 years ago by ancient Greek settlers. Historians and Italian growers have speculated that the grape may have been a blending component in the ancient Roman \\"cult wines\\" of Falernian and Aminean.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 242 Mitchell Beazley 1986 R. Garr \\"Greco di Tufo\\" 30 Second Wine Advisor April 24, 2002 As the grape vine has propagated throughout Italy, the name \\"Greco\\" has been ascribed to several varieties that may have historically been linked to Greece. Ampelographers disagree about whether or Greco is a single variety with several clones or an agglomeration of several varieties under the umbrella name of \\"Greco\\". There is also disagreement about whether any of the Italian so-called \\"Greek vines\\" are currently being cultivated in Greece.Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 112 Harcourt Books 2001 After World War II, the fate of Greco as well as that of many southern Italian grape varieties were in peril. The wartime devastation of vineyards as well as the mass migration of Italian vine growers from agriculture to urban industries in the cities and abroad, ushered in a period of general decline for viticulture in the region. As plantings declined and vineyards were ripped up, many varieties were on the verge of extinction. The efforts of family winemakers and heritage winemaking projects such as the Villa dei Misteri project headed by Piero Mastroberardino, helped sustain the existence of the Greco vine in southern Italy.G. Harding \\"A Wine Miscellany\\" pg 24, Clarkson Potter Publishing, New York 2005 Recent discoveries In the early 21st century, DNA profiling confirmed that some plantings in Italy described as \\"Greco\\" are genetically identical to the grape variety Asprinio.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 326 Oxford University Press 2006 Greco bianco The Campania region of Italy where the Greco di Tufo DOCG is produced The Greco bianco vine tends to mature very late in the grapevine's growing season and is prone to the viticultural hazards of downy and powdery mildew. Ampelographers distinguish the vine based on its characteristic \\"winged\\" clusters. After veraison the grapes turn a golden-grey color. The phenolic compounds in the grape contribute to the wine's characteristically deep color. Greco bianco wines are noted for their aromatic qualities with some wine experts, such as Jancis Robinson, describing the wines as being vaguely similar to Viognier. Some aromas commonly associated with the grape include peaches and fresh green foliage. With age, Greco wines can develop more herbal notes. Greco bianco is most widely found in southern Italy where it is featured in several DOCs. In 2006, it numbered less than 1,000 hectares (2,500 acres) of the varieties planted. In Calabria, a specific clone of Greco bianco is used to produce the sweet dessert wine Greco di Bianco, made in a partial passito style from grapes that have been partially dried after harvest. On the island of Capri, Greco is usually blended with Biancolella and Falanghina to produce dry-style wines. In Apulia, it is a permitted blend component in the Gravina DOC. In Campania, it is featured in the DOCG wine of Greco di Tufo produced around the town of Tufo, Provincia di Avellino. It is also permitted in Lacryma Christi produced on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius. DOCG regions There are two DOCG regions that Greco plays a primary role in; however, the grape variety is a permitted component in several DOCs in southern Italy. The Greco di Tufo DOCG region of Campania is located north of the Fiano di Avellino DOCG and includes the town of Tufo and seven other hillside communities. The region was elevated to a DOCG in 2003. Despite being a third of the size of the Fiano di Avellino DOCG, Greco di Tufo is the Campania region's largest producer of DOC quality wine. The vineyard soils of the region are derived from tuff, a rock formed from volcanic ash—after which the town of Tufo itself is named. All DOCG wines from the region must contain at least 85% Greco with Coda di Volpe usually filling in the remaining blend. According to Master of Wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Greco di Tufo wines are usually ready to drink 3–4 years after harvest and have the aging potential to continue to develop well for 10–12 years.M. Ewing-Mulligan & E. McCarthy Italian Wines for Dummies pg 209-210, 230 Hungry Minds 2001 A sparkling spumante style is also permitted.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 128-216 Firefly Books 2004 The Greco di Bianco DOC region of Calabria is located around the city of Bianco in the \\"toe\\" of Italy on the Ionian coast. This is a dessert-style wine made from partially dried grapes that must maintain a minimum alcohol level of 17%. The wine has a characteristically dark amber color with aromas of citrus and herbal notes. Harvest yields are restricted to a maximum of 10 tonnes per hectare. According to wine expert Peter Saunders, Greco di Bianco is often described as one of the best Italian dessert wines produced in the country. Greco is often blended with Malvasia (pictured). Other DOCs that are permitted to use Greco bianco include: *Bivongi DOC - Calabrian wine region located along the Stilaro river on the slopes of Mount Consolino. For the white wine of Bivongi, Greco can make up to 30-50% of the blend along with Guardavalle, Montonico, Malvasia bianca and Ansonica. *Capri DOC - Campanian wine region located on the island of Capri. Greco is permitted to make up to 50% of the white blend along with Falanghina and Biancolella. *Cilento DOC - Campanian wine region located in Cilento of the province of Salerno. Greco is permitted to make 10-15% of the white blend along with Fiano, Trebbiano and Malvasia Bianca. *Ciro DOC - Calabrian wine region located in the province of Catanzaro. Greco can be used as a small component (no more than 5%) in the red wine blend of Ciro along with Trebbiano in this predominately Gaglioppo wine. The inclusion of the white grapes in this red shares some of the purpose and history behind the inclusion of white wine grapes in the red wines of Chianti. *Fiano di Avellino DOCG - Campanian wine region recently promoted to DOCG in 2003. Greco is permitted to make up 15% of this blend along with Fiano, Trebbiano and Coda di Volpe. *Gravina DOC - Apulian wine region located around the town of Gravina. Greco is permitted to make up to 35-60% of the blend along with Malvasia, Bianco d'Alessano, Bombino bianco, Trebbiano and Verdeca. *Melissa DOC - Calabrian DOC around the city of Melissa. The region names is derived from the Greek word for \\"sweet\\" which is used to describe the high level of ripe sugars that wine grapes can achieve in this wine climate region. Both Greco nero and Greco bianco are permitted in the red wine of this DOC from 5-25%. In the white blend, Greco makes up 80-05% along with Trebbiano and Malvasia bianca. *Molise DOC - This large DOC covers the entire mountainous Molise region located south of Abruzzi. The region attained DOC status in 1998 and is one of the few Italian regions that are permitted to have varietally labeled wines of which Greco bianco is permitted provided it is responsible for at least 85% of the wine. *Penisola Sorrentina DOC - Campanian wine region based on the Sorrento Peninsula. Greco is permitted to make up to 60% of the white blend of this DOC along with Falanghina and Biancolella. *Sannio DOC - Campanian wine region located in the hill center of the region that overlaps partially with the historical grape-growing region of Samnium. Here Greco is used for both still wines and a Spumante style wine produced with the classical method of sparkling wine production.

For example, the letter designation for the year 2002 for the Zuma was the letter P, so a Zuma manufactured in 2002 would have the designation YW50P. However, Yamaha made some changes to the model during its year run, so some Zumas manufactured in 2002 have the model code YW50AP to distinguish them from the YW50P model. All YW50P Zumas are identical in construction design to all other YW50P Zumas but will differ (in this particular instance, only slightly) from a YW50AP. Yamaha did not use the letter Q, and the letter for 2003 is the letter R (there was only one model for this year, the YW50R). For 2004, the letter S (the YW50S model). In 2008, assigned the letter X, Yamaha had two models: the YW50XL and the YW50XB, and so on. In 2011 the numbering system moved to the letter A (YW125AB for the 125 CC model and YW50AL for the 49 CC model). The Zuma has a 14 mm Teikei carburetor with automatic choke, reed-valve induction, a fan-assisted cooling system, an autolube oil-injection system with an indicator light located on instrument panel which alerts rider when oil level gets low, and electric starting with backup kick start. It also has five spoke-cast wheels with low-profile 120/90-10 front and 130/90-10 rear tires. The front fork has of travel, and rear shock has of travel. The scooter also has 155 mm hydraulic front disc brakes and rear drum brakes. (Models until 1998 had front drum brake instead of a hydraulic one.) The dual seat contains a storage compartment adequate for a single full-face helmet. The rear cargo rack can be used for additional carrying capacity but requires the use of ropes or bungee cords to secure any load. This rack can also function as passenger grabrails. The Zuma has \\"Bug-eyed\\" dual headlights that come with one light wired to low beam and the other wired to high beam (both lamps have filaments for high and low beam functions, however, and many users install an inexpensive and simple wiring modification to make both headlamps light with both the high and low beams). The instrument panel has turn signal indicators, a high beam indicator, a low-oil indicator, a speedometer, a gas level gauge, and an odometer. Yahama specifies that the Zuma can safely carry up to of passengers and cargo. Yamaha took the Zuma off the market in the U.S. in 2006 and 2007, and then reintroduced the model in 2008–2011. The models from 2008–2011 have a slightly higher gear ratio that helps compensate (at the expense of a little less power on take-off).

Trk receptors affect neuronal survival and differentiation through several signaling cascades. However, the activation of these receptors also has significant effects on functional properties of neurons. The common ligands of trk receptors are neurotrophins, a family of growth factors critical to the functioning of the nervous system. The binding of these molecules is highly specific. Each type of neurotrophin has different binding affinity toward its corresponding Trk receptor. The activation of Trk receptors by neurotrophin binding may lead to activation of signal cascades resulting in promoting survival and other functional regulation of cells. Origin of the name trk The abbreviation trk (often pronounced 'track') stands for tropomyosin receptor kinase or tyrosine receptor kinase (and not \\"tyrosine kinase receptor\\" nor \\"tropomyosin- related kinase\\", as has been commonly mistaken). The family of Trk receptors is named for the oncogene trk, whose identification led to the discovery of its first member, TrkA. Trk, initially identified in a colon carcinoma, is frequently (25%) activated in thyroid papillary carcinomas. The oncogene was generated by a mutation in chromosome 1 that resulted in the fusion of the first seven exons of tropomyosin to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of the then-unknown TrkA receptor. Normal Trk receptors do not contain amino acid or DNA sequences related to tropomyosin. Types and corresponding ligands The three most common types of trk receptors are trkA, trkB, and trkC. Each of these receptor types has different binding affinity to certain types of neurotrophins. The differences in the signaling initiated by these distinct types of receptors are important for generating diverse biological responses. Neurotrophin ligands of Trk receptors are processed ligands, meaning that they are synthesized in immature forms and then transformed by protease cleavage. Immature neurotrophins are specific only to one common p75NTR receptor. However, protease cleavage generates neurotrophins that have higher affinity to their corresponding Trk receptors. These processed neurotrophins can still bind to p75NTR, but at a much lower affinity. TrkA TrkA has the highest affinity to the binding nerve growth factor (NGF). NGF is important in both local and nuclear actions, regulating growth cones, motility, and expression of genes encoding the biosynthesis of enzymes for neurotransmitters. Peptidergic nociceptive sensory neurons express mostly trkA and not trkB or trkC. TrkB TrkB has the highest affinity to the binding of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and NT-4. BDNF is a growth factor that has important roles in the survival and function of neurons in the central nervous system. The binding of BDNF to TrkB receptor causes many intracellular cascades to be activated, which regulate neuronal development and plasticity, long-term potentiation, and apoptosis.Chen, Z; Simon, MT & Perry, RT et al. (2007), Genetic Association of Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor Type 2 (NTRK2) With Alzheimer's Disease., vol. 67 issue: 1., Birmingham, Alabama.: Wiley-Liss. Although both BDNF and NT-4 have high specificity to TrkB, they are not interchangeable. In a mouse model study where BDNF expression was replaced by NT-4, the mouse with NT4 expression appeared to be smaller and exhibited decreased fertility. Recently, studies have also indicated that TrkB receptor is associated with Alzheimer's disease. TrkC TrkC is ordinarily activated by binding with NT-3 and has little activation by other ligands. (TrkA and TrkB also bind NT-3, but to a lesser extent.) TrkC is mostly expressed by proprioceptive sensory neurons. The axons of these proprioceptive sensory neurons are much thicker than those of nociceptive sensory neurons, which express trkA. Regulation by p75NTR p75NTR (p75 neurotrophin receptor) affects the binding affinity and specificity of Trk receptor activation by neurotrophins. The presence of p75NTR is especially important in increasing the binding affinity of NGF to TrkA. Although the dissociation constants of p75NTR and TrkA are remarkably similar, their kinetics are quite different. Reduction and mutation of cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of either TrkA or p75NTR prevent the formation of high-affinity binding sites on TrkA. However, the binding of ligands in p75NTR is not required to promote high-affinity binding. Therefore, the data suggest that the presence of p75NTR affects the conformation of TrkA, preferentially the state with high-affinity binding site for NGF. Surprisingly, although the presence of p75NTR is essential to promote high- affinity binding, the NT3 binding to the receptor is not required. Apart from affecting the affinity and specificity for Trk receptors, the P75 neurotrophin receptor (P75NTR) can also reduce ligand-induced receptor ubiquitination, and delay receptor internalization and degradation. Essential roles in differentiation and function Precursor cell survival and proliferation Numerous studies, both in vivo and in vitro, have shown that neurotrophins have proliferation and differentiation effects on CNS neuro-epithelial precursors, neural crest cells, or precursors of the enteric nervous system. TrkA that expresses NGF not only increase the survival of both C and A delta classes of nocireceptor neurons, but also affect the functional properties of these neurons.4 As mentioned before, BDNF improves the survival and function of neurons in CNS, particularly cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, as well as neurons in the hippocampus and cortex.. BDNF belongs to the neurotrophin family of growth factors and affects the survival and function of neurons in the central nervous system, particularly in brain regions susceptible to degeneration in AD. BDNF improves survival of cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, as well as neurons in the hippocampus and cortex. TrkC that expresses NT3 has been shown to promote proliferation and survival of cultured neural crest cells, oligodendrocyte precursors, and differentiation of hippocampal neuron precursors. Control of target innervation Each of the neurotrophins mentioned above promotes neurite outgrowth. NGF/TrkA signaling regulates the advance of sympathetic neuron growth cones; even when neurons received adequate trophic (sustaining and nourishing) support, one experiment showed they did not grow into relating compartments without NGF. NGF increases the innervation of tissues that receive sympathetic or sensory innervation and induces aberrant innervation in tissues that are normally not innervated. NGF/TrkA signaling upregulates BDNF, which is transported to both peripheral and central terminals of nocireceptive sensory neurons. In the periphery, TrkB/BDNF binding and TrkB/NT-4 binding acutely sensitizing nocireceptive pathway that require the presence of mast cells. Sensory neuron function Trk receptors and their ligands (neurotrophins) also affect neurons' functional properties. Both NT-3 and BDNF are important in the regulation and development of synapses formed between afferent neurons and motor neurons. Increased NT-3/trkC binding results in larger monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and reduced polysynaptic components. On the other hand, increased NT-3 binding to trkB to BDNF has the opposite effect, reducing the size of monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and increasing polysynaptic signaling. Formation of ocular dominance column In the development of mammalian visual system, axons from each eyes crosses through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and terminate in separate layers of striate cortex. However, axons from each LGN can only be driven by one side of the eye, but not both together. These axons that terminate in layer IV of the striate cortex result in ocular dominance columns. A study shows that The density of innervating axons in layer IV from LGN can be increased by exogenous BDNF and reduced by a scavenger of endogenous BDNF. Therefore, it raises the possibility that both of these agents are involved in some sorting mechanism that is not well comprehended yet. Previous studies with cat model has shown that monocular deprivation occurs when input to one of the mammalian eyes is absent during the critical period (critical window). However, A study demonstrated that the infusion of NT-4 (a ligand of trkB) into the visual cortex during the critical period has been shown to prevent many consequences of monocular deprivation. Surprisingly, even after losing responses during the critical period, the infusion of NT-4 has been shown to be able to restore them. Synaptic strength and plasticity In mammalian hippocampus, the axons of the CA3 pyramidal cells project into CA1 cells through the Schaffer collaterals. The long-term potentiation (LTP) may induce in either of these pathways, but it is specific only to the one that is stimulated with tetanus. The stimulated axon does not impact spill over to the other pathway. TrkB receptors are expressed in most of these hippocampal neurons, including dentate granule cells, CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells, and inhibitory interneurons. LTP can be greatly reduced by BDNF mutants. In a similar study on a mouse mutant with reduced expression of trkB receptors, LTP of CA1 cells reduced significantly. TrkB loss has also been linked to interfere with the memory acquisition and consolidation in many learning paradigm. Role of Trk oncogenes in cancer Although originally identified as an oncogenic fusion in 1982, only recently has there been a renewed interest in the Trk family as it relates to its role in human cancers because of the identification of NTRK1 (TrkA), NTRK2 (TrkB) and NTRK3 (TrkC) gene fusions and other oncogenic alterations in a number of tumor types. A number of Trk inhibitors are (in 2015) in clinical trials and have shown early promise in shrinking human tumors.  Trk inhibitors in development  Entrectinib (formerly RXDX-101, trade name Rozlytrek) is an investigational drug developed by Ignyta, Inc., which has potential antitumor activity. It is a selective pan-trk receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeting gene fusions in trkA, trkB, and trkC (coded by NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes) that is currently in phase 2 clinical testing. Originally targeting soft tissue sarcomas, Larotrectinib (tradename Vitrakvi) was approved in November 2018 as a tissue-agnostic inhibitor of TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC developed by Array BioPharma for solid tumors with NTRK fusion mutations. Activation pathway Trk receptors dimerize in response to ligand, as do other tyrosine kinase receptors. These dimers phosphorylate each other and enhance catalytic activity of the kinase. Trk receptors affect neuronal growth and differentiation through the activation of different signaling cascades. The three known pathways are PLC, Ras/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) pathways. These pathways involve the interception of nuclear and mitochondrial cell-death programs. These signaling cascades eventually led to the activation of a transcription factor, CREB (cAMP response element-binding), which in turn activate the target genes. PKC pathways The binding of neurotrophin will lead to the phosphorylation of phospholipase C (PLC) by trk receptor. This phosphorylation of PLC induces an enzyme to catalyze the breakdown of lipids to diacyglycerol and inositol(1,4, 5). Diacyglycerol may indirectly activate PI3 kinase or several protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, whereas inositol(1,4, 5) promotes release of calcium from intracellular stores. Ras/MAPK pathway The signaling through Ras/MAPK pathway is important for the neurotrophin-induced differentiation of neuronal and neuroblastoma cells. Phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the Trk receptors led to the activation of Ras molecules, H-Ras and K-Ras. H-ras is found in lipid rafts, embedded within the plasma membrane, while K-Ras is predominantly found in disordered region of the membrane. RAP, a vesicle bounded molecule that also takes part in the cascading, is localized in the intracellular region. The activation of these molecules result in two alternative MAP kinase pathways. Erk 1,2 can be stimulated through the activation cascades of K-Ras, Raf1, and MEK 1,2, whereas ERK5 is stimulated through the activation cascades of B-Raf, MEK5, and Erk 5. However, whether PKC (protein kinase C) could activate MEK5 is not yet known. PI3 pathway PI3 pathway signaling is critical for both mediation of neurotrophin-induced survival and regulation of vesicular trafficking. The trk receptor stimulates PI3K heterodimers, which causes the activation of kinases PDK-1 and Akt. Akt in turn stimulates FRK (Forkhead family transcription factor), BAD, and GSK-3. TrkA vs TrkC Some studies have suggested that NGF/TrkA coupling causes preferential activation of the Ras/MAPK pathway, whereas NT3/TrkC coupling causes preferential activation of the PI3 pathway.

It is located east of Highway 11, between Matheson and Iroquois Falls. For many years the community was accessible by train. The Ontario Northland Railway's Northlander from Toronto to Cochrane, which passed through Val Gagné, made its final passenger run in 2012. An Ontario Northland bus now stops at Val Gagné. Previously called \\"Nushka\\", the settlement was completely destroyed in the Great Fire of 1916, which burned more than of forest. The town was rebuilt and renamed \\"Val Gagné\\", for Wilfrid \\"Little Father\\" Gagné, a Catholic priest who died trying to rescue his parishioners from the fire. History The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway constructed a line through the area between 1906 and 1909. Shortly after, a Catholic clergyman named Bourassa began settling families from the nearby province of Quebec, at two locations along line, Ramore and Nushka (now Val Gagné). Under the auspices of the church, the settlers established farms around Nushka. In 1911, the Church of the Immaculate Conception was founded in Nushka, along with a school. A post office, \\"Nushka Station\\", opened that same year. The early settlement had a creamery, a store, about 20 frame houses, and a temporary railway station made of a boxcar fitted with a platform. The influence of the church made Nushka \\"something of a spiritual centre...more of an extension of northern Quebec than of Ontario\\". The Great Fire of 1916 The railway in Nushka shortly after the fire, where at least 35 bodies were found On July 29, 1916--at around the same time a large forest fire was reaching Nushka--the settlement's priest, Wilfred Gagné, was arriving in Nushka by train following a clerical retreat. Gagné had been priest in Nushka for just a month, and lived above Nushka's store. As heavy smoke filled the air, the train's conductor advised Gagné not to leave the safety of the train. Gagné instead entered Nushka and led 35 people to the railway line. He then returned to the burning town to save 28 others. Within a few hours both groups had burned to death or been suffocated, the lone survivor a man who used moist clay to filter the smoke. Nushka was completely destroyed. Of the town's inhabitants, only eight were left after the fire. When Nushka rebuilt, it was renamed in Gagné's honour, and a monument dedicated to Gagné was erected in the Val Gagné Cemetery. Later history The Val Gagné post office closed in 1980. The Church of the Immaculate Conception continues to function in Val Gagné. Val Gagné has an outdoor skating rink, a ball park, a community hall, a senior's housing facility, a fire department, and a Caisse Populaire credit union. The township of Black River-Matheson operates a bi-monthly transportation service to take Val Gagné residents shopping in Timmins.

This specific site either may be originally built without any intention of serving theatrical purposes (for example, in a hotel, courtyard, or converted building), or may simply be considered an unconventional theatre space (for example, in a forest). A performance in a traditional theatre venue, which has been transformed to resemble a specific space (for example, a junkyard), can also be considered as site-specific, in as it doesn't have the functionality (i.e. seats, stages) that a traditional theatre would have. Site-specific theatre is commonly more interactive than conventional theatre and, with the expectation of audience members predominantly to walk or move about (rather than sit), may be called promenade theatre. Site-specific theatre frequently takes place in structures originally built for non- theatrical reasons that have since been renovated or converted for new, performance-based functions. Definitions of site-specific theatre are complicated by its use in both theatre studies and visual art, where it is also referred to as site-specific performance.  Examples  Examples of site-specific theatre include Ferry Play,Ferry Play a podplay for the Staten Island Ferry in New York City, Psycho-So-Matic, and Downsize, staged by Chicago's Walkabout Theater in a laundromat and a series of public restrooms, respectively; Girls Just Wanna Have Fund$, staged by Women's Project in the lobbies, escalators, and bridges of New York's World Financial Center; Supernatural Chicago, staged in an allegedly haunted nightclub, and Small Metal Objects, staged by Australia's Back To Back Theater at the Whitehall Ferry Terminal. Another example of this form is the Ramlila, dramatic enactment of Hindu epic, Ramayana, started in 1830 by Maharaja Udit Narayan Singh of Varanasi. It is held each year over the period of 31 days, during autumn festive season of Dussehra at Ramnagar, Varanasi in India, and is staged in permanent structures created as sets throughout the three square mile area, where the audience follow the actors. Ramlila has been declared by the UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity in 2005.Ramlila - the Traditional Performance of the Ramayana UNESCO.A Maharajah´s Festival for Body and Soul New York Times, Monday, March 30, 2009. Site-specific theatre can also include environmental theatre: a production that attempts to immerse the audience in the performance by bringing the action off the stage area. For example, some acting may happen in aisles. In the case of a black box theater, acting platforms may even be built between audience section. Sometimes a performer will talk to, or otherwise involve an audience member in a scene. This can be a real audience member, as in interactive theater, or an actor planted to appear as an audience member. There are variations on site-specific theatre, including: *Found space, in which a pre-existing production is placed in an environment similar to the one in which the play is set (for example, performing Hamlet in a Danish Castle). *Promenade theatre, in which audience members generally stand and walk about rather than sit, watching the action happening among them and even following the performers around the performance space. Additional examples of Site- Specific Theatre and Immersive theatre are the following: Ragtime On Ellis Island - A \\"developmental concert\\" of the musical was presented on Ellis Island on August 8, 2016. The concert is directed by Sammi Cannold, and featured Brian Stokes Mitchell as the narrator, Laura Michelle Kelly as Mother, Andy Mientus as Younger Brother, Brandon Victor Dixon as Coalhouse Walker Jr., Michael Park as Father, Shaina Taub as Emma Goldman, Aisha Jackson as Sarah and Robert Petkoff reprising his 2009 Broadway revival role of Tateh. Sweeney Todd - The Tooting Arts Club production transferred to Off-Broadway, transforming the Barrow Street Theatre into a working re-creation of Harrington's pie shop. This is an example of immersive theatre as they are building a pre-existing space, it is not considered a found space. Little Shop of Horrors - A production of the musical will be presented at Bool's Flower Shop in Ithaca, New York on April 24, 2019. The production is produced by Jacob Stuckelman and features local Ithaca artists. During the summer of 2018 after sitting on the idea for several months, Producer Jacob Stuckelman committed to creating a fully staged production of Little Shop of Horrors inside a flower shop, a concept that has never been seen before. In addition, this production will be celebrating Bool's Flower Shops 125th anniversary.  References  Related reading *Pearson, Mike (2010). Site-Specific Performance. Palgrave Macmillan. .

Boylston Market Association, 131 F.2d 966 (1st Cir. 1942) was a taxation case decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. Issues Whether a cash method taxpayer is limited to the deduction of insurance premiums actually paid in any year or whether he should deduct each year the pro rata portion of the prepaid insurance attributable to that year? Facts The cash method taxpayer had a business in which he owned and managed real estate. The taxpayer would purchase insurance policies covering periods of three or more years. The taxpayer would then deduct each year an insurance expense in the amount of insurance premium applicable to carrying insurance for that year regardless of the year in which the premium was actually paid. Analysis In Welch v. De Blois, 94 F.2d 842 (1st Cir. 1938), the First Circuit allowed a cash method taxpayer to make a full deduction of insurance premiums in the year he paid them as an ordinary and necessary business expense, despite the fact that the insurance covered a three-year period. However, this court is unable to find a basis for distinguishing the prepayment of rentals, bonuses for the acquisition of leases, bonuses for the cancellation of leases, commissions for negotiating leases – all of which need to be prorated over the time period - and prepaid insurance. This court can cite no justification for treating prepaid insurance in a different manner than treating other prepayments. To permit the taxpayer to take a full deduction in the year of payment would distort his income. Moreover, prepaid insurance may be easily allocable. The insurance premium represents the protection of the property for the entire period, and the taxpayer may surrender the insurance policy at any time. Therefore, the insurance is clearly an asset having a longer life than a single taxable year.Treasury Regulation § 1.461-1(a)(1). “If an expenditure results in the creation of an asset having a useful life which extends substantially beyond the close of the taxable year, such an expenditure may not be deductible, or may be deductible only in part, for the taxable year in which it was made.” Furthermore, by treating prepaid insurance as a capital expense, we are obtaining some degree of consistency. We therefore overrule Welch v. De Blois and hold that prepaid insurance deductions must be allocable over the time period for which the policy covers.

Frank Baum.\\" Frank Joslyn Baum, a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army and eldest son of writer L. Frank Baum, was involved in the film's production, and may have had an involvement in the film's script, which is loosely inspired by the elder Baum's 1900 novel, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. It runs approximately eight and a half minutes and is nearly wordless, working mainly with arrangements of classical music created by Carl W. Stalling.'The Wizard of Oz' Is Coming to TV, Plus a Look at All the Other Versions-Closer Weekly The film was originally made in Technicolor, but because it was made without proper licensing from the Technicolor Corporation (which limited use of its 3-strip process to Disney), it never received a theatrical release. Plot summary A tornado sweeps through the plains of Kansas, lifting Dorothy and Toto. The two tumble into Oz, landing on the Scarecrow. After freeing him from his pole, the trio stroll together, soon finding a Tin Woodman and oiling him. After the four watch mating rituals of various animals set to strains of Camille Saint-Saëns's \\"The Swan\\", they are welcomed into the Emerald City. Suits of armor sing to them, \\"Hail to the Wizard of Oz! To the Wizard of Oz we lead the way!\\" A creature resembling the A-B-Sea Serpent of The Royal Book of Oz extends itself as stairsteps for Dorothy to enter the coach. The Wizard is a cackling white-bearded man in a starry black robe and conical hat who produces custom seats for each of the four nervous travelers, including one for Toto (the Toto chair is mostly cut out of the frame in most video versions, but is later shown in a full shot of Toto sitting). He proceeds to perform magic with a hen and eggs. These are variations on simple sleight of hand tricks involving making objects appear, but the hen is able to take the eggs back into her body. Finally, the hen releases an egg that will not stop growing. The five try to fight it, with the Tin Woodman breaking his axe. Soon, though, the egg hatches, the hen takes the chick, and clucks out \\"Rock-a-bye Baby\\" as a chorus joins her.Intrnet Archive Home video There are many home media releases of the film, including Betamax, VHS, Laserdisc, CED, DVD,Flickchart HD DVD and Blu-ray Disc, usually printed and shown in black-and-white, not technicolor. Cassette copies are usually at slow speeds, and often overexposed and poorly framed, while disc copies are all at faster speeds, and underexposed and correctly framed. The first known commercial release was in Canada in 1985, on Betamax, VHS and Laserdisc, through the efforts of Fred M. Meyer, longtime Secretary of The International Wizard of Oz Club. This is not an original color print, but has been colored to match the original intent of the filmmakers, which, as in the MGM film that followed, had the film go from black and white to color upon Dorothy's arrival in Oz. Cassette copies also contained a stray hair during the parade sequence, while the LaserDisc copies did not.

It is now manufactured by the Dad's Root Beer Company, LLC and owned by Hedinger Brands, LLC for the United States, Canada, and Mexico, and by Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta for international markets (in particular Asia and Africa).  History  The Bubble Up name was first used in 1919 by Sweet Valley Products Co. of Sandusky, Ohio. Bubble Up at that time was advertised as a grape juice, rather than lemon-lime. Sweet Valley Products filed a trademark for the name Bubble-Up on August 13, 1919; the registration date was April 12, 1921. The name Bubble-Up was virtually unused from 1922 to 1937. LeRoy O. Schneeburger of St. Louis, Missouri, then President of the Whistle-Vess Beverage Co., bought the United States registration of Bubble-Up in 1937 and registered the mark in his own name in 1938. He introduced Bubble-Up as a lemon-lime drink, and the mark was never used for a grape juice. The Bubble-Up Company was formed in St. Louis and the beverage was franchised and bottled all across the country. The Bubble-Up Company remained in St. Louis until approximately 1953. (The exact dates of the beginning and end of the company timeline is an estimate but should be close.) In 1953, the Bubble Up Company was located in Peoria, Illinois. The current owner was the O-So Grape Co. On April 10, 1959, the trademark \\"Kiss of Lemon - Kiss of Lime\\" was registered by Bubble Corporation, Peoria, Illinois. Sometime in the early to mid-1960s, the Bubble Up Corp. was located in Los Angeles, Calif. The company fell into bad times and filed for bankruptcy in 1970. I.C. Industries of Chicago, Illinois bought Bubble Up in 1973 to go along with its recently acquired Dad's Root Beer Co. and Pepsi-Cola General Bottlers. I.C. Industries wanted to revive Bubble Up, and trademarked a new logo for Bubble Up in 1979. In 1987, Bubble Up was sold along with Dad's Root Beer Co. to the Monarch Co. of Atlanta, Georgia. Bubble Up and Dad's Root Beer remained headquartered in Chicago to serve the company's 240 franchised bottlers. Hedinger Brands LLC, located in Jasper, Indiana, purchased Bubble Up in 2007.

These pre-shared keys are symmetric keys shared in advance among the communicating parties. There are several cipher suites: The first set of ciphersuites use only symmetric key operations for authentication. The second set use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange authenticated with a pre-shared key. The third set combine public key authentication of the server with pre-shared key authentication of the client. Usually, Transport Layer Security (TLS) uses public key certificates or Kerberos for authentication. TLS-PSK uses symmetric keys, shared in advance among the communicating parties, to establish a TLS connection. There are several reasons to use PSKs: * Using pre-shared keys can, depending on the ciphersuite, avoid the need for public key operations. This is useful if TLS is used in performance-constrained environments with limited CPU power. * Pre-shared keys may be more convenient from a key management point of view. For instance, in closed environments where the connections are mostly configured manually in advance, it may be easier to configure a PSK than to use certificates. Another case is when the parties already have a mechanism for setting up a shared secret key, and that mechanism could be used to “bootstrap” a key for authenticating a TLS connection.

Reverend David Newton is the current preacher.  History  The original chapel was opened in 1707, and the building was used by residents, but it became apparent that a more functional building should be used. In 1866, for a cost of approximately £2,000, a new chapel was built, much larger than the original. It was opened on 2 May 1866, and the original building remains to this date. Recent development Extensive plans were made for a new building to be constructed and for the land to be developed efficiently. The final plan was put in place, allowing the Church to keep the 1866 building, but refurbish inside to a high- spec. They closed the balcony and upper floor auditorium, placing a false roof in, and altering the ground floor into modern facilities. The adjoining halls, which used to house the facilities hall, stage, dressing rooms, kitchen and Sunday School rooms were converted into private flats, and a new building, a block of flats, was built to the rear. The graveyard has been part of regeneration schemes, and through extensive grants and volunteer help, the place has been converted, and is now used as an open-classroom, facilitating for the local schools. During this time of development, the church was closed and it was relocated to the Youth Centre, before the grand opening a couple of years ago. In joint schemes through church members, the wide community and businesses, several events and schemes operate through the year. The former Joseph Priestley College (Now Leeds City College) have since the Church opened, encouraged college learning, providing many courses, especially IT. Also, some youngsters have been encouraged to take part in the redevelopment in the garden, learning from experts on construction and gardening.

His service was conducted across Europe, but his most important work was in military and defensive organisation against the threat of French invasion during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Don was also frequently requested for advisory and espionage work by British generals and was once employed by the Prussian State as a spy. In 1799 he was arrested during a truce by Guillaume Brune who accused him of attempting to foment rebellion in the Batavian Republic and was not released until the Peace of Amiens. During and following the wars, Don also served as Lieutenant Governor of Jersey and Governor Gibraltar, implementing organizational reforms with much success in both places. Early career Don was born in 1756, the second son of wine merchant John Don and his wife Anna Seton. In 1770, Don joined the army as an ensign in the 51st Regiment of Foot and was stationed in Menorca from 1774 after being made Lieutenant. Menorca was, at the time, a British-administered territory and naval base, and was heavily fortified after its capture by the Spanish and recapture in the Seven Years' War twenty years earlier. During his service on the island, Don became close acquaintances with the island's governor General Johnstone and General James Murray and served on the staff of the former as aide-de-camp and was consequently promoted to captain.Don, Sir George, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, S. G. Benady. Retrieved 3 December 2007 During the American Revolutionary War, Menorca came under attack by Spanish and French forces and Don was an important figure in the seven-month siege of the British garrison in Fort St. Philip. Despite the enforced surrender of the garrison in 1782, his reputation was enhanced and he gained further status when he married Murray's niece, Maria Margaretta, in 1783. Promoted major the same year, Don transferred to the 59th Regiment of Foot for his first posting in Gibraltar where he served on peacetime duty until 1791. With war again looming in the aftermath of the French Revolution, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given a staff appointment in Jersey, where his regiment was stationed in 1792. Jersey was an obvious target of the French if war was declared, and he worked on the island's defences before being called away by Murray in 1793 to serve as his aide-de-camp in the unsuccessful Flanders Campaign. For his services in this campaign, Don was given the ceremonial post of Aide-de-Camp to King George III and was promoted to full colonel. French Revolutionary War Don was not evacuated with the rest of the British army in 1795 after the campaign's collapse, but instead remained in Europe in the service of the Prussian King. Prussia had been knocked out of the war following the Peace of Basel in 1795, but remained allied to Britain in her struggle with France and Don was seconded to the Prussian court as a liaison officer. He may have coordinated espionage activities against France during this period, although records are vague. In 1798 Don returned to Britain as a major-general and was placed in command of the defences of the Isle of Wight, a weak spot on the Southern Coast of England. In 1799, he was attached to the force under the Duke of York which invaded the Batavian Republic with an Anglo-Russian army. He was ostensibly in command of the 3rd Division under Sir David Dundas but was frequently detached on espionage and negotiation duties. This culminated in his arrest by Guillaume Brune during negotiations to allow a peaceful withdrawal of allied troops. Charged with attempting to provoke an anti-French rebellion amongst the Dutch inhabitants of the Batavian Republic, Don spent the next two years in prison, only being released at the end of 1800 in the prelude to the Peace of Amiens. Whilst in captivity, he was rewarded with the colonelcy of the 9th West India Regiment. On his release, Don returned to Scotland and in 1802 was in charge of organising and training the militia forces which were tasked with the defence of the South-Eastern coast of Scotland. In 1803 he returned to London to command the King's German Legion, a Hanoverian formation seconded to the British Army. Promoted Lieutenant-General on 1 January 1805, on 5 November of the same year he sailed with a 14,000 strong force to Germany, part of Britain's belated land commitment to the 3rd Coalition. Landing at Cuxhaven 17th he was superseded by Lord Cathcart soon after his arrival. Governor of Jersey and Gibraltar Bust of George Don outside the Gibraltar Parliament Statue of Don in Saint Helier, Jersey In 1805 Don's colonelcy was transferred to the 96th Regiment of Foot. In 1806 he was made Lieutenant Governor of Jersey, a post he maintained for the entire duration of the Napoleonic Wars. In Jersey, he built roads and defences, organised local militia and built up a strong relationship with the local community. His tenure there was only briefly broken in 1809 when he was attached to the ill-fated Walcheren Expedition to command the withdrawal of thousands of desperately sick men. In 1814, after lengthy service on Jersey, Don became a full General and took the post of Governor of Gibraltar. Finding Gibraltar in the grip of yellow fever, he used his experience from past commissions to organise and build an effective sanitation system in the territory, including a clean water supply, a new hospital and the Alameda Botanic Gardens park. Don's stay in Gibraltar also included several other innovations including the first police force, the forerunner of the Royal Gibraltar Police, the main courthouse, updated defences and a network of roads connecting the peninsula with the Spanish hinterland. During his 17-year stay in Gibraltar, Don became very popular and was effectively governor except for 1821–25, when Lord Chatham was in Gibraltar. He was in charge of Gibraltar as Lieutenant-Governor whilst the title of Governor was held by the absentee Duke of Kent until his death in 1820, followed by the Earl of Chatham. Later life Don also served as the colonel of the 36th Regiment of Foot and the 3rd Regiment of Foot during his time in Gibraltar. He retired in late 1831 as a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath and a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order for his extensive service as a military officer and colonial governor and was given the retirement posting of Governor of Scarborough Castle. He did not return to England however. He died of influenza on 17 January 1832 and was buried in the new English Church (later the Cathedral of the Holy Trinity, Gibraltar) which he had had built during his time as Governor. Cape Don, at the tip of the Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory, Australia, is named after him.

Nominated by the Christian Social Party, Breisky served as minister of education and the interior from July to November 1920, as the vice chancellor and state secretary of education from November 1920 to May 1922. Together with his Social Democratic deputy, Otto Glöckel, Breisky initiated sweeping reforms of Austria's education system. In January 1922, Breisky became the caretaker chancellor of Austria for a single day.  Early life  Walter Breisky was born on 8 July 1871 in Bern, Switzerland. He was the second son of August Breisky and Pauline Breisky, née von Less. Both parents were of Bohemian descent. The family was living in Switzerland at the time of Breisky's birth because his father, a noted physician, had accepted a professorship of gynecology at the University of Bern in 1867. When August Breisky was invited to assume a chair at the University of Prague in 1874, the family moved back home. In Prague, Breisky attended elementary school and received the first four years of his gymnasium education. In 1886, his father was offered a position with the Second Gynecological Clinic of the University of Vienna. Breisky thus completed his secondary education in the imperial capital, graduating from the prestigious Gymnasium Wasagasse in 1890. Shortly before Breisky could finish school, his father died, a loss that appears to have hit the young man hard. Since Breisky was not yet of age, his father's older brother, Rudolf Baron Breisky, became his legal guardian, eventually also adopting him. Baron Breisky was a senior official in the Ministry of the Interior; he had served as the chair of the ministry's executive committee () for 25 years and was one of the closest collaborators of Eduard Taaffe. It is likely that Baron Breisky encouraged his ward to pursue a career in the imperial bureaucracy. Breisky's grades appeared to suggest that his talents lay more in the humanities than in any technical fields. Breisky enrolled at the University of Vienna to study law and political science (). He graduated, with distinction, in 1895.  Career   Civil servant  Within ten days of graduating from university, Breisky secured employment as an apprentice clerk () in the governor's office () of the Archduchy of Lower Austria. It is unlikely that Breisky owed his swift admission into the civil service to his uncle's patronage: Walter Breisky was chosen for the position by Erich Graf von Kielmannsegg, who intensely disliked Rudolf Baron Breisky for the latter's personality; in Kielmannsegg's autobiography, Baron Breisky would be described as a supercilious fossil. In spite of the enmity between guardian and superior, Breisky rose through the ranks with apparent easy and remarkable speed. In 1895, he was assigned to the Korneuburg district administration. Three years later, he was promoted from apprentice clerk to regular clerk () and appointed to the executive committee of the provincial bureaucracy. His performance reviews were consistently glowing. On 1 January 1900 Breisky was moved to the Ministry of Education. Employment in the ministerial bureaucracy was significantly more prestigious than employment in a provincial administration, and Breisky was still only 28 years old, unusually young for advancement to the ministry. The step up in rank was all the more remarkable as Breisky was a Protestant, a serious handicap in the Habsburg bureaucracy in general and in the Ministry of Education in particular. In 1905, the Ministry tried to get rid of the religious outsider by offering him to fill a vacancy on the Evangelical Church Council. The move would have advanced Breisky by an additional two steps in rank. Breisky declined. Breisky's refusal to accept the sinecure did no permanent damage to his career. In April 1907, Breisky was appointed to the ministry's executive office. In February 1908, he was promoted to ministerial secretary (); he subsequently became a noted collaborator of Minister- President Baron Max Wladimir von Beck, the Cisleithanian head of government. The two men grew very close, to the point of spending extended holidays together. In 1909, Breisky received the job title of departmental advisor (). In 1913, he was made a ministerial advisor (). The collapse of the Austro- Hungarian Empire at the end of World War I was a serious personal blow to Breisky, who was 47 years old now and had spent his entire working life as a loyal servant of the Habsburgs. In spite of his despondency, Breisky remained at his post. The emerging Republic of German-Austria knew to appreciate his experience. In May 1919, Breisky was made a department director () in the State Chancellery (), personal bureau of Chancellor Karl Renner and heart of the rump state's executive apparatus. Once again, Breisky became a close confidant and trusted lieutenant of the chief executive. Renner instructed his staff that document addressed to Renner should also be made available to Breisky, preferably Renner himself had seen it.  Minister of education  Otto Glöckel, a Social Democrat and energetic reformer, was Breisky's deputy during his first few months as minister of education. Breisky was no ideologue and felt no instinctive allegiance to any of the republic's three dominant political camps. A scion of the upper class and socially conservative by temperament, Breisky was certainly no Social Democrat, his harmonious working relationship with Renner nonwithstanding. The Christian Social camp shared his traditionalism but was also explicitly Catholic. His Evangelical faith would have pointed him to the German Nationalists, also socially conservative. A descendant of a family of Habsburg civil servants and a lifelong Habsburg civil servant himself, however, would not have felt drawn to a camp that defined itself as pan-German and as Antisemitic besides. Even so, Breisky eventually entered formal politics. In July 1920, the Social Democratic Party, Christian Social Party, and Greater German People's Party agreed to form a national unity government to manage the transition from provisional to permanent constitution that was in progress at the time. The Christian Socials offered to make Breisky head of the Ministry of Education. Breisky accepted. On 7 July Breisky was sworn in as a state secretary – the term for \\"minister\\" in the provisional constitution – of education in the first Mayr government. The deputy state secretary of education under both Renner and Mayr was Otto Glöckel, a Social Democrat and committed progressive. Glöckel was driving an ambitious program of education reform that included both structural reorganization and a drastic changes to the system's pedagogical approach. Traditionally, children were sorted into different educational tracks after graduating from elementary school at age ten. In theory, the sorting criteria were scholastic aptitude and talent profile; in practice, students were sorted by socioeconomic background. Glöckel meant to help break down class barriers through merging the different types of middle schools, thus delaying the sorting for another four years. In terms of style, education was to focus on inspiring self-reliance and independent thought as opposed to rote learning. Glöckel's new superior, no revolutionary but open to new ideas, halted some of Glöckel's reforms but happily embraced others, then added reform ideas of his own. He promoted access to education for girls, worked to improve teacher training, professionalized the textbook approbation process, overhauled the school physicians' service, and modernized curricula. He also worked to improve access to education, and to the arts and humanities in particular, for children in rural regions. While Vienna was a vibrant metropolis and one of the world capitals of music and theater, large parts of the rest of Austria were a backwater. Breisky took the initiative in organizing concerts and theatrical performances for the sons and daughters of the hinterland. When the Social Democrats left the unity government on 22 October, the post of minister of the army – now actually called \\"minister\\" because the new constitution had entered into force – became vacant. Breisky was appointed acting minister. When the second Mayr government took office on 20 November, Breisky became vice chancellor. The Ministry of Education had been merged into the Ministry of the Interior, and the combined ministry was lead not by Breisky but by Egon Glanz. Breisky, however, was made the state secretary – the term now meant \\"deputy minister\\" – in charge of education affairs, retaining his previous portfolio and continuing his reform work. When Glanz resigned on 7 April 1921 Breisky was promoted to acting minister. On 21 June the first Schober government was inaugurated; this cabinet too included Breisky as both vice chancellor and state secretary of education.  Chancellor for a day  Johannes Schober, Breisky's predecessor and successor as the chancellor of Austria On 16 December 1921 Chancellor Schober and President Hainisch signed the Treaty of Lana, an agreement of mutual understanding and friendship between Austria and Czechoslovakia. In particular, Austria reconfirmed to its neighbor to the north that it would faithfully abide by the Treaty of Saint- Germain and would neither seek unification with Germany nor attempt to restore the Habsburgs to power. In return, Czechoslovakia promised a substantial loan to the struggling, cash-strapped rump state. The treaty would also generally improve Austria's international standing and make it easier for Austria to secure additional loans from other countries. The Christian Socials were in favor of the treaty, but their remaining coalition partner, the Greater German People's Party, was vehemently opposed. Ardently pan-German, the People's Party had been hoping that Austria would, sooner or later, defy the Treaty of Saint-Germain and would seek accession to the German Reich. The party had also been hoping that the unification of all Germans would extend to the Sudeten Germans, the German-speaking former Habsburg subjects living in what used to be Bohemia. Schober, whom the party had considered an ally, was renouncing both these goals. In the final days of December 1921, the People's Party staged protest rallies against the treaty all over the country. On 16 January 1922 it also withdrew its representative from Schober's cabinet. As long as Schober himself remained office, however, the People's Party was still bound by the original coalition agreement. The agreement required the party to vote in support of government bills in the National Council, and one of the government bills on the table in January 1922 was the ratification of the Treaty of Lana. On 26 January, hoping to appease the People's Party by releasing it from its contractual obligation, Schober stepped down. Schober's resignation did not elevate Breisky to the chancellorship automatically, but Hainisch instantly appointed him the caretaker head of government. The Treaty of Lana was ratified with the votes of Christian Socials and Social Democrats, the People's Party voting against. Behind the scenes, Christian Social representatives, and possibly politicians of other parties as well, were lobbying Schober to return; it was widely felt that there simply was no alternative. Schober let himself be persuaded. On 27 January he was elected chancellor a second time. The People's Party did not return its representative to Schober's cabinet but was ready to recommence support for Schober in the National Council. The Breisky government had been in office for just about twenty-four hours. Breisky resumed his roles as vice chancellor and state secretary of education.  Chief statistician  In May 1922, just four months later, Schober was forced to resign again. Ignaz Seipel, Schober's successor, had no use for Breisky in his cabinet. Breisky returned to his old position as the executive department director () in the Chancellery, where he seems to have served Seipel as diligently as he used to serve Renner. Seipel showed himself grateful. On 21 February 1923 Breisky was made the president of the Austrian Statistics Office (). Austria's economic situation was still troubled and, in fact, worsening. The administrators in charge of economic policy were hampered by lack of reliable information. It was unclear how many inhabitants the country had, how many of them were employed, how many businesses there were, and how much they produced. The agency Breisky took over was massively understaffed and poorly organized. Breisky, whose appointment was originally ridiculed for his complete lack of any relevant training or experience, proved himself capable and energetic. Breisky turned the Statistics Office around, then took the initiative in creating the Austrian Institute of Economic Research ( at the time), thus making sure that the agency would be kept on its toes by competition from a think tank of independent scholars.  Later years  Throughout his life, Breisky had been suffering from poor eyesight. His far-sightedness and astigmatism had already been bad enough to get him declared permanently unfit for military service in 1894, and they had been worsening since. On 18 February 1931 Breisky asked to be allowed to retire. His request was granted on 1 October. Breisky spent his final years in Klosterneuburg, where he lived with his wife; he had married Rosa Kowarik, his long-time housekeeper, in 1927. Breisky does not appear to have kept in touch with former colleagues or political collaborators, but he was active in the Pan-Europe Movement and held honorary positions in a number of charities and hobbyists' clubs. He was the honorary president of the Viennese Animal Welfare Association () and an honorary member of the local numismatic society. Breisky spent most of his time in his sprawling library, reading with a magnifying glass. He tried to prevent his eye problem from getting worse by self-medicating with immense amounts of carrots and lemon juice. There is evidence that Breisky felt disheartened by the political developments he witnessed during his sunset days. He expressed no support either for the Austrofascist takeover in 1934 or for the Nazi takeover in 1938. He withdrew further from public life after the Nazi Party came to power in Austria, resigning even his nominal membership in the International Statistical Institute. After the death of his wife on 17 November 1943 Breisky hired a nurse to take care of him. In September 1944, apparently reported to the authorities by his nurse, he was arrested by the Gestapo for listening to the BBC, a so-called . On 25 September, shortly after his release from Nazi custody, Breisky committed suicide.

The contract between Royal Dutch Shell, Anglo Persian (now BP), Compagnie Française des Pétroles (now Total), Near East Development Company (ExxonMobil) and Calouste Gulbenkian was signed in July 1928. At the same time the partners undertook to work together within the boundaries of the former Ottoman Empire - the Red Line Agreement. This agreement had a fundamental influence on the future development of the oil reserves in the Middle East and led directly to the Partex Oil and Gas Group's present interests in the United Arab Emirates and the Sultanate of Oman. In 1938, before the beginning of the Second World War, Calouste Gulbenkian incorporated in Panama a company to hold his assets in the oil industry. It was Participations and Explorations Corporation from which came the name Partex. Calouste Gulbenkian spent the final years of his life in Lisbon, Portugal, where he died in 1955. In his will, he left his oil interests and his art collection to a foundation, which was to be based in Lisbon, Portugal - the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation The Iraq concession was nationalized in 1972, but it's still active in Abu Dhabi and Oman through its joint ventures/concession companies which includes ADPC, ADCO, and POHOL (Private Oil Holdings Oman Ltd.).

Amino acid sequences of the CA1Pase enzymes from wheat, French bean, tobacco, and Arabidopsis reveal that the enzymes contain 2 different domains, indicating that it is a multifunctional enzyme. CA1Pase enzyme activity varies between different species due to their regulation by different redox-active compounds, such as glutathione. However, it is yet to be determined whether this process occurs in vivo. Wheat CA1Pase heterologously expressed in E. coli is also able to dephosphorylate the RuBisCO inhibitor D-glycero-2,3-diulose-1,5-bisphosphate.

The college offers Associate of Arts degrees and certificate programs in 11 other areas. History In 1967 Action for Boston Community Development (ABCD) started the Urban College Program to meet the educational, employment and career development needs for adults, in collaboration with major Boston area colleges and universities. The school enabled students to earn academic credits toward undergraduate and graduate school degrees while acquiring job-related skills. In 1993, the Higher Education Coordinating Council of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts chartered the Urban College of Boston as a private institution authorized to grant Associate of Arts degrees in three areas of study: Early Childhood Education, Human Services Administration and General Studies. In January 1994, UCB enrolled its first degree candidates, both men and women. In 1995, UCB was granted Candidacy Status for Accreditation by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC). In 1998, the affiliation with ABCD was re-cast as a partnership when UCB was granted 501(c)(3) status as a tax exempt non-profit organization. In September 2000, it became a fully independent college, while maintaining a partnership with ABCD. In October 2001, UCB was awarded full accreditation by New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Academics UCB was founded as a \\"non-traditional, multicultural college\\" to enable students from literacy, GED, adult education, Head Start (parents and staff) and youth programs to enroll in a higher education program. The college offers college courses, as well as degree and certificate programs in the fields of early childhood education, general studies, human services administration, and computer technology. It has arrangements helping graduates to attend further degree programs at local colleges. The college is the only educational institution in the City of Boston that offers full course-loads in other languages, which attracts minority students seeking to advance their education while continuing English as a Second Language (ESL) studies. In recent years the college has gained recognition for its services in sex ed & drivers ed for non-drivers since a high number of graduates take advantage of them in order to graduate. As part of their efforts to reach more underserved students, Urban College added off-site location programs in suburbs such as Worcester, Lawrence, Fitchburg, and Boston neighborhoods such as Roxbury. Finances The school ran into financial trouble in 2011 when the federal government cut $700,000 in annual funding. That same year, the U.S. Department of Education disqualified the school from receiving Pell Grant funding. By 2012, Urban College faced a financial deficit and planned to partner with Endicott College. Urban College had a $250,000 deficit that the school could not directly fill, resulting in complaints from the NEASC about the college's future financial viability. UCB aggressively took steps to remedy this situation.Schworm, Peter, \\"College for working women faces closure over deficit of $250,000\\", The Boston Globe, July 19, 2012Forry, Ed, \\"Urban College presses on — in the Coard manner\\", Dorchester Reporter, August 9, 2012Guttenplan, D. D., \\"Education Briefs: Last-minute support comes to aid of community college\\", The New York Times, August 5, 2012 The school solved its financial troubles without becoming partners with Endicott College. Urban College continued serving its students while registering new students and has remained financially stable since.

The technique involves saving a batch of harvested grapes and allowing them to partially dry. If fermentation of the main batch starts to slow or appears to be nearing stuck fermentation, the half dried grapes are added to the must which then gives the yeast cells a new source of sugar to enliven the batch.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 415 Simon and Schuster 1989 From there, the must can be fermented dry or stopped with the wine having a higher level of residual sugar. The process was widely used in the Chianti zones until the advent of temperature controlled fermentation tanks. From Tuscany the technique spread to Marche and Umbria where it is sometimes used today. In the Marche the technique is most often used on wines made from the Verdicchio grape to counteract the grape's natural bitterness and to add some sweetness and frizzante qualities.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 319 Oxford University Press 2006 Benefits The benefits of Governo is that it encourages not only fully completed primary fermentation but can also aid in the developing of malolactic fermentation which can help stabilize the wine. With very acidic grapes like Sangiovese this process will temper some of the harshness and volatility in the wine. A by-product of this technique is an increase in carbon dioxide or \\"fizziness\\" in the wine as well as increased alcohol content due to the added sugar that the yeast will convert into alcohol.

This movement of dislocations results in the material plastically deforming. Pinning points in the material act to halt a dislocation's movement, requiring a greater amount of force to be applied to overcome the barrier. This results in an overall strengthening of materials. Types of pinning points Point defects Point defects (as well as stationary dislocations, jogs, and kinks) present in a material create stress fields within a material that disallow traveling dislocations to come into direct contact. Much like two particles of the same electric charge feel a repulsion to one another when brought together, the dislocation is pushed away from the already present stress field. Alloying elements The introduction of atom1 into a crystal of atom2 creates a pinning point for multiple reasons. An alloying atom is by nature a point defect, thus it must create a stress field when placed into a foreign crystallographic position, which could block the passage of a dislocation. However, it is possible that the alloying material is approximately the same size as the atom that is replaced, and thus its presence would not stress the lattice (as occurs in cobalt alloyed nickel). The different atom would, though, have a different elastic modulus, which would create a different terrain for the moving dislocation. A higher modulus would look like an energy barrier, and a lower like an energy trough – both of which would stop its movement. Second phase precipitates The precipitation of a second phase within the lattice of a material creates physical blockades through which a dislocation cannot pass. The result is that the dislocation must bend (which requires greater energy, or a greater stress to be applied) around the precipitates, which inevitably leaves residual dislocation loops encircling the second phase material and shortens the original dislocation. This schematic shows how a dislocation interacts with solid phase precipitates. The dislocation moves from left to right in each frame. Grain boundaries Dislocations require proper lattice ordering to move through a material. At grain boundaries, there is a lattice mismatch, and every atom that lies on the boundary is uncoordinated. This stops dislocations that encounter the boundary from moving.

Retrieved February 29, 2016 Up until that point, the diocese had always been directly dependent on the Holy See. History During the Gothic War the city of Todi withstood Totila during a long and severe siege. The Lombard failed to capture it, and Todi and Perugia remained the two chief fortresses defending the passage through the duchy from Rome to the Exarchate. It was included in Pepin's donation to the Holy See. Other bishops are: *Guglielmo Dallavigna (1405), who tried to induce the antipope Benedict XIII to renounce his claim; *the brothers Cardinal Filippo Antonio Gualterio (1709) and Ludovico Anselmo Gualterio (1719), who erected a new seminary; *Francesco M. Pasini (1760), under whom the restoration of the cathedral was completed. Chapter and cathedral The cathedral was also a parish church. The Chapter of the cathedral of the Annunciation in Todi consisted of two dignities (the Provost and the Archdeacon) and twelve Canons, each with a prebend (assigned income). In addition there were eight mansionarii and other clergy.Ughelli Italia sacra I, p. 1349, additional note by Coleti (where \\"canonici 21\\" is an obvious printer's error.

Synods Bishop Angelo Cesi (1566–1606) presided over a diocesan synod in 1576, and published its constitutions, as well as those of earlier synods, including one of Bishop Andreas de Aptis (1356–1373). A diocesan synod was held by Bishop Pietro Maria Bichi (1658–1673) on 22–24 May 1662, and another on 16 April 1668. Bishop Giuseppe Pianetti (1673–1709) held a diocesan synod in Todi on 27—29 April 1678. Bishop Francesco Maria Gazzoli (1805–1848) held a diocesan synod on 1–2 May 1818.F. M.

Reorganization of dioceses In a decree of the Second Vatican Council, it was recommended that dioceses be reorganized to take into account modern developments.Directoriae normae clare a Concilio impertitae de dioecesium recognitione; indicia atque elementa apta ad actionem pastoralem aestimandam ab episcopis suppeditata quibus plurium dioecesium regimen commissum est. A project begun on orders from Pope John XXIII, and continued under his successors, was intended to reduce the number of dioceses in Italy and to rationalize their borders in terms of modern population changes and shortages of clergy. The change was made urgent because of changes made to the Concordat between the Italian State and the Holy See on 18 February 1984, and embodied in a law of 3 June 1985. The change was approved by Pope John Paul II in an audience of 27 September 1986, and by a decree of the Sacred Congregation of Bishops of the Papal Curia on 30 September 1986. The diocese of Todi was united to the diocese of Orvieto. Its name was to be Dioecesis Urbevetana- Tudertina. The seat of the diocese was to be in Orvieto. The former cathedral in Todi was to have the honorary title of co-cathedral, and its Chapter was to be called the Capitulum Concathedralis. There was to be only one episcopal curia, one seminary, one ecclesiastical tribunal; and all the clergy were to be incardinated in the diocese of Orvieto-Todi. The territory of the diocese was to be the same as the two dioceses combined.Acta Apostolicae Sedis An. et Vol. LXXIX (Città del Vaticano: Typis Polyglottis Vaticanis 1987), pp. 811-814.

The group protested against the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) and other white supremacist organizations and published anti-racist literature. Members of the JBAKC were involved in a string of bombings of military, government, and corporate targets in the 1980s. The JBAKC viewed themselves as anti-imperialists and considered African Americans, Native Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Mexicans to be oppressed colonial peoples. The JBAKC was started in 1978 by a group of white anti-racist activists with ties to the Weather Underground. They named the organization after abolitionist John Brown, who advocated and engaged in violence as a means to end slavery in the U.S. According to founding member Lisa Roth, the event that triggered the formation of the group was the discovery that the KKK was actively organizing in New York State prisons. The JBAKC soon had chapters in several states, but was most active in New York City, Chicago, and San Francisco. The group promoted itself by distributing fliers at punk rock concerts, and was supported by benefit concerts from punk bands like the Dead Kennedys, The Contractions, and Dirty Rotten Imbeciles. The JBAKC shared members with several other radical groups active at the time, and some have claimed that it was a front organization for the May 19th Communist Movement. Publications Flier distributed by the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee in 1984 In 1980, the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee distributed a pamphlet entitled \\"Take a Stand Against the Klan\\", which outlined the group's \\"Principles of Unity\\": > #Fight White Supremacy in All Its Forms! Death to the Klan! Support the > Struggle of the Black Nation for Self-Determination! Support the Struggle to > Free the Land! #Follow Black and Other Third World Leadership #Support the > Struggle of Third World People for Human Rights! Oppose White Supremacist > Attacks! The John Brown Anti-Klan Committee published a quarterly national newsletter, originally called Death to the Klan, and later renamed No KKK, No Fascist USA!. The paper had a circulation of 10,000 and focused on issues such as the racist nature of tracking in schools, homophobia, and political prisoners. The New York chapter also published a local newsletter called Up South. In 1991 the JBAKC released a video about fascism and anti-fascism in the US entitled Behind the Burning Cross: Racism USA. Protests Flier distributed by the JBAKC Los Angeles chapter in 1984 The JBAKC directly confronted white supremacists when they held rallies, and the confrontations sometimes became violent. In 1983 the group worked with the Brown Berets to disrupt a KKK march in Austin, Texas. The protesters hurled rocks and bottles at the marchers, and the ensuing fights resulted in 12 injured people and 11 arrests. The Austin police chief blamed the violence on the JBAKC and Brown Berets, but one police officer was found to have used excessive force in the arrest of a Brown Beret member. Later that year, three members were arrested for participating in a riot outside an Arlington, Virginia high school, where neo-Nazis held a demonstration to mark \\"White Pride Day\\". When a group of KKK members protested at a Gay Pride Parade in Chicago in 1986, they were met by counter- demonstrators from JBAKC and another anti-racist group. A crowd of around 2,500 Klan supporters chased the anti-Klan groups, leading to 17 arrests and minor injuries to eight police officers. In addition to confronting white supremacists, the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee also took a stand against what they saw as police brutality. In 1983, 20 members of the Los Angeles chapter demonstrated outside the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department to protest the shooting of a five-year-old black boy by a white police officer from the Stanton Police Department. The protesters passed out a pamphlet headlined \\"Stop Killer Cops!\\" and claimed that the officer overreacted because he felt threatened being in a black community. A police spokesperson claimed that the child had waved a realistic toy gun at the officer. As part of their effort to challenge white supremacy, the group worked to clean up anti-Semitic and racist graffiti in the Lincoln Park neighborhood of Chicago. The swastikas and similar graffiti were spray-painted on the 40th anniversary of Kristallnacht, when Jewish-owned businesses across Germany were vandalized. The vandalism was attributed to William G. Leinberger, a member of the neo- Nazi group Chicago Area Skin Heads. Despite their work opposing certain forms of anti-Semitism, not all Jewish groups supported the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee. At two California anti-Klan rallies, the JBAKC were confronted by protesters from the Jewish Defense League (JDL), who accused the group of anti-Semitism for their strong positions against Zionism. JDL spokesman Irv Rubin said of the Committee, \\"They hate Israel with a passion\\". The Anti- Defamation League also criticized the JBAKC, claiming that the organization \\"actually promotes racism and advocates organized violence.\\" The JBAKC, for its part, referred to Zionism as \\"the enshrinement of white supremacy,\\" accused Zionists of \\"work[ing] with the Klan and other white supremacist groups,\\" and asserted that there was no inherent opposition between \\"Zionism and Nazism.\\" Evelyn Torton Beck, \\"Next Year in Jerusalem?\\", in _Nice Jewish Girls: A Lesbian Anthology_ (Watertown: Persephone Press, 1982), p. 194 Bombings Between 1982 and 1984 a group of radical activists planted a string of bombs at military, government, and corporate targets along the East Coast to protest apartheid in South Africa and what they saw as American aggression in Central America, Grenada and Lebanon. The activists used a variety of names, such as the Armed Resistance Unit, Guerrilla Resistance, United Freedom Front, and the Revolutionary Fighting Group, but the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) believed that a single group was responsible. While the John Brown Anti-Klan Committee never claimed responsibility for the bombings, three members of the group were later convicted for their participation in them. Laura Whitehorn and Marilyn Buck served long prison sentences for related crimes, and Linda Evans was released in 2001 when President Bill Clinton commuted her 40-year sentence after she had served 16 years. Five members of the JBAKC and one member of the New Movement in Solidarity with Puerto Rican Independence and Socialism were found in contempt of court for refusing to testify before a grand jury regarding the bombs planted at the U.S. Capitol and two military targets during the bombing campaign.

The sagacity with which the Maharaja selected his officers was reason of his uniform success ...\\" Ranjit Singh had seen him in action at Akalgarh three years earlier and again in the fight against the Bhangi Sardar of Gujarat. Mokham Chand had fallen out with the Bhangi and came to Ranjit Singh upon his request. Ranjit welcomed him with handsome gifts of an elephant and horses and granted him the Dallewalia possessions as a Jagir. He was made commander of a cavalry unit with the power to recruit 1500 foot soldiers as well. He was the commander in chief of armies in Battle of Attock which defeated Durrani Empire Wazir Fateh Khan and Dost Mohammad Khan. With the permission of the Maharaja, the Sikh forces attacked the Afghans on 12 July, 1813 at Hazro, about 8 kilometers from Attock. This battle is also known as the battle of Chhuchh. Terrible fighting took place between the adversaries. In the meantime, Afghans received fresh reinforcements under Dost Muhammad Khan.Hari Ram Gupta, History of the Sikhs, Vol. V, pp. 110-11 452 Murray, History of the Sikhs, Vol. II, p. 13; Cunningham History of the Sikhs, p. 138. Agrees with this date; Hari Ram Gupta, History of the Sikhs, Vol. V, p. 101, mention Ranjit Singh got the news of this battle on 12 July 1813, from a letter sent from Pind Dadan Khan by Sukh Dayal, an agent of Rama Nand Sahu, stating that the battle was fought on 9 July 1813. According to N. K. Sinha, Ranjit Singh, p. 50. This battle took place on 26 June 1813. 453 Murray, History of the Punjab, Vol. II, p. 13. }} The Diwan left his elephant, mounted a horse and personally leading his reserves fell upon the disorganized Afghans. Hand to hand fighting took place and there were heavy losses on both sides. Diwan Amar Nath mentions that 2,000 Afghans were killed. Dost Muhammad was seriously wounded. Many Afghans drowned in the Indus and a large number were taken prisoner. The Sikhs plundered the provisions of the Afghans. Besides Diwan Mohkam Chand, Jodh Singh Kalsia and Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, Sardar Dal Singh, Diwan Ram Dayal also took part in fighting against Afghans at Hazro. Fateh Khan fled away to Peshawar. Thus the victory for the Sikhs was complete. The credit for this major triumph goes to the dynamic generalship of Diwan Mohkam Chand. Hukam Singh Chimni was appointed Qiladar of the fort of Attock.  Death and successors  He died at Phillaur on 29 October 1814, on a Saturday. His son Diwan Moti Ram and grandsons Diwan Kirpa Ram and Diwan Ram Dayal (appointed as Governor of Attock) who too rendered meritorious services to the Sikh State. He was one of the architects of the Sikh empire who rose by dint of merit to the post of Diwan and virtually the commander-in-chief of the Sikh forces. N. K. Sinha observes. \\"As a general, he was uniformly successful and from 1806 to 1814 the annexation of Ranjit Singh was due not only to his irresistible cunning but also to Mohkam Chand's military talents.\\" Ranjit Singh always held him in high esteem. He had a sound knowledge of military tactics and strategy. He did not suffer a defeat; he was an ever victorious General.

In 1962, the school was sold to Victor Best and renamed The Northeast Broadcasting School. Northeast Company Inc. bought the school in 1988; at that time the curriculum was only a diploma in Radio and Television Broadcasting. Not until July 1991 did the school offer a second diploma in Recording Arts. By September 1995 the school was granted the authority to offer Associates of Science degrees in Broadcasting and Recording Arts. 1997 brought yet another change of the name to Massachusetts Communications College. During 1998 three more associate degrees became available: Communications Studies, Multimedia Communications, and Internet Communications. An associate degree in Graphic Design became available in June 2000, and in 2001 the school changed its name once again to The New England Institute of Art and Communications. In December 2001, the school started awarding Bachelor of Science degrees. The Center of Professional Development opened during 2002, allowing the school to award certificates.

Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) regulation dictate that the white wines from Gaillac must include at least 15% Len de l'El blended with Mauzac, though there has been movements to allow substitution of Sauvignon blanc (and since 2007 growers have been officially permitted to do so).Oz Clarke Encyclopedia of Grapes pg 116 Harcourt Books 2001 Prior to the phylloxera epidemic, Len de l'El constituted more than 30% of all plantings in the Gaillac region.J. Robinson Vines, Grapes & Wines pg 237 Mitchell Beazley 1986 But the grapes are prone to rot and have been declining in plantings in recent times. The wines made from the grape are typically full bodied with low acidity but powerful fruit notes. History and name origins Len de l'El is found almost exclusively in the Gaillac region (pictured) Ampelographers believe that Len de l'El is native to Gaillac region of Southwest France where it has had a long history of wine production. Even as the 20th century saw the introduction of new grape varieties and a push towards more international and marketable varieties, strong regional attachment to the variety has kept the grape from falling into obscurity. Like the Manseng family of grapes in the Jurançon, growers in the Gaillac region used the codification of wine laws for the Appellation d'origine contrôlée in 1938 to dictate a minimum usage of Len de l'El for all white blends produced in the area—thus sustaining its presence.J. Robinson Jancis Robinson's Guide to Wine Grapes pg 96 Oxford University Press 1996 Oxford Companion to Wine \\"Len de l'El \\" Accessed: February 6th, 2011 While the laws were later amended in the 21st century to allow the substitution of Sauvignon blanc, the effects of the initial mandate for Len de l'El's use helped maintain the variety's presence in the region. It is widely accepted that the name Len de l'El comes from the Toulouse Occitan dialect. Incidentally, it is phonetically similar to the French translation loin de l'œil meaning \\"far from the eye\\" with the synonym sometimes still seen on wine labels along with other alternative spellings. Wine expert Oz Clarke explains that the name refers to the position of the fruit in respect to the bud : the clustered grapes have long stalks that attach to the fruiting cane at a distance that is farther from the bud (or \\"eye\\", oeil in French) than most grape varieties. This explanation is supported by Gaillac wine growersGaillac Wines \\"A specific collection of grape varieties \\" Grand Vin du Sud-Ouest (English). Accessed: 23 October 2011 and at least one French ampelography authority as well. Wine regions Gaillac growers can now substitute Sauvignon blanc (pictured) for the minimum 15% of Len de l'El required for AOC white wines. Len de l'El is found virtually exclusively in the Gaillac AOC where it is a minor blending grape in the white and sparkling wine blends based primarily on the Mauzac grape. According to AOC regulations, at least 15% of the white blends must include either Len de l'El or Sauvignon blanc. Other grapes that may be blended with Len de l'El include Sémillon, Muscadelle and Ondenc.P. Saunders Wine Label Language pg 73 Firefly Books 2004 The grape can also be found in the experimental wines of several vin de pays, most notably the major VDP of Southwest France Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan where it is often blended with Muscadelle, Petit Manseng, Muscat blanc, Mauzac and Sauvignon blanc.Wines of France Vin de Pays du Comté Tolosan \\" Accessed: February 6th, 2011 Viticulture Len de l'El is highly prone to various grape diseases, particularly the grape rots that can afflict vineyards in the moist maritime climate of Southwest France. Therefore, growers tend to limit plantings of the grapes to hillside locations with well draining vineyard soils and ventilation of air currents to keep the vines dry. The vine can be quite vigorous and produce larger yields that can further dilute the character of the grape if not kept in check. While it is often blended with Mauzac, Len de l'El's tendency to ripen up to two weeks earlier than Mauzac can create some complications for growers which often requires Mauzauc to be harvested a little bit earlier so its acidity can balance the alcohol of Len de l'El. Wine styles Despite the allowance of Sauvignon blanc to fulfill the minimum AOC requirement, Len de l'El can still be found in many white blends from the Gaillac AOC. Len de l'El can ripen to high sugar levels but usually fails to retain the acidity needed to balance the wine and keep it from coming across as flabby.

The screenplay was written by Rodolfo Sonego. Synopsis An aging and wealthy American woman journeys to Rome each year with her chauffeur George to play the card game scopone with destitute Peppino and his wife Antonia. The annual scenario remains unchanged: she donates the initial stakes so they can play, then ultimately wins the game, shattering the couple's dream of scoring a victory and improving their lot in life. Eventually their daughter Cleopatra seeks revenge on her parents' behalf. Production notes The film's Italian title is Lo Scopone Scientifico. Bette Davis was in the midst of a three-week vacation at the health spa La Costa in Carlsbad, California when she received the script. On 24-hour notice, she flew to Rome for filming. It wasn't until the first day of shooting she learned the dialogue was to be recorded in Italian. This was the third on-screen pairing for Davis and Joseph Cotten.

Life Lopes was the eldest son of Sir Ralph Lopes, 2nd Baronet, by his wife Susan Ludlow, daughter of Abraham Ludlow. Henry Lopes, 1st Baron Ludlow, was his younger brother. His father, originally Ralph Franco, had succeeded to the estates and title of his uncle Sir Manasseh Masseh Lopes, 1st Baronet, in 1831, and assumed the same year the surname of Lopes in lieu of his patronymic. Both the Lopes and Franco families were of Sephardic-Jewish origins. Lopes was educated at Winchester and Oriel College, Oxford. He unsuccessfully contested Westbury in 1853, but was returned to Parliament for the same constituency in 1857. In 1868 he was elected for Devonshire South, defeating Lord Amberley. In Parliament he was the member of a group including Henry Chaplin, Albert Pell and Clare Sewell Read, that supported farming interests, and was chairman of the Agricultural Business Committee. He was appointed High Sheriff of Devon for 1857. In 1874 Lopes was appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty in the second Conservative administration of Benjamin Disraeli, a post he held until the government fell in 1880. Bad health forced him to decline the post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury in 1877. His health also forced him to leave Parliament in 1885. The same year he was sworn of the Privy Council but declined a peerage. He was later an Alderman of the Devonshire County Council from 1888 to 1904. He was also for many years a Director of the Great Western Railway. He was greatly interested in scientific farming, and completely rebuilt his Maristow estate. Lopes married firstly Bertha, daughter of John Yarde-Buller, 1st Baron Churston. They had one son and two daughters. After her death in 1872, he married secondly Louisa, daughter of Sir Robert Newman, 1st Baronet. There were no children from this marriage. Lady Lopes died in April 1903. Lopes survived her by five years and died in January 1908, aged 89. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his only son Henry, who was created Baron Roborough in 1938.

The gene (opd, for organophosphate-degrading) that codes for the enzyme is found in a large plasmid (pSC1, 51Kb) endogenous to Pseudomonas diminuta, although the gene has also been found in many other bacterial species such as Flavobacterium sp. (ATCC27551), where it is also encoded in an extrachromosomal element (pSM55, 43Kb). Organophosphate is the general name for esters of phosphoric acid and is one of the organophosphorus compounds. They can be found as part of insecticides, herbicides, and nerve gases, amongst others. Some less-toxic organophosphates can be used as solvents, plasticizers, and EP additives. The use of organophosphates accounts for approximately 38% of all pesticide use globally.  Gene  Bacterial isolates capable of degrading organophosphate (OP) pesticides have been identified from soil samples from different parts of the world. The first organophosphate-degrading bacterial species was isolated from a soil sample from the Philippines in 1973, which identified as Flavobacterium sp. ATCC27551. Since then, other species have demonstrated to have OP-degrading abilities, such as Pseudomonas diminuta (isolated from US soil sample), Agrobacterium radiobacter (isolated from Australian soil sample), Alteromonas haloplanktis (isolated from US soil sample), and Pseudomonas sp. WBC-3 (isolated from Chinese soil sample). The capacity to hydrolyze organophosphates is not unique to bacteria. A few fungi and cyanobacteria species have been found to also hydrolyze OPs. Moreover, through sequence homology searches of whole genomes, several other bacterial species were identified that also contain sequences from the same gene family as opd, including pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli (yhfV) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The gene sequence encoding the enzyme (opd) in Flavobacterium sp. ATCC27551 and Pseudomonas diminuta is highly conserved (100% sequence homology), although the plasmids where the genes are found have very different sequences apart from a 5.1Kb conserved region where the gene is found. A closer look on the organization of the opd gene from Flavobacterium suggests a potential transposon-like architecture, which accounts for the widespread distribution of the gene among other microbial species that might have occurred through lateral DNA transfer. The opd gene is flanked by transposition insertion sequences, characteristic of Tn3 family of transposons. Moreover, a transposase-like sequence (homologous to TnpA) and a resolvase-like sequence (homologous to TnpR) were also identified in regions upstream of the opd gene, which are characteristics of class II transposons such as Tn3. Furthermore, another open reading frame was identified downstream of opd and encodes a protein that further degrades p-nitrophenol, one of the byproducts of OP degradation. This protein is believed to work as a complex with PTE, since a dramatic increase in activity is observed when PTE is present. Therefore, the characteristic architectural organization of the opd gene region suggests that different species acquired the gene through horizontal transfer through transposition and plasmid transfer.  Protein   Structure  Phosphotriesterase (PTE) belongs to a family metalloenzymes that has two catalytic Zn2+ metal atoms, bridged via a common ligand and coordinated by imidazole side chains of histidine residues that are clustered around the metal atoms. The protein forms a homodimer. The overall structure consists of an α/β-barrel motif, also present in other 20 catalytic proteins. The active sites of these proteins is located at the C-terminal portion of the β-barrel, which is where the active site of PTE is also located. Reaction schematic of enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of paraoxon into diethyl phosphoric acid and p-nitrophenol.  Catalysis  Catalysis of organophosphates occurs via a nucleophilic substitution with inversion of configuration (SN2 mechanism) about the phosphorus centre of the substrate. In the active site, the metal cations aid in catalysis by further polarizing the P–O bond of the substrate, which makes it more susceptible to a nucleophilic attack. Furthermore, a basic residue abstracts a proton from a water molecule, and the hydroxide ion produced bridges the two divalent cations and acts as the nucleophile. The OH− then attacks the phosphorus centre of the substrate, followed by a proton transfer event. The P–O bond is broken, and the products are released from the active site. The turnover rate (kcat) of phosphotriesterase is nearly 104 s−1 for the hydrolysis of paraoxon, and the products are p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphoric acid. Minimal kinetic model for hydrolysis of organophosphates (S) by enzyme PTE (E)  Kinetics  The kinetic model proposed consists of a reversible binding step that takes place between the enzyme and the substrate, and the formation of the Michaelis complex (ES). An irreversible step follows, when the P–O bond is cleaved and the transient enzyme + product (EP) complex is formed. Lastly, the products are released and the free enzyme (E) is regenerated.  Species  Phosphotriesterase is present in two species, Pseudomonas diminuta and Flavobacterium sp. ATCC27551. Other gene variants that also encode organophosphate-degrading enzymes are present in other species. The list includes bacterial species such as the radioresistant Deinococcus radiodurans, pathogens Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis, the anaerobic bacterium Desulfatibacillum alkenivorans, the thermophilic bacteria Geobacillus sp. and Thermoanaerobacter sp. X514, Escherichia coli (yhfV) and many other groups of bacteria, and also some Archaea such as Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Schematic diagram of cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas) showing the inner membrane where PTE is anchored and the periplasmic space.  Subcellular localization  Phosphotriesterase is a membrane-associated protein that is translated with a 29 amino acid-long target peptide (Tat motif), which is then cleaved from the mature protein after insertion in the plasma membrane. The protein is anchored to the inner membrane of the cell, facing the periplasm.  Function  The enzyme phosphotriesterase hydrolyzes organophosphate compounds by cleaving the triester linkage in the substrate. Organophosphate compounds that serve as substrates for enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis by PTE. The enzyme has a very broad substrate specificity, and is very efficient in catalyzing the reaction: PTE hydrolyzes paraoxon at a rate approaching the diffusion limit, which indicates that the enzyme is optimally evolved for using this substrate. It acts specifically on synthetic organophosphate triesters and phosphorofluoridates. It does not seem to have a natural occurring substrate and may thus have optimally evolved for utilizing paraoxon and other common agricultural pesticides. The products of the reaction are diethyl phosphoric acid and p-nitrophenol. The latter product is further degraded by an enzyme encoded 750bp downstream of the opd gene, and encodes a 29kDa putative hydrolase that may be involved in degrading aromatic compounds, and works in concert with PTE. This enzyme is homologous to hydrolases in Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas azelaica, Rhodococcus sp., and P. fluorescens. Organophosphates are not toxic to bacteria, but they act as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in animals. Some species of bacteria are also able to utilize organophosphates as a nutrient and carbon source. Environmental significance  Phosphotriesterases are considered a strong candidate biocatalyst for bioremediation purposes. Its wide substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency makes it an attractive target for the potential use of microbes containing the opd gene in detoxifying soils that are toxic due to pesticide overuse. Moreover, organophosphates act as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. The AChE neurotransmitter is a vital component of the central nervous system (CNS) in insects in animals, and the inhibition of the proper turnover of this neurochemical results in overstimulation of the CNS, which ultimately results in death of insects and mammals. As a result, the use of organophosphate-degrading microorganisms is a potentially effective, low-cost, and environmentally friendly method of removing these toxic compounds from the environment.  History  Bacterial species that had the ability to degrade organophosphate pesticides have been isolated from soil samples from different parts of the world. The first bacterial strain identified to be able to hydrolyze organophosphates was Flavobacterium sp. ATCC 27551, found by Sethunathan and Yoshida in 1973 from a soil sample originally from the Philippines. Since then, other species were found to also have organophosphate-degrading enzymes similar to that found in Flavobacterium.

He performed 35 different roles at the Met, mostly from the Italian and French repertories, from 1948 through 1976. His most frequent assignments at the house were as Escamillo in Georges Bizet's Carmen, Marcello in Giacomo Puccini's La Bohème, Valentin in Charles Gounod's Faust, and Ping in Puccini's Turandot.Metropolitan Opera archives He was also an admired interpreter of Mozart roles, establishing himself in the parts of both Guglielmo and Don Alfonso in Così fan tutte and Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro. Most of the roles he portrayed were from the lyric repertoire, such as the title role in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin, but he also sang some heavier roles at the Met like Amonasro in Aïda, Jack Rance in La fanciulla del West and Il conte di Luna in Il trovatore. Although Guarrera did not possess as large of a voice as some of his fellow Met baritones, such as Leonard Warren and Robert Merrill, he managed to carve out a highly successful career for himself at the house through his charismatic stage presence, good looks, and well-focused lyrical tone. He sang at the Met during a \\"golden age of baritones\\" whose members also included Robert Weede, Tito Gobbi, Cornell MacNeil, Sherrill Milnes and Anselmo Colzani. The Times said that, \\"Frank Guarrera was a rare all-rounder, a singer whose competence, versatility, intelligence, good stage presence and the absence of inflated ideas of his own importance made him a valued colleague and the kind of stalwart company member that opera managers dream about.\\"  Early life and career  Frank Guarrera was born in Philadelphia to parents of Sicilian origin. He was first exposed to opera at the Victor Café in South Philadelphia, and his earliest performance experiences were made with his high school's choir. He began his musical studies at the Curtis Institute of Music in his native city, where he was a pupil of Richard Bonelli and Eufemia Giannini-Gregory. He spent two years serving in the United States Navy during World War II, and then returned to the Curtis Institute to complete his studies. Guarrera made his professional debut as Silvio in I Pagliacci, at the New York City Opera in 1947. That same year he appeared at the Tanglewood Music Festival as the voice of the Oracle of Neptune in Mozart's Idomeneo. Shortly after, he won the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air which led to his being offered a Met contract by then general manager Edward Johnson. The competition win also brought him to the attention of conductor Arturo Toscanini, who invited Guarrera to make his La Scala debut as Fanuel in Arrigo Boito's Nerone in 1948. Guarrerra said of the experience of singing Nerone for the first time, > For all I knew, it could have been by Beethoven. I was taken to Toscanini's > studio at NBC. That was Studio 8H, the famous one, and of course his > dressing room was like a huge apartment. We walked into this gorgeous living > room with a grand piano, and there he was, this little guy, with his pince- > nez glasses. After some small talk in Italian, he put his hand on my > shoulder and asked me to sing. So I unbuttoned my collar -- I had no fear > whatsoever -- and I sang. Later, Toscanini's son, Walter, spoke to me. > \\"Well, Mr. Guarrera, my dad would like to invite you to sing at La Scala. > Will you be able to make it? Are you busy?\\" And that's how I made my debut > in Milan. I sang the last two acts of Nerone, fully staged, under Toscanini, > in a program that opened with the Mefistofele prologue. The bass playing the > devil was a young man named Cesare Siepi. Little did I know that someone > recorded that performance. But this thing exists, and if you play it at the > right speed, it's not bad. Following Nerone, Guarrera sang in two more productions at La Scala in 1948, Zurga in a new production of Les Pêcheurs de Perles with Onelia Fineschi, and Manfredo in L'amore dei tre re with Clara Petrella and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. Singing at the Met Guarrera made his Met debut on December 14, 1948 as Escamillo in Bizet's Carmen with Risë Stevens in the title role, Ramon Vinay as Don José, Licia Albanese as Micaela, and Wilfred Pelletier conducting. That role became one of his signature roles at the Met; singing the role a total of 83 times for the company over the next twenty three years, including the premiere of Tyrone Guthrie's critically acclaimed 1952 staging of the opera. His other signature Met roles included Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro, Falke in Die Fledermaus, Figaro in Il barbiere di Siviglia, Ford in Falstaff (which he recorded with Toscanini in 1950), Marcello in La Bohème, and Valentin in Faust. Guarrera sang at the Met for 28 consecutive seasons and was featured in numerous successful new stagings made during the tenure of General Director Rudolf Bing. Some of his more notable portrayals were Guglielmo in the first performances of Alfred Lunt's staging of Mozart's Così Fan Tutte (1951); Malatesta in Dino Yannopoulos's staging of Gaetano Donizetti's Don Pasquale (1955) with conductor Thomas Schippers in his Met debut; Belcore in Nathaniel Merrill's new staging of Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (1960); Ping in Yoshio Aoyama's staging of Turandot (1961); Lescaut in Günther Rennert staging of Jules Massenet's Manon with Anna Moffo in the title role; and Alfio in Franco Zeffirelli's critically acclaimed 1970 staging of Cavalleria rusticana with conductor Leonard Bernstein. In 1960 Guarrera had a significant personal triumph at the Met when he stepped into the title role of Verdi's Simon Boccanegra after the death of Leonard Warren. He said of the experience, \\"I was the cover, and I was it. I had barely learned the part. I got the phone call at my house from Rudolf Bing. The costumes were a little big for me, but I said not to worry. Fold everything up in the back and put in pins. I used one of my capes from Ernani to cover everything. That was a night to remember.\\" Some of Guarrera's other Met roles included: Amonasro in Aida, Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor, Germont in La traviata, Malatesta in Don Pasquale, and the title role in Rigoletto. His last performance in a staged opera at the Met was in the title role of Gianni Schicchi in a new staging by Fabrizio Melano on May 8, 1976. Other career highlights Guarrera was also a regular performer at the San Francisco Opera during the 1950s and 1960s. He made his debut with the company as Amonasro to Herva Nelli's Aida on November 1, 1952. His other roles with the company included, Count di Luna (1952), Tonio (1952), Escamillo (1953, 1959, 1966), Rossini's Figaro (1953), Marcello (1954, 1958), Lord Henry Ashton to Mado Robin's Lucia in Lucia di Lammermoor (1954), Ping (1954), Guglielmo (1956, 1960), Ford (1956, 1966), Sharpless in Puccini's Madama Butterfly (1956), Lescaut in Puccini's Manon Lescaut (1956), various roles in Carmina Burana (1958–1959), Rodrigo in Don Carlo (1958), Manfredo (1959), Silvio (1959), and Rigoletto (1966). He returned to the house after an eight-year absence in 1974. His final performance at the SFO was on November 30, 1974 as Sharpless to Pilar Lorengar's Butterfly and Barry Morell's Pinkerton.San Francisco Opera Archives Guarrera also appeared frequently in Chicago and Los Angeles and made opera appearances in London and Paris. Later life and career Following his retirement from the stage, Guarrera joined the voice faculty at the University of Washington in Seattle through the invitation of former Met colleague Mary Curtis Verna who was then chair of the university's voice department. He taught at the school from 1980 to 1990 with his most successful students being tenor Timothy Mussard and baritone Mel Ulrich. He quit teaching when his wife Adelina suffered a massive stroke, serving as her primary caretaker until her death in 2000. The couple returned to Philadelphia for their final years together and Guarrera remained in the area for the rest of his life. He and his wife had two children together, Dennis and Valerie. He died at his home in Bellmawr, New Jersey, on November 23, 2007, ten days before his 84th birthday. The cause of death was complications from diabetes. Recordings Guarrera is featured on complete opera recordings, including Così fan tutte, Lucia di Lammermoor, opposite Lily Pons, Faust, Ford in Falstaff under Toscanini, and Cavalleria rusticana. He can also be heard on several live broadcasts from the Met, as well as some of the sets issued by the Metropolitan Opera Record Club. Awards and honors Frank Guarrera is honored with a mural painted by Peter Pagast at Broad and Tasker Streets in Philadelphia. The mural, painted in 2003, features Guarrera in several of his famous opera roles, including The Barber of Seville and Escamillo, the bullfighter, in Carmen. References  Sources  * D.

However, in addition to her tug duties, she also served as a picket ship, dispatch boat, supply runner and other duties assigned to her by the Navy.  Constructed in Newburgh, New York, in 1863  Geranium, formerly John A. Dix, was built at Newburgh, New York, in 1863; purchased by the Navy at New York City 5 September 1863; and commissioned at New York Navy Yard 15 October 1863, Acting Ens. G. A. Winsor in command.  Assigned to the blockade as a dispatch boat and light transport  Geranium departed New York 20 October for duty off Charleston, South Carolina, with Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren's South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. Arriving 4 November, for the next 6 months she operated as a picket boat and was frequently employed as a dispatch boat and light transport to such diverse stations as Ossabaw Sound, South Carolina, and St. Johns River, Florida. Occasionally, she transported Admiral Dahlgren during visits to various ships of his squadron.  Expedition to cut off the Charleston and Savannah Railroad  Between 3 and 10 July 1864, Geranium participated in a diversionary expedition up the Stono and North Edisto Rivers south of Charleston, South Carolina, to divert Confederate attention from the Charleston blockade and to cut the important Charleston and Savannah Railroad. She supported the movement of troops under General Birney up the North Edisto River, towing and transporting supplies for the expedition. On 3 July she contacted and engaged a strong Confederate battery at the mouth of the Dawhoo River, a bombardment which Admiral Dahlgren reported was \\"done very handsomely.\\" After completing demonstration operations, she supported the withdrawal of Federal troops from the tidewater islands south of Charleston.  Supporting the Bull's Bay operations  Continuing her picket, dispatch, and transport duties from 12 to 17 February 1865, Geranium participated in joint Army-Navy operations at Bull's Bay north of Charleston, and on the 16th and 17th she supported diversionary amphibious landings which hastened the Confederate evacuation of Charleston the following day. Admiral Dahlgren then ordered her to the mouth of the Santee River, where she supported naval operations against Georgetown, South Carolina, before departing 28 February on a reconnaissance mission up the Santee. With launches Lilly and Eva in tow she ascended as far as Black Oak Island and gained valuable information about the depth and navigability of the river. As a result of this intelligence, General William Tecumseh Sherman's troops could be supplied from transports on the Santee rather than solely by railroad.  Final operations of the war  Geranium remained along the South Carolina coast until after the end of the war. Departing Charleston 17 June, she steamed with and (Admiral Dahlgren embarked) and arrived Washington, D.C. 21 June.  Post-war decommissioning and disposal  Geranium decommissioned there 15 July and was sold 18 October to the U.S. Treasury Department for use In the Lighthouse Service.

In 1988, Forrester's single \\"Uluru\\" was featured on two national commemorative albums by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (the ABC), as \\"the cream of a very rich mix\\" of Australian country music.That's Australia, Larrikin Records, 1988 (produced by ABC television).Music Deli, Larrikin Records, Larrikin LRF 227, 1988 (noting that \\"the Rank Strangers from Melbourne play their own style of contemporary bluegrass\\").\\"Strangers' band with a bluegrass mission\\", The Sun-Herald (Australia), 4 December 1988, p. 140. The ABC observed: \\"Like our landscape, the history of Australia is best told by our poets, and this recording offers a unique slice... of our bushland, our people, our dreams, and our extraordinary sense of humour.\\"The song Uluru tells the story of the Azaria Chamberlain disappearance, one of Australia's most notorious murder mysteries. Forrester based his song on the 1985 book by lawyer colleague John Bryson, Evil Angels (). See Death of Azaria Chamberlain and Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton. Bryson's book became the basis for a major film, A Cry in the Dark, starring Meryl Streep and New Zealander Sam Neill, directed by Australian Fred Schepisi.

Hale shows great technique and a flair for appropriate harmony lines while matching the punch of the mandolin and banjo well.\\" In 1988, the Rank Strangers swept the Australian Gospel Music Awards in Tamworth, New South Wales, winning Best Group, Best Male Vocalist, and Best Composition. In 1989 and 1990, Dust on the Bible and Uluru were finalists (top five) in the overall Australian Country Music Awards (ACMA). The Rank Strangers were edged out in 1989 in ACMA's \\"best new talent\\" category by future country star James Blundell, and in 1990 in ACMA's \\"song of the year\\" category by country legend Smoky Dawson.

Bluegrass Unlimited, the oldest and most influential journal of bluegrass musicNeil V. Rosenberg, in Bluegrass: A History, University of Illinois Press (1985) (), sets out the history of Bluegrass Unlimited (continuously published since its inception in 1966) at pp. 224–227, and thereafter notes (at 263, 278, 280, 285, 299, 315, 329, 334, 344, 354, 362 and 367) its prominence and influence as the oldest of the nationally-distributed bluegrass magazines. As Bill C. Malone observed in Country Music USA, University of Texas Press (2002) (), at p. 542, Bluegrass Unlimited magazine was established by highly-regarded musicians Peter Kuykendall and Richard Spottswood. It is almost exclusively devoted to bluegrass music in the United States and abroad, with occasional reference to old time country music. It is a treasure trove of information on every phase of bluegrass music – biographical articles, discographies, record and book reviews, concert and festival dates, interviews, classified ads, and songs. (based in Warrenton, Virginia), declared that \\"the Rank Strangers have a unique angle on bluegrass music, and ought to be proud of making their own brand of music come out on top in the Land Down Under.\\" BU described Uluru as \\"one of the most intellectually stimulating bluegrass works of recent years, and it cannot be restricted to mere national boundaries.\\" The Rank Strangers were the subject of a feature article in the December 1988 issue of Bluegrass Unlimited. In a 2011 retrospective, BU featured the career of the Rank Strangers' banjo guru Peter Somerville, and recalled Forrester as \\"an excellent songwriter\\" of \\"challenging original material.\\" Britain's country music newspaper, International Country Music News, noting the band's successes at Australia's National Country Music Festival in Tamworth, New South Wales, found the compositions contained \\"archetypal elements of nostalgia, humour and religion\\", as well as themes that were \\"contemporary and Australian in influence.\\"\\"Blue Skies: Roots & Branches\\", International Country Music News (England), January 1989, p. 10. International music critic Eberhard Finke, writing in the German magazine Bluegrass-Bühne, identified the source of some of the compositions: \\"In 1987 when his grandfather died in Illinois, he put his grief into writing songs. Not that they are sad songs – there are swinging happy ones, with plenty of religious overtones that brought him closer to his grandfather's legacy. He tuned his guitar to double drop-D, DADGBD, making the G-run more difficult, but better suiting his words and melodies.\\"\\"The Rank Strangers\\", Bluegrass-Buhne: Old Time & Bluegrass Magazine, 8 Jahrgang, Nr. 46, August–September 1988, pp. 34–35. Music critic Jeff Harford, writing in the Otago Daily Times, reviewed Forrester's 2015–2017 solo material as follows: \\"For every nugget of truth in a great song, a corresponding seam of life experience is commonly found in its writer\\", and \\"Forrester brings a hatful of both to this Americana-folk release. The composer, novelist, poet, academic, and legal advocate for indigenous peoples takes a sideways step from his bluegrass past with the Rank Strangers to deliver a no-frills set that is, for the most part, nothing more than the man, his guitar and harmonica. That his ... originals sit comfortably alongside covers of Bob Dylan, Nanci Griffith and Gillian Welch songs says much about their strength.\\"\\"Album Reviews: Gary Forrester\\", Otago Daily Times, 4 May 2015. Music critic Colin Morris, writing in Wellington's The Dominion Post, wrote that \\"Forrester is a damn fine guitar picker .. with an innate sense of rhythm coupled with fine lyrics and a story to tell. His Rosa Sharon is redolent of Johnny Cash singing Hurt. Seek it out.\\"\\"Wellington Renaissance man Gary Forrester hits the mark with new album\\", The Dominion Post, 11 August 2015. In a 5-star (out of 5) review of Forrester's 2017 double CD, Jeshel, Mike Alexander of The Sunday Star-Times (New Zealand's largest Sunday newspaper) wrote: \\"There's something almost serendipitous about Jeshel Forrester posting his latest album with little or no fanfare. He's one of those people you might meet only to find that beyond the lack of self-important promotion, his life's work, influence and achievements are those of someone who has already left a footprint (as an activist, academic, novelist, poet and musician). As a reference point only, Forrester evokes the ghosts of preelectric Dylan, whose Girl of The North Country he covers, early Johnny Cash and the melodic sensibilities of Willie Nelson and Kris Kristofferson. There are simple narratives on Jeshel, which includes songs from his previous album Alma Rose, such as The Ballad Of Polly Kincaid and Koori Man, where the story is left to leave its own impression, more personal songs such as Rest For The Weary and the almost confessional Black Top Road and a few covers by Dylan, Gillian Welch, Nancy Griffith and Buddy and Julie Anne Miller. Forrester's music is simple and down-to-earth, just straightforward honesty. What surprises is that there are no swines among these 25 pearls.\\"\\"Music Review: Jeshel\\", The Sunday Star-Times, 29 January 2017. James Belfield, the music critic for New Zealand's weekly current affairs magazine, the New Zealand Listener, described Jeshel as a \\"stunning double album of country folk\\", evoking \\"relentless storytelling skills\\" – the \\"easy acoustic strum and fingerpicking drift behind a clear, authoritative voice that tells outlaw country tales the equal of those by Waylon Jennings, Kris Kristofferson, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash.\\"\\"Jeshel Forrester has created a stunning double album of country folk\\", New Zealand Listener, 11 February 2017. Belfield wrote that \\"dates stand out like beacons – the 1866 cavalry massacre in the Battle of the Hundred in the Hand in the Crazy Horse history lesson Hoka Hey, the 1961 tension between the Bible and the indigenous sun dances in Hannah Cried, the 1945 return from war of the doomed Blue Eyed Boy – but it's the realism and vitality of the characters that loom largest.\\" NZ Musician, New Zealand's only magazine devoted to the national music scene, described the 2017 album Jeshel as \\"packed with well-written and performed songs\\", and noted that \\"Forrester has had an intriguing career in and out of the music industry, recording country albums in Australia in the mid-1980s, both as a solo artist and as part of the award-winning Rank Strangers.\\"\\"Jeshel\\", NZ Musician, Vol. 20, No. 2, February/March 2017, p. 31. The \\"stand out\\" songs included \\"Hoka Hey, which tells the story of Crazy Horse, and Bob Dylan's Girl of the North Country.\\" NZ Musician described Forrester's solo compositions as \\"lovely\\" and \\"surprisingly complex\\": \\"With a steely yet gentle voice that at times reminds me of Johnny Cash or Leonard Cohen, Forrester's neatly constructed songs and dulcet tones will lull you along his album's entirety. His lyrics have an aged air, the word choices interesting without being corny or melodramatic. Stories range over a lot of topics and he uses nice rhyme schemes that don't follow his finger patterns. His rhyme and rhythm provide plenty to listen to in an uncomplicated way, the choice of chords, and the mixture of major and minor shapes come together beautifully without being something heard before – despite this being folk music. Choruses build nicely and verses flow down like rivers.\\"\\"Gary Forrester: Alma Rose\\", NZ Musician, Vol. 19, No. 1, June/July 2015, p. 35. An article in the Sunday Star-Times praised the \\"sparseness and emotional directness of the storytelling on the exquisite Jeshel\\", and stated that the songs \\"mesmerisingly weave their own stories.\\" The article referred to the Native American and Aboriginal themes in many of the songs, and quoted Forrester as follows: \\"When I went to law school, I was motivated by Martin Luther King and how the law could be used as a tool for social justice. Working with the Lakota tribe in America was a natural extension of that original thinking ... to do things for people who need the law to be on their side to make any progress.\\" In 2018, Forrester released his third solo album, The Old Churchyard. The Sunday Star-Times rated The Old Churchyard as a 4.5-star album (out of 5), stating that \\"Forrester is a throwback, in the most respectful way, to a time when songwriters had something to say and were armed with just an acoustic guitar and a suitcase full of songs. Think early Bob Dylan or Johnny Cash and a smattering of Glen Campbell or Jim Croce. The likes of them are still around but harder to find in the body electric of contemporary music. What makes Forrester so compelling is, aside from some beautifully accomplished guitar work, that he possess a voice that is melodic, warm and fragile.\\"\\"Listening Post: Jeshel Forrester, The Old Churchyard\\", The Sunday Star-Times, 10 June 2018. Noting Forrester's background as \\"academic, poet, lawyer, nomad, activist, author and troubadour,\\" the review found that he \\"seamlessly weaves his life experiences\\" into his songs with words that are \\"timely and universal, touching on themes such as domestic abuse, unrequited love, and personal anguish.\\" NZ Musician magazine declared that The Old Churchyard was \\"in the same vein as late-career Johnny Cash – bare bones recordings of a bared heart.\\"Turkby, Bing, Jeshel Forrester's The Old Churchyard https://nzmusician.co.nz/music/jeshel-forrester-the-old-churchyard/ NZ Musician noted that Forrester's Martin D-28S guitar \\"sounds almost like a Carter Family autoharp on [the title track], lending the song a back-porch authenticity. The original songs really tell a story, a la Cohen, Dylan, or Skyscraper Stan. The key to this collection is the premise of a stroll through a rural graveyard populated by the spirits of friends, family and imagined persons of influence. The songs are a deliberate throwback in time, with the freedom to pen a fresh, mostly American mid-west history to the names found on those gravestones. Overall, the tone is downbeat, often just flat-out sad and weary. But there’s also a little dark humour. For example, in the song \\"Leo & Sam,\\" Forrester conjures old cautionary epics such as Frankie and Johnny. Given the sparseness of his musical arrangements, it's a testimony to the allegorical lyrics and appeal of Forrester's voice that listener interest is easily maintained throughout.\\" David Thorpe, writing in the McLeod Newsletter, agreed: \\"Accompanying himself on a Martin D-28S guitar, impeccably picked and sounding effortless, Jeshel's voice is wizened and smooth, the songs varied but of a consistent quality, from gentle love songs to ballads and traditional songs.Thorpe, David, The Old Churchyard by Jeshel Forrester, https://www.mcleodsbooks.co.nz/pages/513-Newsletter In 2018, Forrester joined with Talei Shirley to form The Dunning-Kruger Effect, an acoustic duo, which recorded the album, \\"... and with no craven.\\" (The Dunning-Kruger Effect, in psychology, is a cognitive bias in which people of low ability have delusions of superiority, and mistakenly assess their abilities as greater than they are.) The album features historical songs from ancient England, Ireland, Scotland, and Scandinavia, as well as idiosyncratic versions of more recent folk songs. Mike Byrne of the McLeod Newsletter described \\"... and with no craven\\" as \\"melancholic and elegaic ... The delivery of these songs is near perfect. Talei has a gentle and cadenced voice, and the guitar accompaniment is intimate and knowing.\\"Byrne, Michael, And With No Craven by The Dunning Kruger Effect, https://www.mcleodsbooks.co.nz/pages/513-Newsletter On 26 April 2020, while in isolation during New Zealand's COVID-19 lockdown, Forrester put together a new solo acoustic album of 11 original songs and 2 covers, for non- commercial release on the Bandcamp online music streaming website.jeshelforrester.bandcamp.com During the lockdown, the only available recording device at his lakeside cabin was a cell phone, so the new collection of songs was titled \\"The Covid Phone Album.\\"  Novels, poetry, biography, memoir, and stories  Forrester at the tomb of French novelist Sidonie- Gabrielle Colette, Cimetière du Père-Lachaise, Paris, 2012 Following the demise of the Rank Strangers in the 1990s, Forrester turned to writing novels and poetry, with a focus on music and family. Houseboating in the Ozarks (Dufour Editions, 2006), which includes fictional accounts of a bluegrass band, is the story of a circular journey through the American Midwest, with reflective detours to Australia, South America, Japan, and Italy. Houseboating in the Ozarks meanders through tribal and Western spiritual traditions, including those of Aboriginal Australia and Lakota sundances in Green Grass, South Dakota, led by Yuwipi medicine man Frank Fools Crow. The St. Louis Post- Dispatch found Houseboating in the Ozarks idiosyncratic but engaging: an autobiographical \\"extended meditation on the difficulty of preserving familial and social memory, and sustaining and transmitting values and culture in our mobile, throwaway society.\\" A 2012 review of Houseboating said that \\"one of the many wonders of the book is that [the main character's] two kids become real people capable of influencing the outcome of the trip. They grab him by the heart and throw him around. They are bright, funny, and embody their own kind of irony that meshes with Dad's . . . a wonderful, smart, sad book.\\"\\"Guest Essay\\", Emerging Writers Network, 6 June 2012, http://emergingwriters.typepad.com/emerging_writers_network/2012/06/national- short-story-month-guest-post-by-philip-f-deaver.html Lawyers and Poetry described Houseboating in the Ozarks as \\"autobiographical in the sense that Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is about the life of Robert Pirsig.\\" His second novel, The Connoisseur of Love, was published in New Zealand in 2012. This novel contains 12 meditations – a dozen episodes from the endgame of Peter Becker, Wellington's self-styled \\"connoisseur of love.\\" Peter is not quite at home in his adopted city of Wellington, but there is no place on earth he would rather be. He is a creature of routine, an eccentric public servant, estranged from his only child Katrin and his ex-wife Sylvia. Alone, he stalks Wellington's second-hand shops and cafés, bicycles through its streets and lanes, battles on its tennis courts, and performs his music – never quite connecting with anyone or anything. FishHead: Wellington's Magazine described The Connoisseur of Love as a \\"comprehensive love song\\" to New Zealand's capital city, which \\"exudes Wellington.\\" According to FishHead, \\"it's not just a novel about Wellington, it's a novel for Wellington.\\" A review in the Emerging Writers Network declared Connoisseur to be \\"smartly written in Forrester's straightforward clear sentences which have always had the echo of Vonnegut\\", and that the novel created \\"a unique point of view that is so broad it is at once a Gordian knot of irony, a psychological landscape, and a state of mind.\\" In a feature article in Wellington's Dominion Post newspaper, Forrester was described as \\"a lawyer, public servant, bluegrass musician, and author of a novel set in Wellington. But on paper it's being a writer that counts.\\"\\"The Outsiders: An American public servant living in Wellington has written a novel about a European public servant living in Wellington – It is definitely not biographical\\", Wellington (NZ) The Dominion Post, 19 May 2012 (\\"Weekend Magazine\\"). The Dominion Post article captured Peter Becker's sense of alienation, observing that Forrester \\"made Peter Becker up and planted him as an outsider in Wellington, stumbling through familiar places and unsatisfactory relationships – Peter Becker is an alien in Wellington. He doesn't pretend to be a Wellingtonian. He has his nose pressed against the glass.\\" The Germans have a word for Peter Becker's underlying sense that all is not well: Torschlusspanik – literally, \\"gate-closing panic\\" – or in Peter's case, the quiet angst of aging as life's options narrow. Not that long ago, he seemed to have all the time in the world; now his world is shrinking, and grace has not arrived. Begotten, Not Made, Forrester's third novel, recounts the travels of a wandering musician and his deaf sidekick, shuffling along on a doomed walking marathon from New York to San Francisco in the 1920s. A lengthy extract from Begotten, Not Made was published in 2007 by the University of Nebraska Press, in Scoring from Second,Scoring from Second: Writers on Baseball. ed. Philip F.

Begotten, Not Made is written \\"entirely in free verse in the voice of a demented Brer Rabbit.\\" Forrester's fourth novel, More Deaths than One, was published in 2014 in a special edition of The Legal Studies Forum, a journal established by the American Legal Studies Association to promote humanistic, critical, trans- disciplinary legal studies, and featuring works of poetry, essays, memoirs, stories, and criticism.The Legal Studies Forum, Volume XXXVIII, No. 2, West Virginia University (2014). More Deaths than One is a picaresque journey from New Zealand to America, in search of the Central Illinois roots of the late novelist David Foster Wallace, the 21st century cultural paradigm known as Metamodernism, and the meaning of life. According to the New Zealand writer and poet Jillian Sullivan, More Deaths than One \\"is amazing; so beautifully cadenced and such clear, intelligent writing. It reads like a classic. It is one man's honest and vulnerable take on life (and an intelligent, educated, thoughtful take).\\" Poems from Forrester's 2009 New Zealand book of verse, The Beautiful Daughters of Men: A Novella in Short Verse from Tinakori Hill, have appeared in prominent journals including the South Dakota Review, Poetry New Zealand, JAAM (Just Another Art Movement), the Earl of Seacliffe Art Workshop, and Voyagers: A New Zealand Science Fiction Poetry Anthology.

The Herald-Whig's review observed that Harry Forrester, coach of the men's basketball team at Quincy College (now Quincy University) from 1954 to 1957, \\"eventually earned as much respect for his decision to play five black players as he did for leading the Hawks to their first national tournament appearance.\\" The Herald-Whig's review noted that \\"Harry Forrester did not spend much time in Quincy, but it's safe to say his impact will be remembered forever\\", recalling that his landmark coaching decision \\"came at the height of racial insensitivity in the mid-to-late 1950s and was a full decade before Texas Western (now UTEP) started five black players in what is now the NCAA Division I national championship game. A movie was made about that Texas Western team, but outside of Quincy, only a handful of people to this day realize history was first made [by Forrester and his players] in West-Central Illinois.\\" A review of Blaw, Hunter in the Effingham Daily News observed that most of the memoir takes place in the first half of the twentieth century \\"in the small slice of Illinois centered in Montgomery and Christian counties – in towns like Raymond, Harvel, and Morrisonville\\", but that Forrester's memoir also \\"reaches back to the 16th century and his Melungeon ancestors.\\"Grimes, Bill, \\"Former St A coach's son pens memoirs: short time in Effingham creates lasting memories\\", Effingham Daily News, 24 July 2012.

The Seventh Circuit in Cavalieri further held that the police were not entitled to \\"qualified immunity\\", as the law regarding \\"deliberate indifference\\" had been established before the attempted suicide, so the police were on notice that their conduct was unconstitutional.

It is located in the town centre of Reading in the English county of Berkshire. It is a few yards from the similarly named, but much older Minster Church of St Mary the Virgin. In 1798, there was a disagreement between the Bishop and the congregation of St Giles' Church in nearby Southampton Street. Many of the congregation left and founded a new chapel in Castle Street, on the site of Reading's old gaol. This chapel eventually became the Church of St Mary, Castle Street. The church is a Grade II* listed building. The original 1798 building was a simple Georgian building, but in 1840 the present hexastyle portico in Corinthian style was added by local architect and builder Henry Briant. The frontage is rendered in stucco while the capitals of the portico are probably formed of Coade stone. The church has one of Reading's best church interiors, with a late-18th-century gallery in 5 bays with marbled Doric ground floor and Ionic gallery columns. There is a modillion cornice to the coved central ceiling and a small projecting chancel with a bay for the mid-19th-century organ. The instrument, by Vowles of Bristol, is dated 1870, and was moved to St Mary's from Bristol in 1987. The church used to be lit by two mid-19th-century cast iron chandeliers. Today the church forms part of the Church of England (Continuing), a small group of four congregations outside the Church of England, self-identified on their website as \\"evangelical, reformed, Anglican\\".
