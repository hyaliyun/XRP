Wyatt is the founder and Chairman of Wyatt Technology, located in Santa Barbara, California. He is known for contributions to laser light scattering, more specifically the physics of the inverse scattering problem and for commercializing analytical methods and instruments involving laser light scattering, which are widely used in academia, industry, and government. Early life and education Wyatt did undergraduate work at the University of Chicago, (B.A., 1952; B.Sc., 1954), and Christ's College, Cambridge. He received his M.S. from the University of Illinois in 1956 and his Ph.D. from Florida State University in 1959, where he first worked on the inverse scattering problem. His Ph.D. work involved the development of a non‚Äëlocal nuclear model of the scattering of neutrons by nuclei. He was nominated by the National Academy of Sciences in 1965 as one of sixteen possible candidates for the first Scientist-Astronaut Selection Program in the United States. Career As a graduate student, Wyatt worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. During the 1960s, he worked for the Aeronutronic division of Ford Motor Company, General Research Corporation in Santa Barbara, California, and the defense contractor EG&G.; Wyatt founded his first company, Science Spectrum, Inc., in 1968. The company developed several instruments that could be used to study the inverse scattering problem. They applied light-scattering techniques to the detection of biological weapons and the monitoring of food quality. These early instruments used a traditional single detector to scan a range of scattering angles. Shortly before the closure of the company in 1982, Wyatt developed an instrument for multi-angle light scattering (MALS) in which a glass capillary containing a sample was surrounded by an array of detectors. Wyatt then founded Wyatt Technology Corporation to develop and sell laser‚Äëbased scientific instruments for light scattering and particle size measurement. His instruments are used worldwide by universities, government agencies, the biotech industry and pharmaceutical companies. Wyatt's instruments are used in a wide variety of fields. Laser particle analysis has been applied to wine and to cleaning products. The U.S. Government has supported work on the identification of bioterrorism threats such as airborne bacteria and metabolic poisons or carcinogens in drinking water. Wyatt's instruments are used for protein analysis by biopharmaceutical companies such as Amgen. They are used for detection of drug and pesticide residues in meat, and monitoring for possible toxicity of AZT and antineoplastic drugs in patients. Nobel prize winner Robert H. Grubbs uses them to study polymers. They are also used to monitor smog and fly ash, and identify effective antibiotics to counter bacterial infections. Wyatt has published over seventy publications, including books. He has at least ninety domestic and foreign patents related to laser light scattering and other technologies. Wyatt served as the 2012-2013 Chair of the American Physical Society's Forum on Industrial and Applied Physics. Wyatt also served as the 2018-2019 Chair and 2016-2017 Vice Chair of the American Physical Society‚Äôs Group on Instrument and Measurement Science.

Ezekiel is the leader of The Kingdom, a community of survivors terrorized by a vicious group called the Saviors. Other communities including The Hilltop and the Alexandria Safe-Zone suffer the same subjugation. The communities, led by Ezekiel, Maggie at The Hilltop, and Rick at Alexandria, team up in an all-out war against the Saviors and their leader, Negan. Ezekiel has a loyal pet tiger, Shiva, that he saved from the zoo in the early days of the apocalypse when he was a zookeeper. Although Shiva can be deadly to Ezekiel‚Äôs enemies, she is not a threat to The Kingdom‚Äôs peaceful residents and guests. Instead, Ezekiel rules by the consent of his community, who believe in his charismatic leadership skills and ability to keep them safe. In the comics, Ezekiel enters into a romantic relationship with Michonne, while in the show he instead marries Carol. Appearances =Comic book series= Ezekiel, referred to as \\"King Ezekiel\\" by his fellow citizens, is the leader of a community known as The Kingdom. Ezekiel was formerly a zookeeper and has known his pet tiger, Shiva, since she was born. At some point, Ezekiel meets and forms a friendship with Paul \\"Jesus\\" Monroe, who invites his community to join a trading network that includes The Hilltop community that Jesus belongs to. Ezekiel later discovers the Saviors are threatening and harassing the other communities in the trade network in exchange for supplies and possibly sees how vicious their leader, Negan really is (despite the truce offered by the Saviors). Ezekiel bides his time and waits for the opportune moment to strike back against the tyrant. The opportunity Ezekiel is waiting for finally comes when Jesus brings Rick Grimes to meet him and passes on the information they have regarding the Saviors' strength and the location of their main base of operations. During the war, Ezekiel starts a relationship with Michonne. Two years after the war against the Saviors ends, Ezekiel and Michonne break up, but Ezekiel is confident about starting their relationship again. However, he and 11 other people are decapitated by Alpha during the conflict with the Whisperers.The Walking Dead #144 (Volume 24) =Television series= Backstory Prior to the outbreak, Ezekiel was a zookeeper in D.C. as well as a stage actor. At some point he met Shiva, a tiger cub who was injured in her exhibit. Ezekiel cared for and befriended Shiva and formed a strong bond with her. When the walker outbreak began, Ezekiel returned to the zoo and freed Shiva with the two being together ever since. Ezekiel subsequently founded a community known as The Kingdom which grew to be a thriving community, lush with food and comfort. To better inspire his people, Ezekiel began referring to himself as King Ezekiel and took on the mannerisms of a benevolent and generous feudal king (going so far as to speak in Shakespearean tone and form). He also formed a court of advisers to help him manage The Kingdom which include seasoned survivor Richard, his personal attendant and bodyguard Jerry, and Benjamin, a young survivor who was the son of a good friend of Ezekiel's. Season 7 Ezekiel is first introduced to the series in the episode \\"The Well\\", when Morgan Jones and Carol are brought to the Kingdom by his people to give medical attention to Carol. When Carol awakens, Morgan introduces her to Ezekiel and his pet Bengal tiger Shiva. Ezekiel's quasi-Shakespearean manner of ruling leaves Carol quietly incredulous. When Ezekiel asks what she thinks of his sanctuary and him, she feigns enthusiasm (telling him, \\"It's amazing!\\"), and refuses his offer of fruit, stating that pomegranates aren't worth the trouble. Morgan, having swiftly gained Ezekiel's confidence, is taken out with Ezekiel's inner circle to perform a seemingly pointless task: herd a group of wild pigs into a barn far outside the Kingdom, where they feed on walkers. Ezekiel asks Morgan about his combat skills, as he sees Morgan is capable of using a staff, and asks him to train one of his men, Benjamin. After hesitating, Morgan agrees. Ezekiel brings Morgan and Benjamin to a secret meeting with the Saviors, who are given the walker-fed pigs, now slaughtered, as part of their tribute from the Kingdom. One of the Saviors, Jared, tells Richard the Saviors are letting the Kingdom off easy by taking only eight pigs, to which Richard replies: the Saviors are the ones being let off easy. Jared attacks Richard, and Ezekiel makes them break up the fight. The leader of the Saviors group tells Jared to stop only after Jared has hit Richard a few times. The Saviors leave and say they will want produce next time, or Richard will be the first to die. During the night, Carol is picking fruit as she prepares to leave town quietly, and Ezekiel catches her. He explains that he realized Carol's innocence was just an act but wonders how Carol could survive, and wants to know where she originally came from. After a few moments, Ezekiel slowly drops his guard and reveals that he was a zookeeper and amateur actor. He tells her that he developed the \\"King Ezekiel\\" persona so that the people would have someone to follow and to emphasize that there is still good in the world. Carol still wishes to leave, so Ezekiel suggests that she live in the abandoned house she passed on the way to the Kingdom, so that she could \\"go and not go\\". She agrees to this arrangement. Morgan takes Carol out to the house, tells her to take care of herself, and returns to the Kingdom. Later, she gets a visit from Ezekiel and Shiva. Ezekiel once again offers her a pomegranate causing Carol to smile. In the mid-season premiere \\"Rock in the Road\\", Ezekiel is shown to be friends with Hilltop scout Paul Rovia, aka \\"Jesus\\". Jesus introduces Ezekiel to Rick Grimes, the leader of Alexandria, another community forced to serve the Saviors. Rick implores Ezekiel to join their fight against the Saviors as only together can they succeed. Ezekiel takes the night to ponder his decision, but ultimately decides against open conflict with the Saviors as he refuses to endanger his people's lives. He does, however, allow Rick's friend Daryl Dixon to stay in the Kingdom to hide from the Saviors. Ezekiel appears in episode \\"New Best Friends\\" when the Saviors arrive for their offering. When Jared continues to insult Richard, the two draw guns on each other and Morgan and Ben are forced to stop further violence. Ezekiel later chastises Benjamin for acting hasty as violence must be reserved as a last resort. In the episode \\"Bury Me Here\\", Ezekiel, Morgan, Ben, Richard and several others find a roadblock en route to their meeting with the Saviors. They then find a grave reading bury me here with Ezekiel claiming that it is only luck that the world has not driven them all insane, though Ben credits Ezekiel with keeping them together. They arrive to find that their load of fruit is short of the required amount, causing Jared to shoot Ben. They bring him to Carol's, but despite their best efforts, Ben dies. When they meet the Saviors to settle their debt Morgan attacks and kills Richard, strangling him to death. He reveals that Richard discarded a fruit on purpose in an effort to start a war with the Saviors. Ezekiel shown to be enraged at Richard's betrayal while shocked at Morgan's brutality (though he still attempts to bring him back). Carol later goes to the Kingdom and offers Ezekiel her condolences before stating that it is time to fight; Morgan, wishing to be alone, temporarily stays at Carol's house. Ezekiel agrees. In the season finale \\"First Day of the Rest of Your Life\\", Ezekiel leads Carol and a group of Kingdom fighters to Alexandria to accept Rick's alliance. They encounter Morgan along the way, and Ezekiel convinces him to march with them. Ezekiel's arrival proves timely; their group arrives at Alexandria just as Negan is about to execute Carl. Ezekiel and Shiva charge into battle, killing numerous Saviors and helping drive off the Saviors. The episode ends with Ezekiel standing beside Rick and Maggie Greene as the Kingdom, Hilltop and Alexandria pledge their aid to each other. Season 8 In the season premiere \\"Mercy\\", as Rick prepares for war against Negan, Ezekiel commits his own soldiers from the Kingdom, and provides rousing speeches to his men at Kingdom and later to the combined group prior to their first attack. After their initial assault on Sanctuary, resulting in a large walker horde that prevents the Saviors from leaving or entering, Rick's army breaks into several groups to attack other Savior strongholds. In the following episode \\"The Damned\\", Ezekiel, alongside Carol, leads forces most of Kingdom soldiers, clearing out all but one Savior at a stronghold. The solitary Savior escapes, but Ezekiel orders his group to give chase, fearing he will warn a nearby stronghold. With Shiva's help, the solitary Savior is stopped in time. In the episode \\"Monsters\\", since they are close to another stronghold but still undetected, Ezekiel decides to launch an attack, despite not being in Rick's plan and against Carol's caution. The attack goes better than expected, with no losses to the Kingdom forces. As they are celebrating, Savior forces hidden in a nearby building fire on the group with a heavy machine gun, killing most of the Kingdom forces instantly; the few not yet hit rush to protect Ezekiel. In the episode \\"Some Guy\\", Ezekiel crawls out from the pile of corpses with a limp foot, aghast at the bodies around him that are starting to reanimate. Ultimately he is saved by Jerry, who remains a loyal follower, and Carol, who dealt with the Savior attackers. They struggle towards the Kingdom, but Ezekiel is broken both physically and emotionally, and tells them to leave him behind, no longer worthy of being their king. Shiva arrives to fend off walkers that are about to attack Ezekiel, but the walkers eventually overwhelm the tiger, and Ezekiel can only look on in anguish as his companion is fed upon. The three eventually make it to Kingdom, and Ezekiel cannot come to say anything to the families of his soldiers, and walks off in silence. In the episode \\"The King, the Widow, and Rick\\", Ezekiel has secluded himself in his home, refusing to allow others to see him. Carol is able to approach Ezekiel and tries to encourage him to take up leadership again, even if it just maintaining his act, but Ezekiel remains reluctant to participate and urges her to lead the Kingdom. In the mid-season finale \\"How It's Gotta Be\\", when his community is invaded by the Saviors and they demand to know where Ezekiel is hiding, he allows himself to be caught soon afterwards, so his people may escape.https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/walking-dead-recap-season-8-midseason- finale-1202635498/ In the mid-season premiere \\"Honor\\" Ezekiel is kidnapped by the saviors commanded by Gavin, but its plans to take it to the Sanctuary are frustrated by Carol and Morgan of successful way manage to annihilate their followers and rescue Ezekiel, when Gavin flees Morgan catches him but Ezekiel with Carol tries to convince him not to kill him, Morgan insists he has to, but before he can, a fighting stick pierces Gavin's throat, killing him and Henry is revealed to be the killer, shocking Carol and Morgan. Ezekiel soothes Henry and tells him not to look at Gavin's body. Carol berates Henry for not staying behind and disobeying her, but Ezekiel assures Henry that everything will work out. \\"All will be resolved\\" he tells him. In the next episode \\"Do Not Send Us Astray\\", Ezekiel and his community move to Hilltop to avoid retaliation from the saviors, Henry wants to join the fight, but Ezekiel orders him to defend Hilltop from inside and make the guard, when the Simon's convoy, Daryl leads them through the gate, the people of Hilltop block the convoy with a bus and Ezekiel and all open fire on the rescuers. The battle begins and the rescuers succeed in wounding several members of the militia with weapons contaminated with the blood of a walker, Ezekiel, Carol, Rosita, Tara, Maggie, Daryl, Enid, Jesus, Rick, Carol and others but they manage to survive, due to They manage to turn the tide of the attack of the rescuers as Simon and the remaining saviors flee. Mayhem erupts at dawn inside the Barrington house in Hilltop, as many wounded succumb to the infection and die, because of the savior's contaminated weapons, begin to revive as walkers and attack Ezekiel helps fight the walkers.

It is an \\"abbreviation of \\"H≈çkoku\\" (Â†±Âëä, to report), \\"Renraku\\" (ÈÄ£Áµ°, to inform) and \\"S≈çdan\\" (Áõ∏Ë´á, to consult), and is more memorable as a homonym of h≈çrens≈ç, the Japanese word for \\"spinach\\". It is utilized as a basic business rule in Japan to conduct smooth business communication. The origin of \\"Ho-Ren-So\\" comes from Tomiji Yamazaki who was the ex-president of Yamatana Security firm. In 1982 he started using the term for effective business communication in his firm and it has been widely spread and used throughout Japan through his book, \\"Strengthen your company with Ho-Ren-So\\". Description \\"Hokoku\\" is to report on a process or result of business, from a subordinate to a superior. In Japan, subordinates don't have much authority to make business decisions. Usually the decisions are made by an organization as a whole. Therefore, a subordinate must report everything to their superiors immediately and exactly. It is especially important to report a mistake or a problem immediately because his/her superior has the responsibility for it. \\"Renraku\\" is to inform and notify of facts. One must inform of the facts and decisions to the relevant parties. One should not include one's opinion and guesses. If \\"Renraku\\" is not done or not completed, then it is not possible to control a team. And then, \\"Renraku\\" should be communicated to the people who need it. Finally, \\"Renraku\\" must be done quickly, as its contents might be needed to prepare for the next action. \\"Sodan\\" is to consult or discuss. For example, a superior gives advice to a subordinate, and an employee talks over with their superior about some unnecessary consultation in Japanese business. In Japanese companies, superiors rarely speak to their subordinates, but they actually do want to be asked for their advice or opinion. They want others to think that they can be relied upon, so they feel better if they receive requests for consultation from their subordinates. Pros and cons There are many benefits to incorporating the \\"Ho-Ren-So\\" philosophy. First, if an issue within tasks is reported, it can be resolved quickly because a manager controls it and decides how to resolve it. Next, if information is communicated with team members and it is known to all members of a team, they can take ownership of the schedule and tasks. Finally, if a subordinate proactively asks for information, a decrease of quality will be prevented and likely won't occur again. On the other hand, there are some Cons in \\"Ho-Ren- So\\". First, there are management costs. It is a very time-consuming process, leaving employees with little time to complete their various work assignments. Moreover, and since a subordinate must always wait for instructions from their supervisor, this prevents employees from applying their problem-solving skills on their own, and initiative is prevented by the constant need for managerial input.

He was of Tuyuhun ethnicity. Li is best known for his 940 revolt against the Later Jin, after which he fled to Southern Tang. Later Jin demolished the Southern Tang force sent to receive him, and from this point on Southern Tang never dared to encroach on Central Plains again. Early life Li Jinquan was born in the 880s during the Tang dynasty. Originally a menial servant of the Shatuo general Li Siyuan, Li Jinquan was described as fearless and skilled in mounted archery. As Li Siyuan served the warlords Li Keyong and his son Li Cunxu, Li Jinquan also fought in battles and won military merits. The Shatuo state, known as Jin after the Tang's collapse in 907, became Later Tang in 923. Under Later Tang After Li Siyuan became Later Tang's emperor in 926, he appointed Li Jinquan military commissioner of Longwu (), seated in Jing Prefecture in the western part of the empire. Li Jinquan's governance was greedy and oppressive. Following his recall to the capital Luoyang, he presented dozens of horses to Li Siyuan (then renamed Li Dan) as a gift, followed by another herd a few days later. This shocked the emperor, who questioned him: \\"You must suffer from a plentitude of horses. Why else would you offer so many? Moreover, you serve at Jing Prefecture. How would you characterize conditions there? Surely, you do more than merely trade in horses?\\" Li Jinquan was too ashamed to reply. Li Jinquan later governed Henghai (), seated in Cang Prefecture in the northeast. He was again recalled to the capital to command the \\"Right Guard\\" of the imperial guards at some point. Under Later Jin Later Jin replaced Later Tang in 936, and Li Jinquan retained his position with the imperial guards. On 3 September 937, Wang Hui (), director for defense reserves at An Prefecture, assassinated Zhou Gui (), military commissioner of Anyuan (). Anyuan, seated in An Prefecture, was in the southern part of the empire bordering Wu to the southeast. Later Jin's emperor Shi Jingtang, busily fighting the rebellion of Fan Yanguang in the north, could not afford to battle on two fronts. Therefore, he issued a \\"letter-on-arrow\\" against slaughtering a single person in Anyuan, while also promising Wang Hui governorship of Tang Prefecture if he surrendered. He then sent Li Jinquan with a 1000-man cavalry to Anyuan to induce Wang Hui's surrender, and before Li's departure, admonished him: \\"Do not compromise my credibility!\\". Indeed, Wang was about to flee to Wu, but he was killed by a subordinate before Li Jinquan arrived in An Prefecture. Li arrested hundreds of mutineers and delivered them back to the capital. As Wang Hui had looted An Prefecture for 3 days, many of his officers acquired large numbers of properties. Li Jinquan then executed dozens of such officers to appropriate their wealth for himself. One such officer, Wu Kehe (), cried out before his execution: \\"If you, commander, contravene imperial rescripts to kill surrendering soldiers, then you may not escape peril yourself!\\" Even though Shi Jingtang heard about Li's disobedience, he could not do anything. Instead, to appease Li, he appointed him military commissioner of Anyuan on 11 October 937. In Anyuan, Li Jinquan entrusted a greedy and immoral man named Hu Hanyun ()Hu Hanyun is the name appearing in Zizhi Tongjian and some contemporary documents that have survived. However, some history books call him differently: Shiguo Chunqiu calls him Hu Hanrong (ËÉ°Êº¢Ê¶Æ), while Wudai Shiji calls him Ming Hanrong (ÊòéÊº¢Ê¶Æ). with the day-to-day operations of the military and government. After Shi Jingtang heard of Hu Hanyun's excesses, he sent an honest administrator named Jia Renzhao () to Anyuan to replace Hu. Hu was terrified, so he persuaded Li Jingquan to submit a memorial which claimed that Hu was ill and could not be recalled back to the capital. Pang Lingtu (), who hailed from the same hometown as Li Jinquan, repeated advised Li to appoint Jia Renzhao. Hu Hanyun then sent soldiers to massacre Pang Lingtu's entire family. He also poisoned Jia Renzhao to death. Because Hu Hanyun colluded with the flatterer Zhang Wei (), Li Jingquan knew nothing of his wrongdoings and trusted him more than ever. In summer of 940, Shi Jingtang decided to replace Li Jinquan with Ma Quanjie (). Knowing Jia Renzhao's sons would file court complaints for their father's murder, Hu Hanyun warned Li Jinquan of the possible punishment he would also face in the capital: \\"Formerly, the Son of Heaven summoned me, but you violated imperial orders by refusing to relieve me.\\" Li Jinquan then prepared to rebel. Having heard the news, on 29 June 940, Shi Jingtang named Ma Quanjie the overall commander of the punitive force against Li Jinquan. The soldiers of this force came from 12 prefectures. At that time, Wu had already been replaced by Southern Tang, and Li Jinquan sent Zhang Wei to Southern Tang to offer his surrender. Southern Tang's emperor Li Bian then commissioned a 3000-man force under general Li Chengyu () and Duan Chugong () to receive Li Jinquan from E Prefecture. Li Jinquan and his hundreds of soldiers surrendered without a problem, and Li Chengyu got hold of his women and wealth as well. Feeling overconfident, Li Chengyu disobeyed Li Bian's orders and plundered An Prefecture, acquiring items of \\"gold and silk too numerous to count\\". When the Southern Tang army finally retreated, they were caught up by the Later Jin army. In the bloody two-day battle that followed, Duan Chugong was killed, while Li Chengyu was captured. Ma Quanjie executed Li Chengyu and thousands of Southern Tang soldiers. Li Jinquan managed to escape and it was said once he entered Southern Tang territory, he looked north and shed tears. He received a rather cool reception in Southern Tang. Under Southern Tang Under Southern Tang, Li Jinquan served as the commander general of Tianwei () and military commissioner of Zhenhai () seated in Run Prefecture. In 947, Later Han succeeded Later Jin (with a short period of Liao dynasty interregnum). In 948, general Li Shouzhen (who was under Ma Quanjie's command in 940) rebelled against Later Han in its western parts of the empire and requested help from Southern Tang. General Liu Yanzhen () volunteered to lead an expeditionary force, but Southern Tang's emperor Li Jing considered Li Jinquan more prestigious, so Li Jinquan was named the overall commander of the northern expedition army with Liu Yanzhen assisting him. Li Jinquan considered Li Shouzhen's forces too far to make any coordinated efforts, and as a result the deployment was permanently postponed, even as reports indicated only hundreds of weak Later Han soldiers guarding the northern garrisons. When other generals suggested advancing, Li Jinquan said, \\"Whoever mentions advancing will be executed!\\" It turned out that there was indeed an ambush by Later Han, and when the other generals learned of this that evening, they began to respect Li Jinquan. A month later, Li Jinquan was recalled and sent to Hai Prefecture. Subsequently he received other major posts, until his death in 950 in the Southern Tang capital of Jinling.

He is notable as first chairman of the Labour Representation Committee, the organisation to which the Labour Party traces its origins, as well as for a lifetime of work dedicated to educational improvement for the working class, and to the introduction of a general tax- funded system of old-age pensions. Biography Rogers was born on 27 April 1846 in Whitechapel, London to a working-class family. His father, also Frederick Rogers, was variously a dock labourer, sailor, and linen drapers assistant; his mother Susan Bartrup a laundress. He left school at or before age 10, and after a period as an ironmonger's boy was employed in a stationery warehouse where he learned the skilled craft of bookbinding. His artisanal career for the next forty years was as a bookbinder specialising in vellum- bound accounts books. Rogers was an autodidact who pursued four entwined interests through his life: trades unionism, education for the working-class, journalism, and religion. He was also greatly interested in English literature, and was considered to be extremely well-read - \\"the most scholarly man I know in the Labour movement\\", according to an anonymous writer in a 1909 Railway Review article. Rogers took some pride in having overcome a lack of formal education (and a spinal complaint) in his childhood. He joined the Vellum (Account Book) Binders' Trade Society in the 1870s whilst working for the Co-Operative Printing Society. In this period, he is mainly noted for his interest in the settlement movement and facilitating the education of working people. He acted as secretary from the outset of the University Extension Movement, working in collaboration with Alfred Milner to encourage universities to deliver lectures in 'extension centres' in cities across the UK. His work, in part, gave rise to Toynbee Hall, a university settlement house delivering education to working people, in which Rogers for many years involved himself, acting as vice-president from 1886 onwards. He was active on the London School Board and within working-mens clubs in east-end London. His work in these fields brought him into the society of reformers such as the Samuel and Henrietta Barnett, and Francis Herbert Stead, founder of the Browning Hall. Direct involvement in the English literature teaching at Toynbee Hall facilitated Rogers' introduction to many socially concerned literary figures of the period. He became increasingly active as a journalist from the 1880s, writing for many publications and having a column in the Weekly Dispatch. In this guise he was an early advocate of the formation of an independent Labour party. In 1892 he assumed the presidency of the Vellum (Account Book) Trade Society, it having been damaged by failed industrial action, and held the post for the next 6 years. Involvement in unionism at this level propelled him, later, into two notable occupations. The first was as a Trades Union Congress delegated representative at the February 1900 inaugural meeting of the Labour Representation Committee, which made him their first chairman. The foundation of the LRC is seen as the origin of the British Labour Party. Rogers remained a member of the Committee's executive, acting as treasurer in its third year. The second, from July 1900, was his service as Organising Secretary of the National Committee of Organised Labour (NECL), which worked to encourage the introduction of old-age pensions funded from general taxation - a campaign won in 1909. The Committee arose out of a campaign of meetings organised by F. H. Stead, known to Rogers through his Settlement movement interests. Stead and Rogers dedicated a decade of work, writing pamphlets and books, lobbying parliament and religious leaders, and travelling the length of the country to speak for the cause. Rogers was a signatory in March 1901, with many other trades unionists, of a pamphlet opposing the Second Boer War. In contrast he was a proponent of the need to wage World War I, and acted as a speaker at recruitment rallies. He parted company from his liberal and socialist colleagues in the 1901-6 period over disagreements about the future of education, and later served as a Conservative Alderman on London County Council from 1910-11. Rogers was strong in his religious faith, converting to the Anglo-Catholic movement in the 1890s. His outlook made him additionally useful during his work with the NECL by enabling him to draw support from religious communities for the campaign. His 1903 book, The Seven Deadly Sins, combines his interest in the Christian faith with his great love for Elizabethan literature. Rogers died, unmarried, in 1915; he lived with his parents until 1907, and thereafter with his sister. An obituary noted the contrast between his outside form - \\"strange and blurred\\" - and his character - \\"sound-hearted, sound-tempered, straight, clear, simple, good ... the most companionable of fellow workers, so reliable, so steady, so right.\\" Works Works by Rogers include: *The Art of Bookbinding, 1894 *The Art of Bookbinding Past and Present, 1899 *Old Age Pensions, 1903 *The Seven Deadly Sins, 1907 *Labour, Life and Literature, 1913 His autobiography, Labour, Life and Literature (1913) is identified as his most important writing work by David Rubinstein in his Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry, and was highly commended in a short notice in the Labour History Review which found \\"aspects of his memoirs which lift them well above the average for this class of writing\\".

The original portion of the complex was built in 1878 and was the oldest public school building in Wyoming. It was expanded in 1928 and 1939, and closed as a school in 1979. The civic center provides performing, studio and gallery space for visual and performing arts, as well as office and small business space. History The East Side School was established as a high school in 1878, the oldest purpose-built school building in Wyoming. The cornerstone ceremony was a major public event, and was apparently notable for an absence of public drunkenness on that day. The school was expanded in 1928 and 1939. It became a junior high school when a new high school was built and finally closed in 1978. Plans were immediately put into place to adapt the building as a community center, which opened in 1982. Description The original Italianate brick school had four classrooms on the main level and two above, resembling the first Laramie courthouse. The 1928 expansion was designed by architect Wilbur Hitchcock and was built in a stripped-down Gothic style, with pointed arch accents in limestone panels in an otherwise plain facade. It added classrooms, an auditorium and a gymnasium. The auditorium decoration was unusually detailed, with oil-on-canvas murals tall depicting scenes from Wyoming history. The murals were painted by Florence Ware, whose father Walter E. Ware assisted in the design and took over architectural duties after Hitchcock was killed in a car accident in California. The East Side School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on March 17, 1981 as part of its transition to its current role as a civic center.

Biography Abd-ol-Ghaffar Amilakhori was raised at the Safavid court in Isfahan and was a \\"typical member of the new Georgian converted elite\\". Abd-ol-Ghaffar was a son of Faramarz Amilakhori by his wife Tamar, a great-grandson of King Luarsab I of Kartli. His sister Tamar was a favourite concubine of the Safavid shah Abbas I (r. 1588‚Äî1629). When in 1624, Abbas I married off his granddaughter to the ruler of Kartli, Semayun Khan (Simon II), Abd-ol-Ghaffar's wife was a companion to the bride; Amilakhori and another leading Georgian noble, Zurab, eristavi of Aragvi, entertained the guests of the wedding party on the order of the Safavid-Georgian officer Murav Beg (Giorgi Saakadze). Around the same time, the shah arranged the marriage of Abd-ol-Ghaffar to a daughter of Imam-Quli Khan, a prominent Safavid military and political leader of Georgian descent. According to the contemporary Safavid historian Fazli Khuzani, Abd-ol-Ghaffar was 22-years old at the time of his marriage. While in Kartli, Abd-ol-Ghaffar was known as a champion of the Safavid interests in the country. He further expanded his estates at the expanse of the neighboring noble families, exterminated the Ghazneli and had the environs of Mtskheta ravaged. In 1625/6, Abd-ol-Ghaffar and his wife were captured by the rebellious Georgians and imprisoned at the fortress of Arshi. After the rebels' defeat at the battle of Marabda, Abbas I sent a force to their resque. Upon being informed about this, the rebels sent the two, according to Fazli Khuzani, to the relatives of Abd-ol-Ghaffar himself, as well as those of Allahverdi Khan (the father of Imam-Quli Khan). Amilakhori, thereafter, disappears from historical records.

Uzbek Islamist group Islamic Jihad Union (IJU) claimed responsibility of having used 4.5 tons of explosives for what was described as an \\"enormous blast,\\" and publishing a film of the explosion. Perpetrator C√ºneyt √áift√ßi, the perpetrator, is considered the first suicide bomber to have been born and raised in Germany. Born 1979 in Freising and raised in Ansbach, both in Bavaria, √áift√ßi's father, a founding member of the Ansbach Mill√Æ G√∂r√º≈ü mosque society, sent his son, who was twelve years old, to Turkey. Attending a state-run religious school, √áift√ßi memorized the Quran and started using the name \\"Hafiz\\". After three years, √áift√ßi returned to Ansbach, but later dropped out of school and broke off a vocational apprenticeship. After working a while as an interior decorator and in a McDonald's restaurant, he found an employment at the local Bosch warehouse, where he reportedly had a \\"well paid job\\".

In 2001 √áift√ßi married a woman from a secular Turkish family, who only four years later started wearing a headscarf, when they moved in with his parents. German authorities believe that √áift√ßi's radicalization may have begun in 2001/02, when he came into touch with orthodox Tablighi Jamaat (TJ) movement, frequenting a TJ circle in nearby Pappenheim.

He wrote numerous books, of which his works on grammar were particularly influential.  Life  John Nesfield was born in 1836 and was the son of a cleric from Wiltshire, England. He attended Highgate Grammar School from 1852-1855 and later taught there from 1859-1864. He became a postmaster (holder of a senior scholarship) at Merton College at the University of Oxford. There he earned a BA degree in 1860 and was later promoted to an MA in 1862. Nesfield became the curate of St Michael's Church, Highgate, in Middlesex. He began his career in British India in January 1867. There he served initially as a professor at Presidency College and Krishnagar Government College, both in the Bengal Presidency, before becoming in May 1872 a Director of Public Instruction (DPI) and schools inspector in Lower Burma. The Indian Education Service was not founded until 1896 and thus he was an employee of the provincial government. In his role as a DPI he took on responsibility for administration and policy-making, rather than being purely a teacher. Nesfield transferred from Lower Burma to become DPI in Oudh State in March 1874, then in 1878 became principal of Benares College when the administration of Oudh was subsumed in the newly created North-Western Provinces and Oudh. He joined the inspectorate there in the following year and in 1885 was passed over for promotion to become the province's DPI when, as was not uncommon, the government determined to prefer Edmund White, who was a member of the Indian Civil Service, to an educator. Nesfield objected strenuously to this decision, firing off letters first to the Secretary of State for the province, R. A. Cross, 1st Viscount Cross, and then to Alfred Comyn Lyall, who was the Lieutenant-Governor of the North- Western Provinces and Chief Commissioner of Oudh. When those appeals failed, he wrote also to the Viceroy of India, Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava, but was again rebuffed. He eventually did achieve the promotion when White retired in August 1892. He had been made a Fellow of the University of Allahabad in 1887, the year of its establishment, and retired from India in October 1894. Issues of promotion were not the only thing about which Nesfield complained during his time in India. Education was particularly poorly developed in the North-Western Provinces and in 1882 he asked the province's Education Commission \\"what hope is there of reaching the heart or brain of a man who is educated at a cost of four rupees a year?\\" He was also involved in a dispute that persisted for a while after he retired. There had been investigations regarding whether many of the English and vernacular textbooks prescribed for use in schools of the North-Western Provinces had been contrived so as to provide him with a monopoly on publication. It was eventually agreed that he had acted under the instructions of White, had done so at his own risk, and was providing a much-needed service. He gave the copyrights to a publisher in London after retiring. Nesfield died in 1919. He had married a missionary, Ellen Blumhardt, and the couple had at least one son born while they were in India.  Influence  Nesfield's Manual of English Grammar and Composition = Education = Nesfield's English Grammar: Past and Present was originally written for the market in colonial India. It was later expanded to appeal to students in Britain as well, from young men preparing for various professional examinations to students in \\"Ladies' Colleges\\". Other books on the English language by Nesfield include A Junior Course In English Composition, A Senior Course In English Composition, but it was his A Manual Of English Grammar and Composition that proved really successful both in Britain and her colonies ‚Äî so much so that it formed the basis for many other grammar and composition primers including but not limited to Warriner's English Grammar and Composition, and High School English Grammar and Composition, fondly called Wren & Martin by P. C. Wren and H. Martin. Bibliographer Manfred G√∂rlach is critical, saying of the frequently reprinted English Grammar: Past and Present that \\"it is not quite easy to see how its wordiness, lack of clear structure, mixture of synchronic description and diachronic explanation and often unclear definitions gave the book the immense impact it had\\". = Anthropology = Like Denzil Ibbetson, an administrator of the British Raj, Nesfield believed that the society of the North-Western Provinces in British India did not permit the rigid imposition of an administratively-defined caste construct as Herbert Hope Risley advocated. According to Nesfield, society there was less governed by ideas of caste based on varna and instead was more open and fluid. Tribes, which he considered to be kin-based groups that dominated small areas, were the dominant feature of rural life. Caste designators, such as Jat and Rajput, were status-based titles to which any tribe that rose to social prominence could lay a claim, and which could be dismissed by their peers if they declined. The debate about caste reflected the contemporary debate around topics such as scientific racism and the Aryan invasion theory. Anthropologist Ellen Bal notes that  Works  Nesfield's publications include: *An Essay on the Kanjar Tribe (1882) *On the Results of Primary Education in the North- Western Provinces and Oudh (1883) *Brief View of the Caste System of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh (1885) *The Function of Modern Brahmins in Upper India (1887) *Two Essays on the Mushera Tribe (1888) *English Grammar: Past and Present (1898) *A Junior Course In English Composition, A Senior Course In English Composition *A Manual Of English Grammar and Composition (1898) *English Grammar Series  References  Notes Citations Bibliography    1836 births 1919 deaths Alumni of Merton College, Oxford University of Allahabad faculty History of education in India Administrators in British India Administrators in British Burma Grammarians from England English anthropologists People educated at Highgate School 19th-century English clergy 19th-century English writers 20th-century English clergy 20th-century English writers 19th-century anthropologists 20th-century anthropologists ","title":"John Nesfield"},{"id":"51165024","text":"Ke Apon Ke Por is an Indian Bengali television soap opera which airs on Bengali Entertainment Channel Star Jalsha and is available on the digital platform Hotstar. It premiered on 25 July 2016, and is telecast daily. The show is produced by Boyhood Productions of Surinder Singh, Gurjit Singh and Sushanta Das. The show has been well-received. Ke Apon Ke Por is a family drama series starring Pallavi Sharma and Biswajit Ghosh in lead roles. Bulbuli Panja plays the main antagonist (Tandra), while Ananya Biswas, Arindya Banerjee, Reshmi Sen, Kalyani Mondal, Indranil Chattejee and Simran Upadhyay appear in prominent supporting roles. The show is one of the longest-running and popular serials on Bengali television. Premise The show upholds the plight of Joba who, under circumstances, gets married into the Sengupta family where she used to serve as the maid; and her struggle to become the suitable bride to Param and the worthy daughter-in-law of the Sengupta family. Param stands by Joba, empowering her to complete her studies as well as earn a law degree from a noted university, fulfilling her dream of becoming self- dependent by pursuing her career as a private-practicing lawyer. Joba, however, has to constantly face and overcome various path blocks and hindrances, mainly from Tandra, the Sengupta family's eldest daughter-in-law, who looks down upon Joba as a mere servant, believing her to have no right to rise in social status, and seeks to destroy her as well as the Sengupta family's happiness. Tandra's sister-in-laws, Palak and Mayuri, initially support Tandra against Joba and humiliate her, accusing her of being a gold- digger. Palak's brother Sanjay lusts for Joba, but Param raises his voice preventing him from molesting Joba. Meanwhile, Tandra uses Param's childhood friend Deblina as a pawn to separate Param from Joba, but this backfires as the growing distance between the two gives rise to Param's longing for Joba and they mutually realize their feelings for each other. Finally, Param conveys his love to Joba, and both accept each other as their respective spouse, thus, going against all odds, to completely eliminate the thin line of social difference separating the two till then. Joba also gets Param's younger sister, Tia married to her love interest, Topu and gets Sanjay permanently banished from their family. Joba further gets Param's uncle married to Gouri, a poor and uncultured woman, who is soon revealed to be greedy and as wicked as Tandra, and the two join hands, and together with Palak and Tandra's mother, plot against Joba. Later on, Joba reveals the true intentions of Tandra in front of the family members, leading them to go against her and throw Tandra out of the house. At this, Tandra becomes desperate and vows to neither let Joba nor the Senguptas live in peace and harmony; putting on various acts of repentance, only to get accepted into the family again, her sole intention being to back-stab them. She keeps on plotting various evil tactics against Joba and the Senguptas with her mother and Sanjay. They also involve Joba's cousin, Sanatan (who is a terrorist), in their plan to portray Param as an anti-national in front of the society and in one such bombing, Param supposedly dies, turning Joba mentally unstable. He returns in the disguise of Mr. Srivastav (who comes across the family as Joba's doctor/therapist, taking the help of his brother-in-law, Swapnomoy) to prove his innocence, Sanatan's guilt in the bombings done and to get Joba treated of her ailment. After succeeding in treating Joba's mental state back to normal, Param and Joba, overcome with desire and passion for each other, finally consummate their marriage! The Senguptas go on a trip to Darjeeling, where Tandra, along with Sanjay, plans an accident of Joba, but accidentally their plan results in Tanna losing his speech, and now Tandra, instead, frames Joba for the same. Meanwhile, Mayuri is having an affair with Ani, but Joba helps her understand her mistake and reconnect with Swapnomoy. Palak gets Joba arrested for Tanna's accident and Joba, out of emotional strain, accepts the same and gets jailed. Tanna can't expose Tandra due to his inability to speak while Tandra, now, in Joba's absence, in order to prove herself to be more worthy than Joba as the Sengupta family's daughter-in-law, even goes on to plan her fake pregnancy, just to compete with Joba, who is also going to give birth to Param's child. Tandra adopts the new-born daughter of a slum-dweller (Minoti) and introduces her as her biological daughter in front of the Senguptas, gets Joba's new-born son separated from her and bribes the doctors to officially declare him dead, subduing Joba and disheartening the Senguptas. Moreover, she supplies Param with memory-losing drugs, putting his identity at a stake, while Joba is taken back to jail. Now, Tandra, along with Gouri (Param's wicked aunt), utilizes Joba's absence to re-establish their dominance in the Sengupta household. =5 Years later= Joba gets released from jail and returns to the Sengupta household, which is now fully under Tandra and Gouri's control. Also, a self-proclaimed god-woman Sreelekha has been appointed by Tandra to get Param's memory back. But actually, it is her vicious plan to get rid of Param, by having Sreelekha manipulating him to believe himself and Sreelekha to be die-hard lovers from their previous births, separated by a lady \\"Apala\\", who, as per their story, has reincarnated into Joba, to separate them again. But Joba exposes Sreelekha as a fraud and gradually manages to get Param's memory back. Also, Tanna gets back his speech, and he makes it clear that Sanjay, not Joba, was responsible for his accident. Palak apologises to Joba for all her taunts and mistrust for Joba. They then together search for their long-lost son. Supari, Joba and Param's estranged son has grown up in the slums pick-pocketing. Joba brings him to the Sengupta house, teaches him morals and the difference between right and wrong, and with Param's monitoring, gets him admitted in a school. They then adopt Supari as their son. Later Joba gets to meet Minoti, Tandra's 5-year-old daughter Anu's biological mother, who reveals to Joba that her son is alive. Tandra introduces an impostor child (Baban) as Joba-Param's son. Minoti is killed by Sanjay as per Tandra's plan, however, Joba soon uncovers the mystery behind Baban (actually named Pintu) being an impostor and he is sent back to the slums. They, however, don't get to know who their real child is. Meanwhile, Tandra gets Supari trapped in a crime syndicate disguised as a devotional group of saints, fooling the people to make money out of their sentiments. Joba and Param rescue Supari from the gang and their head, \\"Swami Arpananda\\", and get them arrested. Joba uncovers Tandra's secret regarding Anu being actually Minoti's child and as all of Tandra's crimes are exposed, she is finally arrested, while Sanjay escapes. Tandra is rescued by her boyfriend Dipanjan, who blackmails Joba-Param to open a \\"cheat-fund\\" and hand over to him the money deposited by the people in the same, as well get Tandra bailed, in return for getting to know the real identity of their son. However, soon enough, Joba exposes them to the public as Dipanjan leaves Tandra (flying away from the country) and Tandra, in turn, puts on an act of being paralysed to escape jail punishment, and is accepted back into the Sengupta family, where she while continuing on her act, remains confined in her room, secretly maintaining contacts with Sanjay and her mother. Also, Joba and Param get to know that Supari is indeed their child. Joba also gives birth to a daughter, Koyel. Supari gets paralysed due to interior damage and needs to be treated abroad. 4 years later, after having collected the entire money for the treatment, Joba and Param along with Supari (now renamed Sarthak) fly off to America, with a hesitant Joba leaving Koyel in care of the other Sengupta family member, only for Tandra to use the opportunity to imbibe deep hatred in little Koyel's mind against her parents, especially Joba for prioritizing their son Sarthak than their daughter Koyel. =12 Years later= After 12 years, Koyel, now an 18-year-old, in Joba's absence, has grown up to be a spoilt brat, being addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. She parties with her friends (including Ronnie) who are associated with unholy activities, and are actually fitted by Sanjay, as per Tandra's plan, to further deteriorate Koyel. However, after Joba, Param and Sarthak return from the U.S., getting Sarthak fully treated, Joba takes upon herself her new quest to enlighten Koyel about the harmful lifestyle she is leading and make her passion for rock music and dance as the path for ensuring her progress and mark her return to the mainstream of life and education. Thus she wins her heart back, much to Tandra's chagrin. The Senguptas are now assisted by a girl Itu in the housework, who is very close to Koyel and Joba (who treats Itu as her own daughter). After Tinni's marriage to a high class society entrepreneur Soheli Chowdhury's son Adi, they all go on a trip to Itu's original village, \\"Phultuli\\" where Tandra, with Sanjay's help plans to get Joba's family murdered, but fails again. Anup Samanta, a local goon, wants to marry Itu and joins hands with Sanjay to make the same happen. However, Joba, with Itu and Sarthak, escapes only to land among tribals who force Itu and Sarthak to get married in Joba's presence. Sarthak doesn't accept Itu as his wife, due to their marriage being accidental and he himself having feelings for Soheli's daughter Rinki, who actually doesn't truly love Sarthak and is just infatuated with her, and like her mother, wants to get Sarthak only to satisfy her ego and put Joba down. Param and Joba put on an act to have considered separation due to Joba supporting Sarthak's marriage with Itu. Joba leaves the house with Itu. Anup kidnaps Itu and tries to kill Joba who, however, survives; and with Param and Sarthak and police's aid, saves Itu and gets Anup arrested, while Sanjay escapes. They all then return home and Tandra tries to create rift between Joba and Param with fake divorce papers, however Joba and Pram's plan succeeds in unraveling Tandra's crimes and she is arrested, however, she vows vengeance and seeks to destroy Joba. Tia returns home after years, following a dispute with Topu. Joba tries to resolve the same and also tells Itu to study hard to become eligible of Sarthak. Later Rinki and Soheli try to create problems among Sarthak and Itu, but he firmly stands by Itu and reprimands the former two. Rinki, however, threatens suicide if Sarthak doesn't acknowledge her and not Itu to be his soulmate.

It was renovated and expanded in 2012. Property was obtained to build a school in 1884 from the Union Pacific Railroad on what was then considered \\"the wrong side of the tracks.\\" Compared with the earlier East Side School on the good side of town, the West Side School was smaller and plainer. It was a one-story structure with wood siding. In 1924 shortages of classroom space required a new building, designed by architect Wilbur A. Hitchcock. Replacing the 1884 building, it was a one-story brick structure with a green clay tile hipped roof. At its dedication it was renamed the Lincoln School. In 1936 Public Works Administration (PWA) funding became available for school expansion. William Dubois of Cheyenne was hired as architect for the addition, assisted by F.W. \\"Fred\\" Ambrose, who had worked for Hitchcock. Work was completed in 1939, with two new classrooms, a gymnasium, cafeteria and a small performance area. The addition's style followed the original. A further addition, designed by the sons of Wilbur Hitchcock, W. Eliot and Clinton, added more classrooms. The Lincoln School was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 5, 2003. Following its 2012 renovation it continues to operate as a community center.

Crew rest compartments are normally segregated, with separate compartments for the flight crew and the cabin crew. A multiple-bunk Class 1 crew rest compartment. On long flights, crew members may sleep in crew rest compartments during off-duty periods. Federal Aviation Regulations have provisions requiring crew rest areas be provided in order to operate a long flight by using multiple crew shifts. Passengers are restricted from accessing crew rest compartments by regulations, additionally their entrances may be secured by locks and may require ascending a ladder for access. Crew rest compartments may not normally be used during taxi, takeoff, or landing maneuvers (TT&L;). In flight crew rests that contain standard seats, an exception may be made to allow seated crew during TT&L.; In the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) defines three classes of crew rest facilities, dependent on the number of crew and the duration of the flight. Crew rest periods may be provided in higher classed rest areas than required, for example some airplanes may not have a class 2 rest facility, providing breaks in a crew rest. Crew rest aboard a Gulfstream G550 The FAA rest facility classifications from highest to lowest: * Class 1 rest facility: This class requires access to an area physically separated from the flight deck and the passenger cabin; contain bunks or other flat areas for sleeping; have provisions for sound and lighting isolation. * Class 2 rest facility: This class requires access to at least a lie flat seat and separation from passengers by a curtain. * Class 3 rest facility: This class only requires a cabin seat that is able to recline and has foot support. Crew rest design and safety considerations are similar between international regulators, for example the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) regulations for access control, communications, and signage are similar to those of the FAA's. By following such regulatory Bilateral Aviation Safety Agreements (which avoid contradictory minimum specifications), aircraft manufacturers can design crew rests to meet the requirements in many markets.

It is located in the municipality of Nice in the Alpes-Maritimes. The original abbey was constructed between 774 and 800 and entrusted to the Benedictines. However, in 890, it was destroyed by the Saracens during a failed attack on Nice. The church was rebuilt in 1724 in Baroque style. In 1860 it became the property of the French state and the monastery was dissolved. The building was then sold to the city of Nice for the sum of 60,000 francs. It was later transformed into an annex to the Hospital of Saint Roche. The church remained under sequestration until its transformation into Saint Pons parish. It was classified as a historical monument of national importance in 1913. The fa√ßades and roofs of the abbey and cloister were classified as being of regional importance in 1949. The abbey is now part of the Pasteur Hospital.

Pontius was the son of a Roman senator.C. Passet, 1977, p. 147. When he was very young, he and his family were persuaded by Pope Pontian to convert to Christianity. Upon the death of his father, Pontius became a senator and gave all his possessions to Pope Fabian (236-250) to be distributed among the poor. He used his position in society to convert Emperor Philip the Arab (244-249) and his son. Christians were subject to persecution during the reigns of Valerian (253-260) and Gallienus (253-268), so Pontius left Italy to settle in Cimiez. However, Claudius, the governor of Gaul, implemented the imperial policy of persecuting Christians, resulting in Pontius being arrested. For refusing to sacrifice to the pagan gods, he was sentenced to death. After several attempts at execution were ineffective, such as being thrown to two bears in the amphitheatre and being burnt at the stake, he was finally beheaded on a rock overlooking the banks of the Paillon; his body was then pushed off a cliff. His martyrdom is traditionally dated at 257 or 258 AD. Saint Pons was buried in a necropolis located at the site of the future abbey. According to a legend, his head rolled into the river and was carried away by sea to Marseilles, where the relic was taken in by the monks of the Abbey of St. Victor. The supposed place of martyrdom stood on a rock overlooking the Paillon on a cliff. A chapel dedicated to Saint Pons stood on the rock overlooking the Paillon until it was destroyed by a landslide in 1925.  History of the abbey  In 1925, Bonaventure Salvetti, then curator of the parish of Saint-Pons, published a historical essay entitled L'Abbaye de Saint-Pons hors les murs de Nice (The Abbey of Saint Pons outside the walls of Nice). The essay states the abbey was founded in 775 AD by Charlemagne, and that Saint Syagrius was its first abbot. However, this account is not considered to be reliable as it is largely based on the Vita Siacrii, a document which is not referenced before the beginning of the seventeenth century. Bernard Gui reported in the fourteenth century that the body of the martyr had been deposited in a crypt under the church named Confessio. There are five fragments of a chancel dating to the Carolingian period and they are believed to be from this church. Three of these fragments feature an inscription commemorating the restoration of the tomb of Saint Pons under the rule of Charlemagne whose title (King of Franks and Lombards) and reign make it possible to pinpoint the event to between 774 and 800. The monastery was entrusted to the Benedictines and became a centre of spiritual, intellectual, and economic development. However, in 890 the original abbey was destroyed by Saracens during a failed attack on Nice. = The Middle Ages = Following the expulsion of the Saracens from Provence in 973, the Benedictine abbey was restored and the ecclesiastical possessions granted by Charlemagne to the Abbey of Saint Pons were returned. Members of the local nobility, seeking to redeem their sins, endowed the abbey with agricultural land, olive groves, vineyards, shops, warehouses, and houses. In the Middle Ages, the abbot of the monastery of Saint Pons occupied a prominent position among the nobility of Nice as one of the richest and most powerful men in the county. He was called \\"High and Mighty Lord\\" and enjoyed \\"honorific,\\" \\"useful,\\" and \\"justice\\" rights. The honorific rights allowed the abbot to be solemnly received in the abbey church and occupy the place of honour in the choir. He was permitted to carry the pectoral cross, the mitre, the crosier. As well as administering the abbey and the priories which depended on it, the useful rights allowed the abbot the rights of homage, grazing and pasture, and a monopoly on mills and ovens. He had the right to render justice on his subjects, although it is likely that this took the form of taxes, fines, and confiscations of good necessary for good administration. By the twelfth century, the abbey was the richest in Nice and owned more than half of the city. Many churches were founded in Nice and the surrounding region by the monks of Saint-Pons, among them: * Ch√¢teauneuf-de-Contes in 1030 * Sainte-R√©parate de Nice in 1185 * Gordolon in 1185 * Sainte-D√©vote de Monaco in 1206 * Saint-Nicolas de Sospel in 1229 * Saint-Simeon d'Ongran √† Peille in 1229 * Notre-Dame du Moustier √† Luc√©ram in 1233 * Saint-Hermentaire de Draguignan in 1235 * Notre-Dame des Salettes √† Aspremont in 1248 * Notre-Dame de Falicon in 1248 * Saint-Blaise in 1248 * Saint-Pierre de l'Escar√®ne in 1248 * Notre-Dame sous Gatti√®res in 1248 * Notre-Dame des Pr√©s √† Levens in 1252 * Saint-Laurent d'√àze in 1291 * Notre-Dame des Salles pr√®s Draguignan in 1291 * Saint-Pierre d'Oliva au Broc in 1320 * Notre-Dame de Cimiez in 1346 * Notre- Dame de Virimanda √† Annot in 1369 * Notre-Dame de Beaulieu-sur-Mer in 1593 * Saint-Giaume in 1576 On 28 September 1388, the surrender of Nice to Savoy was signed in the Abbey of Saint Pons. = Fragmentation = Abbaye Saint-Pons 1900. As the Benedictine order declined in popularity, so did the seigneurial revenues, meaning the abbey could no longer maintain its community. Its remote churches became autonomous priories, and it yielded land to the new orders. On 8 February 1366, Pope Urban V issued a papal bull placing the monastery of Saint Pons under the jurisdiction of the Abbey of Saint Victor of Marseille. In 1473, the Bishop of Nice, Barth√©l√©my Chuet, \\"commissioned\\" the Abbey of Saint Pons, reuniting its incomes with those of the bishop's palace. However, this was reversed on 11 May 1476 by a papal bull of Pope Sixtus IV. In 1543, the monastery was damaged by the Turks during the siege of Nice. The abbey was closed in 1792 by King Victor-Amadeus III of Sardinia, and the few remaining Benedictine monks sent to other monasteries. He joined the property and revenues of the abbey to his estate and mortgaged them in order to guarantee the loans needed to finance major public works in Piedmont, Savoy, and Nice. During the French revolution of 1789, the monastery was converted into a military hospital for wounded Italian soldiers and vast estates were auctioned. In the year V of the French Republic, the buildings were placed under sequestration until the Concordat. Monseigneur Colonna, the bishop of Nice, acquired an Imperial Decree from Napoleon I on 12 April 1808, granting permission to establish a small seminary in the abbey. However, this never came to fruition. By virtue of the Treaties of Vienna and Paris in 1815, the County of Nice was returned to the King of Sardinia and all French laws were repealed and replaced by the pre-existing Sardinian legislation. After long negotiations between Pope Leo XII and King Charles Felix of Savoy, a concordat of 14 May 1828 restored all ecclesiastical property and revenues. The abbey of Saint Pons remained the exclusive property of the State but was required to be devoted to worship. Following extensive renovations, the bishop of Nice, Monseigneur Galvano, installed the Oblates of Mary Immaculate of Pignerole in the abbey. A Sardinian law on 29 May 1855 suppressed several religious congregations including the Oblates of Mary, although they were allowed to remain at the abbey of Saint Pons as long as they lived. In 1860 the Abbey of Saint Pons became the property of the French State. A law on 1 July 1901 led to the dissolution of the order of the Oblates and their evacuation from the monastery, with the exception of four monks protected by Sardinian law who remained as guardians of the monastery until their deaths. A decree of 14 December 1898 authorised the sale of the monastery of Saint Pons to the city of Nice for the sum of 60,000 francs. It was later transformed into an annex to the Hospital of Saint Roche under the name The Hospital of the Abbey. The church remained under sequestration until its transformation into Saint Pons parish on 20 August 1914. The abbey is now part of the Pasteur Hospital.

It is located in Region No. 4 - Demerara-Mahaica. Over 500,000 citizens of Guyana inhabit the basin that lies below and between the sea defences and the EDWC Dam in a 48 km band from Georgetown to Mahaica. The EDWC serves to irrigate thousands of hectares of rice and other crops within this area by storing rain water for dry periods and it also provides one of the primary source (about 60%) of drinking water for the city of Georgetown. To complement the irrigation network, a number of drainage relief structures have been built to protect the EDWC Dam from over- topping and collapse during the rainy periods. The most recent of there structure is the EDWC-Northern Relief Channel, better known as the Hope Canal. The Hope Canal is a man made canal that connects the EDWC to the Atlantic Ocean. Its primary function is to prevent over-topping of the conservancy dam by releasing the excess water directly into the Atlantic to prevent flooding and its consequences. The Hope Canal program consisted of four components - the Head Regulator, the Public Road Bridge, the High Level Sluice and the Hope Canal (10.3 Km)  Location  The EDWC is located 15 miles south of the most densely populated section of the Guyana Coast. It is bounded to the North by a man made 45 mile earthen dam and to the deep south by a natural topographic rise composing largely of ancient coastal dune formation over geological time. The EDWC Dam is constructed of clay and pagasse (an organic soil also known as tropical peat and of similar composition to the commonly known peat).  History of the EDWC  Guyana's drainage and irrigation system has its origins in the late 1600s under the Dutch colonial rule. One of the major innovations of the time was the building of water conservancies (artificial water catchment empoldered by earthen dams) to retain fresh water from upland streams during the dry seasons and release via irrigation canals and head regulators. The EDWC is one of the most important of these conservancies and it was designed over 125 years ago by William Russell and built using slave labour. Over the past several decades, changes in the land use, climate change driven increases in rainfall intensity and a number of other factors have left the EDWC in a fragile state. The National Drainage and Irrigation Authority has worked and continues to work diligently with international assistance to maintain and protect this vital National Drainage and Irrigation Network.  EDWC Quick Facts  * Surface Area - 130 Sq. miles *Catchment Area - 200 Sq. miles *Length of Conservancy Dam- 45 miles *Full Storage Level- 57.5 ft GD *Dead Storage Level- 53.5 ft GD *No. of Intake Structures- 27 *Relief Structures - 5  Major Projects at the EDWC  = Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) Component I ‚Äì Supply of Excavators and Pontoons to the NDIA for the use in the EDWC = As a part of the JICA Project which sees the Japanese Grant Aid being utilized to improve the drainage and irrigation capacity within the EDWC, Eight (8)long reach excavators and two pontoons were donated to the Government of Guyana. The excavators and pontoons were assembled locally and operators were given essential training in their use. They were deployed immediately after the handing over ceremony in November 2012. = JICA Component II ‚Äì Rehabilitation of the EDWC = The second component of the programme was the rehabilitation of six (6) key structures within the EDWC. # Sara Johanna Sluice # Nancy Intake #Annaadale Intake #Ann's Grove #Shanks Intake #Maduni Sluice The handing over ceremony of these newly rehabilitated structures from JICA to the Government of Guyana was on 5 July 2016. = The EDWC-Northern Relief Channel = The EDWC NRC (Hope Canal) project was designed in response to the 2005 floods that East Coast, Region 4 experienced due to the over-topping of the conservancy dam. The Hope Canal seeks to provide the means to release excess water in the EDWC when it is in danger of over-tapping and breaches. The project is a 10.3 km long earthen channel with a three-door head regulator at the conservancy end of the canal and an eight-door outfall sluice at the Atlantic end. Also included in the project was the construction on a public road bridge that has been in operation since February 2014.

He has been a professor at the University of Alaska Anchorage since 1995, teaching in the Department of Journalism and Public Communications. Blatchford also served as Commissioner of the Department of Community and Regional Affairs (1990‚Äì1994) under Wally Hickel and Commissioner of Community and Economic Development (2003‚Äì2005) under Frank Murkowski.  Early life and education  Blatchford was born in Nome, Alaska Territtory in 1950 and relocated to Seward, Alaska in 1960. Blatchford graduated from Seward High School and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Alaska Pacific University, Juris Doctor from the University of Washington School of Law, Masters of Arts degree in Journalism from Columbia University, Master of Public Administration from Harvard University, and PhD from the University of Alaska Fairbanks.  Career  Blatchford founded the publishing company Alaska Newspapers, Inc. in 1983. In 1990, Blatchford partnered with Calista Native Corporation to procure a total of six rural Alaskan newspapers.

Murkowski cited Blatchford's prior experience as commissioner of Community and Regional Affairs under governor Hickel as a prime reason for Blatchford's selection. On July 22, 2005, Blatchford resigned his position as commissioner of Community and Economic Development due to conflict of interest allegations between his official state duties and ties with Chugach Alaska Corp.  Political positions  Until the 2016 Alaskan Senate race, Blatchford had been affiliated with the Republican Party switching parties due to ideological reasons. He strongly supports reform of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) saying that it was an experiment that did not accomplish what it was charted to do. = Gun control = Edgar Blatchford is an advocate of background checks for gun ownership and states that his stance is in line with the intent of the Second Amendment. = Illegal immigration = Blatchford supports a path for citizenship or other legal status for those illegal immigrants without criminal records. = Alaskan economy = Blatchford believes smaller Alaskan communities would benefit from a more diverse economic base. = Climate change = Blatchford believes global warming is a scientific certainty that must be addressed.

Application  Expression of genetic code in all life forms consists of two major processes, synthesis of copies of the genetic code recorded in DNA into the form of mRNA (transcription), and protein synthesis itself (translation), whereby the code copies in mRNA are decoded into amino acid sequences of the respective proteins. Both transcription and translation are highly regulated processes essentially controlling everything of what happens in live cells (and multicellular organisms, consequently). Control of translation is especially important in eukaryotic cells where it forms part of post-transcriptional regulatory networks of genes expression. This additional functionality is reflected in the increased complexity of the translation process, making it a hard object to investigate. Yet details on when and what mRNA is translated and what mechanisms are responsible for this control are key to understanding of normal and pathological cell functionality. TCP-seq can be used to obtain this information.  Principles  With the advent of the high-throughput DNA and RNA sequence identification methods (such as Illumina sequencing), it became possible to efficiently analyse nucleotide sequences of large numbers of relatively short DNA and RNA fragments. Sequences of these fragments can be superimposed to reconstruct the source. Alternatively, if the source sequence is already known, the fragments can be found within it (‚Äúmapped‚Äù), and their individual numbers counted. Thus, if an initial stage exists whereby the fragments are differentially present or selected (‚Äúenriched‚Äù), this approach can be used to quantitatively describe such stage over even a very large number or length of the input sequences, most usually encompassing the entire DNA or RNA of the cell. TCP-seq is based on these capabilities of the high- throughput RNA sequencing and further uses the nucleic acid protection phenomenon. The protection is manifested as resistance to depolymerisation or modification of stretches of nucleic acids (particularly, RNA) that are tightly bound to or engulfed with other biomolecules, which thus leave their ‚Äúfootprints‚Äù over the nucleic acid strand. These ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù fragments therefore represent location on nucleic acid chain where the interaction occurs. By sequencing and mapping the fragments back to the source sequence, it is possible to precisely identify the locations and counts of these intermolecular contacts. In case of TCP-seq, ribosomes and ribosomal subunits engaged in interaction with mRNA are first fast chemically crosslinked to it with formaldehyde to preserve existing state of interactions (‚Äúsnapshot‚Äù of distribution) and to block any possible non-equilibrium processes. The crosslinking can be performed directly in, but not restricted to, live cells. The RNA is then partially degraded (e.g. with ribonuclease) so that only fragments protected by the ribosomes or ribosomal subunits are left. The protected fragments are then purified according to the sedimentation dynamics of the attached ribosomes or ribosomal subunits, de-blocked, sequenced and mapped to the source transcriptome, giving the original locations of the translation complexes over mRNA. TCP-seq merges several elements typical to other transcriptome-wide analyses of its kind. In particular, polysome profiling and ribosome (translation) profiling approaches are also employed to identify mRNA involved in polysome formation and locations of elongating ribosomes over coding regions of transcripts, correspondingly. These methods, however, do not use chemical stabilisation of translation complexes and purification of the covalently bound intermediates from the live cells. TCP- seq thus can be considered more as a functional equivalent of ChIP-seq and similar methods of investigating momentary interactions of DNA that are redesigned to be applicable for translation.  Advantages and disadvantages  The advantages of the method include: * uniquely wide field of view (because translation complexes of any type, including scanning small ribosomal subunits, are captured for the first time); * potentially more natural representation of complex dynamics (because all, and not only selected, translation processes are arrested by formaldehyde fixation); * possibly more faithful and/or sensitive detection of translation complexes locations (as covalent fixation prevents detachment of the fragments from the ribosomes or their subunits). The disadvantages include: * higher overall complexity of the experimental procedure (due to requirement of the initial isolation of translated mRNA and preparative sedimentation to separate ribosomes and ribosomal subunits); * higher contamination of the useful sequencing read depth with the undesired fragments of the ribosomal RNA (inherited from the wide size selection window used for protected RNA fragments); * a pre- requirement for optimization of the formaldehyde fixation procedure for each new cell or sample type (as optimal formaldehyde fixation timings strongly depend on sample morphology and both over- and under-fixation will compromise the results).  Development  The method is currently being developed and was applied to investigate translation dynamics in live yeast cells and is extending, rather than simply combining, the capabilities of the previous techniques. The only other transcriptome-wide method for mapping ribosome positions over mRNA with nucleotide precision is ribosome (translation) profiling. However, it captures positions of only elongating ribosomes, and most dynamic and functionally important intermediates of translation at the initiation stage are not detected. TCP-seq was designed to specifically target these blind spots. It can essentially provide the same level of details for elongation phase as ribosome (translation) profiling, but also includes recording of initiation, termination and recycling intermediates (and basically any other possible translation complexes as long as the ribosome or its subunits are contacting and protecting the mRNA) of protein synthesis that previously remained out of the reach. Therefore, TCP-seq provides a single approach for a complete insight into the translation process of a biological sample. This particular aspect of the method can be expected to be developed further as the dynamics of ribosomal scanning on mRNA during translation initiation is generally unknown for the most of life. Current dataset containing TCP-seq data for translation initiation is available for yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and likely to be extended for other organisms in the future.

Preexisting issues =Zika virus= The Brazilian Army has sent more than 200,000 troops to go \\"house to house\\" in the campaign against Zika-carrying mosquitoes. Agent for endemic diseases of the city of Votuporanga, S√£o Paulo, Brazil An ongoing outbreak of the mosquito- borne Zika virus in Brazil has raised fears regarding its potential impact on athletes and visitors. Organizers plan to perform daily inspections of Olympic venues to prevent puddles of stagnant water that allow mosquitoes to breed. Zika virus transmission was also attributed to inefficient sewage treatment in the area, and sewage treatment is being improved in preparation for the Games. There have been numerous calls for the Games to be postponed, warning that the anticipated attendance of 500,000 international visitors could cause the virus to rapidly spread outside of the country. In the first quarter of 2016, there were also more cases of the mosquito-borne Dengue fever than in 2015 alone. Dr. Amir Attaran of the University of Ottawa, writing for the Harvard Public Health Review, noted that Rio had the highest concentration of Zika infections out of all Brazilian states. He argued that the Olympics could result in a \\"global catastrophe\\" of Zika outbreaks, and asserted that it was \\"socially irresponsible\\" and \\"ethically questionable\\" to allow them to continue. On the other hand, it has been argued that the threat of Zika will not be as high during the Games, citing computer models and simulations, as well as the fact that the Games will be held during Southern Hemisphere winter, which is when mosquitoes are least active. The initial outbreak of Zika in Brazil occurred during the winter months, but in Northeastern states near the equator, where there is no winter season throughout the year. Tom Frieden, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated that \\"there is no public health reason to cancel or delay the Olympics\\". In May 2016, a group of 150 physicians and scientists sent an open letter to the World Health Organization, calling upon them to, according to co-author Arthur Caplan, have \\"an open, transparent discussion of the risks of holding the Olympics as planned in Brazil\\". The WHO dismissed the request, stating that \\"cancelling or changing the location of the 2016 Olympics will not significantly alter the international spread of Zika virus\\", and that there was \\"no public health justification\\" for postponing them. Many athletes declined to participate in the Games citing concerns over Zika, including Milos Raonic, Tomas Berdych, Simona Halep, Karol√≠na Pl√≠≈°kov√°, The Bryan brothers, Jason Day, Tejay van Garderen, Branden Grace, Dustin Johnson, Shane Lowry, Rory McIlroy, Marc Leishman, Charl Schwartzel, Angelo Que and Jordan Spieth. As the majority of the athletes that have pulled out were golfers, International Golf Federation president Peter Dawson believed that there was \\"something of an overreaction\\" to Zika, stating that \\"I think I should say now that I don't think it's appropriate for us to discuss individual cases, especially as they're generally decisions that have been taken on health grounds. Speaking collectively though, there is no doubt that the number of withdrawals hasn't shed golf in the best light. We have to accept that. But we do understand why these individual decisions have been taken\\". On 2 September 2016, the WHO reported that there were no confirmed cases of Zika among athletes or visitors during the Olympics. =Sanitation= Marina da Gl√≥ria, locale of sailing competitions The Fort Copacabana which hosted the cycling road race (start and finish), marathon swimming and triathlon events. The Guanabara Bay, whose waters were to be used for sailing and windsurfing competitions, is heavily polluted. Among the chief causes of the pollution are uncollected trash fed into the bay via polluted rivers and shanty towns along the coast. Pollution of the Guanabara has been a long-term issue; although officials promised at the Earth Summit in 1992 that they would begin to address the pollution, previous attempts to do so were insufficient. As an aspect of their bid for the Games, Rio once again committed to making efforts towards cleaning the bay. However, some of these proposed initiatives faced budgetary issues. Before these efforts, only 17% of Rio's sewage was treated; this raw sewage also leaked into the bay. In 2011, a new consortium took over the operations of Rio's sewage system in its western \\"AP5\\" zone as a legacy project for the Games. The consortium committed to building out upgrades to the sewage system that would reduce the amount of sewage flowing into the bay by 17 million gallons by the end of 2016. However, adoption of the new system was slow and inconsistent because of concerns by residents over installation costs. Although Mayor of Rio Eduardo Paes stated that the city might not be able to reach its goal of having 80% of sewage treated, at least 60% of sewage was treated by March 2016, with a projected goal of 65% of sewage being treated by the time the Olympics start. The pollution also led to concerns over how it would affect competitions and the health of athletes, especially concerns that the polluted waterways could cause athletes to be unable to compete. In 2014, sailors training in the bay told The New York Times that they had to contend with dodging various forms of trash floating in its waters, ranging from tires to dog carcasses. That December, researchers from the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation found drug-resistant \\"super bacteria\\"‚ÄîKPC enzymes‚Äîin samples of water from the Carioca River. They warned that \\"carriers can take these resistant bacteria back to their own environments and to other people, resulting in a cycle of dissemination\\". In 2015, it was found that because of open drainage and severe pollution, the incidence of \\"disease-causing viruses\\" in Rio's waterways was measured to be \\"1.7 million times the level of what would be considered hazardous on a Southern California beach\\". Following a test event in August 2015, German sailor Erik Heil was found to have been infected with multi- resistant bacteria that are believed to have been connected to the sewage. =Political instability and economic crisis= 2015‚Äì16 protests in Brazil In 2014, Operation Car Wash, an investigation by the Federal Police of Brazil, uncovered unprecedented money laundering and corruption at the state- controlled oil company Petrobras, where executives allegedly accepted bribes in return for awarding contracts to construction firms at inflated prices. In early 2015, a series of protests against alleged corruption by the government of President Dilma Rousseff began in Brazil, triggered by revelations that numerous politicians were involved in the Petrobras affair. By early 2016, the scandal had escalated into a full-blown political crisis affecting not only President Rousseff, but also former President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, resulting in massive demonstrations all over the country involving millions of protesters, both anti and pro-Rousseff. On 17 April 2016, the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Brazilian Parliament) concluded a general vote for the admission of the impeachment process. At that moment, polls showed that 61% of Brazilians believed Rousseff should be impeached, but polls also showed almost the same amount of Brazilians believed Vice President Michel Temer, who was supposed to inherit the presidency following the impeachment process began as Interim President, should be impeached too. In addition, Senator Romero Juc√°, appointed as planning minister after Rousseff's dismissal, was caught on tape with former oil executive Sergio Machado agreeing that removing Rousseff is the only way for ending the investigation. At the same time, Brazil faces its worst economic recession since the 1990s, raising questions about whether the country is adequately prepared for the Games against a volatile political and economic backdrop. According to one OECD spokesperson the Brazilian recession will endure until 2018 and can only be resolved by holding new elections. The IOC, in turn, has stated that it is following the political developments \\"very closely\\". On 14 April, the Olympic Security Coordination assured that the economic and political crises would not affect the security and fulfillment of the Games. In his speech during the Olympic torch lighting ceremony in Olympia, IOC President Thomas Bach commented on Brazil's political situation: \\"This will be the Brazilian Games. Despite the difficulties that the country faces, the event will bring a message of hope to every corner of its territory and also worldwide. The Games will take place in a moment in which the world is shaken by crises. I want to pay tribute to the Brazilian people, who, in a few weeks, will welcome the world with enthusiasm and will leave everyone amazed by its joy and its passion for sports\\". On 12 May, President Rousseff was stripped of her powers and duties for 180 days, after an impeachment vote in the Federal Senate, thus Vice President Temer will be acting president during the Games. Rousseff will not be invited to attend any event during the Games. Instead, the main invitation as head of state was sent to Temer as acting president. Temer's legitimacy has been questioned though. Prior to the impeachment vote, the majority of Brazilians supported holding new general elections as a way to solve the political crisis, while only 8% favored Temer's rise to power. As a result of this perception, anti-Temer protests are becoming larger and intenser, and some politicians have claimed the Games will take place amidst political turmoil. Security Since Rio de Janeiro was awarded the 2016 Summer Olympics, the city's crime problems have received more attention. Rio's mayor has admitted that there are \\"big issues\\" facing the city in securing the Games from violence. However, he also said that such concerns and issues were presented to the IOC throughout the bidding process. The governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro also highlighted the fact that London faced security problems, with a terrorist attack occurring there on the day after the IOC chose London to host the 2012 Summer Olympics. The estimate was that 5,000 men of the National Public Security Force and 22,000 military officers (14,800 Army; 5,900 Navy and 1,300 of the Brazilian Air Force), in addition to the fixed quota of Rio de Janeiro, will act during the Olympic Games. Many of these officers have been training for possible terrorist attacks, such as on the Metr√¥. To ensure that no unauthorized persons would be able to enter the Games, additional screening measures were enacted at venues.

Integrated security operation for the 2016 Summer Olympics The IOC has expressed optimism regarding the ability of the city and the nation of Brazil to address these concerns, saying that seven years is enough time for Rio de Janeiro to clean up its crime problem. IOC spokesman Mark Adams told The Associated Press, \\"we have confidence in their capacity to deliver a safe Games in seven years. Security is of course a very important aspect of any Olympic Games no matter where it is in the world. This is of course entirely under the national, regional and city authorities\\". Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, former president of Brazil, noted that the city has hosted other high-profile events without major incidents, for example the 2007 Pan American Games. Community-based Police Pacification Units (UPPs) will be used to build trust in individual communities through the use of street patrols and civic work. Moreover, The Regional Institute of Public Safety reported that the homicide rate of Rio de Janeiro for the first five months of 2012 was at its lowest in the past 21 years, with 10.9 homicides for every 100,000 inhabitants. Despite the decline in homicides and human rights abuses, Human Rights Watch urged Brazil to investigate extrajudicial killings. Crime Despite promises for increased security, there are still security concerns in Rio, with 2,036 killings from January to April 2016. On 21 May 2016, three members representing Spain were robbed at gunpoint in the Santa Teresa neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro, by five youths, two of whom were armed with pistols. In June 2016, one of the bodyguards for the mayor was mugged and killed while off duty; a doctor was killed while on an expressway; and the Australian Paralympic team was robbed at gunpoint. Gang-related shootings on the Red Line expressway, the main road to the Olympic site, were said to be commonplace and had claimed several lives, including that of a 17-year-old girl in May. The girl's murder and other incidents prompted some countries to consider bringing private security forces to the Olympics. On 30 June 2016, police near the Olympic beach volleyball venue in Copacabana found a foot and other body parts on the shore, possibly from \\"a woman or young adult\\" who had been killed. The officers said the parts washed on the sea, triggering possible concerns about the violence in Rio. On 21 July 2016, the Federal Police of Brazil arrested ten members of an alleged Islamic jihadist terrorist ring accused of planning attacks during the games. The ring was plotting to wreak havoc in a manner similar to the 1972 Munich massacre, with 10 ISIS associates arrested and two more on the run; the two people who had escaped were later arrested. There did not seem to be evidence of a sophisticated terrorist plot. On 30 July 2016, a fire in the apartments where the Australian Olympic Team prompted an evacuation. The fire was caused by a cigarette, even though Olympic Village is a no-smoking area. Upon return to their rooms, the athletes found that 2 laptops and team shirts had been stolen. It was discovered that the fire alarms were deactivated before the fire with one athlete stating that he slept through the door-knocking and phone calls. On 4 August 2016, the Australian rowing coaches were robbed at knifepoint close to Ipanema beach. One of the coaches was grabbed around the throat before the attackers fled with credit cards, mobile phones and an Australian team blazer. On 5 August 2016, the Greek team in the Olympic village reported to officials that many personal items had been stolen from their rooms in the Olympic village including mobile phones, clothes and medical equipment. On 12 August 2016, an athlete had $20,000 stolen by an Olympic Village employee. The worker was arrested and the money returned. Preparations Infrastructure concerns The Rio 2016 Olympic Village Tim Maia bike path While the whole city was undergoing major infrastructure improvements, there were concerns that some of the projects would not materialise. On 9 May 2014, the London Evening Standard reported IOC vice-president John Coates calling Brazil's preparations \\"the worst I‚Äôve experienced\\" and went on to claim that construction and infrastructure projects were severely behind schedule. \\"The IOC has formed a special task force to try to speed up preparations but the situation is critical on the ground\\", the paper quoted him as saying, concluding that such an intervention was \\"unprecedented\\". Despite these initial worries, the Rio Olympics Committee reported on 29 December 2015 that most venues were complete except the Rio Olympic Velodrome (76%) and the Youth Arena (75%). Coates' concerns had previously been reported elsewhere in the media. On 21 April‚Äîthe day that the Olympic torch was lit‚Äîa section of the Tim Maia bike path, crossing the Oscar Niemeyer Avenue in S√£o Conrado neighborhood and a part of the legacy of the games, was hit by a giant wave and collapsed. Two pedestrians fell into the ocean to their deaths, and three were injured. Four days after the incident, Rio's mayor Eduardo Paes announced that the bike path would be repaired before the Olympics, and that the companies responsible for the path will be punished. The Rio 2016 Olympic Village has been described as the largest in Olympic history. Some officials deemed the athletes' village as \\"unlivable\\" and unsafe because of major plumbing and electrical hazards still present a fortnight before the opening of the Rio Olympics. Blocked toilets, leaking pipes, exposed wiring, unlight stairwells and dirty floors were among the reported problems at some apartments in the complex. The Australian Olympic team boycotted the village after officials deemed their assigned apartment tower blocks uninhabitable. A team of more than 500 employees of the local Olympic committee worked to fix the problems reported by the delegations. The organizers of the Rio Olympics conceded that there were isolated cases of sabotage by employees during the construction of the Rio 2016 Village. Russian doping scandal and participation restrictions Vitaly Mutko, Russian Minister of Sport Media attention began growing in December 2014 when German broadcaster ARD reported on state-sponsored doping in Russia, comparing it to doping in East Germany. In November 2015, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report and the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Russia indefinitely from world track and field events. The United Kingdom Anti-Doping agency later assisted WADA with testing in Russia. In June 2016, they reported that they were unable to fully carry out their work and noted intimidation by armed Federal Security Service (FSB) agents. After a Russian former lab director made allegations about the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, WADA commissioned an independent investigation led by Richard McLaren. McLaren's investigation found corroborating evidence, concluding in a report published in July 2016 that the Ministry of Sport and the FSB had operated a \\"state-directed failsafe system\\" using a \\"disappearing positive [test] methodology\\" (DPM) from \\"at least late 2011 to August 2015\\". In response to these findings, WADA announced that RUSADA should be regarded as non-compliant with respect to the World Anti- Doping Code and recommended that Russia be banned from competing at the 2016 Summer Olympics. The International Olympic Commission (IOC) rejected the recommendation, stating that the IOC and each sport's international federation would make decisions on each athlete's individual basis. One day prior to the opening ceremony, 278 athletes were cleared to compete under the Russian flag, while 111 were removed because of doping. In contrast, the entire Kuwaiti team was banned from competing under their own flag (for a non-doping related matter). The IOC's decision on 24 July 2016 was widely criticized by both athletes and writers, as well as members of the Olympic Committee. A member of the IOC Athletes' Commission, Hayley Wickenheiser, wrote, \\"I ask myself if we were not dealing with Russia would this decision to ban a nation [have] been an easier one? I fear the answer is yes\\". Writing for Deutsche Welle in Germany, Olivia Gerstenberger said that the head of the IOC, Thomas Bach had \\"flunked\\" his first serious test, adding, \\"With this decision, the credibility of the organization is shattered once more, while that of state-sponsored doping actually receives a minor boost\\". Bild (Germany) described Bach as \\"Putin's poodle\\". Unlike the IOC, the International Paralympic Committee voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics and suspended the Russian Paralympic Committee, having found evidence that the DPM was also in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics. On 9 December 2016, Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren published the second part of his independent report. The investigation found that from 2011 to 2015, more than 1,000 Russian competitors in various sports (including summer, winter, and Paralympic sports) benefited from the cover-up. Emails indicate that they included five blind powerlifters, who may have been given drugs without their knowledge, and a fifteen-year-old. Aviation incidents On 2 July 2016, two skydivers collided while performing a stunt, practicing for the Olympics where the 28 skydivers would re-create the Olympic rings in the sky during the opening ceremony. The two men's parachutes become tangled-up mid-air after they collided, causing them to fall to their deaths. One man died at the scene and the other died in a hospital. The two deceased men were named as Gustavo Correa Garcez, a national champion, and instructor Guilherme Bastos Padilha. The incident took place over Boituva. On 26 July 2016, two Brazilian navy aircraft, AF-1 Skyhawks, collided in mid-air near Rio de Janeiro. They were training for the purpose of protecting the Olympics. One of the airplanes' pilots was able to land despite the aircraft being damaged. The other pilot ejected safely before his plane crashed into the sea. During the Olympics Security On 6 August, a stray bullet was fired at a media tent at the Equestrian Center while about 100 media personnel were present. The bullet pierced the plastic roof of the tent and fell to the ground near a Team Great Britain official and a British photographer. Nobody was hurt during the incident. On the same day, a \\"suspicious package\\" was found near the finish line of the men's cycling road race. As a precaution, security forces performed a controlled explosion on it. On 9 August, a bus carrying international media was traveling between the Deodoro hockey venue and the main press center at Barra da Tijuca was attacked. Stones thrown at the bus shattered windows. Rio 2016 spokesman Mario Andrada said the attack was \\"worrying and intolerable\\". On 10 August, a stray bullet was found inside the Olympic equestrian centre close to the stable area. The head of Rio 2016 communications, Mario Andrada, said he was in the stables ‚Äútrying to find out what really happened‚Äù. Organization The water at the Maria Lenk Aquatics Center used for the diving competitions turned green on 9 August. On 4 August, Nigeria played Japan in the men's football group stages. When the national anthem for Nigeria was meant to be played, the Niger national anthem was incorrectly played instead. The Japan national anthem went normally. During the fourth minute of the game, the PA apologized for the mix-up. Initially, an incorrect version of the Chinese national flag, on which the four smaller stars were pointing upwards (instead of slanted towards the larger star on the flag) was used in all official materials of the Rio 2016 Games, including the flag leading the athletes delegation at the opening ceremony, the flags used in award ceremonies, and the flag on the official Rio 2016 mobile app. However, the mistake remained largely undetected until the first award ceremony featuring the Chinese flag on the second day of the Games, upon which the issue created a huge outcry in China, especially with initial media reports suggesting that the flags had been manufactured in China. Initially, China's State run CCTV America site published an article titled \\"Rio Olympics: ‚ÄòMade in China‚Äô will be everywhere\\", which stated \\"All the national flags that will be hoisted during the ceremony are made in China\\", but was quickly changed after the incident became public. A spokesperson for the Rio Olympic Committee admitted the mistake and apologized for it, but claimed that all flags had been approved by the respective National Olympic Committees. The Chinese Olympic Committee did not respond to requests for comment, but the Chinese Consulate-General in Rio de Janeiro issued a formal diplomatic complaint and pressed the organizers of the Games to replace the flags with new, correct ones as soon as possible. The Chinese Consulate-General in S√£o Paulo dispatched officials to the flag manufacturer, located on the outskirt of S√£o Paulo, to supervise the express production of new, correct flags. Starting from 11 August (the seventh day of the Games), the correct version of the flag was used. On 11 August, John Coates, vice president of the IOC, stated that Rio 2016 had been the \\"most difficult\\" Games ever and crowd numbers are a \\"disappointment\\". Coates said that swathes of empty seats at a number of venues have been a source of frustration for the body. Starting 9 August, the pool used for diving competitions began turning a green color instead of its natural blue, followed by the water polo pool the next day. Several athletes reported that it affected their performance, either by preventing them from seeing underwater or hurting their eyes (possibly because of increased chlorine to counteract the problem). The color change was officially reported as being caused by a lack of chemicals used for the water treatment process, which resulted in the pH level of the pool to change. The diving pool was closed on 12 August after it began producing a sulfuric smell and was suggested to be a cause of eye itchiness among some athletes who competed within it. A report said that a sanitation contractor had added the dechlorinating sterilizer hydrogen peroxide to water that was already chlorinated, neutralizing the sterilizing effect of chlorine. An overhead camera crashed at the Olympic Park on 15 August On 15 August, seven people, including an 11-year-old girl, were injured after an overhead TV camera crashed to the ground at the Olympic Park. Doping Kenyan athletics coach John Anzrah posed as one of his runners for a drug test. He presented himself as 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich and even signed the documents for the drug tests. Anzrah was sent home afterwards. While swimming for the Chinese national team at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Chen Xinyi tested positive for hydrochlorothiazide, a banned substance. Following this, she was suspended from competition in the 2016 Summer Olympics by the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Kirghiz athlete Izzat Artykov, bronze medalist in weightlifting of men up to 69 kg, was suspended from the games after strychnine had been found in his blood. He had to return his bronze medal. On 8 December 2016 Russian boxer Misha Aloyan was stripped of the silver medal in 52 kg boxing at the Rio 2016 Summer Olympics after his testing positive for tuaminoheptane. Unsportsmanlike crowds On 17 August, Pole vault silver medallist Renaud Lavillenie was booed by the Rio crowd for a second time in 24 hours. Olympics chief Thomas Bach called the conduct of the crowd \\"shocking\\" and \\"unacceptable at the Olympics\\". IAAF chief Lord Coe consoled Lavillenie after the incident. Boxing judging Controversy surrounded the new judging system in boxing; the new system counts has five judges who judge each bout, and a computer randomly selects three whose scores are counted. Traditionally, judges would use a computer scoring system to count each punch landed, but in 2016 the winner of each round was awarded 10 points and the loser a lower number, based on criteria which includes the quality of punches landed, effective aggression and tactical superiority. Two results in particular attracted controversy (both involving Russian athletes whose victories were put in question): the defeat of Vasily Levit by Russian Evgeny Tishchenko in the men's heavyweight gold-medal fight, drawing jeers from the audience, and the defeat of Michael Conlan by Russian Vladimir Nikitin in the men's bantamweight quarter-final, after which Conlan accused AIBA and the Russian team of cheating, even tweeting to Russian President Vladimir Putin \\"Hey Vlad, How much did they charge you bro??\\" The AIBA would remove an unspecified number of judges and referees following the controversy, stating that they \\"determined that less than a handful of the decisions were not at the level expected\\" and \\"that the concerned referees and judges will no longer officiate at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games\\"; however, the original decision would still remain. Swimming pool data Researchers are questioning whether a current in the pool may have affected swimming times giving some an unfair advantage in the Rio Olympics. Data from the Games seems to suggest that swimmers in one half of the pool had an unfair advantage over those in the other, and that this has been a persistent problem in the sport. Joel Stager, director of the Indiana University‚Äôs Counsilman Center for the Science of Swimming, and two researchers told the Wall Street Journal that results seem to indicate swimmers in the higher-numbered lanes had a performance boost in the 50m, which has competitors swim one pool length. There was a reverse effect for swimming the opposite direction. On a longer race which involves swimming more than one length of the pool, swimmers in the lower-numbered lanes had a boost on the return. In results from the men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs 50m heats for every type of stroke in Rio, the researchers found that almost all those who qualified for the final swam in lanes four to eight. Athletes who then moved to the lower-numbered lanes showed a decrease in performance. Only one medallist in the 50m swim came from the lower lanes ‚Äì US swimmer Anthony Ervin. Lochtegate On the morning of August 14, 2016, Lochte and Jimmy Feigen falsely stated that they and teammates Gunnar Bentz and Jack Conger were robbed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the 2016 Summer Olympics after men forced them out of their taxi at gunpoint in the early morning hours. Lochte also falsely claimed that a gun had been put up against his head. Surveillance video and a police report revealed one or more of the athletes had vandalized the gas station bathroom. Lochte later stated in an interview that he had been drunk and that he \\"over-exaggerated that story\\". However, his amended story raised concerns about the facts, and soon it emerged that Lochte's taxi had not in fact been stopped by armed men, but that the swimmers had stopped to use the fuel station's bathroom which Lochte was accused of vandalizing. He initially claimed that money was taken from him, but it was later clarified the money was offered as repayment for the vandalism. In August 2016, Lochte was charged with providing a false claim of a robbery during the 2016 Summer Olympics, and if convicted could be jailed up to 18 months. On August 30, 2016, when appearing on Good Morning America, he said that he was unsure how he would classify the incident, stating, \\"I don't know if I would consider it as a robbery, or extortion, or us just paying up for the poster being ripped.\\" Lochte apologized for lying about the gas station dispute, and for overshadowing the ongoing Olympics. In the aftermath of the incident, USA Swimming suspended Lochte from domestic and international competitions for 10 months. Lochte was also dropped by all four of his major sponsors. Anti- Israel incidents Prior to the Olympics, Facebook allowed users to add the Olympic logo and the team flag to their profile pictures; however, Israel was not included on this list. The Israeli flag was later added to the list; however, it was not listed alphabetically, but rather was included at the end of the list. The Lebanese delegation was assigned to ride from the Olympic village to the opening ceremony on the same bus as the Israeli delegation. The head of the Lebanese team, Salim al-Haj Nicolas, admitted that he demanded that the bus door be closed on the Israeli team, and that the Lebanese demanded that the Israeli athletes not board the bus. Udi Gal, an Israeli Olympic sailor, said his team ultimately decided to travel separately to avoid an \\"international and physical incident\\", but added \\"How could they let this happen on the eve of the Olympic Games? Isn't this the opposite of what the Olympics represents?\\" A Saudi Arabian judoka, Joud Fahmy, was accused of forfeiting her match in order to avoid competing against Israeli Gili Cohen. Fahmy, Saudi Arabia's news agency Al Arabiya, and the Saudi Olympic delegation said that Fahmy forfeited because she received an injury. Jim Nieto, the martial arts instructor who coached her before the Olympics, said it seemed fishy that she, after taking part in the Opening Ceremony, was reportedly injured so close to her fight date, because top competitors generally do not fight the day before their competition. He said \\"I feel sorry for her. Let her fight ‚Äî even if she lasts 10 seconds. She busted her butt for almost a year to get there\\". Egyptian judoka Islam El Shehaby refused to shake hands with Israeli Or Sasson, or to perform the traditional post-match bow (giving only a quick nod), after Sasson defeated El Shehaby in a first-round match in the heaviest weight class on 12 August. American coach Jimmy Pedro called the Egyptian's behavior \\"completely dishonorable and totally unsportsmanlike\\". El Shehaby was sent home early by the IOC and Egypt's Olympic committee for refusing to bow to his opponent and the mat. Ticket scandal On 5 August, the day of the 2016 Summer Olympics opening ceremony, police in Rio de Janeiro arrested two people for attempted illegal resale of hundreds of tickets allocated to the Olympic Council of Ireland (OCI). One of the two was employed by THG Sports, which was the OCI's authorised ticket reseller (ATR) in 2012 but not 2016; the OCI denied any involvement. Shane Ross, the Irish Minister for Sport, promised a \\"robust inquiry\\". Pro 10 Sports Management, the OCI's 2016 ATR, said the man arrested was working as their agent to distribute tickets which had been paid for legitimately. On 17 August, Pat Hickey, the OCI president, was arrested in Rio in connection with the investigation. Policies on social media In October 2015, the IOC has new rules on social media it stated that \\"The use of Olympic Material transformed into graphic animated formats such as animated GIFs (i.e. GIFV), GFY, WebM, or short video formats such as Vines and others, is expressly prohibited.\\" and also stated that \\"Broadcasting images via live-streaming applications (e.g. Periscope, Meerkat) is prohibited inside Olympic venues.\\" See also * Concerns and controversies over the 2010 Commonwealth Games * Controversies at the 2012 Summer Paralympics * List of athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics with a prior doping offence * Olympic Games scandals and controversies * Killing of Juma the jaguar References 2016 Summer Olympics 2016 controversies *2016 Foreign relations of Brazil ","title":"Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics"},{"id":"51165544","text":"Eunidia alboapicalis is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

Background and production Steve Gleason, who was a defensive back for the New Orleans Saints, is best known for his 2006 block of the opposing team's punt in a game on September 25 against the Atlanta Falcons broadcast on Monday Night Football, which, according to Robert Mays writing for the Ringer, was \\"...the play that sparked a magical season, inspired a statue, and revived a franchise ...\\" That game was the first time the Saints had played in their home stadium, the Superdome (now the Mercedes-Benz Superdome) since before Hurricane Katrina. In the aftermath of the hurricane, much of New Orleans was left flooded and devastated, including the Superdome, which had incurred major damage. The team spent the whole season following the hurricane (2005) and the beginning of the 2006 season (over a year), on the road, even for designated home games, which were held in other venues outside of New Orleans, such as in San Antonio. The team had experienced a dismal 2005 season, which led to the post-season firing of head coach Jim Haslett and hiring of Sean Payton. The game was hosted by Monday Night Football primarily to mark the \\"welcoming home\\" ceremony for the previously displaced team, and the event was accompanied by a pre-game and halftime ceremonies featuring rock group Green Day who appeared together with Bono and the Edge of U2 to do a version of \\"The Saints Are Coming\\". In 2011, Steve Gleason was diagnosed with Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred to as Lou Gehrig's Disease‚Äîa rare and incurable neurodegenerative disease that slowly robs the person afflicted of his or her motor functions, including eventually breathing‚Äîultimately resulting in death. Gleason and filmmaker Sean Pamphilon, who had directed Run Ricky Run, an ESPN profile of former Saints and Dolphins running back Ricky Williams, agreed to collaborate on a documentary profiling Gleason and his experiences with the illness. Shortly thereafter Gleason found out that his wife, Michel Rae Varisco, was pregnant with their son, Rivers, and she and their son factor heavily in the documentary as it depicts the life of their family and the role of his disease in shaping it. Pamphilon, who was biding time between New Orleans and his home in Seattle, followed the family around with a hand-held camera, and eventually, due to the logistical difficulty of proving adequate coverage, brought in Ty Minton-Small, a recent college graduate, as a second cameraman to help capture footage. Minton-Small and the Gleason family developed a strong rapport, with the Gleasons allowing Minton- Small to film the birth of their son, Rivers. During production, the unit found themselves in the center of a controversy concerning former Saints defensive coordinator Gregg Williams, who was accused of offering players bounties as a reward for injuring players on opposing teams during games. Pamphilon recorded a team meeting in which Williams urged players to \\"kill the fucking head.\\" Pamphilon, who became concerned about traumatic brain injuries in football, decided that the audio should be made public. In April 2012, a month after the NFL made the situation involving Williams and his staff public, Pamphilon released excerpts from the meeting without Gleason's permission, effectively ending their relationship and his role in the project. Ty Minton-Small and David Lee, who had been hired as Pamphilon's assistants earlier that year continued to follow the family for the remainder of the shooting. According to Gleason, the crew and his family became very close: :Ty and David more or less lived and traveled with us,\\" Gleason wrote Gambit in an email interview \\"They did caretaking for me, and are like uncles to Rivers. ... Ultimately, they weren't outside filmmakers filming our family. We were a team, working together on a mutual project. Ty and David are family to us. The producers decided to hire editor Clay Tweel after a long search for an experienced director proved unsuccessful. The film chronicles the progressive stages in Gleason's disease. As his disease advanced, Gleason lost control of most motor functions, including speaking, and he now relies on assistive technology, known as Augmentive/Alternative Communication (AAC), to communicate. Steve Gleason is a fan of rock group Pearl Jam and is friends with several members of the band, including Mike McCready, who wrote a song that was not included in the film. Release The film had its world premiere at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival on January 23, 2016. Shortly after, Amazon Studios acquired distribution rights to the film. Open Road Films is co- distributing the film with Amazon. The film was released in the United States on July 29, 2016. Critical reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 67 reviews, and an average rating of 8/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Gleason stands out among sports-themed documentaries by offering a clear-eyed look at its subject's physical deterioration ‚Äî and an intimate portrait of the family affected by his ordeal.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

She attended public schools in her hometown of Jackson, Mississippi, before earning a B.A. in History and Film Studies from Mt. Holyoke College in Massachusetts. After receiving a Ph.D. in History from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, she went to Bennington College Writing Seminars for her M.F.A. in Creative Writing. She currently lives in New Orleans. Smith's first book, We Have Raised All of You: Motherhood in the South, 1750-1835, a cross-cultural study of motherhood among Southern whites, Indians, and African-Americans in Virginia and the Carolinas, was published in 2013 by Louisiana State University Press. According to the Journal of American History, \\"Smith has made a valuable contribution to gender and southern studies by effectively complicating and humanizing the concept of motherhood. ... Her text will join the ranks of the few others that tackle this universal and timeless subject.\\" Smith's first novel, The Story of Land and Sea (HarperCollins, 2014) is set in Beaufort, North Carolina, at the end of the American Revolution. The New York Times wrote that \\"Smith's spare, rhythmic prose captivates,\\" and according to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Smith has written something wondrous and rare in her coruscating debut novel‚Ä¶In quiet, powerful language, The Story of Land and Sea takes us to a South that has been forgotten, blotted out by the stain of war, and breathes life into early history.\\" BBC listed it among the \\"10 Best New Books to Read,\\" and Huffington Post and Vogue Magazine included it as one of their \\"Best Books of the Year.\\" The Library Journal wrote about her second novel, Free Men (HarperCollins, 2016), \\"If [The Story of Land and Sea] could be described as a beautiful murmur, this book is a shout, sharply written and more urgent.\\" In his review in The Washington Post, Ron Charles observed, \\"With this collage of experiences twisted together and soaked in blood, Smith cuts to the bone of our national character.\\" Smith's writing has also appeared in The Oxford American, Granta, Literary Hub, Garden & Gun, and Lenny.

Founded in 2013, Sunnies Studios now sells online and has 127 stores in the Philippines and Vietnam . They have since expanded to the makeup industry, with Sunnies Face and the food industry, with Sunnies Cafe. History The company was founded in 2013 by Georgina Wilson, Martine Cajucom, Bea Soriano-Dee and Eric Dee. Its headquarters is located in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines . Back in 2011, Eric Dee and Bea Soriano-Dee started Charlie, a retail brand that sold shoes, bags and clothes. By the year 2013, Georgina Wilson joined the team as a marketing director along with Martine Cajucom as the creative director. Together, they rebranded the company and started selling sunglasses under the line, Sunnies by Charlie. By February 2014, the directors decided to change the company name to Sunnies Studios and dropped Charlie due to the increasing popularity of the sunglasses line. In 2015, the brand was recognized by Ayala Malls for Store Operations Excellence during the 17th Ayala Merchant Rewards night and was also awarded by SM Supermalls as the Best in Marketing under the VisMin category during its first ever SM Partners' Summit.

The brand was recognized once again by Ayala Malls as the Store of the Year in Glorietta during the 18th Ayala Merchant Rewards night. In 2016, Sunnies Studios launched a prescription eyewear arm under the name Sunnies Specs Optical. Coming off the popularity of their sunglasses, they wanted to offer an option to those with optical needs. People could now visit Sunnies Specs Optical stores and order prescription eyewear that would be ready for pick up within the day. Customers could select any frame, regardless of the material‚Äîhandmade acetate, flexible TR90 resin or stainless steel, with single vision lenses for a standard price of P1,999. Later on, they rolled out different lens upgrades that could be added to their complete eyewear package. In March 2019, Sunnies Studios launched their first multi-brand concept store in SM City Cebu. It was the first retail space to house Sunnies Studios, Sunnies Specs Optical, Sunnies Face and Cup Point inside one destination. Sunglasses and Prescription Eyewear The brand currently has over 200 styles with all Sunnies products being designed in-house. They are currently sold in over 120 retail locations around the Philippines.

Later on in 2018, Sunnies Studios revealed local celebrity, James Reid as their newest celebrity endorser.  Cup Point  Cup Point was first launched as part of the Sunnies Studios concept store in Cebu. Cup Point was created by Sunnies Specs Optical to support customers' wait time while their prescription eyewear is being processed. Customers can enjoy signature coffee and blends while waiting for their Sunnies Specs order or simply enjoy the space.  Sunnies Face  In August 2018, the highly anticipated cosmetic brand, Sunnies Face, was launched with Fluffmatte, a range of nine shades of matte lipsticks. Working with the largest cosmetics maker in the world‚Äîthe same one that creates products for the industry‚Äôs most celebrated names‚ÄîSunnies has access to some of the best quality formulas in the business.

Sunnies Cafe In 2016, Sunnies Studios ventured into the food industry with the opening of Sunnies Cafe. Sunnies Cafe opened its first store in Bonifacio Global City and its second store in SM Megamall. A third restaurant opened at Alabang Town Center by January 2017. The menu consists of comfort food with a modern twist and is constantly being updated with new dishes.  Sunnies World  In September 2019, Sunnies Studios opened their first flagship store, Sunnies World. The 260 sqm. space is their largest store, located at SM Mega Fashion Hall. It combines four of their brands‚ÄîSunnies Studios, Sunnies Specs Optical, Sunnies Face, and Cup Point‚Å† ‚Äîin one well thought out, beautifully designed space that took inspiration from modernist architecture. It was during this launch that the brand introduced an updated service that allows customers to get their prescription eyewear in 19 minutes or less. It‚Äôs the first Sunnies Specs location that has an in-house lab.  Hotel Sunnies  In November 2019, Sunnies Studios took over a hotel in Poblacion, Makati for a weeklong event. Every room was an interactive installation by design, and all of the Hotel Sunnies tour guides were team members behind all the Sunnies Studios brands ‚Äîincluding people from our marketing, creative, content and merchandising teams. Hundreds of guests were able to check in and hang out at the weeklong holiday experience.

It is notable because it demonstrates British technical accomplishment in the history of prefabricated building construction.  History  The development of a galvanising process in the 1840s, the fabrication of rolled sections of wrought iron from about 1850, and the use of grooved or fluted rollers to improve the production of corrugated iron in 1844 enabled construction of this building. It demonstrates the innovative solutions provided by the use of imported prefabricated buildings to cope with housing shortages caused by the gold rushes in Australia and California in the early 1850s. It is a rare example of a two- room prefabricated iron cottage and one of only a small number of this type of building remaining which date from the early 1850s. It is the only known curved roof single storey cottage extant in Victoria. It provides an example of the simple living conditions of some of the early settlers in Victoria. It is listed on the Victorian Heritage Register number H1131.http://vhd.heritagecouncil.vic.gov.au/search?kw=portable+iron+cottage+mount+duneed&aut;_off=1 It consists of two rooms and is believed to have been brought to Australia by Mr Joseph Williams with his family from England and lived in until a weatherboard house consisting of four rooms was erected in 1860 with further additions in the 1870s.

The Hat is a children's book written and illustrated by French artist and author Tomi Ungerer. Published in 1970 by Parents' Magazine Press, the book tells the story of a poor veteran, Benito Badoglio, who becomes rich after he unwittingly gains possession of a magic hat. The book is richly illustrated and the text contains numerous vivid and mellifluous descriptions and dialog. For example, upon meeting the hat, the protagonist cries, \\"Thunder of Sebastopole!\\"; in another scene, he shouts, \\"A thousand Potemkins!\\" Other characters in the book are \\"cutthroats\\", \\"brigands\\", a \\"fainting contessa\\", and a \\"dashing cadet\\". The author's interest in such colorful prose was explained by Selma G. Lanes in the Atlantic Monthly: \\"Ungerer feels strongly that children enjoy unfamiliar words and euphonious, mystifying phrases.\\" The setting for The Hat is nineteenth century Italy, and was described by Sydney D. Long in the Horn Book Magazine as \\"a never-never land ..., the comic-opera pictures [of The Hat] are full of mandolin-playing musicians, splashing fountains, and apple-cheeked peasant lasses.\\" The book ends much as it begins, with the migration of the hat from one prosperous owner to one of more dire circumstances. This cyclic plot device suggests the magic hat has led previous owners to similar changes of fate, and may continue to do so into the future. The book was published by French publisher L'√©cole des loisirs in 1971 under a title of slightly different meaning: Le Chapeau Volant (The Flying Hat).  Synopsis  The Hat begins with a portrait-like illustration of a magic hat flying through the air. The text describes it as \\"a tall black top hat, shiny as satin and belted with a magenta silk sash.\\" We soon learn that it has recently blown from the head of a wealthy man seated in a speeding open carriage. His wife beside him advises him not to mind that the hat has blown away; though, it is clear from the man's expression that losing his hat greatly concerns him. Before long, the hat alights upon the head of the book's protagonist, Benito Badoglio, a poor and disabled veteran. Soon thereafter, Benito is witness to a series of potentially disastrous events. He quickly realizes that the hat can perform heroic deeds on command: it catches a flowerpot falling toward the head of a pedestrian; it returns the escaped \\"purple puffbird, the only one in captivity\\", to the National Zoo; and it rescues a baby, captive within a burning carriage, as it careens down a long flight of stairs. For some of these acts Benito is rewarded with money, and he soon becomes a rich man. After rescuing her from a runaway carriage with his magic hat, Benito wins the heart of a noblewoman and the couple soon marry. But on the night of their wedding, as the bride and groom speed toward their honeymoon, the hat flies away from Benito's head. \\"Never mind the hat\\", says his bride, and the hat continues to fly away into the night. On the last page, a person drowning in a river can be seen far off in the distance; perhaps this is the new owner of the hat.  Characters  The characters in the book are: * Benito Badoglio: The protagonist who has possession of the hat. * A wealthy tourist: The first person Benito helps with his magic hat. He fills Benito's hat with \\"banknotes and other valuables\\". * The Director of the National Zoo: He rewards Benito with \\"one thousand millicentos\\" for capturing the purple puffbird. * Capitano Mallamorte: Leader of a military unit waiting to destroy the hideout of a \\"band of cutthroats\\". * Contessa Aspi d'Istra: The Archduke's sister-in-law who is saved by Benito's magical hat and later marries Benito. * The Archduke: He appoints Benito to the role of \\"Minister of National Emergencies\\".

At some point in its history, Gaspare Paoletti di Rodoretto was made Count, presumably due to his military proficiency. The Count of Rodoretto lineage begins with the aforementioned Gaspare Paoletti Conte di Rodoretto dell Perero Presidente Reggente de la Gran Camelleria del Regno di Serdegna sometime before 1800s. Afterwards it continues to Giacinto Paoletti di Rodoretto Maggiore d'amanta. Then Giuseppe Paoletti. Next is Jacinto (Written as Giacinto in the family tree) Paoletti who was the father of Maria Luisa Paoletti who was the last Countess of Rodoretto. At some point in the lineage, most likely around the 1860s, the family moved out of the Kingdom of Italy into the Mexican empire, where Maria Luisa was born on June 21, 1874.  End of the Lineage  Jacinto Paoletti decided to leave every possession and title to Maria Luisa Paoletti due to the life-style choices of his son, Jose Paoletti who pursued a career in opera and arts while Maria Luisa studied languages and piano. However, after Maria Luisa Paoletti married Adolfo Dollero, they travelled to Europe where Adolfo cheated on the Countess with his secretary and took all of Maria Luisa's possessions and titles and left her stranded in France. After several years of maintaining herself with piano lessons, her family managed to help her return to Mexico. Several years later and after spending everything and falling ill, Dollero returned to Maria Luisa. Both died in Mexico.

It is a shrub with crowded, needle-shaped leaves and mostly red, or red and green flowers on the ends of the branches from spring to early summer. Description Beaufortia burbidgeae is a shrub which sometimes grows to a height of or is a spreading shrub across. The leaves are needle-like, long and crowded on the woody stems. The flowers are arranged in heads on the ends of the branches and on short side branches. The flowers have 5 sepals, 5 petals and 5 bundles of stamens. The stamen bundles are deep red at their bases and pale green or pink on the ends, and hairy on the inner surface. There are 3 to 5 stamens in each bundle and the free ends of the stamens are a further long. Flowering occurs from August to May but mostly in spring and early summer and is followed by fruit which are woody capsules, long and wide and sometimes clustered. Taxonomy and naming Beaufortia burbidgeae was first formally described in 2016 by Andrew A. Burbidge and the description was published in Nuytsia. The specific epithet (\\"burbidgeae\\") honours Nancy Tyson Burbidge, the aunt of the author. Distribution and habitat Column beaufortia grows in or near laterite on hills in heath and woodland, occasionally in sand. It occurs between Brookton, Corrigin and Boolanelling Nature Reserve in the Avon Wheatbelt biogeographic region. Conservation Beaufortia burbidgeae is classified as \\"Priority Three\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that it is poorly known and known from only a few locations but is not under imminent threat.

She currently plays as an outside hitter for the Petron Tri-Activ Spikers. She played with the Philippine Super Liga All-Stars in the 2016 FIVB Club World Championship. Early life A native of Nueva Ecija, she was born (second to three siblings) to Araceli Harding (n√©e Dionisio) and Pedro Molina with the former who later became estranged from the latter and married to an India-based to British engineering consultant. Harding was an open hitter playing for the Central Luzon State University volleyball team in the State Colleges and Universities Athletic Association (SCUAA). She was supposed to join the Philippine women's national volleyball team that will participate in the 1991 Southeast Asian Games, but it was discontinued due to earlier marriage, and her work in a company based in Macau. Molina grew up in the town of Aliaga and moved to Cabanatuan to attend the Araullo University (later transferred to College of Immaculate Conception) for her secondary studies. She was more involved in athletics due to her father's connection with the sport initially uninterested in volleyball. Career Molina started playing volleyball on her fourth year in high school. In 2008, she was recruited to be the part of the Cabanatuan's secondary girls' volleyball team for the Central Luzon Regional Athletics Association. She was scouted by George Sucaldito and Nemecio Gavino from the San Beda College. She then became part of the college's women's volleyball team, the San Beda Lady Red Spikers. Molina along with Janine Marciano was part of the team that ended in the Final Four at NCAA Season 87 but her team struggled in the next season. Molina's team ended in the Final Four again in NCAA Season 89 but Molina's participation was disrupted by an injury which meant that she didn't finish the season. She played for the PNP Lady Patrollers of the Shakey's V-League after she recovered from her injury. Molina was then recruited by the Petron Blaze Spikers of the Philippine Super Liga and was named 2nd Best Outside Hitter at the 2015 PSL All-Filipino Conference which was won by Petron. Molina has also participated in internationally competing at the 2016 Thai-Denmark Super League 2016 as part of the Petron-Philippine Super Liga All-Stars.

He is known for his works in the roles of the immune system in the development of cancer. His research on tumor-associated macrophages (TAM, an acronym he coined) established inflammation as one of the causes of cancer. He was the first to identify monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 / CCL2 in 1983, and PTX3 in 1997. His works revealed the existence of decoy receptors in cell-signalling. He has been the most cited scientist in Italy, and one of the ten most cited immunologists worldwide.  Biography  Mantovani was born in Milan on 29 October 1948. He studied medicine at the University of Milan and graduated (summa cum laude) in 1973. In 1976 he earned a specialization in oncology at the University of Pavia.

Between 1978 and 1979 he was a visiting fellow at the Laboratory of Immunodiagnosis at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. In 1979 he was appointed Senior investigator in the Department of Tumor Immunology and Chemotherapy at the Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche \\"Mario Negri\\" in Milan. He became the Chief of Laboratory of the institute in 1981. In 1987 he worked at the Laboratory of Molecular Immunoregulation of NIH in Frederick, Maryland, as an Eleanor Roosvelt UICC Scholar. In 1994 he was promoted to Full Professor of General Pathology in the School of Medicine at the University of Brescia. He became Head of the Department of Immunology and Cell Biology at Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche \\"Mario Negri\\" in 1996. Between 2001 and 2014, he also served as Full Professor of General Pathology in the School of Medicine of the State University of Milan. Then he continued as Full Professor of General Pathology at Humanitas University in 2014. In 2005 he became the Scientific Director of Istituto Clinico Humanitas and President of Fondazione Humanitas per la Ricerca (under Humanitas University).  Research activities  Following the deepening of the studies by Robert Evans and Peter Alexander on the role of macrophages in tumour formation, Mantovani discovered that macrophages, rather than helping to shrink the tumor, help it to grow and progress. He gave the acronym for such tumor-associated macrophages as TAM. His work in 2013 showed that targeting TAM is useful for cancer treatment. In 1983, his research team has discovered a protein, known as monocyte chemotactic protein - 1 / CCL2, which is part of the large superfamily of chemokines, which belong to the family of cytokines. His works help to establish the concept of \\"decoy receptors\\". From the study of the regulation of the cytokines, Mantovani was able to identify the operating principle of the decoy receptor for interleukin - 1. In 1993, his team showed interleukin-1 type II receptor acts as a decoy in the activity of interleukin 1. His team identified the first member of the long pentraxins, named PTX3 in 1997. The discovery was published in a series of papers. His team demonstrated in 2005 that the chemokine receptor D6 acts as a decoy and scavenger receptor for inflammatory chemokines. In 2015 his research, published in the journal Cell, showed that PTX3 gene is capable of curbing cancer by controlling inflammation.

The third named storm of the annual typhoon season, Mirinae formed on July 25, 2016 as a tropical depression in the west of Luzon, Philippines. On July 26, it moved west-northwestwards, it had become a tropical storm and made landfall in Hainan Island, China. During July 27, it intensified into a severe tropical storm and made landfall over Red River Delta in Northern Vietnam late on July 27 and dissipated during the next day. In Hainan, economic losses by the storm reached US$56.9 million. In Vietnam, by July 29, the storm had left five people dead and five others missing. Severe damage to infrastructure was reported in Northern Vietnam, with damage to power lines causing blackouts and power cuts in some areas. Mirinae also sank 12 boats, destroyed the roofs of 1,425 houses and uprooted about 5,000 trees. Total damage in Vietnam reached US$288.8 million. Meteorological history Mirinae was first noted as a tropical depression during July 25, as it moved off the west coast of Luzon into the South China Sea, about to the east of the Paracel Islands. The system's well defined low level circulation centre was located in a very favourable environment for further development, with low vertical windshear and very warm sea surface temperatures. Later that day the JTWC initiated advisories on the system and classified it as Tropical Depression 05W, as it moved north-westwards along the periphery of a subtropical ridge of high pressure. During the next day, as the system moved west-northwestwards, it continued to intensify was named Mirinae by the JMA after it had become a tropical storm. Mirinae subsequently weakened slightly as it made landfall later that day, near Wanning and crossed Hainan Island, before it re- intensified as it had moved into the Gulf of Tonkin. The system was classified as a severe tropical storm by the JMA during July 27, as it was estimated that Mirinae had peaked with sustained wind-speeds of . The system subsequently made landfall about to the south of Hanoi in northern Vietnam later that day. Mirinae subsequently weakened gradually over northern Vietnam, before it was last noted during July 28, as it dissipated to the north of Hanoi. Preparations and impact During July 26, the Stand By Signal No.1 was hoisted for the Chinese territories of Hong Kong and Macau by the Hong Kong Observatory and the Macao Meteorological and Geophysical Bureau.

Etymology There are many myths and legends associated with the name Sillery. It is said to be a portmanteau derived from the word Sillery, which is a plant that grows in abundance in the region. Geography Location Sillery Gaon is located at . Sillery Gaon is situated at an altitude of 6000 ft. The area offers views of the Mt. Kangchenjunga and its is allied peaks and the Teesta River. This area also abounds in cinchona plantation, which was introduced in the region by the British as a source of quinine used for the treatment of malaria. An attraction for tourists visiting Sillery Gaon is Sangchen Dorjee Monastery, which was built during the Bhutanese rule in Pedong. Area overview The map alongside shows the Kalimpong Sadar subdivision of Kalimpong district. Physiographically, this area forms the Kalimpong Range, with the average elevation varying from . This region is characterized by abruptly rising hills and numerous small streams.It is a predominantly rural area with 77.67% of the population living in rural areas and only 22.23% living in the urban areas. While Kalimpong is the only municipality, Dungra is the sole census town in the entire area. The economy is agro-based and there are 6 tea gardens in the Gorubathan CD block.In 2011, Kalimpong subdivision had a literacy rate of 81.85%, comparable with the highest levels of literacy in the districts of the state.While the first degree college in the subdivision was established at Kalimpong in 1962the entire subdivision (and now the entire district), other than the head- quarters, had to wait till as late as 2015 (more than half a century) to have their first degree colleges at Pedong and Gorubathan.

Such nanowires have promising applications in lithium ion batteries, thermoelectrics and sensors. Initial synthesis of SiNWs is often accompanied by thermal oxidation steps to yield structures of accurately tailored size and morphology. SiNWs have unique properties that are not seen in bulk (three-dimensional) silicon materials. These properties arise from an unusual quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and are the subject of research across numerous disciplines and applications. The reason that SiNWs are considered as one of the most important one-dimensional materials is they could have a function as building blocks for nanoscale electronics assembled without the need for complex and costly fabrication facilities. SiNWs are frequently studied towards applications including photovoltaics, nanowire batteries, thermoelectrics and non-volatile memory. Applications Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, silicon nanowires are a promising candidate for a wide range of applications that draw on their unique physico-chemical characteristics, which differ from those of bulk silicon material. SiNWs exhibit charge trapping behavior which renders such systems of value in applications necessitating electron hole separation such as photovoltaics, and photocatalysts. Recent experiment on nanowire solar cells has led to a remarkable improvement of the power conversion efficiency of SiNW solar cells from <1% to >17% in the last few years. Charge trapping behaviour and tuneable surface governed transport properties of SiNWs render this category of nanostructures of interest towards use as metal insulator semiconductors and field effect transistors, with further applications as nanoelectronic storage devices, in flash memory, logic devices as well as chemical and biological sensors. The ability for lithium ions to intercalate into silicon structures renders various Si nanostructures of interest towards applications as anodes in Li-ion batteries (LiBs). SiNWs are of particular merit as such anodes as they exhibit the ability to undergo significant lithiation while maintaining structural integrity and electrical connectivity. Silicon nanowires are efficient thermoelectric generators because they combine a high electrical conductivity, owing to the bulk properties of doped Si, with low thermal conductivity due to the small cross section. Synthesis Several synthesis methods are known for SiNWs and these can be broadly divided into methods which start with bulk silicon and remove material to yield nanowires, also known as top-down synthesis, and methods which use a chemical or vapor precursor to build nanowires in a process generally considered to be bottom-up synthesis. Top down synthesis methods These methods use material removal techniques to produce nanostructures from a bulk precursor *Laser beam ablation *Ion beam etching *Thermal evaporation oxide-assisted growth (OAG) *Metal-assisted chemical etching (MaCE) Bottom-up synthesis methods *Vapour liquid solid (VLS) growth ‚Äì a type of catalysed CVD often using silane as Si precursor and gold nanoparticles as catalyst (or 'seed'). *Molecular beam epitaxy ‚Äì a form of PVD applied in plasma environment *Precipitation from a solution ‚Äì A variation of the VLS method, aptly named supercritical fluid liquid solid (SFLS), that uses a supercritical fluid (e.g. organosilane at high temperature and pressure) as Si precursor instead of vapor. The catalyst would be a colloid in solution, such as colloidal gold nanoparticles, and the SiNWs are grown in this solution Thermal oxidation Subsequent to physical or chemical processing, either top-down or bottom-up, to obtain initial silicon nanostructures, thermal oxidation steps are often applied in order to obtain materials with desired size and aspect ratio. Silicon nanowires exhibit a distinct and useful self-limiting oxidation behaviour whereby oxidation effectively ceases due to diffusion limitations, which can be modeled. This phenomenon allows accurate control of dimensions and aspect ratios in SiNWs and has been used to obtain high aspect ratio SiNWs with diameters below 5 nm. The self-limiting oxidation of SiNWs is of value towards lithium ion battery materials. Orientation of nanowires The orientation of SiNWs has profound influence on the structural and electronic properties of the systems. For this reason several procedures have been proposed for the alignment of nanowires in chosen orientations. This includes the use of electric fields in polar alignment, electrophoresis, mircofluidic methods and contact printing. Outlook There is significant interest in SiNWs for their unique properties and the ability to control size and aspect ratio with great accuracy. As yet, limitations in large-scale fabrication impede the uptake of this material in the full range of investigated applications. Combined studies of synthesis methods, oxidation kinetics and properties of SiNW systems aim to overcome the present limitations and facilitate the implementation of SiNW systems, for example, high quality vapor-liquid-solid‚Äìgrown SiNWs with smooth surfaces can be reversibly stretched with 10% or more elastic strain, approaching the theoretical elastic limit of silicon, which could open the doors for the emerging ‚Äúelastic strain engineering‚Äù and flexible bio-/nano- electronics.

Wielding knives and wearing fake explosive belts, the men took six people captive and later killed one of them, 85-year-old priest Jacques Hamel, by slitting his throat, and also critically wounded an 86-year-old man. The terrorists were shot dead by BRI police as they tried to leave the church. The attackers, 19-year-olds Adel Kermiche and Abdel Malik Petitjean, had pledged allegiance to Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, which claimed responsibility for the attack.Attentats en France : ce que l'on sait de Rachid Kassim, membre pr√©sum√© de l'EI sur france24.com le 12 septembre 2016.  Attack  At about 9:45 am on 26 July 2016, two men wielding knives and a handgun entered the 16th-century church of Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray as Mass was being held. Hamel, three nuns, and two parishioners were taken hostage and ordered to sit together in a group. One attacker wore a fake explosive belt and the other wore a backpack made to look like it carried a bomb. The handgun was later described as an \\"old, non-functioning pistol\\". A hostage said the attackers filmed themselves and \\"did a sort of sermon\\" at the altar in Arabic. On the recording, which was later found by police, the attackers also shouted \\"you Christians are eliminating us\\". The attackers forced Hamel to kneel at the foot of the altar and then slit his throat while screaming \\"Allahu akbar\\". Hamel had tried to resist, pushing his attackers away with his feet while saying \\"go away, Satan\\".The Irish Time, \\"Murdered French priest said ‚Äògo away, Satan‚Äô to attackers\\", Aug 2, 2016 Another hostage, an 86-year old parishioner, was ordered to photograph or film the priest after he had been killed. The attackers then knifed him, leaving him critically wounded. The other hostages were largely unhurt. After the killing, the two men talked with the nuns about the Koran. One also warned \\"as long as there are bombs on Syria, we will continue our attacks\\". During the killing, one nun hostage ran outside without the perpetrators noticing. She stopped a passing motorist, who alerted the police.\\"Les terroristes ont mis le pr√™tre √† genoux\\" : la s≈ìur qui a lanc√© l'alerte √©voque une sc√®ne d'\\"horreur\\" Closer. 26 July 2016 After police arrived at the church, they tried to negotiate with the two men through a small window opening on to the sacristy. Armed police then tried to enter the church and end the siege, but the attackers had lined the hostages up in front of the door, as human shields. At about 10:45 am, the hostages fled the church, followed by the two attackers. One wielding a handgun, they charged at police shouting \\"Allahu akbar\\" and were shot dead by officers from Rouen's Research and Intervention Brigade. Within hours of the attack, the ISIL-linked Amaq News Agency said that the attack was carried out by two \\"soldiers\\" from the group, in response to ISIL's general call to attack countries of the coalition fighting it. On 27 July, Amaq published a video of the two perpetrators pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.  Jacques Hamel  Jacques Hamel (born 1930 in Darn√©tal) was named a vicar at the St.-Antoine church in Le Petit-Quevilly in 1958, a vicar at the Notre-Dame de Lourdes church in Sotteville-l√®s-Rouen in 1967, a parish priest at Saint-Pierre-l√®s- Elbeuf in 1975 and a parish priest in Cl√©on in 1988. He joined the church at Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray in 2000 and assumed his role as the parish's auxiliary priest in 2005. With Mohammed Karabila, the president of Normandy's Regional Council of the Muslim Faith, he worked on an interfaith committee.  Perpetrators  One of the attackers was identified as Algerian-born 19-year- old Adel Kermiche. Kermiche, who lived in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray, had twice in 2015 attempted to travel to Syria. He was once returned by Germany, and once turned back by the authorities at the Turkish border. As a result, he spent time in a French jail before being released in March 2016. Kermiche was released after writing to the judge \\"I am a Muslim based on the values of mercy, kindness (...) I am not an extremist,\\" and insisting that he recited his prayers twice a day and \\"wanted to see his friends and marry\\". The prosecutor opposed his release. Upon his release, he was electronically tagged and a curfew was placed on him, requiring him to live at his parents' home, which was near the church, and to leave his house only between 08:30 to 12:30 and 14:00 to 18:00. Manuel Valls, Prime Minister of France, said the release of Kermiche was a \\"failure\\" of the French justice. Kermiche's writings were found after his death, in which he spoke of meeting his \\"spiritual guide\\" in a French prison, he called this guide his \\"sheikh,\\" who \\"gave him ideas\\". Kermiche's fianc√©e was Sarah Hervouet, a \\"convert to Islam,\\" and one of the Paris bomb plot conspirators. On 28 July, the second attacker was named by investigators as French-born 19-year old Abdel Malik Petitjean. He had been \\"on the radar of the police since June 29\\", after he also tried to enter Syria from Turkey. French intelligence had received his picture four days before the attack, but they were not given a name or description at that time the prosecutor's office said. He was born in Saint-Di√©-des-Vosges, in Lorraine and grew up in Aix-les-Bains, southeast France. He was a student of commerce and finance who converted to Islam a few years before the attack. His mother told reporters that he had been visiting a cousin in northeast France before the attack and that she did not know how he had ended up in St.-√âtienne-du- Rouvray.  Investigation  Police raided a house in the suburb after the attack and arrested one person. The incident is being investigated by anti- terrorism judges. Police were said to be trying to identify members of a closed channel on the messaging app Telegram, on which Kermiche had posted, as part of an effort to establish how the perpretators had met. According to French daily Le Parisien, citing sources close to the investigation, Kermiche and Petitjean met on Telegram 4 days only before the attack. Petitjean then travelled to Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray, 700 km from his hometown Aix-les-Bains, the following day. A 29-year-old French ISIS fighter from Roanne was suspected of having influenced, if not controlled, the two perpetrators from his base in Iraq or Syria, also via Telegram. Two men, suspected of having been aware of Kermiche and Petitjean's plans, were charged with conspiracy and taken into custody in the weeks following the attack. One was a 30-year-old cousin of Petitjean, and the other a 21-year-old who had travelled from Toulouse to meet the perpetrators in Saint-√âtienne-du-Rouvray two days before the attack. Background Mass is scheduled for each weekday at 09:00 at the church; Hamel celebrated that day acting as a substitute for the parish priest. Andrea Tornielli, writing for the Vatican Insider, says \\"this is the first time a priest has died inside a European church\\". The same journal cites other deaths of Catholic priests in the West at the hands of common thieves or anti- religious people, as well as attacks by Islamists in Africa and Asia. Sid Ahmed Ghlam, who allegedly planned to attack a Villejuif church in April 2015, was reported to have had a list of churches which included Saint-√âtienne-du- Rouvray church. Reactions French Prime Minister, Manuel Valls, said on Twitter, \\"the whole of France and all Catholics have been hurt. We will stand together\\". Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said that Pope Francis was being kept up to date with developments and that he felt pain and horror at the \\"absurd violence\\". The Archbishop of Rouen, Dominique Lebrun, who was attending the World Youth Day in Krak√≥w, Poland, said in response to the attack: \\"I cry out to God with all men of goodwill. I would invite non- believers to join in the cry. The Catholic Church cannot take weapons other than those of prayer and brotherhood among men\\". Cardinal Stanis≈Çaw Dziwisz, archbishop of Krak√≥w asked the participants of the WYD to pray for all the victims of the recent terrorist attacks, especially for Jacques Hamel ‚Ä≥who was murdered today while celebrating the Eucharist in France.‚Ä≥ Cardinal Se√°n O'Malley, Archbishop of Boston, who was also attending the World Youth Day, was asked whether Hamel could be declared a martyr and confirmed that \\"it was a question of hatred of faith\\". The interview explained that \\"the Church requires that the individual was killed for such a reason\\" in order to become a martyr. Speaking of the response by Catholics to Muslims, Cardinal O'Malley added \\"To demonise Islam that's always the great danger ‚Ä¶ we have to be very clear we are not painting everyone with the same brush. The BBC reported that the attack sparked a wave of \\"prayer, solidarity and Christian imagery\\" on social media. and according to BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, \\"the selection of a church by the attackers ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ crosses a new red line in the grim history of recent attacks on continental Europe\\". Mohammad Karabila, President of Normandy's Regional Council of the Muslim Faith and imam of a local mosque said of Kermiche, \\"We're not going to taint Islam with this person\\" and \\"We won't participate in preparing the body or the burial\\". The mayor's office will decide whether the body is buried in the town.\\"Muslims Refuse To Bury Priest Killer Kermiche\\", from Sky News On July 30, Muslims attended Mass in churches across France and in Italy, as a sign of respect for the murdered priest. On 31 July, several copies of the Quran at the multi-faith room of Mater Dei Hospital in Malta were desecrated when slices of pork were laid inside the books. The perpetrators also left a photo of Jacques Hamel with the caption \\"Victim of Islam\\". Similar attacks In February 2017, The New York Times reported that the 2016 Normandy Church attack was part of a group of at least other four knife attacks in France in a span of 13-months, including the Louvre machete attack of 2017 and the 2016 Magnanville policeman's family stabbing.

The mine was granted permission by the government in 2007, despite being refused permission by Blyth Valley Council, with an initial agreement to mine 3.4 million tonnes of coal, 2 million tonnes of shale and 750,000 tonnes of fireclay. This was subsequently extended by two years in 2011 to allow an additional 2 million tonnes of coal to be mined, set to end in 2016. An additional expansion approved in 2014 saw two new pits being opened on the site, Shotton Triangle (290,000 tonnes of coal) and Shotton South West (250,000 tonnes of coal), with the end date pushed back a year to October 2017. Once the mine closes, the land was expected to be restored by 2019. Caterpillar 777 haul trucks on the mine In total, over 8% of British coal output comes from the Shotton site. The mine produced over one million tonnes of coal in 2014 and employs around 150 people. These jobs are temporary, although when the mine closes some former employees may be transferred to Banks' new site at Highthorn, near Druridge Bay. The land on which the mine was developed is owned by science writer and Conservative hereditary peer Matthew White Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley, who is a prominent climate change sceptic. As a result, the site has been protested by the \\"Keep it in the Ground\\" fossil fuel divestment campaign, who picketed the site and halted operations for the day on 26 October 2015. Royalties from the site go to the Government, but the Blagdon Estate receives a way leave payment estimated at between three and four million pounds.

The Lake also used to be a source of water supply to the city of Mysore but over the years, sewage and excessive land encroachments (mostly illegal) and blockage of water flow sources almost led to the eutrophication of the lake.

Biography  Charlotte Bergman was born in Antwerp in 1903. She was the daughter of a Polish-born diamond merchant. Charlotte Bergman married Louis Bergman, an English architect with whom she shared a great love of travel and art. They resided in London for many years and traveled to Israel and the Middle East for the first time in the 1920s. They came into contact with many artists, including Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore and many others. They were very close to Raoul Dufy, a friend who often joined the couple on their travels. The Bergmans collected examples of Dufy's art, including a portrait he painted of Charlotte. Other artists collected by the couple included Braque and Chagall, as well as Antal Bir√≥. Charlotte and Louis Bergman found themselves in the United States at the outbreak of the Second World War. They never returned to live in England. Charlotte lost many members of her European family during the Holocaust. In New York City, the Bergmans were involved with the leading events and personalities of the day. Their apartment became a salon for music, art and politics and they became fervent supporters of the Zionist movement and the nascent State of Israel. After Louis Bergman died in 1955, Charlotte continued to travel and collect new works of art. She immigrated to Israel following the Six-Day War. Sharing Teddy Kollek's early vision for a national museum in Jerusalem, she was involved in the establishment of the Israel Museum. She also became an active, though often anonymous, supporter of other philanthropic concerns in the country. In the 1970s, Charlotte Bergman built her permanent home on the Museum grounds, with the encouragement of Teddy Kollek. Bergman located her collections of art and ethnography there. Just as she did in New York, in Jerusalem, Charlotte hosted may events and welcomed visitors from Israel and abroad to her home. On July 17, 2002 - one month before her 99th birthday - Charlotte Bergman died in her bedroom, today referred to as the Henry Moore room. The house and its paintings, sculptures, ceramics and works on paper were bequeathed to the Israel Museum. Charlotte Bergman asked that the house be used as a venue for special events, as it was in her lifetime, and that it be viewed as the home of an art lover at the end of the 20th century, in the spirit of the Israel Museum's period rooms. The legacy of Charlotte Bergman lives on in the house she built on the Israel Museum's grounds.

Oatway is a member of the picture agency Panos. Emmanuel Sithole images On April 18, 2015 Oatway was on assignment for the Sunday Times covering Xenophobic violence in Alexandra Township in Johannesburg when he photographed a group of South African men beating and stabbing Emmanuel Sithole, a Mozambican trader. Oatway and his colleague, reporter Beauregard Tromp, took Sithole to a nearby clinic but were told that no doctors were on duty. They then took Sithole to Edenvale Hospital where he died shortly after arrival. The photographs were published on the front page of the Sunday Times the following day and caused outrage across the region. The South African National Defence Force (SANDF) was deployed to Alexandra the next day in an attempt to quell the violence. South African President Jacob Zuma said that the pictures were ‚ÄúUnpatriotic‚Äù and ‚Äúmake South Africa look bad.‚Äù Four men were arrested and three men were convicted of Sithole‚Äôs murder. Mthintha Bhengu was sentenced to 17 years in prison; Sifundo Mzimela was sentenced to 10 years in prison and another youth was released with a suspended sentence. In handing down the sentence, Magistrate Lucas Van der Schyff said: \\"This specific murder trial caught the entire country's attention because it was caught on camera. We were forced to witness this gruesome attack. By looking at the photos we were forced to share his pain, as he laid in the mud begging for mercy,\\" Controversy James Oatway was heavily criticized for not having intervened to save Emmanuel Sithole‚Äôs life. Oatway told TIME ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have any regrets about taking the pictures,‚Äù adding: \\"I think my presence there distracted them and did discourage them.\\"http://time.com/3831517/emmanuel-sithole-south-africa/ In response to criticism that the pictures were published he said:\\"It‚Äôs not easy to look at and I understand that some people might be offended by that, but really people have to know what‚Äôs happening, and people have to see the brutality and the vulgarity of what‚Äôs going on, so I‚Äôve got no regrets that it‚Äôs on the front page,\\". Oatway wrote an article about his experience of the incident which was published in the Sunday Times. According to Oatway his only regret was that he wasn't able to get Sithole to a hospital in time to save his life.http://time.com/3831517/emmanuel-sithole-south-africa/ Greg Marinovich, the Pulitzer prize winning photographer and author of The Bang-Bang Club defended Oatway‚Äôs actions. He wrote: \\"Would Oatway sleep better had he been able to save Sithole? Surely the answer is yes, but the photographer's duty was to capture those searing images and hope that society will act.\\" In 2010 Oatway was in Haiti covering the aftermath of the devastating earthquake that struck the Caribbean country. He was one of a group of photographers who photographed the death of Fabienne Cherisma, a fifteen-year-old girl who was allegedly shot by police during the unrest that had taken hold of Port-au- Prince. Oatway‚Äôs images of the dead Cherisma featured in a portfolio that was awarded an ‚ÄúAward of Excellence‚Äù in the Pictures of the Year International Awards (POYi).

It is a threatened species with excessively low numbers in the wild, and is nationally listed as critically endangered. Description Grevillea batrachioides is a shrub which typically grows to a height of and has glaucous branchlets. It has pinnate leaves that are long, wide with their edges rolled under. Irregularly shaped pink inflorescence located on a raceme at the end of the branchlets from October to December. A simple brown hairy ellipsoidal, ribbed fruit follows. Taxonomy and naming Mount Lesueuer grevillea was first formally described in 1986 by D.J. Mc Gillivray from an unpublished description by Ferdinand von Mueller. The specific epithet (batrachioides) is derived from the Ancient Greek word batrachos meaning \\"frog\\" with the ending oides meaning \\"likeness\\" referring to a similarity of this plant to those in the subgenus Batrachium of Ranunculus known as \\"water buttercup\\". Conservation Declared as a rare flora in 1992, G. batrachioides was later nationally ranked as Critically Endangered when assessed in 2000. Although it has not yet been assessed by the IUCN, it meets Red List Category ‚ÄòCR‚Äô under criterion D. Only one population exists numbering 45 adult plants and 13 juveniles in 2002.

Reviews include those in Der Spiegel, Hamburger Abendblatt, and Morgunbla√∞i√∞. Style and themes With a female protagonist, Sunna, who presents herself as often rather bewildered by the world around her, written in the first person and in an often confessional tone, and drawing on stream-of-consciousness styles, Vetrars√≥l satirises chick-lit. As in other work by Au√∞ur, the novel meditates extensively on motherhood and mother-daughter relations. The plot is structured around Sunna's peripheral involvement in a police hunt for a missing woman, her ex-flatmate and friend Arnd√≠s; Sunna's peripheral position enables the novel also to satirise the melodramatic character of crime fiction. Summary The novel is set in Reykjavik. Sunna recounts events in her life running from December 1 to 9 in an unspecified year. These events are intertwined with her recollections of her time as a student in the Raval district of Barcelona about ten years before. In the novel's present, Sunna's partner Axel leaves for a business meeting in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur, but his ex-wife has asked him at short notice to look after his son by his first marriage, Helgi. Axel is then trapped in √çsafj√∂r√∞ur by bad weather for the rest of the novel‚Äîthough it transpires at the end that the main reason for his delay is his desperate and failed attempts to rescue his ailing business. Sunna, despite having spent little time with Helgi previously, has to care for him throughout the novel, and their developing relationship is an important thread. Much of the novel is framed by Sunna's attempts to juggle her work as an under-appreciated employee at a publishing house with looking after Helgi, often with the help of her mother, a characterful working-class left-winger. At the beginning of the novel, Sunna sees in the news that Arnd√≠s Th√©od√≥rsd√≥ttir has gone missing. She and Arnd√≠s had been flatmates while students in Barcelona, and much of the novel comprises Sunna's reminiscences about this time. It emerges implicitly through Sunna's account that Arnd√≠s is an outgoing but also domineering character, with a tendency to islamophobia structured through her feminism (which implicitly overlooks the insights of postcolonial feminism). While in Barcelona, Arnd√≠s gets to know an illegal immigrant from Morocco, Fat√≠ma. Sunna acquires a Spanish boyfriend, Jordi, and gets pregnant by him, and is guided by Arnd√≠s to get an abortion. With the encouragement of Helgi and her mother, framed by their participation in a class on writing crime novels which Sunna is involved in running as part of her work, Sunna makes some effort to investigate Arnd√≠s's disappearance. Arnd√≠s's previous husband, Benni, was murdered while working as a doctor in Africa; Sunna discovers that he was involved in a company called Futura Nostra that harvested human egg-cells from people in poor countries in return for providing medical care. Sunna meets Arnd√≠s's new partner, Gar√∞ar, but fails to be much help. This contact does lead her later to encounter Arnd√≠s's young daughter by her first marriage, Hera. After this point, she is followed by three young men who at one point corner her and threateningly ask where Arnd√≠s is. Sunna thinks she may recognise one; the police later warn Arnd√≠s that these men may be terrorists. Eventually, Sunna divines that Arnd√≠s must be hiding in an art gallery she has set up at Stokkseyri, and finds her there. Revealing that she has guessed that Hera is actually Fat√≠ma's daughter and not Arnd√≠s's, Sunna forces Arnd√≠s to explain what is going on. It emerges that Fat√≠ma had been raped and got pregnant. She was afraid to admit this to her family, fearing ostracisation. Arnd√≠s convinced her to disguise the pregnancy, to give birth a secret caesarian section operation performed by Benni, and to give Arnd√≠s and Benni the baby, which they would pretend was their own. By Arnd√≠s's account, Fat√≠ma died of infection as a result of the operation and was secretly interred by Benni. When Benni was murdered, Arnd√≠s also pointed the police to Fat√≠ma's brothers. The three men who threatened Sunna were indeed Arnd√≠s's brothers: when she heard they had come to Iceland, Arnd√≠s fled. The novel ends without neat resolutions. Arnd√≠s collects Hera from school and flees the country; Sunna realises she is pregnant, and looks forward to motherhood; she is glad to have established a relationship with Helgi; she puts her relationship with Arnd√≠s behind her; and she must steer the family through Axel's latest business failure.

The event took place on November 5, 2016, in Osaka, Osaka, at the Edion Arena Osaka. It was the sixth event under the Power Struggle name and featured ten matches, main evented by Tetsuya Naito defending the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Jay Lethal. Storylines Power Struggle featured ten professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less distinguishable characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. (Left to right) Tetsuya Naito, Evil and Bushi of the Los Ingobernables de Japon stable, who were all involved in title matches at Power Struggle Power Struggle was headlined by a four match series involving members of the villainous Los Ingobernables de Japon (L.I.J.) stable taking on representatives of NJPW. In the main event, L.I.J. leader Tetsuya Naito was originally scheduled to make his first defense of the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Michael Elgin. This would have been a rematch from the September 25 Destruction in Kobe event, where Naito defeated Elgin to become the new IWGP Intercontinental Champion. Following the win, Naito began disrespecting the title belt, stating he did not want it, throwing it in the air and stepping on it, drawing the ire of Elgin. On October 10 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Elgin pinned Naito in an eight-man tag team match and afterwards stated he was getting the IWGP Intercontinental Championship back. The match was officially announced the following day. However, that same day, it was also reported that Elgin had suffered a broken left eye socket taking a dropkick from Naito in the King of Pro-Wrestling match. On October 12, Elgin confirmed he would need surgery on the eye. The following day, NJPW officially pulled Elgin from the Power Struggle main event and replaced him with Ring of Honor (ROH) wrestler Jay Lethal. Lethal had joined L.I.J. during a show co- produced by NJPW and ROH on February 20, 2016, however, the alliance ended on August 20, when he had a falling out with Naito. Afterwards, Lethal aligned himself with Elgin and the rest of the NJPW wrestlers not affiliated with any particular stable. On September 30 at ROH's All Star Extravaganza VIII event, Lethal defeated Naito in a non-title match, setting himself up for a future shot at the Intercontinental Championship, which was now granted due to Elgin's injury. Another title match would see Katsuyori Shibata make his fourth defense of the NEVER Openweight Championship against L.I.J. member Evil. After successfully defending the title against Kyle O'Reilly at King of Pro-Wrestling, Shibata was confronted by Pro Wrestling Noah representative Go Shiozaki, seemingly setting him up as the next title challenger. However, after Shiozaki had left the ring, Shibata was attacked by Evil, who laid him out and then posed with the NEVER Openweight Championship belt. The following day, NJPW announced that Evil would get the title shot at Power Struggle, while Shiozaki would get Shibata in a non-title match at Noah's October 23 event, which Shibata went on to win. Shibata and Evil previously met during August's G1 Climax, where Evil was victorious, ending Shibata's hopes of advancing to the finals of the tournament. Kushida, who challenged for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship at Power Struggle The IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship would also be defended at Power Struggle with defending champion, L.I.J. member Bushi, taking on challenger Kushida in his first title defense. This is a rematch from the September 17 Destruction in Tokyo event, where Bushi defeated Kushida to capture the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. Afterwards, Bushi publicly complained about NJPW's policy of automatic rematches, indicating he did not want to face Kushida in a rematch. However, after laying out Kushida following an eight-man tag team match at King of Pro-Wrestling, Bushi nominated Kushida as his next challenger as Kushida was being stretchered out of the arena. NJPW stated that Kushida would miss all events on the Power Struggle tour, excluding the Power Struggle event itself, with a neck injury. The fourth match in the L.I.J. versus NJPW series would see Hiroshi Tanahashi taking on L.I.J. member Sanada. The two previously faced off during the 2016 G1 Climax, where Sanada scored an upset win over Tanahashi, submitting him with the Skull End finishing hold on the opening day. On October 8, Tanahashi pinned Sanada in an eight-man tag team match and afterwards stated he wanted another singles match with him. Power Struggle's fourth title match would see the Guerrillas of Destiny (Tama Tonga and Tanga Loa) defend the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Chaos members Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi. On October 10 at King of Pro-Wrestling, Tonga and Loa defeated The Briscoe Brothers (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) to recapture the IWGP Tag Team Championship. Following the match, Tonga and Loa, along with their Bullet Club stablemates The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson), continued attacking the previous champions. This led to Tomohiro Ishii, whose Chaos stable had previously partnered with the Briscoes, trying to make the save, but was stopped by Tonga and Loa hitting him with their double-team finishing maneuver, the Guerrilla Warfare. Afterwards, Ishii recruited Chaos stablemate Yoshi-Hashi as his partner to try to capture the IWGP Tag Team Championship from Tonga and Loa. Power Struggle was also set to feature the finals of the fifth annual Super Jr. Tag Tournament. The first two rounds of the eight-team tournament took place between October 21 and October 30. In the semifinals on October 30, Roppongi Vice (Beretta and Rocky Romero) defeated Fuego and Ryusuke Taguchi, while ACH and Taiji Ishimori defeated David Finlay and Ricochet, setting up a final between the two teams. Beretta and Romero entered the tournament in the midst of a storyline, where the two had begun showing signs of dissension, while ROH wrestler ACH and Noah wrestler Ishimori entered as the winners of Noah's 2016 NTV G+ Cup Junior Heavyweight Tag League. The match was officially announced on October 31. On August 14, during the final 2016 G1 Climax event, NJPW aired a video that featured a \\"time bomb\\" with a countdown timer set to go off on November 5 at Power Struggle. The rest of the matches were announced on October 31. Added were two six-man tag team matches and two eight-man tag team matches. One of the matches, which takes place between the Bullet Club and Chaos stables, was designed to build up the main event of Wrestle Kingdom 11 in Tokyo Dome between Chaos' IWGP Heavyweight Champion Kazuchika Okada and Bullet Club's number one contender Kenny Omega. Event Roppongi Vice (Beretta [standing] and Rocky Romero [prone]) after winning the 2016 Super Jr. Tag Tournament The first title match of the event saw the Guerrillas of Destiny make their first successful defense of the IWGP Tag Team Championship against Tomohiro Ishii and Yoshi-Hashi by pinning Yoshi-Hashi with their double-team finishing maneuver, Guerrilla Warfare. Next up was the finals of the 2016 Super Jr. Tag Tournament between the team of ACH and Taiji Ishimori and Roppongi Vice, which Roppongi Vice won after hitting ACH with the Strong Zero double-team move. Following the win, Romero challenged The Young Bucks for the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, leading to a staredown between the two teams. The next match saw Kushida defeat Bushi with the Hoverboard Lock to regain the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship. Following the match, the \\"time bomb\\" was revealed as the returning Hiromu Takahashi, who challenged Kushida to a title match at Wrestle Kingdom 11. In the eight-man tag team match between Kazuchika Okada's Chaos stable and Kenny Omega's Bullet Club stable, Bullet Club emerged victorious with Omega pinning the reigning IWGP Heavyweight Champion with his finishing maneuver, Katayoku no Tenshi. The event concluded with a three-match series involving the Los Ingobernables de Japon stable. In the first match, L.I.J. member Evil defeated Katsuyori Shibata to become the new NEVER Openweight Champion. In the next match, Hiroshi Tanahashi avenged a loss from the 2016 G1 Climax by defeating Sanada. Finally, in the main event, Tetsuya Naito made his first successful defense of the IWGP Intercontinental Championship against Jay Lethal. Following the match, Naito was challenged to a match at Wrestle Kingdom 11 by Tanahashi. Aftermath Ten days after Power Struggle, NJPW presented a show in Singapore, where Katsuyori Shibata defeated Evil in a rematch to regain the NEVER Openweight Championship.

The Long Trail bisects the forest from north to south, and the New Boston Trail accesses the Long Trail from adjacent U.S. Forest Service land in Green Mountain National Forest. The Green Mountain Club maintains the trail. A snowmobile corridor trail is maintained by the Vermont Association of Snow Travelers. The forest was a gift to the State of Vermont in 1956 from Governor Redfield Proctor. It is managed by the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation.

He also tried to promote the interests of the Jewish community.  Life  Frederick Stern was born into the wealthy Stern merchant banking family, the son of James Julius Stern and Lucie Stern-Biedermann, and the brother of Henry Julius Joseph Stern, Elsa Stern, Violet Stern and Sir Albert Gerald Stern. He studied at Eton College, and at Christ Church, Oxford. He bought Highdown, an estate near Worthing, Sussex, in 1909 and lived there for the remainder of his life. In 1919 he married his wife Sybil, daughter of Sir Arthur Lucas, a portrait painter.  Professional career  Stern joined the Second Company of the London Yeomanry and served during the First World War. He was Group Commander of the West Sussex Home Guard. He was active in Gallipoli and Palestine and received the Military Cross in 1917. He eventually attained the rank of colonel. He was present at Paris Peace Conference, 1919, where he supported the British prime minister David Lloyd George as private secretary.  Botanical and horticultural achievements  Stern collected plants between 1900 and 1910, working with Reginald Farrer, Frank Ludlow, Joseph Rock, and George Sherriff. In 1914 he financially participated in a plant collecting expedition by Farrer and William Purdom to Yunnan and Kansu. He cultivated some of the novelties collected in Yunnan and Gansu in his garden at Highdown. Other plant hunters sent new plants to Stern, and he acquired an extensive collection of plants from Veitch & Son in 1912. Over the years, Stern introduced many new plants to the garden and created new hybrids of Berberis, Eremurus, hellebore, lily, Magnolia, rose and snowdrop, among which Magnolia 'Highdownensis' (probable cultivar of M. wilsonii), rambler roses 'Coral' (a triploid R. sinowilsonii hybrid), 'Weddingday' (1950, R. sinowilsonii hybrid), and Rosa √óhighdownensis (1928, R. moyesii hybrid). He is also the author that first described the snowdrop Galanthus rizehensis. Herbarium specimens of some of the plants from Highdown Gardens are kept at the Natural History Museum, London. He was awarded the Victoria Medal of Honour by the Royal Horticultural Society in 1941. He was chairman of the John Innes Horticultural Institute from 1947 to 1961, vice-president of the Royal Horticultural Society in 1962 and vice- president and treasurer of the Linnean Society from 1941 to 1958. Stern was knighted in 1956 for his services to horticulture. Several plants species have been named in his honour, such as Buddleja sterniana (now B. crispa), Cotoneaster sternianus, Helleborus √ósternii (= H. argutifolius √ó H. lividus) and Paeonia sterniana.

Prior to her government career, Suprun served as Director of Humanitarian Initiatives for the Ukrainian World Congress. Suprun is the founder of the nongovernmental organization Patriot Defence, which is devoted to developing tactical and emergency medical care in Ukraine. After moving from the United States to Ukraine in 2013, she was appointed Director of the School of Rehabilitation Medicine at Ukrainian Catholic University and became an advisor to the Committee on Health of the Verkhovna Rada in 2015. On 22 July 2016, she was nominated First Deputy Minister of Healthcare by Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman; the nomination was supported by President Petro Poroshenko and confirmed by the Cabinet of Ministers. A week after taking office as Deputy Minister, Suprun was elevated to acting Minister of Healthcare due to the position's longstanding vacancy. Ukrainian citizenship was conferred upon Suprun by Poroshenko in July 2015 and Ukraine's Immigration Service has repeatedly stated that her citizenship status is not under question. Early life and education Suprun was born on 30 January 1963 in Detroit, Michigan to parents George Harry and Zenovia Jurkiw, of Ukrainian descent. She has a sister named Lydia. Suprun attended Immaculate Conception Ukrainian Catholic School in Warren, Michigan. In her youth, Suprun was a member of Plast. After finishing high school, Suprun enrolled in Wayne State University in Detroit. She graduated with a bachelors of science degree in biology in 1985. Following her graduation from university, Suprun attended Michigan State University College of Human Medicine in East Lansing, Michigan, where she graduated with her Doctor of Medicine degree in 1989. Afterwards, Suprun completed her intermediate residency with the Oakwood Health System in Detroit, and later worked as a diagnostic radiology resident at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. From 1994 to 1995, Suprun undertook postgraduate research in mammography and tomographic radiology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. She is board certified in radiology. Career Suprun speaking in Toronto in 2015. In 1995, Suprun began working at a women's medical imaging center in New York City. She left this position in 1999, after being named acting Director of Women's Imaging at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. In 2000, she returned to the New York medical imaging center when she became deputy chief physician-radiologist. Suprun later became deputy medical director and partner at the medical center. She left the position in 2009. While in the United States, Suprun was active in a number of medical and Ukrainian-American organizations. She has served as a member of the supervisory boards of the First Volunteer Mobile Hospital (FVMH) and the Ukrainian Congress Committee of America (1990‚Äìpresent), as director of the Council of Humanitarian Aid for Ukrainians (UCCA) from 1997 to 1999, and as president of the Ukrainian American Civil Liberties Association from 2000 to 2009. In 2013, Suprun and her husband left the United States and moved to Ukraine. They became active in the 2014 Ukrainian revolution, and Suprun performed medical procedures for those injured during Euromaidan. This led to her being named Director of Humanitarian Initiatives for the Ukrainian World Congress. Suprun later founded Patriot Defence, a nongovernmental organization (NGO) that provides tactical medical training and distributes NATO first aid kits to Ukrainian servicemen. Following her work during Euromaidan, Suprun became the founder and was appointed director of the School of Rehabilitation Medicine at Ukrainian Catholic University in Lviv.  Minister of Healthcare  Suprun speaking before the Verkhovna Rada in 2018. On 12 July 2016, President Petro Poroshenko announced his support for a proposal by Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman to appoint Suprun as First Deputy Minister of Healthcare. She had previously been serving as an advisor to the Committee on Health of the Verkhovna Rada since 2015. After serving for a week, Suprun was elevated to the position of acting Minister of Healthcare. She was succeeded as Deputy Minister by Pavlo Kovtonyuk, Oleksandr Linchevsky, and Oksana Syvak. On 30 November 2016, ten resolutions regarding laying the foundations for reforming the Ukrainian healthcare system, as well as resolving operational issues in the management of the medical sector were adopted by the Government. Specifically, the resolutions focused on healthcare financing reform, development of a national health strategy, establishment of hospital districts, approving of licensing conditions for the conduct of economic activities for the production of medicinal products, as well as two resolutions which allocated more than ‚Ç¥867 million to healthcare reform. On 1 April 2017, the Government and the Ministry of Healthcare launched the Affordable Medicines program, and allocated ‚Ç¥500 million to the program. Through the program, patients would receive medications for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and bronchial asthma for free or with a small surcharge. By that July, 6,179 pharmacies had begun taking part in the program. By August, the program was allocated an additional ‚Ç¥20 million for further growth. On 8 June 2017, the Verkhovna Rada adopted the Draft-Law #6327, which would introduce a new model of financing the healthcare system in Ukraine. On 19 October, the Verkhovna Rada passed the law on its second reading. It went into effect on 30 January 2018. After being conferred Ukrainian citizenship, and submitting all necessary paperwork in compliance with Ukrainian law, Ukraine's immigration service has confirmed several times that her citizenship status does not violate Ukrainian law. Ihor Mosiychuk, a known Russian operative and a former deputy of the Verkhovna Rada, filed a nuisance case against Suprun which argued that she could no longer remain an acting minister for more than a month because of his poor understanding of the nomination procedures in Ukraine's Cabinet of Ministers. On 5 February 2019, a Kiev court ruled that Suprun could not sign documents but could remain an acting minister because of this. On 14 February, the court reversed their own decision, allowing Suprun to continue serving as acting Minister of Healthcare. Mosiychuk's case has since been dismissed. Critics opposed to the medical reforms began referring to Suprun deragotorily, employing the moniker Dr. Death (). It continues to reappear in several websites, some of which are notorious traffickers in disinformation. https://24tv.ua/healt/ru/otkuda_u_suprun_prozvishhe_doktor_smert_n1162597https://ukranews.com/news/635470-suprun- otvetila-zelenskomu-na-ego-shutkuhttps://www.uaportal.com/ukr/news/doktor- smert-zvidki-tse-prizvisko-u-suprun-i-yak-jogo-pidhopiv-zelenskij- video.htmhttp://www.ukrweekly.com/uwwp/in-brussels-zelenskyy-underscores- ukraines-course-toward-nato-and-the-european-union/ She left the position on 29 August 2019, after Zoriana Skaletska was appointed Minister of Healthcare in the Honcharuk Government.

The rolling hills characterizing the area inspired the name \\"Bacolod\\" from the Hiligaynon word \\"buklod,\\" meaning \\"hilly terrain.\\" Establishment When the townsfolk came back to the old Magsungay settlement in 1788 to establish the pueblo of Bacolod, a smaller village was left and the place was called \\"Kamingawan\\", which is Hiligaynon for \\"place of sorrows,\\" due to the silence left by the population decrease. However, Kamingawan was created as a pueblo in its own right, renamed \\"Granada\\" in 1854 with Aquilino Sausao as the first presidente municipal. Dissolution It was dissolved, along with the town of Sum-ag, and incorporated to Bacolod in 1902 upon the dissolution of the Republic of Negros and the reorganization initiated by the American Insular Government of the Philippine Islands. Present area Currently, the land area of modern Sum-ag is significantly smaller than the original town. Alangilan, Vista Alegra and Estefania were constituent territories carved our from Granada, leaving it as the most rural barangay of Granada.

Life Domenico di Nicolantonio was born on 13 January 1778 in L'Aquila as the last of six children to Gabriel di Nicolantonio and Santa de Arc√°ngelo. His childhood nickname was \\"Cicchetti\\". He tended to the fields as a shepherd on Mount Morrone in his childhood until the recognition of his call to the religious life in 1801. He entered the convent of the Order of Friars Minor - Saint Nicholas it was called - in Arischia in 1802 where he would serve as both a cook and gardener in addition to begging for alms until 1815. He assumed the name of \\"Mariano da Roccacasale\\" and became vested in the Franciscan habit on 2 September 1802 as a religious rather than as an ordained priest. He commenced his period of novitiate in 1802 and made his vows in 1803. He relocated to Bellegra in Rome in 1915 and there served as a porter where he was to welcome the poor as well as pilgrims. He collapsed at the foot of the altar - on 23 May 1866 - while in meditation before the Eucharist; he was rushed to his bed and predicted his imminent death and so asked to receive the sacraments for the final time before he died. He died on 31 May 1866. Beatification The beatification process opened in Subiaco in an informative and apostolic process that had been designated in collecting all available documentation and interrogatories pertaining to the late Franciscan's life and saintliness; the Congregation of Rites validated these processes when the documentation was sent to Rome. He became a Servant of God on 12 December 1895 under Pope Leo XIII after the formal introduction of the cause. He became titled as Venerable - on 3 May 1923 - after Pope Pius XI confirmed the fact that the late religious had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle that confirmed his beatification was the cure of the infant Luigi Reposini (b. December 1916) from a severe case of encephalitis on 28 March 1918. It received diocesan investigation in Velletri from 1925 until 1926 and received C.O.R. validation on 18 April 1928. The cause remained inactive until 6 March 1997 when a board of medical experts approved the miracle and also received approval on 7 October 1997 from a team of theologians; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved it as well on 3 March 1998 while Pope John Paul II issued his final approval on 6 April 1998. The pontiff beatified the Franciscan friar on 3 October 1999 in Saint Peter's Square.

In addition to lecturing and writing about art, he served as Chairman of the Special Committee for White House Paintings under both President Kennedy and President Johnson. Fosburgh and his wife, Mary (\\"Minnie\\") Cushing, were prominent art collectors in New York City.  Early life  James Whitney Fosburgh was born in New York on August 1, 1910. He was the son of James Boies Alleyne Fosburgh (1879‚Äì1926) and Leila Whitney (d. 1913). After his mother's death in 1913, his father married his mother's younger sister, Eleanor Newton Whitney (1887‚Äì1930). His father, who was from Buffalo, New York, was also a Yale graduate.

White House  Throughout the Kennedy administration, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy endeavored to restore the interiors of the White House and bring historical character to the space. Soon after her husband took office, Kennedy formed the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, naming Henry F. du Pont Chairman and serving herself as Honorary Chairman. In November 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy and Henry F. du Pont established a Special Committee for White House Paintings, part of the Fine Arts Committee for the White House, and appointed Fosburgh head of the new group. Until that point, the expertise and interests of Fine Arts Committee members had been largely focused on antique furnishings, not pictures.Hunter, Marjorie. \\"Mrs. Kennedy Leads Hunt for Art to Grace White House.\\" The New York Times (November 26, 1961): 78.

It was owned by racketeer Paul \\"Skinny\\" D'Amato, and operated from the 1930s until the building burned down in 1973. It became one of the most popular nightspots on the East Coast, and housed the first illegal casino to be run in the city. The main bar was large and black, with black and white zebra-patterned wallpaper on the walls of the room. An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. The club and bar were destroyed in an electrical fire in June 1973, resulting in $1.5 million worth of damage. Subsequent plans to rebuild or reopen the club in a megaresort hotel in Atlantic City amounted to nothing in the years leading up to D'Amato's death in 1984. History The 500 Club was originally owned by Phil Barr. In 1942, Paul \\"Skinny\\" D'Amato, who was known to have ties to organized crime, assumed ownership. Summers and Swan claim that Amato was in fact a front man for mobster Marco Reginelli. That year, the club was refurbished as a musical bar with a small dance floor and was known as the 500 Cafe. Drink prices started at 40 cents, with a 20 percent discount for men in uniform, and suppers started at one dollar. In June 1946, D'Amato and his partner, Irvin Wolf, were able to buy out the half interest of Marco Di Fozio. They changed the venue's name to the 500 Club and were now the sole owners of the business. D'Amato became the sole owner of the venue shortly before his 1949 marriage. The names of the celebrities who performed at the club were written in cement on the sidewalk in front of it, similar to Grauman's Chinese Theatre. Celebrities often dropped by the club, including Joe DiMaggio, \\"who had his own table and his own waitress to serve him free drinks\\". Like other clubs in Atlantic City, the 500 Club was patronized by both whites and African-Americans. Mobsters and politicians were frequent patrons, with the former \\"making deals\\" with the latter; these guests were never presented with a bill. During D'Amato's tenure, the 500 Club began attracting top-name talent. It opened at 5 p.m. and closed at 10 a.m. The last show was at 4 a.m., while illegal gaming at \\"roulette wheels, craps tables, baccarat and high-stakes card games\\" went on in the back rooms. The door to the back rooms was beyond the main showroom and was guarded by a doorman; it opened on D'Amato's nod or word. D'Amato shut down the illegal casino in the early 1950s in the wake of pressure on organized crime exerted by the Kefauver Committee in the United States Senate and expanded the supper club aspect. In 1955 the club expanded its show seating capacity to 700. Architecture and fittings The main bar was large and black with curves in many directions. The room had black and white zebra- patterned wallpaper, in the style of New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings. Acts The 500 Club became one of the most popular nightspots on the East Coast, regularly attracting top-name talent. Performers included Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., Martin and Lewis, the Will Mastin Trio, Jimmy Durante, Eartha Kitt, Patti Page, Sophie Tucker, the Jackie Paris Trio, Milton Berle, Nat King Cole, and Liberace, among many others. Martin and Lewis in 1948 Frank Sinatra called on his friendship with D'Amato to perform at the club in the 1940s when his career was at a lull. He regularly performed there from the 1940s through to the 1960s, each time doing all four shows and waiving his fee. During Sinatra's engagements at the club in the 1950s, the 500 Club marquee read simply, \\"He's Back\\". Comedian Pat Henry started as Sinatra's opening act at the 500 Club in 1958, continuing in that capacity in Las Vegas and other Sinatra venues for the next two decades. In 1960 New York AM radio station WNEW garnered 129,837 entries for its drawing for three couples to accompany disc jockey William B. Williams to a Sinatra performance at the 500 Club followed by a hotel stay. Sinatra was questioned about his association with Mafia gangster Tommy Lucchese by the United States House Select Committee on Crime in 1972, but said that he had only met Lucchese during his performances at the 500 Club. Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis paired up to do slapstick comedy for the first time at the 500 Club on July 25, 1946. While Martin was trying to get gigs as a singer, Lewis performed as a comedian at the club. One night a different act failed to show up and Lewis suggested to the owner that he hire Martin to do comedy with him. The owner was skeptical, but the two went ahead and tried to devise an act on paper in their hotel room, which did not work. The next night, they went on stage and improvised for three hours, bringing the house down. The comedy duo of Martin and Lewis was popular in nightclubs and in film from 1946 to 1956. After he and Jerry Lewis broke up their act, Dean Martin did not perform at the club again until August 1962. Martin was originally billed as a solo act, but was joined by both Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis, Jr. at the midpoint of his engagement. The three performed as \\"The Rat Pack\\" until Martin's engagement at the club was over; this was the last time the Rat Pack performed in Atlantic City. Davis, Martin, and Sinatra performed their three night Rat Pack act at the club for no fee. The club was in financial difficulty at the time; they were all close friends of D'Amato and had been helped by him in earlier times. A private recording was made of the August 26, 1962 5AM show at the 500 Clubthe last performance of the Rat Pack there. It was later distributed as a souvenir to patrons of the now defunct Sinatrarama Room at Philadelphia's Latimer Cafe. The club continued to have financial problems in the 1970s. The Internal Revenue Service closed the club for back taxes in August 1971. D'Amato was allowed to reopen in November 1971 after an agreement was reached regarding payment of them. Fire and aftermath The club was destroyed in an electrical fire that burned for four hours in June 1973, with over 200 firemen fighting the fire. The blaze, which also destroyed a next-door restaurant and bar, resulting in $1.5 million worth of damage, was believed to have originated in a dressing room. The building was not insured. D'Amato said in response to the news of the fire, which had taken place shortly after a refurbishment, \\"I was born on this street, if I can, I'll rebuild it, but I don't know how\\". In 1976, after a New Jersey referendum approved the establishment of casino gambling in the state, D'Amato said he hoped to re- establish the 500 Club at one of the city's resort hotels. D'Amato believed that legalized gambling would be good for both the city and for those with businesses related to the entertainment industry. He was committed enough to the idea to appear on television's 60 Minutes to voice support for the pro- gambling cause. He died in 1984 without realizing his ambition. The parking deck of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino now occupies the site. There is an historical marker honoring Paul \\"Skinny\\" D'Amato near the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and 500 Club Lane, which is near the former location of the 500 Club. Legacy At the end of the 20th century, plans were floated to recreate the 500 Club either at the Trump Marina Hotel Casino or at the Sands Hotel and Casino, but neither materialized. D'Amato's daughter Paulajane, who grew up in an apartment over the 500 Club, is now a member of the 500 Club Committee, which sponsors benefit concerts. In September 2015 the Philly Pops recreated the 500 Club in a Philadelphia restaurant, featuring performances by Deana Martin and Michael Andrew.

She is the founder of Volontariat, a Puducherry-based non governmental organization engaged in social welfare activities since 1966. She is a recipient of several honors such as Legion of Honour from the Government of France, Order of the Crown from the King of Belgium, Doctor Schweitzer Award and the Independence Day Award from the Government of Puducherry. The Government of India awarded her the fourth highest civilian honour of the Padma Shri, in 2016, for her contributions to society.  Biography  Madeleine de Blic, n√©e Madeleine Herman, was born in Liege in Belgium and, after her marriage to Arnaud De Blic who was her classmate in the French School, she traveled to India in 1962, initially with an aim to do social service for one year. Her husband, who was doing military service as a teacher in connection with French Lyc√©e, was stationed in Puducherry, a French colony during that time, and Madeline accompanied him to the coastal town where she worked at a maternity hospital run by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Cluny. Her early activities included distribution of medicines to the needy patients by travelling on a bicycle which gave her the opportunity to witness the misery of the poor residents of the town and the nearby villages. Assisted by a few young people of the area, she started a small dispensary at Uppalam, a village near the hospital she worked, and also carried out milk distribution to the poor children. The efforts were streamlined under the aegis of a new organization, Volontariat, in 1966. Madeleine-Arnold couple has two children and they have also adopted two destitute children.

Completed in 1874, the tower is constructed of tapered granite and was designed by David and Thomas Stevenson. The need for the light on Chicken Rock was identified as early as 1866, due to the problem of fog obscuring the two lights on the nearby Calf of Man. As these lights formed a transit with the Chickens, the loss of any one exposed shipping to danger. History Detail of the tower Approval to start work on the lighthouse was given in 1868. Constructed of granite blocks forming a tapered tower, with a lantern room and single gallery, it was designed by the two brothers, David and Thomas of the Stevenson lighthouse engineering family. At the same time as overseeing this project, they were also involved in the building of the lighthouse on Dubh Artach in Scotland. Construction finished in December 1874, with the first official lighting day taking place on 1 January 1875. The total cost was ¬£64,559 (equivalent to ¬£ as of ). The light was originally fuelled by paraffin, although the type of fuel used and whether the optics should display a red sector light was a matter of dispute between David and Trinity House. A fire heavily damaged the interior of the lighthouse on 23 December 1960. The three lighthouse keepers, one of whom suffered burns from the fire, were rescued by the Port St Mary RNLI lifeboat. Although the lighthouse was repaired following the fire, it was not used by any resident keepers again, and was instead automated in 1961. The lighthouse continues to be operated and maintained by the Northern Lighthouse Board.

Being their eighth and last child, his birth was a shame to his mother and a worry to his father, who conceived him in an advanced age. Born into a modest family, the young Habib was raised in a female environment and was marked by gender inequality. Despite his financial conditions, Ali Bourguiba decided to invest his money in the education of his son and therefore, avoid him his fate of being enrolled in the army. Likewise, he sent his son to Tunis, circa 1907, to live with his brother M'hamed, in order to study in elementary school of Sadiki. Separated from his mother at 5, he lived in modest conditions in the capital city, and the Jellaz Affair made a deep impression on him. In 1913, he obtained his Certificat d'√©tudes primaires to the relief of his father, exempting him from military service and permitted him to pursue his secondary education in Sadiki. However, in the same year, he lost his mother at the age of 10, which marked his entire life. While Bourguiba began his secondary education, World War I started. If his was studious, he soon had health issues in his final year of studies because of the budget restrictions imposed by the school to support war effort. In order to heal, he was sent to his brother Muhammed, who lived in Kef. Influenced by colonial inequalities, he decided to pursue with law studies and therefore, fight against the French protectorate. Supported by his brother Mahmoud, who enrolled him in the French Lyc√©e Carnot. Two events in which he was part during his youth made a strong impression on him: The return of Abdelaziz Th√¢albi from exile and the protests of April 5, 1922, which increased his nationalist aspirations. In 1924, he got his baccalaureate, as valedictorian and flew to Paris in order to pursue his Higher education. In the French capital city, he enrolled in the Law school of Sorbonne and spent his time discovering the colonial civilization to \\"arm himself intellectually\\" against it. There, he met Mathilde Lefras, a fourteen-year older widow, with whom he had a relationship. In 1927, when he obtained a law licence, Mathilde gave birth to their son, Habib Jean Bourguiba. When he returned to Tunisia, Bourguiba married Moufida and searched for a job as a lawyer, to provide the needs of family. He quickly started a journalistic career in order to defend the Tunisian personality.  Ancestry   Paternal family  Bourguiba's paternal family originated from the Ottoman Empire nobility. In Albanian, Bourguiba meant \\"prisoner\\". The family lived in Istanbul before leaving the city for the Sirte coast in Libya. In 1795, the great-grandfather of Habib Bourguiba, Hadj Mohamed Bourguiba Al Kebir, left Tripolitania to settle in Tunisia, because of the eruption of troubles between Libya and the Ottoman Empire. Therefore, he moved to Monastir, in the \\"Tripolitanian quarter\\" with his family, wealth, fishers, his forty slaves and his doctor. Since then, Mohamed Bourguiba got richer and richer, aiding those in need and becoming known for his generosity. In 1805, his son Mohamed II was born. When his father died, Mohamed II inherited his wealth and then fructified it, becoming known, like his Mohamed El Kebir, for his help to the poor. A portrait of Ali Bourguiba, father of Habib. Years after they moved to Monastir, the Husainid Dynasty made many reforms for Tunisia to avoid the fate of Ottoman Algeria who had just being colonized by France, in 1830. The reforms included the establishment of new institutions in order to compete with Europe. But this attempt was a complete failure and ended with a financial crisis. In order to repay foreign loans, the Tunisian government raised the taxes of the mejba. But this resulted in dissatisfaction of the Tunisian people who decided to revolt in 1864. The uprising ended with a terrible repression: The bey decided to punish any person who had participated in the event. Therefore, the bey sent general Ahmed Zarrouk to Monastir in order to pacify the situation. Thus, he arrested the city's notables, including Mohamed Bourguiba and his brother, who were detained in a beylical camp settled at the west of the city. They were freed only with the family's efforts who sacrificed all their wealth, jewelry, money and properties. The youngest of Mohamed Bourguiba's sons, Ali, who was only 14, was responsible for bringing the ransom to the general's tent. He was noticed by Zarrouck who saw in him a good recrew for his troops and decided to enroll him in the army. Therefore, Ali spent 19 years of his life campaigning, before ending his military career with the rank of sergeant- in-chief and a quarterly pension of 11.25 francs. However, Mohamed Bourguiba died on the very night he got back home, in 1865. When he left the army, France had just taken full control over the country, with the signature of the Bardo Treaty on May 12, 1881 and the Conventions of La Marsa of June 8, 1883, which established the French protectorate with the approval of Sadok Bey. One year before its establishment, Ali Bourguiba, who was 30 years old, married Fattouma Khefacha, daughter of Ahmed Khefacha and Khadouja Mzali, which linked the Bourguiba family to the Mzali one (family of Habib Bourguiba's future prime minister Mohamed Mzali). Impoverished, the family was no more part of the local nobility. The family house was inhabited by the three children of Mohamed Bourguiba: his daughter Emna, who married Ahmed Sakka, his second son Hassan, and Ali and his wife. Fattouma gave to six boys ‚Äì Mohamed, Ahmed, M'hamed, Mahmoud, Younes who died at 3 months and later Habib ‚Äì and two daughters ‚Äì Nejia who had almost married the father of Mohamed Mzali and Aicha., In this context, the familial life of the three siblings was characterized by numerous arguments. Each of the siblings occupying a room, many fights started between sisters-in-law, their children or even the three children of Mohamed Bourguiba. Years later, Bourguiba stated that during one fight, his father draw his sword to threaten his brother Mohamed, who was armed with a gun and insisted on the numerous quarrels between sisters-in-law, jealous of Ali's wife, Fattouma who gave birth to six boys. With only one kitchen in the house, the women gathered to cook food together. Once, one of Habib's aunts by marriage, threw a handful of salt into Fattouma's cooking pot. Due to this, Ali was fed up with the unceasing tensions and decided to move out of his father's house. Appointed cheikh of the \\"Tripolitanian quarter\\" then councilman and agricultural expert, he could improve his family's conditions and move into a modest house known as Dar El Kouij and located on the cliff named Karrayia ( \\"Black holy\\" in Turkish) where they lived a year before moving into their own house. Its construction was supervised by Ahmed Sakka, the husband of his paternal aunt, Emna.  Maternal family  Fattouma Khefacha, was born in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized repudiation in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was \\"futile\\". Indeed, the divorce took place because Khadouja presented a cold meal to her husband. Once separated, Ahmed married another woman and founded a new family. Khadouja then, had no choice but to get back to her parent's place, in the \\"Tripolitanian quarter\\". It was in that house that Fattouma was raised, her mother refusing to remarry. In 1880, at the age of 15 or 16 years old, Fattouma married Ali Bourguiba, and upon the instance of her mother, wedded in her father's house, before parting for that of her groom. Khadouja, whose father died in 1884, moved into her daughter's house where they cohabited. Therefore, she helped with house chores, participating in supplies preparations and wool washing, at the seaside. She had a good relationship with her sister, A√Øchoucha Mzali, mother of the famous Abelaziz al-Aroui, who lived at the end of the same street. Despite that, Bourguiba stated that \\"in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that it to say, that of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand caf√©, my father, who held my hand, told me to go kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man. So I did what I was told and kissed him\\".  Family tree   Birth  Birth home of Bourguiba Bourguiba was officially born on August 3, 1903 in Monastir. However, there was a strong uncertainty related to his date of birth. According to his biographies, his date of birth may have been falsified in order to rejuvenate him, certain families avoiding to declare too early the birth of a boy in order to avoid circumcision, according to Samya El Mechat in her book La Tunisie et les chemins vers l'ind√©pendance. 1945‚Äì1956 (Tunisia on the roads of independence. 1945‚Äì56). During a conference he gave on October 12, 1973, Bourguiba stated that they referred to his birth with that of his cousin, Chedli Zouiten, being nine months older than him. He concluded that his birthday might be on August 3, 1902. Nevertheless, the doubt remained since he might actually be born in 1901 or even 1898. In 1955, Bourguiba declared: \\"I was born in 1901. But when I enrolled in law school in Paris, circa 1924, the secretary made a mistake and wrote 1903. As I were not a young student, I was satisfied with this date of birth and kept it\\". One of his ministers, Mahmoud El Materi, confirmed this hypothesis in his memoirs. Being the son of Ali Bourguiba and Fattouma Khefacha, who was 40 when he was born, Bourguiba stated that his mother was ashamed to conceive a child at that late age, her last pregnancy being seven years old at the time. Meanwhile, his father wondered whether he could raise his son at this old age. Habib Bourguiba later described his birth in these words: \\"When she conceived me, it was for her, the unfortunate, a catastrophe. She was already forty years old. Many of her pregnancies weakened her. I was told that when she gave birth to me, she was so ashamed of having a child at that age that she stifled her cries for deliverance while gritting her teeth with a towel placed in her mouth. Nevertheless, she was relieved to give birth to a boy, avoiding the catastrophe that would have been that of a girl. That was how Habib Bourguiba, last of his siblings was born.  1903‚Äì13: Childhood years   Early life in Monastir (1903‚Äì07)  Ali Bourguiba surrounded by his sons Mohamed, Ahmed, Mhamed, Mahmoud and the youngest: Habib. Despite his financial difficulties, Ali Bourguiba dedicated a great deal of attention to his children's education. This was criticized by his brother Mohamed who reproached him for giving too much consideration to their instruction. But he succeeded in providing good education for his children with his military pension, which led to their ascent in important jobs. His first born child, Mohamed, worked in Tunis as a nurse in Sadiki Hospital. Ahmed and Mohamed worked in the state administration. When Bourguiba was born, his brother, Mahmoud, was pursuing his studies in Sadiki College. In that year, Ali became councilman of Monastir, a job that helped him provide a modern education to Bourguiba. In 1901, Ali raised enough money to build his own house in the \\"Tripolitanian quarter\\", composed of two vestibules, three rooms and one patio. To achieve this, Khadouja Mzali, mother of Fattouma, sold her part of the Mzali's heritage to aid her daughter in ending the construction of the house. When Bourguiba was born, Ali, who was 53, became councilman and was part once again of the city's notability, which permitted him both to improve his social and financial situation but also provide a modern education future for his last son, just like his brothers. Habib was raised in a female environment, his brothers being in Tunis and his father being old. Therefore, he spent his days with his mother, grandmother and sisters, A√Øsha and Nejia, which permitted him to witness the household chores of women and the gender inequality with men. Bourguiba recounted his childhood in these words: \\"I was the youngest of all. As such, I was responsible for all chores. I was, in short, a domestic. I was responsible for keeping the jug and pour water on the hands of my elders, after meals. But I was the elder of nobody, and I had to manage all by own with the hudge container in order to wash my hands\\". Another fact also marked the childhood of Habib Bourguiba: Being the youngest of the family, he had to address his elders, including his brothers with the word \\"Sidi\\" (ser). However, the designation of his sisters was a problem of protocol. Even though they were older, their female gender did not give them a right of presence on young Habib. His father Ali, soon found a solution to the problem arguing that they had to call themselves with their respective first name, \\"no other difference hallmark\\". The young Habib soon noticed the low status of women in the beginning of the century.  Elementary education in Tunis (1907‚Äì13)  At first, Bourguiba was enrolled in the French-Arab elementary school of Monastir. There, he got close to a French teacher, Pierre Mounier-Pillet, and had kept contact with him for years, as they met forty years later in Cairo. But Ali, who wanted his son to have an exemplary education and chances like his brothers, sent him to Tunis in order to live with his brother M'hamed. In 1907, Bourguiba left Monastir toward Tunis, on board of Sousse train, which got him to the capital city, marked with the separation with his mother at 5 years old. He could only see his mother during summer vacations, after nine months of isolation. Years later, Bourguiba recounted that experience saying: \\"It was in 1907, such a journey at that time was not that easy. It was a real expedition. We went to Sousse thanks to a diligence that belonged to a Maltese named Carlo. This vehicle was dilapidated and needed the four or five passengers to get off in order to push it whenever we ascended a hill or retain the slope so that the hitch is not crushed. Arrived in Sousse, I had to take the train from the Bone-Guelma Company. It took four or five hours to reach Tunis\\". At his arrival, the city was marked with the fight against the protectorate and the emergence of the Tunisian national movement, led by Ali Bach Hamba. 1910 Class photo of young Bourguiba in Sadiki. Meanwhile, Bourguiba settled in the bourgeois neighborhood of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare the first half of the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic ; She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. \\"To go to school\\", he recalled, \\"I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother to buy me a new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education\\". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation. Nevertheless, young Habib spent his summer vacations in Monastir, among women who he helped with chores: help the servant called Fatma, bring the Baklava tray to the oven of uncle Hamida, monitor cooking then basting a ladle of honey or participating in the olive grove process. He also spent a lot of time with his father who insisted that he pursued with a studious education so he could avoid Ali's fate in the army: \\"I do not want you to be cut back like a workhorse. I do not want you to be like me, sentenced to wear a kit on your shoulders, all day long\\", did he say to his son. At the end of the holidays, he returned to his brother's in Tunis where, after lessons, he strolled streets and admired the bey coming, on each Thursday to the Kasbah, to chair the seal ceremony. He was also marked with the 2011 Jellaz Affair which ended with the execution of Manoubi Djardjar in Bab Saadoun, where he noticed the hostility and mocking laughter of preponderants. The exiles and repression following the Tramway boycott aiming to protest against the Jellaz issue, soon created an atmosphere of revolt and contestation. The year 1913 was for Bourguiba an important one: Working harder on his studies, he obtained his Certificat d'√©tudes primaires which dispensed him of military servitude by order of a beylical decree and to the grand relief of his father. Not only did his son avoid his fate just like his other sons, but he was also permitted to pursue his education in the Sadiki College, receiving financial coverage for his studies, which included \\"shelter, food, clothing, school supplies and even free hammam every 15 days for six years\\" until he graduated. However, his joy did not last: On October 1, he went back to Tunis in order to start the year in Sadiki College but during the first week of November 1913, \\"the superintendent called me out of class and announced me the death of my mother\\", Bourguiba stated in 1973. \\"I immediately returned to Monastir where I found my whole family surrounding my mother lying on the deathbed [...] The death of my mother had deeply shaken me. I was indelibly marked\\". As for him, no other event has been rougher that his mother's death: Neither his future remoteness in Bordj le B≈ìuf years later, nor his imprisonment in the Fort Saint-Nicolas in Marseille nor even his exile in Cairo. He stated that he had at least made her proud by obtaining his certificat d'√©tude primaire.  1913‚Äì24: Secondary studies   Sadiki years (1913‚Äì20)  After his mother's funerals, young Habib left his brother's house in Tunis to settle in the Sadiki dormitories. Prestigious teachers from Ez-Zitouna mosque like Mohamed Abdelaziz Dja√Øt taught him. \\"He taught us all the \\"moulakat\\" that I still know by heart and that I recite without needing to remind myself of them\\", he stated in 1973. He also learned Arabic grammar thanks to the cheikh Mohamed Belkadhi. Nevertheless, also French teachers marked him such as Mr. Colli√®res who taught him French. \\"I can assure you that neither in Lyc√©e Carnot nor, years later in university, did I have to acquire new skills to perfect this language [...] He had taught us the art of french writing. His teaching methods were remarkable. And if I learned to write articles in the admired perfect articulation and harmonious balance, it is to him that I owe that\\". Bourguiba in 1917 However, his start of secondary studies coincided with the beginning of World War I in September 1914 shortly followed with the school's financial problems, managed by a severe headmaster. Bourguiba stated that back in that time, food was terrible: They served them a stew with squash and a macaroni at lunch while giving them a donut wrapped in newspaper and smelling oil, at breakfast. These terrible conditions led the students to protest, despite the headmaster's efforts to end the revolt. When he questioned Bourguiba, the young Habib denounced these horrible conditions, declaring that he did not deserve to be treated in this manner. Thinking that he was about to be punished, nothing happened and the young boy learned to dare, speak and denounce. He was also marked by the education he had and which started in him the germs of revolt. In his before final year, Bourguiba admired a talented student named Habib Jaouahdou. Jaouahdo explained to the pupils what was happening outside the walls of Sadiki and telling them all about the nationalist movement. His Arabic skills are reinforced by a marking professor: Mohamed Lasrem, who was as old as Bach Hamba and that Bourguiba remembered by saying: \\"I have to recognize that it is thanks to him that we have learned, since then, to express ourselves and write in classical arabic. This language was, at first, taught, mainly in the form of various versions. We had to translate administrative letters\\". Slowly, he developed a patriotic feeling and went with his father, in April 1917, to the funerals of nationalist leader B√©chir Sfar in Jellaz cemetery. The emotion of the people there, such as his father, had a strong impact on his youth. During his conference of 1973, he described that day saying: Many important events succeeded such as the arrival of Abdelaziz Th√¢albi from exile. Therefore, Jaouahdou decided to gather people and form a group that would welcome the nationalist leader. Bourguiba participated and went, with his fellows to Th√¢albi's house in Pacha Street. Likewise, Bourguiba had to keep up with his school work to keep his ranks and be selected. On 32 students who started their first year with him, only 14 passed the exam for their final year. Bourguiba, internal and scholarship owner, must be careful with the final year results even though he was far from being one of the studious. His wretched life conditions worsened with his brother's marriage to Memia Saheb Ettaba√¢, daughter of a former minister. She wanted revenge on him for this misalliance with a poor family and made of his life a real hell. Even Bourguiba's entourage, full of wealthy beldis, were aware of social inequalities. In 1917, he failed his Arabic brevet which permitted him to access an administrative office. Despite his strictness and rigidity, the headmaster permitted him to remake the sixth and last year of high school in the 1919‚Äì1920 school year. But the cold of winter and junk food caused by deprivation on the initiative of the school headmaster who supported a War effort, worsened the boy's health. In addition, Bourguiba was hospitalized because of a primary infection, which led him to abandon high school and remain at the hospital. During the 1973 conference he held, he described that illness he had saying: \\"The sixth year was the final one, the diploma year of deliverance. Unfortunately, or fortunately for Tunisia, I fall ill in the last two months\\".  Journey in Kef (1920‚Äì22)  To heal and get better, Bourguiba's family sent young Habib to his brother Mohamed in Kef and therefore, enjoy natural landscapes and good mountain air. His brother, a 39 years old medic at the local hospital, was very appreciated by the inhabitants of the city. From January 1920, he welcomed his brother warmly for twenty one months. This long two years journey was a turning point in his life. Indeed, far away from the horrible school conditions and the abuse of both Dahouia and his sister-in- law, the skinny pale teenager could finally evolve into a confident man. His brother Mohamed played a major part in this change of personality, being open- minded, modernist and advocating for secularism. Mohamed lived with an Italian nurse who was not that snub bourgeoisie. On the contrary, she warmly welcomed him and had a great part in his metamorphosis, filling the emotional void of the young boy. Likewise, Mohamed was a great lover of theater and former director of the drama troupe Ech-Chahama, who had stopped its activities because of the war. Between 1909 and 1913, it performed famous plays such as Hamlet, Mejnoun Leila... Since it reprised its activities, Bourguiba rehearsed with his brother and participated in plays that gave him insurance. Unfortunately, the rehearsed play was prohibited by authorities because it recalled the situation of Netherlands people under Spanish colonization. However, Bourguiba enjoyed his brother's sympathy toward the Kef inhabitants: He learned to play cards, discussed military strategy, got interested in Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk then visited his other brother Ahmed in Thala with whom he learned horseriding. Bourguiba family in the beginnings of the 1920s. Bourguiba was satisfied with his journey to Kef: \\"My journey in Kef cured my health. But it was too late for my physical development. My height did not grow from 1 m 65, which meant 5 centimeters less from normal. Because in my teenage years, I lacked vitamins now available to young people and granted to them free of charge in hospitals and by national organizations\\", he stated years later. While he was in Kef, the Destour party was founded aiming independence. Since then, Bourguiba showed interest in activism and declared to one of his friends in Kef, Othman Kaak: \\"You love literature. I, myself, like it, I even love it. But I have other goals. I want to enroll in law school to fight against France\\". His goals were, however, thwarted by his non- studious educations, unlike his old mates of Sadiki, who became bureaucrats in the colonial administration. Therefore, a family meeting took place to talk about the boy's future: None of his sisters-in-law was ready to finance his studies. As for his brothers, they considered him unsuccessful and considered to find him a job as a farmer or grocer's apprentice. Only his brother Mahmoud, who was a thirty years old single and worker at the ministry of Justice, decided to invest in his brother's education. Thanks to his support and aid, Bourguiba enrolled in Lyc√©e Carnot of Tunis. Bourguiba stated in 1973 the reasons his brother supported him: \\"As for \\"si\\" Mahmoud, I had forgotten to tell you that the year I passed my certificat d'√©tudes primaires and lost my mother, he had just left Sadiki where he was an intern. He was in classe de seconde. I lived, myself in Tourbet El Bey. Every Friday and Sunday of every week, he came home to teach me. But he used, during his task, an unpreceeded brutality and savagery. He was in such a furry that he beat me like plaster. I was still not ten and my fear was so intense that I could not even focus or understand tasks that he asked me. Each time, panicked, the cleaning woman rushed to the window and cried for help. I was severely traumatized and I still wonder today how such a scandalous treatment has not finally overcame my intelligence and thirst for knowledge [...] He had indeed redeemed himself\\".  Lyc√©e Carnot years (1922‚Äì24)  Lyc√©e Carnot of Tunis, nowadays the Bourguiba pioneer school. Bourguiba was first admitted in classe de premi√®re thanks to the help of his brother Mahmoud who solicited the headmaster's secretary, Tahar Zouiten. There, Bourguiba found, with great pleasure, his old Sadiki friend, Tahar Sfar, who studied in another classe de premi√®re. Two or three weeks later, he was summoned by Tahar Zouiten who announced the decision to downgrade him to classe de seconde. Bourguiba stated years later: \\"Despite the chagrin caused by this downgrade, I executed the decision. But three months later, I visited Mr. Zouiten to tell him how much I was thankful to his initiative which helped me learn new disciplines I did not master in Sadiki College. I had just discovered Mathematics. I did not learn algebra or geometry in Sadiki where we were spending our mathematics classes laughing and having fun\\". Indeed, Bourguiba developed a great consideration for mathematics because of the attention that dedicated his new teacher, Mr. Perrachon to his students. However, he was never present during French lessons, taught by an old regularly heckled professor: \\"Our timetable scheduled, for Friday afternoon, a history-geography lesson, from 2pm to 3pm and a french lesson from 3pm to 4pm. I was present during the first lesson then left high school at 3pm in order to go to the theatre where an Arab play was held, in Friday afternoon [...] I was very keen on drama. I thought, moreover, that in matters of French, I really did not need to provide additional efforts, being taught by Mr. Colli√®res at Sadiki\\". Indeed, he was ranked first in quarterly exams of French, despite these repeated absences. The reason was mere according to Bourguiba who explained it: \\"Every Friday afternoon, a supervisor came to our history class at 2p.m. He checked the presents and wrote the names of those who were absent. Thus supervisor, who by the way was Tunisian, came back the next hour in french classes. The professor, whose dignity forbade him to suffer a native heckling, hastened to mention the same names written on the notebook and sign. Thus, I had never attended French classes and my absences were regularly unnoticed\\". Nevertheless, during quarterly exams, Bourguiba was ranked first of second in French. In lyc√©e Carnot, Bourguiba strengthened his friendship with Tahar Sfar and became friends with Bahri Guiga. Both of them originated in Testour but despite that, the three of them were called the \\"Sahelian Threesome\\". In Tunis, the maneuvers of Lucien Sait, resident- general, to discard the relations between the bey and the Destour were a total failure. Indeed, he decided to fake an interview destined to French audiences in which Nacer Bey announced being opposed to the movement and that he did not agree with the adoption of a constitution. However, this statement was made public and the bey denied many parts of the interview, denouncing French maneuvers and threatening to abdicate. Therefore, public opinion decided to mobilize in support of this nationalist bey. Likewise, Tunis inhabitants went by foot to the Marsa Palace to express their support, on April 5, 1922. Bourguiba was one of the protesters. In response to the protests, Lucien Saint went to the beylical palace, accompanied by militaries and obliged the ruler not to abdicate. Meanwhile, the newspaper Essawab was suspended and charged for disseminating false information. Bourguiba and Jouahdou, his former mate of sadiki, protested with Tunis inhabitants against these statements and miraculously avoid being expelled from school. During the conference he held years later, in 1973, Bourguiba recalled the points that marked his youth and influenced his thinking: Bourguiba spent his vacations in Mahdia, in his sister Nejia's house. There, he met numerous friends and discussed political and philosophical ideas, being Arab like those of Al-Mutanabbi or French like those of Victor Hugo. At night, they gathered to debate and called their group, the \\"Circle of Mahdia\\". In 1923‚Äì1924, Bourguiba and his three friends were inseparable, Sfar becoming his confident. In his new school, Bourguiba noticed the inequalities between French and Tunisians, not tolerated in certain public spaces and enjoying less rights than the native population. Bourguiba had excellent results during the first part of baccalaureate and ended up choosing Philosophy section, to the grand surprise of his classmates, Bourguiba being the first in mathematics class. Bourguiba stated that he wanted to \\"prepare himself properly for the big battle\\". Likewise, he justified his decision saying: \\"It was for me to approach a new nuanced discipline which was not like mathematics where two plus two always equals four. Philosophy addresses indeed complex issues that opened new horizons in my mind, eager for knowledge. Thus, I would be better equipped to triumph the cause to which I decided to devote my life. So I opted for the philosophy section\\". So he started his new lessons in Professor Picard's class who introduced different philosophical doctrines, \\"letting his students free to choose the opinion that was the closest to their personal ideas\\". He regularly visited libraries, had a great passion for history books but consistently skipped classes in order to attend, every Friday, Habiba Msika's performance of L'Aiglon. In 1923, in the start of his final year, Chedlia Zouiten, daughter of his cousin A√Øchoucha Bourguiba, was promised to him by his father as his future wife. Habib Bourguiba with his classmates in a school picture in 1924 as an undergraduate. Their final year soon coming to an end, the future graduates were aware of the important part there should have in the future of their country. Bourguiba was interested in French politics and support socialism. Obtaining outstanding marks, he had, nevertheless, a tight competition with Augustin Barbe, a French classmate, in order to earn a scholarship for high studies in Paris. Furthermore, he was supported by his brother Mahmoud, who promised to send him 50 francs per month, even though he wanted his brother to pursue his studies in Alger with M'hamed, who had just obtained his baccalaureate. Despite his attempts to dissuade him, Bourguiba stood firm. \\"It was in Paris that I wanted to pursue my studies in order to deeply learn its way of living and ruling but also the secrets of its administrative, political and parliamentary organization\\", he justified years later. In 1924, he sat for his baccalaureate which consisted in three examinations: a two coefficient philosophical one, a natural scientific one and a physical-chemical one, each of them of one coefficient and a half. He obtained sixteen to twenty in philosophy thanks to a \\"formidable dissertation\\", which ranked him first of his class with honors. He recounted that day in those words: \\"At the announcement of the results I felt worried. I wanted first rank, at any coast. Being second did not satisfy me. To my grand relief I happened to be first with honors. The second was Auguste Barbe\\". He stated at the announcement of the results: \\"I will be a lawyer and I shall put an end to the protectorate. Therefore, Bourguiba left the country to pursue his studies in Paris. He then embarked on an old tub, The Oujda , to discover France.  1924‚Äì27: Higher education in Paris   Discovering the colonial empire (1924‚Äì1925)  Following his arrival in Paris, Bourguiba settled in Vauqueur pension who reserved him a sordid welcoming. The pension was nearby H√¥tel Saint-S√©verin, next to Place Saint-Michel, where he used to lodge in a room on the sixth floor for 150 francs per month, with an extra for a heater that did not work. He spent his first months wandering in hotels in Quartier latin and Tunisian student's dormitories. Preferring to attend philosophical classes, Bourguiba sent his notes to his brother M'hamed and excelled in his studies. Interested in Arab culture, he attend William Mar√ßais's lessons beside his psychological and psychotherapy interest in George Dumas's conference, in h√¥pital Saint-Anne. Furthermore, he met, in the hospital, paranoias who thought they were Napoleon or other historical personalities. \\"I felt then that euphoria of knowledge that increases as our research extends\\", he recalled in 1973. \\"However, I ended realising that I did not come to France for that purpose, but rather to arm myself intellectually to combat the French colonization. Therefore, I was determined to put an end to these parallel endless studies that diverted me from my goals\\". He regularly wrote to his family asking them to send some money because he went through hard times but, thanks to the intervention of Hassan Chedli, a Monastirian accountant in Sadiki College, he received a scholarship of 1800 francs, payable in two installments, then enrolled at the Paris law school and started his new classes of psychology and literature in Sorbonne Papa Alioune Ndao, Francophonie of ¬´ fouding fathers ¬ª, √©d. Karthala, Paris, 2008, Portrait of Bourguiba, during his first year in France. The 1924‚Äì25 school year was a hard period of work for Bourguiba. However, he used to be interested in politics and French culture that he was eager to discover in every aspect. He frequently went to Palais Bourbon where he attended debates and sensitized to the intellectual and sentimental spirit of Leon Blum, that he already knew from Le Populaire. He also closely followed the evolution of French politics during the Third Republic. It was while discovering this new knowledge that he developed an interest for politics. Between classes, students went to Jardin du Luxembourg to talk about news and political issues, during the France between two wars. Bourguiba went to read his newspaper and participate in the debates. In that context of post-war, the main topics were Woodrow Wilson's self-determination doctrine and the Russian Revolution of 1917, but also the Congress of Tours that divided the SFIO. Furthermore, 1924 discussions were about Vladimir Lenin's death but also socialism and the rivalry between Joseph Stalin and Leon Trotsky. Bourguiba was following the international news in detail, was opposed to Bolsheviks and got interested in Gandhi's idea of transforming the National Indian Congress into a powerful mass organization. He also thought that H√¥ Chi Minh's participation in Tours Congress and his joining of the Communist International, aiming to get his country independence with the help of the enemies of Imperialism and Capitalism, made him dependent of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR). Bourguiba also admired his Tunisian fellow Mahmoud El Materi, who was active in Paris. He also liked the statue of Auguste Comte, father of Positivism, below which was written: \\"Live for others\\". Bourguiba stated years later that \\"It was the expression of the very purpose of life I wanted to live, the goal I set myself\\". During his fourth conference, he exposed his determinations when he was student in Paris: In summer, Bourguiba returned to Monastir where he also found M'hamed, who came back from Algeria obtaining his law degree. After vacations spent between Mahdia and Monastir, Bourguiba returned to Paris in the opening of 1925‚Äì26 school year, worried about nationalist activism back in the country. Firstly, he moved to the university campus of Boulevard Jourdan where he lodged in a room number 114. \\"We lodged there freely. We benefited from a restaurant. The food was hearty and healthy [...] It was a nice, clean place\\", he described it in 1973. The sponsor Taieb Radhwan, sent him via the association Les Amis de l'√©tudiant, registration fees to Paris Institute of Political Studies, where he started attending public finance classes. He obtained a financial aid from his friend and protector, Mounier-Pillet, his former teacher in Monastir. The same year, his friends Sfar and Guiga joined him to Paris while he was tutoring a Sfaxian student, Mohamed Aloulou, sent by his parents to sit for the baccalaureate exam in Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand.  Law studies and meeting Mathilde Lefras (1925‚Äì1927)  Portrait of Mathilde Lefras One day of 1925, while tiding his room, Bourguiba found the address of a woman his protector recommended to meet: Mathilde Lefras, a 35 years old widow whose husband died during the war. He met her for the first time in her apartment, on the first floor of a building in the 20th arrondissement of Paris. She invited him to enter and asked him to tell his story. Touched by it, she asked to see him once again, and, in the upcoming months, invited him to move in with her. Since then, he gave his room in the campus away and settled with Mathilde. With this new way of life, Bourguiba distanced from the other students, even with the Zouitens, supposed to be his future family-in-law and sightseeing in Paris. It was Habib, the brother of Chadlia Zouiten, who discovered his affair with Mathilde and wrote him a letter: \\"I do not hide that I find this attitude a bit coward [...] you, who was supposed to marry my sister\\". But even in the neighbourhood, their relationship was very frowned and, to end gossips, Bourguiba elaborated a stratagem: He wore his costume and arrived in Mathilde's car, accompanied by Sfar and Guiga to simulate their wedding. All these changes seemed to have distanced him from his way of activism in Tunisia, despite the riots and uprising that started in the country, the resident-general ending up signing a decree to prohibit freedom of expression, but also censoring newspapers. During the summer of 1925, he went back to Monastir but was not interested in his country's political adventures. His father died in September and, a few days later, he received a telegram from Mathilde, announcing that she was pregnant. This situation of responsibility worried Bourguiba who decided, on his return to Paris, to inform one of his friends about the news. This friend proposed that he break up with Mathilde and leave the responsibility of educating the child to her, which Bourguiba refused, stating he was as responsible for that as she was, having the sense of family responsibilities. Furthermore, this pregnancy reassured him because he thought he was sterile, as he possessed only one testicle. But the couple's relationship worsened gradually so that Bourguiba decided to sleep in his friends' rooms at the campus. On April 9, 1927, Mathilde gave birth to a boy they named Jean Habib Bourguiba. After that, the couple moved out to settle in Bagneux, a French suburb, in a room used both as bedroom and dining room. Bourguiba, although sick, had to prepare for his final exams, which he sat a month after the birth of his son. He finally obtained a bachelor's degree in law and the higher degree of political studies from the Paris Institute of Political Studies.  1927‚Äì1930 : Early adult life in Tunis   Difficult professional career debuts  Bourguiba in lawyer robes, after his return to Tunis. In August 1927, a 26 years old Bourguiba returned to Tunisia, not only with a girlfriend and his son Habib Jr. but also a deep knowledge of French politics during the Third Republic. While in France, he had been influenced by liberal values of the social-radical secular country, shared earlier by his brother Mohamed. Following his come back in Tunisia, he married Mathilde, while Mahmoud Laribi was his best man and settled in the Capital City. At the time, he was not interested in politics but in his professional career, every debuting lawyer having to do a three-year traineeship under the supervision of another experienced lawyer. For a whole year, from October 1927 to October 1928, Bourguiba concatenated traineeship: First he was hired by a certain Mr. Cirier, who dismissed him after six weeks. Bourguiba testified in these words: \\"It was hard to understand. I had not yet started my political action. He may sensed risks. He offered to compensate me. But I preferred to leave without further ado. I had to look for another patronage. We were late November. Everything was settled; trainees were all installed. Nothing was offered to me\\". Bourguiba then contacted Hamouda Boussen, whom he met and who used to be known for his many contacts. Thanks to his help, Bourguiba found a traineeship, working for Mr. Pietra and Mr. Scemama, who paid him only after two months. Their law firm was located in rue de l'ancienne poste, between the Street of Maltese and Avenue of France. He then lived in Street of R√©sevoir where he rented an apartment with 300 francs per month. As for Bourguiba, \\"Nothing mattered. What was necessary over all was to be domiciled in a law office holder for the duration of the regulatory internship. However, Bourguiba quickly acquired an annoying renowned for his bosses: \\"It was impossible to continue working with this Bourguiba! This was a man the law firm hired for an internship and there he is, stealing customers!\\". They soon informed him that he had no longer the responsibility of pleadings, henceforth the charge of Mr. Z√©rah. Bourguiba, instead was charged in writing works. By the end of June 1928, he resigned from the lawyer office. After his resignation, he found a job at Salah Farhat's lawyer office. Bourguiba, who only wanted a place where he could work did not ask Farhat, who was at the time deputy chairman of the Destour, for money but for a working place. Nevertheless, he worked all summer at Farhat's and had a salary of 300 francs per month. He soon met a worker at the office of a certain Mr. Sebault. This one engaged Bourguiba for 600 francs per month which led Bourguiba to work another year more than the three mandatory ones.. His family and entourage did not really approve his marriage to a French older woman, when he was promised to his cousin Zouiten. His brother Mahmoud, even though opposed to this union, helped him by inviting his family live with him in his house in Le Kram. Bourguiba settled with his wife and son into his brother's home while this one abandoned his wedding plans. That very year, their sister Nejia Bouzgarou lost her husband who died and joined her brothers temporarily with her four children. Even though he liked being surrounded by his family, Mathilde was not pleased with their situation and urged her husband to move out. So they did, settling in Tunis downtown once again, where they lived till 1933. For that moment, Bourguiba was not interested in politics but rather work, lodging and family. One of his closest friends stated that his main ambition at the time was to \\"settle down\\" and that he acquired a certain maturity and autonomy since he was no more dependent on his brothers.  Political beginnings  In that context of colonial oppression, Bourguiba felt the effects of inequality, mainly after he spent a whole year of unemployment. This inequality chocked him and led him to discuss these matters with both Tunisian and French friends, who agree with the necessity to start a reform process aiming to get Tunisia resemble France, that is, liberal, modern and secular. Picture of Bourguiba wearing his traditional dress, circa 1928, after his return to Tunisia. On January 8, 1929, Bourguiba attended a conference held in the cultural association L'Essor by Habiba Menchari, a young woman who advocated for women's rights. Since he could not come, Bourguiba went instead of his brother M'hamed. Many Destour members, French and Tunisians attended the event. Menchari complained about Muslim women's conditions and then threw her veil down, starting debates. The Muslim attendees denounced this act, according to the law and Islamic learnings then started to debate the length of the jilbab. Therefore, Bourguiba stated: His speech surprised the liberal attendees like Andr√© Duran-Angliviel, his sister Eve Fichet, journalist using the nickname Eve Nohelle, the unionist Joachim Durel and the lawyer Mohamed Noomane. Durel criticized Bourguiba's thinking and wrote in Tunis socialiste that \\"Everything worked well and there he was talking about Tunisian personality. As if there even were a Tunisian personality! But we are dealing with a mix of Arabs, Muslims, Jews, Maltese, French...\\". Bourguiba, in response, was opposed to Durel's thinking as he demonstrated by his articles in L'√âtendard tunisien. The controversy that followed opposed, for nearly a month, Bourguiba and Durel, who was astonished that Bourguiba ended up with a French woman. Bourguiba then wrote that he was there to raise their son as a proper Tunisian, according to their country's culture and education. In 1973, Bourguiba testified on this controversy that had been his political start: Bourguiba had also reacted to the statement of Maurice Viollette, governor- general of Algeria, who proclaimed \\"North Africa is an integral part of France and that it was impossible for France to abandon a bit of it\\". 1930 was the peak of French colonization in North Africa, which led France to celebrate the centenary of the French conquest of Algeria, by organizing a eucharistic congress in Tunisia. On this occasion, millions of Europeans invaded the capital city and went to the Saint-Lucien de Carthage cathedral, disguised in crusaders, which humiliated and revolted the people who protested against what they considered, as a violation of an Islam land by Christendom. The protestors, strongly repressed, were brought to Justice and some of had Bourguiba for lawyer, as he did not participate in the event. He also remained neutral when Tahar Haddad was dismissed of his duties of notary. He estimated at that moment, that the main goals were political, while other problems of society are secondary, insisting on the Tunisian personality and identity that had to affirm, declaring: \\"Let us be what we are before becoming what we will\\".

It refers to vegetation that grows on infertile sandy soil with poor drainage. The term may be used to include open forest, shrubland and meadow, or may be restricted to treeless meadows. Open forest The term campina is related to campinarana. The meaning of both is \\"wild field\\", and some consider that they are the same. The terms campina and campinarana both describe white sand savannas that are very poor in nutrients. They may be flooded periodically or seasonally, in which case the roots suffer from lack of aeration. The vegetation is stunted. Amazon campinas are defined as open forest on sandy soil where sunlight can reach the ground. More than half the species of orchid in the Amazon lowlands are found in this type of forest. The campina areas of the Amazon have a flowering peak in the dry season. Treeless shrubland or meadow For others, campina is distinguished as being completely treeless. The term \\"campinarana\\" is used for the transition between campina and the rainforest. One author distinguishes between a campina shrubland and scrubby campinarana forest, both of which grow on white sand soil typically associated with large stream gullies. In this view the campinarana is a pseudo-campina and, \\"is, in fact, neither a campina nor a true, dense forest...\\". A Brazilian forestry institute defines campina as a type of terrestrial biome consisting of open fields, completely denuded of trees. The meadows may occur in natural conditions, or may be man-made. These areas are low in varieties of species, but have high numbers of endemic species. A description of the Uatum√£ Sustainable Development Reserve states that campinas and campinaranas are abundant but very fragile, mainly due to their sandy soil. They have many endemic species. The campinas have tourist potential due to their scenic beauty and large numbers of bromeliads and orchids. References Sources    Further reading * Guimar√£es, F. S., & Bueno, G. T. (2016).

It was built in 1891 and used until 1954. The school building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011 for having local significance in the theme of education. It was nominated for being a well-preserved example of the one-room schoolhouses once common in rural Traverse County. Description District No. 44 School is a one-story frame building on a concrete block foundation. The central room is about by . Projecting from the front of the building is a vestibule. At the rear is an coal shed, added in 1914. The main room and the vestibule each have a gable roof while the rear section has a simple shed roof. Asphalt shingles cover all three. The school's main section is topped by a small belfry at the front and a concrete block chimney at the rear. The building has wood clapboard siding, painted white. The primary entrance is centered on the vestibule. There are three sash windows on either side wall of the main room and a single narrow window on either flank of the vestibule. As of 2011 the school's interior has been preserved and restored to show its original function. The vestibule contains coathooks and a few shelves for students' lunchboxes, as well as a wash basin. Early-to-mid-20th-century desks, wood benches along the sidewalls, and the original blackboards from 1891 still decorate the classroom. The wood floor and wainscoting are original to the building, while the upper walls and ceiling were modified in the 20th century. At the head of the classroom the teacher's desk is an antique from a different school, acquired in recent years, but behind it is the school's original map cabinet with maps dated 1892. Nearby is a fuel oil stove, which replaced an earlier coal-burning stove. A door in the north wall leads to the coal shed, which also contains a narrow cabinet once used to store art supplies. The rear of the classroom includes a cabinet added in the 1920s to house the school's library. A ceiling hatch nearby leads to an attic space, which includes a rope bell pull for the belfry. Neither of the original two outhouses has survived, and the outhouse presently standing to the east of the school is a more recent structure not considered a contributing property to the National Register listing. Establishment Little specific information survives regarding the initial establishment of District No. 44 School. The number 44 had been used previously for a Traverse County school district, but it is unclear if it was located in Taylor Township or elsewhere before closing sometime prior to 1888. In 1891, however, an act of legislature reassigned the number to a new school to be built in Section 8 of Taylor Township. At that time the township had a population of 263 people. The building materials were delivered to the site but, for lack of available carpenters, hadn't been assembled as of mid- November that year. The little school was definitely complete and operating by April 1892, though, when the county's school superintendent wrote about how well it was progressing. The schoolhouse was built on a standard design distinguished by its gable-roofed vestibule. Two other school buildings in Traverse County and at least five more elsewhere in Minnesota use a nearly identical plan. Use Like typical one-room schools, District No. 44 contained grades one through eight taught by a single teacher. District No. 44's inaugural school year of 1891‚Äì92 began with 18 students and a veteran teacher named Mr. Sansburn. Though the area's rural schools could range from as few as five to as many as 40 students, a student body numbering in the teens or twenties was most common. They would usually range from eight to 16 years old, but could be allowed as young as five and as old as 21. Typical practises at the school involved a longer recess for first graders while the older students tackled advanced subjects like algebra and Shakespeare. Group singing was also common. Students who misbehaved were made to stay after school and clean the blackboards. A former student recalled having to memorize The Song of Hiawatha, drowning gophers in their burrows during recess, and dreading using the outhouse in winter. There was no well on the school grounds, so students took turns bringing water each day. The school had a very small library and the arrival of even a few new titles was cause for great excitement. Every Friday, the last period of the day was devoted to industrial arts, and many of the students' woodworking, fabric projects, and posters were entered into competition at the county fair. District No. 44 School also served as a community venue, hosting such events as school plays, picnics, and political meetings. Later history In the mid-1940s the building was moved about to the east‚Äîand rotated from its original orientation‚Äîto accommodate the widening of what is now U.S. Route 75. During this process the building was placed on railroad ties until a new foundation could be built in spring. Students that year recalled holding their feet up as much as possible because the floor was so cold. However the days of one-room schoolhouses scattered across rural America were drawing to a close. Education officials and politicians were pushing for consolidation into fewer, larger schools. They argued that small rural schools were inefficient and substandard, though their actual attendees rarely considered them lacking. Minnesota had been gradually pushing for school consolidation throughout the early 20th century. In 1911 there were about 7,900 school districts in the state, of which 2,000 had fewer than 21 students. That number had only dropped to 7,600 by 1947, but in Traverse County, for example, 18 of its 60 school districts had already closed their schools and were busing the students to other districts. Although Taylor Township's population remained steady, District No. 44 was closed in 1954. Its last teacher was Marieta Maudal. The following year the township purchased the building for use as a meeting hall. It was still being used as a meeting hall at the time of the building's National Register nomination in 2011. Moreover, volunteers had recently rehabilitated the deteriorating structure. Each year many local students take field trips to the schoolhouse for a glimpse of how education used to be delivered.

It is located about south of Discovery Reef in the Paracel Islands. Blue holes generate a distinctive blue colour when seen from above. They are characteristically only dozens of metres deep. The local fishermen call it the \\"eye\\" of the South China Sea, and believe it is where the Monkey King, depicted in the novel Journey to the West, found his golden cudgel. Dragon Hole is almost deeper than Dean's Blue Hole in the Bahamas. There are several fresh water sinkholes on land that are deeper than Dragon Hole. These include Mexico's Zacat√≥n (), Pozzo del Merro in Italy () and Hranice abyss in the Czech Republic (). The Sansha Yongle Blue hole was created around the same time that the surrounding South China Sea islands were created. Blue holes can be formed in a number of ways. The most common is melting ice structures in the surface resulting in large pits where ice once was. Some cases of blue holes are also formed after a disruption in the surface of the ocean floor by tectonic shifts that result in the settlement of sand and debris (Emery, 1962).  Discovery  The exact location of the Dragon Hole is N16¬∞31.55‚Äô. E111¬∞46.1‚Äô. Geographically the hole is found in the eastern Atoll near the Paracel Islands, in the South China Sea. According to the Xinhua News agency, upon discovery by local fishermen, the first research methods included utilizing a Video Ray Pro 4 underwater robot. This robot found the depth of the hole to be 987 ft, and in some places 426 ft wide. Over 20 new species of sea life were discovered during the initial exploration efforts. Other information that was gained from initial exploration was the distinct difference in chemical makeup between water columns. At the 300 ft mark the levels of oxygen fall off making life more difficult to survive. This information leads to speculation on what can be learned from researching the Dragon Hole.  Research  Due to the surrounding geological challenges, new research methods were created in order to study the hole. The surrounding coral is only at an average depth of 0.5-0.8 m, therefore discouraging any large research vessels from accessing the opening of the Dragon Hole. One new method was the utilization of a boat that had a flat bottom that allowed it to rest above the entrance to the hole despite the shallow waters surrounding it. This vessel is used as a staging platform for gathering data, as well as deploying the Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV). Due to the utilization of a ‚Äúunderwater integrated navigation system‚Äù the ROV was capable of receiving real-time commands allowing for control over movement and observation. The device carrier or flat bottom vessel served as an important tool to transport sampling and research equipment on site without damage of the surrounding reefs and environment. The total size of this research vessel was 25x18 m. The ROV or device was a total size of 3.0x1.7x1.7 m. What was specifically used was a ‚ÄúFCV2000D professional grade ROV‚Äù. Blue holes are very valuable to scientists regarding the research of climate change, marine ecology as well as geochemistry and diversification between water columns. Throughout the research conducted on the Dragon Hole, a multitude of data was collected.  Tidal measurements  Tide gauge stations were temporarily deployed around the Dragon Hole as well as on the research vessel. This measurement technique resulted in an accuracy within 3 cm.  Surveying  The utilization of the ROV allowed for three-dimensional topography of the entire blue hole. The ROV, equipped with a multibeam device, made scans of the entirety of the underwater system. Combining this with digital scans of the surface of the hole, a three-dimensional model has been created.  Hydrochemical properties  The Sansha Yongle Blue hole, being the deepest of its kind, allows for the largest data collection surface available for this specific research. Through gathered data, it became evident to researchers that two thermoclines were distinguishable within the water column. The first transition between warmer mixed water and colder stagnant water occurs between 13 and 20 m. The second thermocline occurs lower in the water column at around 70‚Äì150 m. Sampling of water from different depths and layers allows for the gathering of information about rock sediment, minerals, bacteria, organisms, and chemical research. The study of this information can be used to discover critical data about the history of the world dating back to when the Dragon Hole was formed  References  Sinkholes of Asia Paracel Islands South China Sea Sea caves ","title":"Dragon Hole"}]`),P={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:T},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:I}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},E={class:"card-container"};function M(s,e,o,c,u,t){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),n(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your ETHü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",E,[(i(!0),n(h,null,b(t.visiblePoems,(r,f)=>(i(),y(m,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),t.hasMorePoems?(i(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>t.loadMore&&t.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):w("",!0)])],64)}const R=d(P,[["render",M]]),x=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/47.md","filePath":"guide/47.md"}'),L={name:"guide/47.md"},D=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,o)=>(i(),n("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{x as __pageData,D as default};
