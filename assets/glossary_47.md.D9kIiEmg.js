History=Part of first Colonial settlement in Maryland= St. Inigoes is part of the site of the first colonial settlement in Maryland (along with neighboring St. Mary's City) and is where the Jesuit priests who came with the first Maryland settlers created their first farm and mission. They brought with them 20 indentured servants and soon established a tobacco plantation in St. Inigoes in order to fund the mission. Archaeological excavation of Priest's Point in St. Inigoes in the 1980s included investigation of the ruins of St. Inigoes manor house, demolished after an 1872 fire. Artifacts discovered among the rubble of the house include trash connected to the missionaries living there. =Governor Leonard Calvert's lost grave= Archeologists based in the neighboring Historic St. Mary's City research complex believe that the leader of Maryland's first colony, who also became its first colonial governor, is buried somewhere in St. Inigoes. The most likely spot has been narrowed down to somewhere on Webster Field, now a small U.S. Naval Aircraft facility located on the water on the Western side of St. Inigoes. Several archeological digs have been conducted but the grave has yet to be discovered. Members of the Calvert family in the settlement were known to be buried in lead coffins. It is not known if this is how Leonard Calvert was buried. His death, due to disease, happened suddenly and unexpectedly after a period of religious warfare had wracked the colony. Soon after his death, one of the first laws requiring religious tolerance was written and enacted in the colony, further codifying its original proprietarial mandate of religious tolerance and reestablishing peace. =Oldest North American Catholic parish= St. Ignatius Roman Catholic Church in St. Inigoes is the oldest continuously operating U.S. Catholic parish in English speaking North America.\\"Religious Freedom Byway Would Recognize Maryland's Historic Role\\", Megan Greenwell, Washington Post, Thursday, August 21, 2008 https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2008/08/15/AR2008081504104.html\\"\\".

In 1637, the Calverts gave the Jesuits the St. Inigoes plantation, which comprised 2,000 mainland acres and a thousand acres on St. George's Island in the St. Mary's River. St. Inigoes was, along with nearby St. Mary's City, one of the earliest places in America to legislate religious tolerance,Cecilius Calvert, \\"Instructions to the Colonists by Lord Baltimore, (1633)\\" in Clayton Coleman Hall, ed., Narratives of Early Maryland, 1633-1684 (NY: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1910), 11-23.\\"Reconstructing the Brick Chapel of 1667\\" Page 1, See section entitled \\"The Birthplace of Religious Freedom\\" beginning with the earliest mandates for the colony set by the first Lord Baltimore and his sons. In December 1784, Father James Walton ordered the enslaved people residing at the St. Inigoes Jesuit-owned plantation to begin building a new church after the destruction and chaos caused from the American Revolutionary War. In 1785, Father John Carroll laid the building's cornerstone. Francis Neale, a future president of Georgetown College (later Georgetown University), presided at the church's dedication. This church is now a designated historic site that includes a graveyard dating to 1641.\\"Coast Guard Station St. Inigoes: Area Information\\". United States Coast Guard. Retrieved March 20, 2014. The parish also includes part of one of the nation's oldest known African American Catholic communities, which has an even larger presence in neighboring Ridge. Colonial Relics of the original Ark and Dove settlers ships The church contains relics from the original Ark and Dove sailing ships which bore the first settlers to the Maryland colony. =Ruins of Fort St. Inigoes (colonial fort that guarded river access to the colony)= A spot in Western St. Inigoes was the site of St. Inigoes Fort, overlooking the St. Marys River. This was during the era of colonial St. Marys City. It was a strategic protection spot for defending water access to the city, which was under threat from anti-Catholic militias from later Maryland settlements and also Virginia colony militias, as the Virginia colony proprietors were opposed to the Maryland colony. The erosion-prone quality of the shoreline caused the fort to be undermined by waves and the area collapsed into the St. Marys River before the 1800s. Cannons from Fort St. Inigoes The site is now under water, and just offshore from modern day St. Inigoes, but a few cannons were recovered in the 1820s. One of these cannons is now on display on the grounds of Historic St. Marys City immediately next to the campus of St. Mary's College of Maryland, near the brick reconstructed statehouse. It has been treated and heavily painted to prevent further corrosion. The area is open to the public and the cannon can be viewed at any time. =War of 1812: Secret pony express and British raiders= St. Mary's County was one of the hot spots of the war, and British troops were known for terrorizing local residents. Although heavily outgunned, the citizens of St. Mary's County nevertheless put up a determined resistance for 18 months. During 1813, a secret pony express was run through St. Inigoes from a clandestine American intelligence force in Point Lookout. The service operated for months, its messengers riding relay and evading British troops all the way to Washington, D.C., to give intelligence on British naval movements in the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac and Patuxent rivers. Operations ceased when the British finally seized Point Lookout later that year.\\"Raiders and Invaders: The War of 1812 in St. Mary's County\\". St. Mary's County Division of Tourism.

A raiding party from Saracen landed at St. Inigoes and proceeded to plunder the Jesuit mission and plantation, known as St. Inigoes Manor, including St. Ignatius Church, which was a part of the manor at the time. When the raiding party returned, Commander Alexander Dixie, captain of Saracen sent one of his lieutenants under a flag of truce to return what had been taken and to convey a letter of apology to the priests and residents of the settlement there.Force, William Quereau (1836) Army and Navy Chronicle, and Scientific Repository. (Washington City: B. Homans). Vol. 2 (1 January to 30 June 1836), p.2. =Former plantations= Notice St. Inigoes in the upper right. Map of Maryland Jesuit Plantations, from the 17th-19th centuries. A few former pre‚ÄìCivil War plantations are also located in St. Inigoes; some still have ruins of former slave quarters. One slave plantation, \\"The Villa\\", was operated by a local order of Jesuits. In the 18th century, visitors to these Maryland plantations‚Äîincluding St. Inigoes and nearby Newtown plantation, also in St. Mary's Country‚Äîdocumented the Catholic clergy's dependence on slavery in order to subsist, and the violence that routinely occurred on the plantations. One visitor, Irish priest Patrick Smyth, published a treatise that accused the Maryland Catholic clergy of abusing the enslaved people, providing ample evidence and first-hand testimony from the enslaved people. For example, Granny Sucky was a ninety-six-year-old enslaved woman at the time of her interview, who shared that Father John Bolton of St. Inigoes beat her when she was a child (in the mid-18th century) for interrupting his self-flagellation. In addition to violence, child mortality was also high at St. Inigoes and other Jesuit plantations. Most of these historic sites are not publicly accessible, and all but one are on private land. There are no public facilities for displaying or interpreting this part of local history. Another former plantation, also on private land, Cross Manor, was listed as a historic landmark with the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. =Naval facility= St. Inigoes is home to Webster Field, a small naval annex and secondary naval airfield, which is used for the development of electronic avionics. Webster Field is attached to Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Lexington Park.\\"Naval Air Station (NAS) Patuxent River Webster Field Annex (WFA)\\". Maryland Federal Facilities Profile.

United States Coast Guard. Retrieved March 20, 2014. =USS Tulip monument= St. Inigoes is also home to the USS Tulip monument, located a short walk from near the end of Cross Manor Road. USS Tulip was a Union gunship that exploded off the shore of St. Inigoes in 1864 as a result of a boiler accident. Forty-nine sailors were killed, and there were only eight survivors. The monument is listed as the smallest U.S. federal cemetery. The Tulip was originally commissioned as a Chinese naval vessel but was acquired by the U.S. Navy in 1863 for use in the Potomac flotilla during the Civil War. =St. Inigoes Landing Park= There is a small public park and recreational-boat landing managed by the St. Mary's County Recreation Division on Beachville Road. It has a small facility for picnics and barbecues. Fishing and crabbing are also allowed in designated areas. No overnight camping is allowed. =Commercial fishing= There are some boat landings and docks on various coves and creeks in St. Inigoes, which support a now-dwindling population of traditional St. Mary's County \\"watermen\\" (oyster and crab fisherman). Beginning in the 1990s, the ongoing near-collapse of the Chesapeake Bay crab and oyster fisheries have devastated this community.\\"Commercial Fishers: Chesapeake Oysters\\". On the Water.

These include people of English, Irish and African-American descent (in that order of relative population size). Some tracts of farmland are on parcels of larger, former slave plantations and still produce tobacco, corn and soy crops yearly.\\"Southern Maryland Farming\\".

Retrieved March 20, 2014. =Local accent= St. Inigoes is one of the few remaining places in St. Mary's County where older families retain hints of the speech of the area's original English and Irish colonial settlers. Although not as strong as the better-known Smith Island accent still found across the Chesapeake Bay from St. Mary's County, the St. Inigoes accent bears many similarities with the accents of Smith Island and other relic bay communities. The local speech also features some fragments of dialect and sayings unique to St. Mary's county. The less-well-documented local African-American accent and dialect also appears to bear some locally unique forms. These accents are in the process of dying out with the decline of the fishing community, the conversion of farmland to residential development and the influx of new residents. =Development= The growth of the St. Mary's County population has brought change to St. Inigoes, and the number of tiny residential developments have grown since the late 1980s, especially along waterfront and cove areas. Many of these include private docks and pleasure-boat moorings. Residents include many current and retired Navy-associated families, St. Mary's College faculty and staff families and students; long-distance Washington, D.C. commuters, and other retirees. There is also a small community of traditional St. Mary's County watermen (fishermen and crabbers) and their families that remains interspersed throughout parts of the newer development. =Rob of the Bowl= A novel Rob of the Bowl: A Legend of St. Inigoe's, by John Pendleton Kennedy, was published in 1838. Set in 17th-century St. Inigoes and neighboring St. Mary's City, The book is a work of historical fiction that also, in some aspects, is very close to the real history of the original Maryland Colony, as it does describe certain historical events that did occur in St. Inigoes and also in St. Mary's City.

He attended elementary school and two years of high school in his hometown. Due to his interest in military matters, he left high school and entered the military academy in Belgrade. He completed Military Academy in 1900, when he was promoted to second lieutenant of artillery. He completed the Higher School of Military Academy in 1905. During the Balkan Wars (1912‚Äì13) and during the First World War (1914‚Äì18), he proved to be an excellent officer, and was promoted in 1913, and again in 1915, to lieutenant colonel.

But even in Thessalonica front, Simoviƒá was interested in the air force and air defense. Every day, he became more and more interested in the works of flight pioneer Mihailo Petroviƒá, reading Petroviƒá's reports in the Balkan Wars, as well as his studies on aviation. So he decided to dedicate his life to aviation. In 1918, he was named to the delegates of the Serbian government and the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the National Council of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs in Zagreb. Up to the onset of World War II he devoted himself exclusively to aviation.

He joined other officers in a coup against the government of Dragi≈°a Cvetkoviƒá. After the coup, Simoviƒá became the new prime minister. He did not have much time to prepare for the coming war.

On 28 October 1941 Simoviƒá sent a message to the commander of the Chetniks, Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá, and urged him to avoid premature actions and avoid reprisals. After the end of World War II and the formation of Tito's second Yugoslavia, he returned to Belgrade from London in June 1945. After the war ended he was a witness against Dra≈æa Mihailoviƒá at the latter's trial, and went on to author a number of books on military issues. He died in Belgrade in 1962.

Unraced at age two, Pitts got the colt through physical problems and in February 2007 she saddled the three- year-old for his first win at Gulfstream Park in Florida. Two hours after Curlin's impressive 12¬æ length win, the colt was sold for $3.5 million to a racing partnership who turned him over to trainer, Steve Asmussen. Personal life On September 5, 2008, Helen Pitts married Greg Blasi, whose brother Scott Blasi is Steve Asmussen's assistant trainer.

Development  The P-20 development was started in 1946 when State Federal Order of the Red Banner Research Institute Number 20 (now called All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Radio Engineering or VNIIRT) was given the task of developing stationary and mobile early warning ground control and interception radar for the Soviet Air Force. The stationary radar later became the P-50 but the mobile radar was to become the P-20. The design inspired a number of successors including the P-30, P-35 and P-37 radar. The P-20 was the first Russian radar to use the decimetric wavelength, the first prototype being created in 1947, and a factory test unit in 1949. By 1949 the radar had completed state trials and was accepted into wide service within the Soviet airforce, the designers of the P-20 were awarded the State Prize of the USSR in 1950 in recognition of the achievement.  Description  The P-20 is a semi-mobile radar with equipment mounted on eight Zil-151 trucks, components include the control cabin and power supply equipment as well as a trailer for the antenna and transmitter equipment. The antenna system of the P-20 consists of two open frame truncated parabolic antennae accomplishing both transmission and reception. The radar uses two antenna to determine target altitude by the V-beam system with azimuth scanned mechanically. The upper antenna is tilted to an angle of 45 degrees from horizontal which results in each target appearing twice on the indicator, the distance between the two allows the targets altitude to be approximately estimated by the operator. The P-20 had four indicators to display the information generated from the radar, panoramic, range and altitude as well as a remote indicator. The radar used five separate channels for reception and transmission, using different frequencies to avoid mutual interference between the beams, three beam channels being used by the upper antenna and two for the lower antenna.  Operators  The P-20 was operated by the Soviet Union from 1949 and though the radars have since become obsolete, they were passed down to successor states after the fall of the Soviet Union. The design has been superseded by later designs like the P-37 radar.

Ecology It is semi-terrestrial, returning to the sea to spawn. The species appears to be adversely affected by the presence of raccoons (Procyon lotor), an invasive predator. H. tridens has a salinity requirement which lies between those of two other estuarine crabs in Japan, Helicana japonica and Chiromantes dehaani. Smaller individuals shelter in burrows in reed marshes, apparently in order to avoid cannibalism; this may also be the reason for the migration of larger individuals to brackish water lagoons in summer, when the crabs exceed their carrying capacity. Taxonomy Helice tridens was first described by Wilhem de Haan in an 1835 volume of Fauna Japonica, as Ocypode tridens. The former subspecies H. t. wuana and H. t. sheni are now recognised as a separate species, Helicana wuana.

scallop-like bivalve molluscs that lived from the Capitanian stage of the Late Permian to the Anisian stage of the Middle Triassic, 266-237 million years ago. Fossils have been found worldwide in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. These are common fossils subsequent to the Permian-Triassic boundary, suggesting that the genus experienced rapid diversification during and after the Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, around 251.4 million years ago. Ecology Claraia may have been an opportunistic genus that filled the niche of many benthic invertebrates such as brachiopods that were heavily impacted by the extinction. A narrowing of the byssal notch and a trend towards a smoother shell in species of Claraia over time may have led to increased mobility. This increase in mobility may have been an advantage over more sessile animals during the extinction event.Feng, Qinglai; Gu, Songzhu; He, Weihong; Meng, Youyan; Weldon, Elisabeth A.; Wu, Shunbao; & Zhang, Fan (2007) A Late Permian to Early Triassic bivalve fauna from the Dongpan Section, Southern Guangxi, South China.

Professor Case was also a founding partner in the real estate research firm of Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss, Inc., which created the S&P; Case Shiller Index of home prices. He served as a member of the Board of Directors of the Depositors Insurance Fund of Massachusetts.Depositors Insurance Fund 2010 Annual Report, p. 2. He was a member of the Standard and Poor‚Äôs Index Advisory Committee, the Academic Advisory Board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Board of Advisors of the Rappaport Institute for Greater Boston at Harvard University. He served as a member of the Boards of Directors of the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC), Century Bank, The Lincoln Institute of Land Policy, and the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association. He was also an Associate Editor of The Journal of Economic Perspectives and The Journal of Economics Education. Life Case received his B.A. from Miami University in 1968 and spent three years on active duty in the Army including a tour in Vietnam. He received a Ph.D. in Economics from Harvard University in 1977. At Harvard University, he served as Head Tutor (Director of Undergraduate Studies) and won the Allyn Young Teaching Prize. His research was in the areas of real estate, housing, and public finance. He is the author of numerous articles and studies on boom and bust real estate cycles, and is author or co-author of five books including Principles of Economics (1986), Economics and Tax Policy (1986) and Property Taxation: The Need for Reform (1978). Principles of Economics, a basic economics text co-authored with Ray C. Fair and Sharon Oster, first published in 1989, is in its ninth edition and is used at more than 500 colleges and universities. Case‚Äôs research on housing markets and prices began with a New England Economic Review article published in 1986 entitled ‚ÄúThe Market for Single Family Homes in Boston: 1979-1985.‚ÄùKarl E. Case, 1986. \\"The market for single-family homes in the Boston area,\\" New England Economic Review, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, issue May, pages 38-48. In that paper Professor Case constructed a crude ‚Äúrepeat sales‚Äù index to isolate appreciation from mix effects in measuring changes in house values. The model presented in that paper showed that fundamentals explained only a small part of home price movements in the Northeast between 1979 and 1985. The paper conjectured that the region had experienced a home price bubble. In 1985, Case met Yale University economist Robert Shiller, and they started out on a joint venture that would lead to over a dozen coauthored papers and essays. The earliest work by Case and Shiller (Case and Shiller 1987, 1989) included a methodological paper detailing a more refined version of the repeat sales price index and their most cited work, ‚ÄúThe Efficiency of the Market for Single Family Homes‚Äù, which appeared in the American Economic Review in 1989.Karl E. Case and Robert J. Shiller, \\"The Efficiency of the Market for Single Family Homes,\\" The American Economic Review, Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 125-137, (March 1989). The latter paper presented weak form efficiency tests and found strong evidence of inertia in house prices. It also showed that over the cycle, simple decision rules would with near certainty bring excess profits. This was the first empirical paper on housing bubbles. In 1991 they started a firm called Case Shiller Weiss Inc. with Allan Weiss who served as the CEO from inception to the Fiserv sale. They began producing the Case Shiller Index on a regular basis, now a well known and often cited index of house prices. The indexes are available at the ZIP code level in more than 90 Metro areas. Case Shiller Weiss was acquired by Fiserv in 2003,Fiserv Case Shiller Indexes which continues to produce the indexes. The indexes for 20 of the metropolitan areas are licensed to Standard and Poor‚Äôs, which releases the Case-Shiller index on a monthly basis. Following up on earlier research, Case and Shiller published an article in the Journal of the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association (Case and Shiller 1990),Karl E. Case and Robert J. Shiller, \\"Forecasting Prices and Excess Returns in the Housing Market\\", AREUEA Journal (1990), 18(3): 253‚Äì273. which presented strong form tests showing the housing market was forecastable. In 1988, they responded to a booming housing market in California by developing a survey of the expectations and attitudes of homebuyers in four cities: San Francisco, Anaheim (Orange County, CA), Milwaukee, and Boston. The survey showed that home buyers were knowledgeable about current conditions, they saw little or no risk in the housing market, they had very positive price expectations, they thought of housing as an investment, and they indicated they would hold out in a down market. In 2003, Case and Shiller redid the same survey and have repeated it every year since. Case, Shiller and Weiss also wrote a series of articles which proposed the establishment of futures and options markets in real estate (Case, Shiller and Weiss 1993).Karl E. Case, Robert J. Shiller and Allan N. Weiss \\"Index-Based Futures and Options Markets in Real Estate,\\" Journal of Portfolio Management, 19(2) (Winter 1993): 83-91. Case wrote several papers which described the consequences of housing price booms and busts for regional economies and the distribution of income and wealth (Case and Cook 1989;Karl E. Case and Leah Cook, 1989 \\"The Distributional Effects of Housing Price Booms: Winners and Losers in Boston, 1980-89,\\" New England Economic Review, issue May/June, pages 3-12. Case 1990,1991, and 1992). The debate continues about who anticipated the ultimate collapse of the housing market. Case and Shiller were among the first to describe the risks. They were writing about housing bubbles in regional markets in the mid 1980s. The question they were investigating was how do housing price booms unwind? Do they gradually deflate or do they burst? In 1999, Professor Case wrote a paper for the Brookings Panel entitled ‚ÄúReal Estate and the Macroeconomy.‚ÄùBrookings Papers on Economic Activity 2000:2 The topic was suggested by William Brainard of The Brookings Institution who was very worried about the risks posed by a house price bubble. In that paper Case wrote: In more recent years, Case has published papers on the wealth effect of home price increases with Robert Shiller and John Quigley at The University of California in Berkeley.Karl E. Case, John M. Quigley, and Robert J. Shiller, \\"Comparing Wealth Effects: The Stock Market versus the Housing Market.\\" Advances in Macroeconomics, 5(1), 2005: 1-32. Karl E. Case and John M.

It is located along the Assabet River. For many decades it was home to various mills, though it is now primarily residential. According to the Geographic Names Information System (GNIS), Gleasondale is a \\"populated place\\" named after Benjamin W. Gleason and Samuel J. Dale. History Indigenous people lived in what became central Massachusetts for thousands of years prior to European settlement. Indigenous oral histories, archaeological evidence, and European settler documents attest to historic settlements of the Nipmuc people near and along the Assabet River. Nipmuc settlements on the Assabet intersected with the territories of three other related Algonquian-speaking peoples: the Massachusett, Pennacook, and Wampanoag.McAdow 1990: pp. 105‚Äì109 European settlement in what would become Gleasondale began around 1750 when a certain Whitman family and Ebenezer Graves constructed a dam and lumber mill on the Assabet River. The Whitmans‚Äîwho owned the land and mills‚Äîsold them to Timothy Gibson in 1770, who in turn sold them to Abraham Randall a few years later. For many years the area was known as Randall's Mills. In 1813 the Rock Bottom Cotton & Woolen Company built a wood-framed textile mill at Randall's Mills and the emerging village and new post office became known as Rock Bottom.McAdow 1990: p. 72 In 1815 Randall sold the mill to Joel Cranston and Silas Felton, business partners based in Feltonville, a village of Marlborough, Massachusetts, which would later become the town of Hudson. In 1830 Cranston and Felton sold the mill to Benjamin Poor. In 1849 business partners Benjamin W. Gleason and Samuel J. Dale purchased the mill. They built the existing five-story brick mill building in 1854 after the original wooden building burned on May 8, 1852. In 1898 the village was renamed Gleasondale in honor of Gleason and Dale, and the brick mill building became known as Gleasondale Mills. On 31 March 1911 Phineas Feather‚Äîa former superintendent at Gleasondale Mills‚Äîattempted to murder mill owner Alfred Gleason with a pistol after confronting him about money he felt Gleason owed him. Another superintendent, Charles E. Roberts, disarmed Feather but was wounded in the struggle. A certain Robert J. Bevis and other individuals intervened further; Bevis and Feather were also wounded. No one died from their injuries, and after a stint at Bridgewater State Hospital Feather was released in 1915. Until its closure in 1965, the Gleasondale Station‚Äîone of two train stations in Hudson‚Äîserved the village. It was originally operated by the Central Massachusetts Railroad Company, and later by Boston & Maine. The station's name is printed as \\"Rocky- bottom\\" in an 1888 map of the Central Massachusetts Railroad. Today Gleasondale has a few residential buildings, plus a small industrial complex in the old mill buildings. It does not have a large enough population to support a post office, and uses the same zip code as Stow, 01775. The dam remains, even though it no longer provides hydropower.

It was a member of the Atlas family of rockets, and was used to launch seven communication satellites during the mid to late 1980s. Atlas G consisted of an improved Atlas core with modernized avionics and stretched propellant tanks. The Centaur stage also had several updated components and other technical improvements. It was replaced by the Atlas I, which had an improved guidance system. The maiden voyage of Atlas G was the launch of Intelsat 5 on June 9, 1984. Atlas performance was normal as was Centaur orbital injection, but during the coasting phase prior to the second Centaur burn, the stage's LOX tank split open. The Centaur and Intelsat tumbled end- over-end and were left in a useless orbit where they remained until reentering the atmosphere four months later. Investigation into the failure found that a minor fatigue crack developed in the Centaur LOX tank during staging and orbital injection, which eventually led to complete tank failure and loss of the mission. The uprated Centaur flown on Atlas G, among other changes, deleted the propellant boost pumps in the interest of greater simplicity and weight-saving. To compensate for this, LOX tank pressure was increased 25%. Although the tank had been designed to accommodate higher pressure, technicians at Convair inexplicably failed to test Centaur 5402 for leaks before shipping it to Cape Canaveral. In addition, engineers had not tested the Centaur G stages to verify if they could handle the shock from the explosive bolts on the booster firing during staging, but this test was performed later and the stage passed it. Finally, the leak testing program and tools used at Convair were outdated and less reliable than newer methods and the tech personnel in charge of fabricating the Centaur's balloon tanks were badly inexperienced. Ultimately, this was a symptom of the entire US space program in the 1980s as plans to entirely replace expendable launch vehicles with the Space Shuttle had resulted in large-scale budget cutbacks and layoffs of experienced technicians. Six more Atlas G/Centaur launches took place through 1989. These were: *Intelsat 5A F-10, March 22, 1985 *Intelsat 5A F-11, June 30, 1985 *Intelsat 5A F-12, September 28, 1985 *FLTSATCOM 7, December 5, 1986 *FLTSATCOM 6, March 26, 1987 (launch failed after the booster was struck by lightning) *FLTSATCOM 8, September 25, 1989 The first stage was derived from the SM-65 Atlas missile, and a Centaur was used as the second stage.Encyclopedia Astronautica - Atlas The first stage was also flown without the Centaur, as the Atlas H.

His precise motives for doing so remain unclear; unlike William Laud, he was not an Arminian, and many contemporaries believed he did so for preferment. He became bishop of St Davids in 1636; in 1641, the Long Parliament issued a warrant for his arrest, and he fled to Ireland. He returned to England in July 1642, shortly before the First English Civil War began, and retired to Brecon in Wales, where he died in June 1653. Biography Roger Maynwaring was born in Church Stretton, Shropshire; his father Thomas (1544-?) was the younger son of Sir Randall Maynwaring of Carincham, in Cheshire. He apparently married twice; there are no details of his first wife, but his will mentions three adult daughters, a son, and his second wife Jane. Career Educated at King's School, Worcester, Maynwaring attended All Souls College, Oxford in 1604, graduating in 1611. He was installed as curate at St Katharine Cree in London, then rector of St Giles in the Fields in 1616. The 1620s were a continuous period of conflict between the monarchy and Parliament; in June 1626, Charles I dissolved Parliament when it refused to fund the Spanish war, and imposed \\"forced loans\\". Those who refused to pay were held without trial; when Chief Justice, Sir Randolph Crewe ruled it illegal, he was dismissed, and over 70 individuals jailed. Appointed a royal chaplain in 1625, Maynwaring delivered two sermons before Charles in July 1627, which expanded the principles of divine right beyond those stated by James I. James himself acknowledged an obligation to consider the welfare of his subjects, but Maynwaring claimed those of a king were worth 'millions of subjects', whose only duty was to obey. Parliament's role was to comply with royal commands, whether raising taxes, or forced loans; refusal meant they risked damnation. William Laud; Maynwaring's sermon was part of a campaign co-ordinated by Laud, stressing the obedience owed by subjects to their king Robert Sibthorpe, Isaac Bargrave and Matthew Wren also delivered sermons on the same lines, as part of a campaign co-ordinated by William Laud (then Bishop of Bath and Wells), which attempted to harness the Church of England to provide moral support for a fiscal policy. In addition, they were royal chaplains, preaching before Charles and the court, and thus prepared for a specific audience. Where it became controversial was taking a general belief in divine right, and giving it specific application, in this case to taxes. Given the political context, this was inflammatory in itself, but Maynwaring adopted a position even more radical than that of his colleagues. It is difficult to overstate the fury among Calvinists like John Pym at his claim those who disobeyed the king risked eternal damnation. The suggestion 'kings were gods' was also regarded as blasphemy. Even Laud advised against publishing the sermon, on the grounds there were many things therein which will be very distasteful to the people. When Charles insisted, Maynwaring's superior, George Montaigne, Bishop of London, took the precaution of putting 'At the Royal Command' on the front page. Charles wanted to have Sibthorpe's sermons printed, but George Abbot, the Archbishop of Canterbury, successfully resisted. In the 17th century, religion and politics were considered interdependent; 'good government' required 'true religion', and alterations in one, implied alterations in the other. Maynwaring was using theology to support policies most considered illegal, including Sir Edward Coke, a former Chief Justice, and most respected lawyer of the age. The 1628 Parliament that assembled in March established a religious committee, which included Pym, Francis Rous, and John Hampden. After they began a review of contentious preachers, Maynwaring further inflamed the situation by delivering the same message at St Giles on 4 June. Although many, including the Bishop of Lincoln, felt ambition was the main driver, the Committee took time to refute his arguments. Impeached by Parliament for treason and blasphemy, he was imprisoned, fined, and suspended as a minister on 24 June. However, on 6 July he was pardoned by Charles, who gave him another parish, Stanford Rivers; thereafter he gained a series of promotions, becoming Dean of Worcester in 1634, then bishop of St Davids in 1636. When Charles was forced to recall Parliament in 1640, his case was raised again by Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex. The Worcester city council objected to various 'Popish innovations' made during his time there, which were added to the original charges. A warrant for his arrest was issued in August, but he had fled to Ireland; on his return in June 1642, he was recognised and taken before the magistrates in Minehead. After a brief period of imprisonment, he retired to Brecon, an area that remained solidly Royalist until the end of the First English Civil War in 1646. He seems to have been left in peace under the Commonwealth; he died in Brecon on 29 June 1653.

The planks were made to look like cut stone by cutting incisions at regular intervals, then painting the siding with a mixture of paint and sand. This technique was rarely practiced in Minnesota architecture, and there are few surviving buildings with this treatment. The house was originally located at 2402 4th Avenue South and was built for grocer Elisha Morse, Jr. and his family as a country home. It was moved to its present location in 1991.

The Lambardar and safedposh assist the Zaildar in his functioning , Zaildar in turn assisted the Deputy Commissioner. The Zaildar was more influential than the Lambardar (village head) because a Zail included several villages in it.Rajit K.

Mazumder, Permanent Black It also reinforced the already dominant social status of the Zaildar with the official government sanction. The Zaildar exercised tremendous authority among the villagers, many of whom looked to him for patronage and assistance, and he alone possessed the power of threats and blandishment within his Zail. Appointment criteria Zails were established and demarcated by the District collector or (also called Deputy Commissioner) during the land revenue settlement exercise. Settlement officer, with advice from the District collector and by the final approval of the state's Financial Commissioner, appointed a Zaildar to each Zail on either (a) hereditary basis, (b) for one life or (c) a fixed tenure, who were equivalent to the Chaudharis (feudal zamindars) of earlier times and were hand-picked by the higher authorities, who based their decision on issues such as caste or tribe, local influence, extent of landholding, services rendered to the state by him or his family, and personal character and ability.The Indian Army and the Making of Punjab, Rajit K. Mazumder, Permanent BlackOm Prakash Aggarawala, 1936, \\"The Punjab Land Revenue Act: Act XVII of 1887 : with a Commentary\\", Lahore Law Depot, page 155.

A. L. Montgomery Some of the responsibilities of the Zaildar corresponded to the responsibilities that fell under the Deputy Commissioner [such as the revenue collection, mutations, local governance issues, related dispute resolution, etc] and other duties corresponded with the responsibilities that fell under the Settlement officer [such as the revenue settlement, reassessments, preparation of maps, etc]. Some of the notable zaildars were * Hansraj Gurjar Zaildar of 25 villages; his son is Krishnpal Gurjar MoS (2020). * Tirkha Ram Gurjar Zaildar; his son is Chaudhary Narain Singh Gurjar former Dy.CM UP. * Khan Sahib Ghulam Ahmed Khan Zaildar of Village Soita, Jalandhar.

They were semi-hereditary because one of the conditions of the grant was that on the death of an incumbent, his successor should, if possible, be a member of the same family. If, however, there was no fit member of the same family, the grant could be awarded to some deserving Zamindar of the same tribe, who was not already in the enjoyment of such a grant. Abolishment Post Indian independence in 1947, the system of Zails, Zaildars and Safedposh continued to exist till 1962 by CM P.S Kairon on the demand of his minister and MLAs because Police and Tehsil officers give more weight to their opinion so this created a awkward situation of undermining the elected MLAs over hereditary post of Zaildars.

It was a boat train scheduled to connect with passenger steamships to Boston and ran only during the summer months. History This summertime fast luxury train was the premier passenger service on the Dominion Atlantic Railway. It began in 1891 when the \\"missing gap\\" between Digby and Annapolis Royal was completed linking Halifax and Yarmouth by rail for the first time. This created an opportunity for a fast luxury service aimed at American tourists connecting Halifax with passenger steamers at Yarmouth. The name Flying Bluenose combined two earlier trains of the Windsor and Annapolis Railway, the Flying Acadian and the Bluenose. Drumhead herald of the Flying Bluenose The name was taken from an affectionate nickname for Nova Scotians and predated the name of the famous racing schooner Bluenose by many years. The Dominion Atlantic purchased the first Pullman parlour cars in all of Canada, the \\"Haligonian\\" and \\"Mayflower\\" for the run. After the Canadian Pacific Railway purchased the Dominion Atlantic in 1912, buffet observation cars were added, carrying the Dominion Atlantic's \\"land of Evangeline\\" herald on drumheads. The train successfully tapped a growing tourism market from New England and was an immediate success. It was joined by the New Yorker in the 1920s, a similar fast summer-only train which connected to New York steamships at Yarmouth. Famous in its day, the Flying Bluenose inspired the author Zillah K. Macdonald to write a children's book The Bluenose Express in 1928 personalizing the train's adventures in a style that predated the famous Thomas the Tank Engine characters created by British railway enthusiast Rev. Wilbert Awdry in 1942. A steep decline in travel during the Great Depression eroded the market for the Flying Bluenose and it was cancelled about 1936. Equipment and services were transferred to the Dominion Atlantic's daily fast passenger trains which continued many of the traditions of the Flying Bluenose such as open observation cars, fresh Digby scallops and flower arrangements from the Grand Pre memorial gardens. VIA Rail's Evangeline Dayliner maintained the route of the Flying Bluenose until 1989, minus the luxurious elements of the older train. Route The Flying Bluenose crossing a Dominion Atlantic Railway bridge in 1906. The Flying Bluenose ran through Nova Scotia's scenic Annapolis Valley offering many fine views of the Annapolis Basin, Minas Basin and Cape Blomidon. It crossed several large tidal rivers. The train connected to fast passenger steamers at Yarmouth but also the DAR ferries at Digby to Saint John, New Brunswick such as and the ferry at Wolfville. In Halifax, it connected to ocean liners of various lines as well as the transcontinental trains of the Intercolonial Railway of Canada and later Canadian National Railway trains such as the Ocean Limited.

Kim attended Gyeseong Middle School in Daegu before transferring to Kyungshin Middle School in Seoul. After family circumstances forced him to drop out, he devoted himself to reading in place of regular coursework. He read a tremendous number of books, including philosophy, world literature and Eastern classics. In fact, Kim's eldest brother Kim Beom-bu, who was a scholar of Chinese classics and a philosopher, had great influence on his extensive reading and his prospects of becoming a writer of Korean literature. Kim was so poor from his childhood that hunger was almost part of his life. He once wrote that sometimes if there was any liquor remaining in the bowl after his father drank from it, he would gulp down even that leftover liquor to relieve his hunger.Dong-Ni Mok-Wol Literary Museum, KiWoong Jang, 2009_11_18Ïùº. http://www.worldyannews.com/news/quickViewArticleView.html?idxno=913 In 1928, he dropped out of school in order to devote himself to writing. He started his literary career by publishing poems in various newspapers at the age of 16. He made a name for himself in the Korean literary world with his short stories. Over the years he received numerous literary awards. Kim Dongri debuted as a poet in 1934 with the publication of the poem \\"White Heron\\" (Baengno) in the Chosun Ilbo and emerged as a fiction writer the next year when his story \\"A Descendant of Hwarang\\" (Hwarangui huye) was published in the JoongAng Ilbo. He was also active in a number of organizations such as The Association of Young Korean Writers (Hanguk cheongnyeon munhakga hyeophoe), The Korea Academy of Arts (Daehanminguk yesurwon), and the Korean Writers' Association (Hanguk munin hyeophoe). Kim was married to the writer Son So-hui (1917-1987).Naver people search accessed 1/19/2014 http://people.search.naver.com/search.naver?where=nexearch&sm;=tab_ppn&query;=%EA%B9%80%EB%8F%99%EB%A6%AC&os;=102353&ie;=utf8&key;=PeopleService Kim died on 17 June 1995. Work Kim's work deals with traditional and native Korean themes from a 20th-century perspective . As a right-wing writer and advocate of \\"pure literature\\", Kim Dongri produced a series of critical essays opposing ideological literature, including The True Meaning of Pure Literature (Sunsu munhagui jinui, 1946) and The Theory of National Literature (Minjok munhangnon, 1948). Kim Dong-ni's literary world, characterized by a mixture of traditional mysticism and humanist realism, investigated the idea of fate and man's place in the universe through the spiritual world of Korean tradition as it collided with foreign culture. His early works such as \\"The Portrait of Shaman\\" (Munyeodo, 1936), \\"The Post Horse Curse\\" (Yeongma), and \\"The Legend of Yellow Earth\\" (Hwangtogi) draw heavily on elements of traditional myth to explore the relations between shamanism and Confucianism, Christianity and Buddhism, fatalism and naturalism. \\"The Post Horse Curse\\" portrays a man's rebellion against and eventual acceptance of his fate as a wanderer; \\"The Portrait of Shaman,\\" which was later expanded into a full- length novel entitled Eulhwa, depicts a conflict between a shaman mother and a Christian son. In the mother's suicide, the narrative predicts the decline of shamanism and ascendancy of newly imported Christianity. After the Korean War, Kim Tong-ni expanded his thematic concerns to include political clashes and the resultant suffering of people during the Korean War. \\"Hungnam evacuation\\" (Hungnam cheolsu), based on the actual event of the UN forces' retreat from the city of Heungnam during the War, delves into the conflict between democracy and communism. \\"Dance of Existence\\" (Siljonmu) narrates a love story between a North Korean man and a South Korean woman that comes to an abrupt end when the man's wife from North Korea reappears. Apparent in these stories is the author's attempt to universalize elements of Korean tradition and spiritual identity by transposing them onto a contemporary reality. \\"The Cross of Shaphan\\" (Sabanui sipjaga, 1957), a fictional account of a man crucified next to Jesus, combines the subject of political strife with fatalistic attitude and critique of Western culture. In lieu of the otherworldly and removed God presented in \\"The Cross of Shaphan,\\" \\"A Life-sized Figure of the Buddha\\" (Deungsinbul) suggests an image of God who embraces human suffering. Some of Kim's short stories were translated into English and plubished in the volume Loess Valley. The short story \\"Loess Valley\\" could be read as a parable for the crippling effect China has had on Korea in which a Chinese general \\"assassinates\\" a local mountain to ensure that no local Hercules can ever threaten China, but mainly it seems to be about two strong, sort of wife- swapping drunken Korean louts. Full of violence, it is an interesting story to read, but not one that leaves much of an impact. In \\"The Tableau of the Shaman Sorceress\\" is a Shaman who lives with her deaf and mute daughter. The daughter is re-united with her son who is now a Christian, and they fight for religious supremacy, with tragic results. Like \\"Loess Valley,\\" it is long on trauma and violence. As in most cases with Kim, it ends in warfare. \\"The Rock\\" and \\"Two Reservists\\" are short, the first another tragic family story (featuring yet again an attempted murder), and the second about how a sense of family (including both love and loathing, but at least the violence is kept down to a mugging) grows between two reservists, both released from the army. The next two, and last stories by Kim, Cry of the Magpies and Deungshi-bul, were later released by KLTI and Jimoondang, and can be found and with reviews, elsewhereLOESS VALLEY And Other Korean Short Stories, Reviewed at KTLIT: http://www.ktlit.com/korean-literature/loess-valley-and-other-korean-short- stories Awards * Freedom Literature Prize (1955) * Korean Academy of Arts Prize (1958) * Citizens' Order of the Republic of Korea (1958) * 3.1 Literature Award, Arts Section Main Prize (1967) * Seoul City Literature Award (1970) * Order of Civil Merit, Peony Medal (1970) * 5.16 People's Literature Award (1983) * Korean Arts Council Selection Shining 20th Century Artist (1999) Works in Translation=Ulhwa= *The Shaman Sorceress - English *ULHWA the Shaman - English *ULHWA, la exorcista - Spanish *Ulhwa, die schamanin - German *‰πôÁÅ´ - Chinese *La Chamane - French =Saban-ui sipjaga= *The Cross of Shaphan - English *La Croix de Schaphan - French =Short Stories= *A Descendant of the Hwarang in A Ready-made Life: Early Masters of Modern Korean Fiction *Greedy Youth in Collected Short Stories from Korea Works in Korean (Partial) *A Descendant of the Hwarang (Hwarangui huye) *The Rock (Bawi) *Seondo Mountain (Seondosan) *Seomun Street (Seomun geori) *Portrait of a Shaman (Munyeodo 1936) *Loess Valley (Hwangtogi 1939) *The Cross of Shaphan (Sabanui sipjaga 1955) See also *Korean literature *List of Korean novelists  References External links * The Dong-ri Mog-wol Literary Museum (Korean only) 1913 births 1995 deaths Korean writers ","title":"Kim Tong-ni"},{"id":"21340403","text":"Thomas Vicary Thomas Vicary (c. 1490‚Äî1561) was an early English physician, surgeon and anatomist.

The second USS Lydia (ID-3524) was a United States Navy cargo ship in commission from 1918 to 1919. Lydia was built as a commercial freighter in 1902 by Wigham Richardson and Company at Newcastle upon Tyne, England, in the United Kingdom. Prior to World War I, the Royal Hungarian Sea Navigation Company of Austria-Hungary operated her as SS Szell Kalman. On 1 Jun 1917 she was seized by Brazilian authorities while laid up at Pernambuco. By 1918 she had come under the control of the United States Shipping Board, from which the U.S. Navy acquired her on 23 October 1918 for use in World War I. The Navy assigned her Identification Number (Id. No.) 3524 and commissioned her as USS Lydia on 26 October 1918 at Baltimore, Maryland, with Lieutenant Commander Frederick W. Taylor, USNRF, in command.. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Lydia departed Baltimore on 7 November 1918 -- four days before the war ended with the Armistice with Germany of 11 November 1918 -- bound for Norfolk, Virginia, where she joined a convoy bound for Europe on 15 November 1918. Loaded with aviation steel and general supplies, she arrived at Nantes, France, during the first week in December 1918. She departed Nantes on 14 December 1918 for Baltimore, where she arrived on 4 January 1919. There she loaded a cargo of food for the United States Food Administration, and departed for the Mediterranean on 7 February 1919. She arrived at Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire on 16 March 1919, exchanged her cargo for water ballast, and departed on 30 March 1919 for the United States. Steaming via Gibraltar, she arrived at Norfolk on 9 May 1919. The Navy decommissioned Lydia on 15 May 1919 and returned her to the United States Shipping Board the same day. She became SS Lydia. In 1925, the Shipping Board sold Lydia to Adria Societ√† Anonima di Navigazione Marittima of Fiume, Italy. Renamed SS Manzoni, she operated out of Fiume until after World War II.

Life  Palacio Postal or Palacio de Correos Mexico City Palacio de Bellas Artes Mexico City Boari was born in Ferrara. He studied at the University of Ferrara and afterwards at the University of Bologna where he graduated in 1886. After he had done several works for the National Exhibition of architecture in Turin. He went to Brazil in 1889 where he works as Project Manager for a Universal Exhibition. After visiting the country and some other cities in different countries of South America like Buenos Aires and Montevideo and after recovering from yellow fever he went to the United States where he lived in Chicago. In 1899 he got permission to work in the United States as an architect. In 1903 he went to Mexico, where under the regime of President Porfirio D√≠az, and for which he is invited, he carries out several projects, among which it highlights: the Cathedral of Matehuala (1898), the Templo Expiatorio del Sant√≠simo Sacramento in Guadalajara (1899) and a monument to Porfirio D√≠az (1900).Justino Fern√°ndez, El arte del siglo XIX en M√©xico. Mexico City: UNAM 1983, plate 307. It is very probable that he designed the Church of San Antonio Lim√≥n in the state of Veracruz. He also designed his house, which was located in the Colonia Roma of Mexico City and was demolished in 1940. In the Mexican capital, he works on projects that give him fame and recognition, such as: the Palacio de Correos de M√©xico and the Palacio de Bellas Artes. It was to this last building that he devoted the most time, working on it even after the Mexican Revolution (1916) had begun. Some of his works he did at the bureau of Frank Lloyd Wright. The Palacio de Correos was finished in 1907. Although Boari began with the construction of the Palacio de Bellas Artes in 1901 he could not finish his work due to the upcoming revolution and resulting technical and financial problems. In 1916, he returned to Italy and settled in Rome, often traveling to Ferrara. It is mentioned that from Rome he sent contributions and ideas for the completion of the Palacio de Bellas Artes, and that he wrote a book on the construction and design of theatres. It is thought that he supported his brother Sesto Boari for the project of the Nuovo teatro di Ferrara (New theatre of Ferrara), which bears a certain resemblance to that of the aforementioned Mexican fine arts palace.Adamo Boari (Italia, 1863-1928) (Spanish), El Poder de la Palabra, Barcelona / New York.

Presented as a documentary found footage film \\"based on real events\\", it is set in the present day and focuses upon an alleged conspiracy behind the Phoenix lights, a mass UFO sighting which occurred in Phoenix, Arizona, and Sonora, Mexico, on Thursday, March 13, 1997. On that date, lights of varying descriptions were reported by thousands of people between 19:30 and 22:30 MST in a space of about 300 miles (480 km) from the Nevada state line, through Phoenix, to the border of Tucson. The film focuses on the main events in and around Phoenix during this time.  Plot  The Phoenix Incident begins with the night vision observation of a scorpion, moving across the screen before cutting to a series of military firefight engagements in Damal, Turkey, Dayr Az Zawr, Syria and Mogadishu, Banadir, Somalia, often with alien cries heard during these engagements. Expository text explains that, since 1997, the United States military has been engaged in a covert war against \\"forces of unknown origin\\", and that \\"57 incidents have spread across Asia, Europe and Russia.\\" It goes on to note that NATO notes that alien invasion forces will reach populated areas within two years, and that the conflict itself is in retaliation for an incident in Phoenix, Arizona on March 13, 1997. The film notes that it is dedicated to \\"members of the intelligence community who provided evidence that made the film possible\\". Tying into the film's viral campaign, the film introduces the disappearance of four Arizona men. Heaven's Gate cult member Walton S. Gayson (Adamthwaite), initially held as a suspect in the murder of the four men, was taken into federal custody. Later, the search for the men was suspended, concluding that the four men had been killed in a bear attack, a conclusion which the local medical examiner denies, but was ordered to list as the cause of death. The documentary style film moves between two complementary plotlines; the first is a filmed interview with an unidentified Air Force pilot who exposes, despite likely repercussions, the truth about what happened to four missing civilian men on the night of the Phoenix Lights. The second plotline comes from recovered filmed footage (\\"The Lauder Tapes\\") by one of four men: Glenn Lauder (Lowenthal), Mitch Adams (Willingham), Ryan Stone (Baker) and Jacob Reynolds (O'Brien). Lauder cannibalizes several different cameras, even duct taping a camcorder to the side of his ATV helmet. It is from these cameras that most of the footage is derived. The interviewed officer details how the military detected the approach of a triangular-shaped object in the tail of the passing Hale-Bopp comet until it began to descend into Earth's atmosphere over Arizona. Later, the object goes missing and two KH satellites in the area had stopped transmitting. The men decide to go out to the foothills by the Estrella Sierra to spend time together and ride their ATVs. Mitch, whose brother was a former US Marine is excited about the trip, his friends substantially less so. While packing their truck for the trip, the men notice a growing military air presence in the area, first helicopters and then F-15 fighter jets and A-10's, as well as odd atmospheric disturbances. When they embark on their trip in Ryan's truck, it suddenly breaks down in the foothills. Jacob tries to repair the damage to the vehicle while the others try to find someplace call for Roadside assistance. They come across a desert compound, protected by an electrified fence, owned by the reclusive Walton S. Gayson. A highly agitated Gayson accosts Jacob at the truck, warning him that they must leave immediately. Despite the warning, the men set off in their ATVs into the foothills anyway. Further questioned, the Air Force officer details how several \\"bogeys\\" had entered Nevada's airspace before turning towards Phoenix. By this time, several eyewitnesses had already seen the multiple crafts, and Operation Snowbird goes into effect: a diversion operation to distract the civilian population with decoy flares while an aerial dogfight ensues between Air Force jets and the unidentified craft at the Barry M. Goldwater Air Force Range. The four men witness the dogfight when an alien craft is disabled and crashes into a nearby hill. Mitch's brother had been killed in a helicopter crash, so he decides to try and render aid to what he presumes is a human pilot. Upon reaching the downed craft, before the military can respond, the men are attacked by defensive creatures that faintly resembles man-sized scorpions; Jacob is severely injured in the attack. Their ATVs are destroyed by the aliens, and they take refuge in Gayson's compound. Gayson has been awaiting the coming of the creatures for years to be abducted and taken to a \\"higher plane\\" of existence, so he turns off the electric fence, letting the creatures in. In the final act, Jacob is abducted, and Mitch is ripped apart in an attempt to defend Ryan and Glenn, who are almost rescued by a military helicopter. After the helicopter is shot down by one of the UFOs, Ryan distracts the creatures before being dragged off by one of them and Glenn runs into a vehicle to hide from them, before making a run for it alone. However, just as it seems he has escaped, one of the aliens attacks him. As his helmet flies off, Glenn is killed out of the view of the camcorder before the creature disappears, and one of the alien spacecraft slowly leaves the area. Gayson later finds the helmet and recovers the camcorder's film. In a post-credits scene, after his release from prison, a clean-shaven Gayson douses himself in gas and sets himself on fire, preparing to 'rise above this world\\". The scene leads viewers into the online viral campaign, revealing how the Lauder Tapes were discovered.

This viral marketing campaign was so effective that the U.S. Department of Justice and Arizona military officials investigated the film makers, and many news media outlets such as The Mirror (a British tabloid), Yahoo News (a US-based news aggregator) and the Business Standard (an Indian English-language daily newspaper) reported the viral marketing campaign as real news events.  Release  The Phoenix Incident was initially theatrically released with Fathom Events on March 10, 2016. An international version of the film was pre-released in the UK on September 7, 2015. The filmmakers partnered with gaming, UFO, and horror sites to promote the film's viral campaign, and released over 4 hours of additional content and story from the film. The film was awarded Best Feature at the Capital Cities Film Festival, Best Feature at the ICE Film Festival, and Vision Award at the Boston SciFi Film Festival. The movie was nominated for Best Horror at the Palm Beach Film Festival, and showcased at the BIFAN International Film Festival in South Korea. The film was featured at the 69th Roswell Festival in New Mexico. The film won Best Narrative Feature and Best Director at the Los Angeles Underground Film Festival. The film makers utilized social media sites and sponsors, including Fathom Events, AMC, Hollywood Today, Regal, Fandango, Celestron, Shazam, and Lootcrate to distribute hidden content and supplemental clips from the motion picture and viral campaign. Director Keith Arem announced that an interactive/investigation version of the film as an iOS app would be released to contain all of the hidden content from the entire campaign. The Phoenix Interactive UFO Investigation App was released on July 2019 at San Diego Comic Con.

All the institutional branches of the Kagyu tradition of Tibetan Buddhism surviving today, including the Drikung Kagyu, the Drukpa Lineage and the Karma Kagyu, are branches of the Dagpo Kagyu. Narrowly, the term Dagpo Kagyu is sometimes used to refer specifically to the lineage of Gampopa's own monastery of Dagla Gampo. This lineage passed from Gampopa to his own nephew Dagpo Gomtsul. Dagpo Tashi Namgyal (1511-1587) was an important lama in this lineage.

Casual situations are the source of a subtle tension and deep, though at first glance hardly noticeable meaning. He said in an interview: \\"I think that real grace and gracefulness appear only where all the gloominess, depression, and weariness of life, all the 'loneliness of the relationship' are somehow present as well.

Biography Guido Marzulli was born in Bari, July 8, 1943. His father ‚Äì Michele Marzulli, who was also a poet and writer ‚Äì and his mother Rosa Tosches were skilled painters.L' Arte nel DNA (DVD Ed. Roma 1994 - Ed. Roma 2006) He began his artistic activity in Bari, where he spent his adolescence and attended various meetings and debates with most important scholars and Italian painters, used to be part of the literary and artistic salon established in his parent home during the 1960s. Also in Bari he finished his university studies and completed a degree in Economics. In 1970, he moved to Rome, where he deepened his research on both landscape and portrait. During the same period, he traveled along Europe, broadening his knowledge to the greatest artists of antiquity and European masters from the nineteenth and beginning of the 20th century. Since 1991, he has lived in Milan and continued painting also in his summer house in Santa Severa (Rome). Marzulli originally set his work along the path traced by the naturalist Neapolitan tradition, he revisits it through the impressionist experience, interpreting it with strength and a 20th-century mark. In the second half of the 1970s he took a strong position against informal and conceptual art (as the Transavantgarde movement did in the late 1970s and 1980').\\"lettera‚Äù January 1978 - Archivio Bioiconografico della Soprintendenza GNAM He rejected abstract art and focused on figurative painting, receiving awards and acknowledgements including the Gold Medal at the Biennale of Rome G.Tortelli in 1990.Dizionario Universale Comanducci - Archivio Comanducci Marzulli knew well the concept of Modern Art, but he chose to keep his work in a more traditional form, representing daily life and the human figure as its main character.Rosario Pinto \\" Fra Tradizione e Innovazione \\" \\"p\\"130 His works have a realistic basis, but also a subjective component which reflects the inner feelings of the painter. He is considered a contemporary representative of figurative realism. Stylistically, Guido Marzulli can be associated with Contemporary Realism. The painstaking quality of the refinement in his paintings mean production is not high, so paintings are found only rarely on the market as a result. Marzulli starts from the belief that the pictorial story doesn‚Äôt need intermediaries to explain the meanings, but must be easy to interpret by common people who should be able to recognize themselves into it, feel direct emotions and find out resemblances of own private memories without any difficulties.lettere - Archivio Bioiconografico della Soprintendenza GNAM He, on the other hand, doesn‚Äôt scatter himself behind symbolism or hidden meanings, and keeps a fine balance between contemporary and an everyday sense of elapsed time, getting inspired by memories and by social reality, interpreting those, sometimes with an indirect nostalgic mind, with a straight and equable language, chromatic evocative personal sense and often adapting the mere visual aspect to his own feeling and, to his own ideal of composite armory. He composed, with a well balanced idealism and realism at the same time, views and characteristic urban glimpses with easy reading expression and with an intimate and realistic background, together with life scenes, open markets, seascapes, intimate domestic interiors with figures and intense portraits, some of these representing his wife, the source of inspiration of many of his works.AskArt - biographies of ArtistsArchivio Bioiconografico della Soprintendenza alla GNAM - Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome Museums His works are conserved at the Museums of Bari (Pinacoteca metropolitana di Bari) and Latina (Galleria Civica d'Arte Moderna e Contemporanea di Latina) and Foggia (Museo Civico e Pinacoteca Comunale di Foggia = Civic Museum and Municipal Gallery of Foggia).Archivio Bioiconografico della Soprintendenza alla Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome The photographic list of many of his paintings and the biographical documentation are in leaflets dedicated to this artist in the Bio-iconographic Archive of the Supervisory Office of the Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna (National Gallery of Modern and Contemporary Art) in Rome (Ministry of cultural assets).Archivio Bioiconografico della Soprintendenza alla Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Moderna in Rome.

Eleven specimens of Dalinghosaurus are held by the IVPP in Beijing. One fossil skeleton contains the skeletons of ten or more juveniles. A possible specimen of Dalinghosaurus has been found in the gut region of a Sinosauropteryx.

Its relatives include the modern Chinese crocodile lizard (Shinisaurus) of southern China, the extinct Exostinus of Montana and Wyoming, and the extinct Carusia of Mongolia.

The area is loosely defined but generally includes the group of falls on the Nedd Fechan, Pyrddin, Hepste and Mellte rivers, all of which lie in the country between the villages of Pontneddfechan and Ystradfellte in the southern part of the Brecon Beacons National Park. All of these falls lie within or on the boundary of the county of Brecknockshire, now part of the unitary authority of Powys. A few miles further west are Henrhyd Falls on the Nant Llech, a tributary of the Tawe and to the south-west are Melin Court Falls on the Melin Court Brook, a tributary of the River Neath. These, along with Aberdulais Falls on the Dulais, a further tributary of the Neath are also encompassed by the term 'Waterfall/s Country' by some writers. Collectively the falls are one of the more popular natural attractions in South Wales, which has caused problems of erosion in the vicinity of many of the falls. Most occupy locations designated as sites of special scientific interest or as special areas of conservation which aim to protect the biodiversity and geodiversity of these sites. The designations place a duty on the landowners and managers to protect the sites and so various erosion control measures have been put in place in an attempt to counter the worst problems. Origins Virtually all of the falls occur on tributaries of the River Neath occupying valleys that have been deeply incised into the landscape. It is suggested that overdeepening of the Vale of Neath by glacier ice during the succession of ice ages has resulted in these tributaries cutting down into their own beds as they adjust to a base level lower than in pre-glacial times. The underlying geology is a generally southerly dipping succession of Carboniferous age sandstones and mudstones assigned by geologists to the Marros Group and formerly referred to as the Millstone Grit Series. Preferential erosion, whereby the less resistant mudstones have been more readily removed by the passage of water, often following various forms of weathering, has left sandstones forming the lips of the falls. The siting of individual falls is closely linked in many cases to the presence of northwest‚Äìsoutheast‚Äìaligned faults that have brought different lithologies into proximity. The Falls=On the Afon Mellte= Sgwd Clun- gwyn (Sgwd Uchaf Clun-gwyn) Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn Sgwd y Pannwr There are three waterfalls of note on this river though several other lesser falls can also be found along its length.http://www.breconbeacons.org/waterfall-country-walking- trails *Sgwd Clun-gwyn - The 'fall of the white meadow' is the uppermost of the three celebrated falls on the Mellte. It is formed where a north-northwest to south-southeast trending fault brings hard sandstone up against softer mudstone. *Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn - The 'lower fall of the white meadow' is the middle of three falls. *Sgwd y Pannwr - The 'fall of the fuller' or 'fall of the woollen washer' is the lowermost of the three celebrated falls on the Mellte. =On the Afon Hepste= Sgwd yr Eira in full flow Sgwd yr Eira - Famous for being the falls behind which you can walk, the 'falls of snow' plunge over a hard band of sandstone whose overhang protects the walker from the full force of the water. The closure of the path behind this most popular of falls during much of 2007 and 2008 on safety grounds was controversial. Stabilisation works agreed between the landowners, the Forestry Commission, the Countryside Council for Wales and the Brecon Beacons National Park Authority allowed the route to be re-opened later in 2008. For a walk taking in Sgwd Clun-gwyn, Sgwd Isaf Clun-gwyn and Sgwd yr Eira see 'Waterfall Walk' under Ystradfellte. =On the Nedd Fechan= There are three falls of particular interest to visitors on this river, though like the Mellte, there are other lesser falls.http://www.breconbeacons.org/waterfall-country-walking- trails *Sgwd Ddwli Uchaf - The 'upper gushing falls'. *Sgwd Ddwli Isaf - The 'lower gushing falls'. *Sgwd y Bedol - The 'horseshoe falls' which are in fact a series of three or four falls in quick succession. =On the Afon Pyrddin= *Sgwd Gwladus - Spelled alternatively as Sgwd Gwladys, the falls are formed where the Afon Pyrddin drops over a lip of the 'Twelve Foot Sandstone'. The native Welsh name was anglicized to Lady's Falls prior to 1900 due perhaps to the likeness of the name's pronunciation but Gwladus is nevertheless a proper name, that of one of the many daughters of Brychan, the 5th-century King of Brycheinog. The sandstone tilts gently to the south so forcing the waters of the Pyrddin up against the foot of a high cliff of mudstone and over the left- hand side of the rock lip (when viewed from below). In higher water conditions the fall gradually extends further to the right. The upper surface of the sandstone is roughly patterned with the fossil roots of trees. A rocking stone (now dislodged) sits on this bench some north of the falls. Sgwd Gwladus 2014-07-30 *Sgwd Einion Gam - Associated in legend with the 'lady' of Sgwd Gwladus, the 'fall of crooked Einion' is one of the most spectacular though least accessible of the falls of the area. The river drops into a plunge pool encircled by dark moss- and liverwort-covered cliffs. The falls have been created where the Pyrddin drops off the faulted edge of the Farewell Rock, a hard sandstone marking the base of the Carboniferous Coal Measures. The falls are difficult of access with only a rough path reaching them from the vicinity of Sgwd Gwladus downstream and requiring several tricky crossings of the river. =On other rivers= *Sychryd Cascade - The waters of Sychryd are here confined between the rocky walls of Craig-y-Ddinas (Dinas Rock) on the one hand and those of Bwa Maen (Stone Bow) on the other. Thought not a single fall, the tumbling of the river over a jumble of rocks in its bed at this spot is sometimes referred to as the Sychryd Cascade or Sgydau Sychryd. This rocky slot has been eroded by the river along the line of the Neath Disturbance, a heavily faulted zone extending northeast to southwest. Tramways approach both from above and below and there was formerly a substantial metal ramp constructed over the cascades linking the two levels though this has long since been removed after it fell into disuse and became a safety hazard. :More falls occur in the section of the river above the cascade. These falls can be viewed from the north bank which is publicly accessible. A further small fall at Pwll y Crochan near where the A465 Heads of the Valleys Road crosses the river though this spot is not accessible to the public. *Henrhyd Fall :The Nant Llech rises on the southern slopes of Carreg Cadno and flows to the village of Coelbren at which point it drops over the lip of a faulted block of the Farewell Rock, a hard sandstone. This spectacular site and section of the gorge below the falls is owned and managed by the National Trust. The waterfall is referred to in Welsh as Sgwd Henryd or as Rhaeadr Henryd. *Aberdulais Falls :The Dulais rises near the coalmining town of Aberdulais/Seven Sisters and flows for several miles to join the waters of the River Neath at Aberdulais. The falls are set only 160 yards (150 metres) up the river from that confluence (at OS grid ref SS772995) and are readily accessible from the A465 road which runs the length of the Vale of Neath. Not only is this a spectacular fall but also an important industrial heritage site which is now in the care of the National Trust. *Melincourt Falls :Melin Court Brook rises on the high ground to the southeast of Resolven in the Vale of Neath. It drops from the plateau surface above above sea level to the floor of the Vale of Neath at around in the space of just under . Several falls occur over its course but the single big drop of at Melincourt (OS grid ref SN826016) is the most spectacular and has drawn visitors for over 200 years since it was painted by Turner in 1794. :The falls (otherwise known as Melincwrt Falls), can be viewed from above, where a minor public road bridges the brook immediately upstream of the drop, and from below by means of a footpath which runs up beside the brook from the B4334 road between Melincourt village and Resolven. :The falls are contained within a nature reserve managed by the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales. Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council provide car parking beside the road at the start of the path up the falls. Information and interpretation for visitors The Brecon Beacons National Park Authority established a visitor centre at Pontneddfechan in 2008 making use of a building previously used by Neath Port Talbot County Borough Council as a tourist information centre. Renamed as the Waterfalls Centre, it was staffed throughout the year to provide information for visitors to Waterfall Country, the wider national park and the Fforest Fawr Geopark.

Development Rudge Ulster Rudge- Whitworth's last production racing motorcycle was named after Graham Walker's 1928 race win in the Ulster Grand Prix, only the second time a road race had been won at over . Graham was the father of racing commentator Murray Walker and was made Rudge Sales Manager in 1929. His win was particularly welcome as he had been unlucky in the Isle of Man TT on the same motorcycle two months earlier, when he narrowly lost the Senior TT race due to oil flow problems on the last lap. Originally developed as a racing prototype, the production model was essentially a race replica. Various modifications and improvements were made over the ten years of production. Early models had a 'pent roof' four- valve head, with two pairs of valves operating on parallel slopes like a 'pitched roof', which was replaced in 1932 with a radial four-valve head and an option of a foot-operated gear change. This foot pedal operated both the front and rear brakes, with a hand lever also operating the front brake. With a top speed of over , the Rudge Ulster was advertised as \\"probably the fastest 500cc motorcycle in production\\". 1933 was the era of the Great Depression and Rudge, struggling to make the sales needed to further develop the Ulster, went into receivership. In 1936 EMI (previously the Gramophone Company Ltd. and maker of HMV records), who were a major creditor, took over and resurrected the Rudge Ulster and moved production to their works in Hayes, Middlesex in 1937. The valve gear, which had always been exposed to the elements was sorted out in 1937, when a cast alloy cover was added - although the bronze cylinder head remained until it was replaced with a light alloy example in 1939. Production ended with the outbreak of the Second World War, when EMI had to put all their resources into the manufacture of Radar and electronic equipment for the war effort. From the days of the Gramophone Company, EMI, had had a policy of diversifying productions into other fields, like typewriters, as a strategy to avoid downturns and recessions. Racing success As well as Walker's 1928 Ulster Grand Prix win, in the same year Ernie Nott secured the world two-hour record at over on the Rudge and set further records in 1929. In 1930, under the guidance of team boss George Hack, Nott, Walker, Smith and Wal Handley were on Rudge 500 cc motorcycles for the Isle of Man TT Senior race, Handley winning at a record speed of with Graham Walker coming second, Smith 6th and Nott 7th, winning the Team Prize for Rudge.

Background Frenchtown was an important link in the north-south travel route during the 18th and 19th centuries. After the Revolutionary War, the popularity of the route for passengers and freight grew. A regular line of vessels began sailing from Baltimore to Frenchtown. As boats churned their way to the port, it established itself as a busy relay point on the main line of travel between Philadelphia and Baltimore. Statesmen and the traveling public came journeying through. At first the New Castle and Frenchtown Turnpike Company connected the village with the Delaware River, and later it was the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad. As a depot, it was burned by the British under Rear Admiral George Cockburn on April 29, 1813. The old Frenchtown Tavern remained standing until the 1960s. A watercolor by Benjamin Henry Latrobe dated August 2, 1806, is entitled View from the Packet Wharf at Frenchtown Looking Down Elk Creek showing the Mouth of Pates' Creek. The painting resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.View from the Packet Wharf at Frenchtown Looking down Elk Creek After publication of the escape of slaves by the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal a close watch was kept on vessels using that passage. Frenchtown and the overland route was considered a safer route. A large escape attempt involving a Captain Sayres and his vessel named Pearl involved seventy-seven slaves boarding in Washington attempting to make Frenchtown. Pearl was pursued and the becalmed vessel overtaken at the mouth of the Potomac. The northern portion of the Chesapeake Bay was notable for calms that delayed the sailing vessels connecting the town with Baltimore. In 1813 the first commercial steam vessel, Chesapeake built in Baltimore by Captain Edward Trippe, on the Chesapeake began service between Frenchtown and Baltimore as the Union Line. Within a year other steamers were making the run in competition. The transportation revolution caused the village to fade as the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal opened up. Then, with the completion in 1837 of a rail line through Elkton, one that did not require steamboat connections on each waterway, business on the route started declining. \\"By 1858, stagecoaches, wagons, rail cars, and steamers no longer converged here, crowding down to the old shoreline.\\" The New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad Right-of-Way was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Little Harwood is a multi-cultural place and there are many mosques and churches in the town to cater for the various religious denominations. Little Harwood is well known as the birthplace of Jack Walker, owner of Walker Steel and Flybe and benefactor of Blackburn Rovers FC, whose parents lived on Whalley Old Road. There are two state-funded schools located in the ward of Little Harwood: St Stephen's CE Primary School and Tauheedul Islam Boys' High School. St Stephen's was formed 2010 when an infants and junior school combined on one site on Robinson Street at a multi-coloured rectangular building costing around ¬£7million. Tauheedul Islam Boys' High School is a free school which opened in 2012. There are also two independent schools within the ward of Little Harwood; Madressa-e-Islamia Educational Centre and Jamiatul-llm Wal Huda UK School. Masjid-e-Sajedeen, formerly Unit 4 Cinemas, is the hub of the local Muslim community whose numbers have increased manifold since the arrival of the original Gujerati Valli 'Hitler', Desai and Musa families into the area in the early 1960s. The former came from Valan, India whilst the latter (originally from Sarnar, India) from Nairobi, Kenya. Nowadays the make up of the local village shops have changed drastically. The former Co-operative is now a shadow into a run down mini market, whilst Barnes Bakery which stood testament to the very last English Bakers ceased trading in May 2017. Cohens Chemist now occupies a location next to the Health Centre whilst further up Whalley Old Road the likes of Reggies Sweet shop and Daves Hairdressers have long gone to be replaced by Poundshops and Asian grocery stores. Indeed, the make up of Little Harwood population has also markedly changed in the millennium with a significant north Indian and Pakistan origin families establishing themselves here amongst a few original English elderly families residing towards Tintern Crescent. Broadfold allotments have and continue to be tended by predominantly Indian gardeners as the older generation have faded. The Esat family were instrumental in laying the foundations working this land since the late 1960s and are indeed the original custodians. Their presence is seen in the annual Asian crops grown behind the now locked allotment gates. Sad reminder how the once plot was a place for the community to feel safe and go to now under lock and key. The Little Harwood Clock Tower was unveiled in 1923 and the hourly chime can still be heard in memory of the local lads that fell during the two wars.

He performed with many of the Armenian, Greek and Turkish singers of the day, and recorded his first album, \\"Armenian Love Songs\\", in 1965. Famed French-born Armenian-American singer Onnik Dinkjian appeared as the lead vocalist on the album, with Roupen playing oud and providing occasional backup vocals, playing violin on a few numbers, as well as writing and/or arranging all the pieces. Altiparmakian has a unique musical style and rhythm that has earned him a respected reputation. His song \\"Hey Valla\\" originally released on the album \\"Armenian Love Songs\\" became a standard in the repertoire of Armenian-American kef bands (dance bands which play for weddings and other ethnic functions). It was covered on recordings by Richie Berberian with Mal Barsamian, John Bilezikjian, Robert Takoushian, Robert Chilingirian, Ara Topouzian, and Mike Gostanian among others. His song \\"Lucy\\" was covered by Adiss Harmandian without however, giving Roupen songwriting credit. The albums \\"Armenian Kef Songs\\" and \\"Oud Taxims\\" were released after his death by his family. They were compiled from unreleased, studio, but mostly homemade recordings, that Roupen recorded at home.

Crystal Beach is a partnership between two brothers of the Green family. Kenneth \\"Gene\\" Eugene Green and Alfred \\"Dickie\\" Ernest Green (1933‚Äì2010). The community is inhabited seasonally with the majority of its inhabitants calling the Delaware Valley area their home. There are many large families there who have been frequenting the small private beach community for generations. Within the past five years, a small group of members have begun to coordinate events for the community to help raise funds to improve the quality of life at the small resort area. It is a prime location for boating and sunbathing. White Crystal Beach was founded in the mid-1930s by Alfred Ernest Green and his wife Ethel Pearsey Green at the site of Reybold's Wharf. The Green family had formerly owned a traveling carnival, then small amusement parks in Wilmington, Delaware, Penns Grove, New Jersey, and Charlestown, Maryland. The Green family created a summer-only, private rental resort on the Elk River and named it \\"White Crystal Beach\\". The Green family built bathhouses, a dance hall, beer garden, bowling alley, and even a tattoo parlor. Children's amusement park rides and an antique merry-go-round were brought from the traveling carnival, and a few dozen simple wooden cottages were built as rental units. Ernest and Ethel brought in their son Kenneth Green (wife Edna) and daughter Ella Green Crump to help run the concessions and manage the business. Eventually they were joined by their grandchildren, William, Dorcas, and Alfred Crump, along with \\"Gene\\", \\"Dickie\\", \\"Betty\\", and \\"Margie\\" Green, who all worked in various aspects of the family business. Alfred Ernest Green died in the late 1940s, and the management was passed on to his son Kenneth Green. The early 1950s brought some changes with damage from Hurricane Hazel in 1954, and a devastating fire in 1955. Ethel Green and her daughter Ella Green Crump Spence bought the farm property abutting the northern property line to renovate for their retirement, but Ella died in 1957, and Ethel retired to her second home in Florida, where she died in 1959. The farm property was passed to Ella's children and became \\"Elkview Shores\\".

It is owned and operated by the City of Toronto as Toronto‚Äôs main landfill, located west of the city. It operates a leachate collection system and an on-site leachate treatment plant. Green Lane also has an extensive landfill gas collection system. This gas is roughly 50 percent methane and 50 percent carbon dioxide, along with traces of other gases. The gas is collected and directed to the flaring system that allows for release into the air. History and politics As Toronto‚Äôs last remaining landfill site, Keele Valley, neared capacity during the 1990s, it was found that no other municipality in Southern Ontario was willing to accept the garbage, but there was also no political support for a change to incineration. A deal was eventually made to ship Toronto's garbage to the Adams Mine, an abandoned open pit mine in Northern Ontario, once the Keele Valley site closed. But controversy grew into vehement objection as the time neared, and eventually the agreement was canceled. By the time the Keele Valley site closed at the end of 2002, the city had made a new deal, to ship its garbage by truck to Carleton Farms Landfill in Sumpter Township, Michigan, United States. Issues at the Canada‚ÄìUnited States border and opposition from residents in Michigan prompted the need to look for alternate sites or expand the city's recycling programs. The Michigan contract survived a vote in February 2006 by the Michigan House of Representatives to ban out-of-state garbage from being shipped to the state from Ontario and other U.S. states, as it also required approval by the US federal government before it could be enforced by Michigan. In May 2006, the Michigan Carleton Farms garbage dump under contract with the city of Toronto announced it would not be accepting waste sludge as of August 1, 2006, but would continue to receive household waste. In September 2006, Toronto City Council agreed to purchase the privately owned Green Lane landfill site. Councillors opposed to the agreement accused Toronto Mayor David Miller of pushing through a secretive deal, and there was also a strong reaction from residents and members of parliament from the London metropolitan area. Jane Pitfield, who ran (and lost) against Miller in the November 2006 municipal election, advocated incineration as an alternative method of disposing of waste. Many Toronto environmental groups opposed it, but supporters argued that the technology has improved and incineration is now less polluting. Even with 60% diversion through the green bin and recycling programs, residual waste from the Greater Toronto Area would amass 2,200 tonnes (2,425 tons) a day or 800,000 tonnes (882,000 tons) a year. In April 2007, the city signed contracts with First Nations bands whose reserves were close to the proposed landfill, which would entitle the bands to $4.27 per tonne of garbage deposited at the landfill, or approximately $500,000 per year. The contract to ship household garbage to Michigan ended in 2010, at which point use of the Green Lane landfill began.

A replica of the famous British Supermarine Spitfire World War II fighter, it was originally produced to 75% scale. Subsequent models have increased the scale of the fuselage and added a second seat. Design and development Australian pilot and aviation engineer Mike O'Sullivan had always wanted a Spitfire and built a replica for his own use in 1991. This was followed by a , Rotax- powered prototype in 1994. The next year, in 1995, he joined with business partner John McCarron to form the Supermarine Aircraft company and produce all-Australian homebuild aircraft kits. In the event, the constant-speed, four-blade propeller would be obtained from a specialist firm in New Zealand. Supermarine Aircraft is not related to the original British Supermarine company, although the owners of the Supermarine marque have given their permission for the name to be used. The first production model was named the Spitfire Mk25 and was a 75% scale replica of the original Supermarine Spitfire design. The stressed skin structure consists of 2024 aluminium alloy skins, formers and longerons with some fibre-glass mouldings for parts such as fairings and air scoops. The design features electrically-operated retractable undercarriage, with differential braking to the main wheels, and landing flaps. The later Spitfire MK26 uses the MK25 wings with the fuselage increased to 80% scale to provide room for a passenger seat in tandem behind the pilot. The Mk26B has a 90% scale fuselage. The Spitfire kit has the same power-to- weight ratio as the original. The aircraft was reviewed by the Australian Ultralight Federation in 2001. It was approved as meeting Australian rules for kit-built aircraft. Supermarine began promoting the kit plane to the US market in 2004. The aircraft has been approved by the British Light Aircraft Association.Light Aircraft Association - Approved aircraft list Retrieved: 31 January 2009Light Aircraft Association - Approved aircraft list Retrieved: 18 August 2009 The company has since moved to Cisco Airport, Texas in the US, which O'Sullivan also manages. =Powerplant= The prototype MK25 was initially fitted with a Rotax engine, before development progressed through a series of more powerful Jabiru types. Early production models were powered by eight-cylinder, Jabiru engines made in Australia. Subsequently, the company introduced a V6 Isuzu engine conversion, producing with supercharger, as well as a V8 General Motors automotive engine conversion producing . Early versions of the Spitfire MK26 used an eight-cylinder Jabiru 5100 horizontally opposed aero engine, but early installations suffered from inadequate cooling. The company now offers a V6 engine. The normally aspirated version of this engine produces with a supercharged version producing up to .Supermarine Aircraft - Engine and Propeller Retrieved: 31 January 2009 The maximum rpm of a propeller (at about 2800 depending on its diameter) is about half that at the maximum torque/power rpm of about 5500 rpm for a car engine, which therefore must be fitted with a drive reduction unit. Such units absorb about 20% of the engine power and therefore the normally aspirated Isuzu unit delivers the same maximum power as the Jabiru 5100. Recent developments of the Jabiru engine range by Rotec have produced replacement water-cooled cylinder heads for the 5100. This has removed the overheating problems and also allowed the nose cowling of the Mk26 to be reshaped to remove the air intake and considerably reduce the frontal area to be in keeping with the original sleek design of the Spitfire.

The '80% scale' refers only to the fuselage that was lengthened to 80% of the original MK5 Spitfire.

Option of dual controls, '90% scale'. Again the '90% scale' refers only to the fuselage, that was again lengthened (in fact to 89.5% the length of the original MK5 Spitfire); the fuselage was also made fatter in the cockpit area. The same wing was used from the 75% scale aircraft, resulting in a wingspan and undercarriage height identical to the original 75% scale aircraft.

The inquest concluded that Michael O‚ÄôSullivan, the CEO of Supermarine Pty Ltd, admitted that the aircraft test flight period had only been 20 hours instead of the 37.5 hours declared, that he had \\"knowingly falsified documents to achieve registration of his aircraft with RA-Aus (Recreational Aviation Australia), rather than the more stringent registration with CASA (Civil Aviation Safety Authority)\\", and he admitted to \\"significantly understating the weight of the aircraft (by about 200kg)\\" (around half of the aircraft's stated empty weight of 401 kg). In 2013, A MK26 80% scale Spitfire crashed in Adelaide, Australia. The pilot, as the only passenger in the aircraft, died as a result of the accident.

Ekeland's variational principle can be used when the lower level set of a minimization problems is not compact, so that the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem cannot be applied. Ekeland's principle relies on the completeness of the metric space. Ekeland's principle leads to a quick proof of the Caristi fixed point theorem. Ekeland's principle has been shown to be equivalent to completeness of metric spaces. Ekeland was associated with the Paris Dauphine University when he proposed this theorem. Ekeland's variational principle=Preliminaries= Let f : X to mathbb{R} cup { - infty, + infty } be a function. Then, * operatorname{dom} f := left{ x in X : f(x) eq +infty right}. * f is proper if operatorname{dom} f eq emptyset (i.e. if f is not identically +infty). * f is bounded below if inf_{x in X} f(x) > -infty. * given x_0 in X, say that f is lower semicontinuous at x_0 if for every y there exists a neighborhood U of x_0 such that f(x) > y for all x in U. * f is lower semicontinuous if it is lower semicontinuous at every point of X.  A function is lower semi-continuous if and only if {xin X : ~f(x)>y} is an open set for every y in mathbb{R}; alternatively, a function is lower semi-continuous if and only if all of its lower level sets {xin X: ~f(x)leq y} are closed. =Statement of the theorem= Theorem (Ekeland): Let (X, d) be a complete metric space and f : X to mathbb{R} cup { + infty } a proper (i.e. not identically +infty) lower semicontinuous function that is bounded below. Pick epsilon > 0 and x_0 in X such that f(x_0) eq +infty (or equivalently, f(x_0) in mathbb{R}). There exists some v in X such that :f(v) leq fleft( x_0 right) - epsilon d left( x_0, v right) and for all x eq v, :f(v) < f(x) + epsilon d left( v, x right). =Proof of theorem= Define a function G : X times X to mathbb{R} cup { + infty } by :Gleft( x, y right) := f(x) + epsilon d(x, y) and note that G is lower semicontinuous (being the sum of the lower semicontinuous function f and the continuous function (x, y) mapsto epsilon d(x, y)). Given z in X, define the functions G_z := G(z, cdot) : X mathbb{R} cup { + infty } and G^z := G(cdot, z) : X mathbb{R} cup { + infty } and define the set :F(z) := left{ y in Y : G_z(y) leq f(z) right} = left{ y in Y : f(z) + epsilon d(z, y) leq f(z) right}. It is straightforward to show that for all x in X, # F(x) is closed (because G_x := G(x, cdot) : X mathbb{R} cup { + infty } is lower semicontinuous); # if x otin operatorname{dom} f then F(x) = X; # if x in operatorname{dom} f then x in F(x) subseteq operatorname{dom} f; in particular, x_0 in F(x_0) subseteq operatorname{dom} f; # if y in F(x) then F(y) subseteq F(x). Let s_0 = inf_{x in F(x_0)} f(x), which is a real number since f was assumed to be bounded below. Pick x_1 in Fleft( x_0 right) such that fleft( x_1 right) < s_0 + 2^{-1}. Having defined s_{n-1} and x_n, define s_{n} := inf_{x in Fleft( x_{n} right)} f(x) and pick x_{n+1} in Fleft( x_n right) such that f left( x_{n+1} right) < s_n + 2^{- (n + 1)}. Observe the following: * for all n geq 0, Fleft( x_{n+1} right) subseteq F left( x_n right) (because x_{n+1} in F left( x_n right), where this now implies that s_{n+1} geq s_n; * for all n geq 1, because x_{n+1} in F left( x_n right) ::epsilon dleft( x_{n+1}, x_n right) leq f left( x_n right) - f left( x_{n+1} right) leq f left( x_n right) - s_n leq f left( x_n right) - s_{n-1} < 2^{-n} It follows that for all n, p geq 1, dleft( x_{n+1}, x_n right) leq epsilon 2^{1 - n}, thus showing that left( x_n right)_{n=0}^{infty} is a Cauchy sequence. Since X is a complete metric space, there exists some v in X such that left( x_n right)_{n=0}^{infty} converges to v. Since x_m in F left( x_n right) for all m geq n, we have v in operatorname{cl} F (x_n) = F(x_n) for all n geq 0, where in particular, v in F(x_0). We will show that F left( v right) = left{ v right} from which the conclusion of the theorem will follow. Let x in F (v) and note that since x in F(x_n) for all n geq 0, we have as above that epsilon dleft( x_{n+1}, x_n right) leq 2^{-n} and note that this implies that left( x_n right)_{n=0}^{infty} converges to x. Since the limit of left( x_n right)_{n=0}^{infty} is unique, we must have x = v. Thus F left( v right) = left{ v right}, as desired. Q.E.D. =Corollaries= Corollary: Let (X, d) be a complete metric space, and let f: X ‚Üí R ‚à™ {+‚àû} be a lower semicontinuous functional on X that is bounded below and not identically equal to +‚àû. Fix Œµ > 0 and a point x_0 ‚àà X such that :fleft( x_0 right) leq varepsilon + inf_{x in X} f(x). Then, for every Œª > 0, there exists a point v ‚àà X such that :f(v) leq fleft( x_0 right), :dleft( x_0, v right) leq lambda, and, for all x ‚â† v, :f(x) > f(v) - frac{varepsilon}{lambda} d(v, x). Note that a good compromise is to take lambda := sqrt{epsilon} in the preceding result.

Her most prestigious victories included the Swedish Trotting Criterium (Swedish: Svenskt Travkriterium) (1992), the Swedish Trotting Derby (Swedish: Svenskt Travderby) (1993), Grand Prix de l'U.E.T. (1993), Prix d'Am√©rique (1995), Gran Premio della Lotteria (1995) and Oslo Grand Prix (1996). At the end of her career, the mare had earned US$2,963,019.Ina Scot won 20,252,530 Swedish Kronor (SEK). In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-05-26, the date of Ina Scot's last race, have been used. Her 31 consecutive wins between April 28, 1992 and March 7, 1994 was a new world record. Ina Scot was awarded the Horse of the Year Award in Sweden for 1992, 1993 and 1995. Early years As a filly, Ina Scot was discovered and purchased by Swedish horseman Kjell P. Dahlstr√∂m close to his farm, Hassang√•rden, outside Tran√•s, Sweden. Dahlstr√∂m was the mare's trainer during her entire career, and either he or his then-wife Helen A. Johansson drove Ina Scot in all of her 90 races. Racing career=1991 - 2 years old= Ina Scot made her competitive debut as a two-year-old on August 26, 1991, at her home racetrack, Mantorp. She won that race as well as three other events during 1991. In the biggest Swedish event for trotters two years old, Svensk Uppf√∂dningsl√∂pning, she finished fifth. =1992 - 3 years old= Ina Scot did won any of her first three races in 1992, but after that, she started to line up victories. She won a world-record-breaking 31 straight times between April 28, 1992, and March 7, 1994. During this run, at age three, she claimed major Swedish stakes races F√§rjestads Nordiska Tre√•ringspris, the Swedish Trotting Criterium and Breeders Crown open for 3-year-old mares. =1993 - 4 years old= As a four-year-old, Ina Scot won all the events she participated in. Always the heavy favourite, she took prestigious trophies like Drottning Silvias Pokal, Stochampionatet, the Swedish Trotting Derby, Grand Prix de l'U.E.T. (her first race abroad), and the Breeders Crown open for mares age four. Her track record was 17 for 17, and she was accompanied by Dahlstr√∂m at all these occasions. Ina Scot earned US$1,003,789 in 1993.She won 6,861,000 Swedish Kronor (SEK) in 1993. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-05-26, the date of her last race, have been used. =1994 - 5 years old= In her debut of 1994, in a minor race at home track Mantorp on March 7, Ina Scot's winning streak came to an end. On April 16, she entered her first major event for seasoned trotters, Olympiatravet at √Öby. Together with Dahlstr√∂m, she finished fourth, but they avenged the loss a fortnight later when they claimed Forus Open in Norway. Her next big task was the Swedish Elitloppet at Solvalla in Stockholm, one of the world's premiere international trotting events. However, Dahlstr√∂m and Ina Scot failed to progress from the eliminations. Later in the summer, the mare won the St. Michel Race in Mikkeli, Finland. She finished outside the money in big events like Jubileumspokalen at Solvalla and Preis der Besten in Munich, Germany but won a couple of smaller domestic races. 20 races during the year meant 10 wins and US$291,384.Ina Scot won 1,991,640 Swedish Kronor (SEK) in 1994. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-05-26, the date of Ina Scot's last race, have been used. =1995 - 6 years old=The historic win in Prix d'Am√©rique In early 1995, Ina Scot and her connections attended the Vincennes winter meeting in Paris, France. On January 15, they got nothing out of Prix de Belgique. Two weeks later, they competed in Prix d'Am√©rique, the biggest race in France and one of the greatest harness events in the world. Helen A. Johansson, who sat up behind Ina Scot in Prix d'Am√©rique, was the first woman ever to drive in the race. With a soft hand, Johansson guided her mare past the favourite, French Vourasie, in the stretch. Thus, Johansson became both the first woman to race in Prix d'Am√©rique and the first woman to win the event. The year brought another huge win. In May, Ina Scot claimed the big international Italian event Gran Premio della Lotteria at Agnano, Naples. For the second time, she failed to reach the final of Elitloppet. She took part of, and had moderate success in, other major Swedish races like Olympiatravet, Hugo √Öbergs Memorial and Jubileumspokalen. Abroad, she raced at among others Norwegian racetrack Bjerke in Oslo, German track Gelsenkirchen, and San Siro in Milan, but none of these trips resulted in victories. In 1995, Ina Scot made 23 starts out of which she won eight. She earned US$967,627 that year.Ina Scot won 6,613,830 Swedish Kronor (SEK) in 1995. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-05-26, the date of Ina Scot's last race, have been used. =1996 - 7 years old= In Ina Scot's last year on the tracks, her connections chose a similar start of the campaign as in previous year. First the mare entered Prix de Belgique and two weeks later Prix d'Am√©rique. The success of 1995 was not repeated, as Ina Scot and driver Johansson finished fourth in Prix d'Am√©rique, before they rounded off the last French trip by ending up without money in Prix de France. After a rest period of a couple of months, Ina Scot returned in April and lost a minor race at home track Mantorp. On May 12, she claimed the Norwegian international race Oslo Grand Prix. Ina Scot then again tried to make it to the Elitloppet final but failed. This marked the end of her career as a racing horse. The last year on the racetracks gave a total of US$168,227 in six races and one win.Ina Scot won 1,149,850 Swedish Kronor (SEK) in 1996. In the conversion to USD, the rates of 1996-05-26, the date of her last race, have been used. Her total earnings during her racing career were US$2,963,019, making her the richest Swedish mare trotter ever. Breeding career After quitting racing, Ina Scot started her new career as a breeding mare. Her first offspring, Ambassadeur Brunn, was born in April 1998 before Ina Scot was purchased by German Michael Schr√∂er. During her years in Germany, she gave birth to Nordic Gold November (b. 2000), Oscar November (b. 2001) and Paul November (b. 2002, finalist in the Swedish Trotting Derby 2006). In August 2007, the Italian-born colt Michael November was the most expensive among 63 one-year-olds sold at a horse sale in the Netherlands, costing ‚Ç¨66,000. At this time, it was reported that Schr√∂er had sold Ina Scot to Dutch real estate broker Ger Visser.

The site is bounded by Finch Avenue East to the north, the Scarborough- Pickering Town Line to the east, CN Rail line to the west and hydro corridor to the south. Metropolitan Toronto opened the site in 1967 with the approval of Scarborough Council. The 80.5-hectare site, originally with a capacity of 3.3 million tonnes, received solid waste through 1988. Metro and Scarborough agreed to expand the landfill's capacity by 635,000 tonnes in 1971 and 5.4 million tonnes in 1974. Following closure of the landfill in 1983, the City continued to manage the site to control potential impacts. To limit emissions and control odours, the surface of the site was equipped with an array of passive candlestick gas flares. The City developed a landfill gas to electricity project at the Beare Road site. Construction of the LFG collection field and power plant proceeded and generation of electricity from LFG began in January 1996. Attempts at a ski resort Scarborough's desire was first expressed in 1971, to improve the site for recreational purposes. Metro would design the facility and manage disbursements from the trust account; Scarborough would lease the property as of 1978, undertake construction, and assume any excess costs. In 1982, Scarborough cancelled this agreement. Metro undertook preliminary work on the ski facility into the early 1990s before abandoning the project. As plans emerged for the Rouge Park, Metro officials acknowledged that a ski facility at Beare Road would likely be rejected by the Province, given the project's incompatibility with other land uses in and around the park and the range of possible environmental impacts. Rouge Park Today the former landfill is adjacent to Rouge National Urban Park and the Rouge Valley Conservation Centre, which is operated by a non-profit organization, the Rouge Valley Foundation. The Rouge Valley Conservation Centre is located at the foot of Zoo Road. The former landfill site, now vegetated with wooded and grassland areas, is not accessible by Zoo Road, as the CN rail crossing is not safe for pedestrians. At present, hikers cannot access the landfill, as it is under redevelopment as a natural area parkland. However, hikers may still access the landfill through one of several holes currently in the fence surrounding the landfill, but it is ill-advised.

Opened in 1974, it originally featured J. C. Penney and Sears as its major anchor stores, the latter taking the place of a Britt's discount store which never opened for business. A 1980 expansion added a new wing with a Meis department store, which was sold to Elder-Beerman in 1989, while Sears relocated to Illinois Centre Mall and was replaced by Montgomery Ward. Further expansion in 1991 added several new tenants, along with a food court and the anchor stores Famous-Barr and Venture Stores. The latter closed in 1993 and was converted to K's Merchandise Mart; Elder-Beerman and Montgomery Ward also closed in the 1990s, with the former undergoing conversion to offices and the latter being subdivided for a theater and smaller stores. Famous-Barr converted to Macy's in 2006, and K's Merchandise Mart closed in 2007. The mall has seen several closures in stores throughout the 21st century; remaining mall tenants include JCPenney, Maurices, Ross Dress for Less, Lane Bryant, Ulta Beauty, Old Navy, Bed Bath & Beyond, Illinicare Health, and SIH Medical Group. University Mall is managed by Namdar Realty Group. History The first store to open at University Mall was a J. C. Penney department store, which opened in 1971. The same year, real estate developers David E. Hocker and Alan Squitieri, both of Owensboro, Kentucky, announced plans to build a mall extending easterly from the J. C. Penney store. Under their plans, the other original anchor stores would be Britt's (a discount department store owned by J. J. Newberry) and a Walgreens pharmacy. After construction of the Britt's store was completed, the company defaulted on its lease, and the store was never completed. As a result, the space was instead converted to Sears. The mall was slated to open in October 1974. In addition to J. C. Penney, Sears, and Walgreens, it also featured 20 other stores including Kirlin's Hallmark, Zales Jewelers, Baskin-Robbins, Waldenbooks, Regis Hairstylists, Karmelkorn, and General Nutrition Center, with a four-screen American Multi- Cinema theater planned for opening by December. Opening ceremonies occurred on October 30, 1974, accompanied by the Carbondale Community High School band and then-Miss Illinois Jean Ahern, along with performers dressed as Winnie the Pooh and Big Bird. The first expansion to the mall occurred in 1980, when a new wing was added consisting of more than ten new storefronts and another anchor store, Meis of Illiana. Among the stores present in the new wing were Lerner New York, Spencer Gifts, Pearle Vision, Pier 1 Imports, Kinney Shoes, and Claire's, along with relocations of two existing tenants. In August 1989, Elder-Beerman completed acquisition and renaming of all stores in the Meis chain, including the location at University Mall. A year later, Sears relocated to the now defunct Illinois Centre Mall in nearby Marion, and their location at University Mall was sold to Montgomery Ward. A second expansion in 1991 added a new wing anchored by Famous-Barr and Venture Stores, along with a food court. Venture opened for business in March 1991, with many stores in their wing, including Victoria's Secret, Limited Express, and a relocation of Lerner New York, following in May. This new expansion cost over $43 million, and consisted of over of retail space. Both Montgomery Ward and Famous-Barr opened for business on November 1, 1991. Other stores joining the mall at this point included Hibbett Sports, Maurices, and Belden Jewelers. Venture closed its store at University Mall in 1993, and later became K's Merchandise Mart. Elder-Beerman closed in 1997 and became health offices. An Old Navy was added in May 2002, and later that year, the Montgomery Ward space was demolished for a movie theater owned by Kerasotes (later AMC Theatres) and other small stores, including Bed Bath & Beyond, Goody's Family Clothing, Steve & Barry's, and Michaels. The food court was relocated in 2004 to the former Elder-Beerman wing. In 2005, Stoltz Management acquired the mall, and one year later, Famous-Barr was one of several nameplates to be converted to Macy's. K's Merchandise closed in early 2007, as did Michaels.http://thesouthern.com/news/article_f1108576-8e26-55eb-a734-965dc5cb9681.html These closures were followed in 2008 by Goody's and Steve & Barry's.

By the 1960s, the city planned to close significant portions of the line in Jamaica. This was part of Mayor John Lindsay's effort to demolish \\"obsolete elevated railway structures\\" in the city, and in preparation for the Archer Avenue Subway which would replace the eliminated portions of the line. In 1977, the three stops east of Queens Boulevard station were closed, and it became temporary terminal for the Jamaica Avenue Line.

History People and nature have long flourished beside the Middle Patuxent River. Over 12,000 years ago, Native Americans hunted deer and gathered acorns and other wild food in the woods and waters. People from Woodland Indian cultures settled nearby approximately 2,000 years ago, leaving traces of their lives in the earthenware pottery and stone tools they left behind. In 1741, John Hobbs acquired the patent on the lands around Simpsonville. The land passed to Rachel Worthington in 1789, followed by Richard Owings in 1796. The early 19th century Simpsonville Mill water-powered grist mill and saw mill was built here, as well as a woolen factory, wheelwright shop, blacksmith shop, and nine houses. In 1850, the town became known as Simpsonville, named after its first postmaster, Charles Simpson. In 1852, Charles Ridgley Simpson bought 215 acres which included the mill and town center. The Simpsons, Warfields, Owingses and other families lived in the Simpsonville for generations. In the 1920s and 1930s, mill owner John Iglehart kept detailed ledgers of purchases at his mill store. The Saumenigs, who owned the future Robinson property, shopped at the Iglehart store as early as 1926. The area was home to Howard County Commissioner De Wilton Partlett, who lost his home when his neighbor Fedora Boski burned his farm buildings and perished in the event in 1928. Simpsonville remained a hub for the local economy until undermined by the declining milling industry and the Great Depression. Nearby Atholton postal services were merged with Simpsonville. Lee Preston led Atholton High School students to conduct the first archeological excavations around Simpsonville in 1984. Over 42,000 artifacts have been recovered through decades of investigations, including machine parts, clothing, bottles, window glass, and two millstones. Primary documents, including wills, deeds, letters, and photographs, provide further insights into life and work in historic Simpsonville. The Simpsonville Mill Archaeological and Historic District is one of the few professionally studied mill sites in Maryland. Research at the site continues to reveal more about the roles of small industrial and commercial communities in Maryland‚Äôs early economy. From 1963 to 1966, The Rouse Company purchased large tracts of Simpsonville to develop Columbia. The development displaced farms and small scientific businesses like JEJA that bred scientific research primates. Throughout this time, racial tensions arose with cross burnings.

It is a small community located north of Poolesville.  Darby Store  The Darby Store is located at the intersection of Beallsville and Darnestown roads. It is a historic and cultural landmark. In the mid-1800s the site of Darby store was occupied by a small blacksmith store and shop. However, in 1908, the shop was demolished after Harry C. Darby bought the land. By 1910, Darby built the -story general store where local residents bought supplies and picked up mail. Darby store closed in 1974, and remained fully intact until a tractor-trailer destroyed the front porch in the late 1980s. In 2004, the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission bought the Store and Darby house for $670,000, a year after the Montgomery Preservation nonprofit agency declared the building ‚Äúone of the county‚Äôs most endangered historic sites.‚Äù Julie Mueller, cultural resources planner for Montgomery County claimed that the structure would be moved back from the corner next year. During the summer of 2009, the site was under excavation. A team of archaeologists spent three weeks at the site and their findings included: oyster shells, glass shards, coal, nails, ceramic pipe stems, a 1918 liberty dime, and a Yoo-hoo bottle, all of which provide clues to the history of the area, and the buildings occupying it since the 19th century.\\"At the crossroads of history in Montgomery County: Volunteer archaeologists sift through artifacts, explore Beallsville's Darby Store\\" , Gazette.net, Friday, July 31, 2009.  Monocacy Cemetery  The Monocacy Cemetery is located at 19801 W Hunter Rd. This old cemetery dates back to the American Revolution, although none of the known burials are that old. The cemetery is the final resting place for about 6,000 persons from Beallsville, Poolesville, and the surrounding area. Located in the upper West area of Montgomery County, near to Sugarloaf Mountain, is this secluded and historic place. Monocacy Cemetery occupies the property that was the former Chapel of Ease of All Saints parish of Frederick County, known as Monocacy Chapel, which stood as early as 1747 in which prayers for peace were offered during the Revolutionary War. In 1770, when the parish of Montgomery expanded, the St. Peter's Episcopal Church took possession. During the War of 1812, it became a camping ground for the American forces. In 1849, the congregation moved to a new church in Poolesville, leaving the old church to fall into ruins. In January 1872, the vestry of St. Peter's transferred the churchyard over to the newly formed Monocacy Cemetery Society of Montgomery County, which included Frederick Sprigg Poole, Dr. N. Brewer, William Wallace Poole, Howard Griffith, Nathan White Allnutt, John A. Jones, and Isaac Young. Burials began taking place shortly afterward, though there are many stones from the original chapel still surrounding the rebuilt chapel. The cemetery has been documented in a book, Monocacy Cemetery Beallsville, Montgomery County, Maryland by Elizabeth R. Frain. The book is based on all the available records of the cemetery and includes Interment Books, Burial Permits, card files and tombstones.Monocacy Cemetery, MD Tombstone Transcription Project , USGenweb project, Last updated: 11/1/2004. Beallsville during the Civil War In the latter part of 1861, Union soldiers were encamped in the small town of Beallsville, known at the time as Monocacy Church. The 1748 Anglican \\"Chapel of Ease\\" from which the town acquired its name was nearly destroyed by the Union occupation. Beallsville was a crossroads on the road from Rockville to the Monocacy River and Nolands ferry, making it a strategic spot for the Union. As part of the Maryland Campaign, in September 1862, Illinois and Indiana cavalry met units from Virginia in Beallsville after becoming engaged the day before in Poolesville. The engagement resulted in two Virginian dead, and the capture of their captain and six other enlisted men. On October 12, 1862, a second cavalry battle took place in Beallsville. As part of Gen. J.E.B. Stuart's second ride around the Army of the Potomac, Stuart was returning to White's Ford and confronted by Federal forces based out of Beallsville, a mile north of the Chapel. Confederate artillery held the Federal troops and Stuart was able to cross the Potomac. After the war, the E.V. White Chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy rebuilt Monocacy Church in the Monocacy cemetery. A celebration commemorating the birthday of Jefferson Davis was held every June 3 at the cemetery.

It is the world's first FSRU converted from a liquified natural gas (LNG) carrier. History Golar Spirit was built by the Kawasaki Shipbuilding Corporation in 1981 as an LNG carrier. It was the first Japan-built and first Asia-built LNG carrier. In 1986, Golar Spirit was chartered for twenty years by Indonesian oil and gas company Pertamina. It served the line delivering LNG from Indonesia to South Korea. In April 2007, Golar Spirit was charter contracted by Petrobras for serving as the Pec√©m LNG terminal. The conversion started on 1 October 2007 at the Keppel Shipyard in Singapore. The conversion was completed in mid-2008 and Golar Spirit headed to Brazil on 11 June 2008. On her course, the Golar Spirit transported a LNG load from Trinidad and Tobago to Brazil. She arrived in Pec√©m on 22 July 2008. On 30 January 2009, Golar Spirit became the first vessel of this kind, which regasified LNG aboard. Technical description The FSRU Golar Spirit operates at a jetty to which it is moored. LNG is transported to the FSRU by LNG carriers, that berth to the other side of the jetty. The LNG is vaporized in the onboard regasification system, which enables the FSRU to provide natural gas to the onshore consumers (power plants). It is a steel mono hull with LNG tanks arranged in the middle, with the re-gasification plant in the forward section and crew facilities with control room and utility machinery in the aft section. The engineering of the regasification system and the tanks were provided by Moss Maritime of Norway. The Norwegian company Bj√∏rge engineered its pressure protection system through its subsidiary Solberg & Andersen. Golar Spirit is equipped with a regasification system comprising high pressure LNG pumps, cryogenic LNG vaporizers and associated valves, piping and instrumentation. LNG pumps are provided by Shinko, while LNG vaporizers are provided by Thermax. The vaporizers use steam generated by the onboard existing steam boilers. The design pressure of the vaporizers exceeds . Each vaporiser with wall thickness of over is over long and weighs in excess of . The regasification capacity of the Golar Spirit is (over of LNG per hour), and its storage capacity is of LNG, equivalent to of natural gas. Det Norske Veritas has issued a Statement of Approval of the Regasification Plant and Interim Class Certificate confirming the REGAS-2 Class notation. Ownership Golar Spirit is owned by Golar LNG.

It refers to the network of Chinese military and commercial facilities and relationships along its sea lines of communication, which extend from the Chinese mainland to Port Sudan in the Horn of Africa. The sea lines run through several major maritime choke points such as the Strait of Mandeb, the Strait of Malacca, the Strait of Hormuz, and the Lombok Strait as well as other strategic maritime centers in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, the Maldives, and Somalia. Many commentators in India believe this plan, together with the China‚ÄìPakistan Economic Corridor and other parts of China's Belt and Road Initiative under Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, is a threat to India's national security. Such a system would encircle India and threaten its power projection, trade, and potentially territorial integrity. Furthermore, China's support for India's traditional enemy of Pakistan (see: Indo-Pakistani wars and conflicts) and its Gwadar Port is viewed as a threat, compounded by fears that China may develop an overseas naval military base in Gwadar, which could allow China to conduct expeditionary warfare in the IOR. From the east, the deep-water port of Kyaukpyu is also viewed with similar concern. The first comprehensive academic analyses of Chinese plan and its security implications for New Delhi is known to be undertaken in February 2008 by an active-duty Indian naval officer.Khurana, Gurpreet S China's 'String of Pearls' in the Indian Ocean and Its Security Implications Strategic Analysis 32 (1): February 2008, 1-39. Antedating China's anti-piracy naval deployment in the Indian Ocean beginning in December 2008, and the ensuing acquisition of its first overseas military in Djibouti in August 2017, his analysis predicting China's \\"permanent military presence\\" in Indian Ocean is viewed by Indian policymakers as prescient. Accordingly, India has since been making moves of various types to counter the perceived threat. The term as a geopolitical concept was first used in an internal US Department of Defense report, \\"Energy Futures in Asia\\" in 2005 .\\"China builds up strategic sea lanes\\" , The Washington Times, Washington, 17 January 2005. Retrieved on 4 May 2013. The term is also widely used in India's geopolitical and foreign policy narratives to highlight India's concerns over massive Chinese Belt and Road Initiative projects across southern Asia. According to the EUISS, the formation of Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (consisting of United States, India, Australia and Japan) is a direct result of China's assertive foreign and security policy in the Indo-Pacific region. The emergence of the String of Pearls is indicative of China's growing geopolitical influence through concerted efforts to increase access to ports and airfields, expand and modernise military forces, and foster stronger diplomatic relationships with trading partners.Pehrson, Christopher J.String of Pearls: Meeting the Challenge of China's Rising Power Across the Asian Littoral. , \\"Carlisle Papers in Security Strategy\\", July 2006.

Although it has been claimed that China's actions are creating a security dilemma between China and India in the Indian Ocean, that has been questioned by some analysts, who point to China's fundamental strategic vulnerabilities.  Terminology  In the theory, a \\"pearl\\" refers to a current or potential Chinese overseas military base, megainfrastructure project, economic corridor, port or other city or locale of Chinese geostrategic advantage in the region. The eponymous \\"string\\" of these pearls refers to the possibility of the Chinese Navy connecting these pearls via maritime routes. Origins In 2004, the U.S. consulting firm Booz Allen Hamilton came up with the \\"string of pearls\\" hypothesis, which posits that China will try to expand its naval presence by building civilian maritime infrastructure along the Indian Ocean periphery. David H. Shinn predicted the same in 2008, predicting that China will need to expand their naval capacities in order to protect supply lines of vital resources from Africa and the Middle East to China.David H. Shinn. \\"Military and Security Relations: China, Africa and the rest of the world.\\" In: Robert I. Rotberg. \\"China into Africa: Aid, trade and influence\\". China's rapid economic development over the course of the last quarter century has been heavily dependent on foreign sources of energy, and it is likely that foreign sources of energy will prove even more critical to the continued growth of the Chinese economy. The sea lines of communication that link the Chinese mainland with ports throughout the Middle East and coasts of Africa have become a major source of conflict with respect to China's energy security. China is the world's largest oil consumer and the largest oil importer. Oil imported from the Gulf States and Africa comprises 70% of total Chinese oil imports, and remains China's most critical source of energy apart from domestic coal burning and nuclear power. To meet future demand, China has signed a number of long-term contracts to develop Iranian oil fields and to build a pipeline, refinery, and port in Sudan for oil export. The oversea transport of oil from existing production areas will continue to remain the primary mode of energy importation for the foreseeable future. Efforts to secure new supply lines in Central Asia have proven difficult, with poor infrastructure, political instability, logistical challenges, and corruption hampering energy development there. Energy security also sits at the core of China's anti- piracy efforts, which figure into its larger maritime objectives. The expansion of Chinese naval patrols off the Coast of Somalia, and China's decision to join multi-nation defence patrols in 2010, indicate China's greater assertiveness in the policing of shipping corridors.\\"China's anti- piracy role off Somalia expands\\". , BBC, 29 January 2010.

However, islets in the regions can also be used as air and sea bases for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities, as well as base points for Chinese ballistic missile submarines and potential aircraft carrier battle groups. The Chinese naval base on Hainan Island is generally considered the first of the pearls or potential pearls. Recent construction of an underwater submarine base on Hainan, in addition to the sprawling facilities already located there, seems to further confirm the perceived importance of Hainan as a base of control for China's claims in the South China Sea. Woody Island, the largest of the Paracel Islands, hosts an upgraded Chinese airstrip and has also been identified as a pearl. Sansha, the prefecture-level city established on Woody Island, maintains a division-level garrison that also oversees Chinese claims in the Spratly Islands, extending a small but permanent military presence across Chinese claims in the South China Sea. A $20 billion Chinese proposal aimed at Thailand to fund the construction of a canal across the Kra Isthmus, which would allow ships to bypass the Strait of Malacca altogether, has also broached concerns of a Chinese-controlled corridor linking Chinese ports and facilities elsewhere in the South China Sea to the Indian Ocean.Sulong, Rini Suryati. 2012. \\"'The Kra Canal and Southeast Asian Relations.\\" , \\"Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs\\", Hamburg, 31 (4): 110-125. = Indian Ocean = Chinese possessions in the Indian Ocean consist primarily of commercial ports owned and operated by Chinese firms, as well as resupply stations operating in agreement with the Chinese central government.

Both sites have raised the concern of neighbouring powers, most significantly India, which fears the possibility of a string of Chinese bases situated just off its coast. Chinese investment in Hambantota, and Sri Lanka's dialogue partner status in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), is seen by some Indian analysts as reflective of a wider encirclement strategy on the part of the Chinese.Joseph, Josy. \\"Delhi entangled in the Dragon's String of Pearls\\" , DNA, New Delhi, 11 May 2009.

The port at Gwadar, which is connected to the Karakoram Highway linking Western China and the Arabian Sea, is of even greater concern to the Indian government, which views it as powerful evidence of Chinese and Pakistani collusion against Indian security and economic interests.Eshel, David. \\"'String of Pearls' is Securing China's Sea Lanes\\". Defense Update, 20 December 2010. = Pakistan = Gwadar Port For both Pakistan and China, the Gwadar port as part of the much-wide China Pakistan Economic Corridor offers a number of key benefits. For the Pakistani government, the Gwadar port is seen as having the potential of hedging against a potential Indian blockade of the port of Karachi, which currently handles 90% of Pakistani seaborne trade. For the Chinese central government, which has funded the majority of the $1.2 billion construction, Gwadar represents an important strategic foothold situated only 240 miles from the Strait of Hormuz. Chinese government officials have specifically identified the growing militarisation of Central Asia, as a chief motivation in the construction of the Gwadar project. In 2013, the state-owned China Overseas Port Holding Company was officially granted control of the port's operation, further consolidating Chinese influence over the Gwadar project.Raza, Syed Irfan.\\"China given contract to operate Gwadar port.\\" , \\"Dawn\\", 19 February 2013.

However, despite reports of Chittagong's potential military role for the Chinese, the Bangladeshi government has insisted that the port is of an entirely commercial nature and declared it off limits to military vessels. Furthermore, given Bangladesh's close economic ties to India, and agreements for the expansion of Indian investment in Bangladeshi infrastructure projects, Chittagong's military significance for the Chinese is exaggerated.Kostecka, Daniel. \\"Hambantota, Chittagong, and the Maldives ‚Äì Unlikely Pearls for the Chinese Navy\\" , China Brief, 19 November 2010.

Reports in the Indian press have referred to Chinese plans to construct a submarine base in Marao since at least 1999. However, to date there exists no evidence that suggests a Chinese military presence of any kind in the Maldives. Indeed, it is argued that Marao cannot possibly support the type of complex infrastructure required for submarine operations. And given the nature of diplomatic and military co- operation between India and the Maldives, Chinese encroachment in the Maldives Archipelago is highly unlikely. Many analysts have suggested that Chinese Indian Ocean bases are purely commercial because they would be nearly indefensible in wartime. A large component of China's efforts to establish ports and bases in the Indian Ocean is the result of a need to formalise logistics support agreements for Chinese naval forces conducting anti-piracy efforts off the Horn of Africa. In this regard, Chinese naval strategy is consistent with the interests of India and its Western allies. Chinese state- owned companies are also responsible for the construction of a railway link between Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, and Port Sudan, the country's major port on the Red Sea.

It describes ambitions for an active Indian naval presence from the Strait of Hormuz to the Strait of Malacca. Furthermore, the doctrine makes explicit mention of the need to police international shipping lanes and control choke points of Indian Ocean trade in particular. In 2007, India opened its second overseas military listening post in northern Madagascar, with the aim of better overseeing shipping movements through the Mozambique Channel. The Indian government has, with the same intentions, hosted negotiations with Mauritania regarding the construction of an airstrip for Indian surveillance aircraft, as well as organised the construction of radar stations in the Maldives. In 2011, the Indian government further announced that it would fund a deep-water port in Sittwe, Burma; set to be functional by June 2013, with an additional highway connecting the port to India to be completed by 2014. The construction of the Sittwe port is often cited as evidence of a concerted strategy on the part of India to counterbalance growing Chinese influence in Southeast Asia.Prakash, Vishnu. \\"India seeks to deepen economic ties with Myanmar\\". , The Times of India, New Delhi, 14 October 2011.

About 89% of India's oil arrives by ship, and the burning of oil provides for approximately 33% of India's energy needs. The protection of the major sea lines of communication is therefore recognised as an economic imperative. In this regard, India has historically focused heavily on anti-piracy and counter-terrorism efforts across the Indian Ocean. Most notable among these is Operation Island Watch, the 2010 effort to patrol India's western seaboard against Somali pirates. Indian Ocean Piracy A number of these counter- terrorism and anti-piracy efforts have been conducted in co-ordination with American forces, though Indian officials have traditionally restricted joint military exercises to common interest initiatives, often those under UN sanction.Kronstadt, Alan K. and Sonia Pinto. \\"India-U.S. Security Relations: Current Engagement\\" , Congressional Research Service, Washington, 13 November 2012. Retrieved on 4 May 2013. Nevertheless, renewed US interest in countering the threat of Islamic terrorism in South Asia has pushed India and the United States towards more substantive military co-operation. For US military officials and strategists, this growing bilateral relationship is widely seen as an opportunity to counterbalance threats of Chinese regional hegemony. Efforts for bilateral co-operation against rising Chinese power are bolstered by popular fears that China's expanded presence in the Indian Ocean threatens India's economic and military security. Dean Cheng, a notable China expert at the Heritage Foundation, has strongly urged that the United States continue to partner with India to counter China's influence in the Indian Ocean.\\"India, US need to partner to balance China in Indian Ocean\\" , The Economic Times, Washington, 2 September 2010.

However, the Chinese central government's explicit ambitions for the creation of a \\"new security concept\\", one that can challenge US dominance in the region, has precipitated a greater willingness on the part of the Chinese to challenge US influence in Asia. China's renewed assertiveness in the South China Sea is of particular concern to US officials, who see China's rise as a threat to the United States' role as a \\"provider of regional and global stability\\". The \\"Pivot to Asia\\" strategy of the Obama Administration is designed to engage China by consolidating and expanding diplomatic and economic relationships with existing regional partners, particularly in East Asia and Southeast Asia. This approach has emphasised multilateralism, as exemplified by increased US engagement with ASEAN and efforts for the formation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a pan-Asian free trade deal.Schiavenza, Matt. \\"What Exactly Does It Mean That the U.S. Is Pivoting to Asia?\\" , The Atlantic, 15 April 2013.

Strong US relations with its key regional allies, including Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, have been reinforced by strengthened co-operation with countries threatened by Chinese control, such as the Philippines. = Japan = Two of the disputed Senkaku islets ‚Äì Kitakojima (left) and Minamikojima(right) Japanese apprehensions regarding the development of an interconnected system of Chinese military and commercial ports centers primarily on the protection of trading interests. 90% of Japan's imported oil flows to Japan through the sea lanes of the South China Sea, and any undue Chinese influence in the region is seen as a potential threat to Japanese economic security. Moreover, Japanese officials envision that, in the case of a more pervasive Chinese power projection capability in East Asia, territorial disputes between China and Japan in the East China Sea and Philippine Sea might escalate to a point of outright military confrontation. In particular, the Senkaku, which is claimed by China but controlled by Japan, and Ryukyu island chains, are identified as key friction points between the two countries. Both island groups are located off of China's eastern seaboard and must be navigated by Chinese naval and commercial vessels sailing on their way to the wider Pacific Ocean. Furthermore, the proximity of both island groups to Taiwan offers them an attractive operational role for Chinese military planners looking to mitigate US naval superiority in any potential war over Taiwan.Sayers, Eric. \\"Japan‚Äôs Area-Denial Strategy.\\", \\"The Diplomat\\", 19 May 2011.

It was located between 165th and 168th Streets on Jamaica Avenue.  History =Early years= 168th Street was part of two Dual Contracts extensions of the BMT Broadway-Jamaica Line east of Cypress Hills and the \\"S-Curve\\" from Fulton Street to Jamaica Avenue. It opened on July 3, 1918, replacing 111th Street as the line's terminus. 168th Street station also replaced the Canal Street Station along the Atlantic Avenue Rapid Transit line (today part of the LIRR Main Line), which closed nineteen years earlier, and supplanted the trolley service on Jamaica Avenue. =Decline and closure= In 1937, the Queens Boulevard Line of the city-owned Independent Subway System was extended to a new terminal at 169th Street and Hillside Avenue, four blocks away. The opening of the IND terminal drew passengers away from the BMT lines. Many groups had called for the removal of the extension in the Jamaica Business district since shortly after it opened, and by the 1960s the city planned to close the station and significant portions of the line in Jamaica. Many merchants credited the line with causing blight and hurting business in the neighborhood. The line was also torn down in preparation for the completion of the Archer Avenue Subway one block south, which would serve the Jamaica Line and a spur of the IND Queens Boulevard Line, and due to political pressure in the area. Construction of that line began in 1972. 168th Street closed at midnight on September 10, 1977, and the elevated structure from 168th Street to Sutphin Boulevard was torn down by 1979. The line was truncated to Queens Boulevard, with the Q49 bus replacing the demolished portion of the line until December 11, 1988. =Current status= In spite of the support of local business owners for the demolition of the line, stores continued to suffer and several establishments closed due to the absence of the El. This included the large Macy's location in the 165th Street Pedestrian Mall near the bus terminal. Unlike the 160th Street and Sutphin Boulevard stations, which were completely demolished in 1979, 168th Street's former control tower, known as the \\"Station and Trainmen's Building\\", still remains standing on the southeast corner of 165th Street and Jamaica Avenue. It sits inactive atop a block of storefronts. The exit stairways for the station were purchased by a private citizen to be used on their estate in Nissequogue on the Long Island Sound. The Archer Avenue Line was completed in 1988, nearly ten years after the closure of the station, but it does not extend east to 168th Street. The closest subway stations to this former station are Jamaica Center‚ÄìParsons/Archer, at Parsons Boulevard and Archer Avenue, which is nine blocks west and one block south, as well as the existing 169th Street station which is four blocks to the north on Hillside Avenue.  Station layout  This elevated station had two tracks and one island platform. It was constructed with a diamond crossover switch west of the station, and a large signal and switch tower built to the south side of the elevated structure at 165th Street. The entrance to the station at this location was built into an alcove of the signal building, which contained storefronts at ground level. Past the crossover, the line expanded to three tracks, with the middle track ending at 160th Street. While reports say the station had a concrete platform, photographs show a wooden platform. It served trains from the BMT Jamaica-Nassau Street Line to Manhattan (the predecessors to today's and trains) and from the BMT Lexington Avenue Line. The station also connected to the nearby 165th Street Bus Terminal (opened in 1936) at 89th Avenue and Merrick Boulevard via an exit on 165th Street.

The history of Hampton Roads dates to 1607, when Jamestown was founded. Two wars have taken place in addition to many other historical events. Colonial era=1607: the English colonists chose Jamestown= The first colonists arrived in 1607 when English Captain Christopher Newport's three ships, his flagship Susan Constant, the smaller Godspeed, and even smaller Discovery landed in April 1607 at Cape Henry along the Atlantic Coast in today's City of Virginia Beach, an event now known as the \\"First Landing.\\" However, they moved on, under orders from the Virginia Company of London, the crews and new colonists sought a more sheltered area up one of the rivers. Their major concern was other European competitors such as the Spanish, who had earlier discovered the Chesapeake Bay and Virginia's rivers, and had even in 1570 begun a small settlement on the Virginia Peninsula known as the Ajac√°n Mission, which had failed. During 18 days of exploring the area, they surely saw the enormous harbor of Hampton Roads, and some of the party must have appreciated its possibilities. However, after exploring the James River west at least as far as present-day Hopewell, they agreed upon Jamestown Island, where they established the first English speaking settlement to survive in the New World on 14 May 1607. The site was deep enough water for ships to dock but was also easily defendable. But despite the defensive advantages of that location against Spanish attacks, the low and marshy site at Jamestown proved a very poor choice in many other ways. More than five years of fragile existence, disease-carrying insects and high mortality rates followed including the Starving Time of 1609-10 when over 80% of the 500 colonists perished before the future of the Virginia Colony began to appear more promising. The change came about with the just-in-time arrival of a new Governor, Lord Delaware, and a new colonist with a successful business idea named John Rolfe. =Values of the harbor: commerce, military control= For centuries, the harbor and rivers of Hampton Roads have been ideal locations for both commerce and for many major shipyards. Some were established as early as the late 17th century such as the Gosport Navy Yard in what is now the City of Portsmouth. The harbor was also a key point for military control of the region. Even the earliest settlers created fortifications at Old Point Comfort by 1610 against potential attacks by ships of Spanish or other unfriendly European forces. =American Revolutionary War= Important conflicts of the American Revolutionary War involved Norfolk and Craney Island (at the mouth of the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth). It was at Norfolk where the last Royal Governor of the Virginia Colony, Lord Dunmore, departed mainland Virginia for the last time. 19th Century=War of 1812= The first naval action of the War of 1812 took place on 8 July 1812, when the Bermuda sloop, HMS Whiting, its crew oblivious to the US declaration of war, lowered anchor in Hampton Roads. As its captain was being rowed ashore, the Royal Naval vessel was seized by the American privateer Dash, which happened to be leaving port. =Federal improvements= Under the new United States government, by the 1830s, the entrance from Chesapeake Bay was defended by Fort Monroe, built by the U.S. Army beginning in 1819 on Old Point Comfort, and by Fort Wool, built as Fort Calhoun in 1829, on a small island called the Rip Raps near the middle of the channel (and now adjacent to one of the manmade islands of the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel). Much work in the building of these fortresses in the early 19th century was done by a 24-year- old engineer in the U.S. Army, a Lieutenant named Robert E. Lee =American Civil War, emancipation and education of former slaves= During the American Civil War (1861-1865), the famous Battle of Hampton Roads between the first American ironclad warships, the USS Monitor and the CSS Virginia (ex-USS Merrimack) took place off Sewell's Point, on March 8‚Äì9, 1862. That battle was inconclusive, but later in 1862, Union forces took control of Hampton Roads, Norfolk, and the lower James River. However, their efforts to take the Confederate capital of Richmond via the James River with their vastly superior Navy were thwarted by a strong Confederate battery position high above a bend in the river about below Richmond at Drewry's Bluff. Fort Monroe was the launching place for Union General George McClellan's massive 1862 Peninsula Campaign, a land campaign of many months which began at Fort Monroe and advanced up the Virginia Peninsula, with a Siege at Yorktown and another battle at Williamsburg before the Union Army almost literally reached the gates of Richmond, ending at the Chickahominy River within earshot of the city's church bells, according to the journals of Union soldiers. However, the Confederates mounted a credible defense of their capital city, and McClellan's campaign failed to capture Richmond, ending in the Seven Days Battles, during which the Union Army withdrew, effectively extending the War for almost three more years. On February 3, 1865, as the Confederacy was near total collapse, President Abraham Lincoln met with three senior Confederates in an effort to negotiate for peace (the \\"Hampton Roads Conference\\"). Lincoln wanted the states to return to the Union and indicated the Union would pay for the slaves. The Confederates insisted their demand was complete independence, so the 4-hour conference ended in failure.See \\"Hampton Roads Conference\\" in Encyclopedia Virginia Beginning in 1861, some of the former slaves found refuge near Fort Monroe, which remained in Union hands throughout the War. There, the commander, Union Army General Benjamin F. Butler, a lawyer by training, declared them to be \\"Contraband of war\\". On that legal basis, Union forces refused to return them to Confederate owners as would have been the practice even in many \\"free states\\" before Virginia seceded and declared itself a foreign power. Soon, word spread, and many slaves were understandably anxious to become \\"contraband.\\" Although many of the \\"contraband\\" men at Hampton and elsewhere during the War volunteered and became part of the United States Colored Troops (USCT), others and the women and children grew in increasing numbers near Fort Monroe in Elizabeth City County. From the wood and materials salvaged from the remains of the Town of Hampton, which had been burned earlier by retreating Confederates, they built the Grand Contraband Camp, near, but outside the protective walls of the Army base. It was the first self-contained African American community in the United States. Close by, was (and still is) the Emancipation Oak, on the grounds of the school for them which grew to become Hampton University. Beginning as a normal school founded to train teachers, Hampton University was established by church groups and former Union Army officers. Early educators of the era included Mary Smith Peake and former Union Army General Samuel Chapman Armstrong, who was himself the son of missionaries, and had commanded a USCT force during the War. Among the earlier students was a young former slave named Booker T. Washington, who became a famed African-American educator and was the first head of present-day Tuskegee University. The Emancipation Oak is part of the official logo of the modern city of Hampton. Twentieth century=Sewell's Point: Jamestown Exposition and a Navy Base= The Jamestown Exposition for the 300th anniversary of the 1607 founding of Jamestown was held at Sewell's Point in a rural section of Norfolk County in 1907. President Theodore Roosevelt arrived by water in the harbor of Hampton Roads, as did other notable persons such as Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers, who both arrived aboard the latter's steam yacht Kanawha. A major naval display was featured, and the U.S. Great White Fleet made an appearance. The leaders of the U.S. Navy apparently did not fail to note the ideal harbor conditions, as was later proved. Beginning in 1917, as the United States became involved in World War I under President Woodrow Wilson, formerly rural Sewell's Point became the site of what grew to become the largest Naval Base in the world which was established by the United States Navy and is now known as the Naval Station Norfolk. =Military use of northern side of the Peninsula= Twice in the 20th century, families of mostly African American heritage were displaced in entire communities when land along the northern side of the Peninsula primarily in York County west of Yorktown was taken in large tracts for military use during World War I and World War II, creating the present-day U.S. Naval Weapons Station Yorktown, which includes Cheatham Annex, and a former Seabee base which became Camp Peary. Communities including \\"the Reservation\\", Halstead's Point, Penniman, Bigler's Mill, and Magruder were all absorbed into the large military bases. Although some left the area entirely, many of the displaced families chose to relocate nearby to Grove, an unincorporated town in southeastern James City County where many generations of some of those families now reside. From a population estimated at only 37 in 1895, Grove had grown to an estimated 1,100 families by the end of the 20th century. (To its north, Grove actually borders the Naval Weapons Station property and on its extreme east, a portion of the U.S. Army's land at Fort Eustis extends across Skiffe's Creek, although there is no direct access to either base). =Colonial Williamsburg= A dream of one Episcopalian priest to save his 18th century church building was to expand to create the world's largest living museum. Replacing Jamestown and the end of the 17th century, Williamsburg had been capital of the Colony and the new State of Virginia from 1699-1780. After the capital moved to Richmond in 1780, Williamsburg became a quieter and sometimes described as \\"sleepy\\" small town. It saw some action during the Battle of Williamsburg of the 1862 Peninsula Campaign during the Civil War. However, it was not located along any major waterway and did not have railroad access until 1881. Perhaps due to the secure inland location originally known as Middle Plantation, for Williamsburg, growth and great expansion of commerce in the 19th century did not occur as rapidly as in many other Virginia cities. The main activities were the College of William and Mary and Eastern State Hospital, each historic institutions in their own right. In addition to the city's historic past, quite a few buildings of antiquity from the 18th century were still extant, although time was taking a toll by the early 20th century. The Reverend Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin of Bruton Parish Church initially had wanted merely to save his historic church building. This he accomplished by 1907. He later served in Rochester, New York for many years. Upon returning to Williamsburg in 1923, he began to realize that many of the other colonial-era buildings also remained, but were in deteriorating condition, and their continued longevity was at risk. Goodwin dreamed of a much larger restoration along the lines of what he had accomplished with his historic church. A cleric of modest means, he sought support and financing from a number of sources before successfully drawing the interests and major financial support of Standard Oil heir and philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and his wife Abby Aldrich Rockefeller. The result of their combined efforts was the creation of Colonial Williamsburg, which included a restoration of the Wren Building at the College of William and Mary and a change of much of the downtown Williamsburg area into a Historic Area of restored and replica buildings and surrounds to celebrate the patriots and the early history of America. By the 1930s, Colonial Williamsburg had become the centerpiece of the Historic Triangle of Colonial Virginia. These were, of course, Jamestown, where the colony started, Williamsburg, and Yorktown, where independence from Great Britain was won. The three points were joined by the U.S. National Park Service's Colonial Parkway, a remarkable accomplishment built over a period of 27 years. The Historic Triangle area of the Hampton Roads region became one of the largest tourist attractions in the entire world. In Dr. Goodwin's words: \\"Williamsburg is Jamestown continued, and Yorktown is Williamsburg vindicated.\\" =Other notable Hampton Roads \\"firsts\\"= In 1957, the Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel was the first bridge- tunnel complex in the world, to be followed by the area's much longer Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel in 1963. In the 1960s, the first astronauts of Project Mercury trained at the NASA facility adjacent to Hampton's Langley Air Force Base. Local features including Mercury Boulevard commemorate this fact. Defunct shires, counties, cities, towns As the current communities in the Hampton Roads region were formed and grew from the Colonial period to statehood and modern times, the political structure of many areas in Virginia changed. Between 1952 and 1976, a wave of consolidations of local governments led to almost the entire southeastern portion of Virginia consisting of a group of adjoining independent cities, eventually numbering eight. Joining the seven major cities of Hampton Roads was the comparatively tiny City of Poquoson, which had formerly been an incorporated town in York County). Many incorporated (formally constituted) localities became legally defunct, though mostly not abandoned by their citizens, with the notable exception of Jamestown. For search of genealogical, land, and other historical records, it may be necessary to find these old names. The following is a partial listing of defunct political subdivisions in the Hampton Roads area with approximate formation and dissolution dates.

Setting The story takes place in Cenaria City, the capital of the Kingdom of Cenaria. Cenaria is on a fictional continent called Midcyru. It begins in the city's lawless slum sector, known as the Warrens, then expands to the East Side, home to the middle and upper classes. Cenaria is a monarchy, with a king and dynastic succession. Behind the throne however is a mysterious criminal council, the Sa'Kage (Lords of the Shadows), controlling criminal activity and trade while manipulating the king and the succession through extortion and assassination. Cenaria is a politically and militarily insignificant country. To its north lies the aggressive, brutal land of Khalidor with its tyrannical Godking, and to the south is the wealthier Ceura. Cenaria has remained independent of Khalidor because of its poverty and problematic geography, but there is constant intrigue. Plot summary Azoth is an orphan who lives in the Warrens of Cenaria City. He and his two friends, Jarl and 'Doll Girl', are members of the Black Dragon Guild. They make their living stealing money to buy food and pay their guild dues to Rat, the Guild Fist, an enforcer who beats or rapes anyone who doesn't pay. One night, Azoth overhears a confrontation between Durzo Blint, the best wetboy (magically endowed and highly trained assassins) in the city, and several unknown assailants. After Durzo slaughters the assassins, he catches the escaping Azoth and tells him to not say a word about what he has seen to anyone. Jarl gives Azoth money that he'd saved so that he can be Durzo Blint's apprentice. Azoth follows Durzo after an ambush during a contract at the Black Dragon's guild to present his offer for apprenticeship. Durzo declines his offer and disappears. Rat beats and rapes Jarl which prompts Azoth to rally other members of the guild to stand up to him. Azoth encounters Durzo again and threatens to kill him unless he apprentices him. Durzo agrees on the condition that Azoth kill Rat by the end of the week. Before Azoth can kill Rat, Rat kidnaps and beats Doll Girl, leaving her with ugly scars all over her face. Durzo finds Doll Girl, and Azoth pleads with him to save her. Durzo agrees and Azoth sets out to kill Rat. Azoth kills Rat and cuts off his ear as proof to take back to Durzo, who has followed through and saved Doll Girl's life. Elsewhere in Cenaria, eleven-year-old Logan Gyre watches his father, Duke Regnus Gyre, as he prepares to travel to a garrison called Screaming Winds on Cenaria's border with Khalidor. Logan asks to go with his father, but Duke Gyre refuses and leaves his son as the Lord of House Gyre. A traveling mage from the Empire of Sethi, Solon Tofusin, arrives at the Gyre estate. He is on a mission from the prophet Dorian to help Lord Gyre. When he finds out Duke Gyre has gone to Screaming Winds, he plans to head there immediately, but his plans are disrupted when he finds out that Logan has also been named Lord Gyre. Logan forces him to spar, and Solon humiliates him. He tells him that Logan's soldiers have been losing to him on purpose, which infuriates Logan. He tells his men to treat him as no more than an equal; he is soon going to join his father at Screaming Winds, and if they truly love him, they should be preparing him for the battles there. He apologizes to Solon, who is impressed with Logan and decides to stay with him for now. Solon offends Logan's mother and she tries to send him away, but Logan reminds her he is now Lord Gyre and sends her away instead. Solon is even more impressed with Logan, and becomes less certain that Duke Gyre is the one he must serve. Azoth begins his training with Durzo, which carries on for several years. As well as his wetboy training, Azoth learns to read from Gwinvere Kirena (Momma K as she is more widely known), a member of the Sa'kage who manages the brothels in Cenaria City who is also the older sister to Durzo's deceased former lover, Vonda. From her, Azoth learns that Durzo allowed Vonda to die at the hands of the Khalidorans in order to keep a ka'kari, an ancient item that grants immense magical power, from Garoth Ursuul, the so-called Godking of Khalidor. Azoth excels in his training but is unable to awaken his \\"talent,\\" his magical ability and is forced to leave his lodgings at Durzo's hideout after Brant Agon, the chief general to Cenaria's king, attempts to blackmail Durzo into the king's service. He is sent to live with Count Rimbold Drake, who is to give him a new name, Kylar Stern, and teach him to behave in noble society. During this time, Kylar and Logan become acquainted and soon become fast friends. During this time, Jarl also comes under Momma K's protection, becoming her right hand man in operating Cenaria City's brothels. Much later while fighting disguised on behalf of the Sa'Kage in a tourney, Kylar encounters a former sister of the Chantry, an all-female organization of mages, who tells him that the reason he can't awaken his Talent (his magical ability) is that he has no \\"conduit\\" to let it out, although in fact the power for magic in him (his glore vyrden) is enormous. Durzo seeks a way for Kylar to be able to use his Talent. With the rumored silver kakari supposedly close, Kylar is told to get into a party hosted by a powerful noble in order to steal it. Later on, Kylar encounters Dorian who tells Kylar to \\"ask Momma K\\" and that \\"a square vase will give you hope.\\" Momma K had tells him that she has someone who may be able to get him in. When he goes to visit this person, it turns out to be Elene, A.K.A. Doll Girl. After Durzo saved her, Kylar had asked Count Drake to give her a good home, after which she was adopted by the Cromwell family. Kylar has since acted as her patron, sending money and occasionally checking up on her in secret. Despite a tearful and loving reunion, she denies him an invitation due to her obligations as a servant. Kylar finds another way in and starts a fight with Logan (at Logan's bidding to impress Count Drake's eldest daughter whom Logan wishes to marry, but whom loves Kylar) as a distraction so he can look around. Around this time, a former member of the Black Dragons named Roth has begun to rise in prominence among the Sa'kage. During a meeting with Momma K, he threatens her with information that he has her daughter, Ulyssandra (nicknamed Uly), and thus coerces her into doing his bidding. At the same time, Durzo, who believes Uly to be his daughter by Vonda, takes this information from Momma K in a vicious argument. This embitters her against Durzo while he is unaware that Uly is in fact Momma K's daughter by him (conceived during a drug-addled fling with her many years prior) Kylar comes to the conclusion that Elene must have the kakari. He goes to her room where he finds the kakari and ends up knocking Elene out to save himself from having to kill her. Durzo finds him in her room and they find out that the silver kakari is a fake. However, Kylar instead ends up with the black kakari, the original ka'kari which was believed to be a myth, which he unknowingly steals from Durzo. The heir to the throne, Prince Aleine, is killed that night by the hostess, Lady Jadwin, who is in the service of Khalidor while a wetboy named Hu Gibbet, Durzo's sadistic rival, also kills most of the Gyre household, including Logan's mother, leaving Regnus, recently returned from the border, to discover the massacre. Logan is blamed for the murder of Prince Aleine and is taken into custody, but is soon released by the Queen, his mother's older sister from the powerful Graesin family and his father's former betrothed. She convinces him to marry her daughter, Jenine, both as part of his bail condition, but also to preserve the family of the man she loved and to protect Cenaria from Khalidor. The King then publicly, while in a fit of drunkenness, announces the marriage between Jenine and Logan to secure the line of succession and an heir in case of his own death. During the ceremony Durzo, who is working for Roth, now revealed to be a son of Garoth Ursuul, in order to preserve his daughter, poisons almost everyone in the King's court. During this time Roth and Neph Dada, a high ranking Khalidoran vurdmeister (users of the parasitic magic known as the vir) attack the castle in a coup, during which Regnus, the Queen and her children are all killed. Khalidorans arrive by sea with vurdmeisters but Kylar slows down the process by burning some ships and killing a number of the elite Khalidoran highlanders. Amidst the panic, General Agon beheads the king so that the remaining knights will focus on saving the new king, Logan, who is in his bed chambers preparing to consummate his marriage to Jenine. However, Roth kills the knights and forces his way into Logan's room. Roth apparently kills Jenine, but Neph secretly preserves her for the Godking, who is on his way. Roth then orders Logan to be castrated and fed to the holers, the lowest members of the massive Cenarian gaol known as the Maw. Jarl has hired a guard to save Logan from being killed, but this fails so to save his life, Logan takes a knife and jumps into the hole of cannibalistic prisoners. Durzo is forced to fight Kylar so that he can unbind the Black Kakari and give it to Roth to save his daughter. Kylar bests him in the end and Durzo's dying wish is for Kylar to save his daughter, along with an apology for all he has done wrong. Following the fight, Kylar fully takes on the mantle of the Night Angel, the avatar of justice, mercy and retribution, a role formerly held by Durzo who is revealed to be Acaelus Thorne, a legendary hero from Midcyru's past. Along with the ka'kari, Kylar also takes Durzo's magical sword, Retribution, and sets off to save Logan. Kylar, as the Night Angel, helps release some prisoners from the Maw while rescuing Elene and Uly who had been captured and tells them to rebel. After hearing of Logan's location, he heads to the bedchamber where he finds nothing but blood and thus believes Logan has been killed. Kylar later poisons Momma K, but also grants her the antidote out of mercy then comes face to face with Roth who is surrounded by vurdmeisters. Roth reveals himself as Rat, who had survived the earlier attempt on his life. Solon arrives outside with Curoch, the ancient magical sword that once belonged to Midcyru's first emperor, Jorsin Alkestes, and uses it to slay a large group of vurdmeisters. Kylar kills all of Roth's guard and eventually Roth himself, but dies himself. While in the state of death, Kylar meets a mysterious figure known as the Wolf and is given the choice of an immortal life as the Night Angel or death in either heaven or hell. He chooses Elene and life and is revived. Kylar and Elene make up and decide to try for a life together along with Uly whom they adopt. While Roth was killed, his army successfully took over the castle and the city, allowing his father to conquer Cenaria, forcing Kylar, Elene and Uly to leave the country.

H√ºseyin fled abroad but was arrested by the Dutch police in 1995 and served a sentence. By 1998, the Bayba≈üins were making millions from exporting heroin to Europe. His elder brother Abdullah Bayba≈üin, also a drug lord, immigrated to the United Kingdom and set up his business in North London, while H√ºseyin chose the Dutch metropole Amsterdam for his base. Some sources described Huseyin as \\"Europe's Pablo Escobar\\".  Life sentence  On 27 March 1998 H√ºseyin was arrested in a villa in Lieshout along with his nephew Gƒ±yasettin Bayba≈üin following a joint operation carried out by the British, Italian, Belgian, German and Dutch police. He was initially placed in an ordinary detention facility in Rotterdam. On 26 June 1998 it was decided to detain him in a pre-trial detention unit of maximum security in Vught. His incarceration in the Vught Prison was extended several times. H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin and Gƒ±yasettin were tried and found guilty on 10 February 2001 on charges of conspiracy to murder, kidnapping and drug smuggling. Ton Derksen, a Dutch professor emeritus, got access to the telephone recordings which were presented as evidence. According to him, the telephone recordings were manipulated. H√ºseyin was convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison, increased to a life sentence in July 2002, while Gƒ±yasettin received a sentence of eleven years in prison. Abdullah Bayba≈üin was also convicted in 2002 and jailed in the United Kingdom. On 24 December 2003 H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin was transferred to another prison with a different regime. On 23 March 2004 a psychiatric report found that Bayba≈üin had developed various mental problems including chronic post- traumatic stress disorder, depression and a strong tendency towards somatisation during his detention in the maximum security prison. In the same period, the State Security Court (DGM) in Istanbul tried 21 Turkish people, among them in absentia H√ºseyin and Gƒ±yasettin Bayba≈üƒ±n, imprisoned in the Netherlands, and Nizamettin Bayba≈üin, convicted for fifteen years in prison in Germany, for setting up a criminal organization and exporting illicit drugs. The court concluded the apprehension of those accused. H√ºseyin is believed to have retained most of his vast wealth, which he invested in tourist resorts along the Mediterranean and Aegean coasts.  Kƒ±smetim-1 incident  The ocean freighter MV Kƒ±smetim-1 was intercepted end of 1992 by the Turkish police in Mediterranean, suspected of smuggling about morphine base, worth millions of dollars. The ship was scuttled by the crew during the operation. It was claimed that the drug belonged to a consortium of the ship's owner Osman Ayanoƒülu and his partners including ≈ûeyhmus Da≈ü and H√ºseyin Bayba≈üin, all Kurdish drug lords. Most of the known drug lords are smuggling through Northern Iraq. Turkish authorities claimed that the PKK also involved in this smuggling, which European authorities denied.  Review of life sentence at Supreme Court of the Netherlands  H√ºseyin filed for review of his life sentence at the Supreme Court of the Netherlands. On 17 April 2018 the court rejected his request stating that there were no new facts or developments warranting a review.

He is known for reconstructing the Rila Monastery, Bulgaria's largest monastery, in 1334‚Äì1335. Life Ohmuƒáeviƒá coat of arms according to the \\"Illyrian Armorials\\" Hrelja's 1334 inscription on the tower in the Rila Monastery Hrelja was first mentioned in the 1320s as the commander of a Serbian military detachment involved in that time's Byzantine civil war. With his detachment, Hrelja assisted Byzantine Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos. By that time, Hrelja was already the ruler of a large domain in the region of ≈†tip (in today's North Macedonia) and east of the city; in the early 1330s, his domain expanded to include Strumica. In 1334‚Äì1335, Hrelja reconstructed the church of the Rila Monastery and built the so-called Hrelja's Tower, the monastery's defensive tower and its oldest structure surviving today. The stone tower is high and has an almost square foundation. There are five stories, not counting the cellar, with a chapel devoted to the Transfiguration of Christ on the top floor; the chapel features fragments of 14th-century frescoes. The tower has a single entrance on the first floor, at the time probably reached through a ladder; from the entrance, the chapel can be accessed using the stone stairs built into the walls. It is thought that Hrelja's Tower was used as a protection for the monks, as well as a cache for valuables, a jail or a place to isolate mentally-ill people. A two-storey belfry was attached to the tower in 1844. Since 1983, the tower has been under UNESCO protection as part of the Rila Monastery, a World Heritage Site. The inscription on the tower testifies that by the time of its construction Hrelja still acknowledged Serbian suzerainty: Hrelja donated real estate in the valley of Strumica to the Hilandar monastery, another fact testifying to his economic power; Hrelja also sponsored the construction of the Church of St Michael in ≈†tip. In the late 1330s, Hrelja broke away from Serbia and became an autocrat with his capital at Strumica; he formally recognized Byzantine authority, but had vast political autonomy. Factors that contributed to Hrelja's decision to break away from the Serbian realm included his economic independence, his own armed forces and the frontier location of his estate, bordering the Second Bulgarian Empire and the Byzantine Empire to the northeast, south and southeast. With another Byzantine civil war in the early 1340s, Hrelja was sought as an ally by both sides. Hrelja supported John VI Kantakouzenos, who awarded him the city of Melnik and the title of pr≈çtosebastos. However, Hrelja did not actively engage in the conflict and pursued his own interests. After Kantakouzenos suffered some heavy losses in the civil war and retreated to Stefan Du≈°an's court in the summer of 1342, he agreed to sacrifice his ally in return for Serbian support. Although Hrelja once again recognized Du≈°an's suzerainty and ceded the city of Melnik, he died on 27 December 1342 in the Rila Monastery. According to Bulgarian sources, He is said to have been killed by Serb mercenaries, hired by Emperor Stefan Du≈°an.Encyclopedia of Kyustendil, 1988, Sofia, Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, p.682 Shortly prior to his death Hrelja had become a monk in the monastery under the name of Hariton. He was buried in the church he had reconstructed in the Rila Monastery. His epitaph testifies that he was awarded the title of caesar, most likely by John VI. In Bulgarian and Serbian epic folklore, Hrelja (Relja Krilatica) is glorified as an ally of Prince Marko and a protector of the people against the Ottoman Turks.

Its population was 27 as of the 2010 census. Snively Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979.  History  Located in southeastern Washington County Maryland, Eakle's Mill is a remnant of a typical 19th century rural farm community. Originally surrounded by farms and orchards, which provided abundant jobs during the manual labor era prior to mechanization, Eakle's Mill as other similar sites, became a thriving village. Originating on the lands of Conrad Snivley and Andrew Putman who arrived in the area during the influx of (mostly) German immigrants in the 1760s, the community is on the road originally leading from Pleasant Valley and Crampton's Gap. Putman purchased a property named ‚ÄúPartnership‚Äù from Josiah Chapline, who was disposing of the lands of his late father Moses Chapline who was the original settler in the 1740s. Putman added to his lands, which after his death were bought by son in-law Christian Wyandt. The village gained prominence in the 1870s with the construction of the Hagerstown branch of the B&O; Railroad. Jeremiah Snyder founded a Sunday school in the schoolhouse in 1877, which spawned the Eakle's Mill United Brethren Church in 1887. Located some distance behind the (abandoned) church and not associated with it is the Keedy family graveyard. Several generations of this locally prominent family including patriarch Johann Heinrich Gueding are buried in the cemetery. Early AME Church circuit riding minister Thomas Henry used the Jacob Snivley farm at Eakle's Mill as his base of operations for several years during the 1850s and speaks highly of Mr. & Mrs Snivley's hospitality towards him. The United Brethren in Christ, of which the Snivley's were members, was the overwhelmingly dominant religion locally. A sect that was philosophically opposed to slavery and so, is thought to be a contributing factor enabling the sizable free African American population living in the surrounding area decades prior to the civil war. Once home to a mill, store, school and church, no public entities remain in the village. The railroad ceased operation in the 1970s.

Samples Manor is an unincorporated community in Washington County, Maryland, United States. The Kennedy Farm was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973.  History  Restored Kennedy Farmhouse in 2018. On October 1, 1764 a patent was approved for 10,160 ¬º acres in extreme southern Washington County, (then Frederick County) Maryland for a prominent businessman named John Semple of Charles County. Such large properties were categorized as manors in colonial Maryland, with their own unique laws. The tract was named Keep Treist by Semple, but took on the popular name of Semple's Manor, which became ‚ÄúSample‚Äôs Manor.‚ÄùMSA S1197-46 (Maryland Archives) John Semple was an innovator in colonial America with unique vision and goals. He was not attentive to his financial affairs, however, and within a decade of acquiring Keep Treist, John Semple was bankrupt. Most of Keep Treist would be acquired by the Frederick Forge, later to become the Antietam Iron Works. By the mid-19th century much of the forest had been harvested and converted to charcoal to fuel the iron works. The cleared land was then sold for farms and lots. These land sales increased after the unexpected death of Iron Works owner John Brein in 1849. The most famous resident of Sample's Manor would only live there for four months in 1859 at the nearby Kennedy Farm. The abolitionist John Brown and his cadre of followers would make history on October 16, 1859 with their raid on the U.S. Armory, three miles away at Harper's Ferry. The Sample's Manor Church of God is thought to have originated circa 1850. The cemetery holds generations of ancestors to many who live nearby yet today.

Each grammar works on a string, a so-called sequential form that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of agents in artificial intelligence. Let mathbb{A} be a simple reactive agent moving on the table and trying not to fall down from the table with two reactions, t for turning and ∆í for moving forward. The set of possible behaviors of mathbb{A} can then be described as formal language : mathbb{L_A}={(f^mt^nf^r)^+:1leq mleq k; 1leq nleq ell;1leq rleq k}, where ∆í can be done maximally k times and t can be done maximally ‚Ñì times considering the dimensions of the table. System of grammars sequentially rewriting shared string w Let mathbb{G_A} be a formal grammar which generates language mathbb{L_A}. The behavior of mathbb{A} is then described by this grammar. Suppose the mathbb{A} has a subsumption architecture; each component of this architecture can be then represented as a formal grammar too and the final behavior of the agent is then described by this system of grammars. The schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent. If grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a Cooperating Distributed (DC) grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in AI, which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard. Each grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a Parallel Communicating (PC) grammar system. PC and DC are inspired by distributed AI. If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called colonies or Eco-Grammar systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).

The area is known in environmental politics and native lore as the Sacred Headwaters or Kablona. The project is the source of controversy and is opposed by First Nations groups and non-governmental organizations. If developed, the project will include a network of gas wells connected by roads and pipelines, as well as a pipeline to deliver the gas to market. The British Columbia Ministry of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources estimates that the Klappan coal deposit could contain as much as of coalbed methane gas.A Summary of Coalbed Methane Potential in British Columbia, Barry Ryan, BC Ministry of Energy and Mines, British Columbia (no date). History=2004-2005= In 2004, the government of British Columbia granted Shell Canada a 400,000 hectare (4,000 km2) tenure of land for coalbed methane development. In June 2004, Shell signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Tahltan Central Council, the Chief of the Tahltan Band and the Chief of the Iskut First Nation, for coalbed methane development of the Klappan Coalbed Methane Project. In the winter of 2004, Shell drilleds three exploration wells, and detected the presence of coalbed methane gas. The company also conducted a seismic survey over an stretch of existing railway bed. Opposition=2006= Shell canceled its 2006 drilling program in response to opposition from First Nations groups. In April 2007, Royal Dutch Shell acquired Shell Canada making it a wholly owned subsidiary. Tahltan elders from Iskut and Telegraph Creek blockaded Shell's road access to the area. Shell would unsuccessfully seek a court injunction that would allow them to have the Royal Canadian Mounted Police arrest the blockaders. Shell's crews manage to access the area and begin road repairs. =2007= On July 27, 2007, a group of 13 environmental non-governmental organizations wrote a letter to Shell's executives in the Hague, urging them to suspend drilling plans in the Sacred Headwaters. Signatories to the letter include Natural Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth International, ForestEthics, Sierra Club, and the David Suzuki Foundation. On August 31, 2007, Rallies were held across British Columbia, including one outside the Vancouver Courthouse where Tahltan blockaders and Shell were scheduled to appear at an injunction hearing with David Suzuki speaking at the rally.

After its dissolution in 1803 the buildings were used for the almshouse Vereinigtes Katharinen- und Elisabethen-Spital, which is still there as a retirement home. The former abbey church remains in use as the Michaelskirche. The buildings are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site \\"Town of Bamberg\\". As of 2016 and for the foreseeable future, the church is closed for repairs. Location The abbey gave its name to the Michaelsberg, one of the hills of Bamberg, overlooking the town. With Bamberg Cathedral and the monasteries of St. Stephan and St. Gangolf it formed part of a T-shaped cross in Bamberg's topography. The hill is the most prominent spur of the Steigerwald in the municipal area and with its steep eastern decline towards the Regnitz is significantly higher than the Domberg. This contributes to the dominant effect of the abbey buildings. History=Establishment of the abbey The hill was inhabited before the abbey was founded. Excavations have uncovered massive walls and a moat from the 10th century. After the creation of the Bishopric of Bamberg by King (and later Emperor) Heinrich II (Henry II), the first Bishop of Bamberg, , founded the abbey in 1015 as the bishop's private monastery. Accordingly the abbot answered directly and exclusively to the bishop of Bamberg. The monks for the new establishment were drawn from Amorbach Abbey and Fulda Abbey. History in the Middle Ages Heinrich supported the abbey with rich gifts, including properties. Three books with which the abbey was initially endowed are still in the Staatsbibliothek Bamberg. The abbey followed the Hirsau Reforms, which also resulted in the building of a new church. The chronicler and author Frutolf of Michelsberg was prior here until his death in 1103. The abbey flourished under Bishop Otto (d. 1139), whose burial in the abbey church and subsequent canonisation in 1189, together with the papal protection granted to the abbey in 1251, was of enormous advantage in increasing the independence of the abbey from the bishops. Under abbot Wolfram (d. 1123), appointed by Otto, the number of monks on the Michaelsberg reached its all-time high of 70 (from 20 under his predecessor). The award to the abbots of the pontificalia had taken place some time before 1185. After Otto's canonization he became a patron of the abbey, together with St. Michael. Until the 18th century, the abbey continued to fight the Hochstift in various legal battles, trying to achieve the status of Imperial Abbey. A document from Heinrich (dated 1017) states that Eberhard had founded the abbey, and that it was a private or proprietary abbey. However, from the 12th century on, the abbey's chroniclers tried to label Heinrich (and later also his wife Kunigunde) as the true founder(s), in order to reduce the influence of the bishop. The abbey's financial status rested securely upon its great ownership of lands in the bishopric, eventually extending to 441 towns and villages. It became one of the culturally most important Benedictine abbeys in southern Germany, with its scriptorium being especially famed. Modern history A decline set in around 1420, resulting in reform attempts. In 1430, the Hussites sacked the abbey. In 1435, the abbey came into conflict with the townspeople of Bamberg and was plundered. In 1446 the abbey's debt had grown so large, that the bishop, Anton von Rotenhan (1431-59) deposed the abbot Johannes I. Fuchs and took control of the abbey directly. A thorough reform only came under bishop Georg I. von Schaumberg (1459-75), who appointed Eberhard von Venlo (died 1475) as abbot in 1463. He had come with some other monks from the monastery of St. Jakob near Mainz, a member of the Bursfelde Congregation. Michaelsberg joined this reform movement in 1467. Building activity surged: the guest house was built and the dormitory expanded. Changes were also made to the church. Abbot Andreas Lang (died 1503) had an inventory of all the abbey's possessions created and the abbey flourished under his rule. The abbey once again suffered during the German Peasants' War of 1525, and during the Franconian Margrave War (Markgr√§flerkrieg) in 1553. A period of recovery followed under abbot Veit I. Finger (died 1585). In the Thirty Years' War the abbey was occupied for several years by the Swedish army. In the 17th and 18th centuries the abbey recovered, and enjoyed a new period of prosperity in the early 18th century, notably under abbot Christoph Ernst von Guttenberg (died 1725). He managed to restore the abbey to sound financial health, laying the groundwork for the building that followed. Michaelsberg was in competition with both other abbeys that were being rebuilt in Baroque style (Langheim Abbey from 1681, Ebrach Abbey from 1687 and Banz Abbey from 1697) and the bishop who in 1695 had begun to expand his residence on the opposite hill. The agricultural buildings (Wirtschaftsgeb√§ude) were added in several waves: after 1696 by Leonhard Dientzenhofer and from 1708 by his brother Johann. These significantly increased the size of the abbey and gave it its fortress-like look. Abbot Anselm Geisendorfer came into confrontation with his bishop, Friedrich Karl von Sch√∂nborn and after additional conflict with his monks left the abbey in June 1740. In 1743 he was deposed. However, besides his work on the church (see below), Anselm was able to start a rebuilding of the Wirtschaftsgeb√§ude, to which Balthasar Neumann contributed after 1742 and which his successor as abbot, Ludwig Dietz (died 1759), finished in 1744. In terms of construction, Ludwig and his successor, Gallus Brockard (died 1799), mostly focused on the park created on the terraces around the abbey. In the latter half of the 18th century, the financial situation of the abbey had deteriorated significantly as a result of mismanagement, the Seven Years' War and then the French Revolutionary Wars. Attempts at reform by the final abbot, Cajetan Rost (died 1804), were cut short by the abbey's dissolution. Dissolution of the abbey By the time of the secularisation of Bavaria of 1802 the abbey still owned substantial property in Bamberg itself as well as estates in no fewer than 141 places in the surrounding area. On 30 November 1802 Bavarian troops confiscated the abbey's assets. Valuable books were removed to the library of the Bavarian court, the predecessor of the present Bayerische Staatsbibliothek. Even before that seizure, in September 1802, the Bavarian government followed a suggestion by Friedrich Adalbert Marcus, the head of the hospital Vereinigtes Katharinen- und Elisabethenspital (St. Katharina and St. Elisabeth), to transfer the institution to the hill from the town centre, preventing the abbey buildings from being demolished. On 13 April 1803 the abbey was dissolved. The 21 monks then resident were obliged to leave. In 1808, the hospital became the formal owner of the buildings, but in 1817 the town took over. The abbey still houses the municipal retirement home B√ºrgerspital. From 1880 until 2002, facility management of the hospital was assigned to the ' Description View of Michaelsberg from the Rose Garden of the New Residence Sketch plan of the abbey precinct Due to its exposed location on top of the hill, the former abbey buildings are visible from many places in Bamberg. The structures enhance the impact on the viewer by their bulk. The Wirtschaftsgeb√§ude and living quarters built during the Baroque period from massive sandstone surround the substantial two-spired church. In turn they are enveloped by the terrace gardens which surround the abbey on three sides. The palace-like three-storied main wing faces north, towards the Main. Abbey church Nave of the former abbey church Gothic tomb of St. Otto in the crypt The first church on the site, dedicated to Saint Michael, was built from about 1015 and was consecrated on 2 November 1021 by Eberhard, in the presence of the archbishops Aribo and Pilgrim, Emperor Heinrich and a large share of the rulers of the Holy Roman Empire, both secular and ecclesial. Not much is known about the size and structure of the initial buildings. An earthquake on 3 January 1117 apparently only slightly damaged the church, but Bishop Otto had the whole building (and the monastery) torn down and rebuilt on a larger scale by one Richolf, in accordance with the architectural concepts of the Hirsau Reforms. The new (and current) building, basically a Romanesque church, was consecrated on 1 September 1121. After his death Bishop Otto was buried on 3 July 1139 in a tomb in the nave, in front of the altar dedicated to St. Michael. In 1287/8 a polychrome sculpture was created as a tomb figure, showing Otto with pallium, mitre, staff and book. Today it stands against the wall of the crypt. The current tomb was made (also polychrome) around 1435/40. On 27 April 1610, work on the roof resulted in a fire which destroyed all the roofs and the nave, but the tomb of Otto was virtually unaffected. Under abbot Johann V. M√ºller (died 1627) the rebuilding in Renaissance style started immediately. By October, the choir had a new roof and by 1614 the westworks with the two repaired towers had been finished. Reconstruction of the nave followed, and its ceiling was painted with the Garden of Heaven; bells, organ and choir stalls were bought. The new church was consecrated in 1617. The Neoclassical Holy Sepulchre Rococo pulpit The still-extant organ-loft was also constructed very soon after the fire, in 1610, and is a significant work of German late Renaissance art. From 1696 Leonhard Dientzenhofer, under the instructions of abbot Christoph Ernst von Guttenberg, created a two-storey Baroque exterior fa√ßade. It was finished by August 1700. The large exterior stairway followed in 1722/3. Johann Dientzenhofer built the terrace and the high choir after 1725, under abbot Anselm Geisendorfer. This created the crypt in which the tomb of Saint Otto is situated today. To the left and right of the choir, the Romanesque apses were replaced by two-storied structures. Under Anselm the church interior was mostly replaced: a new high altar, two choir stalls, an altar was added to the crossing and two to the transepts. Six altars were added to the side-aisles and three galleries were built. Under his rule the church largely took on its current appearance. A replica Holy Sepulchre in a side chapel that already reflects early Neoclassical style was also ordered by Anselm. Georg Adam Reu√ü later made the pulpit in Rococo style, the final important piece of art added to the abbey church. In 1833, the colorful painting of fa√ßade and statuary on the stair was removed and in 1837 on the orders of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, ten gravestones and memorials of the bishops of Bamberg from the 16th to the 18th century were removed from Bamberg Cathedral and set up in the Michaelskirche, as described in a guidebook of 1912:Schreiber and Ament, Bamberg-Reisef√ºhrer, Speyer 1912 :\\"An entirely alien component of the church furnishings consists of those episcopal gravestones which Ludwig I ordered to be removed from the cathedral during its restoration, as stylistically inappropriate, and which were set up in the Michelskirche instead.\\"\\"Ein ganz fremder Bestandteil der Kirchenausstattung sind jene f√ºrstbisch√∂flichen Grabdenkm√§ler, welche auf Anordnung K√∂nig Ludwigs I. bei der Restauration des Domes als nicht stilgem√§√ü aus diesem entfernt und in die Michelskirche versetzt wurden:\\" In 1886, , Domvikar at Regensburg Cathedral developed a plan for \\"purifying\\" the interior of the church, but the replacement of the Baroque style elements with Romanesque Revival and the painting over of the botanical ceiling frescoes were prevented by popular protests and the intervention of , Domkapitular at Mainz Cathedral. In 1952, the interior of the church was renovated. Work on the towers followed in 1985-7 and on the Holy Sepulchre 1985-96. In 2002, repair work on all the church roofs was completed. Today The former abbey church of Saint Michael is now an ancillary church to the cathedral. Since 1993, the area has been part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The church, gardens and areas not used by the Spital used to be open to the public. However, due to structural integrity issues, the church has been closed since 2012. Work on what is expected to be a ‚Ç¨50 million restoration began in the spring of 2016. This is expected to be finished in 2021 at the earliest.

The palace was in active use till the early 1970s. History and architecture Deeg was the capital of the Jat kings before they shifted to Bharatpur. Badan Singh, who came to the throne in 1721, built a palace here. Due to its strategic location and proximity to Agra, Deeg had to face repeated attacks by invaders. His son, prince Suraj Mal, began the construction of a fortress around the palace around 1730. The fort had massive walls and a deep moat to keep away raiders. Deeg was a site of a legendary battle between the Jats and a combined Mughal and Maratha army of 8,000 men. Emboldened by his victory, Suraj Mal began making forays into enemy territory. After eight years of success in his forays, Suraj Mal captured Delhi and plundered the Red Fort carrying away masses of valuables including an entire marble building, which was dismantled and numbered. The palace was then reconstructed at Deeg. The Jat rulers were influenced by the magnificence of the Mughal courts of Agra and Delhi. The design of the gardens has been inspired by the Mughal Charbagh. The palace forms a quadrangle with a garden and walkways at its centre. Decorative flowerbeds, shrubs, trees and fountains cool the place considerably during summer. Two huge water tanks, Gopal Sagar and Rup Sagar, on either side also helped to bring down the temperature. Keshav Bhawan, the monsoon pavilion, is a single-storeyed baradari placed on an octagonal base. It stands next to the Rup Sagar tank. The edifice has five arches along each side which seem to divide it in to parts. An arcade runs around the interior of the pavilion over a canal with hundreds of fountains. The walls of the canal are pierced with hundreds of minute water jets. Bullocks were employed with large leather \\"buckets\\" to draw water to the tank through a complex pulley system. In festivals such as Holi, colours are added to the water. Small cloth pouches with organic colours were manually inserted into the holes in the reservoir wall. When the water flowed through them passing along an intricate network of pipelines, the fountains spouted coloured water. The fountain spray and the jets create a monsoon-like ambience that is enhanced by a unique technique that produces thunder-like sound all around the pavilion. Hundreds of metal balls placed strategically on the channel surrounding the roof are set rolling with the water pressure which results in a thunderous effect. The ambience in a desert town must have been significant for the Jat kings and queens. King's bedroom contains an enormous black granite bed of the Maharaja. It had once served as a part of Parsi death rites, functioning as a platform for washing dead bodies. Visiting Deeg Palace is open 9 am to 5 pm except on Fridays. The nearest airports are at Agra (70 km) and Delhi (200 km). The nearest railhead is Bharatpur junction (35 km). Deeg is four hours by road from Delhi, two hours from Agra and one hour from Mathura.

Life  During his early career, Best made some detailed illustrations of prehispanic excavation findings in the Valley of Mexico for Franz Boas.From a Mexican Perspective - The Vision of Adolfo Best Maugard. He completed his art studies in Europe; there he met Diego Rivera for his first time. In 1913, Rivera painted Best's portrait in oils; this work is in the collection of the Museo Nacional de Arte. Best removed to Mexico in 1914, where he taught at the upcoming plein air painting schools. He confronted Mexican folk art and added modern and rational stylistic elements to his paintings, which often included figurative caricatures. In mid-1919 he went to continue his studies in the U.S., returning to Mexico in 1920. At the Secretariat of Public Education he was director of the department for art education between 1921 and 1924. His drawing methods found their way into art education at Mexican schools in 1922, and over 200,000 pupils were influenced by his drawing manual Manuales y Tratados: Metodo de dibujo: tradition, resurgimiento y evolucion del arte mexicano in 1923. He also wrote some books on art history during these years. In 1931, he was commissioned by the Mexican government to assist Sergei Eisenstein in filming ¬°Que viva M√©xico!. In the following year Best became a member of the Consejo de Bellas Artes (\\"Council of fine arts\\") as well as the Consejo de Asuntos Culturales (\\"Council of Cultural Affairs\\") in Mexico City. He was also a member of the Sociedad de Geograf√≠a y Estad√≠stica (\\"Society of Geography and Statistics\\") and of the Mexican Union of Film Directors. In 1933 he was representative of the department of fine arts of the council for primary education. From 1932 to 1935 he worked in the marketing branch of the Loter√≠a Nacional de M√©xico (\\"National Lottery for Public Benefits\\"). In 1933, he directed the filming of Humanidad (\\"Humanity\\") and in 1937, La Mancha de Sangre (\\"The Bloodstain\\") based on his own script, which was first screened in June 1943. Best Maugard was a Mexican modernist painter and writer under Porfirio D√≠az's regime. He founded the universalism method in drawing. His book M√©todo de dibujo: Tradici√≥n, resurgimiento y evoluci√≥n del arte mexicano (\\"Drawing Method: Tradition, Resurgence, and Evolution of Mexican Art\\") would explain the seven elements in drawing. The Best Maugard method was fundamental to the modernist aesthetic in Mexico. His style and method was a proposal for defining mexicanidad (Mexicanness). His approach to explaining universalism in drawing is based on the principles of formal abstraction and fusion; which then creates an alternative to the rhetorical, didactic, and figurative art later known as the 'Mexican School'. His method introduced a visual vocabulary and grammar for the foundation of Mexican art by drawing on elements extracted from pre-Hispanic art, which he argued determined the characteristics of Mexican popular art in combination with elements from Europe and Asia. In his book, Best Maugard illustrates the seven primary elements in the primitive art of all nations: the spiral, the zig-zag line, and the straight line‚Äîwhich are transformed by each race of nation, and correlations to the distinctive characteristics of its society and environment. His method is strictly about aestheticism and its formal qualities, and not their symbolic content. Best Maugard's pursuit to uncover universal laws of artistic development is a reflection of Mexico's cientificos. He applied positivism into drawing by using the natural sciences as a model. He sought to reveal scientific laws relevant to all social phenomena and understanding the development of human society as a rising progression from the savage or primitive state to modern civilization. He conceived his theory of the seven basic elements of Mexican art through his time as an assistant to the archaeologist Gamio. Gamio introduced him to Boas, a professor at Columbia University in New York. Boas' research on refuting the concept of racial determinism was a great influence on Best Maugard's drawing method. During his time as an assistant to Gamio, he catalogued and drew more than two thousand ceramic objects selected by Boas. Best Maugard was a good friend of Rosa Covarrubias and Miguel Covarrubias, and had several contacts with artist and poetry groups in the United States.Adolfo Best Maugard 1891-1965 (Spanish), biography.

Only two men, the lancer Pacheco on the government side and a rebel Avila, were killed. Victoria was severely wounded. Background A small group made up of the more wealthy citizens of Alta California united and petitioned Governor Victoria for democratic reforms. Victoria called two of the men, Jos√© Antonio Carrillo and Abel Stearns, \\"traitors\\", and ordered their execution. He later stayed the sentences and had the men banished from Alta California. The previous governor, Jose Maria de Echeandia, had been more popular, so the original dissidents, including the two \\"traitors,\\" along with several other land owners, suggested to him that Victoria's stay as governor would shortly be coming to an abrupt end. They built up a small army, marched into Los Angeles, and \\"captured\\" the town. Victoria gathered a small army to drive them off, leading it himself. The forces met on December 5, 1831, at Cahuenga Pass, with Captain Portilla in charge of the rebels. The battle The opposing armies were made up of brothers, sons, uncles, nephews, and friends, who though angry at one-another preferred to avoid mortal combat. Victoria had half the troops of his opponents. Undaunted, he ordered his men to fire. They did so, but aimed their volley over their adversaries' heads. The rebels answered with a similar reply, and a stand-off ensued. Alone among the government troops Captain Jose Antonio Romualdo Pacheco (father of the future governor Romualdo Pacheco) interpreted Victoria's order as a command to charge the enemy on horseback, spurring on his mount with outstretched lance. When he discovered he was alone he halted between the two forces. Jose Maria Avila of the rebel army, a former alcalde of the Pueblo of Los Angeles, took offense and went out to challenge Pacheco in mounted combat. Excellent horsemen, the pair were evenly matched. After three unsuccessful charges, Pacheco finally knocked Avila's lance to the ground. Infuriated, Avila drew his pistol and shot Pacheco from the saddle, killing him. Shocked at his reflexive act, Avila sat on his horse in a kind of horrified stupor. Upset at such unchivalrous behavior, Governor Victoria, drew his pistol and shot Avila dead. This angered Captain Portilla, who charged Victoria and put his lance through the Governor's face, ripping off a chunk of flesh and cartilage. Victoria fell writhing at the wound. Both forces broke off the conflict. edhat.com, The (805) to the (808), Battle of Cahuenga Pass, Jun 15, 2013, By Peter Hartmann & Stacey Wright Aftermath Governor Victoria survived, but subsequently resigned the governorship of Alta California. The previous governor, Jos√© Mar√≠a de Echeand√≠a, resumed his role until Jose Figueroa took over on January 14, 1833. Governor Victoria's wounds were tended to by Joseph Chapman, a naturalized U.S. immigrant living in the area.

The show features puppets, celebrities, picture books, songs and animation. Lucy Goodman created the show after researching the current global decline in parental reading in the home. Bookaboo is carefully crafted to inspire more children and grown ups to have fun sharing books together. Bookaboo is streamed on Amazon Video in the United Kingdom, and broadcast on ABC2 in Australia, CBC Television in Canada and Amazon Video in the United States. Format \\"A story a day or I just can't play!\\" says world-famous, drum-playing rock puppy, Bookaboo as he flounces off stage. The rest of the band (Growler on Bass Guitar, Paws on Keyboards) find Bookaboo on the Bookabus, ignoring all stage calls and engaged in the most extraordinary stage avoidance schemes (comedy sketches & songs). Despite their best efforts the band fail to persuade the rock pup back to the stadium. Luckily, a celebrity fan arrives with a picture book filled 'Bookabag' and settles down to share it. Bookaboo is mesmerised and enthralled by the story. It appears to cure his little 'problem'. As the book finishes, Bookaboo gets his rhythm (he calls it his 'Bojo') back. With the celebrity fan cheering him on from the wings, Bookaboo delights the crowds with a canine drum solo. As the episode draws to an end, an electrified stage sign behind Bookaboo lets the grown up audience know: \\"1000 books per episode are donated to children who need them most\\". Featured Books Books featured in the show are carefully selected from approximately 500 that are submitted each series by publishers across the UK. Selection criteria are simple ‚Äì books must be truly enjoyable to share aloud for both children and adults. Celebrities A wide variety of celebrities are invited to take part in the show to encourage grown-ups from the broadest areas of society to share books with children. Celebrities have included pop stars (Melanie C., Meat Loaf, Alesha Dixon) and Grime star Lethal Bizzle. Sportsmen and women have also supported Bookaboo's campaign to get more grown-ups sharing books, including a former goalkeeper for England (David Seaman), boxer Ricky Hatton and wrestler (Adam Copeland). Actors and Actresses (Michael Sheen, Emilia Fox, Stana Katic), Presenters (Paula Abdul, Amanda Holden, Lorraine Kelly) and comedians (Johnny Vegas, Al Murray) have all shared a book with Bookaboo. Celebrities are both young and old, such as EastEnders young star Maisie Smith (nine years old), and Bernard Cribbins (eighty-two years). All celebrities become in effect, Storytime Ambassadors for Bookaboo's \\"Share A Book Today\\" campaign and have taken part as a result of their desire to help more children and grown-ups share books together. Bookaboo Share A Book Today Campaign By 2011, 26,000 books had been donated to disadvantaged children across the United Kingdom, on behalf of Bookaboo and the publishers and celebrities taking part. In 2009, Bookaboo partnered with Booktrust and The Book People, to enable 13,000 books to be distributed to under six-year-old children in care. In 2011, Bookaboo partnered with The Pre School Learning Alliance and a further 13,000 books are being distributed to nurseries in areas of disadvantage in the UK. In 2013, Bookaboo partnered with First Book Canada when Season became a UK/Canadian co- production and in 2016 when the show premiered as an Amazon Original in the US, First Book US became the charity partner. Characters=The Story behind the band All current members of Bookaboo's band met in the dog rescue centre as orphaned puppies. Their talent for music was uncovered by the centre owner and as a result they entered and won canine talent contest 'Pup Idol'. The puppy band set out to tour the globe on their tourbus, a converted library truck called the Bookabus and play to packed out stadiums around the world. Bookaboo Bookaboo is a world-famous rock puppy and legendary canine drummer. But Bookaboo has a little problem. Bookaboo loses his 'bojo' (his rhythm) and can not play unless he's been able to share a book with someone, hence his famous line \\"A Story a day or I just can't play\\". Marcus Clarke is the puppeteer. The Bookaboo puppet was designed by Paul Andrejco and was built by Puppet Heap in Hoboken, NJ. Growler Growler is an American hound and talented bass guitarist. Growler has a particularly low voice and oddly pitched howl and growl. A backstory to be released reveals why he got called Growler. Growler was introduced in Series 2 United Kingdom. He was designed and built by Puppet Heap and is puppeteered by Paul Andrecjo. Paws Paws is a talented and extremely dexterous Dachshund keyboard player. To date, Paws has played keyboards and key-tar. Paws was designed and built by Puppet Heap, and is puppeteered in the United Kingdom by Brian Herring. Music The titles music, all of the songs and the majority of the incidental music is written, composed and mostly played by Mark Dyson. Bookaboo's drum solo is performed by Alex Toff who also puppeteered Bookaboo's arms for his drum solo. Alex Toff whilst dressed up in a lycra chromakey green body fitting suit, described the job as 'the weirdest session he'd ever done'. Songs to date include: :* 'Bookaboo's Book Blues' ‚Äì Bookaboo sings the Blues :* 'Sausages' ‚Äì Growler rocks about his love of sausages :* 'Hey You Make Some Noise' ‚Äì Anthem includes the line \\"if you rock with the pups then you're part of the band\\" :* 'Life on the Road'- ballad Merchandising A pop-up book complete with sound chip called 'Pup Idol' is published by Walker Books in the United Kingdom and Australia.

For instance Pushkin, who some scholars regard as Russia's first great writer,Vladimir Nabokov (1981) Lectures on Russian Literature, lecture on Russian Writers, Censors, and Readers, pp.13-4 attracted the mad irritation of the Russian officialdom and particularly of the Tsar, since he \\"instead of being a good servant of the state in the rank and file of the administration and extolling conventional virtues in his vocational writings (if write he must), composed extremely arrogant and extremely independent and extremely wicked verse in which a dangerous freedom of thought was evident in the novelty of his versification, in the audacity of his sensual fancy, and in his propensity for making fun of major and minor tyrants.\\" History of art According to Groys, \\"Art has its own power in the world, and is as much a force in the power play of global politics today as it once was in the arena of cold war politics.\\"  Social and political change  Pertaining to such politically-intractable phenomena as the Modern conflicts in the Middle East, however, some artists and social critics believe that \\"art is useless as a tool for political change.\\" There are, nevertheless, examples where artists employ art in the service of political change.  Role of poetry  The Italian poet Ungaretti, when interviewed on transgression by director Pasolini for the 1964 Love Meetings documentary, said that the foundation of poetry is to transgress all laws. The recitation of powerful, pithy poetry is a popular art form at American protests and political rallies. From the civil rights, women‚Äôs liberation, gay rights, and Puerto Rican Independence movements to Black Lives Matter, poetry is used to build emotional unity in crowds and draw media attention. Giannina Braschi wrote, \\"Poets and anarchists are always the first to go. Where? To the frontline. Wherever it is.\\" Protest poems include Gwendolyn Brooks \\"Riot\\", Allen Ginsberg's Howl, Tato Laviera's \\"Lady Liberty\\", Nikki Giovanni's \\"Rosa Parks\\", Amiri Baraka's \\"Short Speech to My Friends,\\" and Jill McDonough's \\"Dear Gaybashers\\". Beat poet Allen Ginsberg was arrested at an antiwar demonstration in New York City in 1967 and tear-gassed at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968. Examples=Situationist International The Situationist International (SI), a small group of international political and artistic agitators with roots in Marxism, Lettrism and the early 20th-century European artistic and political avant- gardes formed in 1957, aspired to major social and political transformations; before disbanding in 1972 and splitting into a number of different groups, including the Situationist Bauhaus, the Antinational, and the Second Situationist International, the first SI became active in Europe through the 1960s and elsewhere throughout the world and was characterized by an anti- capitalist and surrealist perspective on aesthetics and politics, according to Italian art historian Francesco Poli. In the works of the situationists, Italian scholar Mirella Bandini observes, there is no separation between art and politics; the two confront each other in revolutionary terms. Historically, revolutionary ideas have emerged first among artists and intellectuals. That's why a precise mechanism to defuse the role of artists and intellectuals is to relegate them into specialized, compartmentalized disciplines, in order to impose unnatural dichotomies as the \\"separation of art from politics\\". Once artistic-intellectual works are separated from current events and from a comprehensive critique of society, they are sterilized and can be safely integrated into the official culture and the public discourse, where they can add new flavours to old dominant ideas and play the role of a gear wheel in the mechanism of the society of the spectacle. Poster art \\"Not content with claiming leftwing music\\", posters for the Conservative Party in the UK recycled iconic art styles of \\"socialist revolution\\" to communicate its political message in 2008. Entropa Czech sculptor David ƒåern√Ω's Entropa, a sculpture commissioned to mark the Czech presidency of the European Union Council during the first semester of 2009, illustrates how art can come into conflict with politics, creating various kinds of controversy in the process, both intentionally and unintentionally. Entropa attracted controversy both for its stereotyped depictions of the various EU member states and for having been a creation of ƒåern√Ω and two friends rather than, as ƒåern√Ω purported, a collaboration of 27 artists from each of the member states. Some European Union members states reacted negatively to the depiction of their country, with Bulgaria, for instance, deciding to summon the Czech Ambassador to Sofia in order to discuss the illustration of the Balkan country as a collection of squat toilets (ƒåTK). This \\"Europe-wide hoax ‚Ä¶ reveals deeper truths\\" not only about the countries but \\"about art itself\\" (Gavrilova). Russian aesthetics According to Esti Sheinberg, a lecturer in music at the University of Edinburgh, in her book Irony, Satire, Parody and the Grotesque in the Music of Shostakovich, in \\"the traditional Russian perception of the arts\\", an \\"interrelationship between artistic technique and ideological content is the main aesthetic criterion\\" (ix; cf. Blois). Classical music Ludwig van Beethoven did not use the original title \\"Ode to Freedom\\" of Friedrich Schiller's lyric, known in English as \\"Ode to Joy\\" (1785), in setting it to music in the final movement of his Ninth Symphony (1824), which \\"Napoleonic censors had forced the poet to change to 'Ode to Joy'.\\" After the fall of the Berlin Wall, on 9 November 1989, that Christmas Day, when Leonard Bernstein conducted a performance of Beethoven's Ninth at the site of the former East German-West German border in Berlin, a concert telecast nationally in the United States, he substituted Freedom for Joy to reflect his own \\"personal message\\". Folk and protest music In February 1952, the United States Customs Service seized the passport of Paul Robeson, preventing him from leaving the United States to travel to the Fourth Canadian Convention of the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; but, after \\"The convention heard Robeson sing over the telephone\\", the union organized \\"a concert on the US-Canada border\\". According to the account of the \\"Paul Robeson Centennial Celebration\\": \\"Robeson sang and spoke for 45 minutes. He introduced his first song stating 'I stand here today under great stress because I dare, as do you‚Äîall of you, to fight for peace and for a decent life for all men, women and children' ‚Ä¶ [and, accompanied by Lawrence Brown on piano,] proceeded to sing spirituals, folk songs, labour songs, and a passionate version of Old Man River, written for him in the [1920s], slowly enunciating 'show a little grit and you land in jail', underlining the fact that his government had turned the entire country into a prison for Robeson and many others.\\" In the 1960s the songs of Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, and others protested further racism, war, and the military-industrial complex, continuing an American artistic tradition of political protest founded during its colonial era. Restrictions on live-music venuesIn the United States= In force from July 1985 until May 2002 and considered by its opponents a Draconian \\"anti-music law\\", the Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO), imposing restrictions on clubs admitting those under the legal drinking age of 21 in Seattle, Washington, was still the subject of protracted political and legal opposition in U.S. Federal Court in early 2002, when a suit filed by the Joint Artists and Music Promotions Action Committee (JAMPAC) in 2000 was still being adjudicated. In May 2002, Judge Lasnik ruled for the City of Seattle on JAMPAC's suit, finding no Constitutional infringement of the First Amendment and deciding that the matter is a political one for the Seattle City Council to decide, not the courts; during the course of the suit, Mayor Schell's successor, Greg Nickels, a proponent of the bill, resubmitted the ordinance to the Seattle City Council, and, on 12 August 2002, the new All-Ages Dance Ordinance (AADO) replaced the TDO, but was not considered much of an improvement by its critics. In May 2008 a \\"Promoters Ordinance\\" proposed by the Chicago City Council aroused opposition in Chicago, Illinois, for being regarded as overly restrictive and stifling free expression. =In the United Kingdom= Following the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003, the London Borough of Hillingdon cited \\"the interest of public order and the prevention of terrorism\\" as reasons for expecting promoters of live music events to complete the Metropolitan Police's Form 696. Though later clarified by a police spokesperson as not \\"compulsory\\", the perceived \\"demand\\" for the information solicited on such \\"risk assessment\\" forms motivated Jon McClure, lead singer with Reverend and The Makers, to post an electronic petition in the \\"E-Petitions\\" section of the official website of Gordon Brown, the UK Prime Minister, at Number10.gov.uk, in order to facilitate protest against what McClure alleges is \\"racial discrimination\\" occasioned by such bureaucratic constraints, which some have deemed \\"police authoritarianism\\". It begins: \\"We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to Scrap the unnecessary and draconian usage of the 696 Form from London music events\\". By 11 November 2008, according to Orlowski, \\"A dozen London boroughs [had] implemented a 'risk assessment' [Form 696] policy for live music that permits the police to ban any live music if they fail to receive personal details from the performers 14 days in advance.\\" Orlowski points out: > The demand explicitly singles out performances and musical styles favoured > by the black community: garage and R&B;, and MCs and DJs. ... However all > musical performances ‚Äì from one man playing a guitar on up ‚Äì are subject to > the demands once implemented by the council. And the threat is serious: > failure to comply 'may jeopardise future events by the promoter or the > venue'. ... UK Music chief Feargal Sharkey ... speaking to the Department of > Culture Media and Sport's hearing on venue licensing today [11 Nov. 2008] > [concluded that] ... 'Live music is now a threat to the prevention of > terrorism'. ... In response, Detective Superintendent Dave Eyles from the > Met's clubs and vice office told us that 10,000 such Risk Assessments would > be processed this year. He said they weren't compulsory: ... 'We can't > demand it ‚Äì we recommend that you provide it as best practice. But you're > bloody silly if you don't, because you're putting your venue at risk.' By early March 2009, over 16,000 British citizens or residents had signed McClure's E-Petition, which remained open to potential signatories until 1 December 2009.

The novel is also sometimes published under the name Retaliatory Strike ().  Plot  The story begins in the year 3870, with Galact-Captain Ivan Tamantsev of the Confederacy of Suns defending an unarmed convoy from a group of pirate ships. Despite managing to destroy four of the attacking ships, Tamantsev loses his wingman and is himself forced to eject, after his fighter sustains heavy damage. His escape pod is towed by the pirates to their homeworld of Ganio, settled by colonists of Middle Eastern descent. Tamantsev is brought before Faizullah of the Javgeth Clan, the man who ordered the raid on the convoy. He explains to the Captain his options: he can either agree to temporary employment by the Clans as a pilot, until he pays off the destruction of the four fighters and their AI modules (the fighters were unmanned), or Faizullah can let him go with the knowledge that Tamantsev will not survive long on the desert world. While Ivan agrees to fly missions for Faizullah (fully aware that the Ganian intends to go back on his word), he demands to personally inspect his fighter. Upon arriving to the hangar, he sees that it is an ancient Phantom-class aerospace fighter from the days of the First Galactic War with the Earth Alliance. While he shudders at the thought of flying this 1500-year-old antique, Ivan knows that this is his best shot of escaping the planet. Faizullah's engineers agree to let him inside the fighter, as they have disabled all of the craft's AI functions. However, they underestimate the Confederate pilot training, and Tamantsev is able to restart the systems in service mode and launch the ship manually. Upon entering orbit, Ivan faces another problem, as the Phantom does not have enough fuel to jump to another system, and the old fighter is no match for the Ganio's orbital defenses. Ivan scans the local hypersphere force lines and determines that one of them is unmarked on all star charts (i.e. it does not lead anywhere). Realizing he has nothing to lose, Tamantsev transitions into hypersphere and uses the last of his fuel to maneuver the ship to intersect with the unmarked force line, remembering that 3 million years ago, none of the known races did not possess hyperdrives (it is an invention unique to humans). Instead, they used stationary portals which used the hypersphere force lines as conduits to rapidly send objects between planets. Ivan's theory turns out to be correct, and his fighter enters one such conduit and rapidly travels to another system far from Ganio. Unfortunately, the conduit throws his ship out into normal space into a planet's low orbit. Lacking fuel, Ivan is unable to slow down his descent and is forced to eject, while the Phantom crashes in the nearby woods. Before ejecting, Ivan notices a city protected by a giant wall not too far from the crash site. After getting out of his escape pod, Tamantsev decides to head towards the city, assuming it to be yet another lost colony, settled during the Great Exodus of the 23rd century. Following standard protocols, Ivan does not remove his spacesuit until he can determine that the air is safe to breathe and there are no harmful microorganisms in the planet's biosphere. However, after several days of walking, he runs out of air and is forced to crack the seal. Ivan finds that the air is safe to breathe but shortly succumbs to a strange ailment, which persists for several hours before going away just as suddenly as it appeared. He finds that he is able to sense living creatures without actually hearing or seeing them. His newfound empathic ability allows him to see any living thing's neural structure, which he uses to kill a local predator with a single shot to the brain (the largest neural mass). Some time later, he witnesses an ambush of a woman by a dozen shapeshifting creatures. He rescues her by using his empathic ability to determine the location of the creatures' brains before shooting them. After recovering, the woman reveals that her name is Flora Shodan, and that she is descended from the settlers who arrived aboard the colony ship Hope (they are aware that their ancestors came from Earth). After Ivan notices that Flora is able to literally turn invisible, she reveals that all of the arrivals underwent genetic mutation to varying degrees upon first breathing the planet's air. The mutations have created four distinct subspecies: Shadows, Metamorphs, Emglans, and Chosen. Flora was born a Shadow and is able to turn her body (not her clothes) invisible, has empathic abilities, and is able to heal by touch. Metamorphs are shapeshifters, capable of assuming any shape, including flawlessly imitating another person. Emglans are telepaths and are able to sense a person's general state of mind from miles away. The Chosen have remained mostly human. All of Doom's (name given to the planet by the colonists) inhabitants have one ability in common: they are immortal. The body of any person over 30 stops aging, so some of those who arrived aboard the Hope are still alive. However, the mutations also affects the birth rate. As such, no child has been born in over 200 years (Flora herself is only 302 and is viewed as a girl by many others). Many of the colonists have gone insane as the result of the changes and have fled to the wilderness. The survivors came across a giant wall built millions of years ago and built their City behind it. The human society consists of five castes called satts (named after the captain of the Hope, Satt Valtorn). The Shadow, Metamorph, Emglan, and Chosen Satts are all exclusively made up of their respective subspecies, while the Warrior Satt is made up of former members of the other satts who have chosen the life of danger and wish to protect the City from the wild metamorphs using antiquated equipment, salvaged from the Hope. After relaying all this information, Flora reveals that Ivan himself has become a Shadow. Ivan asks Flora why she was outside the City, and she replies that she was looking for a pair of invisible assailants, who have attacked a Chosen and stolen his car. The description of the attack leads Ivan to believe that he is not the only outsider on this world. He repairs her damaged vehicle, and they head back to the City, where Ivan is greeted with caution. Flora invites Ivan to be a guest at her house until he is given a place of his own (due to machines doing all menial work in the City, everybody's basic needs are satisfied (food, shelter, clothing, etc.), realizing that she was falling for the young stranger from the stars. The next day, Ivan and Flora head to the monthly Satt Council meeting, where Ivan hopes to convince the satts of the danger of the outside galaxy. However, Ivan's inexperience with his mental abilities causes a panic, and he is forced to wait outside. He overhears an argument between Flora and Derek Kelgan, the head of the Chosen Satt, who refuses to listen to her and the \\"infant\\" she brought with her and even threatens to kill her if she starts disturbing the peace. Fed up, Ivan assaults Kelgan and forces him to apologize to Flora. Upon returning to Flora's house, they realize that they have fallen in love and spend the night together. The next morning, Ivan decides to leave the City and join the Warrior Satt to both attempt to protect the colony and keep Flora safe from Kelgan's attempts at revenge. Flora refuses to listen to his reasons, only concerned with him leaving her. Upon arriving to the Boundary (the name given to the ancient wall protecting the city), Ivan is accepted into the Warrior Satt. Meanwhile, Flora calms down and realizes that Ivan was only trying to protect her. She remembers that he was trying to find out more about the colony's past and asks her friend Nicolai Lorgen, a Chosen, to retrieve the information from his satt's archives. In the attempt to please Flora, with whom he has long been enamored, Nick copies the data onto a service droid and sends it to Flora's house. However, he is caught by his father Richard Lorgen, who decides to punish his son and tells Kelgan about it. Kelgan sends droids to assassinate Flora and Ivan. Due to some quick thinking, Flora survives the attempt and uses the maintenance shafts running under the City to get to the Boundary, along with her friends Ryben (a Metamorph) and Nive (an Emglan) and the service droid. Ivan is out on nightly patrol of the Boundary when an assassin droid tries to kill him with a sniper rifle. Unlike the locals, Tamantsev trusts technology more than his senses, and that is what saves him. After destroying the droid, he reunited with Flora and asks Lymel, the head of the Warrior Satt to give him a vehicle for traveling outside the city. After examining the wreckage of the Phantom, Ivan confirms his suspicions that his entire escape from Ganio was orchestrated by someone who wants access to Doom. He reads through the data from the service droid and discovers that Satt Valtorn disappeared after departing on an expedition to a set of alien buildings not too far from the colony. They head to a complex of ancient structures on a plateau, nicknamed the Claw by the colonists. On the way there, Ivan experiences a set of visions, which are actually data implanted in his brain during his service in the Confederate special forces and activated by certain visual cues. He puts the pieces together and realizes that Doom is a site of an ancient bio-lab set up by the Harammins 3 million years ago to develop bio-weapons in their fight against the Insects. The planet Paradise, visited by humans earlier, was a test site for one of their experiments to create shapeshifters (see novel Paradise Lost). The research was abandoned following the isolation of the O'Hara cluster, although it did yield an unexpected side effect ‚Äî the Harramin Holy Grail, immortality. Now, someone wants to learn the secret of immortality at any cost. Earlier, on Ganio, Gour, the last surviving member of the Harammin Immortal Quota, is watching his plan unfold. He had paid Faizullah to capture a Confederate pilot and orchestrated his entire escape, including the jump using a hypersphere conduit. The jump also activated an ancient Harammin portal on Ganio, long buried under the desert sand. Gour tricks Faizullah into digging out the portal and sending a strike force to eliminate the human inhabitants of Doom before sending out his own forces to kill the survivors, including the Ganians. Meanwhile, Ivan is setting up the defenses along the Boundary, expecting an attack, when Faizullah arrives with his troops and three Hoplite-class serv-machines, capable of reducing the giant wall and the City to rubble in a matter of minutes. Tamantsev contacts Faizullah and makes him realize that he has been betrayed. Faizullah, being a man of honor, agrees to join forces with the defenders and fight off Gour's forces. Ivan takes one of the Hoplites, while Faizullah takes another. They use the drain the batteries of the third one to send a message through hypersphere, calling in the Confederate fleet, knowing full well that the fleet will never get to Doom in time. Ivan asks Flora to go to the City and convince Kelgan to shut down the City's power grid, as the machines sent by Gour will interpret the City's power signatures as hostile targets and open fire on civilians. Flora calls Kelgan and explains the situation, but he refuses to listen, believing Flora and the Warrior Satt to be traitors for letting outsiders into the City. He orders Richard Lorgen to send a squad of droids to strike at the defenders from behind. Nive reveals to Flora that he used to be the Hope's chief engineer and knows the City's power grid inside-out. He goes to shut the grid down manually, while Flora and Ryben return to the Boundary to help the defenders. Unfortunately, Nive is too late, and the three attacking Phalanxer- class serv-machines launch high-yield missiles at key power signatures in the City, killing many civilians, including Kelgan himself. The defenders fight serv-machines and assault droids and, never having to face such enemies before, take heavy losses. The Ganians, true to their word, fight and die with them side by side. Despite the odds, Ivan and Faizullah manage to take out most of the enemy serv-machines, although they are heavily wounded and their Hoplites destroyed. Conquering their overwhelming fear of death, the defenders charge the assault droids, dying by the dozens but also taking out a large chunk of the enemy forces. Despite the arrival of Kelgan's droids, the defenders manage to win the day. Flora and Ivan are reunited. The wounded Faizullah understands that he has now become a mutant himself, along with two dozen of his men. Knowing that they can never go home (they would risk spreading the mutating agents to the galaxy), Faizullah decides to stay and declares the creation of the Ganio Satt. Gour, who arrives through the portal several hours later is captured by Ryben, who prevents the Harammin from cracking the seal of his helmet and breathing in Doom's air.

During his torture Lawrence cried out \\"This side‚Äôs done, turn me over and have a bite.\\" [\\"Assum est, inquit, versa et manduca.\\"].Saint Ambrose, De officiis ministrorum, 1.41.207 The statue stands in a 12-inch niche cut on the angle of a 14th-century window on the north east side of the building. The chancel was rebuilt in the 1850s and within it there hangs a Turkish sanctuary lamp made from bronze filigree. Local folklaw says that this lamp was once the property of Florence Nightingale. To the outside of the church there is a 12th-century tower. On the south elevation there is a Saxon window which was discovered only in the 1960s giving an idea of the age of this building. Hunworth Hall Hunworth hall was built in 1699 For Edmund Britliffe. It is constructed over two storeys and is of rendered brickwork. To the front elevation there are six bays with a central doorcase with pilasters which are a later addition from circa the 18th century. The brick and flint barn north of the hall, which also dates from the 18th century, has Britliffe‚Äôs initials set into the wall. Another barn to further north dates to about 1700 and seems to have started as a house, been converted to a stock-house, then back to a house. Hunworth watermill Hunworth watermill stands on the river Glaven and the building seen today dates from the 1750s. Norfolk Mills:Hunworth There has been a mill on the site for even longer with records showing milling dues being paid to Edward the Confessor. The building is constructed from Norfolk red brick and flint and has a pantiled roof. When the mill was sold in 1974 it had been unused for forty years and all its machinery was intact. It has since been renovated into a dwelling and is a grade II listed mill house. The Bell public house The Hunny Bell, as locals call it, stands on the village green and was formally called the Bluebell inn. The building dates from the 18th century. The pub was rebranded as The Hunworth Bell and is now (as of August 2017) run by multi-award winning Ben and Sarah Handley also of The Duck Inn, Stanhoe. Ben and Sarah have owned The Duck Inn for several years and have won numerous accolades including becoming The Good Food Guide Restaurant of the Year 2017.

Manoly originally came to Vienna as a boy soprano, who had an exceptional voice in choral music. Upon arriving in Vienna at the age of fifteen, he found his voice changing and unable to audition at the Conservatory. However, there was a scholarship to study the double bass which he took up. At the Vienna Conservatory, he studied double bass with Franz Simandl; harmony, counterpoint, and composition with Anton Bruckner; and conducting with Joseph Hellmesberger. Graduating in 1876, he moved to the United States where he performed with the Theodore Thomas Orchestra, the Mendelssohn Quintette Club of Boston, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. He joined the Philharmonic Society of New York and the Philharmonic Club, which later turned into the New York Philharmonic in 1880, eventually becoming principal bass of the ensemble in 1892, and later performed with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. Through his life, he came in contact with such individuals as Brahms, Liszt, Wagner, Saint-Sa√´ns, Tchaikovsky, Anton Rubinstein, Bruckner, Richard Strauss, Mahler, Max Bruch, Carl Goldmark, Verdi, Jacques Offenbach, Johann Strauss, and Eduard Strauss. Manoly's compositions include a number of works for double bass and a flute concerto for Georges Barr√®re, who was principal flute of the New York Philharmonic from 1905-28.

Maya Kucherskaya, a critic, described Shishkin's novel in the following manner: ‚ÄûMaidenhair is a great novel about a word and a language that becomes soft and obedient in the hands of a Master.

It is named for the Jesuit Peter Meshkalla, martyr of the Communist era. Shkod√´r Jesuit College was a Jesuit college in Shkod√´r, in northwestern Albania. The college has traditionally been an important centre of scholarly study into Albanian literature and language. History The beginning of the Jesuit presence in Albania was in 1841 with some Jesuits from Sicily, while Albania was still under the Ottoman Empire and lacked the boundaries it has today. Evangelism remained problematic but in 1854 the Office of the Vatican Missionary Bishops and Albanians opened a seminary in Shkodra for the southern Balkans, entrusted to the Italian Jesuits. The college was started in 1877, as a Xavier college (). Shkod√´r Jesuit College In 1877 the Jesuits opened Shkoder Saverian College, first as a trade school and then as a classic liceum after the 1912 declaration of Albania's independence from the Ottoman Empire. This was accompanied by itinerant missionary work, alongside cultural, religious, artistic, musical, and theatrical groups, and publication of the magazine Immaculate Conception. In 1944 the communists came to power. Repression and persecution of Catholics followed. Among the 40 deemed martyrs in Albania during this period were Fr. Daniel Dajan, Rector of the College and Saverian Seminary. and Brother John Pantalia who ran the publishing house. The distinguished poet Ndre Mjeda taught at the Jesuit college from 1930.Shkoder.net Only in 1990 did a new regime lead to the return of the Jesuits. In February 1992 they opened in the Shkodra Archbishopric a minor seminary. In 1994 they regained the property of the former Saverian College. A technical school and high school, recognized by the State, emerged. A seminary for all Albania, including philosophy and theology, opened in 1998 with help from Renovabis and the Italian Jesuits. Middle School \\"Pjet√´r Meshkalla\\" replaced the earlier Xaverian College, and has since 1998 grown into a secondary school accommodating 500 students (60% girls) in 18 classes. Their religious background is Christian (75% ‚Äì mostly Catholics, some Orthodox) and Muslim (25%). About 25% are village children. In 2000 the seminary split off from the middle school. On 29 June 2000 the first priests trained locally were ordained since the communist period. The School of Higher Studies of Philosophy and Theology is a promoter of the Albanian language and of dialogue with the Orthodox Church and with Islam.

The governing body is the Libyan Football Federation, which was founded in 1962. Al-Ittihad fans during a Champions League game in 2007 Football culture Libyans are passionate towards football. Most kids and teenagers in Libya usually play football in the streets as their favorite pastime. Most people leave their duties and jobs to go and watch a game. People in Libya have experienced many incidents during, before, or after derby games such as killing and some riots, this usually happens when Libya's top three clubs, Al-Ittihad Tripoli, Ahly Tripoli, and Ahly Benghazi face off. Though Libya has not achieved big on both International and Club level, Libyans are known to be skillful, having produced such talented players such as TarIk El-Taib, Jehad Muntasser, Ahmed Saad, and Fawzi Al-Issawi. National championships Prior to national championships, football was held at regional level.Libya championships 1928-1940 The first regional championships (of Italian Libya) were held in 1928. The first team was \\"US Bengasi\\" in Cyrenaica, with Italian colonists and local Arab players. The team \\"US Tripolina\\" of Tripoli was in 1938 and 1939 in the \\"First amateur division\\" of the Italian championship.Campionato tripolino 1939 These regional championships were blocked during WW2. There were three regional leagues in Libya since 1949Libya championships 1949-1962: West, East and South. Libyan Premier League This is the top flight of Libyan football. This is a semi-professional league, although some foreign players are professionals. The first championship was held in 1963, and was won by Al Ahly Tripoli. (see Libyan Premier League 1963-64) Al Ittihad have won the most championships, with 14, including the last 4 titles. The league is ranked as the 56th best league in the world for 2009, according to IFFHS. There are two other divisions, the Libyan Second Division, and the Libyan Third Division. Libyan Cup This competition was first initiated in 1976, although only 5 editions of the competition were played in the following twenty years. In the past, the runners-up of the Libyan Premier League were named the domestic cup champions. Al Ahly Tripoli and Al Ittihad Tripoli are the joint record winners, with 5 titles each. The holders are Khaleej Sirte, who beat Al Madina Tripoli 1-0 in a tense final (see 2008 Libyan Al-Fatih Cup Final) Libyan Trophy This competition was initiated in 2007. It is contested by members of the Premier League only. Khaleej Sirte won the inaugural competition. National team The national team, nicknamed The Mediterranean Knights, is considered one of the stronger teams in Africa and the Arab world, particularly in recent years. The good performances recorded in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations under Brazilian Coach Marcos Paqueta saw the team record their first win in the tournament outside of Libya in their final match against Senegal. This saw their FIFA world rankings rise to the highest it had ever been at 53, which later rose again to 36 in September 2012. 1900s They had one of their most successful periods in the 1980s, when such players as Salim Abu Jarrad, Fawzi Al-Issawi and Ali Al-Beshari almost led the side to silverware. In 1982, Libya hosted the 1982 African Cup of Nations, a competition in which they came second, losing 7-6 to Ghana on penalty kicks. The team was also very close to qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup, where they lost 3-1 to Morocco over two legs. The 1990s was a poor period for the national team. Libya was disqualified from qualifying for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to UN sanctions, and the team withdrew from qualifying for the 1990 competition. They did not enter the qualification process for the 1998 edition. They did do better in UAFA competitions, bowing out in the semi finals of the 1999 Pan Arab Games. 2000‚Äìpresent The 2000s were better for the nation, and with players such as Tarik El Taib, Nader Kara and Ahmad Saad coming through, the national team grew in strength, and did get to the final round of qualifying for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. Although they finished bottom of the group with two points from 8 games, the country did have a sense of pride, and came back stronger, coming within a point of qualification for the 2004 African Cup of Nations. Two years later, the side did get to its second Nations tournament, having finished fourth in their 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification group. The side did well in their group, which did contain the two finalists, Ivory Coast and the winners Egypt, as well as the 2004 African Cup of Nations runners-up Morocco. A 3‚Äì0 defeat to Egypt crippled their chances, and the team got respectable results, including a 2‚Äì1 defeat against the Ivory Coast, and a 0‚Äì0 draw against Morocco. The team did suffer a setback in qualification for the African Cup Of Nations 2008 tournament. The side suffered disappointing away defeats against Ethiopia and Namibia, which ruined their chances of qualifying. The club came very close to qualification for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The team secured a famous victory against Ghana, with an 86th-minute goal from Ahmed Saad Osman, but fell at the final hurdle, losing 1-0 to Gabon, which eliminated them on goal difference. In 2014 African Nations Championship the Libyan national team won its first title beating Ghana on penalties.

Sex Reveal of Josh and Anna's 4th child - People - February 3, 2015  Political activity  When Duggar was a teenager, his father, Jim Bob Duggar, was a two-term Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives. Duggar has also been active in conservative politics; while running a car dealership he worked as a part-time political consultant in 2007 under the business name Strategic Political Services. In 2008, he worked on the Republican presidential primary campaign of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee. In 2012, Joshua Duggar addressed rallies for the Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. From June 2013 to May 2015, he was executive director of FRC Action, a political action and lobbying organization sponsored by the Family Research Council. When describing his position with the organization, he stated that he would be focused on \\"engaging the grassroots and taking the message of faith, family and freedom all across America\\". Family Research Council president Tony Perkins said that by hiring Duggar they hoped to appeal to more young people by tapping into the popularity of the Duggar family TV series. He further stated, \\"The big part of Josh's focus is going to be building our grass-roots across the country\\". While working at FRC Action, conservative Republican candidates valued Duggar as a way to advance their messages to his constituents. He campaigned for Republican Senate candidates in Kansas, Mississippi, and Virginia before the 2014 midterm elections. He described his family as the \\"epitome of conservative values\\" and advocates for what he terms \\"family-centered\\" and conservative Christian right political viewpoints, including opposition to abortion, divorce, and gay marriage. Joshua Duggar has been referred to as an \\"anti-gay activist\\" by GLAAD, a pro- LGBT rights organization formerly known as the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation. Molestation controversy On May 21, 2015, a report by the magazine In Touch Weekly stated that Jim Bob Duggar had told the Arkansas State Police that Duggar had molested five underage girls between 2002 and 2003, when he was 14 and 15 years old.People Magazine coverage of scandal , People. Retrieved May 22, 2015.Josh Duggar involved in underage sex scandal , International Business Times. Retrieved May 22, 2015. The magazine's source of information was a redacted police report obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request. Arkansas Judge Stacey Zimmerman ordered the original police report destroyed and the public record expunged on the same day the article was released. The police report indicated that four of the five molestation victims were Duggar's siblings. Duggar's father reported he had learned in March 2002 that Josh had touched the breasts and genital region of his sisters on multiple occasions while they were sleeping. Duggar's parents stated they were made aware of the incidents when he confessed, and at the time, the girls were unaware the abuse had occurred. Duggar's father said that Duggar was disciplined at home. In March 2003, Duggar's parents learned of additional incidents and victims, with their son confessing he had touched their breasts and genital region while they slept and in a few cases while awake. These incidents included the touching of a babysitter, reaching under the dress of a younger sister who was in his lap, and cornering a sister in the laundry room to reach under her clothing. The Duggars had also been told the abuse included a much younger sister, who, according to the Duggars, \\"didn't understand she had been improperly touched.\\" At this time, Duggar's father brought the issue to the elders of their church. Duggar's father reported to police that he had enrolled his son in a program consisting of physical labor and counseling after consulting with his church's leadership. Duggar's mother stated he was sent away from home for a period of three months to work for a family friend who was remodeling a building. Later reports suggest that Duggar may have been sent to a facility in Little Rock, Arkansas, owned by the Institute in Basic Life Principles, a Christian ministry and training program founded by Bill Gothard, a Duggar family friend. It has not been established if the Institute in Basic Life Principles center in Little Rock was open for counseling during the time Duggar was there or if the building was renovated during this time period and he was assisting with the renovation. When Duggar returned home in July 2003, his father took him to meet with Jim Hutchens, an Arkansas State Trooper and family acquaintance. According to Duggar and his parents, the meeting was the first time any law enforcement authority was made aware of the sexual abuse. According to his father's recounting, Duggar admitted to the molestation to Hutchens and apologized. Speaking via a lawyer, Hutchens disputed part of the account, saying he was only told of a single act of incestuous molestation, and that he would have responded differently if he had known of additional instances and victims. In an interview following Hutchens' statement, Duggar's father claimed Hutchens was told the entire story. Hutchens did not take any official action but reportedly gave Duggar a \\"stern talk\\". Arkansas law, however, states that law enforcement officers are considered mandated reporters and are required to alert the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline when learning of sexual abuse. Hutchens was later arrested and convicted on unrelated charges of child pornography and is currently serving a 56-year prison sentence. In 2004 and 2006, the first four TV specials featuring the Duggar family were released. In December 2006, the family was scheduled to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. At this time, an anonymous source emailed Winfrey's Harpo Studios and called the Arkansas Child Abuse Hotline to reveal Duggar's past sexual misconduct. The producers of The Oprah Winfrey Show alerted the Department of Human Services and canceled the Duggar family's appearance on the show. As a result of these reports, an investigation by the Springdale, Arkansas Police Department was launched. Department investigators spoke to Duggar's parents and several other family members, with the family describing the sexual misconduct that occurred in 2002 and 2003. The family reported that no further incidents had occurred since he had returned to the home in late 2003. Family members interviewed by police said that they felt safe in their home and had forgiven Duggar for his past behavior. According to Arkansas law, child sexual abuse charges for offenses must be filed within three years of being reported to a police officer to be within the statute of limitations. Because of the family's earlier contact with Hutchens, the statute had started at the time of the contact and had run out by the time of the 2006 investigation. As a result, no charges could be filed. The police report of the 2006 investigation was the same report obtained in 2015 by In Touch Weekly. After the initial reporting on the redacted police report, an unidentified victim, reportedly still a minor, requested that any remaining products of the investigation be destroyed. Judge Stacey Zimmerman granted this request to protect the unidentitified victim's privacy. Though Duggar's misconduct was largely unknown to the public before 2015, a blogger writing in 2007 and identified only as \\"Alice\\" referred to the canceled Oprah Winfrey Show appearance and stated that show staffers had been told Duggar was a \\"child molester.\\" The allegation circulated on blogs and other sites for years discussing the Duggars but was not publicly corroborated until the In Touch Weekly article revealed the police report. Duggar resigned his position at the Family Research Council on May 21, 2015, after his history of sexual misconduct as a minor became public. He stated that he \\"acted inexcusably\\" as a teen and said he was \\"deeply sorry\\" for what he called his wrongdoings. In response to his resignation, FRC president Tony Perkins stated \\"Josh believes that the situation will make it difficult for him to be effective in his current work. We believe this is the best decision for Josh and his family at this time. We will be praying for everyone involved\\". Another police report obtained by In Touch Magazine reported in a June 3, 2015 article that as a 15-year-old, Duggar confessed on three separate occasions to his father about the molestation and that it involved a much younger sister and seven incidents. The article also notes that the Duggars waited at least sixteen months before reporting the abuse to authorities. Debate over release of police reports According to Trace Gallagher of Fox News, the Arkansas Freedom of Information Act states that the records of a juvenile \\"shall remain confidential\\" and \\"shall not be subject to disclosure under the FOI\\". Arkansas State Senator Bart Hester said \\"the law to protect minors' identities is not a suggestion\\" and called for Springdale Police Chief Kathy O'Kelley, who released the records, to be fired, saying O'Kelley re-victimized the girls. However, Springdale city attorney Ernest Cate defended the release of the records. Cate said that while Duggar was a minor at the time of the alleged incidents, he was 18 in December 2006, when the police report was filed. He added that under these circumstances, the records could be released once minors' names, as well as any potentially identifying pronouns, were redacted. Judge Stacey Zimmerman ordered all copies of the report destroyed on May 21, 2015. Two of Duggar's sisters, Jessa Duggar and Jill Duggar, spoke out about the abuse and about the release of the reports during an interview with Megyn Kelly which aired on June 5, 2015, on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File. Jessa called Duggar's actions as a teen \\"very wrong\\". She stated further, \\"I do want to speak up in his defense against people who are calling him a child molester or a pedophile or a rapist, as some people are saying\\". She went on to say, \\"that is so overboard and a lie really...I mean, people get mad at me for saying that, but I can say this because I was one of the victims\\". She said \\"the system was set up to protect kids...it's greatly failed\\", and that the week preceding the interview had been \\"a thousand times worse for us\\" than the sexual abuse. Jill called the release of the police reports \\"a revictimization\\".  Admissions following Ashley Madison breach On August 20, 2015, following the online posting of information from the Ashley Madison data breach which included records of credit card transactions under his name, Duggar and his parents released a statement on the family website in which he admitted to watching pornography on the Internet and being unfaithful to his wife. According to the material obtained in the data breach, Duggar's credit card was used to pay $986.76 for two Ashley Madison subscriptions starting in February 2013, which were cancelled in May 2015 shortly after the molestation allegations surfaced. The statement contained the following: \\"I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing pornography on the Internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife\\" ... \\"the last few years, while publicly stating I was fighting against immorality in our country I was hiding my own personal failures\\". The reference to pornography was later removed from the website. On August 25, 2015, Duggar checked himself into a rehabilitation facility that his family described as a \\"long-term treatment center\\". The facility was later confirmed in media reports as Reformers Unanimous, which describes itself as \\"a learning atmosphere where the addicted can be discipled in an environment that is much like a greenhouse\\". Assault allegation In November 2015, pornographic actress Danica Dillon filed suit against Duggar, claiming Duggar had \\"assaulted her to the point of causing her physical and emotional injuries\\" during an episode of consensual sex at a Philadelphia strip club earlier in the year. According to Dillon, the incident occurred after she had provided $600 worth of lap dances to Duggar; she was seeking $500,000 in damages from Duggar. In early 2016, Dillon chose to dismiss the lawsuit with no intent to refile. In popular culture During October 2015, Duggar was frequently mentioned as a possible Halloween costume persons should choose to avoid, with the New York Post saying persons should not go dressed as \\"Subway Jared, Josh Duggar or any alleged sex offender\\", while Details listed a Duggar costume in an article itemizing the \\"10 Worst Halloween-Costume Ideas of 2015\\". Advice against a Josh Duggar-themed costume was also published in Slate and E!

Narodni list, being independent, has a reputation of writing about things other newspapers dare not touch, such as corruption and nepotism among politicians, which often includes writing about organized crime. This newspaper is not to be confused with Narodni list (USA) that was published in New York by Frank Zotti from 1895. History The newspaper was started in 1862, making it the oldest living newspaper in Croatia, and a part of Croatian cultural history. The first issue of Narodni list was published on March 1, 1862, as a Croatian- language part of the Italian-language newspaper Il Nazionale. Since 1876, Narodni list is published entirely in Croatian language, playing an important role in unification of Dalmatia and Croatia. From 1920 to 1946 Narodni list was not published due to Italian fascist government of Zadar and Dalmatia. After the war, Narodni list starts publishing again. At the time there was another Narodni list, daily newspaper published in Zagreb, so the Zadar newspaper was forced to briefly change the name to Glas Zadra (). After the newspaper from Zagreb ceased to exist, Narodni list recovered its name. Environment The city of Zadar is being referred to as the \\"media miracle\\" for its massive number of newspapers, radio and TV stations compared to the population of the city. Zadar is also notorious in Croatia for being a \\"city of corruption\\", and a city where the populist right-wing political party HDZ never lost elections. Narodni list is the only independent media in the city, not related to any political party and not accepting donations of any kind. Editorial policy The newspaper consists of investigative journalism articles (usually targeted against corruption in the city of Zadar), flamboyant columns by in-house journalists and prominent public figures, and many how-to articles about science, technology, lifestyle etc. External links * 1860s establishments in Croatia Weekly newspapers published in Croatia Publications established in 1862 Croatian-language newspapers Mass media in Zadar 1862 establishments in the Austrian Empire ","title":"Narodni list"},{"id":"21343626","text":"Percival Stephen Cane (1881‚Äì1976) was an English garden designer and writer.

As a writer, he published four books on gardening, and owned and published two horticulture magazines. His gardens were firmly in the Arts and Crafts style, and he was a particular admirer of Harold Peto's work.  Selected gardens  Cane began designing gardens around 1919 and within a decade he had become one of the most sought-after designers of his day. His gardens range from the grounds of the Jubilee Palace of Haile Selassie, the Emperor of Ethiopia, in Addis Ababa, to a tiny town garden in Taptonville Road, Sheffield. Other commissions included: * Caythorpe Court in Lincolnshire for Mrs Elma Yerburgh * Ivy House, Hampstead, for Anna Pavlova in 1926 * Llannerch Hall St Asaph, North Wales, 1927‚Äì29 * Hascombe Court, Godalming, 1928‚Äì29 * Boden's Rise, Ascot, in 1929 * the King's House, Burhill in 1935 for the Royal Warrant Holders' Association * the grounds of the British Pavilion at the 1939 New York World's Fair * Dartington Hall for Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst, from 1945 to 1971 * Hungerdown House, Seagry, Wiltshire, 1945‚Äì46 * Falkland Palace, Fife from 1946 * Westfields, Oakley, Bedfordshire, 1953‚Äì64 * Sutton Park, Yorkshire in 1962 * Mellerstain House, Scottish borders * Moundsmere Manor, Basingstoke * Sulgrave Manor, Oxfordshire  Awards and designations  Cane's contributions to important gardens in England are noted in nine entries in the Historic England Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England, which aims to \\"celebrate designed landscapes of note.\\" They are: the 1927 terrace on the hilltop at St Ann's Hill in Chertsey; his embellishments and extensions in the late 1920s to designs by Gertrude Jekyll at Hascombe Court in Godalming; the gardens at Seven Stones House in Kent; advice on the gardens at Ditchingham Hall in Norfolk; 1930s developments to the gardens at Woburn Abbey, Bedfordshire; formal terraced gardens from the 1930s (no longer extant) at Stoneleigh Abbey, Warwickshire; the 1940s Priory gardens at Hedsor House, Buckinghamshire; the tiltyard, hydrangea walk, glade, stone bastion, monumental flight of steps, and other features at Dartington Hall, Devon; and formal terraced gardens installed in 1960 at Sharpham House, Devon. Two gardens wholly or partly designed by Cane in Scotland are designated \\"of national importance\\" and are thus included on the Historic Scotland Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes. His work at Falkland Palace in the late 1940s \\"gives Falkland Palace gardens outstanding value as a Work of Art.\\" The river garden he designed for Monteviot, Jedburgh, in the 1960s contributes to the garden's designation as \\"outstanding.\\" In addition, the gardens designed by Cane are mentioned in the Statement of Special Interest for the listed building at Ardencraig, Rothesay. Cane exhibited show gardens at the Royal Horticultural Society's Chelsea Flower Show over a number of years, winning eight gold medals (in 1936, 1937, 1938, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1951 and 1952) and three silver-gilt (1934, 1935 and 1950).

Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II. New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1999. p109. His violent death at the hands of a starving writer living on the actor's property has been cited by scholars such as John Dower as an example of the chaos and \\"social disintegration\\" in the months and years immediately following Japan's defeat in World War II. Names & Lineage Like most kabuki actors, Nizaemon had a number of stage names over the course of his career. He debuted onstage under his birth name, T≈çkichi Kataoka, and later took on the names Kataoka Tsuchinosuke II and Kataoka Gad≈ç IV before becoming the twelfth in the line of Kataoka Nizaemon. He was the fourth actor to be known by the poetry name (haimy≈ç) Roen, and bore the guild name (yag≈ç) of Matsushimaya. Nizaemon was born into a kabuki family, and was the son of Kataoka Nizaemon X, who in turn was the son of Kataoka Nizaemon VIII. His sons Kataoka Gad≈ç V, Ichimura Yoshigor≈ç II and Kataoka Roen VI followed him, and were active on stage for many years. Life and career Born into a kabuki family, the actor who would later be known as Nizaemon first took the stage in 1885, at the age of three, at the Chitose-za, under his birth name, T≈çkichi Kataoka. His father, Kataoka Nizaemon X, died in 1895; young T≈çkichi took on the name Tsuchinosuke the following year, becoming Kataoka Gad≈ç IV several years later in 1901.Sh≈çriya Aragor≈ç. \\"Kataoka Nizaemon XII.\\" Kabuki21.com. Accessed 31 January 2009. He frequently performed alongside Matsumoto K≈çshir≈ç VII and Ichimura Uzaemon XV, among others, and took part in many premiere and revival performances. He is said to have had a somewhat cold and gloomy acting style earlier in his career, when he frequently played alongside onnagata Onoe Baik≈ç VI, though after Baik≈ç's death, when Nizaemon came to more frequently act alongside Uzaemon XV, his style and apparent mood onstage brightened noticeably; this cold, gloomy personality would return, and served him well, however, as it suited perfectly the mood of certain sewamono roles and plays. Gad≈ç played a young Minamoto no Yoshitsune (known as Ushiwakamaru in the play) in the 1912 debut of the dance drama Hashi Benkei, and would play Yoshitsune again on many occasions in Kanjinch≈ç. He took the name Nizaemon in a sh≈´mei (name succession) ceremony in January 1936. He came to specialize in onnagata roles, i.e. female roles, and those of refined, graceful noblemen such as Yoshitsune is often portrayed. He played the courtesan Agemaki, the chief female role in Sukeroku Yukari no Edo Zakura in a March 1938 performance at the Osaka Kabuki-za. His life and career were cut short, however, when, on 16 March 1946, he and four others in his household were murdered by Toshiaki Iida, in the actor's home. Iida was a writer who had been living in a detached house on the actor's property. Like the great majority of Japanese in the early post-war, Iida was extremely poor and starving. On this particular day, a quarrel erupted between Nizaemon and Iida who envied and resented the actor's relatively lavish lifestyle; it ended with the writer killing Nizaemon, his wife, his infant son, and two maids (included his sister) with a hatchet. Iida was arrested in Miyagi Prefecture on 30 March. Feeble-mindedness was accepted in the trial and he was sentenced to life imprisonment on 22 October 1947.

Adamson was born in Dublin, Republic of Ireland on 21 November 1800 to James Agar Adamson of Ballinalack, County Westmeath and Sarah Walsh of Walsh Park, County Tipperary. He had eight siblings. Adamson was admitted to Trinity College, Dublin in 1817, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1821. After graduation, he became a priest of the Church of Ireland, and in 1824, he became curate of Lockeen and Parsonstown, County Offaly. From 1833 to 1838, he was vicar of Clonlen and Ennis, both in County Clare. While in these parishes in Western Ireland, Adamson learned to enjoy angling, especially salmon fishing, an interest that would shape his life in Canada. In 1838, he became a rector of Kilcooly parish, counties Kilkenny and Tipperary, and chaplain to the Marquess of Normanby, then Whig Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. With the help of Normanby's influence in the Whig ministry, Adamson obtained the incumbency of Amherst Island, Upper Canada, and became the personal chaplain to Lord Sydenham, and tended to him until his death in 1841. Later that year, Adamson became the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada's chaplain and librarian. The position was made a sinecure in 1851, and Adamson held it until 1867, when he became a Senate librarian. He only stayed there for a few months, before resigning. Shortly afterward, Adamson died in Ottawa, Ontario on 7 August 1868. As a preacher, Adamson had been described as \\"one of the most eloquent in North America\\". He was assistant to several churches, including Christ Church Cathedral in Montreal from 1844 to 1850, Holy Trinity Anglican Cathedral in Quebec from 1851 to 1855, and again from 1861 to 1866, and St George's in Toronto, from 1856 to 1860. He held the position of secretary at the Church Society of the Diocese of Quebec, and lectured in the evenings at the Quebec cathedral. He was also an occasional writer, focusing on subjects related to sports and nature. His publications were found in the Dublin University Magazine, Blackwood's Magazine, and other British periodicals. He has also written articles for most Canadian magazines of his time, including the article entitled \\"The decrease, restoration, and preservation of salmon in Canada\\", published in the Canadian Journal in 1857. As an avid fisherman, Adamson wrote on the subject in his book Salmon-fishing in Canada, published in 1860 by Sir James Edward Alexander. Adamson has been described \\"the Izaak Walton of Canada\\". The British Literary Gazette described Adamson as someone who \\"is evidently, as all anglers should be, a true lover of nature, and some of his descriptions of Canadian scenery are given with considerable effect\\". Several universities awarded Adamson honorary Doctor of Civil Law degrees, including McGill University and the University of Bishop's College. He was also noted as a powerful preacher; one publication called him \\"one of the most eloquent in North America\\".

He won all but five counties, and became the only Republican Senate candidate to defeat a Democratic incumbent in 1998.

Moseley Braun was the subject of a 1993 Federal Elections Commission investigation over $249,000 in unaccounted-for campaign funds. The agency found some small violations, but took no action against Moseley Braun, citing a lack of resources. Moseley Braun only admitted to bookkeeping errors. The Justice Department turned down two requests for investigations from the IRS.Slate, Is Carol Moseley-Braun a Crook?\\", February 19, 2003 In 1996, Moseley Braun made a private trip to Nigeria, where she met with dictator Sani Abacha. Despite U.S. sanctions against that country, due to Abacha's actions, the Senator did not notify, nor register her trip with, the State Department. She subsequently defended Abacha's human rights records in Congress.NPR, \\"2004 Democratic Presidential Candidates: Carol Moseley Braun\\", Npr.org, May 6, 2003 Peter Fitzgerald, a State Senator, won the Republican primary, defeating Illinois Comptroller Loleta Didrickson with 51.8% of the vote, to Didrickson's 48.2%.Election Results: General Primary - 3/17/1998, Illinois State Board of Elections. Retrieved October 30, 2016. Fitzgerald spent nearly $7 million in the Republican primary. He had a major financial advantage, as he was a multimillionaire. He ended up spending $12 million in his election victory. In September, Moseley Braun created controversy again by using the word \\"nigger\\" to describe how she claims to be a victim of racism. Most polls over the first few months showed Moseley-Braun trailing badly. However, after she was helped in the final month by notable Democrats such as First Lady Hillary Clinton and U.S. Representative Luis Guti√©rrez, three polls published in the last week showed her within the margin of error, and, in one poll, running even with Fitzgerald.  Results  The incumbent Moseley Braun was narrowly defeated by Republican Peter Fitzgerald. Moseley Braun only won five of Illinois's 102 counties. Despite this, the race was kept close by Moseley running up massive margins in Cook County, home of Chicago. However it wasn't quite enough to win. Fitzgerald would only serve one term in the senate. Fitzgerald initially intended to run for a second term. However, after many Republicans and Democrats announced their intentions to run, Fitzgerald decided to retire. Fitzgerald would serve from January 3, 1999 to January 3, 2005.

In the late nineteenth century it was an important source of building stone in Hamilton, Ancaster and Waterdown,http://www.raisethehammer.org/article/1441/hamilton_building_stone_part_2:_eramosa_dolomite Middleton, G.V., 2011 \\"Hamilton Building Stone, Part 2: Eramosa Dolomite.\\" and in the late twentieth century quarries in a similar unit, also called the Eramosa, near Wiarton in the Bruce Peninsula, became an important source of dimension stone at a time when most of the other resources of similar stone were depleted. Work in these quarries led to the discovery of exceptionally well preserved fossils (the Eramosa lagerst√§tte). On the east Mountain at Hamilton, a well-developed cave system was discovered in the Eramosa and has now been designated as the Eramosa Karst Conservation Area. Stratigraphy The term was first used for a stratigraphic unit by Williams (1915) who named the Eramosa Member (of the Lockport Formation) for the bituminous dolomites exposed below the Guelph Formation along the Eramosa River, northeast of Guelph, Ontario. No detailed description of the type section has ever been published, and the status of the unit has been subject to many different interpretations. Until recently, the Eramosa in Ontario was regarded as the highest Member of the Lockport Formation,Geology of Ontario, v.2, p. 955, 1992 with gradational contacts with the Goat Island Member (below) and the Guelph Formation (above). In 1995, the US Geological Survey U.S.G.S. Bulletin 2086 proposed a revised stratigraphy based on studies in the Niagara region. It extended the Lockport to Group status and included, from base to top, the Gasport, Goat Island, Eramosa, and Guelph as Formations within the Lockport Group. In a \\"reference section\\" in the Niagara River Gorge, the Eramosa was divided into six \\"units\\" recognized throughout the Niagara region, but a shaley lower unit previously named for the Hamilton area (the Vinemount Member) was transferred to the Goat Island Formation. Brunton (2009) has proposed a revision for Ontario which restores the Vinemount Member to the Eramosa and recognizes two other members. Age The exact age and correlation of the Eramosa are still uncertain. Conodonts at first indicated that the Eramosa age was Ludlovian (c.420 Ma), but recent studies of both conodonts Geological Society of America Abstracts with Programs, v.40(5) p.22, 2008 and the Eramosa lagerst√§tte suggest an earlier, late Wenlockian (c.425 Ma) age. Paleoenvironment The rocks forming the Eramosa are mostly dolomites, but the composition varies from almost pure, grey-weathering, fine grained dolomite (at Ancaster) to shaley, bituminous, brown-weathering, bioturbated dolomites. Fossils are common at some localities, scarce at others, and chert is generally a minor component. The most characteristic feature is bituminous shaley interbeds. Probably the Eramosa was deposited in several related environments, most likely including shallow, restricted (and poorly oxygenated) marine waters. Among the fossils, perhaps the most spectacular are the eurypterids, an extinct form of scorpions. Some species lived in fresh or brackish water, but Silurian examples were marine. The exceptionally preserved biota are present in a stratum of rock about 8 m thick, which extends for around 16 km in the South Bruce Peninsula, Ontario.

The leaves are linear or narrowly lance-shaped and one or two centimeters long. The inflorescence is made up of fuzzy dull to bright reddish or purplish pink bracts between which emerge smaller yellowish to greenish flowers. The color of the inflorescence is influenced by the environment of the plant; those with more northern exposures tend to have yellowish flowers and those facing south have more reddish flowers. Like other Castilleja species, this plant parasitizes other species for water and nutrients; C. cinerea is generally found tapping buckwheats (Eriogonum spp.) and sagebrushes (Artemisia spp.). Habitat Castilleja cinerea grows in several habitat types, including dry desert and sagebrush scrub, woodland, and coniferous forest. It is also known from the unique quartzite pebble plain habitat in these mountains, which it shares with other endemics such as Arenaria ursina.Forest Service Fire Ecology Threats The Castilleja cinerea plant is a federally listed threatened species.

She broke into television in 1984, at first in guest roles on such series as Mickey Spillane's Mike Hammer and Hotel, and in a few made-for-TV movies before landing what is perhaps her best known role to date on Showtime's Brothers, in 1986. For the next three seasons of Brothers, Pascal played Sam, the new steady love interest of Joe Waters (Robert Walden), whom he eventually marries at the start of the show's fifth season. Sam became pregnant just before their wedding, and bore Joe a daughter, Caroline, during the season. Outside of and beyond Brothers, Pascal continued to do guest work on syndicated, network and cable TV series, while adding more TV movies to her resume. Her most visible roles in TV films include Blood Vows: The Story of a Mafia Wife (1987), Parker Kane (1990) and Writer's Block (1991). Pascal's last guest appearance was in a 1996 episode of USA Network's Pacific Blue (a series from Brothers producer Gary Nardino). In various credits of hers, she is sometimes billed as Marianne or Mariann, but is most commonly referred to as Mary Ann. Prior to officially joining the cast of Brothers, Pascal actually made guest appearances in the program's first and second seasons, as nearly different characters. In her second season guest shot only, she was credited as Mariann Pascal, but in her original 1984 appearance, as well as during her three-year role as Sam, she was billed as Mary Ann Pascal. In the mid-1980s, after her acting career commenced, Pascal began working as unofficial hostess of the Golden Nugget Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. She regularly commuted back and forth between Las Vegas and Los Angeles for work.https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat;=19880724&id;=r4McAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=ZGMEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=5414,4395387&hl;=en During her time on Brothers, the show made several references to the Golden Nugget in storylines that involved the Sam character. In fact, a multi-episode story arc in the fourth season was partially shot on location at the Golden Nugget when most of the cast (including Pascal) went to Las Vegas. Then, at the end of the show's fifth-season premiere, when Joe and Sam decide to return to Las Vegas for their wedding, Sam asks Joe if they'll have a \\"Golden Nugget nuptial\\".

A member of a substantial naval dynasty, he eventually rose to the rank of vice admiral. Family and early life Richard Dacres was born in September 1761, the fifth son of Richard and Mary Dacres, and younger brother to James Richard Dacres.Tracy (2006), p. 109 The Dacres would eventually become a substantial naval dynasty; James Richard rose to be a vice-admiral, his son Barrington became a post- captain, and James became a vice-admiral. Richard's own son Sydney would eventually be an admiral, and First Sea Lord. American war Dacres himself entered the navy in 1775 to serve aboard the 50-gun fourth rate under Captain Francis Banks. He was present at the evacuation of Boston, the capture of New York ‚Äîserving under Sir Peter Parker‚Äî the occupation of Aquidneck Island, and in various other services. He remained aboard Renown until 1778, when he returned to England and joined the frigate Apollo, under Captain Philemon Pownall, and was present at the capture of the French frigate on 31 January 1779.Marshall (1824), pp. 29‚Äì32 Dacres then served aboard , flagship of Sir Charles Hardy, Commander-in Chief of the Channel Fleet. Hardy promoted Dacres to lieutenant into the frigate , under Captain the Honourable William Finch, with whom he sailed to the West Indies in early 1780. On 10/11 October 1780 Amazon narrowly escaped destruction during a violent hurricane, having to cut down her masts and throw her guns and anchors overboard to prevent the ship from capsizing. Twenty of her crew were drowned or badly hurt. He then served as first lieutenant of the 74-gun , Captain Charles Thompson. He was present with Rear-Admiral Thomas Graves's fleet at the Battle of the Chesapeake in 1781, Rear-Admiral Samuel Hood's fleet at the Battle of St. Kitts in 1782 and Admiral George Brydges Rodney's fleet at the Battle of the Saintes in 1782.

During the Spanish Armament of 1790, Dacres was first appointed to the 64-gun , then to , flagship of now Rear Admiral Sawyer. After the crisis was resolved peacefully, Dacres returned to half-pay until the outbreak of the war with Revolutionary France in February 1793. War with France He was initially given command of the hired armed brig Union; before being appointed first lieutenant of the 74-gun , under the command of Captain John Colpoys. With Hannibal Dacres became part of the squadron despatched under Admiral Alan Gardner to the reinforce the British possessions in the West Indies. Hannibal was put out of commission in early 1794, and he was appointed first lieutenant of the frigate , commanded by Captain W. Sidney Smith, but remained there only a short time before moving to the 90-gun second rate , serving under his old commander, now Rear-Admiral John Colpoys. Dacres was promoted to commander on 10 March 1795 into the 14-gun sloop . While captain of Childers Dacres captured the French Coast guard cutter Vigilante, of six guns, in the Bay of Saint Brieux. On 31 October he was appointed post captain on the 20-gun , which formed part of Richard Strachan's squadron in the English Channel.Winfield (2008), p. 226 In early 1797, Dacres took command of the frigate . He managed to slip away from the mutiny at the Nore, and then escorted a fleet of valuable merchant ships to the Baltic. He captured numerous French and Dutch privateers over the next two years. Astrea was paid off in 1799, and Dacres was again unemployed until early 1801, when he was appointed to command of the 80-gun , accompanying Sir Robert Calder in his voyage to the Caribbean, following Ganteaume's escape from Brest. On his return to England, he was appointed to the 68-gun , guard ship at Spithead, remaining there until the cessation of hostilities in early 1802. He then sailed to Jamaica in with the squadron under Sir George Campbell, but ill-health soon forced him to return home. On the renewal of the war in 1803, Dacres was appointed to command of the Sea Fencibles at Dartmouth. In 1806 Sir W. Sidney Smith specifically requested Dacres join him in the Mediterranean as his flag captain aboard the 80-gun Pompee. In this role Dacres went on to see service in the amphibious operations at Calabria, leading to the Battle of Maida, and later Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's failed Dardanelles Operation and the Alexandria expedition in February 1807.Allen (1852), p. 192 Dacres then returned to England after Pompees recall, arriving in June 1807. He was then ordered to take the Pompee to join Vice-Admiral Henry Stanhope's squadron for service in the second expedition to Copenhagen. He was involved in the subsequent Battle of Copenhagen, where he and the navy provided support for the besieging forces. Later life Dacres returned from the campaign, which proved to be his last command at sea.

As of September 2012, the school has about 185 students and 22 staff members. The school and its parish was established in 1956. History In 1950, Father Steele began the task of building the school on five forested acres in the heart of Haney, now part of the larger district municipality of Maple Ridge. The school was opened in September 1956 with a co-educational enrollment of 128 students encompassing grades one to eight. The Sisters of St. Joseph of London, Ontario, were the first teachers. Sisters Winnifred, Appolonia and Wendelin aided Sister Eugene, the first principal. Initially, only five rooms on the lower floor were available for the students' use, as the upstairs consisted of Father's living quarters, a confessional and a large hall where Mass was said. The students took their gym out of doors year round. Much has changed at the school since its establishment. Kindergarten classes were introduced in 1970. To accommodate a growing enrollment, portable classrooms and the St. Patrick's Centre (gym) were later built. The last sister, Sister Sharon McNally, left in June 1985. The convent was changed into a school annex to include a larger library, a video room and two meeting rooms. A new wing of the school was completed in 2010. The wing has three classrooms and one music room along with separate male and female bathrooms. Religious life=Christian-education philosophy The Christian-education program is designed to foster growth in the student's faith, in the knowledge of their faith, and in the understanding of themselves as Christian people. Prayer is said in the morning as well as at lunch time. Religious-education classes Participation in the religious- education classes is an integral and vital part of the education and formation of each student in the school. It helps lead them to study and learn the history and content of the Catholic faith. The objective remains to create in them a deep and lifelong love for the Church, its sacraments and prayer life. The religious-education classes take place during the school hours. Masses The importance of the Mass is recognized at the school both as a way of increasing the faith of the individual and helping in the building of Christian community. On the first Friday of each month, there is a school Mass in the church. There is an additional Mass for only the primary and intermediate grades once a month. Administration Rev. Father Richard Au STL was the school's pastor from summer 2005 to 2012. He was followed by Rev. Fr Mathew To, the current pastor.

Although not much is known about his life, as a pianist he was regarded as a virtuoso on the level of Ignacy Jan Paderewski, Moriz Rosenthal, Leopold Godowsky, J√≥zef Hofmann, and Josef Lh√©vinne . He also ranked, during the 1920s and 30s, among the greatest and most sought-after keyboard pedagogues of the time.  Life and early career (Madrid, 1868 ‚Äì 1886)  Born in Madrid to German parents Julius Jonas, a businessman, and Doris Sachse, his musical talents were recognized at an early age. King Alfonso XII of Spain received the young child in a private audience at the Royal Palace of Madrid in 1880 and Jon√°s was immediately hailed as a prodigy. He initially studied at the Madrid Royal Conservatory with Manuel Mendiz√°bal (1817‚Äì1896) in piano (Mendiz√°bal had been Isaac Alb√©niz's piano teacher) and Ciriaco Olave in organ, graduating at the age of 12, in 1880. For the next six years he travelled and lived in Belgium, England, Germany, and France studying business, in accordance to his parents' desires for a career in finance, and also giving some public performances. At this time, Jon√°s started also to become a polyglot, mastering fluently the French, Russian, German, English, and Spanish languages.  Brussels, 1886‚Äì1890  In 1886, at the age of 18 and against the will of his parents, who kept trying to dissuade him from pursuing a career as a concert pianist, he entered the Brussels Conservatory, where he studied for four years with noted Franz Liszt pupil Arthur De Greef and composition with Fran√ßois-Auguste Gevaert. According to the Annuaire du Convervatoire Royal de Musique de Bruxelles, he won the coveted First Prize (Premier Prix) of the Brussels Conservatory, in the Piano Section, in 1888, playing Moscheles' G Minor Piano Concerto, a Prelude and Fugue by Bach, and the Caprice Sure Des Airs de Ballet d'Alceste de Gluck, by Saint-Saens. He later won an Honorable Mention in Harmony in the year 1890, the final year of his graduation.  St. Petersburg, Germany, Austria, 1890‚Äì1893  Anton Rubinstein selected Alberto Jon√°s as one of his few pupils. Upon graduating from Brussels in 1890, he entered the first international Anton Rubinstein Competition, which was being held at the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Even though he did not win the coveted First Prize in piano (it went to Nikolay Dubasov), he nevertheless made an extraordinary impression on Anton Rubinstein, who immediately invited him to be one the handful of pianists who had the privilege of being his students. He then worked with Rubinstein in St. Petersburg for the next three years. During his sojourn there, he became a recognized pianist and teacher, and soon befriended fellow Rubinstein students, J√≥zef Hofmann, Felix Blumenfeld, and Teresa Carre√±o, who all held his playing in high esteem. During this period he also met Ignacy Jan Paderewski, who acted as a mentor and gave him some lessons (in particular on his own Piano Concerto in A minor, Op. 17, which Jon√°s would later often perform) and encouraged him to continue his studies in music. In 1891 he made his debut in Berlin as a soloist with the Berlin Philharmonic under Hans von B√ºlow, receiving rave reviews.  United States 1893‚Äì1904  In 1893 he moved to New York, soon making a debut with the Symphony Society of New York in Carnegie Hall playing the Paderewski Concerto conducted by Walter Damrosch. In 1894, he was named professor at the Music School of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, later becoming President and Director of the Michigan Conservatory of Music in Detroit, a post he held until 1904. In 1897 he debuted with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Emil Paur, again with the Paderewski concerto. He also concertized in Canada, Mexico and Cuba at this time. On December 20, 1899, he married German pianist Elsa von Grave in Ann Arbor, who although born in Cologne had been a pupil of Hans von B√ºlow at the Munich Conservatory and was the daughter of the German Baroness Rosalie von Grave and the German Baron Friedrich Wilhelm Mortimer, Baron von Grave (1824‚Äì1896), a captain in the Prussian army. Elsa von Grave had emigrated to the US in 1894, one year after Jon√°s, and they most likely met in Ann Arbor on that same year.  Berlin 1904‚Äì1914  In 1904 Jon√°s decided he would return to Europe, settling in Berlin, where he soon became one of the most respected piano teachers. There he soon became a professor at the Klindworth-Scharwenka Conservatory and befriended Leopold Godowsky, Karl Klindworth, James Kwast and Moritz Moszkowski, who were also teachers and performers there. World War I caused him to return to New York, where he finally settled. It is unclear whether Alberto Jon√°s divorced Elsa von Grave or if she died in the war. By 1914, he was no longer in a marriage to her and began a relationship with an American pianist of German descent, Henrietta Gremmel (1888-1964), whom she later married in 1921. She was from Muscatine, Iowa, the daughter of a German immigrant from Hannover who had established a tobacco business in Muscatine. She was 20 years younger than Alberto Jonas.  United States 1914‚Äì1943  In October 17, 1914, he returned from war-torn Europe to New York, in the company of pianist Henrietta Gremmel (1888-1964), whom he would later marry. From 1914 until his death in 1943, he lived in a New York apartment on the Upper West Side (19 West 85th Street), his apartment becoming a mecca for talented students and pianists from all over the world. Soon, Jon√°s also became professor at the Combs College of Music in Philadelphia, where he kept a small apartment as well, and the Von Ende School of Music in New York. Alberto Jonas died on November 10, 1943, in Philadelphia.  Master School of Modern Piano Playing and Virtuosity  It is during his period in New York when Jon√°s had the unprecedented idea of starting a correspondence with all of the great musicians and pianists he had met throughout his life as a wandering musician, asking them personally to collaborate with their own ideas on pianism towards the publication of a treatise on piano playing that would include the main currents in modern virtuosity. The pianists even agreed to write their own technical exercises specifically for Jon√°s book, as well as sharing their own ideas on technique, pedalling, fingering, practicing methods, phrasing, memorizing, etc., and also taking exclusive photographs of themselves and their hands playing in order to illustrate some points. In the early 1920s he started putting together all the material he had amassed from the correspondence and began writing what he would later title Master School of Modern Piano Playing and Virtuosity, in seven volumes. It took him seven years to complete the vast undertaking (1922‚Äì1929), which in its final formed featured the unique distinction of having the collaboration of practically all the greatest living piano virtuosi. The final contributors were Arthur Friedheim, Ignaz Friedman, Vasily Safonov, Ferruccio Busoni, Katharine Goodson, Leopold Godowsky, Alfred Cortot, Rudolph Ganz, Wilhelm Backhaus, Fannie Bloomfield Zeisler, Ern≈ë Dohn√°nyi, Ossip Gabrilowitsch, Josef Lh√©vinne, Isidor Philipp, Moriz Rosenthal, Emil von Sauer, Leopold Schmidt, and Zygmunt Stojowski, and included excerpts from more than one thousand examples drawn from the entire piano literature in order to illustrate specific points. In breadth of scope, originality, and clearness of execution, the book is unprecedented. It was finally published in 1929 by Carl Fischer Music in New York. Busoni considered it \\"the most monumental work ever written on piano playing\\" in seven volumes: Book I: Finger Exercises Book II: Scales Book III: Arpeggios Book IV: Complete School of Double Notes Book V: Octaves, Staccato, and Chords Book VI: The Artistic Employment of the Piano Pedals Book VII: Exercises for Fingers, Wrists, and Arms Away From the Piano, Phrasing, Embellishments in Music Lh√©vinne called it \\"the greatest and most valuable work on the subject\\", and Rosenthal called it a \\"Master-Work\\" (meisterarbeit). It was also admired by Sergei Rachmaninoff, who mentioned it in some of his letters.  Reception  Due to the impact of the Great Depression and World War II on the publishing industry in America, the Master School was never reprinted and quickly went out of print. The author and his ideas became somewhat forgotten after his death, but there are still pianists and teachers who use volumes of the \\"Master School\\" in their pedagogy. Even though he is the most important Spanish writer on pianism, he is practically unknown in his native country (where the Master School has never been published). Some of Alberto Jon√°s's piano students include Pepito Arriola, Ellen Ballon, Anis Fuleihan, Eugenia Buxton, Vincent Persichetti, Eloise Wood, Daniel Jones, Lewis L. Richards, David Earl Moyer, Leonard Heaton, Alfred Lucien Calzi, Elizabeth Zug, Reah Sadowsky, and Louis Loth.

It was one of five stand-alone casinos awarded a gaming license on December 20, 2006, by the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. The Philadelphia Inquirer states that Stephen Wynn (Graduate and former Trustee of University of Pennsylvania) and Wynn Resorts have signed a non-binding deal to take over the long delayed Foxwoods Casino in Philadelphia.http://www.philly.com/philly/news/breaking/20100223_Steve_Wynn_takes_over_Foxwoods_project.html On October 26, 2010, it was announced that Harrah's Entertainmenthttp://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/cityhall/Foxwoods_Has_Until_Dec_10_To_Close_Harrahs_Deal.html (pending signing final agreement) would buy a one-third stake and be in charge of operations in the casino.

These plans show a two-story, casino located at Columbus Boulevard and Reed Street. The casino will sit back about from Columbus Blvd. Plans include an Asian gaming room, a noodle bar, and a riverfront sports bar under a steakhouse. Parking will be in surface lots with 1,376 spaces. The casino is expected to cost $438-million and will include 1,500 slots and 70 table games. The second phase will include a 2,250-space parking garage located at Columbus Blvd. and Tasker Ave. Harrah's Entertainment failed to meet the deadline and the license was revoked on December 16, 2010. History Originally, it was planned to be located along the Delaware River in South Philadelphia. It was to be built on a site between Tasker and Reed Streets that was to include 3,000 Slot machines, an 1,800 seat showroom, a 4,500 space parking garage, and future expansion to a casino with 5,000 slot machines and a 500-room hotel. In September 2008, residents opposed to the development forced the developers of the Foxwoods Casino to move proposal to The Gallery at Market East. This proposal was endorsed by both Mayor Michael Nutter and Governor Ed Rendell but was opposed by local residents. The original proposal for the Foxwoods Casino at The Gallery at Market East was for a 3,000 slot machine casino on two floors currently occupied by Burlington Coat Factory, forcing that store to relocate. On February 26, 2009, it was announced that the developers were looking into locating their new casino onto three floors of the former Strawbridge's flagship store, which is currently vacant and owned by the Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, the owners of The Gallery. In April 2009, Comcast exec and Foxwoods investor Ed Snider was forced to return campaign contributions to then-Governor Ed Rendell, which was barred by campaign finance laws.\\"Comcast exec‚Äôs political donation being given back\\", Marshall Independent. April 16, 2009. Accessed June 8, 2011 In June 2009, the Center City site began to unravel in the face of opposition from the owner of the buildings top 15 floors. The difficulties Foxwoods has faced in Philadelphia also highlight the challenges of building an urban casino. Casino companies, for the most part, have avoided such plays in the US, sticking to less controversial rural, suburban or riverboat locations, industry observers say. Casino developers almost always face complaints about traffic and the impact on nearby residential areas wherever they build, but such concerns become particularly intense amid densely packed city neighborhoods. In February 2010, Steve Wynn was brought in as the managing partner of the project. The location was returned to its original Waterfront site, and Wynn said that there would be no hotel built on the location. Steve Wynn views Philadelphia as a major feeder market to his Las Vegas resort. The casino will be about from the SugarHouse Casino which is also on the riverfront just north of downtown. On April 8, 2010, Wynn announced that his company was withdrawing from the project, three days after presenting plans for the Foxwoods site to the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board. On December 16, 2010, the Gaming Control Board voted to revoke the casino's license after the venture failed to secure funding.\\"Foxwoods license revoked\\" , The City Paper. December 16, 2011.

Requesting transfer to aviation duty, he began training as an aerial observer on 1 February 1915. On the 13th, those orders were changed to ship him to pilot training. On 6 May 1915, he graduated with his Military Pilot's Brevet. After advanced schooling, he was posted to Escadrille 94 on 5 June 1915.SPAD VII Aces of World War I, p. 10 He was injured in a crash before he saw action. He did not get into combat until March 1916. He was posted to Escadrille 3 to fly Nieuport fighters in June 1916. Although he would later change from his Nieuport 17 to a SPAD VII, in both cases he adorned his aircraft with a Cross of Lorraine on the upper deck, the numeral '12' accompanying a stork on the fuselage, and the nickname 'Papa Dorne' on the side of the cockpit.SPAD VII Aces of World War I, pp. 11, 14, 49, 91 Dorme would score 23 confirmed victories between July 1916 and May 1917, with approximately the same number of combat claims unconfirmed.

He was gravely wounded in action on 20 December 1916. While in hospital recuperating, he was commissioned as a Sous lieutenant on 23 January 1917. He returned to flying duty on 1 March 1917. He died in combat on 25 May 1917, being shot down by Heinrich Kroll of Jagdstaffel 9. Kroll, who was flying an Albatros D.III, noted in his diary that Dorme had fought from 5300 meters down to 800 meters before diving to earth and bursting into fire. Kroll also noted that Dorme was identified by his watch being on his remains.SPAD VII Aces of World War I, p. 19. Dorme had 23 aerial victories officially confirmed. Unconfirmed claims amount to 19 more listings. Dorme was notoriously lax in filing combat claims, sometimes only doing so when prompted by wingmates.SPAD VII Aces of World War I, p. 11. The haphazardness of his victory list has led to speculation that he scored as many as 43 victories, or perhaps even 70 victories.

Controlled from London it was listed on the London Stock Exchange and Australasian exchanges. With the mid-20th century decline of the pastoral sector, particularly where Dalgety held the leading position in the synthetics bedevilled slumping wool trade, new investment was made in different sectors in other countries and Australasian investments sold down until it became a foods and agricultural business of the northern hemisphere. A successful conglomerate its core businesses were badly damaged by the wholesale slaughter of British beef animals following the discovery mad cow disease did, as suspected, move from cattle to humans. In 1996 and 1997 Dalgety sold 75 per cent of its whole business leaving its principal investment in animal (porcine) biotechnology. Renamed PIC International after its own biotech subsidiary it merged in 2005 with a matching (bovine) business Genus plc for a market valuation in the same league as Dalgety had attained in the 1990s. History Until the second half of the 20th century when it moved operations to the Northern Hemisphere and transformed itself into a conglomerate the major portion of Dalgety's business was the Australasian wool trade pioneered by John Macarthur in New South Wales. Dalgety depended on the woolgrowers. Soon after F G Dalgety went into business on his own account Australia's sheep numbers had reached around 20 million. Thirty years later there were more than 100 million but by 1903 by prolonged drought flocks had almost halved and numbers did not come back to 100 million until 1926. By that time UK took about 50 per cent of Australia's total wool exports. UK demand rose during the Second World War but as the war ended it was found the UK government held 10.4 million bales. In conjunction with officials from Australia New Zealand and South Africa a joint arrangement was made in 1945 to ensure its orderly sale and the sale was completed in 1951. Later the same year American demand generated by the outbreak of the Korean War pulled wool prices up to nine times the UK contract price of five years earlier but the following year Australia's returns from wool were halved.Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book Australia, No. 85, 2003 1933 Wool prices continued to fall but bottomed in 1971 when there were a record 180 million sheep, the sheep numbers to some extent compensating for low wool prices. Price stabilisation schemes were organised with Australian government support. That support was withdrawn in 1999. \\"It was during the 1990s that the Australian wool industry came to fully realise that wool is merely one of a number of fibres which apparel makers can choose to use in their garments, and that demand for wool depends significantly on the relative prices of substitute fibres, particularly the high quality but cheap synthetic fibres being produced today.\\"Australian Bureau of Statistics, Year Book 2003, The Wool Industry looking back and looking forward In 1998 synthetics provided 49 per cent of apparel fibres, cotton 42 per cent, cellulosic 5 per cent and wool only 3 per cent. Frederick Dalgety In December 1842 Canadian Frederick Gonnerman Dalgety arrived in Melbourne, first settled in August 1835, as manager of a new firm which he soon bought. By 1848 Dalgety was an independent and well-to-do merchant concentrating on the settlers' trade providing merchandise for the squatters and buying their produce. He visited England in 1849 to strengthen his facilities for both credit and the disposal of colonial produce and returned to Victoria in 1851. In the 1851 gold rush Dalgety continued with general business, enlarged his pastoral trade, sold merchandise to the gold diggers and bought much gold from them. In 1851-55 he made about ¬£150,000 from his gold speculations alone. Dalgety & Company A small flock on a ¬£50 note of 1918 In 1854 Dalgety moved to London to establish the headquarters of his metropolitan-colonial enterprise though at that time it dealt mainly with the Victorian pastoral industry. He took with him as London partner Frederick Du Croz and left Charles Ibbotson as a colonial manager-partner in Geelong. He came back to Victoria in 1857 to establish James Blackwood as another manager- partner in Melbourne but after 1859 he lived permanently in England and his business headquarters remained there to the end of the 20th century. By 1884 Frederick Dalgety had ten partners including managing partners and they had operations in London, Melbourne, Geelong, Launceston, Dunedin, Christchurch and Sydney.

Dalgety continued in active management as largest shareholder and chairman of directors until his death in 1894. He left at least seven stations in New Zealand but his Australian properties had been sold in the 1880s. Dalgety and Company Limited continued to grow after its founder died.

As stock and station agents Dalgety arranged the sale of livestock and maintained a strong merchandise operation. It also operated freight and passenger agencies for leading air and shipping lines. There was a substantial business as insurance agents. Business was carried on at 446 centres; Australia 275, New Zealand 154, Kenya 7, Tanganyika 6, Uganda 3, Zanzibar 1 together with numerous subsidiaries. A United Kingdom subsidiary was developing the group's agricultural and trading interests within the UK. wool store, Mactaggart place, Brisbane built 1926 To shore up declining profit margins various decisions were made. Multi-storey wool stores on valuable sites were sold off and replaced with single storey buildings on city outskirts. The single storey stores allowed the operation of modern more efficient handling machinery but the sale of old stores did not pay for new wool stores and Dalgety raised more capital by issuing debentures to investors in London.

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon decided to run for re- election a third term, but was defeated in the primary against Carol Moseley Braun, who ended up winning the general election. As of 2020, this is the last time a political party won class III Illinois Senate seat in two consecutive elections. Braun (whose victory coincided with Bill Clinton's win in the presidential election and Illinois) made history in this election by becoming the first African-American woman ever elected to the U.S Senate, and also the first African-American elected to the U.S Senate as a Democrat. Primaries were held March 17. Election information The primaries and general elections coincided with those for other federal elections (president and House), as well as those for state offices. Turnout For the primaries, turnout was 35.20%, with 2,064,347 votes cast. For the general election, turnout was 74.84%, with 4,939,557 votes cast. Democratic Primary= Candidates  * Carol Moseley Braun, Cook County Recorder of Deeds and former State Representative * Alan J. Dixon, incumbent U.S. Senator * Albert Hofeld, attorney  Results  Analysis  This defeat shocked observers; at the time no Senator had been defeated in a primary in over a decade and Dixon had a long record of electoral success.

Braun, a black woman and known reformist liberal, got a large share of black, liberal, and women voters (\\"The Year of the Woman\\").

It was discovered by two independent research groups in 2004. Psymberin was found to be highly bioactive as it showed LC50s at nanomolar concentrations against various types of tumors. Biosynthesis The biosynthesis of psymberin became of interest when it was found to have a very similar structure to pederin, a natural product derived from the beetle genus Paederus. This led researchers to investigate the genes of the organism that code for the respective natural product. A trans-AT polyketide synthase cluster, designated as the Psy cluster, contained two large groups of genes coding for two PKSs. The smaller gene group, psyA, encoded a PKS with three modules, while the larger psyD encoded a ten module PKS. This ten module PsyD protein is, to date, the protein with the highest reported number of PKS modules. Large portions of the gene cluster psyD have very close counterparts in the pederin gene clusters. This indicates that psymberin and pederin are both structurally and biosynthetically related. The figure below shows the proposed biosynthesis of psymberin based on analysis of the gene clusters. Roman numerals represent which clade each Ketosynthase domain belongs.

Childhood Hermione Llewellyn was born in Postlip, Gloucestershire, into a wealthy family of Welsh origin. She had an older brother, Griffith Owen (1912‚Äì1933), and two sisters, Cynthia (born 1916) and Daphne (born 1922); \\"I started life as a disappointment ‚Äì because I wasn't a boy\\", she recalled. \\"I continued being a disappointment ‚Äì because I was ugly. Instead of minding, I determined to ride better, run faster, be funnier and give more generous presents than the rest of the family.\\" Their father, Griffith Robert Poyntz Llewellyn, was dashing, popular and extravagant; his lack of caution was to have disastrous consequences, and he lost the family fortune on horses and houses when Hermione was thirteen. \\"We became poor very quickly\\", she reported. Their mother, Emily Constance (n√©e Elwes), became mentally ill during Hermione's childhood and was diagnosed with manic- depression. The family accompanied her to Switzerland for treatment. There was further family tragedy with Owen's death in an air crash. She completed her education at Southover Manor School, in Sussex.Hermione Ranfurly, The Ugly One: the childhood memoirs of Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly, 1913‚Äì1939 (1998), p. 118 Career In 1930 and impoverished, a 17-year-old Hermione moved to London to look for a job. As she noted, she was \\"ill-prepared for life beyond the bounds of a country estate\\", and had no qualifications except \\"good English and good manners.\\" It was the height of the Depression, and there were few available openings, but she managed to obtain a job selling gas appliances for the Gas Light and Coke Company. She had scarcely ever been in a kitchen, and had difficulty giving personal advice to customers. Nevertheless, she became a successful saleswoman and wrote that \\"people seemed to like it when I said: 'Always buy a gas cooker with a large oven, then you can commit suicide with your husband'\\". Hermione took a secretarial course and subsequently found employment in a War Office typing pool. She remained short of money, and though invited to balls and for weekends at country houses, she had to decline, as she could not afford to buy the necessary clothes. In 1937, Hermione went to Australia as secretary to Lord Wakehurst who had been appointed as Governor of New South Wales. On a visit to Canberra, she met Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly, who was aide-de-camp to the Australian Governor-General. The day she returned to England, she found Ranfurly seated on the sofa in her London flat, reading the Sporting Life; the two immediately became engaged, and were married on 17 January 1939. Second World War The Ranfurlys were on a stalking holiday in Scotland when the news came that Nazi Germany had invaded Poland. Cutting short their trip, they returned to London, where a telegram awaited them from Dan's Yeomanry regiment, the Sherwood Rangers, telling him to report to duty in Nottinghamshire. Dan turned to their portly cook-butler, Whitaker, and asked if he was coming too. Hermione recorded that \\"Whitaker sat there looking fat and rather red, and he said, 'To the war my Lord?' and Dan said 'Yes'. And Whitaker said: 'Very good, my Lord,' as though Dan had asked for a cup of coffee.\\" The exchange was to provide the title of Lady Ranfurly's war diaries, which proved to be an unexpected publishing success in the 1990s. On their first wedding anniversary, Lord Ranfurly left with the Sherwood Rangers for a posting to the British- controlled Palestine. Regulations barred wives of the Yeomanry from joining their husbands at the front. However, Hermione ignored the rules, and in February 1940 managed to obtain a passage to Egypt from a shady London travel agent, arriving in Palestine two weeks later.Ranfurly (1994), pp.18‚Äì23 Hermione thought that with her secretarial skills, she would easily find a job in the Middle East. It proved more difficult than expected, and in September 1940 a one-eyed brigadier ordered her forcible repatriation to Britain with other \\"illegal wives\\". Determined not to be separated from her husband, she jumped ship from the RMS Empress of Britain at Cape Town, and succeeded in obtaining an aeroplane ticket back to Egypt by implying to a travel agent that she was a spy on a secret mission. The Empress of Britain was sunk shortly after. On arrival in Cairo, Lady Ranfurly laid low in the flat of her friends Pamela and Patrick Hore-Ruthven, but gradually her return became known. Her actions infuriated the British military authorities, which made finding a job difficult. However, her secretarial skills were in short supply and she was soon recruited to work for the Special Operations Executive office in Cairo. Despite continued opposition from the Army, who failed in an attempt to have British ambassador Sir Miles Lampson remove her passport,Ranfurly (1994), pp.66‚Äì72 she became the highly efficient secretary to George Pollock, the head of the SOE. At first pleased with her job, she quickly became concerned about the SOE's actions, intentions and dubious security and finances, and considered that the organisation was working \\"across, if not against, the war effort\\". In March 1941, she expressed her concerns to the visiting Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and in May to General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief for the Middle East. Wavell could take no direct action since SOE did not come under the War Office, but sharing her concerns, he asked her to pass on any documents that aroused her suspicion. She achieved this by stealing questionable documents from the office each evening, typing a copy of them and then returning the originals to their positions the next morning. Her subterfuge led directly to a major reorganisation of SOE Cairo in the summer of 1941. In April 1941, Dan Ranfurly was reported missing after the Battle of Tobruk, and Hermione had no knowledge about whether he was living or dead until she received a letter from him five months later. He remained a prisoner of war in Italy for three years, escaping in 1944 following the Italian armistice. In the interim, Lady Ranfurly received special permission to remain in the Middle East from General Wavell, and worked first as a personal assistant to Sir Harold MacMichael, the High Commissioner in Palestine, and later to General Henry Maitland Wilson, the Supreme Allied commander in the Mediterranean. She was renowned for the tenacity of her desire not to return to England, and General Wilson described Hermione as having \\"outmanoeuvred every general in the Middle East\\" to achieve her goal.Ranfurly (1994), p. 103 Between 1941 and 1944, Hermione Ranfurly lived in Cairo, Jerusalem, Baghdad and Algiers, and met many of famous names who passed through the region, including Lady Diana Cooper, Antoine de Saint Exup√©ry, Sir Walter Monckton, Gaston Palewski, and No√´l Coward. She shared a house in Baghdad with Freya Stark, took General George S. Patton shopping in Cairo, dined with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Algiers, and helped fix General Bernard Montgomery's beret, though she did not think much of the \\"corny Englishman\\" complaining that he \\"would drop his macintosh on the floor and then shout at someone to pick it up.\\"Ranfurly (1994), pp. 158, 194‚Äì5, 206, 221 She dined with kings: Peter II of Yugoslavia, Farouk of Egypt and the future Paul of Greece. She befriended a number of intelligence and Special Air Service officers, including Orde Wingate, Fitzroy Maclean, David Stirling and Bill Stirling, and was taught to shoot by a mysterious red-faced man called \\"Abercrombie\\" so as to be able to do her part against the Germans.Ranfurly (1994), pp. 68, 93, 98 By the end of the war, she likely knew more secrets than any other civilian in the area. Dan Ranfurly was reunited with his wife in Algiers in May 1944, and after a brief trip to England, Hermione resumed her work as secretary to General Wilson in Algiers and Caserta, Italy, while her husband joined Fitzroy Maclean's liaison mission to Yugoslavia.Ranfurly (1994), pp. 248, 251, 221 Hermione was well- positioned for more noteworthy encounters: she taught Admiral Henry Kent Hewitt to dance the Boomps-a-Daisy, and received Marshal Josip Broz Tito for tea: \\"he was short and stocky and dressed to kill\\" according to the hostess. In November 1944, Hermione Ranfurly accepted General Wilson's request that she continue as his secretary when he moved to Washington, D.C. to be head of the British Joint Staff Mission. He rescinded his offer at the last moment, leaving Hermione without a job, luggage or reference.Ranfurly (1994), pp. 302‚Äì306, 313 With Dan Ranfurly in Rome, she managed to find a job working for Air Marshal John Slessor, first in Naples and later in London, where she celebrated VE Day by emptying five wastepaper baskets of Slessor's \\"more boring papers\\" out of the window.Ranfurly (1994), pp. 324, 356‚Äì7 Post war At the end of the war, Dan Ranfurly obtained a job in insurance at Lloyd's of London, and later farmed in Buckinghamshire, while Hermione attempted to put her wartime letters and diaries in order while seated on the sitting room floor. The writer Peter Fleming, an old friend, arranged for her to get a contract for their publication; however, Hermione got cold feet, and repaid the advance nine days later. A daughter, Lady Caroline, was born in 1948. On 20 October 1953, Lord Ranfurly was appointed Governor of the Bahamas by Winston Churchill. Hermione took a great interest in all aspects of Bahamian life, and was concerned by the lack of books in libraries and schools. She asked friends to send unwanted volumes, a project that was to become the Ranfurly Library Service in Nassau. The couple also founded a children's home. When the Ranfurlys returned to the United Kingdom in 1957, Lady Ranfurly extended the Ranfurly Library Service project to other developing countries short on English books; the organisation later changed its name to Book Aid International. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year Honours. Lord Ranfurly died of cancer in 1988, and the Countess continued to work her diaries in Buckinghamshire. Her old friend and neighbour Lord Carrington read her work, and with his help To War With Whitaker was published in 1994. The diaries were an immediate success, and one reviewer noted that they offered \\"a madcap, aristocratic window behind the lines of war\\". Encouraged by its success, she published a memoir of her childhood, The Ugly One, in 1998. Lady Ranfurly enjoyed her old age, noting \\"you have so many more memories than when you are young\\". She died at her home in Buckinghamshire on 11 February 2001 at the age of 87.

Situated in the neighborhood of Volvat in Vestre Aker borough of Oslo, Norway, it was the sole underground station on the western part of the metro. It was located from Stortinget. The station opened on 7 November 1912 at ground level, located at the level crossing with S√∏rkedalsveien. Due to increasing traffic, the line was placed in a culvert under the road in 1939. Trains along the R√∏a Line stopped calling at the station from 5 February 1995, since that line was upgraded to longer trains. The same happened with the Kols√•s Line from 7 April 1997, after which the station was closed. The operated deemed the cost of upgrading the station not to be worth it. History Volvat took its name from pharmacist Harald Thaulow (1815‚Äì81), who owned the farm during his lifetime. The name is a slight simplification of his surname backwards. From the 1900s the area was regulated for housing, making it an interesting site for the tram company Akersbanerne. The R√∏a Line past Volvat opened on 7 November 1912, and a station was built at ground level av Volvat.Aspenberg (1995): 10 From the construction of the tunnel and underground station Volvat was the site of a level crossing between the metro and S√∏rkedalsveien. This eventually created difficulties for the road traffic and Holmenkolbanen therefore decided to build an underground section of line part of the way between Volvat and Majorstuen. The new station opened in 1939.. This remained the only underground station west of the Common Tunnel until after the station closed.Aspenberg (1995): 54 Remains of a mural at Volvat, August 2011 The connection of the eastern and western metro network in the early 1990s meant that the R√∏a Line was to be upgrades to metro standard. This meant that platforms were to be extended to to allow six-car metro trains. In addition to a complete renovation of the tracks, this meant that the overhead wires were replaced with a third rail. The Kols√•s Line would for the mean-time be retained with the old system. The upgraded R√∏a Line started using three-car trains, while two-car trains continued to run to Kols√•s. Oslo Sporveier concluded that the tunnel did not make it worthwhile to expand the platforms. From 5 February 1995 the station was therefore only served by trains along the Kols√•s Line. The station was closed on 7 April 1997, when three-car trains started running on the Kols√•s Line. Facilities Volvat was an underground rapid transit station situated on the R√∏a Line, from Stortinget in the city center. Volvat was located at the intersection between the metro line and S√∏rkedalsveien. It featured two side platforms, each long enough for two-car trains.

The music, in F major, is set for three singers. The words are probably by Mozart himself.Preface to Neue Mozart Ausgabe edition (External link below) The work was entered by the composer into his personal catalog on 2 September 1788 as part of a set of ten canons; it was probably written some time during the years 1786‚Äì87.Source: Preface to the NMA edition. The honoree of the canon, Johann Nepomuk Peierl (see below) lived in Vienna only between late 1785 and 1787. Text Although some of the canons in the 1788 set have serious (that is, religious) lyrics, K. 559 was evidently meant entirely for fun. The work features two bilingual puns and some scatological humor. The lyrics are‚Äîostensibly‚Äîin Latin, though as they are given in sequence they do not make sense in this language: > Difficile lectu mihi mars et jonicu difficile The humor of the work consists of hearing these words instead as vulgar phrases of German and Italian. The German pun is based on the strong Bavarian accent of the tenor-baritone Johann Nepomuk Peyerl (1761‚Äì1800), who can be presumed to have been the lead singer in the first performance (see below). As Jean-Victor Hocquard points out, the pseudo-Latin lyrics lectu mihi mars, as Peyerl would have sung them, resemble Bavarian German leck du mi im Arsch,Hocquard (1999, 203) which in a literal English rendering is \\"[you] lick me in the arse\\". More idiomatically, the phrase could be translated \\"kiss my arse\\" (American English \\"kiss my ass\\").For discussion of the German idiom, see Leck mich im Arsch.Hocquard's explanation presumes a dialectal pronoun mi \\"me\\". Copeman and Scheer (1996, 262) note that the Latin pronoun mihi was sometimes pronounced by German singers as , which would have been a good match for Standard German mich. The second pun in the canon is based on the single Latin word jonicu. Emanuel Winternitz explains that when this word is sung repeatedly and rapidly, as in the canon, its syllables are liable to be heard as the Italian word cujoni, or in modern writing coglioni, meaning \\"balls, testicles\\".Winternitz (1958)The Standard Italian version of this word is \\"coglioni\\", the variant \\"cujoni\\" was maybe used around Mozart's time or is a dialect variant; thus it appears in a jokingly-worded letter from Beethoven to one of his publishers; his translator Emily Anderson explains it thus: \\"Beethoven is trying to say ... \\"coglioni\\". The word was also uttered by Napoleon Bonaparte while rallying his troops. Sources: Emily Anderson (1985) The Letters of Beethoven, Vol. 2. Macmillan, p. 845; Oscar Browning (1907) The Fall of Napoleon. J. Lane, p. 25. Also the transformation of the word might have been slang or youth speak, in order to hide the true meaning to the non- initiated. The line thus translates as \\"It is difficult to lick my arse and balls\\". Michael Quinn writes, \\"Mozart clearly relished the incongruity resulting from ribald verse set as a canon, traditionally regarded as the most learned of all compositional techniques.\\"Quinn (2007, 59) First performance A tale concerning how the canon was composed and first sung was offered by Gottfried Weber, a musicologist and editor of the early 19th century. In an 1824 issue of Caecilia, the journal he edited, Weber published a facsimile of the original manuscript of the canon (see figure above). In his commentary, Weber included the following. > The story is as follows. The otherwise outstanding Peierl had a number of > remarkable idiosyncrasies of pronunciation, which Mozart often poked fun of > in friendly interactions with him and with other friends. One evening, at a > merry gathering, Mozart had the idea of writing a canon in which the few > Latin words \\"Difficile lectu\\" etc. would emerge in Peyerl's pronunciation in > a comical way, with the expectation that he would not notice this and would > be fooled. At the same time, on the reverse side of the same sheet of paper > Mozart wrote the mocking canon \\"O du eselhafter Peierl\\" (\\"Oh, you asinine > Peierl\\"), K. 560a. The joke succeeded. After the strange Latin words had > emerged from Peyerl's mouth in the anticipated comical way‚Äîto the > satisfaction of all present‚ÄîMozart turned over the page, and had the group, > instead of applauding, sing the triumphal mocking canon \\"O du eselhafter > Peierl\\".Original German: \\"Die Geschichte aber ist folgende. Der sonst > treffliche Peierl hatte einige wunderliche Eigenheiten der Wortausprache, > √ºber welche Mozart in freundlichem Umgange mit ihm und anderen Freunden, oft > schertze. Am einem Abende solchen fr√∂hlichen Beisammenseins kam Mozarten der > Einfall, ein Paar lateinische W√∂rter Difficile lectu mihi u.s.w. bei deren > Absingen Peierls Aussprache in komischem Lichte hervortreten musste, zu > einem Canon zu verarbeiten; und, in der Erwartung, dass dieser die Absicht > nicht merken und in die Falle gehen werde, schrieb er gleich auf der > R√ºckseite desselben Blattes den Spottkanon: O! du eselhafter Peierl!. Der > Scherz gelang, und kaum waren jene wunderlichen lateinischen Worte aus > Peierls Munde in der erwarteten komischen Weise zu allgemeinen Behagen > geh√∂rt worden, so drehete Mozart das Blatt um, und liess nun die > Gesellschaft, statt Applaus, den kanonischen Triumph- und Spottgesang > anstimmen: O! du eselhafter Peierl!. Weber does not say where his story came from. For more on Mozart's habit of favoring his friends with vulgar mockery, see Joseph Leutgeb. Autograph The autograph (original manuscript copy) has survived; it is a \\"tiny slip of paper\\" (Searle) on the reverse side of which is‚Äîas Weber noted‚Äîthe original copy of K. 560a. In a number of places the lyrics are blurry and difficult to read, a condition Weber attributed to stray droplets of champagne.Weber 1824, 179 A nineteenth-century scholar, thought perhaps to be Weber, repaired the manuscript by attaching new paper to its right edge, and on the added material wrote \\"Originalhandschrift von Mozart\\", that is, \\"original manuscript by Mozart\\". The manuscript can be traced through various auctions in Germany in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1922 it became part of the collections of the Austrian author Stefan Zweig, and in 1986 was given along with the rest of Zweig's collections to the British Library, where it currently resides.For this paragraph see Searle (1986) and the images at British Library website. A sketch for K. 559 is also preserved; its existence suggests that, contrary to what Weber recounted, Mozart must have planned his joke in advance. Both the autograph and the sketch can be viewed at the NMA website; see External Links below.

Cinema Prague are a band whose combination of humour, funk, thrash and Zappa- esque arrangements made them one of the most entertaining and musically dexterous bands to ever come from Perth. Although the band never reached the international fame of some of their contemporaries, such as Jebediah or Beaverloop, they remain one of the more revered bands in Western Australian musical history and are regularly cited by younger bands as an influence. Biography Initially formed as a four piece in 1986, when some of the members were still at high school, the band had little success to start with. Kailis went to South Perth Primary School, whilst Lowe and Horan went to Attadale Primary School. Horan went on to Perth Modern School participating in their music programme, whilst Lowe and Kailis attended Applecross Senior High School. By early 1988, after some member and name shuffling, the three-piece band, Cinema Prague came into existence. In 1990 the band undertook their first tour of the eastern states of Australia. Their debut recording was a cassette-single with the songs \\"Mushroom Cloud\\" and \\"Walking Song\\", released in November 1991. It was followed much later by their debut album, Meldatype, which was recorded between 1992 and 1994 and released in March 1995. The band's next release was a five track EP, ¬°Zasph! which was released in November 1996. Cinema Prague's third album, Nordensort, was released in May 1998 although it was actually recorded in June/July 1995. In 1997, after returning from Perth following their 'Idiots Crusade' tour of Europe and South Africa they recorded three tracks \\"We are the Moo Moo\\", \\"The Curse of the Shiny Head\\" and \\"Bacon and Eggs Part Two\\" at Poons Head Studio. The band's fourth album It's Schnapster, although recorded in 1990, was released in December 1998 whilst the band was in hiatus. Horan having headed to Britain, where he still performs as well as runs musical workshops for under-age offenders in prisons. Kailis and Lowe played together in various projects, including Rice. They also undertook further studies, with Lowe studying engineering and Kailis studying architecture. In 2007 they re-formed for a show with a new bassist Roy Martinez (Dave Mann Collective) and a plan was hatched to release the old recordings as part of a new album, Snakes Alive, the band's first in over eight years. Snakes Alive was released on 30 January 2009. In an interview at the time, Kailis indicated that the band was planning to work on the new album. In support of the album's release the band gave a number of performances in Perth and Melbourne in early 2009. As of May 2019 Cinema Prague's discography is now available on Bandcamp. In July 2019 the band reformed for a sold out show at Fremantle Town Hall as part of the Fremantle Festival.

He possessed a flexible and strong voice that was particularly suited to the French and Italian operatic repertoire. Beginning in 1853, he sang for more than thirty years at the Hofoper (now the Vienna State Opera), particularly excelling in works by Giacomo Meyerbeer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Giuseppe Verdi. He notably portrayed the role of King Solomon in the world premi√®re of Karl Goldmark‚Äôs Die K√∂nigin von Saba in 1875.{Elizabeth Forbes: \\"Johann Nepomuk Beck\\", Grove Music Online ed. L. Macy (Accessed January 31, 2009), (subscription access) Biography Born at Budapest, Beck first trained as a theology student there but was an active member of the choral society. During a touring season at Budapest from the Vienna Hofoper in about 1847, he sought advice over his 'splendid baritone' voice from the bass Karl Formes and tenor Josef Erl. Formes coached him in the role of Riccardo in I puritani and performed the opera with him in the same season.Karl Formes, My Memoirs (Privately published, San Francisco 1892), p.74. Read online. He then studied singing in Vienna and made his professional opera d√©but as the Speaker in Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te at the Hofoper in 1851. He spent the next two years in short commitments at the opera houses in Hamburg, Bremen, Cologne, D√ºsseldorf, Mainz, W√ºrzburg and Wiesbaden. He also sang in several operas in Frankfurt including Friedrich of Telramund in Lohengrin (1852) and in the German premiere of Ambroise Thomas's Le songe d'une nuit d'√©t√© (1853).Biography of Johann Nepomuk Beck at operissimo.com (in German) In 1853, Beck was hired as a member of the company at the Hofoper where he sang roles for more than the next three decades. He notably performed the title role in Mozart's Don Giovanni for the opening of the new opera house in 1869. He also sang the role of Hans Sachs in Vienna's first performance of Wagner's Die Meistersinger in 1870 and the role of King Solomon in the world premi√®re of Karl Goldmark‚Äôs Die K√∂nigin von Saba in 1875. His other opera roles included Pizarro in Beethoven's Fidelio, Alfonso in Donizetti's Lucrezia Borgia, the title role in Donizetti's Belisario, N√©lusko in Meyerbeer's L‚ÄôAfricaine, Tsar Peter in Meyerbeer's L'√©toile du nord, Count Almaviva in Mozart's Le nozze di Figaro, the title role in Rossini's William Tell, King Froila in Franz Schubert's Alfonso und Estrella, Don Carlo in Verdi's Ernani, and the title role in Verdi's Rigoletto among others. His last opera performance was as Mik√©li in Luigi Cherubini's Les deux journ√©es in 1885. In the late 1880s, Beck began to show signs of mental instability and was hospitalized in a mental institution in Inzersdorf.

Northeast Kingdom Community Action increases public awareness of the concerns of the homeless. Two radio stations, WMOO and WIKE, hold a three-day, 24-hour, on-air fundraiser to benefit Northeast Kingdom Community Action. Since that time, however, the ownership of these radio stations has changed. In 2008, Northeast Kingdom Community Action tried to convert a building to a transitional shelter for parolees in Newport. In the winter of 2003‚Äì2014, Northeast Kingdom Community Action provided fuel assistance to 461 applicants, and denied 206 because they did not meet income criteria. History The organization was originally named Orleans County Council of Social Agencies (OCCSA), founded as a Community Action Program in 1965 as part of the War on Poverty. It was headquartered at the Old Customs building on Main Street in Newport. OCCSA founded a spectrum of agencies which still exist: Rural Community Transportation, Northern Communities Investment Corporation, and Gillman Housing, among others. The original executive director of OCCSA had political difficulties with the then-governor of Vermont, Richard Snelling, who had been born out-of-state, in Pennsylvania. When talking to a newspaper reporter, OCCSA's executive director called the governor a \\"porky flatlander\\". OCCSA was subsequently dismantled and the director moved to a western state. Northeast Kingdom Community Action was established in 1980 as a successor to OCCSA. When NEKCA attempted to rezone a St. Johnsbury building for transitional housing for parolees, neighbors objected, as did the local newspaper. Attempting to reverse the rezoning, 13 litigants took Northeast Kingdom Community Action to Environmental Court in 2007. The litigants' petition was denied in 2009. When they discovered that Newport police were recording conversations between Northeast Kingdom Community Action's victim advocates and victims, four advocates resigned, two dismissed, for going public with the information.

Explanatory models do not claim to be a complete description/explanation of the absolute about the thing/phenomenon, nor do they even claim to, necessarily, be fully accurate.

It is made by layering slices of buttered bread scattered with raisins in an oven dish, over which an egg custard mixture, made with milk or cream and normally seasoned with nutmeg, vanilla or other spices, is poured. It is then baked in an oven and served. Variations Brown Bread and Butter Pudding Some people may serve it with custard or cream, but often the pudding under the crust is moist enough to be eaten without sauce. It is traditional to use stale bread. Sometimes raspberry, strawberry, blackberry or mixed fruit jam, marmalade, or other sweet preserves will be spread upon the bread, along with the butter. Other modern variations include scattering fresh grapes between the layers of bread, melting apples into the egg-milk mixture, and using unusual types of breads, such as brioche, to make it. Lemon or orange peel will add a characteristic flavour. Another variation of the pudding, perhaps in its most simplest form, is to serve custard & bread. History The earliest bread and butter puddings were called whitepot and used either bone marrow or butter. Whitepots could also be made using rice instead of bread, giving rise to the rice pudding in British cuisine. One of the earliest published recipes for a bread and butter pudding so named is found in Eliza Smith's The Compleat Housewife of 1728. She instructs \\"Take a two penny loaf, and a pound of fresh butter; spread it in very thin slices, as to eat; cut them off as you spread them, and stone half a pound of raisins, and wash a pound of currants; then put puff-paste at the bottom of a dish, and lay a row of your bread and butter, and strew a handful of currants, a few raisins, and some little bits of butter, and so do till your dish is full; then boil three pints of cream and thicken it when cold with the yolks of ten eggs, a grated nutmeg, a little salt, near half a pound of sugar, and some orange flower-water; pour this in just as the pudding is going into the oven\\".The compleat housewife: or, accomplished gentlewoman's companion: being a collection of upwards of five hundred of the most approved receipts ... With copper plates ... To which is added, a collection of near two hundred family receipts of medicines: ... By E---- S----. Second Edition, 1728, p81 In 1845, Eliza Acton suggests giving \\"a good flavour of lemon-rind and bitter almonds, or of cinnamon, if preferred, to a pint of new milk\\", then adding cream and sugar, thickened with beaten eggs. Her recipe also calls for a glass of brandy to be added to the mixture.Acton, Eliza. Modern Cookery for Private Families, 1845 In American cuisine it may be called \\"Cold Bread Pudding\\".

The city was founded in 1860 as a Russian military outpost after the Treaty of Aigun and the Convention of Peking with the Qing dynasty. In 1872, the main Russian naval base on the Pacific Ocean was transferred to the city, and thereafter Vladivostok began to grow. After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution in 1917, Vladivostok was occupied in 1918 by foreign troops, the last of whom were not withdrawn until 1922, by that time the anti- revolutionary White Army forces in Vladivostok promptly collapsed, and Soviet power was established in the city. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Vladivostok became the administrative centre of Primorsky Krai. Vladivostok is the largest Russian port on the Pacific Ocean, and the chief economic, scientific and cultural centre of the Russian Far East, as well as an important tourism centre in Russia.

History= Foundation  Steamship-corvette \\"America\\" on the Golden Horn Bay For a long time, the Russian government was looking for a stronghold in the Far East; this role was played in turn by the settlements of Okhotsk, Ayan, Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, and Nikolaevsk-on-Amur. By the middle of the 19th century, the search for the outpost had reached a dead end: none of the ports met the necessary requirement: to have a convenient and protected harbor, next to trade routes.Turmov G.P., Khisamutdinov A.A. Vladivostok. Historical guide. - M .: Veche, 2010. - 304 p. - . The Aigun Treaty was concluded by the forces of the Governor-General of Eastern Siberia Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky, an active exploration of the Amur region began, and later, as a result of the signing of the Treaty of Tientsin and the Convention of Peking, the territory of modern Vladivostok were annexed to Russia. The very name Vladivostok appeared in the middle of 1859, was used in newspaper articles and denoted a bay. On June 20, (July 2) 1860 the transport of the Siberian Military Flotilla \\"Mandzhur\\" under the command of Lieutenant-Commander Alexei Karlovich Shefner delivered a military unit to the Golden Horn Bay to establish a military post, which has now officially received the name of Vladivostok.Old Vladivostok. / Auth. text and comp. B. Dyachenko. - Vladivostok: Morning of Russia, 1992. - P. 51. - 36,000 copies. - .  19th century - early 20th century  On October 31, 1861, the first civilian settler, a merchant, Yakov Lazarevich Semyonov, arrived in Vladivostok with his family. On March 15, 1862, the first act of his purchase of land was registered, and in 1870 Semyonov was elected the first head of the post, and a local self-government emerged. By this time, a special commission decided to designate Vladivostok as the main port of the Russian Empire in the Far East. In 1871, the main naval base of the Siberian Military Flotilla, the headquarters of the military governor and other naval departments were transferred from Nikolaevsk-on-Amur to Vladivostok. General view of Vladivostok, 1880 In the 1870s, the government encouraged resettlement to the South Ussuri region, which contributed to an increase in the population of the post: according to the first census of 1878, there were 4163 inhabitants. The city status was adopted and the city Duma was established, the post of the city head, the coat of arms was adopted, although Vladivostok was not officially recognized as a city. Due to the constant threat of attack from the Royal Navy, Vladivostok also actively developed as a naval base. Svetlanskaya and Aleutskaya streets in the 1910s In 1880, the post officially received the status of a city. The 1890s saw a demographic and economic boom associated with the completion of the construction of the Ussuriyskaya branch of the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Chinese-Eastern Railway. According to the first census of the population of Russia on February 9, 1897 roughly 29,000 inhabitants lived in Vladivostok, and ten years later the city's population tripled. The first decade of the 20th century was characterized by a protracted crisis caused by the political situation: the government's attention was shifted to Port Arthur and the Port of Dalny. As well as the boxing uprising in North China in 1900‚Äì1901, the Russo-Japanese War of 1904‚Äì1905, and finally the first Russian revolution led to stagnation in the economic activity of Vladivostok. Since 1907, a new stage in the development of the city began: the loss of Port Arthur and Dalny again made Vladivostok the main port of Russia on the Pacific Ocean. A free port regime was introduced, and until 1914 the city experienced rapid growth, becoming an important economic centre in the Asia-Pacific, as well as an ethnically diverse city with a population exceeding over 100,000 inhabitants: during the time ethnic Russians made up less than half of the population, and large Asian communities developed in the city. The public life of the city flourished; many public associations were created, from charities to hobby groups.  World War I, Revolution and Occupation  Map of Vladivostok, 1911 During World War I, no active hostilities took place in the city. However, Vladivostok was an important staging post for the import of military-technical equipment for troops from allied and neutral countries, as well as raw materials and equipment for industry. Immediately after the October Revolution in 1917, during which the Bolsheviks came to power, the Decree on Peace was announced, and as a result of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk concluded between the Bolshevik government of Russia and the Central Powers, led to the end of Soviet Russia's participation from World War I. On October 30, the sailors of the Siberian Military Flotilla decided to \\"rally around the united power of the Soviets\\", and the power of Vladivostok, as well as all of the Trans- Siberian Railway passed to the Bolsheviks.

Vladivostok became the staging point for the Allies' Siberian intervention, a multi-national force including Japan, the United States, and China; China sent forces to protect the local Chinese community after appeals from Chinese merchants. The intervention ended in the wake of the collapse of the White Army and regime in 1919; all Allied forces except the Japanese withdrew by the end of 1920. American troops marching on Vladivostok following the Allied Intervention in the Russian Civil War, 1918 Throughout 1919 the region was engulfed in a partisan war. To avoid a war with Japan, with the filing of the Soviet leadership, the Far Eastern Republic, a Soviet-backed buffer state between the Soviet Russia and Japan, was proclaimed on April 6, 1920. The Soviet government officially recognized the new republic in May, but in Primorye a riot occurred, where significant forces of the White Movement were located, leading to the creation of the Provisional Priamurye Government, with Vladivostok as its capital. In October 1922, the troops of the Red Army of the Far Eastern Republic under the command of Ieronim Uborevich occupied Vladivostok, displacing the White Army formations from it. In November, the Far Eastern Republic liquidated, and became a part of Soviet Russia.  Soviet period  By the time of the establishment of Soviet power, Vladivostok was in decline: the retreating forces of the Japanese army removed all material values from the city. Life was paralyzed: there was no money in the banks, the equipment of enterprises was plundered. Due to mass emigration and repression, the city's population decreased to 106,000 inhabitants. During 1923 to 1925, the government adopted a plan of the \\"three-year restoration\\", during which the commercial port was resumed, which became the most profitable in the country in 1924 to 1925. The recovery period was distinguished by its peculiarities: the Russian Far East did not find war communism, but immediately fell into the situation of the New Economic Policy. In 1925, the government decides to accelerate the industrialization of the country. The first five-year plans changed the face of Primorye, making it an industrial region, partly as a result of the creation of numerous concentration camps in the region. In the 1930s-1940s, Vladivostok served as a transit point on the route of delivering prisoners and cargo for the Sevvostlag of the Soviet super-trust Dalstroy. The notorious Vladivostok transit camp was located in the city. In addition, in the late 1930s-early 1940s, the Vladivostok forced labor camp (Vladlag) was located in the area of Vtoraya Rechka railway station. Vladivostok was not a place of hostilities during the Great Patriotic War, although there was a constant threat of attack from Japan. In the city, the first in the country, the \\"Defense Fund\\" was created, to which the residents of Vladivostok carried personal values. During the war years Vladivostok handled imported cargo (lend-lease) almost four times more than Murmansk and almost five times more than Arkhangelsk. The city centre of Vladivostok in 1982 By the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union \\"Issues of the Fifth Navy\\" dated August 11, 1951, a special regime was introduced in Vladivostok (it began to operate on January 1, 1952); the city becomes closed to foreigners. It was planned to remove from Vladivostok not only foreign consulates, but also the merchant and fish fleet and transfer all regional authorities to Voroshilov (now Ussuriysk). However, these plans were not implemented. During the years of the Khrushchev Thaw, Vladivostok received special attention from state authorities. For the first time, Nikita Khrushchev visited the city in 1954 to finally decide whether to secure the status of a closed naval base for him. It was noted that at that time the urban infrastructure was in a deplorable state. In 1959, Khrushchev visited the city again. The result is a decision on the accelerated development of the city, which was formalized by the decree of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union on January 18, 1960. During the 1960s, a new tram line was built, a trolleybus was launched, the city became a huge construction site: residential neighborhoods were being erected on the outskirts, and new buildings for public and civil purposes were erected in the center. In 1974, Gerald Ford paid an official visit to Vladivostok, to meet with Leonid Brezhnev, becoming the first President of the United States to visit the Soviet Union. Both sides signed the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which helped to contain the nuclear arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. On September 20, 1991, Boris Yeltsin signed decree No. 123 \\"On the opening of Vladivostok for visiting by foreign citizens\\", which entered into force on January 1, 1992, ceasing Vladivostok to be a closed city.  Modern period  In 2012, Vladivostok hosted the 24th APEC summit. Leaders from the APEC member countries met at Russky Island, off the coast of Vladivostok.Levy, Clifford J. \\"Crisis or Not, Russia Will Build a Bridge in the East,\\" New York Times. 20 April 2009. With the summit on Russky Island, the government and private businesses inaugurated resorts, dinner and entertainment facilities, in addition to the renovation and upgrading of Vladivostok International Airport. Two giant cable-stayed bridges were built in preparation for the summit, the Zolotoy Rog bridge over the Zolotoy Rog Bay in the center of the city, and the Russky Island Bridge from the mainland to Russky Island (the longest cable-stayed bridge in the world). The new campus of Far Eastern Federal University was completed on Russky Island in 2012.

Winters in particular are around colder than on the mildest coastlines this far north, and are considerably colder than locations on the North American east coast at similar latitudes such as Halifax, Nova Scotia and Portland, Maine. In winter, temperatures can drop below while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.

The last meeting of the Vladivostok City Duma took place on October 19, 1922, and on October 27 it was officially abolished. In Soviet times, its functions were performed by the City Council.

Demographics= Population, dynamics, age and sex structure  Russians walking by the Pacific Ocean in Vladivostok According to the Russian Census of 2010, Vladivostok had a population of over 592 thousand residents, with over 616.8 thousand residents in the urban agglomeration. According to the Primorsky State Statistics Service for 2016, the total permanent population of the city's urban agglomeration was over 633,167 residents. Since the founding of the city, its population has been actively growing almost all the time, except for the periods of the Russian Civil War and the demographic crisis after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the 1990s and the beginning of the 2000s. In the 1970s, the population exceeded over 500 thousand residents, and in 1992 it reached a historical maximum exceeding over 648 thousand residents. The average population density is 1831.9 people/km2. In recent years, there has been a positive trend towards a gradual increase in the population, both due to migration processes and due to an increase in the birth rate. Over the past five years, the population has increased by 30 thousand: since 2013, there has been a positive dynamics of natural growth, and at the end of 2015 it amounted to 727 people. In 2020, the population of Vladivostok has reached over 600 thousand residents, as reported by the Federal Statistics of Russia. In the age structure of the city's population, a large proportion of the population is older than the working age, which is explained by the process of demographic aging. The age structure of the population: younger than able- bodied - 12.7%, able-bodied - 66.3%, older than able-bodied - 21%. The population of Vladivostok, like the whole of Russia, is characterized by a significant excess of the number of women over the number of men.  Ethnic composition  According to the Russian Census of 2010, representatives of more than seventy nationalities and ethnic groups live in Vladivostok. Among them, the largest ethnic groups (over a thousand people): are ethnic Russians - 475.2 thousand people, Ukrainians - 10 474 people, Uzbeks - 7109 people, Koreans - 4192 people, Chinese - 2446 people, Tatars - 2295 people, Belarusians - 1642 people, Armenians - 1635 people, and Azerbaijanis - 1252 people. According to studies, since 2002, there has been a change in the ethnic composition of the city as a result of migration processes: the share of Uzbeks increased by - 14.4 times, the share of Chinese and Tajiks by - 5.4 times, the share of Kyrgyz - by 8.5 times, and the share of by Koreans - 1.6 times. More than half of the Koreans of the Primorsky Territory live compactly in two cities - Vladivostok and Ussuriysk. More than 80% of Primorye Uzbeks live in Vladivostok. As noted, the share of Ukrainians, Belarusians, Russians, Tatars traditionally living in the city has decreased. Vladivostok is widely considered to be an ethnically diverse city, even though it has an ethnic Russian majority population, it still is one of the only few cities in Russia with a large Asian population. However, it is noted that today Vladivostok does not have the same multinational diversity as in the period from the 19th century to the Great Patriotic War, when entire national quarters existed in it, including the Chinese Millionka, the Korean Slobodka, and the Japanese quarter of Nihonzin Mati. Historical German, French, Estonian, American, and Central Asian diasporas of the beginning of the XXI century have been little studied. Economy The city's main industries are shipping, commercial fishing, and the naval base. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%. A very important employer and a major source of revenue for the city's inhabitants is the import of Japanese cars. Besides salesmen, the industry employs repairmen, fitters, import clerks as well as shipping and railway companies. The Vladivostok dealers sell 250,000 cars a year, with 200,000 going to other parts of Russia. Every third worker in the Primorsky Krai has some relation to the automobile import business. In recent years, the Russian government has made attempts to improve the country's own car industry. This has included raising tariffs for imported cars, which has put the car import business in Vladivostok in difficulties. To compensate, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the car manufacturing company Sollers to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It is planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010. Seaport Port of Vladivostok Vladivostok is a link between the Trans-Siberian Railway and the Pacific Sea routes, making it an important cargo and passenger port. It processes both cabotage and export- import general cargo of a wide range. 20 stevedoring companies operate in the port. The cargo turnover of the Vladivostok port, including the total turnover of all stevedoring companies, at the end of 2018 amounted to 21.2 million tons. In 2015, the total volume of external trade seaport amounted to more than 11.8 billion dollars. Foreign economic activity was carried out with 104 countries.  Tourism  Vladivostok is located in the extreme southeast of the Russian Far East, and is the closest city to the countries of the Asia- Pacific with an exotic European culture, which makes it attractive to tourists. The city is included in the project for the development of the Far East tourism \\"Eastern Ring\\". Within the framework of the project, the Primorsky Stage of the Mariinsky Theatre was opened, and there are plans to open branches of the Hermitage Museum, the Russian Museum, the Tretyakov Gallery and the State Museum of Oriental Art. Vladivostok entered the top ten Russian cities for recreation and tourism according to Forbes, and also took the fourteenth place in the National Tourism Rating. In addition to being the cultural centre, the city also is the centre of tourism in the Peter the Great Gulf. The city's resort area is located on the coast of Amur Bay, which includes over 11 sanatoriums. Vladivostok also has a bustling gambling zone, which has over 11 casinos planned to open by 2023. Tigre de Cristal, the city's first casino, was visited by over 80 thousand tourists, in less than a year of its opening. In 2017, the city was visited by around 3 million tourists, including 640 thousand foreigners, of which over 90% are tourists from Asia, specifically China, South Korea and Japan. Domestic tourism is based on business tourism (business trips to exhibitions, conferences), which accounts for up to 70% of the inbound flow. In Vladivostok, diplomatic tourism is also developed, as there are 18 foreign consulates in the city. There are 46 hotels in the city, with a total fund of 2561 rooms. The vast majority of the travel companies of Primorsky Krai (86%) are concentrated in Vladivostok, and their number was around 233 companies in 2011. Transportation left Russky Bridge The Trans-Siberian Railway was built to connect European Russia with Vladivostok, Russia's most important Pacific Ocean port. Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railroad, known as the Chinese Eastern Line, crossed over into China, passing through Harbin, a major city in Manchuria. Today, Vladivostok serves as the main starting point for the Trans-Siberian portion of the Eurasian Land Bridge.Vladivostok railway stationVladivostok is the main air hub in the Russian Far East.

Urban transportation On 28 June 1908, Vladivostok's first tram line was started along Svetlanskaya Street, running from the railway station on Lugovaya Street. On 9 October 1912, the first wooden cars manufactured in Belgium entered service. Today, Vladivostok's means of public transportation include trolleybus, bus, tram, train, funicular, and ferryboat. The main urban traffic lines are City Centre‚ÄîVtoraya Rechka, City Centre‚ÄîPervaya Rechka‚Äî3ya Rabochaya‚ÄîBalyayeva, and City Centre‚ÄîLugovaya Street.

Pollution Local ecologists from the Ecocenter organization have claimed that much of Vladivostok's suburbs are polluted and that living in them can be classified as a health hazard. The pollution has a number of causes, according to Ecocenter geo- chemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as shipbuilding and repairing, power stations, printing, fur farming, and mining. In addition, Vladivostok has a particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.B. V. Preobrazhensky, A. I. Burago, S. A. Shlykov. Primorye Ecology. Ecological Situation.

It is the only extant Carthusian monastery in Germany.Carthusian Order website: directory Maria Hain The former Schloss Hain in D√ºsseldorf-Unterrath was established under the name of Kartause Maria Hain (Maria Hain Charterhouse) as a Carthusian monastery in 1869, where despite the threats of the Kulturkampf in the 1880s and of World War II, it survived until 1964, when the site was required for the expansion of D√ºsseldorf Airport and the monks were forced to leave. Marienau Marienau Charterhouse was established in 1964 in Talacker near Bad Wurzach, Baden- W√ºrttemberg, as a replacement for Maria Hain. Its secluded woodland location acts to keep it apart from the world, and the monastery is not open to general visitors. Sketch of a father's cell in Marienau Charterhouse It was built between 1962 and 1964 to designs by the architects Emil Steffann and Gisberth M. H√ºlsmann. Marienau is a \\"double charterhouse\\", that is, it has hermitages for 24 monks, rather than the usual 12. The buildings, as specifically required by the Carthusian order through Pater Marianus Marck, fall into five clearly defined areas: # The central \\"small\\" cloister # The \\"great\\" cloister # The brothers' building # The workshops and farmhouse # The gatehouse and guesthouse The buildings round the great cloister are single-storied, while the remainder are two-storied. All are of simple brick construction with ceilings of wooden beams and red tiled roofs. The outside walls are painted yellow. The perimeter wall encloses the entire precinct, with a height of some 2.5 metres and a total length of about 1.2 kilometres, with three gates. At the centre point of the enclosed area, amounting to about 10 hectares, is the simple church. Enclosed within the monastery complex is the graveyard. Carthusians are traditionally buried in their robes without a coffin, on a board; the only monument is a simple wooden cross without a name.to comply with legal regulations, however, a plan is kept showing who is buried where The graveyard also contains a large wooden cross under which are buried the bones of the dead from Maria Hain, which were moved to the new charterhouse in 1964 with the rest of the community.

Phorm was incorporated in Delaware, United States, but relocated to Singapore as Phorm Corporation (Singapore) Ltd in 2012. Founded in 2002, the company originally distributed programs that were considered spyware, from which they made millions of dollars in revenue. It stopped distributing those programs after complaints from groups in the United States and Canada, and announced it was talking with several United Kingdom Internet service providers (ISPs) to deliver targeted advertising based on the websites that users visited. Phorm partnered with ISPs Oi, Telefonica in Brazil, Romtelecom in Romania, and TTNet in Turkey. In June 2012, Phorm made an unsuccessful attempt to raise ¬£20 million for a 20% stake in its Chinese subsidiary. The company's proposed advertising system, called Webwise, was a behavioral targeting service (similar to NebuAd) that used deep packet inspection to examine traffic. Phorm said that the data collected would be anonymous and would not be used to identify users, and that their service would include protection against phishing (fraudulent collection of users' personal information). Nonetheless, World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee and others spoke out against Phorm for tracking users' browsing habits, and the ISP BT Group was criticised for running secret trials of the service. The UK Information Commissioner's Office voiced legal concerns over Webwise, and has said it would only be legal as an \\"opt-in\\" service, not an opt-out system. The European Commission called on the UK to protect Web users' privacy, and opened an infringement proceeding against the country in regard to ISPs' use of Phorm. Some groups, including Amazon.com and the Wikimedia Foundation (the non-profit organization that operates collaborative wiki projects), requested an opt-out of their websites from scans by the system. Phorm changed to an opt-in policy. According to Phorm‚Äôs website, the company would not collect any data from users who had not explicitly opted in to its services. Users had to provide separate consent for each web browsing device they used. Due to increasing issues, Phorm ceased trading on April 14th 2016.  Company history  In its previous incarnation as 121Media, the company made products that were described as spyware by The Register. 121Media distributed a program called PeopleOnPage, which was classified as spyware by F-Secure. PeopleOnPage was an application built around their advertising engine, called ContextPlus. ContextPlus was also distributed as a rootkit called Apropos, which used tricks to prevent the user from removing the application and sent information back to central servers regarding a user's browsing habits. The Center for Democracy and Technology, a U.S.-based advocacy group, filed a complaint with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in November 2005 over distribution of what it considered spyware, including ContextPlus. They stated that they had investigated and uncovered deceptive and unfair behaviour. This complaint was filed in concert with the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Internet Center, a group that was filing a similar complaint against Integrated Search Technologies with Canadian authorities. ContextPlus shut down its operations in May 2006 and stated they were \\"no longer able to ensure the highest standards of quality and customer care\\". The shutdown came after several major lawsuits against adware vendors had been launched. By September 2007, 121Media had become known as Phorm,Compare first pages of Phorm's annual report for 2006 (PDF) and a report from 2007 (PDF). Both retrieved on 2009-04-23. and admitted a company history in adware and stated it had closed down the multimillion-dollar revenue stream from its PeopleOnPage toolbar, citing consumers‚Äô identification of adware with spyware as the primary cause for the decision. In early 2008 Phorm admitted to editing its article on Wikipedia‚Äîremoving a quotation from The Guardian's commercial executives describing the opposition they have towards its tracking system, and deleting a passage explaining how BT admitted misleading customers over covert Phorm trials in 2007. The changes were quickly noticed and reversed by the online encyclopedia's editors. Phorm currently resides in Mortimer Street, London, UK with staffing levels of around 35. Trading in Phorm's shares was suspended on London's AIM market on 24 February 2016, pending \\"clarification of the company's financial position\\". According to Phorm, it had been \\"unable to secure the requisite equity funding...\\" and was in \\"advanced discussions with certain of its shareholders and other parties regarding possible alternative financing...\\" and that there was \\"no guarantee\\" that such discussions would \\"result in any funds being raised. Pending conclusion of those discussions the Company has requested suspension of its shares from trading on AIM.\\" Financial losses The company made a loss of $32.1 million in 2007, a loss of $49.8 million in 2008 and a loss of $29.7 million in 2009. 2010 was by no means better, with a net loss of $27.9 million By the end of 2010 the company had lost more than $107 million, with no perceivable revenue stream. In 2011, Phorm reported losses of $30.5 million and conducted an equity placing of ¬£33.6 million, which paid off the company's debt. Cessation of trading On 14 April 2016 Phorm's Board of Directors announced to the London Stock Exchange that the company was ceasing to trade and that shareholders were unlikely to recover any of their investments. According to RNS Number : 2561Y FTSE 13 May 2016. Changes in FTSE UK Index Series FTSE AIM All-Share Index Effective From Start of Trading 18 May 2016 Phorm (UK): Constituent Deletion.  Proposed advertisement service  Phorm had worked with major U.S. and British ISPs‚Äîincluding BT Group (formerly British Telecom), Virgin Media, and TalkTalk (at the time owned by The Carphone Warehouse)‚Äîon a behavioral targeting advertisement service to monitor browsing habits and serve relevant advertisements to the end user. Phorm say these deals would have given them access to the surfing habits of 70% of British households with broadband. The service, which uses deep packet inspection to check the content of requested web pages, has been compared to those of NebuAd and Front Porch. The service, which would have been marketed to end-users as \\"Webwise\\", (in 2009 the BBC took legal advice over the trade mark Webwise), would work by categorising user interests and matching them with advertisers who wish to target that type of user. \\"As you browse we're able to categorise all of your Internet actions\\", said Phorm COO Virasb Vahidi. \\"We actually can see the entire Internet\\". The company said that data collected would be completely anonymous and that Phorm would never be aware of the identity of the user or what they have browsed, and adds that Phorm's advertising categories exclude sensitive terms and have been widely drawn so as not to reveal the identity of the user. By monitoring users' browsing, Phorm even says they are able to offer some protection against online fraud and phishing. Phorm formerly maintained an opt-out policy for its services. However, according to a spokesman for Phorm, the way the opt-out works means the contents of the websites visited will still be mirrored to its system. All computers, all users, and all http applications used by each user of each computer will need to be configured (or supplemented with add ons) to opt out. It has since been declared by the Information Commissioner's Office that Phorm would only be legal under UK law if it were an opt-in service.  Implementation  A diagram showing how Phorm's \\"Webwise\\" system creates copies of its tracking cookie in each domain the end-user visits, based on the report published by Richard Clayton. Richard Clayton, a Cambridge University security researcher, attended an on-the-record meeting with Phorm, and published his account of how their advertising system is implemented. Phorm's system, like many websites, uses HTTP cookies (small pieces of text) to store user settings. The company said that an initial web request is redirected three times (using HTTP 307 responses) within their system, so that they can inspect cookies to determine if the user has opted out. The system then sets a unique Phorm tracking identifier (UID) for the user (or collects it if it already exists), and adds a cookie that is forged to appear to come from the requested website. In an analysis titled \\"Stealing Phorm Cookies\\", Clayton wrote that Phorm's system stores a tracking cookie for each website visited on the user's PC, and that each contains an identical copy of the user's UID. Where possible, Phorm's system strips its tracking cookies from http requests before they are forwarded across the Internet to a website's server, but it cannot prevent the UID from being sent to websites using https. This would allow websites to associate the UID to any details the website collects about the visitor. Phorm Senior Vice President of Technology Marc Burgess has said that the collected information also includes a timestamp. Burgess said, \\"This is enough information to accurately target an ad in [the] future, but cannot be used to find out a) who you are, or b) where you have browsed\\".  Incentives  In 2008 Phorm considered offering an incentive, in addition to the phishing protection it originally planned, as a means to convince end-users to opt into its Webwise system. The alternate incentives, suggested in a Toluna.com market research survey carried out on behalf of Phorm, included further phishing protection, a donation to charity, a free technical support line, or one pound off opted-in users' monthly broadband subscriptions. Following the decision by Wikimedia Foundation and Amazon to opt their websites out of being profiled by Phorm's Webwise system, and as an incentive for websites to remain opted into the Phorm profiling system, Phorm have launched Webwise Discover. The Korean launch of this web publisher incentive was announced in a press conference in Covent Garden in London on 3 June 2009. A survey by polling firm Populus revealed that after watching a demonstration video, 66% of the 2,075 individuals polled claimed to either like the idea or like it a lot . Website publishers are invited to upload a web widget which will provide a small frame to display recommended web links, based on the tracked interests of any Phorm- tracked website visitors (those whose ISP uses Phorm Deep Packet Inspection to intercept and profile web traffic). There would be no charge to the website, and Phorm do not stand to make any money from Webwise Discover; however, there are plans to display targeted adverts in the future. The widget would only deliver link recommendations if the user was signed up for targeted advertising with a Phorm-affiliated ISP, the widget would be invisible to everyone else.. At the press launch Phorm spokespersons admitted that at present not a single UK ISP or website has yet signed up to Webwise Discover system, although they emphasised it was part of the current Korea Telecom Webwise trials. Legal advice has been offered to websites considering signing up to the OIX system by Susan Singleton.  Legality  The Open Rights Group (ORG) raised questions about Phorm's legality and asked for clarification of how the service would work. FIPR has argued that Phorm's online advert system is illegal in the UK. Nicholas Bohm, general counsel at FIPR, said: \\"The need for both parties to consent to interception in order for it to be lawful is an extremely basic principle within the legislation, and it cannot be lightly ignored or treated as a technicality.\\" His open letter to the Information Commissioner has been published on the FIPR web site. The Conservative peer Lord Northesk has questioned whether the UK government is taking any action on the targeted advertising service offered by Phorm in the light of the questions about its legality under the Data Protection and Regulation of Investigatory Powers Acts. On 9 April 2008, the Information Commissioner's Office ruled that Phorm would only be legal under UK law if it were an opt-in service. The Office stated it will closely monitor the testing and implementation of Phorm, in order to ensure data protection laws are observed. The UK Home Office has indicated that Phorm's proposed service is only legal if users give explicit consent. The Office itself became a subject of controversy when emails between it and Phorm were released. The emails showed that the company edited a draft legal interpretation by the Office, and that an official responded \\"If we agree this, and this becomes our position do you think your clients and their prospective partners will be comforted\\". Liberal Democrat spokeswoman on Home Affairs, Baroness Sue Miller, considered it an act of collusion: \\"The fact the Home Office asks the very company they are worried is actually falling outside the laws whether the draft interpretation of the law is correct is completely bizarre.\\" The Register reported in May 2008 that Phorm's logo strongly resembled that of an unrelated UK company called Phorm Design. They quoted the smaller company's owner, Simon Griffiths: \\"I've had solicitors look at it and they say we'd have to go to court. [Phorm are] obviously a big player with a lot of clout. I'm a small design agency in Sheffield that employs three people.\\" Until 21 September 2010, Phorm's Webwise service also shared the same name as BBC WebWise. Monitoring of the Phorm website using a Website change detection service alerted interested parties to changes on 21 September 2010. Phorm's website had been edited to remove references to the word 'Webwise'. Phorm's Webwise product had become 'PhormDiscover'. The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market (OHIM) Trade Marks and Designs Registration Office of the European Union website CTM-Online database lists Phorm's application for use of the 'Webwise' trade mark name. The British Broadcasting Corporation is listed as an opponent on grounds of 'Likelihood of confusion'. The City of London-based legal firm Bristows wrote to the OHIM on 22 September 2010, withdrawing the BBC's opposition saying, \\"The British Broadcasting Corporation have instructed us to request the withdrawal of the above Opposition No. B11538985\\" On 28 October 2010, BT removed the Webwise pages from their company website although it was not until 12 November 2010 that all pages had finally been confirmed as removed by forum contributors at the campaign group called \\"NoDPI.org\\". , Virgin Media had not removed their Phorm and Webwise FAQs from their customer-news section. = European Commission case against UK over Phorm = European Union communications commissioner Viviane Reding has said that the commission was concerned Phorm was breaching consumer privacy directives, and called on the UK Government to take action to protect consumers' privacy. The European Commission wrote to the UK government on 30 June 2008 to set out the context of the EU's interest in the controversy, and asked detailed questions ahead of possible Commission intervention. It required the UK to respond to the letter one month after it was sent. A spokeswoman for the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) admitted on 16 August that the UK had not met the deadline. On 16 September, BERR refused The Register request to release the full text of their reply to the European Commission, but released a statement to the effect that the UK authorities consider Phorm's products are capable of being operated in a lawful, appropriate and transparent fashion. Unsatisfied by the response, the European Commission wrote to the UK again on 6 October. Martin Selmayr, spokesman for Reding's Information Society and Media directorate-general said, \\"For us the matter is not finished. Quite the contrary.\\" The UK government responded again in November, but the Commission sent another letter to the government in January 2009. This third letter was sent because the Commission was not satisfied with explanations about implementation of European law in the context of the Phorm case. Selmayr was quoted in The Register as saying, \\"The European Commission's investigation with regard to the Phorm case is still ongoing\\", and he went on to say that the Commission may have to proceed to formal action if the UK authorities do not provide a satisfactory response to the Commission's concerns. On 14 April, the European Commission said they had \\"opened an infringement proceeding against the United Kingdom\\" regarding ISPs' use of Phorm:Full text, titled \\"Telecoms: Commission launches case against UK over privacy and personal data protection\\", at the European Union portal Rapid Press Releases That day, in response to a news item by The Register regarding the European Commission's preparations to sue the UK government, Phorm said their technology \\"is fully compliant with UK legislation and relevant EU directives. This has been confirmed by BERR and by the UK regulatory authorities and we note that there is no suggestion to the contrary in the Commission's statement today.\\" However, BERR denied such confirmation when they responded to a Freedom of Information (FOI) request also made that day: In January 2012, the EU dropped its case against the UK government.  Reaction  Initial reaction to the proposed service highlighted deep concerns with regards to individual privacy and property rights in data. Phorm has defended its technology in the face of what it called \\"misinformation\\" from bloggers claiming it threatens users' privacy. Most security firms classify Phorm's targeting cookies as adware. Kaspersky Lab, whose anti-virus engine is licensed to many other security vendors, said it would detect the cookie as adware. Trend Micro said there was a \\"very high chance\\" that it would add detection for the tracking cookies as adware. PC Tools echoed Trend's concerns about privacy and security, urging Phorm to apply an opt-in approach. Specialist anti-spyware firm Sunbelt Software also expressed concerns, saying Phorm's tracking cookies were candidates for detection by its anti-spyware software. Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, said: \\"The message has to be this: if you care about your privacy, do not use BT, Virgin or Talk-Talk as your internet provider.\\" He added that, historically, anonymising technology had never worked. Even if it did, he stressed, it still posed huge privacy issues. Phorm has engaged a number of public relations advisers including Freuds, Citigate Dewe Rogerson and ex-House of Commons media adviser John Stonborough in an attempt to save its reputation, and has engaged with audiences via moderated online webchats.Full transcripts of these interviews can be found at http://www.webwise.com/how-it-works/chat.html. The creator of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has criticised the idea of tracking his browsing history saying that \\"It's mine - you can't have it. If you want to use it for something, then you have to negotiate with me. I have to agree, I have to understand what I'm getting in return.\\" He also said that he would change his ISP if they introduced the Phorm system. As Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Berners-Lee also published a set of personal design notes titled \\"No Snooping\\", in which he explains his views on commercial use of packet inspection and references Phorm. Simon Davies, a privacy advocate and founding member of Privacy International, said \\"Behavioural advertising is a rather spooky concept for many people.\\" In a separate role at 80/20 Thinking, a consultancy start-up, he was engaged by Phorm to look at the system. He said: \\"We were impressed with the effort that had been put into minimising the collection of personal information\\". He was subsequently quoted as saying \\"[Privacy International] DOES NOT endorse Phorm, though we do applaud a number of developments in its process\\". \\"The system does appear to mitigate a number of core privacy problems in profiling, retention and tracking ... [but] we won't as PI support any system that works on an opt-out basis.\\" Kent Ertugrul later said he made a mistake when he suggested Privacy International had endorsed Phorm: \\"This was my confusion I apologise. The endorsement was in fact from Simon Davies, the MD of 80 / 20 who is also a director of privacy international.\\" = Stopphoulplay.com = Ertugrul has set up a website called \\"Stopphoulplay.com\\", in reaction to Phorm critics Alexander Hanff and Marcus Williamson. Ertugrul called Hanff a \\"serial agitator\\" who has run campaigns against both Phorm and other companies such as Procter & Gamble, and says Williamson is trying to disgrace Ertugrul and Phorm through \\"serial letter writing\\". Hanff believes the Stopphoulplay website's statements are \\"completely irrelevant\\" to his campaign and that they will backfire on Ertugrul, while Williamson laments that Phorm \\"has now stooped to personal smears\\". When it launched on 28 April 2009, Stopphoulplay.com discussed a petition to the UK Prime Minister on the Downing Street website. When originally launched the web page claimed, \\"The website managers at 10 Downing Street recognised their mistake in allowing a misleading petition to appear on their site, and have since provided assurances to Phorm that they will not permit this to happen again\\". That same day, the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act was used to request confirmation of the claim by Phorm and on 29 April Phorm removed the quoted text from the website and replaced it with nothing. The Prime Minister's Office replied to the FOI request on 28 May, stating they held no information in relation to the request concerning Phorm's claim. A day after the site's launch, BBC correspondent Darren Waters wrote, \\"This is a battle with no sign of a ceasefire, with both sides [Phorm and anti-Phorm campaigners] settling down to a war of attrition, and with governments, both in the UK and the EU, drawn into the crossfire.\\" The site was closed down in September 2009 and is now an online casino. However, the pages http://stopphoulplay.com/this-is-how-they-work/ and http://stopphoulplay.com/this-is-who-they-are/ still contain the comments against Hanff and NoDPI. = BT trials = After initial denials, BT Group confirmed they ran a small scale trial, at one exchange, of a \\"prototype advertising platform\\" in 2007. The trial involved tens of thousands of end users. BT customers will be able to opt out of the trial‚ÄîBT said they are developing an improved, non-cookie based opt-out of Phorm‚Äîbut no decision has been made as to their post-trial approach. The Register reported that BT ran an earlier secret trial in 2006, in which it intercepted and profiled the web browsing of 18,000 of its broadband customers. The technical report states that customers who participated in the trial were not made aware of the profiling, as one of the aims of the validation was not to affect their experience. On 4 June 2008, a copy of a 52-page report allegedly from inside BT, titled \\"PageSense External Technical Validation\\", was uploaded to WikiLeaks. The report angered many members of the public; there are questions regarding the involvement of charity ads for Oxfam, Make Trade Fair and SOS Children's Villages, and whether or not they were made aware that their ads were being used in what many feel were highly illegal technical trials. FIPR's Nicholas Bohm has said that trials of an online ad system carried out by BT involving more than 30,000 of its customers were potentially illegal. BT's third trial of Phorm's Webwise system repeatedly slipped. The trial was to last for approximately two weeks on 10,000 subscribers, and was originally due to start in March 2008, then pushed to April and again to the end of May; it has yet to occur. The company is facing legal action over trials of Phorm that were carried out without user consent. On 2 September 2008, while investigating a complaint made by anti-Phorm protestors, the City of London Police met with BT representatives to informally question them about the secret Phorm trials. On 25 September the Police announced that there will be no formal investigation of BT over its secret trials of Phorm in 2006 and 2007. According to Alex Hanff, the police said there was no criminal intent on behalf of BT and there was implied consent because the service was going to benefit customers. Bohm said of that police response: On 29 September 2008, it was announced in BT's support forum that their trial of Phorm's Webwise system would commence the following day. BT press officer Adam Liversage stated that BT is still working on a network-level opt-out, but that it will not be offered during the trial. Opted-out traffic will pass through the Webwise system but will not be mirrored or profiled. The final full roll-out of Webwise across BT's national network will not necessarily depend the completion of the work either. The Open Rights Group urged BT's customers not to participate in the BT Webwise trials, saying their \\"anti-fraud\\" feature is unlikely to have advantages over features already built into web browsers. Subscribers to BT forums had used the Beta forums to criticise and raise concerns about BT's implementation of Phorm, but BT responded with a statement: According to Kent Ertugrul, BT would have completed the rollout of its software by the end of 2009. The Wall Street Journal, however, reported in July 2009 that BT had no plans to do so by then, and was concentrating on \\"other opportunities\\". Phorm's share price fell 40% on the news. On 6 July 2009 BT's former chief press officer, Adam Liversage, described his thoughts using Twitter: \\"A year of the most intensive, personal-reputation-destroying PR trench warfare all comes to nothing\\". He ended his comment with \\"Phantastic\\". In October 2009, Sergeant Mike Reed of the City of London Police answered a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. He confirmed the crime reference number as 5253/08. In his response, he stated that after originally passing case papers to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) in December 2008, the police were '\\"asked to provide further evidence, by the CPS in October 2009\\". Asked to \\"Disclose the date when that investigation was reopened\\", he said that it was \\"on instruction of the CPS in October 2009\\". In Sergeant Reed's response he named the officer in charge as \\"D/S Murray\\". On 25 February 2010, it was reported that the CPS continued to work on a potential criminal case against BT over its secret trials of Phorm's system. Prosecutors considered whether or not to press criminal charges against unnamed individuals under Part I of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. It was not until April 2011 the CPS decided not to prosecute as it would not be in the public interest, stating that neither Phorm nor BT had acted in bad faith and any penalty imposed would be nominal. In April 2012, reports said that an officer of the City of London Police had been taken to lunch by Phorm. A police spokesperson was quoted as saying they were aware of the allegation, and that while no formal complaint had been received, \\"The force is reviewing the information available to it before deciding the best course of action.\\" The spokesperson also highlighted that, \\"City of London Police were not involved in an investigation into BT Phorm and that the decision not to investigate was prompted by CPS advice\\". = Advertisers and websites = Advertisers which had initially expressed an interest about Phorm include: Financial Times, The Guardian, Universal McCann, MySpace, iVillage, MGM OMD, Virgin Media and Unanimis. The Guardian has withdrawn from its targeted advertising deal with Phorm; in an email to a reader, advertising manager Simon Kilby stated \\"It is true that we have had conversations with them [Phorm] regarding their services but we have concluded at this time that we do not want to be part of the network. Our decision was in no small part down to the conversations we had internally about how this product sits with the values of our company.\\" In response to an article published in The Register on 26 March 2008, Phorm has stated that MySpace has not joined OIX as a Publisher. The Financial Times has decided not to participate in Phorm's impending trial. The ORG's Jim Killock said that many businesses \\"will think [commercial] data and relationships should simply be private until they and their customers decide,\\" and might even believe \\"having their data spied upon is a form of industrial espionage\\". David Evans of the British Computer Society has questioned whether the act of publishing a website on the net is the same as giving consent for advertisers to make use of the site's content or to monitor the site's interactions with its customers. Pete John created an add on, called Dephormation, for servers and web users to opt out and remain opted-out of the system; however, John ultimately recommends that users switch from Phorm-equipped Internet providers: \\"Dephormation is not a solution. It is a fig leaf for your privacy. Do not rely on Dephormation to protect your privacy and security. You need to find a new ISP.\\" In April 2009, Amazon.com announced that it would not allow Phorm to scan any of its domains. The Wikimedia Foundation has also requested an opt-out from scans, and took the necessary steps to block all Wikimedia and Wikipedia domains from being processed by the Phorm system on the 16th of that month. In July 2009 the Nationwide Building Society confirmed that it would prevent Phorm from scanning its website, in order to protect the privacy of its customers. = Internet service providers = MetroFi, an American municipal wireless network provider linked to Phorm, ceased operations in 2008. Three other ISPs linked to Phorm all changed or clarified their plans since first signing on with the company. In response to customer concerns, TalkTalk said that its implementation would have been \\"opt-in\\" only (as opposed to BT's \\"opt-out\\") and those that don't \\"opt in\\" will have their traffic split to avoid contact with a WebWise (Phorm) server. In July 2009, the company confirmed it would not implement Phorm; Charles Dunstone, boss of its parent company, told the Times \\"We were only going to do it [Phorm] if BT did it and if the whole industry was doing it. We were not interested enough to do it on our own.\\" Business news magazine New Media Age reported on 23 April that Virgin Media moved away from Phorm and was expected to sign a deal with another company named Audience Science, while BT would meet with other advertising companies to gain what the ISP calls \\"general market intelligence\\" about Phorm. NMA had called the moves \\"a shift in strategy by the two media companies\\". A day later, the magazine said both companies' relationships with Phorm actually remain unchanged. Although Virgin Media were reported to have \\"moved away from Phorm\\", in November 2010 they were the only UK-based ISP to still carry information about Phorm's Webwise system on their website. In addition, Phorm partners with international ISPs Oi, Telef√≥nica in Brazil, TTNET-T√ºrk Telekom in Turkey, and Romtelecom in Romania.  Countries Post United Kingdom = South Korea  Phorm announced the beginning of a market trial in South Korea via the London Stock Exchange's Regulatory News Service (RNS) on 30 March 2009. Subsequently, they announced via RNS on 21 May 2009 that they had commenced the trial. On 8 July 2009 Phorm indicated that the trials were proceeding as expected. In their Notice of 2009 Interim Report & Accounts, published on 14 September 2009, Phorm stated they were \\"Nearing completion of a substantial market trial, launched in May, with KT, the largest ISP in South Korea\\". The existence of the trial in South Korea was publicised by OhmyNews on 2 September 2009. On 9 September 2009 OhMyNews announced that the trial had been shut down.  Brazil  On 26 March 2010, Phorm announced that its plans for commercial deployment in Brazil. In May 2012, the Brazilian Internet Steering Committee issued a resolution recommending against the use of Phorm products by any internet service providers in the country, citing privacy risks and concerns that Phorm's products would degrade the quality of internet services. In respect of the proposed partnership with Telemar (now known as Oi) the claim is that iG, a web portal, only has 5% penetration in the market and Phorm did not clear R$400 million \\"last year\\".  Turkey  Since launching with TTNET, a subsidiary of T√ºrk Telecom Group, in Turkey in 2012, Phorm has launched its platform with five additional ISPs. Accordingly, on a global basis, there are now over 20 million daily users on Phorm's platform. According to RNS Number : 3504C, as of 16 January 2015, Phorm moved to a remote cookie option whilst scaling back its operations in Turkey.  China  Phorm announced on 3 October 2013 that it had launched operationally in China and had commenced a nationwide opt-in process. The company announced that it has commenced commercial operations in China and is serving advertisements on a paid basis. Privacy concerns in China and Hong Kong are growing, and there have been significant developments in privacy regulation, which could impact on Phorm operations in both the mainland and Hong Kong. In May 2012 mainland China passed new regulations which implement measures protecting consumer privacy from commercial exploitation. Further privacy legislation arrived in April 2013, with the publication of two draft rules from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology: \\"Provisions on the Protection of the Personal Information of Telecommunications (Provisions for Telecommunications and Internet Users)\\", and \\"Internet Users and the Provisions on Registration of the True Identity Information of Phone Users\\" (Provisions on Phone Users), along with draft amendments to the 1993 Law of Consumer Rights. The laws are emerging as e-commerce in China becomes an increasingly significant part of the Chinese economy. These new regulations, which include provisions regulating data collection by smart devices, are discussed in an article published by the International Association of Privacy Professionals' \\"Privacy Tracker\\" blog called \\"Making Sense of China's New Privacy Laws\\".https://www.privacyassociation.org/privacy_tracker/post/making_sense_of_chinas_new_privacy_laws In Hong Kong, The Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (\\"PCPD\\") has taken a robust approach to the protection of consumer privacy, as they seek to enforce the provisions of the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance 2012 (\\"Amendment Ordinance\\") which came into force in April 2013.http://www.pcpd.org.hk/english/infocentre/press_20140123a.htm (Jan 2014)  Notes  References  External links  * Internet privacy Online advertising Spyware Rootkits ","title":"Phorm"},{"id":"21345243","text":"Donatien Alphonse Fran√ßois, Marquis de Sade (; 2 June 1740 ‚Äì 2 December 1814), was a French nobleman, revolutionary politician, philosopher, and writer, famous for his libertine sexuality. His works include novels, short stories, plays, dialogues, and political tracts. In his lifetime some of these were published under his own name while others, which de Sade denied having written, appeared anonymously. De Sade is best known for his erotic works, which combined philosophical discourse with pornography, depicting sexual fantasies with an emphasis on violence (particularly against women and children), suffering, anal sex, crime, and blasphemy against Christianity. He became infamous for his numerous sexual crimes and abuse against young men, women and children. He claimed to be a proponent of absolute freedom, unrestrained by morality, religion, or law. The words sadism and sadist are derived from his name. De Sade was incarcerated in various prisons and an insane asylum for about 32 years of his life: 11 years in Paris (10 of which were spent in the Bastille), a month in the Conciergerie, two years in a fortress, a year in Madelonnettes Convent, three years in Bic√™tre Asylum, a year in Sainte-P√©lagie Prison, and 12 years in the Charenton Asylum. During the French Revolution, he was an elected delegate to the National Convention. Many of his works were written in prison. There continues to be a fascination with de Sade among scholars and in popular culture. Prolific French intellectuals such as Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault published studies of him. On the other hand, the French hedonist philosopher Michel Onfray has attacked this interest in de Sade, writing that \\"It is intellectually bizarre to make Sade a hero.\\" There have also been numerous film adaptions of his work, the most notable being Pasolini's Sal√≤, an adaptation of de Sade's infamous book, The 120 Days of Sodom. Life=Early life and education The Ch√¢teau de Lacoste above Lacoste, a residence of Sade; currently the site of theatre festivals De Sade was born on 2 June 1740, in the H√¥tel de Cond√©, Paris, to Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Joseph, Count de Sade and Marie El√©onore de Maill√© de Carman, distant cousin and Lady-in-waiting to the Princess of Cond√©. He was his parents' only surviving child. He was educated by an uncle, the Abb√© de Sade. In Sade's youth, his father abandoned the family; his mother joined a convent. He was raised by servants who indulged \\"his every whim,\\" which led to his becoming \\"known as a rebellious and spoiled child with an ever-growing temper.\\" Later in his childhood, Sade was sent to the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand in Paris, a Jesuit college, for four years. While at the school, he was tutored by Abb√© Jacques- Fran√ßois Amblet, a priest. Later in life, at one of Sade's trials the Abb√© testified, saying that Sade had a \\"passionate temperament which made him eager in the pursuit of pleasure\\" but had a \\"good heart.\\" At the Lyc√©e Louis-le- Grand, he was subjected to \\"severe corporal punishment,\\" including \\"flagellation,\\" and he \\"spent the rest of his adult life obsessed with the violent act.\\" At age 14, Sade began attending an elite military academy. After twenty months of training, on 14 December 1755, at age 15, Sade was commissioned as a sub-lieutenant, becoming a soldier. After thirteen months as a sub-lieutenant, he was commissioned to the rank of cornet in the Brigade de S. Andr√© of the Comte de Provence's Carbine Regiment. He eventually became Colonel of a Dragoon regiment and fought in the Seven Years' War. In 1763, on returning from war, he courted a rich magistrate's daughter, but her father rejected his suitorship and instead arranged a marriage with his elder daughter, Ren√©e-P√©lagie de Montreuil; that marriage produced two sons and a daughter. In 1766, he had a private theatre built in his castle, the Ch√¢teau de Lacoste, in Provence. In January 1767, his father died. Sade's father, Jean-Baptiste Fran√ßois Joseph de Sade Sade's mother, Marie El√©onore de Maill√© de Carman Title and heirs The men of the Sade family alternated between using the marquis and comte (count) titles. His grandfather, Gaspard Fran√ßois de Sade, was the first to use marquis; occasionally, he was the Marquis de Sade, but is identified in documents as the Marquis de Mazan. The Sade family were noblesse d'√©p√©e, claiming at the time the oldest, Frank-descended nobility, so assuming a noble title without a King's grant, was customarily de rigueur. Alternating title usage indicates that titular hierarchy (below duc et pair) was notional; theoretically, the marquis title was granted to noblemen owning several countships, but its use by men of dubious lineage caused its disrepute. At Court, precedence was by seniority and royal favor, not title. There is father-and-son correspondence, wherein father addresses son as marquis. For many years, Sade's descendants regarded his life and work as a scandal to be suppressed. This did not change until the mid-twentieth century, when the Comte Xavier de Sade reclaimed the marquis title, long fallen into disuse, on his visiting cards, and took an interest in his ancestor's writings. At that time, the \\"divine marquis\\" of legend was so unmentionable in his own family that Xavier de Sade only learned of him in the late 1940s when approached by a journalist. He subsequently discovered a store of Sade's papers in the family ch√¢teau at Cond√©-en-Brie, and worked with scholars for decades to enable their publication. His youngest son, the Marquis Thibault de Sade, has continued the collaboration. The family have also claimed a trademark on the name. The family sold the Ch√¢teau de Cond√© in 1983. As well as the manuscripts they retain, others are held in universities and libraries. Many, however, were lost in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. A substantial number were destroyed after Sade's death at the instigation of his son, Donatien-Claude-Armand. Scandals and imprisonment Sade lived a scandalous libertine existence and repeatedly procured young prostitutes as well as employees of both sexes in his castle in Lacoste. He was also accused of blasphemy, which was considered a serious offense. His behavior also included an affair with his wife's sister, Anne- Prosp√®re, who had come to live at the castle. Beginning in 1763, Sade lived mainly in or near Paris. Several prostitutes there complained about mistreatment by him and he was put under surveillance by the police, who made detailed reports of his activities. After several short imprisonments, which included a brief incarceration in the Ch√¢teau de Saumur (then a prison), he was exiled to his ch√¢teau at Lacoste in 1768. The first major scandal occurred on Easter Sunday in 1768, in which Sade procured the services of a woman, Rose Keller, a widow-beggar who approached him for alms. He told her she could make money by working for him‚Äîshe understood her work to be that of a housekeeper. At his chateau at Arcueil, Sade ripped her clothes off, threw her on a divan and tied her by the four limbs, face-down, so that she could not see behind her. Then he whipped her. Keller testified that he made various incisions on her body into which he poured hot wax, although investigators found no broken skin on Keller, and Sade explained that he had applied ointment to her after the whipping. Keller finally escaped by climbing out of a second-floor window and running away. The Sade family paid the maid to keep her quiet, but the wave of social embarrassment damaged Sade's reputation. La Pr√©sidente, Sade's mother-in-law, obtained a lettre de cachet (a royal order of arrest and imprisonment, without stated cause or access to the courts) from the King, protecting Sade from the jurisdiction of the courts. The lettre de cachet would later prove disastrous for the marquis. Four years later, in 1772, Sade committed further acts with four prostitutes and his manservant, Latour. This episode in Marseille involved the drugging of prostitutes with the supposed aphrodisiac Spanish fly and sodomy with Latour. The two men were sentenced to death in absentia for sodomy and the poisoning. They fled to Italy, Sade taking his wife's sister with him. Sade and Latour were caught and imprisoned at the Fortress of Miolans in French Savoy in late 1772, but escaped four months later. Les 120 Journ√©es de Sodome manuscript Sade later hid at Lacoste where he rejoined his wife, who became an accomplice in his subsequent endeavors. In 1774, Sade trapped six children, including one boy, in his chateau for six weeks during which time he subjected them to abuse, which his wife allowed. He kept a group of young employees at the chateau, most of whom complained about molestation and quickly left his service. Sade was forced to flee to Italy once again. It was during this time he wrote Voyage d'Italie. In 1776, he returned to Lacoste, again hired several servant girls, most of whom soon fled. In 1777, the father of one of those employees went to Lacoste to claim his daughter, and attempted to shoot the Marquis at point-blank range, but the gun misfired. Later that year, Sade was tricked into going to Paris to visit his supposedly ill mother, who in fact had recently died. He was arrested and imprisoned in the Ch√¢teau de Vincennes. He successfully appealed his death sentence in 1778 but remained imprisoned under the lettre de cachet. He escaped but was soon recaptured. He resumed writing and met fellow prisoner Comte de Mirabeau, who also wrote erotic works. Despite this common interest, the two came to dislike each other intensely. In 1784, Vincennes was closed, and Sade was transferred to the Bastille. The following year, he wrote the manuscript for his magnum opus Les 120 Journ√©es de Sodome (The 120 Days of Sodom), which he wrote in minuscule handwriting on a continuous roll of paper he rolled tightly and placed in his cell wall to hide. He was unable to finish the work; on 4 July 1789, he was transferred \\"naked as a worm\\" to the insane asylum at Charenton near Paris, two days after he reportedly incited unrest outside the prison by shouting to the crowds gathered there, \\"They are killing the prisoners here!\\" Sade was unable to retrieve the manuscript before being removed from the prison. The storming of the Bastille, a major event of the French Revolution, occurred ten days after Sade left, on 14 July. To his despair, he believed that the manuscript was destroyed in the storming of the Bastille, though it was actually saved by a man named Arnoux de Saint-Maximin two days before the Bastille was attacked. It is not known why Saint-Maximin chose to bring the manuscript to safety, nor indeed is anything else about him known. In 1790, Sade was released from Charenton after the new National Constituent Assembly abolished the instrument of lettre de cachet. His wife obtained a divorce soon afterwards. Return to freedom, delegate to the National Convention, and imprisonment During Sade's time of freedom, beginning in 1790, he published several of his books anonymously. He met Marie-Constance Quesnet, a former actress with a six-year-old son, who had been abandoned by her husband. Constance and Sade stayed together for the rest of his life. He initially adapted the new political order after the revolution, supported the Republic, called himself \\"Citizen Sade\\", and managed to obtain several official positions despite his aristocratic background. Because of the damage done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, he was elected to the National Convention, where he represented the far left. He was a member of the Piques section, notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of direct vote. However, there is much evidence suggesting that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the aide-de-camp to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save himself. Later that year, his name was added‚Äîwhether by error or wilful malice‚Äîto the list of √©migr√©s of the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department. While claiming he was opposed to the Reign of Terror in 1793, he wrote an admiring eulogy for Jean-Paul Marat. At this stage, he was becoming publicly critical of Maximilien Robespierre and, on 5 December, he was removed from his posts, accused of moderatism, and imprisoned for almost a year. He was released in 1794 after the end of the Reign of Terror. In 1796, now completely destitute, he had to sell his ruined castle in Lacoste. Imprisonment for his writings and death Justine, one of the works for which he was imprisoned In 1801, Napoleon Bonaparte ordered the arrest of the anonymous author of Justine and Juliette. Sade was arrested at his publisher's office and imprisoned without trial; first in the Sainte-P√©lagie Prison and, following allegations that he had tried to seduce young fellow prisoners there, in the harsh Bic√™tre Asylum. After intervention by his family, he was declared insane in 1803 and transferred once more to the Charenton Asylum. His ex-wife and children had agreed to pay his pension there. Constance, pretending to be his relative, was allowed to live with him at Charenton. The director of the institution, Abb√© de Coulmier, allowed and encouraged him to stage several of his plays, with the inmates as actors, to be viewed by the Parisian public. Coulmier's novel approaches to psychotherapy attracted much opposition. In 1809, new police orders put Sade into solitary confinement and deprived him of pens and paper. In 1813, the government ordered Coulmier to suspend all theatrical performances. Sade began a sexual relationship with 14-year-old Madeleine LeClerc, daughter of an employee at Charenton. This lasted some four years, until his death in 1814. He had left instructions in his will forbidding that his body be opened for any reason whatsoever, and that it remain untouched for 48 hours in the chamber in which he died, and then placed in a coffin and buried on his property located in Malmaison near √âpernon. These instructions were not followed; he was buried at Charenton. His skull was later removed from the grave for phrenological examination. His son had all his remaining unpublished manuscripts burned, including the immense multi-volume work Les Journ√©es de Florbelle. Appraisal and criticism Numerous writers and artists, especially those concerned with sexuality, have been both repelled and fascinated by Sade. He has garnered the title of rapist and pedophile, and critics have debated whether his work has any redeeming value. An article in The Independent, a British online newspaper, gives contrasting views: the French novelist Pierre Guyotat said, \\"Sade is, in a way, our Shakespeare. He has the same sense of tragedy, the same sweeping grandeur\\" while anarchist philosopher Michel Onfray said, \\"it is intellectually bizarre to make Sade a hero... Even according to his most hero-worshipping biographers, this man was a sexual delinquent\\". The contemporary rival pornographer R√©tif de la Bretonne published an Anti-Justine in 1798. Geoffrey Gorer, an English anthropologist and author (1905‚Äì1985), wrote one of the earliest books on Sade, entitled The Revolutionary Ideas of the Marquis de Sade in 1935. He pointed out that Sade was in complete opposition to contemporary philosophers for both his \\"complete and continual denial of the right to property\\" and for viewing the struggle in late 18th century French society as being not between \\"the Crown, the bourgeoisie, the aristocracy or the clergy, or sectional interests of any of these against one another\\", but rather all of these \\"more or less united against the proletariat.\\" By holding these views, he cut himself off entirely from the revolutionary thinkers of his time to join those of the mid- nineteenth century. Thus, Gorer argued, \\"he can with some justice be called the first reasoned socialist.\\" Simone de Beauvoir (in her essay Must we burn Sade?, published in Les Temps modernes, December 1951 and January 1952) and other writers have attempted to locate traces of a radical philosophy of freedom in Sade's writings, preceding modern existentialism by some 150 years. He has also been seen as a precursor of Sigmund Freud's psychoanalysis in his focus on sexuality as a motive force. The surrealists admired him as one of their forerunners, and Guillaume Apollinaire famously called him \\"the freest spirit that has yet existed\\". Pierre Klossowski, in his 1947 book Sade Mon Prochain (\\"Sade My Neighbour\\"), analyzes Sade's philosophy as a precursor of nihilism, negating Christian values and the materialism of the Enlightenment. One of the essays in Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) is titled \\"Juliette, or Enlightenment and Morality\\" and interprets the ruthless and calculating behavior of Juliette as the embodiment of the philosophy of enlightenment. Similarly, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan posited in his 1963 essay Kant avec Sade that Sade's ethics was the complementary completion of the categorical imperative originally formulated by Immanuel Kant. However, at least one philosopher has rejected Adorno and Horkheimer's claim that Sade's moral skepticism is actually coherent, or that it reflects Enlightenment thought, and concludes it fits better into the emerging Counter-Enlightenment of the time. A similarity to the later philosophy of Max Stirner and Friedrich Nietzsche along with Nazi ideology has also been claimed, although it is admitted that no evidence exists for the Nazis being directly inspired by De Sade (Nietzsche however didn't read him). In his 1988 Political Theory and Modernity, William E. Connolly analyzes Sade's Philosophy in the Bedroom as an argument against earlier political philosophers, notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Thomas Hobbes, and their attempts to reconcile nature, reason, and virtue as bases of ordered society. Similarly, Camille PagliaPaglia, Camille. (1990) Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson. NY: Vintage, , Chapter 8, \\"Return of the Great Mother: Rousseau vs. Sade\\". argued that Sade can be best understood as a satirist, responding \\"point by point\\" to Rousseau's claims that society inhibits and corrupts mankind's innate goodness: Paglia notes that Sade wrote in the aftermath of the French Revolution, when Rousseauist Jacobins instituted the bloody Reign of Terror and Rousseau's predictions were brutally disproved. \\"Simply follow nature, Rousseau declares. Sade, laughing grimly, agrees.\\"Paglia (1990), p. 235 In The Sadeian Woman: And the Ideology of Pornography (1979), Angela Carter provides a feminist reading of Sade, seeing him as a \\"moral pornographer\\" who creates spaces for women. Similarly, Susan Sontag defended both Sade and Georges Bataille's Histoire de l'≈ìil (Story of the Eye) in her essay \\"The Pornographic Imagination\\" (1967) on the basis their works were transgressive texts, and argued that neither should be censored. By contrast, Andrea Dworkin saw Sade as the exemplary woman-hating pornographer, supporting her theory that pornography inevitably leads to violence against women. One chapter of her book Pornography: Men Possessing Women (1979) is devoted to an analysis of Sade. Susie Bright claims that Dworkin's first novel Ice and Fire, which is rife with violence and abuse, can be seen as a modern retelling of Sade's Juliette.Andrea Dworkin has Died, from Susie Bright's Journal, 11 April 2005. Retrieved 23 November 2006 In his doctoral thesis G. T. Roche, a New Zealand philosopher, argued that Sade, contrary to what some have claimed, did indeed express a specific philosophical worldview. He identifies a number of positions Sade had argued for, including antitheism, atheism, determinism, hedonism, materialism, moral relativism, moral nihilism and proto-Social Darwinism. He also criticizes Sade's views, seeing in the last (along with blaming the Jews for creating the \\"weak\\" religion Christianity) a precursor to Adolf Hitler's philosophy (though also not claiming a direct link, i.e. that Hitler in fact read Sade). However, he has also said Sade's views cannot be blamed on Enlightenment philosophy nor inspired the Holocaust, contra Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer in their work Dialectic of Enlightenment (rather, he associates both of them with the emerging Counter-Enlightenment, seeing similarities here to Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophy too), while also elucidating differences Sade had from Nazis' views. Additionally, he criticizes the idea Sade demonstrated morality cannot be based on reason. Influence Sexual sadism disorder, a mental condition named after Sade, has been defined as experiencing sexual arousal in response to extreme pain, suffering or humiliation done non-consensually to others (as described in Sade's novels).American Psychiatric Association. (2013). Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed.). Arlington, VA: American Psychiatric Publishing. Other terms have been used to describe the condition, which may overlap with other sexual preferences that also involve inflicting pain. It is distinct from situations where consenting individuals use mild or simulated pain or humiliation for sexual excitement.Freund, K., & Blanchard, R. (1986). The concept of courtship disorder. Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy, 12, 79‚Äì92. Various influential cultural figures have expressed a great interest in Sade's work, including the French philosopher Michel Foucault, the American film maker John Waters and the Spanish filmmaker Jes√∫s Franco. The poet Algernon Charles Swinburne is also said to have been highly influenced by Sade. Nikos Nikolaidis' 1979 film The Wretches Are Still Singing was shot in a surreal way with a predilection for the aesthetics of the Marquis de Sade; Sade is said to have influenced Romantic and Decadent authors such as Charles Baudelaire, Gustave Flaubert, and Rachilde; and to have influenced a growing popularity of nihilism in Western thought.https://home.isi.org/dostoevsky-vs-marquis-de-sade Dostoevsky vs the Marquis de Sade Sade's notions on strength and weakness and good and evil, such as the \\"equilibrium\\" of good and evil in the world required by Nature which the monk Cl√©ment mentions in Justine,Sade, Marquis de, (1990) [1791], Justine, Philosophy in the Bedroom, & Other Writings, Grove Press, p. 608: \\"...there you have [Nature's] scheme: a perpetual action and reaction, a host of vices, a host of virtues, in one word, a perfect equilibrium resulting from the equality of good and evil on earth.\\" may have also been a considerable influence on Friedrich Nietzsche, particularly concerning the views on good and evil in Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morality (1887). The philosopher of egoist anarchism, Max Stirner, is also speculated to have been influenced by Sade's work. Serial killer Ian Brady, who with Myra Hindley carried out torture and murder of children known as the Moors murders in England during the 1960s, was fascinated by Sade, and the suggestion was made at their trial and appeals that the tortures of the children (the screams and pleadings of whom they tape-recorded) were influenced by Sade's ideas and fantasies. According to Donald Thomas, who has written a biography on Sade, Brady and Hindley had read very little of Sade's actual work; the only book of his they possessed was an anthology of excerpts that included none of his most extreme writings.Donald Thomas, The Marquis de Sade (Allison & Busby 1992) In the two suitcases found by the police that contained books that belonged to Brady was The Life and Ideas of the Marquis de Sade.Duncan Staff, The Lost Boy, p.156 Hindley herself claimed that Brady would send her to obtain books by Sade, and that after reading them he became sexually aroused and beat her. In Philosophy in the Bedroom Sade proposed the use of induced abortion for social reasons and population control, marking the first time the subject had been discussed in public. It has been suggested that Sade's writing influenced the subsequent medical and social acceptance of abortion in Western society. Cultural depictions Depiction of the Marquis de Sade by H. Biberstein in L'≈íuvre du marquis de Sade, Guillaume Apollinaire (Edit.), Biblioth√®que des Curieux, Paris, 1912 There have been many and varied references to the Marquis de Sade in popular culture, including fictional works and biographies. The eponym of the psychological and subcultural term sadism, his name is used variously to evoke sexual violence, licentiousness, and freedom of speech.Phillips, John, 2005, The Marquis De Sade: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, . In modern culture his works are simultaneously viewed as masterful analyses of how power and economics work, and as erotica.Guins, Raiford, and Cruz, Omayra Zaragoza, 2005, Popular Culture: A Reader, Sage Publications, . On a conventional moral view in Sade's time as today, Sade was incarcerated because his predilection for sexual and corporal abuse of vulnerable individuals made him a serious danger to the public. On the other hand, it could be argued that Sade's sexually explicit works were a medium for the articulation but also for the exposure of the corrupt and hypocritical values of the elite in his society, and that it was primarily this inconvenient and embarrassing satire that led to his long-term detention. On the second view he becomes a symbol of the artist's struggle with the censor and that of the moral philosopher with the constraints of conventional morality. Sade's use of pornographic devices to create provocative works that subvert the prevailing moral values of his time inspired many other artists in a variety of media. The cruelties depicted in his works gave rise to the concept of sadism. Sade's works have to this day been kept alive by certain artists and intellectuals because they themselves espouse a philosophy of extreme individualism.MacNair, Brian, 2002, Striptease Culture: Sex, Media and the Democratization of Desire, Routledge, . But Sade's life was lived in flat contradiction and breach of Kant's injunction to treat others as ends in themselves and never merely as means to an agent's own ends. In the late 20th century, there was a resurgence of interest in Sade; leading French intellectuals like Roland Barthes, Jacques Lacan, Jacques Derrida, and Michel Foucault published studies of the philosopher, and interest in Sade among scholars and artists continued. In the realm of visual arts, many surrealist artists had interest in the \\"Divine Marquis.\\" Sade was celebrated in surrealist periodicals, and feted by figures such as Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul √âluard, and Maurice Heine; Man Ray admired Sade because he and other surrealists viewed him as an ideal of freedom. The first Manifesto of Surrealism (1924) announced that \\"Sade is surrealist in sadism\\", and extracts of the original draft of Justine were published in Le Surr√©alisme au service de la r√©volution.Bate, David, 2004, Photography and Surrealism: Sexuality, Colonialism and Social Dissent, I.B. Tauris, . In literature, Sade is referenced in several stories by horror and science fiction writer (and author of Psycho) Robert Bloch, while Polish science fiction author Stanis≈Çaw Lem wrote an essay analyzing the game theory arguments appearing in Sade's Justine. The writer Georges Bataille applied Sade's methods of writing about sexual transgression to shock and provoke readers. Sade's life and works have been the subject of numerous fictional plays, films, pornographic or erotic drawings, etchings, and more. These include Peter Weiss's play Marat/Sade, a fantasia extrapolating from the fact that Sade directed plays performed by his fellow inmates at the Charenton asylum.Dancyger, Ken, 2002, The Technique of Film and Video Editing: History, Theory, and Practice, Focal Press, . Yukio Mishima, Barry Yzereef, and Doug Wright also wrote plays about Sade; Weiss's and Wright's plays have been made into films. His work is referenced on film at least as early as Luis Bu√±uel's L'√Çge d'Or (1930), the final segment of which provides a coda to 120 Days of Sodom, with the four debauched noblemen emerging from their mountain retreat. In 1969, American International Films released a German-made production called de Sade, with Keir Dullea in the title role. Pier Paolo Pasolini filmed Sal√≤, or the 120 Days of Sodom (1975), updating Sade's novel to the brief Sal√≤ Republic; Beno√Æt Jacquot's Sade and Philip Kaufman's Quills (from the play of the same name by Doug Wright) both hit cinemas in 2000. Quills, inspired by Sade's imprisonment and battles with the censorship in his society, portrays him (Geoffrey Rush) as a literary freedom fighter who is a martyr to the cause of free expression.Raengo, Alessandra, and Stam, Robert, 2005, Literature and Film: A Guide to the Theory and Practice of Film Adaptation, Blackwell, . Sade is a 2000 French film directed by Beno√Æt Jacquot starring Daniel Auteuil as the Marquis de Sade, which was adapted by Jacques Fieschi and Bernard Minoret from the novel La terreur dans le boudoir by Serge Bramly. Often Sade himself has been depicted in American popular culture less as a revolutionary or even as a libertine and more akin to a sadistic, tyrannical villain. For example, in the final episode of the television series Friday the 13th: The Series, Micki, the female protagonist, travels back in time and ends up being imprisoned and tortured by Sade. Similarly, in the horror film Waxwork, Sade is among the film's wax villains to come alive. While not personally depicted, Sade's writings feature prominently in the novel Too Like the Lightning, first book in the Terra Ignota sequence written by Ada Palmer. Palmer's depiction of 25th century Earth relies heavily on the philosophies and prominent figureheads of the Enlightenment, such as Voltaire and Denis Diderot in addition to Sade, and in the book the narrator Mycroft, after showing his fictional \\"reader\\" a sex scene formulated off of Sade's own, takes this imaginary reader's indignation as an opportunity to delve into Sade's ideas. Additionally, one of the central locations in the novel, a brothel advertising itself as a \\"bubble of the 18th century\\", features an inscription over the proprietor's door dedicating the establishment as a temple to Sade, an homage to Voltaire's \\"Le Temple du go√ªt, par M. de Voltaire.\\" Writing=Literary criticism The Marquis de Sade viewed Gothic fiction as a genre that relied heavily on magic and phantasmagoria. In his literary criticism Sade sought to prevent his fiction from being labeled \\"Gothic\\" by emphasizing Gothic's supernatural aspects as the fundamental difference from themes in his own work. But while he sought this separation he believed the Gothic played a necessary role in society and discussed its roots and its uses. He wrote that the Gothic novel was a perfectly natural, predictable consequence of the revolutionary sentiments in Europe. He theorized that the adversity of the period had rightfully caused Gothic writers to \\"look to hell for help in composing their alluring novels.\\" Sade held the work of writers Matthew Lewis and Ann Radcliffe high above other Gothic authors, praising the brilliant imagination of Radcliffe and pointing to Lewis' The Monk as without question the genre's best achievement. Sade nevertheless believed that the genre was at odds with itself, arguing that the supernatural elements within Gothic fiction created an inescapable dilemma for both its author and its readers. He argued that an author in this genre was forced to choose between elaborate explanations of the supernatural or no explanation at all and that in either case the reader was unavoidably rendered incredulous. Despite his celebration of The Monk, Sade believed that there was not a single Gothic novel that had been able to overcome these problems, and that a Gothic novel that did would be universally regarded for its excellence in fiction. Many assume that Sade's criticism of the Gothic novel is a reflection of his frustration with sweeping interpretations of works like Justine. Within his objections to the lack of verisimilitude in the Gothic may have been an attempt to present his own work as the better representation of the whole nature of man. Since Sade professed that the ultimate goal of an author should be to deliver an accurate portrayal of man, it is believed that Sade's attempts to separate himself from the Gothic novel highlights this conviction. For Sade, his work was best suited for the accomplishment of this goal in part because he was not chained down by the supernatural silliness that dominated late 18th-century fiction. Moreover, it is believed that Sade praised The Monk (which displays Ambrosio's sacrifice of his humanity to his unrelenting sexual appetite) as the best Gothic novel chiefly because its themes were the closest to those within his own work. Libertine novels Sade's fiction has been classified under different genres, including pornography, Gothic, and baroque. Sade's most famous books are often classified not as Gothic but as libertine novels, and include the novels Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue; Juliette; The 120 Days of Sodom; and Philosophy in the Bedroom. These works challenge traditional perceptions of sexuality, religion, law, age, and gender. His opinions on sexual violence, sadism, and pedophilia stunned even those contemporaries of Sade who were quite familiar with the dark themes of the Gothic novel during its popularity in the late 18th century. Suffering is the primary rule, as in these novels one must often decide between sympathizing with the torturer or the victim. While these works focus on the dark side of human nature, the magic and phantasmagoria that dominates the Gothic is noticeably absent and is the primary reason these works are not considered to fit the genre. Through the unreleased passions of his libertines, Sade wished to shake the world at its core. With 120 Days, for example, Sade wished to present \\"the most impure tale that has ever been written since the world exists.\\" Despite his literary attempts at evil, his characters and stories often fell into repetition of sexual acts and philosophical justifications. Simone de Beauvoir and Georges Bataille have argued that the repetitive form of his libertine novels, though hindering the artfulness of his prose, ultimately strengthened his individualist arguments. The repetitive and obsessive nature of the account of Justine's abuse and frustration in her strivings to be a good Christian living a virtuous and pure life may on a superficial reading seem tediously excessive. Paradoxically, however, Sade checks the reader's instinct to treat them as laughable cheap pornography and obscenity by knowingly and artfully interweaving the tale of her trials with extended reflections on individual and social morality. Short fiction In The Crimes of Love, subtitled \\"Heroic and Tragic Tales\\", Sade combines romance and horror, employing several Gothic tropes for dramatic purposes. There is blood, banditti, corpses, and of course insatiable lust. Compared to works like Justine, here Sade is relatively tame, as overt eroticism and torture is subtracted for a more psychological approach. It is the impact of sadism instead of acts of sadism itself that emerge in this work, unlike the aggressive and rapacious approach in his libertine works. The modern volume entitled Gothic Tales collects a variety of other short works of fiction intended to be included in Sade's Contes et Fabliaux d'un Troubadour Provencal du XVIII Siecle. An example is \\"Eug√©nie de Franval\\", a tale of incest and retribution. In its portrayal of conventional moralities it is something of a departure from the erotic cruelties and moral ironies that dominate his libertine works. It opens with a domesticated approach: > To enlighten mankind and improve its morals is the only lesson which we > offer in this story. In reading it, may the world discover how great is the > peril which follows the footsteps of those who will stop at nothing to > satisfy their desires. Descriptions in Justine seem to anticipate Radcliffe's scenery in The Mysteries of Udolpho and the vaults in The Italian, but, unlike these stories, there is no escape for Sade's virtuous heroine, Justine. Unlike the milder Gothic fiction of Radcliffe, Sade's protagonist is brutalized throughout and dies tragically. To have a character like Justine, who is stripped without ceremony and bound to a wheel for fondling and thrashing, would be unthinkable in the domestic Gothic fiction written for the bourgeoisie. Sade even contrives a kind of affection between Justine and her tormentors, suggesting shades of masochism in his heroine.

Wolfe is an American physician and the co-founder and director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a consumer and health advocacy lobbying organization. He has publicly crusaded against many pharmaceutical drugs, which he and his organization believe to be a danger to public health. Biography After earning his medical degree at Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio, Wolfe completed an internship and residency in internal medicine. Beginning in 1966 he researched blood-clotting and alcoholism at the National Institutes of Health. He met consumer advocate Ralph Nader in Washington, D.C. at a meeting of the American Patients Association, and advised Nader on health problems in the United States. Wolfe co-founded the consumer lobbying organization Health Research Group with Nader in 1971 and has been its Director ever since. Since 1995 he has been an Adjunct Professor of Internal Medicine at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine. For more than 30 years, Wolfe campaigned to have propoxyphene (Darvon, Darvocet) removed from the American market, because it can cause heart arrhythmias. In 2009, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel recommended that it be withdrawn from the market. The recommendation to ban the drug was ultimately not upheld and instead manufacturers were required to place additional warning labels on packaging. In 2009, Wolfe was appointed to the FDA's Drug Safety and Risk Management Committee. On November 19, 2010, the FDA recommended against continued prescribing and use of propoxyphene. Other drugs that Wolfe has campaigned against include Yaz, Yasmin, Phenacetin, Oraflex, Zomax, Vioxx,\\"Drug Industry's Longtime Critic Says 'I Told You So'\\", The New York Times, GARDINER HARRIS, February 15, 2005 Baycol\\"Statement of Sidney M.

It is assigned to the USAF Weapons School, based at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada. The 16th began as the 16th Pursuit Squadron on 20 November 1940. During World War II, the 16th Squadron flew missions in New Guinea, India, and China in the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and North American P-51 Mustang. During the Korean War, the 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flew missions from Korea and Japan in the Lockheed F-80 Shooting Star and North American F-86 Sabre. After the Korean War, the 16th was stationed in Japan, Florida, Norway, Turkey, Korea, and Utah, flying missions in the Convair F-102 Delta Dagger and McDonnell F-4 Phantom II aircraft. In January 1979, the 16th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron became the USAF's first F-16A/B operational squadron. History=World War II 16th Fighter Squadron P-47D ThunderboltAircraft is Republic P-47D-30-RA Thunderbolt, serial 44-90248 at Yontan Airfield, Okinawa, 1946. Activated at Hamilton Field, California in 1941 as a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk pursuit squadron to defend the West Coast. Deployed to the CBI in March 1942, initially arriving at Karachi, India moving via Australia and Ceylon. It was assigned to Tenth Air Force. The squadron defended the Indian terminus of The Hump over the Himalayas between India and China and airfields in that area, operating from the Assam Valley of northeast India. The squadron flew strafing, bombing, reconnaissance, and patrol missions in support of Allied ground troops during a Japanese offensive in northern Burma in 1943. Moved to southeast China in October 1943, being assigned to Fourteenth Air Force. The squadron defended the Chinese end of the Hump route and air bases in the Kunming area. Attacked Japanese shipping in the Red River delta of Indochina and supported Chinese ground forces in their late 1944 drive along the Salween River. Was reequipped with North American P-51D Mustangs in 1945 to defend the eastern end of the route over the Hump, and to guard air bases in the Kunming area. They returned to India in the fall of 1945 and sailed for the United States in November. Inactivated on 13 December 1945. Air defense in the Pacific 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-86D SabreAircraft is North American F-86D-35-NA Sabre serial 51-6214, assigned to Naha Air Base, Okinawa, shown at Chia-Yi Afld, Taiwan, 1955. 16th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron F-102A Delta DaggerAircraft is Convair F-102A-75-CO Delta Dagger serial 56-1377 at Naha AB, Okinawa, 1964. Reactivated at Yontan Air Base Okinawa in 1946 and moved to Naha Air Base when Yontan closed in 1947. The squadron was assigned to the 301st Fighter Wing. Pilots engaged in combat operations in the Korean War, 1950‚Äì1953, returned to Naha Air Base to resume air defense coverage of the Ryukyu Islands in 1954. From August 1958 to January 1959, deployed to Tainan Air Base Taiwan to fly combat air support missions for Nationalist Chinese forces after mainland Communist Chinese forces shelled the Nationalist-held islands of Quemoy and Matsu. In the early 1960s, the Air Force was implementing Project Clearwater, an initiative to withdraw Convair F-102 Delta Daggers from overseas bases in order to reduce \\"gold flow\\" (negative foreign currency transactions).McMullen, p. 51 By 1963, part of Clearwater called for the 16th to move to Davis-Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona,The original plan was to move the 16th to Edwards Air Force Base, but military construction costs to base the squadron there were prohibitive, so Davis-Monthan was selected. McMullen, pp. 60‚Äì61 permitting the McDonnell F-101 Voodoos of the 15th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron stationed there to be distributed to other Air Defense Command squadrons. However, the Gulf of Tonkin incident intervened and the 16th was kept in the Pacific to maintain an air defense capability there.McMullen, pp. 63‚Äì64 It deployed F-102s to the Philippines and South Vietnam from August to October 1964 for air defense against possible North Vietnamese air attacks. Tactical fighter operations Returned to the United States, activating at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. Became combat ready in the McDonnell F-4 Phantom II aircraft in December 1965 with a program of tactical training operations to maintain proficiency. Participated in numerous airpower demonstrations, provided close air support of Army troops during tactical exercises, and prepared for overseas deployments. From December 1966 to mid-1967 performed F-4 replacement training. Through deployment of combat-ready tactical components, with personnel and equipment transferred to Pacific Air Forces units upon arrival, the squadron provided fresh aircraft and aircrews for the forces in Southeast Asia, twice relinquished all its resources for combat and remanned in October 1967 and April 1969. Deployed to South Korea, and assumed alert status at Kunsan Kunsan and Osan Air Bases June‚ÄìSeptember 1970, providing air defense, participating in exercises, and maintaining combat readiness. Moved to Hill Air Force Base, Utah, and received first production General Dynamics F-16A Fighting Falcon aircraft to be delivered to an operational squadron on 6 January 1979. Many of the early F-16 pilots went through the 16th Tactical Fighter Training Squadron, as it was the first Replacement Training Unit for the F-16 and acted as a worldwide training unit, training over 240 pilots in the F-16. In April 1983 the unit became the 16th Tactical Fighter Squadron but still kept its training role, although not for beginner pilots but for higher levels of combat training. It was only fitting that as the world's first F-16 squadron that the 16th received the 1,000th F-16 to come off the General Dynamics assembly line on 22 July 1983. During the three years of operational tasking the squadron continued to train and upgrade its pilots to combat ready status and to maintain the capability to deploy worldwide on short notice and employ the F-16 in the conventional air-to-air and air-to-ground combat roles. The unit inactivated on 30 June 1986. Fighter weapons training USAF Fighter Weapons School F-16 flying with a Constant Peg MiG-21 over the Nevada desert, about 1986 Initially there was an F-16 division within the Fighter Weapons School that was created in 1982 and produced its first graduating class. The purpose of the school was to train aircrew in a most realistic combat environment. Reactivated on 3 February 2003 as the 16th Weapons Squadron. The squadron is composed of block 42 and 52's. Only a few days before on 24 January 2003 the squadron officially was redesignated the 16th Weapons Squadron while working towards activation at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada.

The Robert Clagett Farm and Magnolia Plantation are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History Knoxville is situated at the base of South Mountain directly beside the Potomac River to the immediate east of the water gap leading towards Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The first settlers, English and German, began to populate the area in the latter half of the 18th century. By the early 19th century, a village began to form along the main road leading from Frederick, to Harpers Ferry, then the site of one of the two national armories in the United States. The coming of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the establishment of the industrial town of Weverton to the immediate west fueled the growth of Knoxville in the 1840s. In 1849, the Frederick Examiner newspaper reported that Knoxville was flourishing with new businesses and houses. Many of the vernacular and Greek Revival-styled buildings seen in the village today date from the 1840s and 1850s when the railroad, canal, and industry along the Potomac River contributed to Knoxville's growth. In 1851, a German Reformed congregation was founded in Knoxville and a new stone church erected atop Cemetery Hill. Despite the interruption of the Civil War, Knoxville continued to thrive as a local transportation hub throughout the third quarter of the 19th century. Two additional churches were established in the town during these years: a Methodist Episcopal Church in 1869 and a Lutheran church (removed from the village of Weverton) in 1873. In 1890, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad began construction of a massive rail yard in the village of Berlin, to the east. By 1894, Berlin was incorporated as Brunswick, and all industry and transportation activity shifted from Knoxville to the new city.

UK Series Anthems 1991‚Äì2008 is the first in a series of albums released by the Ministry of Sound. The series is split into three mini-series, these are \\"Anthems\\", \\"Chilled\\" and \\"Ibiza\\". There is not an official name for the series, but is often called 'Anthems' after four albums in the series and the first mini- series. Currently, there are eight different albums in the series. The artwork scheme follows the Fifteen Years release of 2006, which is sometimes seen as the pre-runner to Anthems 1991‚Äì2008. The Ibiza 1991‚Äì2009 album notably comes in a 3-CD digipack, rather than the larger fold-away digipacks (which are contained in slipcases) used for the other seven albums. The same album is overlooked when the series is being listed in the booklet for Anthems R&B.; All copies of Chilled Acoustic feature a mistake in the artwork, where the top half of the Ministry of Sound logo used on the reverse side of the digipack; is upside-down. 2011 saw the year with the most releases in the series, with seven being released, four of these featuring 'Anthems' in the name.

He served for many years in the government, acting as a governor of the Nugal region of Somalia in the 1990s and later as the Minister of Finance of the autonomous Puntland region in the northeast. From 8 January 2009 to 8 January 2014, Farole was also the President of Puntland. Farole's multipronged efforts at creating provisions and collaboration with international polities and organizations resulted in a drastic decrease in piracy along the Marinka Gardafuul (Guardafui Channel).Shortland, Anja. \\"Dangers of Success: The Economics of Somali Piracy.\\" Militarised Responses to Transnational Organised Crime. Palgrave Macmillan, Cham, 2018. 169-183. Biography=Early years Farole was born in 1945 in the coastal town of Eyl, situated in the northeastern Nugal region of Somalia. He hails from the Ciise Mohamud sub-clan of the Majeerteen Darod. A multi-linguist, he is fluent in Somali, Arabic, Italian and English.Abdirahman Mohamud Farole's resume (Somali)Puntland Marine Police Force Enters Eyl Education Farole first pursued his post- secondary education locally, earning a Diploma of Public Health in 1964 from the Scuola Professionale Sanitaria in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. The following year, he earned a Diploma in Statistics from the International Statistical Institute of Beirut in Lebanon. In 1985, Farole completed a Bachelor of Commerce in Economics and Commerce from the Somali National University in Mogadishu. He followed that five years later with a Master of Business Administration (Major in Financial Management) from a joint partnership between the Somali National University-SOMTAD and the State University of New York at Albany. In 2005, he added to his resume a Bachelor of Arts (Major in Politics) from La Trobe University in Australia. Career In a professional capacity, Farole worked as a senior officer/manager of major branches in Hargeisa and Berbera, and as a senior auditor/divisional manager of foreign and international departments at the Central Bank of Somalia. From 1970 to 1986, he was also director general at the Commercial & Savings Bank. Top governmental positions Farole has held in the past include a stint as Finance Minister of the northeastern Puntland province of Somalia under the region's first president, Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed, and as governor of the Nugaal region in the 1990s.A historic journey from opposition to the Puntland presidency The political scene: Puntland elects a new regional president He later served as Planning Minister in the regional government of Mohamud \\"Adde\\" Muse Hersi, the former president of Puntland. After a falling out with Muse over a deal with the Australian oil company, Range Resources, Farole spent much of the past decade in suburban Melbourne, Australia, where he was a PhD candidate in history at La Trobe University. His dissertation was on the rebuilding of banks and financial institutions after armed conflict. President of Puntland=Appointment After having reportedly turned down requests from his fellow countrymen to run for office in the past, and with the assurance of support from various political factions, Farole returned to Somalia from Australia to present himself as a candidate in the Puntland region's 2008‚Äì2009 presidential elections. In January 2009, he defeated the nine other candidates, including incumbent President Muse, to become the fourth President of Puntland. Despite weeks of political tension prior to the vote, the election itself was also reportedly peaceful, prompting one US-based observer to suggest that the \\"success of the Puntland elections can begin to provide a model for the whole of Somalia.\\" In his election victory speech, Farole vowed to tackle head-on the pervasive piracy problem off of the Somali coast, including cracking down on local authorities that were then reportedly collaborating with pirates in return for a share of the profits. General reforms Since taking office in 2009, the Farole administration has implemented numerous political reforms, with an emphasis on the expansion and improvement of Puntland's security and judicial sectors. In an effort to improve transparency, the new president issued a first-ever \\"100 Days in Office report\\". To bolster the region's justice system, numerous new prosecutors, judges and other court personnel as well as additional prison guards were hired and trained. In July 2010, the Puntland Council of Ministers unanimously approved a new anti-terrorism law to more efficiently handle terror suspects and their accomplices; a special court is also expected to be established within the region's existing criminal courts system to facilitate the task. Fiscally, a transparent, budget-based public finance system was established, which has reportedly helped increase public confidence in government. More modest reforms were also put into motion in the social sector, particularly in the education and healthcare fields. The regional government hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans underway for school and hospital renovations. Multi-partism On 15 June 2009, the Farole administration passed a new regional draft constitution, which is believed to represent a significant step toward the eventual introduction of a multi-party political system to the region for the first time. Such a system already exists in the adjacent Somaliland region. On 15 April 2012, the Puntland government opened a four-day constitutional convention officially inaugurating the new state constitution. Overseen by the Puntland Electoral Commission (PEC), the constitution represented the final step in the extant regional democratisation process and was scheduled to be followed by the formation of political parties. On 12 September 2012, the Puntland Election Commission announced that the registration process for political parties in Puntland was now open. This came after the passing of the Political Association Law, the Referendum Act, the District Elections Law and the inauguration of the state constitution. With District Council elections slated for early 2013, the three political organisations that have earned the most seats across 21 demarcated districts will then constitute the region's official parties. They will also be challengers in the next elections, scheduled for January 2014. On 12 November 2012, Members of the Puntland State Parliament amended the Puntland Electoral Law after convening in the regional capital of Garowe. The amendment lowers the minimum required number of votes that each political association must secure per province from 500 to 300. It also stipulates that parties should have bureaus open in all of Puntland's eight regions. On 14 November 2012, Farole announced the launching of his new political party, Horseed. The association counts over 200 members and represents the incumbent Puntland government, including Vice-President Abdisamad Ali Shire and the state Ministers. It is the first prospective party to register for an application with the Transitional Puntland Electoral Commission (TPEC). According to Farole, the general public will be eligible for membership in the organisation once it is selected as an official political party. Puntland Agency For Social Welfare In May 2009 the Puntland Agency for Social Welfare (PASWE) was founded. The agency provides medical, educational and counselling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a board of directors, which consists of religious scholars (ulema), businesspeople, intellectuals and traditional elders. Anti-piracy campaign Between 2009 and 2010, the Farole government enacted a number of reforms and pre-emptive measures as a part of its officially declared anti- piracy campaign. The latter include the arrest, trial and conviction of pirate gangs, as well as raids on suspected pirate hideouts and confiscation of weapons and equipment; ensuring the adequate coverage of the regional authority's anti-piracy efforts by both local and international media; sponsoring a social campaign led by Islamic scholars and community activists aimed at discrediting piracy and highlighting its negative effects; and partnering with the NATO alliance to combat pirates at sea. In May 2010, construction also began on a new naval base in the town of Bandar Siyada, located 25 km west of Bosaso, the commercial capital of Puntland. The facility is funded by Puntland's regional government in conjunction with Saracen International, a UK-based security company, and is intended to assist in more effectively combating piracy. The base will include a center for training recruits, and a command post for the naval force. These numerous security measures appear to have borne fruit, as many pirates were apprehended in 2010, including a prominent leader. Puntland's security forces also reportedly managed to force out the pirate gangs from their traditional safe havens such as Eyl and Gar'ad, with the pirates now primarily operating from the Galmudug region to the south. Galgala campaign In August 2010, Puntland security forces launched an offensive against militants led by Mohamed Said Atom, an arms-smuggler on both US and U.N. security watch-lists who had vowed war on the Farole administration. The insurgents were reportedly hiding out in the Galgala hills. Atom had fled just before the attack that left more than 100 militants dead, having reportedly misled his men prior to the Puntland army's offensive by promising reinforcements from the Islamist Al-Shabaab group via the town of Burao in the Somaliland region. By late October, Puntland military personnel had seized the last insurgent outposts, Somalia: Troops seize 'last insurgent outpost' in Galgala: Puntland general though fighting later sporadically flared up again as militants loyal to Atom attempted to ambush Puntland soldiers.Somalia: Puntland Government Forces Kill 21 Al Shabaab Militants Two Puntland Forces Dead in Fighting With Atom Galmudug Accord Farole in 2013 In response to sporadic targeted assassination attempts by Al-Shabaab militants against Puntland public officials in the north-central city of Galkayo, the Farole administration in 2010‚Äì2011 launched a police crackdown and set in motion comprehensive administrative reform.Retired Puntland official killed in Galka'yo; calm returns in northern Somalia after clashSOMALIA: Puntland President fires Mudug governor, dissolves Galkaio district council The Puntland and Galmudug authorities subsequently signed an accord in Garowe in February 2011, officially agreeing to co-operate on security, economic and social matters so as to strengthen inter-regional relations.An Agreement Jointly Signed by Puntland and Galmudug In April of that year, the Puntland government also replaced the Mudug region's Governor and his deputies and dissolved the local district council. A separate interim regional committee tasked with assuring security was also set up. Puntland Maritime Police Force Following a Puntland-Transitional Federal Government cooperative agreement in August 2011 calling for the creation of a Somali Marine Force, of which the already established Puntland Maritime Police Force (PMPF) would form a part, the Farole administration resumed training of PMPF naval officials. The Puntland Maritime Police Force is a locally recruited, professional maritime security force that is primarily aimed at fighting piracy off of the coast of Somalia, safeguarding the nation's marine resources, and providing logistics support to humanitarian efforts.Puntland Government Delivers Food and Water Supported by the United Arab Emirates, PMPF officials are also trained by the Japanese Coast Guard.Puntland: Fight Pirates on Land Post-transition In February 2012, Farole and other Somali government officials met in Garowe, Puntland's administrative capital, to discuss post-transition arrangements following the end of the TFG's mandate in August 2012. After extensive deliberations attended by regional actors and international observers, the conference ended in a signed agreement between President Farole, TFG President Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, Prime Minister Abdiweli Mohamed Ali, Speaker of Parliament Sharif Hassan Sheikh Aden, Galmudug President Mohamed Ahmed Alim and Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a representative Khalif Abdulkadir Noor stipulating that: a) a new 225 member bicameral parliament would be formed, consisting of an upper house seating 54 Senators as well as a lower house; b) 30% of the National Constituent Assembly (NCA) is earmarked for women; c) the President is to be appointed via a constitutional election; and d) the Prime Minister is selected by the President and he/she then names his/her Cabinet. The agreements were known as the Garowe Principles.Second Garowe Conference Concludes On 23 June 2012, Farole and the Somali federal and regional leaders met again and approved a draft constitution after several days of deliberation. The new law was scheduled to be ratified by the National Constituent Assembly, with a plebiscite then expected to be held to render the bill permanent. On 23 June 2012, the Somali federal and regional leaders met again and approved a draft constitution after several days of deliberation. The National Constituent Assembly overwhelmingly passed the new constitution on 1 August, with 96% voting for it, 2% against it, and 2% abstaining. Term extension In late 2012, Farole announced his intention to extend his term as President of Puntland for one more year, pushing back regional elections to 2014. The move was met with resistance by many public officials and civilians, who asserted that he had been elected in the 2008 presidential elections to serve over a four-year period, with the next ballot scheduled to take place in January 2013. Farole argued that the new Puntland Constitution, adopted in April 2012, mandated his administration to serve a five-year-term. Street protests in connection with the term extension were held in Qardho on the eve of Farole's fourth anniversary in office, but were reportedly free of violence. Anti-riot police were also deployed in the littoral hub of Bosaso to ensure security. In his speech marking the historic day, Farole highlighted his administration's various achievements during its tenure, particularly in terms of commerce and counter-piracy operations. The remarks came after the Puntland parliament had on 7 January approved a $49 million state budget for the year, up $10.6 million from 2012's budget. Oil exploration In 2012, the Farole administration gave the green light to the first official oil exploration project in Puntland and Somalia at large.Red Emperor, Range rally on Puntland drilling update Somalia: President Farole returns to Puntland Led by the Canadian oil company Africa Oil and its partner Range Resources, initial drilling in the Shabeel-1 well on Puntland's Dharoor Block in March of the year successfully yielded oil. 2014 Puntland presidential election In 2013, Farole ran for a second term as President of the autonomous Puntland state in the northeastern region's 2014 elections. On 8 January 2014, the first and second rounds of voting saw 9 of the 11 presidential contenders eliminated from the running, with Farole and former Prime Minister of Somalia Abdiweli Mohamed Ali left to face off in the third round. Farole initially led the final round with 31 votes, with Ali receiving 18 votes. However, a late rally by Ali saw him eventually win the election, narrowly defeating Farole by 33 votes to 32. In his acceptance speech, Ali expressed gratitude for the opportunity as well as the work of the Farole administration. He also pledged to defend and adhere to the Puntland Constitution. For his part, Farole indicated that he accepted the outcome of the election, and felicitated Ali on his victory.

Its exact location has been debated, but the most popular one (marked by Virginia Historical Marker QA-6) is on a bluff about four blocks north of the corner of W. Washington and N. South Streets in Petersburg. Fort Henry was built in 1645 by order of the House of Burgesses. It marked the 1646 treaty frontier between the white settlers and the Indians following the Second Anglo-Powhatan War. It was situated at the fall line of the Piedmont, near the Appomattoc Indian tribe. From 1646 until around 1691, it was the only point in Virginia where Indians could be authorized to cross eastward into white territory, or whites westward into Indian territory. In later years it also came to be known as Fort Wood, after its first commander, Abraham Wood (1614-82). He used the fort as a base for several exploratory expeditions of the region. In 1675, command of the fort and adjacent Indian trading post passed to Wood's son-in-law, Peter Jones. The post became known as \\"Peter's Point\\". With trade and related settlement, eventually the city of Petersburg developed here. At some unknown point the original fort fell into ruins. The first Fort Henry in the colony was a small facility, with a garrison of 15, that was erected in 1610 by Thomas Gates as part of a series of fortifications now located in Hampton. This was defunct by the time the fort on the Appomattox was built.

Possessing a wide vocal range with a significant amount of power and flexibility, Wilt sang a wide repertoire that encompassed the operas of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the German operas of Richard Wagner, the grand operas of Giuseppe Verdi, and the bel canto operas of Bellini, Rossini, and Donizetti. She sang for many years at the Vienna Hofoper (now Vienna State Opera) and for a number of seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London. She notably portrayed the role of Sulamith in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba in 1875. Also a regular performer of the concert repertoire, Wilt often appeared in performances of works by Beethoven, Haydn, and Mendelssohn. Biography=Early life and education Born in Vienna, with the name Marie Liebenthaler, Wilt was orphaned as a young child and adopted by a family with the surname Tremier. Beginning in her teenage years, she sang in choirs in Vienna and occasionally appeared as a soloist. She married Franz Wilt, a banker, in 1855 and for the next several years worked as a housewife while still singing in choirs. She joined the Wiener Singakademie in 1858 and drew the attention of its director, Johann von Herbeck, who gave her solos in the oratorios and other large works the ensemble performed. Under Herbeck's persuasion and the influence of Belgian soprano D√©sir√©e Art√¥t she began to study singing with Joseph G√§nsbacher. Career and later life Wilt made her professional opera d√©but as Donna Anna in Mozart's Don Giovanni with Oper Graz in 1865. She repeated the role later that year at the Berlin State Opera, but had to leave the production in the middle of the opera's run due to carbon monoxide poisoning.Biography of Marie Wilt on Operissimo.com (in German).

She notably portrayed the role of Donna Elvira in Mozart's Don Giovanni for the opening of Vienna's new opera house in 1869. She also sang the title role in Verdi's Aida for the Austrian premiere of that opera in 1874 and portrayed the role of Sulamith in the world premiere of Karl Goldmark's Die K√∂nigin von Saba in 1875. Her other roles with the company included the Queen of the Night in Mozart's The Magic Flute, bel canto operas by Donizetti and Bellini, and several Wagner and Verdi heroines among others. While singing with the Vienna Hofoper, Wilt also traveled periodically throughout Europe to appear as a guest artist in numerous operas and concerts. She was particularly admired for her performances of the soprano solos in Verdi's Requiem, Beethoven's 9th symphony, Beethoven's Missa solemnis, and the concert works of Haydn and Mendelssohn. She sang in concerts and operas in Frankfurt and Mannheim in 1868, Prague in 1869, and Riga in 1871. In 1873 she sang in concerts at the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in D√ºsseldorf and Aachen, and in Bonn for the celebration Robert Schumann.

The extended play was released as a promotional tool, and was not to be taken as her official musical debut. The album was used to promote Cosgrove's single of the same name, released in the final quarter of 2008. Aside from featuring remixes of previous promotional singles of Cosgrove's, the album also featured two tracks, \\"FYI\\" and \\"Party Girl\\". It is a cover of the Sugababes hit single of the same name. It did, however, help boost sales of the single, \\"About You Now\\". The single became Cosgrove's second song to chart on Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, peaking at number 47, her highest peak to date. The single also became her first single to chart internationally, peaking at number 79 in the United Kingdom. Cosgrove promoted the single and the accompanying album mainly through interviews and performances. Cosgrove performed \\"About You Now\\" at the 2009 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The single was also performed on Today, along with some of Cosgrove's songs from her official debut studio album, Sparks Fly. The other songs were the lead single, \\"Kissin U\\", as well as the album's second track, \\"BAM\\". Background and development Cosgrove's musical career first began with her recording the theme song of the Nickelodeon television series iCarly called \\"Leave It All to Me\\", on which Cosgrove stars as the title character on the show. The song features her former Drake & Josh castmate Drake Bell, and was written by Michael Corcoran, one of Bell's band members. Following the success of iCarly, Columbia Records released a soundtrack album of the show on June 10, 2008. The soundtrack album included four songs recorded by Cosgrove that were \\"Leave It All to Me\\", \\"Stay My Baby\\", \\"About You Know\\" and \\"Headphones On\\". Cosgrove stated, \\"Before that, I didn't see myself making an album, but when I spent time in the studio doing the theme song and saw how much fun it was, I wanted to go back.\\"Miranda Cosgrove Makes Sparks Fly With Top 10 Debut Billboard.com In July 2008, she officially announced plans for a debut album, stating that the album was \\"different\\" from her contributions to the iCarly soundtrack, with her \\"co-writing and getting really into it\\", and saying that \\"[I'm] playing a character on iCarly, but this shows more of myself. Some people might think I'm just another actress putting out an album, but I wanted to prove that I'm more than that.\\" The album took two years to make, with Columbia Records' marketing manager Chris Poppe stating in May 2010 that \\"Miranda started working on [the album] at 14, and she's 16 now. The difference between those two ages is huge, and the songs have had to grow along with her.\\" On February 5, 2009, Cosgrove released her debut solo recording; the 5-song EP About You Now exclusively onto the iTunes Store. The EP included the title track \\"About You Now\\", a remix of it, a remix of \\"Stay My Baby\\", \\"F.Y.I.\\" and \\"Party Girl\\". Composition The first track on the album is \\"About You Now\\". Musically, the song is a mid-tempo pop-rock track, that follows a verse to chorus guideline. The song, a cover of the Sugababes hit single, lyrically speaks of a girl who is over a fight her and her intimate other had, and now knows how she feels \\"about him now\\". The single has proven to be a hit for Cosgrove in the US. On the Billboard Hot 100, the single is her highest peaking so to date, currently holding a peak of number 47. The single has also been her most successful in the United Kingdom, where it debuted and peaked at number 97. \\"About You Now\\" was also featured on the hit compilation album, Now That's What I Call Music! 30. \\"FYI\\" is the second song on the album. Musically, the song is an uptempo punk rock type of song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's romantic feelings for someone, and the song follows Cosgrove expressing her feelings for him in the lyrics. \\"Party Girl\\", the third track on the album, has more of a pop feel than the rest of the album. Musically, it is an uptemp pop song, that lyrically speaks of Cosgrove's longing to party and hang out with her friends. Also included on the extended play are two remixes. The first of these is the spider remix of \\"Stay My Baby\\", a promotional single recently released by Cosgrove from the soundtrack to her iCarly television series. The song, originally a ballad, has now been given a pop and dance beat. Lyrically, the song speaks of Cosgrove knowing that everything will be okay, as long as he \\"stays her baby\\". The final track on the album is the Spider Remix of \\"About You Now\\". The new version of the album has removed the guitar from the song and replaced it with more of an electropop type of sound. Critical reception Commonsensemedia stated that \\"While Cosgrove's acting career has advanced considerably, her singing sounds similar to her passable vocal performance in School of Rock. Problem is, that was six years ago, when Cosgrove was nine years old. As a result, the synth-pop pattern that pervades so much of today's tween music doesn't come across as well for Cosgrove as it does for other bubblegum popsters with slightly stronger voices, like Miley Cyrus and Jordan McCoy. No doubt her TV popularity will still draw fans to this EP, but the release won't go down as one of the better ones in tween-music history.\\" In their review of the album, The Daily Vault stated \\"As it turns out, Cosgrove is tackling non- tween material, trying to convince her adult listeners she's not as young as you might think. She wants to go back in time to a previous point in her relationship with the subject in the disc's title track since she \\"knows how I feel about you now.\\" She sings about how girls \\"dig rejection\\" and how she'd rather \\"rock, that's how I roll\\" in \\"FYI.\\" Finally, in the third original track on this EP, she spouts on and on about how \\"you can take the rock out of the roll but you can't take the party out of the girl\\" in \\"Party Girl.\\" Finally, in \\"Stay My Baby,\\" she speculates about being in a long distance relationship when \\"she's back at school,\\" which I infer as being college? So, Cosgrove is tackling adult problems while singing to a tween audience.\\" Promotion and performances The song \\"About You Now\\" was first performed live during the 2008 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. The performance saw Cosgrove singing the song while on a float. During the Summer of 2010, Cosgrove embarked on a radio promotional tour, and has made appearances at radio concerts. On September 6, 2010, she performed \\"Kissin U\\", \\"BAM\\", which was written and produced by Rock Mafia and Darkchild, and \\"About You Now\\", which is a cover, co-written by Cathy Dennis and Dr. Luke who produced it and was originally recorded by the Sugababes and released as a single on their fifth studio album Change, on Today. Cosgrove headlined her own tour, titled Dancing Crazy Tour which is named after Cosgrove's new single \\"Dancing Crazy\\" co-written by Avril Lavigne and Max Martin and Shellback, who produced it and will be released on Cosgrove's second EP High Maintenance, released on March 15, 2011. The tour began January 24, 2011 and ended February 24, 2011. The tour featured dates in House of Blues locations such as ones located in Houston, TX and Anaheim, CA.

Holttum praised his act later. Returning from Great Britain, where he departed to in 1925, Holttum continued his job as the Garden's director, until he moved to the University of Malaya in Singapore to serve as its first Professor of Botany. Holttum penned many books during his tenure at the educational institution, including Gardening at the lowlands of the Malays (which is credited as the first book on Singaporean gardening) and Plant Life in Malaya. He was also the first head of department for Botany at the Department of Biological Sciences at the National University of Singapore. He founded the Malayan Orchid Society (now Orchid Society of South East Asia) in 1928. He went back to England later in 1954. Holttum's area of interest was pteridology, such as that of Malayan ferns. Death Spending some time at the Kew Gardens to work, Holttum died 18 September 1990 in Roehampton, London, aged 95.

Francis Daniel Pastorius authored the petition; he and three other Quakers living in Germantown, Pennsylvania (now part of Philadelphia) signed it on behalf of the Germantown Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends. Clearly a highly controversial document, Friends forwarded it up the hierarchical chain of their administrative structure--monthly, quarterly, and yearly meetings--without either approving or rejecting it. The petition effectively disappeared for 150 years into Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's capacious archives; but upon rediscovery in 1844 by Philadelphia antiquarian Nathan Kite, latter-day abolitionists published it in 1844 in The Friend, (Vol. XVII, No. 16.) in support of their antislavery agitation. Historical background The colony of Pennsylvania was founded in 1682 by William Penn as a place where people from any country and faith could settle, free from religious persecution. In payment of a debt to Penn's father, Penn had received from King Charles II a large land grant west of New Jersey which Charles II named Pennsylvania after William's father, Admiral William Penn. Penn had become a friend of George Fox, the founder of the Society of Friends, who were pejoratively nicknamed \\"Quakers\\" after their unique way of speaking during their meetings for worship. Penn had converted to Quakerism and had been imprisoned several times for his beliefs. Charles II allowed Penn to establish a proprietary colony where Penn appointed the governor and judges but established an otherwise democratic system of government with freedom of religion, fair trials, elected representatives, and separation of church and state. From 1660 to 1680, several Quakers, including William Penn visited the United Provinces and the Rhine valley of what would later become Germany, and organized gatherings where they preached the Quaker testimony. Many people, including some who had been Mennonites in Krefeld and Kriegsheim (now part of the modern Mennonite congregation of Monsheim, Germany), in the German \\"Palatinate\\", converted to the new Quaker faith. Among them was Francis Daniel Pastorius, a young German born near W√ºrzburg to a family of elite officeholders. After training as an attorney, Pastorius sought spiritual release from his lucrative but uninspiring practice with the local gentry, and he turned inward looking for a philosophical purity in his life. He was attracted to Penn's colony as a place where religious freedom would allow him to start afresh a life free from \\"libertinism and sins of the European world.\\" Meanwhile, the Mennonites and Quakers in the Netherlands and along the Rhine valley were often fined or imprisoned for publicly practicing a faith other than the officially recognized Reformed Church, Catholicism and Lutheranism. In 1681, Penn invited immigrants from Europe to the new colony. He arrived in 1682, had the land surveyed, organized Philadelphia as a welcoming town laid out as a grid with many green spaces, and profited by selling lots. Soon, the waterfront was a bustle of activity, town streets were laid out with houses built on narrow lots, and churches of several different faiths were established. The town merchants traded with the largely Quaker colony of West Jersey. The town and surrounding countryside prospered. The German settlement In 1683 Pastorius was delegated authority to purchase land in the new Pennsylvania colony by a group of men from Frankfurt who intended to emigrate. He traveled to Philadelphia in August 1683, having purchased a warrant from Penn's agent on behalf of the Frankfurt men who had supplied the funds. In October, 1683, thirteen German-Dutch families from Krefeld in the Rhine valley arrived with their own land claim. Seizing upon a chance to create a viable German-speaking town, Pastorius negotiated with Penn to combine the two claims. As it turned out, the people from the Frankfurt Company never emigrated to the new colony, but more Quakers and Mennonites came from the Rhine valley and Pastorius's ambitious plan for a German- speaking town near Philadelphia grew and became real. Pastorius' original plan of Germantown in 1688. The town lay on a gentle hill between two creeks that could provide transportation and power. Location of Thones Kunders' house is marked with red dot. From Pennypacker (1899). Pastorius had devised a simple plan for a town, with lots parceled out along one long main thoroughfare, where settlers could build their houses. He required land good for tilling because the emigrants would need to grow their own food to survive. Pastorius and Penn became good friends, and they often discussed plans for the new settlement over dinner. The land originally promised to Pastorius was supposed to be level and along a navigable river, and Pastorius had paid for . However a suitable tract of land near Philadelphia was unavailable on the Delaware River, because level ground there was valuable and most of it had already been sold. Penn suggested land near the Schuylkill Falls (East Falls), but it was too steep for Pastorius's plan, so as an alternative Penn suggested land a little further east, near the top of a gentle hill between two creeks, and Pastorius agreed. Germantown was thus founded along a Lenni Lenape trail four miles (6 km) north of Philadelphia, between the Wissahickon and Wingohocking creeks. Pastorius had the land surveyed, and over the first winter the families lived in downtown Philadelphia while struggling to clear the land for their makeshift log houses. Germantown became a separate and self-sufficient town of Dutch and German speakers. The thirteen original Krefelder families were Mennonites who had become Quakers in their native Holland before they arrived in the new Pennsylvania colony. Because they had been persecuted in their own land on account of their beliefs they understood the value of a community founded on religious toleration. Unlike Pastorius, they were not wealthy, but were skilled craftsmen who knew they would have to work hard for a living. By trade they were carpenters, weavers, dyers, tailors, and shoemakers, so they were not fully prepared for the hard work of clearing the forest. Over the first year they cleared land and planted crops for food and flax for weaving. They set up looms and soon were producing linen cloth that sold widely throughout the colonies. Bas-relief portrait of Francis Daniel Pastorius, c. 1897. From the Library of Congress. The issue of slavery Some of the early settlers of Philadelphia and its surrounding towns were wealthy and purchased African slaves to work on their farms. Although many such slaveowners also had immigrated to escape religious persecution, they saw no contradiction in owning slaves. Although serfdom had already been abolished in northwestern Europe by 1500, servitude was still ubiquitous, and sometimes under harsh conditions. Many immigrants to the new colony were indentured servants, who had signed an agreement to work for several years in exchange for being transported via a passenger ship to the new colony. Slavery was widespread in the American colonies, and local slave markets ensured the ease of purchasing slaves to the general populace. The Atlantic slave trade was beginning to rapidly expand, and many settlers thought it necessary for economic growth in the colonies. Many slave ship owners and captains made large profits transporting slaves from Africa to the Caribbean and mainland North America. William Penn oversaw the economic progress of his colony and once proudly declared that during the course of a year Philadelphia had received ten slave ships. The first settlers of Germantown were soon joined by several more Quaker and Mennonite families from Krisheim, also in the Rhine valley, who were ethnic Germans but spoke a similar dialect to the Hollanders from Krefeld. Some out of pragmatism attended the local Quaker Meetings held in the newly built homes of immigrants, becoming involved and accepted in the Philadelphia Quaker community, and eventually joining as members. However, in several ways they felt themselves outsiders, which allowed them to question the social values in the nascent colony. Some attended the Quaker Meeting temporarily while they waited for a Mennonite minister to arrive, and then helped to build the first Mennonite Meetinghouse. The town prospered and grew, and a Quaker Meeting was organized at Thones Kunders's house, under the care of Dublin (Abington Meeting). By 1686 a Quaker Meetinghouse was constructed near the current site of Germantown Friends Meeting. Thones Kunders's house at 5109 Germantown Avenue, where the 1688 Petition Against Slavery was written. From Jenkins (1915). The German-Dutch settlers were unaccustomed to owning slaves, although from the shortage of labor they understood why slavery was required to ensure the economic prosperity of the colony. Slaves and indentured servants were a valuable asset for a farmer because they were not paid. Yet the German-Dutch settlers refused to buy slaves themselves and quickly saw the contradiction in the slave trade and in farmers who forced people to work. Although in their native Germany and Holland the Krefelders had been persecuted because of their beliefs, only people who had been convicted of a crime could be forced to work in servitude. In what turned out to be a revolutionary leap of insight, the Germantowners saw a fundamental similarity between the right to be free from persecution on account of their beliefs and the right to be free from being forced to work against their will. About the contents of the petition In 1688, five years after Germantown was founded, Pastorius and three other men petitioned the Dublin Quaker Meeting. The men gathered at Thones Kunders's house and wrote a petition based upon the Bible's Golden Rule, \\"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,\\" urging the Meeting to abolish slavery. It is an unconventional text in that it avoids the expected salutation to fellow Quakers and does not contain references to Jesus and God. It argues that every human, regardless of belief, color, or ethnicity, has rights that should not be violated. The table on which the 1688 Petition Against Slavery was written and signed. Throughout the petition the reference to the Golden Rule is used to argue against slavery and for universal human rights. On first reading, the argument presented in the petition seems indirect. Nowhere is the Meeting specifically asked to condemn the practice of slavery. Instead, in reference to the Golden Rule, the four men ask why Christians are allowed to buy and own slaves, almost in mock sarcasm, to get the slaveowners to see their point. In doing so, it arguably was very successful, but it would be easy to miss the sophistication of their argument. They emphatically argue that in their society the capture and sale of ordinary people as slaves, where husband, wife and children are separated, would not be tolerated, again referring to the Golden Rule. The four men also assert that according to the Golden Rule, the slaves would have the right to revolt, and that inviting more people to the new land would be difficult if prospective settlers saw the contradiction inherent in slavery. In mentioning the possibility of a slave revolt, they clearly were suggesting to that slavery would discourage potential settlers from emigrating to the American colonies. In the Caribbean colonies there had been many slave revolts over several decades, so the possibility was real. However, the power of the argument for potential settlers from Europe was more than the fear of a revolt‚Äîit was that any such revolt would be justifiable according to the Golden Rule. This logic strengthened the newly defined universal rights, which applied to all humans, not just the \\"civilized\\". The petition has several examples of such counter-intuitive but forceful arguments to push the slave- owning reader off his balance. The plan of Germantown in 1689. Location of Thones Kunders' house is marked with red dot. Lot owners shown for 1689 and 1714. The petition contains several points of difficulty for the reader unfamiliar with history. First, the petition's grammar seems unusual today but reflects the Krefelders' incomplete knowledge of English as well as typical pre-modern use of variable spelling. The original wording includes \\"ye.\\" which is a contraction of the word \\"the\\", and might be confused with the second person plural \\"ye\\" that was in wide use at the time. Second, the petition mentions Turks as an example of a people who might take someone on a ship into slavery in the Ottoman Empire. The four men were referring to the widely known stories of Barbary pirates who had established outposts on the coast of North Africa and for hundreds of years had plundered ships. After the Muslims were driven out of Spain in 1492 they raided the Spanish coast and the Spanish countered with more attacks. The Barbary pirates in the period (1518‚Äì1587) were allied with the Ottoman authorities and captured slaves to be brought back to North Africa or Turkey. Thus in their early period, their motivation was political. In the later period during the 17th century the North African pirate communities became more independent and lived mainly on plunder so the motivation for piracy was mainly economic. In that period up to 20,000 captured Christians were said to be kept as slaves in Algiers. The slave raiders traveled throughout the Mediterranean Sea and the North Atlantic, often taking slaves from Italy and Spain, but ranging as far north as Iceland (see Sack of Baltimore etc.). Among the Barbary pirates were renegades from Northern Europe who had converted to Islam. Some English, French, and Germans were allowed to pay their way out of slavery and so brought back the stories of marauding pirates capturing slaves. At the time that the Petition was written, a number of Friends were enslaved in Morocco, including the captain of the ship that had brought Pastorius and his compatriots to Pennsylvania. See Meggitt, Justin J. Early Quakers and Islam: Slavery, Apocalyptic and Christian-Muslim Encounters in the Seventeenth Century. Studies on Inter- Religious Relations 59. Uppsala: Swedish Science Press, 2013, p. 76. Available here The petition's mention of this point, then, is another example of their sophisticated reasoning. The widely circulated stories of slavery on the Barbary Coast were true, for Europeans had been the prey of political enemies and renegades who had captured them as slaves. Indeed, in the year that the petition was written, a number of Quakers were enslaved in Morocco.See Tuke, Samuel. 1848. Account of the Slavery of Friends in the Barbary States Towards the Close of the Seventeenth Century. London: Edward Marsh. This analogy in the first paragraph of the petition cast the Atlantic slave trade in a questionable light. The four authors expressed their belief that slaves had social and political equality with ordinary citizens. Third, the petition refers to the black slaves as \\"negers\\", which was a German and Dutch word meaning black or negro. In its 1688 usage the term was simply descriptive and not in any way derogatory. Throughout the petition the four men show respect for enslaved people and declare them equals. The effect of the document The four men presented their petition at the local Monthly Meeting at Dublin (Abington), but it is not clear what they expected to happen. Although they were accepted in the Quaker community, they were outsiders who could not speak or write fluently in English, and they also had a fresh view of slavery that was unique to Germantown. They must have understood from the beginning that it would be difficult to force the whole colony to abolish slavery, as it was generally believed that the colony's prosperity depended on slavery. It is not clear whether the four men expected the local Meeting to affirm their view, because they knew that nearby Meetings might not in be in agreement, and consequences would be far-reaching. The Meeting decided that although the issue was fundamental and just, it was too difficult and consequential for them to judge, and would need to be considered further. In the usual manner the Meeting sent the petition on to the Philadelphia Quarterly Meeting, where it was again considered and sent on to the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting (held in Burlington, NJ). Realizing that the abolition of slavery would have a wide and overreaching impact on the entire colony, none of the Meetings wanted to pass judgment on such a \\"weighty matter.\\" PYM minuted that they would send the petition to London Yearly Meeting, without mentioning whether they actually did so, and on this point no direct evidence has been discovered. The minutes of London Yearly Meeting do not mention the petition directly, apparently skirting the issue. The practice of slavery continued and was tolerated in Quaker society in the years immediately following the 1688 petition. Some of the authors continued to protest against slavery, but for a decade their efforts were rejected. Germantown continued to prosper, growing in population and economic strength, becoming widely known for the quality of its products such as paper and woven cloth. Eventually several of the original Krefelders rejoined the Mennonites and moved away from Germantown at least in part because of their insistence not to side with slave-owners. Several other petitions and protests were written by Quakers against slavery in the next several decades, but were based on racist or practical arguments of inferiority and intolerance. Some of the protests became entangled with politics and theology and as a result were dismissed by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, confusing the issue. Almost three decades passed before another Quaker petition against slavery was written with sophistication comparable to the Germantown 1688 petition. But the Germantowners' condemnation of slavery continued, and their moral leadership on the issue influenced Quaker abolitionists and Philadelphia society. Gradually over the next century, due to the efforts of many dedicated Quakers such as Benjamin Lay, John Woolman, and Anthony Benezet, Quakers became convinced of the essential wrongness of the institution of slavery. Many of the Quaker abolitionists published their articles anonymously in Benjamin Franklin's newspaper. In 1776 a proclamation was written by Philadelphia Yearly Meeting banning the owning of slaves.Williams, William H. \\"Slavery and Freedom in Delaware, 1639-1865\\", Rowman & Littlefield, 1999, . By that time, many Quaker monthly meetings in the Delaware Valley were attempting to help freed slaves by providing funds for them to start businesses and encouraging them to attend Quaker meetings and educate their children. The Arch Street Friends Meeting House, where the signed original of the Petition Against Slavery was re- discovered in 2005. Historical and social importance The 1688 petition was the first American document of its kind that made a plea for equal human rights for everyone.Gross, Leonard and Gleysteen, Jan, \\"Colonial Germantown Mennonites\\", Telford, PA: Cascadia, 2007, . It compelled a higher standard of reasoning about fairness and equality that continued to grow in Pennsylvania and the other colonies with the Declaration of Independence and the abolitionist and suffrage movements, eventually giving rise to Lincoln's reference to human rights in the Gettysburg Address. The 1688 petition was set aside and forgotten until 1844 when it was re-discovered and became a focus of the burgeoning abolitionist movement in the United States. After a century of public exposure, it was misplaced and once more re-discovered in March 2005 in the vault at Arch Street Meetinghouse. It was discovered in deteriorating condition, with tears at the edges, paper tape covering voids and handwriting where the petition had originally been folded, and its oak gall ink slowly fading into gray. To preserve the document for future generations, it was treated at the Conservation Center for Art and Historic Artifacts (CCAHA) in downtown Philadelphia. CCAHA conservator Morgan Zinsmeister removed previous repairs and reduced centuries of old and discolored adhesives with various poultices and enzymatic solutions. Acidity and discoloration in the paper were reduced through aqueous treatment. Repairs were made with acrylic-toned Japanese papers that were carefully applied to bridge the voids. Finally, the petition was photographed at high resolution and then encapsulated along its edges(not laminated) between sheets of inert polyester film. The petition was shown at an exhibit of original rare American documents at the National Constitution Center on Independence Mall in the summer of 2007. It currently resides at Haverford College Quaker and Special Collections, the joint repository (with Friends Historical Library of Swarthmore College) for the records of Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. Today the 1688 petition is for many a powerful reminder about the basis for freedom and equality for all. In a world where slavery continues in many forms, the 1688 petition seems relevant to many people because of its statement on the nature of human suffering and institutions that conspire to continue injustice based on power and tradition. In many countries today people have been reported to be duped into being taken to foreign lands where they are held under difficult conditions and forced to work with meager pay. The power of economic progress has in some cases created conditions where those with less education and resources are convinced to travel from familiar surroundings and feel threatened not to complain for fear of losing their work. Ethnic minorities and women of many third-world countries are especially vulnerable. Societies that are sometimes called \\"advanced\\" are to some extent dependent on cheap labor and resources taken from those less fortunate. Some believe that our worldwide environmental crisis has been created by our willingness to ignore the pleas and lost lives of people who would work hard for equal pay and privilege. The expectation of equal rights for everyone is a powerful motivator that may help to give economic progress and environmental responsibility worldwide.

Gold, silver, and bronze medals, along with cash awards, are awarded to winners in each of 29 categories of competition in the sciences, humanities, business, performing and visual arts, and local and national entrepreneurship/ culinary competitions. Active in nearly 400 cities, ACT-SO is the largest academic promotion for black youths in America. History ACT-SO was founded in 1978 by author and journalist Vernon Jarrett (1918-2004). The program was intended to give recognition to young people who could demonstrate academic, scientific, and artistic achievement, allowing young people to gain recognition equal to that often achieved by entertainers and athletes. The first national ACT-SO competition was held in 1978 in Portland, Oregon. Since its inception, almost 300,000 young people have participated in the program, and more than 700 gold medals have been awarded to youths around the United States. Over $350,000 has been granted in monetary awards, scholarships, and laptop computers.  Historical timeline  1976: Vernon Jarrett presented his concept for ACT-SO, an \\"Olympics of the Mind\\", to the DuSable Museum of African American History in Chicago. It was later decided that the program would better serve youth nationally rather than just in the Chicago area. 1977: Jarrett approached NAACP Executive Director Dr. Benjamin Hooks, who was responsive to the idea of ACT-SO and approached the NAACP National Board of Directors. The board adopted a resolution to accept ACT-SO as an officially sponsored NAACP youth achievement program. Local NAACP branches would be called upon to sponsor ACT-SO, conduct local competitions annually, and then take local gold medalists to an annual national ACT-SO competition. 1978: The first National ACT-SO competition was held in Portland, Oregon with seven cities participating: Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Orleans, and St. Louis. 1980: Barbara Coggins, one of Vernon Jarrett's colleagues, was hired as the first National ACT-SO Director and designed a structural framework for establishing and running ACT-SO programs across the country. 1991: The NAACP Board of Directors created its own ACT-SO committee. 2004: Jarrett died of cancer at the age of 82. Today, ACT-SO sustains approximately 200 programs nationally. Over the past 30 years, over 200,000 black high school students have participated in the program at local and national levels. Mission For over thirty years the mission of ACT-SO has been to prepare, recognize and reward youth of African descent who exemplify scholastic and artistic excellence. Original goals (1977): *To encourage and recognize academic achievement of African American students. *To promote excellence and highlight academic achievement as well as support the accomplishments of these students. *To encourage communities to become involved in working as partners in the quest for scholastic achievement by serving as mentors, fundraisers, sponsors, and organizers. According to the NAACP, the program‚Äôs goals are: *To mobilize the adult community for the promotion of classroom and after-school excellence *To recognize academic achievement among youth on par with the recognition awarded athletics *To provide and assist students with the necessary skills and tools to establish goals and acquire the confidence and training to make a successful contribution to society Participation Eligibility Annual academic competitions are conducted for students of African descent who are U.S. citizens enrolled in grades 9‚Äì12 and are amateurs in the categories of competition. Winners of the competition at each local branch are eligible for awards at the finals during the NAACP national convention, which occurs every July. The 2015 national competition was in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Competition Categories Students can select up to 3 categories to compete in from a total of 29 offerings: *STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math): Architecture Biology/Microbiology Chemistry/Biochemistry Computer Science Earth and Space Sciences Engineering Mathematics Medicine and Health Physics *HUMANITIES: Music Composition Original Essay Playwriting Poetry (Written) Short Story *THE PERFORMING ARTS: Dance Dramatics Music Instrumental (Classical) Music Instrumental (Contemporary) Music Vocal (Classical) Music Vocal (Contemporary) Oratory Poetry (Performance) *THE VISUAL ARTS: Drawing Filmmaking Painting Photography Sculpture *BUSINESS: Entrepreneurship *CULINARY: Culinary Arts Awards Gold, silver, and bronze medals, along with cash awards, are awarded to winners in each of 29 categories of competition.
