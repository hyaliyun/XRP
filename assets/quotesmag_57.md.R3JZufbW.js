The land now comprises Bangladesh was known as Bengal during the British and Mughal regime while by some other names earlier.Though we had religious and political equipments and institutions from almost pre historic era, Mughals first tried to recognise and establish them through state mechanisms. The Charter of 1726, granted by King George 1, authorised the East India Company to establish Mayor's Courts in Madras, Bombay and Calcutta and is recognised as the first codified law for the British India. As a part of the then British India, it was the first codified law for the then Bengal too. Since independence in 1971, statutory law enacted by the Parliament of Bangladesh has been the primary form of legislation. Judge made law continues to be significant in areas such as constitutional law. Unlike in other common law countries, the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has the power to not only interpret laws made by the parliament, but to also declare them null and void and to enforce fundamental rights of the citizens. The Bangladesh Code includes a compilation of all laws since 1836. The vast majority of Bangladeshi laws are in English. But most laws adopted after 1987 are in Bengali. Family law is intertwined with religious law. Bangladesh has significant international law obligations. During periods of martial law in the 1970s and 1980s, proclamations and ordinances were issued as laws. In 2010, the Supreme Court declared that martial law was illegal, which led to a re-enactment of some laws by parliament. A Right to Information Act has been enacted. Several of Bangladesh's laws are controversial, archaic or in violation of the country's own constitution. They include the country's special powers act, blasphemy law, sedition law, internet regulation law, NGO law, media regulation law, military justice and aspects of its property law. Many colonial laws require modernization. According to the World Justice Project, Bangladesh ranked 103rd out of 113 countries in an index of the rule of law in 2016.https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/RoLI_Final- Digital_0.pdf Fundamental rights in Bangladesh Part III of the Constitution of Bangladesh includes the articles of fundamental rights. # Laws inconsistent with fundamental rights to be void (Article-26) # Equality before law (Article-27) # Discrimination on grounds of religion, etc. (Article-28) # Equality of opportunity in public employment (Article-29) # Prohibition of foreign titles, etc. (Article-30) # Right to protection of law (Article-31) # Protection of right to life and personal liberty (Article-32) # Safeguards as to arrest and detention (Article-33) # Prohibition of forced labour (Article-34) # Protection in respect of trial and punishment (Article-35) # Freedom of movement (Article-36) # Freedom of assembly (Article-37) # Freedom of association (Article-38) # Freedom of thought and conscience, and of speech (Article-39) # Freedom of profession or occupation (Article-40) # Freedom of religion (Article-41) # Rights of property (Article-42) # Protection of home and correspondence (Article-43) # Enforcement of fundamental rights (Article-44) # Modification of rights in respect of disciplinary law (Article-45) # Power to provide indemnity (Article-46) # Saving for certain laws (Article-47) # Inapplicability of certain articles (Article-47A) Case law Judicial precedent is enshrined under Article 111 of the Constitution of Bangladesh. Bangladeshi courts have provided vital judicial precedent in areas like constitutional law, such as in Bangladesh Italian Marble Works Ltd. v. Government of Bangladesh, which declared martial law illegal. The judgement of Secretary, Ministry of Finance v Masdar Hossain asserted the separation of powers and judicial independence. In Aruna Sen v. Government of Bangladesh, the Supreme Court set a precedent against unlawful detention and torture. The court affirmed the principle of natural justice in the judgement of Abdul Latif Mirza v. Government of Bangladesh. The two verdicts were precedents for invalidating most detentions under the Special Powers Act, 1974. The doctrine of legitimate expectation in Bangladeshi law has developed through judicial precedent. Codification and language The Bangladesh Code has been published since 1977. Most of its laws, dating between 1836 and 1987, are in English. Following a government circular in 1987, the code has been published primarily in Bengali. The language of the Supreme Court and High Court is English. However, most magistrates courts and district courts use Bengali. The lack of a uniform language has been a cause of concern, with arguments in favor of both English and Bengali. The country's financial sector depends on English, whereas cultural nationalists prefer Bengali. Freedom of information The Right to Information Act 2009 passed by the Jatiyo Sangshad was hailed as a major reform. The law allows information requests to most government departments, except the military. Hence, security agreements with foreign countries are not under its purview. As of 2016, 76,043 requests have been made to the Chief Information Commissioner by citizens and organizations. Criminal law The main criminal laws are The Penal Code, 1860, the Code of Criminal Procedure, The Cattle Trespass Act 1871, The Explosive Substances Act 1908, The Prevention of Corruption Act 1947, The Anti-Corruption Act 1957, The Special Powers Act 1974, The Dowry Prohibition Act 1980, The Narcotics (Control) Act 1990, The Women and Children Oppression Act 1995 and The Anti- Terrorism Act 2013.http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2013/06/11/new-anti-terror- law-passed Company law Bangladesh's company law has its roots in the Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It was later influenced by the Companies Act 1857, Companies Act 1913 and Companies Act 1929. The Securities and Exchange Ordinance, 1969 was the most important piece of legislation incorporating corporate activities during the Pakistan period. After the independence of Bangladesh, post partition Indian company law served as a model for reforms. The Company Law Reforms Committee was set up in 1979 with leading civil servants, chartered accountants and lawyers. The committee's recommendations were not implemented until 1994, when the Companies Act (Bangladesh) 1994 was passed by the Jatiyo Sangshad. The Securities and Exchange Commission Act of 1993 created the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the country's two stock markets. Contract law Bangladeshi contract law is based on the Contract Act 1872 and the Sale of Goods Act 1930. According to the World Bank's 2016 Ease of Doing Business Index, Bangladesh ranks 189th in enforcing contracts. Religious law Islamic law applies to Bangladeshi Muslims in family law and inheritance laws. Hindu personal law applies to Bangladeshi Hindus in family law. Bangladeshi Buddhists also follow Hindu personal law. The Christian Marriage Act, 1872 applies to Bangladeshi Christians. Tax law The Customs Act 1969 is the basis of customs law.http://nbr.gov.bd/uploads/acts/7.pdf The Income Tax Rules were promulgated by ordinance in 1984. Value Added Tax was revised with the Value Added Tax (VAT) and Supplementary Duty (SD) Act 2012.http://nbr.gov.bd/uploads/acts/18.pdf The Municipal Taxation Act 1881 governs municipal taxes. Labour law The Bangladesh Labour Act 2006 was amended with the Bangladesh Labour (Amendment) Bill, 2013 to improve worker rights, including greater but limited freedom to form trade unions, and improving occupational health and safety condition in factories. In 2017, the government pledged to remove the ban on trade unions in export processing zones. Property law The constitution guarantees the right to private property. The Transfer of Property Act, 1882 is the basic property law. However, some government agencies like RAJUK restrict property transfers in urban areas through foreign direct investment. The Vested Property Act allows the government to confiscate property from entities or individuals deemed as enemies of the state. Intellectual property law The Patent and Designs Act 1911 is the country's oldest copyright law.https://www.dhakachamber.com/economic_policy/Copyright_Laws-Final.pdf The Patent and Design Rules were introduced in 1933. The Copyright Act 2000, Copyright Rules 2006 and Trademarks Act 2009 are the other main laws. Judiciary The general hierarchy includes both civil and criminal courts. At the top hierarchy is the Supreme Court of Bangladesh. Judicial review Judicial review in Bangladesh is performed by a system of writ petitions to the High Court Division under Article 102 of the constitution. Alternative dispute resolution The Bangladesh International Arbitration Center is the sole court of commercial arbitration in the country. It is the country's first center for alternative dispute resolution. Legal profession A Bangladeshi lawyer is termed an advocate when he or she enters the Bar. Law students can train abroad, including as barristers in the United Kingdom; as well as in other countries; and return to enroll as advocates in the Bangladeshi bar. The Bangladesh Bar Council and the Bangladesh Supreme Court Bar Association are the leading lawyers' societies in the country. Many of Asia's leading lawyers. such as former Amnesty International chief Irene Khan, have been Bangladeshi.

Free parking is available at the station, which has one platform on the west side of a single track. History The former station in 1974 When construction of the San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad (SF&SJ;) had reached the future townsite, a small, open-air, two story station was constructed. It cost $4,500 and followed their standard No. 2 design. There was also a large window, facing the tracks, for the station master to observe activity down the tracks. The town, named Dewey, would develop around the station. It would later be renamed Wasco. In 1899, the SF&SJ; was purchased by the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe which continued to use the station for passenger and freight service. In 1907, the station was extended, to serve a growing demand for freight. In the 1950s, the waiting room was enclosed. The second floor was also reorganized as sleeping quarters. The station closed in 1971, when Amtrak was formed and none of the routes in the San Joaquin Valley continued to run. In 1974, the San Joaquin route began operating through the valley. Initially, the train did not stop in Wasco. The next year, it became a flag stop. The train station was demolished in 1978 and replaced with a couple of benches and a parking lot. Part of the train station would be used in the restoration of the Shafter Santa Fe Station. At some point, Wasco became a regular stop for the San Joaquin route, and a shelter was built. In 2006, an entirely new station was constructed. It was designed as an open-air station, built in the Spanish Revival style. It would also house the Wasco Chamber of Commerce. With the coming of high speed rail project, Wasco city officials have expressed concerns that the Amtrak service might be discontinued. , no decision has been announced. As of 2020, the station is gated and boarded up.

He was re-commissioned on 17 August 1940. From the beginning of the Blitz and during the heavy raids of 1940/41, Major Martin carried out bomb disposal work and dealt with a high number of unexploded bombs during this period. He continued with this work through to 1943. George Cross Following a Luftwaffe air raid on the night of 17-18 January 1943, a large bomb fell into the warehouse belonging to the Victoria Haulage Company in Battersea. The warehouse contained heavy machinery from the United States. Due to the importance of the machinery this bomb was a high priority for disposal. The bomb contained a new, unrecognised type of fuse, which contained both an anti-handling device and booby trap. No existing disarming techniques or equipment could deal with the fuse mechanism. A decision was made to remove the bomb's base plate and extract the explosive filling ‚Äì Martin was called to carry out this task. After removing the base plate, Martin found that the explosive content was of the solid cast TNT type, which would require steaming at high pressure. The normal process for steaming, by remote control was deemed too risky. For this task the steam nozzle was directly applied by hand and used a low level amount of steam, enough to just soften the TNT fill, so it was pliable enough for it to be scooped out. Martin was assisted by another Lt R.W. Deans managed to steam out the explosive over the course of nearly 18 hours (from afternoon on 20 January afternoon till 08.30 the next day) through a small hole bored into the bomb through which water and steam could be introduced.

The framework includes the Epesi CRM (customer relationship management) multiuser application. It requires PHP 5.x and MySQL or PostgreSQL database server on the server side and can be accessed using any modern browser. Epesi framework and Epesi CRM application are released under MIT license.  History  Between 1995 and 2006, Teknaspan Corporation, a small IT consulting company run by Janusz Tylek, was providing computer-related services in the Greater Philadelphia metropolitan area. Many of its customers - mostly small, local companies - were looking to share easily information especially in remote offices. Setup based on Microsoft's Exchange Server, Outlook and Sharepoint was too expensive and difficult to set up and manage and did not meet with a good response. In the same time period, Internet connection became a norm and mature, free and open source software like Apache, MySQL and PHP became available. Teknaspan started offering open source solutions to its customers, among them SugarCRM. This application was difficult to set up, upgrade and most of all - difficult to extend its functionality. After experimenting with a number of other solutions like dotproject, mantis, and many other open source solutions, it became clear that there is a need for a modern framework with a set of reusable components upon which an application can be developed. At the beginning of 2006, Teknaspan Corporation was acquired by another IT consulting company. Janusz Tylek left Teknaspan and formed Telaxus LLC, a small software startup company focusing on development of web-based applications. The framework using latest standards like AJAX, HTML5 and CSS3 was born. The original requirements were: * 100% web based (no client installation needed) * run on any web server (Apache, IIS, Windows, Linux - LAMP/WAMP stack) * use the most popular web scripting language supported - PHP * provide a database abstraction layer - AdoDB, which has drivers for MySQL, PostgreSQL and many others * include authentication and permission library - phpGACL * have a set of reusable components (modules) * use of other open source application (for example Roundcube as e-mail client) In the summer of 2006, the work on the framework started after a meeting of Tylek (jasiek) and Pawel Bukowski (shacky), who designed the first set of modules. By the end of 2006, the first commercial application was released - a warehouse management system. In May 2007, the core of Epesi framework was released as open source software and published on SourceForge. It included Record Browser - CRUD engine, designed by Arkadiusz Bisaga (ethnar), which is a high-level database abstraction layer, handling not only Create/Read/Update/Delete operations, but also automatic pagination, lazy delete, full record history, sorting, filtering and more. During the next twelve months, the application was expanded with customer relationship management (CRM) functionality and this package is now available as EPESI, an alternative to products like SugarCRM or vtiger. From November, 2012 Epesi can be installed with Softaculous Autoinstaller epesi Softaculous Autoinstaller In August 2013 EPESI was added to Enterprise-Ready Open Source Projects on SourceForge Sourceforge Enterprise Directory - CRM and ranks as one of the top CRM and ERP applications with 5 star rating.

The framework allows development of new modules, especially when utilizing Record Browser - a module that automatically generates views, limits queries, stores historical data, etc. The dashboard approach allows every user customize his or her workspace using applets - mini view of data stored in the module. For example, an applet may show only phone calls to be returned today. A distinct feature is the Watchdog utility, which allows a user to subscribe to a record (or category of records) and have the system monitor it for you. This way a user receives a notification (Subscriptions applet) when a record was changed by another user - a meeting was canceled, a phone number or an address was updated, a project status changed from Completed to Billed or even when a note was attached to a record. Every record can have an unlimited number of notes or attachments in any possible format. EPESI incorporates Roundcube IMAP e-mail client and provides single instance message archiving. When a user receives an e-mail it can be archived into epesi system. An e-mail message is extracted from e-mail client and stored in the database in e-mails table. Attachments are stored as files with reference links. Then a link to this e-mail (or e-mail with attachments) is created under history of two contacts: a sender and a recipient. This way the e-mail becomes a public note for all users to see. This reduces e-mail traffic - instead of forwarding coworkers an e-mail with attachment resulting in wasted space a single instance of this e-mail is sufficient. Additionally, reference links can be created in as many modules as needed (for example, a meeting or a task can have reference links to this e-mail).  Versions  EPESI is available as open source application and distributed free of charge. The base version includes the Epesi framework and set of modules providing CRM functionality: * Dashboard * Shared addressbook (Companies and Contacts) * Shared calendar * Task list (To Do) * Phone Call tracker * Project tracker with Bugtracker * Sales Tracking * Integrated e-mail client (Roundcube) The functionality of Epesi can be extended with Custom modules (created by end- users for example) or by installing additional Premium modules. Most Premium modules are commercial and require a license fee.

It was founded in the early 2000s as a studio experiment, which culminated into the successful album Bajofondo Tango Club. This led to touring and eventually to the current lineup. Bajofondo calls itself a collaborative as all members have solo careers as well. The group has toured around the world, particularly in Latin America, the United States, Europe and parts of Asia. Their music is known to a wider audience than those who know their name as their music has been used in film and television. Concept The name alludes to the river that separates Argentina and Uruguay politically but unites the area as a region, called Rio de la Plata. The music has been called ‚Äúelectrotango‚Äù or ‚Äúelectronic tango‚Äù but leader Gustavo Santaolalla does not believe that it sufficiently describes the group's sound, stating there is more than that. Tango is an influence but it not the band's style. The Argentine-Uruguayan influence is more than just tango, and includes murga, milonga and candombe. The idea of the group is to take these traditional styles and create something more contemporary, with elements from rock, hip hop, jazz and electronic music, especially sampling. Bajofondo calls itself a collective, rather than a band, where members work on both projects under the Bajofondo name and on individual projects, often in collaboration with one or more other members. There are eight members, seven musicians and one VJ, who gives a theatrical aspect to live performances, by adding digital images in real time to the music. Each member has their own solo career, and lives in different places. Two of its members, drummer Adrian Nicolas Sosa and producer-composer Gustavo Santaolalla, live in Los Angeles. Four more are in Uruguay, and two are in Argentina. In addition, on most albums, the group has collaborated with other artists including Elvis Costello, Nelly Furtado, Julieta Venegas, La Mala Rodriguez, and Gustavo Cerati. History The idea for the group was that of Gustavo Santaolalla in the early 2000s, with the idea of experimenting with the acoustic instrumentation of tango music, with electronic beats and other influences in order to create a more contemporary music of the R√≠o de la Plata region. Santaolalla had already been work with Juan Campod√≥nico on other projects and together they began experimenting in the studio, trying out different sounds, sampling and playing instruments themselves along with participation from friends. After two years of work, the first album, self- titled Bajofondo Tango Club was released in 2002. The album introduced their new style along with the participations of guest artists such as Jorge Drexler, Adriana Varela, Crist√≥bal Repetto, Adri√°n Iaies, Didi Gutman, and Pablo Mainetti. The album reached triple platinum and won Argentina's Gardel Prize and a Latin Grammy (Best Instrumental Pop Album) . The popularity of this album encouraged the formation of most of the permanent group and touring. In their first shows, about seventy percent was pre-programmed with thirty percent live. Today only ten percent of what is heard is pre-recorded. Since then, six other albums have been made, either with the entire collective or with individuals with collective support, such as Luciano Supervielle's solo album in 2004, produced by Santaolalla and Campod√≥nico. This was followed by Bajofondo Remixed in 2005, with reworked versions of songs from Bajofondo Tango Club and Supervielle's album. In 2008, the album Mar Dulce was released and the name of the group shorted to just Bajofondo, as the idea was not just tango music as the base but all styles of Rio de la Plata regional music, such as milonga and candombe. In 2013, the Presente album has no guest vocals and strings play a more major role with eleven violins, four violas, three cellos and three stand-up basses. This album won the Latin Grammy for best instrumental album. They have toured around the world particularly in Latin America, the United States, Europe and parts of Asia. Venues include music festival including Coachella in the United States, Womad in England, Festival Internacional Cervantino in Mexico, Cactus Festival in Belgium, Pirineos Sur Festival in Spain, Pohoda in Slovakia, World Music Festival in South Korea, Summer State in New York City and Glastonbury. Other major venues and appearances include the 2010 appearance at the Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles with the Orchestra of the Americas, the University of California Los Angeles, the Lincoln Center in New York, the Barbicon Center and Roundhouse in London and in 2009 they were part of the opening of Argentina's bicentennial festivities. Their music is more widely known to the public then the members individually and even the group in total. One reason for this is that their music appears often in television and film than on radio, because it adapts to the first two mediums better. The song Pa‚Äô bailar was used as the theme for the Brazilian soap A Favorita (TV Globo), and the same song for an Acura commercial for the Super Bowl. Other examples include commercials for Kahlua, Macy's and Shell. Warner Cable used Pa‚Äô bailar for a trailer for the series Nikita in 2011 and the Russian gymnastics team used several of their works for the 2012 Olympic Games. Members Bajofondo current lineup has eight artists. Gustavo Santaolalla, cofounder of Bajofondo, is a singer, composer, producer and plays guitar, charange and ronroco and lives in Los Angeles. He also is the director of a record label and publishing company. His career began at age 16 with the band Arco Iris, a pioneer in fusing Latin American folk music and rock. He played with Soluna and then with Wet Picnic after he moved to the United States. His solo career includes three albums. He has been a producer since the 1970s, working with Leon Gieco, G.I.T. and Divididos, along with Maldita Vecindad and Caf√© Tacuba. In 1997 he cofounded the record label SURCO, whose first release was Mexican band Molotov, along with Bersuit, La Vela Puerca, Julieta Venega and more. Santaolalla has also composed soundtracks for films such as The Insider, Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Brokeback Mountain and Babel. This work has earned him a BAFTA, a Golden Globe and two Oscars. He has also won fourteen Grammys of various types. Juan Campod√≥nico is the other cofounder of Bajofondo and does programming, beats, samples and guitar. Campod√≥nico is from Uruguay but grew up in Mexico after his parents were exiled, returning in 1984. Soon after he was a member of several rock and pop bands and has been a pioneer of electronic music. In the mid 1990s he formed the band Peyote Asesino, the first Uruguayan band to fuse hip-hop with contemporary rock. This work attracted the attention of Santaolalla, producing the band's second album and giving them international exposure. The band broke up soon after but Campod√≥nico continued to work with Santasolalla, eventually creating Bajofondo, which continuing with his own projects and working as a DJ under the name of Campo. Luciano Supervielle does piano, keyboards and scratch. Born in France, Supervielle developed his music career in Uruguay, synthesizing hip hop, tango, rock and Uruguayan folk in a way that takes advantage of his abilities on keyboards and turntables. He began his career with the hip-hop group Pl√°tano Macho then began working with Jorge Drexler, participating in four albums and a DVD. He is the youngest member of Bajofondo and has released two solo projects while a member. Javier Casalla is a violinist who has played with various ensembles in rock, tango, folk, jazzo and classical. In addition to Bajofondo, he collaborates with the bands of Cristobal Repetto and Lucianco Supervielle. He released a solo album in 2006(produced by Santaolalla) and participated in the production of soundtracks for various films. Martin Ferres is a bandoneon player who plays both traditional and avant garde music and his work is influenced by minimalism as well as tango classics. In addition to Bajofondo, he composes music for theater and dance, and has been heard in many of Argentina's main theaters. Gabriel Casacuberta plays upright bass and electric back, beginning his career as a session musician in Mexico but working with many Uruguayan artists. After returning to his home country, he played in a number of bands, including Pl√°tano Maco with Supervielle. He has also produced music for movies and television. Adrian Nicolas Sosa is a drummer, producer and composer, who was involved with Bajofondo since day one as a producer and A&R; when he was the general manager at Surco Records. He joined the band as a musician after they had already produced one album that used drum machine called \\"Tango Club\\". For the Mar Dulce album, Santaolalla decided to try live drums as an experiment and asked Sosa to sit in. The success of this led to Sosa's becoming a permanent member. At present Sosa also writes, produced and he also sang in one of his compositions called \\"Cuesta Arriba\\" featured in the last Bajofondo album \\"Presente\\" (2013). Veronica Loza is a VJ who connects the band's music with stage presence, generally through digital images. On stage, she appears at a keyboard like a musician but her production is visual. She also provides vocals.

He became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1809, and was afterwards in practice at Helston in Cornwall for the long period of sixty-nine years. A considerable portion of his practice consisted in attending the men accidentally injured in the tin and copper mines of his neighbourhood, and his attention was thus led to mining. From 1841 to 1879 he kept meteorological records for the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society. He died at Cross Street, Helston, on 7 August 1880, leaving a large family. Writings In 1814 he sent to Thomas Thomson's Annals of Philosophy \\"Queries respecting the flow of Water in Chacewater Mine\\"; in the following years he communicated papers on \\"The Temperature of Mines\\", \\"On Granite Veins\\", and \\"On the Atmosphere of Cornish Mines\\". In 1822 he read a paper on the raised temperatures in mines to the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall. During a series of years he kept registers and made extensive and valuable observations on barometers and thermometers, and in conjunction with Robert Were Fox he wrote and communicated to Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Magazine in 1823, \\"An Account of the Observations and Experiments on the Temperature of Mines which have recently been made in Cornwall and the North of England\\".

It is commonly targeted at LCD and similar display technologies. It defines a serial bus and a communication protocol between the host, the source of the image data, and the device which is the destination.  Design  At the physical layer, DSI specifies a high-speed differential signaling point-to-point serial bus. This bus includes one high speed clock lane and one or more data lanes. Each lane is carried on two wires (due to differential signaling). All lanes travel from the DSI host to the DSI device, except for the first data lane (lane 0), which is capable of a bus turnaround (BTA) operation that allows it to reverse transmission direction. When more than one lane is used, they are used in parallel to transmit data, with each sequential bit in the stream traveling on the next lane. That is, if 4 lanes are being used, 4 bits are transmitted simultaneously, one on each lane. The link operates in either low power (LP) mode or high speed (HS) mode. In low power mode, the high speed clock is disabled and signal clocking information is embedded in the data. In this mode, the data rate is insufficient to drive a display, but is usable for sending configuration information and commands. High speed mode enables the high speed clock (at frequencies from tens of megahertz to over one gigahertz) that acts as the bit clock for the data lanes. Clock speeds vary by the requirements of the display. High speed mode is still designed to reduce power usage due to its low voltage signaling and parallel transfer ability. The communication protocol describes two sets of instructions. The Display Command Set (DCS) is a set of common commands for controlling the display device, and their format is specified by the DSI standard. It defines registers that can be addressed and what their operation is. It includes basic commands such as sleep, enable, and invert display. The Manufacturer Command Set (MCS) is a device-specific command space whose definition is up to the device manufacturer. It often includes commands required to program non-volatile memory, set specific device registers (such as gamma correction), or perform other actions not described in the DSI standard. The packet format of both sets is specified by the DSI standard. There are Short and Long Packets, Short Packet is 4 bytes long; Long Packet can be of any length up to 216 bytes. Packets are composed of a DataID, Word count, Error Correction Code (ECC), Payload and Checksum (CRC). Commands that require reading data back from the device trigger a BTA event, which allows the device to reply with the requested data. A device cannot initiate a transfer; it can only reply to host requests. Image data on the bus is interleaved with signals for horizontal and vertical blanking intervals (porches). The data is drawn to the display in real time and not stored by the device. This allows the manufacture of simpler display devices without frame buffer memory. However, it also means that the device must be continuously refreshed (at a rate such as 30 or 60 frames per second) or it will lose the image. Image data is only sent in HS mode. When in HS mode, commands are transmitted during the vertical blanking interval.

He was the son of Herman V and Irmengard, Countess Palatine of the Rhine. She was the daughter of Henry V, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Rudolf inherited Baden, together with his brother Herman VI, until Herman VI married into the Austrian ducal family. Rudolf I then became the sole ruler of Baden-Baden. Rudolf I married Kunigunde of Eberstein in 1257. The Eberstein family were in a position to raise money for Rudolf, and they bequeathed half their castle to the margrave. In 1283, Otto II of Eberstein sold the other half of Old Eberstein Castle to Rudolf I. In the 14th century, the castle was the place of residence for the Margraves of Baden. In 1250 Rudolf I began the construction of Hohenbaden Castle. On 23 August 1258 King Richard of Cornwall gave the city of Steinbach its charter. Rudolf I had asked the king to do this. The Lords of Weissenstein bought their castle Liebeneck and the village of W√ºrm from the margrave. Rudolf I quarreled with the Counts of W√ºrttemberg and the Bishops of Stra√üburg over the tolls on the Rhine. The quarrel with W√ºrttemberg ended in later years because of the marriage of one of Rudolf's sons into the W√ºrttemberg dynasty. Rudolf I built many churches and abbeys.

One of his illuminated books, presented by him to Elizabeth, is in the Bodleian Library, and Walpole gives a list of other works, formerly in the King's Library, and now, most of them, in the British Museum. He was also an author and dedicated his Description of Scotland and the Islands to Sir Christopher Hatton. Life He was born in Tuscany, about 1524. Ubaldini was first a soldier. He came to England in 1545, entered the service of the crown, and was employed on the continent in some capacity which took him back to Italy. He returned to England in the reign of Edward VI, and saw service in the Scottish war under James Croft, governor of Haddington. He fought for England against the Scots at Siege of Haddington in 1548 during the war of the Rough Wooing. By coincidence, there was another Ubaldini; Migliorino, in Scotland fighting for the other side.Merriman, Marcus, The Rough Wooing, Tuckwell, (2000), 370. Ubaldini then spent time in Venice, and it was not until ten years later that he settled in England, where he found a patron in Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, who presented him at court. He taught Italian, transcribed and illuminated manuscripts, rhymed, and wrote or translated into Italian historical and other tracts. In 1578‚Äì9, though in receipt of a pension, he was saved from arrest for debt only by the intervention of the privy council. Ubaldini compiled an account (now lost) of the repulse of the Spanish-Italian invasion of County Kerry in 1580 (see Siege of Smerwick). He rendered into Italian in 1588 the narrative of the defeat of the Spanish Armada compiled for Lord Howard of Effingham, Commentario del successo dell' Armata Spagnola nell' assalir l'Inghilterra l'anno 1588. A free translation, as A Discourse concerning the Spanish Fleet, was made by Augustine Ryther.

Origins Revolutionary Integrationism has its origins in the fight against slavery by Frederick Douglass and other abolitionists before the Civil War, and in the \\"New Negro\\" movement in the 1900s-1910s around the Crisis journal's 1919 articles by NAACP field marshal Walter White and other of his writings, Carrie Clifford, Alfred Kreymborg, and especially, the black Communist poet Claude McKay, Max Eastman's and Crystal Eastman's Liberator, as well as A. Philip Randolph's and Chandler Owen's Messenger. In the 1930s through 1960s, the RI doctrine was developed in the main by Trotskyists-Max Shachtman, Oliver Cox, Daniel Gu√©rin, Richard S. Fraser, James Robertson, as well as by non-Trotskyists such as James Baldwin. These activists argued that the struggle for equality by blacks in the United States was the main current in black history, and that equality could only be accomplished via a socialist revolution by the entire working class. They disagreed with the opinion of socialist thinkers like Leon Trotsky and C. L. R. James in the 1930s, and with George Breitman and the majority of the Socialist Workers Party (US) in the late 1950s. Such thinkers argued that Black nationalism was a transitional demand toward socialism. They also disagreed with Joseph Stalin and his followers in the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), who initiated this adaptation to black nationalism within the U.S. Marxist movement. Revolutionary integrationism disputes the assertion of these thinkers, and other leftists and liberals, that blacks in America potentially constitute a \\"nation\\", that blacks require separate organizations from whites, and that such organizations might constitute a separate or autonomous second \\"vanguard\\", which would cooperate, but not be integrated into, a \\"white\\" Marxist American vanguard party. Revolutionary Integrationists argue that equality rather than national liberation should be advocated by revolutionary socialists, that this equality can be accomplished through a class struggle of black and white workers and that such a revolution can be led by members of both races. It was most strongly opposed during the 1960s to the ideas of Malcolm X, the Black Panther Party and other Black Nationalist organizations.  Negating the notion of a \\"Black Nation\\"  A central part of this idea is the rejection of the possibility of African Americans forming a distinct nation in the United States. *The Southern \\"black belt\\" alleged basis for a black nation is a statistical-geographical fiction cobbled together by the Stalinists. *by the criteria of nationhood put forward by Stalin, U.S. blacks do not constitute a nation, because they do not possess either a separate language or culture. Especially, despite the assertions of black nationalists that \\"white America\\" constitutes an oppressor nation, the alleged black \\"nation\\" lacks a separate or autonomous geographic territory on which there is or potentially might be created a separate capitalist market economy, which is \\"oppressed\\" by some foreign imperialist power. *Black nationalism is not the essential thrust of U.S. black history: it is instead, like the Zionist movement in Europe among Jews, the product of the desires of a petit bourgeois stratum of blacks to elevating themselves politically and economically, to become capitalist politicians and capitalists, at the expense of their working class followers, by gaining their votes for political careers within the Democratic Party, and/or by exploiting them as a superoppressed labor force (much like, as in Chinatown, Chinese sweatshop owners exploit their own). *Besides these cynical self-aggrandizing motives of the black petit bourgeoisie, the appeal and attraction of black nationalism only gains ground among black working class and poor people during times of desperation about the basic struggle for equality. For example, Martin Delany's black nationalist novel Blake: or the Huts of America was written before the Civil War, when, ironically, Delany felt things were hopeless in the U.S. In the 1960s, black nationalism arose with the McCarthyite repression of trade union militants in the CIO, the CIO's fusion with the AFL and their turning firmly toward the Democratic Party, the growth in the power of anti-communist trade union bureaucrats, and their resort to racism to maintain a loyal following. The early industrial organizing days of the CIO, and the organizing efforts in Harlem and other places by the Communist Party, were radical, integrationist, inspiring hope among black workers that racial barriers would be overcome: thus the black nationalism of the Marcus Garvey movement and the Black Muslims was on the wane in the mid-1930s. Capitalism and racism The Revolutionary Integrationists argue that: *White racism against blacks is not the product of some inner \\"imperialism\\", \\"urge for domination\\", \\"male sexual competition\\", \\"innate inability to accept the Other\\", etc. Such explanations are all products of liberal idealism, not historical materialism. *Racism arises with the rise of capitalism: it is not expressed in the ancient world, nor in much of the feudal era. It gains ground as the feudal mode of production begins to deteriorate. The Jews, losing their status as a feudal caste (See Abraham Leon, The Jewish Question: A Marxist Interpretation) become the scapegoats of choice for the developing capitalist class. Against the Irish, as Cox pointed out, British racism becomes a justification for the exploitation of the British working class. Against Africans, it becomes a rationale for their capture and enslavement in the U.S., and a means by which they are isolated from white farmers and workers, by the capitalist class. Today it is used by the capitalist class to divide the working class against itself, to privilege one sector of the working class, the whites (or to make them think they are privileged when day by day their own oppression actually grows), against the others (blacks, Latinos, Arabs, etc.), to prevent the working class from uniting. It also rationalizes the superexploitation of workers of color, and the forcing of them into the category of a permanent reserve army of labor of the chronically unemployed. *The history of the southern United States is not a history of a \\"southern ruling class\\" maintaining Jim Crow out of motives purely or mainly of racism. Since the Civil War broke the old Southern planter class, the South and its politicians, such as Strom Thurmond, etc. have been controlled by Northern corporations. U.S. Steel, for example, with offices in the North, provided funding for demagogues like Thurmond, who, in 1948, ran on a platform of segregation and fierce resistance to anti-lynch laws in Congress. *In the Civil Rights era of the 1950s and 60s, it is not the case that the Northern-based ruling capitalist class of the South as well as North switched sides and became firm liberal champions of racial integration. Instead, the U.S. capitalist class, particularly its multinational corporate wing which at the time supported the Democratic Party, realized that they could stave off a social revolution in the South by presenting themselves as the non-violent liberal movement's benefactors. \\"Sending federal troops to Mississippi\\", however, was not benevolent‚Äîthe FBI and the federal troops were as much or more concerned with crushing revolutionary militancy among blacks as they were with stopping the Klan. The FBI, for example, gave details in advance of the Freedom Riders' plans to local police officials, whom the FBI knew would reveal such details to the Klan.  Integration and the transitional program Radical integrationism argues that it is impossible, contra the assertions of liberal assimilationists such as Gunnar Myrdal and the early Martin Luther King Jr., for blacks to be integrated into a capitalist U.S. society. Integration, it is argued, can only be achieved in a socialist society. Revolutionary integrationism must not be confused with cultural assimilation, either. Culturally, as Randolph Bourne and James Baldwin argued, the culture of America itself must change, for genuine integration to take place. Thus leading black workers must be educated to see the fight for socialism as integral to their own struggle for emancipation, and fully integrated into the rank and file and leadership of a future U.S. Bolshevik-Leninist party. In turn,this process of racial integration must be fully integrated into the transitional demands made by socialists. Such demands as worker control of hiring, organize the South, organize unions of the unemployed, organize the unorganized, full employment through public works, armed self-defense of black neighborhoods (\\"block patrols\\") must be fully taken up by Leninists.

Southside is located directly south of and adjacent to the University of California, Berkeley campus. Because of the large student presence in the neighborhood, proximity to Sproul Plaza, and history of the area, Southside is the neighborhood most closely associated with the university. History Southside began in the 1860s as a real estate development by the private College of California, the predecessor to the university. The trustees of the College needed to buy a large farm to the east of the College's planned campus to secure its water rights over the headwaters of Strawberry Creek. To raise money for that project, they decided to also buy land to the south of the planned campus at the same time and sell lots adjacent to the campus to create a college town. They initially hired Frederick Law Olmsted to plan the new town, but eventually decided to go for a more traditional grid layout. Except for a small area around Piedmont Avenue designed by Olmsted, the streets were laid out in a 1/8 by 1/8 mile grid, and named alphabetically for prominent academics.Wollenberg, Charles. \\"Berkeley, A City in History\\" The east-west oriented streets were named in order from the northernmost to the southernmost street: Allston, Bancroft, Channing, and Dwight, all of which retain their old names. The north-south oriented streets were named from easternmost to westernmost: Audubon (now College), Bowditch, Choate (now Telegraph), Dana, Ellsworth, and Fulton. These initial blocks have been subdivided by the insertion of Durant Avenue, and Haste, Kittredge, and Atherton Streets. The neighborhood didn't begin to grow until after 1873, when the university moved to Berkeley from Downtown Oakland. The neighborhood was connected to Oakland by a horsecar (then streetcar) line along present-day Telegraph Avenue. It grew steadily over the next few decades, with a business district along the streetcar line, and farmhouses and mansions, then rooming- houses, apartments, hotels, churches, and new streets filling the large blocks.Wollenberg, Charles. \\"Berkeley, A City in History\\" This 1978 view over the neighborhood shows Sproul Plaza and the Unit 3 dormitory complex. By the 1920s the area was a dense urban neighborhood extending as far north as Strawberry Creek. In the 1930s the university campus began expanding southward into the neighborhood, beginning with Edwards Stadium and Harmon Gym. In the 1950s, '60s, and '70s, the entire area north of Bancroft Way was acquired by the university and demolished for new campus buildings and Sproul Plaza. During this time the university also greatly expanded its student housing, taking several city blocks within Southside by eminent domain to construct high-rise dormitory \\"units\\". One of the blocks acquired and demolished during this wave of expansion became the centerpiece of a conflict with people who wanted it to become a neighborhood park. The protests and riots over People's Park became one of the symbolic events of the 1960s, and the park remains a source of controversy and conflict today. Today The Unit 2 dormitory complex. The building on the left was part of the original construction, the one on the right is a new addition. The boundaries of Southside extend roughly from Bancroft Way to the north to Dwight Way to the south, east of Fulton Street and west of Panoramic Hill. In the 2000 US Census, the neighborhood had a population density of approximately 30,000 people per square mile, making it the most densely populated neighborhood in Berkeley. The neighborhood had a median age of 21 years, lower than every other neighborhood in the area, reflecting the dominant student population. The intersection of Bancroft Way and Telegraph Avenue serves as the primary gateway to UC Berkeley, and Telegraph is a major pedestrian thoroughfare as well as a shopping area, with sidewalk vendors and stores catering mainly to students and out-of-town visitors. Durant Avenue east of Telegraph has many cheap restaurants, many of them Asian, earning it the nickname \\"the Asian Ghetto\\" among Berkeley students. Fraternities and sororities are clustered in the eastern end of the neighborhood around Piedmont Avenue, which has become known as \\"Frat row\\". During the fall of 2010, the Berkeley Student Food Collective opened after many protests on the UC Berkeley campus due to the proposed opening of the fast food chain Panda Express. Students and community members worked together to open a collectively-run grocery store right off of the UC Berkeley campus, where the community can buy local, seasonal, humane, and organic foods at prices that everyone can afford. The Berkeley Student Food Collective still runs to this day at 2440 Bancroft Way. Government Southside constitutes the majority of Berkeley's District 7 and is represented by Kriss Worthington. Because of its high student population it is considered one of Berkeley's most left-leaning neighborhoods.

It is the administrative center of Lome woreda.  Overview  Mojo is not only accessible by road (a road connecting the town to Adama was built before the Italian conquest) but has been the location of a train station of the Addis Ababa - Djibouti Railway since the line was extended from Dire Dawa to Akaki in 1915.

Located in Gamo Gofa Zone of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region, this town has a latitude and longitude of with an elevation of above sea level. It is surrounded by Demba Gofa woreda.Google Maps - SawlaSawla OpenStreetMap  History  The Founding of Sawla (Felege Neway). The town was founded in 1959 during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie. The main factors for its founding were its conducive climate and environment, fertile soil, suitability for expansion of infrastructure, the presence of an airport at that time, availability of water and different spices including coffee, and its importance as a business center. In 1963 the Gofa Awuraja was transferred to Sawla from Bulki and this played a role for the relatively fast structural development of the town. The ancient name of Sawla is Felege Newaye. Sawla town has its present name from ‚ÄúSa7a‚Äô‚Äô ‚Äò‚Äôwula‚Äù a Gofa word that means \\"the gate of land.\\" This name was given because Sawla was serving as the center of business for the surrounding districts. In 2002/2003 the Southern Nations Nationality Peoples Regional State Works and Urban Development Bureau study has classified it as one of the city administrations in the region. Sawla is a reform and has a municipal status urban kebelle. The town got the first plan in 1965, and the current plan in 2002. Records at the Nordic Africa Institute website provide details of the primary and secondary school in Sawla in 1968. A study to build a road to connect Sawla with Ameya in Ela woreda was conducted in 1996.\\"Local History in Ethiopia\\" (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 15 February 2008) On 1 July 2008, the Ethiopian House of Peoples' Representatives voted to ratify a US$9 million loan agreement signed with the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa for the implementation of a rural electrification project linking Sawla and Key Afer in Hamer Bena woreda.

The majority of the inhabitants were Protestants, with 49.12% of the population reporting that belief, 45.22% practiced Ethiopian Orthodox Christianity, and 4.63% were Muslim. Census 2007 Tables: Southern Peoples, Nations and Nationalities Region, Tables 2.1, and 3.4. The 1994 national census reported Sawla had a total population of 15,764 of whom 7,861 were men and 7,903 were women. Climate Owing to its location near the equator, Sawla features a Tropical savanna climate (K√∂ppen Aw). However, it is atypical for its classification, owing to its latitude and altitude. Despite the Aw classification, which indicates a dry winter and a wet summer, Sawla has two dry seasons, one occurring in winter, and another, less pronounced dry season in the summer. Similarly, there are two rainy seasons, the strongest being in the spring and a weaker one in autumn. This occurs due to the Intertropical Convergence Zone passing over the equatorial regions in the spring and fall, which is typical of the region. Although still meeting K√∂ppen's tropical threshold, temperatures are significantly cooler due to Sawla's altitude, thus giving the location characteristics closer to a highland climate.  Education  Educational Institutions *The first Romanwork primary school was established in 1961 E.C. which was later renamed to Felegneway junior and secondary school. Present day it is called Botre School, which was promoted and renamed to Sawla Senior Secondary school in 1976 E.C., now called Sawla Secondary and Preparatory School. *Sawla technical school was established in 1996 E.C., presently called Sawla Construction and Industrial College. *The town has nine governmental and fourteen private educational institutions. From those governmental institutions, AMU Sawla campus is a higher educational institution, and Sawla Construction and Industrial College is in TVET level. There are ten full primary and elementary schools, five secondary schools, and one preparatory school. From those private educational institutions there are six colleges and three full primary and elementary schools, and two secondary schools.  Transport  Sawla is from Addis Ababa, southwest of Hawassa and northwest of Arba Minch. The road from Addis Ababa to Sodo is asphalt. However, from Sodo to Sawla has not been paved yet. This does not mean that there is difficult transport. There is very good road and so many vehicles are coming and going. The town is serving as exclusive transport option for seven woredas: Meloko-koza, Basketo, Geze Gofa, Oyda, Demba Gofa, Zala, and Uba Debtetsehay.

History The game was introduced to Latin America in the late 19th century by British immigrants. In Argentina many of these immigrants had arrived to work on the construction of the Argentine Railway network. This British heritage is reflected in the names of many Argentine clubs including Alumni Athletic Club, Newell's Old Boys, River Plate and Boca Juniors. The British clubs had a policy of exclusion towards the local \\"creole\\" population. This led to a backlash against Quilmes Athletic Club resulting in the formation of Argentino de Quilmes, the first exclusively Argentine club to compete in the Argentine leagues. The phrase gradually lost its significance as the British domination of the game receded due to the rising popularity of the game amongst the locals and the influx of football playing Italian immigrants. In recent years the vast majority of players in the Argentine leagues have been at least 2nd or 3rd generation Argentines or players from other South American countries such as Uruguay, Paraguay and Colombia. Style The Creole style of football was described as being free moving and more artistic. Jennifer C. Pratt who wrote on the subject of Creole football made the following comparison: :\\"One of the most apparent differences between British and local players were their playing styles. The English values of gentlemanly behaviour dominated and impregnated the spirit of the game ‚Äî they considered their most important aspects as strength, virility and physical stamina. The British expected to find the spirit of the gentleman behind every player. While the English prided themselves in a style that was grounded on collective discipline and common effort, the Creoles (local players) based their style on individualism and the lack of tactical sense. To the Creoles, football was a form of art, while the British executed it like machinery. One was graceful while playing and the other was more in tune with the technicalities of the sport.\\" Eduardo Galeano described another aspect of the Creole style of play. The purpose of the style was to \\"dazzle and awe\\". The Creole Player had to be well versed in his own footballing \\"language\\", as Galeano explains: :\\"the ball was strummed as if it were a guitar, a source of music.\\" :\\"football players created their own language in that tiny space where they chose to retain and possess the ball rather than kick it, as if their feet were hands braiding the leather.\\" This was the foundation from which many great exponents of the style would emerge over the years to entertain millions. Many players have used this style of play to great degrees of success internationally. There is a common footballing expression in the Spanish speaking world: Cuidar la pelota (which literally means \\"take care of the ball\\"). Today the expression refers to the act of maintaining possession of the ball in order to protect a lead, but in the infant years of creole football it literally meant \\"treat the ball gently\\". The creoles had grown accustomed to playing the ball in short consecutive \\"touches\\", simply because the ball was too expensive to be kicked around and treated like a toy.

It is connected to the nearby small towns of Cherpulassery and Perintalmanna (in Malappuram district) by road. Kathakali dance Karalmanna has given birth to several Kathakali artists, in earlier times they were supported by the ten art-patronising Namboodiri Manas (mansions of the upper-caste Namboodiri community). Festivals The Shiva temple hosts the Kathakali nights that are conducted as part of its annual ulsavam (festival). Late Kottakkal Sivaraman, celebrated for his female Kathakali roles, was a native and resident of this place. Karalamanna was also the birthplace of the late actor-dancer Thekkinkattil Ramunni Nair, a disciple of Pattikkamthodi Ravunni Menon who rescripted the grammar of the Kalluvazhi style of Kathakali and refined its aesthetics. Among the Kathakali artistes of today from Karalmanna are Narippatta Narayanan Namboodiri and Sadanam Bhasi, besides Narippatta Raju, more known for his expertise in Modern theatre world stages. He was former professor in National school of Drama ( NSD) Trichur. Karalmanna hosts several seminars and workshops on Kathakali and allied classical arts, thanks largely to the local cultural forum called Vazhenkada Kunchu Nair Memorial Trust. It has of late raised an auditorium (close to the Grameena Vayanasala or the village library) that has been venue for cultural festivals like the Kathakali Samaroham, episodes of which are still being telecast by leading Malayalam television channels Asianet and People TV on a daily basis. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVyo99nyUHqPIurg3O7kZjPyZA118UvDB Celebrities Karalmanna was the native village of the late artist Athippatta Sivaraman Nair, simply known as A.S.

Thirumullappulli Mahadeva Temple The Thirumullappulli Siva templeKARALMANNA THIRUMULLAPPULLY MAHADEVA KSHETHRAM , Karalmanna Thirumullappulli Mahadeva Kshetram (2009) of Karalmanna is quite unique in that its prathishta has but few parallels anywhere around. He is Aghora Siva, the fierce Lord sitting pre-occupied and hell-bent on avenging Daksha and worshipped in His Roudra bhava, in a posture that is awe- inspiringly ascetic. To the multifarious devotees of Karalmanna, Lord Siva of Thirumullappulli is both a protector and benefactor. He is their sole prop, a dependable deity in times of all their hardship and misery. They would willingly attribute the causes of their sufferings to the aghora aspect of the Lord of Thirumullappully, if not as the direct outcome of his curses, evidently as result of their inability to win over His other milder attributes like the valsalya bhava, which is the object of adoration in some other Mahadeva temples of Kerala . The most significant festival in Thirumullapulli is the Yearly Temple Festival which commences exactly eight days before the Thiruvathira Nakshathtra Varam in the Kumbha masa. The Pallivetta, the ritualistic royal hunt of the Lord to drive off the evil spirits, was originally conducted on the seventh day of the festival under the huge peepul tree that once stood in the east nada of the temple. This is now being conducted under the peepul near the Moorkkath temple .The festival culminates with the Aarattu, the holy bath of the Lord for purification at the Holy Ghat of Perandamanna kadavu of Thootha Puzha, where it suddenly changes its usual south-north course to westward.

Originally a 50/50 joint venture between Yahoo! and Seven West Media, it has been a 100% subsidiary of Verizon Media since March 2018. Yahoo! is a web portal, providing email, online news and lifestyle content, as well as weather, travel and retail comparison services. History =Origins= Yahoo!'s services originally came to Australia in 1997 with Yahoo! Australia launching on 1 September that year. Seven Media Group founded i7 in September 2000 as their online service. In October 2001, Seven partnered with internet service provider AOL and established a joint venture called AOL7 in an attempt to boost the i7 platform. However, the partnership was unsuccessful with AOL reporting its biggest quarterly loss in U.S. history in April 2002, and Seven and AOL later selling the venture to Primus Telecommunications in February 2004. i7 was replaced by Seven's new website, Seven.com.au, soon afterwards. =Yahoo7= Yahoo7 was founded in January 2006 as a cross-media entity which would expand the content distribution networks of both internet-centric Yahoo and broadcast corporation Seven Media Group (now Seven West Media). Yahoo7's logo incorporates Yahoo! branding with Seven West Media's red \\"7\\". Yahoo7 replaced Yahoo!'s Australian and New Zealand websites which had been in operation since September 1997, taking on the majority of Seven's online operations in the process. Ryan Stokes, current chairman of Seven's Pacific Magazines division, said in a media release that the Yahoo7 entity would provide a \\"leading platform to engage the online audiences with the best global products and locally relevant media content for their connected lives\\". In December 2006, Yahoo7 expanded its presence in New Zealand by partnering with Telecom New Zealand to establish Yahoo!Xtra. The venture was rebranded as Yahoo! New Zealand in April 2011 after Telecom sold its 49% share back to Yahoo7. In recent years, Yahoo7 has made a series of high-profile online acquisitions to supplement its core search and marketing businesses. The company purchased Australian sports tipping site OzTips in mid-2010 and acquired Australian group buying site Spreets for $40m in early 2011. Spreets saw its membership increase by 140 per cent to 1.18m since the acquisition. In March 2018, Seven West Media sold its 50% stake in Yahoo7 to Oath. This is despite earlier reports where Oath would sell their stake. By this time, Seven was in the process of uncoupling its services from Yahoo7, through the establishment of 7plus replacing Plus 7 and their travel website: 7Travel. Products and services =Online content= Yahoo! derives its content from a variety of news and online media sites, as well as third-party content. The company runs a number of online sections which collate and augment content from various media outlets. Yahoo! also publishes an increasing volume of online-only content particularly lifestyle journalism and rich media published through the lifestyle section. =Plus7= In January 2010, Yahoo! launched Plus7, an online catch-up portal for viewers to stream select TV shows with locked commercials and Seven News updates for a limited period of time after airing. The free service allowed users to watch a range of video content on demand, full length episodes from Channel Seven, 7mate and other content partners. =Web= Yahoo! also hosts a localised version of its Yahoo! communication and search as well as other vertical search services such as Yahoo Answers.

It is a cost- effective international mail. At first SAL mail is processed and transported by surface in the origin country. Then it is transported by air to the destination country and finally processed and delivered as standard-type mail by the destination postal administration. The service is faster than surface mail while the cost is lower than air mail. SAL is more economical for sending heavy items; with light items, it sometimes costs more than air mail. History Prior to World War II a number of European countries adopted the practice of forwarding letters to distant destinations at no extra cost to the sender (such as British mail sent to most parts of the British Empire). The consistently high costs of air mail curtailed this trend after the war. During the mid-1960s in response to the continuing increase of aircraft capacity, the UPU adopted the policy of maximizing air conveyance of mail and in the mid-1970s the concept of ‚Äúsurface air lifted‚Äù mail was developed in conjunction with the International Air Transport Association (IATA).

She is regarded a matriarch to the Chabad dynasty as well as Hebron's Jewish population in general.Chassidic Rebbe Biographies  Origin of name  Rebbetzin Slonim was born on the 19 Kislev, 5559 AM (27 November 1798), the same day her grandfather, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi was released from imprisonment in S. Petersburg. Her father chose the name Menucha because in Hebrew the word \\"menucha\\" means \\"peace and quiet\\". He said, \\"Henceforth we shall have a little Menucha.\\"Days in Chabad:Historic Events in the Dynasty of Chabad-Lubavitch, Brooklyn, 2002, p.70-71, 133-135 She was named Rachel after an aunt that died in her youth. Her husband's last name was originally Griver, a descendant of Rabbi Moses Isserles, the Rema; they chose to change it to Slonim (this was when it was still easy to change names). They then moved to Hebron.  Emigration to Hebron  After she fell dangerously ill, her father promised that she would live to emigrate to the Land of Israel. In 1845, with the blessing of her brother-in-law, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn, she and her family emigrated to Hebron. To allay her fears of rainstorms on the journey to Hebron, Rabbi Schneersohn blessed her to \\"walk between the raindrops.\\"page 2Machon Alte Sefad  Life in Hebron  For forty-three years she served as the matriarch of the Hebron community. New brides and barren women would request blessings from her. Before she died on the 24th of Shevat, 5648 AM (6 February 1888), she sent a letter to the then Rebbe, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn, informing him of her imminent passing. She thus lived during the leadership of all of the first five Lubavitcher Rebbes. She became renowned among both townspeople and beyond, Jews and non-Jews alike for her curative and salvation abilities, and was nicknamed \\"the grandmother Menucha Rachel\\". Every bride who visited the Tomb of Machpela on the day of her wedding came to get her blessing and the Admor Rebbe Elazar Mendel of Lelov used to visit her home three times a week when staying in Hebron. He was strict about standing when she entered or left the room and always asked her to bless him. The family of Eliezer Dan Slonim of Hebron. The family of Rabbi Mordechai Dov Slonim, son of Rabbi Ya‚Äôakov Slonim and Rebbetzin Menucha Rochel Slonim of Hebron. Her family went on to become leaders of the Hebron Jewish community, helping unite the Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jewish communities and reaching out to the Arabic community. Her son was Rabbi Yehuda Leib Slonim, who was the father of Rebbetzin Moshke Devora Epstein, who inherited Menucha Rochel's home when she got married. Other children included Rabbi Mordechai Dov Slonim. Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Slonim was the chief Ashkenazi rabbi during the 1929 Hebron massacre. His son was Eliezer Dan Slonim, who spoke fluent Arabic and was a member on the city council and a director of the Anglo-Palestine Bank. He had excellent relations with the British Mandate authorities and Arab community and was reported to have not believed in rumors of an impending riot. He and his family were slaughtered as they attempted to make a barricade in the Slonim family house. One-year-old Shlomo Slonim (1928-2014) survived the massacre. He was the grandson of Rabbi Yaakov Yosef Slonim and son of Eliezer Dan Slonim. Shlomo Slonim went on to join the Irgun Tzvai Leumi, the Haganah, and the Israel Defense Forces. He worked for Bank Leumi for almost 50 years, was married for 50 years, and had 4 children. His photo as a wounded toddler is included in the Museum of the Jewish Community of Hebron as are many photos of the Slonim family.  Annual Visits to Grave in Hebron  Grave of Menucha Rochel Slonim in Hebron. Today, the grave of Menucha Rochel Slonim receives hundreds of visitors every year, especially on the anniversary of her passing. It is located in the Old Jewish cemetery, Hebron. The grave made headlines in 1997, when the H1 and H2 sections of the city were created. Concerned residents and supporters protested the government to ensure that the cemetery and Menucha Rochel's final resting place were not left outside of the designated area. Other venerated Jewish scholars buried in the cemetery include Eliyahu de Vidas, Solomon Adeni, Elijah Mizrachi and Yehuda Bibas. Today, the local Chabad chapter in Hebron leads visits to her grave and continues her legacy. In 2002 The Menucha Rochel Kollel, a learning center moved to a historic building adjacent to the grave of Menucha Rochel in the cemetery. Daily classes and services are held there.

The failed node may have control over shared resources that need to be reclaimed and if the node is acting erratically, the rest of the system needs to be protected. Fencing may thus either disable the node, or disallow shared storage access, thus ensuring data integrity. Basic concepts A node fence (or I/O fence) is a virtual \\"fence\\" that separates nodes which must not have access to a shared resource from that resource. It may separate an active node from its backup. If the backup crosses the fence and, for example, tries to control the same disk array as the primary, a data hazard may occur. Mechanisms such as STONITH are designed to prevent this condition. Isolating a node means ensuring that I/O can no longer be done from it. Fencing is typically done automatically, by cluster infrastructure such as shared disk file systems, in order to protect processes from other active nodes modifying the resources during node failures. Mechanisms to support fencing, such as the reserve/release mechanism of SCSI, have existed since at least 1985. Fencing is required because it is impossible to distinguish between a real failure and a temporary hang. If the malfunctioning node is really down, then it cannot do any damage, so theoretically no action would be required (it could simply be brought back into the cluster with the usual join process). However, because there is a possibility that a malfunctioning node could itself consider the rest of the cluster to be the one that is malfunctioning, a split brain condition could ensue, and cause data corruption. Instead, the system has to assume the worst scenario and always fence in case of problems. Approaches to fencing There are two classes of fencing methods, one which disables a node itself, the other disallows access to resources such as shared disks.Alan Robertson Resource fencing using STONITH. IBM Linux Research Center, 2010 In some cases, it is assumed that if a node does not respond after a given time- threshold it may be assumed as non-operational, although there are counterexamples, e.g. a long paging rampage. The STONITH method stands for \\"Shoot The Other Node In The Head\\", meaning that the suspected node is disabled or powered off. For instance, power fencing uses a power controller to turn off an inoperable node. The node may then restart itself and join the cluster later. However, there are approaches in which an operator is informed of the need for a manual restart for the node. The resources fencing approach disallows access to resources without powering off the node. This may include: :* Persistent reservation fencing uses the SCSI3 persistent reservations to block access to shared storage. :* Fibre Channel fencing disables the fibre channel port :* Global network block device (GNBD) fencing which disables access to the GNBD server When the cluster has only two nodes, the reserve/release method may be used as a two node STONITH whereby upon detecting that node B has 'failed', node A will issue the reserve and obtain all resources (e.g. shared disk) for itself. Node B will be disabled if it tries to do I/O (in case it was temporarily hung). On node B the I/O failure triggers some code to kill the node. Persistent reservation is essentially a match on a key, so the node which has the right key can do I/O, otherwise its I/O fails. Therefore, it is sufficient to change the key on a failure to ensure the right behavior during failure. However, it may not always be possible to change the key on the failed node. STONITH is an easier and simpler method to implement on multiple clusters, while the various approaches to resources fencing require specific implementation approaches for each cluster implementation.

In exchange the big three car makers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) and later Volvo agreed that automobile production in Canada would not fall below 1964 levels and that they would ensure the same production-sales ratio in Canada. The two stated goals of APTA were to reduce production costs in Canada through more efficient production of a smaller range of vehicles and components, and to lower vehicle prices for consumers. After the signing of the Pact, far fewer models of cars were produced in Canada; instead, larger branch plants producing only one model for all of North America were constructed. In 1964, only seven percent of vehicles made in Canada were sent south of the border, but by 1968, the figure was sixty percent.\\"Canadian motor show report and pics\\". Autocar, 15 February 2013 By the same date, forty percent of cars purchased in Canada were made in the United States. Automobile and parts production soon surpassed pulp and paper to become Canada's largest industry. From 1965 to 1982, Canada's total automotive trade deficit with the U.S. was $12.1 billion; this combined a surplus of around $28 billion worth of assembled vehicles and a deficit of around $40.5 billion in auto parts. The agreement resulted in lowered prices and increased production in Canada, creating thousands of jobs and increasing wages. These newly created jobs were highly localised to southern Ontario, with little employment benefit to the rest of Canada. The jobs created by the new market conditions under the pact were almost exclusively blue collar; administration, research and development remained in the United States. This transfer of control of Canadian automaking operations to their US parent corporations substantially reduced the autonomy of the Canadian operations with respect to vehicle and component specification, design, and sourcing; manufacturing and production, branding and marketing, and corporate policy. The agreement also prevented Canada pursuing free trade in automobiles elsewhere internationally, and this North American exclusivity led Transport Canada to adopt the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rather than participating in the European-based development of international consensus on auto safety and emissions regulations.Lighting Regulation Round the World: What, How, Where, and Why Drivingvisionnews.com, retrieved 2011-02-22 Other automobile manufacturers around the world complained to the World Trade Organization that the agreement to eliminate tariffs only for the Big Three companies gave these companies an unfair sales advantage in Canada.\\"WTO tells Feds to dismantle auto pact\\".

It was used in 1858 to illegally import slaves from Africa. It was seized for service with the United States Navy during the American Civil War. In U.S. Navy service from 1861 to 1865, and under outright U.S. Navy ownership from 1863 to 1865, she was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat, as a tender, and as a hospital ship. She was decommissioned, put into merchant use, and lost off Cuba in 1871.  Construction and private ownership  Wanderer‚Äîa schooner-rigged yacht built in 1857 in the shipyard of Joseph Rowland at Setauket on Long Island, New York by Thomas B. Hawkins‚Äîwas designed as a pleasure boat and build for speed. She was originally owned by Colonel John Johnson of New York City and Louisiana. After Johnson sailed the boat for a cruise down the Atlantic coast and to the Gulf of Mexico, during which he visited Charleston, South Carolina, Brunswick, Georgia, Key West, Florida, and New Orleans, Louisiana, Wanderer returned to New York City. Johnson soon sold the ship to William C. Corrie of Charleston, South Carolina.  Service in the slave trade  Wanderers new owner had several alterations made to the ship at Port Jefferson, New York, some of which‚Äîparticularly the installation of tanks which could hold of fresh water‚Äîsuggested that Wanderer was being fitted out as a slave ship. These concerns were brought to the authorities in New York City by Port Jefferson's Custom House officer. As the Wanderer was attempting to leave Port Jefferson harbor New York harbor, she was seized as a suspected slaver on 9 June 1858 by the steam revenue cutter USRC Harriet Lane of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, which was awaiting her departure.Rudder Magazine, February 1904 She was towed to Manhattan Island, and anchored near the Battery. The next morning, United States Government officials inspected the schooner and found that‚Äîwhile her extremely fast lines and her equipment and provisions would be valuable assets should she enter the slave trade‚Äîthere was no conclusive evidence of intent to engage in slaving on the part of her owner, her master, or crew. Wanderer was thus free to clear port, and she sailed for Charleston, South Carolina, where she arrived on 25 June 1858. There, her fitting out as a slave ship was completed before she got underway for Port-of-Spain, Trinidad, on 3 July 1858. Wanderer left Port-of-Spain on 27 July 1858, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Africa, and entered the Congo River on 16 September 1858. Braving an epidemic of yellow fever which was then raging in the Congo, she took on board some 500 Africans and sailed for North America on 18 October 1858. She was chased briefly by the U.S. Navy sloop-of- war as she left the mouth of the river but quickly outdistanced Vincennes. At the end of a six-week voyage in which many of the captives died, Wanderer arrived at Jekyll Island, Georgia, on 28 November 1858 and delivered her human cargo. Word of Wanderers arrival quickly spread, and a great deal of litigation ensued‚Äîboth civil and criminal‚Äîbut resulted in no convictions. During the next two years, ownership of the vessel changed several times and, on one occasion, the ship was stolen and taken to sea on a piratical and slaving voyage. Near the coast of Africa, the first mate led a mutiny and left the pirate captain at sea in a small boat before bringing the ship back to Boston, Massachusetts on 24 December 1859 and turning her over to authorities there.  Seized by the United States Government  A week before the outbreak of the American Civil War, Wanderer, registered to owners in the southern United States then seceding to form the Confederate States of America, arrived in Key West, Florida, from Havana, Cuba, on 5 April 1861. She was caught in that port during the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter on 12 April 1861 and confiscated by the United States Government in May 1861 to prevent her from being used by the Confederacy as a privateer. = Support to the United States Navy = Operating out of Key West from 27 June 1861, Wanderer carried wood, coal, water, and mail to the vessels of the Gulf Blockading Squadron. On 30 November 1861, she stopped the British schooner Telegraph off Key Vaccas, Florida. Upon examination of Telegraphs papers, Wanderer released the British schooner, but the incident nevertheless prompted a diplomatic protest from the British government on 8 March 1862. When Union naval forces were divided on 20 January 1862, Wanderer was assigned to the newly formed East Gulf Blockading Squadron. She continued provisioning and dispatch duties, operating between Tortugas, Florida, Havana, Cuba, and Cape San Antonio, Cuba. In early July 1862, Wanderer patrolled off Indian River and Jupiter Inlet, Florida, in search of possible blockade running activity but found none. In October 1862, she was assigned to the blockade of St. Andrews Bay. Florida. By 1 January 1863, Wanderer had returned to Key West for re-coppering and cruised between Saint Marks and Cedar Key, Florida, in early March 1863. Accompanied by Ezilda, she captured the sloop Ranger off Cedar Keys on 25 March 1863. Wanderer also captured the schooner Annie B. and her cargo of cotton on 17 April 1863 off Egmont Key, Florida. On 30 April 1863, Wanderer proceeded to Key West for extensive repairs to her hull and spars. = Under U.S. Navy ownership = Meanwhile, legal action against Wanderer was slowly taking place in the United States, and she was condemned by the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, prize court in May 1863 and was simultaneously purchased by the United States Navy. Wanderer left Key West early in May for patrol duty west of Tortugas. She stopped in Tampa Bay, Florida, in June 1863 and had returned to Key West by 15 July 1863 for refit as a hospital ship. She remained in ordinary through the autumn of 1863 and winter of 1863-1864 undergoing alterations to prepare her for this new role, and she was ready in the spring of 1864. However, hot and humid weather brought an epidemic of yellow fever to Key West during June and July 1864. All crewmen on board Wanderer sickened, and one died. The vessel spent the remaining months of 1864 at Key West as a guard ship.  Post-war decommissioning, sale and subsequent commercial career  Wanderer deteriorated rapidly during her relative inactivity. On 1 June 1865, shortly after the end of hostilities, Rear Admiral Cornelius K. Stribling, commanding the East Gulf Blockading Squadron, advised that Wanderer not be sent north for disposal because of her unseaworthy condition. She was sold at public auction on 28 June 1865 at Key West by A. Patterson to Packer and Watson. She subsequently entered the banana trade and operated in mercantile service until lost off Cape Mais√≠, Cuba, on 21 January 1871.

This section of canal is now known as the Welland Recreational Waterway. The bridge formerly carried the main line of the Canada Southern Railway (CASO) over the canal. As a result of the Welland Canal Relocation Project in the early 1970s, the CASO line was rerouted through the Townline Tunnel, bypassing this bridge. One track crossing Bridge 15 remained in service as an interchange line between the Canadian National Railway Canal Subdivision through Welland and the new Wainfleet Marshalling Yard at Wainfleet, Ontario. In the late 1980s, service on this line between Welland and Wainfleet ended and the track was removed between Wainfleet and a point a couple of hundred meters west of Bridge 15. The bridge remains in use today exclusively to serve Vesuvius Industries in Welland. It is owned by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), but is not connected to any other CPR tracks. It is used only sporadically by Trillium Railway, and chain link fence gates have been installed at both ends of the bridge to keep trespassers off. Bridge 15 is visually similar to the Montrose Swing Bridge located on the Welland River approximately 15 km away; however, that bridge is a Warren Truss, as opposed to the rarer Baltimore Truss of Bridge 15. The two bridges were constructed at approximately the same time. The Niagara, St. Catharines and Toronto Railway Swing Bridge over the canal (Bridge 8) at Thorold, Ontario was also constructed at approximately the same time. That bridge, built for interurbans and light electric freight locomotives, was a lighter construction and only carried a single track. Bridge 8 no longer exists.  Design and construction  Bridge 15 was built ca. 1910 as a replacement for a wooden bridge formerly at the same location. During this time, the Third Welland Canal was still in use, however the need for expansion of the canal had been recognized. Accordingly, any new bridges were being constructed to standards which were expected to apply to the Fourth Welland Canal, which would not be completed until 1932. As will be discussed later in this article, these standards were not set high enough and this fact would make the swing bridge a serious hazard to navigation decades down the road. During the early years of its existence, prior to the opening of the fourth canal, navigation was only possible to the east side of the bridge. Electrical power to operate the bridge was supplied via an overhead cable from the west shore. With the opening of the fourth canal, there was navigable water on both sides making an overhead wire impossible. Since the bridge was designed to have the power fed from overhead and not beneath, an underwater cable was run from the shore to the more northerly concrete fender (which protected the ends of the bridge from ships when it swung). A pole was erected on each fender, and a guy wire run between them directly over the bridge. The power cable was suspended from this guy wire to reach the top-hat-shaped device in the middle of the bridge which transferred the power to the rotating bridge. This top-hat, and the two poles on the fenders, are still visible today. This is a relatively unusual method of providing power to a swing bridge.  Operations  As with most moveable bridges on railway lines, Bridge 15 was protected by interlocking. This system made it physically impossible to have a signal indicating to trains that it was clear to proceed when the bridge was open. In the case of bridge 15, however, the operator was responsible for more than just the bridge itself. The bridge control cabin also functioned as an interlocking tower for the junction with the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo Railway (located a short distance west of the bridge), as well as a crossover immediately west of the bridge, the at-grade crossing of the Niagara, St. Catharines & Toronto Electric Railway (N, S & T), and sidings on both sides of the canal. The N, S & T line was abandoned in the 1960s, but the other interlocking remained until the canal relocation in 1972/73. Accordingly, the bridge would have needed to be manned year round - even when the canal was closed for the winter.  Hazard to navigation  It is a fact that gigantic ships sometimes do not go precisely where their master wants them to. Navigating thousands of tons of ship through a bridge with only a few meters to spare must indeed have been a challenge. There were accidents. One, documented with photographic evidence in a yahoo! discussion group shows the timber fenders on the west side of the bridge crushed, obviously by an impact from a ship. The swing bridge sitting right in the middle of the channel was severe hazard. Anecdotes from some sailors who travelled through this bridge indicate that there was a bell located on the bridge which would ring whenever a ship made contact. This would warn the crew to check for damage. After the opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, large ocean-going vessels were frequent visitors to the Welland Canal. Many of these ships are far better suited to the open ocean than to the narrow confines of the canal.  Canal relocation  Bridge 13 (the Main Street vertical lift bridge) visible in the background The hazard created by this bridge, combined with the fact that the narrow, curving section of canal through Welland had no less than a total of six bridge crossings in just a few miles, led to the decision to inaugurate the Welland Canal Relocation Project. With the first sod turned in 1967, this project would relocate the canal to a much straighter alignment with no bridges about 2 km east of bridge 15. This route of the new canal would sever the CASO line. As part of the relocation project, this line, as well and the Canadian National Cayuga Subdivision, were rerouted through the new Townline Tunnel. Bridge 15 ceased to be on the main line, and with the removal of shipping from the abandoned canal, it no longer had any reason to swing. It continued to be used as an interchange route between Canadian National and various railway companies operating out of the Wainfleet Yard. The west bound track was removed, leaving only a single track operational on the bridge. But even this service was not to last. In the late 1980s, the line fell into disuse and was removed from a point just a couple of hundred meters west of Bridge 15.  The bridge today  Today, this bridge carries only rare movements into Vesuvius Industries by Trillium Rail. The bridge is a rusting relic. Pictures from an historic bridge site show the top plates of the main beams under the former west bound line to be almost completely rusted away. In an attempt to keep trespassers off the bridge, the railway has placed gates at each end blocking access. The bridge can be accessed from each end via walking/bicycle trails, although the gates prevent access onto the bridge deck. The bridge is a popular destination for scuba divers.

He is most famous for writing the lyrics to the Serbian National anthem Bo≈æe pravde in 1872. Biography Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá was born in Senta, a town on the bank of the Tisa river in the region which eventually became Serbian Vojvodina, on 13 November 1826 (Julian Calendar) to merchant Filip and Ana (n√©e Male≈°eviƒá) ƒêorƒëeviƒá. Jovan was baptized on 17 November of that year in the Serbian Orthodox Church of Archangel Michael, officiated by Very Reverend Georgije-ƒêuka Popoviƒá, one of the most erudite clerics of his day in that region of Potisje, and author of Put u raj (The Road to Heaven), a book in praise of moral principles. The acting bug bit hard when he first appeared as a teenager in Hungarian and Serbian amateur theatricals in his hometown of Senta. He started his schooling in Senta, Novi Sad, Szeged, Temisvar, and Pest, where he was a Tekelijanum scholar (having received a stipend from the Sava Tekelija Endowment). Throughout high school (gymnasium) and university he pursued his chosen career as a professional actor and manager, appearing in hundreds of plays he himself organized in which he received a reputation of high versatility and originality. The 1848 Revolution interrupted his university education and he left Pest for Sombor where Grand Zupan Isidor Nikoliƒá Dzaver (1806‚Äì1862) of Baƒçka first appointed him secretary of the town's municipal court house, and then a position of judicial clerk at Lugos. In 1852 he was appointed professor of a high school in Novi Sad. There ƒêorƒëeviƒá came to loggerheads with the school's administrators, who were against Vuk Karad≈æiƒá's language reforms, and left his teaching post to become secretary of the Matica Srpska and editor of the learned society's magazine Letopis Matice Srpske in 1857. Two years later (1859), Danilo Medakoviƒá appointed ƒêorƒëeviƒá to position of co-editor (with ƒêorƒëe Popoviƒá) of Srpski Dnevnik. He eventually relinquished his position to Svetozar Miletiƒá in 1861 and joined Dr. Jovan Andrejeviƒá Joles on their long, overdue project ‚Äì the construction of the Serbian National Theatre in Novi Sad. With the new theatre ƒêorƒëeviƒá showed his interest in Serbian drama through the productions of plays by ƒêorƒëe Maletiƒá, Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá, Matija Ban, Joakim Vujiƒá, and others. In 1868 he founded the Serbian National Theatre in Belgrade, where he offered increasingly elaborate contemporary productions of Serbian and foreign playwrights and dramatists, like Stevan Sremac, Milorad Popoviƒá ≈†apƒçanin, Milovan Gli≈°iƒá, Svetislav Vuloviƒá, Kosta Trifkoviƒá, Branislav Nu≈°iƒá, Imre Mad√°ch, J√≥zsef Katona, Gy√∂rgy Bessenyei, Schiller, Henrik Ibsen, Oscar Wilde, √âmile Augier, Jules Sandeau, Eug√®ne Marin Labiche, Victorien Sardou, Ivan Turgenev, Gogol, Maksim Gorky and other. Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá on a 2005 Serbian stamp Belgrade at the time had a competing theatre, the Theatre on ƒêumruk, where Jovan Sterija Popoviƒá first produced his play \\"Death of Stephen Uro≈° III Deƒçanski of Serbia\\" in 1841. ƒêorƒëeviƒá also established the prestigious Academy of Dramatic Art (Glumaƒçka akademija) first at the Serbian National Theatre before the school eventually moved to its present location, now accredited by the University of Belgrade's Faculty of Dramatic Arts. The teaching staff at its inception was composed of Jovan ƒêorƒëeviƒá and Aleksa Baƒçvanski, an international actor who also went by the name of ≈†andor Varhidi. Today it is regarded as one of the most renowned drama schools in Eastern Europe, and one of the oldest drama schools in the Balkans, having been founded in 1870. Later, ƒêorƒëeviƒá became a professor of general history at Belgrade's Grandes √©coles. In 1893 he served for a short time as Serbia's Minister of Culture under the Jovan Avakumoviƒá Administration, and Alexander I of Serbia's tutor. He wrote poetry and translated and adapted many plays for the theatre. He compiled and prepared a Latin-Serbian, Serbian-Latin Dictionary, which he had worked on from 1882 to 1886. His best work is a theatrical allegory Markova sablja (Marko's Sword) and the text (lyrics) to the hymn Bo≈æe pravde, with music by Davorin Jenko. He died in Belgrade on 9 April 1900.

It led to the independence of Vietnam. History Vietnam became a colony of France in the late 19th century, but during World War II, Japan occupied Vietnam. During this period the Viet Minh fought a guerrilla war against the Japanese and were to a degree supported by the Americans in 1945 via the Office of Strategic Services. On August 22, 1945 the OSS agent Archimedes Patti, who had previously met Ho Chi Minh in Southern China arrived in Hanoi on a mercy mission to liberate allied POWs and were accompanied by Jean Sainteny a French government official.Interview with Carleton Swift, 1981, http://openvault.wgbh.org/catalog/vietnam-9dc948-interview-with-carleton-swift The Japanese forces informally surrendered (the official surrender took place on Sept. 2, 1945 in Tokyo Bay) but being the only force capable of maintaining law and order the Japanese Imperial Army remained in power while keeping French colonial troops detained.Stuart-Fox, Martin.

College career Arrington (#16) in 2006 In 2004, Arrington's freshman season, he caught two passes for 12 yards in eight games. In 2005, Arrington's sophomore season, he played in one game, then was injured and played in no further games, allowing him to redshirt for the season and gain an additional year of college football eligibility in 2008. As a junior in 2006, Arrington played in all 13 games and started five at wide receiver. He finished second on the team in receptions with 40, second in touchdowns with eight, and third in receiving yards with 544. He also made four catches for 34 yards against USC in the 2007 Rose Bowl, one of them for a touchdown. As a senior in 2007, Arrington made 58 catches for 729 yards and six touchdowns, finishing second to Mario Manningham on the team in all three receiving categories. In his last game as a Wolverine, Arrington had nine receptions for 153 yards and two touchdowns aiding Michigan to a victory over heavily favored Florida in the 2008 Capital One Bowl. After the 2007 season, Arrington opted to forgo his eligibility for the 2008 season and entered the 2008 NFL Draft.\\"King, Slaton, Manningham all headed to NFL\\", Associated Press at USA Today, January 15, 2008. Professional career Arrington was drafted by the New Orleans Saints with the 237th overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. The Saints traded a 2009 sixth- round pick to draft Arrington. On July 18, 2008, the Saints signed him to a contract, with terms undisclosed. On August 29, Arrington was placed on injured reserve for the 2008 season due to a toe injury during the first preseason game. Arrington spent the 2009 regular season on the Saints' practice squad, but on January 20, 2010, he was moved to the active roster prior to the NFC Championship Game, due to concerns about Robert Meachem's ankle injury, but did not play. He was waived on September 29, but re-signed to the practice squad. Arrington was moved to the active roster on December 29. In 2012, Arrington had off-season surgery on his meniscus and was unable to participate in any preseason games. Despite his injury, he made the regular season roster. On September 8, the day before the season opener, Arrington was cut, but he was re-added to the roster on the September 10.

The band formed in 2001 and released their first album, Sonic Prayer, through Gravity Records in 2005. Their second album, Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, was released in 2007 through Tee Pee Records. Mitchell sings occasionally, but the band's music is mostly instrumental and features long semi-improvised songs drawing on classic rock, psychedelic rock, jazz and krautrock. History =Formation and early years= Drummer Mario Rubalcaba moved back to his native San Diego to join Rocket from the Crypt, and eventually encountered future Earthless bassist Mike Eginton. Guitarist Isaiah Mitchell had been playing with a band called Lions of Judah when he met Eginton. Mitchell, Eginton and Rubalcaba discovered they all enjoyed Japanese psychedelic rock and German krautrock. Eginton suggested the name Earthless, inspired by a song titled likewise by a 1960s American rock group called the Druids of Stonehenge. The trio accepted the name for its \\"psychedelic ring\\" and ambiguity, but by then they had already been together for at least three months (five rehearsal sessions and one live show) without one. At the group's earliest rehearsal, they played songs from Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath interspersed between lengthy improvisations; at their second session the band only played their own material. They played their first live show together at the Casbah, a venue in their native San Diego, but in general they found it difficult to come together for rehearsals or shows owing to Rubalcaba also playing drums for Rocket from the Crypt at the time. He also played in Hot Snakes for a time, but after both groups disbanded, Rubalcaba and his Earthless bandmates had more free time to devote to their new project. Earthless' debut album, Sonic Prayer, was released in 2005 and won the 2007 Best Hard Rock Album award at the San Diego Music Awards, where their second album, Rhythms from a Cosmic Sky, was also nominated for the same award and the band themselves were nominated for Best Hard Rock Artist. =Live at Roadburn and hiatus (2008-2011)= Earthless performed at the thirteenth Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, the Netherlands on April 18, 2008. They were originally only scheduled to play to 250 people in the smallest room of the event as the main act, but were invited at the last minute to perform as the last act on the main stage to 2000 concertgoers instead, as the scheduled band Isis had only performed for half of their two-hour slot. Earthless performed for about an hour and a half, and were not aware the performance had been recorded, but did not object when Tee Pee Records requested they release an album based on the performance, liking the recordings themselves. The result was released on October 7, 2008 as Live at Roadburn, which Rubalcaba described as \\"the most honest representation of [Earthless] that you're gonna get on a record\\". He said that if listeners did not like the album they would not like to see the band perform live. In February 2009, Earthless toured with Witch in North America. The band toured in Europe and the UK with Russian Circles in April 2010, in the US in support of Baroness from November to early December, and in Australia for the first time from December 2010 to January 2011. As the band members continued with their rigorous touring schedule, they became increasingly involved with side projects (Rubalcaba with Off! and Mitchell with Howlin' Rain) and Mitchell moved to Northern California, which reduced the available time to rehearse as Earthless, much less record another studio album (even though some of the material on Live at Roadburn was intended for the next album). As an act, Earthless eventually entered into a period of inactivity by default, but not by intention. =Touring and From the Ages (2012-present)= After two years of not touring, Earthless came to Australia for a series of concerts in December 2012, and released a limited edition vinyl single to coincide with the tour. Earthless were again nominated for Best Hard Rock Artist at the 2013 San Diego Music Awards, and From the Ages won their second Best Hard Rock Album award the following year. Earthless toured in support of From the Ages along the western coast of the United States in October 2013, and with the Shrine in Australia from December 2013 to January 2014, and the east coast of the US in August 2014. They are embarking on a tour of Europe in October 2014, and have rescheduled a tour of Japan with Eternal Elysium that Earthless had to cancel to tend to ill family members; the tour will take place in January 2015. In 2016 Earthless, together with Harsh Toke, released a split-record each with a single track on it. On 16th March 2018, the band released their album 'Black Heaven'. Musical style Earthless consider themselves most strongly influenced by krautrock and psychedelic bands from Japan. Eginton has identified such Japanese groups as Blues Creation, Flower Travellin' Band, High Rise and White Heaven as being inspirational for Earthless, and for krautrock, Rubalcaba has named Guru Guru and Amon D√º√ºl II. Classic rock has also influenced the group, as they also share an interest in Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath. Eginton has also said the earlier work of Miles Davis has impacted the band, along with other modal jazz players, as the band often choose a key or mode and almost never play outside it even regardless of what the guitar solo becomes. Although typically labeled a stoner rock group, they reject the term, and the band have stated they do not use marijuana; rather, they drink coffee or iced tea. The band alternate between writing their songs out and improvising them on the spot, repeatedly playing the improvised parts in their live set to the point that the parts become features of the song. Rubalcaba has noted the distinction between improvisation and jamming; he argues that improvisation differs from jamming in that improvisation is more focused and has a purpose, while jamming does not. As Earthless are primarily an instrumental band, their music has no vocals by default, although Mitchell has sung vocals for the group on the few songs that need them (such as \\"Cherry Red\\" and \\"Woman with the Devil Eye\\"). Other than that, the group do not intend to hire a full-time vocalist, despite all the offers they have received over the years.

History  = Small beginnings (1993-1994) = In 1993, a group of Christian parents had the idea to start up a local Christian school somewhere in the Casino/Richmond Valley area. The first meeting discussing this idea happened with about ten families not too long after. Three Christian businessmen had been putting money into a fund to go towards inter-denominational Christian activities in the Casino area. This money ended up going towards the school. After a long period of discussion and planning, local doctor Bruce King donated eight acres (three hectares) of land to and for the school, and a local builder offered to do all the earth-moving required on the school's land. A local retired builder offered to build the very first building, but the Christian mission, Mobile Mission Maintenance, stepped in and helped too. This first building now serves as: * the main toilet block * canteen * staff room * high school English room * library * librarian's office * teachers resource room = First five years (1995-1999) = In 1995, the school opened with fifty-five students enrolled, ranging from Kindergarten to Year 6. Peter Robinson was the founding principal, and served as this until 1999. Robinson taught Years 3 to 6, Miss Shelley Evans taught Kindy to Year 2 by Term 2, Mrs Livingstone was employed to teach Years 3 and 4. In 1996 numbers had increased quickly to over 75. A second building needed to be built urgently, which was done by another local man and his team with the help of Government Funding. This second building now serves as (since 2008): * Kindergarten/Year 1 classroom * Year 2/Year 3 classroom * Year 4/Year 5 classroom * Year 5/Year 6 classroom * SWLD rooms * Primary art area Also in 1999, Peter Robinson stepped down as school principal but has continued teaching in the school. Ern Case then took over the role and he retired after serving for 10 years. His replacement who commenced in January 2009 is Phil Johnson. = The High School Begins (2000-2003) = In 2000 the Casino Christian High School began with the inaugural Year 7 class. The third building started to be constructed, which became the high school building and new administration offices. From 2001 to 2003, Years 8-10 were added, and the inaugural class graduated in 2003. This building now serves as: * History Room (where History, Geography, PDHPE and Biblical Studies are taught) * Computer Room (where Computers, Mathematics and Commerce are taught) * Food Tech Room (where Food Technology, LOTE and PDHPE are taught) * Science Laboratory (where Science and Mathematics are taught) = 2004 to the present day = In 2005, a combined outdoor sports court of three tennis courts, two basketball courts and two netball courts were built after many years of planning. In 2007, approval for a new fourth building was given and in early 2008 construction began. This building was completed towards the end of 2008, and consists of new Technology, Music and Art rooms. Commenced in late 2010 are another two buildings which are the new bigger Library and the Multi Purpose Centre. In 2012 another building was added consisting of new toilets and change rooms for the high school and separate automotive and woodwork rooms. There are many minor projects underway including covered walkways, a new school entry and children's adventure playground. As of 2014 year 11 has been added as of year 12 in 2015.

Richards and Company Store, also known as Whatcom County Courthouse and James B. Steadman Post No. 24, is the first and oldest brick building in the state of Washington,Territorial Courthouse (1308 E. Street) - City of Bellingham, WA United States, and is listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.National Register of Historical Places - WASHINGTON (WA), Whatcom County  History  This two story brick building was built in 1858 by the partnership of Thomas G. Richards and his brother Charles E. Richards, for a cost of US $8,000. A note in one of Howard Buswell's files, located in the Center for Pacific Northwest Studies, identifies John Alexander (a prominent settler on Whidbey Island) as being in charge of the construction. It was initially used as a storehouse of the T. G. Richards Company, supplying those stopping in what was then the town of Whatcom, Washington Territory, on their way to the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush. The building was constructed of brick manufactured in San Franciscohttp://www.whatcomhistory.net/territorial_county_courthouse.html. In Spring of 2012, the bricks were scientifically matched to a Nagle brick fragment. Nagle was an early brick maker in the city. The bark Ann Parry brought the bricks to Bellingham Bay on July 16, 1858. The Daily Alta California Shipping Intelligence listed her carrying 100,000 bricks and 73 barrels of lime. A second ship, the DM Hall, may have brought the windows and doors. In 1863, the building was sold to Whatcom County for the price of US$2,000, to be used as the (third) County Courthouse for Whatcom County. Court matters such as trials were handled in Port Townsend, not Whatcom. However, the building has become known as the \\"Territorial Courthouse\\", because of its role as the county courthouse in the days before statehood. In addition, the building served as the jail, and in 1873, became the home of the Bellingham Bay Mail newspaper. By 1877, a pharmacy was being run on the first floor. Originally being bounded by the tide flats of the bay, in 1874 a breakwater was added in to protect the building's foundation from the sea. In 1883, a vault, and five additional jail cells were added. In 1889 the building was deemed unsafe for use, and the county government offices and jail were moved to temporary quarters nearby. (In 1891 the county moved into the new courthouse on \\"G\\" Street, constructed of Chuckanut sandstone.) In 1890-1891, the Women's Relief Corps (WRC), an organization benefiting veterans of the American Civil War, began to rent the building. By 1906, Whatcom County had deeded the building into the private sector, when it was sold to members of the Grand Army of the Republic, J. B. Steadman Post No. 24, and the WRC. The building has since seen the tide flats filled in, resulting in the rise of E Street, so that the first floor has become the basement, and the second floor becoming the ground floor. Later occupants include the members of the Junior Order of United American Mechanics, a Jehovah's Witness Church, Aker's Taxidermy, The Northwest Passage (a 60s - 70s alternative newspaper), Base Camp, and lastly, a home to different artists and pottery makers.Edson, Lelah Jackson.

The remains of the settlement comprises the former Bolivia Hotel, a disused post office, a disused railway siding and a community hall.  History  The area where Bolivia was established is the territory of the Ngarabal people. In the Ngarabal language, the area is known as Bilba, meaning big bushes.N. Crawford. 1949. \\"Tenterfield\\". Tenterfield, NSW: Back to Tenterfield Committee This area has continued to remain significant to Ngarabal people since European settlement, containing significant sacred sites and ceremony grounds. There are records of 300 Aboriginal people taking part in a corroboree there in the 1870s.McBryde, I. 1974. \\"Aboriginal prehistory in New England : an archaeological survey of northeastern New South Wales.\\" Sydney: Sydney University Press. The first European settlement was in 1840, with the establishment of a sheep station owned by a squatter named Edward Hurry. Hurry had previously spent some years in Bolivia in South America, and chose this name for the land around his property. Hurry's sheep contracted catarrh and he sold Bolivia to Sir Stuart Donaldson who then held the property until 1843. During the 1840s, Bolivia was bought by Edward Irby. There was fierce Ngarabal resistance to Irby's incursion into their traditional territory, culminating in numerous expeditions led by Irby, together with Thomas Windeyer and his servants, Connor and Weaving, seeking retaliation against Ngarabal killings of men associated with their land holdings. Irby's memoirs record that on one of these expeditions, in 1842, they \\"routed\\" around 100 Aboriginal people, burning their camp and all of their property. On another, on October 17, 1844, Irby recounts that he and the men \\"punish(ed) severely\\" a group of Aboriginal people hiding in the rocks who they held responsible for the killing of one of their men.K.M. Schlunke, 2005. \\"Bluff Rock: Autobiography of a Massacre.\\" Fremantle: Fremantle Arts Centre Press. During the 1880s a township developed towards the foot of Bolivia Hill as the railway was extended through the area. The town supported two bakeries, two butchers, two general stores, a produce store, a post and telegraph office and the railway offices, workshop and stables etc. The first school opened in 1883 and closed in 1886. Several other schools opened later and one was operating up until November 1966. Bolivia Post Office opened on 30 April 1883 and closed in 1982. In 1981 the name Bolivia was assigned to the region covered by the various farms comprising Hurry's original estate, and is now an address locality for the farming properties scattered to the north and northeast of Deepwater. The former Bolivia Hotel on the New England Highway has been listed on the Register of the National Estate.Aussie Heritage This building was constructed c. 1840-1860 as a Cobb & Co. coach changing station and was later used as a post office and boarding house. Coach horses required regular changing about every 10 to 25 km in order to provide quick transport. These hotels were known as a \\"Changing Station\\" and here passengers and horses could have something to eat or stay overnight. The Bolivia School of Arts building was erected 1914 on land donated by A.M. White of Bolivia Station. Many minerals have been mined in the region including bismuth, gold, tin, silver, high quality silica and arsenic. The Bolivia Cemetery was dedicated in July 1884 and officially closed in February 1986. This and the Bolivia Station Cemetery were used regularly until c.1900 but have had little use since then. No headstones remain and a few plants and depressions in the ground are the only indication of the cemetery there.  Geography  Bolivia occupies land to the north of Deepwater Creek and along both sides of Splitters Swamp Creek. A series of rough granite outcrops dominate the landscape on either side of the creek beds. Little Bolivia Hill rises approximately eighty metres above Deepwater Creek on the southern boundary of the locality. Flora Bolivia Hill and the adjacent nature reserve are the only recorded locations of the endangered Bolivia Hill Boronia (Boronia boliviensis), Bolivia Homoranthus (Homoranthus croftianus),Bolivia Homoranthus Retrieved on 18 January 2009 Bolivia Stringybark (Eucalyptus boliviana), the shrub Bolivia Hill Pimelea (Pimelea venosa) and the vulnerable Bolivia wattle (Acacia pycnostachya).

In a note addressed to the Courteous Reader at the end of the play's text, Brome writes that the play was originally intended for William Beeston's company at the Cockpit Theatre, which suggests that the play was written sometime around 1636. (Brome was involved in a contentious dispute over his change of companies in these years, as the theatres suffered a prolonged closure from May 1636 to October 1637, due to the bubonic plague epidemic of those years.)Steggle, pp. 105‚Äì17. In that first edition, Brome dedicated the play to his patron, William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset. At around the same time, Brome sent a manuscript of his recent play The English Moor to the Duke, likewise dedicated to Somerset.

Brome may have pulled hints and suggestions from other travel accounts, since the play refers to the famous English explorers of the day, Sir Francis Drake, Martin Frobisher, Sir Richard Hawkins, and Sir Thomas Cavendish. Many earlier writers stressed the sheer strangeness of far lands; Brome's self-styled \\"master,\\" Ben Jonson, did so in a notable instance in his 1620 masque News from the New World Discovered in the Moon, with children who are part bird and coaches that are blown by the wind -- and some of Jonson's wonders date back as far as the Vera Historia of Lucian. Strikingly, though, the idea of the Antipodes as a \\"topsy-turvy\\" place, where familiar relationships are directly reversed, seems to have been original with Brome; no clear precedents for it have been identified.Andrews, pp. 113‚Äì27.Tommaso Campanella includes Antipodean material in his The City of the Sun (1623), though it partakes of the \\"strange wonders\\" tradition of Lucian and Jonson more than the direct polarities of Brome. Style No critic has ever claimed that Brome was a great dramatic poet or a truly distinctive literary stylist; his verse and prose are generally nothing more than functional, and certainly lack the vivid eloquence of Shakespeare and the intellectual knottiness of his idol Jonson. In The Antipodes, however, the richness of Brome's material appears to inspire him to an imaginative quality that he rarely achieves elsewhere -- as in this passage from Act I scene vi,The Act/scene division of the original edition, which marks a new scene when a new character enters; in a modern edition, I,iii. on Sir John Mandeville and the talking trees of the Antipodes: :::::::But he had reach'd ::To this place here -- yes here -- this wilderness, ::And seen the trees of the Sun and Moon, that speak, ::And told King Alexander of his death; he then ::Had left a passage ope for travellers, ::That now is kept and guarded by wild beasts, ::Dragons, and serpents, elephants white and blue ::Unicorns, and lions of many colours, ::And monsters more as numberless as nameless. Synopsis The play's plot is complex and intricate, even by the standards of Brome. The opening scene shows the herald painter Anthony Blaze welcoming Master Joyless to London from the country. Joyless is oppressed by a set of personal problems. He is an older man, a former widower who has married a second wife, a seventeen-year-old woman named Diana -- toward whom he is deeply possessive and jealous, fearing her potential infidelity. His son Peregrine has from his youth been obsessed with the literature of travel and voyaging, an obsession that is now so strong that it dominates his life, even to the point of preventing him from consummating his three-year-old marriage to his wife Martha -- a circumstance that has left her profoundly unhappy, and almost as psychologically disturbed as her husband. Blaze has a potential solution for all of the Joyless family's problems, in the treatments of a physician called Doctor Hughball, and the sponsorship of a mysterious nobleman named Letoy. Hughball had treated many disturbed Londoners successfully -- even curing Blaze himself of his own suspicions of his wife's fidelity. His wife, Barbara Blaze, becomes an active participant in the eventual cure of the Joylesses, helping to manage Martha Joyless in particular. Letoy is a wealthy aristocrat who pursues an odd lifestyle: he dresses plainly, yet furnishes his servants in rich clothes -- the opposite of what is standard for noblemen of Brome's era. He also keeps a troupe of players, who he and the Doctor employ in their treatment of psychologically distressed individuals. The Doctor administers a powerful sleeping potion to Peregrine Joyless, and together with Master Joyless and his wife Diana they go to Letoy's country estate. There, Peregrine is told upon waking that he has travelled to the Antipodes, the country directly opposite England on the other side of the globe. Letoy's players involve Peregrine in a pageant of life in \\"Anti-London,\\" as a means of curing his obsession. In the process, Joyless and his wife are treated as well, unwittingly to them. Most of the play's middle and later portions are taken up by a play within a play, in which the Doctor, Blaze, and the actors, all under Letoy's direction, fool Peregrine into believing that he is actually in the Antipodes. The play goes anything but smoothly, as Martha attempts to interrupt, as Joyless and Diana comment caustically from the vantage point of their own unhappy marriage, and as Peregrine turns to whole enterprise his own way; the actors have to improvise and extemporize, and sometimes lose their way. But Letoy manages to direct the whole show toward the outcome he envisions. In the metatheatre of the play within the play, Brome presents the society of \\"Anti-London\\" as a distorted mirror-image of English society of his day. (Brome carefully specifies that the Antipodean kingdom is like England in political structure and religion, thereby avoiding the two fatal subjects for a Caroline dramatist; his Antipodeans only reverse English \\"manners.\\") In Brome's Anti- London, lawyers are poor and shabbily dressed, while poets are rich and gaudy; a lawyer refuses all fees, until a female client beats him into accepting her money. A gallant begs from a beggar, so that he can buy his grandmother ballads and \\"Love-pamphlets,\\" and \\"Hobby-horses and rattles for my grandfather.\\" A maiden tries to pick up a gallant in the street, and when he refuses her she kicks him. Old men are sent to school by their adult children, and play hooky when they can. Servants rule their masters. Gentlemen talk and behave as crudely as the lowest of common laborers, while watermen and carmen comport themselves with grace and gentility. The play goes somewhat awry when Peregrine wanders into the players' \\"tiring house\\" and finds their properties. Thinking he's in \\"some enchanted castle,\\" he slaughters their stage \\"Monsters, giants, furies, beasts, and bugbears,\\" ::Kills monster after monster; takes the puppets ::Prisoners, knocks down the cyclops, tumbles all ::Our jigambobs and trinkets to the wall. By right of conquest, Peregrine crowns himself king of the Antipodes, with the players' pasteboard crown and sword of lath. Letoy, however, turns this unforeseen event to his advantage: he has Byplay, the leader of the actors, set the new king the task of reforming his kingdom. Then, the topsy-turvy aspects of the Antipodes become less humorous and more threatening. A statesman entertains several \\"projectors,\\" who present him with wild speculative projects -- like increasing wool production by flaying horses alive and affixing sheepskins to them. The Statesman accepts all their follies. Antipodean justice punishes the victims of disasters like fires and shipwrecks, with \\"Imprisonment, banishment, and sometimes death,\\" to teach them to be more careful next time; and it rewards thieves, bawds, and even \\"The captain of the cut-purses\\" when they are old and can no longer practice their crimes. The shocked and chastened king Peregrine determines to reform and rectify his kingdom. Peregrine is presented with his wife Martha, dressed as his queen; he is told that she is the daughter of the last king of the Antipodes, and he must mate with her to secure his crown. Under the guidance of Doctor Hughball and Barbara Blaze, the couple retire to bed and consummate their marriage. Afterwards, Peregrine is like a man come out of a dream; his sanity and mental balance are returning. Letoy almost drives Joyless to desperation, by making the old man believe that he, Letoy, is trying to seduce Joyless's wife Diana. Instead, Joyless witnesses Diana reject the nobleman's advances. Letoy informs both of them that he is Diana's true father. Years before, he had put aside his infant daughter to be raised by his client Truelock. In his younger years, Letoy himself had suffered from the curse of irrational jealousy, and had suspected that his daughter was another man's child. Only a death-bed assurance from his wife convinced Letoy that he had been wrong. Having recovered from his own irrationality, he turned to helping others do the same. The play concludes in a masque: Discord ushers in the personifications of Folly, Jealousy, Melancholy, and Madness, to \\"most untunable\\" music. They, however, are driven out by Harmony, who leads in Mercury, Cupid, Bacchus, and Apollo, who bring wit, love, wine, and health. Sexuality The subject of sex is central to the play's concerns. At least part of Joyless's problem with his wife is that he is no longer capable of satisfying her sexually; he fears that his wife will seek out another man for \\"some sport,\\" since he \\"can make her none.\\" Doctor Hughball asserts that in the Antipodes \\"the maids do woo / The bachelors,\\" and that \\"The wives lie uppermost\\" -- which Diana Joyless calls \\"a trim / Upside-down Antipodean trick indeed.\\" Martha Joyless is a child bride, a \\"poor piece of innocence\\" who has been kept ignorant of sexuality; she longs desperately for a baby, but doesn't quite know how to get one. She weeps as she complains of her husband Peregrine that ::He ne'er put child not any thing towards it yet ::To me to making; for I am past a child ::To think they may be found in parsley beds, ::Strawberry banks or rosemary bushes, though ::I must confess I have sought and search'd such places ::Because I would fain have had one. Barbara Blaze calls Martha's enforced married chastity \\"monstrous.\\" Martha asks Barbara \\"How came you by your babies?\\" and wants to be shown the mechanics of sex. Martha says that \\"A wanton maid\\" once kissed and fondled her -- a franker indication of lesbian activity than plays of English Renaissance theatre usually provide. [See The Queen's Exchange and A Mad Couple Well-Match'd for other Brome allusions to lesbianism.] Before he consummates his marriage, Peregrine talks about the Gadlibriens, a people mentioned in Mandeville who have an odd sexual practice: a bridegroom always hires \\"Another man to couple with his bride, / To clear the dangerous passage of a maidenhead.\\" This suggests an inhibition and fear of sexuality that goes deeper than anything derived from Peregrine's obsession with travel. At the end of the play, Brome includes Cupid and love as an essential part of his recipe for social sanity. Theatrics In staging his play within a play, Letoy acts like a theatre director; he criticizes the mannerisms of the players and guides them toward a naturalistic style of acting. Brome doesn't have Letoy insist upon slavish adherence to the author's text; quite the opposite, he stresses the players' talent for improvisation when the play and its purpose demand it. Yet he censures the habits of comic actors who play to the audience for easy laughs, as \\"...in the days of Tarleton and Kempe, / Before the stage was purg'd from barbarism....,\\" though this censure must be qualified, as it has far too often not been, by the Prologue's criticism of the contemporary stage. Brome also gives a vivid miniature picture of the \\"crude coil\\" of the actors squabbling over their costumes, wigs, and false beards. Critical responses Brome's play touches upon so many themes and subjects -- theatre itself;Stern, pp. 63, 95, 97‚Äì8, 103, 111‚Äì12. psychology and psychotherapy; sexuality and gender roles; lesbianism;Traub, pp. 60‚Äì1. colonialism and the alienness and \\"otherness\\" of foreign cultures;Barfoot and D'haen, pp. 15‚Äì16. social satire and social justice;Harris, p. 162 n. 48. etc. -- that many authors on these disparate subjects have discussed it or referred to it.Jowitt, pp. 11‚Äì12, 191‚Äì2, 214‚Äì24, 228n, 230n. The play stands as one \\"model for later antipodes- literature\\"Faucett, p. 8. and the utopian and dystopian literature to which it relates. A modern production The Antipodes is unusual among Brome's plays in having received a prominent modern production, directed by Gerald Freedman. It was staged at the modern replica of Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London in August 2000. Notes References *Andrews, Clarence Edward. Richard Brome: A Study of His Life and Works.

Porpora that deals with the United States involvement in Central America in regards to their participation in the genocidal policies of Nicaraguan counterrevolutionary forces and the reaction of the general public to the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. Author information Douglas V. Porpora is chair of the Department of Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology at Drexel University. He is an active member of NETWORK, a national social justice lobby, and is the author of three other books, The Concept of Social Structure (1987), Landscapes of the Soul: The Loss of Moral Meaning in American Life (2001), and Transcendence: Critical Realism and God (2004). Focus of the book Unlike other accounts of the Holocaust and genocide, How Holocausts Happen focuses on the citizenry served or ruled by genocidal governments rather than on the governments themselves. Porpora argues that moral indifference and lack of interest in critical reflection are key factors that enable Holocaust-like events to happen. He characterizes American society as typically being indifferent to the fate of other people, uninformed, and anti-intellectual. Porpora cites numerous examples of U.S.-backed Latin American government actions against their own peasants, Indians, and dissident factions. He offers a theory of public moral indifference and argues that although such indifference is socially created by government, the media, churches, and other institutions, the public must ultimately take responsibility for it. How Holocausts Happen is at once a scholarly examination of the nature of genocide and an indictment of American society.A powerful indictment of U.S. intervention in Central America, Temple University, Pennsylvania, November 22, 2007 Footnotes 1990 non- fiction books ","title":"How Holocausts Happen"},{"id":"14355121","text":"Bornean orangutan (Pongo pygmaeus) List of primates contains the species in the order Primates and currently contains 16 families and 72 genera.

History =1990s= The band was formed in 1997 in Novi Sad by guitarist/vocalist Mihajlo Obrenov and drummer/vocalist Robert Sabado≈°. Soon after, they recorded their first official release Abnormal Waltz from 1998, the soundtrack for the movie Noir that was never finished. Without much musical experience, dreDDup members started experimenting with live instruments combining them with loud electronic synthesizers. At first, they made rave, techno, electronic punk and experimental music while performing live only at their rehearsal space for friends and other musicians. Their '90s era includes Beyond the Dark Portal demo cassette, 'Abnormal Waltz' DIY release and several cassette EPs. Their first songs were aired on radio shows 'Situacija 021' hosted by Vladimir Petra≈° and 'High Voltage' hosted by Dunja Kovaƒç at 'Radio 021' in Novi Sad. Their song 'Roots of Us' remained at the first place on 'Situacija 021' music chart for several weeks. dreDDup started performing live at the end of the '90s in small venues in Novi Sad. =2000s= In the year 2000, after one live concert at Borisov Atelje underground club, Robert left the band and Mihajlo became the new vocalist for the band. The band continued with a new line-up, changing from electronic experimental to more rock-oriented sound. Drummer Sini≈°a Radovanƒçev from Lost Propelleros joined the band for a while. The new stable line-up included Aleksandar Krajovan from Lowspin on bass and Nikola Pro≈°iƒá on drums. Following this, the band wrote music for movies and theater plays (including Poslednja Krapova Traka, Footfalls, U malom dvorcu, Hronika Sterijinog pozorja) and recorded ambient tracks for TV shows at the Radio Television of Serbia. In 2001. the band entered studio 'Do Re Mi' with the band Mefisto to record a split demo CD, followed by two separated DIY releases of both bands: Bili smo ponosni ratnici album of Mefisto and R U Digital!? demo album of dreDDup. In 2002. Karolina Nemet joined the band as a keyboard player, followed by MC Sanya on backing vocals. Nikola Pro≈°iƒá left the band in 2003 and was replaced by session drummer Dragan Mr≈°iƒá from the band Cutwork. In 2004 the band finally released its first official studio album Mr Borndeads Feast for MoocSound records from the Netherlands. The album release was followed by a massive tour around Serbia. Line-up included two new members, Darko I≈æak on guitar and Srƒëan Stevanoviƒá on drums. The band started performing frequently at various venues in Novi Sad, Subotica, Kula, Zrenjanin, Beograd, Senta and other Serbian towns.

In a collaboration with the bands Roir, Maltreat and Under Pressure the band released 'One Way' in 2005, a CD compilation which included several tracks from all 4 bands and a comic book drawn by Mihajlo Obrenov. Aleksandar Krajovan left the band in late 2006, and was replaced by Nemanja Batalo on bass guitar. In 2007. the band released their second album Future Porn Machinefor Insurrection Records from Belgrade.

Another tour took place and the band visited more than 40 cities.

The new line-up included Bojan Radakoviƒá on guitar and Ivan Francuski on drums, leaving Mihajlo the only original member in the band. The band remixed some of Nine Inch Nails songs and did a collaboration album Pituitary Nightmare with Japanese spoken word artist Kenji Siratori and also collaboration album 'The Great Industrial Comeback' with electronic music project Figurative Theatre. dreDDup played at numerous music festivals from 2006 to 2009, including the EXIT Festival, String, Refuse Resist, Samhain festival, Go Fest, HGF, SGT, Determination and D:S.

Soon after, Aleksandra Vuko≈°iƒá left the band. The band changed its line-up rapidly during the 2014‚Äì2016 period, and several members came and went through, until Borivoje Janackoviƒá from Thread joined the band on drums. In early 2016, the band released their seventh album, titled DeathOven: Rebels Have no Kings. Their style changed and dreDDup incorporated more big beat and dance electronics elements into their music. 'DeathOven' features two guest vocalists: Lucretia Wamp from horror punk band Drop Dead and Marta Cso√≥r from Vrisak Generacije. Sini≈°a Radovanƒçev also contributed by playing backing drum loops on several tracks. He passed away on April 14, just ten days before the album came out. Timur Iskandarov from Tamerlan joined the band on bass guitar. In July, Mihajlo Obrenov finished work on his documentary movie Kontakt about underground music scene in Novi Sad. The film includes original music composed by dreDDup and rare interviews with 140 underground musicians, including dreDDup members. The movie was later screened at Cinema City Film Festival, Grossman Film Festival, DokumFest Bosnia, Filmski Festival Euro-In Film, Rokumentarni dani Nik≈°iƒá and other European festivals. On 4 July 2018, dreDDup opened for Soulfly. Their eight album Soyuz came out on November 27, 2018. Album was praised by a music critic Vladimir Horvat from Croatian magazine Terapija.net as one of their best works so far. The band began its promotional tour in early 2019 with a concert in Budapest, Hungary. They have announced their new album 'Romance of Romans' with a music video for the \\"Designed to Die\\" single on their YouTube channel. In March 2019, Dra≈æen ƒêorƒëeviƒá from Lednik replaced Timur on bass guitar. =2020s= In February 2020, the band went into studio to record their proposed new album, 'Romance of Romans'. Musical style The music of dreDDup is a mixture of dark noisy electronic sounds with rough industrial rhythms and metallic vocals. They are mostly influenced by the post-industrial music scene of the late 1980s and the mid-1990s. They have changed their sound since 1997 but were always somewhere between the electro-industrial/post- industrial boundaries. After experimenting with weird noises and rough drum beats they embraced commercial segments in their sound in 2014. As their influences they list Bile, The Prodigy, Kim Wilde and Skinny Puppy.

He was the Earl of Wiltshire in England between 1140 and 1141. About 1157, he succeeded his father, Guihomar III, as the Viscount of L√©on in Brittany. Earl of Wiltshire Eye Castle within the Honour of Eye According to William of Malmesbury,Brown (1994), 26. Harvey declined an invitation from King Henry I of England (1100‚Äì35) to attend his court.Everard (2000), 16. However, he went to England to assist King Stephen in the war against Matilda. The Gesta Stephani describes Harvey as \\"a man of distinction and soldierly qualities\\".Stringer (1993), 35. He was careful to state that he was going of his own free will and not out of compulsion or allegiance owed to the English king. Around 1139, in reward for his service to Stephen, who was at the time secure on his throne, Harvey received the hand in marriage of the king's illegitimate daughter Sybilla. He also received the Earldom of Wiltshire and the honour of Eye in Suffolk, which had been Stephen's before his accession. As lord of Eye, Harvey seems to have had the ambition to turn its priory, which depended on the abbey of Notre-Dame de Bernay in Normandy, into an abbey. He issued a charter confirming the priory's liberties and listing his predecessors as lord of Eye. He confirmed that the priory owed 10,000 herrings to the abbey of Bernay every year, asserted his right to select the prior with the abbot's approval and also asserted his right to raise the priory to an abbey at any time. Whatever his long-term intentions were, he did not hold the honour long enough to see them through.Brown (1994), 15‚Äì17. In 1140, Harvey somehow negotiated the surrender of Devizes Castle, preventing it from falling into the hands of Robert, Earl of Gloucester.Davies (1967), 44. In response, the king formally granted him Devizes so that he could better defend Wiltshire.Davies (1967), 140. From there, according to the Gesta Stephani, he fought \\"obstinate and unceasing warfare with the king's assailants.\\"White (2000), 84. The following year, however, he was embarrassed when Devizes was overtaken by a mob of countrymen (comprovinciales) and he abandoned it to Matilda's men. As a result, his earldom was confiscated and he left England in disgrace.Davies (1967), 54 and 131. Matilda then appointed Patrick of Salisbury her early in Wiltshire.Green (1997), 301‚Äì02. Harvey's wife probably followed him to Brittany. Likely because of her he held animosity towards the Plantagenet dynasty that succeeded Stephen on the throne.Everard (2000), 58. Viscount of L√©on About 1157, Harvey succeeded his father in L√©on. He expanded his power and began styling himself \\"Count of L√©on\\" (comes Leoni√¶), but he struggled to maintain his de facto independence from his immediate overlord, the Duke of Brittany, and from the influence of the England. In 1167 Harvey raised the standard of revolt with Eudo II, viscount of Porho√´t, and Geoffrey IV, viscount of Thouars, with tacit support from King Louis VII of France.Everard (2000), 44-45. After an agreement with Louis, King Henry II of England led a campaign against L√©on in August 1167. Harvey's son Guihomar was defeated and captured, and his major castles razed. Guihomar submitted and offered hostages. Harvey died soon after in 1168.  Issue  Harvey and Sybilla had several children: * Guihomar IV, who succeeded his father * E. who has been identified as Elimarius, Abbot of Landevennec, or possibly Eudon or Evenus, Abbots of Saint- MathieuChaillou, p. 24 * Hamo, Bishop of L√©on, murdered by his brother Guihomar in 1171 A mention dated 1169 indicates that Harvey had an illegitimate son: * Harvey, who was the father of Gradlon, Budic and GuigonKern√©vez and Bourg√®s (2007).

The corresponding problem in n-dimensional space, the smallest bounding sphere problem, is to compute the smallest n-sphere that contains all of a given set of points. The smallest-circle problem was initially proposed by the English mathematician James Joseph Sylvester in 1857.. The smallest-circle problem in the plane is an example of a facility location problem (the 1-center problem) in which the location of a new facility must be chosen to provide service to a number of customers, minimizing the farthest distance that any customer must travel to reach the new facility.. Both the smallest circle problem in the plane, and the smallest bounding sphere problem in any higher-dimensional space of bounded dimension are solvable in worst-case linear time. Characterization Most of the geometric approaches for the problem look for points that lie on the boundary of the minimum circle and are based on the following simple facts: * The minimum covering circle is unique. * The minimum covering circle of a set S can be determined by at most three points in S which lie on the boundary of the circle. If it is determined by only two points, then the line segment joining those two points must be a diameter of the minimum circle. If it is determined by three points, then the triangle consisting of those three points is not obtuse. Let be any set of points in the plane, and suppose that there are two smallest enclosing disks of , with centers at \\\\vec{z}_1 and \\\\vec{z}_2. Let r be their shared radius, and let 2a be the distance between their centers. Since is a subset of both disks it is a subset of their intersection. However, their intersection is contained within the disk with center \\\\frac 12 (\\\\vec{z}_1+\\\\vec{z}_2) and radius \\\\sqrt{r^2-a^2}, as shown in the following image: :300px Since is minimal, we must have \\\\sqrt{r^2-a^2}=r, meaning a=0, so the disks are identical. Linear-time solutions As Nimrod Megiddo showed,. the minimum enclosing circle can be found in linear time, and the same linear time bound also applies to the smallest enclosing sphere in Euclidean spaces of any constant dimension. His article also gives a brief overview of earlier O(n^3) and O(n \\\\log n) algorithms ; in doing so, Megiddo demonstrated that Shamos and Hoey's conjecture ‚Äì that a solution to the smallest-circle problem was computable in \\\\Omega(n \\\\log n) at best ‚Äì was incorrect. Emo Welzl. proposed a simple randomized algorithm for the minimum covering circle problem that runs in expected time O(n), based on a linear programming algorithm of Raimund Seidel. Subsequently, the smallest-circle problem was included in a general class of LP-type problems that can be solved by algorithms like Welzl's based on linear programming. As a consequence of membership in this class, it was shown that the dependence on the dimension of the constant factor in the O(n) time bound, which was factorial for Seidel's method, could be reduced to subexponential.. = Megiddo's algorithm = Run of Megiddo's algorithm phase, discarding from point set A,B,...,U needless points E, T. Megiddo's algorithm. is based on the technique called prune and search reducing size of the problem by removal of n/16 of unnecessary points. That leads to the recurrence t(n)‚â§ t(15n/16)+cn giving t(n)=16cn. The algorithm is rather complicated and it is reflected in big multiplicative constant. The reduction needs to solve twice the similar problem where center of the sought-after enclosing circle is constrained to lie on a given line. The solution of the subproblem is either solution of unconstrained problem or it is used to determine the half-plane where the unconstrained solution center is located. The n/16 points to be discarded are found the following way: Points are arranged to pairs what defines n/2 lines as their bisectors. Median of bisectors in order by their directions (oriented to the same half-plane determined by bisector ) is found and pairs from bisectors are made, such that in each pair one bisector has direction at most and the other at least (direction could be considered as -\\\\infty or +\\\\infty according our needs.) Let be intersection of bisectors of -th pair. Line in the direction is placed to go through an intersection such that there is n/8 intersections in each half-plane defined by the line (median position). Constrained version of the enclosing problem is run on line what determines half-plane where the center is located. Line in the direction is placed to go through an intersection such that there is n/16 intersections in each half of the half-plane not containing the solution. Constrained version of the enclosing problem is run on line what together with determines quadrant, where the center is located. We consider the points in the quadrant not contained in a half-plane containing solution. One of the bisectors of pair defining has the direction ensuring which of points defining the bisector is closer to each point in the quadrant containing the center of the enclosing circle. This point could be discarded. The constrained version of the algorithm is also solved by the prune and search technique, but reducing problem size by removal of n/4 points leading to recurrence t(n)‚â§ t(3n/4)+cn giving t(n)=4cn. The n/4 points to be discarded are found the following way: Points are arranged to pairs. For each pair intersection of its bisector with the constraining line is found. (If intersection does not exist we could remove one point from the pair immediately). Median of points on the line is found and in O(n) time is determined which halfline of starting in contains the solution of the constrained problem. We consider points from the other half. We know which of points defining is closer to the each point of the halfline containing center of the enclosing circle of the constrained problem solution. This point could be discarded. The half-plane where the unconstrained solution lies could be determined by the points on the boundary of the constrained circle solution. (First and last point on the circle in each half-plane suffice. If the center belongs to their convex hull, it is unconstrained solution, otherwise direction to the nearest edge determines half-plane of the unconstrained solution.) = Welzl's algorithm = The algorithm is recursive. The initial input is a set of points. The algorithm selects one point randomly and uniformly from , and recursively finds the minimal circle containing - { }, i.e. all of the other points in except . If the returned circle also encloses , it is the minimal circle for the whole of and is returned. Otherwise, point must lie on the boundary of the result circle. It recurses, but with as an additional parameter the set of points known to be on the boundary. The recursion terminates when is empty, and a solution can be found from the points in : for 0 or 1 points the solution is trivial, for 2 points the minimal circle has its centre at the midpoint between the two points, and for 3 points the circle is the circumcircle of the triangle described by the points. (In three dimensions, 4 points require the calculation of the circumsphere of a terahedron.) Recursion can also terminate when has size 3 (in 2D, or 4 in 3D) because the remaining points in must lie within the circle described by . algorithm welzl is input: Finite sets and of points in the plane ‚â§ 3\\\\. output: Minimal disk enclosing with on the boundary. if is empty or  = 3 then return trivial() choose in (randomly and uniformly) D := welzl( - { }, ) if is in then return return welzl( - { }, ‚à™ { }) Welzl's paper states that it is sufficient to randomly permute the input at the start, rather than performing independently random choices of on each recursion. It also states that performance is improved by dynamically re- ordering the points so that those that are found to be outside a circle are subsequently considered earlier, but this requires a change in the structure of the algorithm to store as a \\"global\\". Other algorithms Prior to Megiddo's result showing that the smallest-circle problem may be solved in linear time, several algorithms of higher complexity appeared in the literature. A naive algorithm solves the problem in time O(n4) by testing the circles determined by all pairs and triples of points. * An algorithm of Chrystal and Peirce applies a local optimization strategy that maintains two points on the boundary of an enclosing circle and repeatedly shrinks the circle, replacing the pair of boundary points, until an optimal circle is found. Chakraborty and Chaudhuri. propose a linear-time method for selecting a suitable initial circle and a pair of boundary points on that circle. Each step of the algorithm includes as one of the two boundary points a new vertex of the convex hull, so if the hull has h vertices this method can be implemented to run in time O(nh). * Elzinga and Hearn. described an algorithm which maintains a covering circle for a subset of the points. At each step, a point not covered by the current sphere is used to find a larger sphere that covers a new subset of points, including the point found. Although its worst case running time is O(h3n), the authors report that it ran in linear time in their experiments. The complexity of the method has been analyzed by Drezner and Shelah.. Both Fortran and C codes are available from .. * The smallest sphere problem can be formulated as a quadratic program defined by a system of linear constraints with a convex quadratic objective function. Therefore, any feasible direction algorithm can give the solution of the problem.. Hearn and Vijay. proved that the feasible direction approach chosen by Jacobsen is equivalent to the Chrystal‚ÄìPeirce algorithm. * The dual to this quadratic program may also be formulated explicitly;. an algorithm of Lawson. can be described in this way as a primal dual algorithm. * Shamos and Hoey proposed an O(n log n) time algorithm for the problem based on the observation that the center of the smallest enclosing circle must be a vertex of the farthest-point Voronoi diagram of the input point set. Weighted variants of the problem The weighted version of the minimum covering circle problem takes as input a set of points in a Euclidean space, each with weights; the goal is to find a single point that minimizes the maximum weighted distance to any point. The original minimum covering circle problem can be recovered by setting all weights to the same number. As with the unweighted problem, the weighted problem may be solved in linear time in any space of bounded dimension, using approaches closely related to bounded dimension linear programming algorithms, although slower algorithms are again frequent in the literature...

She was portrayed by the Emmy-winning actress Bea Arthur. All in the Family Maude Findlay first appeared on All in the Family in December 1971, in the second- season episode, \\"Cousin Maude's Visit\\", as the cousin of Edith Bunker. According to Norman Lear, the creation of Maude stemmed from the idea to bring on someone who could hold their own with Archie Bunker verbally.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RoyWkMuK_P4 The character was also loosely based on Lear's then-wife Frances. Maude cared for Edith, but disliked her husband, Archie Bunker. Archie and Maude were both known for getting on each other's nerves, especially since she was a liberal and Archie was a conservative. Because she was a liberal, Maude was also an ally of Edith's daughter, Gloria (Sally Struthers) and her husband, Mike (Rob Reiner). In her first appearance on All in the Family, it was said that Maude was widowed twice. Her first husband, Fred, died of a brain aneurysm, and her second husband, Bert, died of a heart seizure. (Archie remarked they both had smiles on their faces at their respective funerals.) When Maude premiered, Fred was now renamed Barney and Bert became Albert Hilliard, her third husband. A second appearance on All in the Family (the final episode of the second season) depicting Archie and Edith visiting Maude for a family wedding, essentially set up the premise for the forthcoming series. Maude Maude debuted on CBS on September 12, 1972. On her own show, Maude lives in Tuckahoe, New York, and is married, for the fourth time, to Walter Findlay (Bill Macy), the owner and operator of an appliance store called Findlay's Friendly Appliances.

It is 5.476 km in length and hosts a variety of national- level series including Stock Car Brasil, Formula Truck and Formula 3 Brasil. It has previously hosted non-championship rounds for both Formula One and the BPR Global GT Series, and in recent years has been scheduled to host both MotoGP and IndyCar, but due to costs and construction delays, neither event went ahead. Previously named Aut√≥dromo Emilio Medici and Aut√≥dromo de Bras√≠lia, the circuit's name was later changed to honor Formula 1 World Champion Nelson Piquet. Location The circuit is located in Brasilia, which is located in the Federal District of Brazil. It is located across the road from Brasilia's Est√°dio Nacional, which was a venue of the 2014 FIFA World Cup. History The circuit opened in 1974, named Aut√≥dromo Emilio Medici after the country's president at the time, and was built to provide a permanent home for motor racing in the relatively new city of Brasilia. Prior to this, races had been held on temporary street circuits in the city, although it was determined that a permanent circuit would be necessary to attract major events such as Formula One. Construction had begun in 1972 and took two years to complete, with the circuit being designed by engineer Samuel Dias. To celebrate the circuit's opening, a non-championship Formula One race, the Grande Premio Presidente Emilio Medici, was held on 3 February 1974, one week after the official Brazilian Grand Prix. Around 85,000 spectators attended the event, which was competed between just 12 cars, with local driver Emerson Fittipaldi claiming victory.http://en.espn.co.uk/f1/motorsport/story/65180.html ESPN - Bernie's busman's holiday to Brasilia - Laurence Edmondson - November 25, 2011 Following Emilio Medici's succession in the 1974 presidential election, the circuit was renamed to Aut√≥dromo de Bras√≠lia and continued to host a variety of national-level series for the following two decades. From 1995, the circuit was leased to NZ Empreendimentos, owned by Nelson Piquet, by the government of the Brazilian Federal District. Following this. the circuit underwent refurbishment, involving the installation of gravel traps, tyre barriers and lighting in order to bring the venue up to modern safety standards and allow it host international events again. In 1996, the circuit hosted a non- championship promotional race of the BPR Global GT Series. The event, held on 16 December 1996, was called the 2 Hours of Brasilia and was won by the BMW Motorsport entry consisting of Nelson Piquet and Johnny Cecotto. The event had been run in tandem with another promotional race held in Brazil, the 2 Hours Curitiba, which was held the weekend before the race in Brasilia. The following year the BPR Global GT Series became the FIA GT Championship, and the Brazilian races ultimately proved to be a one-off. There was discussion in 1997 about the possibility of Formula 1 returning to the circuit, with a proposal initiated by Nelson Piquet to move the Brazilian Grand Prix from Interlagos to Brasilia from 1999 onwards, but this proposal was short- lived.http://www.grandprix.com/ns/ns00987.html GrandPrix - Brazilian GP to switch venues? FEBRUARY 24, 1997 In 2006, the Federal District regained management of the circuit due to NZ Empreendimentos' lack of attention to the track's management. On 19 August 2013 it was announced that the circuit would host the MotoGP World Championship from the 2014 season onward, with the inaugural event scheduled for 28 September.http://www.motogp.com/en/news/2013/MotoGP+returning+to+Brazil+in+2014 MotoGP - MotoGP returning to Brazil in 2014 AutoEvolution - 2014 MotoGP: Brazil to Rejoin MotoGP with Nelson Piquet Brasilia Circuit In preparation for the series' return, major upgrades were planned for the circuit's facilities and the circuit itself was to receive a substantial reconfiguration in order to make it safer and suitable for hosting international events.http://www.autoevolution.com/news/2014-motogp-brazil-to-rejoin-motogp- with-nelson-piquet-brasilia-circuit-65339.html However, the event organizers were unable to secure funding to the complete the work in time and the event was removed from the final calendar on 24 February 2014.http://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and- views/racing/motogp/2014/february/revised-motogp-calendar-released-brazil- cancelled/#.VSM0GfmUcZ0 BikeSocial - Revised MotoGP calendar released, Brazil cancelled Another major announcement came on 18 September 2014, when it was confirmed that the circuit would host the opening round of the 2015 Indycar Series on March 8. Work to upgrade the circuit was resumed, using a combination of private funds and backing from the Government of the Federal District. The proposed circuit reconfiguration was less ambitious than that proposed for the MotoGP return, with the general layout retained and work mostly consisting of reprofiling corners, adding chicanes and relocating the pit lane. In January 2015 it was decided that, due to a lack of funding, the changes would be scaled back, with the pit lane remaining in its existing location, and just four corners being modified. However, on 29 January 2015, it was announced that the race had been cancelled as the newly elected district government deemed the event to be a waste of public funds, in the midst of a growing financial crisis for the district. This came as a shock, even to the event promoters, as more than two-thirds of the tickets had already been sold and a title sponsor had been acquired just one day prior to the cancellation.http://www.foxsports.com/motor/story/indycar-brazil-race- canceled-mark-miles-013015 Fox Sports - IndyCar: Mark Miles speaks out on Brazil race cancellation Following the announcement, construction work was halted with the circuit left in its half-finished state.http://www.racingcircuits.info/south- america/brazil/brasilia.html#.VSMyC_mUcZ0 Racing Circuits Info - Brasilia The district governor initially committed to having the work complete by 26 April, so the circuit could host its scheduled round of the Stock Car Brasil series,http://www.stockcar.com.br/Noticias/2015/02/04/vicar-se-reune-com- governador-do-distrito-federal VICAR SE RE√öNE COM GOVERNADOR DO DISTRITO FEDERAL (Portuguese) however the event has now been rescheduled to September due to delays with construction works.http://www.stockcar.com.br/Noticias/2015/03/06/alterada-praca-da- terceira-etapa-da-temporada ALTERADA PRA√áA DA TERCEIRA ETAPA DA TEMPORADA (Portuguese) References External links * Satellite picture by Google Maps * Trackpedia guide to driving Aut√≥dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet * Aut√≥dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet Official Website Brasilia Brasilia Sports venues in Bras√≠lia ","title":"Aut√≥dromo Internacional Nelson Piquet (Bras√≠lia)"},{"id":"14355432","text":"No. 175 Squadron RAF was a part of 121 Wing; 83 Group; 2nd Tactical Airforce; RAF in support of World War II Normandy landings, and supported the allied advance through France Holland and Belgium on into Germany.

Foreign internal defense (FID) is a term by the militaries of some countries, including the United States, France, and the United Kingdom, to describe an integrated and synchronized, multi-disciplinary (and often joint, interagency, and international as well) approach to combating actual or threatened insurgency in a foreign state. This foreign state is known as the Host Nation (HN) under the US (and generally accepted NATO) doctrine. The term counter-insurgency is more commonly used worldwide than FID. FID involves military deployment of counter-insurgency specialists. According to the US doctrinal manual, Joint Publication 3-22: Foreign Internal Defense (FID), those specialists preferably do not themselves fight the insurgents.Joint Publication 3-22: Foreign Internal Defense (FID), US Department of Defense, 12 July 2010 Doctrine calls for a close working relationship between the HN government and security forces with outside diplomatic, information, intelligence, military, economic, and other specialists. The most successful FID actions suppress actual violence; when combat operations are needed, HN security forces take the lead, with appropriate external support, the external support preferably being in a noncombat support and training role only. Definition Formally, FID is defined as, \\"Participation by civilian and military agencies of a government in any of the action programs taken by another government or other designated organization to free and protect its society from subversion, lawlessness, and insurgency.\\" =Instruments of national power= The FID effort is a multinational and interagency effort, requiring integration and synchronization of all instruments of national power. The military instrument of national power supports other instruments of national power (generally including also: diplomatic, information/intelligence, economic) to protect and enhance national security interests and deter conflict using a wide range of actions, including: * Military engagement, * Security cooperation (SC), and * Deterrence =Nation assistance= Within this range of military operations, nation assistance (NA) is civil or military assistance (other than foreign humanitarian assistance [FHA]) rendered to a nation by US forces within that nation's territory during peacetime, crises or emergencies, or war, based on agreements mutually concluded between the United States and that nation. Nation assistance operations support the HN by promoting sustainable development and growth of responsive institutions. The goal is to promote long-term regional stability. Nation assistance programs include: * security assistance (SA), * humanitarian * civic assistance (HCA), and * foreign internal defense (FID). =Internal defense and development (IDAD) program= It is important to frame the US FID effort within the context of the US doctrine it supports and to understand how it fits into the HN Internal Defense and Development (IDAD) program. US military support to FID should focus on assisting an HN in anticipating, precluding, and countering threats or potential threats and addressing the root causes of instability. Emphasis on internal developmental programs as well as internal defense programs when organizing, planning, and executing military support to US FID activities is essential. Although the FID operation is considered military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence, FID may include or support operations from across the range of military operations to support the HN's IDAD strategy. Accordingly, US military operations supporting FID provide training, materiel, advice, or assistance to local forces executing an IDAD program, rather than US forces conducting IDAD military missions for the HN. Internal threats means threats manifested within the internationally recognized boundaries of a nation. These threats can come from, but are not limited to, subversion, insurgency (including support to insurgency), and/or criminal activities. b. The focus of US FID efforts is to support the HN's internal defense and development (IDAD). IDAD is the full range of measures taken by a nation to promote its growth and protect itself from subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to their security. It focuses on building viable institutions that respond to the needs of society. It is important to understand that both FID and IDAD, although defined terms and used throughout this publication, are not terms used universally outside the Department of Defense (DOD). Other terms could be used to encompass what are called FID and IDAD herein. c. Military engagement during FID supports the other instruments of national power through a variety of activities across the range of military operations. In some cases, direct military support may be necessary in order to provide the secure environment for \\"Although on the surface, FID [foreign internal defense] appears to be a relatively simple concept, that appearance is deceptive; FID is a much more nuanced and complicated operation than its definition at first implies. FID is often confused with or equated to training foreign forces when in reality, there is much more to it.\\" Lieutenant Colonel John Mulbury ARSOF [Army Special Operations Forces], General [Conventional] Purpose Forces and FID Special Warfare, January‚ÄìFebruary 2008 Chapter I I-2 JP 3-22 IDAD efforts to become effective. However, absent direction from the President or the Secretary of Defense (SecDef), US forces engaged in NA are prohibited from engaging in combat operations, except in self-defense. d. From the US perspective, FID refers to the US activities that support an HN IDAD strategy designed to protect against subversion, lawlessness, insurgency, terrorism, and other threats to their security, consistent with US national security objectives and policies. It is the main area for United States counter-insurgency doctrine, although other nations, such as France and the United Kingdom, have carried out FID missions. The FM 3-24 Counterinsurgency, defines counterinsurgency as: In many respects, it is the mirror image of the US doctrine for guerrilla warfare, which in US Special Operations is called unconventional warfare: :::* To support or shape the environment for the larger conventional campaign, such as WWII Resistance operations conducted before the Normandy invasion :::* unilateral effort, generally conducted covertly, includes Afghanistan against the Soviets in the 1980s, and again in Afghanistan after the attacks of September 11, 2001. Effective FID and partnership FID exists only within a context of host nation (HN) internal defense and development (IDAD), where it can be a force multiplier for regional commanders concerned with counterinsurgency. Insurgencies today are more likely to be transnational than in the past. It has been a basic axiom that successful FID programs are real partnerships. According to Cordesman, a set of rules for establishing such partnerships include: # Real security dialogue at the bilateral and regional level means listening and last personal relationships. # Security cooperation should focus on security and stability, not political or social reform. Such efforts should recognize the legitimacy of different values and be the subject of a separate dialogue. # Build trust by clearly seeking friend or ally's security. # Focus on building local self-defense and deterrence capabilities, not presence or dependence. # Help friends and allies build forces in their own way; do not \\"mirror image.\\" # Recognize the reality that other nations define threats and allies differently from the U.S. # Arms sales must clearly benefit the buyer, not just the seller. # Ensure sustainability, capability to operate own forces in own way. # Responsive, time sensitive aid, deployment, sales, and transfers. Especially when the HN government, the insurgency, and the FID force come from different cultures, careful thought needs to be given both to the way the parties perceive the rules, and the ways the communicate their agreement to one another. Steven Metz, of the US Army Strategic Studies Institute, observed: Metz warns that the paradigm may have changed. > Insurgency matters today because it is linked to the phenomenon of > transnational terrorism. Insurgents have long used terrorism in the > operational sense, deterring those who supported the government and creating > an environment of violence and insecurity to erode public trust in the > regime. But now terrorism plays a strategic role as well. Insurgents can use > terrorism as a form of long-range power projection against outsiders who > support the government they are fighting. This could deter or even end > outside assistance. It is easy to imagine, for instance, that the already > fragile backing for American involvement in Iraq would erode even further if > the Iraqi insurgents launched attacks in the United States. Even more > important, an insurgent movement able to seize control of a state could > support transnational terrorists. The idea is that insurgents have > demonstrated an affinity for violence and extremism which would flavor their > policies if they came to power. He rejects the idea that transnational terrorism is uniquely Islamic. > It is less the chance of an insurgent victory which creates a friendly > environment for transnational terrorism than persistent internal conflict > shattering control and restraint in a state. During an insurgency, both the > insurgents and the government focus on each other, necessarily leaving parts > of the country with minimal security and control. Transnational terrorists > exploit this. And protracted insurgency creates a general disregard for law > and order. Organized crime and corruption blossom. Much of the population > loses its natural aversion to violence. Thus a society brutalized and > wounded by a protracted insurgency is more likely to spawn a variety of > evils, spewing violent individuals into the world long after the conflict > ends. Participants in FID programs No external force can guarantee success against an insurgency unless the people regard the Host Nation (HN) government as legitimate. Limited external support helped Ramon Magsaysay defeat the Hukbalahap insurgency in the Philippines, with one of the most important parts of that support being the availability of air transport so he could be visible in remote areas. The Vietnam War showed that even a superpower cannot make an unresponsive and corrupt government succeed against insurgents, especially when the superpower has significant conflict in its internal decisionmaking. An ineffective HN government guarantees the failure of counterinsurgency. The first part of this discussion discusses two parts of the \\"McCormick Magic Diamond\\" terms the \\"counterinsurgency force\\" (i.e., principally the HN government and closely aligned FID units) and the \\"international community\\" (i.e., nongovernmental organizations (NGO)) and other nation-states). =Diplomatic= There will almost always be a variety other participants, which can include friendly neighbor states, states sharing a coalition, and nongovernmental organizations. At the intergovernmental level, the highest decisions will be reached between diplomats at the HN foreign ministry or department of state, with the ambassadors of the nations providing FID being key players. The diplomatic level sets the highest policies. States that are generally strong still may need FID assistance for well-defined problems, especially problems where they lack skill and resources that they can, over time, acquire. For example, ASEAN is a Southeast Asian regional alliance including highly competent states such as Singapore. Nevertheless, they may need to develop additional resources ranging from port inspection to sea surveillance to advanced intelligence. =Nongovernmental organizations= The very conditions that may necessitate a stability operation or support operation‚Äîwidespread human suffering, population movements, famine, human rights violations, and civil war‚Äîare also the conditions that attract the services of nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and private voluntary organizations (PVO). A PVO is a subset of NGO, and is a tax-exempt nonprofit that leverages expertise and private funding to address development challenges abroad. To work with them effectively, HN and FID personnel need to understand that each organization or agency has a different mandate, set of capacities, organizational design, and cultural orientation. Some may prefer not to work with military organizations, or with the personnel of certain other NGOs or nations. NGOs and PVOs (as well as coalition partners) may require services from combat service support (CSS) units. The assistance may have been negotiated before the organization arrived in the area of operations, or the situation may create a sudden demand. Responsibilities may also include support of coalition members and representatives of NGOs. =Military= U.S. Army Special Forces soldier instructing Guyana Defence Force soldiers on air assault techniques. Western special operations forces are considered strategic assets with core missions including FID and UW. They may have other capabilities relevant to specific situations, such as demining. The United States Army Special Forces are among the most versatile organizations, but not all their capabilities may be needed for a specific FID situation. For example, the most urgent need might be for public health specialists or airfield construction crews, which operate on a level far beyond the medical or engineering specialists of a US Special Forces unit. Public health or construction organizations, however, have limited or no self-defense capability and will need protection in insecure areas. FID models There are multiple models of the strength and stability of nation-states, especially in the context of insurgency where they are detailed. Not all states need assistance to suppress insurgency, while in other cases, no external assistance is available. The latter was often the case when the insurgency was directed, by the native population, at a colonial power. A key part of a foreign internal defense (FID) mission is that its goal is to enable the nation and its institutions to move into the realm of those states that both provide for their citizens and interact constructively with the rest of the world. Two broad categories of country need at least some aspects of FID assistance. The obvious category is of weak and failed states, but there are also needs in generally strong states that face specific problems such as terrorism, piracy, and illegal drugs. This section includes a number of models that help recognize when either the preconditions for insurgency exist, or how insurgents are operating against the HN. Through the various models, the need for security of the population is mentioned most often; without security, it is difficult to impossible to deal with other problems causing instability, such as public health or economi The FID paradigm is inherently cooperative, with at least one nation helping strengthen the state. FID is a different approach than defense against external invasion or settling a major civil war. FID is never a quick process. The major power(s) uses nonmilitary and military means to increase the capability of the host nation (HN) to resist insurgency. FID includes the economic stabilization of host countries. =Myths and fallacies= The term Global War on Terror has been criticized, but there may be utility in examining a war not specifically on the tactic of terror, but in one or more, potentially cooperating insurgencies. \\"The utility of analyzing the war on terrorism using an insurgency/counterinsurgency conceptual framework. Additionally, the recommendations can be applied to the strategic campaign, even if it is politically unfeasible to address the war as an insurgency.\\" Cordesman points out some of the myths in trying to have a worldwide view of terror: * Cooperation can be based on trust and common values: One man's terrorist is another man's terrorist. * A definition of terrorism exists that can be accepted by all. * Intelligence can be freely shared. * Other states can be counted on to keep information secure, and use it to mutual advantage. * International institutions are secure and trustworthy. * Internal instability and security issues do not require compartmentation and secrecy at national level. * The \\"war on terrorism\\" creates common priorities and needs for action. * Global and regional cooperation is the natural basis for international action. * Legal systems are compatible enough for cooperation. * Human rights and rule of law differences do not limit cooperation. * Most needs are identical. * Cooperation can be separated from financial needs and resources. Social scientists, soldiers, and sources of change have been modeling insurgency for nearly a century, if one starts with Mao. Counterinsurgency models, not mutually exclusive from one another, come from Kilcullen, McCormick, Barnett and Eizenstat; see insurgency for the material that deals with factors that predispose toward insurgency. =Kilcullen's \\"Three Pillars\\"= Kilcullen Figure 1: Ecosystem of Insurgency Kilcullen gives a useful visual overview of an insurgency and counterinsurgency of the actors in the models, which generally agrees with a model represents home as a box defined by geographic, ethnic, economic, social, cultural, and religious characteristics. Inside the box are governments, counterinsurgent forces, insurgent leaders, insurgent forces, and the general population, which is made up of three groups: # those committed to the insurgents # those committed to the counterinsurgents # those who simply wish to get on with their lives. Kilcullen's Three Pillars The three pillar model repeats later as part of the gaps to be closed to end an insurgency. \\"Obviously enough, you cannot command what you do not control. Therefore, unity of command (between agencies or among government and non-government actors) means little in this environment.\\" Unity of command is one of the axioms of military doctrine change with the use of swarming:. In Edwards swarming model, as in Kilcullen's mode, unity of command becomes \\"unity of effort at best, and collaboration or deconfliction at least.\\" As in swarming, Kilcullen \\"depends less on a shared command and control hierarchy, and more on a shared diagnosis of the problem [i.e., the distributed knowledge of swarms], platforms for collaboration, information sharing and deconfliction. Each player must understand the others' strengths, weaknesses, capabilities and objectives, and inter-agency teams must be structured for versatility (the ability to perform a wide variety of tasks) and agility (the ability to transition rapidly and smoothly between tasks).\\" =McCormick's \\"Magic Diamond\\"= McCormick's \\"Magic Diamond\\" model often called Magic Diamond is designed as a tool for counterinsurgency, but develops a symmetrical view of the required actions for both the Insurgent and COIN forces to achieve success. In this way the counterinsurgency model can demonstrate how both the insurgent and COIN forces succeed or fail. The model's strategies and principle apply to both forces, therefore the degree the forces follow the model should have a direct correlation to the success or failure of either the Insurgent or COIN force. McCormick insurgency model The model depicts four key elements or players: # Insurgent force # Counterinsurgency force (i.e., the government) # Population # International community All of these interact, and the different elements have to assess their best options in a set of actions: # Gaining support of the population # Disrupt opponent's control over the population # Direct action against opponent # Disrupt opponent's relations with the international community # Establish relationships with the international community =Barnett's \\"connecting to the core\\"= In Thomas Barnett's paradigm, the world is divided into a \\"connected core\\" of nations enjoying a high level of communications among their organizations and individuals, and those nations that are disconnected internally and externally. In a reasonably peaceful situation, he describes a \\"system administrator\\" force, often multinational, which does what some call \\"nation- building\\", but, most importantly, connects the nation to the core and empowers the natives to communicate‚Äîthat communication can be likened to swarm coordination. If the state is occupied, or in civil war, another paradigm comes into play, which is generally beyond the scope of FID: the leviathan, a first-world military force that takes down the opposition regular forces. Leviathan is not constituted to fight local insurgencies, but major forces. Leviathan may use extensive swarming at the tactical level, but its dispatch is a strategic decision that may be made unilaterally, or by an established group of the core such as NATO or ASEAN. FID can grow out of the functioning of the \\"system administrator\\", be that a single dominant country (e.g., France in Chad), or with a multinational group such as ECOMOG, the military arm of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), in Sierra Leone. In the Sierra Leonian situation, the primary Leviathan was Great Britain, with Operation Barras, which involved special reconnaissance, direct action, and hostage rescue. =Eizenstat and closing gaps= Stuart E. Eizenstat gives a broad view of FID involve closing \\"gaps\\", some of which can be done by military advisors and even combat assistance, but, even more broadly, helping the Host Nation (HN) be seen as responsive. To be viable, a state must be able to close three \\"gaps\\", of which the first is most important: * Security ‚Äì Protection \\"against internal and external threats, and preserving sovereignty over territory. If a government cannot ensure security, rebellious armed groups or criminal nonstate actors may use violence to exploit this security gap‚Äîas in Haiti, Nepal, and Somalia.\\" * Capacity ‚Äì The most basic are the survival needs of water, electrical power, food and public health, closely followed by education, communications and a working economic system. \\"An inability to do so creates a capacity gap, which can lead to a loss of public confidence and then perhaps political upheaval. In most environments, a capacity gap coexists with‚Äîor even grows out of‚Äîa security gap. In Afghanistan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for example, segments of the population are cut off from their governments because of endemic insecurity. And in postconflict Iraq, critical capacity gaps exist despite the country's relative wealth and strategic importance.\\" * Legitimacy ‚Äì Closing the legitimacy gap is more than an incantation of \\"democracy\\" and \\"elections\\", but a government that is perceived to exist by the consent of the governed, has minimal corruption, and has a working law enforcement and judicial system that enforce human rights. Note the similarity between Eizenstat's gaps and Kilcullen's three pillars. =Cordesman and security= Other than brief \\"Leviathan\\" takedowns, security building appears to need to be regional, with logistical and other technical support from more developed countries and alliances (e.g., ASEAN, NATO). Noncombat military assistance in closing the security gap begins with training, sometimes in specialized areas such as intelligence. More direct, but still noncombat support, includes intelligence, planning, logistics and communications. Anthony Cordesman notes that security requirements differ by region and state in region. Writing on the Middle East, he identified different security needs for specific areas, as well as the US interest in security in those areas. * In North Africa, the US focus should be on security cooperation in achieving regional stability and in counterterrorism. * In the Levant, the US must largely compartment security cooperation with Israel and cooperation with friendly Arab states like Egypt, Jordan, and Lebanon, but can improve security cooperation with all these states. * In the Gulf, the US must deal with the strategic importance of a region whose petroleum and growing gas exports fuel key elements of the global economy. It is well to understand that counterterrorism, as used by Cordesman, does not mean using terrorism against the terrorism, but an entire spectrum of activities, nonviolent and violent, to disrupt an opposing terrorist organization. The French general, Joseph Gallieni, observed, while a colonial administrator in 1898, Both Kilcullen and Eizenstat define a more abstract goal than does Cordesman. Kilcullen's security pillar is roughly equivalent to Eizenstat's security gap: * Military security (securing the population from attack or intimidation by guerrillas, bandits, terrorists or other armed groups) * Police security (community policing, police intelligence or \\"Special Branch\\" activities, and paramilitary police field forces). * Human security, building a framework of human rights, civil institutions and individual protections, public safety (fire, ambulance, sanitation, civil defense) and population security. Anthony Cordesman, while speaking of the specific situation in Iraq, makes some points that can be generalized to other nations in turmoil. Cordesman recognizes some value in the groupings in Samuel P. Huntington's idea of the clash of civilizations, but, rather assuming the civilizations must clash, these civilizations simply can be recognized as actors in a multinational world. In the case of Iraq, Cordesman observes that the burden is on the Islamic civilization, not unilaterally the West, if for no other reason that the civilization to which the problematic nation belongs will have cultural and linguistic context that Western civilization cannot hope to equal. National problems and transnational spillover Developed and stable countries have their own reasons for helping HNs deal with insurgency, because insurgencies can have direct (e.g., terrorism, epidemic disease) or indirect (e.g., drug trade, economic instability in resources) effects on them. While ideological or religious terrorism is most frequently mentioned, it is, by no means, the only multinational problem that FID addresses, starting at the national level. When one of these problems is present in a state, it is likely to cause transnational \\"spillover effects\\". Problems include: * Blood diamonds * Illicit drugs * Piracy * Disease * Terrorism * Ethnic cleansing * Economic instability Not only HN, but regional conflicts threaten to widen gaps. \\"Pretending that the conflicts in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Darfur, Iraq, Palestine and Sri Lanka are the problems of others or are going to solve themselves is not a solution. Some states, especially in the ASEAN group, can be quite strong, but still have difficulties with piracy, terrorism, and drug traffic. There are a number of intelligence-sharing arrangements among countries in this area and the US FID assistance needs can involve economically strong countries in other regions. \\"Nigeria is among the top ten exporters of crude oil to the United States. ... when rebel leaders in the oil-rich Niger delta vowed to launch an \\"all-out war on the Nigerian state,\\" instability helped propel global oil prices to more than $50 per barrel. =Blood diamonds= Transnational criminal networks may use weak nations as sanctuaries for high-value, low-volume commodities such as diamonds FID forces may participate in identifying illegal \\"blood diamonds\\" that may be used to finance terrorism. Even more compact than drugs and easier to disguise, gem smuggling lends itself to air movement that may be detected with surveillance at the national or regional level. =Illicit drug trade= Drugs also are high-value and low-volume. When a country's legitimate government is weak compared to its drug trade infrastructure, part of FID may be defeating that infrastructure, or, minimally, reducing its ability to corrupt or destroy government institutions. The role of FID forces involves intelligence sharing, logistics and communications, assistance in planning operations, and training and equipping HN forces. Properly trained and equipped police and military forces can help close the security gap. Work with the World Health Organization and regional health groups work with the capacity gap. Regional HN operations to interdict drug traffickers, destroy labs and seize drugs helps close the legitimacy gap by reducing the bribery of local officials. Consistent with the restrictions on military organizations performing civilian law enforcement, such as the US Posse Comitatus Act, homeland and FID personnel can cooperate with partner nations (PN) in their counterdrug (CD) effort to disrupt the transport and/or transfer of illegal drugs into the US. Counterdrug (CD) is a high priority national security and international cooperation mission, with DOD functions and responsibilities based on statutory authority. The Armed Forces of the United States assist partner nations (PNs) in their CD efforts. Illicit drug trafficking, smuggling of every sort, and the regional and global movement of terrorists are closely linked by financial, political, and operational linkages. US military resources can be used as part of a counter-drug (CD) component of a FID program. While these are most often focused on supply, they also can be used to interfere with drug shipment. Since the United States Department of Defense is the lead government agency of the USG for the detection and monitoring (DM) of aerial and maritime transit of illegal drugs into the US, the DM mission is performed with regularly appropriated funds, notwithstanding the possibility of incidental benefit to the HN. Such activities may include nonconfrontational intercepts for intelligence or communication purposes and gathering and processing of tactical intelligence from a variety of sources, including fixed and mobile surveillance assets and certain intelligence sharing. In a CD support role (subject to national policy and legislative guidance) DOD may offer certain direct support to HN CD personnel, and certain enhanced support to US civilian law enforcement agencies that may be operating in the HN, and to the Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement of the United States Department of State. Without explicit direction from the Secretary of Defense, US forces engaged in CD activities may not engage in direct law enforcement activity. They may not directly participate in an arrest, search, seizure, or other similar activity. DOD personnel are not authorized to accompany HN forces on actual CD field operations or participate in any activities where hostilities are likely to occur. Other nations participating in the CD aspects of FID may operate under more permissive rules of engagement. =Piracy= Piracy is very real in the international waters of weak and failed states, such as Somalia. FID personnel may gather intelligence on pirate locations, and transmit this to warships able to intercept the pirate vessels. When pirates are active, providing FID supplies by water is impractical unless the transport vessels are armed, or travel in convoy. Piracy also may feed into security violations at ports, and as a means by which terrorists transport personnel and materials. An Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) study on the ownership and control of ships reports that anonymous ownership is more the rule than the exception. There are reports that 15 cargo ships are linked to al-Qaeda. =Disease= Bad health is a very real problem, especially from domestic conflict that displaces refugees across borders. HIV is the most obvious, especially in Africa, but it is not the only major concern. Military health specialists, as distinct from special operations forces, can have an enormous impact. Training and equipping health and education facilities are key FID capabilities. While Special Forces medical personnel can deliver clinic services and train local workers, there is an entire spectrum of ways to use FID to enhance public health. As one example, the US Navy's Medical Research Unit No. 3 has been active in Egypt since the Second World War. Located next to the Abbassia Fever Hospital, the oldest and largest fever hospital in the Middle East, it does research with Egyptian personnel and scientific clinicals throughout Africa and Southwest Asia. It works closely with the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population, the US National Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, the U.S Agency for International Development and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. NAMRU-3 is a WHO Collaborating Center for HIV and Emerging Infectious Diseases. =Terrorism= Organized transnational terrorists can flourish in weak states. A globally oriented group using terrorist methods can coexist with a local insurgency, or perhaps in the country that offers sanctuary to a border-crossing insurgency in a neighboring state. Developed country terrorism programs can benefit from FID in weak states, by strengthening those states, with due regard to human rights and the rule of law. FID can complement the global war on terrorism by reducing these contributing factors. The defensive measures of anti-terrorism (AT) and offensive counterterrorism efforts can be part of the FID program developed for a HN. Motivating states against global terrorist groups is, in the US, principally the responsibility of the Department of State. Effective FID programs, however, can improve public perceptions of both the HN and the country(ies) providing FID resources. and facilitate more active HN policies to combat terrorism. Military-to-military contacts can help make HN officials advocates of potential operations against terrorist capabilities. In many cases, measures increasing the capacity of a state to fight terrorism also will strengthen its overall IDAD program. These measures can include the following: # Developing the ability of the HN to track illicit financial transactions, break funding streams for criminal and insurgent groups, and prosecute their members. This may involve greater USHN cooperation in developing regulated financial institutions. See financial intelligence (FININT) # Ensuring that HN security personnel have access to appropriate equipment and training to conduct all phases of combating terrorism operations. # Training personnel at entry and exit points (including airports, seaports, and border crossings) to identify and apprehend individuals and materials being used by international terrorist groups. # Assisting HN security and intelligence agencies to be included into international networks that can share information on terrorist activities. # Developing effective judicial systems, and minimizing corruption and intimidation of HN officials. =Ethnic cleansing= FID specialists in Information Operations can help reduce the intensity of ethnic struggle. They have a range of techniques, from presenting things advantageous to all sides, to shutting down inflammatory propaganda outlets. Nonmilitary actions in closing gaps While the usual focus is on the military component of FID, the US FID joint doctrinal manual makes it clear that FID must be coordinated with all parts of a host government's scope. Doctrinally, the overall program should be under the United States Department of State, or equivalent Foreign Ministry for other countries' FID programs. In the sixties a presidentially appointed ambassador, otherwise known as chief of mission (COM), heads the embassy. But as multiple US agencies have moved into embassies over the years, the COM's authority has actually declined. Not many Army officers realize that COMs have little or no staff in the military sense; often they have little oversight of funds moving through other agencies in the embassy, and they have little or no planning capability, which sometimes leads to culture clashes with US military forces in country. More worrisome, under current rules COMs often have little to say about military operations in their countries, overpowered as they are by regional combatant command planning staffs and military teams that move in and out. Under President John F. Kennedy, COMs had explicit authority over Military Assistance Advisory Groups (MAAG), which were part of the ambassador's \\"country team.\\" That authority has disappeared over the years ... In the US context, many of these functions, when provided by government, are the responsibility of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), whose main missions are grouped as: * Global Development Alliance * Economic Growth, Agriculture, and Trade * Global Health * Democracy, Conflict, and Humanitarian Assistance. =Economic= There are at least two components of economic development: debt relief and new development. Most of the debt relief activity will be by nonmilitary personnel, other than perhaps an occasional audit. New development, however, can involve engineering and other relevant military skills. Not all models consider economics a key gap. The World Bank observes, however, that \\"low-income countries are about 15 times more susceptible to internal conflict than countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Helping poor nations to stabilize and diversify their economies‚Äîempowering them to fight poverty and meet popular expectations‚Äîmust be a vital facet of the developed and developing world's efforts to avoid state collapse. The role of trade, along with the issues of protecting nascent economic sectors, is a true challenge. \\"Agricultural trade disputes were a key issue in the stalled Doha Round. At the same time, the United States must unilaterally give poor countries access to its markets through initiatives such as the African Growth and Opportunity Act.\\" \\"The governments of major developing countries must play a large part in designing and carrying out new strategies. For proof, one need only look at the radically different international responses to the locally initiated New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) (which was embraced) and the Bush administration's Greater Middle East Initiative (which was not).\\" Reconfigured, the G-20 (i.e., members of the G8 and major emerging markets such as Brazil, India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa) could play a vital role in brokering consensus on a wide range of intractable political and security issues. The G-20 has already established itself as a key voice in global economic policy, and with an elevated profile it could address political and security affairs as well. Debt relief Especially poor nations are under a crushing debt load, and international organizations such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund have worked on debt relief, within a well-managed economic framework, to allow those countries to reallocate funds from debt service to development activities. Under this IMF program, 22 nations have shown sufficient development progress that they have passed the \\"completion point\\" at which lenders have agreed to forgive loans. Development Kilcullen's economic pillar includes: * near-term component of immediate humanitarian relief * longer-term programs for development assistance across a range of agricultural, industrial and commercial activities * assistance in effective resource and infrastructure management * construction of key infrastructure systems All these components need to be tailored to the HN capacity to absorb spending, as well as efforts to increase absorptive capacity, underpin other development activities. \\"One of the fundamental reasons for the US military's success in reacting to emergencies is its almost limitless supply of contingency funding. US development agencies have no comparable capacity. Congress should give the president a \\"country-in-transition\\" fund to finance unforeseen reconstruction or peacekeeping operations ... [the world needs] cohesive rapid response unit, a centralized pool of interagency experts on state building‚Äîthe rule of law, governance, and economic reform‚Äîtrained to work together and able to deploy rapidly, unencumbered by bureaucratic inertia, to crisis spots.\\" Language and cultural knowledge gaps alone mean that this cannot be a unilateral US operation. Military assistance Economic support can include the provision of foreign military financing under security assistance. Providing military equipment, however, must be done in a manner that the insurgents cannot exploit in their propaganda, calling the country or countries supporting the government \\"merchants of death\\" or the like. =Health= All special operations personnel have medical training beyond basic first aid, with the US Army Special Forces medical specialists closer to the paramedic or physician assistant levels. The engineering specialists often can construct wells and irrigation systems. Additional deployment of health services have, historically, proven to be a valuable low-risk asset to support FID programs. These are usually noncontroversial and cost-effective. The focus of such initiatives are not curative, but rather long-term developmental programs that are sustainable by the HN. These activities are targeted toward the health problems facing the HN military in conjunction with other US agencies, civilian health initiatives. While it can be entirely appropriate to provide medical supplies to local clinics, there have been cases where either local personnel diverted some of the supplies to the insurgents, or the insurgents expropriated them. The FID or HN health specialists should periodically audit medical supply inventory and compare them with health records, to see if use is consistent with the record. The records and supplies may differ for simply administrative reasons, which can become a teaching opportunity for medical records. When mass immunization programs are part of the health services in FID, it can be wise to avoid extreme measures to keep insurgents from receiving immunization. Increasing overall population immunity benefits all in the country, especially if the insurgency ends. In disaster situations, it also can provide long-term benefits not to check identification as closely as might be done in other situations. For countries that have had long civil wars or other conflicts that left a legacy of land mines, prosthetic services, regretfully, may be necessary‚Äîand leave long-term friendships. Agriculture and nutrition A lesson learned by accident came from the Marine Combined Action Platoons in Vietnam, where young Marines who came from 4-H Club farm competition turned out to be experts on animal husbandry. In some FID situations, there can be an enormous benefit, both for health through proper diet and for economic development, to bring in experts on sustainable agriculture, and resources that the local inhabitants can use independently, such as improved breeding stock. In a developing country, some approaches to improving agricultural productivity may have short-term benefits but long-term problems. Inappropriate use of antibiotics, as animal growth stimulants, both makes the local economy dependent on outside drug manufacturers, and also can increase bacterial resistance to treatment. Genetically modified seed that will not propagate itself also makes an agricultural economic sector dependent on indefinite outside assistance. Public health, research and advanced treatment Special operators, as well trained as they may be in community health, are not professional epidemiologists. A number of infectious diseases are increasing (see CIA transnational health and economic activities for projections), and, without aggressive prevention, may destroy developing economies. A critical FID role may be to bring the appropriate specialists where they are needed, and to give them physical security. A major worldwide goal of public health is eradication of infectious diseases, eradication being a technical term meaning that the disease is extinct in the wild, and may or may not exist in laboratories. One disease, smallpox, has been eradicated, and that took close to 200 years. Eradication of other diseases, however, is closer, and mass immunization programs as part of FID may be a major tool. Trained FID and HN personnel also may be able to identify and quarantine sporadic cases. Polio, for example, is close to being the second disease, after smallpox, to being eradicated. It is endemic in three countries: Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan, but has been eliminated from Europe, the Americas, the Western Pacific (including China), India and Australia. Apparently, a Nigerian strain managed to get into Sudan, and appeared in displaced persons camps in Kenya. FID operations In cooperation with the HN, the FID organization needs to define its initial set of operations, accepting that needs will change over time. No single operational plan will fit all HN environments, and it is wise to consider the various counterinsurgency models and see if the proposed plan will work to fill the identified gaps, weaknesses, and disconnection A representative set of steps for the FID force is: # Security Operations ‚Äì \\"The first priority for any government facing an insurgency is to establish a secure environment.\\" The FID force role will vary here. The HN government has the greatest credibility when it can conduct these operations, respecting human rights, on its own. # Gain Popular Support ‚Äì \\"Gaining and maintaining the support of the population is the overall goal and path to victory since the population is the center of gravity, therefore it is imperative for long-term success that the population views the government as legitimate. It is equally important for the US effort to be viewed as legitimate versus being viewed as an occupier or supporting a puppet government.\\" # Gain International Support ‚Äì \\"It is also important for the government's internal defense efforts to be legitimized, accepted and supported by the international community.\\" The more the military and nonmilitary FID organization is multinational, the easier it may be to gain this support. # Defeat Insurgents ‚Äì \\"If done correctly, the first three lines should de-legitimize the insurgents and lead to their lasting defeat. This line will attack the hard-core insurgents. Some may succumb to offers of amnesty, but most will need to be killed or captured through offensive operations.\\" Again, it is most desirable HN personnel do this. # Develop Host Nation Internal Security ‚Äì Internal security forces, such as local and national police forces, key facility protection corps, diplomat security personnel, coast guard, criminal investigation, paramilitary forces for counterinsurgency, local and national level special weapons and tactics capabilities will be necessary to defeat the internal threat as a law enforcement matter.\\" If coalition combat forces have been used, \\"as the internal security forces are trained, the coalition will transition to only protecting the nation from external threats until such a time as the actual national military force is trained, equipped, and can conduct unilateral operations.\\" Cordesman points out that military force, used to excess, may be worse for the long-term situation than not engaging the insurgents at all. When a shell leaves the barrel of a cannon, its effects may be more than physical; it may explode into \\"real time political and media dimension, \\"Effects based warfare\\" depends on political effect, not just military ones. Tactical victories can be meaningless without political, ideological, information, and media dominance. Especially in areas of high population density, civilian casualties, collateral property damage, and injuries from \\"friendly fire\\" can have enormous political effects. Operations in civilian areas are steadily more political and sensitive. Their planning must include politically and culturally appropriate solutions for interrogations, detainees, and prisoners. In both the city and country, HN troops will be closer allies if they have the same protection and undergo the same risks as the FID troops. This can present difficulties when FID personnel are forbidden from combat operations, but there is a very delicate line between live-fire training and combat. Another important morale issue is that the HN feels that the FID personnel share the risk with them, with both having equivalent force protection and risk in assignments. =Planning staff= HNs vary greatly in the extent of their experience as professional military staff. Insurgents also may have well-trained staff. One of the key roles of a staff is avoiding mission creep. While the top leadership may have a vision of a desired outcome, one of the staff responsibilities is examining the practicality of that vision. Staff officers may be able to convert a vision of the future into a realistically phased plan to reach that future objective. Mission creep can develop in different ways, with the inappropriate planning coming from outside or inside the FID units. Either the HN or the FID force may see great human suffering, and want to relieve it. Rushing into action can \\"interfere with impartiality as well as undermine long-term programs.\\" One type happens when the units receive missions for which they were not trained or equipped. For example, in Somalia, the original UN force was established for humanitarian services and limited peacekeeping. Without obtaining additional resources judged needed by the on-scene commanders and staff, they took on a peace enforcement mission. With the best of intentions, a unit may take on more than is allowed in the current mandate and mission. \\"An example would be if a commander directed execution of civil action projects that fall outside his authority. Rebuilding structures, training local nationals, and other activities may be good for the local population, but they may be beyond the mandate and mission. At the same time, FID and HN commanders need to recognize when they lack critical resources, or if their rules of engagement are inadequate for a rapidly developing situation. When the on-scene UN commander in Rwanda, Gen. Romeo Dallaire asked UN headquarters for freedom to act, it was denied due to the interpretation of UN resolutions. Hindsight is always easy, but the catastrophe that took place might have been averted had Dallaire been able to carry out certain actions, including disabling or destroying of broadcast facilities used for inflammatory propaganda, as was done early in Bosnia. =Infrastructure= It is fruitless to do detailed planning for things not within the capabilities of the HN and FID organization. For example, plans that call for the placement of forces not accessible by roads, or where the roads are unsafe, will not be practical unless the forces can reach their destinations by air or water. When air or water movement is needed, there need to be aircraft or watercraft, as well people and equipment for maintaining them. There may need to be navigational aids on the course or at the destination, or one of the first requirements is planning to install them. Especially with air transport, there either must be a means of refueling aircraft along the path or at the destination. If there is no refueling capability at the destination, the aircraft must cut into their cargo capacity so that they carry enough fuel for the return trip; this is a serious limitation on transport flights from Lagos, Nigeria to El Fasher airport in Darfur, Sudan. =Legitimacy and government= In the gap model, closing the legitimacy gap provides a framework for constructive HN activity. Kilcullen calls this gap the political pillar. By whatever legitimacy comes when \\"ensuring that rule of law to protect property and the right of the public ... move towards some form of centrist, moderate political pluralism. A legitimate government has to close all three gaps. Leaders for life, hereditary presidents, one party systems, and monarchies with captive political parties or none, all help breed extremism\\"; extremism flourishes when gaps widen. Kilcullen measures success in this area by the amount of support that is visibly mobilized by \\"takeholders in support of the government,\\" [marginalizing] opposition outside the law..[and] further the rule of law. A key element is the building of institutional capacity in all agencies of government and non-government civil institutions, and social re-integration efforts such as the disarming, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) of combatants.\\" Disarming, demobilization and reintegration: end state Disarming can have enormous symbolism, as with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning in Northern Ireland. There may well be situations where an insurgency will not hand over its arms to the government, but will accept face-saving measures such as having a third party verify that the weapons are no longer a threat. Reintegration may mean that people perceived as having been involved in violence still can reenter the political process. Like the security pillar for military forces, the political pillar is the principal arena for diplomatic and civil governance assistance efforts ‚Äî although, again, civil agencies play a significant role in the security and economic pillars also. \\"Transparency‚Äîin a developing government's decision- making, its allocation of budgetary funds, and its administration of the rule of law‚Äîmust also be promoted. Perceived transparency and the reduction of corruption were key to the success of Ramon Magsaysay in creating a viable government in the Philippines. That El Salvador and Nicaragua are negotiating free trade agreements is another mark of success. Limits to intervention This section bears the title of Townsend Hoopes' best-known book. In 2004, of a seminar that brought a group of Muslim students to the US, he observed \\"A vital point here is that the realities of modernity (technical, social, political) are inexorable. They cannot be wished away, which means that traditional societies are faced with a crucial choice: to adjust, to adapt or to risk steady decline and perhaps ultimate disappearance. Given this daunting paradigm, the genuine enthusiasm for America shown by our 21 Muslim guests was a heartening sign. They seemed impressed with the depth of our national commitment to human freedom and individual opportunity, and the stability of our institutions, both governmental and private. Several declared that exposure to America had reinforced their determination to work for social change in their own countries. Two Pakistani women, both law students, said they planned to devote their lives to fighting for broader women's rights at home. One young man said it was his ambition to become his country's prime minister. No matter how strongly a Leviathan may wish to do so, it \\"cannot simply avoid or wish away dealing with local elites, for ultimately their actions, not those of the [external power], will strengthen or undermine institutions. Money, especially money given to governments for their help against an external enemy, cannot buy legitimacy.\\" At the height of the Cold War, US foreign aid went to dictators perceived helpful in the fight against communism, but doing little to promote broad-based development. Anti-Soviet activities in Afghanistan left it in a civil war. The failure of the French and other nations to question the 1955 State of Vietnam referendum left a Southern government without widely perceived legitimacy, and a Northern government with authoritarian rule but a certain degree of public support. \\"The bloody civil war consumed Afghanistan, paving the way for the Taliban and al Qaeda to take control of the government ... In attempting to end foreign conflicts quickly, policymakers must avoid planting the seeds of future instability ... developed state policymakers must be candid about the long- term nature of the state-building enterprise. This may seem politically unpalatable, but there is no excuse for launching limited engagements in countries mired in political and economic chaos. If the United States [or any external power] cannot sustain its engagement, it would do better not to intervene at all. Where a problem involves economics, such as drugs in Latin America or diamonds in West Africa, other nations and civilizations have to work on the demand side, rather than requiring the HN to destroy what may have become an integral part of its economy. Legitimacy is culturally defined Neither isolation nor indulgence alone can meaningfully affect an elite's stance. A \\"tough love\\" toward elites may be needed to have them accept responsibility while increasing a culturally appropriate model of public participation. Elites in the weak nations world must recognize they cannot survive without contributing to the building of sustainable civil societies. While its long-term effect has yet to be determined, Afghans for a Civil Society demonstrates some potentially relevant principles. Its focus is on \\"community empowerment and citizens to play a greater role in determining Afghanistan's destiny. ACS is committed to increasing public participation in the decision-making process through democracy building, policy development and independent media.\\" ACS put its headquarters not in Kabul, the national capital, but in Kandahar, the Taliban stronghold when they were in control. Cordesman uses much the same argument as Eizenstat's legitimacy gap by saying \\"Algeria, Egypt, and Syria have already shown that \\"long wars\\" fought on this basis may bring the threat under partial control but cannot defeat it. If the US has pushed too hard, too quickly, and sometimes for the wrong thing, the Islamic leader that tries to defeat Islamic extremism by blocking or delaying reform, or making concessions to Islamic extremism, is guilty of committing self-inflicted wounds to his own faith and country‚Äîa failure far worse than any failure by Western states.\\" When a society suffers terrorism, it needs to recognize its own responsibilities, rather than shifting blame to outside groups. In no way does this absolve groups from committing acts of terror, but the FID paradigm recognizes that completed acts of terrorism widen the security gap; the Marxist guerrilla theoretician Carlos Marighella specifically aimed at the security gap. FID is intended both to assist the HN in developing direct measures to prevent and mitigate acts, but it also recognizes that the HN needs to carry out information operations that show the acts to be contrary to the general interests of the population. \\"To be credible in such messages, the HN government, as well as other policy influencers such as clerics, educators, politicians and media, need to condemn the acts while recognizing grievances ... They ultimately will be more important than internal security forces and counterterrorism campaigns. \\" Note that counterterrorism differs from counterterror, the latter being the use of terrorist methods against the insurgents. See Is there a role for counterterror?. Even though Barnett speaks of problem nations as disconnected from the core, even failed states have some access to electronic communications, which means that the HN needs to respond quickly to the messages and claims of responsibility issues with attacks ...\\"Steady progress towards meeting popular needs and goals is equally important. Such progress may often be slow, and change will normally have to be evolutionary. But it must be a constant and publicly credible pursuit that leaders are seen to push forward. Extremists have capitalized on the dissatisfaction on the \\"street\\" with their economic, political, and economic situation‚Äîthe steady decay of public services, corruption, and the narrow distribution of income. The West must also understand that Western institutions cannot be transplanted into a social context for which they were not defined. Western observers also must understand that even fair elections, if the elected government cannot close gaps, are moot. The elites, therefore, need to envision the form of legitimacy that works in their culture. Many Asian societies, for example, are more concerned with common social goals than Western individualism. When the problem is radical Islam, the West must reinforce local reform efforts and avoid being seen as meddling in countries' internal affairs by supporting secular over religious Islamists, driving reform from the outside, or trying to change the Islamic character of Islamic countries.\\" Terrorism can never be totally eliminated as a tactic, but the ideology that drives organizations like Al-Qa'ida can be discredited and isolated. Support for extremism is still extremely marginal in weak nations. Terrorists killing innocent civilians have tarred the image of their broader civilization, and have destroyed the livelihood of nations like Iraq and Afghanistan. Poll after poll has shown that people in the Muslim worlds want moderate alternatives to the status quo, if their political, religious, and intellectual leaders will actually provide them.\\" It is no accident that groups such as Hezbollah provide social services, with a message that the HN government cannot. Role of counterterrorism One of the challenges to a government intending to be seen as legitimate is the extent to which it can use what is often counterterror: selective assassination. This is not a black-and-white choice, as in the WWII examples of Reinhard Heydrich and Isoroku Yamamoto. Both were uniformed and identifiable, but Yamamoto was a member of the military while Heydrich was a government official. Lynn asks, \\"In a struggle for legitimacy founded on justice, can a government execute its opponents without trial? That was what assassination of insurgent leaders amounted to in El Salvador and Vietnam.\\" In a counterinsurgency situation, the perception of the government (i.e., McCormick's CF) violating the human rights of the population causes Eisenstat's legitimacy gap to widen. The Phoenix program in South Vietnam was criticized for a lack of precision in its targeting, and caused a further loss in legitimacy of the government, regardless of the damage done to the Viet Cong infrastructure. Marighella recommended that urban guerillas deliberately provoke the government into overreaction, as a means of reducing its legitimacy; the doctrine of having FID trainers counsel respect for human rights has pure military, not just humanitarian, justification. With strong intelligence, there may be a justification for targeted killing of clearly identified leaders and key specialists. When governments go farther into terror and torture, however, experience has shown that its effect rebounds both on their legitimacy and onto their personnel.A year after Trinquier, Chalmers Ashby Johnson agreed that \\"counter-terror\\" theory was based on an erroneous premise ‚Äî that guerrillas achieve support through acts of terrorism ‚Äî and stated that theorists cannot produce \\"a single case in which the principle of counter-terrorization has been effective in ending a guerrilla war. In fact, Such counter-measures can easily be shown to have quite the opposite result.\\" The American Connection, Vol. 1, State Terror and Popular Resistance in El Salvador (1985) Population and Resource Control One important element of a legitimate government is to gain control over the population and resources of the country. The US Special Forces Counterinsurgency Manual states that US Special Forces can advise and assist the host nation using the following control measures: * Security Forces (see Direct Combat Role). * Restrictions ‚Äì \\"Rights on the legality of detention or imprisonment of personnel (for example, habeas corpus) may be temporarily suspended. This measure must be taken as a last resort, since it may provide the insurgents with an effective propaganda theme.\\" * Legal considerations ‚Äì \\"In countries where government authorities do not have wide latitude in controlling the population ... emergency legislation may include a form of martial law permitting government forces to search without warrant, to detain without bringing formal charges, and to execute other similar actions.\\" The US SF Counterinsurgency Manual also heavily references psychological operations (PSYOP) as a means to make FID acceptable to the general population of the host nation \\"by relating the necessity of controls to their safety and well- being.\\" The aim of PSYOP during FID operations is to increase the perceived legitimacy of the foreign presence and of the host government. Indirect military support operations Indirect support operations emphasize the principle of HN self-sufficiency. \\"Indirect support focuses on building strong national infrastructures through economic and military capabilities that contribute to self-sufficiency. FID personnel contribute to indirect support through security cooperation guidance, delivering through security assistance (SA), supplemented by multinational exercises, exchange programs, and selected joint exercises. =Troop equipping and training= FID personnel need to be prepared to deliver training to a wide range of HN personnel, from graduates of first world staff and war colleges, to highly trained special operations forces (SOF) to those totally untrained in the specific area where the FID program is located. Training delivery can include institutional training (including exchanges among national military colleges), on-the-job training, and unit-conducted individual and collective training will be required. Those who deliver training must exemplify both military skills and cultural sensitivity. While one's own country might consider searching after-action reviews a recognized learning experience, such techniques are counterproductive in countries where even one-on-one direct criticism is insulting, and even more so if criticism is delivered in front of third parties. Especially in intelligence and psychological operations, the FID and HN personnel should recognize they can learn from one another. =Logistics= In the absence of specific enabling legislation or orders, logistic support operations are limited by US law and usually consist of transportation or limited maintenance support. Other nations will have their own policies, but any FID force needs to avoid making the HN dependent on it for logistical services that the HN could do. Some HNs are sufficiently wealthy to be able to hire foreign contractors, but this practice also should be avoided. Highly skilled contractors may be useful as trainers, but their long-term use does not encourage the HN building its own set of skills. Third-country nationals also may present a security problem. There can be times, however, where the country or countries providing FID resources can make an enormous difference at a key time, as, for example, with heavy airlift or sealift. For example, while US troops are not on the ground in Darfur, African Union peacekeepers are being flown from Kigali, Rwanda and Abuja, Nigeria by US transport aircraft. =Information operations= There is a strong emphasis on guiding the HN to do psychological operations, not simply to keep the noncombat role of the foreign force, but also the reality that HN personnel will understand language and cultural nuances far better than foreigners. For example, a very effective leaflet during Operation Desert Storm was distasteful and even offensive to many Americans, because they showed men walking while holding hands \\"The Arabs loved them as they showed the solidarity of the soldiers, hand in hand.\\" To have Arab men hold hands symbolizes friendship, not any sexual message that Americans perceived. For propaganda used in FID, there are multiple audiences, often with different perspectives. The wrong leaflet or broadcast sent to the wrong group can be counterproductive. In US FID doctrine, targets are identified as: # Insurgents ‚Äì \\"Create dissension, disorganization, low morale, subversion, and defection within insurgent forces, as well as help discredit them.\\" A leaflet intended to strengthen the resolve of HN military forces might be perceived as demonstrating weakness of the latter vis-a-vis the insurgents. # Civilian populace ‚Äì \\"Gain, preserve, and strengthen civilian support for the HN government and its counterinsurgency programs.\\" Too strong a military emphasis, regarding actions of either side, can be frightening. # Military forces ‚Äì Strengthen military support, with emphasis on building and maintaining the morale of the HN forces. \\"Avoid anything that can be turned against HN forces by insurgents.\\" # Neutral elements ‚Äì \\"Gain the support of uncommitted groups inside and outside the HN.\\" # External hostile powers ‚Äì \\"Convince hostile foreign [groups] the insurgency will fail.\\" Direct military support not involving combat operations External military forces assigned to FID can provide direct support not involving combat operations. Where security assistance is funded from outside the military, such direct support is funded by the FID-providing nation's military budget, generally do not involve providing equipment, and may not involve direct training of the host country's forces by the nation providing FID assistance. The external nation may train internal trainers, and work with the host nation in civil-military operations. Civil-military operations, under the FID model, include providing services to the local population. Jointly providing such services indirectly trains the local military in skills including logistics, preventive and reactive medicine, communications, and intelligence operations. Realistically, the FID force will retain some self-defense capability, although geopolitical considerations may make that quite low-profile. Direct support (not involving combat operations) involve the use of US forces providing direct assistance to the HN civilian populace or military. They differ from SA in that they are joint- or Service- funded, do not usually involve the transfer of arms and equipment, and do not usually but may include training local military forces. Direct support operations are normally conducted when the HN has not attained self- sufficiency and is faced with social, economic, or military threats beyond its capability to handle. Assistance will normally focus on civil-military operations (primarily, the provision of services to the local populace), psychological operations, communications and intelligence sharing, and logistic support. The decision to conduct US combat operations in FID operations is the President's and serves only as a temporary solution until HN forces are able to stabilize the situation and provide security for the populace. In all cases, US combat operations support the HN IDAD program and remain strategically defensive in nature. =Communications= Some countries have essentially no communications infrastructure, and may need basic fixed- station to fixed-station radio, all the way up to secure mobile communications. In many situations, by adding communications security features to the military sites, a new or upgraded telephone system, including cellular telephony, can meet many non-combat military requirements. Portable, robust communications are needed for military ground operations. There will also be needs for air to ground and air-to-air communications. When operating with multinational coalitions, or with foreign nation intelligence systems, the appropriate HN personnel will need communications interoperable with those systems. =Intelligence= The goal of intelligence sharing is to make the HN independent. Clearly, not every HN can afford space-based systems and other advanced, expensive technology. Advanced technologies, for security reasons, may not be appropriate to make available, in raw form, to third countries. Decisions on what can be shared and should be shared will involve the HN, the FID nation(s) country teams, the relevant combatant command, and the intelligence community. When sensitive intelligence is provided, appropriate security needs to be in place, involving counterintelligence, other relevant security, and police organizations of all the relevant nations. Counterintelligence elements can provide this support with HN military counterintelligence elements, security service, and police forces when deployed in support of FID operations. Early in the relationship, FID personnel, including appropriate specialists, will evaluate the HN intelligence capability, including appropriate secure communications, and recommend an architecture and implementation plan. Training in planning and executing intelligence operations can be provided. Urban intelligence issues Marighella speaks of the urban environment as being as or more concealing than the jungle. Walls, roofs, and other structural features interrupt line-of-sight (LOS) and make overhead imagery of less value in urban areas than in others. Such barriers preclude penetration by many sensors. There may be a limited capability provided by advanced thermal sensors, and, if available, penetrating radar, typically from airborne or spaceborne senseors that are not readily available. What is in the open or under visible camouflage nets elsewhere is completely hidden within structures during urban contingencies (i.e., defeating conventional imagery intelligence IMINT) Further, movement of units is less frequently evident. Well-trained organizations minimize exterior activities; their soldiers remain within buildings to the maximum extent possible to reduce detection. Vehicles leave few signs of their passage on asphalt and concrete, unlike in other areas where their tracks can be seen in dirt or compressed foliage. The same LOS obstacles that interfere with friendly force communications block signal- collection efforts. The city foe will in some in stances employ local telephone systems, cellular networks, or other communications systems for which friendly force military SIGINT capabilities were not designed. Such challenges mean that intelligence analysis during urban contingencies relies more on human intelligence (HUMINT) than is the norm. Combat service support (CSS) units are among the most dispersed and omnipresent in any area of operations, their soldiers are potentially valuable HUMINT collectors. Guards assigned to specific posts will quickly become very familiar with the area around their posts and the routines associated with that terrain. CSS drivers, men and women manning water purification sites, and others with frequent noncombatant contact should all receive training as intelligence collectors. They need to know their intelligence reporting responsibilities and have, consistent with security, a good idea of their command's intelligence requirements. These may be new ideas for even the combat service support troops of major powers, but it may be essential to teach the HN's personnel as well. Such training will consume resources, but is necessary, as is training CSS headquarters personnel when to pass information to the intelligence staff. Reports will have to be monitored, compiled, consolidated, and disseminated to not only intelligence nodes but also operational units with an immediate need to see specific items. The inordinate reliance on HUMINT magnifies the role of the CSS soldier as intelligence collector during urban operations. Neither the benefits nor the costs have heretofore been fully recognized Human rights and HUMINT When the intelligence support involves HUMINT, human rights education must be given, and FID personnel are required to report abuses. Intelligence sharing Where drugs or other materials are shipped by air, radar systems, both ground- and air-based, while powerful, are relatively straightforward to provide. The actual radar need not be operated by the HN or even in their country; the radar can send its information to a remote intelligence center. More difficult are situations where the countries asking for support, such as ASEAN and allies both can offer sensitive HUMINT, but want to exchange for SIGINT from the US or allies such as Australia. These exchanges can be immensely valuable, but both sides may feel the need to sanitize detailed sources. =Aviation support= One of the more challenging FID roles is that of aviation, given that the US Air Force has long emphasized strategic attack and the de-emphasis of airpower's supporting functions have contributed to a doctrinal void regarding airpower's role in counterinsurgency. Four airpower functions define the broad scope of airpower's role in fighting insurgents and terrorists, three of which can be noncombat: * air mobility ‚Äì Often extremely valuable, but on the edge of combat operations when HN personnel are flown to a combat zone. * intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) * information operations (IO) ‚Äì Not just broadcasts and leaflet drops, but air transport of government officials to remote areas can be used to improve HN information dissemination efforts and to provide a strong symbol of government legitimacy and resolve. For instance, the Philippine secretary of defense during the Huk rebellion, Ramon Magsaysay, frequently traveled by air to visit remote barrios and frontline units to boost morale and inform the public of new government reform policies. Air mobility can transport specialists and technicians to remote areas in order to provide on-site training and assistance in areas such as public services management, medical care, sanitation and hygiene, agriculture, and school administration. Furthermore, air mobility can be used to transport construction equipment, supplies, and personnel to remote areas in support of public works programs such as housing construction, power generation, and transportation infrastructure improvements. In addition, air mobility can address political alienation and disenfranchisement by extending the electoral process to outlying areas. * counterland ‚Äì close air support would fall into the combat operations category. Direct combat role Deciding to extend FID to direct combat against an internal foe is made at the highest level of government of the country providing the FID personnel, and in keeping with that country's laws. The first levels of such a role could still be limited to logistics, intelligence, communications, and other combat support and combat service support roles that free the host nation forces to do the actual fighting. Combat operations may be authorized that are limited to force protection, advising or leading combat operations as on-the-job training, and, very selectively, independent operations. Within the scope of independent operations may be low-intensity operations such as special reconnaissance. Direct action might be authorized to stop immediate terrorist threats, possibly to the country providing FID, or to neutralize WMD. Depending on the potential infiltration of the HN forces, the FID force might keep control of heavy weapons, combat aircraft, and other sensitive, potent hardware. Historically, one of the first missions for special operations forces was unconventional warfare (UW), or training and leading guerrillas in occupied countries. In WWII, this was a mission of the UK-US-French Jedburgh teams in occupied Europe. Shortly after the end of the war, US and UK advisors worked with Greek and Turkish forces. After the war, and the organization of US Army Special Forces, the first deployments went to Europe to operate guerrillas when the expected Warsaw Pact invasion overran Europe. See History below for French, British, and US developments after World War II. =Fire support= If FID forces take part in combat, one of their first activities tends to be teaching HN personnel how to call for close air support and artillery fires. The actual fire may come from HN or FID resources, or a combination. One of the reasons that fire direction is a priority is that experienced FID personnel will avoid firing at unknown targets, or firing at insurgents using civilian shields. Free-fire zones, such as used in Vietnam, can produce new insurgents faster than killing old ones. =Air interdiction and precision strikes= There is little place for air interdiction in fighting a local insurgency, in the most common sense of interrupting lines of supply. Only when the insurgents are being supplied from across a border, or at least from a remote area of sanctuary in the country, does this make sense. In the case, for example, of the Ho Chi Minh trail, any useful level of interdiction required either high-risk direct observation by special reconnaissance troops, or, in some cases, airborne sensors, such as the Vietnam-Era \\"Black Crow\\", which detected the \\"static\\" produced by the ignition system of trucks on the Ho Chi Minh trail, from distances up to 10 miles. The coordination of human reconnaissance or unmanned remote sensors, with strike aircraft, missiles, or artillery, and avoiding collateral damage, requires advanced military skills. Such skills may not be within the repertoire of a weak nation, and the difficult political decision becomes whether the FID nation should undertake such strikes. Stronger states, especially when the insurgency is largely external, may be able to carry out such operations, but they, too, face a political problem: the potential \\"blowback\\" if the attack the territory of another nation. With the advent of precision guided munitions that can be directed onto a specific target, it may be reasonable to use air attack against isolated command posts or other high-value facilities away from civilian areas. The combination of highly accurate, small weapons such as the Small Diameter Bomb, or even bombs without explosive filler, may be a wise way to attack specific, well-identified and difficult to reach targets. The skills necessary for identifying the target and guiding weapons to it, however, may not be something HN personnel have the experience to do. =Special reconnaissance= While special reconnaissance always runs the danger of coming into combat situations, there may be situations, in an FID situation, where intelligence on some key adversary installation is essential, but the necessary ground observations can be made only by specialists. Perhaps the HN can carry out a conventional amphibious landing, but do not have people trained or equipped for beach mapping, evaluating defenses, etc., by night. In such cases, when less risky alternatives such as air or space reconnaissance have been exhausted, the FID nation might lead a team in such a mission. When the HN has qualified people, perhaps who have trained in the FID home country, but not the equipment, they can join in such an operation. It may be highly desirable, while a sensitive operation is in progress, to have the HN conduct distracting operations. The knowledge of the sensitive operation must be tightly held, and most of the troops carrying out the distraction‚Äîwhich ideally has a result more than mere distraction‚Äîwill not know why they are taking a particular action. Another example is where HN personnel guide a successful rescue effort in denied area, as Nguyen Van Kiet did with a United States Navy SEAL companion, Thomas R. Norris behind enemy lines. Norris received the US Medal of Honor for his part of the mission. =Direct action and unconventional warfare= When the FID force takes direct action, or leads UW forces, it needs a clear reason to do so. Jones cites some examples as: # Operations against Rogue, Hostile Regimes or State Sponsors of Terrorism‚Äîa proven operational concept having been used twice since 11 September in Afghanistan and Iraq. These operations will either be the decisive or shaping operation depending on the political sensitivity of the target country. # Operations against what will be referred to in this study as al Qa'ida states (AQ States) in which al Qa'ida is able to overthrow one or more of the regimes within the boundary of the 7th century caliphate. Unconventional warfare would be used to overthrow these regimes. # Operations in failed states when there is no effective government, but an element within the population, such as a tribe or ethnic group, is the State for all intents and purposes. In this case unconventional warfare will be used to overthrow this State. =Conventional ground operations= This category does not include defense against external invasion by nation-state forces. It can, however, include operations against rebel conventional forces, guerillas in large strength, and insurgent bases. =Naval surveillance and patrol= A FID force can patrol international and coastal waters, perhaps using sensors not available to the HN. The surveillance vessels, aircraft, UAVs, etc. can guide the HN action without violating their own rules of engagement and participating in unauthorized direct combat. History Rather than the formal definition, it is more understandable with some historical context. The British generally seemed to be most consistent between theory and practice, although the minimum-effort theory, which worked in Malaya, did not seem to apply to Northern Ireland. French doctrine at the turn of the 20th century, involving working with locals, did not seem to be the heart of doctrine in Algeria and Indochina. France does seem to manage cooperation with former colonies, now clients. US doctrine for Special Forces stayed consistent at the tactical level, but frequently failed at higher levels by dealing with unpopular governments; the Philippines were the greatest success. =United Kingdom= The UK tends to see the FID mission more as a capability of regular forces than special operations forces, at the lowest level of intensity possible.McClintock-2005 In 1934, Sir Charles W. Gwynn described the goal as \\"the restoration of order through the use of minimum force.\\" Sir Robert Thompson, who successfully defeated the Malayan insurgency, \\"stressed tough administration, population control, and adherence to law. Decried use of high intensity military force or dirty tricks.\\" Sir Frank Kitson, former commander of UK land forces, said practical counterinsurgency had nothing \\"special\\" about it, but was mainstream British Army. Of course, there was significant use of the Special Air Service and other specialist units such as 14 Intelligence Company in Northern Ireland. According to McClintock, the base of UK doctrine was: * Population control through strong civil and military administrative structures. * Strong foundation in law enforcement as tool and source of legitimacy. * Emphasis upon the primacy of intelligence. * Only limited role for elite commando-style strike force. During the Malayan emergency, for example, the British Royal Air Force made extensive use of helicopters and fixed-wing transports to insert light infantry and Special Air Service units deep into the jungle, keeping them supplied by air for extended periods. These \\"deep-penetration\\" patrols were a key factor in defeating the Malayan insurgent forces in the more remote areas of the country =United States=  Post WWII to Vietnam  US Army Special Forces' original mission was to train and lead guerrillas in a nation occupied by another: \\"[US Special Forces provided] advisory personnel and mobile training teams to advise, train and provide operational assistance for paramilitary forces.\\"US Army Counterinsurgency Forces, FM 31-22, 1963. Cited in America's Other War by Doug Stokes (2005) The most likely case, at the time Special Forces were created, would be to lead resistance groups in European countries overrun by the expected Soviet Bloc attack. Over time, the term guerrilla warfare, especially led by Americans, fell into disfavor, and unconventional warfare took its place. A November 1947 United States Department of the Army memorandum entitled A Study of Special and Subversive Operations was an early assessment of the lessons learned from World War II in the context of Cold War imperatives. In the only point in the memorandum concerning counter-guerrilla operations, the authors point to the German example: In the early 1950s, the Department of the Army's Military History Division published a number of studies, the \\"German Report Series\\", which were devised to glean lessons from the German World War II experience. Some studies in the series were written by former German generals and general staff officers.German Defense Tactics Against Russian Breakthroughs , Historical Study, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., Pamphlet 20-233 (German Report Series). The publications among other issues also analyzed the German response to the threat of guerrilla warfare. Indeed, the Wehrmacht had attempted a systematic approach to the threat of partisan warfare during Operation Barbarossa (the Russian campaign) in 1941, and later in the Balkans.The German Campaign In Russia: Planning And Operations (1940-1942), Historical Study, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., Pamphlet 20-261a (German Report Series). The German Campaigns in the Balkans (Spring 1941), Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., Pamphlet 20-260 (German Report Series). Developed by Wehrmacht tactics against Soviet partisans would play a part in the development of a postwar doctrine for fighting communist guerrillas was perhaps a natural product of the Cold War hysteria of the 1950s. The army's 1956 book-length study Soviet Partisans was the last and most comprehensive of the \\"German Report Series\\" on anti-partisan warfare.The Soviet Partisan Movement, 1941-1944, Historical Study, Department of the Army, Washington, D.C., Pamphlet 20-244 (German Report Series). Michael McClintock writes that, \\"The disturbing similarity between the Nazi's view of the world and the American stance in the Cold War apparently went by the board.\\"Instruments of Statecraft by Michael McClintock (1992) Related activities, just after WWII, included a Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG), first in Greece. Another MAAG went to French Indochina in 1950. The U.S. really had no formal organization for providing foreign internal defense (FID) assistance, before the creation of the United States special operations forces. MAAG activities were intended to be largely advisory (i.e., noncombat), while the Special Forces was designed from the beginning for training and leading guerrillas of the host nation against an occupier.  Vietnam  As U.S. involvement increased in Southeast Asia, Special Forces personnel were assigned to FID missions with South Vietnamese troops. The MAAG converted to Military Assistance Command Vietnam (MACV), the theater-level military command, in 1962, as a MAAG was not organized to command combat units. The first initiatives involved a CIA-sponsored program, operated by the Army Special Forces, to work with Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Groups (CIDG) and Nung mercenaries to establish village defense. Subsequently, many members of these paramilitary units joined the Vietnamese Rangers, South Vietnam's National Police Special Units or special paramilitary forces, such as Counter-Terror Teams and Provincial Reconnaissance Units (PRU). They all later became a critical component of the military and civilian pacification and rural security programs in South Vietnam in the 1960s. Starting from 1965, while they were not as properly trained for working with host nation personnel, the US Marine Corps Combined Action Program (CAP) also took on a role of reinforcing and training local village militias in the South Vietnam. By 1967, the counterinsurgency military and civilian efforts in the South Vietnam were consolidated under the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) command, which was shared between Saigon government, U.S. MACV and the CIA. Among CORDS multiple activities, the controversial Phoenix Program aimed at neutralizing the cadres of the Viet Cong Infrastructure (VCI) in South Vietnam, who created and executed a shadow system of government in the rural areas, stands out.Douglas Pike. Viet Cong: The Organization and Technique of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1966. In 1965‚Äì1972, the Phoenix Program \\"had eliminated upwards of 80,000 VCI through defection, detention, or death\\".Andrew R. Finlayson. A Retrospective on Counterinsurgency Operations: The Tay Ninh Provincial Reconnaissance Unit and Its Role in the Phoenix Program, 1969-70, CIA Historical Document, 12 June 2007. The Viet Cong insurgency in South Vietnam brought to life the \\"single largest and most comprehensive military counterinsurgency assessment apparatus in the history of warfare\\". It was run by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, MACV, and the Central Intelligence Agency. \\"Hundreds of thousands of military personnel, civilians, Vietnamese nationals, intelligence experts, and analysts\\" collected and assessed the insurgency related information from 44 provinces, 257 districts, 2,464 villages, and 11,729 hamlets in South Vietnam to aid in decision making and charting the counterinsurgency strategy and tactics. The data was organized through catalogs and computer databases, such as, the Hamlet Evaluation System, the Terrorist Incident Reporting System, the Territorial Forces Effectiveness System, the Pacification Attitude Analysis System, the Situation Reports Army File, among others. Input metric varied from bars of soap distributed among the villagers to the \\"body counts\\" as a measure of the primary progress.FM 3-24/MCWP 3-33.5 Insurgencies and Countering Insurgencies, Headquarters, Department of the Army, 14 May 2014. (Approved for public release; distribution is unlimited.)  Vietnam to 9/11  After the United States‚Äô poor experience with combating insurgents in Vietnam, the country was hesitant to enter other conflicts that may result in insurgent style resistance. Scholars and military leaders such as Steven Metz and General Petraeus admitted that the United States had lost much of its counterinsurgency capabilities after the Vietnam war.FM 3-24 - Combined Arms Center. 2006, usacac.army.mil/cac2/Repository/Materials/COIN-FM3-24.pdf. In the 1980s the U.S. partly rebuilt their counterinsurgency abilities when the Soviet Union again began to sponsor insurgencies in third world countries such as El Salvador. With the end of the cold war in the 1990s, the U.S. again purged its counterinsurgency knowledge and capabilities, ‚Äúassuming it was a legacy of the Cold War that would fade to irrelevance with the demise of the Soviet Union.\\" In the post-Cold War era, Operation Desert Storm was the only conflict in which the U.S. military played a major active role. In this conflict U.S. commanders demonstrated their mastery of conventional warfare using superior technology, firepower, and tactical skill. The swift and devastating use of technology in this conflict led many to believe that information warfare was the future face of combat.  Post 9/11  = Counterinsurgency in Iraq and Afghanistan = The United States' avoidance of conflicts that could turn into insurgencies began to be noticed by terrorist leaders. In a 1997 interview with CNN, Osama bin Laden, then leader of Al Qaeda, said in reference to the US withdrawal in Somalia, \\"After a little resistance, the American troops left after achieving nothing... They left after some resistance from powerless, poor, unarmed people whose only weapon is the belief in Allah the Almighty,\\". On September 11, 2001 bin Laden orchestrated the deadliest terrorist attack ever carried out on United States soil. This attack shocked the United States out of its insurgency avoidance policy. thumb Shortly after the September 11th attacks, the United States deployed forces to Afghanistan to overthrow the Taliban government which was harboring bin Laden. United States forces once again deployed superior technology, firepower, and tactics to defeat Taliban forces in a relatively short period. However, Afghanistan's history of a weak centralized government coupled with neighboring countries providing safe haven for Taliban leaders made the construction of a stable new government difficult. In 2006, there was a resurgence in Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan. The invasion of Iraq during Operation Iraqi Freedom saw many parallels to the invasion of Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom. United States ground troops entered Iraq in March 2001. The initial invasion of Iraq was characterized by ‚Äúshock and awe‚Äù. Shock and awe was a tactic designed to demonstrate the overwhelming power of the United States to the Iraqi people through a display of unmatched artillery and air power. This tactic resulted in US forces occupying the capital of Iraq, Baghdad, within two weeks of the invasion. However, U.S forces encountered pockets of Sunni resistance in Baghdad and surrounding cities. This resistance marked the beginnings of the insurgency that has plagued US forces during its occupation of Iraq. Several factors including a failure to restore public utilities, the disbanding of the Iraqi military, and violence between US troops and Iraqi civilians led to increased resistance and the formation of insurgent groups. The United States' postwar plan did not adequately prepare the U.S. for an insurgency scenario. 300x300px The doctrine of shock and awe proved ineffective against eliminating small pockets of insurgent fighters. U.S. forces began to shift away from the shock and awe strategy to ‚Äúhearts and minds‚Äù. Hearts and minds shifted away from displays of massive firepower and attempted to persuade to local population to support the new government through more peaceful means The United States has sent millions of dollars of humanitarian aid to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. forces have worked closely with other humanitarian groups such as the red cross to ensure that humanitarian aid is distributed throughout these areas. In addition to winning the \\"hearts and minds\\" of the people, the United States vastly improved its intelligence gathering techniques in an effort to dismantle insurgency networks. In 2005, the NSA worked closely with the CIA to deploy airborne cameras and intercept cell phone signals around Iraq. This gave United States forces the ability to watch the country with what General McChrystal termed an \\"unblinking eye\\". This level of surveillance created a flow of intelligence that gave Special Forces teams the ability to conduct almost nightly raids against key targets in order to dismantle insurgency networks more effectively. Another tactic used by the United States in both Iraq and Afghanistan is and effort to shift the responsibility of providing security for specific areas to the local populations by setting up local police forces. The Afghan Local Police (ALP) program has assisted the US in raiding insurgent compounds and providing security for areas that US forces have cleared out of active insurgent groups. The ALP have encountered difficulties recruiting individuals willing to defy the Taliban for fear of retaliation, a lack of funding from the local government, and some members of the ALP feeling they are little more than a ‚Äúwall of meat‚Äù for US forces. US forces also focused on stemming the flow of heroin out of Afghanistan. It is estimated that 90% of the world's heroin supply was being exported out of Afghanistan. The sale of heroin was used at least in part to fund insurgent activities in the country and cutting of the flow of cash became a top priority for the United States. = Counterinsurgency in Colombia = In an effort to reducing the export of Heroin from Afghanistan, the United States committed a large number of resources to the Colombian government to combat the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias Colombianas (FARC) insurgency in Colombia. The FARC was identified as a key component in the Heroine supply chain. Instead of deploying forces to Colombia to conduct counterinsurgency operations, the United States maintained a minimal presence. Instead, the United States focused on providing resources and training to the Colombian military and police force to conduct their own Counterinsurgency operations. By 2011, the FARC had been marginalized and Columbia had established a strong central government. = Preemptive Counterinsurgency in Africa = The United States has maintained a presence in Africa in order to decrease the risk of an insurgency. In 2013, the U.S. had 5000 troops in Africa that ‚Äúcarried out 55 operations, 10 exercises and 481 security cooperation activities.‚Äù The U.S. strategy in Africa is a three pronged approach that includes military support and training, highly advertised humanitarian projects, and intelligence gathering. When gathering intelligence, the United States has focused its efforts on cultural intelligence to support ‚ÄúAfricom strategic movements on the continent.‚Äù The end goal of the U.S. is to gather ‚Äú...socio-cultural and political knowledge of the potential enemy before s/he becomes an enemy.‚Äù Human rights violations Unfortunately, human rights violations tend to be common during insurgencies and counterinsurgency efforts. Western powers conducting multiple foreign internal defense (FID) operations are coming under increasing pressure to provide human rights and Geneva Conventions training to host nation personnel, although the results vary. Part of the challenge arrives when host nation personnel gets involved in combat without FID advisers, who are supposed to monitor their conduct and prevent abuses. The 1980-1992 Salvadoran Civil War, where human rights violations were documented on both sides, can be cited as an example. The U.S. aid allowed the Salvadoran military to defeat the Farabundo Mart√≠ National Liberation Front (FMLN). In one particular case which occurred in December 1981, the US-trained Salvadoran army's elite counter-insurgency unit, the Atlacatl Battalion, commanded by Lt. Col. Domingo Monterrosa, willingly committed retaliation killings at El Mozote, Morazan province, with the result of more than 800 civilians, including 131 children under the age of 12, murdered during search-and-destroy offensive.LeoGrande, William M. Our Own Backyard: The United States in Central America, 1977‚Äì1992. Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1998, p. 155. The plans to unleash terror against civilians became known to at least one U.S. Special Forces military adviser, which was revealed by Greg Walker, a former U.S. Army Special Forces Staff Sergeant, who served in El Salvador from 1982 to 1985.Shafir, Gershon, Everard Meade, and William J. Aceves. Lessons and Legacies of the War on Terror: From Moral Panic to Permanent War. London: Routledge, 2013. Apparently, no formal U.S. government investigation of that particular adviser's failure to deter the massacre has ever been carried out. Moreover, Returning to the El Mozote massacre, it was duly reported to the American public by Ray Bonner from The New York Times and Anna Guillermoprieto from The Washington Post, however, the U.S. State Department denied the participation of the Salvadoran army in mass murder.Little, Michael R.

He participated in the non- violent resistance against the British rule in India. Freedom Fighter In 1921, at the age of 17, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju, walked out of the National College and gave up education to participate in the Freedom Struggle of India. Since that year, he participated in several Campaigns and Satyagraha movements until India achieved Independence. He was jailed on several occasions during his participation in the Freedom Struggle. He occupied several important positions in the Andhra Congress party during this period. He served as Sceretary and President of the Guntur District Congress and was the General Secretary of the Andhra Congress Party. Among the notable leaders of Andhra Pradesh, Sri Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, Sri Alapati Venkataramaiah and Sri Venigalla Satyanarayana were all introduced to politics by Sri Manthena Venkata Raju. In 1938, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju conducted the All India Workshop for Politics in the village of Manthenavaripalem and helped educate several leaders in the importance of politics and governance. Several leaders with Socialist-Communist lenience, within the Congress, also participated in the Workshop. Social Worker Sri Manthena Venkata Raju participated in several Social causes. In 1934, he participated in a campaign to allow Harijans into temples. He helped dig many wells to provide drinking water to several villages and also encouraged people from all castes to inter mix socially. He conducted widow marriages in the village of Karlapalem and also conducted several inter-caste marriages during his lifetime. Political Leader He entered the State Assembly in 1946, and was a member until 1962, barring a gap of two years. During his tenure in the State Assembly, he assumed a very important role in State Politics. During those times, Chief Ministers like, Sri Neelam Sanjeeva Reddy, Sri Gopal Reddy and Sri Sanjeevayya, were among those who sought the blessings of Sri Manthena Venkata Raju. He always professed the principal of retirement from active politics after a certain age, like in any other salaried job; in accordance with this principle, he retired from Politics at the age of 58, in the year 1962. He believed in strong principles and was among those who lived by example. Even without having riches or the caste equation working to his advantage, Sri Manthena Venkata Raju, established his presence in the political arena of the State of Andhra Pradesh through his disinterest in positions and his commitment to social work. The Sri Manthena Venkata Raju Foundation was established by Champati Vijaya Ramaraju, ex-MLA of Bapatla, in his memory.

As of April 2018, no products were being marketed under this brand. Electric guitars The electric guitars in this range were manufactured in East Asia and typically sold as part of a starter package with a Squier SP-10 practice amplifier (e.g. \\"Starcaster Strat Pack\\"). In 2006‚Äì2007 the Fender website identified them as being sold through Best Buy, Target, Sam's Club and Costco outlets. Different finishes were available exclusively at each outlet, for example, three-tone sunburst with rosewood fretboard from Best Buy, black with maple fingerboard from Target and metallic black with rosewood fingerboard and pearloid scratchplate (Model No. 0283001165) from Sam's Club. Although the range was withdrawn from the Fender website in 2007, it continued to be developed and was sold through a variety of other outlets, such as BJ's Wholesale Club, Amazon.com and Buy.com. Most of these guitars were Stratocasters, but some early versions (sometimes called S1) had an arrow-shaped headstock similar to that of the Fender Swinger. The typical Starcaster Strat Pack solid-body electric was fitted with three single-coil pickups, a five-way selector switch and a floating tremolo bridge. The neck on models up to 2011 features the large CBS headstock and may have 21 or 22 frets, depending on the model. Some models have the headstock painted to match the guitar body. Later Starcaster models feature the smaller Fender headstock. The body may be basswood or agathis depending on model and year of manufacture. To bring down cost, other minor changes, such as a lower-grade tremolo, were made, and the Starcaster was manufactured in Far Eastern countries such as China or Indonesia. The pickup cavity is routed to allow an H-S-H pickup configuration, which allows for flexibility in pickup arrangement. Although most models feature the classic Stratocaster configuration of three single-coil pickups, at least one uses the H-S-S pickup configuration with a humbucker in the bridge position. It is not considered a Strat copy because the Stratocaster design is owned by Fender.

In nucleotide sugar metabolism a group of biochemicals known as nucleotide sugars act as donors for sugar residues in the glycosylation reactions that produce polysaccharides. They are substrates for glycosyltransferases. The nucleotide sugars are also intermediates in nucleotide sugar interconversions that produce some of the activated sugars needed for glycosylation reactions. Since most glycosylation takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus, there are a large family of nucleotide sugar transporters that allow nucleotide sugars to move from the cytoplasm, where they are produced, into the organelles where they are consumed. Nucleotide sugar metabolism is particularly well-studied in yeast, fungal pathogens, and bacterial pathogens, such as E. coli and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, since these molecules are required for the synthesis of glycoconjugates on the surfaces of these organisms. These glycoconjugates are virulence factors and components of the fungal and bacterial cell wall. These pathways are also studied in plants, but here the enzymes involved are less well understood.

He previously played for the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, and Houston Astros. Morton was an All-Star in 2018 and 2019. Amateur career Morton was born in Flemington, New Jersey to Jeanne and Chip Morton, an accountant and former Penn State basketball player. His grandfather played in the Philadelphia Athletics farm system. He was raised in Trumbull, Connecticut playing little league baseball with future major leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow and infielder Jamie D'Antona. Morton grew up attending ballgames at Yankee Stadium and idolizing Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens. Morton attended Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut graduating in 2002. Professional career =Atlanta Braves= The Atlanta Braves selected Morton in the third round with the 95th overall selection of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He started his professional career in 2002 with the GCL Braves. In 2003, he played for the Danville Braves. He spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Rome Braves. In 2006, he pitched for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans. In 2007, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves. Braves in 2008 The Braves added Morton to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2007. Morton made his major league debut on June 14, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing three runs in six innings and earning his first major league win. =Pittsburgh Pirates= On June 3, 2009, the Braves traded Morton with Gorkys Hern√°ndez and Jeff Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Nate McLouth. He made his first start with the Pirates on June 10 pitching an inning against the Atlanta Braves, while Jeff Karstens got the win. On June 28, he received his first decision, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 3, 2009, he won his first game pitching 6 innings of 1 hit baseball against the Florida Marlins. On September 30, 2009, he pitched a complete game 4 hitter with 8 strikeouts against the Chicago Cubs. His 2009 record in 18 starts was 5 wins and 9 losses, a 4.55 ERA, 97 innings pitched and 62 strikeouts, 40 walks, 7 home runs, 5 hit batsmen, .276 average against, and a 1.46 WHIP. Morton began 2010 spring training as a member of the Pirates' starting rotation. He struggled losing all five starts in April and finishing the month with a 12.57 earned run average (ERA). However Morton delivered a promising performance on April 30, 2010 against the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out 8 in six innings of work while allowing six runs (only three earned). That game he was dealt a loss as the Pirates only provided him with two runs of support. He earned his first win of the season on May 5 against the Chicago Cubs striking out three in a 4‚Äì2 decision. However he lost each of his next four starts, dropping his record on the season to 1‚Äì9 with a 9.35 ERA. A day after suffering his 9th loss against the Cincinnati Reds, the Pirates placed him on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder fatigue. After recovering, he was assigned to the Pirates Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. Speaking before his first start with the Indians, Morton said \\"I was pressing. I wasn't being myself on the mound those last couple times I went out there in Pittsburgh. There was so much going on in my mind. At the end of last year, I finished strong, I got a glimpse of what I could do, truly, in the big leagues, going out there and going deep into games, being competitive, being someone who was pretty good. I wanted to be out there for myself and because I care about this team and organization. At the same time, though, after that last one, that last start, because I care about these guys is why, exactly, I knew I couldn't go back out there again.\\" Morton was recalled when starter Ross Ohlendorf was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder injury. On his final start of the 2010 season, Morton compiled his finest pitching performance of the year striking out a career-high nine batters in a 2‚Äì0 loss to the Florida Marlins on October 2. He finished the season with a 2‚Äì12 record and a 7.57 ERA, but in his final six starts of the season after being recalled in late August he sported a 4.26 ERA. 2011 was Morton's best season yet, where he held a 10‚Äì10 record in 29 starts with a 3.83 ERA, earning the club's Breakout Player of the Year. On April 15, Morton threw a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds. On May 18, again at Great American Ball Park, Morton threw a complete game-shutout, striking out 5 and giving up 5 hits. Following the season, Morton underwent successful hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in October 2011 with a full recovery expected in 4‚Äì6 months. He was optimistic about returning before Opening Day. However, he began the 2012 season on the disabled list, making his season debut on April 14. His season ended when he underwent Tommy John surgery on June 14, 2012. On June 13, 2013, Morton was activated off the DL. He picked up his first win of the season on June 18 in a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched innings giving up only 3 hits and no runs, while striking out 2. On July 22 and 27 he won back-to-back games for the first time since May 7 and 18, 2011. On December 11, 2013, Morton signed a three-year contract to remain with the Pirates, with a club option for the 2017 season. Morton was placed on the DL with right hip inflammation on August 17, 2014. At the time, he was 5‚Äì12 with a 3.84 ERA. During the month of September, Morton needed hip surgery, effectively ending his 2014 season. In 26 starts on 2014, Morton hit 19 batsmen with pitches, which led the Majors along with a 6‚Äì12 record and a 3.72 ERA. During 2015 spring training, Morton struggled thoroughly and began to experience inflammation in his recently surgically repaired hip. On April 5, 2015, the Pirates placed Morton on the 15-day disabled list. =Philadelphia Phillies= On December 12, 2015, the Pirates traded Morton to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for David Whitehead. His season came to an abrupt end on April 23, 2016, when Morton suffered a hamstring injury running to first base in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and was placed on the disabled list the next day. On April 27, the Phillies announced Morton would miss the rest of the 2016 season with a torn hamstring. =Houston Astros= On November 16, 2016, Morton signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Houston Astros. During the 2017 regular season, Morton made 25 starts, compiling a 14‚Äì7 record with a 3.62 ERA. He pitched innings and recorded 163 strikeouts. On October 16, 2017, Morton started Game 3 of the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium. He lost the game giving up 7 runs in innings. On October 21, he won Game 7 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park pitching five shutout innings with five strikeouts, sending the Astros to the World Series. Morton started Game 4 of the World Series and pitched well over 6.1 innings giving up one earned run on 3 hits and 7 strikeouts in an eventual Astros loss. Morton pitched the final four innings in Game 7 of the World Series. He was credited as the winning pitcher helping the Astros win their first World Series title. Three years later, it was revealed in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal that the team had broken MLB rules during the 2017 season. Morton admitted he knew about the team's cheating and expressed regret that he did not do anything to stop it.\\"Ex-Astros pitcher Charlie Morton regrets not stopping Houston's sign stealing\\". espn.com. February 8, 2020. Retrieved February 15, 2020. In 2018, Morton continued his successful stint with the Astros. On May 12, he set a personal record of 14 strikeouts over seven innings in a 6‚Äì1 victory against the Texas Rangers. Entering the All-Star break third in the American League with 11 wins, 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings, and ninth in ERA (2.96), Morton was added to the AL roster for the 2018 MLB All-Star game. Morton avoided serious injury in 2018, with only a short trip to the 10-day DL for shoulder discomfort. He pitched 167 innings, second only to his 2011 high of 171.2. Morton finished the regular season with a 3.13 ERA, a 15-3 win-loss record, and 201 strikeouts, all constituting career highs. = Tampa Bay Rays = On December 21, 2018, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Morton to a two-year, $30 million contract. He made his debut as a Ray against the Astros on March 29, 2019, pitching five innings and earning the win. On June 30, he was awarded his second consecutive All-Star appearance.https://www.wfla.com/sports/charlie- morton-makes-debut-rays-even-series-at-1/1887156479 In 2019, he led all major league pitchers in home runs/9 innings pitched, at 0.694. He set career highs in wins (16), ERA (3.05), innings () and strikeouts (240). He finished in third place for the Cy Young Award. Morton started the American League Wild Card Game against the Oakland Athletics, receiving a win in five innings of work. This was Morton's third career win in winner-take-all playoff games, this is the most in MLB playoff history. On August 10, 2020, Morton was placed on the injured list with inflammation in his right shoulder.https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2020/08/rays-charlie-morton-injured- list.html Morton finished the 2020 year with an ERA of 4.74 over 38 innings. Morton pitched in game 7 of the American League Championship Series against his former team the Houston Astros. He recorded his fourth win in a winner- take-all playoff game, extending his record. Pitching style Morton's repertoire consisted in 2013 of a four-seam fastball, a sinker, a curveball, and a split-finger fastball with his speed maxing out in the low 90s. Morton picked up the splitter in 2011 having previously thrown a changeup. He also has previously thrown a slider and a cutter. Morton's sinker was his most common pitch, especially against right-handed hitters. His curveball was his most common pitch in a two strike count. Due to changes in his delivery and the emphasis he has placed on the sinker, Morton drew comparisons to Roy Halladay. Pirates special assistant Jim Benedict had previously encouraged Morton to emulate Halladay's delivery during spring training. Morton featured his new sinker almost exclusively in his first starts of the 2011 season and it resulted in an increased groundball rate but also more bases on balls. Pirates' fans christened him with the nickname \\"Ground Chuck.\\"Pittsburgh Pirates: Charlie Morton Is the Real Deal in the Rotation In the 2015 offseason, a frustrated Morton began experimenting with throwing harder, alongside adjustments to his technique and workouts. In his injury-abbreviated starts with the Phillies, he showcased his newfound velocity. Along with high spin rates, this attracted the attention of Houston's front office which signed him and encouraged Morton to continue throwing hard four-seam fastballs, as Morton felt his sinker was becoming ineffective. While playing for the Astros, Morton transformed into a strikeout pitcher finding new effectiveness against left-handed hitters. With Houston his primary pitches were a four-seam fastball reaching 98-99 MPH and a curveball with considerable vertical and horizontal movement, which Morton considers his best pitch. In 2018, his improvements on his curveball was attributed to his low three- quarters position, but slightly above sidearm at release.

It is the oldest practical semiconductor device. M‚ÄìS junctions can either be rectifying or non-rectifying. The rectifying metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction forms a Schottky barrier, making a device known as a Schottky diode, while the non-rectifying junction is called an ohmic contact.Semiconductor Devices: Modelling and Technology, Nandita Dasgupta, Amitava Dasgupta.(2004) . (In contrast, a rectifying semiconductor‚Äìsemiconductor junction, the most common semiconductor device today, is known as a p‚Äìn junction.) Metal‚Äìsemiconductor junctions are crucial to the operation of all semiconductor devices. Usually an ohmic contact is desired, so that electrical charge can be conducted easily between the active region of a transistor and the external circuitry. Occasionally however a Schottky barrier is useful, as in Schottky diodes, Schottky transistors, and metal‚Äìsemiconductor field effect transistors.  The critical parameter: Schottky barrier height  Band diagram for metal-semiconductor junction at zero bias (equilibrium). Shown is the graphical definition of the Schottky barrier height, Œ¶B, for an n-type semiconductor as the difference between the interfacial conduction band edge EC and Fermi level EF. Whether a given metal- semiconductor junction is an ohmic contact or a Schottky barrier depends on the Schottky barrier height, Œ¶B, of the junction. For a sufficiently large Schottky barrier height, where Œ¶B is significantly higher than the thermal energy kT, the semiconductor is depleted near the metal and behaves as a Schottky barrier. For lower Schottky barrier heights, the semiconductor is not depleted and instead forms an ohmic contact to the metal. The Schottky barrier height is defined differently for n-type and p-type semiconductors (being measured from the conduction band edge and valence band edge, respectively). The alignment of the semiconductor's bands near the junction is typically independent of the semiconductor's doping level, so the n-type and p-type Schottky barrier heights are ideally related to each other by: :\\\\Phi_{\\\\rm B}^{(n)} + \\\\Phi_{\\\\rm B}^{(p)} = E_{\\\\rm g} where Eg is the semiconductor's band gap. In practice, the Schottky barrier height is not precisely constant across the interface, and varies over the interfacial surface.http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/inhomo.htm  Schottky‚ÄìMott rule and Fermi level pinning  The Schottky‚ÄìMott rule of Schottky barrier formation predicts the Schottky barrier height based on the vacuum work function of the metal relative to the vacuum electron affinity (or vacuum ionization energy) of the semiconductor: :\\\\Phi_{\\\\rm B}^{(n)} \\\\approx \\\\Phi_{\\\\rm metal} - \\\\chi_{\\\\rm semi} This model is derived based on the thought experiment of bringing together the two materials in vacuum, and is closely related in logic to Anderson's rule for semiconductor-semiconductor junctions. Different semiconductors respect the Schottky‚ÄìMott rule to varying degrees. Although the Schottky‚ÄìMott model correctly predicted the existence of band bending in the semiconductor, it was found experimentally that it would give grossly incorrect predictions for the height of the Schottky barrier. A phenomenon referred to as \\"Fermi level pinning\\" caused some point of the band gap, at which finite DOS exists, to be locked (pinned) to the Fermi level. This made the Schottky barrier height almost completely insensitive to the metal's work function:http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/physics/tung/Schottky/systematics.htm :\\\\Phi_{\\\\rm B} \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2} E_{\\\\rm bandgap} where Ebandgap is the size of band gap in the semiconductor. It was noted in 1947 by John Bardeen that the Fermi level pinning phenomenon would naturally arise if there were chargeable states in the semiconductor right at the interface, with energies inside the semiconductor's gap. These would either be induced during the direct chemical bonding of the metal and semiconductor (metal-induced gap states) or be already present in the semiconductor‚Äìvacuum surface (surface states). These highly dense surface states would be able to absorb a large quantity of charge donated from the metal, effectively shielding the semiconductor from the details of the metal. As a result, the semiconductor's bands would necessarily align to a location relative to the surface states which are in turn pinned to the Fermi level (due to their high density), all without influence from the metal. The Fermi level pinning effect is strong in many commercially important semiconductors (Si, Ge, GaAs), and thus can be problematic for the design of semiconductor devices. For example, nearly all metals form a significant Schottky barrier to n-type germanium and an ohmic contact to p-type germanium, since the valence band edge is strongly pinned to the metal's Fermi level. The solution to this inflexibility requires additional processing steps such as adding an intermediate insulating layer to unpin the bands. (In the case of germanium, germanium nitride has been used)  History  The rectification property of metal‚Äìsemiconductor contacts was discovered by Ferdinand Braun in 1874 using mercury metal contacted with copper sulfide and iron sulfide semiconductors. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose applied for a US patent for a metal-semiconductor diode in 1901. This patent was awarded in 1904. G.W. Pickard received a patent in 1906 on a point-contact rectifier using silicon. In 1907, George W. Pierce published a paper in Physical Review showing rectification properties of diodes made by sputtering many metals on many semiconductors. The use of the metal‚Äìsemiconductor diode rectifier was proposed by Lilienfeld in 1926 in the first of his three transistor patents as the gate of the metal‚Äìsemiconductor field effect transistors. The theory of the field-effect transistor using a metal/semiconductor gate was advanced by William Shockley in 1939. The earliest metal‚Äìsemiconductor diodes in electronics application occurred around 1900, when the cat's whisker rectifiers were used in receivers. They consisted of pointed tungsten wire (in the shape of a cat's whisker) whose tip or point was pressed against the surface of a galena (lead sulfide) crystal. The first large area rectifier appeared around 1926 which consisted of a copper(I) oxide semiconductor thermally grown on a copper substrate. Subsequently, selenium films were evaporated onto large metal substrates to form the rectifying diodes. These selenium rectifiers were used (and are still used) to convert alternating current to direct current in electrical power applications. During 1925‚Äì1940, diodes consisting of a pointed tungsten metal wire in contact with a silicon crystal base, were fabricated in laboratories to detect microwaves in the UHF range. A World War II program to manufacture high-purity silicon as the crystal base for the point-contact rectifier was suggested by Frederick Seitz in 1942 and successfully undertaken by the Experimental Station of the E. I du Pont de Nemours Company. The first theory that predicted the correct direction of rectification of the metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction was given by Nevill Mott in 1939. He found the solution for both the diffusion and drift currents of the majority carriers through the semiconductor surface space charge layer which has been known since about 1948 as the Mott barrier. Walter H. Schottky and Spenke extended Mott's theory by including a donor ion whose density is spatially constant through the semiconductor surface layer. This changed the constant electric field assumed by Mott to a linearly decaying electric field. This semiconductor space-charge layer under the metal is known as the Schottky barrier. A similar theory was also proposed by Davydov in 1939. Although it gives the correct direction of rectification, it has also been proven that the Mott theory and its Schottky-Davydov extension gives the wrong current limiting mechanism and wrong current-voltage formulae in silicon metal/semiconductor diode rectifiers. The correct theory was developed by Hans Bethe and reported by him in a M.I.T. Radiation Laboratory Report dated November 23, 1942. In Bethe's theory, the current is limited by thermionic emission of electrons over the metal‚Äìsemiconductor potential barrier. Thus, the appropriate name for the metal‚Äìsemiconductor diode should be the Bethe diode, instead of the Schottky diode, since the Schottky theory does not predict the modern metal‚Äìsemiconductor diode characteristics correctly. If a metal-semiconductor junction is formed by placing a droplet of mercury, as Braun did, onto a semiconductor, e.g.silicon, to form a Schottky barrier in a Schottky diode electrical setup ‚Äì electrowetting can be observed, where the droplet spreads out with increasing voltage. Depending on the doping type and density in the semiconductor, the droplet spreading depends on the magnitude and sign of the voltage applied to the mercury droplet.S. Arscott and M. Gaudet \\"Electrowetting at a liquid metal-semiconductor junction\\" Appl. Phys. Lett. 103, 074104 (2013). This effect has been termed ‚ÄòSchottky electrowetting‚Äô, effectively linking electrowetting and semiconductor effects.S. Arscott \\"Electrowetting and semiconductors\\" RSC Advances 4, 29223 (2014). The MOSFET (metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor) was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, and presented in 1960. They extended their work on MOS technology to do pioneering work on hot carrier devices, which used what would later be called a Schottky barrier. The Schottky diode, also known as the Schottky-barrier diode, was theorized for years, but was first practically realized as a result of the work of Atalla and Kahng during 19601961. They published their results in 1962 and called their device the \\"hot electron\\" triode structure with semiconductor- metal emitter. It was one of the first metal-base transistors. Atalla continued research on Schottky diodes with Robert J. Archer at HP Associates. They developed high vacuum metal film deposition technology, and fabricated stable evaporated/sputtered contacts, publishing their results in January 1963. Their work was a breakthrough in metal‚Äìsemiconductor junction and Schottky barrier research, as it overcame most of the fabrication problems inherent in point-contact diodes and made it possible to build practical Schottky diodes.

First opening its doors to the public in April 2007, the castle is the project of 4th generation vintner, Dario Sattui, who also owns and operates the V. Sattui Winery named after his great-grandfather, Vittorio Sattui, who originally established a winery in San Francisco in 1885 after emigrating from Italy to California. The winery property was once part of an estate owned by Edward Turner Bale. In 1993, Sattui purchased for $3.1 million, then spent another $40 million to construct the castle, outbuildings, and the winery inside the castle; construction work began in 1995. Due to the Glass Fire that began on September 27, 2020, the farmhouse suffered major damage, the entire 2020 vintage of the wine Fantasia was lost, but the castle was left unharmed.  Inspiration  After graduating with an MBA from the University of California, Berkeley in 1969, Dario Sattui spent 2 years traveling around Europe in an old VW van, during which time he developed an interest in medieval architecture. He took photos and made sketches of various buildings he would visit including medieval castles, monasteries, palaces, farmhouses and wineries.  The castle  Front entrance to the Castello di Amorosa Winery. The castle interiors, which include 107 rooms on 8 levels above and below ground, were approximately when opened in 2007; it has since been expanded to 141,000 square feet. Key details and building techniques are architecturally faithful to the 12th and 13th century time period. Among many other features, it includes a moat; a drawbridge, defensive towers, an interior courtyard, a torture chamber, a chapel/church, a knights' chamber, and a 72 by great hall with a -high coffered ceiling. The torture chamber has an iron maiden said to be from the late Renaissance, which Sattui states he bought for $13,000 in Pienza, Italy; a replica rack; and other torture devices. The great hall features frescoes painted by two Italian artists, who took about a year and a half to complete, and showcases a 500-year-old fireplace. Wine tasting in the cellar The masonry, ironwork, and woodwork were fashioned by hand using old world crafting techniques. Building materials included 8,000 tons of locally quarried stone, paving stones, terra cotta roofing tiles, and 850,000 bricks imported from Europe. Extending into the hillside adjacent to the castle is a labyrinth of caves some in length. Beneath the castle are a barrel cellar and tasting rooms where visitors can sample the wines, all sold only at the Castle or through the winery's wine club. Due to Napa County restrictions, the castle and grounds cannot be rented for weddings or receptions, but are available to rent for corporate gatherings and fund raisers. In May 2012 the county ordered the winery to cease holding a weekly Catholic Mass in the chapel located on the grounds due to lack of use permits.

It runs mostly north- south through the southeastern corner of the town, near the Putnam Valley town line. Starting from an intersection with Sprout Brook Road at Continental Village just north of the Putnam-Westchester county line, it ends at an oblique junction with US 9 east of Garrison. As the least improved section of the original Albany Post Road, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1982. Its history as a formal road dates to the mid-17th century, when it was built on established Native American trails. Later it would see military use, particularly by the Continental Army during the Revolution, and commercial use as part of a stagecoach route. Some of the milestones placed during the early years of American independence to more accurately calculate postal rates are still present and have been preserved and restored. It is still in public use and maintained by the town. The town has recently angered some of the residents by proposing to pave the road. Route Old Albany Post Road passes through heavily wooded and lightly populated country along the southeastern edge of the Hudson Highlands. Houses, many on large lots, are the only development along the road, and there are no settlements along its length. The countryside is rugged, with the road going up and down several hills. Some areas are scenic, with meadows and views of the nearby hills and mountains. It branches off to the northwest at the point where Gallows Hill Road becomes Sprout Brook Road. From there it takes a west- northwestward, meandering course at first, narrowing almost to one lane at some points and climbing steadily to where the Catskill Aqueduct crosses, but soon bends to the north-northeast and widens. It climbs and then descends over the next two miles (3 km) to the Lake Celeste area, where it becomes more northerly. Then it bends to the northeast again, going up and down several hills through mostly undeveloped areas, to Chapman Road, where the Appalachian Trail crosses. Old Albany Post Road, in red Out of that intersection it resumes its northward course, traversing around Fort Defiance Mountain, to Canopus Hill Road. There it turns to the northwest. At the corner of Travis Corners Road, a monument explains the historical importance of the road. From here it runs almost straight north-northwest past some farms and more open land to cross Philipse Brook at the junction with Philipse Brook Road. Beyond, the road remains mostly straight and northwestward, eventually returning to more wooded country along a ridgetop where the southwestern corner of Clarence Fahnestock State Park is nearby. It then turns more to the west and descends to the intersection with Indian Brook Road, near the Bird and Bottle Inn. From here it parallels nearby Route 9, reaching some more developed areas until it finally ends with a merge onto the highway. History All of the major work of building and widening the road was done during the colonial era. Old Albany Post Road has not seen much change since the mid-18th century. Later improvements in transportation technology diverted traffic away from it and have helped to preserve the road in its historic form. =Colonial era= In 1669 the government of New Netherland designated a postal route between what would later be New York City and Albany, the colony's two most important cities at the time. It was little more than a narrow path in many places, following old trails used by the Wiccoppe and Wappinger tribes, who often carried the mail, starting two years later. The longest stretch included part of the current Old Albany Post Road. The colony eventually became the English Province of New York, and in 1703 its legislative body provided for the postal road to be a \\"public and common general highway\\" along the same route, starting in Kingsbridge and ending at a ferry landing in present-day Rensselaer. That legislation authorized the road to be as much as four rods () wide where necessary. It was called the Queen's Road at first, after then- Queen Anne, and later the King's Road when she was succeeded by George I and II. As it became the main route between the two cities, local commerce began to serve the long-distance travelers. Inns are recorded along the road as early as the 1730s, when it was first widened for military use. The best- known, John Warren's Tavern, was built in 1756 and remains in use today as the Bird and Bottle Inn restaurant at the junction with Indian Brook Road. The road received major improvements when the British Army realized it needed to improve defenses against the French to the north in New France (today's Quebec). In 1754, it was widened again and trees were cleared to allow the transport of troops and materiel in greater numbers. Milestones were first known to have been placed in 1763, sometime after Benjamin Franklin, who had advocated their use, was appointed the colonies' Joint Postmaster General. After the French and Indian War, it would be used against the British by George Washington's Continental Army during the Revolutionary War. He retreated to what was named Continental Village after the Battle of White Plains and the road remained fortified and defended throughout the war, used as a supply route, and often traveled by Washington and his officers. It was surveyed during the war and the first map published. Its milestone locations are not the extant ones. Milestone 54 =18th and 19th centuries= After the war, the new state began making further use of the road. A regular stagecoach route was chartered along the road by the legislature in 1785, and the mileposts were upgraded by the end of the century. By then a regular mail route was in place, with riders going up the east side of the river and down another road on the west side on a weekly basis. In 1789 a new survey was taken and the old maps revised. These match today's known milestone locations along the entire former length of the road. A decade later, New York's Act to Regulate the Highways directed every county highway superintendent to place stone mile markers along the road. By the next year all the remaining mileposts had been placed. A private company built the Highlands Turnpike to the west, in more level country, and opened it in 1806. This diverted traffic away from the section north of Peekskill through Continental Village and past the lakes. Iron mining at Hopper Lake in the 1820s partially replaced it, and the stage route was not changed. The old road fell into further disuse when the turnpike became a public highway in 1833 and it was no longer needed as a shunpike. The completion of the Hudson River Railroad to Albany in 1850 made the road obsolete as a commercial and postal artery, and stage service ended. =20th and 21st centuries= Old Albany Post Road briefly assumed more than local importance once more in the 1910s, when the New York City water supply system was expanded to bring water to the city from Ashokan Reservoir in the Catskills. The road provided access to a section of the Catskill Aqueduct, and shops, housing and bars were built along it to shelter and serve the construction workers. A decade later, Highlands Turnpike, by then the main north-south route through the county, was paved and formally designated as Route 9. In 1921 a monument to the \\"Mothers of the Revolution\\" was placed at the southern end. Homes and farms along the road were electrified in 1935 due to the efforts of the newly created Rural Electrification Administration, adding utility poles to the landscape. A portion of the road near Travis Corners was surfaced in tar and gravel in the 20th century. Beyond that, it remains as it was in the mid-18th century. Following its NRHP listing, a group called the Old Road Society of Philipstown (ORSP) was formed to help preserve and promote it. Its membership is open to residents along the road and intersecting dirt roads. The town has, in recent years, raised the possibility of paving it, saying it would be cheaper to maintain and silts up a paralleling brook through erosion. This has divided residents along Old Albany Post Road. Opponents point to its historic designation, character and rural charm, which would be lost if it were surfaced. Proponents, many near the road's southern end, cite public safety concerns such as inaccessibility for police and fire vehicles during washouts in heavy storms like the April 2007 Nor'easter, which left craters four feet (1.3 m) deep in front of some driveways. The Federal Emergency Management Agency has given the town a grant to repair it, although it has not been decided whether it will be used for pavement or not. In November 2012, a local newspaper Philipstown.Info (now The Highlands Current) revealed that the Town of Philipstown budget contained proposed expenditures for paving sections of the town's historic dirt roads Town Plans to Pave Dirt Road Sections in 2013  Philipstown.info including 5300 feet of Old Albany Post Road in 2013-14 and an additional 7580 feet to be paved within 5 years.[Philipstown Highway Department 2013 Budget Planning Documents available at http://www.oldrdsoc.org/2013/index.htm] Until the paper revealed this information, residents of the road were unaware of the town's grand plans. The Philipstown Board cited three reasons for paving; the cost of maintaining dirt roads are too expensive, degradation of water quality in nearby streams, and safety.Town Plan for Paving Stirs Dirt Road Dust  Philipstown.info If this plan were undertaken the Old Albany Post Road would lose almost 2.5 miles of historic road. Sections that the town wants to pave include two important historic areas; Saunders Farm and the hill that runs north to the famous revolutionary era Bird and Bottle Inn. There is considerable opposition to paving by local residents and a contentious town board workshop was held for Philipstown residents on January 16, 2013.Residents of Dirt Roads Express Opposing Views on Paving  Philipstown.info Those in opposition to paving cite the historic, aesthetic, cultural, and recreational importance of leaving the road untouched. Many residents and an expert engineer presented information documenting that sound dirt road maintenance practices have not been utilized by the Town of Philipstown and if they were adopted would lead to cost savings, improvement in water quality, and thus preserve the historic nature of the road. Additionally other dirt road residents pointed out that drivers on dirt roads travel at significantly lower speeds reducing mortality in pedestrian vehicle accidents. It was also pointed out that the Town of Philipstown could be in violation of state bonding laws if they were to pave as proposed with merely a thin coat of asphalt and no substructure preparation. Contributing historic resources The entire right-of-way authorized in 1703 is included in the NRHP listing. This means that many other aspects of the structure, like the adjacent stone walls and shade trees, are considered contributing resources to the designation. The milestones are all included, even number 52, which is actually located on Gallows Hill Road slightly to the south of the fork at Sprout Hill. Some of the buildings along the road have been noted for their historic value by the ORSP. The Bird and Bottle Inn is a contributing property to the Indian Brook Road Historic District, which itself includes part of the road as one of its contributing properties. In the two-mile (3.2 km) section to its south there is also a Civil War-era farmhouse and a 1770s inn, both of which have seen more recent additions. Opposite Lake Celeste is Pine Run Farm, which dates to 1800.

It was built in 1916 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982 in recognition of its accomplishment in civil engineering. It is so named because it winds around the steep slopes of Storm King Mountain near its north end of the Hudson Highlands on the west bank of the Hudson River. Here it reaches heights of up to above the water, with panoramic views of the river and surrounding mountains such as Breakneck Ridge and Bull Hill. Several small pullouts allow drivers to stop and enjoy the view. When built it took off the trip between Cornwall and Newburgh to its north with Highland Falls and West Point to its south. It remains in use by commuters, though a bypass, now part of US 9W, was built, further shortening travel times while still offering panoramic views. Rock face along the Storm King Highway Route description Storm King Highway is a two-lane asphalt- paved road with double yellow lines forbidding passing along its entire length. Its grade never exceeds 7%, and it is bounded along the river side with a rubblestone wall. No buildings of any type are located along the road, nor is there any intersection save those for state park trailheads. There are chainlink gates at either end. Maintenance responsibilities are divided. The southern section is kept up by the New York State Department of Transportation as it is a state highway, while the Palisades Interstate Park Commission (PIPC) takes care of the northern section as it runs through Storm King State Park. Due to hazards of rockfall as well as avalanches and falling ice, the road is closed by the state Department of Transportation during periods of heavy rain or snow. In 1934, a landslide on Storm King Mountain crossed the highway and resulted in three fatalities and the destruction of three automobiles. At least one motorist has died on the highway due to a snow avalanche. The incident occurred at roughly the hour in which DOT workers closed the road during a 1993 snowstorm. The victim's estate and a survivor was later awarded damages in a lawsuit against the state. History Since the early days of settlement, the Highlands had long been a major obstacle to travel between Cornwall and the communities to its south. In 1913 state highway commissioner Gordon Reel began to think seriously about building a new road to connect them after heavy lobbying by local business and community groups. The idea he ultimately decided on, a road along the side of Storm King Mountain, was estimated to cost $400,000 ($ in 2008 dollars), far more than his department had funds available for, so the legislature had to make a special appropriation. Gates at northern end of Storm King Highway, in Cornwall After three years, during which surveyors sometimes had to rappel down the mountain's cliffs to mark the route, construction began in 1916. The original idea to build a tunnel was changed to a road cut into the side as lighting it would have been too expensive and it would have missed the most scenic aspects of the road. Accordingly, the specifications for the project were changed. The planned road was widened from , with a three-foot (1 m) concrete gutter. The difficulties of building one of New York's first public roads designed for automotive use were compounded by having to make sure that debris did not hamper the operations of the New York Central Railroad's West Shore Line, which ran along the river's edge below. Dislodged boulders sometimes blocked the tracks or landed on cars, damaging them and their contents. The first contractor hired for the job soon went bankrupt; they were replaced by the John L. Hayes Company of Yonkers. Hayes, too, found the going tough, especially when U.S. entry into World War I dried up the labor supply. The PIPC soon stepped in and renegotiated the contract to account for the difficulties caused to Hayes by the unforeseen circumstance of war. It also blunted opposition to the road by developing the state park around it. When it was opened in 1922 it shortened the distance required to travel by automobile from Newburgh to West Point, which are 10 miles (16 km) apart as the crow flies, by 22 miles (34 km). In 1940 this distance was further cut by the four- lane U.S. Route 9W, which travels west of Storm King. It remains a well-used commuter route for employees of the United States Military Academy who live in Cornwall. They must use alternate routes when the gates are closed, as they were for over a year following 1999 forest fires on Storm King and its vicinity. In summer of 2011 New York's Department of Transportation (DOT) closed the highway to vehicular traffic for four hours on Sundays to allow pedestrians and bicyclists to enjoy it freely. Up to 600 people took advantage of the closures on some of those days. Citing that success, DOT announced in September that it was extending the closures through November.

Along with Scepticism and Animal Faith and The Life of Reason, it is his most notable work; the first two works concentrate primarily on epistemology and ethics respectively, whereas The Realms of Being is mainly a work in the field of ontology. Santayana builds on his Skepticism and Animal Faith, which he described as a sort of precursor to \\"a new system of philosophy\\", that would be developed fully in the present work.Durant, Will. The Story of Philosophy Simon & Schuster, 1923. He defines four realms of being; The Realm of Essence, The Realm of Matter, The Realm of Truth, and The Realm of Spirit. Realms =The Realm of Essence= The Realm of Essence, in Santayana's view, has a type of primacy over the other realms. To him, essence is anything that is or has a character‚Äîthis includes thoughts, imaginings, derivations of logic, and material objects. Nothing can be experienced but through these essences, and they \\"are the only things people ever see, and the last they notice.\\" Essence is awareness, it is different from knowledge or from faith, which he defines later. =The Realm of Matter= Matter is the objective, material stuff of the universe. Staying true to his materialism, Santayana holds matter as the \\"primordial existential flux\\" and believes it can be, at least in some sense, known. His conception of matter is similar to Spinoza's substance; matter has no purpose, but constitutes the limitations of what can be. Humans can know matter only from a distance, symbolically: Thus, while Santayana reveres and deeply respects science (and believes it useful for everyday experiences), he does not deify it in the way many other philosophers of the 20th century have, and he limits it to a fallible approximation of truth. =The Realm of Truth= The Realm of Truth was thought of well after Santayana had thought of his other three realms; he envisions it as a sort of subdivision of the Realm of Essence. Truth is that part of the Realm of Essences instantiated by matter; indeed, he says: As the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on Santayana says: Santayana here departs from classical pragmatists, of whom he is often considered one, in that he believes truth has a strong element outside of experience, and must coincide with what actually is. =The Realm of Spirit= Spirit is, as used by Santayana, very much akin to consciousness; it is, according to John Lachs, \\"that part of a life constituted by its series of intuitions\\". Santayana believes that the mind is more accustomed to essence than it is to fact, and, as such, consciousness may at times manifest things that are not fact. Herein is to be found the Realm of Spirit; it is Santayana's attempt to reconcile the theories of Plato and the demands of reason.Flamm, Matthew C.

Pompallier House is a nineteenth-century building located in Russell, New Zealand which once served as the headquarters to the French Catholic mission to the Western Pacific. It is named after Jean Baptiste Pompallier, the first vicar apostolic to visit New Zealand, who founded a number of missions in the North Island. Pompallier House is owned and managed by Heritage New Zealand, who open it to the public. It is New Zealand's oldest Roman Catholic building, oldest rammed earth building, and oldest industrial building.McGill & Sheehan, p 18 History In 1836, Bishop Jean Baptiste Pompallier, along with the newly formed French order the Society of Mary (or Marists) received papal approval and were given the mission of Western Oceania. In 1838, Pompallier, along with three of these brothers arrived in Hokianga, on the West Coast of New Zealand, to begin their work in the country. Joined by other members of the order, they moved to the Bay of Islands to set up their headquarters in Kororareka (now Russell). Bishop Pompallier bought land in Russell in 1839, and the building was constructed in 1841-2 for use as a printery, but the building also housed a tannery, for book-binding. In 1842, it produced its first MƒÅori translations of religious texts.NZ Historic Places Trust: Pompallier History There were a number of other buildings on the site, including a chapel, houses, kitchens and other outhouses, but the \\"Pompallier House\\" is the only one remaining. In 1850 the mission headquarters moved to Auckland, and in 1856 James Callaghan took over the building, converting it to a residence known as \\"Callaghan's Castle\\". It passed through a number of private owners, who altered the original building, until the Government purchased the building in 1941. In the 1990s, it was fully restored to replicate its early condition. The building contains the original printing press, restored to working order, and the gardens remain as an example of the Victorian and Edwardian gardens typical of the latter owners. Construction Unable to bear the cost of purchasing much timber, the missionaries used the rammed earth construction common in Lyon, their original home. The earth was dug on site and supplemented with sand and rocks from the nearby beaches. Lime was made by burning shells. The upper floor was constructed with earth supported by timber frames. The work was supervised by architect Louis Perret. Printing press The Gaveaux printing press in the Pompallier House The original Gaveaux printing press was brought to the mission from France in the early 1840s; between 1842 and 1849 it printed over 30,000 books and tracts, some of the first in MƒÅori.NZ Historic Places Trust: Printing Press After the mission left Russell in 1850 the press was amongst the belongings redistributed. In 1857 the Waikato MƒÅori asked for the press, which was given to them by Bishop Pompallier. The press was used by TƒÅwhiao, the MƒÅori King to print the MƒÅori-language newspaper Te Paki o Matariki. The press remained in Waikato until the 1990s when it was returned to Pompallier by the MƒÅori Queen Te Atairangikaahu. Current Day Today, Pompallier Mission and Printery is open to the public seven days a week, with access to the building by guided tour only. Guided tours run four times a day (see website for details), from Wednesday - Sunday, with no tours available on Monday or Tuesday. The gardens are open all day, every day between 10am - 4pm. Garden visit tickets are available, to view the Victorian and Edwardian gardens, as well as access to the hillside parkland walk with beautiful views out over the bay. There is also a French Coffee House on site which is open seven days a week and offers a selection of French pastries, lunch items and a range of hot drinks.

Aida (), also spelled 'Ayda, is a Palestinian refugee camp situated 2 kilometers north of the historic centre of Bethlehem and 1 kilometer north of Beit Jala, in the central West Bank. According to the UNRWA, the camp had a population of approximately 5,498 refugees at the end of 2014. History Named after a famous coffeehouse (maqhah) located on the site in the early 1940s, Aida camp was established in 1950 by refugees from the Jerusalem and Hebron areas, and covered an area of 66 dunams (0.17 square kilometres). At the time, Aida housed 1125 refugees living in 94 tents. The camp came under special hardship during the Second Intifada, when the school sustained severe damage and 29 housing units were destroyed by Israeli military incursions. The Israeli military placed the camp and surrounding areas under curfew, made arrests and even demolished walls between houses in order to bypass the roads in the camp. In one such maneuver, camp resident Huda Hawaja was mortally wounded when Israeli soldiers demolished her doors, and died after there were delays in calling an ambulance due to the military presence. The incident was documented by embedded journalists and broadcast on Channel 2, leading to a public outcry and backlash from the Israeli military against the press. Pope Benedict XVI visited the refugee camp during his Middle East pilgrimage visit to Jordan, Israel and the Palestinian territories in May 2009. He said that the refugees lived in \\"precarious and difficult conditions\\" and that \\"It is tragic to see walls still being erected\\". On 29 October 2015, at dusk, a video filmed on his iPhone by a resident of the Aida Refugee Camp, Yazan Ikhlayel (17), captured a megaphone address made from an Israeli military vehicle during a raid into the camp. The speech warned residents that, if they did not desist from stone throwing they would be gassed to death -children, youths and the aged. Referring apparently to the arrest of Qassan Abu Aker, the speaker added that one of the arrested would be killed as the residents looked on if the throwing did not stop.Megan Hanna,'Israeli soldiers tell Palestinians: ‚ÄòWe will gas you until you die',' Ma'an News Agency 29 October 2015.Sheren Khalel and Abed al Qaisi, 'WATCH: Israeli forces threaten Palestinian refugees over loudspeaker,' Middle East Eye 30 October 2015..'Border cop suspended for threatening to ‚Äògas‚Äô Palestinians,' The Times of Israel, 30 October 2015.Megan O'Toole, ‚ÄòIsraeli officer: 'We will gas you until you die',‚Äô, Al Jazeera,31 October 2015.

The camp contains two schools and no health clinics, although UNRWA has provided assistance for physicians and physiotherapists to provide medical assistance within the camp. Access to water is often disrupted for Aida's residents, and sewerage is poor. The unemployment rate in Aida stands at 43%. Aida is the location of the Al Rowwad Cultural and Theatre Training Center and the Lajee Youth Center, both of which practice cultural and creative forms of resistance. Refugees in Aida camp have practiced predominantly non-violent opposition to the Israeli occupation. The situation for youth in Aida camp was publicised in Flying Home, an illustrated children's book produced by Lajee in 2009.

The incident made national and even international headlines on 21 November 2007, three days before the 2007 Australian Federal election. The retiring Liberal member of parliament representing the federal Division of Lindsay, Jackie Kelly, was forced to explain why her husband, local orthodontist Gary Clark, was caught distributing the pamphlets with four other people. The pamphlets, claiming to be from \\"The Islamic Australia Federation\\", thanked the Australian Labor Party (ALP) for supporting terrorists involved with the 2002 Bali bombings. The scandal On 20 November 2007, an anonymous member of the Liberal Party contacted the assistant secretary of the ALP, Luke Foley, with information that a flyer linking Foley's party with an extremist Islamic organisation was to be distributed in letterboxes throughout the suburb of St Marys by Liberal members. Due to a redistribution of electoral boundaries, St Marys had recently been moved from the safe Labor seat of Chifley into Jackie Kelly's seat of Lindsay. Because of her impending retirement, Lindsay was at risk of falling to Labor. At 6.30pm that night, a group of Liberal members met at a home in Ladbury Avenue, Penrith. A short time later, they left that premises and entered another home across the street. This home was later identified as that of Kelly and her husband Gary Clark. In the meantime, Foley, Labor Senator Steve Hutchins and several party volunteers had organised a \\"sting\\" operation directed from the Log Cabin Hotel in Penrith. As the Liberal members entered the home in Ladbury Avenue, a Labor party member was observing them from a car parked in the street. Another group of Labor volunteers were deployed by Hutchins to St Marys to await further instructions. At 8.40pm, the group meeting in Ladbury Avenue left Kelly's home in three cars and drove to St Marys where they parted ways. Various Labor party members, now also including Hutchins and Foley, followed the group. In Boronia Road, the Liberal party group were approached and photographed by Hutchins and eight of his Labor volunteers as they attempted to distribute the bogus pamphlets. Hutchins immediately identified Jeff Egan, Liberal party power broker and member of the State Executive, also a former deputy mayor of the City of the Blue Mountains. Egan continues to deny he was involved in or had any knowledge of the scam. A short distance away, in Magnolia Street, more Labor operatives had similarly ambushed another group of Liberals led by Clark. Clark was photographed attempting to hide his face behind one of the hoaxed flyers; Egan was also photographed with them. Greg Chijoff, husband of the new Liberal candidate for the seat of Lindsay Karen Chijoff, was also found to be involved.  The pamphlet  The pamphlet claimed to be from \\"The Islamic Australia Federation\\", a non-existent organisation. It strongly urged support for the Labor party in the upcoming federal election and went on to praise the ALP on a number of divisive issues, including: * [forgiving] our Muslim brothers who have been unjustly sentenced to death for the Bali bombings, referring to the Labor party's opposition to the death penalty (in particular Robert McClelland's comments) and the Liberals' argument that this policy supports the Bali bombers themselves * Supporting the construction of a new mosque, as well as the opening of a new mosque in St Marys with the help of local and state government funding * Support for controversial former Grand Mufti Sheik Taj El-Din Hilaly (spelt \\"Al-Hilaly\\") The pamphlet also misspelt Allahu Akbar as \\"Ala Akba\\", with the ALP logo on either side. The logo used was an obsolete one that had been retired after the previous election in 2004. There was also no authorising statement, which all political advertising is required to include.  Response  = Police investigation = The matter was referred by both the Labor and Liberal parties to the Australian Electoral Commission, who in turn referred it to the Australian Federal Police. On 22 March 2008 NSW police confirmed that they had begun legal proceedings over the incident against five men including Greg Chijoff, Gary Clarke and Jeff Egan. = Liberal Party response = Jeff Egan was expelled from the Liberal Party over the flyer, and Gary Clark and Greg Chijoff both resigned their memberships under threat of expulsion. While Egan denied all knowledge of the affair as a deliberate scam, Clark and Chijoff both sent letters of apology to NSW Liberal director Graham Jaeschke in which they claimed their wives were also unaware of the plot. Karen Chijoff also claims she knew nothing of it. This claim was later questioned by senior Liberals. Jackie Kelly spoke about it on radio on 22 November in spite of a party directive not to do so. She said her first instinct when she saw the pamphlet was to laugh because it was a parody of some things that had occurred during the election campaign and compared it to a prank by the satirical comedy team The Chaser. The Prime Minister, John Howard, had to spend part of his last pre-election public address to the National Press Club on 22 November answering questions about the scandal rather than discussing his policies. He said that the Liberal Party had not authorised the leaflets, Howard was quoted as saying, \\"What more can I do? I have condemned it. I've dissociated myself from it. I think it's stupid, it's offensive, it's wrong, it's untrue. For heaven's sake, get a sense of proportion.\\" = ALP response = Labor leader Kevin Rudd said the bogus election flyer showed that all the Liberal Party had to offer voters so close to the election was desperation and dirty tactics and that the Prime Minister still had questions to answer over the incident. = Muslim community response = The Sydney-based chairman of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Ikebal Patel, said falsification of election material created a further rift between mainstream community and Muslims. The current Mufti of Australia, Fehmi Naji, said \\"When people read stuff like that, they say 'why are we putting up with Muslims?' We want to stop that thought, and show that we can live together and carry out our duty to our country together.\\" It was subsequently reported that Naji was unable to be contacted during the scandal. = Media commentary = Media reports suggested this incident was part of a pattern of deceptive behaviour undertaken by Liberal party members in previous elections. Various materials, including fake how-to-vote cards and pamphlets with the ALP logo, were allegedly produced by Liberal Party members. In response to Kelly's claim that the matter was a \\"Chaser-style prank\\" Chaser member Julian Morrow called the prank \\"ham-fisted\\" and said the pamphlet did not read like a joke. He acknowledged that The Chaser had done a stunt in Mosman that involved claiming a mosque was to be built in the neighbourhood and asking for comments from people on the street. However, he said the aim of their stunt was to reveal the prejudices in the Australian community, not accentuate them in order to try to return the Coalition to government. On the day of the election, Chaser member Chas Licciardello confronted Karen Chijoff in an Osama bin Laden costume he had used previously during the APEC summit and attempted to pass her copies of the flyer. = In Contemporary Art = Australian artist Cameron Hayes depicted the event in his large scale polyptych painting What happens when pretend politicians pretend to be terrorists, 2009-2011, oil on canvas, 167.5 x 345.5 cm overall. Using the fraudulent pamphlet scam as the theme for a multi-layered allegorical figurative painting exploring the nature of Australian politics, false propaganda, racism, media and the fallout experienced by individual Muslim Australians in everyday. The painting was exhibited in 2018 at Ronald Feldman Gallery in New York, USA, and later at the Melbourne Art Fair by Australian Galleries, Melbourne and Sydney in Australia. Tasneem Chopra, a former Curator at the Islamic Museum of Australia and the Immigration Museum, writing \\"The colloquial conflation of Muslim-with-Islam-with ‚Äì refugee-with-terrorist, proposing all labels equate with the same cultural bogeyman as an endpoint, allows for a powerful artistic take down by Hayes of this tired trope of Australian minorities.\\" In 2009 London based filmmaker Sarah Lewis created a short video using detail stills of Hayes' painting and soundscapes. Aftermath Five men were charged over the Lindsay leaflet scandal with distribution of unauthorised electoral material. Chijoff was fined $750 on 7 May. The husband of former Liberal MP Jackie Kelly, Gary Clark, and Jeffrey Egan pleaded not guilty and their cases were adjourned to 27 May. A fifth man who was charged, Robert Mathew Holstein, was fined $500 on 20 May. On 19 May 2009, Clark was found guilty of producing the unauthorised pamphlets and fined $1,100, plus $2,000 in court costs. Egan, however, was found not guilty.\\"Hefty fine in pamphlet scandal\\", The Australian, 20 May 2009 Karen Chijoff threw her husband out of their house because of his behaviour. She also said that her political career was \\"truly over\\" as well, and would look toward rejoining the workforce. However, she did not rule out a return to politics at some stage, declaring it would be up to the Liberal Party to make that decision. Ms Chijoff continues to deny any knowledge of the leaflet campaign. In June 2008, the president of the Labor electorate council in Lindsay alleged that the pamphlets were printed in a Liberal MP's office at taxpayer expense. Earlier, the magistrate in charge of the case suggested that Kelly was involved, though no charges were ever laid against her.

It is oltre (‚Äòbeyond‚Äô) the Po, when considered from the provincial capital Pavia and in general from the rest of Lombardy. Geography View of the Oltrep√≤ Pavese near Val di Nizza Extending over an area of c. , it is roughly triangular in shape, with a base to the north formed by the Po and a southern apex at Monte Lesima (), a mountain of the Ligurian Apennines which is the highest point in the province. To the west it is bounded by the Province of Alessandria (Piedmont) and to the east by the Province of Piacenza (Emilia-Romagna). The territory comprises a plain close to the Po, a hilly section, which rises from the Valle Staffora to the west and from the upper Val Tidone to the east, and a mountainous zone which in addition to Monte Lesima includes the peaks of Monte Chiappo (1700 m) Cima Colletta (1494 m) and Monte Penice (1460 m). The main watercourse is the Staffora; other streams include the Ardivestra, the Versa and the upper part of the Tidone, including part of the Lago di Trebecco reservoir. The principal settlements are Voghera, Casteggio, Broni, Stradella, Santa Maria della Versa, Salice Terme and Varzi. The region became part of Lombardy in 1859. Tourism Though occasionally referred to as the Tuscany of the North of Italy,CNN iReport (2011)Retrieved 13 April 2014... Oltrep√≤ Pavese is relatively unknown abroad. The area offers several attractions: rolling hills, medieval villages and castles, panoramic views, authentic Italian food and local wines. Oltrep√≤ also happens to be the largest wine- producing area of Lombardy (and one of the largest in Italy), specializing in Pinot Nero. The landscape is scattered with vineyards that are freely accessible to hikers and mountain bikers. Gastronomy A well-known speciality of area are the local sparkling wines, whose various levels of carbonation are catogoized into three levels: vivace, frizzante, and spumante. Both reds and whites can be sparkling to various degrees, and can be made in either a dry or sweeter style. The most famous local wine, the Bonarda, is fruity but not sweet, in contrast to Lambrusco, a red sparkling wine which often has higher residual sugar levels. A local, more 'classical' wine is the Buttafuoco, the production of which is restricted to a small area in the North of the Oltrep√≤. A typical sweet red wine of the area is the Sangue di Giuda. A handful of regional spumantes‚Äîoften made in the 'metodo classico' method, which originated in Champagne‚Äîhave been vinted to a standard that qualifies them for DOCG categorization. Regional dishes use the seasonal ingredients like mushrooms and truffles, the local meats of rabbit, wild boar etc. One of typical dishes is the Sunday's \\"pranzo\\" or lunch in which all of the servings of the Italian menu (antipasti, primi, secondi, contorni, dolci) pass by, sometimes even twice. The Oltrep√≤ region is also recognized for its cured meats, such as \\"coppa\\", and even has Varzi salame, which is a protected product, much like Parmesan cheese or Prosecco.

E. Bates. The film stars Rolf Lassg√•rd, Helena Bergstrom (who is married to director Nutley), and Johan Widerberg. Set in Sweden in the mid-1950s, the film was nominated for the 1999 Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot The film begins with a voice over quotation of the verse from the Book of Ecclesiastes which includes the language, \\"for every thing there is a season, and a time for every purpose under heaven\\". After the death of his mother over a decade ago, Olof (Rolf Lassg√•rd), an illiterate farmer, lives alone on his family farm. Olof can't read, so his young friend Erik (Johan Widerberg)‚Äîwho has been a sailor and who claims to have known various American celebrities while staying in the United States of America and to have bedded hundreds of women‚Äîhandles all the business of the farm. One day Olof puts out an ad for a woman in a local newspaper, asking applicants to include a photograph. The beautiful woman from outside of the village responds; Ellen (Helena Bergstrom). As Ellen takes over more and more of the business of the farm, the farmer and the newcomer fall in love. Erik becomes convinced she is a gold-digger who is after Olof's money. Erik and Ellen quarrel, and Erik threatens to 'find out where you come from and who you are.' When he does find out that Ellen is married, he implies to Ellen that he will expose her. Ellen leaves the farm, leaving behind a note to Olof in which she discloses that she is already married, and apologizes for having \\"betrayed his trust\\". She says she must go back and \\"sort things out\\" and closes by saying that she will always love Olof. Olof asks Erik to read the note to him. At first, Erik refuses. When he does read the note, he alters the text by inserting a sentence saying that Erik has repaid some money he borrowed from Olof, and that Ellen has taken the payments for herself. He also omits Ellen's declaration of eternal love for Olof. Erik then announces he is going back to sea, on the SS Andrea Doria, and departs. The ship that later the same year collided with M/S Stockholm and 49 people died. Some time passes, and one day in the fall (the characters are wearing coats and Olof is bird hunting) when Olof is on a road, a passing car stops and from it steps Ellen. Olof has Ellen's note with him, and asks that she read it to him, confessing for the first time that he cannot read. Ellen reads the note, and asks if Olof wants her back. The two are reunited and the film ends.

Bo Widerberg's son Johan Widerberg stars as the boy and Marika Lagercrantz plays the teacher. The original title is taken from the Swedish hymn \\"Den blomstertid nu kommer\\", which is traditionally sung in schools before closing for the summer holiday.

Plot  This film is set in 1943 Malm√∂, when the rest of Europe was embroiled in World War II. It deals with the attraction of a 15-year-old boy Stig to his 37-year old teacher Viola. The film revolves at first around the sexual encounters between Stig and Viola; then, as the plot develops, Stig forms a close friendship with Viola's husband Frank, a hard- drinking salesman who is quite aware of what is going on with his wife but does nothing to prevent it. Meanwhile, Stig's virgin neighbor and schoolmate Lisbet is secretly in love with him. During an outdoor party held outside his house, she says she wants to show something and directs him to his room. As they enter, she locks the room and asks him to close his eyes. She then strips down before him to seduce him into having sex with her. She shows him a hidden condom under the pillow and rag under the bed to soak up any blood since it would be her first time having sex. He doesn't reciprocate her advances and humiliated, she quickly dresses and leaves the room before Stig can explain. The next day at school, Stig hides in a vault box for sports equipment after Lisbet's gymnastics class. He catapults a note towards her with a message for her to approach the box. After reading the note Lisbet encourages her friend to go to the restroom and while she is away, Lisbet joins Stig in the vault. Her friend later leaves the room alone, while Stig and Lisbet get laid inside the vault. Suddenly, the next class uses the vault, entrapping them until the end of that class. As they get out from the vault after that class, it is revealed that they are dating. Stig breaks Viola up, igniting her rage before the class. During a movie class event, Lisbet finds Stig in the janitor room having sex with Viola.

Based on the life of Ellis Humphrey Evans (Huw Garmon), killed in the First World War, the cinematography starkly contrasts the lyrical beauty of the poet's native Meirionnydd with the bombed-out horrors of Passchendaele. The protagonist is depicted as a tragic hero with an intense dislike of the wartime English/British ultranationalism which surrounds him. The film's title is Ellis Evans' bardic name (, \\"blessed peace\\"), under which he was posthumously awarded the Chair at the 1917 National Eisteddfod of Wales. Hedd Wyn won the Royal Television Society's Award for Best Single Drama and BAFTA Cymru Awards in several categories; and was the first Welsh language film nominated for an Academy Award. Plot As the camera pans over the intricate carving on the infamous \\"Black Chair\\", the voice of the Archdruid Dyfed is heard vainly summoning the poet who signs his work with the nom de plume \\"Fleur-de-lis\\" to stand and be chaired. The film then flashes back to 1913. As a farmer's son in the village of Trawsfynydd, Ellis Humphrey Evans composes poetry for local eisteddfodau under the bardic name Hedd Wyn (\\"Blessed Peace\\"). A friend and student minister, William Morris (Arwel Gruffydd), advises Ellis that his verse possesses a passion which better educated poets lack. Therefore, with more work and less womanizing, Ellis could win the National Eisteddfod. Ellis smiles and quips, \\"Where do you think all that passion comes from?\\" Meanwhile, international tensions rise and the British Army installs an artillery range on a local hillside, much to Ellis' annoyance. In August 1914, Britain declares war on the German Empire. Soon afterwards, at a gathering in the village street, an Anglican minister gives a rousing sermon which demands immediate enlistment. Disgusted, William Morris calls the Anglican minister \\"a disgrace to his calling\\", and tells those nearby not to be deceived. In spite of this, several young men from Trawsfynydd join the British Army, including Ellis' friend Griff Jones (Gruffudd Aled). Despite mounting pressure, Ellis refuses to enlist and says that he doesn't think he can kill anyone. As a result, Ellis' fianc√©e, Lizzie Roberts (Sue Roderick), accuses him of being \\"afraid of becoming a man\\". At a fair, Ellis attempts to mend his relationship with Lizzie, only to find that she has taken up with an English soldier. \\"It's nothing personal... I just don't like your clothes.\\" she says coldly. Later, in the village pub, Ellis and Moi Davies (Emlyn Gomer) are giving Griff, who is now in uniform, a send- off. As fellow villagers sing the recruiting song \\"Your King and Country Want You\\" in their honor, Lizzie appears in the pub's doorway. Ellis spots her and begins to loudly sing \\"Myfanwy\\", a song with implications of female betrayal. Sensing Lizzie's distress, her new beau punches Ellis in the face, yelling \\"You're upsetting the lady! Welsh bastard!\\" On a train, Ellis encounters Jini Owen (Judith Humphreys), a young woman who admires his poetry. Noticing her interest in him, Ellis asks for Jini's address and sends her a letter. Soon the two are deeply in love. Simultaneously, Ellis develops a close friendship with Mary Catherine Hughes (Nia Dryhurst), the young woman who is his sister's teacher. He explains to her that, whenever a poem is lacking, he will cast it into the river, and that it will always return to him stronger. On a railway journey with Jini, Ellis encounters two hideously disfigured war veterans. Despite his sympathy for their plight, the soldiers accuse Ellis of cowardice for remaining a civilian. As he and Jini depart, one of the soldiers threatens to mail him a white feather. Ellis quips, \\"You don't have any wings, let alone feathers.\\" Ultimately, Lizzie returns to the village with tuberculosis. After a church service, she informs Ellis that he was right about the war, which is a curse. Later, as Lizzie lies dying, Ellis visits her sickbed and promises to bring her to the National Eisteddfod. Soon afterwards, an official of the draft board arrives at the family farm and takes down the names of Ellis and his brother Bob (Ceri Cunnington), despite the resistance of Ellis' mother (Llio Silyn). As a result, the Crown informs the Evans family that one of their sons must join the British Army. Although 17-year-old Bob longs to enlist instead, Ellis refuses to permit this. Horrified of losing him, Jini pleads with Ellis to let Bob enlist in his place. Enraged, Ellis says that, if Bob were injured or killed, he could never live with himself. With Jini seeing him off, Ellis departs by train to join the Royal Welsh Fusiliers in Liverpool. Despite the insults showered on them by their English-speaking drill sergeant, Ellis and his fellow Fusiliers continue their training in good spirits and are sent to France. Facing what may be his last chance to win the Eisteddfod, Ellis pleads with his platoon commander to send his awdl Yr Arwr (The Hero) via the Army Postal Service. The young officer, who is unable to read Welsh, at first refuses, suspecting the poem to be a coded message to the Germans. Eventually he relents, mails Ellis' submission, and praises him as \\"The Armageddon Poet\\". On 31 July 1917, the Fusiliers go over the top and into the Battle of Passchendaele. Crawling through swampy shell holes filled with corpses, Ellis witnesses his fellow soldiers being shot and blown to pieces around him. At last, he is wounded by shrapnel and crumples to the ground. After hours of lying in no man's land, Ellis is evacuated to an aid post, where he succumbs to his injuries. His parents are devastated when they receive a telegram informing them of Ellis' death. Jini weeps inconsolably as she reads Ellis' last letter, in which her beloved proposed marriage in a poem. Mary Catherine, in a last tribute to her friend, casts the manuscript of Ellis' poem Rhyfel (War) into the river. The Evans family receives another telegram which announces that Ellis' submission has won the National Eisteddfod. To the sound of R. Williams Parry's Englynion coffa Hedd Wyn (Englynion in memory of Hedd Wyn), the chair which Ellis has dreamed of all his life is delivered to his parents' farmhouse, robed in black. Commentary Hedd Wyn has been cited by Kate Woodward of Aberystwyth University as one of \\"a number of films produced for S4C which ... scrutinized the trinity of dynamic tensions that existed between Wales, England and 'Britain'\\". It is described as \\"expressing the feelings of Welsh men who are fighting the British cause in wartime, despite their being at odds with aspects of the conflict and the priorities of a Westminster government....In the film, the war-mongering attitude is synonymous with England and Englishness, and the Welsh and English languages are persistently juxtaposed....[T]he Welsh language is a site of struggle, but by exploring its difference with the English language, it is also a means of defining and strengthening one‚Äôs identity\\". Awards Hedd Wyn was the first Welsh film to be nominated for Best Foreign Language Film, in 1993, at the U.S.-based Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Academy Awards. Its nomination as a film from the United Kingdom - as opposed to Wales - caused controversy. Hedd Wyn's awards include the Royal Television Society's Award for Best Single Drama (1992), Celtic Film Festival's Spirit of the Festival Award (1993), First Prize at the Belgium Film Festival (1994) and a section award at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (1994).

History Following its victory in the Russo-Turkish War 1806‚Äì1812, the Russian empire annexed Bessarabia from the Ottoman Empire. This historical region, which was originally part of the Principality of Moldavia, constitutes most of the territory of modern Moldova. In the early 20th century, Bessarabia briefly gained independence from Russia as the Moldavian Democratic Republic. It entered a union with the Kingdom of Romania, with whom it shares the same language and ethnicity in 1918 and was ceded by Romania to the Soviet Union in 1940. This led to the establishment of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. Flag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.svgFlag of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (1954‚Äì1991) Flag of Moldavian SSR.svgFlag of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic (1952‚Äì1990) Moldavian SSR (renamed to SSR Moldova) then declared its independence from the USSR on August 27, 1991. A conflict between the government of Moldova and a secessionist entity on its territory escalated into a war in 1992, which was stopped by direct intervention of the Russian 14th Army and resulted in the emergence of the internationally unrecognized republic of Transnistria. After the ceasefire, two separate groups of Russian military forces remained in Moldova: a small peacekeeping regiment, which is part of the Joint Control Commission, and the 14th Army, which was tasked with guarding a large Soviet ammunition depot in Cobasna on Transnistria-controlled territory. Evacuation of this depot was eventually stalled and Russian military presence in Moldova continues to this day, against the will of the Moldovan Government. Relations between Moldova and Russia deteriorated in November 2003 over a Russian proposal for the solution of the Transnistrian conflict, which Moldovan authorities refused to accept. In 2006, a diplomatic conflict resulted in the Russian ban of Moldovan wines, damaging the wine industry of Moldova considerably, as Russia remained the largest importer of Moldovan wines by far.

In December 2016, Igor Dodon, the leader of the Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova, was elected to the presidency with a pro-Russian platform, and a promise to identify with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc.

Interpretations The Five Wisdoms are: # TathatƒÅ-j√±ƒÅna, the wisdom of Suchness or Dharmadhatu, \\"the bare non-conceptualizing awareness\\" of ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ, the universal substrate of the other four j√±ƒÅna; # ƒÄdar≈õa-j√±ƒÅna, the wisdom of \\"Mirror-like Awareness\\", \\"devoid of all dualistic thought and ever united with its 'content' as a mirror is with its reflections\\"; This type of wisdom is a transformation of the eighth consciousness, the Alayavijnana. # SamatƒÅ-j√±ƒÅna, the wisdom of the \\"Awareness of Sameness\\", which perceives the sameness, the commonality of dharmas or phenomena. This kind of wisdom is a transformation of the seventh consciousness, the Klistamanas. Through this wisdom, a Buddha sees beyond all superficial differentiations and perceives the fundamental of all things as ≈ö≈´nyatƒÅ or emptiness. Such undifferentiation gives rise to equality for all beings. Hence, it is also understood as the wisdom of equality or impartiality. # ', the wisdom of \\"Investigative Awareness\\", that perceives the specificity, the uniqueness of dharmas. This type of wisdom is a transformation of the sixth consciousness, and is also known as the wisdom of specific knowledge or sublime investigation. # ', the wisdom of \\"Accomplishing Activities\\", the awareness that \\"spontaneously carries out all that has to be done for the welfare of beings, manifesting itself in all directions\\". This type of wisdom is created through the transformation of the five sensory consciousness. The Five Wisdoms \\"emerge through a transformation (parƒÅv·πõtti) of the eight consciousnesses at the moment of enlightenment\\".

J. Fortune. It is notable for poor characterization, and ludicrous plot involving a teenage boy who has to escape the Russians, but seems more worried that his parents might find out he's away. At one point due to his lack of Russian fluency he has to pretend to be deaf and mute, but keeps talking anyway. Plot summary Richard Duffy promised Stephen an uneventful week when the latter's parents went for a week-long trip to Clearwater, Florida, for business. Reasoning if they were not home, they would not receive emergency phone calls or visitors asking for help, the uncle-nephew duo went out for dinner. Yet barely a block from their residence, they were surrounded by 4 heavy-set men who forced them into a limousine, driven directly to an airport runway and made to board a waiting plane, bypassing all normal customs, immigration and security channels. They were flown to Estonia, and transferred to a submarine where a past adversary of Richard, Igor Borisov of the KGB, forced Richard to carry out a secret investigation into a plot by Soviet officials in the highest circle. Igor selected Richard because he could trust few people, and one of his own reliable men had been killed recently. In order to get himself and Stephen safely home, Richard had to agree, and even had to work with the beautiful Natasha Golovina whom Richard had outmanoeuvred in the past in Paris. To make things worse, Stephen had to mention Michelle LeBlanc whom he met in the previous story Pursuit of the Deadly Diamonds, arousing Natasha's jealousy. Convinced too that the plot Igor was facing was a threat to his own country and the world as a whole, they undertook feverish trips across the USSR, from Leningrad, to Moscow, to Tashkent, Bratsk, and finally, Odessa. Their assignment was to steal vital documents kept by five men identified as being chief conspirators in the plot.

The game was developed by Radical Entertainment and published by Fox Interactive for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Gameplay Independence Day is a 3D combat flight simulator comprising 13 missions with time limits; failure to complete a mission in the allotted time results in failure. Once the main objective is completed, the timer drops down to 45 seconds to take out the primary weapon. If the timer goes to 0, the primary weapon destroys the level. The game also features portals that transport the player to another area by flying through them; these sub-levels have their own separate objectives that must be completed before the player can return to the main level. At the start of each level the player has the ability to choose which aircraft they wish to fly (the player also has Steve Hiller acting as a wingman that will fly the same type of plane as him). The player starts the game with the F/A-18 Hornet, and additional planes are unlocked mid-level by flying through an icon representing them. These planes are then available to fly the next time the player starts a level. The first 10 levels have at least one plane each, or two if that level has a sublevel as every one also has one plane. Unlockable planes include the A-10 Warthog, Eurofighter Typhoon, F-15 Eagle, F/A-22 Raptor, Northrop YF-23, F-117 Nighthawk, Grumman X-29, and the Sukhoi Su-27. Each plane has its own unique characteristics as measured by speed, agility, durability, and stealth; the last determines how much enemy fire the player attracts. If the player is shot down, whichever plane they were flying is lost and no longer available. If the player runs out of planes, the game is over. The game also features multiplayer capabilities, either playing head-to-head on the same console in a split screen mode or with two televisions and two consoles by utilizing the PlayStation Link Cable or Saturn Link Cable. The Windows version also has an online option. Development The PlayStation and Saturn versions of the game were developed simultaneously. Fox Interactive originally announced that the game would be released in late 1997 or early 1998. This was later moved up to November 22, 1996 in order to coincide with the film's release on VHS, only to be subsequently pushed back to February 1997. Reception Independence Day received mixed to negative reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Microsoft Windows version 53.67% based on 3 reviews, the Sega Saturn version 52.50% based on 2 reviews and the PlayStation version 49.00% based on 5 reviews. Most critics remarked that the game is solidly playable, but becomes dry and repetitive due to the lack of variety in the objectives. GameSpot, for example, said that \\"each new challenge is roughly the same as the previous... you fly around, use your radar to locate your targets, lock on, and destroy them with your heat seeking missiles. Each new level brings a sense of deja vu that can make the Eiffel Tower level feel the same as the Grand Canyon [level].\\" Toxic Tommy of GamePro additionally found the gameplay overly cramped due to the boundaries set by the alien mothership, the buildings on the ground, and the surrounding force field, and assessed the game as too easy to provide any longevity for flight combat fans. However, he added that \\"mid-level jet jocks who give this game a chance could find that Independence is worth fighting for.\\" IGN was far more harsh, claiming \\"grainy and undefined\\" graphics and unrealistic physics. Sega Saturn Magazines Matt Yeo agreed that the texture maps are poorly defined, while other critics cited problems with pop up. Yeo and GameSpot both found that while the two-player mode is a fun addition, the split-screen option suffers from slowdown and the link cable option has the usual logistical difficulties of link cable gaming, namely that it requires two televisions and two gaming consoles to be set up in the same house. However, a Next Generation critic found the entire multiplayer concept of the game to be flawed: \\"The only thing more tedious than the one-player game is the two-player game, in which two players (via split-screen or link cable) fly in circles until the words 'target locked' appear on screen. At that point, both players press fire, and the first one to hit wins.\\" Air Hendrix of GamePro summarized that \\"Like the blockbuster movie, ID4 on the Saturn delivers energetic but shallow jet-jockey action.\\" Despite the unfavorable critical response, the game saw strong sales upon release.

His legal career is most remembered for his efforts in the area of water law, his key legal contributions being the \\"Kibbey Decision\\", a legal ruling establishing the principle that \\"water belongs to the land\\", and creation of the legal framework for the Salt River Valley Water User's Association, a model for federal water projects in the American West. As governor, Kibbey was a leader in the effort to prevent Arizona and New Mexico territories from being combined into a single U.S. state. Early life Kibbey was born on March 4, 1853 in Centerville, Indiana to Caroline (Cunningham) and John F. Kibbey. His father was an attorney who had been in a legal partnership with Indiana Governor Oliver P. Morton and served as Indiana Attorney General from March to November 1862. After military service in the American Civil War, the elder Kibbey worked as a trial judge until 1885. The younger Kibbey was educated in public schools before enrolling at Earlham College. After graduation, Kibbey taught school in Arkansas for a year and clerked at a store before he began reading law at his father's law firm in Richmond, Indiana. He was admitted to the bar in 1875 and spent the next thirteen years practicing law at his father's firm. In 1883 he added a term as city attorney to his duties. Kibbey married Nora Burbank, the daughter of Dakota Territory Governor John A. Burbank, on January 10, 1877. The marriage produced two children: Walter and Anna. Associate Justice Health concerns prompted Kibbey to move to Florence, Arizona Territory, in 1888. There he worked as secretary and attorney of the Florence Canal Company, which was owned by a family friend. For the remainder of his career, Kibbey specialized in corporate and water law. In 1889, newly elected President Benjamin Harrison implemented a policy of only appointing residents of the territory to positions in territorial government. While Kibbey was newly arrived in the territory, his family connections were enough to secure his appointment to the bench. His father's influence can be seen in a telegram to Harrison, preserved by the National Archives and Records Administration, stating that \\"Joe prefers the District in which he lives ‚Äì that is Judge Porter's District.\\" Kibbey was nominated by Harrison to become an Associate Justice of Arizona Territorial Supreme Court on August 5, 1889. He was assigned the second district, composed of Pinal, Graham, and Gila counties. During his time as a judge, Kibbey was well respected and gained a reputation for being the least overturned judge to sit on the Arizona bench. He wrote nineteen opinions during his term, dealing with a wide variety of topics. Santa Rita Land and Mining Company v. Mercer, 3 Arizona 181 (1890) determined that the territorial appellate courts would not hear issues not previously raised during trial in a district court. Putnam v. Putnam, 3 Arizona 195 (1890), Tietjen v. Sneed, 3 Arizona 195 (1890), and Wores v. Preston, 4 Arizona 92 (1893) dealt with other procedural issues. Yavapai County v. O'Neill, 3 Arizona 363 (1892) and Behan v. Davis', 3 Arizona 399 (1892) both involved pay disputes. The former dealt with Sheriff Buckey O'Neill's right to be paid for expenses incurred in the pursuit of his duties, while the former dealt with a salary dispute between Superintendent Johnny Behan and the commissioners of the Yuma Territorial Prison. Kibbey's ruling in Don Yan v. Ah You, 4 Arizona 109 (1893) set an early Arizona precedent in the field of wrongful death claims. Kibbey's most renowned ruling came when he was assigned to Phoenix, where he heard Wormser et al v. Salt River Canal Company, Case No. 708 (1892), Federal District Court for Arizona, 3d Judicial District. The case involved a dispute in which the canal company was accused of treating water from the Salt River as corporate property and delivering it in times of drought to customers with ownership interest in the company in preference to customers who had historically used the water. The ruling, which became known as the \\"Kibbey Decision,\\" established the principle that \\"water belongs to the land\\" and could not be used as \\"floating\\" property to be divided by decision of the canal company. Water rights were thus linked to the various parcels of land where the water was used and not to the owner of land. The role of the canal company likewise became that of a simple delivery agent and water was allocated to the various tracts of land based upon the principle of prior appropriation. The decision was not appealed, and the canal companies instead attempted to ignore the court decision. The Kibbey Decision was later upheld by Arizona Territorial Supreme Court in Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company (1901), 7 Arizona 376 and Thomas Brockman v. The Great Canal Company (1904), 8 Arizona 451. During his time on the bench Kibbey developed a small number of detractors who, as was common for the day, mounted an effort to have the judge removed from the bench. However, the effort failed to gain significant traction. It was instead the inauguration of President Grover Cleveland that led to the judge's removal in August 1893. For the rest of his life Kibbey preferred to be addressed by the title \\"judge,\\" feeling that presiding over a courthouse was a more prestigious position than even his later role as governor. Phoenix After leaving the bench, Kibbey moved to Phoenix and established a private legal practice. Many of his clients were \\"old-righters\\" who believed their water rights had been wrongly taken from them by the local canal companies. During this period the former judge argued a number of cases before the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. Among the more important were Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company (1901), 7 Arizona 376 and Gould v. Maricopa Canal Company (1904), 8 Arizona 429. In addition to his legal practice, Kibbey became politically active. He was elected Phoenix City Attorney in November 1897. This was followed by a later appointment as Assistant District Attorney for Maricopa County. Within the Republican Party, Kibbey was a two-time chairman of the Maricopa County organization and a three time chairman of the territorial central committee. In 1902 he was elected to the 22nd Arizona Territorial Legislature, where he served as minority leader in the upper house. Kibbey was also a delegate to the 1904 Republican National Convention. While living in Arizona Territory, Kibbey had seen devastating floods separated by prolonged droughts. An example of this was the February 1891 Salt River flood, which washed out the railroad bridge at Tempe and caused damage in Phoenix as far north as Jefferson Street. This was followed by a drought that killed livestock, forced a third of the farmland in the Salt River valley out of cultivation, and caused many residents in the area to abandon their homes. To control flood waters and provide water in times of drought, construction of a storage dam was proposed on the Salt River and a suitable site located as early as 1889. There was, however, no source within the territory capable of financing the estimated US$2‚Äì5 million construction cost. This situation changed on June 17, 1902, with passage of the Newlands Reclamation Act. However, the act required a party of the second part capable of repaying loaned monies and there was no precedent for how such parties were to be organized. To address this requirement, Kibbey helped found the Salt River Valley Water User's Association. As the Association's attorney, it fell to him to write the group's Articles of Incorporation. The articles Kibbey created not only met the legal requirements of the Newlands Reclamation Act but balanced the interests of the Salt River Valley's existing and future residents. The articles and the user's association were so successful that they served as a model for future federal water projects. Governorship Governor Alexander Oswald Brodie appointed Kibbey Attorney General for Arizona Territory on November 19, 1904. He did not hold the position long, as two months later Brodie announced his resignation. Territorial Secretary William F. Nichols was initially considered as a replacement, but Nichols instead recommended Kibbey be appointed governor. President Theodore Roosevelt appointed Kibbey governor of Arizona Territory on February 27, 1905, and he took the oath of office on March 7. When Kibbey entered office, the biggest issue facing Arizona Territory was a proposal to recombine Arizona with New Mexico Territory and admit the combined political unit as a single state. Despite President Roosevelt's support of the proposal, Kibbey swiftly proclaimed his opposition, noting the widespread disapproval of the plan by the citizens of Arizona. The newly sworn-in governor also threatened to resign over the joint-statehood proposal. As the 23rd Arizona Territorial Legislature was in session when he came into office, Kibbey asked the legislature to authorize a special election asking the territory's voters to weigh in on the proposal, but no such election was authorized. When Representative Edward L. Hamilton of Michigan introduced a bill to enact the proposal, the governor then joined with other territorial leaders in lobbying against the joint- statehood bill in the U.S. Congress. The lobbying gained a number of supporters who were able to delay passage of the bill and then insert an amendment calling for a referendum by the voters of both Arizona and New Mexico asking, \\"Shall Arizona and New Mexico be united to form one State?\\". The proposal died in November 1906 when New Mexico voters approved the proposal by a vote of 26,195 to 14,735 but Arizona voters rejected it by a vote of 3,141 to 16,265. Governor Joseph H. Kibbey While Kibbey was generally a supporter of the mining industry, he felt the territory's mines were not paying their fair share in taxes. Proclaiming \\"To pay proper taxes is a duty\\", the governor sought to remedy this situation. His first effort was an attempt to have the assessed value of the mines increased for property taxes. He was unsuccessful in this effort until August 1905, when he asked for the resignation of A. F. Donau from the territorial board of equalization. The day after Donau resigned, a previously unsuccessful proposal to raise the assessed values of the territory's mines from US$4 million to US$14 million was passed. Then during his address to the 24th Arizona Territorial Legislature, Kibbey renewed his call for higher taxes. In the address he noted that while the mines had assessed values of between 3 and 5% of their real values, all other taxed property, with the exception of the railroads, were assessed at 40 to 70% of their real value. During the legislative session, mining interests used their influence to have a bill passed that set the assessed property value for a mine at 25% of the value of the bullion produced by the mine. The mining interests expected that Kibbey would find this assessment value too low and veto the bill. Kibbey instead signed the bill into law, noting it increased tax revenues to the territory and was an improvement over the previous situation. In other matters covered in his address to the 24th legislature, Kibbey called for restrictions on the sale of tobacco and liquor, a prohibition on gambling, limitation of hours of operation for saloons, and a ban on women and girls' working in saloons. These proposals were made primarily as a means of raising the territory's perceived moral situation as part of efforts to gain statehood. During his address to the 25th Arizona Territorial Legislature, Kibbey expressed confidence that Arizona would soon be granted statehood and left further increases in mine taxation to the state legislature. He instead urged creation of a railroad commission in an effort to build a more efficient transportation system. The 25th legislature proved to be highly partisan, with the Democratic-controlled session opposing many of their Republican governor's efforts. The session overrode vetoes to bills eliminating the position of Territorial Examiner and creating a literacy test for all Arizona voters. Another veto override abolished the Arizona Rangers. In their place, each county sheriff was authorized a limited number of \\"ranger deputies\\". The final key veto override involved a bill authorizing territorial schools to segregate \\"African\\" students. President Roosevelt renominated Kibbey for a second term on December 16, 1908. Mining interests and other political opponents delayed confirmation until after Roosevelt left office. When President William Howard Taft took office, he decided to appoint Richard Elihu Sloan and as a result Kibbey left office on May 1, 1909. On his last day in office, territorial employees presented the outgoing governor with a set of cut-glass drinkware, a 254-piece service of silverware, a cherry chest inscribed with his initials, and a gold watch as tokens of their appreciation. Later life Grave-site of Joseph H. Kibbey (March 4, 1853-June 14, 1924) and Nora Burbank Kibbey (1867-1923). After leaving office, Kibbey returned to his private legal practice and also served as counsel for the Salt River Valley Water User's Association. Among the cases he handled was a challenge to the school segregation law he had vetoed. During the initial trial, Kibbey won a partial injunction when the district court ruled the law created a danger to school children forced to cross railroad tracks to reach a new segregated school. By the time the appeal was heard, Arizona had achieved statehood and the Arizona Supreme Court upheld the legality of the school segregation law in Dameron v. Bayless (1912), 14 Arizona 180. Upset over President Taft's actions during Arizona's efforts to gain statehood, Kibbey split from the Republicans and supported the Bull Moose Party during the 1912 elections. In 1916 the former governor was the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate. Kibbey lost his election bid to incumbent Henry Fountain Ashurst. During his later years, Kibbey decided the automobile was firmly established and that he should learn to drive. After taking lessons, he found that he tended to lose control of the vehicle when operating it at the higher speed afforded by third gear. Consequently, he restricted himself to driving in either first or second gear for the rest of his life. Kibbey died in Phoenix on June 14, 1924. He was buried at Greenwood/Memory Lawn Mortuary & Cemetery.

For a successful prediction Cyrus rewarded him with 3000 darics, or 10 talents. This money Silanus carefully preserved throughout the campaign and subsequent retreat, and was very anxious to return with it to his country. Accordingly, when Xenophon consulted him at Cotyora, on the plan which he had formed of founding a Greek colony on the coast of the Euxine, he revealed the project to the Cyreans, and did all in his power to thwart it. On this Xenophon publicly professed to have abandoned the design, and proposed that no one should be permitted to remain behind the rest of the army, or to sail away before it. The latter part of this proposition was most disagreeable to Silanus, who loudly remonstrated against it, but to no purpose, the soldiers threatening to punish him, should they catch him in any attempt to depart by himself.

The movie was filmed entirely on location in Greenland. It was nominated both for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film and for the Palme D'Or at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival. Plot A young teacher, Eva Nygaard (Astrid Villaume), arrives in Greenland from Denmark to surprise her fiance, the Doctor Erik Hals√∏e, but is crushed to find he has not waited for her and he is about to be married to his assisting nurse. Eva travels to a small fishing village to await the next ship back to Denmark. There she enters into a tense and often confrontational relationship with Jens (Poul Reichhardt), a quiet moody Dane who manages a trading company outpost. Meanwhile, Jens is trying to persuade a Greenlander named Pavia (Niels Platou) to become a company fisherman, despite Pavia's fear of alienating his fellow villagers and upsetting the spirit, Qivitoq. After Eva helps Jens treat a boy who has been attacked by dogs, Jens opens to her and realizes he loves her. Before he can tell her, he learns that Pavia in his new boat is in danger. Jens and Pavia's girlfriend, Naja (Dorthe Reimer), travel overland to rescue him, but Jens falls into an icy crevice and is rescued by Pavia instead. In this way, Pavia returns to a hero's welcome in the village. Jens hastens back only to discover he is too late, that the boat that Eva had been awaiting has already sailed. Dejected, Jens goes home and discovers Eva is there waiting for him.

C.\\" Hughes (May 15, 1842 - November 24, 1915) was an American newspaper editor, lawyer, union organizer, and politician who served as the eleventh Governor of Arizona Territory. A Gilded Age Democrat, he was an active supporter of women's suffrage and the temperance movement. Background Hughes was born on May 15, 1842, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Welsh immigrants Samuel and Elizabeth (Edwards) Hughes. The ninth of ten children, which included siblings Samuel, Thomas David Leighton, \\"Street Smarts: N.

At the age of ten, Hughes was indentured to a \\"Calvinist farmer\\". At sixteen, Hughes gained his release and lived in Meadville, Pennsylvania, working his way through a local academy until the start of the American Civil War.Goff p. 141 A strong abolitionist, Hughes attempted to enlist in the Union Army but had difficulty doing so due to generally poor health and his small stature. He did enlist with Company A, 101st Pennsylvania Volunteers for two years before health problems forced him to leave. Returning home, he enlisted in a government machine shop and, after becoming a journeyman, joined the Machinists and Blacksmiths Union #2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.Wagoner p. 310 Once his health recovered, he re-enlisted in the army as a sergeant with Knapp's Pittsburgh Battery stationed at Washington D.C. and served 100 days before the end of the war.Goff p. 142 Following the war, Hughes worked as a machinist, saving money and attending Meadville Theological School and Edinboro State Normal School. For a time, he considered entering the ministry and also studied law.Goff p. 142‚Äì3 He remained active in union activities during this period, helping to form the Ancient Order of United Workmen. Hughes' other union efforts included gathering 7,000 signatures on a petition calling for establishment of an eight-hour day for government workers and founding a Rochdale Plan cooperative store. By 1868, his prominence had grown to the point where he was selected as a speaker for the Columbus, Ohio, meeting of the International Convention of Machinists and Blacksmiths' Union of America and Great Britain. Hughes married E. Josephine Brawley in July 1868. Mrs. Hughes, who was called the \\"Mother of Arizona\\" by Arizona Governor George W. P. Hunt, was a women's suffragist and friend of Susan B. Anthony and Frances Willard. She was also an active member of the temperance movement. The couple had three children: Gertrude, John Titus, and Josephine Mabel. Arizona Health concerns prompted Hughes to move to Tucson, Arizona, in late 1871. Upon his arrival he opened a law practice and was admitted to practice before the district court. In June 1872, Hughes became a member of the city council, was then appointed a probate judge, and in November 1872 was elected county attorney. He was admitted to practice before the territorial supreme court on January 17, 1873, and appointed Attorney General for the territory by Governor Safford on April 15, 1873. In August the same year, Hughes resigned following accusations that he and Judge John Titus had attempted to improperly exert influence over a mine owner.Goff p. 143 This was followed by his appointment as United States court commissioner in the late 1880s and to the Board of Managers to The Chicago World's Fair in 1891.Goff p. 143‚Äì4 Politically, Hughes was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions in 1884, 1888, and 1892. In 1877, Hughes stopped practicing law full-time and began publishing a newspaper that, following a series of name changes, became the Arizona Daily Star. As editor he supported creation of land courts to determine the validity of Spanish and Mexican land grants for land within the territory and pushed for the deportation of the indigenous Apache to Florida swamplands. Hughes consistently opposed liquor and gambling interest while championing the women's suffrage movement. He also advocated creation of savings and loan associations as a means to promote creation of new housing.Wagoner p. 311  Governor of Arizona Territory  He became Governor of Arizona Territory on April 14, 1893. He had liberal views. He wanted to clean up the elections process because voters were being bought with alcohol. He endorsed women's suffrage, the secret ballots, and felt most of the laws in Arizona, such as laws on houses of prostitution, furnishing liquor to minors, punishing adultery, and the following of the Sabbath law, were all being ignored. He wanted the establishment of a board of control for government agencies like the Territorial Prison and the Insane Asylum and also the establishment of a Board of Immigration to encourage business to come to Arizona. Irrigation and the booming lumber industry in Flagstaff was his major priority. He reduced the territorial debt and created a non-partisan board of control. Due to his liberal views, he created several enemies. As a result, he was removed from the office in 1896. He was on the Board of Regents in 1897 and eventually returned to running his newspaper, the Arizona Star. He favored joint statehood with New Mexico in 1904 and 1905. He left the Arizona Star in 1907 after a libel suit was filed against him.  Death  He died on November 24, 1915, in Tucson, Arizona. He is buried in Evergreen Cemetery in Tucson.

Born in Nuremberg, he worked at Bayreuth, Zeitz, and Greiz before settling in Zittau. He was one of the most important keyboard composers of his day, highly esteemed by, among others, George Frideric Handel. A prolific composer of church and secular music, he published several dozen of his works, and others survive in manuscript. However, hundreds more were lost when Zittau was destroyed by fire in 1757, during the Seven Years' War. Krieger's keyboard music places him among the most important German composers of his time.Samuel, Grove. The two published collections, Sechs musicalische Partien (1697) and Anmuthige Clavier-√úbung (1698), contain harpsichord suites, organ toccatas, fugues, ricercars, and other works. Krieger's contemporaries praised his contrapuntal skill, evident in the extant fugues and ricercars. Johann Mattheson was particularly impressed with Krieger's double fugues, remarking that he knew nobody who surpassed Krieger in this form, except Handel. Handel himself admired and studied Krieger's work, even taking a copy of Anmuthige Clavier- √úbung with him to England. Life Zittau in 1744, engraved by Johann Daniel de Montalegre Johann and his older brother Johann Philipp came from a Nuremberg family of rugmakers. Neither are related to Adam Krieger, another Baroque composer. Johann studied with Heinrich Schwemmer (teacher of Johann Pachelbel) at St. Sebaldus, and sang in the choir there for several years. From 1661‚Äì68 Krieger studied keyboard playing with Georg Caspar Wecker. His older brother's development was different, for Johann Philipp studied with a Froberger pupil, Johann Drechsel. However, for about a decade from 1668 the two brothers' lives shared the same course. In 1671 both Kriegers studied composition at Zeitz. In 1672 Johann Philipp moved to Bayreuth and became court organist there. He very quickly rose to the rank of Kapellmeister, and was succeeded as court organist by Johann. In 1677 Johann Philipp was employed as court organist at Halle, and Johann soon became chamber musician at Zeitz, a city some 30 miles away. He then attained the position of Kapellmeister at Greiz (a further 30 miles south from Zeitz). After Count Heinrich I of Greiz died in 1680, Johann worked as Kapellmeister at Eisenberg for a little less than two years. He then moved far to the east, to Zittau, to become director chori musici and organist of the Church of St. John (Johanniskirche) there. He held the post for 53 years, until his death. The Zittau position evidently suited the composer. The church stood in the center of the city and was one of the most important churches of Zittau. It had several organs, providing ample opportunity to experiment. There was no opera house in Zittau, but Krieger's Singspiels were, nevertheless, performed by the pupils of the city's Gymnasium. Soon after getting the Zittau position, Krieger started publishing his music. The first to appear was Neue musicalische Ergetzligkeit, a large collection of arias and songs for one to four voices, published in 1684 in Frankfurt and Leipzig. Keyboard collections, including Sechs musicalische Partien and Anmuthige Clavier-√úbung followed more than a decade later, in 1697 and 1698 respectively, both printed in Nuremberg. Krieger died on 18 July 1735 at the advanced age of 83. According to Johann Mattheson, whose Grundlage einer Ehren-Pforte remains the main source for biographical detail on Krieger, the composer was active until the very end of his life, still performing at a service on 17 July 1735, the day before he died. He outlived his brother by some 10 years: Johann Phillip died in 1725, after spending 45 years of his life in Wei√üenfels, a city in central Germany, not far from the places the two brothers worked at when they were young. The city of Zittau was destroyed in 1757 during the hostilities of the Seven Years' War, the Church of St. John is no longer standing. Among the numerous lost works are all of Krieger's known Singspiels. His older brother's oeuvre also suffered from events that occurred after his death: of some 2,000 cantatas by Johann Phillip, only 76 survive. Works Excerpt from Krieger's Toccata mit dem Pedal aus C, showing a marked North German influence. Krieger's keyboard works comprise the most important part of his surviving oeuvre. The six suites of Sechs musicalische Partien (Nuremberg, 1697) are worthy additions to Central German repertoire of the time and belong to the same tradition as Pachelbel's and Fischer's suites. They employ the standard dance order of allemande, courante, sarabande, and gigue, with additional movements (minuets, gavottes, etc.) added to fill space (as the composer specifies in the preface). Unusually, some of these additional dances are not in the keys of their corresponding suites.Apel 1972, 666‚Äì67. The collection also includes, as the first piece, a Fantasia, which belongs to the type cultivated by Pachelbel. Here, an eight-measure theme returns periodically as a refrain, in a polyphonic texture. Anmuthige Clavier- √úbung (Nuremberg, 1698) was the second collection of keyboard music Krieger published, and it is a much more important work. It comprises 25 pieces: nine preludes, five ricercares, seven fugues, two toccatas, a fantasy, and a chaconne. Ricercares and fugues showcase Krieger's contrapuntal skills which his contemporaries praised. For example, five of the fugues form a sequence in which four subjects are first treated independently (fugues nos. 11‚Äì14), and then appear together in a quadruple fugue (fugue no. 15). Almost all of the ricercars employ inversion, either as an inversion fugue, from the very beginning (nos. 2, 8, and 17), or in a separate section (nos. 3 and 7); ricercar no. 7 has a countersubject that is inverted in the course of the piece.Apel 1972, 663. Non-imitative pieces in the collection also have a fair share of interesting characteristics. The Chaconne in G minor marks the earliest known instance of an eight-bar ostinato pattern, as opposed to the more traditional four-bar pattern. It contains 29 variations, some of which form pairs, and the first setting of the theme returns and is used as a refrain three times. Toccata mit dem Pedal aus C, the last piece in Anmuthige Clavier-√úbung, was described by Willi Apel as \\"perhaps the only developed toccata written in central Germany before Bach.\\" The toccata starts with a pedal solo, which is followed by a chordal section with recitative breaks, a song-like section in 3/4 time, an interlude, and a fugue whose subject is heard in the pedal twice, requiring alternating feet. Sectional organ works with virtuosic use of pedal were common for north German composers, but no central or south German composers attempted such pieces before Krieger. North German influence is also apparent in the other toccata of the collection, Toccata in D minor.Apel 1972, 665. Krieger's preludes are short pieces, free developments of a harmonic or a rhythmic idea, employing fast passagework, short fugatos, etc.Apel 1972, 664. Anmuthige Clavier-√úbung was the last work Krieger published during his lifetime. It was admired by Handel, who took a copy with him to England and later presented said copy to his friend, one Bernard Granville. The latter added the following note to it: > The printed book is by one of the celebrated Organ players of Germany; Mr. > Handel in his youth formed himself a good deal on his plan, and said that > Krieger was one of the best writers of his time for the Organ. A few pieces not included in the printed collections survive in manuscript copies. These include, most importantly, fugues that apparently form a counterpart to ricercar no. 2 from Anmuthige Clavier-√úbung, building on variations of the same subject, and two sets of chorale variations: Herr Christ der einig Gottes Sohn and In dich hab ich gehoffet, Herr. Both contain three sections; the third section of the third set is particularly interesting, as it treats the chorale in 6/8 time and a free rhythm.Apel 1972, 666. Other pieces in manuscript include two fantasias, one in the manner of Pachelbel and one with fugal design, a Fuga with two obbligato countersubjects, a passacaglia (16 variations), a Durezza, a Battaglia, and other works. The non-keyboard part of Krieger's oeuvre comprises vocal works only. Neue musicalische Ergetzligkeit (Frankfurt and Leipzig, 1684) is a large collection of songs for one to four voices. It is divided into three parts. The first contains 30 strophic sacred songs, simple pieces in the Nuremberg tradition. The second contains 34 strophic secular songs, set somewhat more freely and in a more ornamented manner. The third part contains arias from five of Krieger's Singspiels: these pieces are the only surviving fragments of those large stage works. Out of Krieger's 235 known sacred vocal works only 33 survive, mostly cantatas. Distinguishing features of the cantatas include fugal movements with advanced technique, but for the most part the music builds on styles and techniques quite common at the time.

It is located on the east side of Blount Island. History The concept of a Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) was first envisioned during the late 1970s. The initial program, established in 1979, was called the Near Term Prepositioning Force (NTPF). NTPF used existing operational force equipment and supplies to load on available ships belonging to the Military Sealift Command (MSC). These ships were based in Diego Garcia and initial equipment and ship maintenance was done in Naha, Okinawa and Subic Bay Naval Base. The Marine Corps immediately recognized the advantages of prepositioning equipment and seized the opportunity to improve combat readiness. In March 1983, the Commandant of the Marine Corps directed Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany to acquire the assets for the MPF program. MSC leased thirteen ships for the MPF program. The ships were formed into three Maritime Prepositioning Squadrons (MPSRONs). MPSRON 1 and 2 were loaded in Wilmington, North Carolina and MPSRON 3 was loaded in Panama City, Florida. The ammunition for all three squadrons was loaded at Military Ocean Terminal, Sunny Point, North Carolina. Property leased In 1986, the Marine Corps established the Biennial Maintenance Command (BMC) at Blount Island, Jacksonville, Florida on leased from Gate Maritime Properties (GMP) for $11M per year. In 1989, Blount Island Command was established as a subordinate command to Marine Corps Logistics Bases, Albany, Georgia. Overhead picture of BICmd, taken in 1994 Property purchased The lease between GMP and the Marine Corps was due to end in 2004, and in 2000, the Corps stated their intentions to purchase the property when the lease expired. The Marine Corps budget included $115.7 million for the acquisition, but extended negotiations did not result in an agreement. GMP contended that the land was worth between $160 million and $200 million, so in August 2004, the Marine Corps seized on Blount Island (GMP's entire Blount Island holdings) by eminent domain and initially paid $101 million. When land is seized by eminent domain for uses that benefit the public, the government is required to pay landowners \\"just compensation\\", so GMP asked for a jury to decide the land's value. On November 14, 2005, a jury determined that the government must pay $160 million for the parcel.Gibbons, Timothy: \\"Marines to pay $160M for Blount property\\" Florida Times-Union, November 16, 2005 Facility The base falls under the command of the Marine Corps Logistics Command located at Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia. The portion of the Blount Island currently occupied by Blount Island Command began transitioning to become a Marine Corps Logistics Base in 2005. As of 2010, $55 million had been spent on projects to expand capabilities and improve security, including better fencing and gate access. Blount Island offered a variety of advantages not available at any other site, including: * A private slipway with 5 large vessel berths located only from the St. Johns River outlet * Proximity to Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Georgia * Access to a large industrial base and Navy support structure in Jacksonville, Florida. * Over of staging immediately adjacent to the pier and maintenance area. * Overflow staging and maintenance capacity for MPS offload and throughput training. Operation Each Maritime Prepositioning Ship (MPS) can supply a Marine Expeditionary Unit (2,200 members) for 30 days. Ships are loaded with thousands of different items required for logistical support. The vessel then departs Blount Island and journeys to an assigned ocean location, where they await a destination. If the ship is utilized in a mission, it will return to Blount Island to be resupplied and the cycle begins again. Every 36 months, all cargo is offloaded and the ship goes into dry dock. Every piece of equipment is inspected, cleaned and tested. Vehicles are repaired and painted. If upgrades are available, they are applied or items are swapped out. The work is performed by 250 military/government employees assisted by 1,000 civilian contractors. Mission Plan, coordinate & execute the logistics efforts in support of Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) and Marine Corps Prepositioning Program-Norway (MCPP-N) programs. Maritime Prepositioning Force (MPF) The MPF concept provides for rapid deployment of personnel and equipment of a Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF), by aircraft, to link up with prepositioned equipment and supplies embarked aboard forward deployed Maritime Prepositioning Ships (MPS). They do require an airfield for air delivery of MAGTF personnel close to a benign port and/or beach for offload of equipment. MPS have no inherent forcible entry capability; however, they can reinforce amphibious operations. These equipment and supplies reduces strategic lift requirements, reduce force deployment time and provides an immediate, creditable force in time of crisis. Maritime Prepositioning Forces serve as a naval power projection capability that significantly supports the deployment and employment of Naval expeditionary forces worldwide. The three current MPS squadrons, composed of 16 ships, provide a unique, strategic warfighting capability. Employment of MPS assets during Operation Desert Storm, Operation Vigilant Sentinel, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom against Afghanistan and Iraq, and Operation Restore Hope and Operation Continue Hope in Somalia, demonstrated the value of these expeditionary assets. Humanitarian efforts following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and the 2010 Haiti earthquake also utilized the capabilities of the MPF.Gibbons, Timothy: ‚ÄúBlount Island takes on bigger role in Marine logistics‚Äù Florida Times-Union, March 30, 2010 MCPP-N is for the storage, maintenance, and prepositioning of equipment and supplies for a MAGTF. The storage facilities to support the preposition assets are located in the Trondheim region of Norway in six caves and two storage facilities/air stations. Norway provides the logistics infrastructure to support the withdrawal, movement, and recovery of the prepositioned equipment and supplies. Gallery File:United States Navy Ship Pfc. Dewayne T.

Newton is a multiple world champion and triple Olympic medalist. Biography Newton went to Linthorpe Juniors and Boynton Comprehensive in Teesside, and, aged 13, started cycling with Teesside Clarion. He is an alumnus of the University of Teesside in Middlesbrough. Newton first competed in the Commonwealth Games in 1994, winning the silver medal in the Team Pursuit with Tony Doyle, Rob Hayles and Bryan Steel. He was a member of the British Team Pursuit squad which finished tenth at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. The team included Matt Illingworth, Rob Hayles and Bryan Steel. He won the bronze medal in the Team Pursuit at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. He won a silver medal in the Team Pursuit, and the bronze in the Points Race at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. Newton won the silver medal in the Team Pursuit at the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/cycling/3607530.stm He also competed in the Points Race, but failed to finish the race.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/cycling/3594692.stm He won gold in the Team Pursuit at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Despite his focus on pursuing a track career at world class level, Newton's all-round ability has also seen him take many wins in top international amateur road races throughout his career. Newton broke his collarbone on 6 March 2008 when a car door was opened in his path whilst he was training on the road, putting him out of contention for the upcoming World Championships at the end of March.Newton Injured Ahead of Worlds British Cycling 6 March 2008 This put him on the backfoot at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where he contested the points race. Joan Llaneras built up an impressive lead to take the gold, leaving Newton to battle it out with Roger Kluge for silver. A late attack by Kluge left Newton unable to respond, but he was happy to take a bronze medal at his fourth Olympic Games. At the first round of the World Cup Classics series, in Manchester on 1 November 2008, Newton was on top form and dominated the points race. He was the clear winner and won the final sprint to a standing ovation from the crowd. On that night Great Britain won all gold in all 6 events.

Plot Hari Mondal (Om Puri) is a poor farmer who lives in the remote Bengal village of Giripur in Birbhum district with his wife, two sons, brother, an old widowed aunt Kalidashi (Gita Sen) and her daughter Panchi. The movie opens in the mid sixties when the Naxalbari uprising is spreading across Bengal and oppressed farmers are being united by youths who believe in communism and a socialist republic. Hari and his brother Bolai (Noni Ganguly) are Borgadars, land tillers who plough and harvest the crop on land owned by Jotdars. Bibhutibhushan Ganguly (Victor Banerjee) is the young jotdar who has just lost his father and now wishes to employ new laws on his Borgadars ensuring his greatest profit while the poor farmer languishes in poverty. His estate agent Karmakar (Rajen Tarafdar) does most of his dirty dealings on his behalf that include keeping the poor villagers scared and him in command. Hari's sister is about to get married and Hari asks Bibhutibhushan for a loan. Bibhutibhushan asks him to not register his Bargadari rights under the government office in exchange. Hari is naive and moulded under generations of servility and oppression to realise that his basic rights are being squandered, although his younger brother Bolai isn't happy remaining as mere servants to the landlord. Bolai protests on multiple occasions only to be reprimanded by his brother and Karmakar. Bolai and Panchi (Sreela Majumdar) love each other. Over time, as the communist movement gets stronger in the region, Hari Mandal is oppressed under whims and fancies of the Jotdar, that include making him a paid labourer on his own plot of land and sacking his brother from working with him. Bolai is disgusted with the village life and moves to the big city of Calcutta for work. Here, he joins a small-time racket of wagon breakers and eventually becomes a political goon for the city's electoral candidates. Panchi and her mother both move to Calcutta with help from strangers who offer them employment. While Kalidashi gets employed in a middle-class home as the cook and servant for a meager salary, her daughter is trapped with the bait of fancy clothes by a pimp employed by a middle aged Marwari businessman who makes her his mistress. Panchi also seems to enjoy her new life and the luxuries of cosmetics, silk sarees and a huge bed to sleep on. In a poignant scene, before bedding her for the first time, the businessman asks her whether she has ever slept on a bed before. Hari fights his battles alone against the Jotdar and eventually registers a case against him in the district court with help from sympathetic village master (Pankaj Kapoor) and a lawyer who fights his case for free. Although the district magistrate (Jayant Kripalani) is sympathetic and just in his dealing to his cause, the Jotdar uses his muscle to beat up Hari, burn down his house and take away his bullocks thus leaving him helpless to fight. Hari presses on and the case reaches the High Court where his case it is in favour of the Jotdar. Meanwhile, the first leftist communist government is established in Bengal and after years of court battle and a Panchayat election where Hari defeats Karmakar to become the village Panch, he receives his Bargadari certificate‚Äîat the cost of a broken leg, a house, and a brother who is lost forever. Hari comes to look for Bolai in the great metropolis of Calcutta and searches for him fruitlessly before going back to his village. He never gets to know what has happened of his people who came to Calcutta. The audience gets to know that Bolai gets life imprisonment for committing a political murder, Panchi is thrown out of her Sethji's flat when she gets pregnant and is forced to abort the baby and her health deteriorates, she goes into shock and becomes insane and is living on the streets, and Kalidashi dies while working in her master's house, presumably over a broken heart at her daughter's condition, having seen her both as a mistress and a vagabond on the road. Hari himself dies a few months later in 1980.

He was an activist for liberation of Kosovo and because of that most of his life was persecuted by Yugoslavian government. As president of the youth in Lipljan in 1988-1989, he objected the constitution of 1974 by supporting the 1989 Kosovo miners' strike in Kosovska Mitrovica. This was a political step to favour the promptness of Kosovo youth for independence of the land. This act was the cause for many political changes in the Lipljan government causing Jashari to leave Kosovo and ask for political asylum in Germany. During the time in Germany, Yugoslav political twice tried to assassinate him. In March 1998, he left Germany and returned to Kosovo where the war against FR Yugoslavia had started. After his return on April 19, 1999, he was executed in his birthplace, Mali Alas. On the same day, his home was burnt along with all his manuscripts, novels, poetry and documents.

The region is known particularly for its sparkling wines made in the Franciacorta and Oltrep√≤ Pavese areas. Lombardy also produces still red, white and ros√© wines made from a variety of local and international grapes including Nebbiolo wines in the Valtellina region, Trebbiano di Lugana white wines produced with the Chiaretto style ros√© along the shores of Lake Garda. The wine region currently has 15 Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC), 3 Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) and 13 Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations.

Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 410-411 Oxford University Press 2006 History The winemaking tradition of Lombardy dates back to its settlement by Greeks from Athens along the Po river. Archaeological evidence suggest that these settlers traded wine with the Etruscans in nearby Tuscany.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 39 Simon and Schuster 1989 In the late 19th century, the Italian wine writer C.B. Cerletti wrote a book for the French market that described the wines of Italy. Of the wines of Lombardy, he noted that the Valtellina were still being made in a Greek style and the wines of Oltrep√≤ Pavese were the preferred wines of the Milanese.H. Johnson Vintage: The Story of Wine pg 421-422 Simon and Schuster 1989 Climate and geography The climate of Lombardy is varied due to the diverse terrain of the region but is generally considered a \\"cool\\" continental climate. The region is influenced by several geographic features that control the climate and terroir of the land. These include the Alps located in the northern parts of the region near the wine- producing area of Valtellina and the Po River, which runs along the Oltrep√≤ Pavese (whose name means \\"Pavia across the Po\\") and forms most of the region's southern border with Emilia-Romagna. Many wine areas are located near some of Lombardy's major lakes, including Franciacorta near Lake Iseo as well as the Garda Bresciano and Garda Mantovano regions near Lake Garda. To the west of Lombardy is the Piedmont wine region, to the south is Emilia-Romagna and to the east are the Trentino-Alto Adige/S√ºdtirol and Veneto wine regions. Wine regions Lake Garda from near the Garda Bresciano wine region. The Lombardy region consists primarily of 13 wine-producing areas (from north-south) *Valtellina-Located along the Adda River in the Alps *Garda Bresciano-Located along Lake Garda *Valcelepio- Located around the city of Bergamo *Franciacorta-Located along Lake Iseo *Cellatica- Located near Franciacorta in the province of Brescia *Botticino-Located east of Brescia *Capriano del Colle-Located southwest of Brescia *San Martino della Battaglia- Located along Lake Garda south of Garda Bresciano *Lugana-Located along Lake Garda southeast of San Martino della Battaglia *Garda Mantovano-Located along Lake Garda in the province of Mantua *San Colombano al Lambro-Located in the province of Milan along the border with the province of Pavia *Lambrusco Mantovano-Located in the province of Mantua along the border with Emilia-Romagna. Produces Lambrusco wine. *Oltrep√≤ Pavese - Located in that part of the Province of Pavia which lies to the south of the river Po and is bordered by the Emilia- Romagna and Piedmont regions Valtellina Valtellina vineyards are mostly worked by hand. The long stakes next to the vine aid in minimizing the effects of soil erosion and landslides. This northernmost wine region of Lombardy has been producing wine since the 5th century and is found in the valley of Adda River traveling west to east through the Alps. The vineyards in this area are located at high altitudes around 2,500 feet. For most of its history, the Valtellina region's primary market was Switzerland to the north. In recent times it has garnered international attention for being the only major Italian region to focus on the Nebbiolo grape, locally known as Chiavennasca, outside of the Piedmont region. The vineyards of the region are located on the south- facing slopes along the Adda river. The nearby mountain peaks provide protection from cold, harsh winds and help to trap heat in the valley. The stony vineyard soil also retains heat and releases it during the night to warm the vines. This creates an optimum situation which allows the Nebbiolo grape to fully develop its flavors during the long growing season it needs. The steep location of the vineyards makes mechanical harvesting difficult so most vineyards are tended by hand which increases the cost and limits production. Heavy winter rainfall poses the hazards of landslides and soil erosion. The red wines of the Valtellina regions are typically light to medium bodied. The Nebbiolos are noticeably less tannic and acidic than their Piedmont counterparts.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 726-727 Oxford University Press 2006 The Valtellina DOC includes the basic level wines while the Valtellina Superiore DOCG include wines from the more premium locations and must be aged a minimum of two years. The Valtellina Superiore Riserva are reserve-style wines that must be aged for at least four years. Valtellina also produces an Amarone-style DOCG wine known as Sforzato (or Sfursat, Sfurzat as alternate dialect namesRobinson, Jancis, ed The Oxford Companion to Wine 2nd ed, winepros.com.au Sforzato ) made from dried grapes with a minimum alcohol content of 14.5%. The Valtellina grape Rossola nera that is permitted as a minor blending component in the DOC wines of the region is an offspring of Nebbiolo. Another wine grape, Rossolino nero, that is thought to be an offspring of Rossola nera (and such a grandchild variety of Nebbiolo) is also grown in Valtellina.J. Robinson, J. Harding and J. Vouillamoz Wine Grapes - A complete guide to 1,368 vine varieties, including their origins and flavours pgs 701-702, 915-916 Allen Lane 2012 Oltrep√≤ Pavese Croatina wine grapes in a vineyard of the Oltrep√≤ Pavese The Oltrep√≤ Pavese region is responsible for more the half of all wine produced in the Lombardy region as well as two-thirds of its DOC-designated wines. This region along the Po Valley was once a part of the Piedmont but has always had Milan as its primary market. Today it produces a DOCG sparkling wine with its Pinot nero (Pinot noir) grapes and a rose sparkling wine denominated Cruase. In addition to sparkling wines, the Oltrep√≤ Pavese also produces red wines from the Pinot nero, Barbera, Croatina, Uva Rara and Vespolina. There are some small plantings of Cabernet Sauvignon that are starting to appear as varietal wines. The white wines of the region are made from Riesling Italico (Welschriesling), Riesling (Riesling Renano), Chardonnay, Cortese, Malvasia, Moscato, Pinot grigio and Sauvignon blanc. The Pinot nero grape is also vinified as a rose and as a white, non-sparkling wine in addition to being made as a standard red wine. The sparkling wines of the region are made in several styles. The wines labeled metodo classico are made according to the m√©thode champenoise of the Champagne region. The wines are composed primarily of Pinot nero with up to a 30% blend of Chardonnay, Pinot bianco and Pinot grigio. Slightly sparkling frizzante styles are made from several of the region's red and white wine grapes including the dry Buttafuoco style and the semi-sweet Sangue di Giuda (meaning Judas' blood) both made from the Croatina grape, known locally as Bonarda. The Moscato grape is also made into a frizzante style as well as liquoroso fortified wine and passito dessert wine. Franciacorta Pinot bianco grapes. The Franciacorta wine zone is responsible for some of Italy's most prestigious sparkling wines. Located along the shores of Lake Iseo, vineyards are planted in well-drained morainic soils.J. Robinson (ed) \\"The Oxford Companion to Wine\\" Third Edition pg 284 Oxford University Press 2006 The area has a long history of producing still red and white wines but has gained most of its success in the last 40 years since it started producing sparkling wines. In 1995, the region received DOCG status and created a separate DOC, known as Terre di Franciacorta for its non- sparkling wines. The sparkling wines of this area are composed primarily of the Chardonnay and Pinot bianco grape with a maximum 15% of Pinot nero allowed. The area has a Cr√©mant style wine, known under the trademarked name Sat√®n, that has less carbon dioxide than the standard sparkling wine but is more \\"bubbly\\" than a frizzante. This wine is not allowed to have any Pinot nero in the blend. The ros√© sparklers are required to have a minimum 15% Pinot nero. The vintage-dated wines are required to have a minimum of 85% grapes from the indicated vintage and must be aged for at least 30 months prior to release. Non-vintage wines must be aged for at least 18 months. The Franciacorta sparklers are often a little sweeter than Champagne with the brut style having up to 20 grams per liter of sugar while brut Champagne can have no more than 15 grams. While sparkling wine production accounts for more than half of the Franciacorta area's production, many producers have begun focusing on make red Bordeaux-style blends and Burgundian style Chardonnays aged in oak. Despite the frequent use of Pinot nero in the sparkling wines, a still Burgundian-style red Pinot nero is not permitted under the Terre di Franciacorta DOC. Other wines and grapes The wine regions along Lake Garda are known for their Chiaretto style ros√© wine made from a blend of Barbera, Gropello, Marzemino and Sangiovese. This dry wine is deeper in color than most ros√©s and typically has good acidity with very low alcohol levels. The Rosso (red) style wines are made with the same blend of grapes but in a darker, more full-bodied style. Varietal styles of Gropello are rich and tannic wines. The Lugana white wines are made from the Trebbiano grape and are known for their fruitiness and medium body. White wines from the San Martino della Battaglia are made from the Tocai Friuliano grape, which is best known for its use in the nearby Vento region. The Garda Mantovano white wines are based on Trebbiano and Garganega and its red wines are made from Merlot and Molinara. Other Lombardy region wines include the sweet Moscato Passito from Valcalepio and the light red wines from the Schiava and Barbera grapes in the Cellatica and Botticino region.

By classical physics, there is almost no possibility for protons to fuse by crossing each other's Coulomb barrier at temperatures commonly observed to cause fusion, such as those found in the sun. When George Gamow instead applied quantum mechanics to the problem, he found that there was a significant chance for the fusion due to tunneling. The probability of two nuclear particles overcoming their electrostatic barriers is given by the following equation: : P_g(E) = e^{-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E_g}{E}}} where E_g is the Gamow energy, : E_g \\\\equiv 2 m_r c^2 (\\\\pi \\\\alpha Z_a Z_b)^2 Here, m_r = \\\\frac{m_1 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} is the reduced mass of the two particles. The constant \\\\alpha is the fine structure constant, c is the speed of light, and Z_a and Z_b are the respective atomic numbers of each particle. While the probability of overcoming the Coulomb barrier increases rapidly with increasing particle energy, for a given temperature, the probability of a particle having such an energy falls off very fast, as described by the Maxwell‚ÄìBoltzmann distribution. Gamow found that, taken together, these effects mean that for any given temperature, the particles that fuse are mostly in a temperature-dependent narrow range of energies known as the Gamow window. Derivation GamowQuantum Theory of the Atomic Nucleus, G. Gamow. Translated to English from: G. Gamow, ZP, 51, 204 first solved the one- dimensional case of quantum tunneling using the WKB approximation. Considering a wave function of a particle of mass m, we take area 1 to be where a wave is emitted, area 2 the potential barrier which has height V and width l (at 0), and area 3 its other side, where the wave is arriving, partly transmitted and partly reflected. For a wave number k and energy E we get: :\\\\Psi_1 = A e^{i(kx+\\\\alpha)} e^{-i\\\\frac{E}{\\\\hbar}t} :\\\\Psi_2 = B_1 e^{-k'x} + B_2 e^{k'x} :\\\\Psi_3 = (C_1 e^{-i(kx+\\\\beta)}+C_2 e^{i(kx+\\\\beta')}) e^{-i\\\\frac{E}{\\\\hbar}t} where k = \\\\sqrt{2mE} and k' = \\\\sqrt{2m(V-E)}. This is solved for given A and Œ± by taking the boundary conditions at the both barrier edges, at x=0 and x=l, where both \\\\Psi and its derivative must be equal on both sides. For k'l \\\\gg 1, this is easily solved by ignoring the time exponential and considering the real part alone (the imaginary part has the same behavior). We get, up to factors depending on the phases which are typically of order 1, and up to factors of the order of \\\\frac{k}{k'}=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E}{V-E}} (assumed not very large, since V is greater than E not marginally): :B_1, B_2 \\\\approx A :C_1, C_2 \\\\approx \\\\frac{1}{2}A\\\\cdot\\\\frac{k'}{k}\\\\cdot e^{k'l} Next Gamow modeled the alpha decay as a symmetric one-dimensional problem, with a standing wave between two symmetric potential barriers at q_0 and -(q_0+l), and emitting waves at both outer sides of the barriers. Solving this can in principle be done by taking the solution of the first problem, translating it by q_0 and gluing it to an identical solution reflected around x=0. Due to the symmetry of the problem, the emitting waves on both sides must have equal amplitudes (A), but their phases (Œ±) may be different. This gives a single extra parameter; however, gluing the two solutions at x=0 requires two boundary conditions (for both the wave function and its derivative), so in general there is no solution. In particular, re-writing \\\\Psi_3 (after translation by q_0) as a sum of a cosine and a sine of kx, each having a different factor that depends on k and Œ±, the factor of the sine must vanish, so that the solution can be glued symmetrically to its reflection. Since the factor is in general complex (hence its vanishing imposes two constraints, representing the two boundary conditions), this can in general be solved by adding an imaginary part of k, which gives the extra parameter needed. Thus E will have an imaginary part as well. The physical meaning of this is that the standing wave in the middle decays; the emitted waves newly emitted have therefore smaller amplitudes, so that their amplitude decays in time but grows with distance. The decay constant, denoted Œª, is assumed small compared to E/\\\\hbar. Œª can be estimated without solving explicitly, by noting its effect on the probability current conservation law. Since the probability flows from the middle to the sides, we have: : \\\\frac {\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t} \\\\int_{-(q_0+l)}^{(q_0+l)} \\\\Psi^*\\\\Psi dx = 2\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{2mi}\\\\left(\\\\Psi_1^* \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi_! }{\\\\partial x}- \\\\Psi_1 \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\Psi_1^* }{\\\\partial x} \\\\right) , Note the factor of 2 is due to having two emitted waves. Taking \\\\Psi\\\\sim e^{-\\\\lambda t}, this gives: : \\\\lambda \\\\cdot\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\cdot 2(q_0+l) A^2 \\\\frac{k'^2}{k^2} \\\\cdot e^{2k'l} \\\\approx 2\\\\frac{\\\\hbar}{m} A^2 k , Since the quadratic dependence in k'l is negligible relative to its exponential dependence, we may write: : \\\\lambda \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\hbar k}{m (q_0+l)} \\\\frac{k^2}{k'^2} \\\\cdot e^{-2k'l} Remembering the imaginary part added to k is much smaller than the real part, we may now neglect it and get: : \\\\lambda \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\hbar k}{m 2(q_0+l)} \\\\cdot 8\\\\frac{E}{V-E} \\\\cdot e^{-2\\\\sqrt{2m(V-E)}l/\\\\hbar} Note that \\\\frac{\\\\hbar k}{m} is the particle velocity, so the first factor is the classical rate by which the particle trapped between the barriers hits them. Finally, moving to the three-dimensional problem, the spherically symmetric Schr√∂dinger equation reads (expanding the wave function \\\\psi(r,\\\\theta,\\\\phi) = \\\\chi(r)u(\\\\theta,\\\\phi) in spherical harmonics and looking at the n-th term): :\\\\frac {\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\left(\\\\frac{d^2\\\\chi}{dr^2} + \\\\frac{2}{r}{d\\\\chi}{dr}\\\\right)= \\\\left(V(r) + \\\\frac {\\\\hbar^2}{2m}\\\\frac{n(n+1)}{r^2} -E\\\\right)\\\\chi Since n>0 amounts to enlarging the potential, and therefore substantially reducing the decay rate (given its exponential dependence on \\\\sqrt{V-E}), we focus on n=0, and get a very similar problem to the previous one with \\\\chi(r) = \\\\Psi(r)/r , except that now the potential as a function of r is not a step function. The main effect of this on the amplitudes is that we must replace the argument in the exponent, taking an integral of 2\\\\sqrt{2m(V-E)}/\\\\hbar over the distance where V(r)>E rather than multiplying by l. We take the Coulomb potential: : V(r) = \\\\frac {z(Z-z) k_e e^2}{r} where k_e is the Coulomb constant, e the electron charge, z = 2 is the charge number of the alpha particle and Z the charge number of the nucleus (Z-z after emitting the particle). The integration limits are then r_2 = \\\\frac {z(Z-z) k_e e^2}{E}, where we assume the nuclear potential energy is still relatively small, and r_1, which is where the nuclear negative potential energy is large enough so that the overall potential is smaller than E. Thus, the argument of the exponent in Œª is: : 2\\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\\\hbar} \\\\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{V(r)}{E}-1} \\\\, dr = 2\\\\frac {\\\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\\\hbar} \\\\int_{r_1}^{r_2} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{r_2}{r}-1} \\\\,dr This can be solved by substituting t = \\\\sqrt{r/r_2} and then t = cos(\\\\theta) and solving for Œ∏, giving: :2\\\\cdot r_2\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2mE}}{\\\\hbar} \\\\cdot(\\\\cos^{-1}(x) - \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\sqrt{1-x}) = 2\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2m}z(Z-z) k_e e^2}{\\\\hbar \\\\sqrt{E}} \\\\cdot(\\\\cos^{-1}(x) - \\\\sqrt{x}\\\\sqrt{1-x}) where x = r_1/r_2. Since x is small, the x-dependent factor is of order 1. Gamow assumed x\\\\ll 1, thus replacing the x-dependent factor by \\\\pi / 2, giving: \\\\lambda \\\\sim e^{-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{E_g}{E}}} with: :E_g = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi^2m \\\\left[z(Z-z) k_e e^2\\\\right]^2}{\\\\hbar^2} which is the same as the formula given in the beginning of the article with Z_a=z, Z_b=Z-z and the fine structure constant \\\\alpha = \\\\frac{k_e e^2}{\\\\hbar c}. For a radium alpha decay, Z = 88, z = 2 and m = 4mp, EG is approximately 50 GeV. Gamow calculated the slope of \\\\log(\\\\lambda) with respect to E at an energy of 5 MeV to be ~1014 joule‚àí1, compared to the experimental value of 0.7\\\\cdot 10^{14} joule‚àí1.

Now, the company has five business groups, which are Rail Group, Construction Products Group, Inland Barge Group, Energy Equipment Group and Railcar Leasing & Management Services Group.\\"Trinity Industries Inc (NYSE:TRN) > Description\\", Google Finance review. History Founding The company, first known as Trinity Steel, was founded by C. J. Bender in Dallas in 1933. W. Ray Wallace, an engineering graduate of Louisiana Tech, worked for Dallas's Austin Bridge Company in 1944 before joining the company in 1946 as its seventeenth employee. At the time Trinity Steel manufactured butane tanks in a Dallas County mule barn. In 1958 Trinity Steel merged with Dallas Tank Company, which was also founded in 1933, and Ray Wallace became the new firm's president and first chief executive officer. At the time Trinity had revenues reaching $2.5 million and employed 200 workers. While some employees of the firm in other states eventually unionized, Texas workers never formed a union. For a time the company profited by producing larger tanks that enabled it to enter the petroleum business and do steel fabrication for refineries. In addition, to free up capital, it established an investment company to buy trucks and lease them back to the firm. Nonetheless, by 1957 Trinity faced competition and declines in the petroleum industry. Dallas Tank, Trinity Steel, and Bender-Wallace Development Company merged in 1958 to form Trinity Industries, Incorporated, and went public. 1970s In 1970 Trinity diversified with the acquisition of of land adjacent to the Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport and in 1971 established its first real estate subsidiary. Acquisition of Mosher Steel in 1973, after initially contracting work out to them, enhanced the company's structural business. Among projects completed by the firm's structural division were the Texas Stadium, New York's World Trade Center, the Balboa Bridge in Panama, the Pennzoil Building, and two buildings in Moscow. Although Trinity began fabricating railway tank car bodies as a subcontractor to Richmond Tank Car and Union Tank Car as early as 1966, in 1978 Trinity began producing complete tank and covered hopper rail cars in association with Quick Car of Fort Worth, Texas, which Trinity later absorbed. 1980s By the 1980s two subsidiaries, Gamble's Incorporated of Alabama and Mosher Steel of Texas, manufactured structural products including materials for drilling platforms, highway bridge components, commercial-high-rise buildings, and other girders and beams. The firm's marine subsidiary, Equitable Shipyards, produced LASH or Lighter Aboard Ship barges, riverboats for use by Hilton Hotels, and other craft for industrial uses. Hackney, Incorporated, its metal components subsidiary, produced materials for piping systems. Trinity produced completed railcars, including tank cars, covered and open hoppers, and gondolas to transport chemicals, coal, structural steel and other commodities, at locations in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Longview, Texas, and held two railcar leasing subsidiaries. The company also produced containers for fertilizer, liquified petroleum gas, and nuclear fuel and waste. In 1981 Trinity acquired a metal fabrication firm at Channelview, Texas, and Babcock & Wilcox plants in Elkhart, Indiana, and Koppel, Pennsylvania, and in 1983 it acquired Halter Marine. In 1984 Trinity absorbed Quick Car and acquired the railcar designs and production facilities of the Pullman-Standard Car Manufacturing Company, once the largest railcar manufacturer in North America. That same year Trinity also acquired the railcar designs of General American Transportation Corporation. In 1986 the rail car designs and production facilities of Greenville Steel Car Company were purchased, including the auto rack designs of Portec-Paragon. Also acquired in 1986 were the railcar designs of North American Car Corporation, and in 1987 Ortner Freight Car was acquired. These combined acquisitions made Trinity the largest rail car manufacturer in North America. 1990s \\"In the 1990s expansion continued with the acquisition of the Transit Mix Concrete and Materials Company of Beaumont, Texas, Beiard Industries, Syro Steel and Stearns Airport Equipment of Fort Worth, Texas. By 1993 revenues exceeded $1.5 billion, and the firm employed 13,000 people.\\"Kleiner, Diana J., \\"Trinity Industries\\", Who's Who in America, 1978‚Äì79 via Texas State Historical Association Handbook of Texas Online. In 1998 Trinity acquired the Differential Steel Car Company (DIFCO), which designed and built specialty rail cars. That same year Trinity also opened a rail car production plant in Monclova, Mexico. 2001 In 2001 Trinity Industries acquired the designs and production facilities of Thrall Car Manufacturing Company, then North America's second largest producer of railroad freight cars. 2002-2003 Trinity consolidated its rail car building operations under the name Trinity Rail Group (TRG), and then shortened the name to TrinityRail. June 2006 The company completed the sale of its weld pipe fittings business. August 2006 The company sold its European Rail business to International Railway Systems S.A. December 2006 During the year ended December 31, 2006, it made two acquisitions in the Construction Products Group. April 2007 The company's subsidiary, Transit Mix Concrete & Materials Company, acquired a combined group of East Texas asphalt, ready mix concrete and aggregates businesses operating under the name Armor Materials. Products Rail Group The group manufactures and sells railroad cars (hopper cars, gondolas, flat cars, roll cars, intermodal cars, tank cars, etc.) and component parts. Its customers include railroads, leasing companies and shippers of products. Construction Products Group The group produces concrete, aggregates, highway products, beams and girders used in highway bridge construction. Its customers include contractors and subcontractors in the construction and foundation industry. =Guardrail controversy= In March 2012, Joshua Harman, co-owner of guardrail manufacturing and installation companies SPIG Industry and Selco Construction Services, filed a federal False Claims Act (FCA) suit against Trinity Highway Products, LLC. Trinity manufactures under license the ET Plus System‚Äîa guardrail end terminal system designed by the Texas A&M; Transportation Institute (TTI). Mr. Harman alleged that Trinity did not properly notify the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) in 2005 when Trinity changed the ET Plus√¢ guide channel from five inches to four. Trinity made the modification upon the recommendation of TTI which had successfully crash- tested the product, it was revealed in a series of investigative articles published by television station WPRI-TV in May 2014.Hogan, Susan, \\"Expert: Guardrail flaw putting drivers at risk\\", WPRI 12 Eyewitness News, May 13, 2014.

Link from \\"Guardrail Dangers: Real-Life Cases ...\\" which addresses in part Jay Traylor's case. Reporter Hogan spoke exclusively to Traylor, the double amputee. Retrieved 2017-03-27. Prior to May 18, 2015, FHWA did not expect product submitters to notify FHWA of ‚Äúnon-significant‚Äù modifications if the modification was thought to have no effect on how the device would slow, stop or redirect the vehicle. Harman further alleged that these were cost-cutting changes that resulted in unsafe products being deployed on U.S. highways. Automobile accidents involving the ET Plus System have involved guardrails penetrating vehicles and causing injury to the driver. Lawsuits regarding the guardrails causing injury to motorists were pending in U.S. courts in 2014. In October, 2014, the federal lawsuit resulted in a fraud jury verdict of $175 million which under FCA was tripled to $525 million. In June 2015, the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas certified the verdict and assessed the final penalty at $663 million. Trinity has appealed the case to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. In January 2014, Nevada suspended the use of the guardrails due to Trinity's lack of disclosure. By October 2014, 14 states had suspended new installations of the end terminal. A report by the University of Alabama at Birmingham which examined data from almost a decade of crash reports concluded the ET Plus guardrail end terminal to be nearly three times more likely to result in fatality than the previous version of the end terminal. In January 2015, the FHWA commissioned a peer review of the University of Alabama at Birmingham report. All four reviewers raised concerns about limitations or flaws in the study‚Äôs methodology, which led all of the reviewers to question the validity of the study‚Äôs findings and conclusions. In October 2014, the FHWA issued a memorandum requesting information from state transportation departments regarding the ET Plus performance. In addition, the FHWA requested the guardrail be retested. Trinity voluntarily stopped shipping the ET Plus until the additional crash testing requested by the FHWA could be completed. Up to that point, 42 states had stopped installation of new ET Plus guardrails pending further testing. The company conducted a series of eight crash tests at 27-inch and 31-inch heights to conform to the prevailing standard for guardrails of this type: NCHRP Report 350. After a review by the FHWA and an independent expert, in March 2015 the FHWA announced that the ET Plus¬Æ ET Plus passed all eight crash tests, and that the product remained eligible for federal reimbursement. In March 2015, the Virginia Department of Transportation announced plans to replace ET Plus guardrails. \\"In March [2015], federal officials said the design met safety standards during crash tests.\\" In September 2015, The FHWA and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials published a joint task force report titled, ‚ÄúSafety Analysis of Extruding W-Beam Guardrail End Terminal Crashes.‚Äù The report concluded that there are no unique performance limitations that can be attributed to the ET-Plus, that there are real-world conditions that exceed the performance expectation of all end terminal systems, and that additional crash testing of all existing Report 350-compliant end terminals would be irrelevant and uninformative. The report also cited installation, maintenance and repair as factors affecting product performance. On October 23, 2015, Trinity Highway Products announced that it will resume shipping the ET-Plus \\"after meeting safety standards in crash tests\\" to fill orders as they come in. On September 29, 2017 the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed the District Court and entered judgment in favor of Trinity in United States ex rel. Harman v. Trinity Indus.

It neighbours Maidenahalli, a small village in Madhugiri Taluk, at the north-eastern tip of Tumkur district of Karnataka state, India. This area is a part of the plains of Deccan plateau and borders Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh. It is a patch of grassland with Eucalyptus and Acacia auriculiformis. It has the largest contiguous population of blackbuck (Antilope cervicapra) in Karnataka, apart from Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary.Blackbucks at Jayamangali Blackbuck ReserveBlackbuck at Jayamangali Conservation, KarnatakaBlackbuck running away is it spots human intervention Brief history The open grasslands of peninsular India were once widespread across the Deccan Plateau. Post- independence, however, they have shrunk to isolated patches thanks to immense pressure for cultivation, human habitation and other reasons that also include industrialisation. In 1987, the forest department of Tumakuru Division began protecting the area when the blackbuck‚Äôs presence was brought to their notice. In 1992, after sustained efforts by the forest department, the jurisdiction of the area was handed over from the Revenue Department to the Forest Department. The Forest Department then fenced a portion of the area and raised a nursery. A concrete watchtower was erected along with two wood houses and watchmen sheds. But, the ownership of the land still rested with the revenue department. Tumakuru‚Äôs nature lovers worked hard to have the area granted the status of a Protected Area, like a wildlife sanctuary. The first ever Status Survey report on the area was published by Tumakuru-based Wildlife Aware Nature Club (WANC) in 1997. This helped the wildlife wing of Karnataka Forest Department to source data on this area and recommend it be declared a 'Conservation Reserve'. The Government of Karnataka accepted this proposal. In February 2007, vide Government Order No: FEE 342 FWL 05, of the area was finally notified as Jayamangali Blackbuck Conservation Reserve, (though the original area proposed to be included in this Conservation Reserve was 893 acres). Thus, Tumkur District's first protected area was born. Location This area is located 23 km to the north east of Madhugiri town (Karnataka) and about 20 km to the west of Hindupur town (Andhra Pradesh). The geographical co-ordinates of the forest watch tower inside this area are 13 44‚Äô 20\\" N and 7 19‚Äô 41\\" E. It is located 4 km away from the Jayamangali Blackbuck Conservation Reserve. Climate and vegetation The climate varies greatly according to the seasons- from a minimum of 8 degrees Celsius in winter to a maximum of 43 degrees Celsius in summer. The rainy season is from late June to mid-October. The average rainfall is approximately 300 to 350 mm. The vegetation is mainly plains grassland. Flora and fauna More than 80 species of plants have been recorded from this area. Many of these plants have medicinal value. Butterflies Sixty-seven species of butterflies belonging to seven families have been sighted in the area. Most of the species recorded are common throughout the Indian Peninsula and some are typical of the arid regions. Mammals Jayamangali (Maidanahalli) Blackbuck Conservation Reserve has the second largest contiguous population of blackbuck in Karnataka, after Ranibennur Blackbuck Sanctuary. In total, 19 species of mammals belonging to 11 families have been recorded in the area, including the near threatened blackbuck. The first ever census of Jayamangali blackbuck reserve was jointly conducted by the members of WANC and Karnataka Forest Department in the area on 15‚Äì16 November 1997, during which a population of 408 blackbuck was recorded. A subsequent census was held by the above on 1‚Äì2 October 2002, which revealed a population of over 600 blackbuck. Apart from the blackbuck, other mammals present in the area includes Indian wolf, bonnet macaque, jungle cat, small Indian civet, Indian gray mongoose, two species of bats, the Indian fox, the Indian hare, and six species of rodents. Avifauna About 125 species of birds belonging to 37 families have been recorded in the area, of which 22 are migratory. As expected of grasslands, the area is rich in ground birds, shrikes, larks and raptors. This is one of the few habitats in Tumkur District where the Indian courser (Cursorius coromandelicus) and painted sandgrouse (Pterocles indicus indicus) have been seen. The Montagu's harrier also winters here between the months of November and January. Some of the surrounding villagers claim to have seen the great Indian bustard in the past. Although none of the authors nor any birdwatchers have the bird in the area, efforts are on to sight this highly threatened species. Reptiles Since it is a grassland, it has quite a number of reptiles typical of dry areas/plains. About 26 species have been recorded in the area, including 14 different species of snakes.

He died in Villeta, Cundinamarca on March 19, 1902, in house arrest.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 144, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 He studied law at the University of Cauca in Popay√°n. He graduated in 1837.  Political career  Sanclemente was elected to the position of magistrate of the Supreme Court of Colombia in 1854. During the administration of President Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez, Sanclemente was appointed Secretary of Government and Minister of War, a position that he would serve between April 1, 1857 and July 18, 1861.  Presidency  In 1898, Sanclemente ran for President of Colombia, at 84. The conservative candidates for this election were Sanclemente for president and Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n for vice-president. The Consejo Electoral (electoral commission) certified the results in favor of Sanclemente and Marroqu√≠n on July 4, 1898. They were elected for a six years presidential term. The day of the inauguration, August 7, 1898, Sanclemente was sick and not feeling well enough to take the oath as president. Thus, Vice-President Marroqu√≠n had to take the oath in his place.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 142, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 A few weeks later, Sanclemente notified the Senate that he intended to assume his office as president on November 3, 1898. The Senate, in turn, informed the House of Representatives of his intentions. The House objected to that date but instead proposed November 5 for his inauguration. The childish wrestling by the House was nothing else but to show his displeasure with Sanclemente. The Senate did not agree with the House. Thus, on November 3, Sanclemente expressed that if the House would not assemble with the Senate in a joint session of Congress, he would take his oath before the Supreme Court, as he did. A few days later, the House recognized his inauguration. In October 1899, the Colombian Liberal Party launched an assault, with all its human, political and military power, against the government of Sanclemente, just like the revolution, which Tom√°s Cipriano de Mosquera had launched against the government of Mariano Ospina Rodr√≠guez in 1860. This was the beginning of the tragic and famous civil war known as the Thousand Days War.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edici√≥n, Page 143, Bogot√°, Colombia, 1983 The revolt started in Santander and spread out through the entire country. The principal revolutionary generals of the liberals were Gabriel Vargas Santos, Rafael Uribe Uribe, Benjam√≠n Herrera, Foci√≥n Soto and Lucas Caballero. Defending the government were the conservative generals Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez Valencia, Alfredo V√°squez Cobo, Jorge Holgu√≠n and Pedro Nel Ospina. The civil war lasted for three years, until November 1902, and left thousands dead, millions in monetary losses and a profound resentment among the people. Both sides won and loss many battles, but at the end, the conservative government was triumphant. On July 31, 1900, in the midst of the civil war, the last coup d‚Äô√©tat of the 19th century would take place. President Sanclemente was advanced in years, not in good health and not fully fit to govern the country in the middle of a devastating civil war. While Sanclemente was resting in his summer retreat, in the town of Villeta, a group of influential politicians and highranking military gathered in Bogot√° determined to place him under house arrest. Sanclemente was notified on August 3. Among the military and political leaders that conjured the coup were the future presidents of Colombia Miguel Abad√≠a M√©ndez, Jos√© Vicente Concha and Ram√≥n Gonz√°lez Valencia and Vice-President Jos√© Manuel Marroqu√≠n.

Black Sun Press) The Bridge, first published in 1930 by the Black Sun Press, is Hart Crane's first, and only, attempt at a long poem. (Its primary status as either an epic or a series of lyrical poems remains contested; recent criticism tends to read it as a hybrid, perhaps indicative of a new genre, the \\"modernist epic.\\") The Bridge was inspired by New York City's \\"poetry landmark\\", the Brooklyn Bridge. Crane lived for some time at 110 Columbia Heights in Brooklyn, where he had an excellent view of the bridge; only after The Bridge was finished did Crane learn that one of its key builders, Washington Roebling, had once lived at the same address. The first edition of the book features photographs by Crane's friend, the photographer Walker Evans. Contents The Bridge comprises 15 lyric poems of varying length and scope. In style, it mixes near-Pindaric declamatory metre, free verse, sprung metre, Elizabethan diction and demotic language at various points between alternating stanzas and often in the same stanzas. In terms of its acoustical coherence, it requires its reader, novelly, to follow both end- paused and non end-paused enjambments in a style Crane intended to be redolent of the flow of the Jazz or Classical music he tended to listen to when he wrote. Though the poem follows a thematic progress, it freely juggles various points in time. The University of Illinois' Modern American Poetry website analyses the symbolic meaning of \\"the bridge\\" as central image throughout the book: > When Crane positions himself under the shadows of the bridge, he is, in one > sense, simply the poet of the romantic tradition, the observer who stands > aside the better to see; but he is, in another sense, the gay male cruising > in an area notorious for its casual sex. Even the bridge itself, the > Brooklyn Bridge that is the central object of the poem, was strongly > identified in Crane‚Äôs own mind with [Crane's lover] Emil Opffer, to whom > Voyages was dedicated. The appearance of the bridge secretly encrypts a > highly personal memory and a specific presence in the text. Crane‚Äôs \\"epic of > America\\" gets underway as a personal quest, as a poem divided against > itself, in devotion to an urban setting that encourages social diversity, > with secret inscriptions that retain their meanings to which only a > privileged few are accessible.Modern American Poetry Site \\"Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge\\" is the short lyrical ode to the Brooklyn Bridge and New York City which opens the sequence and serves as an introduction (and New York City's urban landscape remains a dominant presence throughout the book). After beginning with this ode, \\"Ave Maria\\" begins the first longer sequence labeled Roman numeral I which describes Columbus' eastward return from his accidental voyage to the Americas. The title of the piece is based upon the fact that Columbus attributed his crew's survival across the Atlantic Ocean to \\"the intercession of the Virgin Mary.\\" Ellmann, Richard and Robert O'Clair, eds. The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry, 2nd Edition. New York: Norton, 1988. The second major section of the poem, \\"Powhatan's Daughter,\\" is divided into five parts, and one well-known part, entitled \\"The River,\\" follows a group of vagabonds, in the 20th century, who are traveling west through America via train. In \\"The River,\\" Crane incorporates advertisements and references Minstrel shows. He claimed in a letter that \\"the rhythm [in this section] is jazz.\\" The section also includes the story of Pocahontas (who was \\"Powhatan's Daughter\\") and a section on the fictional character Rip Van Winkle. Other major sections of the poem include \\"Cape Hatteras\\" (the longest individual section of the poem), \\"Quaker Hill,\\" \\"The Tunnel,\\" and \\"Atlantis,\\" the rapturous final section that returns the poem's focus back to the Brooklyn Bridge, and which was actually the first part of the overall poem finished despite its reservation for the end. Critical reception Upon its publication, The Bridge received mostly negative reviews. Yvor Winters, a contemporary and friend of Crane's who had praised Crane's previous book, White Buildings, wrote one such review, in which he associated Crane's book with Modernist works by James Joyce and William Carlos Williams. Due to his disparaging views toward Modernism as a whole, Winters viewed such an association negatively. In Winters's own words, The Bridge \\"has no narrative framework and so lacks the formal unity of an epic.\\" Yvor Winter, \\"The Progress of Hart Crane,\\" Poetry 36 (June 1930), 153, 164-65. In a slightly more mixed review, \\"Metaphor in Contemporary Poetry,\\" Cudworth Flint wrote, \\"This poem seems to me indubitably the work of a man of genius, and it contains passages of compact imagination and compelling rhythms. But its central intention, to give to America a myth embodying a creed which may sustain us somewhat as Christianity has done in the past, the poem fails.\\"\\"Metaphor in Contemporary Poetry,\\" The Symposium I:3 (July 1930), 323-324, 334-335. Critical consensus on The Bridge (and on Crane's status in the Modernist canon more broadly) still remains deeply divided.Kirsch, Adam. \\"The Mystic Word. The New Yorker. October 9, 2006. Some critics believe that The Bridge was Crane's crowning achievement, and that it is a masterpiece of American modernism. For instance, Gregory Woods writes that \\"Hart Crane‚Äôs place in the Modernist pantheon is established by The Bridge,\\"Woods, Gregory, \\"Hart Crane.\\" In American Poetry: The Modernist Ideal. Ed. Clive Bloom and Brian Docherty. New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press, 1995. and when the literary critic Harold Bloom placed Crane in his pantheon of the best Modernist American poets of the 20th century, Bloom focused on The Bridge as Crane's most significant achievement, putting it on the same level as T. S. Eliot's The Waste Land, though Bloom regarded Crane as the superior poet, as evidenced in this section from his introduction to Crane's complete poems: \\"But after a lifetime of disliking Eliot's literary and \\"cultural\\" criticism, I have to yield to The Waste Land, because Hart Crane did, though he went down fighting the poem. The glory of The Bridge (1930) is its ambivalent warfare with The Waste Land, without which Crane would not have been the miracle he was.\\".Bloom, Harold. \\"Introduction.\\" The Complete Poems of Hart Crane. New York: Liveright, 2001. Still, the poet/critic Randall Jarrell had much more mixed feelings about the lack of overall consistency in the epic, writing, \\"Hart Crane's The Bridge does not succeed as a unified work of art, partly because some of its poems are bad or mediocre;\\" nevertheless, Jarrell goes on to write, \\"how wonderful parts of The Bridge are! 'Van Winkle' is one of the clearest and freshest and most truly American poems ever written.\\"Jarrell, Randall. \\"Fifty Years of American Poetry.\\" No Other Book: Selected Essays. New York: HarperCollins, 1999. Allen Ginsberg called Atlantis the greatest work in Western metrical rhetoric since Shelley's Adonais. More recently, Jarrell and Flint's criticisms of the poem have been echoed, and even been amplified, by more conservative contemporary poetry critics like Adam Kirsch and William Logan who both wrote highly critical reviews of Crane's work following the publication of Hart Crane: Complete Poems and Selected Letters by the Library of America in 2006. In an article for The New Yorker, Kirsch called The Bridge \\"an impressive failure. . .[that] varies wildly in quality, containing some of Crane‚Äôs best writing and some of his worst.\\" Then Kirsch goes on to call parts of the \\"Atlantis\\" section of the poem \\"exhilarating\\" while he criticizes the \\"Indiana\\" section for being \\"rankly sentimental.\\" From a more positive critical perspective, The Bridge was recently singled out by the Academy of American Poets as one of the 20th century's \\"Groundbreaking Books\\". The organization writes, \\"Physically removed from the city [since he began the piece while living in the Caribbean], Crane relied on his memory and imagination to render the numerous awesome and grotesque nuances of New York, evident in poems such as 'The Tunnel' and 'Cutty Sark.' The book‚Äôs opening, 'Proem: To Brooklyn Bridge,' is indicative of Crane‚Äôs ecstatic, symbolic vision of the modern city. . . However, [because of his suicide in April 1932,] Crane would never again complete anything as complex or compelling as The Bridge.\\"Academy of American Poets' \\"Groundbreaking Books\\" Composition According to the 1988 Voices and Visions PBS documentary on Crane, when Crane first began to write The Bridge, he \\"felt. . .stuck and was incapable of writing more than a few lines.\\" Around this time Crane wrote, \\"Emotionally I should like to write The Bridge. Intellectually the whole theme seems more and more absurd. The very idea of a bridge is an act of faith. The form of my poem rises out of a past that so overwhelms the present with its worth and vision that I'm at a loss to explain my delusion that there exists any real links between that past and a future destiny worthy of it. If only America were half as worthy today to be spoken of as Whitman spoke of it fifty years ago, there might be something for me to say.\\" As the poem began to take shape and showed promise, Crane wrote, \\"The Bridge is symphonic in including all the strands: Columbus, conquest of water, land, Pocahontas, subways, offices. The Bridge, in becoming a ship, a world, a woman, a tremendous harp as it does finally, seems to really have a career.\\"Voice and Visions Series. \\"Hart Crane.\\" Produced by the New York Center for Visual History. 1988.

The album was to be titled Mshasho: You Can't Ignore and was later changed prior to its release date. The album features the first collaboration between The Dogg and his music mentor Elvo. It also features the first collaboration between The Dogg and Qonja. This album is more mature and very different from his previous albums. It features a dark tone similar to his first release, Shimaliw' Osatana. The entire album is self-produced with DJ Kboz co-producing two songs. As of 2008, the album is the highest and fastest selling kwaito album in Namibia. Overview You Can't Ignore is one of Namibia's most highly anticipated kwaito albums of 2007, primarily due to the ongoing rival between The Dogg and Gazza. Gazza created a bigger buzz in 2006, raging from winning the Artist of the Year Award at the Sanlam-NBC Music Awards and touring half of Africa, and in 2007 became the first Namibian artist to release a double album. This was a big step for music in Namibia and many thought Gazza has outshine The Dogg's fame. This album is therefore well known for bringing The Dogg back to his fame. This also proves some hidden lyrical and rhyming skills from The Dogg. During this album The Dogg can be compared to American rapper Nas when he did Stillmatic, an album which many claim resurrected Nas' career after being mocked by Jay-Z. The album has brought The Dogg back to his Kwaito Master status that he sold out on his previous release, Introducing TeeDee. Songs The album has produced hits for the clubs and smooth layback tracks for radio play. The first single \\"Can U Feel It\\" was produced by DJ Kboz and The Dogg and features Tre Van Die Kasie. The song won two awards (best single and song of the year) at the 2007 Sanlam-NBC Music Awards. It also won the most respected African kwaito award, \\"best kwaito video\\" at the 2008 Channel-O Spirit of Africa Music Video Awards.winners of 2008 Channel-O MVA's: The Dogg takes over kwaito2008 Channel O Music Video Awards Nominees 28 July 2008.

He was born at Sant'Angelo in Vado, Marche which was then part of the Papal States.Contardi and Curcio, 1991, pp. 441 - 42; Portoghesi, 1982, p. 373 - 90; Mallory, 1967; Mallory, 1977, pp. 53 - 75 Known primarily for his church of Santa Maria del Rosario in Marino outside Rome, his name has been linked with the design of the fa√ßade of the church of Santa Maria Maddalena in Rome although his involvement with this and with some other building projects remains uncertain. He is not to be confused with the Swiss Italian architect, Giuseppe Sardi (1624‚Äì1699), who was active in Venice.  Career  In contemporary sources, Sardi is described more often as acting in the capacity of a capomastro or master builder rather than as an architect. He designed and executed only one church from scratch, that of Santa Maria del Rosario in 1712 in the Colonna family fiefdom of Marino, in the Alban Hills outside Rome. The interior is centrally planned and has an unusual and elaborately decorated dome. This is also his first known work. His work as capomastro is documented on the building sites of Santa Maria in Trastevere (where he worked under the direction of Recalcati in 1714), Santa Maria in Monticelli (where he worked under the direction of Sassi in 1715, about six years before his conjectured work on San Paolo alla Regola, located around the corner) and at Santissima Trinit√† dei Pellegrini (under the direction of Francesco de Sanctis in 1722 - 23).Contardi and Curcio, 1991 Sardi is also credited with one other minor work, the refurbishment of the baptistery of San Lorenzo in Lucina, executed between 1713 and 1721.Mallory, 1977, pp. 56 - 58 The fa√ßade of S. Maria MaddalenaA detail from the fa√ßade of S. Maria MaddalenaA detail from the fa√ßade of S. Maria Maddalena Although Sardi's name has been connected with several churches in and around Rome, one of the mostly securely attested of his commissions is the addition of a new fa√ßade to the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in the Foro Boario in Rome.Mallory, 1977, pp. 54 - 56 This fa√ßade was erected in place of the previous Romanesque fa√ßade in 1718, and destroyed in 1896 ‚Äì 1899 but its appearance is recorded in Giuseppe Vasi's Magnificenze di Roma (Plate 56) as well as in photographs .Sardi's contribution to this fa√ßade is noted in a contemporary account of the history of the church by Giuseppe Maria Crescimbeni, who as an archpriest of the church was thus in a position to know the architect of the fa√ßade:Mallory, 1977, p. 54 Also confirmed is Sardi's authorship of the fa√ßade of the Trastavere church of Santi Quaranta Martiri (also known as San Pasquale Baylon) (1736‚Äì39).Mallory, 1977, pp. 61 - 66 This fa√ßade appears to have been modelled on that by Francesco Fontana for the church of Santa Maria ad Nives, Rome (Santa Maria delle Neve), located near the Colosseum, and erected around 1708. (reference needed) More contentious are Sardi's contributions to two other churches that had new (or renovated) fa√ßades finished in the period between 1720 and 1740. The first of these projects was the construction of a new fa√ßade for San Paolo alla Regola, a church which had been erected around 1687 to a design of Father Giovanni Battista Bergonzoni (called Borgognone), a teacher of theology at the college attached to the church.Contardi and Curcio, 1999, p. 321 Vasi claims that the fa√ßade was the design of Giovanni Battista Conti,Vasi, 1756, p. 46 while Titi attributes it to 'Ciacomo Ciolli‚Äô (Giacomo Cioli) and Sardi jointly.Titi, 1978, p. 100. Chapter records from 25 August 1721 also mention both men, with Cioli in the role of designer and Sardi in the role of capomastro: Buchowiecki, 1974, p. 536 In sum, there is no scholarly consensus on how exactly the work should be divided. A similar problem concerns the attribution to Sardi of the facade of Santa Maria Maddalena which is significant as one of a limited number of facades in Rome displaying the Rococo style,Armellini, 1887, pp. 323; Buchowiecki, 1974, pp. 307 ‚Äì 25; Bussagli, 2004, pp. 576 ‚Äì 7 and 584; Contardi and Curcio, 1991, pp. 441; Gizzi, 1999, pp. 40 ‚Äì 1; Mallory, 93 ‚Äì 101; Mallory, 1977, pp. xi ‚Äì xii, 67 ‚Äì 74; Mortari, 1987; Pietrangeli, 1977, pp. 38 ‚Äì 40; Portoghesi, 1982, pp. 376 ‚Äì 7; Titi, 1978, pp. 363 ‚Äì 4; Marino, 1992; Varriano, 1986, p. 149; Vasi, 1756, pp. 67 ‚Äì 8 (including Plate 138). The facade was begun in the late seventeenth century and was still unfinished in 1734.The church was built over an extended period, with the major figures including Carlo Fontana (from the early 1670s) and Giovanni Antonio de Rossi, the architect of the Palazzo d'Aste on the Piazza Venezia in Rome. The fa√ßade is attributed in contemporary sources to de Rossi or his successor Carlo Quadri: Contardi and Curcio, 1991, p. 426. Chapter records mention his development of designs for the fa√ßade of the church: Mortari, 1987, p. 27 Work on this design proceeded between 1696 and 1699. This fa√ßade appears to have been undecorated, a fact attested by the hanging of tapestries on this fa√ßade for the patronal festival in 1725 (this would only have occurred with a plain fa√ßade and would be impossible with the decorative scheme currently in place): Mortari, 1987, p. 39. Similarly, a chapter record written by the general of the Ministri degli Infermi, Costantini, in 1734, indicates that the fa√ßade was still unfinished (grezza): Marino, 1992, p. 790. The commencement of the decoration of the fa√ßade is noted in Valesio's diary (21 July 1735), but he does not note the designer: Mortari, 1987, p. 126 Rossini's Mercurio errante (1741) and the 1745 edition of Roisecco's guide book do not mention the designer, although they do draw attention to the fa√ßade.Mallory, 1977, p. 68 The first mention of Sardi's involvement is in the 1750 edition of Roisecco's guide book.Mallory, 1977, p. 68, n. 27 Scholars have long been undecided who should be credited with this design which has also been attributed to Emanuele Rodriguez Dos Santos. Too little of Sardi's work survives to permit attribution on stylistic grounds.Scholars have noted similarities between the style of the decoration of this fa√ßade and some cabinet work of roughly the same period, particularly the organ case of S. Maria Maddalena (designer unknown) and the armoires of the sacristy of S. Maria Maddalena, attributable to Domenico Barbiani. Alessandra Marino has recently suggested that the decoration of the fa√ßade should be attributed to Barbiani and that Emanuele Rodriguez dos Santos (architect of SS Trinit√† dei Spagnoli) should be credited as the architect of the fa√ßade Marino, 1992. In Marino's view, Sardi acted in his usual capacity of capomastro (master builder )  References   Further reading  *Mariano Armellini, Le chiese di Roma dalle loro origini sino al secolo XVI, Rome: Tipografia Editrice Romana, 1887. *Walter Buchowiecki, Handbuch der Kirchen Roms: Die Kirchen innerhalb der Mauern Roms ‚Äì S.

The reliability prediction is generally expressed in FIT (number of failures for 109 hours) or MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures). This guide provides reliability data for RAMS (Reliability, Availability, Maintainability, Safety) studies. Purpose Fides is a DGA (French armament industry supervision agency) study conducted by a European consortium formed by eight industrialists from the fields of aeronautics and Defence: *Airbus France *Eurocopter *Nexter Electronics *MBDA Missiles Systems *Thales Services *Thales Airborne Systems *Thales Avionics *Thales Underwater Systems The first aim of the Fides project was to develop a new reliability assessment method for electronic components which takes into consideration COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) and specific parts and the new technologies. The global aim is to find a replacement to the worldwide reference MIL- HDBK-217F, which is old and has not been revised since 1995 (issue F notice 2). Moreover, the MIL HDBK 217F is very pessimistic for COTS components which are more and more widely used in military and aerospace systems. The second aim was to write a reliability engineering guide in order to provide engineering process and tools to improve reliability in the development of new electronic systems. Method content The Fides guide is made of two distinct parts. The first is a reliability prediction calculation method concerning main electronic component families and complete subassemblies like hard disks or LCD displays. The second part is a process control and audit guide which is a tool to assess the reliability quality and technical know-how in the operating time of the studied product, operational specification and maintenance. Availability The Fides guide is freely available on the Fides reliability website.  Standardization The French standardisation organisation UTE (Union Technique de l'Electricit√©) has accepted the Fides publication, with the reference UTE C 80 811 (available in both French and English). An international normative reference extension (International Electrotechnical Commission) is planned for the future. Future Fides has met great interest and success since the end of the study in 2004. The method has been quickly declared a standard that can be applied to French military programs. For two years, the French military experts of DGA have already used FIDES method in different major programs for Defence, in missiles or tactical telecommunications fields for example. American companies like Boeing, Japanese organisations like JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) as well as French companies or organisations like EDF (Electricit√© de France, French electricity provider) or CNES (Centre National d‚ÄôEtudes Spatiales, the French space agency) showed an interest in FIDES methodology, but none of them are using FIDES at this time. Further developments of the Fides guide (such as the improvement of existing models and the widening of the spectrum covered by component families) resulted in a new version of the Fides guide being published in the middle of year 2009.

Originally described by French naturalist Dominique Villars, its scientific name glauca is derived from the Latin adjective glaucus \\"pale blue-grey\\". Description F. glauca is a clump-forming ornamental grass noted for its glaucous, finely-textured, blue- gray foliage. The foliage forms a dome-shaped, porcupine-like tuft of erect to arching, needle-like 9-ribbed blades, radiating upward and outward to a length of 140‚Äì180 mm. Light green flowers with a purple tinge appear in terminal panicles atop stems rising above the foliage in late spring to early summer, but inflorescences are not very showy. Flowers give way to puffy wheat-like seed-heads. Cultivation F. glauca on sale in a nursery In cultivation F. glauca can reach a height of (inflorescences typically bring total clump height to ). It does best in well-drained soil as plants will not grow well in wet soils. It tolerates dry and low nutrient soils. Plant in a full sun for best foliage colour. It will also grow in a lightly shaded position. Will tolerate drought, neglect and lack of nutrients but prefers regular watering. If plant has a large amount of dead leaves, prune back to 40mm from ground level. This is to be done in winter. Lift and divide clumps if needed (also to be done in winter). Division of established clumps in winter is the easiest method although, plants can be grown from seed. Plants require frequent division as clumps tend to die out in the center and need to be divided, replanted or replaced every 2‚Äì3 years. Plant foliage may decline considerably in very hot, humid summers. Weeds often build up amongst the clumps when used as groundcover and need to be removed by hand. Large areas can be removed by hand or sprayed with Glyphosate herbicide.

Female members of the Miyagi Prefectural Assembly, along with members of the public, claimed that the video was sexually suggestive and demanded that it be taken down. Murai initially defended the video on the grounds that it successfully brought attention to the prefecture, but hundreds of complaints were filed in the month after publication, and he ordered the video withdrawn in August 2017.

A former police officer, he was elected in 2004 as a member of the UK Independence Party but later had the whip withdrawn when allegations of misuse of parliamentary expenses surfaced in The Sunday Telegraph. Following an inquiry carried out by the European Anti-Fraud Office, Wise was formally charged with false accounting and money laundering by Bedfordshire Police. After initially pleading not guilty, he admitted the charges and was sentenced in November 2009 at Southwark Crown Court to a two-year term of imprisonment. He is thought to be the first MEP to be jailed for expenses fraud. Sentencing him, the judge said that Wise had engaged in \\"deliberate and blatant dishonesty\\" and had set about to defraud the European Parliament almost as soon as he was elected. Early career Born in Bournemouth, Wise attended Bournemouth School between 1959 and 1965, before completing a Diploma in Public Speaking in 1967. He served with Dorset Police before embarking on a career in the food distribution and processing industry. He became the UK managing director of a German herbs and spices company. From 1981 to 1989 he was a member of the Liberal Party. Political career UKIP Wise joined the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in 1997. He served as office manager to Jeffrey Titford MEP, during this period he worked on the rules governing MEPs' expenses and gained an expertise in the system which he would later use to his advantage. He was the fourth-placed candidate on UKIP's candidate list in for the European Parliament elections in 1999, and also stood as the party's candidate in the 1997, 2001 and 2005 general elections for the South West Bedfordshire constituency. In the 2005 general election, he came fourth with 4.2% of the votes cast. He was elected as an MEP for UKIP in the 2004 European elections. He was UKIP's official spokesman on the Culture, Youth, Media and Sport Committee until his suspension by the party in February 2007. In his first speech to the Committee on 4 October 2004, Wise criticised the proposed budget and drew allusions with Nazi Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels. In his maiden speech to the Parliament on 16 December 2004, Wise blamed the European Union for creating unacceptable conditions for the transit of animals around Europe. Wise also spoke out against the Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions Independent After losing the party whip in March 2007, Wise continued as an Independent within UKIP's Independence/Democracy parliamentary grouping pending the outcome of the fraud inquiry. During his time as an MEP, Wise disputed the genuine nature of the September 11th attacks. and labelled Russia-based businessman Alisher Usmanov, who is a shareholder of Arsenal F.C. a \\"gangster and racketeer\\" Following the decision to press criminal charges against him, Wise decided not to contest the 2009 European Parliament elections. He did however say that he wanted to stand as an MP in the 2010 General Election. Fraud conviction Exposure On 23 October 2005, a reporter for the Sunday Telegraph, Daniel Foggo, published an article accusing Wise of claiming ¬£36,000 a year from the European Parliament in the name of his researcher, Lindsay Jenkins, while only passing on about a sixth of that amount to her. According to now-repealed rules governing the payment of expenses and allowances to Members of the European Parliament, MEPs could claim up to ¬£125,000 per year for assistants' wages, but this money must be paid either directly to the employees or to a third-party agent. The rules did not allow the funds to pass directly through the hands of MEPs themselves. Foggo later reported that Wise had supplied the European Parliament's Payments Office with a \\"contract\\" including her name and details, which stipulated that the ¬£36,000 allowance should be paid into an account named \\"Stags\\". This account, held with the Co-operative Bank, was in fact Wise's own business account and its full name was \\"T Wise trading as Stags\\". The actual agreement between Wise and Jenkins stated that she would receive monthly \\"retainer\\" payments of ¬£500 for advice and statistical research, with any extra work to be paid on top. Bank documents obtained by Foggo showed that between November 2004 and October 2005, Wise had paid ¬£39,100 to this account, out of which Jenkins received ¬£13,555. These funds were the only monies coming into the account. In another breach of the payment regulations, some of the ¬£13,555 paid to Jenkins represented work done on behalf of other UKIP members, including party leader Nigel Farage who had agreed to fund the publication of a eurosceptic pamphlet by Jenkins. A further ¬£19,000 was transferred from the account, some of which to pay off credit cards. On 29 October, Wise admitted to breaching the rules and, to head off a scandal, agreed to repay ¬£25,230. An internal UKIP inquiry was launched after the Parliament became aware of the affair, but no action was taken and the results of the investigation were kept secret. As Daniel Foggo later reported, UKIP's former leader, Roger Knapman, halted the inquiry after it uncovered serious wrongdoing, believing that the European Parliament would clear Wise. Farage told reporter Daniel Foggo that Wise \\"had committed a simple, silly error by making himself a \\"paying agent\\" for his own staff.\\" Suspension from UKIP On 23 February 2007, party sources at UKIP discovered that the European Parliament had passed the affair to OLAF, the European Anti-Fraud Office. A UKIP meeting was convened in Brussels on 28 February 2007 at which Wise formally admitted to having spent ¬£6,500 from the allowance on a dark green Peugeot 406 which he still drove, but refused to disclose how he had spent a further ¬£13,000 of the funds. After a heated discussion, a decision was taken to remove the whip; both Knapman and fellow MEP Mike Nattrass challenged the decision and threatened to reconsider their futures in the party. Farage emphasised that, if cleared by the OLAF investigation, Wise would be welcomed back into the party, adding that he thought \\"there is a great deal of public sympathy for us.\\" Wise was however suspended by the party. Following his suspension, Wise spent a further ¬£8,000 of the allowance in legal fees in contemplation of a libel case against Greg Lance-Watkins who had published claims on the Internet relating to Wise's activities. No action was ultimately brought against Lance-Watkins. News of the World sting In May 2008, the News of the World published details of a sting involving Tom Wise. A female reporter posing as a work experience student recorded Wise brazenly admitting in a Belgian bar that he had little idea of what his job as a Member of the European Parliament entailed, adding \\"I don't know what an MEP's job is. No one's ever given me a job description. I've no idea what an MEP should or shouldn't do. So you make it up as you go along.\\" He boasted of fiddling the Parliament's expenses system, stating \\"Yes, I am milking the system [...] I have a simple philosophy. You and your parents are paying for me. Sorry, tough!\\" The newspaper used its leading article to call for a change in the rules governing MEPs' expenses following the expos√©. Arrest and charges On 20 June 2008, Wise was arrested by Bedfordshire Police's Economic Crime Unit on suspicion of making a false instrument, obtaining money by deception by transfer and converting criminal property. He was bailed until 29 October. Bedfordshire Police made the arrest after having been contacted by OLAF. On 20 April 2009 the Crown Prosecution Service advised Bedfordshire Police to charge both Wise and Jenkins with one count each of false accounting contrary to the Theft Act 1968 and one count each of money laundering contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. Both were scheduled to appear before the City of Westminster Magistrates' Court in April 2009 to face the charges. Wise indicated that he was innocent and would fight the charges which carry a maximum 14-year jail term. He is thought to be the first MEP to face criminal charges over the misuse of parliamentary funds, and the second former UKIP MEP after Ashley Mote to have faced criminal charges during a parliamentary session. Trial and conviction Wise appeared in court on 27 April 2009 and spoke only to confirm his name and plead not guilty. Jenkins also denied the charges. District Judge Daphne Wickham released both on conditional bail until 8 June. The case was transferred to Southwark Crown Court and charges specified: that Wise and Jenkins \\"falsified a document, namely a contract for provision of services, an application for secretarial assistance allowance and invoices\\". Also, that they used funds \\"received from the European Parliament intended for use as payments for secretarial services.\\" The three-week trial began on 2 November 2009. Judge Geoffrey Rivlin QC heard the prosecution argue that Wise channelled parliamentary funds into an account he secretly controlled so that he could pay credit card debts and buy fine wines. He made separate payments of ¬£2,228 and ¬£1,260 to wine importers, and maintained the deception by asking Jenkins to sign blank documents which he completed later. But for his exposure, Wise would, according to prosecutors, have claimed up to ¬£180,000. On the third day of the trial, just before Nigel Farage was due to give evidence against him, Wise began several hours of negotiations with his legal team after which he changed his plea to guilty and said he was entirely to blame for the fraud. This resulted in Jenkins being acquitted. He was sentenced on 10 November 2009 to two years imprisonment, the sentence having been reduced by one year on account of his guilty plea. In sentencing him, Judge Geoffrey Rivlin declared that: The judge added that, in addition to jail, Wise would also have to pay ¬£30,000 towards the prosecution's costs. Personal life Wise is married to Janet and, until his imprisonment, lived in Linslade near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He has two adult children. Wise has a developed interest in wines, having followed courses arranged by the Wine & Spirit Education Trust and has reached \\"the level just below Master of Wine\\". He has spoken of having a wine cellar containing 1,000 bottles of wine.

It is native to the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada. Description Elymus hystrix is a herbaceous plant with alternate, simple leaves, on erect stems. The flowers are white and bloom in spring. Elymus hystrix ranges from approximately two and a half to four and a half feet in height. There are usually two spikelets at each of the five to nine nodes of the plant. Unlike some similar native grasses, the blades of Elymus hystrix do not have glumes surrounding its spikelets. Elymus hystrix is self-compatible; that is, it can reproduce using its own pollen. Elymus hystrix is a perennial meaning it does not completely die at the end of each season, but comes back the next year. Elymus hystrix has four copies of its genome, exhibiting a type of polyploidy called tetraploidy. Taxonomy Elymus hystrix was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753. It was transferred to the new genus Hystrix as the type species Hystrix patula by Conrad Moench in 1794. Genomic studies from the 1960s onwards showed that it does in fact belong in Elymus. Distribution and habitat Elymus hystrix is found in the United States east of the Great Plains as well as in Eastern Canada. It is usually found in rocky, wet, and partially shaded habitat such as near rivers, creeks, or woods. Elymus hystrix does not grow well in heavily shaded areas and often inhabits the regions on the edge of shaded wooded areas such as forests. Growth of Elymus hystrix appears to be inhibited by excess shade, but is relatively resistant to soil compaction when compared to other herbaceous plant species. Potential as a food crop Mus musculus, or mice, feed on Elymus seeds. It is reasonable that through domestication and enhancement of seed size and nutritional value seeds of Elymus hystrix could be useful for consumption by other vertebrates such as humans. Similar species of grasses are eaten by livestock throughout the United States. Other Elymus species have been found to be high in crude protein when compared to other native grasses, but research is needed to investigate whether specifically Elymus hystrix also exhibits this trait. It is also not immediately evident how nutritious the herbaceous grassy portion of the plant would be to humans, but potential for Elymus hystrix as a food source for livestock is also of interest.

Le naturaliste canadien 113: 317-324 Description Geum canadense is a herbaceous plant with basal leaves that have more than three leaflets and are arranged in a low rosette. Leaves above the basal rosette are alternate, with those placed just above the basal leaves typically trifoliate, and upper leaves usually simple. Basal leaves are a darker green and are often coarsely hairy compared to the lighter green and fine hairs found on upper leaves and stems. In milder climates the foliage is evergreen. Blooming occurs for one to two months in the summer; each flower has five white petals and five green sepals. Flowers are replaced by clusters of long, thin seeds each with a hook on one end that may catch on clothing or animal fur. The flowers resemble those of other members of the rose family such as blackberries and strawberries. The root system consists of a taproot and rhizomes. The plants prefer light shade or partial sun and moist to dry conditions. Somewhat unusually, they are resistant to the phytotoxins released by black walnut trees and so can grow near such trees.

It is commonly grown in shade gardens.  Taxonomy  The binomial name of Chinese astilbe is Astilbe chinensis. The genus name, Astilbe, from the Greek words for \\"without\\" and \\"brightness\\", refers to the dullness of leaves of some species, while the specific epithet refers to the plant's Chinese origin. Chinese astilbe was originally described as Hoteia chinensis by C. J. Maximowiez in 1859. In 1875, Adrien Ren√© Franchet and Ludovic Savatier transferred it to the genus Astilbe. Whether A. chinensis and A. rubra were distinct species or synonyms was a controversial issue for botanists throughout the 20th century, with current consensus favoring the latter interpretation. The plant once known as Astilbe davidii (Franch.) is today regarded as a variety of A. chinensis. Other varieties include A. chinensis var. divaricata (Nakai) and A. chinensis var. pumila (auct.). Description Astilbe chinensis is a herbaceous perennial growing in clumps. The species reaches a height of . The leaves are predominantly basal and ternately compound with sharply-toothed (often biserrated) leaflets. Most leaflets are elliptic to oval in shape and hairy. The mounds of leaves resemble ferns. Flowers are minuscule and form panicles on thin, erect or arching stems.  Distribution  Chinese astilbe was discovered by Richard Maack on 6 July 1855 in the south of modern-day Amur Oblast of Russia and the Chinese region Heilongjiang, and by Leopold von Schrenck the following year. The natural range of Chinese astilbe is Eastern China, Japanese archipelago, and Korea, at altitudes between 400 and 3600 meters. It is found along shaded streams and rivers as well as within and along the margins of damp, open broadleaf forests.  Cultivation  Chinese astilbe is prized for its attractive foliage, plume-like inflorescence in the summer, and dried seed heads afterwards. In 1902, the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society described it as \\"the most important hardy perennial introduced during the past few years\\". Chinese astilbe is usually planted in woodland gardens and shaded parts of herbaceous borders or cottage gardens as groundcover or edging plant. The plant requires partial to full shade, and grows best in soil which is well-drained and rich in organic material. While more tolerant of drought and exposure to direct sunlight than its congeners, the soil must never dry out. Generally resistant to pathogens and herbivores, most problems are caused by high temperatures and drought.

The species is native to tropical parts of the Americas, and has more recently been introduced to North America. It now occurs there from Arizona to Florida and north to Ontario and North Dakota. Like most members of the family, it is a climbing vine with alternate leaves on twining stems. The flowers are blue to rose-purple with a white inner throat and emerge in summer and continue until late fall. The leaves are typically three-lobed, but sometimes may be five-lobed or entire. Flowers occur in clusters of one to three and are 2.5-4.5 cm long and wide. The sepals taper to long, recurved tips and measure 12‚Äì24 mm long. The species shares some features with the close relative Ipomoea purpurea.Miller, J.H., & Miller, K.V. (1999). Forest plants of the southeast and their wildlife uses. Champaign, IL: Kings Time Printing. Ecology The morning glories are little used by white-tailed deer. The large seeds are taken infrequently by northern bobwhite and seed- eating songbirds. Flowers are used by some of the larger butterflies such as swallowtails and fritillaries and the ruby-throated hummingbird. Most of the pollinations of Ipomoea hederacea are achieved by self-pollination, with a selfing rate of 93% observed in one population. Ipomoea hederacea has been studied as a target of character displacement. When it co-occurs with Ipomoea purpurea, natural selection favors individuals of I. hederacea with anthers that are more tightly clustered around the stigma. This is to presumably reduce pollinations of I. hederacea by I. purpurea, which, should they occur, results in sterile seeds, wasting valuable resources of the parent plant and reducing fitness. This fitness reduction is not reciprocal, however, as I. hederacea pollen does not germinate on I. purpurea stigmas, thus giving the latter species a potential advantage competitively. This selective pressure leads the anthers to form a barrier over the stigma of I. hederacea to protect from pollen from other species making contact, but possibly increasing self- pollination, as well. When I. hederacea occurs by itself, however, no such selective pressure is evident and anther barriers are looser and less consistent.

Through its industry initiatives and the euro payment systems it has delivered, the EBA is a key contributor to the creation of a standardised Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA).  History and structure  The Euro Banking Association (EBA) was founded in Paris in 1985 by 18 commercial banks and the European Investment Bank. The European Commission as well as the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) supported the founding of the EBA. Since then, the number of members has risen to almost 200. The institutions come from all member states of the European Union as well as from Norway, Switzerland, Australia, China, Japan, the United Arab Emirates and the United States. In its early years, the agenda of the EBA included the promotion of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the development and management of a private industry ECU clearing system stretching across Europe. For the start of the EMU, the EBA delivered EURO1, a RTGS-equivalent large- value payment system for single euro transactions. The EBA also developed STEP1, a payment service for single euro payments of high priority and urgency for small and medium-sized banks, and STEP2, a Pan-European Automated Clearing House (PE-ACH), which processes euro retail payments. All three payment systems are run by EBA Clearing. As the largest network of payment practitioners with a pan-European mindset and vision, the EBA provides a country-neutral forum for discussing and driving payment initiatives. Based on the support of its unique membership, the EBA contributes to the development and improvement of pan-European business practices in co-operation with regulatory and industry bodies. The communication and explanation of these business practices and other industry developments to its membership and to the wider industry constitute another important part of the EBA‚Äôs mission. Once a year, the EBA brings together its member banks and organisations as well as other stakeholders in the market for a pan-European payments conference entitled EBAday. The association is based in Paris.

He is also known as Hamamatsu Deaf Killer. He was convicted of stabbing to death at least nine people, including several teenagers, in the Shizuoka Prefecture. The book, , which included the subject of the incident, was published in October 2007.  Early life  Seisaku Nakamura was born deaf. He was intelligent, achieving high marks at school, but was treated poorly by his family and was a social misfit. He enjoyed films where men used Japanese swords to assassinate people.  Murders  According to his testimony, on August 22, 1938, he attempted to rape two women; they resisted him, so he murdered them. He was 14 years old at that time. However, the two murders are often excluded from his serial murders. On August 18, 1941, at the age of 17, Seisaku Nakamura killed a third woman and injured a fourth. On August 20, 1941, three more people were found dead, murdered by Nakamura. On September 27, 1941, he murdered his brother, and injured his father, his sister, his brother's wife and his brother's child. On August 30, 1942, he murdered a couple, their daughter, and their son, and attempted to rape another daughter. Information about his crimes were restricted because many thought news about his crimes would cause excessive trouble during the already tense war time, so Nakamura went unapprehended for longer than he might have otherwise. His family knew that he was responsible for the deaths but were afraid of revenge and did not come forward.  Arrest, trial, and execution  He was arrested for nine murders on October 12, 1942. He also admitted two others. On November 11, his father committed suicide. He was tried as an adult under the . The doctors claimed that he was not guilty by reason of insanity.

Biography  Tone ƒåufar was born in Jesenice as the third son of a factory carpenter. Because of his poor health his parents sent him to work as a shepherd with his uncle in Bohinjska Bela. This and the outbreak of the World War I (1914‚Äì1918) meant that he did not attend school regularly and had no formal education. He was eventually trained to be a carpenter in Ljubljana and returned to Jesenice after his training. He joined the Young Communist League of Yugoslavia in 1929. In 1932, he joined the Slovene Social Writers' Club and decided to make a living through writing. He also began working as a journalist and an editor. In 1936, he was arrested and imprisoned in Ljubljana for his activities in the workers' movement. He was sent to Belgrade to serve a one-year prison sentence and lost his citizen's rights for a further five years. He later moved to Maribor and worked for a local newspaper. After the outbreak of World War II, he fled to Ljubljana, where he soon became active in the Slovene Liberation Front. He was arrested by Italian authorities in Ljubljana and sent to the Gonars concentration camp. On 10 August 1942, the authorities moved him and some other prisoners to ≈†entvid near Ljubljana in order to hand them over to the Germans. He tried to escape and was shot.

Ventris entered Jesus College, Cambridge, on 4 July 1660, and like his father then moved to the Middle Temple on 3 February 1664. He was called to the bar on 2 June 1671, his chambers in Fleet Street being above Middle Temple. He was not a success as a pleader and turned to reporting. Ventris produced two volumes of reports which were published in 1696 after his death, they mainly concerned arguments in king's bench and common pleas. Ventris married Margaret Whiting, daughter of Henry a shipowner of Coggeshall, Essex, and of Ipswich, Suffolk. Ventris moved to Ipswich, and in 1681 he became the town clerk and one of three counsels to the corporation. When a new town charter was created in July 1684 he was not named and lost these civic offices. In 1685 Ventris became a justice of the peace for Suffolk in 1685, and in 1687, he inherited extensive properties from his father-in- law.

Taxonomy The species was described by the British ornithologist Walter Rothschild in 1892 under its current binomial name. In a review published in 1950, the American ornithologist Dean Amadon treated the Laysan honeycreeper as a subspecies of the  ªApapane and adopted the trinomial name Himatione sanguinea freethii. Subsequent publications followed this lead. In 2015 the North American Classification Committee (NACC) of the American Ornithologists' Union decided to promote the extinct honeycreeper to the species level and to adopt the original binomial name. This change was adopted by the International Ornithological Committee in their world list of birds. Description Footage of a live specimen from 1923 Nest An adult male Laysan honeycreeper had vermilion upperparts, an ashy-brown lower abdomen and underwing-coverts, and brownish-white undertail-coverts. Adult females were similar to the male, but had paler red feathers. After molting, the feathers were brighter but faded with sunlight exposure. Diet Laysan honeycreepers fed on nectar from the native flowers on the island, especially maiapilo (Capparis sandwichiana). When populations of that species declined, it was forced to feed on nectar from ƒÅkulikuli (Sesuvium portulacastrum) and ihi (Portulaca lutea). It was observed visiting koali awa (Ipomoea indica), p≈çhuehue (I. pes-caprae brasiliensis), and nohu (Tribulus cistoides), and would also feed on caterpillars and moths. Unlike the  ªapapane, the Laysan honeycreeper foraged on the ground. Breeding Laysan honeycreeper primarily nested in the center of tall grass bunches, but sometimes built nests in dense ƒÅheahea (Chenopodium sandwichensis) shrubs. Nests were made of rootlets interwoven with grass blades. The clutch size was four to five eggs. Extinction Domestic rabbits were introduced to the island in the late 19th century, and quickly consumed nearly all vegetation on the island, including nectar sources for the Laysan honeycreeper. The bird was filmed in 1923 during the Tanager Expedition. Shortly after, Laysan was battered by a strong storm, and later attempts at finding any remaining Laysan honeycreeper failed. Other birds also inhabited the island, including the Laysan millerbird, the Laysan rail, the Laysan duck, and the Laysan finch. Of these, only the finch and the duck remain extant.

They gained notoriety as a result of their theatrical live performances inspired by Alice Cooper, which featured sadomasochistic themes. Bitch was the first artist ever signed to Metal Blade Records. History Bitch was formed in December 1980, and played their first show in May 1981 alongside Dante Fox (later to become Great White). Shortly after the band was formed, guitarist David Carruth met Brian Slagel, future CEO of Metal Blade Records, and the two became friends. Slagel was working on a compilation album to tie into a heavy metal fanzine he had started called The New Heavy Metal Revue, and offered to place Bitch on the compilation if they would submit a demo to him. This project would become the landmark compilation Metal Massacre (1982), which would become famous for launching the career of Metallica and for being the first album ever released by Metal Blade Records. Bitch's contribution to Metal Massacre was a demo version of \\"Live for the Whip\\", which would be rerecorded for their debut EP Damnation Alley. Bitch signed for the label and released a self-financed EP titled Damnation Alley (1982). The following year, the group released their first full-length album, Be My Slave. During the tour of the album, Bitch developed their controversial and elaborate stage shows. These included sadomasochistic elements such as bondage clothing and paraphernalia, and the humiliation of a male \\"slave\\" on stage. The band then became a target in the Parents Music Resource Center controversy. The Be My Slave LP was featured on talk shows and in a televised congressional hearing that took place before the United States Senate‚Äôs Committee On Commerce, Science, and Transportation on September 19, 1985. Throughout this time, Bitch played regularly in Sunset Strip clubs like The Whiskey-a-Go-Go, Gazzarri's, The Roxy, and many others, sharing the bill with other metal groups such as W.A.S.P., Slayer and Armored Saint. Due to problems with their management, the group's follow-up album, The Bitch Is Back (1987), was not released until four years after the release of Be My Slave. The Bitch is Back became the band's best-selling album due in part to the publicity created by the P.M.R.C. The band even went as far as thanking Tipper Gore and the P.M.R.C. for \\"keeping our name in the press\\" in the album's liner notes.Bitch The Bitch Is Back (1987) liner notes. In the same year, Betsy Bitch appeared as guest vocalist on a cover of the Tubes' song \\"Don't Touch Me There\\" with Lizzy Borden for Borden's mini-album Terror Rising. The following year, for commercial reasons, the group decided to change their name to \\"Betsy\\" and released a self-titled album by that name in 1988. The sound was more melodic and closer to hard rock. Subsequently, the band produced another EP, A Rose By Any Other Name (1989), a stopgap compilation featuring remixes of previously released songs, unfinished tracks from previous recording sessions, and a song recorded for a tentative new album that was to be entitled Bet-Z (the project was subsequently abandoned). This is the last album released by Bitch to date, but the band has continued to perform on occasion ever since, with their most notable recent live appearance being in 2003 for the Bang Your Head!!! music festival; their performance of \\"Live For The Whip\\" from this appearance is included on the Best of Bang Your Head DVD (2006). Original Bitch drummer Robby Settles died due to complications from leukemia on May 26, 2010. In the years preceding drummer Robby Settles' death, Settles and Electric Prunes guitarist Steve Kara were collaborating on a new album with a lineup featuring original member Betsy Bitch with bassist Steve Gaines of Abattoir, Bloodlust, and Anger as Art and Electric Prunes guitarists Jay Dean and Steve Kara completing the lineup. A second lineup featuring the members of Anger As Art played Germany's Keep it True Festival in April 2011 and some Los Angeles shows. The new lineup, now featuring Scandal West on drums and Chris Cardenas on guitar alongside Betsy and Angelo Espino, debuted at the Rainbow Bar and Grille's 42nd Anniversary Party in support of Great White on April 13, 2014.

It involves an examination of what constructs Australia‚Äôs national identity. This area of scholarship traditionally involves the study of Australian history, society and culture but can be extended to the study of Australian politics and economics. This area of scholarship also includes the study of Australia‚Äôs Indigenous population, Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. Scholarship in Australian studies is offered at many Tertiary Institutions and topics within the field form part of the primary and secondary Australian Curriculum.  Australian history  The study of Australian history involves the exploration of past events and significant people that define Australia‚Äôs present. Scholarship in early Australian history encompasses the history of the Indigenous and colonial societies as well as the history of European colonisation and settlement. The studies of Aboriginal Australian history dates back 65,000 years ago when humans first populated Australia. The exact arrival of Aboriginal Australians has however been a topic of dispute among historians and archaeologists, with the accepted period being between 40,000 and 80,000 years. European colonisation and settlement in Australia in 1788 marks a prominent point in Australia‚Äôs history. Within the study of Australia, there is criticism of the academic portrayal of Australian history. Historians and academics have argued that since European colonisation, Australians of European descent have recounted Australian history to \\"favour the coloniser perspective\\", oppressing the Indigenous Australian perspective.  Australian society and culture  The study of Australian society and culture examines the historical and shifting social makeup of Australia and the resulting dominant cultures. An academic study in this field explores Australian society and culture both before and after European settlement and the migration of global miners to the country. A study of Australia‚Äôs society and culture before European colonisation, consists of Indigenous Australian colonies and their individual cultural beliefs. Post-Colonisation led to a form of \\"Settler Society in the Australian Colonies\\". The cultural study of this society involves an analysis of the interactions between the Indigenous people, European settlers and \\"non-White immigrants\\". A study into Australia‚Äôs cultural shift from Indigenous to predominantly Western culture can be seen as a result of interactions between Indigenous Australians and European settlers. These interactions ranged from civil to violent, with the diseases brought to Australia by the Europeans taking a significant toll on the Indigenous population and culture. Historian Geoffrye Blainey believed, \\"the main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation\\". European settlers had developed some resistance to Smallpox through early exposure, so when the disease broke out in Australia in 1789, these settlers were largely unaffected. However, without previous exposure to the virus, the Indigenous Australia population had no resistance and an estimated 70% were killed. Of the remaining indigenous population, many lost their land and culture when they were forced to resettle on reserves, and thousands of children were removed from their families and placed in institutions, becoming the Stolen Generations, unable to practice their ancestor‚Äôs culture. This resulted in the social makeup of the country dramatically changing, and European culture becoming mainstream. A study into Australia‚Äôs culture post-1980s, largely reflects its British penal history as well as the ‚Äòwaves of migration from elsewhere in Europe and almost every other continent‚Äô. During the colonial era, English literature, Western art and Judeo-Christian religion dominated settler‚Äôs cultural outlook. The Australian gold rushes then encouraged the migration of people from around the world to the Australian continent. This multi-ethnic immigration lead to a series of policies that favoured migrants from British descent such as the White Australia Policy. These were later dismantled by government promotion of multiculturalism, leading to increased migration of European, Asian and Middle Eastern people to Australia. While a study of contemporary Australian culture will still show the British cultural influence as remaining prominent, Australia‚Äôs promotion of multiculturalism has led to other nation‚Äôs influences becoming increasingly prominent.  Australian politics and economics  Australian studies may also involve an analysis of Australian politics and economics. The study of Australian politics involves all aspects of Australia‚Äôs past and present political system. This area of study can be divided into pre and post-federation. Pre-federation, Australia consisted of six British colonies \\"under the law-making of the British Parliament\\". After Federation in 1901, Australia established a \\"federal system of government\\" under the Australian constitution. Studies post-federation focus on Australia‚Äôs political system as a representative democracy. This includes; the democratic system of government, the role of parliament in Australia, government departments, international programs and all government mandated policies and publications. The study of Australian economics encompasses the Australian economy and the past and present economic environments. Within this field of study, common topics include; Australia‚Äôs macro and micro economic structure, policies, trends, governance and the structure of the Australian economy in terms of industry contribution. Also relevant is the history and role of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA). This field of study outlines the role of Australia‚Äôs central bank and banknote issuing authority since the Reserve Bank Act 1959 was passed in 1960.  Indigenous Australian studies  171x171px The scholarship of Indigenous Australian studies involves Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, history and beliefs systems. Australia‚Äôs Indigenous people are made up of two distinct cultural groups; Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Within this field of study, the social and political influence of colonisation and decolonisation on Indigenous Australian groups is analysed. Some Academics believe that within this field of study, there is \\"scant attention paid\\" to how the colonisation process impacted social, economic and cultural experiences of Indigenous Australians today, such as the systemic disparities in health and between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians. Indigenous Australian studies also examines contemporary Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and society. This population is gradually growing from 2.5% of the population of Australia in 2011 to 3.3% in 2016. Since the ‚ÄòClose the Gap‚Äô campaign was launched in 2007, in response to the Social Justice Report 2005, awareness and recognition of Indigenous civilisation and culture has grown significantly.  Australian studies at educational institutions  Australian studies forms part of the Australian national curriculum and is offered by many Australian and international tertiary institutions.  Australian Curriculum  The national curriculum in Australia, Australian Curriculum, is created by the Australian Government Department of Education, Skills and Employment and provides an outline of what students in primary and high school should learn. This outline is regardless of their location within Australia or school system. Within the Australian Curriculum, Australian studies is predominantly taught within the humanities and social sciences. The curriculum also stipulates two cross-cultural priorities that sit within the study of Australia; Asia and Australia‚Äôs engagement with Asia, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander histories and cultures.  Tertiary Institutions  Australian studies is a course offered at many tertiary institutions both within Australia and internationally. The subject can fall under broader disciplines such as Cultural Studies or Political and International Studies.  Institutes   Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies  The Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) is a government-funded institution focused on the \\"diverse history, cultures and heritage\\" of the Indigenous Australian Population. This institute was established under the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013. The institute facilitates the studies and understanding of Indigenous Australians by collecting items of cultural value, conducting research on communities, publishing pieces of work by Indigenous Australians, and facilitating collaborations and partnerships with government, academic, corporate and community sectors.  Australian Studies Institute  The Australian Studies Institute was founded by The Australian National University (ANU). The institute was established to promote the study of Australia as part of its ‚ÄòAustralia and the World‚Äô global engagement program. The institute is led by Professor Paul Pickering and facilitates various global engagement programs with universities and leading cultural institutions. These programs aim to promote the exchange of knowledge, research and resources between people studying Australia-related studies and the institute.

The ship was built by J. & G. Thompson at Clydebank, starting with her keel laying in August 1890. She was launched in March 1892 and commissioned into the Mediterranean Fleet as flagship the following October. She was armed with a main battery of four 13.5-inch guns and a secondary battery of ten 6-inch guns. The ship had a top speed of 16.5 knots. Ramillies served as flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet up to 1899, and again from 1900 to 1902. After taking part in manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal, she returned to England for a refit in 1903. Upon completion, she was commissioned into the Reserve in 1905. She suffered damage while participating in combined manoeuvres the following year, and was recommissioned into the Special Service Division of the Home Fleet in 1907, becoming the Parent Ship of the 4th Division of the Home Fleet in 1910. She was relieved of that role a year later, before being reduced to material reserve at Devonport in August 1911, and stripped and laid up at Motherbank for disposal in July 1913. She was sold for scrap in October 1913 and towed to Italy to be broken up the following month. Design Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1905. The Royal Sovereign-class battleships were based on Admiral-class barbette ships, but contained several alterations. The freeboard was raised, the barbettes' armour was extended and an upper belt and secondary armour were added. They could also obtain a higher speed, but were 4,000 tonnes larger. Ramillies was long overall and had a beam of 75 ft and a draft of 27 ft 6in. She displaced up to 15,580 tonnes at her full combat load. Her propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple expansion engines powered by eight coal-fired cylindrical boilers. With natural draught, her engines provided a top speed of 15.5 knots at 9,000 indicated horsepower; 16.5 knots at 11,000 indicated horsepower could be obtained with forced draught. She had a crew of 712 officers and enlisted men. When built, ships of the Royal Sovereign class rolled too heavily under certain conditions. Bilge keels were added to compensate for the problem, and the ships \\"proved to be excellent seaboats quite capable ... of maintaining high speeds in a seaway\\".Gardiner 1979, p. 32 The ships were well-constructed and probably the most substantial built for the Royal Navy, even if they \\"suffered ... from excessive weight and fittings.\\"Burt 1988, p. 63 In the view of R. A. Burt, they were \\"highly successful; at that time, they were probably unequalled in all-round fighting efficiency.\\" Ramillies was armed with four breech-loading 13.5-inch guns on two barbettes with armour ranging from 11 to 17 inches in thickness. The ship also carried ten quick-fire (QF) 6-inch guns, four of which were mounted in casemates on the main deck, plus sixteen QF 6-pounder () guns of an unknown type and a dozen QF 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns. She was also equipped with seven 18-inch torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged. Between 1899 and 1902, the 3-pounder guns were removed from the upper tops; the above-water torpedo tubes were removed in 1902‚Äì1905.Burt 1988, pp. 78‚Äì79 The remaining 6-inch guns on the upper deck were mounted in 5-inch armoured casemates between 1902 and 1904. All of the armour was supplied by the builders, J. & G. Thompson, of Clydebank. The waterline belt was 252 ft long by 8 ft 8in deep, and its armour varied in thickness between 14 and 18 inches; the bulkheads were protected by 14 to 16 inches of armour. The middle deck covering the belt was 3 inches thick and the lower deck forward and aft of the belt was 2.5 inches thick, while the upper belt between the middle and main decks was coated in 3 to 4 inches of armour. The casemates for the 6-inch guns were protected by an equal thickness of armour and the conning tower was protected with 14 inch armour on the forward side, and 3 inches of armour on the aft.Burt 1988, p. 62 The ship's armoured deck was 2.5 to 3 inches thick. Service history Ramillies was built by J. & G. Thompson, of Clydebank, at a cost of ¬£902,600, plus ¬£78,295 for guns. She was laid down on 11 August 1890, launched on 1 March 1892 and completed the following October. She had been constructed at such a small incline that it took nearly an hour and a half to travel down the slipway and into the water; most of the crowd that had gathered dissipated in the meantime. Ramillies was commissioned at Portsmouth on 17 October 1893 as the Flagship of the Mediterranean Fleet. She departed on 28 October and arrived at Malta on 8 November to relieve the battleship as acting flagship.Burt 1988, p. 81 Francis C. B. Bridgeman-Simpson was appointed captain of Ramillies on the day of her commission; the commander of the Mediterranean Fleet at the time was Admiral Sir Michael Culme-Seymour.Navy List, Corrected to 18 March 1894, 1894 (London: Her Majesty's Stationery Office), p. 247 On 9 December 1896, Ramillies was recommissioned at Malta for further service in the Mediterranean Fleet. In July 1899, she became a private ship in the fleet, relieved as flagship by the battleship , but in January 1900 she became the flagship of Rear Admiral Lord Charles Beresford, second-in-command of the Mediterranean Fleet. When Beresford resigned from this position in January 1902, his successor Rear- Admiral Burges Watson took over Ramillies as his flagship until his death in September 1902.The Navy List. (May, 1902). p. 216. In October 1902, she was once again relieved as flagship, this time by the battleship . In May 1902, Ramillies was at Palermo to attend festivities in connection with the opening of an agricultural exhibition by King Victor Emmanuel; the King and the Italian Minister of Marine paid her a visit when she arrived in Rome later in the month.\\"Naval & Military Intelligence\\", The Times (London), 27 May 1902, p. 10\\"Latest Intelligence ‚Äì Great Britain and Italy\\", The Times (London), 30 May 1902, p. 5 She took part in combined manoeuvres off the coast of Portugal in August 1903, but that month she was paid off from Mediterranean service and transferred to the Portsmouth Reserve while she was refitted. Her refit complete, she was commissioned into the reserve at Chatham on 30 January 1905. In April 1905, Ramillies transferred her crew to the battleship and was recommissioned with a new crew into the Sheerness-Chatham Reserve Division. On 30 January 1906, she transferred her crew to the battleship and recommissioned with yet another crew for service in the Chatham Reserve. In June 1906, she participated in combined manoeuvres of the Atlantic Fleet, Channel Fleet, and Reserve Fleet, but in the process collided with her sister ship , suffering stern damage. As a result, her propellers were disabled. In November 1906, her crew was transferred once more to the battleship . In March 1907, Ramillies was recommissioned at Devonport with a reduced crew into the Special Service Division of the Home Fleet. In October 1910, she became Parent Ship in the Home Fleet's 4th Division. Her sister ship relieved her of her parent ship duties in June 1911 and she was placed on the material reserve at Devonport in August 1911.Burt 1988, pp. 81‚Äì82 She was stripped and laid up ready for disposal in July 1913, before being auctioned off for scrap on 7 October 1913; the buyer, George Cohen, of Swansea, paid ¬£42,300 for her. She was resold to an Italian company, which in November 1913 towed her to Italy to be broken up.

The DSP1 started in 1977 with a Bell Labs study that recommended creating a large-scale integrated circuit for digital signal processing. It described a basic DSP architecture with multiplier/accumulator, addressing unit, and control; the I/O, data, and control memories were planned to be off- chip until large-scale integration could make a single chip implementation feasible. The DSP1 specification was completed in 1978, with first samples tested in May 1979. This first implementation was a single-chip DSP, containing all functional elements found in today's DSPs including multiplier‚Äìaccumulator (MAC), parallel addressing unit, control, control memory, data memory, and I/O. It was designed with a 20-bit fixed point data format, and 16-bit coefficients and instructions, implemented in a DRAM process technology. By October 1979 other Bell Labs groups began development using the DSP1, most notably as a key component in AT&T;'s 5ESS switch.

Life Engraving of William VIBorn in Kassel, he was the son of William V (whom he succeeded) and his wife Amalie Elisabeth, Gr√§fin of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg (daughter of Philip Louis II of Hanau-M√ºnzenberg and his wife Countess Catharina Belgica of Nassau). His mother remained his guardian until he came of age. Despite Hesse-Kassel's defeat in the Thirty Years' War, William's mother did not wish to acknowledge the accord of 1627. This required that the unmarried Marburger heir and the Landgraves of Hessen-Darmstadt should fall, but Amalie Elisabeth had other ideas and led Hesse-Kessel in 1645 into the \\"Hessenkrieg\\", ruling as Landgr√§fin on her son's behalf. This war began when Hesse-Kassel's troops began to besiege the city of Marburg. Three years later, in 1648, the war ended with a victory for Kassel, although the citizens of Darmstadt also gained from it. Domination over the Marburger territories went over to the landgrave of Hesse-Kassel after the accord was dissolved and a new agreement was reached. William VI succeeded in what his ancestors had tried to do in vain since 1604, that is, to end the Hesse-Marburg landgraviate, and to annex the Marburger lands to Hesse-Kassel. After these wars, William attended above all to the extension of the universities within his domains and the foundation of more new Lehranstalts. To finally resolve the quarrel with the landgraves of Hesse-Darmstadt, Wilhelm delivered to George II the territory around Gie√üen, along with √Ñmtern by Biedenkopf. Shortly before his death, William joined the League of the Rhine on its foundation in 1658. He also sought to effect a union between his Lutheran and Reformed subjects, or at least to lessen their mutual hatred. In 1661 he had a colloquy held in Kassel between the Lutheran theologians of the University of Rinteln and the Reformed theologians of the University of Marburg. William VI died at Haina in 1663. Control of his Landgraviate went to his eldest son William VII, though - not yet of age - he remained under the guardianship of his mother Hedwig Sophie of Brandenburg until his early death in 1670. Marriage and issue He married Margravine Hedwig Sophie of Brandenburg (1623‚Äì1683), daughter of daughter of George William, Elector of Brandenburg and Elizabeth Charlotte of the Palantine.

Based at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, England, it was established as a centre for people. Overview It comprises an extensive range of manuscript, published and audio-visual material representing the history of the Conservative Party from the late 19th century up to the present day. The Conservative Party Archive is owned by the Conservative Party Archive Trust and is deposited on loan with the Department of Special Collections & Western Manuscripts of the Bodleian Library which is recognised as holding one of the foremost collections of modern political papers in Britain, including the private papers of six British Prime Ministers. The cost of maintaining the Archive at the Bodleian is borne entirely by the Conservative Party Archive Trust, an educational charity, which raises funds from private donors; no financial support is received from the Conservative Party. While the oldest papers in the Archive date back to 1867, sadly many records were lost during the wars, and a number of moves by Conservative Central Office led to the destruction of still more, particularly from the period before 1939. As a result, the Archive consists predominantly of post-Second World War material. More recent material is regularly transferred to the Archive from Conservative Campaign Headquarters (previously Conservative Central Office). For students of the Conservative Party's past, the Conservative Party Archive is an essential source of reference. Its unrivalled accumulation of papers, some published but the vast majority unpublished gives a unique insight into the development of the Party's policies and organisation. [William Hague, 2001]'' The structure of the Conservative Party Archive Papers held in the Archive reflect the 3 main sections of the Party: the voluntary (through the papers of the National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations and its successor, the National Conservative Convention); the elected (through the papers of the 1922 Committee); and the professional (through the papers of Conservative Central Office and its successor, Conservative Campaign Headquarters). The Archive also includes other categories such as audio-visual material and a large library of material published and printed by the Conservative Party. The main collections within the Archive are as follows: National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations, and its Area Offices Conservative Central Office (since 2004, Conservative Campaign Headquarters), including the Conservative Research Department 1922 Committee Advisory Committee on Policy Shadow Cabinet (or Leader's Consultative Committee) Steering Committee Official Group Private Papers Scottish Unionist Members' Committee Swinton College Conservative Whip's Office Library of Published and Printed Material (printed Party literature, press releases, speeches) A full catalogue of the archive is available online at: online catalogue National Union of Conservative And Unionist Associations, 1867‚Äìpresent The National Union of Conservative and Unionist Associations (now known as the National Conservative Convention) was established in 1867. It is a federation of constituency associations, bringing together the rank and file of the Party in a national organisation. Representatives of the constituencies meet at area and national level, and a system of advisory committees is used to convey grass roots opinion to the Party leadership. The Convention exists to express opinion and support and, as such, can exert a degree of influence on the Leader and over Party policy. It does not, however, possess any mandatory powers. The annual Party Conference is a Convention function. The Conservative Party's provincial organisation is based on 26 \\"areas\\", mostly corresponding to two or three counties. This structure has been in place since the 1997 General Election. Prior to this date, the Party's structure was based on eleven larger Areas, such as North Western or Southern, and it is this structure which is reflected in the files held in the Conservative Party Archive. The National Union organisation within each area was headed by the Area Council, comprising MPs, candidates, area officials, representatives from each constituency and constituency agents. The Area Council generally met once a year, and most area business was conducted by the Area Advisory Committee which complemented those at national level and co- ordinated similar advisory committees in individual constituencies. In some areas, in addition to the area structure, there also existed a number of County Divisions or Federations, again with their own committees. Papers from individual constituency associations are not held in Conservative Party Archive but have been retained by association offices or transferred to local libraries and record offices. *National Union records held in the Conservative Party Archive *Area Office records held in the Conservative Party Archive *Locate local constituency associations *contact details for local libraries and county record offices Conservative Central Office, 1936‚Äìpresent Conservative Central Office, established in 1870, constitutes the main professional and organisational element of the Party. Initially under overall control of the Chief Whip, by 1911 it had grown sufficiently to warrant the appointment of a Chairman of the Party Organisation. This was, and has almost invariably been, a politician of cabinet or near-cabinet rank, and the deputy and vice-chairmen have generally also been political appointments, though not necessarily MPs. *Conservative Central Office/CCHQ records held in the Conservative Party Archive 1922 Committee, 1923‚Äìpresent The 1922 Committee was formed [in 1923] of Conservative Private Members who were elected for the first time in 1922, for the purpose of mutual co-operation and assistance in dealing political and parliamentary questions and to enable new Members to take a more active interest and part in parliamentary life... (CPA, 1922/1) Today every Conservative back-bench MP is a member of the committee. It provides a sounding board of Conservative opinion in the House of Commons, and allows MPs to put forward ideas, views and concerns through a process of dialogue, rather than through confrontation with the leadership. As such, it has been involved in all the major issues of the twentieth century. *Records of the 1922 Committee held in the Conservative Party Archive Advisory Committee on Policy, 1946‚Äì79 The Advisory Committee on Policy (ACP) lies at the heart of the Conservative Party. From its foundation in 1946 until the 1970s it was the central forum for considering policy, and its deliberations provide an important and revealing insight into the inner workings of Conservative Politics. Its founding father was R.A. Butler, one of the most important figures in the post-war revival and the governments of 1951‚Äì64. He remained its chairman until 1965, and under his patronage and influence the ACP became the Party's clearing house for ideas and policies. This series is available on microform up until 1964. *Records of the Advisory Committee on Policy held in the Conservative Party Archive Shadow Cabinet (or Leader's Consultative Committee), 1964‚Äìpresent The Leader's Consultative Committee is the most central of policy organs and the supreme decision-making body of the Party. Also known as the Shadow Cabinet, its membership is always by invitation from the Leader. Its secretary is usually the Director of the Conservative Research Department when the Party is in opposition. The Conservative Party Archive only holds the files of this committee when the Party is in Opposition; Cabinet records are held at The National Archives at Kew. *Records of the Shadow Cabinet held in the Conservative Party Archive Steering Committee, 1963‚Äì76 The Steering Committee was, in effect, an inner cabinet of Ministers meeting together, without their civil servants, to look ahead politically. (In Opposition, this body was an inner Shadow Cabinet). The Steering Committee was first formally constituted in 1957. *Records of the Steering Committee held in the Conservative Party Archive Official Group, 1967‚Äì74 The Conservative Official Group has existed under several names, such as the Research Study Group and the Policy Study Group, and was also known as the Chairman's Committee while headed by Iain Macleod as Party chairman. It is a gathering of MPs and professionals from the Research Department and Central Office, mainly brought together for the purposes of assembling and drafting a manifesto but advising on other matters too. Its secretary usually comes from the Research Department. *Records of the Official Group held in the Conservative Party Archive *An archive of Conservative electoral manifestos from 1900‚Äìpresent Private papers The Conservative Party Archive includes correspondence of MPs, ministers, shadow ministers and leaders engaged in Party activity and three small collections of private papers: papers of R.

Overview  The V-Model of the general Systems Development Life Cycle.Clarus Concept of Operations. Publication No. FHWA-JPO-05-072, Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), 2005 Spacecraft systems are normally developed under the responsibility of space agencies as NASA, ESA etc. In the space area standardized terms and processes have been introduced to allow for unambiguous communication between all partners and efficient usage of all documents. For instance the life cycle of space systems is divided in phases: * Phase A: Feasibility Study * Phase B: Requirements Definition * Phase C/D: Design / Manufacturing / Verification * Phase E: Operational usage. At the end of phase B the system requirements together with a statement of work are sent out requesting proposals from industry.  Technical systems requirement  The technical system requirements documented in the System Specification stay on mission level: * System functions and performances * Orbit * Launch vehicle * etc. whereas the non-technical system (task) requirements * Cost and progress reporting * Documentation maintenance * etc. are contained in the statement of work. The customer (requirements) specification is answered by the contractor by a design-to specification. For example, the requirement \\"Columbus shall be launched by the Space Shuttle.\\" is detailed in the contractor system specification \\"Columbus shall be a cylindrical pressurized module with max. length of 6.9 meters and 4.5 meters diameter as agreed in the Shuttle/Columbus ICD.\\" Systems requirements can be specified in a \\"Requirements Allocation Sheet\\".Systems Engineering Fundamentals. Defense Acquisition University Press, 2001  Operations environment  The spacecraft's systems specification, according to David Michael Harland (2005), usually also defines the operation environment of the spacecraft. It mostly is defined \\"as a model - often provide by the scientific community from available data - in the form of a set of curves, numerical tables, or software, usually with a nominal expectation and the minimal and maximum profiles which the environment is not expected to exceed\\".David Michael Harland, Ralph Lorenz (2005), Space Systems Failures: Disasters and Rescues of Satellites, Rockets, Springer, p.178.  System specification structure  A typical industry generated system specification for a spacecraft has the following structure (e.g. Columbus Design Spec (COL- RIBRE-SPE-0028, iss.10/F, 06.25.2004): * Document change record * 1. Scope ** 1.1 Purpose ** 1.2 Summary description ** 1.3 Classification ** 1.4 Applicability * 2. Related documents ** 2.1 Applicable documents (incl. order of precedence) ** 2.2 Reference documents * 3. Functional /Performance Requirements * 4. Support requirements ** 4.1 Product assurance ** 4.2 Electro-magnetic compatibility ** 4.3 Contamination ** 4.4 etc. * 5. Interface requirements ** 5.1 System interfaces *** 5.1.1 Launcher *** 5.1.2 Ground stations *** 5.1.3 etc. ** 5.2 Subsystem interfaces *** 5.2.1 Electrical power *** 5.2.2 Data *** 5.2.3 etc. * 6. Implementation requirements ** 6.1 Configuration ** 6.2 Budget Allocations *** 6.2.1 Mass *** 6.2.2 Electrical power *** 6.2.3 etc. * 7. Preparation for delivery * Attachments (Abbreviation list etc.) Each requirement paragraph consists of the requirement to be fulfilled by the product to be delivered and the verification requirement (Review of design, analysis, test, inspection).  Specification tree  The spacecraft system specification defines also the subsystems of the spacecraft e.g.: * Structure * Data management subsystem incl. software * Electrical Power * Mechanical * etc. For each subsystem a subsystem specification is prepared by the Prime Contractor with the same specification structure shown above including references to the parent paragraph in the system specification. In the same way the subsystem contractor prepares an assembly or unit specification. All these specifications are listed in a so-called specification tree showing all specifications and their linkage as well as the issue / date of each specification.

When still only a 25 year old lieutenant he was commissioned by the Kaiser to lead an expedition into the unknown and uncharted territories of Central Asia. The region associated with the political \\"Great Game\\" had its roots in Victorian rivalries between the local Great Powers: Russia and British India. The small expedition party, travelling in extreme climatic conditions, suffered extraordinary privations with courage and equanimity. Surviving diary accounts of participants on both sides of the Great War bear witness to the unusual camaraderie and esprit de corps summoned by Hentig's outstanding qualities of leadership. Hentig was the elder brother of the criminal psychologist Hans von Hentig and the father of . Though critical of the Nazi regime, he served in the Third Reich and intervened at personal risk to save Jews who were in danger, and was instrumental in arranging for thousands of Jews to be transferred from Germany to Palestine during the 1930s. Hentig joined the Imperial German diplomatic service in 1909 and was posted as an attach√© to the German mission at Beijing. He was later posted to Istanbul and Tehran. During the First World War he was wounded in the Battle of the Masurian Lakes, then later in 1915, with Oskar Niedermayer, led the Niedermayer‚ÄìHentig Expedition, a German mission to Kabul that sought to enlist the Afghan Amir's support for the Central Powers and an attack on British India. At the end of the war, Hentig was attached to the embassy at Istanbul, before becoming active in repatriation of German prisoners of war from Siberia. In 1924, he was appointed the ambassador to Pozna≈Ñ. In the 1920s, Hentig became involved in the German Youth Movement. In the 1930s, he was appointed the German Consul General to San Francisco and later Bogot√° when in 1935, attempts were made to assassinate him. Nora Levin writes in 'The Holocaust' about Hentig's actions during 1937 and 1938, when the rate of Jewish emigration from Germany to Palestine was being restricted by a combination of British obstructions (in response to Arab uprisings in Mandatory Palestine that opposed giving asylum to European Jews) and a change in German policy concerning the German Jewish contribution to the potential establishment of a Jewish State: > The Palestine Desk in the Wilhelmstrasse at this time (1937-38) was held by > Werner Otto von Hentig, a critic of the Nazi regime, but a man whose foreign > service expertise could not be ignored or wasted. Hentig had already dealt > with the Palestine problem in Constantinople [now Istanbul].... In Berlin, > he had often seen and heard Chaim Weizmann and had been deeply impressed by > him. He was also attracted to the daring of the Zionist experiment. Hentig > advised Ernst Marcus, who was employed by the Paltreu Company [Pal√§stina > Treuhandstelle, Palestine Trustee Office], a subsidiary of the Haavara > Company, to prepare material proving that the contribution of the German > Jews to the upbuilding of Palestine was small as compared with the share of > Polish Jews and the financial contribution of American Jews. Marcus prepared > such a memorandum, which served as the basis for a brief, arguing that there > were certain advantages to Germany in the establishment of a Jewish State. > Other divisions within the Foreign Ministry, however, submitted negative > recommendations. Several months passed .... A short time before the Mossad > emissary, Auerbach, arrived in Vienna, Hentig phoned Marcus to tell him that > Hitler at last had made a favorable decision and that all obstacles in the > way of emigration to Palestine were now removed \\"Holocaust, Levin, 1968\\", p. > 132 Although Hentig was overly optimistic about the removal of all obstacles, especially the British opposition to unlimited Jewish immigration into Palestine, the actions he initiated enabled Auerbach to negotiate with Eichmann for (at first) a thousand Jewish boys and girls to be trained in preparation for emigration to Palestine. Although Eichmann had wanted the training and emigration to be handled by the Gestapo, Auerbach found confederates who used the opportunity to obtain 20,000 transit visas that could theoretically enable Jewish migration to Yugoslavia. Although the actual numbers saved from later being sent to concentration camps were fewer than 20,000, various efforts enabled many small groups in bunches of hundreds to find passage on several different vessels departing Yugoslav and Grecian ports. Although there were a variety of putative destinations, after a series of adventures and mishaps, many of these Jewish refugees eventually arrived safely in Palestine. These arrangements were continued until the British took strong action to stop such rescue operations.\\"Holocaust, Levin, 1968\\", pp. 132 --143 After the Nazi Kristallnacht in Germany, November 1938: > Hentig ... expressed his shame, and willingly used his influence, at great > personal risk, to protest a fresh action from starting.... Hentig interceded > with Under-Secretary of State Ernst von Weizs√§cker, pointing out the > detrimental effects of the riots on German foreign policy.... Hentig ... did > secure the release of ... arrested ... Jewish functionaries from > concentration camps.Levin, \\"Holocaust\\" (1968), p. 82 As the Middle East historian Wolfgang G. Schwanitz of New Jersey proved in his research, Hentig did cultivate a bitter rivalry with another leading German envoy to the Middle East, Dr Fritz Grobba, because they did not share the same ideological opinions. This shaped the German Middle Eastern policy: Hentig obstructed the expansion of the Second World War to the Middle East. Whereas Grobba, an ardent Nazi, belonged in both world wars to the Foreign Office faction that favored the massive incitement of Muslims to jihad in the colonial hinterland of Britain, France, and Russia, Hentig and Niedermayer rejected it. During the First World War they both underwent a professional transformation in the German officer corps, and nationalist ideas spreading across the region played a part in the conduct of Hentig's secret mission to Kabul, Afghanistan; the Turkish declaration of war escalated racial tensions among the Ottoman-German conspiracy, seeking to launch a Holy War to counter the so-called Allied powers. Some years after the Second World War, Hentig served as the West German ambassador to Indonesia. In retirement he was a personal advisor to the Saudi Royal Family for nearly two years. In 1961, Hentig, along with Bogislaw von Bonin, Herman Schwann, Wolf Schenke, and Theodor Kogler, was one of the founders of the Association of German National Assembly.

The club, established on February 1, 1920, is the second most successful amateur football club in the Netherlands, behind IJsselmeervogels. The club joined the football competition in 1921‚Äì22, in the Leidsche Voetbal Bond (LVB), the football association for Leiden. The club played in the Sunday league but a ban on entry charges on Sunday caused financial troubles and Quick Boys moved to the new Saturday league. Quick Boys have played at the highest amateur level since the founding of the club in 1920. The club won 9 titles in the Eerste Klasse, and joined the new Saturday Hoofdklasse in 1996, winning a further four titles. Twenty seasons later they won promotion to the Derde Divisie (formerly Topklasse) for the first time by winning the fourth Hoofdklasse title. After three seasons in the Derde Divisie, Quick Boys promoted to the highest amateur division (Tweede Divisie) after beating OSS '20 and VVSB in the relegation play-offs. The club reached the quarter-finals of the 2007‚Äì08 KNVB Cup. Kuyt Former professional footballer Dirk Kuyt started and ended his senior career with the team, playing in 1998 and 2018.

Upon her completion in 1894, she was initially placed in reserve until mobilised in 1896 for service with the Flying Squadron. After returning briefly to reserve, the ship was assigned the following year to the Mediterranean Fleet. Royal Oak remained there until 1902 when she returned home; after a refit, the ship was assigned to the Home Fleet, where she served as the flagship of the fleet's second-in-command in 1904‚Äì05. Royal Oak was then reduced to reserve until she was taken out of service in 1911. The ship was sold for scrap in early 1914. Design and description The design of the Royal Sovereign-class ships was derived from that of the battleships, greatly enlarged to improve seakeeping and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding battleships.Gardiner, p. 116; Parkes, p. 359 The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 32 Their crew consisted of 670 officers and ratings in 1903.Burt, p. 73 The Royal Sovereigns were powered by a pair of three-cylinder, vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft. Their engines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers with forced draught. The ships carried a maximum of of coal, which gave them a range of at a speed of . Their main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) guns mounted in two twin-gun barbettes, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.Parkes, p. 355 Each gun was provided with 80 rounds. Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) guns. 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships. Sixteen QF 6-pounder () guns of an unknown type and a dozen QF 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. The two 3-pounders in the upper fighting top were removed in 1899‚Äì1902 and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905‚Äì1909. The Royal Sovereign-class ships mounted seven 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes, although Royal Oak had four of hers removed in 1902.Burt, pp. 73, 85, 87, 100 The Royal Sovereigns' armour scheme was similar to that of the Trafalgars, as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes. The belt was long and had a total height of of which was below water. Transverse bulkheads thick closed off the ends of the belt. Above the belt was a strake of nickel-steel armour closed off by transverse bulkheads. The barbettes were protected by compound armour, ranging in thickness from , and the casemates for the 6-inch guns were protected by armour equally thick. The thicknesses of the deck armour ranged from . The walls of the forward conning tower were thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates. Construction and career Royal Oak before 1902 The Royal Sovereign class was ordered as part of the Naval Defence Act 1889 that was a supplement to the normal naval estimates.Burt, p. 90 Royal Oak, named after the tree in which King Charles II hid after the Battle of Worcester,Silverstone, p. 265 was the sixth ship of her name to serve in the Royal Navy.Colledge, pp. 300‚Äì01 The ship was laid down by Cammell Laird at their shipyard in Birkenhead on 29 May 1890 and floated out of the drydock on 5 November 1892. She arrived at Portsmouth Dockyard on 29 October 1893 for fitting out, completed her sea trials in June 1894, and cost ¬£977,996. Upon completion, Royal Oak was placed in reserve at Portsmouth. Almost two years later, she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 for service in the Particular Service Squadron ‚Äì later renamed the Flying Squadron ‚Äì which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the Jameson Raid and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II's telegram of support to the Boer government. When the squadron disbanded on 25 November, the ship returned to reserve at Portsmouth.Burt, p. 92 Royal Oak was recommissioned on 9 March 1897 for service with the Mediterranean Fleet, where she was to relieve the battleship Collingwood. She departed Portsmouth on 24 March 1897, and arrived at Malta on 5 April. Royal Oak was relieved by the battleship Bulwark and departed the Mediterranean in May 1902. She arrived at Plymouth on 16 May, and at Portsmouth the following day, and paid off there on 6 June 1902. She soon moved to Chatham Dockyard for a refit, during which casemates were provided for her six-inch upper deck guns. On 16 February 1903, Royal Oak recommissioned at Portsmouth for service in the Home Fleet using part of the battleship Niles crew as a nucleus. In the summer of 1903, she participated in combined exercises in the Atlantic involving the Home, Mediterranean, and Channel Fleets, as well as the Cruiser Squadron. In April 1904, while operating with the Home Fleet off the Scilly Isles, Royal Oak and her sister ship Revenge had their bottoms lightly damaged when they struck a sunken wreck. On 9 May 1904, Royal Oak became flagship of the Home Fleet's second-in- command, relieving her sister Empress of India, and took part in annual maneuvers in July and August. On 7 March 1905, Royal Oak paid off at Portsmouth into the Chatham Reserve, and her crew transferred to the battleship Caesar. The following day the ship recommissioned with a skeleton crew for service with the Sheerness-Chatham Division of the newly formed Fleet in Commission in Reserve at Home. While she was under refit at Chatham, an explosion in her small-arms magazine on 11 May killed one workman and injured three others. In July, Royal Oak participated in Reserve Fleet manoeuvres. Her crew was then transferred to the battleship Ocean, and Royal Oak recommissioned with a new nucleus crew to serve as an emergency reserve ship at Chatham.Burt, pp. 92‚Äì93; Parkes, p. 363 As a unit of the First Division of the Blue Fleet, Royal Oak took part in annual maneuvers off the coast of Portugal and in the eastern Atlantic from 12 June to 2 July 1906. On 1 January 1907, she recommissioned in reserve at Devonport with a nucleus crew. In April 1909, Royal Oak and the other reserve ships with nucleus crews at Devonport were formed into the 4th Division of the Home Fleet. She relieved her sister Ramillies as the parent ship of the division in June 1911, and was in turn relieved of this duty by her sister Empress of India in November. The ship was taken out of service in December 1911 and towed to the Motherbank by the battleship Bellerophon in August 1912.Burt, p. 93 She was sold to Thos W Ward on 14 January 1914 for ¬£36,450 and subsequently broken up at Briton Ferry.Colledge, p. 301 Notes References  External links *Royal Oak on the Dreadnought Project Royal Oak (1892))) Royal Oak (1892) 1892 ships ","title":"HMS Royal Oak (1892)"},{"id":"14357897","text":"Kunchepalli is a village located at Podili mandal in Prakasam district in the state of Andhra Pradesh in India.List of Sub-Districts Census of India  References  Villages in Prakasam district ","title":"Kunchepalli"},{"id":"14357899","text":"WSBM (1340 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a sports radio format.

The station is owned by Azteca Communications of Alabama, Inc. It normally airs a Regional Mexican music format but is silent in light of \\"financial difficulties\\". History Launch On May 24, 1979, the Federal Communications Commission granted a construction permit for a new standard broadcast station at 1010 kHz with 500 watts of power, daytime only. On November 24, 1980, the permit was modified to allow a maximum power of 5,000 watts. After several extensions, and nearly five years after the initial application was filed in June 1977, the FCC granted WPYK a license to cover on April 28, 1982. 1980s and 1990s In April 1985, Mid-Way Radio reached an agreement to sell this station to James O. Powell (trading as JASCO). The deal was approved by the FCC on May 17, 1985, and after a significant delay the transaction was finally consummated on April 11, 1986. That very same day, April 11, 1986, James O. Powell (trading as JASCO) reached an agreement to sell this station to Earl Fisher. The deal was approved by the FCC on May 20, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on May 30, 1986. The new owners petitioned the FCC to change the station's call letters to WDLE on November 30, 1987. On June 4, 1988, the station had its call letters changed back to WPYK. In August 1988, Earl Fisher reached an agreement to sell this station to Casey & Perkins Broadcasting. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 3, 1988. In January 1990, Casey & Perkins Broadcasting reached an agreement to sell this station to Paul Tate Johnson. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 2, 1990, and the transaction was consummated on June 20, 1990. 2000s In December 2001, Paul Tate Johnson reached an agreement to sell this station to Azteca Communications of Alabama, Inc (Javier Macias, owner). The station was sold for a reported $190,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on February 12, 2002, and the transaction was consummated on April 4, 2002. The new owners had the station's call letters changed by the FCC to WCOC on April 4, 2002. At the time of the sale, Javier Macias owned three other radio stations: WAZX and WAZX-FM serving Atlanta, Georgia, and WGTA near Rome, Georgia. Together, these stations were operated as a network under the branding \\"Radio La Que Buena\\" featuring Regional Mexican music and other Spanish-language programming, including Atlanta Braves baseball broadcasts. Falling silent On November 28, 2007, the station informed the FCC that it would be going off the air on December 1, 2007, due to \\"financial difficulties being experienced by the licensee.\\" The application noted that the station would resume broadcast operations \\"following a reassessment of station operations to determine a means to improve station revenues\\" and requested authority to stay silent pending this reassessment. On September 26, 2008, the station filed for an extension of this temporary stay silent authority. The September 2008 filing also states that negotiations were then in progress for the sale of this radio station. On November 19, 2008, the FCC granted the requested extension with a scheduled expiration date of May 18, 2009. The station resumed broadcasting on November 25, 2008, but fell silent again just days later on November 29, 2008. They belatedly informed the FCC in July 2009 during their request for authority to remain silent. The FCC granted the request on September 17, 2009, with a November 28, 2009, expiration date. The station reported that they resumed broadcasting on November 28, 2009, ending nearly two years of silence. If the station had been continuously silent for a full year, the broadcast license would have been subject to forfeiture and cancellation. Today After more than 20 months of regular operation, WCOC fell silent again on August 12, 2011. In their November 2011 request for authority to remain silent, the license holder cited \\"financial difficulties\\" as the reason for taking the station off the air. The FCC granted this authority on January 4, 2012, with a July 2, 2012, scheduled expiration. On November 3, 2014 WCOC's license was turned in to the FCC.

Life  A member of the noble Leyen family, Charles Kaspar was made a coadjutor bishop on 11 June 1650. He was elected the successor of the then 86-year-old Archbishop Philipp Christoph von S√∂tern, but this was rejected as Philipp Christoph was the favoured candidate. Engraving of Karl KasparAfter the death of the Archbishop, Karl Kaspar started his reign on 12 March 1652. The consequences of the recently ended Thirty Years' War presented the new archbishop with many hard tasks, for example, the population of the archiepiscopal state had declined to approximately 300,000 people. His policy towards the Allies had destroyed many buildings; so he had to restore the country‚Äôs infrastructure, especially the justice and agriculture systems, to promote development. He also had to repair the fortresses Koblenz and Ehrenbreitstein. He founded an orphanage for boys in Trier and endowed scholarships for the training of nobles‚Äô sons to become priests, and in 1668, he had the Kurtrierische Landrecht (\\"Electoral-Trier Common Law\\") published. Charles Kaspar promoted, in particular, the members of his aristocratic house, Von der Leyen (House of the Leyens). In 1654 he made his younger brother Damian Hartard von der Leyen the Archbishop of Mainz and Provost and Archdeacon of Karden, titles under the Archbishopric of Trier. Aware as he was of his declining health, he had already named his successor, his nephew John Hugo of Orsbeck, by 1672. He died on 1 June 1676 in Fort Ehrenbreitstein.

Though traditional trade practitioners may at times be involved in new construction, the emphasis of the categorization is toward work on existing structures, regardless of their age or their historic value, with a specific interest in replication or conservation of the original results and craft techniques.  Trade technologies  Modern timber framers incorporate new technologies, like the circular saw shown here, to increase productivity and reduce labor costs and time. Traditional building trades commonly include masonry, timber framing, log building, traditional roofing, upholstery, carpentry and joinery, sometimes plumbing, plasterwork, painting, blacksmithing, and ornamental metal working (Bronze and brass). In addition to \\"hands-on\\" skills and knowledge of building processes, traditional trade practitioners incorporate knowledge of historic preservation, materials science, historic architecture, and procuring replacement materials. Contemporary practitioners of traditional trades must also avail themselves of modern technologies, current materials science, and 21st century construction project management. The work performed by these practitioners is not only essential to the maintenance of the historic built environment, but also to the preservation of the traditional trade skills and knowledge themselves. In many cases, traditional trade skills and techniques date back centuries. Traditional trades such as carpenters and timber framers; masons, plasterers, lime burners, and brick makers; painters; blacksmiths; and slate, metal, shingle, tile, and thatch roofers, are anecdotally said to be ‚Äúdying‚Äù arts. While it is true that some techniques of the past are not well enough understood, it is also true that these crafts have been practiced continuously all over the world without dying at all. Traditional trades not only restore and help to maintain buildings, but also stabilize priceless archaeological sites, and in doing so, help us understand the techniques used at places like Cuzco, Stonehenge, and Angkor Wat. Such trades are not solely practiced for the conservation of monumental heritage sites and can be applied to conserve vernacular sites such as barns.  Materials technologies  The traditional trades focus on preservation of the knowledge of craft work specific to historic building technologies and traditional/non-traditional building materials. Traditional building materials and traditional trade technologies are commonly associated with a host of materials, but not limited to, stone, brick, terra cotta, adobe, cork, leather, timber and log, bamboo, thatch, slate and metal roofing, fine and vernacular carpentry, ornamental plaster (scagliola), stained glass, window and door restoration, wood refinishing, painting, cast iron and wrought iron. In what may at times be considered non- traditional materials are found trades such as chandelier and lighting restoration where you have to be somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades with an understanding of electricity, and knowledgeable with properties and finishes of metals, glass, and optics. As an example of the mix of new and old materials, the art of restoration of mobile residential trailers requires a number of traditional trade skills associated with traditional and contemporary materials in a manner not dissimilar to those hand-work skills and preservation approaches required to restore an historic automobile, a biplane, rocket ship or steam locomotive.  Green trades  Traditional building technologies tend towards a closer relationship of the built environment to an in-practice understanding, interaction and use of natural resources and recycled or salvaged building materials than is common in the practice of modern and contemporary building technologies. For example: a traditional timber framer in search of difficult-to-acquire materials with which to rebuild heritage structures will tend to seek out an understanding of forest management, tree harvest, conversion process and building design and technique. These integrated skills and their supportive knowledge base both in scale and localization are readily adaptable to strategies of sustainable new- build economies. Old buildings and structures were built once, energy and natural resources previously expended, and to adaptively re-use or recycle them often requires an understanding and appreciation of not only how the older materials with which they were built work together in a structure, but a need to understand the techniques by which these materials were originally worked, and an understanding of how they can most optimally be worked now.  Knowledge of process  As opposed to an emphasis on materials science (as with an architectural conservator) the primary orientation of a traditional trade practitioner tends toward the in-process work activity and physical interaction and intervention with the building materials and the coordination, education and project management of in-field work teams.  Team members  Traditional trades are quite often team members with architectural conservators, preservation architects and structural engineers in both the design phase investigation of heritage sites as well as involved directly in the undertaking of the hands-on restoration process. Traditional trades as a resource to the historic preservation industry provide a physical grounding in feasibility, construction logic, field and site logistics, reference to skilled traditional trades practitioners, estimate and budget considerations.  Availability  Skilled traditional trades practitioners are generally available to preservationists and property stewards who give themselves a chance to find them. Besides the Internet and verbal networking, information about traditional trades can be found through trade associations and training programs, both private and governmental. If a particular job is limited to union workers, the union should provide workers with the appropriate skills or else allow an exception for a particular task. A traditional trades practitioner may also be able to recommend experts in related skills, as well as promote good communications among the different disciplines at work on any given project.  Education  Basic levels of training in contemporary building and craft skills are a prerequisite to specialization in traditional trades work. Individuals with an interest in learning a traditional trade can seek out learning opportunities either through formal vocational programs or through informal mentorship in at-work field practice under the tutelage of a traditional trade practitioner. Family businesses, trade unions, historic preservation businesses, government programs (National Park Service Historic Preservation Training Center), college programs, religious and non-profit organizations are areas where an interest to provide education of traditional trade practice can often be found. As the individual increases in skill, learning will come from study, from workshops, from travel and personal contacts, and from clues found in the work itself. Some individual tradespeople provide training opportunities for their fellow tradespeople without a close association with the larger educational institutions. Individuals providing trades training include: John Leeke's Historic HomeWorks Steve Quillian, Historic Homes Workshop Amy McAuley, Oculus, oculuswindow (at) gmail.com Kelsie Gray, kelsiegray (at) gmail.com Institutions providing trades education programs include: The Preservation Education Institute Belmont Tech College of the Redwoods Savannah College of Art & Design American College of the Building Arts North Bennet Street School Pine Mountain Settlement School Organizations providing trades education resources, and hands-on workshops include: Preservation Trades Network * In England are the Heritage Skills HUB, The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings, and The Sustainable Traditional Buildings Alliance. * In Europe are the Gewerbe Akademie in Rottweil Germany; Compagnons du Devoir in France, Telford College in Scotland, and masonry trades programs in Ireland. * International Trades Education Symposia (ITES) have been held in 2005 at Belmont Technical College in Ohio and in 2007 in Telborg, Sweden.

Licensed to Birmingham, Alabama, United States, the station serves the Birmingham market. The station is currently owned by Dulce and Maria Rivera, through licensee Rivera Communications, LLC, and features programing from Westwood One. The station signed on in 1949 using the callsign WEDR. The original president of the company that owned the station was J.L. Doss, who previously had owned WJLD, another Birmingham station. For much of the station's early history, it broadcast only during daytime hours. At least by 1960, the station changed its call letters to WEZB, taking the programming and intellectual property from another station in the Birmingham market. In 1963 the station was sold and changed its call letters to WAQY and was known on the air as \\"Wacky 1220\\". It changed formats, becoming a Top 40 station and putting it in competition against three other stations that were established in the format: WSGN, WVOK, and WYDE. The station gained national notoriety by announcing a boycott of records by The Beatles after John Lennon made his comments that the Fab Four was more popular than Jesus Christ, but it was never a serious competitor to any of the more established Top 40 stations in the market. In 1970 the station dropped Top 40 music for country music, and in 1971 they adopted a format described as \\"for women only\\". In 1972, the station changed its call letters to WBUL, and changed formats to become a soul music station known on the air as 1220 the Bull. This new format put it in competition against AM stations WENN and WJLD, as well as WENN-FM. The station retained this format for the remainder of the 1970s. In 1983 the station changed formats to Big Band music and standards, and changed its call letters to WTWG and was known as Stardust 1220. The station was assigned the WAYE call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on October 16, 1984, and changed its format to MOR (middle-of-the-road) gospel music as \\"Way 1220 AM\\". The format was later changed to black gospel in 1987 upon the station's sale to Willis Broadcasting. WAYE went silent in July 2010, but resumed broadcasting in early 2012. In August 2013, the station dropped its Black gospel format and became a Regional Mexican music station. In May 2014 the station began broadcasting on FM translator W252BE (98.3 FM), licensed to the Birmingham suburb of Tarrant.

Born in Paris, the son of Marie-Louis-Paulin Rouill√© and Marie-Ang√©lique d'Aquin, he was in succession conseiller to the parlement de Paris (1711), ma√Ætre des requ√™tes (1717), intendant of commerce (1725), conseiller d'√âtat and finally commissaire to the French East India Company (1744). Named Secretary of State for the Navy to replace Maurepas, he worked to reorganise the French Navy. He left this ministry on 24 July 1754 to hold that of Foreign Secretary. As Foreign Secretary, Rouill√© generally pursued a pacific policy, trying to avoid escalation of the increasingly bitter colonial feud with Britain in North America. His role in French foreign policy, however, was not central, as most of the important initiative during the time of his ministry was conducted personally by King Louis XV and his favorite Madame de Pompadour. Rouill√© was unable to prevent the escalation of the Anglo-French conflict into open war in 1756. Although he had little to do with the diplomatic maneuvers which led to the Diplomatic Revolution of 1756, Rouill√©, as Foreign Secretary, was one of the French signatories of the first Treaty of Versailles (1756), which joined France and Austria together in an alliance. Soon after the conclusion of that alliance led to open war between France and its former ally, Prussia, in late 1756, Rouill√© was replaced as Foreign Secretary on 28 June 1757 by Cardinal de Bernis.

With a volume of the pool results from the dissolution of about 3.62 billion tonnes of the Louann Salt bed into seawater. The basin owes its shape to ongoing salt tectonics and is surrounded by salt diapirs. Gas hydrates were detected in a number of cores collected in the Orca basin during Leg 96 of the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP). The cores were recovered from a water depth of at Holes 618 and 618A, with first evidence of gas hydrate occurring in Hole 618. Hydrates were observed in the top section of Core 618-4 at 85 fbsf (26 mbsf) in gray mud and consisted of a few white crystals of a few millimeters in diameter. At Hole 618A, gas hydrates were observed in both Cores 618A-2 and 618-3 in the 62-121 fbsf (19-37 mbsf) range, with hydrates distributed throughout Core 618A-3.

Researchers also noted that some of the hydrates appeared to occur in the sandy layers of the cores. In contrast to other gas hydrate occurrences in the Gulf of Mexico, the gas hydrate was found within a mini-basin instead of on the fractured and faulted rim of the mini-basin.Milkov and Sassen 2000.

The recovery of biogenic methane hydrate from Orca basin is also significant due to the high salinity values, which at the sediment/water interface were nearly 5 times as high as those found in the Red Sea (with salinity values of 240-260 PSU). The values decreased rapidly with depth to about 98 fbsf (30 mbsf) before becoming constant (48-56 PSU). The hydrate recovered from both sites in Orca Basin were in the range of 85-121 fbsf (26-37 mbsf) and are physical evidence of the decreased salinity levels.

It is licensed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority to broadcast within guidelines prescribed by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. Southern FM is the local community radio station for the south, south-eastern and bayside suburbs of Melbourne with a population of over 470,000.  History  The radio station was established in 1981 by former Australian Broadcasting Control Board member Dom Iacono and then former ABC engineer Jack Burgesson, who with a dedicated band of volunteers, first broadcast for a two-day broadcast from the Caulfield Town Hall. The first test broadcast was not spectacular or particularly notable apart from the fact that it was the first test broadcast by the new group, and attracted much interest in the local area which the radio station was to eventually service. The second test broadcast was from the store room of the now demolished East Bentleigh Community Hall The station was originally established to cover the then municipal areas of Chelsea, Mordialloc, Sandringham, Caulfield, and Brighton. As part of a planning review prior to the formal invitations for licence applications, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (now ABA) had offered SCB an extension to its coverage area to include the areas bounded by the Cities of Prahran, St Kilda, and Waverley in addition to the inclusion of the Inner eastern areas (now covered by 3WBC) The Inner Eastern suburban area (that being the area of the then Cities of Box Hill Camberwell, Hawthorn and Kew) was without a local radio service at the time of the formation and development of the suburban community radio groups such as SCB, ECB, VYV, MDR, etc. Although the Inner Eastern municipal areas were designated by the then ABA for a potential new area it was, prior to licensing of the first group of Sub-Metropolitan stations offered to Southern Community Broadcasters as an addition to its licence area, due to a lack of a local service. Southern Community Broadcasters - after AGMs and resolutions had after an initial interest in the addition of the area to its own, rejected the proposal - claiming the Inner East was not an area that shared the Bayside / Inner South identity. After a succession of approximately 20 test broadcasts of one to two week durations, the parent organisation Southern Community Broadcasters Inc was successful in being granted a full-time licence on 30 March 1990. Following many moves of studios and offices, the radio station ended up at Railway Crescent Moorabbin, above the (now) former Salvation Army Opportunity Shop. From there the radio station moved to the Moorabbin City Council offices and from there (in 2009) to 22 Balcombe Road in the suburb of Mentone. The most recent relocation was in April 2015 to new facilities at 2 Parliament Street, Brighton. Southern FM Programs Southern FM presents an extremely wide and diverse mixture of general entertainment and specialist interest music and spoken word based programs. The programme is designed for targeted listening. Southern FM, like many other community radio stations in Melbourne, has incorporated many non- English speaking groups into the programme schedule. Southern FM is licensed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority (originally as a \\"C\\" class community radio station). The classifications system for varying designations of community radio broadcast stations no longer apply). Southern FM operates on a power output of 200 watts ERP from Moorabbin. This provides reception on a car radio throughout most of the metropolitan area. The longest serving on air presenters at Southern FM include Peter Kemp (Peter's Preferences), Andrew Rennie (The Space Show), David Kaffey (Midday Magic) and Bruce Mitchell (Southern Sport). Presenters who had moved on from Southern FM include a small group who founded and participated in the first broadcasts of the now defunct temporary youth broadcasting station Hitz FM - this was following from the success in 1991 of a Saturday Night radio programme NightBeat.

The extensive Liberty Truck exhibit covers the development and production of the Army's first standardized truck design, a 5-ton cargo hauler produced using interchangeable parts. Also included are letters from soldiers about their experiences with the trucks. World War II receives coverage with several exhibits including Operation Mulberry which was an operation to construct two artificial harbors on the Normandy coast to support the invasion. This operation used 158 tugboats including 74 of the Army's \\"small tugs\\" to tow 59 Gooseberry derelict ships to be sunk as breakwalls and the Phoenix caissons and Lobnitz floating piers. Another exhibit focuses on the Red Ball Express, the massive supply operation that supported Patton's advance after D-Day. The exhibit includes photos and paintings of the trucks as well as a diorama of a rest stop/repair depot featuring cargo trucks and a wrecker. Additional materials address the massive fuel and oil consumption needs as well as soldier experiences. The museum has an extensive Vietnam War exhibit, including a large diorama with the gun truck Eve of Destruction (believed the only surviving Vietnam era gun truck, and named after a protest song), an exhibit depicting a downed UH-1 Iroquois in a rice paddy, as well as bicycles used by the Viet Cong. The museum has an extensive collection of gun truck images, organised by the truck name, which are also on the museum's web site. Outdoor exhibits include the vehicle park with a selection of representative vehicles used in the transport command including a DUKW. A marine park has Army water vessels such as a tugboat, J-Boat, and various sized amphibious craft including landing craft and wheeled barges. A C-7 Caribou The aviation pavilion exhibits aircraft, fixed wing and helicopter, from the Korean War to the present, including a HZ-1 Aerocycle, an OH-23 Raven helicopter and a vertical take-off/landing plane. An unrestored Avrocar is kept in storage. The rail section has several significant artifacts including the railway cars used in the Berlin duty train as well as standard issue tank switchers, and a collection of typical rolling stock including cranes, freight cars and maintenance of way equipment.

Fraser, 1913-1988\\", Prometheus Research Library. was an American Trotskyist and the principal theoretician of the doctrine of revolutionary integrationism in the 1950s within the Socialist Workers Party (US), against George Breitman's advocacy of support for black nationalism. He joined the Trotskyist movement in 1934, and was a founding member of the Socialist Workers Party (SWP) in the US. He made a study of the black question in the late 1940s, after the Party began to lose hundreds of black recruits. This was due not only to the rise of McCarthyist repression of the SWP, but also, of the party's burgeoning opportunism on the question of black nationalism. Informally, the leadership had even begun discouraging white and black members from forming interracial couples. In the 1950s, Fraser disputed the notion that blacks in the U.S. were a nation, pointing to the fact that they lacked a separate culture, language, and especially, geographic territory and autonomous market economy: the requirements for nationhood. The struggle for equality had always been the main goal and task of blacks in the U.S., argued Fraser in speeches he made and internal documents he wrote for the SWP. Nationalism was the product, not of hope for blacks, but arose during periods of despair and disillusionment when whites‚Äîcapitalists during Reconstruction, trade union bureaucrats in the 20th century‚Äîbetrayed them. In these writings and speeches, Fraser also carefully analyzed the historical, post-Civil War class structure and dynamics of the U.S. South and the U.S. in general, in the process updating W. E. B. Du Bois's Black Reconstruction. Fraser disputed the slogan of the SWP majority calling upon the U.S. to \\"Send Federal Troops to Mississippi,\\" arguing that this was a reformist slogan building illusions in the benevolence of the U.S. ruling class and its state, and a capitulation to the middle-class reformist black leadership of the Civil Rights Movement. Though he disagreed with them about the nature of the Cuban workers state, Fraser was a theoretical father figure to the SWP's Revolutionary Tendency (RT) led by James Robertson and Tim Wohlforth, later expelled when the RT opposed the reentry of the SWP into the United Secretariat of the Fourth International (USFI). Fraser himself left the SWP in the mid-1960s after the SWP refused to call for solidarity with the Viet Cong, and instead called for \\"Troops Out Now\\", a liberal slogan. With his wife Clara Fraser, Fraser formed the Freedom Socialist Party, but left as the result of a divorce/custody battle with Clara. He died on 27 November 1988.

This was due to St. Augustine of Hippo, who was influenced by the early Neoplatonists Plotinus and Porphyry, as well as the works of the Christian writer Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, who was influenced by later Neoplatonists, such as Proclus and Damascius. Late antiquity Certain central tenets of Neoplatonism served as a philosophical interim for the Christian theologian Augustine of Hippo on his journey from dualistic Manichaeism to Christianity. As a Manichee, Augustine had held that evil has substantial being and that God is made of matter; when he became a Neoplatonist, he changed his views on these things. As a Neoplatonist, and later a Christian, Augustine believed that evil is a privation of good and that God is not material. Perhaps more importantly, the emphasis on mystical contemplation as a means to directly encounter God or the One, found in the writings of Plotinus and Porphyry, deeply affected Augustine. He reports at least two mystical experiences in his Confessions which clearly follow the Neoplatonic model. According to his own account of his important discovery of 'the books of the Platonists' in Confessions Book 7, Augustine owes his conception of both God and the human soul as incorporeal substance to Neoplatonism. Many other Christians were influenced by Neoplatonism, especially in their identifying the Neoplatonic One, or God, with Yahweh. The most influential of these would be Origen, who potentially took classes from Ammonius Saccas (but this is not certain because there may have been a different philosopher, now called Origen the pagan, at the same time), and the late 5th century author known as Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. Neoplatonism also had links with Gnosticism, which Plotinus rebuked in his ninth tractate of the second Enneads: \\"Against Those That Affirm The Creator of The Kosmos and The Kosmos Itself to Be Evil\\" (generally known as \\"Against The Gnostics\\"). Due to their belief being grounded in Platonic thought, the Neoplatonists rejected Gnosticism's vilification of Plato's demiurge, the creator of the material world or cosmos discussed in the Timaeus. Although Neoplatonism has been referred to as orthodox Platonic philosophy by scholars like Professor John D. Turner, this reference may be due in part to Plotinus' attempt to refute certain interpretations of Platonic philosophy, through his Enneads. Plotinus believed the followers of gnosticism had corrupted the original teachings of Plato. Despite the influence this philosophy had on Christianity, Justinian I would hurt later Neoplatonism by ordering the closure of the refounded Academy of Athens in 529.See Rainer Thiel, Simplikios und das Ende der neuplatonischen Schule in Athen, and a review by Gerald Bechtle, University of Berne, Switzerland, in the Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2000.04.19. Online version retrieved June 15, 2007. Middle Ages Pseudo- Dionysius proved significant for both the Byzantine and Roman branches of Christianity. His works were translated into Latin by John Scotus Eriugena in the 9th century. Neo-Platonism in Orthodox theology From the days of the Early Church until the present, the Orthodox Church has made positive selective use of ancient Greek philosophy, particularly Socrates, Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics. Constantine Cavarnos, Orthodoxy and Philosophy, The Institute for Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies, 2003 pages For example, the term ‚Äòlogos‚Äô (Greek ŒõœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ ) originated with Heraclitus and meant reason or thought. In the Christian context, Logos takes on a deeper meaning and becomes a name for the second person of the Trinity. The writer and theologian Gregory Palamas gives four distinct meanings for the term ‚Äòlogos‚Äô. Gregory Palamas, ‚ÄòThe One Hundred and Fifty Chapters‚Äô, in The Philokalia, The Complete Text Volume 4, translated by Palmer, Sherrand and Ware, published 1995 Faber and Faber. pages 360-361 The most important principle to keep in mind is that early Christianity developed in a Greek milieu and a common vocabulary was used in philosophical, spiritual and theological writing. However, the meanings of words sometimes evolved along different lines. In other cases, philosophical ideas and concepts were sometimes adapted and changed by Christian writers. Any exegetical endeavor trying to unravel the influence of Neo-Platonic thought on Christian theology needs to keep these principles in mind. One should also note that philosophy was used quite differently in the Eastern and Western theological traditions. The writings attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite are among the most enigmatic works of late antiquity. Byzantine scholars such as Gregory Palamas cited Dionysius especially in matters of Mystical Theology such as theoria, the divine energies and the unknowability of God.Gregory Palamas, The Triads, edited by John Meyendorff, Paulist Press 1983. At present, modern theologians and philosophers Sarah Coakley and Charles M. Stang, Re-thinking Dionysius the Areopagite, John Wiley and Sons, 2009 are still debating whether Dionysius was a Neo-Platonist with Christian influences or a Christian writer with Neo-Platonic influences. Among Orthodox scholars, the latter view seems to be shared by such writers as Andrew Louth Andrew Louth, Denys the Areopagite, Continuum Books, 1989, Pages 20-21 and Vladimir Lossky. Vladimir Lossky, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, St. Vladimir‚Äôs Seminary Press, page 29 However, other Orthodox scholars such as John Meyendorff believe that the Neo-Platonism of Dionysius exerted both positive and negative influences on Orthodox theology.John Meyendorff, Byzantine Theology, Historical Trends and Doctrinal Themes, Fordham University Press, 1974, pages 27-28) Meyendorff maintains that Dionysius has led to some confusion in the areas of liturgical and ecclesiological formulations. Renaissance Marsilio Ficino, who translated Plotinus, Proclus, as well as Plato's complete works into Latin, was the central figure of a major Neoplatonist revival in the Renaissance. His friend, Giovanni Pico della Mirandola was also a major figure in this movement. Both were students of Jewish mystical Kabbalah, which was heavily influenced by Neoplatonism. Renewed interest in Plotinian philosophy contributed to the rational theology and philosophy of the \\"Cambridge Platonist\\" circle (B. Whichcote, R. Cudworth, J. Smith, H. More, etc.). Renaissance Neoplatonism also overlapped with or graded into various forms of Christian esotericism. Christoplatonism Christoplatonism is a term used to refer to a dualism, which holds spirit is good but matter is evil, opined by Plato, which influenced the Church. According to author Randy Alcorn, Christoplatonism directly \\"contradicts the Biblical record of God calling everything He created good.\\" See also *Augustine of Hippo *Basil the Great *Cambridge Platonists *Cappadocian Fathers *Christ the Logos *Gregory of Nazianzus *Gregory of Nyssa *Irenaeus *Maximus Confessor *Neoplatonism and Gnosticism *Origen *Pseudo- Dionysius * Allegorical interpretations of Plato References  Further reading  * Edwards, Mark. 2006.

The story had previously been adapted in 1910 by Mario Gallo, in the now considered lost film Camila O'Gorman. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, marking the second time an Argentine film was nominated for this award. Plot The film opens with \\"In memory of Camila O'Gorman and Ladislao Guti√©rrez\\". Argentina, c. 1827: Ana Perichon de O'Gorman is brought from a Brazilian convent to house arrest where she is confined to her room in the hacienda of her estranged son, Adolfo O'Gorman. Adolfo, who despises his mother for having had an adulterous affair decades earlier, treats her with unveiled contempt. Camila, a baby when her grandmother arrives, later also initially rejects her grandmother. When Ana asks Camila whether she enjoys love stories, the girl responds that she doesn't know any. In 1847, Camila (Sus√∫ Pecoraro) is a Buenos Aires socialite. Having been raised on her grandmother's stories about her affair with former Colonial Viceroy Santiago de Liniers and their surviving love letters, Camila secretly reads French romance novels and books by political refugees like Esteban Echeverr√≠a. She is courted by Ignacio, a wealthy man with whom she is not in love. Her fellow socialites, who see marriage as a business arrangement, urge her to not let Ignacio get away. In reply, Camila bursts into tears as she describes her longing to marry for love and for a husband she could feel proud. Her socialite friends are stunned. Meanwhile, Adolfo has come to enthusiastically support the fascist Caudillo Juan Manuel de Rosas, whom he praises for restoring order after the Argentine civil wars of the 1810s and 1820s. Camila, however, is horrified by the state terrorism which Rosas routinely uses against real and imagined opposition. She openly expresses these views, which always enrages her father, who constantly reprimands her for doing things that are \\"not for women.\\" One day, during confession, she meets a Jesuit priest, Father Ladislao Guti√©rrez (Imanol Arias). Camila immediately develops a crush on him, but after hearing Fr. Ladislao furiously denounce Rosas' death squads from the pulpit as she wishes she could, she falls deeply in love. Fr. Ladislao first rebukes Camila when she comes on to him and feels deeply ashamed that he returns her feelings. He attempts to do penance with a whip before sinking into a life-threatening fever. During the funeral of her grandmother, Camila learns that Fr. Ladislao is ill and rushes to his bedside. To her shock, she finds him caressing a handkerchief which she had given him, ostensibly as a gift to the poor but really as a token of love. She also kisses him on the lips, and he did not resist it. Upon his recovery, Fr. Ladislao finally surrenders to Camila's advances. For a time, they conduct a discreet affair, but Fr. Ladislao is visibly troubled by the hypocrisy of his public priesthood and his private violation of his vows. Abandoning everything, Fr. Ladislao and Camila elope to Corrientes Province, where they pose as a married couple. Fr. Ladislao works as a school teacher and swiftly gains the admiration and gratitude of the village. Camila and Ladislao live in a small house on the side of a road. At one moment, a religious procession passes by the house and seems to cast a shadow over the couple. Later, Camila is ecstatically happy and tells Ladislao how proud she is to be his, \\"wife.\\" However, Ladislao remains torn between his love for Camila and a deep longing for his abandoned priesthood. During an Easter fiesta, Ladislao is recognized by Father Miguel Gannon, a Buenos Aires priest who angrily greets him with the words, \\"God does not forget his chosen. Do you hear me, Father Ladislao Guti√©rrez?\\" With his troubled conscience brought to a crisis, Fr. Ladislao runs to the village church and screams at the Eucharist in the tabernacle \\"Why can't You leave me in peace!\\" Meanwhile, Father Gannon notifies the village's police commandante. The latter, feeling grateful to Ladislao for teaching his children to read, warns Camila that he will do nothing until morning. He urges her and Ladislao to immediately flee across the Brazilian border. Deeply grateful, Camila frantically searches for Fr. Ladislao to tell him the news. When she finds him kneeling in prayer before the altar of the church, she bursts into tears, knowing that he has made his peace with God. The next morning, Fr. Ladislao returns to Camila to say goodbye. Although he says that he still loves her, Fr. Ladislao explains that he must return to Buenos Aires, do penance, and continue his priestly ministry. Visibly ashamed, he apologizes to Camila for what he has done to her. Saddened but unremorseful, she responds, \\"I knew what I was doing.\\" To both their horror, the \\"Commandante\\" and his men arrive and arrest them both. Meanwhile, Camila's father, Adolfo O'Gorman, is infuriated by how the family name has been dragged through the mud by Camila's actions. Despite the pleas of Ignacio and the rest of the family, he writes to Rosas and demands the death penalty for his daughter. With the Church Hierarchy and his political allies demanding retribution, and his exiled opponents exploiting the scandal, for political gain, Rosas issues a decree that both Camila and Fr. Ladislao are to be shot without trial. In a military prison, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are forbidden to see each other. While imprisoned, Camila learns that she is carrying Fr. Ladislao's child. Heartbroken, she calls out from her cell, \\"Ladislao! We are going to have a baby! We are going to have a baby!\\" Despite the fact that the Law of Argentina forbids the execution of pregnant women, Rosas refuses to delay Camila's death sentence. After begging the prison chaplain to save her unborn child, the chaplain gives Camila glass of holy water to drink and thus baptizes her unborn child. Fr. Ladislao sends her a final letter affirming his love for her and saying that, because they could not be together on earth, they will be reunited in heaven before the throne of God. On August 18, 1848, Camila and Fr. Ladislao are tied to chairs, blindfolded, and carried before a firing squad in the prison courtyard side by side. The soldiers gun down Fr. Ladislao without hesitation, but they initially balk at killing a pregnant woman. When the Commandante threatens to shoot them if they refuse to obey God's will (as interpreted by Rosas), they open fire, riddle Camila's stomach with bullets, and place both bodies into the same coffin. The camera pans over the soldiers, the courtyard, and the Argentine flag, before lingering over Camila and Ladislao's coffin. Their final words are repeated in voiceover: \\"Ladislao, are you there?\\", \\"By your side, Camila\\". Cast * Sus√∫ Pecoraro as Camila O'Gorman * Imanol Arias as Ladislao Guti√©rrez * H√©ctor Alterio as Adolfo O'Gorman * Elena Tasisto as Joaquina O'Gorman * Carlos Mu√±oz as Monsignor Elortondo * H√©ctor Pellegrini as Commandant Soto * Boris Rubaja as Ignacio, Camila's suitor Influences Bemberg intended to portray Camila as a daring woman invested in love, as opposed to the historical narrative of Camila being seduced and virtually kidnapped by her lover. No actor portrays the dictator Juan Manuel de Rosas and his actions are inferred only from the statements of other characters. This, and his constant presence in portraits, have caused some film critics to compare him to the ubiquitous Big Brother from George Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. One of the themes of the film is politics and censorship. Filming started on 10 December 1983, the day Democracy was re-established in Argentina. During their elopement, Fr. Ladislao and Camila have sexual relations inside a horse-drawn coach. This is derived from a similar scene in the novel Madame Bovary by Gustav Flaubert. Historical inaccuracy The real Camila O'Gorman, photographed shortly before her execution at Santos Lugares Prison * In the film, the Catholic Church is depicted as unconditionally supporting Rosas' dictatorial rule. Father Ladislao Gutierrez is inaccurately depicted as the sole exception among the clergy. From his first appearance at Camila's birthday celebration, Fr. Gutierrez is rebuked by his fellow Jesuits for not wearing the Scarlet insignia of the ruling Federalist Party. One of his superiors then pins the Rosista badge on the cassock of the visibly uncomfortable young priest. Later, when he denounces Rosas' police state tactics from the pulpit during mass, the senior pastor of the parish also rebukes him. In reality, the Society of Jesus, in which both Fr. Gutierrez and Camila's brother were priests, was the only institution within Argentine Catholicism which actually had a policy of speaking out. Their vocal criticism of his rule ultimately caused Rosas to sign a decree expelling all Jesuit priests from Argentina.Leslie Bethell (1993), Argentina Since Independence, Cambridge University Press. Page 27.John Lynch (2001), Argentine Caudillo: Juan Manuel de Rosas, Scholarly Resources, Wilmington, DE. Page 85. * Camila's father, Adolfo O'Gorman, is depicted as a tyrannical and self-righteous autocrat who, in the words of one reviewer, \\"makes Elizabeth Barrett Browning's father look like Santa Claus.\\"\\"New York Times,\\" March 15, 1985 Adolfo's response to Camila's elopement is to blame her for the scandal which has ruined his good name. Adolfo's hatred of his daughter and obsession with making her pay causes Camila's mother to curse the day she married him. More recent scholars have attempted to paint a different picture of Adolfo O'Gorman. In a letter to Rosas sent immediately following his daughter's elopement, Adolfo O'Gorman placed the blame squarely on Fr. Ladislao Gutierrez, who, he claimed, had seduced his daughter, \\"under the guise of religion\\". Adolfo further described himself and his family as heartbroken and pleaded that his daughter be rescued from the man he regarded as her abductor. Scholars who have read the letter believe that Adolfo genuinely loved his daughter.Adolfo O'Gorman's Letter to Juan Manuel de Rosas, December 21, 1847 * When her husband refuses to ask for clemency for their daughter, Camila's mother laments that no one cares about her daughter's life. Adolfo, she says, cares only about his honor, while Rosas, the Federalist Party, and the Church care only about maintaining power, and the Unitarian Party cares only about using the scandal for political gain. \\"But no one\\", she screams, \\"cares about my daughter!\\" In reality, a large number of people begged Rosas to grant clemency, including the Leader's own daughter, Manuelita. Rosas' decision to ignore their pleas and execute a pregnant woman horrified his supporters, sent shock waves across South America, and, according to some historians, contributed to his overthrow and exile in 1852.

Member of IL-12 family - IL-35 is produced by wide range of regulatory lymphocytes and plays a role in immune suppression. IL-35 can block the development of Th1 and Th17 cells by limiting early T cell proliferation.  Structure   IL-35 and its receptor  IL-35 is a dimeric protein composed of IL-12Œ± and IL-27Œ≤ chains, which are encoded by two separate genes called IL12A and EBI3 (Epstein-Barr virus-induced gene 3), respectively. IL-35 receptor consists of IL-12RŒ≤2 (part of the IL-12R) and gp130 (part of IL-27R) chains. Compared to these two related interleukins, IL-35 is also able to signal through only one of the aforementioned chains. This was proven in vivo when absence of either of the receptor chains did not influence effects of IL-35. On regulatory B-cells, IL-35 signals through the IL-12RŒ≤2 and IL-27RŒ± subunits. EBI3 is a homologue to IL-12 p40 and to the ciliary neurotrophic factor receptor, whose expression is induced in B lymphoblastoid cells by EBV infection  Function   Expression  Secreted by regulatory T-cells (Tregs), regulatory B-cells (Bregs) or even CD8+ regulatory T cells, IL-35 suppresses inflammatory responses of immune cells. IL-35 is not constitutively expressed in tissues, but the gene encoding IL-35 is transcribed by vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and monocytes after activation with proinflammatory stimuli. IL-35 has selective activities on different T-cell subsets; it induces proliferation of Treg cell populations but reduces activity of Th17 cell populations.  Role in disease  = Autoimmune conditions = Studies in mice show the absence of either IL-35 chain from regulatory Tregs reduces the cells' ability to suppress inflammation. This has been observed during cell culture experiments and using an experimental model for inflammatory bowel disease. A group of scientists established a CIA (collagen-induced arthritis) mouse model to show suppressive effects of IL-35. Intraperitoneal injection of IL-35 in the tested subjects lowered expression of several factors linked to this disease (such as VEGF and its receptors, TNF-Œ±). The effect of IL-35 in this case seems to be the inhibition of STAT1 signalling pathway. Another experiment performed on a mouse model of EAE has shown, that mice lacking IL-35-producing B cells are unable to recover from the T-cell mediated demyelination but are resistant to infection by pathogenic intracellular microbe Salmonella typhimurium. In T1D (type 1 diabetes), plasma level of IL-35 is lower than healthy individuals. IL-35 production by Tregs is decreased in mouse models of T1D, and administration of IL-35 prevents the development of experimental T1D and reverses established experimental T1D. In T1D patients with remaining C-peptide, IL-35 production by Tregs and Bregs is much higher than T1D patients with no remaining C-peptide. = Infectious diseases = It has been shown that IL-35 increases replication of HBV virus both in vitro and in transgenic mice by targeting its transcription factor HNF4Œ±. Tumor Given its suppressive function, IL-35 is also involved in tumor progression and tumor immune surveillance. Elevated circulating IL-35 levels have been found in several human tumors such as acute myeloid leukemia, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and colorectal cancer.

Early life Cockfield Hall Charles was the son of Sir William Blois, of Grundisburgh Hall and his first wife Martha Brooke (died 1657), daughter of Sir Robert Brooke (1572-1646) of Cockfield Hall and his wife Elizabeth. However as his mother died very soon after his birth, Charles's father remarried to Jane Barnardiston (daughter of Sir Nathaniel Barnardiston (1588-1653) of Kedington, Suffolk), who had previous been married to Charles's uncle John Brooke, brother of Martha.

Career Blois was an Alderman of Dunwich from 1685 and was appointed to the commission of the peace for Suffolk in 1685. On 15 April 1686 he was created Baronet Blois, of Grundisburgh and Cockfield Hall. In March 1688, he was appointed a Commissioner for inquiry into recusancy fines for Cambridgeshire, Norfolk and Suffolk. He was removed from the Dunwich corporation in June 1688 but was restored in November 1688 and was Commissioner of assessment for Suffolk from 1689 to 1690, and for Dunwich and Ipswich in 1689. He was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Ipswich in a by-election on 28 May 1689. A very active Member of the Convention Parliament, he was appointed to 36 committees. He was returned in a contest as MP for Ipswich at the 1690 English general election and as a Court Tory continued a high level of activity in Parliament.D.W. Hayton, 'Blois, Sir Charles, 1st Bt.

In 1693 Blois succeeded his aunt Mary Brooke to the Yoxford estate, which gave him an electoral interest at Dunwich. His wife Mary died in 1693 and he married as his second wife, by licence dated 18 April 1694, Anne Hawtrey, daughter of Ralph Hawtrey, MP of Eastcote House, Ruislip, Middlesex.For Hawtrey, see E.

He was defeated at Ipswich at the 1695 English general election and did not stand in 1698. Blois was returned as MP for Dunwich at a by-election on 29 January 1700 and followed up with a return unopposed at the first general election of 1701. He was blacklisted for opposing the preparations for war with France. On his return unopposed at the second general election of 1701, he was classed with the Tories and voted on 26 February 1702 for the vindication of the impeachment proceedings against William III's ministers. He was returned unopposed at the 1702 election and was active in Parliament with local matters. He voted for the Tack on 28 November 1704. At the 1705 English general election he was again unopposed at Dunwich and voted against the Court candidate for Speaker on 25 October 1705. There was a contest at Dunwich at the 1708 British general election and he was elected in the poll but was unseated on petition on 5 February 1709. He did not stand for Parliament again. He was bailiff of Dunwich in 1708 and from 1711 to 1712 and probably a portman in 1709. Death and legacy Blois died on 9 April 1738 and was buried at Grundisburgh.Will of Sir Charles Blois, Bart. (P.C.C. 1738, Brodrepp quire). By his first wife Mary, he had three sons, of whom two predeceased him, and a daughter. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his surviving son Charles. By his second wife Anne, he had two sons (of whom one predeceased him) and a daughter Anne. Their son Ralph also succeeded to the baronetcy.

He was a social activist in Afro-Brazilian politics ( \\"Movimento Negro\\"). Biography Ubirajara Fidalgo started his career yet teenager in his hometown Caxias municipality in the state of the Maranh√£o and died in Rio de Janeiro on 3 July 1986. Philosophy of TEPRON At the age of 18, Fidalgo moved to Rio de Janeiro and two years later (in 1970) founded The Black Professional Theater. Fidalgo's goal was to insert Black artists into the performing arts field. He included Black artists from all walks of life, including many young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods. They worked along with professional actors to form Fidalgo's company. The philosophy of TEPRON was to address the \\"questao negra (black question)\\" on Brazilian stages. The 'Black Question' on the streets and in institutions, was drowned out by the cries of \\"racial democracy \\" reinforced by the then military dictatorship. Instead of focusing on racial differences and looking at groups' needs separately, the military government wanted to view Brazilian society as one where everyone was equal, irrespective of ethnic background whether this was realistic or not. Although its first production was William Shakespeare's 'Othello', the company went on to perform works written by Fidalgo that conveyed political messages. This trend started with a monologue titled 'Desfuga' that was performed in the early 1980s. According to the original advertisement of the show, Desfuga, \\"portrays the racial problem of the black Brazilian , invoked by conflicts caused by miscegenation and paternalistic education that distorts the real interests of the colored man.\\" After the performance, Fidalgo welcomed distinguished guests from the audience like politicians, artists, researchers, social activists and students into a discussion with him. These post-play discussions continued and offered a space for political, social and racial issues to be dissected within the Afro- Brazilian community. The company's success was reflected by three main productions, \\"Desfuga\\", \\"Fala pra eles Elisabete\\" and \\"Os Gazeteiros\\". All three productions remained in theatre for three years after they were performed by the company in the 1970s. Ultimately, TEPRON offered a space for talent to be cultivated within the black community. Fidalgo helped to advance the black identity in theatre while educating society on issues like homophobia, racism, misogyny, and the military dictatorship. Today, TEPRON remains significant in Brazilian history and the advancement of Brazilian theater.

WKMX-FM is a 100,000 watt Top 40 station owned by Gulf South Communications and features a lineup with The Bert Show in mornings and D.C. in afternoons. History In 1974, veterinarian Jones Wallace Miller was granted a construction permit for a new FM radio station to broadcast with 100,000 watts of effective radiated power on 106.7 MHz. It began broadcasting on November 27, 1974. In 1979, WKMX was broadcasting a middle of the road music format. In June 2004, WKMX Inc. (Wallace Miller, president) made a deal to sell WKMX after 30 years of continuous ownership to Styles Media Group LLC (Thomas A. DiBacco, managing member) for a reported sale price of $4.5 million. The deal gained FCC approval on August 4, 2004, and was consummated on September 3, 2004. In 2006, Styles Broadcasting became the Magic Broadcasting Company. After the sale to Magic Broadcasting, the WKMX studio and business offices were moved from downtown Enterprise to a facility on the 7th and 8th floors of the historic Houston Hotel, since renamed the Charles Woods Building, in downtown Dothan. In 2011, the station was sold again, this time along with sister properties WTVY-FM, WJRL-FM, WLDA, and WBBK-FM. WKMX and WTVY were sold to Gulf South Communications, where they became sister stations to WDJR and WUSD, while WJRL-FM and WLDA were sold to Southeast Alabama Broadcasters, which now owns them along with WDBT and WESP. WBBK was sold to a third company, Alabama Media Investments. The sale was consummated on December 1, 2011. As a result of this sale, the WKMX studio moved to its current location on Highway 231 on Dothan's northwest side.

Failure to correctly determine the size and abundance of component grains >2 mm was also a source of error.

Julio Llamazares (born March 28, 1955) is a Spanish author born in Vegami√°n, Le√≥n Province. Biography Julio Llamazares is a poet, novelist and a prolific essayist and journalist. He focuses on themes such as the history and memory of Spanish society, both individual and collective and, in particular, the progressive decline of the rural cultural heritage. His work encompasses multiple genres, including 6 novels as well as various collections of poems, short stories and essays, travel writing, screenplays and journalism. He has had a regular column in El Pa√≠s since the early 1980s and has been featured on radio and TV. His first works were two collections of poetry: La lentitud de los bueyes, first published in 1979 and La memoria de la nieve, published in 1982. His first novel, Luna de lobos, was published in 1985 and made into a film in 1987, directed by Julio S√°nchez Vald√©s, with a cast including Santiago Ramos, Antonio Resines and Kiti M√°nver. It relates the story of a group of four fugitives caught on the wrong side of enemy lines in the early days of the Spanish civil war, who held out for nine years hiding in the Cantabrian mountains in attempt to avoid the savage Nationalist repression. It has recently been translated into English and published as Wolf Moon. In the words of Dr Chris Bannister, writing for the Arts & Humanities Research Council, ‚ÄúWolf Moon is a moving account of the horrors of Francoism and the pressures the dictatorship exerted upon those that lived under it.‚Äù His second novel, La Lluvia amarilla, was published in 1988 (translated into English and published as The Yellow Rain), relates the story of the last inhabitant of Ainielle, a village in the province of Huesca in the Spanish Pyrenees, now abandoned and in ruins. For many years Llamazares has indicated that he does not wish his publications to be considered for any further prizes. In 2016, he respectfully withdrew his most recent novel, Distintas formas de mirar el agua, from the short list for the Premio de la Cr√≠tica de Castilla y Le√≥n (Castilla & Leon Critics' Prize).

It was one of two flightless rails that had survived on the island until the arrival of people in 200 C.E. It was the larger of two species of rail found on the island of Oahu. There were several specimens of this bird found in early settlements. It was tall, had a beak, and a neck long. Its wings were on average less than long, making it flightless. The Great Oahu crake was probably a brown, grey, and black bird like its recently extinct relatives the Hawaiian and Laysan rails. It probably fed on the fruits, leaves, and flowers of trees that fell onto the ground. The cause of extinction is not very well known, but we can speculate that it was hunted for meat, and that its bones and feathers were used for decoration. It may have also have been attacked by the Polynesian rats that were introduced by early settlers.

The station, established in 1968, is currently owned and operated by Frontdoor Broadcasting, LLC. WTXK broadcasts a sports format to the Montgomery, Alabama, area. Programming includes syndicated programming from ESPN Radio. In addition to the 1210 AM frequency, WTXK also broadcasts its programming on translator W298BC (107.5 FM) in Montgomery. History The 1190 years This station began regular broadcast operations on October 5, 1968, as a 1,000 watt daytime-only AM station at 1190 kHz known as WAYD under the ownership of Wade B. Sullivan. WAYD aired a country & western music format through the entire 1970s. In October 1981, Wade B. Sullivan reached an agreement to sell WAYD to RJG Communications, owned by Raymond F. Akin, Gordon L. Bostic, and J.A. Baxter Jr. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 3, 1981. RJG Communications in turn agreed in February 1983 to sell this station to MSB Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 8, 1983. Just over two years later, in August 1985, MSB Communications, Inc., contracted to sell this station to HS Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on September 18, 1985, and the transaction was consummated on February 10, 1986. The 1200 years WAYD received a construction permit on June 16, 1986, that authorized a move from 1190 kHz to 1200 kHz and a power increase to 10,000 watts during the day and to 2,500 watts during critical hours operation. The station received its license to cover this move and upgrade on April 20, 1987. In October 1988, HS Broadcasting, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Wesley R. Morgan. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 10, 1988, and the transaction was consummated on December 29, 1988. On December 9, 1988, the new owners had the FCC change the station's call letters to WFSF. In March 1989, Wesley R. Morgan agreed to transfer the broadcast license for WFSF to the Morgan Broadcasting Limited Partnership. The transfer was approved by the FCC on April 21, 1989, and the transaction was consummated on May 2, 1989. This ownership change would prove short-lived as in April 1990 Morgan Broadcasting Limited Partnership agreed to sell this station to Sunrise Broadcasting Corp. The deal was approved by the FCC on June 21, 1990, and the transaction was consummated on June 29, 1990. Internal corporate shifts saw the license transferred to Sunrise Broadcasting of Alabama, Inc., in August 1991. On July 9, 1993, the station was assigned the WQLS callsign. The 1210 years WQLS was granted a new construction permit in July 1995 that authorized an increase in critical hours signal power to 5,000 watts and the addition of nighttime broadcasting at 35 watts but necessitating another frequency shift, this time to the current 1210 kHz. The station began broadcasting at the new frequency in March 1997 but did not receive the license to cover the change from the FCC until July 12, 2002. In September 1995, Sunrise Broadcasting of Alabama, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Woods Communications Group, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 21, 1995, and the transaction was consummated on January 20, 1996. In March 2000, Jimmy Jarrell of Auburn, Alabama, reached an agreement to purchase news-talk formatted WQLS from Woods Communication Group Inc. of Dothan, Alabama (Carl Blackmon, secretary/treasurer) for a reported sale price of $12,000. The deal gained FCC approval on 2000-05-02 and the transfer was consummated on 2000-06-20. In May 2002, Styles Broadcasting Inc. (Kim Styles, CEO) reached an agreement to purchase country music formatted WJRL-FM and gospel music formatted WQLS from Jimmy Jarrell for a reported sale price of $750,000. The deal gained FCC approval on June 24, 2002, and the transfer was consummated on 2002-08-01. 2006-2008 station logo In December 2006, Horizon Broadcasting Company reached an agreement to purchase WQLS from Magic Broadcasting, LLC., for a reported $125,000. The deal gained FCC approval on January 16, 2007, and the transfer was consummated on April 24, 2007. Horizon operated WQLS as a \\"full Gospel radio station\\" with a Gospel music format until it went off-the-air in late January 2008 due to a fire. Dark times In August 2008, Hughey Communications, Inc. (owned by Randall and Debra Hughey) agreed to purchase this dark station from Wayne North's Horizon Broadcasting Company for a reported sale price of $50,000 in cash. The deal was approved by the FCC on November 19, 2008, and the transaction was consummated on January 26, 2009. On December 30, 2008, WQLS applied to the FCC for special temporary authority to broadcast with reduced power (1,000 watts daytime and critical hours, 3 watts at night) from temporary facilities at the existing tower site. The station had been destroyed by a fire and was off the air for almost all of 2008. If the station had not returned to the air by January 28, 2009, they risked the automatic forfeiture of their broadcast license for remaining silent for more than 12 months. The FCC granted this temporary authority on January 6, 2009, with a scheduled expiration of July 6, 2009. The station filed for an extension of this authority in March 2009 which the FCC finally granted on December 17, 2009, with a scheduled expiration of January 29, 2010. New city, new owner, new format On May 13, 2009, the station applied to change its community of license from Ozark, Alabama, near Dothan to Pike Road, Alabama, near Montgomery. The FCC granted a construction permit for this relocation on November 20, 2009, with a scheduled expiration of November 20, 2012. With construction and testing complete, the station was granted an updated broadcast license for the Pike Road location on February 22, 2010. License holders Hughey Communications, Inc., reached an agreement to sell WQLS to Frontdoor Broadcasting, LLC, in December 2009. The FCC approved the deal on January 19, 2010, and the transaction was consummated on January 28, 2010. The new owners had the FCC change the station's call sign to WTXK on March 12, 2010. The call sign was changed to match the station's new branding as \\"The Ticket\\", a sports talk format that took effect in late March 2010. The move also resulted in WTXK simulcasting its new programming on FM translator W298BC (107.5 FM) in Montgomery.

The town is on the Puyuhuapi Channel at the outflow of Cisnes River. The town is located in the northwestern portion of the Ays√©n Region, an area that includes numerous islands, fjords and channels. The major island is Magdalena Island, which contains the national park that bears its name. Queulat National Park straddles the border between this commune and Lago Verde. Much of the commune area is covered with a lush vegetation and is divided by the Moraleda Channel. The main mountain of the area is Melimoyu volcano. Climate  Location  To get to Puerto Cisnes, you must stray approximately 30 kilometers off of the Carretera Austral. The city itself has two entrances, one at the beginning of the city and one at the end. The first entrance has new road which has been redone recently due to the inflow of new tourists, while the other is the original road of Puerto Cisnes and it has more than enough pot holes. The location of Puerto Cisnes is why it has been named the capital of the Cisnes Commune, which contains roughly 5,000 people. It's basically located right in the middle of its outlying Peninsulas of Puerto Gala and Puerto Gaviota and because the region travels more by ocean it has easy access to the other ports of the commune. It's located 196 kilometers outside of the city of Coyhaique.  Economy  The most viable economic possibilities for those living in Puerto Cisnes are the salmon industry due to the plentiful rivers and also trade. However, due to the increasing growth of tourism in their summer months, many have adapted to deal with many touristic services which include activities from adventures and hikes to personal tours. This also includes services of any type of living, hotels, cabins, hostels and more. The rest of the cities commerce includes restaurants of food of all types, gas stations and a bank. Other jobs include local volunteer fire fighters for the Bomberos de Chile, Hospital Jorge Ibar, police officers for the Carabineros de Chile and the location of Chile's Navy, the Armada de Chile right off the coast.

Provence was a very poor region after the 18th century, but in the 20th century it had an economic revival and became the site of one of the most influential buildings of the 20th century, the Unit√© d'Habitation of the architect Le Corbusier in Marseille. Provence, in the southeast corner of France, corresponds with the modern administrative region of Provence-Alpes- C√¥te d'Azur and includes the departments of Var, Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne, Alpes-de- Haute-Provence, as well as parts of Alpes-Maritimes and Vaucluse. The original comt√© de Provence extended from the west bank of the Rhone River to the east bank of the Var river, bordering the comt√© of Nice. Provence culturally and historically extended further west of the Gard to N√Æmes and to the Vidourle river. Gordes, in the Vaucluse, is a classic example of a Proven√ßal hilltop village.  Prehistoric and ancient sites in Provence (27,000 BC to the 2nd century BC)  The jardin des Vestiges in Marseille, with remains of the ancient Phocaean port city of Massalia, discovered in 1967 during construction work. Remains of a prehistoric settlement dating to between 27,000 and 19,000 BC were found by divers in 1991 at the Cosquer Cave, an underwater cave in a calanque on the coast near Marseille.Clottes, J., Beltr√°n, A., Courtin, J. et Cosquer, H. (1992) - ¬´La Grotte Cosquer (Cap Morgiou, Marseille)¬ª, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Pr√©historique Fran√ßaise, t. 89, 4, pp. 98-128. A neolithic site dating to about 6000 BC. was discovered in Marseille near the current Saint Charles railway station, which has remains of walls made of baked clay with holes for posts, as well as tools. Marseille was founded in about 546 BC by Greek colonists coming from the city of Phocaea (now Fo√ßa, in modern Turkey) on the Aegean coast of Asia Minor, who were fleeing an invasion by the Persians. They called their settlement Massalia. Traces of the original settlement have been found on the west side of the butte Saint-Laurent in Marseille. The original settlement extended to the east toward the butte des Moulins and finally the butte des Carmes, covering about fifty hectares. The size of the original settlement were not exceeded until the 17th century. Remains of the ancient Phocaean fortifications of Massalia dating to the end of the 7th century BC can be seen in the Jardin des Vestiges and on the butte des Carmes. In the 2nd century BC the entire system of fortifications were rebuilt in pink limestone. Parts of the ramparts can still be seen in the Jardin des Vestiges.Treziny, Les fortifications de Marseille dans l'Antiquit√©. In M. Bouiron, H. Tr√©ziny √©d., Marseille.

According to the historian Strabo and other ancient sources, the city of Massalia had temples to Apollo and Artemis, but no trace of them remains. The only remaining structure from ancient Massalia are the cellars of Saint- Sauveur, near the Place de Lenche in Marseille. They probably served as either a granary or an arsenal.(H. Tr√©ziny, Les caves Saint-Sauveur et les forums de Marseille. In M. Bouiron, H. Tr√©ziny √©d., Marseille. Trames et paysages urbains de Gyptis au Roi Ren√©.

The Phocaeans also established colonies at Nice, Arles, Cannes and south of N√Æmes. Later the region was also inhabited by Celts, who were also known as the Liguress or Celto-Ligurians. who built oppida, or forts. Little trace remains of their architecture.Dominique Garcia, La Celtique m√©diterran√©enne. Paris, Errance, 2004, 206 p.)  Roman monuments in Provence (20 BC to 476 AD)  In the 2nd century BC, the Romans began their conquest of the region, sending legions which defeated the Ligurians and destroyed their fortresses. In 123 BC the Romans founded Aquae Sextiae, and two years later began a new town at Nemausa (today N√Æmes.) The Roman colony known as provincia was organized in about 120 BC. A Roman road, the Via Domitia, named for Roman Consul Domitius Ahenobarbus, was built to connect Rome with the Pyrenees, following the path of the old Greek Way of Hercules. It led to a great expansion of commerce in the region. In the 1st century BC, Roman legions completed the conquest of Gaul and began building towns, triumphal arches, amphitheatres, theatres, public baths and aqueducts in Provence. The Roman aqueduct of Pont du Gard (1st century AD), built during the time of the Emperor Claudius, is one of the most impressive examples of Roman civil engineering. Fifty meters above the Gardon, it is the highest existing Roman aqueduct. The aqueduct carried water a distance of fifty kilometres. The Triumphal Arch of Orange at Orange, Vaucluse, was probably built to honor the veterans of the 11th legion in about twenty BC, during the time of the Emperor Augustus, and was later dedicated to the Emperor Tiberius. It was designed to show travellers to the new Roman province the superiority and power of Rome. The triumphal arch near the Roman town of Glanum, just outside Saint-R√©my-de- Provence, shows Roman soldiers leading away defeated prisoners. It was constructed between 10 and 25 AD, sometime after the Romans had conquered the town, which was inhabited by Celto-Ligurians. Glanum was destroyed in 260 AD. by the Alamanni, a Germanic tribe, as the Roman Empire began to crumble. The Roman theatre in Orange, Vaucluse, was constructed by the Emperor Augustus in the early 1st century BC, is the best-preserved Roman theatre in Europe. It was closed by the authorities of the Christian church in 391 because of its \\"barbaric spectacles\\" and not re-opened until the 19th century. Today, it is the home of music and theatre festivals. The Arles Amphitheatre was built in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD, when Arles was the capital of Roman Provence. It was used for combat by gladiators and other spectacles. It has a diameter of 102 meters, and could hold twelve thousand spectators. The Maison Carr√©e in N√Æmes, built in 16‚Äì19 BC, is one of the best-preserved Roman temples in the former Roman Empire. It survived intact because it was converted into a Christian church in the 4th century AD. It was built according to the principles of Vitruvius, the chief theoretician of ancient Roman architecture. In the early 19th century, it was chosen as the model for the church of the Madeleine in Paris.

Sometimes Roman temples, such as the temple at N√Æmes, were turned into churches. Often churches were built on the sites of Roman temples or fora (Arles and Aix-en-Provence) and used columns, such as the columns in the baptistery at Fr√©jus, and other elements of Roman temples. Many of the churches were built in a new style, later called Romanesque, which combined Gallo-Roman architectural elements with elements of a new style coming from Lombardy in Italy. It was particularly influenced by the new churches in the Byzantine style in Ravenna. The Romanesque style in Provence and the valley of the Rh√¥ne had some regional decorative elements, borrowed from the Gallo- Romans, particularly the use of eagles and busts, traditional ancient Roman elements, to decorate the capitals of Corinthian columns.Histoire de l'Art, Flammarion -Moyen √Çge - Chr√©tient√© et Islam, p. 244. The baptistery of the Fr√©jus Cathedral (406‚Äì409 AD), built shortly before the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, is the oldest Christian structure in Provence, and one of the oldest buildings in France. The octagonal building, about seven metres across, is covered by a dome set on arches supported by columns. In the center of the building is an octagonal baptismal font 1.3 meters deep and 92 centimetres long, large enough for the person baptized to be immersed in the water. It was only discovered in 1925, hidden behind later modifications to the church, and restored.Denizeau 2003, p. 32. Montmajour Abbey (French: Abbaye Notre Dame de Montmajour) is a fortified Benedictine monastery built between the 10th and 13th century on what was then an island five kilometres north of Arles, in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne d√©partement. The Abbey is famous for its 11th‚Äì14th century graves, carved in the rock, its subterranean crypt, and its massive unfinished church. It was an important pilgrimage site during the Middle Ages, and in the 18th century it was the site of a large Maurist Monastery, now in ruins. In the 12th century, monks of the Benedictine Order broke away to form a new order, the Cistercians, who adhered strictly to the rules of St. Benedict. Cistercian monasteries were located in remote valleys next to rivers, were devoted to prayer, meditation, and manual labor, and were built following religious principles to avoid anything that would distract the monks from their prayers. S√©nanque Abbey, near Gordes (1178) S√©nanque Abbey was the first Cistercian monastery founded in Provence in 1148. The church was finished in 1178. A small community of monks still lives in the Abbey. The lavender fields around the Abbey make it one of the most photographed spots in Provence. Thoronet Abbey, in a remote valley near Draguignan, in the Var department, was founded in 1160. The cloister is among the oldest Cistercian cloisters still existing. Le Corbusier visited the monastery in 1953 and imitated the play of light and shadow in his priory of Sainte Marie de La Tourette, near Lyon. It also influenced the modern monastery by John Pawson at Nov√Ω Dv≈Ør Monastery, in the Czech Republic. Thoronet Abbey is now a museum open to visitors. Silvacane Abbey was founded in 1175, the third of the Cistercian monasteries known as the Three Sisters of Provence. It is located by the Durance River at La Roque-d'Anth√©ron, between Avignon and Aix-en-Provence. It is open to the public, and is the only one of the three that no longer serves a religious purpose. It hosts prestigious piano and vocal music festivals. The Church of St. Trophime (Trophimus) is a Roman Catholic church and former cathedral built between the 12th century and the 15th century in the city of Arles, in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department. The sculptures over the portal, particularly the Last Judgment, and the columns in the adjacent cloister, are considered some of the finest examples of Romanesque sculpture. The church was built upon the site of the 5th century basilica of Arles, named for Saint Stephen.Jacques Thirion, Saint-Trophime d'Arles dans Congr√®s Arch√©ologique de France - 1976 - Pays d'Arles, page 360: :\\"\\"Cette nouvelle cath√©drale (note : Saint-Trophime), b√¢tie en exploitant les monuments romains tout proches, fut plac√©e, comme l'atteste la Vie de saint Hilaire √©crite apr√®s 461, sous un vocable dont la vogue √©tait toute r√©cente, celui de saint Etienne, dont les reliques avaient √©t√© d√©couvertes en 415.\\"\\" In the 15th century a Gothic choir was added to the Romanesque nave. Aix Cathedral (Cath√©drale Saint-Sauveur d'Aix) in Aix-en- Provence shows the transition from Romanesque to Gothic architecture. It is built on the site of the 1st century Roman forum of Aix, and was re-built from the 12th until the 19th century; it includes Romanesque, Gothic and Neo-Gothic elements, as well as Roman columns and parts of the baptistery from a 6th- century Christian church.

The first purely Gothic church in Provence was the Basilica Sainte Marie-Madeleine in Saint- Maximin-la-Sainte-Baume, which was begun in 1295. It was built to contain what was believed to be the sarcophagus of Mary Magdalene, which was discovered in a Gallo-Roman crypt in Saint-Maximin in 1279. The basilica was consecrated in 1316, but the Black Death in 1348, which killed half the local population, interrupted construction. Work started again in 1404, and the sixth bay of the nave was completed in 1412. Work continued until 1532, when it was decided to leave the basilica just as it was, with an unfinished west front, and neither a portal nor bell towers. The church today has a main apse flanked by two subsidiary apses. The nave has no transept, and is flanked by sixteen chapels in the aisles. In the crypt is displayed what is said to be the skull of St. Mary Magdalene. In other parts of Provence, Romanesque churches were transformed into Gothic ones. In Aix-en-Provence, two new wings of the transept of Aix Cathedral were built in the Gothic style between 1285‚Äì1230, and the cathedral was turned bay by bay into a Gothic church, paralleled the growth of importance of Aix. In Arles, a Gothic choir replaced the Romaneque abside of the Church of St. Trophime between 1445 and 1465.Thirion: \\"L'abside romane de Saint-Trophime est remplac√©e par un chevet gothique lors de travaux ex√©cut√©s entre 1454 et 1465\\"\\" The finest Gothic building in Provence was the Palais des Papes in Avignon, which became the residence of the Popes when Pope Clement V moved the Papal Curia to Avignon, a period known as the Avignon Papacy. The Palace was one of the largest and most important buildings in Europe. Construction was begun by Pope Benedict XII and continued by his successors. The construction of the , heavily fortified palace consumed most of the income of the papacy during this period. It served as the residence of two antipopes, Clement VII and Benedict XIII, before the papal court finally returned permanently to Rome. While the outside of the palace looked like a fortress, the inside was lavishly decorated with tapestries, sculptures, and decorated wooden ceilings. The Pont d'Avignon, also known as the Pont Saint- B√©n√©zet, which crossed the Rh√¥ne River between Avignon and Villeneuve-l√®s- Avignon became one of the wonders of the medieval world. The Romans had built a wooden bridge across the Rh√¥ne at the same point, which was replaced by a stone Romanesque bridge built between 1177 and 1185. That bridge, except for four arches, was swept away by a flood in 1226. A new bridge was constructed in the Gothic style between 1234 and 1237, which was 900 metres long, resting on 22 arches. A chapel to Saint Nicholas, with two chapels, one Romanesque and the other Gothic, was located on the bridge fourth arch, where a toll was collected from voyagers in the form of a donation to the Saint. During the Middle Ages the Avignon bridge was the only bridge across the Rh√¥ne between Lyon and the mouth of the Rh√¥ne. It was also located on one of the main pilgrimage routes between Italy and Saint-Jacques-Compostelle. The bridge began to collapse in the 17th century, first one arch in 1603, then three more in 1605. These were repaired, but in 1669 a new flood carried away most of the bridge, leaving only four arches.Denizeau 2003.

Rule eventually passed to the Counts of Toulouse and the Counts of Barcelona (later Kings of Aragon). Because of the repeated invasions, Proven√ßal architecture was designed to resist attack. Monasteries were surrounded by towers and walls, and even the bishop's residence in Fr√©jus resembled a fortress. Castles on hilltops surrounded by walled towns became the characteristic architectural feature of Provence. Only in the 17th century, after the Wars of Religion had ended and the French king had established his authority, were the towns of Provence safe from outside attack. The village of Roussillon, Vaucluse, in the Luberon area, has vestiges of a 10th-century ch√¢teau and an 11th-century church. It is famous for its pinkish and yellow stone; in the 18th century, mines around the town produced pigment to make the color ochre. Les Baux-de-Provence, on a high rocky hilltop in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department, was inhabited as early as 6000 BC. and had a Celtic fort in the 2nd century AD. In the Middle Ages, the Lords of Les Baux, who claimed ancestry back to Balthazar, one of the Three Kings of the Nativity, ruled over a domain of 79 towns and villages. The Counts were deposed in the 12th century, the last princess died in the 15th century, and the town became part of France. In 1632, when the town became a Protestant stronghold, Cardinal Richelieu ordered castle and town walls destroyed. Gordes, in the Vaucluse, was originally a hilltop fort of the Celtic tribe of the Vordenses, then a Roman fort guarding the Roman road between Carpentras and Apt. A castle was built by Guillaume d'Agoult in the 9th century, which dominated the valley. In the 13th century, the town joined Savoy in a war against France. In the 14th century, during the Hundred Years' War, the whole town was encircled by strong walls. In 1481, after the death of Ren√© I of Naples, Gordes was incorporated into France.

During the Wars of Religion (1562‚Äì1598), it held some 3500 Huguenots, or French Protestant prisoners. It is best known as the prison of the fictional Count of Monte Cristo of Alexandre Dumas, p√®re. The Ch√¢teau of Tarascon, in the Bouches-du-Rh√¥ne department, was begun in 1400 by Louis II of Anjou, and finished by his son, Ren√©. The Citadel of Sisteron, was built on a rocky spur overlooking the Durance River on the strategic route through the Alps to the Mediterranean Sea. A Roman fort and a feudal castle first occupied the site. Then, from 1590 to 1597, Jean Erard, the military architect of king Henry IV, built a new kind of fortification designed to defeat armies with cannons and modern weapons. It featured walls laid out in a sawtooth pattern of recesses and salients, so all parts of the wall could be covered by gunfire; terraces and trenches to slow approaching armies; and interior walls and fortified gates to subdivide the fortress and prevent attackers from capturing it all in one attack. Many of these features were adapted and improved a century later by the military architect Vauban.

The citizens of Arles built a new H√¥tel de ville (town hall), designed by the Arles architect Jacques Peytret aided by Jules Hardouin- Mansart, which had a large central court with a perfectly smooth vaulted ceiling, without a central column, supported entirely by the carefully joined stones resting on fine Doric columns. The H√¥tel de ville symbolized the rise of the power of the bourgeoisie and showed that civil architecture could be as beautiful and powerful as religious architecture or royal palaces. File:France Arles Place Republique.JPGThe H√¥tel de ville and Place Republique in Arles (1675)  Second Empire style (19th century)  The Toulon Opera, built in the flamboyant style of the French Second Empire, was begun at the same time as the Paris Op√©ra of Charles Garnier, and illustrated the importance of Toulon as the main base of the French Navy. The architect was L√©on Feuch√®re. Construction was begun in 1860, and it opened in 1862. It boasted exceptional acoustics and seats for 1800 spectators, making it, after Paris, the second- largest opera house in France. File:Op√©ra-Toulon.jpgThe Opera House of Toulon (1862)  The Neo-Byzantine style (19th century)  The Basilica of Notre-Dame de la Garde in Marseille was built between 1853 and 1864 on the highest point in the city in the neo-Byzantine style. It was finished ten years before its famous sister, the Basilica of Sacr√©-Coeur in Paris, was begun. It was designed by the architect Henri-Jacques Esp√©randieu. The main feature of the church is a 197-foot (60 m) belfry with a statue of the Virgin and Child, visible miles out to sea.

A mas a largely self-sufficient economic unit, which could produce fruits, vegetables, meat, milk, and even silk. The house was usually built of local stone with a sloping Roman tile roof, and was a long rectangle, two or three stories high, with the kitchen and space for animals on the ground floor, and bedrooms, storage space for food, and often a room for raising silkworms on the first floor. As the family grew larger, the mas would be extended to make new rooms. The mas nearly always faced the south, to provide protection from the Mistral and it had few and very small windows, to keep out the summer heat and to keep in the heat in winter.Livet, Roger, Habitat rural et structures agraires en Basse-Provence.Massot, Jean-Luc, Maisons rurales et vie paysanne en Provence. A bastide was the house of a wealthier farmer, and usually was in the shape of a square, with an interior courtyard. In the 19th and 20th centuries many bastides were occupied by wealthy city residents from Marseille.  Corbusier in Provence (20th century)  The Unit√© d'habitation in Marseille, also known as the Cit√© radieuse de Marseille, designed by the architect Corbusier in 1946-1952, became one of the most influential buildings of the 20th century. Built of unfinished concrete (steel was not available because of the war), it had nineteen stories with 330 apartments of twenty different designs, along with shops, a restaurant, a hotel, clinic, sports facilities, a roof terrace, an outdoor auditorium, and a kindergarten. It was meant to be \\"a machine for living,\\" with everything needed under a single roof. Corbusier built five versions of the Unit√© d'habitation, and it inspired similar buildings in other parts of France, Germany and in Britain; it became a model for new apartment buildings and public housing projects in the 1950s. It was praised and much criticized as the first example of Brutalist architecture.Lemoine 2000, pp. 272-273. Other buildings by Corbusier in Provence: * Cabanon de vacances, 1952. Corbusier stayed several times in the Villa E 1027 in Roquebrune-Cap- Martin, and was commissioned in 1952 by Thomas Rebutato, the owner of a local restaurant, to build a beachside cabin, or cabanon. It was limited to 16 square meters, was made of wooden logs and plywood, and was to be furnished with only a couch, a table, and a sink. It was part of Corbusier's effort to standardize every genre of architecture. Later he added a tiny office next to the cabin.Lemoine 2000.

C. S. Paniker (1911‚Äì1977) was a metaphysical and abstract painter from India. He interpreted the country's age-old metaphysical and spiritual knowledge in the 1960s, when Indian art was under the influence of the Western painters. \\"That was the time when a few Indian artists were trying to break out of this Western influence and establish an idiom and identity of their own,\\" he said. In 1976, he was awarded the highest award of the Lalit Kala Akademi, India's National Academy of Art, the Fellow of the Lalit Kala Akademi for lifetime contribution. Early life and education Born in Coimbatore on 31 May 1911, Paniker received his education in present-day Kerala and later in Tamil Nadu.K. C. S. Paniker Biography Cholamandal Artists' Village website The lush green village where Paniker lived influenced the colourful landscapes of his early years. The bright colours stayed in his paintings, even though he moved away from landscapes and onto other subject matters. A virtual child prodigy, Paniker began painting landscapes when he was 12. By the age of 17, he was exhibiting at the Madras Fine Arts Society's annual shows. In 1928, he gave up college education to take up a job at the Indian Telegraph Department to support his family after the death of his father. At the age of 25 he joined the Government School of Arts and Crafts, Chennai (1936‚Äì40). Career Since 1941, Paniker has been holding one man shows in Chennai and Delhi. He founded the Progressive Painters‚Äô Association (P.P.A), in Chennai in 1944. In 1954 he got his first international exposure when he held exhibitions at London and Paris. He became the principal of the Government College of Fine Arts, Chennai, in 1957, and in 1966 formed the Cholamandal Artists' Village, 9 km from Chennai, with his students and a few fellow artists. The exhibitions abroad and his exposure to abstract artists like Salvador Dal√≠ had a major influence on his art. \\"They hark back to the weird, but spiritually uplifting figurative exaggerations of ancient Indian painting and sculpture,\\" Paniker said. The colours he used were bright and sunny, as are colors in the paintings of the Impressionists. Somewhere down the line, Paniker moved on to use calligraphy and symbols to project a state of metaphysical abstraction. KCS Paniker died in Madras at the age 66 on 16 January 1977. Legacy KCS Paniker is considered as a leading figure in the Madras Art Movement. He is the founder of Cholamandal Artists' Village.

In photography and cinematography, a reflector is an improvised or specialised reflective surface used to redirect light towards a given subject or scene. Types Apart from certain highly specialized components found in enlargers, projectors and scanners, photographic reflectors fall into two main groups: Lamp reflectors Diagram of a lamp reflector, showing path that light typically takes from a light source. Umbrella - studio flash. Similar to a domestic lampshade, these reflectors are fixed to an artificial light source (for example, a filament bulb or flash tube) to direct and shape the otherwise scattered light, reflecting it off their concave inner surfaces and directing it towards the scene to be photographed. Although there are a large number of variants, the most common types are: * spherical, short-sided, giving a relatively broad spread of light; * parabolic, providing a tighter, parallel beam of light. The reflector factor is the ratio of the illumination provided by a lamp fitted within a reflector to the illumination provided without any reflector fitted. A matte reflector will typically have a reflector factor of around 2, due to its more diffuse effect, while a polished or metallic- finished reflector may have a factor of up to 6.Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Leslie Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia, (Focal Press, 3rd edn.) p. 689 Board reflectors Also known as plane reflectors, \\"flats\\" or bounce boards, this kind of reflector is located independent of a light source; the light is reflected off its surface, either to achieve a broader light source, or control shadows and highlights, or both. This kind of reflector generally has a very low reflectivity factor that varies widely according to surface texture and colour.Focal Encyclopedia of Photography, Leslie Stroebel, Richard D. Zakia, (Focal Press, 3rd edn.) p. 60 As a result, it is most commonly used to control contrast in both artificial and natural lighting, in place of a fill light or \\"kick\\" light. In this case, light \\"spilling\\" from the main ambient or key light illuminating a scene is reflected back into the scene with a varying degrees of precision and intensity, according to the chosen reflective surface and its position relative to the scene. Reflectors may also be used as a means of increasing the size of the main light source, which may (or may not) retain a direct path to the scene. By positioning a board reflector close to a light source, its effective size can be increased by \\"bouncing\\" the light off it.Basic Photography Course A very common example of this technique is the traditional umbrella reflector, invented by George Larson , typically having a gold, silver or matte white interior onto which a lamp fitted with a circular reflector is projected, providing a broad, soft illumination. The lamp faces away from the scene to be photographed, allowing only reflected light to be thrown forward. Types of Reflector. 1 Dispersive reflector. 2 Holophane. 3 optical combination 4 concentrating 5 Angle. Techniques with board reflectors A portable folding reflector positioned to \\"bounce\\" sunlight onto a model Reflectors vary enormously in size, colour, reflectivity and portability. In tabletop still life photography, small mirrors and card stock are used extensively, both to reduce lighting contrast and create highlights on reflective subjects such as glassware and jewelry. Larger-scale subjects such as motor vehicles require the use of huge \\"flats\\", often requiring specialised motorized winches to position them accurately. Location photography calls for much more portable materials and a large range of lightweight, folding reflectors are commercially available in a variety of colors. Bounce lighting Photographers make regular use of walls, ceilings and even entire rooms as reflectors, especially with the interior of buildings which may lack sufficient available light. Often known as \\"bounce flash\\" photography, but equally common with Tungsten lights in cinematography, this technique was pioneered by Subrata Mitra in 1956. The area to be photographed is lit by walls off-camera, which then provide illumination similar to that of a large window. When \\"bounced\\" off a ceiling, the lighting resembles that of fluorescent tubes. As this very broad, flat lighting is more typical of an overcast day outdoors, a more realistic interior illumination is achieved by reducing the power of additional lighting relative to the available light, so that either source may act as a fill to the other. Hence bounce lighting may provide either the primary or secondary (fill) light source, depending on its intensity. Outdoor techniques Walls also make ideal reflectors outdoors, reflecting sunlight back upon a subject and reducing shadows (and hence overall contrast) according to the color, size and proximity of the wall. A more readily available alternative is the portable, lightweight, collapsible reflector, commercially available in a range of sizes and colors, or improvised using a sheet of card stock or even a bed sheet. Stands may be erected to retain these reflectors, although it is often much more convenient and practical to have an assistant hold and move them.

The station, established in 1992, is owned by Robert Holladay and the broadcast license is held by Alabama Media, LLC. Programming WECB currently broadcasts a country music format branded as \\"B105.3\\" to the Dothan, Alabama, area. This latest format shift took effect on December 20, 2011. History Launch In June 1988, Chattahoochee Broadcast Associates applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for a construction permit for a new broadcast radio station. The proposed station would serve Chattahoochee, Florida, with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power on a frequency of 105.3 megahertz from an antenna in height above average terrain. The FCC granted this permit on July 20, 1989, with a scheduled expiration date of January 20, 1991. The new station was assigned call sign \\"WUMG\\" on January 9, 1990. In April 1990, the station requested a modification of the permit to increase the effective radiated power to 6,000 watts. The FCC granted the request on December 14, 1990, and set a new expiration date of June 14, 1991. After one further extension to the permit and after construction and testing were completed in October 1991, the station was granted its broadcast license on October 30, 1992. WBCD era The station changed its call sign to \\"WBCD\\" on February 15, 1994. In January 1996, station management applied to the FCC for authorization to relocate their transmitter, raise the antenna, increase the effective radiated power, and change city of license from Chattahoochee, Florida, to Headland, Alabama, a suburb of Dothan, Alabama. In April 1996, this application was amended to lower the power and further raise the antenna and relocate to a different tower site but retained the move from Chattahoochee to Headland. The FCC granted a new construction permit to make these changes on October 10, 1996, with a scheduled expiration of April 10, 1998. When completed, the station's antenna would be in height above average terrain broadcasting with 5,100 watts of effective radiated power. While construction was underway, Chattahoochee Broadcast Associates reached an agreement in April 1996 to sell this station to Styles Broadcasting of Alabama, Inc. The FCC approved the deal on May 29, 1996, and the transaction was consummated on February 5, 1997. In November 1996, between the sale and the consummation, Styles Broadcasting of Alabama, Inc., applied to transfer the WBCD broadcast license to Gulf South Communications, Inc. The FCC approved the move on January 27, 1997, pending consummation. In January 1997, with the sale nearly complete, the station applied to again modify the construction permit. This time the power would be raised to 11,500 watts while the antenna was lowered from the previous authorization to above average terrain. The FCC approved this modification on May 28, 1997, and extended the expiration date to April 10, 1998. In September 1997, with construction and testing completed, WBCD applied for a new broadcast license to cover these changes. The Commission granted this new license on April 6, 1998. 2000s The station applied for a new call sign and was assigned \\"WZND\\" on August 23, 2002. The station was assigned the call sign \\"WDBT\\" by the FCC on March 26, 2004, to match its branding as \\"105.3 The Beat\\". On September 15, 2006, the station dropped its urban contemporary format branded as \\"105.3 The Beat\\" in favor of a classic country music format. News/Talk branding This format lasted just under two years as when The Radio People acquired former News/Talk station WUSD on September 8, 2008, they swapped formats between the two stations. The news/talk radio format was branded as \\"105.3 The Voice.\\" Syndicated programming on \\"105.3 The Voice\\" included Fox Sports Radio, plus talk shows hosted by Dave Ramsey, Neal Boortz, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, Lars Larson, Dennis Miller, and Jim Bohannon. Overnight, the station broadcast the syndicated Coast to Coast AM hosted by George Noory. New owners In February 2011, WDBT was part of an elaborate multi-station deal that saw Magic Broadcasting exit the Dothan market by selling WBBK-FM to Alabama Media Investments, LLC, WLDA and WJRL-FM to Southeast Alabama Broadcasters, LLC, and WKMX and WTVY-FM to Gulf South Communications, Inc. To meet FCC ownership caps, Clay E. Holladay's Gulf South Communications, Inc., agreed to sell WDBT and sister station WESP to Georgia Edminston's Southeast Alabama Broadcasters, LLC, for a total of $500,000. After overcoming a formal objections by another local broadcaster, the FCC approved the deal on November 25, 2011, with the caveat that consummation would have to take place before December 1, 2011, or wait until each station's license was up for renewal. The transaction for WDBT and WESP was consummated on November 30, 2011. In late December 2011, Southeast Alabama Broadcasters, LLC, announced that they would be selling all four of the stations it had just acquired (WDBT, WESP, WJRL-FM, and WLDA) to Robert H. Holladay‚Äôs Alabama Media, LLC. The combined sale price for the four stations was announced as $1.2 million. While the sale was pending, Holladay had been operating the stations under a local marketing agreement since November 30, 2011. The transaction was consummated effective December 5, 2012. On December 23, 2011, the station was granted new call sign \\"WECB\\" by the FCC.

It was written as the result of a visit in 1741 to the court of Frederick the Great in Potsdam, where Bach's son Carl Philipp Emanuel had been appointed principal harpsichordist to the king the previous year. It was dedicated to Michael Gabriel Fredersdorf, the king's valet and private secretary, who, like the king, was an amateur flautist.See: Origins and musical structure Joachim Quantz, 1735 The surviving nineteenth-century sources for the sonata carry dedications to Frederick the Great's private secretary, Michael Gabriel Fredersdorf: one of the earliest hand copies of BWV 1035 is annotated \\"after the autograph by the composer, which was written anno 17--, when he was at Potsdam, for privy chamberlain Fredersdorf.\\" Fredersdorf had been taught to play the flute by his father, a stadtpfeifer in Frankfurt. He acted as an intermediary with the Dresden flautist-composer Joachim Quantz, who not only composed for Frederick but also gave him lessons and supplied him with instruments. When Frederick became king in 1740, he appointed Bach's son Carl Phillip Emanuel as the principal court harpsichordist. One and a half year's later in December 1741, Quantz also joined the court where he served as composer and flute teacher until the end of his career. Before that, in the summer of 1741 Bach made his first visit to Berlin, staying near the royal palace on Unter den Linden with his friend Georg Ernst Stahl, a court doctor. As his correspondence with his family in Leipzig shows, on this first visit Bach did not have an official audience with the king, but‚Äîin view of the dedication‚Äîmust have conferred with Fredersdorf. * Adagio ma non tanto, E major * Allegro, E major * Siciliano, C minor * Allegro assai, E major The opening Adagio ma non tanto contains many expressive and elaborate baroque ornaments including the king's favourite \\"tierces orn√©es\\"‚Äîintermediate notes added to a falling third, creating a sighing Affekt. As comments, this was probably the only time Bach used ornamentation of this kind. :1000px The alternation of the semidemiquaver melismas with the semiquaver triplet passages along with the passages of coupled semiquaver figures are also typical of Bach's Leipzig style. Likewise the dancelike Allegro in a lively time signature follows the pattern of his Leipzig works, an acquiescence to the galant style so popular at the time. In the slow Siciliano, the opening theme of the flute is taken up in canon a bar later in the bass line. The movement itself is in the key of C minor, but modulates through many keys before returning to the original key. The last Allegro assai also has galant elements, with its binary form‚Äîlike the second and third movements‚Äîand its quirky dancelike rhythms. Both fast movements contain trills and brilliant semiquaver passagework. has suggested that BWV 1035 can be considered as a sonata da camera, with the first movement playing the role of a prelude and the subsequent binary movements corresponding to dances. He has proposed that the fast movements correspond to specific dance forms: the second movement to a rigaudon, a French dance appearing for example in the fourth of Fran√ßois Couperin's Concerts Royaux (1722); and the fourth movement to a spritely polonaise.

Selected recordings The sonata was written for transverse flute and continuo, but has been arranged for other instruments (see above). The sonata, and its transposed version in F major for alto recorder, are part of the standard examination repertoire for the ABRSM and other national examining boards.The baroque flute in the mid-eighteenth century had only one key and was tuned to baroque pitch, a lower pitch than present concert pitch, in which the modern transverse flute is tuned. The continuo part can be played on one or more instruments. Along with other flute sonatas by Bach, the sonata has entered the standard repertoire used for examination purposes for both flute and recorder in several countries, when it is usually performed with piano accompaniment from an authorised edition using a fixed realisation of the figured bass.

Its date of composition is uncertain, though on the basis of its advanced playing technique, which is more demanding than in the flute part for the Fifth Brandenburg Concerto, for example, it must have been written after 1723.Christoph Wolff and Walter Emery, \\"Bach, ¬ßIII: (7) Johann Sebastian Bach\\", The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, second edition, edited by Stanley Sadie and John Tyrrell (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001). The title, however, is the work of 20th- century editors. The title in the only surviving 18th-century manuscript is \\"Solo p[our une] fl√ªte traversi√®re par J. S. Bach\\". History The discoverer of the sole surviving manuscript, Karl Straube, believed it to be an autograph and this view was accepted by Alfred Einstein. However, more recently it has been shown that it was made by two copyists. Although their names are unknown, one appears to be identical with the principal scribe of another manuscript, P 267 (containing the violin sonatas and partitas, BWV 1001‚Äì1006), which places this part of the copy of the Partita in the first half of the 1720s. The other scribe is the one now known as \\"Anonymous 5\\", an employee of Bach who must have accompanied him when Bach moved from K√∂then to Leipzig in 1723. This scribe is known from authentically dated copies of the Cantatas BWV 186 (11 July 1723) and BWV 154 (9 January 1724). On the basis of watermarks and textual criticism, the greater part of the manuscript was probably copied in Leipzig in 1723‚Äì1724, while the copyist of the first five lines of the Partita suggest it may have been begun slightly earlier, between 1722 and 1723 in K√∂then.Hans-Peter Schmitz, \\"Partita A-moll f√ºr Flauto traverso solo, BWV 1013\\", in Johann Sebastian Bach, Neue Ausgabe s√§mtlicher Werke, Serie VI, Band 3 Werke f√ºr Fl√∂te: Kritischer Bericht, 7‚Äì9 (Kassel, Basel, Paris, London, New York: B√§renreiter, 1963): 7‚Äì8.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 52nd Academy Awards. \\"Maids\\" is used in the sense of \\"maidens\\", hence another translation could be The Maidens of Wilko. Plot At the age of 40, Wiktor Ruben (Daniel Olbrychski) returns to the family property (Wilko) where he'd spent his late teens/early twenties as a tutor of young sisters. Now they are all adult women - mostly wives and mothers. Wiktor discovers that Fela, once the closest to him, has been dead for some time; the other sisters aren't keen to talk about her, and her grave is mostly forgotten. He is also disappointed by how all the women have changed. Julia (Anna Seniuk), now a mother of two, doesn't resemble his first object of desire and doesn't show him the affection he might have expected. Jola (Maja Komorowska), seemingly unhappy in her marriage, chases him and makes fun of him until he doesn't bring the painful memories of the past. Kazia (Krystyna Zachwatowicz), a divorcee - and thus treated as less worthy than the others - is the most demanding partner of his intellectual reflections, while Zosia (Stanis≈Çawa Celi≈Ñska) is - as always - distant and outspoken. That leaves him with Tunia (Christine Pascal), who was only a child when he previously knew her, and who now resembles Fela. Wiktor spends time in Wilko, but isn't able to see that his return restored once forgotten dreams and hopes to the sisters.

Andrzej Wajda previously filmed another short story of Iwaszkiewicz, The Birch Wood in 1970 and would go to film yet another, Sweet Rush, in 2009. This particular film features impressive cast, very good (although non- original) score (music of Karol Szymanowski, who was a friend and cousin of Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz) and is otherwise technically brilliant. It received some awards in Poland and was nominated for an Oscar which it lost to The Tin Drum (also starring Olbrychski). Much of this happened because of deliberately avoiding anything that would trigger censorship from the communist authorities that governed Poland at that time. It is quite possible that the whole production was the results of games of influence inside the government- controlled film monopoly in Poland. It appears that the director Andrzej Wajda had built around himself enough buffer space to produce a clearly anti- communist film just two years later, Man of Iron.

Zw√∂lfter Theil. 1864. p. 324. ; 1718‚Äì1783) was a Slovak jurist, Imperial-Royal Court Councillor and Chief Imperial-Royal Librarian, a member of Natio Hungarica in the Kingdom of Hungary, a historian, ethnologist, an influential advocate of Empress Maria Theresa's Enlightened and centralist policies. His advancement of Maria Theresa's status in the Kingdom of Hungary as its apostolic ruler in 1772 was used as an argument in support of the subsequent Habsburg annexations of Galicia and Dalmatia. Koll√°r is also credited with coining the term ethnology and providing its first definition in 1783. Some authors see him as one of the earliest pro-Slovak, pro-Slavic, and pan-Slavic activists in the Habsburg Monarchy. Life Dates Koll√°r was born to the family of a lower nobleman probably during the week before the recorded date of his baptism on Sunday, 17 April 1718,J√°n Tibensk√Ω, Slovensk√Ω Sokrates. ≈Ωivot a dielo Adama Franti≈°ka Koll√°ra. 1983. in Terchov√°, now in Slovakia, then Tyerhova in the Kingdom of Hungary.

Sources also give other dates for his death, the 13th, and 15th of the same month. While Koll√°r is likely to have used Franti≈°ek as his middle name when he spoke in his native Slovak, he used the Latin Franciscus (also Adamo Francisco) or the German Franz as his middle name in all of his works, which were published only in the two languages. The version Franti≈°ek did not begin to appear as his middle name in Slovak and Czech publications until later in the 20th century. Hungarian texts use Ferenc. English texts have traditionally used Franz; the more modern practice is Franti≈°ek. Education Koll√°r's parents moved to Bansk√° Bystrica (Beszterceb√°nya) where he attended a Jesuit middle school. He later used the town's Latin name (Neosolium) as an appendix to his own name in some of his Latin publications ‚àí Pannonius Neosoliensis (\\"Pannonian of Beszterceb√°nya\\"). He continued his education in a preparatory high school (gymn√°zium) in another mining town, Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica (Selmecb√°nya), graduated in the university town of Trnava (Nagyszombat) and joined the Society of Jesus.

With his training in Turkish, Persian, and the classical languages, Adam F. Koll√°r was able to edit and publish or republish numerous manuscripts and earlier volumes from the collections of the Imperial-Royal Library. His annotated editions of texts in the languages of the Middle East area became particularly respected. As Koll√°r says in the introduction, he rediscovered the Turkish and Arabic fonts used by Mesgnien-Meninski in 1680 and employed them to reissue Mesgnien-Meninski's Turkish grammar. Koll√°r added transcriptions, texts of various treaties with the Ottoman Empire, translated it to Latin and added Arabic and Persian versions. Koll√°r's editorial work with manuscripts from various cultures and languages, in addition to his familiarity with the linguistic and cultural diversity of his native Kingdom of Hungary,Gheorghi≈£ƒÉ GeanƒÉ, \\"Discovering the whole of humankind: the genesis of anthropology through the Hegelian looking- glass.\\" In: Han F.

Koll√°r's word was rapidly adopted by Central European academics. It was taken up in 1787 by the German historian Johann Ernst Fabri at the University of G√∂ttingen and by Chavannes at the Academy of Lausanne. It began to appear in French by the 1820s and in English by the 1830s.Thomas Barfield, The Dictionary of Anthropology. 1997 Politics De Originibus & Usu... Adam F. Koll√°r was closely associated with the centralist policies of Empress Maria Theresa. Some of his publications were commissioned by her Court, although not marked as such, many others espoused its policies.Olwen H. Hufton, Europe: Privilege and Protest, 1730‚Äì1789. 1980. As a native of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg province that resisted centralization the most, he knew its situation. He devoted his 1764 work (On the Origins and Perpetual Use of the Legislative Powers of the Apostolic Kings of Hungary in Matters Ecclesiastical) to argue for the supremacy of the Habsburgs' rule over the Roman Catholic hierarchy, over the traditional legislative powers of the Kingdom's Diet and, indirectly, over the privileges of its nobility. Koll√°r supported his and the Habsburgs' position with a copious body of references to the Kingdom's history,Ernst Wangermann, The Austrian Achievement 1700‚Äì1800. 1973. his from 1762 already contained a large part of the documentation. Among other things, Koll√°r proposed that the tax-free status of the Kingdom's nobility be abolished. brought about the most explosive event in Koll√°r's political life. The book caused outrage during the 1764‚Äì1765 Diet attended by Maria Theresa and did nothing to reinforce her position. She launched damage control with a ban on further distribution of Koll√°r's book in the Kingdom of Hungary that included a recall of the sold copies, he was given a hint by the Habsburgs to write an apology, which he did half-heartedly in the form of a defense, and the Vatican put the book on its index librorum prohibitorum where it stayed for the next two centuries. The tensions between the Habsburgs and the Kingdom of Hungary remained largely unresolved during Koll√°r's lifetime and his stance brought him the wrath of his fellow noblemen in the province, but he did not relent.Horst Haselsteiner, \\"Cooperation and Confrontation between Rulers and the Noble Estates, 1711‚Äì1790.\\" In: Peter F. Sugar, et al., eds. A History of Hungary. 1990. He lived in Vienna, the capital of all of the Habsburg Monarchy, where his views were not merely au courant among its denizens, but actually radiated from the center of power. The publication of Koll√°r's (1764) was in line and perhaps coordinated with the Habsburgs' goals and he more than retained his status of Maria Theresa's favorite and influential academic partisan. He wrote in favor of the Habsburgs' Enlightened policies, opposed serfdom and advocated religious freedom in the whole monarchy. Maria Theresa turned to him with requests for a large number of position papers relevant to her policy.

Nationalism Linked to Adam F. Koll√°r's academic interest in ethnic diversity of Central Europe are his occasional comments on the developing relationships among its peoples. In tandem with his intensifying support for the suppression of the self-governing powers of the Habsburg provinces in favor of Maria Theresa's absolutist rule, he moved from his own closer identification with the Kingdom of Hungary still evidenced in the attribute Hungarus Neosoliensis he gave himself in the book he edited in 1756 (authors explain the Latin Hungarus used by ethnic non- Hungarians like Koll√°r as \\"a subject of the Kingdom's sovereign\\" rather than as a linguistic-ethnic attribute)Istv√°n So√≥s, \\"√ârtelemis√©gi mint√°k √©s a Hungarus-tudat.\\" In: ≈†tefan ≈†utaj and L√°szl√≥ Szarka, Region√°lis √©s nemzeti identit√°sform√°k a 18‚Äì20. sz√°zadi magyar √©s a szlov√°k t√∂rt√©nelemben. 2007. to the less explicit attribute Pannonius Neosoliensis (\\"Pannonian of Bansk√° Bystrica\\") with the name of the ancient Roman province of Pannonia as a symbolic reference to his native Kingdom's territory (although the area where he grew up, including Bansk√° Bystrica, was never part of that province)Franz Miklosich, ed.

He was one of the first academic authors who commented on the Slovaks and other Slavs of the Habsburg Monarchy and on linguistic and cultural identities of its subjects in addition to their determination by political borders. Along with his centralist Habsburg- Monarchic nationalism, authors see him as an early pro-Slovak, pro- Slavic,Dezs≈ë D√ºmmerth, \\"T√∂rt√©netkutat√°s √©s nyelvk√©rd√©s a magyar-Habsburg viszony t√ºkr√©ben.\\" Filol√≥giai K√∂zl√∂ny, 1966. and pan-SlavicRobert John Weston Evans, Austria, Hungary, and the Habsburgs: Essays on Central Europe, c. 1683‚Äì1867. 2006. activist in the Habsburg Monarchy. Some of the arguments brought forth by the Habsburgs in support of their annexation of parts of Poland in 1772 called on Koll√°r's writings on the Rusyns with the proto- ethnic-nationalist concept of their joint identity irrespective of the existing political boundaries.Paul R. Magocsi, The Rusyn-Ukrainians of Czechoslovakia: An Historical Survey. 1983. Educational reforms Koll√°r influenced some of Empress Maria Theresa's reforms, including her ordinance Ratio educationis in 1777, which aimed to standardize teaching methods, curricula, and textbooks.Ludwig von Gogolak, Die Nationswerdung der Slowaken und die Anf√§nge der tschechoslowakischen Frage 1526‚Äì1790: Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des slowakischen Volkes I. 1963.

It was historically known as Diocese of Ceneda, the name being changed in 1939.\\"Diocese of Vittorio Veneto\\" Catholic-Hierarchy.org. David M. Cheney. Retrieved February 29, 2016\\"Diocese of Vittorio Veneto\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 Ceneda began as a suffragan of the patriarchate of Aquileia until the latter's suppression in 1751. From 1752 until 1818 Ceneda was a suffragan of the archdiocese of Udine. Since 1818 Ceneda has been in the ecclesiastical province headed by the Patriarchate of Venice. Art from several churches in the diocese is housed in its diocesan museum. History The city of Vittorio Veneto includes the town of Ceneda which in ancient times was a castrum known as Ceneta and poetically as Acedum. The city is situated in the province of Treviso, just north of Conegliano. It was pillaged by Attila the Hun in 452, and a century later by Totila. After 568, during the domination of the Lombards, it was governed by a duke and then a count. Still later it became part of the marquisate of Treviso. The Gospel is said to have been preached in the region in the first century by St. Fortunatus, deacon of bishop St. Hermagoras of Aquileia. Attesting to the presence of Christianity is one of the earliest pieve of the diocese, Sant'Andrea di Bigonzo, which dates from the fourth century. However, the historical beginning of episcopal see of Ceneda is uncertain. There may have been a bishop present in Ceneda very soon after the Lombard conquest. The first reputed bishop seems to have been Vindemius who was present in 579 at the Synod of Grado which continued the Schism of the Three Chapters. In 680, it seems that a bishop Ursinus was present at the Council of Rome convened against the Monothelites. However, the diocese does not seem to have been officially organized until 685 when the Lombard duke Grumoaldo assigned to the bishop of Ceneda a large part of the territory that had formerly been under the care of Oderzo to counter the claims of Oderzo's bishop in exile. Oderzo had, in fact, been destroyed by the Lombards in 667 and its Oderzo sought refuge with the Byzantines in the Venetian lagoon. Significantly, the patron saint of the diocese is actually a bishop of Oderzo, Titianus, whose body is said to have miraculously been carried up the Livenza River against the current and to have come to rest at the site of the present cathedral after being carried in a cart by a donkey. From 994 the bishop of that city became also its temporal lord, even after it was politically incorporated into the Republic of Venice in 1389. In 1447 and in 1514 bishops Francesco and Oliviero gave the republic civil investiture of the territory of Ceneda, reserving for themselves and their successors (until about 1768) authority over the city and a few villas. Among its bishops have been: Azzo (1140); Sigifredo (1170), during whose time there were many conflicts between Ceneda and the neighbouring towns; Antonion Correr (1409); Lorenzo da Ponte (1739), the last bishop to exercise temporal power, and Albino Luciani (1958‚Äì1969) who became pope John Paul I in 1978. Shrines Within the confines of the diocese is the Basilica of Motta di Livenza, built near the spot where Giovanni Cigana reported the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to him on March 9, 1510 during his praying of the rosary. She asked him and the inhabitants of the area to fast as an act of repentance for sin for at least three consecutive Saturdays, pray to God for mercy, and to build a basilica on the site so that people could come for prayer. The Marian apparition was subsequently investigated and proclaimed worthy of belief by pope Julius II.

The station, founded in 1964, is currently owned by Dot Com Plus, LLC. WNSP and sister station WZEW broadcast from the former Smith Bakery building in Mobile, Alabama. WNSP's transmitter is near Bay Minette. Programming Since September 11, 1993, WNSP has broadcast a sports talk format to the greater Mobile metropolitan area. In addition to its daily lineup of local programs covering the Southeastern Conference, golf, hunting, fishing, NASCAR, and other regional sports, the station features select programming from ESPN Radio. WNSP is the flagship station of the University of South Alabama men's basketball radio network. The station is the Mobile affiliate of the New Orleans Saints radio network and both the Auburn Tigers football and Auburn Tigers basketball radio networks. Beginning with the 2009 college football season, WNSP became the affiliate for the University of South Alabama Jaguars football program. On February 16, 2009, the station began airing the regionally syndicated The Paul Finebaum Radio Network on weekday afternoons, replacing a locally-hosted program. The station cited budgetary reasons for the change in lineup. History This station began regular broadcast operations on October 1, 1964, as WBCA-FM. Broadcasting with 3,000 watts of effective radiated power, the Faulkner Radio, Inc.-owned station was the FM sister station to WBCA (1110 AM). As with the AM station, the WBCA callsign was said to stand for \\"Wonderful Baldwin County Alabama\\". James H. Faulkner, owner of Faulkner Radio, also owned The Baldwin Times newspaper and had served as the mayor of Bay Minnette from 1941 to 1943. In 1967, the station raised its antenna to 104 meters (340 feet), lowered its effective radiated power to 2,300 watts, and changed its call letters to WWSM. Programmed separately from its country music formatted AM sister station since its launch in 1964, WWSM played a soul music format for most of the 1970s. However, by 1979, the station had adopted a Top 40 format and was simulcasting as much as 60% of the AM station's programming. In August 1985, the Faulkner family agreed to transfer control of licensee Faulkner Radio Inc. to Faulkner University. The deal was approved by the FCC on October 3, 1985, and the transaction was consummated on January 10, 1986. In March 1986, Faulkner Radio Inc. agreed to formally transfer the broadcast license for WWSM to Faulkner University. This transfer was approved by the FCC on April 2, 1986, and the transaction was consummated on August 4, 1986. In March 1987, Faulkner University reached an agreement to transfer the WWSM license to a new company called Faulkner-Phillips Media Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 15, 1987, and the transaction was consummated on May 22, 1987. In 1987, the station acquired the intellectual property from Mobile's 96.1 FM. Consequently, the station's call sign was changed to WLPR and the format was changed to beautiful music. The station was assigned the WMMV call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on September 1, 1989. The station was assigned new call letters WYMZ on March 9, 1992, but this was a short-term change as the station made another application to the FCC and was granted WNWT on October 12, 1992. These too would prove short-lived as the station was assigned the current WNSP callsign less than a year later on August 31, 1993. The new callsign was chosen to accompany a new sports talk format which launched on September 11, 1993. WNSP claims to be the first sports talk station in the United States to operate on the FM band. Operation of the station was taken over by Capitol Broadcasting in 1995 as part of a local marketing agreement. Capitol Broadcasting was bought out and absorbed by Clear Channel Communications in mid-1997. With Clear Channel unwilling to continue the LMA, WNSP's owners reached an agreement in May 1998 to sell this station to Dot Com Plus, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on July 6, 1998, and the transaction was consummated on July 9, 1998.

Since September 2009, the station has been owned by Fairhope-based Archangel Communications, Inc. Programming WNGL broadcasts a Catholic radio format to the Mobile metropolitan area. The station primarily airs programming from EWTN Global Catholic Radio and also broadcasts a local Live Hour program weekdays at 7AM, along with McGill-Toolen High School Football games. History The beginning The oldest radio station in Mobile, WODX first broadcast from the Battle House Hotel in downtown Mobile on February 7, 1930. Owned by W.O. Pape's Pape Broadcasting Company, the station changed its call sign to WALA in 1933. The book Alabama's First Broadcast Stations by Harry Butler says the calls WALA once stood for \\"We Are Loyal Alabamians\\". January 1953 saw the launch of co-owned NBC-affiliated television station WALA-TV (channel 10) in Mobile and the start of a new era for the AM radio station. A shift by the Pape family in January 1956 saw WALA transferred to a new company called Pape Television Company. The country era In 1963 the ownership of the radio and television stations was split and the AM station's callsign was changed to WUNI. The callsign was intended to sound out the phrase \\"You and I\\". The re-christened radio station was acquired by a new company called WUNI Inc. on December 3, 1964. It was with this ownership change that WUNI became the first full-time country music radio station in Mobile. The station was sold again, this time to the similarly named Radio Station WUNI Inc. on August 1, 1976. In October 1983, Radio Station WUNI, Inc., agreed to sell the station to country music legend Mel Tillis through his Tillis Communications, Inc. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 2, 1983. Tillis had the Federal Communications Commission assign new call letters WMML on January 3, 1984. As with sister station KMML in Amarillo, Texas, the new callsign stood for \\"M-M-Mel Tillis\\" as a play on Mel's famous stutter. WMML continued to air the country music format it had adopted back in 1964. R&B; and religion Tillis exited the radio business in 1985 and WMML was sold to Bridgeway Communications, Inc., owned by St. Louis Media Hall of Fame inductee Doug Eason. Bridgeway changed the format to urban-oriented rap music which did well in the ratings but proved a tough sell to area advertisers. In December 1989, station owner Bridgeway Communications, Inc., faced financial difficulties and the license for this station was involuntarily transferred to Bridgeway Communications, Inc., Debtor-In- Possession. The transfer was approved by the FCC on December 11, 1989. In January 1990, Bridgeway Communications, Inc., Debtor-In-Possession gained approval to sell this station to Lonnie M. Tillis. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 2, 1990, and the transaction was consummated on May 30, 1990. In March 1991, Lonnie M. Tillis made a deal to sell WMML to Albert L. Crain. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 26, 1991, and the transaction was consummated on June 17, 1991. The new owner had the FCC change the station's legal callsign to WLVV on June 28, 1991. The station aired religious programming branded as \\"Love Radio\\". On February 19, 1997, station owner Albert L. Crain died and on April 21, 1997, Joy Crain Johns applied to the FCC to have the license legally transferred to the Estate of Albert L. Crain. The transfer was approved by the FCC on May 5, 1997, and the transaction was completed on May 9, 1997. In February 1999, the Estate of Albert L. Crain reached an agreement to sell this station to WLVV, Inc., based in Baytown, Texas, for a reported sale price of $263,750. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 14, 1999, and the transaction was consummated on June 23, 1999. The station switched to a black Gospel music format branded as Victory 1410 under the slogan \\"The Voice of Victory\\". The station's transmitter site and broadcast tower were severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina and has been operating under a series of special temporary authorities since September 2005 while repairs and new construction bring the broadcaster back to regular licensed operation. WNGL today In July 2009, WLVV, Inc., reached an agreement to sell this station to Archangel Communications, Inc., of Fairhope, Alabama.

They generally perform a wide range of roles. All together, the paramilitary has 17,835,000 troops, as of 2018.  People's Armed Police  The Chinese People's Armed Police Force (PAP) is a paramilitary police force primarily responsible for law enforcement and internal security nationwide during peacetime. In time of war, the PAP would be used as light infantry to support the PLA. According to the constitution of the PRC, the PAP is one of three integral elements of the Chinese armed forces, along with the People's Liberation Army (PLA) and the militia and reserve forces. The China's National Defence White Paper published in 2006 claimed that the total strength of the PAP was 1.5 million people.  China Coast Guard   Militia  The role of the Militia and the degree of party and PLA control over it have varied over the years. Now-a-days the Militia numbers some 3 million service men and women. During the 1940s the militia served primarily as a PLA support force. After 1949 the party consolidated control over the country and gradually used the militia to maintain order and help the PLA with defense of the borders and coast. In the mid-1950s Minister of National Defense Peng Dehuai attempted to build a reserve system incorporating the militia. Peng's efforts were thwarted when the party expanded the militia, assigning it duties as a production force and internal security force during the Great Leap Forward. Lin Biao reduced the size of the militia and reemphasized military training in the early 1960s. The militia was fragmented during the early years of the Cultural Revolution, but in the 1970s it was rebuilt and redirected to support the PLA. The Gang of Four attempted to build up the urban militia as an alternative to the PLA, but the urban militia failed to support the Gang of Four in 1976, when Hua Guofeng and moderate military leaders deposed them. The militia's logistical support of the PLA was essential during the Sino- Vietnamese War of 1979. In the 1980s Chinese leaders undertook to improve the militia's military capabilities by reducing its size and its economic tasks. when China was founded, CPC claimed a militia of 5.5 million. In 1987 the militia was controlled by the PLA at the military district level and by people's armed forces departments, which devolved to civilian control at the county and city levels as part of the reduction in force. The militia was a smaller force than previously, consisting of 4.3 million basic or primary‚Äîarmed‚Äîmilitia, and the 6-million-strong general or ordinary militia. The basic militia was made up of men and women aged eighteen to twenty-eight who had served or were expected to serve in the PLA and who received thirty to forty days of military training per year. The basic militia included naval militia, which operated armed fishing trawlers and coastal defense units, as well as specialized detachments, such as air defense, artillery, communications, antichemical, reconnaissance, and engineering units, which served the PLA. The ordinary militia included men aged eighteen to thirty-five who met the criteria for military service; they received some basic military training but generally were unarmed. The ordinary militia had some air defense duties and included the urban militia. Efforts were made to streamline militia organization and upgrade militia weaponry. By 1986 militia training bases had been established in over half the counties and cities in the nation. The militia's principal tasks in the 1980s were to assist in production, to undergo military training, and to defend China's frontiers in peacetime. In wartime, the militia would supply reserves for mobilization, provide logistical support to the PLA, and conduct guerrilla operations behind enemy lines.  People's Liberation Army Reserve Service  The 1984 Military Service Law stipulated the combination of the militia and the reserve service system. Military training for senior middle-school and college and university students commenced in 1984 as China sought to provide additional qualified reserve service officers. The reserve force consisted primarily of the militia and was organized into reserve-service divisions and regiments. In 1987 China began to make reference to the National Defense Reserve Force, which apparently consisted of reserve soldiers (including all militia, demobilized soldiers, and specialized technical personnel registered for reserve service) and reserve officers (including demobilized officers and soldiers assigned to reserve officer service, college and university graduates, and civilian officials and specialized technicians). The Reserve, as of 2016, is made up of 510,000 reserve personnel of all ranks.  Production and Construction Corps  Before the Cultural Revolution, the Production and Construction Corps was a paramilitary organization of 3 to 4 million people under joint government, party, and PLA control. The Production and Construction Corps was used in remote and unproductive areas to build roads, reclaim land, construct defense and water works, and operate mines, state farms, and industrial plants. A secondary role was border defense, and some units were armed with light infantry weapons. All received basic military training. Unlike the militia, Production and Construction Corps personnel were full-time and uniformed. The PLA took over the Production and Construction Corps during the Cultural Revolution, then civilianized it in the 1970s. In the 1980s the corps appeared to have been abolished except in Xinjiang. There it operated under regional party and government organizations, the Xinjiang Military District, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry, and Fishery.

Early life and education Clarke was born at 121 Elgin Crescent, Kensington, London, England to Henry Clarke, a lecturer and tutor, and his wife Amy (n√©e Key, also known as Mrs. Henry Clarke), a writer and first headmistress of Truro High School. She was educated at St Paul's Girls' School and at The Cheltenham Ladies' College where she was a student at St Hilda‚Äôs House from 1905 to 1906 ‚Äì the senior house of the college. Clarke and Florence Cunningham In 1917 Clarke stayed for seven weeks with Florence Cunningham (1871‚Äì1950, granddaughter of writer Peter Cunningham) at her home in Bayswater. Florence was a mystic who believed herself to be a prophet whom the voices she heard addressed as \\"Mary\\": She compared herself to Abraham, Isaiah and The Messiah, but it should be said that she was later, for a short period, committed to the care of the Holloway Sanatorium in Virginia Water, Surrey. Florence's daughter was Edith Cunningham, then 18, whom Amy had met at St Paul's Girls' School. Edith was attracted to Amy because of her \\"poetic nature\\", and it was for this reason that Edith introduced her to her mother, thinking that Amy would be interested in her newly received enlightenment. Clarke was enamoured of the spirituality in the poems of Florence, and wrote to Florence from Newnham College saying that she was inspired and wanted to come and stay with her. This announcement was a surprise, but Cunningham did not refuse her because she was a friend of her daughter. Clarke stayed for 7 weeks, and during that time she would speak to Cunningham while in a state of inspiration for one or two hours at a time, only in the presence of her husband and daughter. Clarke related that miracles happened which were also witnessed by her family during her sojourn in order to try to demonstrate that she was under the control of higher powers. Clarke left as suddenly as she came, in an agreeable way: She wrote to Florence on Christmas Eve, 1917, addressing her as \\"My dear Mother.\\"Cunningham, Florence, A Prophet's Overture in Three Parts / Part 1, Unpublished typescript, 1945 Career That year, Clarke wrote a mystical poem \\"Vision of Him\\" which the same year was published in the Oxford Book of English Mystical Verse. After reading classics at Newnham College she returned in 1924 to teach as senior classical mistress, becoming successively head of classics, head of upper college, and director of university entrants. She was away from 1939 to 1947, and she returned as house mistress of Cheltenham's St. Hilda‚Äôs House until 1948. In 1950 she wrote on mystical religious philosophy, The Universal Character of Christianity. She finally retired from school administrative work in 1953.Archivist, The Cheltenham Ladies' College Clarke published a scholarly edition of a commentary on Claudian's De Raptu Proserpine by Geoffrey of Vitry, and wrote two histories of the Cheltenham Ladies' College and a history of Truro High School for Girls.

The station's broadcast license is currently held by Donald H. Pugh, Sr., through licensee Eternity Media Group, LLC. WERM broadcasts an Urban Gospel music format to the greater Mobile metropolitan area, including Mobile County and Baldwin County, Alabama. This station formerly broadcast a tradio show called The Gulf Coast Swap Shop, local news, and select programming from the CBS Radio Network. History This station began regular operations as WABF on August 12, 1961. Licensed to Eastern Shore Broadcasters, Inc., the station was originally part of the J. Dige Bishop Stations Group. It broadcast with 1,000 watts of power, daytime-only, to protect WGAR (now WHKW) in Cleveland, Ohio, from skywave interference. Almost two decades later, Eastern Shore Broadcasters, Inc., sold WABF to Bee Cee Broadcasting, Inc., in a deal that closed on July 1, 1978. In March 1992, Bee Cee Broadcasting, Inc., reached a deal to sell WABF to Jubilee Broadcasting Company, Inc., for $350,000. The deal was approved by the FCC on April 20, 1992, and consummated on May 11, 1992. In February 1999, Jubilee Broadcasting Company, Inc., contracted to transfer the broadcast license for WABF to Gulf Coast Broadcasting Company, Inc. The deal gained FCC approval on May 5, 1999, and the transaction was formally consummated on May 20, 1999. In June 2001, the station applied to increase its nighttime signal strength from 4 to 30 watts while eliminating the directional array in use both day and night to reduce skywave interference. The FCC granted a construction permit for these changes on October 1, 2001, with a scheduled expiration date of October 1, 2004. With construction and testing complete in January 2002, the station applied for a new broadcast license to cover these changes. The FCC granted the new license on March 11, 2002. Effective August 10, 2016, Gulf Coast sold WABF to Donald H. Pugh, Sr.'s Eternity Media Group, LLC for $105,000. The station was granted a Special Temporary Authority in April 2016 to operate daytime only with 1 kW from one of the WERM towers in Mobile, and it began using that facility as of September 2016. The tower at the WABF studios on Section Street in Fairhope was later taken down. Although the new ownership moved the studios and transmitter, the format remained more or less the same, with a mix of softer oldies and standards. Within a month of beginning operation from the STA site at the WERM tower in Mobile, coverage issues in Fairhope became apparent and the station moved the temporary broadcast back to Fairhope, first from a location near their new studio in downtown and later from a longwire off Twin Beech Road, just a half mile from the old transmitter site. In early February 2017, the format and programming moved to WERM 1480 in Mobile, while that station's gospel programming moved to this frequency. This change was reported to be permanent. On December 6, 2017, the stations swapped call signs, with this station assuming the WERM calls.

History The WLIQ era This station first signed on the air on January 25, 1961, as WLIQ, a 5,000-watt AM station owned by E. W. Jemison and Frank Conwell, a partnership doing business as Jemcon Broadcasting Company. The new station aired an easy listening format. On April 1, 1964, Jemcon Broadcasting Company, Inc., sold WLIQ to Hartzog Broadcasting, Inc., and the broadcast studios were moved to the historic Sheraton Battle House Hotel. The new owners transitioned the station's playlist to a middle of the road music format. On July 26, 1971, WLIQ was acquired from Hartzog Broadcasting, Inc., by Southland of Alabama, Inc., and moved to new studios. During the 1970s, the station broadcast first a top 40 format then later a country music format. As WPCY After nearly 20 years as WLIQ, the station applied and was assigned the call letters WPCY by the Federal Communications Commission on June 30, 1980. A new format accompanied the new callsign as WPCY flipped to talk radio. In February 1981, Southland of Alabama, Inc., agreed to sell this station to WPCY Broadcasting Company, Inc.

She was portrayed in the film by Chlo√´ Sevigny, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance. The director of the film, Kimberly Peirce, worked on the script for many years and interviewed Lana and her mother for details on their life. Peirce also drew information from other sources including All She Wanted by Aphrodite Jones (1996), a biography of Brandon Teena and the lives of those involved with the murders; and a 1994 Village Voice piece written by Donna Minkowitz which was responsible for the story becoming a media sensation in the early 1990s. Background In the fall of 1993, Tisdel, aged 18, met Brandon Teena, 20, through their mutual friends. Teena was new to the close-knit area, from Lincoln, Nebraska, and the local crowd was curious about him. Teena and Tisdel began seeing each other, because Tisdel found Teena attractive and believed Brandon was a cisgender man. He was in fact a transgender man: assigned female at birth, but identifying as male. Tisdel has made it clear that her relationship with Brandon Teena was brief and did not include sex; only lasting about two months from their first meeting until the murder. However, their two-month relationship is described as very intense. Her mother Linda testified that Tisdel would be with Brandon all day, had trouble sleeping, and their relationship was all she cared about during that time.http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-01-17/features/9401170002_1_john- lotter-falls-city-lincoln/3 accessed 2/17/2015 On December 19, 1993, Brandon Teena was arrested for forging checks, and put in jail for several days. Tisdel found out he was transgender after his birth name was printed in the local newspaper in the arrests section. Tisdel paid to get him out of jail, and he told her that he was undergoing sex reassignment surgery. Tisdel has disputed claims that after the truth was revealed to her, they continued a romantic relationship, but instead she told Brandon that they could still be friends. Tisdel defended Teena often, at one point lying to authorities and telling them she had seen him naked and saw his penis, in hopes they would leave him alone. Two people that they were friends with during this time were John Lotter and Tom Nissen. Both young men had criminal records, and Teena had been staying with Nissen. Falls City is a small town, and all of these families were well-acquainted; Lana's best friend was Michelle Lotter, John's sister. Initially friendly, Lotter and Nissen soon began to harass Teena and Tisdel and scrutinize their relationship. During a Christmas Eve party, Lotter and Nissen forced Teena to take off his clothes in order to show everyone, including Lana, his genitals. The two then kidnapped Teena and took him to a rural area, where they raped and beat him. Afterwards, Teena came to Tisdel's house, and Tisdel and her mother convinced him to speak to the police and go to the hospital. Lotter and Nissen had told Teena that if he told anyone what they did, they would kill him. Murders A few days later, on New Year's Eve 1993, Lotter and Nissen came to the Tisdel residence drunk and looking for Teena, and threatened the Tisdel sisters. They then drove to the house of Lisa Lambert, where Teena had been hiding out. Also in the house was Phillip Devine, a friend of theirs who was dating Tisdel's sister Leslie. Lisa Lambert was a single mother from Pawnee City, Nebraska, who often let friends stay with her in exchange for their help and company, because she lived outside of town. Lotter and Nissen then shot Teena, Lambert, and Devine to death. Lambert's son Tanner was in the house at the time and was unharmed. Tisdel was not present at the time of the murder, as it took place inside Lambert's home in Humboldt, Nebraska, a 30-minute drive away from Falls City, where Tisdel lived with her mother and sister. The bodies were discovered the next day by Lambert's mother, Anna Mae.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ne-supreme- court/1234773.html accessed 2/17/2015 Aftermath Tisdel, her sister Leslie, and mother Linda were all involved in the criminal trial and later lawsuits that followed the murder and later, movie development. Lana also has other siblings, including a brother, Terry Torrance.Brandon Teena murder trial court record accessed 3/23/2015 The Tisdel family appeared on Maury and A Current Affair, to discuss Brandon Teena and the trial proceedings. The Tisdel family did not get along well with Brandon Teena's mother, Jo Ann Brandon, and his sister, Tammy, who accused Tisdel of being responsible for the murders. Tisdel sued the creators of Boys Don't Cry for using her name and likeness without permission, and the suit was settled out of court. Leslie Tisdel was vocal about the film's script changes, and upset that her boyfriend who was murdered, Phillip Devine, was not included in the film, nor was she, and instead the film focused on Brandon Teena. There has been scrutiny that the lack of information on Phillip Devine (1974‚Äì1993), who was from Iowa, is because he was African American, and Leslie stated she believed he has been left out of the story because of racism. When Boys Don't Cry was released, she petitioned Nebraska movie theatre owners to not show the film. Lisa Lambert's (1969‚Äì1993) name was changed to Candace in the movie.

This epic family drama was based on Maria DƒÖbrowska's novel Noce i dnie, and was described by The Washington Post as \\"Poland's Gone With the Wind\\". Set in Kalisz and the Kalisz Region in the second half of the 19th century after the failure of the January Uprising in 1863, the film presents a unique portrait of an oppressed society, life in exile, and the confiscation of private property as told through the loves and struggles of the Niechcic family.http://turnerclassic.moviesunlimited.com/Product.asp?sku=D42781 This sweeping historical epic was the highest-grossing film in Poland's history upon its release and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1977.http://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Nights-and- Days/60010715?trkid=5966279 The film score was composed by Waldemar Kazanecki, which includes a Viennese waltz that is frequently played at Polish weddings as the first dance of bride and groom. Amid the turbulence of World War I, elderly Barbara Niechcic (Jadwiga Bara≈Ñska) recalls her dramatic life with husband Bogumi≈Ç (Jerzy Bi≈Ñczycki) over a half-century of Polish history, starting with the failed January Uprising in 1863. Barbara, running away from burning city of Kalisz is reminiscing her unfulfilled love, her marriage to a man she does not initially love, death of her first child, birth of three others, confiscation of her family property, abandoning her husband, his illness, death and other numerous family struggles. Plot Nights and Days is a family saga of Barbara Ostrze≈Ñska-Niechcic, (played by Jadwiga Bara≈Ñska) and Bogumi≈Ç Niechcic, (played by Jerzy Bi≈Ñczycki) against the backdrop of the January Uprising of 1863 and World War I. The film is a rather straightforward and faithful adaptation of a novel by Maria DƒÖbrowska with the same title. The plot is woven around the changing fortunes of a noble (upper-class) Niechcic family in the pre-WWI Poland. There are two main crossing threads: a social history one and an existential one. The cinematographic version is a condensation of the 12 part award winning TV serial of the same title and using the same cast and producers.http://www.filmpolski.pl/fp/index.php/124203 Part One: Bogumi≈Ç and Barbara Barbara Ostrze≈Ñska marries former landowner Bogumi≈Ç Niechcic out of respect for his heroic past contributions to the 1863 January Uprising rather than love for him as she is secretly in love with the handsome Mr. Toliboski. Their task of forging a new life together begins at a small estate, Krempa. Part Two: Peter and Teresa Barbara suffers the loss of her first child, a four-year-old boy named Peter, and decides to leave her home at Krempa to start a new life at the run down land property of Serbinow. Barbara's beloved sister Teresa dies. Part Three: Grandma Bogumi≈Ç is successful as the manager of the estate at Serbinow. Financial security, the birth of their three children (named: Agnieszka, Emilka and Tomaszek) signal better times at last. Barbara's sick mother moves in with them only to die. Part Four: Eternal Worries Bogumi≈Ç's dedication to his work is praised by the landowner of 'Serbinow', but Barbara has trouble with Tommy (Tomaszek, their youngest child), who is lying and stealing. They employ a governess for their three children. Barbara and Bogumi≈Ç become more distant with each other as Barbara dreams of moving to the nearby city of Kaliniec. Part Five: Good Luck Barbara's uncle dies, bequeathing her 6,000 rubles. Bogumi≈Ç advises her to invest in Serbinow, but her preference is a building property in Kaliniec. Meanwhile, Danielecki, owner of Serbinow, arrives and anxious not to lose Bogumi≈Ç improves his contract. Part Six: Love Mrs Hlasko, an experienced teacher arrives, so Barbara has no need to move to the town of Kaliniec with her children. There is an outbreak of typhoid and the family do what they can to help the sick. Eventually Barbara moves to Kaliniec with her children. Bogumi≈Ç stays home alone at Serbinow and finds himself a young lover. Part Seven: Wind in the Eyes Fifteen years have passed since Bogumi≈Ç and Barbara settled in Serbinow. During a celebration party, two gold coins go missing and their son Tommy (Tomaszek) is suspected. Meanwhile the 1905 Russian Revolution encourages farmhands to riot. When Barbara unexpectedly leaves her home in Kaliniec to visit Serbinow she finds Bogumi≈Ç in the arms of another woman. Barbara is devastated. Part Eight: Time for Love/Time for Death The revolutionary movement expands, involving Barbara's daughter, Agnieszka, who returns from the university full of life and eager to love. In the meantime their old governess, Ms. Celina, commits suicide when her lover abandons her. Part Nine: Fathers and Children Bogumi≈Ç realizes that he is losing his daughter, Agnieszka, who decides to live with her husband in Brussels rather than staying at Serbinow with her family. Tommy continues to lie and steal, causing his parents much pain and suffering. Part Ten: We are born, we die and life goes on Despite worries about the children, Barbara and Bogumi≈Ç feel secure and content. Bogumi≈Ç orders drainage equipment for Serbinow without the owners' permission, using Barbara's money as a deposit. Soon news arrives from Paris that Serbinow has been sold. Bogumi≈Ç and Barbara must move out and leave their home at Serbinow. Part Eleven: At the end of the day After more than twenty years at Serbinow, Bogumi≈Ç and Barbara buy a small estate at Pamietow. Bogumi≈Ç feels lost and tired. He becomes sick and dies asking his children to be honest and kind. Without Bogumi≈Ç Barbara feels as if her world is completely destroyed. Meanwhile, Poland's struggle for independence continues. Part Twelve: And then comes the night Barbara moves permanently to Kalinec. As World War I breaks out and the Germans invade, Barbara hopes her children will come to her. When the Prussian army captures Kalinec, the people are glad to be free of the Russians. Barbara leaves Kaliniec in search of her children.

At the 26th Berlin International Film Festival in 1976, Jadwiga Bara≈Ñska won the Silver Bear for Best Actress. Possible reasons for popularity The original novel by Maria DƒÖbrowska is quite long and verbose: four or six volumes, depending on the edition. Due to the social history thread it was included as a mandatory reading material in Polish high schools. This film could be considered a Cliff Notes version of the novel and many cinema-goers were high-schoolers looking for a shortcut through their mandatory reading list. Additionally the social history angle was explored in a non-confrontational and non-judgemental way. This allowed the whole material to get through the communist censorship without any cuts or other interventions. In effect the communist government-run film monopoly paid for producing a faithful saga of an upper-class family (nobility). The cinematographic version is arguably less popular (although still well known) than the 12-episode TV version, which is still being periodically re-broadcast in Poland. Its high technical and artistic values allow it to successfully compete for viewers against contemporary soap operas.

In November 1958, WMGY was acquired by Radio Montgomery, Inc., as part of the C. A. McClure Stations Group. In the late 1970s, the station's license was transferred to George H. Buck, Jr., and the longtime country and western music format was replaced with Southern Gospel and religious radio programming. The station has maintained this format for more than 30 years and calls itself \\"the oldest Christian music station in Montgomery\\". In March 1982, owner George H. Buck, Jr., reached an agreement to transfer the license for this station to WMGY Radio, Inc. The deal was approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on April 23, 1982. Terry L. Barber purchased WMGY in a transaction that was consummated on April 30, 2015, at a purchase price of $60,000. In addition to its local broadcasts, WMGY began streaming its programming over the internet in 2007. As of August 2016, this station is now being heard on W257DS 99.3 FM, in Montgomery. WMGY also features a live and local gospel program, Gospel Saturday Morning, which airs 6-9 a.m. each Saturday playing, along with the top names in gospel music, many local Montgomery area and Alabama based gospel artists as well as interviews with local and national gospel performers. Hosted by local Montgomery native Mark Fowler, Gospel Saturday Morning launched in April 2016. Former on-air staff Sammy Stephens, who was given his first job at WMGY by Rad Dodson, became a celebrity for his \\"It's just like a mini-mall\\" rap advertisements for Flea Market Montgomery. Stephens got his start in broadcasting as the \\"Candyman,\\" his on-air persona for WMGY and WXVI radio stations.

History Concordia is an ancient Venetian city, called by the Romans Colonia Julia Concordia Sagittaria, and is situated on the Lemene River, between the Rivers Tagliamento and Livenza, two miles south of Portogruaro, not far from the Adriatic. Today there remain of the city only ruins and the ancient cathedral. The eighty-nine martyrs of Concordia, who were put to death under Diocletian, are held in veneration; their cult is recent, however, and based on late and dubious material.Lanzoni, p. 897: \\"Gli abitanti della nostra Concordia pretendono che i martiri del 17-18 febbraio siano stati uccisi nella loro citt√† ¬´ sub Maximiano et Diocletiano ¬ª; ma non posseggono documenti o monumenti antichi del loro culto e del loro sepolcro, e la Passione {BHL, 2303), che ne hanno composito, √® di et√† recentissima e perci√≤ stesso di assai dubbia fede.\\" The monk, author, and controversialist, Tyrannius Rufinus (345‚Äì411), was born in Concordia, but was baptized in Aquileia, where he became a monk.Lanzoni, p. 899. During the fifth century the city was destroyed by Attila. The first known bishop of Concordia is Clarissimus, who, at a provincial synod of Aquileia in 579, helped to prolong the Schism of the Three Chapters; this council was attended by Augustinus, later Bishop of Concordia, who in 590 signed the petition presented by the schismatics to Emperor Mauricius. Bishop Johannes transferred the episcopal residence to Caorle (606), retaining, however, the title of Concordia.Kehr, p. 72. Lanzoni, p. 901, puts the date c. 615‚Äì618. On 12 February 928, Hugh of Arles, King of Italy, granted to the Patriarch of Aquileia the right to invest the bishops of Concordia.Schwartz, p. 50. Luca Gianni (2003), \\"La diocesi di Concordia in Friuli. Difesa delle temporalit√† e consolidamento amministrativo: l'episcopato di Artico di Castello (1317-1331),\\" in: G. G. Merlo (ed.), Vescovi Medievali, Milano, Edizioni Biblioteca Francescana, 2003, p. 1 (p. 165): \\"Il suo vescovo dipendeva dal punto di vista metropolitico ma soprattutto feudale, dal patriarca di Aquileia, che lo investiva del potere temporale, sia civile quanto criminale, su parte del territorio diocesano.\\" The medieval bishops seem to have resided near the ancient cathedral, and to have wielded temporal power, which, however, they were unable to retain.Luca Gianni (2004), \\"Vita ed organizzazione interna della diocesi di Concordia in epoca medievale,\\" in: A. Scott√† (ed.), Diocesi di Concordia, Padova: Gregoriana Libreria Editrice, 2004 (Storia religiosa del Veneto, 10), pp. 205-321. The bishops of Concordia held one of the twenty-four canonicates in the cathedral Chapter of Aquileia; their functions were carried out by an appointed vicar.Zambaldi, p. 97. In 1586, during the episcopate of the elder Matteo Sanudo, the episcopal residence was transferred to Portogruaro. In 1974 the episcopal residence was definitively transferred to Pordenone. Canons and cathedral The cathedral was staffed and administered by a corporation of Canons. In 1191, Bishop Romulus decreed the reduction in number of the Canons from twenty-two to sixteen. The change was sanctioned by the Patriarch of Aquileia on 14 December 1191. He also renewed the obligation of the Canons to reside together.Cappelletti X, p. 427. Bishop Articus da Castello (1318‚Äì1331) attempted, without success, to reform the cathedral Chapter, by appointing Canons who would agree to live in Concordia, where there was a dormitorium canonice and a claustrum. The problem was made difficult because both the Provost and the Dean were non- residential.Gianni (2003), pp. 72-74 (pp. 8-10). In order to ensure that the regular liturgical services were held in the cathedral at Concordia, on 3 April 1339 Bishop Guido de Guisis (1334‚Äì1347) established three mansionarii to assume the duties that the Canons would not perform.Gianni (2003), p. 75 (p. 11). Returning from the Council of Trent, Bishop Pietro Querini (1537‚Äì1584) began a counter-reformational program with a general visitation of the institutions of his diocese (1566), during which he indicated to the cathedral Chapter that they should put their own discipline in order, and that they should address the equitable distribution of prebends. The result was a capitulary act of 15 January 1567, declaring that the Chapter had three dignitaries (the Dean, the Provost, and the Archdeacon), and assigning specific prebends to six Canons who were priests, two to deacons, and one to a subdeacon.Cappelletti X, pp. 455-456.

In 2020, the cathedral had a Chapter composed of three dignities (the Dean, the Theologus and the Penitentiarius) and three Canons, with four honorary Canons.Diocesi di Concordia-Podernone, \\"Capitolo della Cattedrale\\"; retrieved: 17 September 2020. Diocesan synods A diocesan synod was an irregularly held, but important, meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.

It starred Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω in the title role. Work on the picture began in 1965, but production was halted in summer 1966. Becker, who had originally planned Jacob the Liar as a screenplay, decided to make it a novel instead. In 1972, after the book garnered considerable success, work on the picture resumed. Plot In a Jewish ghetto in German-occupied Poland, a man named Jakob is caught on the streets after curfew. He is told to report to a German military office where he finds the officer in charge passed out drunk. The radio is running and Jakob hears a broadcast about the advances of the Soviet Army. Eventually, Jakob sneaks out and goes home. Later he tells his friends that the Russians are not very far away. As no one believes he went to the Nazi office and came out alive, Jakob makes up a lie, claiming he owns a radio - a crime punishable by death. This puts Jakob in a difficult position since he is constantly asked for further news. He then starts encouraging his friends with false reports about the advance of the Red Army towards their ghetto. The residents, who are desperate and starved, find new hope in Jakob's stories. Even when he eventually confesses to his friend that only the first report was true and all the rest is made up, his friend points out that his stories give people hope and a will a to live. The film ends with the deportation of Jakob and the others to the extermination camps. Cast * Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω - Jakob Heym (voiced by Norbert Christian) * Erwin Geschonneck - Kowalski * Henry H√ºbchen - Mischa * Blanche Kommerell - Rosa Frankfurter * Manuela Simon - Lina * Armin Mueller-Stahl - Roman Schtamm * Peter Sturm - Leonard Schmidt * Dezs≈ë Garas - Mr. Frankfurter (voiced by Wolfgang Dehler) * Margit Bara - Josefa Litwin (voiced by Gerda-Luise Thiele) * - - Herschel Schtamm * Zsuzsa Gordon - Mrs. Frankfurter (voiced by Ruth Kommerell) * Friedrich Richter - Dr. Kirschbaum * - Duty officer * - Josef Neidorf * - Schwoch Production First attempt While still attending university, Jurek Becker heard from his father a story about a man from the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto who owned a radio and passed news from the outside world, risking execution by the Germans. As Becker became a screenwriter in the early 1960s, he decided to compose a film script based on the story. On 10 January 1963, he submitted a 32 pages long treatment to the DEFA studio, the state-owned cinema monopoly of the German Democratic Republic. The studio approved of the work and authorized to further develop it.M√ºller. p. 81. Becker was paid 2,000 East German Mark.M√ºller. p. 75. On 17 February 1965, he handed a 111 pages long scenario over to the studio, and a full script of 185 pages was submitted by him on 15 December. During 1965, as work on the script progressed, Frank Beyer requested to direct the future film and received the role. On 9 February 1966, the director-general of DEFA, Franz Bruk, submitted the script to the chairman of the Ministry Of Culture's Film Department, Wilfried Maa√ü, and requested permission to commence production. Maa√ü replied the scenario should be historically accurate: in Becker's work, the Red Army freed the ghetto just before the residents were deported, although Jakob died on the barbed wire fence. The chairman pointed out no Jewish ghettos were rescued in such a manner at the war, as the Germans managed to evacuate them all. However, on 22 February he granted permission to begin work on the picture.M√ºller. p. 82. Beyer decided to cast Czechoslovak actor Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω for the role of Jakob, and DEFA began negotiations with the Barrandov Studios.M√ºller. p. 83. Cancellation The producers soon encountered difficulties. In the end of 1965, from the 16th to the 18th of December, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany assembled for its XI Plenum. During the convention, the cinema industry was severely criticized and blamed for taking artistic liberties incongruous with Marxist ideology. In the following year, some twelve recently produced pictures were banned: the most prominent of those were Kurt Maetzig's The Rabbit Is Me and Beyer's Trace of Stones. The latter had its premiere in summer 1966, but was soon removed from circulation. Consequently, the director was reprimanded by the Studio directorate and blacklisted. He was forbidden to work in cinema, and was relegated to work in theater, and later to Deutscher Fernsehfunk, the East German state television.M√ºller. pp. 84-86. Subsequently, the production of Jacob the Liar ceased on 27 July 1966.Gilman. p. 66. Becker's biographer Beate M√ºller wrote that while the implications of the Plenum played a part in this, \\"it would be misleading to lay all responsibility there\\": neither Becker nor the film were mentioned by the Party, and DEFA might have simply found another director.M√ºller. p. 88. Beyer wrote the film was deemed sound on the political level, adding the censure never tried to interfere with Jacob the Liar.Beyer. p. 187. There were other reasons: Beyer intended to hold principal photography in Poland, mainly in the former Krak√≥w Ghetto, and requested the authorities of the People's Republic of Poland for permission; He also planned to have the Poles help finance the picture. The Polish United Film Production Groups responded negatively.M√ºller. pp. 88-89. Beyer believed the sensitivity of the subject of the Holocaust in Poland stood behind the rejection.Beyer. p. 184. More important, the banning of many of the pictures made in 1965 and the abortion of other future projects that were under way and feared to be non-conformist had run DEFA into a financial crisis. All future revenues were now dependent on the pictures that were not affected by the Plenum, and only a meager budget remained for new undertakings.M√ºller. pp. 89-90. Completion The rejection of the film motivated Becker to turn his screenplay into a novel.M√ºller. pp. 92-94. Jacob the Liar was first published in 1969, and became both a commercial and a critical success, winning several literary prizes, also in West Germany and abroad.Figge, Ward. p. 91. The acclaim it received motivated the West German ZDF television network to approach the author and request the rights to adapt it. Becker, who was now a famous and influential author, went to Beyer instead and suggested they resume work on the unfinished picture from 1966. The director proposed to make it a co-production of DEFA and DFF.M√ºller. p. 122 The picture - which was always positively viewed by the establishment - was never banned, and the studio maintained an interest to film the script throughout the years passed.M√ºller. p. 90. On 16 March 1972, a contract was signed between Becker and the studios. He handed over a 105-page scenario on 22 June 1972, which was approved on 11 August. A final script, with 152 pages, was authorized by DEFA on 7 January 1974.M√ºller. p. 123. The film was financed by both companies, with each paying half of the 2.4 million East German Mark budget, which was rather average for DEFA pictures made in the 1970s.M√ºller. p. 126. Beyer completely rejected filming in Poland this time. He chose to conduct outdoor photography in the Czechoslovak city of Most, the historical center of which was undergoing demolition; he believed the ruins would best serve as the site of the ghetto.Beyer. p. 191. West German actor Heinz R√ºhmann, who was offered to depict Jakob by ZDF while its directors believed they would receive the rights, insisted on portraying him even in the DEFA production. Erich Honecker had personally decided to reject him, in what Katharina Rauschenberger and Ronny Loewy called \\"probably his only productive decision in the field of art... Happily, the film was spared from R√ºhmann\\". Brodsk√Ω was invited again to portray the title role.Loewy, Rauschenberger. pp. 198-199. Jerzy Zelnik was supposed to star as Mischa, but the Polish state- owned film production monopoly Film Polski, which demanded more details about the film from the East Germans, undermined the attempt. Eventually, Henry H√ºbchen received the role. The cast also featured two concentration camp survivors: Erwin Geschonneck and Peter Sturm. Principal photography commenced on 12 February 1974, and ended on 22 May. Editing began on 4 June. The studio accepted the picture in October, requiring only minor changes. The final, edited version was completed on 3 December. The producers remained well within their budget confines, and the total cost of Jacob the Liar was summed to 2,411,600 East German Mark. Reception Distribution Brodsk√Ω, Beyer and others in the premiere of Jacob the Liar Jacob the Liar was never expected to be a commercial success: DEFA officials who held a preliminary audience survey in 1974 estimated on 28 May that no more than 300,000 people would view it. M√ºller believed that for this reason, although its premiere in cinemas was to be held in early 1975, both DEFA and the Ministry of Culture did not object when the DFF directorate requested to broadcast it first on television, claiming they lacked an \\"emotional high point\\" for the 1974 Christmas television schedule. On Sunday, 22 December 1974, a black-and-white version was screened by DFF 1, in one of the leading prime time slots of its annual schedule. It was seen by \\"millions of viewers\\".M√ºller. p. 127. When it was eventually distributed to cinemas in April 1975, its attendance figures were further damaged by the earlier broadcast on television. It was released in only seventeen copies, and sold merely 89,279 tickets within the first thirteen weeks.Berghahn. p. 92. The number rose to only 164,253 after a year, to 171,688 by the end of 1976 and to 232,000 until 1994.M√ºller. p. 129. In spite of this, Jacob the Liar became an international success: it was exported to twenty-five foreign states, a rare achievement for an East German film, especially since only five of those were inside the Eastern Bloc: Hungary, Cuba, Bulgaria, Romania and Czechoslovakia. Most DEFA pictures of the 1970s were allowed in no more than one non-communist state, if any at all, while Beyer's film was bought by distributors in West Germany, Austria, Greece, Italy, the United States, Iran, Japan, Angola, and Israel, among others. In that respect, \\"Jacob the Liar was certainly no flop.\\"M√ºller. pp. 129-130. Awards On 1 October 1975, Becker, Beyer, Brodsk√Ω, actor Erwin Geschonneck, dramatist Gerd Gericke and cinematographer G√ºnter Marczinkowsky received the National Prize of East Germany 2nd class in collective for their work on the picture. The film was turned down by the organizers of the IX Moscow International Film Festival, held in July 1975, due to its subject, which was deemed \\"outdated\\".Liehm. p. 361. Becker's biographer Thomas Jung claimed the reason was \\"the taboo theme of antisemitism in Eastern Europe\\".Jung. p. 128. Jacob the Liar was the first ever East German film that was entered into the Berlin International Film Festival in West Berlin: in the XXV Berlinale, Vlastimil Brodsk√Ω won the Silver Bear for Best Actor. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 49th Academy Awards, the only East German picture ever to be selected.Brockmann. p. 231. Critical response Hans-Christoph Blumenberg of Die Zeit commented: \\"Gently, softly, without cheap pathos and sentimentality, Beyer tells a story about people in the middle of horror... The remarkable quality of this quiet film is achieved not least due to superb acting by the cast.\\" The New York Times reviewer Abraham H. Weiler wrote Jacob the Liar \\"is surprisingly devoid of anything resembling Communist propaganda... Brodsk√Ω is forceful, funny and poignant\\". He added it \\"illustrates Mark Twain's observation that 'courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear, and not the absence of fear'\\". Analysis Martina Thiele noted that Jacob the Liar \\"is one of the few DEFA pictures that may be called 'Holocaust films'\\". While the topic was not infrequent in East German cinema, it was usually portrayed in a manner conforming to the official view of history: the victims were portrayed as completely passive, while the emphasis was laid on the communist struggle against the Nazis. In Beyer's film, a Jew was first seen to offer resistance.Thiele. pp. 100-101. Paul Cooke and Marc Silberman present a similar interpretation: it was \\"the first film to link Jews with the theme of resistance, albeit a peculiarly unheroic type\\". Jakob was still a representation of the stereotypical effeminate Jew, reminding of Professor Mamlock, and although he \\"exhibits a certain degree of agency\\", he still does so out of almost maternal, nurturing instincts.Cooke, Silberman. pp. 141-142. Daniela Berghahn wrote \\"the innovative aspects\\" of the film \\"consist of its new approach... The use of comedy... It pays no tribute to history's victors, only to its victim... By turning the negatives into positives, Beyer conveys a story of hope... And makes the impact of Jakob's lie on ghetto life tangible\\".Berghahn. pp. 90-92.

It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Plot A young female journalist Keiko Mitani (Komaki Kurihara) is researching an article on the history of Japanese women who were sex slaves in Asian brothels during the early 20th century. She locates Osaki (Kinuyo Tanaka), an elderly woman who lives with a number of cats in a shack in a remote village. Osaki agrees to tell her life story, and the film goes into flashback to the early 1920s. A young Osaki (Yoko Takashi) is sold by her poverty-stricken family into indentured servitude as a maid in Sandakan, British North Borneo (today‚Äôs Sabah, Malaysia) at what she believes to be a hotel. At parting, Osaki's distraught and tragic mother gives her a kimono that she has woven by hand over the night before her daughter's departure. The kimono will be Osaki's most treasured possession forever. The establishment is actually a brothel called Sandakan No. 8. Osaki, who is sold as a young girl, works for two years as a maid, but is forced by the brothel‚Äôs owners to become a prostitute. Osaki stays at Sandakan 8 until World War II, and in that period she never experiences genuine affection outside of a brief romance with a poor farmer who abandons her when he comes one evening to the brothel and sees the disheveled and exhausted Osaki after an onslaught of service to a battalion of Japanese sailors recently docked at the town. When Osaki returns to Japan, her brother and his wife, who have bought a house with the money she sent them, tell her that she has become an embarrassment. Osaki returns to Sandakan.

The book focused on the \\"karayuki-san\\", the Japanese term for young women who were forced into sexual slavery (see sex trafficking) in Pacific Rim countries and colonies during the early 20th century. The book created controversy in Japan, where the subject of the karayuki-san was not discussed in public or in scholarly examinations of Japanese history. Yamazaki‚Äôs book was a best-seller and won the Oya Soichi Prize for Non-Fiction Literature; she quickly followed up with a sequel, The Graves of Sandakan.

Eugene Amandus Schwarz (April 21, 1844 - October 15, 1928) was a German-American entomologist who specialized in the study of beetles (Coleoptera). He was a popular and influential employee of the U.S. Department of Agriculture for more than fifty years. Biography Schwarz was born on April 21, 1844 in Liegnitz, Silesia, part of Prussia at that time. His father, Amandus Schwarz, was a cloth merchant and member of the Common Council of Liegnitz. Schwarz studied zoology and entomology at the universities in Breslau and Leipzig and served briefly in the Prussian medical corp during the Franco-Prussian War. Fearing to tell his parents that he had decided upon a career in entomology, Schwarz secretly emigrated to the United States in 1872. Based on a recommendation from Gustav Kraatz, a famous German entomologist, he was hired by Hermann August Hagen to work in the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. He also attended lectures by Hagen and Louis Agassiz. When Aggasiz died in 1873, the museum had financial difficulties and Schwarz chose to quit his position and look elsewhere for work. While at Harvard, Schwarz had met Henry Guernsey Hubbard who was to become a life-long friend and collaborator. In 1874 they traveled to Detroit and stayed for a time to collect beetles in the region and establish the Detroit Scientific Association. In 1875 they made a collecting expedition through Florida. Upon their return, the American Association for the Advancement of Science was meeting in Detroit and Schwarz had the opportunity to meet many of the leading American entomologists including John Lawrence LeConte and Charles Valentine Riley. In the summer of 1877 he and Hubbard traveled through the region of Lake Superior and made a very large collection of beetles, the basis of their publication, The Coleoptera of Michigan (1879). Later, Schwarz joined LeConte on a collecting expedition to the American West. In 1878, he obtained a post with the Department of Agriculture, a function he kept until his death in 1928. He exercised a great influence on many American entomologists. He was a founding member of the Entomological Society of Washington and in 1916 was made an honorary president for life. He was also an active member of the Washington Biologists‚Äô Field Club and the Entomological Society of America. He played a very important role in the organisation of the insect collections of the National Museum of Natural History.  Works  Schwarz published 395 articles during his lifetime, including: *Coleoptera of Florida (1876) (w. LeConte) *Coleoptera of Michigan (1879) (w.

He died in Bristol on 9 March 1991. Early life Meyer was born the son of clergyman Rev Rollo Meyer in Clophill, Bedfordshire. The family moved to Watton-at-Stone, Hertfordshire in January 1911 when Rollo became the rector there,Ampthill and District News, January 1911, url=https://clophillhistory.mooncarrot.org.uk/AmpthillNewsJanuary1911.php and Jack grew up in the village rectory overlooking the new cricket field. The teenage Jack played several cricket games for the village team. In 1923 a young Alan Turing stayed at the Meyer's rectory home for the summer, the Turings being family friends. Jack was educated at Haileybury College, where he stood out as a cricketer. He was a forceful right-handed batsman and a right-arm bowler of medium pace picked out by the Wisden chronicler of public schools cricket of the time, H. S. Altham, for the amount of bowling work he got through, the maintenance of line and length in his varied bowling, and his flair for the \\"big\\" occasion. He was at Pembroke College, Cambridge between 1923 and 1926, gaining a double first in classics,Wisden 1974, p. 133. and then went to India to work as a cotton broker for 10 years. Family Meyer was son of the Reverend Horace Rollo Meyer and Arabella Crosbie Ward. He had a brother, Horace Frost Denys Meyer, and a sister, Constance Evelyn Meyer, married to Bertie Brabazon Ponsonby. Meyer and his wife had two daughters, Jillian Rollo Dawn who later married Albert Paul Prestwich, and Jacqueline Valerie Faye Meyer who married Reginald Nicholas Mander (their son Julian, their granddaughter Margaret, and their great grandson Jack, all later attended Millfield). The educator Millfield Meyer was accompanied on his return to England from India in the mid 1930s by seven Indian boys, including six princes, having been entrusted with providing them an education. He set up Millfield School in Street in Somerset in 1935 and remained as its headmaster for the next 35 years. He was known as The Boss at school. The new school theatre at Millfield is named after him. Millfield from the outset was an unconventional public school, with an emphasis on all-round excellence, and not just the academic, including strength in areas such as sports and the arts. Meyer had a flexible attitude towards school fees, charging wealthy parents some of the highest in the UK but waiving them entirely for some pupils whom he considered deserving. Meyer's philosophy at Millfield was, \\"...to nurture talent by providing the very best facilities, teaching, coaching and opportunities in which young people can exercise and explore their abilities; and to give awards to those in financial need.\\" Links between Millfield and Somerset County Cricket Club remained close; in 1960, Meyer recruited Colin Atkinson, who had played Minor County cricket, on to the Millfield staff. Atkinson played regularly for Somerset from 1960 to 1962, and then was released from school duties to captain the county side from 1965 to 1967. When Meyer retired as headmaster of Millfield in 1971, Atkinson succeeded him. After Millfield Meyer then went to Greece where he took charge of a newly established English-language school, Campion. He remained headmaster for seven years and inspired a number of tales of his eccentricity which were still being recounted two decades later. In 1980 Meyer split with the school and founded another English-language school, St Lawrence College. One 2nd-grade pupil remembers him visiting the classroom in 1986 as akin to a royal visit given his great age and substantive aura that surrounded him. The cricketer At Cambridge, Meyer made an immediate impact in cricket, taking nine wickets in the Freshmen's Match at the start of the summer term in 1924. He took four wickets in the first first-class innings he bowled in and retained his place in the university side for the whole season, winning his Blue.Cricket Archive After the university term was over, he played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire, scoring a lot of runs and taking 51 wickets at low cost. He was picked for the Minor Counties representative side which was accorded a first-class match against the South African touring team and his six wickets for 60 runs in the South Africans' first innings put the Minor Counties on the way to a surprise victory by 25 runs.Cricket Archive He was then called up for the Gentlemen v Players match at Blackpool and responded by taking eight Players' wickets for 38 runs in the first innings,Cricket Archive a feat that did not prevent the Players from winning rather easily in a match that Wisden deemed \\"by no means worthy of its high- sounding title\\". Meyer retained his place in the Cambridge sides of 1925 and 1926, batting fairly low in the order and taking regular wickets. Less than three months after his final University Match appearance in July 1926, he was working as a cotton broker in India and turning out for the Europeans in the final of the Bombay Quadrangular Tournament. Over the following Indian cricket season he played four times in matches against the touring side from the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) led by Arthur Gilligan, including one appearance for the full India side. Boss Meyer's bust at Millfield School Meyer stayed in India for nine years and played first-class cricket in several Indian seasons. In the 1927‚Äì28 season he played only two games, both for the Europeans in the Bombay tournament, but took 28 wickets in these matches, including his career- best nine for 160 in the final against the Hindus when he finished with match figures of 16 wickets for 188 runs. In 1929, in a summer spent in England, he played Minor Counties cricket for Hertfordshire again and in several first- class matches for amateur teams against the universities, and in his last season in India, 1934‚Äì35, he captained the Western India side in two matches in the Ranji Trophy. The second stage of Meyer's cricket career began after his return to England to set up Millfield School in Somerset. From the 1936 season, he appeared in Somerset matches, almost always those in the second half of the season when the school term had ended and, with rare exceptions, those played at home. In these games, he played as an all-rounder, his batting having improved significantly since his Cambridge days. Against Lancashire at Taunton in the last match of the 1936 season, he rescued Somerset from likely defeat with his maiden century, an undefeated 202, scored in 225 minutes. There is no doubt of the innings' merit ‚Äì Somerset were still 48 behind with half their second innings wickets gone ‚Äì but there is an oft-repeated story that the double century was obtained by an offer to contribute to the Lancashire beneficiary's fund.Cricket Archive And he got a second century the following year against Sussex.Cricket Archive As a bowler, he managed at least one five-wicket innings haul in each of the four seasons running up to the Second World War, though his bowling was an increasingly idiosyncratic mixture of spin and swing. In the war, he served in the Royal Air Force. After the war, Meyer resumed his prewar pattern of late summer home games in 1946, but then, in 1947, at the age of 42, allowed himself his solitary season of full- time cricket as Somerset's captain. By this stage, he was badly affected by lumbago, and though he scored 850 runs and took 43 wickets, the season was not a success for Somerset, and he stood down at the end of the year. He played a couple of first-class matches in each of the next three seasons, and then retired from cricket to concentrate full-time on schoolmastering and developing his school at Millfield. Personality The Old Rectory in Clophill where Meyer was born Meyer was unpredictable in most of what he did. Tales of his eccentric behaviour are legion and many of them appear to have more than a smattering of truth; but despite all of this, he was also a genuinely far-sighted educationalist, an unorthodox but successful entrepreneur, and a talented, if unharnessed sportsman. He fiercely inspired loyalty, but also, often at the same time, a large measure of exasperation. Meyer was a restless character, and tales of eccentric behaviour are not confined to the cricket pitch; some examples are as follows: *Apparently in a 1947 county game, the Somerset cricketer Arthur Wellard, even older than Meyer, was bowling rather well, when Northamptonshire batsman Dennis Brookes played a false stroke through the slips which Meyer, too crippled by lumbago to bend down, failed to catch. Meyer reached into his back pocket: \\"Sorry Arthur, here's a quid.\\" *He once pulled the communication cord on the Manchester train so that his players could get some food. *In a match interrupted by rain, Somerset took the field with only 10 men until Meyer appeared under a large red umbrella. *Meyer allegedly needed little sleep, which he would take in the headmaster's study. He carried a horse racing form book along with other more academic works and on occasion went to London where he wagered large sums of money in gambling casinos, often losing the lot.

In 1939, it was taken over by the city and named Mannheim School of Engineering. In 1969 finally, it was taken over again by the State of Baden-W√ºrttemberg and renamed State School of Engineering. As a consequence, the curriculum was broadened by adding, among others, the subjects chemical engineering, process engineering, and informatics. In 1971, the School of Engineering was officially promoted to the status of a University of Applied Sciences. In 1995, the City College of Design was integrated into the university as the Faculty of Design, comprising institutes for interactive media, print media, time based media, photography, and design sciences. When the Mannheim School of Social Affairs joined the university in a merger in 2006, the university was renamed to Hochschule Mannheim.

Origins The details of his origins are not known. It is likely that he came from another Bantu kingdom to the East of the Lualaba river. Prophecy Kongolo was a tyrant ruling over indigenous people of the Upemba Depression. Wanting to create a kingdom, he consulted the prophet Mujibu. Mujibu prophesied that he could never rule as he was a commoner; but soon the Bulopwe ‚Äúsacral royal blood‚Äù would arrive. If he welcomed him properly, blessings and prosperity would come with the Bulopwe and Kongolo would establish a kingdom, but if he went against him; his God would take away his ruler ship and he would be put to death. The Arrival and founding of the Luba For unknown reasons Ilunga Mbili left his Kingdom which general belief place it to the east of Lake Tanganyika. He came out of a lake where he meets Kongolo‚Äôs sisters Mabela and Bulala. Contrary to the natives, he was tall and dark complexioned and had thin features accentuated by his sharp nose. He wore a red feather on his head and by his princely garments, Mabela and Bulala recognized him as nobility so they decided to escort him and his suites to Kongolo. Kongolo welcomed Ilunga Mbili to his court and eventually put him at the head of his army. Ilunga Mbili was a military strategist, and advised Kongolo on political matters as well; he led wars in all directions and expanded Kongolo‚Äôs control of the land to create the Luba Kingdom in 1585. Kongolo gave him his two sisters in marriage and he begat two sons, Kalala Ilunga from Mabela and Tshibinda Ilunga from Bulala. Ilunga Mbili was a warrior, a hunter and prophet. He was feared and exalted for his mystical abilities; he introduced his God, his religion and culture to the Kingdom. His fame overshadowed that of Kongolo which created many conflicts between the two. Against the advice of the prophet Mujibu, Kongolo plots to have Ilunga Mbili assassinated. Mabela and Bulanda inform him of their brother‚Äôs plot. Ilunga Mbili gives each of his wives a red feather and his princely attributes and instructs them to give it to his children when they become men, and they are to find him and show these attributes if they want him to recognize them as his sons. Ilunga Mbili blessed his children and put them under the protection of the Angel and went back to his Kingdom with his suites. He never came back, it is said that he left as he came, on water. His children grew up under the guidance of the prophet Mujibu, and eventually fulfilled Mujibu‚Äôs prophecy by killing their uncle Kongolo. Legacy Out of him came two empires, that of the Luba Empire under his son Kalala Ilunga and that of the Lunda Empire under his second son Tshibinda Ilunga. Today he is claimed as an ancestor and civilizing hero by different Kingdoms and Chiefdoms of both Kasai provinces and Katanga province of the Democratic Republic of Congo, eastern Angola and Zambia including such people as the Kazembe, Chokwe, and Bemba people. His direct descendants through Tshibinda Ilunga are the Bakwa Dishi of Miabi ruled by Mbayi Futa Tshitumbu also known as Andre-Philippe Futa. The Bakwa Dishi left the Lunda Empire in mid 17th century due to civil wars from the Lunda people and settled in the current Kasai-oriental Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo. His direct descendant through Kalala Ilunga are those of the Luba-Kabongo whose present ruler is Kumwimba Kabongo Kansh‚Äôimbu and Luba-Kasongo whose last ruler was Kisula Ngoy in 1964; Kalala Ilunga‚Äôs lineage split in two in 1889 due to succession disputes.

Plot The film opens on Mart√≠n Santom√©'s (H√©ctor Alterio) 49th birthday, a widower and the father of three children: the eldest, the embittered Esteban (Luis Brandoni); the caring middle-child Blanca (Marilina Ross) and Jaime (Oscar Mart√≠nez), a closeted homosexual. He goes to work thinking they have forgotten his birthday, and once at the office, he assigns two new employees to their jobs: the effeminate, nervous Santini (Antonio Gasalla) and the young Laura (Ana Mar√≠a Picchio), with whom he soon develops a bond. Back home, Mart√≠n is surprised with a party thrown by his children. After having a one-night stand with a woman he met on the bus (Norma Aleandro), Mart√≠n starts going through a series of events that alter his life completely. Santini has a nervous breakdown at work and rants against the complacency of his co-workers; he is subsequently replaced, though the breakdown marks Mart√≠n and forces him to look at his own life. His son Jaime finally comes out and decides to leave home to save the family from embarrassment and further complications. Topping it all, Mart√≠n, who has befriended Laura, professes his love for her at a caf√© and implores her to look beyond the age difference (he is 49, she is 24) and give him a chance. She accepts. The two start dating and Mart√≠n regains his wont of living. Their relationship never falters, and hints of infidelity are quickly dismissed. He moves into her apartment, forsaking his son and daughter (who starts dating a man herself). This upsets Esteban even more, who blames his father for giving him a mediocre life. Mart√≠n implores him that it is never late to change, and they reconcile. The film's climax begins with the untimely demise of Laura, who contracts flu and dies from heart failure shortly thereafter. Mart√≠n once again regains his bleak view of life and the world. He realizes that his romance with Laura was nothing but \\"a truce with life\\". The film ends on an ambiguous tone, as Esteban tries to comfort his father, roles inverted, and the camera centers on Mart√≠n, leaning against the wall, looking more hopeless than ever.

Su√°rez  Background  Argentine actor Sergio Ren√°n had been performing in films since 1951 under the direction of noted filmmakers Mario Soffici, Lucas Demare and three times under Leopoldo Torre Nilsson. It was in his last collaboration with Torre Nilsson, in 1973, that he met fellow co-stars H√©ctor Alterio and Norma Aleandro. A year later he would cast them both in a starring role and a cameo appearance respectively in his film debut, La tregua. A year after its release, La tregua was submitted to the Academy Awards (the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film) and won a nomination (the first Academy Award nomination in Argentine film history) but lost out to Federico Fellini's Amarcord.Schwartz, Latin American Films, 1932 - 1994, p. 249 The film has since gained cult status in Argentina. A Mexican remake was made in 2003.
